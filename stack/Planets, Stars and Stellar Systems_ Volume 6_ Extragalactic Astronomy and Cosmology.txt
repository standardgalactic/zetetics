Series Preface
It is my great pleasure to introduce “Planets, Stars, and Stellar Systems” (PSSS). As a “Springer
Reference”, PSSS is intended for graduate students to professionals in astronomy, astrophysics
and planetary science, but it will also be useful to scientists in other fields whose research inter-
ests overlap with astronomy. Our aim is to capture the spirit of 21st century astronomy – an
empirical physical science whose almost explosive progress is enabled by new instrumentation,
observational discoveries, guided by theory and simulation.
Each volume, edited by internationally recognized expert(s), introduces the reader to a
well-defined area within astronomy and can be used as a text or recommended reading for
an advanced undergraduate or postgraduate course. Volume 1, edited by Ian McLean, is an
essential primer on the tools of an astronomer, i.e., the telescopes, instrumentation and detec-
tors used to query the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Volume 2, edited by Howard Bond, is a
compendium of the techniques and analysis methods that enable the interpretation of data col-
lected with these tools. Volume 3, co-edited by Linda French and Paul Kalas, provides a crash
course in the rapidly converging fields of stellar, solar system and extrasolar planetary science.
Volume 4, edited by Martin Barstow, is one of the most complete references on stellar structure
and evolution available today. Volume 5, edited by Gerard Gilmore, bridges the gap between
our understanding of stellar systems and populations seen in great detail within the Galaxy
and those seen in distant galaxies. Volume 6, edited by Bill Keel, nicely captures our current
understanding of the origin and evolution of local galaxies to the large scale structure of the
universe.
The chapters have been written by practicing professionals within the appropriate sub-
disciplines. Available in both traditional paper and electronic form, they include extensive
bibliographicand hyperlink references tothe current literature that will helpreaders toacquire a
solid historical and technical foundation in that area. Each can also serve as a valuable reference
for a course or refresher for practicing professional astronomers. Those familiar with the “Stars
and Stellar Systems” series from several decades ago will recognize some of the inspiration for
the approach we have taken.
Very many people have contributed to this project. I would like to thank Harry Blom and
Sonja Guerts (Sonja Japenga at the time) of Springer, who originally encouraged me to pur-
sue this project several years ago. Special thanks to our outstanding Springer editors Ramon
Khanna (Astronomy) and Lydia Mueller (Major Reference Works) and their hard-working edi-
torial team Jennifer Carlson, Elizabeth Ferrell, Jutta Jaeger-Hamers, Julia Koerting, and Tamara
Schineller. Their continuous enthusiasm, friendly prodding and unwavering support made this
series possible. Needless to say (but I’m saying it anyway), it was not an easy task shepherding
a project this big through to completion!
Most of all, it has been a privilege to work with each of the volume Editors listed above and
over 100 contributing authors on this project. I’ve learned a lot of astronomy from them, and I
hope you will, too!

Preface to Volume 6
Intentionally, this compendium invites contrast with the similarly titled volume from 1975,
edited by Alan and Mary Sandage and Jerome Kristian. They describe its view as largely
a product of the late 1960s. Our understanding of galaxies then, despite the already enor-
mous observational and theoretical effort summarized, now seems woefully incomplete, largely
because we stand on the shoulders of technological innovators. We were then at the very dawn
of X-ray observations of galaxies and clusters, and likewise our knowledge of the radio struc-
tures of galaxies and AGN was poised for dramatic improvements in quality and quantity. AGN
were still a novelty whose connection to “ordinary” galaxies was almost unknown; the model
of energy release during accretion into massive black holes cold not yet be clearly formulated.
As far as we knew then galaxy masses were baryonic, and there was something suspi-
cious about virial mass estimates for galaxy clusters. Photometry of galaxies remained a tedious
project, either using photomultipliers or the black art of calibrated photographic photometry.
Digital instrumentation for optical astronomy was just beginning to appear; the basic tech-
niques of observation had advanced only incrementally for many years. One catalog volume
could still contain essentially all the photometric and redshift data ever obtained for galaxies.
We knew almost nothing about the evolution of galaxies; the relevant observations remained
closely mixed with the quest for the fundamental parameters of cosmology.
Since that volume appeared (during my undergraduateyears), our view of galaxies and their
context has broadened dramatically, sometimes in ways scarcely conceivable then.
It seems appropriate to contrast many of these views to our current picture. Not only can we
trace the history of star formation (galaxy evolution seen in the act) across cosmic time, but we
can address this question with constraints all the way from the X-ray to radio regimes, coupling
direct detection of young stellar populations with the secondhand emission from dust grains
and supernova products.
We continue to find value in the galaxy categories bequeathed by Edwin Hubble, Alan
Sandage, and Sidney van den Bergh, but now extend the study of galaxy structure across cos-
mic time and wavelength. Connections emerge (some hotly debated) between details of galaxy
structure and events in galaxy history. Again and again, crucial observable properties of galaxies
are seen to be driven by dark matter, whose properties are being narrowed by such techniques
as gravitational lensing.
With the finding of supermassive black holes (and thus potentially “dead quasars”) in most
luminous galaxies, we seem to have the answer to a question posed by Joe Miller decades ago-are
quasars important or merely interesting? If galaxies are important, so are quasars.
Ourunderstanding ofclusters and larger-scale structures has been revolutionized, both with
the finding that the hot intracluster medium carries more mass than the stars, and with broad
surveys showing statistical properties of superclusters, voids, and filaments (it is gratifying to
note that one figure in this volume shows a reprocessing of the same galaxy counts shown in
contour form by C.D. Shane in 1975). Further, we are starting to fill in physical detail as to the
ways galaxies are affected by their environments. At the level of detail we can now reach, no
galaxy is really an island Universe.

Preface to Volume 6
The cosmic distance scale remains important, but we are in a very different stage. A web of
interlocking as well as independent measurements has narrowed the value of the local Hubble
constant to a few per cent, so that local motions superimposed on the expansion are measurable.
We are at a key juncture in cosmology. Recent results have dramatically narrowed the values
of the Hubble constant, mass density, and fluctuation amplitude in the early Universe, with
further refinements expected soon from the Planck mission. Fine structure in the microwave
background radiation encodes a rich range of both physical and astrophysical processes. Yet
we still only anticipate a physical understanding of whatever causes the acceleration of cosmic
expansion indicated by multiple techniques. Such terms as dark energy, cosmological constant,
and quintessence at this point serve mostly to organize our ignorance.
Likewise, with new facilities capable of narrowing the observational Dark Ages, we see
promise of adding new bodies of data to underpin our understanding of galaxy formation, and
the first stars, and the growth of black holes in the early Universe.
All readers of this collection owe a debt to the community spirit of the authors, who have
invested so much time and effort into making their contributions. I hope that this collection
shares with its predecessor a long useful life for many chapters, but also the scientific joy of
being overtaken in some aspects by utterly unexpected discoveries.

Dr. Oswalt has been a member of the Florida Tech faculty since 1982 and was the first profes-
sional astronomer in the Department of Physics and Space Sciences. He serves on a number of
professional society and advisory committees each year. From 1998 to 2000, Dr. Oswalt served
as Program Director for Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics at the National Science Founda-
tion. After returning to Florida Tech in 2000, he served as Associate Dean for Research for the
College of Science (2000–2005) and interim Vice Provost for Research (2005–2006). He is now
Head of the Department of Physics & Space Sciences. Dr. Oswalt has written over 200 scientific
articles and has edited three astronomy books, in addition to serving as Editor-in-Chief for the
six-volume Planets, Stars, and Stellar Systems series.
Dr. Oswalt is the founding chairman of the Southeast Association for Research in Astron-
omy (SARA), a consortium of ten southeastern universities that operates automated 1-meter
class telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory in Chile (see the website www.saraobservatory.org for details). These facilities,
which are remotely accessible on the Internet, are used for a variety of research projects by
faculty and students. They also support the SARA Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) program, which brings students from all over the U.S. each summer to participate one-
on-one with SARA faculty mentors in astronomical research projects. In addition, Dr. Oswalt
secured funding for the 0.8-meter Ortega telescope on the Florida Tech campus. It is the largest
research telescope in the State of Florida.
Dr. Oswalt’s primary research focuses on spectroscopic and photometric investigations of
verywide binaries that contain known orsuspected white dwarfstars. These pairs ofstars, whose
separations are so large that orbital motion is undetectable, provide a unique opportunity to
explore the low luminosity ends of both the white dwarf cooling track and the main sequence;
to test competing models of white dwarf spectral evolution; to determine the space motions,
masses, and luminosities for the largest single sample of white dwarfs known; and to set a lower
limit to the age and dark matter content of the Galactic disk.

William C. Keel is Professor of Astronomy at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. His
astronomical interests began as a youngster using a secondhand reflector in the back yard, and
he remains active as an amateur as well as professional astronomer. His undergraduate work
was at Vanderbilt University, followed by a Ph.D. from the University of California, Santa Cruz.
Dr. Keel had postdoctoral positions at Kitt Peak National Observatory and at Leiden, before
taking up a faculty position in Alabama. His research interests span the galaxies - active galactic
nuclei, galaxy interactions and evolution, dust in galaxies. Observationally oriented, his work
has used spectral bands from the radio to the X-ray regimes, with the strongest emphasis in the
optical and ultraviolet. These results have been reported in 150 refereed papers.
In recent years, much of his work has been tied to the enormously successful Galaxy Zoo
citizen-science project. He continues to have scheduling responsibilities for the two telescopes
of the SARA consortium, and has served on numerous NASA review panels including two
Senior Reviews.
Dr. Keel has been active in outreach beyond the formal classroom, through magazine
articles, an online presence in several discussion forums, and webcomics explaining ongoing
Hubble Space Telescope programs.
He has written a technical monograph, The Road to Galaxy Formation, and the nontechni-
cal volume The Sky at Einstein’s Feet tracing the impact of relativity throughout astronomy.

Galaxy Morphology 1

Abstract:
Hidden in the bewildering details of galaxy morphology are clues to how galaxies
formed and have evolved over a Hubble time. This article reviews the phenomenology of galaxy
morphology and classification using an extensive set of illustrations to delineate as many types
as possible and to show how different types connect to various physical processes and character-
istics. The old classification systems are refined, and new types introduced, as the explosion in
available morphological data has modified our views on the structure and evolution of galaxies.

Introduction
In the nearly 100 years since galaxy morphology became a topic of research, much has been
learned about galactic structure and dynamics. Known only as “nebulae” a century ago, galax-
ies were found to have a wide range of largely inexplicable forms whose relations to one another
were a mystery. As data accumulated, it became clear that galaxies are fundamental units of mat-
ter in space, and an understanding of how they formed and evolved became one of the major
goals of extragalactic studies. Even in the era of space observations, galaxy morphology contin-
ues to be the backbone of extragalactic research as modern instruments provide information
on galactic structure across a wide range of distances and look-back times.
In spite of the advances in instrumentation and the explosion of data, classical galaxy mor-
phology (i.e., the visual morphological classification in the style of Hubble and others) has not
lost its relevance. The reasons for this are as follows:
1. Morphology is still a logical starting point for understanding galaxies. Sorting galaxies into
their morphological categories is similar to sorting stars into spectral types and can lead to
important astrophysical insights. Any theory of galaxy formation and evolution will have
to, at some point, account for the vast array of galactic forms.
2. Galaxy morphology is strongly correlated with galactic star formation history. Galaxies
where star formation ceased gigayears ago tend to look very different from those where star
formation continues at the present time. Classical morphology recognizes these differences
in an ordered way.
3. Information on galaxy morphology, in the form of new types of galaxies, multiwavelength
views of previously known galaxy types, and higher resolution views of all or part of some
galaxies, has exploded as modern instrumentation has superceded the old photographic
plates that were once used exclusively for galaxy classification.
4. Galaxy classification has gone beyond the realm of a few thousand galaxies to that of a
million galaxies through the Galaxy Zoo project. Not only this, but Galaxy Zoo has taken
morphology from the exclusive practice of a few experts to the public at large, thus facil-
itating citizen science at its best. Galaxy Zoo images are also in color, thus allowing the
recognition of special galaxy types and features based on stellar populations or gaseous

5. Finally, deep surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope have extended morphological stud-
ies well beyond the realm of the nearby galaxies that dominated early catalogues, allowing
detailed morphology to be distinguished at unprecedented redshifts.

Galaxy Morphology
Now, more than ever, galaxy morphology is a vibrant subject that continues to provide surprises
as more galaxies are studied for their morphological characteristics across the electromagnetic
spectrum. It is clear that a variety of effects are behind observed morphologies, including initial
protogalactic cloud conditions, environmental density and merger/interaction history, internal
perturbations, gas accretions, nuclear activity, properties of the dark matter halo, secular evo-
lution, as well as the diversity in star formation histories, and that a global perspective based
on large numbers of galaxies will improve theoretical models and give a more reliable picture
of galactic evolution.
The goal of this chapter is to present the phenomenology of galaxy morphology in an orga-
nized way and highlight recent advances in understanding what factors influence morphology
and how various galaxy types are interpreted. This chapteris a natural follow-up to the excellent
review of galaxy morphology and classification by Sandage (1975) in Volume IX of the classic
Stars and Stellar Systems series. It also complements the recently published de Vaucouleurs Atlas
of Galaxies (Buta et al. 2007, hereafter the dVA), which provided a detailed review of the state
and technique of galaxy classification up to about the year 2005. Illustrations are very impor-
tant in a review of this nature, and this chapter draws on a large number of sources of images.
For this purpose, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database
(NED), and the dVA have been most useful.

Overview
As extended objects rather than point sources, galaxies show a wide variety of forms, some due
to intrinsic structures, others due to the way the galaxy is oriented to the line of sight. The ran-
dom orientations and the wide spread of distances are the principal factors that can complicate
interpretations of galaxy morphology. If we could view every galaxy along its principal axis of
rotation, and from the same distance, then fairer comparisons would be possible. Nevertheless,
morphologies seen in face-on galaxies can also often be recognized in more inclined galaxies
(>Fig. 1-1). It is only for the highest inclinations that morphology switches from face-on radial
structure to vertical structure. In general, we either know the planar structure in a galaxy or we
know its vertical structure, but we usually cannot know both well from analysis of images alone.

Galaxy morphology began to get interesting when the “Leviathan of Parsonstown,” the
72-in. meridian-based telescope built in the 1840s by William Parsons, Third Earl of Rosse, on
the grounds of Birr Castle in Ireland, revealed spiral patterns in many of the brighter Herschel
and Messier “nebulae.” The nature of these nebulae as galaxies was not fully known at the time,
but the general suspicion was that they were star systems (“island universes”) like the Milky
Way, only too distant to be easily resolved into their individual stars. In fact, one of Parsons’
motivations for building the “Leviathan” was to try and resolve the nebulae to prove this idea.
The telescope did not convincingly do this, but the discovery of spiral structure itself was very
important because such structure added to the mystique of the nebulae. The spiral form was
not a random pattern and had to be significant in what it meant. The telescope was not capable
of photography, and observers were only able to render what they saw with it in the form of
sketches. The most famous sketch, that of M51 and its companion NGC 5195, has been widely
reproduced in introductory astronomy textbooks.
While visual observations could reveal some important aspects of galaxy morphology, early
galaxy classification was based on photographic plates taken in the blue region of the spectrum.
Silver bromide dry emulsion plates were the staple of astronomy beginning in the 1870s and
were relatively more sensitive to blue light than to red light. Later, photographs taken with
Kodak 103a-O and IIa-O plates became the standard for galaxy classification. In this part of
the spectrum, massive star clusters, dominated by spectral class O and B stars, are prominent
and often seen to line the spiral arms of galaxies. These clusters can give blue-light photographs
a great deal of detailed structure for classification. It is these types of photographs which led to
the galaxy classification systems in use today.
In such photographs, we see manygalaxies as a mixofstructures. Inclined galaxies reveal the
ubiquitous disk shape, the most highly flattened component of any galaxy. Studies of Doppler
wavelength shifts in the spectra of disk objects (like HII regions and integrated star light) reveal
that disks rotate differentially. If a galaxy is spiral, the disk is usually where the arms are found,
and also where the bulk of interstellar matter is found. The radial luminosity profile of a disk
is usually exponential, with departures from an exponential being due to the presence of other
structures.
In the central area of a disk-shaped galaxy, there is also often a bright and sometimes less
flattened mass concentration in the form ofa bulge. The nature ofbulges and how theyform have
been a topic of much recent research and are discussed further in >Sect. 9. Disk galaxies range
from virtually bulgeless to bulge-dominated. In the center, there may also be a conspicuous
nucleus, a bright central concentration that was usually lost to overexposure in photographs.
Nuclei may be dominated by ordinary star light, or may be active, meaning their spectra show
evidence of violent gas motions.
Bars are the most important internal perturbations seen in disk-shaped galaxies. A bar is
an elongated mass often made of old stars crossing the center. If spiral structure is present, the
arms usually begin near the ends of the bar. Although most easily recognized in the face-on
view, bars have generated great interest recently in the unique ways they can also be detected in
the edge-on view. Not all bars are made exclusively of old stars. In some bulgeless galaxies, the
bar has considerable gas and recent star formation.
Related to bars are elongated disk features known as ovals. Ovals usually differ from bars in
lacking higher order Fourier components (i.e., have azimuthal intensity distributions that vary
mainly as 2θ), but nevertheless can be major perturbations in a galactic disk. The entire disk of
a galaxy may be oval, or a part of it may be oval. Oval disks are most easily detected if there is
considerable light or structure at larger radii.

Galaxy Morphology
Rings are prominent features in some galaxies. Often defined by recent star formation, rings
may be completely closed features or may be partial or open, the latter called “pseudorings.”
Rings can be narrow and sharp or broad and diffuse. It is particularly interesting that several
kinds of rings are seen and that some galaxies can have as many as four recognizable ring fea-
tures. Nuclear rings are the smallest rings and are typically seen in the centers of barred galaxies.
Inner rings are intermediate-scale features that often envelop the bar in a barred galaxy. Outer
rings are large, low-surface-brightness features that typicallylie at about twice the radius ofa bar.
Other kinds of rings, called accretion rings, polar rings, and collisional rings, are also known
but are much rarer than the inner, outer, and nuclear rings of barred galaxies. The latter kinds
of rings are also not exclusive to barred galaxies but may be found also in nonbarred galaxies.
Lenses are features, made usually of old stars, that have a shallow brightness gradient interior
to a sharp edge. They are commonly seen in Hubble’s disk-shaped S0 class (>Sect. 5.2). If a bar
is present, the bar may fill a lens in one dimension. Lenses may be round or slightly elliptical in
shape. If elliptical in shape, they would also be considered ovals.
Nuclearbars are the small bars occasionally seen in the centers of barred galaxies, often lying
within a nuclear ring. When present in a barred galaxy, the main bar is called the “primary bar”
and the nuclear bar is called the “secondary bar.” It is possible for a nuclear bar to exist in the
absence of a primary bar.
Dust lanes are often seen in optical images of spiral galaxies and may appear extremely reg-
ular and organized. They are most readily evident in edge-on or highly inclined disk galaxies
but are still detectable in the face-on view, often on the leading edges of bars or the concave
sides of strong inner spiral arms.
Spiral arms may also show considerable morphological variation. Spirals may be regular
1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-armed patterns and may also be higher order multiarmed patterns. Spirals may
be tightly wrapped (low pitch angle) or very open (high pitch angle). A grand-design spiral is
a well-defined global pattern, often detectable as smooth variations in the stellar density of old
disk stars. A flocculent spiral is made of small pieces of spiral structure that appear sheared by
differential rotation. The appearance of these features can be strongly affected by dust, such that
at longer wavelengths a flocculent spiral may appear more grand design. Pseudorings can be
thought of as variable pitch angle spirals which close on themselves, as opposed to continuously
opening, constant pitch angle, logarithmic spirals.
There are also numerous structures outside the scope of traditional galaxy classification,
often connected with strong interactions between galaxies. Plus, the above described features
are not necessarily applicable or relevant to what we see in very distant galaxies. Accounting for
all of the observed features of nearby galaxies, and attempting to connect what we see in nearby
to what is seen at high redshift, is a major goal of morphological studies.

Galaxy Classiﬁcation
As noted by Sandage (1975), the first step in studying any class of objects is a classification of
those objects. Classification built around small numbers ofshared characteristics can be used for
sorting galaxies into fundamental categories, which can then be the basis for further research.
From such research, physical relationships between identified classes may emerge, and these
relationships may foster a theoretical interpretation that places the whole class of objects into a
broader context.

The basic idea of galaxy classification is to take the complex combinations of structures
described in the previous section and summarize them with a few type symbols. Sandage (1975)
describes the earlier classification systems of Wolf, Reynolds, Lundmark, and Shapley that fell
into disuse more than 50 years ago. The Morgan (1958) spectral type/concentration classifi-
cation system, which was based on a connection between morphology (specifically central
concentration) and the stellarcontent of the central regions, was used recently by Bershadyet al.
(2000) in a mostly quantitative manner (see also Abraham et al. 2003). Thus, Morgan’s system
has in a way survived into the modern era but not in the purely visual form that he proposed.
Only one Morgan galaxy type, the supergiant cD type, is still used extensively(>Sect. 10.6). Van
den Bergh’s luminosity/arm morphology classification system is described by van den Bergh
(1998; see>Sect. 6.5).
The big survivor of the early visual classification systems was that of Hubble (1926, 1936),
as later revised and expanded upon by Sandage (1961) and de Vaucouleurs (1959). Sandage
(1975) has argued that one reason Hubble’s view prevailed is that he did not try and account
for every superficial detail but kept his classes broad enough that the vast majority of galaxies
could be sorted into one of his proposed bins. These bins were schematically illustrated in Hub-
ble’s famous “tuning fork”1 (Hubble 1936; reproduced in >Fig. 1-2), recognizing a sequence of
progressive flattenings from ellipticals to spirals. Ellipticals had only two classification details:
the smoothly declining brightness distribution with no inflections and no evidence for a disk
and the ellipticity of the isophotes, indicated by a number after the “E” symbol. (For example,
E3 means the ellipticity is 0.3.) Spirals were systems more flattened than an E7 galaxy that could
be subdivided according to the degree of central concentration, the degree of openness of the
arms, the degree of resolution of the arms into complexes of star formation (all three crite-
ria determine position along the fork), and the presence or absence of a bar (determining the
appropriate prong of the fork).

Galaxy Morphology
The S0 class at the juncture of the prongs of the fork was still hypothetical in 1936. As “arm-
less disk galaxies,” S0s were mysterious because all examples known in 1936 were barred. These
were classified as SBa, but this was a troubling inconsistency because nonbarred Sa galaxies had
full spiral patterns. Hubble predicted the existence of nonbarred S0s to fill the gap between type
E72 and Sa and cure what he felt was a “cataclysmic” transition.
It was not long before Hubble himself realized that the tuning fork could not adequately
represent the full diversity of galaxy morphologies, and after 1936, he worked on a revision that
included real examples of the sought group: nonbarred S0 galaxies. Based on fragmentary notes
he left behind, Sandage (1961) prepared the Hubble Atlas of Galaxies to illustrate Hubble’s revi-
sion and also addeda third dimension: the presence or absence of a ring. This was the first major
galaxy atlas illustrating a classification system in a detailed, sophisticated way with beautifully
produced photographs. Hubble’s revision, with van den Bergh luminosity classes (Sandage and
Tammann 1981), was updated and extended to types later than Sc by Sandage and Bedke (1994).
Because Sandage (1961) and Sandage and Bedke (1994) describe the Hubble–Sandage revi-
sion so thoroughly, the details will not be repeated here. Instead, the focus of the next section
will be on the de Vaucouleurs revision as outlined in the dVA. The reasons for this are (1) the de
Vaucouleurs classification provides the most familiar galaxy types to extragalactic researchers,
mostly because of extensive continuing use of the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies
(RC3, de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) and (2) the de Vaucouleurs classification is still evolving to
cover more details of galaxy morphology considered significant at this time. It should be noted
that both the de Vaucouleurs and Hubble–Sandage revisions are strictly applicable only to z ≈0
galaxies and that it is often difficult to fit objects having z > 0.5 neatly into the categories defining
these classification systems. High redshift galaxy morphology is described in >Sect. 13.

A Continuum of Galactic Forms
The Hubble tuning fork is useful because it provides a visual representation of information Hub-
ble (1926) had only stated in words. The fork contains an implication of continuity. For example,
it does not rule out that there might be galaxies intermediate in characteristics between an “Sa”
or “Sb” spiral or between a normal “S” spiral and a barred “SB” spiral. Continuity along the ellip-
tical galaxy sequence was always implied as a smooth variation from round ellipticals (E0) to the
most flattened ellipticals (E7). Sandage (1961) describes the modification that made the Hubble
system more three-dimensional: the introduction of the (r) (inner ring) and (s) (pure spiral)
subtypes. Continuity between these characteristics was possible using the combined subtype
(rs). Thus, already by 1961, the Hubble classification system had become much more compli-
cated than it was in 1926 or 1936. The addition of the S0 class was one reason for this, but the
(r) and (s) subtypes were another.
In the Hubble–Sandage classification, it became common to denote galaxies on the left part
of the Hubble sequence as “early-type” galaxies and those on the right part as “late-type” galax-
ies. By the same token, Sa and SBa spirals became “early-type spirals” while Sc and SBc spirals
became “late-type spirals.” Sb and SBb types became known as “intermediate-type spirals.” The
reason for these terminologies was convenience and borrows terminology often used for stars.
2Van den Bergh (2009a) shows that E0–E4 galaxies are more luminous on average than are E5–E7 galaxies,
suggesting that all E7 galaxies (and not many have been recognized) are actually S0 galaxies. Van den Bergh
argues that genuine E galaxies may be no more flattened than E6.

Young, massive stars of spectral classes O and B were known as “early-type stars” while older
stars of cooler spectral types were known as “late-type stars.” Hubble stated that his use of these
temporal descriptions for galaxies had no evolutionary implications. An irony in this is that it
eventually became clear that early-type galaxies are dominated by late-type stars, while late-type
galaxies often have significant numbers of early-type stars.
De Vaucouleurs (1959) took the idea of continuity of galaxy morphology a step further by
developing what he referred to as the classification volume (> Fig. 1-3). In this revision of the
Hubble–Sandage (1961) classification, galaxy morphology represents a continuous sequence of
forms in a three-dimensional volume with a long axis and circular cross sections of varying size.
The long axis of the volume is the stage, or type, and it represents the long axis of the original
Hubble tuning fork. The short axes are the family and the variety, which refer to apparent bar
strength and the presence or absence of an inner ring, respectively. In addition to Hubble’s
original stages E, Sa, Sb, and Sc, the classification volume includes new stages: lateellipticals, E+;
“very late” spirals, Sd; “Magellanic spirals,” Sm; and “Magellanic irregulars,” Im. The S0 class is
included in the same position along the sequence, between E’s and spirals, but is subdividedinto
three stages. The characteristics defining individual stages are described further in >Sect. 5.2.
The stage is considered the most fundamental dimension of the classification volume
because measured physical parameters, such as integrated color indices, mean surface bright-
nesses, and neutral hydrogen content, correlate well with position along the sequence (e.g.,
Buta et al. 1994). Early-type galaxies tend to have redder colors, higher average surface bright-
nesses, and lower neutral hydrogen content than late-type galaxies. The family and variety axes

of the classification volume indicate the considerable variations in morphology at a given stage.
A famous sketch of families and varieties near stage Sb, drawn by de Vaucouleurs himself dur-
ing a cloudy night at McDonald Observatory circa 1962, is shown in Sandage (1975) and in
Fig. 1.13 of the dVA. The classification volume is broader in the middle compared to the ends
because the diversity of galaxy morphology is largest at stages like S0/a and Sa. Bars and rings
are often most distinct and most recognizable at these stages. Such features are not character-
istic of E galaxies, so the volume must be narrow at that end. Along the S0 sequence, bars and
rings are barely developed among the earliest S0s (S0−) and well developed among the late S0s
(S0+); thus, the volume begins to broaden. Among very late-type galaxies, Sd, Sdm, Sm, and
Im, bars are actually very frequent, but closed rings (r) are not. Thus, the volume narrows at
that end as well.
For the purposes of illustrating morphology, blue-light digital images converted to units of
magnitudes per square arcsecond are used when available. This approach is described in the
dVA, and requires calibration of the images, usually based on published photoelectric multi-
aperture photometry. In addition, some of the illustrations used (especially in >Sect. 15) are
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey or from other sources. These are not in the same units but
still provide excellent illustrations of morphology.
Unlike the dVA, the scope of this chapter extends beyond the traditional UBVRI wave-
bands. It is only during the past 20 years that significant morphological information has
been obtained for galaxies outside these bands, mostly at mid- and far-ultraviolet and mid-
IR wavelengths from space-based observatories capable of imaging in these wavelengths to
unprecedented depths, providing a new view of galaxy morphology that is only beginning to be
explored. A useful review of many issues in morphology is provided by van den Bergh (1998).

Galaxy Types: Stage, Family, and Variety
5.1 Elliptical and Spheroidal Galaxies
Elliptical galaxies are smooth, amorphous systems with a continuously declining brightness
distribution and no breaks, inflections, zones, or structures, as well as no sign of a disk.
> Figure 1-4 shows some good examples. Because ellipticals are dominated by old stars and
are relatively dust-free, they look much the same at different wavelengths. Hubble’s subclassi-
fication of ellipticals according to apparent ellipticity (En, where n = 10(1−b/a), b/a being the
apparent flattening) was useful, but virtually no physical characteristics of ellipticals correlate
with this parameter (Kormendy and Djorgovski 1989). The n value in the En classification is
simply the projected ellipticity and not easily interpreted in terms of a true flattening without
direct knowledge of the orientation of the symmetry planes. Luminous ellipticals are thought
to be triaxial in structure with an anisotropic velocity dispersion tensor, while lower luminos-
ity ellipticals are more isotropic oblate rotators (Davies et al. 1983). Studies of rotational to
random kinetic energy (V/σ) versus apparent flattening (є) show that massive ellipticals are
slow anisotropic rotators. Ellipticals follow a fundamental plane relationship between the effec-
tive radius re of the light distribution, the central velocity dispersion σ, and mean effective
surface brightness < Ie > (see review by Kormendy and Djorgovski 1989). Dwarf elliptical
galaxies may not follow the same relation as massive ellipticals; this is discussed by Ferguson
and Binggeli (1994).

with no structural details. From left to right the galaxies shown are NGC 1379, 3193, 5322, 1426,
and 720. Type E+ galaxies are “late”ellipticals, which may include faint extended envelopes typical
of large cluster ellipticals or simple transition types to S0−. The examples shown are (left to right):
NGC 1374, 4472, 4406, 4889, and 4623. All of these images are from the dVA (ﬁlters B, V, and g)
The lack of fundamental significance of Hubble’s En classification led some authors to seek
an alternative, more physically useful approach. Kormendy and Bender (1996; see also the
review by Schweizer 1998) proposed a revision to Hubble’s tuning fork handle that orders ellip-
ticals according to their velocity anisotropy, since this is a significant determinant of E-galaxy
intrinsic shapes. Velocity anisotropy correlates with the deviations of E galaxy isophotes from
pure elliptical shapes, measured by the parameter a/a, the relative amplitude of the cos θ
Fourier term of these deviations. If this relative amplitude is positive, then the isophotes are
pointy, disky ovals, while if negative, the isophotes are boxy ovals. A boxy elliptical is classified
as E(b), while a disky elliptical is classified as E(d). The correlation with anisotropy is such that
E(b) galaxies have less rotation on average and more velocity anisotropy than E(d) galaxies.
The classification proposed by Kormendy and Bender is shown in >Fig. 1-5, together with
two exceptional examples that show the characteristic isophote shapes. The leftmost of these
two, NGC 7029, is an unusually obvious boxy elliptical at larger radii. This boxiness is the
basis for the classification E(b)5. However, NGC 7029 is not boxy throughout: it shows evi-
dence of a small inner disk and hence is disky at small radii. This is not necessarily taken into
account in the classification. The other image shown in > Fig. 1-5 is of NGC 4697, a galaxy
whose isophotes are visually disky. The idea with the Kormendy and Bender classification is
that it is the disky ellipticals which connect to S0 galaxies and not the boxy ellipticals. However,
NGC 7029 demonstrates that diskiness and boxiness can be a function of radius, thus perhaps
a smooth connection between E(b) and E(d) types (i.e., type E(b,d)) is possible and the order
shown in the Kormendy and Bender revision to the Hubble tuning fork, with boxy Es blending
into the disky Es, could be reasonable.
> Figure 1-5 shows two other galaxies that are clearly related to the boxy-disky ellipticals,
only the inner disk is much more prominent, to the point that both galaxies are generally classi-
fied as S0s. The leftmost of these two, NGC 4638, has a bright edge-on disk which falls short of

Revised classiﬁcation of elliptical galaxies from Kormendy and Bender (1996), as schematically
incorporated into Hubble’s (1936) “tuning fork.” At upper left are two examples of boxy and disky
ellipticals: NGC 7029 (left, B-band) and NGC 4697 (JHKs composite, 2MASS image from NED). At
lower left are two related examples where the inner disk is much more prominent: NGC 4638 (left)
and NGC 4474 (right). The images of these are SDSS g-band
boxy outer isophotes, and is similar to NGC 7029. The rightmost, NGC 4474, is very much like
NGC 4697 but again has a more prominent disk. Michard and Marchal (1993) describe cases
like NGC 4638 and 4474 as showing “a disk fully embedded in a quasi-spherical envelope,”
while other S0s “remain pure disk, except for their central bulge.” The classification S0−/E(b)
and S0−/E(d) is proposed to recognize cases like NGC 4638 and 4474, respectively, using de
Vaucouleurs’s early S0 notation (>Sect. 5.2).3
Note that while the classical En classifications of ellipticals were designed by Hubble to be
estimated by eye, this is not easily done for the E(b) and E(d) classifications, which are most
favored to be distinguished only when the disk is nearly edge-on. Face-on Es with imbed-
ded disks will not show disky isophotes. For example, NGC 7029 and 4697 are extreme cases
where the isophotal deviations are obvious by eye. But for most E galaxies, the E(b)n and E(d)n
classifications can only be judged reliably with measurements of the a/a parameter.
The de Vaucouleurs classification of ellipticals includes a slightly more advanced type called
E+, or “late” ellipticals. It was originally intended to describe “the first stage of the transition
to the S0 class” (de Vaucouleurs 1959). Five examples of E+ galaxies are shown in the second
row of >Fig. 1-4. Galaxies classified as E+ can be the most subtle S0s, but many of the E+ cases
listed in RC3 are the brightest members of clusters that have shallow enough brightness profiles
to appear to have an extended envelope (see >Sect. 10.6). Of the five E+ galaxies shown, NGC
4623 (rare type E+7 in the dVA) is of a much lower luminosity than the other four cases shown.
While S0−is the type most often confused with ellipticals in visual classification, the bin has a
wide spread from the most obvious to the least obvious cases. Thus, a type like E+ is still useful
for distinguishing transitions from E to S0 galaxies.
3After this chapter was completed, Kormendy and Bender (2012) suggested that NGC 4638 represents a
harassed disk galaxy in a dense part of the Virgo Cluster and is not an E galaxy with an acquired or imbedded
disk.

The photometric properties of ellipticals depend on luminosity. In terms of Sersic r

profile fits, large, luminous ellipticals tend to have profiles described better by n ≳4, while
smaller, lower luminosity ellipticals tend to have n < 4, with values as low as 1 (e.g., Caon et al.
1993). Graham and Guzmán (2003) discuss the implications of this correlation on proposed
dichotomies of elliptical galaxies (e.g., Kormendy 1985; Ferrarese et al. 2006). These studies
received a major impetus from the massive photometric analysis of Virgo Cluster elliptical
galaxies by Kormendy et al. (2009). Two issues were considered by these authors (> Fig. 1-6).
The first was whether galaxies classified as dwarf ellipticals (“dE”; see >Sect. 15.2) in the Virgo
Cluster really are the low-luminosity extension of more massive, conventional ellipticals or
something different altogether. Based on parameter correlations, such as r%, the major axis
radius of the isophote containing 10% of the total visual luminosity, versus μ%, the surface
brightness of this isophote, Kormendy et al. show that even the most elliptical-like and lumi-
nous dE galaxies lie on a distinct sequence from normal elliptical galaxies, which tend to lie on a

(like dwarf S0 or dS0 galaxies) as “spheroidal” (Sph) galaxies, including the type “Sph,N,” mean-
ing “nucleated spheroidal” galaxy (>Sect. 15.2). >Figure 1-6 shows several examples of Sph,N
galaxies as compared with several genuine elliptical galaxies. The morphological appearance
alone does not necessarily distinguish the two classes. The classification is physical, being based
mainly on parameter correlations. Kormendy et al. suggest that Sph galaxies are formed from
late-type systems by environmental effects and supernovae. The “home” for Sph galaxies in the
Hubble tuning fork classification is described further in >Sect. 17.
The second issue considered was the physical distinction between “core” elliptical galax-
ies, those where the surface brightness profile approaches either a constant level or a slightly
sloped level with radius approaching zero, and “coreless” ellipticals (also known as “power law”
Es) where the inner profile steepens with decreasing radius (Kormendy 1999). Kormendy et al.
(2009) illustrated both types relative to a Sersic r

n fit to the outer regions of the luminosity pro-
files. In this representation, core Es are “missing light” relative to the fit while coreless Es have
“extra light.” The top row of >Fig. 1-6 shows one core E (NGC 4472) and two coreless Es (NGC
4458 and IC 798 (VCC 1440), the latter a low-luminosity dwarf). The subtle distinctions are
evident in these images, with NGC 4472 showing a soft center and NGC 4458 showing a strong
center. The terminology for both types is mostly historical (Kormendy 1999) and somewhat
counter to the visual impression (i.e., NGC 4472 lacks a bright central peak while NGC 4458
has one, yet the latter is technically coreless). Kormendy et al. show that core and coreless E
galaxies have different Sersic indices, velocity dispersion anisotropy, isophote shapes, and rota-
tional character, with the core Es being of the boxy type and the coreless Es of the disky type
in >Fig. 1-5. The distinction may be tied to the number of mergers that formed the system.
5.2 S0 and Spiral Galaxies
The full classification of spiral and S0 galaxies involves the recognition of the stage, family, and
variety. In de Vaucouleurs’s classification approach, the implication for bars, inner rings, and
stages is a continuum of forms (de Vaucouleurs 1959), so that there are no sharp edges to any
category or “cell” apart from the obvious ones (e.g., there are no galaxies less “barred” than a
nonbarred galaxy, nor are there galaxies more ringed than those with a perfectly closed ring).
The classification of S0 galaxies depends on recognizing the presence of a disk and a bulge
at minimum, and usually a lens as well, and no spiral arms. Examples are shown in >Fig. 1-7.
The display of galaxy images in units of mag arcsec−makes lenses especially easy to detect, as
noted in the dVA. Even if a lens is not obvious, a galaxy could still be an S0 if it shows evidence
of an exponential disk. (Lenses are also not exclusive to S0s.) The “no spiral arms” characteristic
is much stricter in the Hubble–Sandage classification than in the de Vaucouleurs interpretation
because varieties (r, rs, and s) are carried into the de Vaucouleurs classifications of S0s. This
allows the possibility of a classification like SA(s)0−, which would be very difficult to recognize.
Bars enter in the classification of S0s in a similar manner as that of spirals. >Figure 1-7 shows
mainly stage differences among nonbarred and barred S0s. The stage for S0s ranges from early
(S0−) to intermediate (S0○), and finally to late (S0+), in a succession of increasing detail. The ear-
liest nonbarred S0s may be mistaken for elliptical galaxies on photographic images, and indeed

images are from the dVA (ﬁlters B and V)
Sandage and Bedke (1994) note cases where they believe an S0 galaxy has been misclassified as
an elliptical by de Vaucouleurs in his reference catalogues (see also The Revised Shapley-Ames
Catalogue, RSA, Sandage and Tammann 1981). This kind of misinterpretation is less likely for
types S0○and S0+ because these will tend to show more obvious structure.
The morphological distinction between E and S0 galaxies has been considered from a quan-
titative kinematic point of view by Emsellem et al. (2007). These authors argue that the division
of early-type galaxies into E and S0 types is “contrived” and that it is more meaningful to divide
them according to a quantitative kinematic parameter called λR, the specific angular momen-
tum of the stellar component, which is derived from a two-dimensional velocity field obtained
with the SAURON integral field spectrograph (Bacon et al. 2001). Based on this parameter,
early-type galaxies are divided into slow and fast rotators, that is, whetherthey are characterized
by large-scale rotation or not. In a sample of 48 early-types, most were found to be fast rotators
classified as a mix of E and S0 types, while the remainder were found to be slow rotators classi-
fied as Es. This kind of approach, which provides a more physical distinction among early-types,
does not mean the classical E and S0 subdivisions no longer have value but highlights again the
persistent difficulty of distinguishing the earliest S0s from Es by morphology alone.
The transition type S0/a shows the beginnings ofspiral structure. Twoexamples are included
in >Fig. 1-7, one nonbarred and the other barred. Type S0/a is a well-defined stage character-
ized in the de Vaucouleurs 3D classification volume as having a high diversity in family and
variety characteristics. The type received a negative characterization as the “garbage bin” of the
Hubble sequence at one time because troublesome dusty irregulars, those originally classified as
“Irr II” by Holmberg (1950) and later as “I0” by de Vaucouleurs, seemed to fit better in that part

7743, 210, 4535, 925, and IC 2574; Row 3 – NGC 4314, 1300, 3513, 4519, and 4618. All images are
B-band from the dVA
of the sequence. (In fact, de Vaucouleurs et al. (1976) assigned the numerical stage index T = 0
to both S0/a and I0 galaxies.) However, this problem is only a problem at optical wavelengths.
At longer wavelengths (e.g., 3.6 µm), types such as Irr II or I0 are less needed because they can
be defined mainly by dust (Buta et al. 2010a).
In general, the stage for spirals is based on the appearance of the spiral arms (degree of open-
ness and resolution) and also on the relative prominence of the bulge or central concentration.
These are the usual criteria originally applied by Hubble (1926, 1936). >Figure 1-8 shows the
stage sequence for spirals divided according to bar classification (SA, SAB, SB) and as modified
and extended by de Vaucouleurs (1959) to include Sd and Sm types. Intermediate stages, such
as Sab, Sbc, Scd, and Sdm, are shown in >Fig. 1-9. As noted by de Vaucouleurs (1963), these
latter stages are almost as common as the basic ones.
The three Hubble criteria are basically seen in the illustrated galaxies. Sa galaxies tend to
have significant bulges and tightly wrapped and relatively smooth spiral arms. Sab galaxies are
similar to Sa galaxies but show more obvious resolution of the arms. Sb galaxies have more
resolution and more open arms, and generally smaller bulges than Sab galaxies. Sbc galaxies
have considerable resolution and openness of the arms, and also usually significant bulges. In
Sc galaxies, the bulge tends to be very small and the arms patchy and open. Scd galaxies tend
to be relatively bulgeless, patchy armed Sc galaxies. Stage Sd is distinctive mainly as almost
completely bulgeless late-type spirals with often ill-defined spiral structure.

Row 3 – NGC 1398, 1365, 1073, and 4027. All images are B-band from the dVA, except for NGC 4534,
which is SDSS g-band
Stages Sdm and Sm are the most characteristically asymmetric stages, the latest spiral
types along the de Vaucouleurs revised Hubble sequence. They are described in detail by
de Vaucouleurs and Freeman (1972) and by Odewahn (1991). Sm is generally characterized
by virtually no bulge and a single principle spiral arm. If a bar is present, it is usually not at the
center of the disk isophotes, unlike what is normally seen in earlier type barred spirals. This
leads to the concept of an offset barred galaxy. The single spiral arm emanates from one end of
the bar. As noted by Freeman (1975), this is a basic and characteristic asymmetry of the mass
distribution of Magellanic barred spirals. Sdm galaxies are similar but may show a weaker or
shorter second arm. In >Fig. 1-8, NGC 4618 is an especially good example of an SBm type
(Odewahn 1991), while in >Fig. 1-9, NGC 4027 is illustrated as type SBdm.
An important issue regarding these galaxies is whether the optically offset bar is also off-
set from the dynamical rotation center of the disk. In a detailed HI study of the interacting
galaxy pair NGC 4618 and 4625, Bush and Wilcots (2004) found very regular velocity fields
and extended HI disks but no strong offset of the rotation center from the center of the bar.

18 1
Galaxy Morphology
This is similar to what Pence et al. (1988) found for the offset barred galaxy NGC 4027 based on
optical Fabry–Perot interferometry. In contrast, both Magellanic Clouds, which are also offset
barred galaxies, were found to have HI rotation centers significantly offset from the center of
the bar (Kerr and de Vaucouleurs 1955).
In general, the application of Hubble’s three spiral criteria allows consistent classification
of spiral types. Nevertheless, sometimes the criteria are inconsistent. For example, small-bulge
Sa galaxies are described by Sandage (1961) and Sandage and Bedke (1994). Barred galaxies
with nuclear rings can have spiral arms like those of an earlier Hubble type and very small
bulges. In such conflicting cases, the emphasis is usually placed on the appearance of the arms.
Also, while late-type Sdm and Sm galaxies are characteristically asymmetric, other types may be
asymmetric as well. On average, the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio is related to Hubble type, but
the result is sensitive to how galaxies are decomposed (e.g., Laurikainen et al. 2005). Asymmetry
has been quantified by Conselice (1997).
The family classifications SA, SAB, and SB are purely visual estimates of bar strength for
both spirals and S0s. They are highlighted already in > Figs. 1-7–1-9, but the continuity of this
characteristic is better illustrated in >Fig. 1-10, where de Vaucouleurs (1963) underlined classi-
fications (SAB and SAB) are also shown. An SA galaxy has no evident bar in general, although
high inclination can cause a mistaken SA classification if a bar is highly foreshortened. Also,
internal dust mayobscure a bar (see, e.g., Eskridge et al. 2000). An SB galaxy should have a clear,
well-defined bar. The intermediate bar classification SAB is one of the hallmarks of the de Vau-
couleurs system and is used to recognize galaxies having characteristics intermediate between
barred and nonbarred galaxies. It is used for well-defined ovals or simply weaker-looking nor-
mal bars. The weakest primary bars are denoted SAB while the classification SAB is usually
assigned to more classical bars that appear only somewhat weaker than conventional bars. Most
of the time, galaxies which should be classified as SAB are simply classified as SB.

Variety is also treated as a continuous classification parameter (> Fig. 1-10, second row).
Aspiral galaxyhaving a completelyclosed orverynearlycompletelyclosed innerring is denoted
(r). The spiral arms usually break from the ring. If the spiral arms break directly from the central
region or the ends of a bar, forming a continuously winding, open pattern, the variety is (s). The
intermediate variety (rs) is also well defined. Inner rings which appear broken or partial are in
this category. The “dash-dot-dash in brackets” morphology, (-o-), where a bar with a bulge is
bracketed by spiral arcs overshooting the bar axis, is very typical of variety (rs). The example of
this shown in >Fig. 1-10 is NGC 4548. We use the notation rs to denote an inner ring made up
of tightly wrapped spiral arms that do not quite close, while the notation rs is used for very open,
barely recognizable, inner pseudorings. A good example of the former is NGC 3450, while an
example of the latter is NGC 5371.
A spindle is a highly inclined disk galaxy. For blue-light images, usually an “sp” after the
classification automatically implies considerable uncertainty in the interpretation because fam-
ily and variety are not easily distinguished when the inclination is high. >Figure 1-11 shows,
however, that stages can be judged reasonably reliably for edge-on galaxies. One important
development in the classification of edge-on galaxies has been the ability to recognize edge-on
bars through boxy/peanut and “X” shapes. Boxy/peanut bulges in edge-on galaxies were proven
to be bars seen edge-on from kinematic considerations (e.g., Kuijken and Merrifield 1995). This
shape is evident in NGC 4425 (row 1, column 4 of >Fig. 1-11; see also >Sect. 9).
For spiral and S0 galaxies that are not too highly inclined (i.e., not spindles), once the stage,
family, and variety are determined, these are combined in the order family, variety, stage for
a final full type. For example, NGC 1300 is of the family SB, variety (s), and stage b; thus, its
full type is SB(s)b. The S0+ galaxy NGC 4340 has both a bar and inner ring, and its full type
is SB(r)0+. The classification is flexible enough that if, for example, the family and variety of
a galaxy cannot be reliably determined owing to high inclination, while the stage can still be
assessed, then the symbols can be dropped and a type such as “Sb” or “S0” can still be noted.

5.3 Irregular Galaxies
Magellanic irregular galaxies represent the last normal stage of the de Vaucouleurs revised Hub-
ble sequence. Several examples are shown in >Fig. 1-12. The objects illustrated in the top row
are all examples of (s)-variety irregulars with bars or some trace of a bar. Nevertheless, not all
Magellanic irregulars have bars. Irregulars of the lowest luminosities are usually classified sim-
ply as Im since the sophistication of structure needed to distinguish something like “family”
may not exist for such galaxies.
Irregular galaxies are important for their star formation characteristics. As noted by Hunter
(1997), irregulars are similar to spirals in having both old and young stars, as well as dust,
atomic, molecular, and ionized gas, but lack the spiral structure that might trigger star forma-
tion. Thus, they are useful laboratories for examining how star formation occurs in the absence
of spiral arms.
Although irregulars are largely defined by a lack of well-organized structure like spiral arms,
the two lower right galaxies in >Fig. 1-12 are not so disorganized looking and seem different
from the other cases shown. NGC 5253 looks almost like a tilted S0 galaxy, yet it has no bulge
at its center, nor any obvious lenses. Instead, the central area is an irregular zone of active star
formation. The central zone was interpreted by van den Bergh (1980a) as “fossil evidence” for
a burst of star formation, possibly triggered by an interaction with neighboring M83. This is a
case where the de Vaucouleurs classification of I0 seems reasonable: NGC 5253 is an early-type
galaxy with a central starburst, probably the youngest and closest example known (Vanzi and
Sauvage 2004). It is a Magellanic irregular galaxy imbedded in a smooth S0-like background
known to have an early-type star spectrum. NGC 1705, also shown in >Fig. 1-12, is similar but
has a super star cluster near the center and obvious peculiar filaments. It is classified as a blue
compact dwarf by Gil de Paz et al. (2003). Both galaxies are classified as amorphous by Sandage
and Bedke (1994).

Other Dimensions to Galaxy Morphology
The de Vaucouleurs classification volume recognizes three principal aspects of galaxy morphol-
ogy, but there are many more dimensions than three. Stage, family, and variety are the dimen-
sions most clearly highlighted in blue-light images and have a wide scope. Other dimensions
may be considered, and for some, there is explicit notation in use.
6.1 Outer Rings and Pseudorings
Published de Vaucouleurs types include an extra dimension known as the outerring/pseudoring
classification. Several examples of outer rings and pseudorings are shown in >Fig. 1-13. An
outer ring is a large, often diffuse structure, typically seen in barred early-type galaxies (stages
S0+ to Sa) at a radius approximately twice that of the bar. Closed outer rings are recognized
with the type symbol (R) preceding the main part of the classification. For example, an SB(r)0+
galaxy having an outer ring has a full classification of (R)SB(r)0+. Interestingly, rare cases of
double outer ring galaxies, type (RR), are known, where two detached outer rings are seen; an
example is NGC 2273 shown in the upper right frame of >Fig. 1-13.

22 1
Galaxy Morphology
In later-type galaxies, a large outer ringlike feature is often seen made of outer spiral arms
whose variable pitch angle causes them to close together. These features are classified as outer
pseudorings, symbolized by (R′) preceding the main type symbols (e.g., as in (R′)SB(r)ab).
Outer pseudorings are mainly observed in Sa to Sbc galaxies and are only rarely seen in the
very late stages Sc–Sm.
Among bright nearby galaxies, outer rings and pseudorings are found at about the 10%
level (Buta and Combes 1996). Typically, outer rings are fainter than 24 mag arcsec−in blue
light. With such low surface brightnesses, the rings can be easily lost to Galactic extinction. The
division between outer rings and pseudorings is also not sharp. Some outer pseudorings are
only barely distinguishable from outer rings. Continuity applies to these features as it does for
inner rings although there is no symbol other than “S” for an outer spiral pattern which does
not close into an outer pseudoring.
Although closed outer rings (R) are equally well recognized in the RSA and the Carnegie
and Hubble Atlases, outer pseudorings are a unique feature of the de Vaucouleurs revision. The
value of recognizing these features is that many show morphologies consistent with the the-
oretical expectations of the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR, Schwarz 1981), one of the major
low-order resonances that can play a role in disk evolution. Resonance rings are discussed fur-
ther in >Sect. 10.1, but >Fig. 1-14 shows schematics of the morphologies generally linked to
this resonance. The schematics are designed to highlight the subtle but well-defined aspects of
these features, while >Fig. 1-15 shows images of several examples of each morphology, includ-
ing the “models” used for the schematic. Outer rings of type Rare closed rings that are slightly
dimpled toward the bar axis, a shape which connects directly to one of the main periodic orbit

families near the OLR as shown in Schwarz (1981) and in the dVA. Outer pseudorings of type
R′
are similar to type Rbut are made of two spiral arms that wind approximately 180○with
respect to the ends of the bar. Even these will usually show a dimpled shape. Outer pseudorings
of type R′
are different from this in that two spiral arms wind 270○with respect to the ends of
the bar, such that the arms are doubled in the quadrants immediately trailing the bar.
The shapes R, R′
, and R′
were predicted by Schwarz (1981) based on “sticky-particle”
numerical simulations. Not predicted by those simulations (but later shown in extensions of
those simulations by Byrd et al. 1994 and Rautiainen and Salo 2000) is an interesting combined
ring morphology called RR′
, which consists of a closed Rring and an R′
pseudoring. This
combination is especially important because it demonstrates not only a continuity of morpholo-
gies among outer rings and pseudorings different from the continuity between outer rings and
pseudorings in general, but it is also a morphology that can be linked directly to the dynamics
of barred galaxies.
Note that the classification shown in > Figs. 1-14 and >1-15 does not depend on whether
the rings are in fact linked to the OLR. The illustrated morphologies are abundant and easily
recognized regardless of how they are interpreted. ( > Sect. 10.1 discusses other interpreta-
tions that have been proposed.) Although the Schwarz models guided the search for these

24 1
Galaxy Morphology
morphologies, Rautiainen et al. (2004) and Treuthardt et al. (2008) showed that some outer
pseudorings classified as R′
are more likely related to the outer 4:1 resonance and not the OLR.
These cases are generally recognizable by the presence of secondary spiral arcs in a four-armed
pattern in the area of the bar (NGC 1433 in > Fig. 1-1 and ESO 566−24 in > Fig. 1-19 are
examples).
The OLR subclassifications are used in the same manner as the plain outer ring and
pseudoring classifications. For example, NGC 3081 has the full type (RR′
)SAB(r)0/a.
6.2 Inner and Outer Lenses
The value of recognizing lenses as significant morphological components was first emphasized
by Kormendy (1979), who suggested a dynamical link between inner lenses, which are often
filled by a bar in one dimension, and dissolved or dissolving bars. Kormendy noted that lenses
can be of the inner or outer type in a manner analogous to inner and outer rings. He suggested
the notation (l) for inner lenses and (L) for outer lenses to be used in the same position of the
classification as inner and outer rings. For example, the galaxy NGC 1543 is type (R)SB(l)0/a
while galaxy NGC 2983 is type (L)SB(s)0+. >Figure 1-16 demonstrates the continuity between
rings and lenses, which is evident not only among barred galaxies but among nonbarred ones as
well. This continuity is recognized by the type symbol (rl), also used by Kormendy (1979). This
type refers to a low-contrast inner ring at the edge of a clear lens. Even underlined classifications
(rl) and (rl) may be recognized. A rare classification, (r′l), refers to an inner pseudoring/lens, a
type of feature that is seen in NGC 4314 and recognized as such in the dVA.
Similarly, >Fig. 1-17 shows a continuity between outer rings and outer lenses through the
type classification (RL), referring to an outer lens with a weak ringlike enhancement. Under-
lined types RL and RL may also be recognized. The origin of outer lenses could be in highly
evolved outer rings.
6.3 Nuclear Rings and Bars
The central regions of barred galaxies often include distinct morphological features in the form
of small rings and secondary bars. The rings, known as nuclear rings because of their proximity
to the nucleus well inside the ends of the primary bar, are sites of some of the most spectacular
starbursts known in normal galaxies. The rings are typically ≈1.5 kpc in linear diameter and
intrinsically circular in shape. >Figure 1-18 (top row) shows three examples: NGC 1097, 3351,
and 4314. These images highlight the small bulges that seem characteristic of nuclear-ringed
barred galaxies. The three galaxies illustrated have types ranging from Sa to Sb, but based on
the bulge size, the types would be considerably later. For example, NGC 3351 has the bulge of
an Sd galaxy.
Comerón et al. (2010) carried out an extensive statistical study of nuclear ring radii and
identified a subclass known as “ultracompact” nuclear rings (UCNRs). Such rings were rec-
ognized mainly in Hubble Space Telescope images and are defined to be less than 200 pc in
diameter. (See >Fig. 1-26 for an example in NGC 3177.) Comerón et al. showed that UCNRs are
the low size tail of the global nuclear ring population. This study also showed that bar strength
impacts the sizes of nuclear rings, with stronger bars generally hosting smaller nuclear rings
than weaker bars.

Comerón et al. (2010) were also able to derive a reliable estimate of the relative frequency of
nuclear rings as 20% ± 2% over the type range S0−to Sd, confirming with smaller error bars the
previous result of Knapen (2005). Assuming that nuclear rings are a normal part of galaxy evo-
lution, these authors argue that the rings may survive for 2–3Gyr. Interestingly, it was also found
that 19% ± 4% of nuclear rings occur in nonbarred galaxies, implying either that the rings may
have formed when a bar was stronger (evidence of bar evolution) or that ovals or other mecha-
nisms can lead to their formation. Mazzuca et al. (2009; see also Knapen 2010) connect some of
the properties of nuclear rings to the rate at which the rotation curve rises in the inner regions.

The most extreme nuclear ring known is found in the SBa galaxy ESO 565−11 (see
also >Sect. 7). At 3.5 kpc in diameter, not only is the ring one of the largest known nuclear
rings but also it has an extreme elongated shape compared to more typical nuclear rings.
Nuclear bars lie in the same radial zone as nuclear rings and sometimes lie inside a nuclear
ring. Three examples are shown in the second row of >Fig. 1-18. These average about one-tenth

the size of a primary bar. There is no preferred angle between the axis of the nuclear bar and the
primary bar, suggesting that the two features have different pattern speeds (Buta and Combes
1996; dVA).
Neither nuclear rings nor nuclear bars were recognized in the original Hubble–Sandage–
de Vaucouleurs classifications, presumably in part because the use of small-scale photographic
plates for extensive galaxy classification limited the detectability of the features in the (typically)
overexposed centers. Modern multiband digital imaging greatly facilitates the detection of the
small rings and bars, allowing their inclusion in the classification. Buta and Combes (1996) and
Buta et al. (2010a) suggested the notation nr for nuclear rings and nb4 for nuclear bars, respec-
tively, to be used as part of the variety classification as in, for example, SB(r,nr)b for NGC 3351
or SAB(l,nb)0/a for NGC 1291. Continuity may exist for these features like other rings and pri-
mary bars. (For example, nuclear lenses (nl) may also be recognized.) In blue-light images, the
appearance of the central region of a barred galaxy can be strongly affected by dust. For exam-
ple, NGC 1365 shows a nuclear spiral in blue light, while in the infrared, the morphology is that
of a nuclear ring (Buta et al. 2010a). The morphologies of some galaxies have a full complement
of classifiable features. For example, accounting for all the rings and bars seen in NGC 3081,
the classification is (RR′
)SAB(r,nr,nb)0/a.
Lisker et al. (2006) use the terminology “S2B” for double-barred galaxies, a reasonable
alternative approach to classifying these objects. Lisker et al. successfully identified nuclear
bars in galaxies at redshifts z = 0.10–0.15 (from HST ACS observations), the most distant ones
recognized thus far.
6.4 Spiral Arm Morphologies
A classification such as “Sb” tells one that a galaxy is a spiral of moderate pitch angle and degree
of resolution of the arms and that a significant bulge may be present. The type does not directly
tell (1) the multiplicity of the spiral pattern, (2) the character of the arms (massive, filamentary,
grand design, or flocculent), or (3) the sense of winding of the arms (leading or trailing the
direction of rotation). These are nevertheless additional dimensions to galaxy morphology.
The multiplicity of the spiral pattern refers to the actual number of spiral arms, usually
denoted by the integer m. Examples of spirals having m = 1–5 are illustrated in > Fig. 1-19.
The multiplicity is not necessarily straightforward to determine and may be a function
of radius. For example, a spiral may be two armed in the inner regions and multi-
armed in the outer regions. Spirals of low m are usually grand design, a term referring
to a well-defined global (meaning galaxy-wide) pattern of strong arms. The typical grand-
design spiral has two main arms, as in NGC 5364 (lower left frame of
> Fig. 1-19).
In contrast, a flocculent spiral has piecewise continuous arms but no coherent global pattern
(Elmegreen 1981). NGC 5055 is an example shown in the middle left frame of > Fig. 1-19.
This category is relevant mainly to optical wavebands. In the infrared, an optically flocculent
spiral like NGC 5055 reveals a more coherent global grand-design spiral (Thornley 1996; see
also >Fig. 1-44), indicating that dust is partly responsible for the flocculent appearance.
4In a study of galactic nuclei, van den Bergh (1995) proposed the notation “NB” for nuclear bars, although what
he refers to are not the same as the features described here. However, the presence or absence of a nucleus is
an important morphological issue that may be connected to evolutionary history, as noted by van den Bergh.

4921. All images are B-band from the dVA except NGC 5055, which is SDSS g-band, and NGC 4921,
which is from Hubble Heritage
The terms “massive” and “filamentary” arms are due to Reynolds (1927) and are discussed
by Sandage (1961, 1975). Massive arms are broad, diffuse, and of relatively low contrast, as in
M33, while filamentary arms are relatively thin in comparison and lined by knots or filaments,
as in NGC 5457 (M101). De Vaucouleurs (1956) originally used these distinctions as part of his
classification, but later dropped the references to spiral arm character probably because of the
complexity it added to his types.
Elmegreen and Elmegreen (1987) used a different approach to spiral arm character by
recognizing a series of spiral arm classes based on arm continuity and length (but not nec-
essarily contrast). Ten classes ranging from flocculent (ACs 1–4) to grand design (5–12;
numbers 10 and 11 were later dropped) are illustrated in > Fig. 1-20 (see Elmegreen and
Elmegreen 1987 for a description of each class). Thus, spiral character is a well-developed
additional dimension to galaxy classification. A simpler approach advocated by Elmegreen
and Elmegreen is “G” for grand design, “F” for flocculent, and “M” for multiple armed. The
arms of grand-design spirals are in general thought to be density waves and may in fact rep-
resent quasi-steady wave modes (e.g., Bertin et al. 1989; Zhang 1996, 1998, 1999), although
there is also some evidence that spirals may be transient (see review by Sellwood 2010). Floc-
culent spirals may be sheared self-propagating star formation regions (Seiden and Gerola
1982).
>Figure 1-19 also shows two examples of a new class of spirals, called counterwinding spi-
rals. In these cases, an inner spiral pattern winds outward in the opposite sense to an outer spiral
pattern. In the case of NGC 4622 (row 2, middle), the inner pattern has only a single arm and

All images are B-band from the dVA, except NGC 5055 which is SDSS g-band
the outer pattern has two arms, while in NGC 3124 (row 2, middle right), the inner pattern is
two armed and the outer pattern is at least four armed. The two cases are very different because
NGC 4622 is essentially nonbarred while in NGC 3124, the inner spiral is classified as a bar. The
presence of oppositely winding spiral patterns in the same galaxy means that one set of arms
is trailing (opening opposite the direction of rotation) while the other set is leading (opening
into the direction of rotation). In general, studies of the dust distribution as well as the rota-
tion of spirals have shown that trailing arms are the rule (de Vaucouleurs 1958). Surprisingly,
straightforward analysis of a velocity field and the dust pattern in NGC 4622 led Buta et al.
(2003) to conclude that the strong outer two-armed pattern in this galaxy is leading, while the
inner single arm is trailing. This led to the characterization of NGC 4622 as a “backward spiral
galaxy,” apparently rotating the wrong way. An additional nonbarred counterwinding spiral has
been identified in ESO 297−27 by Grouchy et al. (2008). In this case, the same kind of analysis
showed that an inner single arm leads while a three-armed outer pattern trails. No comparable
analysis has yet been made for NGC 3124.
Väisänen et al. (2008) have shown that a two-armed (but not counterwinding) spiral in the
strongly interacting galaxy IRAS 18293-3413 is leading. Even with this, the number of known
leading spirals is verysmall (dVA). Leading spirals are not expected tobe as long-lived as trailing
spirals since they do not transfer angular momentum outward, and this is needed for the long-
term maintenance of a spiral wave (Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs 1972).
An interesting example of leading “armlets” was described by Knapen et al. (1995a), who
used K-band imaging of the center of the grand-design spiral M100 to reveal details of its
nuclear bar and well-known nuclear ring/spiral. The nuclear bar has a leading twist that con-
nects it to two bright K-band “knots” of star formation. This morphology was interpreted in
terms of the expectations of gas orbits in the vicinity of an inner inner Lindblad resonance
(IILR; Knapen et al. 1995b).

30 1
Galaxy Morphology
The final galaxy in >Fig. 1-19 is NGC 4921, an example of an anemic spiral. This is a type
of spiral that is deficient in neutral atomic hydrogen gas, and, as a consequence, it has a lower
amount of dust and star formation activity. The arms of NGC 4921 resemble those of an Sb
or Sbc galaxy in pitch angle and extensiveness but are as smooth as those typically seen in Sa
galaxies. Anemic spirals were first recognized as galaxies with “fuzzy” arms (see van den Bergh,
1998) where star formation has been suppressed due to ram-pressure stripping in the cluster
environment. In the case of NGC 4921, the environment is the Coma Cluster. The idea is that
such galaxies will eventually turn into S0 galaxies (van den Bergh 2009a). Anemic spiral galaxies
are further discussed in >Sect. 10.2.
Seigar et al. (2008) have demonstrated the existence of a correlation between spiral arm
pitch angles and supermassive central black hole masses. The sense of the correlation is such
that black hole mass is highest for the most tightly wound spirals and lowest for the most open
spirals. The correlation is expected because black hole mass is tightly correlated to bulge mass
and central mass concentration, and spiral arm pitch angle is tied to shear in galactic disks,
which itself depends on mass concentration (Seigar et al. 2005).
6.5 Luminosity Eﬀects
Luminosity effects are evident in the morphology of galaxies through surface brightness dif-
ferences between giants and dwarfs and through the sophistication of structure such as spiral
arms. Van den Bergh (1998) describes his classification system which takes luminosity effects
into account using a set of luminosity classes that are analogous to those used for stars. The
largest, most massive spirals have long and well-developed arms, while less massive spirals have
less well-defined arms.
The nomenclature for the classes parallels that for stars: I (supergiant galaxies), II (bright
giant galaxies), III (giant galaxies), IV (subgiant galaxies) and V (dwarf galaxies). Intermediate
cases I–II, II–III, III–IV, and IV–V, are also recognized.
> Figure 1-21 shows galaxies which van den Bergh (1998) considers primary luminosity
standards of his classification system. The original van den Bergh standards for these classes
were based on the small-scale paper prints of the Palomar Sky Survey. Sandage and Tammann
(1981) adopted the precepts of the van den Bergh classes but revised the standards based on
large-scale plates. In general, luminosity class I galaxies have the longest, most well-developed
arms; luminosity class III galaxies have short, patchy arms extending from the main body; while
luminosity class V galaxies have very low surface brightness and only a hint of spiral structure.
The classes are separated by type in >Fig. 1-21 because among Sb galaxies, few are of lumi-
nosity class III or fainter, while among Sc and later-type galaxies, the full range of luminosity
classes is found. van den Bergh does not use types like Sd or Sm for conventional de Vaucouleurs
late-types but instead uses S−and S+ to denote “early” (smoother) and “late” (more patchy) sub-
giant spirals. Similarly, van den Bergh uses Sb−and Sb+ to denote “early” and “late” Sb spirals,
respectively. (Some of these would be classified as Sab and Sbc by de Vaucouleurs.) Accord-
ing to the standards listed by van den Bergh (1998), an Sb I galaxy is 2–3 mag more luminous
than an Sb III galaxy, while an Sc I galaxy is more than 4 mag more luminous than an S V
galaxy.

The Morphology of Galactic Bars and Ovals
Bars are among the most common morphological features of disk-shaped galaxies. Unlike spi-
ral arms, bars cross the “spiral-S0 divide” in the Hubble sequence and are abundant among
spirals (at the 50–70% level) when both SAB and SB types are considered (de Vaucouleurs
1963; Sellwood and Wilkinson 1993). The bar fraction has cosmological significance (Sheth
et al. 2008), and many estimates of the nearby galaxy bar fraction have been made from both
optical and IR studies (see Buta et al. 2010a for a summary of recent work). Comerón et al.
(2010) have argued that mass-limited samples provide the most reliable assessmentof the struc-
tural evolution of bars over intermediate redshifts and showed that intermediate mass galaxies
(10.< M/M⊙< 10) continue their bar evolution to z ≈0.2, while high-mass disk galaxies
(M/M⊙> ) reached a mature state (constant bar fraction with redshift) by z ≈1.
Bars are fairly well-understood features of galaxy morphology that have been tied to a nat-
ural instability in a rotationally supported stellar disk (see review by Sellwood and Wilkinson
1993). The long-term maintenance of a bar in a mostly isolated galaxy is thought to depend
on how effectively it transfers angular momentum to other galaxy components, such as the
halo (Athanassoula 2003). Bars are thought to be transient features that, in spiral galaxies,

32 1
Galaxy Morphology
may dissolve and regenerate several times over a Hubble time (Bournaud and Combes 2002).
Alternatively, bars may be long-lived density wave modes that drive secular evolution of both
the stellar and gaseous distributions (Zhang and Buta 2007; Buta and Zhang 2009). The possible
secular evolution of bars in S0 galaxies is discussed by Buta et al. (2010b). Bars are also thought
to drive spiral density waves (Kormendy and Norman 1979; Buta et al. 2009; Salo et al. 2010).
The actual morphology of bars shows interesting variations that merit further study. The
family classifications SAB and SB indicate some measure of bar strength but do not allude to the
varied appearances of bars even among those only classified as SB. Regular bars, such as those
illustrated in >Fig. 1-8, are the conventional types that define the SB class. >Figure 1-22 shows
“ansae”-type bars, referring to bars which have “handles” or bright enhancements at the ends.
Martinez-Valpuesta et al. (2007) carried out a statistical study and found that ansae are present
in ≈40% of early-type barred galaxies and are very rare for types later than stage Sb. Ansae are
usually detectable in direct images, but their visibility can be enhanced using unsharp-masking
(all the right frames for each galaxy in >Fig. 1-22). Morphologically, ansae may be small round
enhancements like those seen in NGC 5375 and 7020, but in some cases, ansae are approx-
imately linear enhancements, giving the bar a parallelogram appearance as in NGC 7098, or
⊡Fig. 1-22

4151 (OSUBSGS H, irregular ansae)

Galaxy Morphology 1
33
curved arcs, giving the bar a partial ring appearance as in NGC 1079. Color index maps in the
dVA show that ansae are generally as red as the rest of the bar, indicating the features are stel-
lar dynamical in origin rather than gas dynamical. Nevertheless, ansae made of star-forming
regions are known. Martinez-Valpuesta et al. (2007) illustrate the case of NGC 4151, a well-
known Seyfert 1 galaxy with a strong bar-like inner oval. The appearance of this galaxy’s ansae
in the 1.65 µm H-band is shown in the lower right frames of >Fig. 1-22, where the ansae are
seen to have irregular shapes compared to the others shown.
Another subtlety about bars is their general boxy character. Athanassoula et al. (1990)
showed that generalized ellipses fit the projected isophotes of bars better than do normal
ellipses. For 11 or 12 SB0 galaxies examined in this study, a significant degree of boxiness was
found near the bar semimajor axis radius.
The unsharp-masked image of NGC 7020 in >Fig. 1-22 shows an X-shaped pattern in the
inner regions that is the likely signature of a significantly three-dimensional bar. NGC 1079
and 5375 show hints of similar structure. The X-pattern is expected to be especially evident in
edge-on galaxies which show the extended vertical structure of bars. Many examples have been
analyzed (Bureau et al. 2006; see also the dVA). Buta et al. (2010a) have suggested that edge-on
bars recognized from the X-pattern be denoted “SBx.”
The cause of bar ansae is uncertain. In simulations, Martinez-Valpuesta et al. (2006)
found that ansae form late, after a second bar-buckling episode in a disk model with a live
axisymmetric halo, and appear as density enhancements in both the face-on and edge-on views.
>Figure 1-23 shows three examples of galaxies having oval inner disks. These features are
described in detail by Kormendy and Kennicutt (2004) [KK04], who present both photometric
and kinematic criteria for recognizing them. The images in > Fig. 1-23 are optical and have
been cleaned of foreground and background objects and have also been deprojected based on
the mean shape and major axis position angle of faint outer isophotes. In all three cases, the
presence of an outer ring allows clear recognition of the oval shape, assuming that the inner and
outer structures are in the same plane. The upper panels of >Fig. 1-23 show the full morphology
with the outer rings, while the lower panels show the bright oval inner disks. The shapes of the
oval disks are varied and range from axis ratio 0.84 for NGC 4736 to 0.55 for NGC 1808. The
most striking example is NGC 4941, whose oval disk includes a bright, normal-looking spiral
pattern with isophotal axis ratio 0.68. Many other examples are provided by KK04.
The ovals appear to play a bar-like role in these galaxies. The outer rings may be resonant
responses to the nonaxisymmetric potential of the ovals, which clearly harbor a great deal of
mass in spite of the mildness of their departures from axisymmetry. As noted by KK04, oval disk
galaxies are expected toevolve secularlyin much the same manneras typical barred galaxies. On
the other hand, ovals themselves could be products of bar secular evolution. Laurikainen et al.
(2009) found that the near-IR bar fraction in S0 galaxies is significantly less than that in S0/a or
early-type spiral galaxies (also found by Aguerri et al. 2009 in the optical), while the oval/lens
fraction is higher, suggesting that some ovals/lenses might be dissolved bars. Further evidence
that bars might be dissolving in some galaxies is the detection of extremelyweak bars in residual
images of visually nonbarred S0 galaxies where a two-dimensional decomposition model has
been subtracted. Such a bar is detected in the SA0○galaxy NGC 3998 (Laurikainen et al. 2009).
Aguerri et al. (2009) suggest that central concentration is a key factor in bar evolution and that
a unimodal distribution of bar strengths argues against the idea that bars dissolve and reform
(Bournaud and Combes 2002).
Regular barred galaxies also often include an oval bounded by an elongated inner ring. The
deprojected blue-light images of two examples are shown in >Fig. 1-24. NGC 1433 has a very
strong normal bar and one of the most intrinsically elongatedinner rings known. The inner ring

lies at the edge of an oval which is more conspicuous at longer wavelengths. In NGC 1433, the
inner ring, the oval, and the bar are all aligned parallel to each other. The situation is different
in ESO 565−11, whose bright oval is strongly misaligned with a prominent bar, but similar to
NGC 1433, the oval is bounded by an inner pseudoring. The suggestion in this case is that the
bar and the oval are independent patterns.

Dust Morphologies
Dust lanes are often the most prominent part of the interstellarmedium detectable in an optical
image of a galaxy. >Figure 1-25 shows different classes of dust lanes using direct optical images
on the left for each galaxy and a color index map on the right. The color index maps are coded
such that blue features are dark while red features (like dust lanes) are light.

Galaxy Morphology
The bars of intermediate (mainly Sab to Sbc) spirals often show leading dust lanes, that is,
well-defined lanes that lie on the leading edges of the bars, assuming the spiral arms trail. The
example shown in >Fig. 1-25, NGC 1530, has an exceptionally strong bar, and the lanes are
very straight, regular, and well defined. These dust lanes are a dynamical effect associated with
the bar. The lanes may be curved or straight. Athanassoula (1992) derived models of bar dust
lanes and tied the curvature to the strength of the bar in the sense that models with stronger
bars developed straighter dust lanes. Comerón et al. (2009) recently tested this idea by measur-
ing the curvature of actual dust lanes as well as quantitative values of the bar strengths for 55
galaxies. They found that strong bars can only have straight dust lanes, while weaker bars can
have straight or curved lanes.
In the same manner as bars, a strong spiral often has dust lanes on the concave sides of the
inner arms. This is shown for NGC 1566 in the upper right panels of >Fig. 1-25. Both bar and
spiral dust lanes are face-on patterns. Another type of face-on pattern is the dust ring. The inner
dust ring of NGC 7217 is shown in the right middle frames of >Fig. 1-25, and it appears as the
dark, inner edge of a stellar ring having the same shape. Dust rings can also be detected in more
inclined galaxies.
An inclined galaxy with a significant bulge also can show another dust effect: in such a
case, the bulge is viewed through the dust layer on the near side of the disk, while the dust is
viewed through the bulge on the far side of the disk. This leads to a reddening and extinction
asymmetry across the minor axis such that the near side of the minor axis is more reddened
and extinguished than the far side. In conjunction with rotation data, this near-side/far-side
asymmetry was used by Hubble (1943) and de Vaucouleurs (1958) to show that most spirals
trail the direction of rotation.
The lower frames of >Fig. 1-25 show the planar dust lanes seen in edge-on spiral galaxies.
The lane in NGC 7814 (lower left frames) is red which indicates that the galaxy is probably no
later in type than Sa. This is consistent with the large bulge seen in the galaxy. However, the
planar dust lane seen in NGC 891, type Sb, has a thin blue section in the middle of a wider red
section. The blue color is likely due to outer star formation that suffers relatively low extinction.
Some individual star-forming regions can be seen along the dust lane. In spite of the blue color,
we are only seeing the outer edge of the disk in the plane.
Also related to galactic dust distributions are observations of occulting galaxy pairs, where
a foreground spiral galaxy partly occults a background galaxy, ideally an elliptical (White and
Keel 1992). With such pairs, one can estimate the optical depth of the foreground dust, often in
areas where it might not be seen easily in an isolated spiral. An excellent example is described
by Holwerda et al. (2009), who are able to trace the dust distribution in an occulting galaxy to
1.5 times than the standard isophotal radius.
Another way of illustrating the dust distribution in galaxies is with Spitzer Space Tele-
scope Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) images at 8.0 µm wavelength. This is discussed further
in >Sect. 12.

The Morphologies of Galactic Bulges
A bulge is a very important component of a disk galaxy. In the context of structure formation in
a cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology, bulges may form by hierarchical merging of disk galaxies,
a process thought to lead to elliptical galaxies if the disks have approximatelyequal mass. Bulges

Galaxy Morphology 1
37
formed in this wayshould, then, resemble elliptical galaxies, especiallyforearly-type spirals. The
bulges of later-type spirals, however, can be very different from the expectations of a merger-
built bulge (also known as a “classical” bulge). In many cases, the bulge appears to be made of
material associated with the disk.
KK04 reviewed the concept of “pseudobulges,” referring to galaxy bulges that may have
formed by slow secular movement of disk gas to the central regions (also known as disklike
bulges; Athanassoula 2005). The main driving agent for movement of the gas is thought to
be bars, which are widespread among spiral galaxies and which exert gravity torques that can
move material byredistributing the angularmomentum. Inside the corotation resonance, where
the bar pattern speed equals the disk rotation rate, gas may be driven into the center to provide
the raw material for building up a pseudobulge. KK04 review the evidence for such processes
and argue that pseudobulges are a strong indication that secular evolution is an important
process in disk-shaped galaxies.
>Figure 1-26 shows the morphologies of both classical bulges and pseudobulges. The four
classical bulge galaxies shown in the lower row, M31, NGC 2841, M81, and M104, have bright
smooth centers and no evidence of bulge spiral structure or star formation. Classical bulges also
tend to have rounder shapes than disks and can have significant bulge-to-total-luminosity ratios
as illustrated by M104. Classical bulges are also more supported by random motions than by
rotation. Many references to classical bulge studies are given by KK04. Formation mechanisms
of such bulges are discussed in detail by Athanassoula (2005).
The two upper rows of >Fig. 1-26 are all pseudobulges as recognized by KK04. The first row
shows HST wide V-band (filter F606W) images of the inner 1–1.3 kpc of four galaxies, NGC
3177, 4030, 5377, and 1353, in the type range Sa–Sbc. The areas shown account for much of the
rise in surface brightness above the inward extrapolation of the outer disk light in these galaxies
and would be considered bulges just on this basis. The HST images show, however, considerable
spiral structure, dust, small rings, and likely star formation in these regions, characteristics not
expected for a classical bulge. KK04 argue that instead these are pseudobulges that are highly
flattened, have a projected shape similar to the outer disk light, have approximately exponential
brightness profiles (Sersic index n ≈1–2), and have a high ratio of ordered rotation to random
motions. KK04 argue that a low Sersic index compared to n = 4 appears to be the hallmark of
these pseudobulges, and a signature of secular evolution.
The second row in >Fig. 1-26 shows other kinds of pseudobulges discussed by KK04. NGC
6782 and 3081 (two left frames) have secondary bars, and KK04 considered that such features
indicate the presence of a pseudobulge because bars are always disk features. In each case, the
secondary bar lies inside a nuclear ring.
The other two galaxies in the second row of > Fig. 1-26, NGC 128 and 1381, are exam-
ples of boxy or box-peanut bulges. These features have been linked to the vertical heating of
bars, and if this is what they actually are, then KK04 argue that boxy and box-peanut bulges are
also examples of pseudobulges. However, boxy and box/peanut bulges would not necessarily be
the result of slow movement of gas by bar torques and subsequent star formation in the cen-
tral regions but instead would be related to the orbital structure of the bar itself (Athanassoula
2005).
Recent studies have shown that pseudobulges are the dominant type of central compo-
nent in disk galaxies. Although originally thought to be important only for late-type galax-
ies, Laurikainen et al. (2007) showed that pseudobulges are found throughout the Hubble
sequence, including among S0-S0/a galaxies, based on sophisticated two-dimensional photo-
metric decompositions. Such galaxies frequently have nuclear bars, nuclear disks, or nuclear

rings. Laurikainen et al. also found that bulge-to-total-flux (B/T) ratios are much less than
indicated by earlier studies, especially for early Hubble types, and that the Sersic index aver-
ages ≲2 across all types. The lack of gas in S0 and S0/a galaxies complicates the interpreta-
tion of their pseudobulges in terms of bar-driven gas flow and subsequent star formation.
Instead, Laurikainen et al. link the pseudobulges in early-type galaxies to the evolution of bars.
Laurikainen et al. (2010) also showed that S0s can have pseudobulges if they are stripped spirals,
without invoking any bar-induced evolution.
Kormendy et al. (2010) showed that a significant fraction of large late-type disk galaxies in
noncluster environments have no trace of a classical, merger-driven bulge. Some galaxies, like
M33, may not even have a pseudobulge. Kormendy et al. note that the existence of so many
massive pure disk galaxies challenges cold dark matter cosmology; they state: “In field environ-
ments, the problem of forming giant pure-disk galaxies in a hierarchically clustering universe
is acute.”

Eﬀects of Interactions and Mergers
Galaxy morphology is replete with evidence for gravitational interactions, ranging from minor,
distant encounters to violent collisions and major/minor mergers. Many of the most puzzling
and exotic morphologies can be explained by interactions, and even sublimely normal galaxies,
like ordinary ellipticals, have been connected to catastrophic encounters. Up to 4% of bright
nearby galaxies are involved in a major interaction (Knapen and James 2009). In clusters, other
types of interactions may occur, such as gas stripping and truncation of the star-forming disk.
In this section, a variety of the types of morphologies that may be considered the results of
external interactions are described and illustrated.
10.1 Normal Versus Catastrophic Rings
The three types of rings described so far, nuclear, inner, and outer rings, are aspects of the mor-
phology of relatively normal, undisturbed galaxies. Inner rings and pseudorings are found in
more than 50% of normal disk galaxies (Buta and Combes 1996), while outer rings and pseudor-
ings are found at the 10% level. The latter rings could be more frequent because their faintness
may cause them to go undetected, which is less likely to occur for inner rings. As has been
noted, nuclear rings are found at the 20% level (Comerón et al. 2010). The high abundance of
these types of ring features suggests that they are mainly products of internal dynamics, and in
fact all three ring types have been interpreted in terms of internal processes in barred galaxies.
The main interpretation of these kinds of rings has been in terms of orbital resonances with the
pattern speed of a bar, oval, or spiral density wave. Resonances are special places where a bar can
secularly gather gas owing to the properties of periodic orbits (Buta and Combes 1996). Buta
(1995) showed that the intrinsic shapes and relative bar orientations of inner and outer rings
and pseudorings support the resonance interpretation of the features. Schwarz (1981) suggested
the outer Lindblad resonance for outer rings and pseudorings, while Schwarz (1984) suggested
the inner 4:1 ultraharmonic resonance for inner rings and pseudorings and the inner Lindblad
resonance for nuclear rings. Knapen et al. (1995b) and Buta and Combes (1996) provide further
insight into these interpretations.
The resonance idea may only be valid in the case of weak perturbations. In the presence
of a strong perturbation, the concept of a specific resonance radius can break down, although
the idea of a broad resonance region could still hold (Contopoulos 1996). Regan and Teuben
(2003, 2004) argue that nuclear rings and inner rings are better interpreted in terms of orbit
transitions, that is, regions where periodic orbits transition from one major orbit family to
another, as in the transition from the perpendicularly aligned xfamily to the bar-aligned x
family (Contopoulos and Grosbol 1989).
Normal rings have also been interpreted in terms of “invariant manifolds” which emanate
from the unstable Land LLagrangian points in the bar potential (Romero-Gómez et al.
2006, 2007; Athanassoula et al. 2009a, b). This approach has also had some success in predicting
the shapes and orientations of inner and outer rings, such as the R, R′
, RR′
, and R′
morpholo-
gies shown in > Figs. 1-14 and >1-15. A morphology called “rR,” which includes an oval inner
ring and a figure eight-shaped Rring (see NGC 1326 in >Fig. 1-15), is especially well repre-
sented by this kind of model. The manifolds are tubes which guide orbits escaping the Land
Lregions. Note that in this interpretation, outer rings are not necessarily associated with the
OLR (Romero-Gómez et al. 2006).

ESO 235−58, and NGC 660; Column 4 – Arp147, the Cartwheel, and the Lindsay-Shapley ring. All
images are from the dVA except Arp 147, which is Hubble Heritage
Although the vast majority of the ringlike patterns seen in galaxies are probably of the
resonance/orbit-transition/invariant-manifold type, other classes of rings are known that are
likely the result of more catastrophic processes, such as galaxy collisions. >Figure 1-27 shows
resonance rings in comparison to three other types: accretion rings, polar rings, and collisional
rings (the latter commonly referred to as “ring galaxies”). The three accretion rings shown in
Hoag’s Object (Schweizer et al. 1987), IC 2006 (Schweizer et al. 1989), and NGC 7742 (de Zeeuw
et al. 2002) are thought to be made of material from an accreted satellite galaxy. For IC 2006
and NGC 7742, the evidence for this is found in counterrotation: the material in the rings coun-
terrotates with respect to the material in the rest of the galaxies. In Hoag’s Object and IC 2006,
the accreting galaxy is a normal E system.
Polar rings are also accreted features except that the accreting galaxy is usually a disk-shaped
system, most often an S0 (Whitmore et al. 1990). In these cases, the accreted material comes in
at a high angle to the plane of the disk. The configuration is most stable if the accretion angle is
close to 90○or over the poles of the disk system. This limits the ability of differential precession
to cause the ring material to quickly settle into the main disk. The polar feature can be a ring or
simply an inclined and extended disk. Whitmore et al. (1990) present an extensive catalogue of
probable and possible polar ring galaxies.
The main example illustrated in >Fig. 1-27 is NGC 4650A, where the inner disk component
is an S0. Galaxies like NGC 4650A have generated considerable research because polar rings

Galaxy Morphology 1
41
probe the shape of the dark halo potential (e.g., Sackett et al. 1994). The galaxies are also special
because the merging objects have retained their distinct identities when most mergers lead to a
single object. Brook et al. (2008) link the misaligned disks of polar ring galaxies to the process
of hierarchical structure formation in a cold dark matter scenario.
While polar rings are most easily recognizable when both disks are nearly edge-on to us,
cases where one or the other disk is nearly face-on have also been recognized. One example,
ESO 235−58 (Buta and Crocker 1993) is shown in the middle-right panel of >Fig. 1-27. In this
case, the inner component is almost exactly edge-on and shows a planar dust lane and is likely
a spiral rather than an S0. The ring component is inclined significantly to the plane of this inner
disk but may not be polar. The faint outer arms in this component caused ESO 235−58 to be
misclassified as a late-type barred spiral in RC3. Spiral structure in polar disks has been shown
to be excitable by the potential of the inner disk, which acts something like a bar (Theis et al.
2006).
An example where the main disk is seen nearly face-on is NGC 2655 (Sparke et al. 2008). In
this case, the polar ring material is seen as silhouetted dust lanes at an uncharacteristic angle to
the inner isophotes. NGC 2655 also shows evidence of faint shells/ripples, indicative of a recent
merger ( >Sect. 10.3.3). Sil’chenko and Afanasiev (2004) have discussed NGC 2655 and other
similar examples of inner polar rings in terms of the triaxiality of the potential.
Also illustrated in >Fig. 1-27 is NGC 660, which was listed as a possible polar ring galaxy
by Whitmore et al. (1990). Like ESO 235−58, NGC 660 has an aligned dust lane in its inner
disk component, which thus is likely to be a spiral, not an S0. The extraplanar disk is actually
far from polar, being inclined only 55○(van Driel et al. 1995). A recent study of massive stars
in the ring is given by Karataeva et al. (2004).
Collisional ring galaxies (Arp 1966; Appleton and Struck-Marcell 1996) are thought to be
cases where a larger galaxy suffers a head-on collision with a smaller galaxy down its polar axis.
The collision causes an expanding density wave of massive star formation, and multiple rings
are possible. Three examples are shown in >Fig. 1-27. Theys and Spiegel (1976) have discussed
various classes of ring galaxies. Arp 147 (Arp 1966) is an example of type “RE,” referring to
a sharp elliptical ring with an empty interior. The Cartwheel (Higdon 1995) and the Lindsay-
Shapley ring (Arp and Madore 1987) are examples of type “RN,” meaning an elliptical ring with
an off-center nucleus. Not shown in >Fig. 1-27 is a third category called “RK,” where a single,
large knot lies on one side of the ring, making the system very asymmetric.
Madore et al. (2009) have published a comprehensive atlas of all known likely collisional
ring galaxies, many taken from the catalogue of Arp and Madore (1987). Based on this study,
only 1 in 1,000 galaxies is a collisional ring galaxy. For entry, the Madore et al. atlas requires at
least twoobjects in the immediate vicinityofthe ring that might plausiblybe the intrudergalaxy.
Most of the rings are not in cluster environments, however. The atlas also brings attention to
several double-ring collisional systems, which have been predicted by numerical simulations
(see Struck 2010 for a review). The unusual radial “spokes” in the Cartwheel, a feature not seen
in any other collisional ring galaxy, could be related to interactive accretion streams (Struck
et al. 1996).
Romano et al. (2008) present images of several ring galaxies that show the precollision stellar
disk. They also show that rings are generally delineated by blue knots and that the off-centered
nuclei are usually more yellow in color. In addition, some of the companion galaxies show
diffuse asymmetric outer light, suggesting that they are being stripped.
>Figure 1-27 shows that accretion rings can account for some of the rings seen in nonbarred
galaxies. Buta and Combes (1996) argue that a bar is an essential element in resonance ring

formation. ESO 235−58 shows that a polar ring-related system can resemble a ringed, barred
galaxy. The three collisional rings are all very distinctive from the others.
10.2 Environmental Eﬀects on Star-Forming Disks
Galaxy clusters are excellent laboratories for detecting the effects of environment on galaxy
morphology and structure. Frequent mergers and environmental conversion of spirals into S0s
are thought to be at the heart of the morphology-density relation, where early-type galaxies
dominate clustercores, and spirals and irregulars are found mainlyin the outerregions (Dressler
1980; van der Wel et al. 2010). More detailed discussion of environmental effects on galaxies is
given in
>Chap. 3 of this Volume.
The issue ofenvironmental effects has a direct bearing on how we might interpret the Hubble
sequence. For example, the continuity of galaxy morphology certainly seems apparent from the
discussions in previous sections of this review. The Hubble sequence E-S0-Sa-Sb-Sc-I appears
physically significant when total colors, mean surface brightnesses, and HI mass-to-blue-light
ratios are considered, and the way features are recognized in the classification systems also
favors the continuity. Morphological continuity does not, however, automatically imply that the
galaxy types are in fact ordered correctly. For example, although Hubble placed S0s as a transi-
tion type between elliptical galaxies and spirals, this placement has been questioned by van den
Bergh (1998, 2009a). Based on a statistical analysis of types given in the RSA, van den Bergh
showed that S0 galaxies are typically 0.8–1.0 mag less luminous than E and Sa galaxies, imply-
ing that S0 galaxies, on the whole, cannot really be considered intermediate between E and Sa
galaxies.5 The preponderance of S0 galaxies in clusters led to the early suggestion (e.g., Spitzer
and Baade 1951; Gunn and Gott 1972; Moore et al. 1996) that some type of external environ-
mental interaction was responsible for stripping a spiral galaxy of its interstellarmedium. If this
actually occurred, then, as suggested by van den Bergh (2009a), this could imply that S0 galaxies
have lost a substantial fraction of their spiral mass due to interactions. Alternatively, van den
Bergh (2009b) argues that stripping of a lower luminosity, late-type spiral should be easier than
stripping of a higher luminosity, early-type spiral, which could also account for the luminosity
difference. In an examination of the environment of S0 galaxies, van den Bergh (2009b) found
no significant difference in the average luminosities, flattenings, or distribution of S0 subtypes
in clusters, groups, or the field, indicating that some S0s develop as a result of internal effects,
such as the influence of an active galactic nucleus.
Barway et al. (2011) noted that lower luminosity S0s have a higher bar fraction than higher
luminosity S0s (21% vs. 6%), suggesting that the two groups form in different ways (see also
Barway et al. 2007). These authors suggest that faint S0s are stripped late-type spirals, which
are known to have a high bar fraction (Barazza et al. 2008). However, Barway et al. applied no
inclination restriction on their sample.
Environmental effects in clusters do not always have to involve drastic transformations in
morphology. Sometimes the effects are more subtle. >Figure 1-28 shows several spiral galaxies
that are also members of the Virgo Cluster. These galaxies highlight processes that affect the
star-forming disk while leaving the older stellar disk relatively unaffected. NGC 4580 and 4689
5In contrast to van den Bergh’s study of RSA S0 galaxies, Laurikainen et al. (2010) found that the absolute
Ks-band magnitudes of a well-defined sample of S0s are similar to those of early-type spirals in the OSUBSGS
sample. The sample was mostly drawn from RC3 and includes some galaxies classified as ellipticals in RC3 and
as S0s in the RSA (see >Sect. 12).

are galaxies having a patchy inner disk and a smooth outer disk, called “Virgo types” by van den
Bergh et al. (1990). These objects suggest that the environment of such galaxies has somehow
truncated the star-forming disk, with a greater concentration of truncated disks toward the
cluster core. Similar results are obtained from observations of the HI gas disks of Virgo Cluster
galaxies (e.g., Giovanelli and Haynes 1985; Cayatte et al. 1994; Chung et al. 2009).
Koopmann and Kenney (2004) summarize the results of an extensive survey of Hα emis-
sion from Virgo Cluster galaxies and identify different categories of environmentally influenced
star formation characteristics based on Hα imaging. The blue-light images of examples of each
category are included in >Fig. 1-28 and show how the subtleties are manifested in regular mor-
phology. Using a sample ofisolated spiral galaxies todefine “normal” starformation, Koopmann
and Kenney defined several categories of Virgo spiral galaxy star-forming disks: Category “N”
refers to disks whose star formation is within a factor of 3 of the normal levels. “E” cases have
star formation enhanced by more than a factor of 3 compared to normal. “A” cases are “ane-
mic” spirals ( >Sect. 6.4) having star formation reduced by more than a factor of 3 compared
to normal. “T/N” refers to galaxies where the star-forming disk is sharply cut off, but inside the
cutoff, the star formation levels are normal (the [s] means truncation is severe). One of these,
NGC 4580, is so unusual that Sandage and Bedke (1994) classify it as Sc(s)/Sa, where the Sc part
is the inner disk and the Sa part is the outer disk. In “T/A galaxies,” the inner star formation is
at a low level, as in anemic cases, while in “T/C” galaxies, most of the star formation is confined
within the inner 1 kpc. Koopmann and Kenney found that the majority of Virgo Cluster spiral
galaxies have truncated star-forming disks.

44 1
Galaxy Morphology
The idea is that the interstellar medium (ISM) of a cluster galaxy can interact with the intr-
acluster medium (ICM), stripping the ISM (via ram pressure; Gunn and Gott 1972) but leaving
the stellar disk intact. Truncated gas and star-forming disks result because ram-pressure strip-
ping is more severe in the outer parts of galaxies (e.g., Book and Benson 2010 and references
therein). In Virgo, most galaxies with truncated star-forming disks have relatively undisturbed
stellar disks and normal to slightly enhanced inner disk star formation rates, suggesting that
ICM-ISM stripping is the main mechanism in the reduction of their star formation rates. The
cases found to have relatively normal or enhanced star formation rates are preferentially located
in the outer parts of the cluster and likely have never visited the core region. Only galaxies
which go near the center get significantly stripped. However, tidal effects also contribute to
morphological changes. Several galaxies, including many of the T/C class, display peculiari-
ties consistent with tidal effects, such as nonaxisymmetric circumnuclear star formation, shell
features (e.g., NGC 4424 in >Fig. 1-28), and enhanced inner star formation rates.
A recent study by Yagi et al. (2010) provides dramatic and clear evidence of disk gas strip-
ping in galaxies thought to be relatively new arrivals to the core region of the Coma Cluster.
Using deep Hα imaging, these authors detected ionized gas in clouds that are mostly outside
the main disk of a dozen Coma galaxies. Three distinct morphologies of the distributions of
these clouds were found: (1) connected clouds that blend with disk star formation; (2) long,
connected lines of clouds that extend from a central gas knot but are not related to the disk
light; and (3) clouds completely detached from the main disk. Examples of these categories are
illustrated in >Fig. 1-29. Yagi et al. interpret them in terms of an evolutionary gas-stripping
sequence where category (1) galaxies are in an earlier phase of stripping while the category (3)
galaxies are in the most advanced phase. It is likely that large disk galaxies in Coma would be
completely stripped eventually because of the cluster’s high ICM density and broad velocity dis-
tribution. The same process seen in Coma likely occurs in Virgo but is only partial for the large
spirals owing to the lower ICM density and velocities in Virgo (Koopmann and Kenney 2004).
10.3 Interacting and Peculiar Galaxies
10.3.1 Tidal Tails, Arms, Bridges, and Streams
It is perhaps fitting that the first major spiral galaxy discovered was in the interacting pair
M51 (>Sect. 2). Numerical simulations (Salo and Laurikainen 2000a, b) have shown that both
parabolicand bound passages ofthe companion, NGC5195, can explain the observed morphol-
ogy and other characteristics of the system. It turns out that M51 defines a class of interacting
systems known as M51-type pairs. >Figure 1-30 shows an example in the pair NGC 2535-6. In
each case, the larger component has a strong two-armed spiral, with one arm appearing “drawn”
to the smaller companion. An extensive catalogue of M51-type pairs is provided by Jokimaki
et al. (2008).
Other distant encounters can produce tidal tails or bridges of material between galaxies
(top row, >Fig. 1-30). NGC 4676, also known as the “Mice,” is a pair of strongly interacting
galaxies where a very extended tidal tail has formed in one component. The strongly interacting
pair NGC 5216/18 has developed a bright connecting bridge of material, and each component
shows tidal tails. The evolution of this system, and the role of encounters on bar formation, is
described by Cullen et al. (2007).

while the right frames are net Hα images in linear intensity units (called NB−R by Yagi et al.). From
top to bottom, the galaxies are GMP 3816, GMP 2910, and GMP 2923. The idea is that GMP 3816 is
in an earlier phase of stripping, such that there is still considerable disk ionized gas; GMP 2910 is
in a more advanced phase with still connected clouds but an absence of disk emission; and ﬁnally
GMP 2923 is in the most advanced phase of the three, showing only scattered HII regions
Recent extremely deep imaging of otherwise well-known nearby normal disk galaxies has
revealed the presence of enormous tidal streams of faint light in the halos of the galaxies. One
of the best-known cases, NGC 5907, was shown by Martínez-Delgado et al. (2008) to have a
spectacular set of large, arcing loops at high angle to the disk plane, attributed to tidal dis-
ruption of a single small satellite galaxy in a near-circular orbit accretion event. The arcs are
thought to be Gyr old and are analogous to the Galactic Sagittarius stream. A pilot survey of
other galaxies (Martínez-Delgado et al. 2010) has revealed a variety of faint features attributable

to accretion events, including giant plumes, spikes, and umbrella-like structures, the latter cat-
egories attributed to low-mass satellites accreted in more radial orbits. Tidal streams can be
thought of as evidence for hierarchical formation, whereby stellar halos are built up from the
debris of small satellite mergers (Λ Cold Dark Matter cosmology; e.g., Steinmetz and Navarro
2002).
10.3.2 Dust-Lane Ellipticals
>Figure 1-30 also shows several examples of morphologies that may result from minor merg-
ers of a small galaxy with a more massive, pre-existing elliptical galaxy. Bertola (1987) brought
attention to the unusual class of dust-lane ellipticals,where an otherwise normal elliptical galaxy
shows peculiarlanes ofobscuring dust. It was de Vaucouleurs’s personal view that “ifan elliptical
shows dust, then it’s not an elliptical!” However, Bertola showed that an unusual case like the
radio elliptical galaxy NGC 5128, where a strong dust lane lies along the minor axis of the outer
light distribution, is simply the nearest example of a distinct class of objects. Further study
showed that dust-lane ellipticals come in several varieties. The minoraxis dust-lane type appears
most common, but cases of alignment along the major axis of the outer isophotes (major
axis dust lanes) as well as cases of misalignment are also known (see the upper left panels
of >Fig. 1-30). The origin of these very regular dust lanes is thought to be a merger of a gas-
rich companion (e.g., Oosterloo et al. 2002). The regularity of the dust lanes suggests that the
mergers are in advanced states.
10.3.3 Shell/Ripple Galaxies
The two lower left frames of >Fig. 1-30 show examples of galaxies having “shells,” or faint, arc-
shaped brightness enhancements of varying morphology. They were first discovered on deep

Galaxy Morphology 1
47
photographs by Malin (Malin and Carter 1980) and appeared to be associated mainly with
elliptical galaxies. In fact, the first examples, NGC 1344 and 3923, are classified in catalogues
as ordinary ellipticals because the shells are not detectable on photographs of average depth.
Once the class was recognized, a detailed search led to other examples which were listed by
Malin and Carter (1980, 1983). The term “shells” implies a particular three-dimensional geom-
etry that Schweizer and Seitzer (1988) argued imposes a prejudice on the interpretation of the
structures. They proposed instead the alternate term “ripples,” which implies less of a restrictive
geometry.
The explanation of shell/ripple galaxies is one of the great success stories in galactic dynam-
ics (see review by Athanassoula and Bosma 1985). Shells are thought to be remnants of a minor
merger between a massive elliptical and a lower mass disklike galaxy. The main requirements
are that the disk-shaped galaxy be “cold,” or lack any random motions, and that the potential
of the elliptical galaxy should be rigid, meaning the elliptical is much more massive than its
companion. The smaller galaxy’s stars fall into the center of the galaxy and phase wrap or form
alternating outward-moving density waves made of the disk galaxy’s particles near the maxi-
mum excursions of their largely radial orbits in the rigid potential. Many, but not all, of the main
properties of shell Es can be explained by this model. Other issues concerning shell galaxies are
reviewed by Kormendy and Djorgovski (1989).
Taylor-Mager et al. (2007; see their Fig. 2) have proposed a simple classification of interact-
ing systems that highlights different interaction classes. A premerger (type pM) includes two
interacting galaxies that are sufficiently far apart to suffer little apparent distortion. A minor
merger (mM) is two galaxies showing evidenceof merging, but one component is much smaller
than the other. A major merger (M) has two comparable brightness galaxies in the process of
merging, while a merger remnant (MR) is a state sufficiently advanced that the merging com-
ponents are no longer distinct. The three lower right frames in >Fig. 1-30 show examples of
these types.
10.3.4 Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies
Related to interacting systems are the infrared-bright galaxies first identified by Rieke and Low
(1972) based on 10 µm photometry. From studies based on the Infrared Astronomical Satellite
(IRAS), Sanders and Mirabel (1996) classified a galaxy as a “luminous infrared galaxy” (LIRG)
if its luminosity in the 8–1,000 µm range is between 10and 10L⊙. If the luminosity in the
same wavelength range exceeds 10L⊙, then the object is called an “ultraluminous infrared
galaxy” (ULIRG). Detailed studies have shown that at high redshifts, LIRGS and ULIRGS are a
dominant population of objects (see discussion in Pereira-Santaella et al. 2010).
The morphologies of nine ULIRGS were studied using HST B and I-band images by Surace
et al. (1998). Their montage of six of these objects is shown in >Fig. 1-31. In every case there are
clear signs of interactions, and all are likely linked to mergers or mergers in progress. Several,
like Mk 231, have bright Seyfert nuclei. Arribas et al. (2004) obtained extensive imaging of local
LIRGS and found a similar high proportion of strongly interacting and merging systems.
The merger rate is considered one of the most important parameters for understanding
galaxy evolution. It has been difficult to estimate, and issues connected with it are discussed by
Jogee et al. (2009; see alsoConselice 2009). Amergeris considered majorifit involves a compan-
ion ranging from one fourth to approximately equal mass to the main galaxy. A major merger of
two spiral galaxies can destroy both disks and lead to an r

law-profile remnant through violent
relaxation. Minor mergers involve companions having one tenth to one fourth the mass of the

main galaxy. Both types of mergers, while in progress, can lead to many specific morphological
features such as highly distorted shapes, tidal tails and bridges, shells and ripples, and warps.
Even some bars and spiral patterns are thought to be connected to interactions, and especially
galaxies with a double nucleus are thought to be mergers. As discussed in >Sect. 10.1, mergers
or collisions may also be at the heart of rare morphologies such as ring and polar ring galaxies.
Using visual classifications of merger types, Jogee et al. (2009) estimate that 16% of high-mass
galaxies have experienced a major merger, while 45% have experienced a minor merger during
the past 3–7 Gyr (z = 0.24–0.80).
10.4 Warps
A warp is an apparent bend or slight twist in the shape of the disk of a spiral galaxy (see Sellwood
2010 and references therein). In a warp, stars and gas clouds move in roughly circular orbits, but
the orientation of these orbits relative to the inner disk plane changes with increasing radius.
Warps are most easily detected in edge-on galaxies because the bending of the outer orbits
makes the galaxy look like an integral sign. Although often most pronounced in an HI map,
warps can be seen in ordinary optical images of edge-on galaxies. >Figure 1-32 shows three
galaxies having strong optical warping of the disk plane. In two of the galaxies, the bright inner
disk is unwarped, while a fainter and thicker outer disk zone is twisted relative to the inner disk.
In UGC 3697, the warping is exceptionally visible. In general, optical warping is less severe than
HI warping.

Warping is a very common aspect of spiral galaxies (e.g., Binney 1992) and has been inter-
preted in terms of perturbations (gaseous infall or interactions) that trigger bending instabilities
(e.g., Revaz and Pfenniger 2007). Garcia-Ruiz et al. (2002) estimated HI warp angles, the angle
between the inner disk plane and the assumed linear warping zone, to range from nearly 0○to
more than 30○. A useful summary of previous warp studies is provided by Saha et al. (2009),
who examine warp onset radii in mid-IR images. The theory of warps is reviewed by Sellwood
(2010).
10.5 The Morphology of Active Galaxies
The morphology of active galaxies (also called “excited” galaxies by van den Bergh 1998) is
important to consider because of a possible link between morphological features and the fuel-
ing of the active nucleus. Early studies showed a preponderance of ring, pseudoring, and
bar features in Seyfert galaxies that suggested the link was bar-driven gas flow (Simkin et al.
1980). Several examples of the morphology of Seyfert and other active galaxies are shown
in >Fig. 1-33. The activity classifications are based mainly on spectroscopy, not on morphology,
and are described by Veron-Cetty and Veron (2006).
A detailed study of active galaxy morphologies by Hunt and Malkan (1999) provided similar
results to the early studies. These authors examined the morphologies of a large sample of galax-
ies selectedon the basis of their 12 µm emission and found that outer rings and inner/outer ring
combinations are three to four times higher in Seyfert galaxies than in normal spirals. In con-
trast, bars were found to occur with the same frequency (≈69%) in Seyferts as in normal spirals,
while for HII/starburst galaxies, the frequency was much higher (>80%). Although outer rings
are found mostly in barred galaxies, bars do not promote the nuclear activity of Seyfert galax-
ies. Hunt and Malkan (1999) interpret this inconsistency in terms of timescales: it takes roughly
3 × 10years for a closed outer ring to form, a timescale during which a bar may weaken or dis-
solve. Because ofthis, a high ring frequencyin Seyferts would indicate an advanced evolutionary
state. Related to the same issue, Comerón et al. (2010) found that nuclear rings do not correlate
with the presence of nuclear activity.
The studyofHunt and Malkan (1999)used mostlyRC3 classifications todeduce the barfrac-
tion in active galaxies. These visual classifications are based on blue-light images, and hence dust

could effectively obscure some bars. Knapen et al. (2000) used high-resolution near-IR images
of well-defined samples and quantitative bar detection methods to deduce that bars are more
frequent in Seyfert galaxies than in a control sample of nonactive galaxies: 79% ± 7.5% versus
59% ± 9% (see also Laine et al. 2002). Laurikainen et al. (2004) came to a similar conclusion
for 180 galaxies in the OSUBSGS, based on near-IR H-band images. The former studies used
ellipse fits to identify bars, while Laurikainen et al. used Fourier analysis.
McKernan et al. (2010) also consider outer rings and pseudorings as probes of models of
AGN fueling from interactions and mergers. The idea is that a closed outer ring takes a long

Galaxy Morphology 1
51
time to form and is very fragile, being sensitive to interactions and changes in the bar pattern
speed (e.g., Bagley et al. 2009). An interaction can change a closed outer ring into a pseudoring
and could possibly destroy the ring. Thus, rings are probes of the interaction history of active
galaxies. McKernan et al. found no difference between the AGN found in ringed galaxies and
those found in galaxies without rings. But in those with rings, recent interactions can be ruled
out and activity may be tied to short-term internal secular evolutionary processes.
Bahcall et al. (1997) presented HST images of 20 luminous, low redshift quasars observed
with a wide V-band filter. > Figure 1-34 is reproduced from their paper and shows images
of the host galaxies after removal of most of the quasar light. The images show a variety of
morphologies, including ellipticals, interacting pairs, systems with obvious tidal disturbances,
and normal-looking spirals. An example of the latter is PG1402 + 261 (z = 0.164), which is type
(R′
)SB(rs)a based partly also on the image shown in Fig. 7 of Bahcall et al. From the number of

hosts showing signs of interactions, as well as the number of companions, Bahcall et al. conclude
that interactions may trigger the quasar phenomenon.
10.6 The Morphology of Brightest Cluster Members
Matthews et al. (1964) observed the optical morphologies of the radio sources identified with
the brightest members of rich galaxy clusters. They found that the most common form was
what Morgan (1958) called a “D” galaxy, meaning a galaxy having an elliptical-like inner region
surrounded by an extensive envelope (see discussion in van den Bergh 1998). Although these
superficially resembled Hubble’s S0s, none were found having a highly elongated shape, imply-
ing that the galaxies are not as highly flattened as typical S0s. Another characteristic of the
cluster D galaxies was their very large linear size and exceptional luminosity, much larger than
a typical cluster member. To denote these extreme objects in the Morgan system, the prefix c
was added as in the old classification of supergiant stars. Even today, Morgan’s notation “cD” is
used to describe these supergiant galaxies which are generally considered outside the scope of
the Hubble system.
The most detailed study of the photometric properties of brightest clustermembers (BCMs)
was made by Schombert (1986, 1987, 1988; see also various references therein). The main BCM
types Schombert considered were gE (giant ellipticals), D, and cD, distinguished mainly from
the appearance of profile shape. D galaxies are larger and more diffuse with shallower profiles
than gE galaxies, while a cD galaxy is the same as a D galaxy but with a large extended envelope
(Schombert 1987). cD envelopes can extend to 500 kpc or more. Kormendy and Djorgovski
(1989) argue that only cD galaxies are sufficiently physically distinct from ellipticals to merit
being a separate class and recommended that the “D” class not be used.
Two cD galaxies and two gE galaxies are shown in >Fig. 1-35. To give an idea of the scale of
these objects, the vertical dimension of the frames corresponds to 201, 232, and 132 kpc for (left
toright)UGC10143 (A2152), NGC4874/89 (A1656), and NGC6041 (A2151), respectively. The
cD classification of NGC 4874 is due to Schombert (1988), and one can see in >Fig. 1-35 that it
is much larger and has a shallower brightness profile than nearby NGC 4889. The cD envelope

4874-89 is from the dVA

Galaxy Morphology 1

is detected as an excess of light in the outer regions relative to a generalized brightness profile
and may not even be the light that leads to the visual classification of cD.
Based on structural deviations such as the large radii, shallow profile slopes, and bright
inner regions, Schombert (1987) concluded that BCMs fit well with the predictions of merger
simulations, including accretion and “cannibalism” of smaller cluster members. Properties of
cD envelopes (as separated photometrically from the parent galaxy) may suggest a stripping
process for their formation (Schombert 1988).
As noted in > Sect. 5.1, many BCMs in RC3 received the classification E+, suggesting
that the characteristic brightness profiles give a hint of an envelope interpreted as an incipient
disk. The distribution of axial ratios of cDs actually is flatter on average than normal ellipticals
(Schombert 1986), but it is not clear that the perceived envelopes in BCM E+ galaxies are actu-
ally as flattened as a typical disk. A local example of a gE galaxy is M87, classified as type E+0-1
by de Vaucouleurs.

Star Formation Morphologies
11.1 Hα Imaging
The standard waveband for galaxy classification, the B-band, is sensitive enough to the extreme
population I component that the degree ofresolution ofspiral arms intostar-forming complexes
is part of the classification. The B-band, however, also includes a substantial contribution from
the older stellar background. One way to isolate only the star-forming regions in a galaxy is
imaging in Hα, which traces HII regions. Apart from showing the distribution of star formation
(modified by extinction), Hα imaging also traces the rate of global photoionization, which in
turn directly traces the rate of formation of stars more massive than about 10 M⊙(Kennicutt
et al. 1994). The initial mass function (IMF), either assumedor constrained in some way (using,
e.g., broadband colors), allows Hα fluxes to be converted to the total star formation rate over
all stellar masses.
Hα imaging often shows well-organized patterns of HII regions that follow structures like
spiral arms and especially rings. Images of six early-to-intermediate-type ringed galaxies are
shown in >Fig. 1-36 (Crocker et al. 1996). The way Hα imaging usually works is a galaxy is
imaged in or near its redshifted Hα wavelength and then in a nearby red continuum wavelength.
The net Hα image is the difference between the Hα image and the scaled red continuum image.
Often, the Hα filter used is broad enough to include emission from [NII] 6548 to 6584. For
each of the galaxies shown in >Fig. 1-36, the left image is the red continuum image, while the
right image is the net Hα image. Of the four barred spirals shown (NGC 1433, 7329, 6782, and
7267), three show no HII regions associated with the bar. These three (NGC 1433, 7329, and
6782) all have conspicuous inner rings which are lined with HII regions. As shown by Crocker
et al. (1996), the distribution of HII regions around inner rings is sensitive to the intrinsic shape
of the ring. When the ring is highly elongated, the HII regions concentrate around the ends of
the major axis (which coincide with the bar axis; NGC 6782), while when the ring is circular, the
HII regions are more uniformly spread around the ring (NGC 7329). Inner ring shapes do not
correlate well with maximum relative bar torques in a galaxy (dVA), but Grouchy et al. (2010)
have shown that when local forcing is considered instead, ring shapes and bar strengths are well
correlated.

galaxies are (left to right), top row, NGC 7702, 1433; middle row, NGC 7329, 6782; bottom row, NGC
6935, 7267 (From Crocker et al. (1996))
The case of NGC 7267 is different in that most of its Hα emission is concentrated in the bar.
Martin and Friedli (1997) have argued that star formation along galactic bars could provide
clues to gas flow in the inner regions of galaxies and the fueling of starbursts and AGN. These
authors present models which suggest an evolution from a pure Hα bar to an Hα bar with
ionized gas in the center, to a gas-poor bar with strong nuclear or circumnuclear star formation.
This suggests that the bar of NGC 7267 is younger than those in NGC 1433, 7329, and 6782.
The two other galaxies shown in >Fig. 1-36 are nonbarred or only weakly barred. NGC 6935
is an interesting case where a nonbarred galaxyhas a strong ring ofstarformation. Grouchy et al.
(2010) found that the star formation properties of inner rings, but not the distribution of HII
regions, are independent of the ring shapes and bar strengths in a small sample. The case of
NGC 7702 is different from the others. This is a late S0 (type S0+) showing a very strong and
largely stellar inner ring. The ring shows little ionized gas and appears to be in a quiescent phase
of evolution.
11.2 Ultraviolet Imaging
The best global imaging of nearby galaxies at ultraviolet wavelengths has been obtained with
the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX, Martin et al. 2005), which provided detailed images

⊡Fig. 1-37
Comparison of a near-UV image (0.225 µm) with an Hα image for the nearby spiral galaxy M83
of galaxies of all types at wavelengths of 0.225 and 0.152 µm. These images reveal young stars
generally less than ≈100 Myr old but are affected by dust extinction. There is a strong correlation
between the UV morphology and the Hα morphology (>Fig. 1-37). Like Hα, UV fluxes from
galaxies can be used to estimate star formation rates once extinction is estimated and are par-
ticularly sensitive to the ratio of the present to the average past star formation rate. UV imaging
is an effective way of decoupling the recent star formation history of a galaxy from its overall,
long-term star formation history.
> Figure 1-38 shows near-UV (0.225 µm) images of eight galaxies over a range of Hubble
types. The two earliest types, NGC 1317 and 4314 (both Sa), show a near-UV morphology dom-
inated by a bright circumnuclear ring of star formation. The SB(r)b galaxy NGC 3351 shows a
conspicuous inner ring of star formation and little emission from its bar region. In contrast, the
SBc galaxy NGC 7479 shows strong near-UV emission from its bar. The late-type galaxies NGC
628 [type SA(s)c] and NGC 5474 [type SA(s)m] are typical of their types, but most interesting is
NGC 4625. A key finding of GALEX was extended UV emission well beyond the optical extent
of some galaxies. NGC 4625 is an example where the main optical part [type SABm] is only a
small fraction of the extent of the UV disk (Gil de Paz et al. 2005).
The final object shown in >Fig. 1-38 is NGC 5253, a basic example of what de Vaucouleurs
classified as I0 (>Sect. 5.3). The inner region is a bright boxy zone of star formation, and even
the extended disk is prominent.
11.3 Atomic and Molecular Gas Morphology
Related to star formation morphologies are the distributions of atomic and molecular gas. Far
from being randomly distributed clouds of interstellarmaterial, atomic and molecular gas mor-
phologies can be highly organized, well-defined patterns. Recent high-quality surveys have

bottom row, NGC 628, 5474, 4625, and 5253
provided some of the best maps of these distributions in normal galaxies. Atomic hydrogen
is mapped with the 21-cm fine structure emission line, which has the advantage of not being
affected by extinction and for being sufficiently optically thin in general to allow total HI masses
to be derived directly from HI surface brightness maps. In addition, HI maps provide informa-
tion on the kinematics and dynamics of the ISM, as well on the existence and distribution of
dark matter in galaxies. Molecular hydrogen is generally mapped using the CO J = −rota-
tional transition at a wavelength of 2.6 mm, under the assumption that CO and hydrogen mix
in a roughly fixed proportion.
Although numerous maps have been made of the HI distribution in nearby galaxies, the
most sophisticated and detailed survey made to date is the “The HI Nearby Galaxies Survey”
(THINGS, Walter et al. 2008). The earliest surveys had shown that HI is a tracer of spiral
structure in galaxies, and the THINGS provides some of the highest quality maps reveal-
ing this correlation as well as other characteristics. From a morphological point of view, HI
maps tend to reveal (1) enhanced surface brightness in star-forming features such as spi-
ral arms, rings, and pseudorings; (2) extended gaseous disks, such that the HI extent can
exceed the optical extent by several times; and (3) supernova-driven and star-formation-driven,
windblown holes.
>Figure 1-39 shows the HI morphologies of eight THINGS galaxies ranging from the Sab
galaxy NGC 4736 to the Sm galaxy DDO 50 (Holmberg II). Bright Sc galaxies like NGC 628
(M74) and NGC 5236 (M83) show HI distributions that extend well beyond the optical disks.
These extendedpatterns can include large spirals as in NGC 628. In M81 and M83, the HI traces
the optical spiral structure well. Large rings or pseudorings are seen in NGC 2841 and NGC
4258, while M81 shows an intermediate-scale ring of gas that is much less evident optically. The
bright star-forming inner ring in NGC 4736 is well defined and easily distinguished in HI, but
the galaxy’s diffuse stellar outer ring is more of an asymmetric spiral zone.

Most interesting in HI maps are the obvious holes where there appears to be a deficiency
of neutral gas compared to surrounding regions. Especially large holes are seen in the HI mor-
phology of the late-type dwarf DDO 50. These holes are thought to be regions cleared by the
stellar winds and explosions of massive stars contained or once contained within them. The
holes are 100 pc–2 kpc in size and have different systematic properties in early- and late-type
galaxies in the sense that holes may last longer in late-type dwarfs owing to the lack of serious
shear due to strong differential rotation (Bagetakos et al. 2009). Holes mayalso be found outside
the standard isophotal optical angular diameter.
The dwarf galaxy DDO 154 shown in >Fig. 1-39 has one of the largest ratios of HI to opti-
cal diameter, a factor of 6 at least according to Carignan and Purton (1998), who also estimated

58 1
Galaxy Morphology
that 90% of the mass of the galaxy is in the form of dark matter. The HI and optical morpholo-
gies bear little resemblance to one another. Another example of strongly uncorrelated HI and
optical morphologies is NGC 2915, a very gas-rich galaxy whose optical morphology is a blue
compact dwarf while its at least five times larger HI morphology includes a prominent outer
spiral with no optical counterpart (Meurer et al. 1996), leading to the concept of a purely “dark
spiral.” Bertin and Amorisco (2010) consider a general interpretation of such large outer HI
spirals, especially those seen in galaxies like NGC 628 and NGC 6946: the spirals represent
short trailing waves that carry angular momentum outward from corotation and, at least in the
gaseous component, penetrate a normal barrier at the OLR of the stellar disk pattern and go far
out into the HI disk. The short trailing waves are thought to excite the global spiral arms seen in
the main optical body of the galaxy (where the prominent optical spirals of NGC 628 and NGC
6946 are found). How NGC 2915 fits into this picture is unclear since the main stellar body of
this galaxy is not a grand-design spiral.
Galaxies whose HI disks do not extend much beyond the optical light distribution are also
of interest. NGC 4736 in >Fig. 1-39 is an example. The large, nearby ringed barred spiral NGC
1433 was found by Ryder et al. (1996) to have neutral hydrogen gas concentrated in its central
area, its inner ring, and in its outer pseudoring, with no gas outside the visible disk light and a
lower amount of gas in the bar region compared to the ring regions. Higdon et al. (1998) showed
that in the ringed, barred spiral NGC 5850, neutral gas is concentrated in the inner ring and in
the asymmetric outer arm pattern, with little or no emission detected outside this pattern. The
asymmetry led Higdon et al. to propose that NGC 5850 has possibly experienced a high-speed
collision with nearby NGC 5846.
In galaxy clusters, it is well known that environmental effects can truncate an HI disk so
that it is smaller than the optical disk light. This is dramatically illustrated in the high-resolution
VLA HI maps of Virgo Cluster galaxies by Chung et al. (2009), who found that galaxies within
0.5 Mpc of the clustercore have severelytruncated HI disks typically less than half the size of the
optical standard isophotal diameter, D. A variety of earlier studies had already shown these
galaxies to be HI deficient compared to field galaxies of similar types. As noted in >Sect. 10.2,
an interaction between a clustergalaxy’s ISM and the intraclustermedium can account for these
unusual modifications of HI morphology. Chung et al. also provide evidence for this interaction
in some morphologies that appear to be gas stripping in progress.
The Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland SurveyofNearbyGalaxies (BIMASONG; Regan et al.2001;
Helfer et al. 2003) provided some of the highest quality CO maps of normal galaxies. CO
emission is often seen in intermediate (Sab-Sd) galaxies, which have a high enough gas con-
tent and metallicity to allow the CO J = −2.6-mm emission line to be detectable. The CO
distributions of eight such galaxies from this survey are shown in > Fig. 1-40. These display
some of the range of molecular gas morphologies seen. CO traces the inner spiral arms of NGC
628, 1068, and 4535 and is seen along the bar of NGC 2903. A common CO morphology is a
large-diameter ring of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), without a central CO concentration, as
seen in NGC 2841 and 7331. The rings are the peaks of exponentially declining distributions.
The coherent inner molecular gas ring in NGC 7331 appears more like a typical resonance
ring and has an estimated molecular gas mass of 3.4 × 10M⊙(Regan et al. 2004). The CO
distribution in NGC 2403 appears to be concentrated in individual GMCs, with little diffuse
emission, while that in NGC 3351 is characterized by a small central bar aligned nearly per-
pendicular to the galaxy’s primary bar. Helfer et al. (2003) show that the Milky Way, M31,
and M33 have CO morphologies that are consistent with the range of morphologies found by
BIMA SONG.

Infrared Observations: Galactic Stellar Mass Morphology
Infrared observations have considerable advantagesover optical observations of galaxies. While
traditional B-band images are sensitive to dust and extinction (both internal and external), the
effects of extinction in the near- and mid-IR are much less and become virtually negligible at
3.6 µm. Spiral galaxies imaged at wavelengths successively longer than B-band become pro-
gressively smoother looking, not only due to the reduced effect of extinction, but also to the
de-emphasis of the young blue stellar component. The combination of these effects has led to
the popular idea that IR imaging reveals the “stellar backbone” of galaxies, that is, the distribu-
tion of actual stellar mass (e.g., Rix and Rieke 1993; Block et al. 1994). Thus, infrared imaging

60 1
Galaxy Morphology
has become a staple for studies of the gravitational potential and stellar mass distribution in
galaxies (e.g., Quillen et al. 1994) and for the quantification of bar strength from maximum
relative gravitational torques (e.g., Buta and Block 2001; Laurikainen and Salo 2002).
Infrared imaging has also revealed interesting outer structures such as the large outer red
arcs seen in M33, which have been interpreted by Block et al. (2004b) to be swaths of extremely
luminous carbon stars formed from external accretion of low-metallicity gas. Power spectrum
analysis of the IR structures in classical spirals has been used to detect azimuthal “star streams”
and to evaluate the role of turbulence on star formation and spiral structure (Block et al. 2009
and references therein).
Near-infrared imaging from 0.8 to 2.2 µm can be successfully obtained from ground-
based observatories but with the serious drawback that the brightness of the sky background
increases substantially over this range. As a result, it has not been possible to achieve a depth
of exposure at, for example, 2.2 µm comparable to the kinds of depths achievable at opti-
cal wavelengths without excessive amounts of observing time. The first major near-IR survey
designed for large-scale morphological studies was the Ohio State University Bright Spiral
Galaxy Survey (OSUBSGS, Eskridge et al. 2002), which included optical BVRI and near-IR
JHK images of 205 bright galaxies of types S0/a to Sm in a statistically well-defined sample
selected to have total blue magnitude BT ≤12.0 and isophotal diameter D≤6.′5. This survey
allowed a direct demonstration of how galaxy morphology actually changes from optical to
near-IR wavelengths, not merely for a small, selected sample of galaxies, but for a large sam-
ple covering all spiral subtypes. The main near-IR filter used in this survey was the H-band
at 1.65 µm.
The OSUBSGS was later complemented by the Near-Infrared S0 Survey (NIRS0S,
Laurikainen et al. 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010; Buta et al. 2006), a Ks-band imaging survey of
174 early-type galaxies in the type range S0−to Sa, but mostly including S0s, some of which were
misclassified as ellipticals in RC3. NIRS0S images are deeper than OSUBSGS near-IR images
owing to the use of larger telescopes and longer on-source times. Although S0 galaxies are dom-
inated by old stars and are usually smooth even in blue-light images, the Ks-band was chosen
to complement the OSUBSGS sample of spirals in order to make a fair comparison between bar
strengths and bulge properties of S0s and spirals. Also, S0 galaxies are not necessarily dust-free,
and near-IR imaging is still necessary to penetrate what dust they have. NIRS0S has led to sev-
eral important findings about S0 galaxies: (1) a class of S0s, not previously recognized, having
prominent lenses but very small bulges that are more typical of Sc galaxies than of earlier type
spirals (e.g., NGC 1411, Laurikainen et al. 2006); (2) considerable evidence that S0 galaxies have
pseudobulges just as in many spirals (Laurikainen et al. 2007). While the bulges of the latter are
likely to be made of rearranged disk material in many cases (>Sect. 9), those in S0s are likely to
be related to the evolution of bars. S0 bulges tend to be nearly exponential (Sersic index n ≤2),
are supported against gravity by rotation rather than random motions, and often include clear
inner disks; (3) good correlations between bulge effective radii, re, and disk radial scale length,
hR, as well as between the Ks-band absolute magnitudes of the bulge and disk, suggest that S0
bulges are not formed from hierarchical mergers, implying that S0s could be stripped spirals,
although the lower bar fraction in S0s suggest that this is in conjunction with evolution due to
bars and ovals; (4) 70% of S0-S0/a galaxies have ovals or lenses, suggesting that bars have been
weakened in such galaxies over time; and (5) not only bulges but also disks of S0s are similar to
those in S0/a-Scd spirals.
The Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS, Skrutskie et al. 2006) provided near-IR JHKs
images of a much larger galaxy sample than either the OSUBSGS or NIRS0S, although these
images lack the depth of the OSUBSGS and NIRS0S images in general. 2MASS provided

considerable information on near-infrared galaxy morphology, which led to the extensive
2MASS Large Galaxy Atlas (Jarrett et al. 2003).
The best imaging of galaxies at mid-IR wavelengths has been obtained with the Spitzer Space
Telescope using the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC, Fazio et al. 2004) and 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 µm
filters. The 3.6 and 4.5 µm filters provide the most extinction-free views of the stellar mass
distribution in galaxies, while the 5.8 and 8.0 µm filters reveal the interstellar medium (ISM)
(Pahre et al. 2004). The loss of coolant in 2008 prevented further observations with the 5.8 and
8.0 µm filters, but the 3.6 and 4.5 µm filters could still be used. This led to the Spitzer Survey of
Stellar Structure in Galaxies (SG, Sheth et al. 2010), a 3.6 and 4.5 µm survey of 2,331 galaxies of
all types closer than 40 Mpc. These wavelengths sample the Rayleigh–Jeans decline of the stellar

images. Spitzer observations have a very low background compared to ground-based near-IR
observations, and thus IRAC images are the deepest galaxy images ever obtained in the IR.

Galaxy Morphology
Only the B- and Ks-band images are from ground-based observations. The GALEX image
reveals the extensive star formation in the spiral arms and the complete absence of star for-
mation in the companion NGC 5195 as well as in the complex tidal material north of the
companion. The star formation in the arms is more subdued in the B-band and almost com-
pletely subdued in the Ks-band. The arms are so smooth in the Ks-band that the galaxy
resembles an Sa or Sab system. (The B-band type is Sbc.) Surprisingly, this is not the case in
the 3.6 µm image whose considerably greater depth compared to the Ks-band image is evident.
The spiral arms in the 3.6 µm band are lined by numerous resolved objects, many of which are
correlated with the star-forming regions seen in the B-band. This is dramatically seen also in
the SB(s)cd galaxy NGC 1559 (>Fig. 1-42), where an IRAC 3.6 µm image is compared with a
B-band image. These show that resolved features in the deep 3.6 µm image are well correlated
with B-band star-forming complexes. Thus, mid-IR 3.6 µm images are not completely free of
the effects of the extreme population I stellar component (see discussions in Block et al. 2009;
Buta et al. 2010a).
A sampling of SG images as compared to B-band images for the same galaxies from the
dVA is shown in > Fig. 1-43. The four galaxies shown, NGC 584, 1097, 628, and 428, have
dVA types of S0−, SBb, Sc, and Sm, respectively, thus covering almost the entire Hubble–de
Vaucouleurs sequence. Although the very dusty interacting system NGC 1097 looks slightly
“earlier” at 3.6-µm, these images show again that on the whole the morphology in the two wave-
bands is very similar. The same is seen for other galaxies described by Buta et al. (2010a), who
found that 3.6 µm types, judged using the same precepts described in the dVA for blue-light
images, are well correlated with blue-light types. On average, mid-IR classifications for RC3
S0/a-Sc galaxies are about one stage interval earlier than B-band classifications, with little dif-
ference for types outside this range. The correlation is much betterthan what was expected from

previous near-IR studies (Eskridge et al. 2002). 3.6 µm galaxy morphology is sufficiently con-
taminated by recent star formation to allow the same criteria defined for blue-light images to
be used for galaxy classification, a surprising result.
Drastic differences between 3.6 µm and B-band morphology are seen only for the most
dusty galaxies. One example is NGC 5195, shown also in >Fig. 1-41. This galaxy, classified as
Irr II in the Hubble Atlas and as I0 by de Vaucouleurs, appears as a regular early-type galaxy
of type SAB(r)0/a (see also Block et al. 1994). Other galaxies that can look very different are

Comparison of IRAC 3.6 µm and SDSS g-band images of the ﬂocculent spiral galaxy NGC 5055
flocculent spirals such as NGC 5055 (>Fig. 1-44). The flocculence largely disappears at 3.6 µm,
and a more global pattern is seen (see also Thornley 1996). The type of NGC 5055, Sbc, remains
largely unchanged from B to 3.6 µm.
As noted by Helou et al. (2004), the mid-IR wavelength domain marks the transition from
emission dominated by starlight to emission dominated by interstellar dust. While images at
3.6 µm show the stellar bulge and disk almost completely free of dust extinction, an image
at 8 µm shows very little starlight but considerable emission from the ISM in the form of
glowing dust.
>Figure 1-45 shows an 8 µm image of the nearby spiral galaxy M81 as compared to a B −I
color index map coded such that blue star-forming features are dark while red dust lanes are
light. The 8 µm image of M81 shows that its ISM is closely associated with its spiral arms. Com-
parison with the B−I color index shows that both the star-forming arms as well as near-side dust
lanes can be seen at 8 µm. Even the far-side lanes in the bulge region are clear at 8 µm, where
no tilt asymmetry is manifested. Willner et al. (2004) argue that the dust emission from M81’s
ISM is likely dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; Gillett et al. 1973) which
have a prominent emission feature at 7.7 µm. Willner et al. also showed good correspondence
between the nonstellar dust emission in M81 and the distribution of near-ultraviolet (NUV)
emission. Some regions with bright dust emission and little NUV emission were attributed to
excessive UV extinction, while areas with bright NUV and little dust emission were attributed
to the effects of supernovae.
The B−I color index mapof M81 shows an additional set of dust lanes that have no counter-
part in the 8 µm map. These lanes are oriented roughly perpendicularly to the major axis about
halfway between the center and the northern arm. Sandage and Bedke (1994) interpret these as
foreground dust associated with high galactic latitude nebulosities in the halo of our Galaxy.

Intermediate and High Redshift Galaxy Morphology
The key to detecting observable evidence for galaxy evolution, that is, to actually see morpho-
logical differences that are likely attributable to evolution, is to observe galaxies at high redshift
with sufficient resolution toreveal significant details ofmorphology. Butcherand Oemler(1978)
had already found strong evidence for morphological evolution in the excess number of blue
galaxies in very distant (z = 0.4–0.5) rich galaxy clusters. These authors suggested that the blue
galaxies are spiral galaxies and that by the present epoch, these are the galaxies that became
the S0s that dominate nearby rich, relaxed clusters (like the Coma Cluster, Abell 1656). An
excellent summary of the issues connected with high redshift morphological studies is provided
by van den Bergh (1998).
Progress on galaxy morphology at high redshift could only be achieved with the resolution
and depth of the Hubble Space Telescope. The Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N, Williams
et al. 1996), South (HDFS, Volonteri et al. 2000), and Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF, Beckwith et al.
2006), and the GOODS (Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey; Giavalisco et al. 2004),
GEMS (Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and SEDS; Rix et al. 2004), COSMOS (Cosmic
Evolution Survey; Scoville et al. 2007), and other surveys (e.g., Cowie et al. 1995), have pro-
vided a large body of information to work with. For example, studies of galaxies in the redshift
range 0.3 ≤z ≤0.9 show that the proportion of irregular-shaped galaxies dramatically increases
(e.g., Abraham et al. 1996). This means that the Hubble sequence as we know it did not always

66 1
Galaxy Morphology
exist but was built up over time via mergers or secular evolution or both. Observations of sub-
millimeter sources (Chapman et al. 2003) suggest some of these irregulars are extended major
mergers.
Interpretation of evolution in the various deep surveys depends on knowledge of redshifts,
which can be difficult to measure spectroscopically. A very useful technique for isolating galax-
ies in high redshift ranges is the UV-dropout method (Steidel and Hamilton 1992). Galaxies
are compared in different filters, such as B, V, i, and z. If the redshift is high enough
to move the Lyman limit at 0.0912µm out of any of the first three filters, there will be a sig-
nificant drop in flux owing to absorption by hydrogen, and the galaxy is said to “drop out.”
Galaxies found in this way are called “Lyman break” galaxies because the effect is partly caused
by the spectral characteristics of hot stars, which show such a break. (Another cause is UV
self-absorption.)
Steidel et al. (1996) used the UV-dropout approach to identify high z galaxies in the HDF-N
and also used direct spectroscopy to confirm that the method works. Beckwith et al. (2006)
utilized the method to identify galaxies in the HUDF having z from 3.5 to 7. If a galaxy is seen
to drop out of a U-band filter such as F300W and seen in a B-band filter such as F450W (both
used for the HDF-N; Williams et al. 1996), then the redshift range selected is z = 2.4–3.4. Van
den Bergh (1998) argues that most Lyman break galaxies are young ellipticals or bulges.
van den Bergh et al. (2000) describe the issues connected with morphological classifica-
tions of galaxies to redshifts of z ≈1. Resolution, band shifting, and selection effects due to the
magnitude-limited nature of surveys all enter into the interpretation of intermediate to high
redshift galaxy morphology. Resolution is important because, typically, a nearby galaxy, will
have 100 times or more pixels in the image than a high z galaxy will have for classification. This
is fewer pixels than sky survey images of nearby galaxies would have. The bandpass effect is
important because the B-band, the standard wavelength for historical galaxy classification, is
not sampling the same part of the spectrum as it would for nearby galaxies. For example, at z = 1,
a B-band filter samples mid-ultraviolet light (≈0.22 µm) and would be much more sensitive to
young star-forming regions than it would be for nearby galaxies. Ideally, then, for comparison
with nearby galaxies we would like to choose a redshifted band as close as possible to the rest-
frame B-band. Even accounting for all these effects, significant differences between nearby and
distant morphologies do exist. For example, van den Bergh et al. (2000) discuss the paucity of
grand-design spirals and barred galaxies in the HDF-N and use artifically redshifted images of
nearby galaxies to demonstrate that the deficiencies are likely to be real.
> Figure 1-46 shows several of the different categories of intermediate and high redshift
galaxy morphologies, based on V and i-band images from the GEMS and Hubble UDF. The
redshifts range from 0.42 to 3.35 and provide a wide range of look-back times. First, in such
a range, some galaxies look relatively normal, as shown by the spiral and elliptical galaxies in
the two upper left frames of >Fig. 1-46. The z = 0.59 spiral is classifiable as type SA(s)bc and
the elliptical as type E3. The z = 0.99 spiral shown in the middle right frame of > Fig. 1-46
has larger clumps, no clear central object, and more asymmetry than the z = 0.59 spiral but is
still recognizable as a spiral. However, other less familiar categories are found. In general, high
redshift galaxies have smaller linear diameters than nearby galaxies on average (e.g., Elmegreen
et al. 2007a [EEFM07]).
“Chain galaxies” were first identified by Cowie et al. (1995) and are linear structures with
superposed bright knots that have sizes and blue colors similar to normal late-type galaxies
and relatively flat major axis luminosity profiles. They have the shapes of edge-on disk galaxies
but lack clear bulges or nuclei. A recent study by Elmegreen et al. (2004a) [EES04] of faint

Intermediate to high redshift galaxy morphology (V and i-bands). The categories are due to EES04
and EE06. The number in parentheses below each frame is the redshift z of the galaxy shown
galaxy morphologies (redshifts 0.5–2) in the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) “Tadpole”
galaxy (UGC10214) field showed that chain galaxies are the most common linear morphology
at magnitudes fainterthan I = 22, accounting formore than 40% ofthe sample. Theirdominance
(also found by Cowie et al. 1995) is interpreted by EES04 as a selection effect because relatively
optically thin edge-on galaxies are more favored to be seen near the limit owing to a higher
projected surface brightness than for face-on versions of the same galaxies. EES04 suggest that
chain galaxies are edge-on irregular galaxies that will evolve to late-type disk galaxies. Chains
are the most flattened linear morphology at faint magnitudes.
“Clump clusters” (EES04) are somewhat irregular collections of blue knots or clumps with
very faint emission between clumps. The clumps have sizes of ≈500 pc and masses of ≈10–
10M⊙. Both ofthe examples shown in >Fig. 1-46 have z > 1. Elmegreen et al. (2004b)[EEH04]
identified clump clusters as the face-on counterparts of the linear chain galaxies, based on the
similarities of the properties of the clumps with those seen in chain galaxies and on the distri-
bution of axis ratios of the systems as compared with normal disk galaxies. The lack of a bulge
clump is also consistent with this conclusion. Nevertheless, analysis of NICMOS IR images in

68 1
Galaxy Morphology
the HUDF led Elmegreen et al. (2009a) to conclude that 30% of clump clusters and 50% of chain
galaxies show evidence of young bulges, implying that at least half of these galaxies might be
genuinely bulgeless. In a related study, Elmegreen et al. (2009b) show that the best local ana-
logues of clump clusters are dwarf irregular galaxies like Ho II, scaled up by a factor of 10–100
in mass. This study also brought attention to clump clusters with faint red background disks, as
opposed to blue clump clusters which lack such a feature. Elmegreen et al. argue that the red
background clump clusters are part of an evolutionary sequence leading from the blue clump
clusters to spirals with a “classical” bulge (e.g., KK04). The clumps, formed by gravitational
instabilities in a turbulent disk, are large and few in number and thus will eventually coalesce
near the galaxy center if they survive the effects of supernova explosions (e.g., Elmegreen et al.
2008).
“Tadpoles” (van den Bergh et al. 1996) are asymmetrically shaped “head-tail” morphologies
with a bright off-centered nucleus and a tail, like a tadpole. A rare local example is NGC 3991.
Tadpoles were recognized in 3% of the galaxies in HDF-N and were found to be very blue in
color. Usually both the head and the tail are blue, but van den Bergh et al. (1996) show one
example where the head is red and the tail is blue. EEH04 showed that tadpoles have neither
exponential major axis profiles nor clear bulges, and in their sample of linear objects, tadpoles
are the least frequently seen.
The bottom frames of >Fig. 1-46 show bent chains and rings or partial rings (Elmegreen
and Elmegreen 2006 [EE06]). The rings and partial rings are thought to be mostly collisional
in nature (i.e., like the conventional ring galaxies shown in >Fig. 1-27) and show the different
morphologies expected when small companions plunge through a larger disk galaxy in different
ways (Appleton and Struck-Marcell 1996). Although bent chains resemble the partial rings,
they lack offset nuclei and any evidence of a background, more face-on disk. EE06 suggest that
bent chains are simply warped versions of the more common linear chains that have suffered an
interaction. The ages of the bent chain clumps are younger than those found in rings and partial
rings, and EE06 argue that relative separations and sizes of the clumps indicate they form by
gravitational instabilities.
Elmegreen et al. (2005) show that approximately one third of the ellipticals catalogued in
the HUDF have prominent blue clumps in their centers (see also Menanteau et al. 2001, 2004).
They argued that these clumps probably imply accretion events based on comparison of their
magnitudes and colors with local field objects. Menanteau et al. (2001) were able to reproduce
the color distributions with a model having a starburst superposed on a preexisting older stellar
population.
Galaxy morphology at intermediate and high redshifts also includes obvious interacting
cases as well as possible merger morphologies. Bridges, tidal tails, plumes, and even M51 ana-
logues are seen as in nearby galaxies, but are smaller in scale than for nearby objects (EEFM07).
The middle frame of the bottom row shows a possible merger in progress of two bent chains
(or, alternatively, two interacting spirals), called an “assembly galaxy” by EEFM07 because they
appear to be assembling from smaller objects. EEH04 and EEFM07 also discuss the double sys-
tems, considered another category of the linear systems. The double systems like the z= 3.35 one
shown in >Fig. 1-46 are probably merging ellipticals. EEFM07 also describe “shrimp galaxies,”
which appear to be interacting galaxies with a single curved arm or tail, curling at one end into
a “body.”
Other studies of high redshift galaxy morphology have focused on the specific redshift
ranges that are selected by the UV-dropout technique. Conselice and Arnold (2009) examined
the morphologies of galaxies in the z = 4–6 range from the HUDF and measured quantitative

Galaxy Morphology 1

parameters such as the concentration-asymmetry-clumpiness (star formation) parameters
(CAS; Conselice 2003) and other related parameters that are useful for distinguishing merg-
ers from normal galaxies. The CAS system is based on simple global parameters that are easily
derived automatically for large numbers of galaxies. Conselice (2003) tied the C parameter to
the past evolutionary history of galaxies while parameters A and S measure more active evo-
lution from mergers and star formation. Conselice and Arnold found that half of the HUDF
dropout galaxies they studied have significant asymmetries and may be undergoing merging,
while the other half is mainly smooth symmetric systems that may have collapsed quickly into
a temporary, quiescent state.
Other quantitative approaches to these issues include the Sersic n index that characterizes
radial luminosity profiles (Ravindranath et al. 2006; Elmegreen et al. 2007b) and the Gini coeffi-
cient (Abraham et al. 2003; Lotz et al. 2006). The Gini coefficient provides a way of quantifying
high redshift morphology that does not depend on galaxy shape or the existence of a well-
defined center and is well suited to the kinds of objects shown in >Fig. 1-46. Lotz et al. (2006)
found in a sample of 82 Lyman break galaxies that 10–25% are likely mergers, 30% are relatively
undisturbed spheroids, and the remainder are disks, minor mergers, or postmergers.
Given the rise in peculiar and irregular-shaped galaxies with increasing redshift, the ques-
tion naturally arises: when did the Hubble sequence and all its accompanying details fall into
place? This question is considered by Conselice et al. (2004), who quantitatively analyzed a well-
defined high redshift sample using the CAS system. Conselice et al. identify “luminous diffuse
objects” (LDOs) as galaxies having C less than 1σ below the average, and “luminous asymmet-
ric objects” (LAOs) as galaxies having A > S. Some of both classes of objects are covered by
the Elmegreen et al. categories described above. All of the LDOs and LAOs have MB < −19,
and Conselice et al. suggest such objects might be the precursors of modern disk and elliptical
galaxies. These are found in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 2, suggesting the present-day Hubble
sequence began taking shape in this interval. Conselice et al. (2008) consider the morphologies
of galaxies more massive than 10M⊙and in the range 1.2 < z < 3. To a zmagnitude of 27,
the majority of these galaxies are peculiar. They conclude that such galaxies undergo 4.3 ± 0.8
mergers to z = 3.

Giant Low-Surface-Brightness Galaxies
The van den Bergh luminosityclasses highlight how luminosityand surface brightness generally
go together. Low surface brightness usually means low luminosity and small size, hence a dwarf
classification. However, the discovery of rare giant low-surface-brightness (GLSB) galaxies by
Bothun et al. (1987) shows that morphology can sometimes be misleading for judging abso-
lute luminosity. The hallmarks of these objects are a relatively normal bulge and an extremely
low-surface-brightness, very large disk. Disk radial scale lengths and luminosities are unusually
large, and extrapolated disk central surface brightnesses are unusually faint compared to more
normal spirals. The disks tend to be relatively smooth with a few large, isolated HII regions.
Bothun et al. (1987) point to a model whereby the disks of these galaxies have such a low gas
surface density that they are largely unevolved due to the inefficiency of star formation.
GLSB galaxies can be classified within the Hubble–Sandage and de Vaucouleurs classifica-
tion systems although, as noted by McGaugh et al. (1995), the majority are classified later than
stage Sc. Bulges, bars, rings, and spiral patterns are evident in some examples in spite of the low

(McGaugh et al. 1995): Malin 2 (also known as F568−6), UGC 6614, and UGC 1230. In the
images, the length of a side is 131, 38, and 77 kpc, respectively. These can be compared to the
giant normal spiral NGC 7531 in the far-right frame, where the length of a side is also 38 kpc.
Malin 2 and UGC 6614 are especially enormous physical objects. UGC 1230 is also very large
for such a late-type morphology. van den Bergh (1998) likens the size of Malin 2 to the core of
a cluster of galaxies. He considers “monsters” like Malin 1 and Malin 2 to be only one of three
types of LSB galaxies. Some LSB galaxies are as big as normal galaxies, like UGC 1230. Most
LSB galaxies, however, are dwarfs: ellipticals, irregulars, and, less frequently, spirals. These are
described further in >Sect. 15.2.
An example of another object that could be considered a large LSB galaxy, but which lacks a
bulge or any evident recent star formation, is SGC 2311.8−4353, the mysterious ghostlike com-
panion close to the right of NGC 7531 in >Fig. 1-47. This peculiar object is two-thirds the size
of NGC 7531 (Buta 1987) but has unknown redshift. If it is associated with NGC 7531, it would
be as much as 30 kpc in diameter at the faintest detectable isophote level and would clearly not
be a dwarf. A recent extremely deep image of this pair by Martínez-Delgado et al. (2010) sug-
gested to these authors that SGC 2311.8−4353 is a cloud of tidal debris from a disrupted satellite
that resembles the “umbrella” structures seen in hierarchical cosmological simulations.
A recent study of three GLSBs (Malin 1, UGC 6614, and UGC 9024) by Rahman et al. (2007)
showed that IR emission from such objects is consistent with their optically determined low
star formation rates, with the diffuse optical disks being undetected from two of the three. A
dynamical study of two GLSBs (Malin 1 and NGC 7589) by Lelli et al. (2010) led the authors
to conclude that at least in these cases, the GLSB galaxy can be thought of as an inner high-
surface-brightness galaxy having a very extended LSB disk. This is based on the steeply rising
rotation curves found for these galaxies, which is very much like what is seen in early-type
high-surface-brightness galaxies.
Impeyand Bothun (1997) argue that LSB galaxies brighter than MB = −14 contribute signif-
icantly to the luminosity density of the local universe, are dark matter dominated at almost all
radii, and have an evolutionary history involving late collapse of a low amplitude perturbation,
a low star formation rate, and very slow changes. Large LSBs are greatly underrepresented in
galaxy catalogues but are clearly an important class of objects.

Galaxy Morphology in Color
15.1 Normal Galaxies
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Gunn et al. 1998; York et al. 2000) provides the largest body of
information on the colors of galaxies. The multiwavelength imaging in ugriz filters has allowed
the production of high-quality color images for thousands of galaxies. Although the Hubble–
Sandage–de Vaucouleurs classification systems were based on blue-light images alone, it is still
possible to reliably classify galaxies with SDSS color images, which are based on combined
gri images (Lupton et al. 2004). In such images, one can directly see the stellar population
differences that characterize different galaxy types.
> Figure 1-48 shows the color Hubble sequence from E to Sm. Once galaxy colors were
systematically measured using photoelectric photometry (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1976), it was
noted that integrated colors vary smoothly with advancing stage along the Hubble sequence.
The latest stages have corrected total color index (B −V)○
T ≈.–0.4 while E and S0 galaxies
have (B −V)○
T ≈.–1.0 (e.g., Buta et al. 1994). The latter colors correspond to yellow-
orange while the former are bluish white. The colors begin to change at S0/a and Sa and
become progressively bluer. > Figure 1-48 shows the reason for the change. Galaxies earlier
than Sa are dominated by old stars having the colors of K giants. As stage advances from
Sa to Sm, the spiral structure becomes progressively more important compared to the bulge.
Since the arms are dominated by complexes of massive young stars, this makes the inte-
grated colors of the galaxies become progressively bluer until by the end of the sequence, the
bluer colors of these stars have overcome the yellowish light of the background old disk stars.
>Figure 1-48 also shows that the intermediate colors of intermediate types such as Sb and Sc
are due to the yellowish orange colors of bulges and bars as combined with the bluer colors of
spiral arms.
The analysis of integrated SDSS galaxy colors for more than 100,000 galaxies led to one of
the most dramatic findings of the survey: a clear bimodality in the distribution of color that
correlates with morphology: a red peak that includes mainly E, S0, and Sa galaxies and a blue
peak that includes mainly Sb, Sc, and Irr galaxies (Strateva et al. 2001). Although the correlation
of galaxy color with types had been known for a long time from photoelectric measurements
(e.g., de Vaucouleurs 1961; Buta et al. 1994), the large sample provided by SDSS allowed the
bimodality to be demonstrated to a high degree of significance. In plots of u −r color index
versus absolute Mr magnitude, the galactic equivalent of a stellar H-R diagram, nearby early-
type galaxies follow a narrow band called the red sequence, while nearby later-type, mostly
star-forming galaxies appear as a broad blue sequence (also sometimes called the “blue cloud”).
Baldry et al. (2004) showed that the bimodality (in the form of a double Gaussian number dis-
tribution over all types) is detectable from Mr ≈−15.5 to Mr ≈−23, being undetectable only for
the most luminous galaxies. Wyder et al. (2007) showed that use of GALEX near-ultraviolet
magnitudes and optical r-band magnitudes provides even greater discrimination between the
Gaussian components. Bell et al. (2004)showed that the bimodalityis detectable in faint galaxies
to z ≈1, indicating that this characteristic of the galaxy population extends to a look-back time
of at least 9 Gyr. It is thought that galaxies evolve from the blue sequence to the red sequence
as their star formation is quenched, perhaps through mergers, gas depletion, or AGN feedback
(e.g., Martin et al. 2007). The possibility of evolution has engendered great interest in the galax-
ies lying near the minimum of the bimodal distribution (the so-called green valley; Thilker et al.
2010 and references therein).

Virtually all the galaxies shown in >Fig. 1-48 are of relatively high luminosity, with absolute
blue magnitudes M○
B averaging about −20. When physical parameters such as M○
B are consid-
ered, it becomes clear that the peculiar shape of the de Vaucouleurs classification volume shown
in >Fig. 1-3 only highlights the morphological diversity of families and varieties at each stage
but does not tell us about the physical parameter space at each stage, which expands consider-
ably at each end of the volume (McGaugh et al. 1995). Most known dwarf galaxies are either
early- or late-type, but not intermediate.

15.2.1 dE, dS0, BCD, and cE Galaxies
The most extensive study of dwarf galaxy morphologies was made by Binggeli et al. (1985)
[BST], who used deep photographs to probe the low-luminosity population of the Virgo Clus-
ter using mostly morphology to deduce cluster membership. Examples of several categories of
Virgo Cluster dwarf galaxies are shown in >Fig. 1-49 using SDSS color images and the classi-
fications of BST. The most common type is the dwarf elliptical, or dE type, which accounts for
80% of the galaxies in the BST catalogue. dE galaxies range from MB = −18 to −8 (Ferguson and
Binggeli 1994). Many dEs have an unresolved, starlike nucleus whose presence is indicated by an
N attached to the type, as in dE0,N. The top right panels of >Fig. 1-49 show three fairly typical
examples. Possibly related to these normal dE systems are the larger, lower surface brightness
ellipticals (“large dE”) shown in the two lower right frames of >Fig. 1-49.
The second row of >Fig. 1-49 shows examples of the interesting class of dwarf S0 galax-
ies. All of the examples shown are distinct from dEs in showing a smooth structure but with
additional features such as a lens or a weak bar. dS0 galaxies can also be nucleated and are
called dS0,N. In addition to the low-surface-brightness dEs and dS0s, the Virgo Cluster includes
two high-surface-brightness classes of dwarfs. The cE category refers to compact ellipticals that
resemble M32.

Galaxy Morphology
The blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies are a special class of star-forming dwarf irregulars
characterized by a few bright knots imbedded in a stellar background of low surface bright-
ness (Sandage and Binggeli 1984). The most extreme cases are nearly stellar (Thuan and Martin
1981). The knots are often super star clusters associated with 30-Doradus-like HII regions, and
the faint background can be very blue (Thuan et al. 1997). Spectroscopically, BCDs have nar-
row emission lines superposed on a blue continuum, and the lines indicate a low metallicity.
> Figure 1-49 shows three examples from the BST Virgo Cluster catalogue. Gil de Paz et al.
(2003) present an atlas of more than 100 BCDs that highlight their structure.
As described in >Sect. 5.1, the dE galaxies shown in >Fig. 1-49 are not the low-luminosity
extension ofmore luminous ellipticals. These togetherwith the dS0 class are labeled “spheroidal”
galaxies by Kormendy et al. (2009; see >Fig. 1-6), who confirmed the finding by Kormendy
(1985) that these galaxies are more related to evolved low-luminosity spirals and irregulars
than to genuine ellipticals. Based on correlations of well-defined photometric parameters (e.g.,
central surface brightness or velocity dispersion vs. core radius or absolute magnitude), these
authors link ellipticals like M32 to the actual low-luminosity end of the E galaxy sequence
(see also Wirth and Gallagher 1984). Thus, the cE galaxies shown in >Fig. 1-49 are in a sense
truer “dwarf ellipticals” than the dE galaxies shown. In spite of this revised viewpoint, the BST
classifications still have value since these are purely morphological interpretations.
15.2.2 Local Group Dwarf Spheroidals and Irregulars
The lowest luminosity galaxies that we can study in detail are in the Local Group. Fortunately,
a few are in the area covered by the SDSS so that they can be illustrated in color. These objects,
all fainter than MV = −12, are shown in >Fig. 1-50. Leo I and Leo II are usually called dwarf
spheroidal, or dSph, galaxies (e.g., Ferguson and Binggeli 1994). dSph galaxies tend to have to
have absolute visual magnitudes MV > −15 and a low degree of flattening; they are believed to
be the most abundant type of galaxy in the universe. Leo I (MV = −11.9) and Leo II (MV = −9.6)
look different in part because of their different star formation histories. dSph and dwarf irreg-
ular (dI) galaxies are now known to have complex and varied star formation histories that may
involve multiple episodes of star formation and effects of interactions (Mateo 1998 and refer-
ences therein). The other two galaxies in >Fig. 1-50, Leo A and DDO 155, are dwarf irregulars
having MV ≈−11.5. A detailed HST study of the stellar content of Leo A (Cole et al. 2007)

showed that 90% of the star formation in the galaxy occurred less than 8 Gyr ago, with a peak
at 1.5–3 Gyr ago. A useful summary of the properties of dSph galaxies is provided by van den
Bergh (1998) and, most recently, by Tolstoy et al. (2009), who also discuss the star formation
histories of Local Group dI galaxies.
The SDSS has facilitated the discovery of many new Local Group dwarf galaxies (Belokurov
et al. 2007). For example, the SDSS led to the discovery of one of the faintest known dSph galax-
ies, a new dwarf in Ursa Major (called the UMa dSph) having MV ≈−7 (Willman et al. 2005).
Most interesting is Leo T, which is an MV = −7.1 dSph galaxy with some recent star formation,
providing one of the most dramatic illustrations of the link between dSph and dI galaxies, and
the least luminous galaxy known to have recent star formation (Irwin et al. 2007).
15.2.3 Dwarf Spirals
Sandage and Binggeli (1984) described the classification of dwarf galaxies based on the Virgo
Cluster and concluded that there are “no real dwarf spirals.” This refers mainly to dwarf spirals
that might be classified as types Sa, Sb, or Sc, that is, having both a bulge and a disk. Dwarf
late-type spirals are already built into de Vaucouleurs’s modified Hubble sequence as Sd-Sm
types and connect directly to Magellanic irregulars, as shown in Fig. 1 of Sandage and Binggeli
(1984). Thus, any genuine examples of dwarf Sa, Sb, or Sc spirals would be of great interest as
they would challenge the idea that for a galaxy to be able to make well-defined spiral arms, it
would have to be more massive than some lower limit (estimated as 5 × 10M⊙by Sandage and
Binggeli).
Four of the best cases of genuine dwarf spirals are illustrated in >Fig. 1-51. The two right-
most frames show IC 783 (BST type dS0,N) and IC 3328 (BST type dE1,N), both Virgo Cluster
members having absolute magnitudes M○
B ≈−16 to −17 and found to have subtle spiral struc-
ture by Barazza et al. (2002) and Jerjen et al. (2000), respectively. The patterns are hard to see in
the direct SDSS color images shown in >Fig. 1-51, but these authors use photometric models,
Fourier decomposition, and unsharp-masking to verify the reality of the patterns. Barraza et al.
conclude that many of the bright early-type dwarfs in the Virgo Cluster have disks. An example
with a bar and spiral arms is NGC 4431 (shown as dS0 in >Fig. 1-49).
The leftmost panel of >Fig. 1-51 shows an HST wide V-band image (Carollo et al. 1997)
of NGC 3928, an absolute magnitude M○
B = −18 galaxy which on small-scale, overexposed
images looks like an E0 but which harbors a miniature (2-kpc diameter), low-luminosity spiral

(van den Bergh 1980b). Based on spectroscopic analysis, Taniguchi and Watanabe (1987) have
suggested that NGC 3928 is a spheroidal galaxy which experienced an accretion event that
supplied the gas for star formation in the miniature disk.
Schombert et al. (1995) brought attention to possible dwarf field spirals. One of their exam-
ples, D563−4, is shown in the second frame from the left in > Fig. 1-51. This galaxy has
M○
B ≈−17. A few other examples are given in the paper, and Schombert et al. find that they
are not in general grand-design spirals, are physically small, and have low HI masses. However,
van den Bergh (1998) considers all of Schombert et al.’s examples as subgiant spirals rather than
true dwarf spirals. A possible true dwarf spiral given by van den Bergh is DDO 122 (type S V).
15.3 Galaxy Zoo Project
The Galaxy Zoo project (Lintott et al. 2008) has made extensive use of SDSS color images. The
project uses a website to enlist the help of citizen scientists worldwide to classify a million
galaxies as well as note interesting and unusual cases in various forum threads. With such a
large database to work from, and the potential for discovery being real, the project has attracted
many competent amateur galaxy morphologists. One such discovery was a new class of galax-
ies called “green peas,” which are starlike objects that appear green in the SDSS composite color
images (>Fig. 1-52, left). Cardemone et al. (2009) used auxiliary SDSS data to show that peas
are galaxies that are green because of a high equivalent width of [OIII] 5007 emission. They are
sufficiently distinct from normal galaxies and quasars in a two-color g −r versus r −i plot that
such a plot can be used to identify more examples. Other characteristics noted are that peas
are rare, no bigger than 5 kpc in radius, lie in lower density environments than normal galaxies
but may still have morphological characteristics driven by mergers, are relatively low in mass
and metallicity, and have a high star formation rate. Cardemone et al. conclude that peas are a
distinct class of galaxies that share some properties with luminous blue compact galaxies and
UV-luminous high redshift galaxies.
Another prominent colorful galactic-sized object identified by Galaxy Zoo is “Hanny’s
Voorwerp” (> Fig. 1-52), a peculiar collection of blue clumps just south of IC 2497.
⊡Fig. 1-52
Interesting morphologies and color characteristics found by the Galaxy Zoo project team partic-
ipants. A “green pea” is a star-like galaxy with a high ﬂux in [OIII] 5007. “Hanny’s Voorwerp” is a
cloud of ionized gas that may be the light echo of a quasar outburst in the nucleus of nearby IC
2497. Red spirals are morphologically similar to blue spirals but have a lower star formation rate
(All SDSS color images)

Galaxy Morphology 1
77
Lintott et al. (2009) found that the Voorwerp is mostly ionized gas, and after ruling out some
possible sources of ionizing radiation, concluded that the object could be the first identified case
of a quasar light echo. The implication is that the companion galaxy underwent a temporary
quasar phase.
Masters et al. (2010) examine the properties of face-on late-type spiral galaxies whose colors
are much redder than is typical (> Fig. 1-52, right panels), suggesting that they are passive
objects where star formation has largely ceased or is lower than normal. These authors showed
that red spirals are not excessively dusty and tend to be near the high end of the mass spectrum.
A range of environmental densities was found, implying that environment alone is not sufficient
to make a spiral red. A significantly higher bar fraction was found for red spirals as compared
to blue spirals, which Masters et al. suggest could mean the bars themselves may have acted to
shut down the star formation in these galaxies.
A major philosophical aspect of Galaxy Zoo is the value of human visual interpretation of
galaxy morphology. That is, the human eye can integrate the detail in an image more reliably
than a computer program can, in spite of the latter’s ability to classify numbers of galaxies well
beyond the capability of a single individual. This philosophy was used to compile a major cata-
logue of galaxy merger pairs described by Darg et al. (2010). In the initial setup of Galaxy Zoo, a
single button allowed a classifier to select whether an object was a “merger” based simply on the
appearance of peculiarities. For each galaxy, a weighted average number, fm, was derived that
characterized the fraction of classifiers who interpreted a pair of galaxies as a merger, essen-
tially “morphology by vote” and in a way reminiscent of RC3 where morphological types were
in many cases based on a weighted average from a small number of classifiers (Buta et al. 1994).
Taking fm > 0.4, Darg et al. (2010) identified 3,003 pairs and groups of merging galaxies and
also showed that the spiral to elliptical galaxy ratio in merger pairs is a factor of 2 higher than
for the global galaxy population, suggesting that mergers involving spirals are detectable for a
longer period than those that do not involve spirals.
A similar philosophy to Galaxy Zoo was used by Buta (1995) to compile the Catalogue of
Southern Ringed Galaxies, and also by Schawinski et al. (2007), who visually classified 48,023
SDSS galaxies to identify a significant-sized sample of early-type galaxies for a study of the
connection between nuclear activity and star formation. In the latter study, visual interpretation
was argued to be needed to avoid bias against star-forming early-type galaxies which would
be excluded from color-selected samples. A major result of this study was the identification
of a time sequence whereby an early-type galaxy has its star formation suppressed by nuclear
activity, a manifestation of AGN feedback.
15.4 Isolated Galaxies
If interactions and mergers can have profound effects on galaxy morphology, then the mor-
phology of isolated galaxies clearly is of great interest. Such galaxies allow us to see how
internal evolution alone affects morphology, that is, what pure “nature” morphologies look like.
Karachentseva(1973) compiled a large catalogue (the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies, or CIG) of
1,050 isolated galaxies that has proven very useful for examining this issue.A galaxy of diameter
D is suggested to be isolated if it has no comparable-sized companions of diameter d between
D/4 and 4D within a distance of 20d. Verdes-Montenegro et al. (2005) show that this means
that an isolated galaxy 25 kpc in diameter, in the presence of a typical field galaxy velocity
of 150 km s−, has not been visited by a comparable mass companion during the past 3 Gyr.

78 1
Galaxy Morphology
These authors discuss the limitations of the CIG (e.g., the isolation criteria do not always work),
but in general it is the best source of isolated galaxies available.
Sulentic et al. (2006) examined all 1,050 CIG galaxies on Palomar II sky survey charts in
order to refine the sample and found that isolated galaxies cover all Hubble types. Of these, 14%
were found to be E/S0 types, while 63% were Sb-Sc types, with the spiral population more lumi-
nous than the E/S0 population. Over the type range Sa-Sd, the proportion rises to 82%. Thus,
an isolated galaxy sample is very spiral rich. Nevertheless, the presence of early-type galaxies in
the sample implies that these are not likely to be “nurture” formed, as such galaxies might be in
denser environments. The refinement of the CIG sample forms the basis of the Analysis of the
Interstellar Medium of Isolated Galaxies (AMIGA) project (Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2005).
>Figure 1-53 shows six examples of isolated Sb-Sc galaxies from the AMIGA sample, based
on SDSS color images. All of these look relatively normal, but it is interesting how nonbarred
galaxies like NGC 2649 and 5622 (upper left frames in > Fig. 1-53) show such conspicu-
ous global spirals, which argues that the spirals in these galaxies have not been excited by an
interaction.
Durbala et al. (2008) analyzed the photometric properties of 100 isolated Sb-Sc AMIGA
galaxies and found that a majority have pseudobulges rather than classical bulges. In comparing
the properties of isolated galaxies with a sample of Sb-Sc galaxies selected without an isolation
criterion, Durbala et al. found that isolated spirals have longer bars and, using CAS parameters,
also less asymmetry, central concentration, and clumpiness.

Durbala et al. (2009) analyzed the Fourier properties of the same set of 100 isolated spirals
and estimated bar lengths and strengths. Earlier types in the sample were found to have longer
and higher contrast bars than later types. Spiral arm multiplicities were investigated also, and it
was shown that cases having an inner m = 2 pattern and an outer m = 3 pattern occurred in 28%
of the sample. Elmegreen et al. (1992) argued that in such morphologies, the m = 3 pattern is
driven internally by the m = 2 pattern and that three-armed patterns measure the time elapsed
since an interaction.
15.5 Deep Field Color Imaging
Particularly interesting in the domain of color galaxy morphology are the various deep field
surveys that have been at the heart of high redshift studies. The most recent is the HST Wide
Field Camera 3 Early Release Science (ERS) data (Windhorst et al. 2011), which provides
very deep panchromatic images based on ten filters ranging from 0.2 to 2 µm in wavelength.
>Figure 1-54 shows three subsections of the main ERS field, which coincides with the GOODS
south field (Giavalisco et al. 2004). The galaxies seen range in redshift from z = 0.08 to at least
z = 3. Windhorst et al. (2011) argue that images like the ERS field are deep enough to allow
probing of galaxy evolution in the crucial redshift range z ≈1–3 where the galaxies assembled
into their massive shapes. By z ≈1, the Hubble sequence was largely in place. > Figure 1-54
shows a variety of interesting nearby as well as high z morphologies, including some of those
illustrated in >Fig. 1-46. Images like the ERS field allow us to connect the local and distant
galaxy populations in unprecedented detail.
16
Large-Scale Automated Galaxy Classiﬁcation
The process of galaxy classification thus far described is a manual exercise where an observer
attempts to sort a galaxy into its appropriate stage, family, variety, outer ring classification, etc.,
by visual inspection alone. For a small number of observers, this has been done for as many as
14,000 galaxies by Nair and Abraham (2010) and 48,000 galaxies by Schawinski et al. (2007),
while for a large number of observers working in concert (e.g., the Galaxy Zoo project), it has
been done for a million galaxies. But critical to such ventures is the preparation of images for
classification and a need for a homogeneous, objective approach to very large numbers of galax-
ies. This has led to extensive application of automated methods for classifying galaxies. For
example, Nair and Abraham (2010) visually classified galaxies into coded bins for the purpose
of training an automatic classification algorithm.
A variety of approaches have been used, ranging from “artificial intelligence” (neural net-
work) techniques (Odewahn et al. 1992; most recently Banerji et al. 2010) to the CAS approach
(Conselice 2003) and the Gini coefficient (Abraham et al. 2003), and to algorithms often used in
other disciplines such as the automated cell morphology code described by Shamir (2009). The
idea is to first classify a sample of galaxies by eye, use the algorithm to also classify them, and
then compare how well the algorithm results agree with the visual results. Often the goal with
automatic classification is not to automatically derive classifications such as “(R′)SB(r,nr)ab”
but simple distinctions of galaxies such as ellipticals, spirals, S0s, or edge-ons. Conselice et al.
(2004) in fact argue that automated classification should not focus on reproducing detailed de

Threesubsectionsfrom theWFC3-ERS survey of theGOODS-south ﬁeld (Windhorst et al. 2011). The
colors are based on images obtained with ten ﬁlters ranging from 0.2 to 2 µm
Vaucouleurs types, for example, but instead focus on more tangible properties like the degree
of central concentration, the degree of asymmetry, and the degree of patchiness, all of which in
a way can distinguish late-type galaxies from early-type galaxies (but not necessarily ringed or
barred galaxies from those lacking such features). The reason for such a view is that high red-
shift galaxy morphology usually does not have the benefit of the detail seen in nearby galaxies.
Van den Bergh (1998) discusses other issues connected with computer classifications, includ-
ing the limitations of artificial neural networks and the usefulness of objectively measured
parameters.

The Status and Future of Morphological Studies
The large number of illustrations in this chapter attests to the richness of the diversity of galaxy
morphology. It is, of course, not possible to illustrate all aspects of morphology that might be
worth discussing, but most interesting is how far physical galaxy morphology has come in the
35 years since Allan Sandage wrote his review of galaxy morphology in Volume IX of Stars and
Stellar Systems. Galaxy morphology is no longer the purely descriptive subject it once used to be.
Internal perturbations such as bars are apparently capable of generating a great deal of the
interesting structure we see in disk galaxies, and more theoretical and observational studies
should elucidate this further. The impact of bars on morphology seems well understood, as
summarized in detail by KK04 in their monumental review article on pseudobulges. Bars redis-
tribute angular momentum and reorganize gas clouds to flow into resonance regions and fuel
star formation. The gathering of gas into resonance regions can drive the formation of rings and,
indeed, can also build up the central mass concentration to the point of bar destruction. Even
failing this, the pileup of gas into the nuclear region can lead to the formation of a pseudobulge.
The richness of barred galaxy morphology attests to the strong role secular evolution plays in
structuring galaxies.
Progress in understanding the role of mergers and interactions on galaxy morphology has
also proceeded at a rapid pace. Great success in numerical simulations and the theory of inter-
acting galaxies has made it possible to link a specific type of interaction to a specific morphology
(e.g., collisional ring galaxies). The complexstructure ofearly-type galaxies, with boxyand disky
isophote shapes, shells and ripples, and other features, shows that interactions and mergers play
an important role in molding galaxies (see the excellent review by Schweizer 1998). With the
advent of the Hubble Space Telescope, this role has been elucidated even more clearly because
the merger rate was higher in the past.
In spite of the theoretical progress, it is interesting that classical morphology has not lost its
relevance or usefulness even after more than 80 years since Hubble published his famous 1926
paper. No matter how much progress in understanding the physical basis for morphology is
made, there is still a need for the ordering and insights provided by classical Hubble–Sandage–
de Vaucouleurs galaxy classifications. Morphology went through a low phase in the 1980s and
1990s when it was perceived that galaxy classification placed too much emphasis on unimpor-
tant details and was too descriptive to be useful. It was thought that the Hubble classification had
gone as far as it can go and that another approach needed to be tried to build a more physical pic-
ture of galaxies. At that time, there was a sense that the focus should be more on the component
“building blocks” ofgalaxies orwhat might be called galacticsubsystems (e.g., Djorgovski 1992).
Quantification of morphology became more possible as advanced instrumentation allowed
more detailed physical measurements to be made. In the end, as morphology became better
understood, it also became clear what a type such as “(R)SB(r)ab” might really mean, which
enhanced the value of classification (KK04). In addition, numerical simulations became sophis-
ticated enough to make predictions about morphology (e.g., the Rand Rsubclasses of outer
rings and pseudorings). These types of things, as well as the movement of morphology from the
photographic domain to the digital imaging domain, the broadening of the wavelength cover-
age available to morphological studies from the optical to the ultraviolet and infrared domains,
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the accessibility of high redshift galaxies to unprecedentedly
detailed morphological study, all played a role in bringing galaxy morphology to the forefront
of extragalactic research.

82 1
Galaxy Morphology
Even so, the writing of this chapter has shown that many important galaxies and classes of
galaxies have not been studied well enough to have much modern data available. For example,
in spite of the considerable interest in collisional ring galaxies the past 20 years or so, Struck
(2010) was forced to lament that ring galaxies “are underobserved.” The same can be said for
resonance ring galaxies, giant low-surface-brightness galaxies, dwarf spirals, Magellanic barred
spirals, counterwinding spirals, and other classes of interacting galaxies. The most that can be
said about this is that further studies will likely be made, especially if instrumentation facilitates
the objects in question. Rotation and dynamics are far short of photometry for most classes of
galaxies but would add a great deal of insight if obtainable.
At the other extreme, early-type (E and S0 galaxies) continue to be the focus of major pho-
tometric, kinematic, and theoretical research projects. Important clues to the formation and
evolution of such galaxies are contained in their intrinsic shapes (oblate, prolate, triaxial), in
the ages, metallicities, and radial mass-to-light ratios of their stellar populations, in their three-
dimensional orbital structure, and in the kinematic peculiarities often found in such systems
(de Zeeuw et al. 2002). Among the most recent studies are the massive photometric analy-
sis of early-types in the Virgo Cluster by Kormendy et al. (2009) and the ATLASD project
described by Cappellari et al. (2011). ATLASD is the largest kinematic database of high-quality
two-dimensional velocity field information ever obtained for early-type galaxies, including 260
such galaxies in a well-defined and complete sample. This survey is simply the latest part of
the long-term effort by many researchers, beginning in the 1980s, to understand early-type
galaxies in terms of quantitative parameters that can be tied to theoretical models. Early-types
have been a persistent enigma in morphological studies, and considerable evidence suggests
that the E, S0 sequence as defined by Hubble, Sandage, and de Vaucouleurs hides a great
deal of important physics associated with these objects. The ATLASD project was designed to
exploit the λR parameter described by Emsellem et al. (2007; see >Sect. 5.1), which separates
early-types into fast and slow rotators and discriminates galaxies along the red color sequence
(>Sect. 15.1).
Another interesting aspect of early-type galaxies is the frequent presence of nuclear stellar
disks, features from tens to hundreds of parsecs in diameter. These have been quantitatively
studied recently by Ledo et al. (2010), who argued that such disks could not survive a major
merger and their presence thus provides information on the assembly history of early-type sys-
tems. Ledo et al. found that such disks are present in 13–23% of early-types, and are rarer in the
most massive early-types, are most frequent in the absolute magnitude range MB = −18 to −20
and that there is little evidence for a correlation of the structures with galactic environment.
These advances for early-type galaxies do not mean that quantitative analyses of later-type
galaxies are lacking. As codes for two-dimensional photometric decomposition become ever
more sophisticated (e.g., Peng et al. 2010; Laurikainen et al. 2010 and references therein),
parameters that characterize the bulges, disks, bars, lenses, rings, and spiral patterns are
being derived for large numbers of galaxies (especially barred galaxies) that were not reliably
decomposable with earlier one-dimensional approaches.
For the future, it is to be hoped that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey will be extended to cover
the whole sky and provide access to high-quality morphological studies of several million more
galaxies, some of which might have new and exotic structures. The James Webb Space Telescope
should be able to carry the HST’s torch to greater depths and resolutions of high redshift galaxies
to further enhance our understanding of galaxy evolution.
Note added in manuscript: Since this chapter was completed, the placement of S0
galaxies in the Hubble tuning fork has seen its most serious challenge. As noted by

Galaxy Morphology 1

van den Bergh (1976, 1998), the properties of S0s do not support the idea of their being a
transition class between ellipticals and Sa, SBa galaxies. Van den Bergh proposed a “parallel
sequence” classification where S0s fall on a sequence S0a, S0b, and S0c parallel to the tuning fork
sequence Sa, Sb, Sc. The parallel S0s would represent environmentally transformed spiral types
ofdifferent bulge-to-total-luminosityratios. The idea did not take hold partlybecause ofthe lack
of any known cases of S0c galaxies, that is, very small bulge S0s, and because the relative impor-
tance of galaxy transformation was still being evaluated both theoretically and observationally
(the “nature vs. nurture” controversy). There was also the general “rule” that galaxy classification
should be independent of any particular theoretical idea (e.g., Sandage 2004, 2005).
Now, three studies have led to basically the same conclusion: the correct placement of
S0s is in a sequence parallel to spirals, not at the juncture of the tuning fork. Kormendy
and Bender (2012) proposed that Sph galaxies are environmentally transformed Magellanic
irregular galaxies and belong at the end of the parallel S0 sequence. Thus, parallel sequence clas-
sification provides a natural “home” for the enigmatic Sph galaxies that were long thought to be
dwarf versions of elliptical galaxies. The kinematic parameter λR from the ATLASD project also
led Cappellari et al. (2011) to conclude that the correct placement of S0s is parallel to spirals and
that the best way to order early-type galaxies is kinematically, not morphologically. Finally, both
Laurikainen et al. (2011) and Kormendy and Bender (2012) found examples of likely S0c galax-
ies, thus removing one of the early objections to the parallel sequence idea. Also, Laurikainen
et al. (2011 and references therein) used parameter correlations to conclude that S0s are
transformed spirals.
None of this completely negates the value of tuning fork classifications, because types such
as En, S0, S0, S0or E+n, S0−, S0○, and S0+ are still morphologically valid visual categories.
A galaxy maybe classified as type SA(rl)0+ and S0b, and the two classifications tell us something
different and complementary. The revisions to the tuning fork represent the coming to fruition
of quantitative and interpretive galaxy morphology.
This article is dedicated to Allan Sandage (1926–2010), one of the twentieth century’s
greatest astronomers, who helped set the stage for galaxy morphology to be one of the most
active fields of modern extragalactic research. It was Dr. Sandage’s efforts that firmly cemented
Hubble’s ideas on morphology into astronomy. The author is grateful to Dr. Sandage for the
inspiration he provided for this chapter and for his standard of excellence in astronomy.

Abstract:
A century ago, in 1911 and 1913, Plummer and then Reynolds introduced their
models to describe the radial distribution of stars in “nebulae.” This article reviews the progress
since then, providing both an historical perspective and a contemporary review of the stellar
structure of bulges, disks, and elliptical galaxies. The quantification of galaxy nuclei, such as
central mass deficits and excess nuclear light, plus, briefly, the structure of dark matterhalos and
cD galaxy envelopes, are discussed.Issues pertaining to spiral galaxies including dust, bulge-to-
disk ratios, bulgeless galaxies, bars, and the identification of pseudobulges are also reviewed. An
array of modern scaling relations involving sizes, luminosities, surface brightnesses, and stellar
concentrations are presented, many of which are shown to be curved. These “redshift zero”
relations not only quantify the behavior and nature of galaxies in the Universe today but are
the modern benchmark for evolutionary studies of galaxies, whether based on observations,
N-body simulations, or semi-analytical modeling. For example, it is shown that some of the
recently discovered compact elliptical galaxies at .< z < .may be the bulges of modern
disk galaxies.

Introduction
For the last century, astronomers have been modeling the structure of “nebulae,” and here, we
focus on those external to the Milky Way. A key activity performed by many astronomers, past
and present, is the categorization of these galaxies (Sandage 2005) and the quantification of their
physical properties. How big are they? How bright are they? What characteristics distinguish
or unite apparent subpopulations? Answers to such questions and the establishment of “scaling
relations” between two or more galactic properties provide valuable insight into the physical
mechanisms that have shaped galaxies.
Understanding how galaxies form, increasingly through the use of simulations and semi-
analytic modeling (e.g., Kauffmann et al. 2004; Di Matteo et al. 2005; Croton et al. 2006; Naab
et al. 2006; Nipoti et al. 2006; Covington et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2011; De Lucia et al. 2006; Bower
et al. 2006, and references therein), requires an accurate knowledge of galaxy properties and
scaling laws, as elucidated by Driver (2010). Not surprising, our knowledge of galaxies is best
in the nearby Universe – out to distances, typically measuredin megaparsecs rather than by red-
shift z, where galaxy structures can be reasonably well resolved. The properties of these galaxies
provide the z = benchmark used in the calibration of galactic evolutionary studies – both
observed and simulated.
Popular scaling relations involving global galaxy parameters such as size, surface brightness,
luminosity, and concentration are reviewed here. As we shall see, many bivariate distributions,
which are frequently assumed to be linear, are often only approximately so over a restricted
luminosity range. For example, the useful Kormendy (1977b) relation is only the tangent to
the bright arm of a continuous but curved effective radius-(surface brightness) relation which
unifies dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies (>Sect. 3.2.4). Similarly, the Faber and Jackson (1976)
relation with a slope of 4 represents the average slope over a restricted luminosity range to a

94 2
Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws
curved or broken luminosity-(velocity dispersion) distribution, in which the slope is 2 rather
than 4 at lower luminosities (>Sect. 3.3.3). Knowing these trends, the bulk of which cannot be
established when assuming structural homology, i.e., using de Vaucouleurs’ (1948) R/model,
is vital if one is to measure, model, and make sense of galaxies.
This article has been structured into four main sections. >Section 1 provides this general
overview plus a further review and introduction to galaxies on the Hubble-Jeans sequence.1
Included are diagrams showing the location of dynamically hot stellar systems in the mass-size
and mass-density plane, revealing that some high-z compact galaxies have properties equiva-
lent to the bulges of local disk galaxies. >Section 2 provides a historical account of how the
radial distribution of stars in elliptical galaxies has been modeled and the iterative steps leading
to the development of the modern core-Sérsic model (>Sect. 2.2). Subsections cover the Sérsic
model (>Sect. 2.1), its relation and applicability to dark matter halos (>Sect. 2.1.1), partially
depleted galaxy cores (>Sect. 2.2.1), excess nuclear light (>Sect. 2.3), and excess light at large
radii in the form of halos or envelopes around giant elliptical galaxies (>Sect. 2.4). >Section 3
presents and derives a number of elliptical galaxy scaling relations pertaining to the main body
of the galaxy. From just two linear relations which unite the faint and bright elliptical galaxy
population (>Sect. 3.1), a number of curved relations are derived (>Sect. 3.2). Several broken
relations, at MB ≈−.mag, are additionally presented in >Sect. 3.3. For those interested in
a broader or different overview of elliptical galaxies, some recent good reviews include Renzini
(2006), Cecil and Rose (2007), Ciotti (2009), and Lisker (2009). Finally, the latter third of this
chapter is tied up in >Sect. 4 which contains a discussion of the light profiles of disk galaxies
and their bulge-disk decomposition (>Sect. 4.1). Also included are subsections pertaining to
dust ( >Sect. 4.2), the difficulties with identifying pseudobulges ( >Sect. 4.3), potential bul-
geless galaxies (>Sect. 4.4), and methods to model bars (>Sect. 4.5). Throughout the article,
references to often overlooked discovery or pioneer papers are provided.
1.1 Early Beginnings
Looking out into the Milky Way arced across our night sky, the notion that we are residents
within a pancake-shaped galaxy seems reasonable to embrace. Indeed, back in 1750, Thomas
Wright also conjectured that we reside within a flat layer of stars which is gravitationally bound
and rotating about some center of mass. However, analogous to the rings of Saturn, he enter-
tained the idea that the Milky Way is comprised of a large annulus of stars rotating about a
distant center, or that we are located in a large thin spherical shell rotating about some divine
center (one of the galactic poles). While he had the global geometry wrong, he was perhaps the
first to speculate that faint, extended nebulae in the heavens are distant galaxies with their own
(divine) centers.
As elucidated by Hoskin (1970), it was Immanuel Kant (1755), aware of the elliptically
shaped nebulae observed by Maupertuis and working from an incomplete summary of Wright
(1750) that had been published in a Hamburg Journal,2 who effectively introduced the modern
concept of disklike galactic distributions of stars – mistakenly crediting Wright for the idea.
1This review does not encompass dwarf spheroidals, or any, galaxies fainter than MB ≈−. These galax-
ies cannot be observed (to date) at cosmologically interesting distances, and their increased scatter in the
color-magnitude relation may indicate a range of galaxy types (e.g., Penny and Conselice 2008, and references
therein).

Using his 1.83-m “Leviathan of Parsonstown” metal reflector telescope in Ireland, Lord
William Henry Parsons, the third Earl of Rosse, discovered 226 New General Catalogue3 (NGC:
Dreyer 1888) and 7 Index Catalogue (IC: Dreyer 1895, 1908) objects (Parson 1878). Important
among these was his detection of spiral structure in many galaxies, such as M51, which became
known as the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Further divisions into disk (spiral) and elliptical galaxy types followed (e.g., Wolf 1908;
Knox Shaw 1915; Curtis 1918; Reynolds 1920; Hubble 1926),4 and Shapley and Swope (1924)
and Shapley (1928) successfully identified our own Galaxy’s (gravitational) center toward the
constellation Sagittarius (see also Seares 1928).
With the discovery that our Universe contains redshifted “nebulae” that are expanding away
from us (de Sitter 1917; Slipher 1917; see also Friedmann 1922; Lundmark 1924, and the review
by Kragh and Smith 2003; Shaviv 2011), in accord with a redshift distance relation (Lemaitre
1927; Robertson 1928; Humasson 1929; Hubble 1929)5 – i.e., awareness that some of the “nebu-
lae” are external objects to our galaxy – came increased efforts to categorize and organize these
different types of “galaxy.” As noted by Sandage (2004, 2005), Sir James Jeans (1928) was the
first to present the (tuning fork)-shaped diagram that encapsulated Hubble’s (1926) early-to-
late-type galaxy sequence, a sequence which had been inspired in part by Jeans (1919) and later
popularized by Hubble (1936a; see Block et al. 2004). Quantifying the physical properties of
galaxies along this sequence, with increasing accuracy and level of detail, has occupied many
astronomers since. Indeed, this review addresses aspects related to the radial concentration
of stars in the elliptical and disk galaxies which effectively define the Hubble-Jeans sequence.
Irregular galaxies are not discussed here.
1.2 The Modern Galaxy
For reasons that will become apparent, this review uses the galaxy notation of Alan Sandage
and Bruno Binggeli, in which dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies are the faint extension of ordinary
and luminous elliptical (E) galaxies, and the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies – prevalent in
our Local Group (Grebel 2001) – are found at magnitudes fainter than MB ≈−to −14
(≈M⊙in stellar mass; see >Fig. 2-1a). >Figure 2-1a reveals a second branch of elliptically
shaped objects stretching from the bulges of disk galaxies and compact elliptical (cE) galaxies
to ultracompact dwarf (UCD) objects (Hilker et al. 1999; Drinkwater et al. 2000; Norris and
Kannappan 2011, and references therein). A possible connection is based upon the stripping of
a disk galaxy’s outer disk to form a cE galaxy (Nieto 1990; Bekki et al. 2001b; Graham 2002;
Chilingarian et al. 2009) and through greater stripping of the bulge to form a UCD (Zinnecker
et al. 1988; Freeman 1990; Bassino et al. 1994; Bekki et al. 2001a). It is thought that nucleated
dwarf elliptical galaxies may also experience this stripping process, giving rise to UCDs.
While the identification of local spiral galaxies is relatively free from debate, the situation
is not so clear in regard to elliptically shaped galaxies. The discovery of UCDs, which have
3The NGC built upon the (Herschel family’s) Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars (Herschel 1864).
4Reynolds (1927) called Hubble’s attention to preexisting and partly similar galaxy classification schemes which
were not cited.
5It is of interest to note that Hubble (1934, 1936b, 1937) was actually cautious to accept that the redshifts
corresponded to real velocities and thus an expanding Universe as first suggested by others. He used the term
“apparent velocity” to flag his skepticism. In point of fact, Hubble and Tolman (1935) wrote that the data were
“not yet sufficient to permit a decision between recessional or other causes for the red-shift.”

sizes and fluxes intermediate between those of galaxies and (i) the nuclear star clusters found
at the centers of galaxies and (ii) globular clusters (GCs, e.g., Ha¸segan et al. 2005; Brodie and
Strader 2006), led Forbes and Kroupa (2011) to try and provide a modern definition for what
a galaxy is (see also Tollerud et al. 2011). Only a few years ago, there was something of a divide
between GCs and UCDs – all of which had sizes less than ∼30 pc – and galaxies with sizes
greater than 120 pc (Gilmore et al. 2007). However, as we have steadily increased our celestial
inventory, objects of an intermediatenature have been found (e.g., Ma et al. 2007, their Table 3),
raising the question asked by Forbes and Kroupa for which, perhaps not surprisingly, no clear
answer has yet emerged. While those authors explored the notion of a division by, among other
properties, size and luminosity, they did not discuss how the density varies. As an addendum
of sorts to Forbes and Kroupa (2011), the density of elliptically shaped objects is presented here
in >Fig. 2-1b. This is also done to allow the author to wave the following flag.
Apparent in >Fig. 2-1b, but apparently not well recognized within the community, is that
the bulges of disk galaxies can be much denser than elliptical galaxies. If the common idea of
galaxy growth via the accretion of a disk, perhaps from cold-mode accretion streams, around a
pre-existing spheroid is correct (e.g., Navarro and Benz 1991; Steinmetz and Navarro 2002;
Birnboim and Dekel 2003; see also Conselice et al. 2011 and Pichon et al. 2011), then one
should expect to find dense spheroids at high z with –M⊙of stellar material, possibly
surrounded by a faint (exponential) disk which is under development. It is noted here that the

dense, compact early-type galaxies recently found at redshifts of 1.4–2.5 (Daddi et al. 2005; Tru-
jillo et al. 2006) display substantial overlap with the location of present day bulges in >Fig. 2-1a
and that the merger scenario to convert these compact high-z galaxies into today’s elliptical
galaxies is not without its problems (e.g., Nipoti et al. 2009; Nair et al. 2011). It is also noted that
well-developed disks and disk galaxies are rare at the redshifts where these compact objects have
been observed alongside normal-sized elliptical galaxies. Before trying to understand galaxy
structure at high redshift, and galaxy evolution – themes not detailed in this review – it is
important to first appreciate galaxy structures at z = , where observations are easier and local
benchmark scaling relations have been established.

Elliptical Galaxy Light Proﬁles
Over the years, a number of mathematical functions have been used to represent the radial
distribution of stellar light in elliptical galaxies, i.e., their light profiles. Before getting to de Vau-
couleurs’ R/modelin the following paragraph, it seems apt to first quickly mention some early
competitors. Although Plummer’s (1911) internal-density model was developedfor the nebulae
which became known as globular clusters, because of its simplicity, it is still used today by some
researchers to simulate elliptical galaxies, even though, it should be noted, no modern observers
use this model to describe the radial distribution of light in elliptical galaxies. Reynolds’ (1913)
surface-density model, sometimes referred to as Hubble’s (1930) model or the Reynold-Hubble
model,was used to describe the nebula which became known as elliptical galaxies. It has an infi-
nite mass and is also no longer used by observers today. The modified Hubble model (Rood et al.
1972), which also has an infinite mass, is also still sometimes used by simulators, even though,
again, observers do not use this model anymore. Oemler’s (1976) exponentially truncated Hub-
ble model, known as the Oemler-Hubble model, is alsonot used torepresent the observed stellar
distribution in elliptical galaxies because it too, like its predecessors, was simply an approxima-
tion applicable over a limited radial range, as noted by King (1978). It is interesting to note that
up until the 1980s, departures at large radii from the Reynolds model were attributed to tidal
stripping by external gravitational potentials. That is, for three quarters of a century, Reynolds’
model – originally developed from low-quality data for one galaxy – was generally thought to
describe the original, undisturbed stellar distribution in elliptical galaxies.
de Vaucouleurs’ (1948, 1953) R/surface-density model had traction for many years, in
part due to de Vaucouleurs (1959) arguing that it fits better than the Reynolds model used
by Hubble – a point reiterated by Kormendy (1977a) and others – and the revelation that it
fits the radially extended data for NGC 3379 exceedingly well (de Vaucouleurs and Capaccioli
1979). Hodge (1961a, b) had, however, revealed that de Vaucouleurs’ model was inadequate to
describe faint elliptical galaxies, and Hodge (1963, 1964), in addition to King (1962),6 noted
that the 3-parameter King model, with its flatter inner profile and steeper decline at large radii,
did a better job. For a time, King’s (1962, 1966) model became popular for describing the light
distribution in faint elliptical galaxies, at least until the exponential model – also used for the
disks of spiral galaxies – was noted to provide a good description of some dwarf elliptical galax-
ies (Hodge 1971; Faber and Lin 1983; Binggeli et al. 1984) and that these galaxies need not have

experienced any tidal truncation (a prescription of the King model with its tidal radius param-
eter). Lauer (1984, 1985) additionally showed that King’s modified isothermal model, with its
flat inner core, was inadequate to describe the deconvolved light profiles of ordinary elliptical
galaxies with “cores,” i.e., galaxies whose inner light profile displays a nearly flat core. King’s
model does, however, remain extremely useful for studies of star clusters, globular clusters,7
dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and galactic satellites which, unlike ordinary elliptical galaxies, can
have flat cores in their inner surface brightness profile.
Today, the model of choice for describing nearby (and distant) dwarf and ordinary elliptical
galaxies is Sérsic’s (1963) generalization of de Vaucouleurs’ R/model to give the R/n surface-
density model ( > Sect. 2.1). This model reproduces the exponential model when n = and
de Vaucouleurs’ model when n = ; it can thus describe the main body of faint and luminous
elliptical galaxies. The key advantage that this model has is (i) its ability to describe the observed
stellar distributions that have a range of central concentrations (known to exist since at least
Reaves 1956), and (ii) it provides a very good description of the data over (almost) the entire
radial extent. Indeed, departures in the light profile from a well-fit Sérsic’s model invariably
signal the presence of additional features or components, rather than any failing of the model.
Expanding upon the Sérsic model, the core-Sérsic model ( > Sect. 2.2) is nowadays used to
quantify those galaxies with “cores.”
Although referring to the King model, the following quote from King (1966) seems partic-
ularly insightful “…de Vaucouleurs’ law appears to refer to a particular central concentration
and should be appropriate only for galaxy profiles that have that concentration.” While noted by
others, such as Oemler (1976), Capaccioli (1985), Michard (1985), and Schombert (1986), some
three decades elapsed before the relevance of King’s remark to elliptical galaxies resurfaced –
albeit slowly at first – in the 1990s. Indeed, de Vaucouleurs’ useful, albeit limited, R/model
was referred to as a “law” for nearly half a century. However, we are now more keenly aware that
(even normal) elliptical galaxies possess a range of central concentrations: concentrations which
are well quantified in terms of the exponent n in Sérsic’s R/n model (see Trujillo et al. 2001;
Graham et al. 2001). Use of R/model parameters alongside some model-independent measure
of galaxy concentration is thus inconsistent, since every R/model has the same concentration.
Before introducing the equation for Sérsic’s model in the following section, it is pointed
out that in addition to modeling what can be considered the main body of the galaxy,
one can also find excess stellar light at (i) small radii in the form of nuclear (i.e., centrally
located) disks and dense nuclear star clusters ( > Sect. 2.3) and also at (ii) large radii in
the form of halos or envelopes in cD and central cluster galaxies ( > Sect. 2.4). As briefly
noted above, deficits of stellar flux at the cores of massive galaxies are also observed, and a
model to quantify these stellar distribution, relative to the outer nondepleted light profile, is
described in >Sect. 2.2. While nonsymmetrical components in elliptical galaxies can also exist,
they are not addressed here given the focus on well-structured systems. Somewhat random,
non-symmetrical components may be a sign of a disturbed morphology, of ongoing nonuni-
form star formation (See
>Chap. 3) or gravitationally induced tidal features from external
forces.
7The Wilson (1975) and Elson et al. (1987) model are also useful for describing globular clusters.

2.1 Sérsic’s Model
José Sérsic’s (1963, 1968) R/n model, which was introduced in Spanish, describes how the
projected surface-intensity I varies with the projected radius R, such that
I(R) = Ie exp{−bn [( R
Re
)
/n
−]}
(2.1)
and Ie is the intensity at the “effective” radius Re that encloses half of the total light from the
model (Ciotti 1991; Caon et al. 1993). The term bn (≈.n−.for.< n < , Capaccioli
1989) is not a separate parameter but is instead dependent on the third model parameter, n, that
describes the shape, i.e., the concentration, of the light profile.8 The exact value of bn is obtained
by solving the equation Γ(n) = γ(n, bn), where γ(2n,x) is the incomplete gamma function
and Γ is the (complete) gamma function (Ciotti 1991). Useful Sérsic-related expressions have
been presented in Ciotti (1991), Simonneau and Prada (2004), and Ciotti and Bertin (1999),
while Graham and Driver (2005) provide a detailed review of Sérsic’s model plus associated
quantities and references to pioneers of this model.
The relation between the effective surface brightness (μe = −.log Ie) and the central
surface brightness (μ= −.log I) is given by the expression
μe = μ+ .b,
(2.2)
where we have dropped the subscript n from the term bn for simplicity, while
⟨μ⟩e = μe −.log[ebnΓ(n)/bn]
(2.3)
gives the difference between the effective surface brightness and the mean effective surface
brightness (⟨μ⟩e) within Re. >Figure 2-2 shows the behavior of the Sérsic model.

revealed that the Sérsic R/n model provided a remarkably good description to the stellar dis-
tribution over a large radial range, down to surface brightnesses of ∼28 B-mag arcsec−, for the
early-type galaxies brighter than MB = −in the Virgo cluster. This work was in essence an

required different values of n (see also Bertin et al. 2002).
Importantly, Caon et al. (1993) additionally showed that a correlation existed between stel-
lar concentration, i.e., the Sérsic index n, and (model independent) galaxy size that was not
due to parameter coupling in the Sérsic model (see also Trujillo et al. 2001, their Sect. 2). One
implications of this result is that R/, and similarly Petrosian (1976), magnitudes, sizes, and
surface brightnesses are systematically in error as a function of galaxy concentration (Graham
et al. 2005; Hill et al. 2011). That is, application of a model which fails to adequately capture
the range of stellar distributions will result in parameters which are systematically biased as
a function of galaxy mass. For example, fitting an R/model to elliptical galaxies which are
actually described by an R/n model with n less than and greater than 4 will yield sizes and
luminosities which are, respectively, greater than and less than the true value (e.g., Binggeli and
Cameron 1991; Trujillo et al. 2001; Brown et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2008). Similarly, fitting an expo-
nential model to bulges that are best described by an R/n model with n less than and greater
than 1 will yield sizes and luminosities which are, respectively, greater than and less than the
true value (e.g., Graham 2001). Obviously, one does not want to fine tune galaxy simulations to
match scaling relations that contain systematicbiases due to poor measurements,and observers
are therefore busy fitting R/n models these days.
A good approximation to the internal-density profile associated with Sérsic’s model, i.e.,
with its deprojection, was introduced by Prugniel and Simien (1997). Useful expressions for
the dynamics, gravitational potential, and forces of this model have been developed by Trujillo
et al. (2002), Terzi´c and Graham (2005), and Terzi´c and Sprague (2007). Somewhat more com-
plex than the early light-profile models, such expressions can, importantly, accommodate a
range of concentrations, rather than only varying one scale radius and one scale density. Such a
model is vital if one wishes to properly simulate and understand the mass spectrum of elliptical
galaxies, whose Sérsic index n increases with stellar mass. As stressed by Graham and Driver
(2005), Sérsic’s model and the core-Sérsic model 0 ( >Sect. 2.2) have become key in unifying
and understanding the galaxies around us.
Like the majority of surface- and internal-density models from the last century, the Sérsic
function is an empirical model created to match data rather than developed from theory, and as
such, we should be cautious before calling it a law. Attempts to find a physical explanation for
de Vaucouleurs’ model yielded results which helped to keep it in vogue. Dissipational models
have long been touted for producing R/profiles (e.g., Larson 1969, 1974), and in the 1980s,
papers based on dissipationless N-body simulations of a cold clumpy collapse or the merger of
disk galaxies also claimed to finally produce R/(and also Reynolds) profiles (e.g., van Albada
1982; McGlynn 1984; Carlberg et al. 1986; Barnes 1988). However, a closer inspection reveals
clear departures from the R/profile, with the simulated profiles better described by an R/n
model with n < . Obviously, their inability (or perhaps lack of desire (although see Farouki
et al. 1983) whose nonhomologous merger remnants were initially criticized by R/aficiona-
dos) to create the range of stellar concentrations now observed in elliptical galaxies highlights
a limitation of these early works. These pioneering studies led to N-body simulations by
Nipoti et al. (2006) and Aceves et al. (2006) – and Farouki et al. (1983), whose results with

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws 2
101
a smaller force softening appeared years ahead of their time – which recover a range of Sér-
sic profile shapes for gravitational collapses in a dark matter halo and for disk galaxy mergers,
respectively.
Given the empirical nature of Sérsic’s R/n model, Hjorth and Madsen (1995) revealed how
dissipationless merging and violent relaxation provided a physical explanation for the departure
from the homologous R/model. Other works have explained how the quasi-constant-specific
entropy associated with the post violent-relaxation stage of elliptical galaxies results in the
observed mass-dependent range of stellar concentrations in elliptical galaxies (Gerbal et al.
1997; Lima Neto et al. 1999; Márquez et al. 2001).
Elliptical galaxies, whether built by near-monolithic collapse, collisions of disk galaxies, and
wet or dry mergers, appear to eventually experience the same force(s) of nature that results in
their radial stellar distribution depending on the total stellar mass. That is, it may not mat-
ter how the mass was accumulated into an elliptical galaxy; once it becomes a dynamically
heated, bound stellar system, it appears to eventually obey certain universal scaling relations
(see >Sect. 3).
It is interesting to note that Sérsic actually introduced his model as a way to parameterize
disk galaxies which he thought were comprised of differing ratios of a disk plus an R/bulge.
His model was not initially intended to fit elliptical galaxies, and as such it did not immedi-
ately threaten de Vaucouleurs’ model. Credit for popularizing the use of Sérsic’s R/n model
for approximating not only lenticular9 bulge + disk galaxies but for describing pure elliptical
galaxies resides largely with Massimo Capaccioli (e.g., Capaccioli 1985, 1987, 1989; Caon et al.
1993; D’Onofrio et al. 1994).10 However, Davies et al. (1988) had also introduced this model for
dwarf elliptical galaxies, while Sparks (1988) developed an early Gaussian seeing correction for
this model and Ciotti (1991) developed a number of associated expressions such as the veloc-
ity dispersion profile and a distribution function. The important quantification that Capaccioli
and others provided is how the radial distribution of stars in elliptical galaxies, i.e., their con-
centration, varies with the size, luminosity, and thus the mass of the elliptical galaxy (see also
Cellone et al. 1994; Vennik and Richter 1994; Young and Currie 1994, 1995; Graham et al. 1996;
Karachentseva et al. 1996; Vennik et al. 1996). As we shall see in this article, the implications
of this breakthrough have been dramatic, unifying what had previously been considered two
distinct species of galaxy, namely, dwarf and ordinary elliptical galaxies, previously thought to
be described by an exponential and R/model, respectively.
2.1.1 Dark Matter Halos
This section would be somewhat incomplete without a few words regarding the connection
between Sérsic’s model and (simulated) dark matter halos. While modified theories of gravity
may yet make dark matter redundant at some level, it is intriguing to note that the Prugniel and
Simien (1997) internal-density model, developed to approximate the deprojected form of Sér-
sic’s R/n model, additionallyprovides a verygood representation ofthe internal-densityprofiles
of simulated dark matter halos. Merritt et al. (2006) found that it actually provides a better
9This term was introduced by Knox Shaw (1915) and Reynolds (1920) in their galaxy classification scheme.
10It is worth noting that D’Onofrio (2001) remodeled the Virgo and Fornax two-component lenticular galaxies
with an R/n bulge plus an exponential disk (see >Sect. 4).

description than not only the Navarro et al. (1997) model but even a generalized NFW model
with an arbitrary inner profile slope γ.
Sérsic’s former student, Navarrro, independently applied Sérsic’s surface-density model to
the internal-density profiles of simulated dark matter halos (Navarro et al. 2004; Merritt et al.
2005). Jaan Einasto (1965) had previously developed this same function as Sérsic to describe
the internal-density profiles of galaxies. Rather than a universal profile shape, as advocated by
Navarro et al. (1997), a range of simulated dark matter density profile shapes is now known to
vary with the dark matter halo mass (Avila-Reese et al. 1999; Jing and Suto 2000; Merritt et al.
2005; Del Popolo 2010, and references therein). A number of useful expressions related to this
“Einasto model,” which has the same functional form as Sérsic’s model but is applied to the
internal rather than projected density profile, can be found in Cardone et al. (2005), Mamon
and Łokas (2005), and Graham et al. (2006).
An apparent “bulge-halo conspiracy” between the radial distribution of stellar mass and
dark matter (after modification by baryons) has arisen in recent years, such that elliptical galax-
ies reportedly have total internal-density profiles ρ(r) described by power laws (Bertin and
Stiavelli 1993; Kochanek 1995; Gavazzi et al. 2007; Buote and Humphrey 2011). These power
laws were originally claimed to be close to isothermal, such that ρ(r) ∝r−(Koopmans et al.
2006, 2009; Gavazzi et al. 2007). Recent work emphasizes that only the sample average profile
slope is close to −, and that a trend in slope with galaxy size exists (Humphrey and Buote 2010;
Auger et al. 2010). This is a developing field, and it is worth noting that the analyses have been
confined to massive galaxies; dispersions greater than ∼175 km s−and thus with Sérsic indices
n ≳(Graham et al. 2001). While the light profile shape changes dramatically as the Sérsic
index n increases from ∼1 to ∼4, there is not such an obvious change in light profile shape from
∼4 to higher values of n (see >Fig. 2-2). The apparent isothermal profiles of elliptical galaxies
and the alleged “bulge-halo conspiracy” may turn out to be a by-product of sample selection
(i.e., choosing galaxies which have approximately the same structure). It would be interesting
to expand the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey (Bolton et al. 2006) to a greater range than only
bright early-type galaxies that are approximately well fit with an R/model and to go beyond
the use of simple power-laws to describe the total mass density profile once the data allows this.
Two-component mass models (e.g., Prugniel-Simien plus Einasto or Burkert (1995) or Persic
et al. (1996), etc.) over a range of galaxy masses await. Claims that “early-type galaxies are struc-
turally close to homologous” may therefore be premature, as was the case for the distribution
of stellar light in elliptical galaxies while the R/model was thought to be a law.
Finally, although only mentioned here in passing, it is interesting to note that a number
of recent works have announced the existence of a constant surface-density core for real dark
matter halos of ∼solar masses per square parsec (e.g., Kormendy and Freeman 2004; Spano
et al. 2008; Donato et al. 2009).
2.2 The Core-Sérsic Model
The centers of luminous galaxies have long been known to possess “cores,” such that the surface-
density profile flattens at the center (e.g., King and Minkowski 1966), and King and Minkowski
(1972) remarked on the inability of the Reynold’s and de Vaucouleurs’ model to match these
flattened cores in giant galaxies. Although King (1978) identified a number of galaxies thought
to be well described by his model, using seeing-deconvolved ground-based images, Lauer
(1983, 1984, 1985) analyzed 14 galaxies with “cores,” ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 arcseconds in

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws 2
103
radius, revealing that they, like M87 (Young et al. 1978; Duncan and Wheeler 1980; Binney
and Mamon 1982), were not exactly described by the King model which had a completely flat
core. Similar conclusions, that cores existed but that they do not have flat inner surface bright-
ness profiles, were also reported by Kormendy (1982, 1985a), creating the need for a new model
to describe the stellar distribution in galaxies.
Nearly a decade later, the Hubble Space Telescope was flying and offered factors of a few
improvement over the best image resolution achievable from the ground at that time. Not sur-
prisingly, astronomers explored the centers of galaxies. In an effort to quantify these nuclear
regions, after the abandonment of the King model and the lack of a flattened core in the R/
model, Crane et al. (1993), Ferrarese et al. (1994), Forbes et al. (1994), and Jaffe et al. (1994)
used a double-power-law model to describe the inner light profiles of large galaxies. Grillmair
et al. (1994), Kormendy et al. (1994), and Lauer et al. (1995) also adopted a double power-law
model but one with an additional, fifth, parameter to control the sharpness of the transition.
Their model, which they dubbed the “Nuker law” for describing the nuclear regions of galaxies
(after excluding any apparent excess light), has the same functional form as the double power-
law model presented by Hernquist (1990, his (43)) to describe the internal density of galaxies
(Zhao 1996).
However, as noted by the above authors, these double power-law models were never
intended to describe the entire radial extent of a galaxy’s stellar distribution, and they pro-
vided no connection with the outer (R/like) radial profile. This disconnection turned out
to be their downfall. Due to the curved nature of the outer light profiles beyond the core, which
were being fitted by the double power-law model’s outer power law, the five parameters of the
Nuker model systematically changed as the fitted radial extent changed. This was first illustrated
in a number of diagrams by Graham et al. (2003) who revealed that none of the Nuker model
parameters were robust, and as such they could not provide meaningful physical quantities. For
example, Trujillo et al. (2004) reported that the Nuker-derived core-radii were typically double
and up to a factor of 5 times larger than the radius where the inner power-law core broke away
from the outer R/-like profile – a result reiterated by Dullo and Graham (2012). In addition,
these “break radii” were being identified in the so-called “power-law” galaxies that showed no
evidence of a downward departure and flattening from the inward extrapolation of the outer
R/-like profile. This situation arose because of the curved nature of what were actually Sérsic
profiles. That is, the so-called “power-law” galaxies not only had no distinct “core” like the “core
galaxies” do, but confusingly, they do not even have power-law light profiles. Recent analysis
using Nuker profiles has replaced the fitting parameters with a characteristic scale radius (rγ in
Lauer et al. 2007) which is defined nonparametrically by the profile slope. This makes the mea-
surement robust, although now the mathematical nature of rγ is quite different from previous
break radii.
Given that Caon et al. (1993) and D’Onofrio et al. (1994) had established that the Sérsic
function fits the brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies remarkably well over a large dynamic
range (see the figures in Bertin et al. 2002), it is possible to confidently identify departures from
these profiles that are diagnostic of galaxy formation. While in this and the following section
we deal with partially depleted cores – also referred to as “missing light” – in luminous galaxies
(thought to be built from dissipationless mergers, e.g., Khochfar and Burkert 2003), the ensuing
section addresses extra central light above the inward extrapolation of the outer Sérsic profile
(found in galaxies that have experienced dissipation and star formation).
Building on the work of Caon et al. (1993) and Graham et al. (2003) introduced the core-
Sérsic model, which was applied in Trujillo et al. (2004). The model represents a modification

104 2
Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws
to Sérsic’s model such that it has an inner power-law core. In contrast to the Nuker team’s (e.g.,
Kormendy et al. 1994; Lauer et al. 1995, 2005; Faber et al. 1997) combination of Nuker model
parameters for the core with R/model parameters for the main galaxy, Graham et al. (2003),
Graham and Guzmán (2003), Balcells et al. (2003), Graham (2004) and Trujillo et al. (2004)
advocated the measurement of core properties, excesses and deficits of light, measured relative
to the outer Sérsic model.
The core-Sérsic model provided an expression capable of unifying the nuclear regions of
galaxies with their outer regions and also providing stable physical quantities.11 The model can
be written as
I(R) = I′ [+ ( Rb
R )
α
]
γ/α
× exp{−b[(Rα + Rα
b)/Rα
e ]/(αn)}
(2.4)
where Rb denotes the break radius separating the inner power-law having logarithmic slope γ
from the outer Sérsic function. The intensity Ib at the break radius is such that
I′ = Ib−(γ/α) exp[b(/αRb/Re)/n] .
(2.5)
The sixth and final parameter, α, controls the sharpness of the transition between the inner
(power-law) and the outer (Sérsic) regime – higher values of α indicating a sharper transi-
tion. >Figure 2-3 shows the core-Sérsic model (with α = ) applied to NGC 3348.

to sample the curvature in the light profile; in practice, this requires radial data out to ∼Re.

Terzi´c and Graham (2005) and Terzi´c and Sprague (2007) provide a number of expressions
related to the potential, force, and dynamics.12 The core-Sérsic model is further discussed and
used by Ferrarese et al. (2006a, b), Côté et al. (2006, 2007), Kawata et al. (2007), and Ciotti
(2009).
2.2.1 Central Mass Deﬁcits
The collisional construction of galaxies from the merger of lesser galaxies is thought to be a
common occurrence in the Universe. Coupled with the presence of a supermassive black hole
(SMBH) at the heart of most galaxies (Wolfe and Burbidge 1970; Magorrian et al. 1998), dis-
sipationless mergers were proposed by Begelman et al. (1980; see also Ebisuzaki et al. 1991)
to explain the depleted nuclei, i.e., the cores, observed in giant elliptical galaxies (e.g., King
1978 and references therein). It is thought that core depletion is primarily due to the gravita-
tional slingshot (Saslaw et al. 1974) effect that coalescing binary SMBHs – from the pre-merged
galaxies – have on stars while they themselves sink to the bottom of the potential well of the
newly wed galaxy.13
Theory predicts that the central mass deficit Mdef should scale with .N Mbh, where Mbh
is the final (merged) black hole mass and N the number of major “dry” (i.e., gas free, dissi-
pationless) mergers (Milosavljevi´c and Merritt 2001; Merritt and Milosavljevi´c 2005; Merritt
2006a, b). Graham (2004) used the core-Sérsic model to quantify the central deficit of stars
relative to the inward extrapolation of the outer Sérsic profile. >Figure 2-4 suggests that the
luminous elliptical galaxies sampled have experienced an average of 1 or 2 major dry (i.e., dissi-
pationless) mergers, a conclusion in agreement with select ΛCDM models of galaxy formation
(Haehnelt and Kauffmann 2002; Volonteri et al. 2003).
Quantification of the central stellar deficit relative to the inward extrapolation of the outer
Sérsic profile has also been applied to bright Virgo cluster galaxies by Ferrarese et al. (2006a),
and Côté et al. (2007) and with the exception of VCC 798 – a lenticular (bulge plus disk) galaxy –
provides similar results. Of course, when an outer disk exists, a core-Sérsic bulge plus disk fit is
required, otherwise the disk will bias the Sérsic parameters.14
2.3 Excess Nuclear Light
While galaxies brighter than MB ∼−.have partially depleted cores (e.g., Faber et al. 1997;
Rest et al. 2001; Graham and Guzmán 2003), fainter galaxies often contain additional stellar
12The complex nature of this model has resulted in the appearance of alternate expressions, e.g., Spergel (2010,
see his Fig. 3) and Baes and Van Hese (2011).
13The presence of FUV −NUV color gradients in core galaxies such as NGC 1399 suggests that they may
not have been built from major, dry merger events (Carter et al. 2011). Additionally, the globular-cluster-
specific frequency in core galaxies may be at odds with core-galaxy formation through equal-mass merger
events because the fainter, intermediate luminosity elliptical galaxies may have lower specific frequencies
(Harris and van den Bergh 1981). Alternative ideas for core formation in giant galaxies have been proposed:
Boylan-Kolchin et al. (2004), Nipoti et al. (2006) and Martizzi et al. (2011).
14Trujillo et al. (2004) and Graham (2004) intentionally excluded lenticular galaxies from their publication
because it was felt that the community were not yet ready for an 8-parameter model (six core-Sérsic plus
two exponential-disk parameters). Intriguingly, VCC 798 resides near the 1-to-1 line in >Fig. 2-4 when an
exponential-disk plus (core-Sérsic) bulge fit is performed (Graham, unpublished work).

components at their centers. Such excess nuclear light, above that of the underlying host galaxy,
has long been known to exist (e.g., Smith 1935; Reaves 1956, 1977; Romanishin et al. 1977) and
was systematically studied by Binggeli et al. (1984), van den Bergh (1986), and Binggeli and
Cameron (1991, 1993) in a number of dwarf elliptical galaxies. As far back as Larson (1975),
it was known that simulations containing gas can account for these dense nuclear star clusters,
clusters which became easier to detect with the Hubble Space Telescope (e.g., Carollo et al.
1998).
For many years, it was common practice to simply exclude these additional nuclear compo-
nents from the analysis of the galaxy light profile (e.g., Lauer et al. 1995; Byun et al. 1996; Rest
et al. 2001; Ravindranath et al. 2001). Using HST data, Graham and Guzmán (2003) simultane-
ously modeled the host galaxy and the additional nuclear component with the combination of
a Sérsic function for the host galaxy plus a Gaussian function for the nuclear star cluster. As we
will see in >Sect. 4, they also showed that the lenticular galaxies in their early-type galaxy sam-
ple could be modeled via a Sérsic-bulge plus an exponential-disk plus a Gaussian-(star cluster)
decomposition of their light profile – as done by Wadadekar et al. (1999) with ground-based
images. Many other studies have since modeled the nuclear star clusters seen in HST images,
see >Fig. 2-5, with the combination ofa nuclearcomponent plus a Sérsichost galaxy(e.g., Grant
et al. 2005; Côté et al. 2006; Ferrarese et al. 2006a; Graham and Spitler 2009).
While Graham and Guzmán (2003) and Côté et al. (2006) found that some nuclear star
clusters could actually be resolved, it is not yet established what mathematical function best
describes their radial distribution of stars. The closest example we have to study is of course the
30 million solar mass nuclear star cluster at the center of the Milky Way (Launhardt et al. 2002).

ber of parameters, this model ﬁts both the inner, intermediate, and outer light proﬁle (Figure from
Dullo and Graham (2012))
from bulge stars. Although they found that the cluster could be well described by a Sérsic index
with n = (see >Fig. 2-6, it remains to be tested how well a King model can describe the data
or at least the old stellar population known to have a core (e.g., Genzel et al. 1996). The excess
nuclear light in M32 has also been well fit with an n = .Sérsic function (Graham and Spitler),
but this too may yet be better described by a King model. What is apparent is that neither the
underlying bulge nor the nuclear component is described by a power law. Theories which form
or assume such power-law cusps appear to be at odds with current observations.
2.4 Excess Halo Light
This section discusses starlight from extended galaxy halos as it is reflected in intensity profiles;
see
>Chap. 6 for a broader discussion of this component in the context of the evolution of
galaxies in dense cluster environments.
Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), residing close to or at the centers of large galaxy clusters,
have long been recognized as different from less luminous elliptical galaxies: their light profiles
appear to have excess flux at large radii (e.g., Oemler 1976; Carter 1977; van den Bergh 1977;
Lugger 1984; Schombert et al. 1986). However, before exploring this phenomenon, it is impor-
tant to recall that the light profiles of large galaxies have Sérsic indices n greater than 4 (e.g.,
Caon et al. 1993; Graham et al. 1996).15 Subsequently, at large radii in big elliptical galaxies,
there will be excess flux above that of an R/model fit to some limited inner radial range.
An initiallypuzzling result from the Sloan Digital SkySurvey(SDSS; York et al. 2000)was the
lack of light profiles with Sérsic n > –6 (Blanton et al. 2005a). This was however soon resolved
15As n →∞, the Sérsic model can be approximated by a power law (see Graham and Driver 2005).

when Blanton et al. (2005b), Mandelbaum et al. (2005), and Lisker (2005, 2006b, 2007) pointed
out a serious sky-subtraction problem with the early SDSS Photometric Pipeline (photo: Ivezi´c
et al. 2004). The sky value to be subtracted from each galaxy had been measured too close to
the galaxy in question, and because galaxies with large Sérsic indices possess rather extended
light profiles, their outer galaxy light was actually measured and then subtracted from these
galaxies. As a result, the high Sérsic index light profiles were erroneously erased and missed
from the SDSS. This resulted in the R/model appearing to provide good fits to bright elliptical
galaxies.
Bearing in mind that large elliptical galaxies have high Sérsic indices, it is important to dis-
tinguish between (i) an inadequacy of the R/model to describe what is actually a single R/n
profile and (ii) a distinct physical component such as an envelope of diffuse halo light surround-
ing a central galaxy. Early quantitative photometry of cD galaxies (supergiant D galaxies, e.g.,
Matthews et al. 1964; Morgan and Lesh 1965) suggested the presence of an inner R/spheroid
plus an outer exponential corona (de Vaucouleurs 1969; de Vaucouleurs and de Vaucouleurs
1970). One should however question if this outer corona is a distinct entity or not. To answer
this in the affirmative, astronomers can point to how the light profiles can display inflections
marking the transition from BCG light to intracluster light. Gonzalez et al. (2005) additionally
showed that the inflection in the light profiles of many BCGs was also associated with a change
in the ellipticity profile, signaling the switch from BCG light to intracluster light.
Gonzalez et al. (2005) and Zibetti et al. (2005) chose to model their BCG sample using
an R/+ R/model to describe the inner galaxy plus the outer halo light. However, given
that elliptical galaxies are better described by the R/n model, and the desire to measure the
actual concentration of halos rather than assign a fixed R/profile, Seigar et al. (2007) fitted

an R/n + R/n model to the light profiles of five BCGs. An R/n galaxy plus an exponential-
halo model was found to provide the optimal fit in three instances, with an additional galaxy
having no halo detected. The associated galaxy-to-halo luminosity ratios can be found there.
This exponential, rather than R/, behavior of the halo has been confirmed by Pierini et al.
(2008). Intriguing is that the halo does not trace the NFW-like dark-matterhalo density profiles
produced in ΛCDM simulations ( >Sect. 2.1.1). Stellar halos around non-BCG galaxies have
also now been reported to display an exponential radial distribution (e.g., Gadotti 2011; Tal and
van Dokkum 2011).

Structure-Related Scaling Relations
While it is common practice, and somewhat helpful, to call elliptical galaxies fainter than about
MB = −by the term “dwarf elliptical” (Sandage and Binggeli 1984), it should be noted, and
this section will reveal, that on all measures, they appear to be the low-mass end of a continuous
sequence which unifies dwarf and normal/luminous elliptical galaxies. Not only is this true
in terms of their structural properties (e.g., Binggeli et al. 1984; Graham and Guzmán 2003;
Gavazzi et al. 2005; Ferrarese et al. 2006a; Côté et al. 2006, 2007, 2008; Misgeld et al. 2008, 2009;
Janz and Lisker 2009; Graham 2010; Chen et al. 2010; Glass et al. 2011; Ry´s and Falcón-Barroso
2012) but even the degree of kinematically distinct components is similar (Chilingarian 2009).
There are many important relations between stellar luminosity, color, metallicity, age, and
dynamics that have already revealed a continuous and linear behavior uniting dwarf and giant
elliptical galaxies (e.g., Caldwell 1983; Davies et al. 1983; Binggeli et al. 1984; Bothun et al. 1986;
Geha et al. 2003; Lisker and Han 2008). However, Kormendy et al. (2009, their Sect. 8) argue
that these apparently unifying relations must not be sensitive to different physical processes,
which they believe produce a dichotomy between dwarf and ordinary elliptical galaxies. They
claim that it is only relations which show an apparent different behavior at the faint and bright
end that are sensitive to the formation physics, and the remainder are not relevant. This section
explains why such nonlinear relations are actually a consequence of the linear relations, and
as such, these nonlinear relations actually support a continuum between dwarf and ordinary
elliptical galaxies.
To begin, it should be reiteratedthat (dwarf and ordinary) elliptical galaxies – and the bulges
of disk galaxies (>Sect. 4.1) – do not have structural homology. Instead, they have a continuous
range of stellar concentrations – quantified by the Sérsic index n (Davies et al. 1988; Caon et al.
1993; D’Onofrio et al. 1994; Young and Currie 1994, 1995; Andredakis et al. 1995) – that varies
linearly with both stellarmass and central surface brightness (after correcting for central deficits
or excess light). A frequently unappreciated consequence of these two linear relations is that
relations involving either the effective half-light radius (Re) or the effective surface brightness
(μe), or the mean surface brightness within Re (⟨μ⟩e), will be nonlinear. Such curved relations
have often been heralded as evidence that two different physical processes must be operating
because the relation is not linear and has a different slope at either end. To further complicate
matters, sample selection which includes faint and bright elliptical galaxies, but excludes the
intermediate-luminosity population, can effectively break such continuously curved relations
into two apparently disconnected relations, as can selective colour-coding.
There are three distinct types of (two parameter) relations involving the properties of ellip-
tical galaxies: (i) linear relations which are taken to reveal the unified nature of dEs and Es,

110 2
Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws
(ii) curved relations revealing a continuity that had in the past been misinterpreted to indi-
cate that distinct formation process must be operating, and (iii) broken relations which do in
fact imply that two physical mechanisms are operating. In the following sections, we shall learn
how the linear relations result in the existence of curved relations when using effective radii
and surface brightnesses. We shall also see that the transition in the broken relations occurs at
MB ≈−.and thus has nothing to do with the previously held belief that dEs and Es are two
distinct species separated at MB = −(Wirth and Gallagher 1984; Kormendy 1985b, 2009).
3.1 Linear Relations
This section introduces two key relations, from which a third can be derived, involving struc-
tural parameters. They are the luminosity-concentration (L–n) relation and the luminosity-
(central density)16 (L–μ) relation. We shall use the Sérsic shape parameter n to quantify the
central concentration of the radial light profile and use the projected central surface brightness
μas a measure of the central density.17
It is noted that one can expect a certain level ofscatter in the L–n and L–μdiagrams because
both the central density and the radial concentration of stars that one observes depends upon
the chance orientation of one’s triaxial galaxy (Binney 1978). This is of course also true for
measurements of effective surface brightness, half-light radii, velocity dispersions, etc. To have
the best relations, it is important that we use Sérsic parameters from elliptical galaxies rather
than parameters from single-Sérsic fits to samples of elliptical and lenticular galaxies given the
two-component (2D disk plus 3D bulge) nature of the lenticular galaxies. Given the offset nature
of bulges and elliptical galaxies in the L–n diagram (e.g., Graham 2001; see also Möllenhoff and
Heidt 2001) it is also important that bulges not be combined in this section’s analysis of elliptical
galaxy scaling relations.
3.1.1 Luminosity-(Central Surface Brightness) Relation
Caldwell (1983; his Fig. 6) and Bothun et al. (1986, their Fig. 7) revealed that, fainter than MB ≈
−., there is a continuous linear relation between luminosity and central surface brightness.
Furthermore, Binggeli et al. (1984, their Fig. 11) and Binggeli and Cameron (1991, their Figs. 9
and 18) revealed that, when using the inward extrapolation of King models, the L–μrelation
is continuous and roughly linear from −> MB > −. This same general result was also
highlighted by Jerjen and Binggeli (1997) and Graham and Guzmán (2003) when using the
inward extrapolation of the outer Sérsic model. The benefit of this approach is that one’s central
surface brightness is not biased by the presence of a depleted core or any additional nuclear
components within the host galaxy. >Figure 2-7a displays the elliptical galaxy (MB, μ) data
set from Graham and Guzmán (2003) fit by the expression
MB = .μ,B −..
(2.6)
16Here the “central density” refers to the density prior to core depletion in giant elliptical galaxies or the growth
of additional nuclear components in smaller elliptical galaxies.
17To convert from the surface density to the internal density, one can use (4) from Terzi´c and Graham (2005).

The actual central surface brightness of the luminous “core galaxies” is shown in >Fig. 2-7a,
rather than the value obtained from the inward extrapolation of their outer Sérsic profile. As
such, these “core galaxies” were excluded from the fit, but see the discussion in >Sect. 3.3. As
an aside, if the central supermassive black hole mass Mbh in elliptical galaxies is directly related
to the central stellar density (see Graham and Driver 2007), then the connections between Mbh
and the global galaxy properties, such as total mass and velocity dispersion, may be secondary.
3.1.2 Luminosity-Concentration Relation
The linear relation between luminosity and Sérsic index, or strictly speaking the logarithm of
these quantities, has been shown many times (e.g., Young and Currie 1994; Jerjen and Binggeli
1997; Graham and Guzmán 2003; Ferrarese et al. 2006a). This continuous relation between
magnitude and concentration18 for elliptical galaxies had of course been recognized before (e.g.,
Ichikawa et al. 1986, their Fig.11). The following MB–n expression is shown in >Fig. 2-7c, again
matched to the sample of elliptical galaxies compiled by Graham and Guzmán (2003).
MB = −.log(n) −..
(2.7)
18Graham et al. (2001) contains a review of various concentration indices used over the decades, while Trujillo
et al. (2001) was the first to quantify the monotonic relation between Sérsic index and concentration.

112 2
Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws
Graham and Guzmán (2003) excluded two-component lenticular galaxies fit by others with a
single-component Sérsic model. It may be prudent to continue to exclude these galaxies even
after a Sérsic-bulge plus exponential-disk fit because the MB–n relation defined by bulges, at
least in spiral galaxies, is different from that defined by elliptical galaxies (Graham 2001, his
Fig. 14).
3.1.3 Concentration-(Central Surface Brightness) Relation
Combining the above two equations provides an expression between central surface brightness
and Sérsic index such that
μ= .−.log(n),
(2.8)
which is shown in >Fig. 2-7b, where it can be seen to be roughly applicable for values of n ≳.
3.2 Curved Relations
As a direct result of the above linear relations – which unite dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies –
expressions involving either the effective half-light radius Re, the associated effective surface
brightness μe at this radius, or the mean surface brightness ⟨μ⟩e enclosed within this radius,
are curved.
3.2.1 Luminosity-(Eﬀective Surface Brightness) Relation
The following analysis is from Graham and Guzmán (2003).
Given the empirical MB–n relation (> 2.7), one knows what the expected value of n is for
some value of MB. One can then convert the empirical MB–μrelation ( > 2.6) into an MB–
μe relation using the exact relation between μand μe which depends only on the value of n
(> 2.2). Doing so, one obtains the expression
μe = .MB + .+ .b,
= .[MB + .] + .+ .b,
(2.9)
where b ≈.n −.and ( > 2.7) is used to replace n in terms of MB, such that
n = −(.+MB)/..
One can similarly convert the empirical MB–μrelation (> 2.6) into an MB–⟨μ⟩e relation
using the exact relation between μand ⟨μ⟩e which also depends only on the value of n (>2.3).
Doing this, one obtains the expression
⟨μ⟩e = .MB + .+ .b −.log[ebnΓ(n)
bn
],
(2.10)
where again b ≈.n −.and (> 2.7) is used to replace n in terms of MB. These curves
can be seen in >Fig. 2-8 (adapted from Graham and Guzmán 2004).
Binggeli et al. (1984, their Fig. 8) and Capaccioli and Caon (1991) previously showed with
empirical data that the MB–⟨μ⟩e relation is curved. What was new in Graham and Guzmán
(2003) was the explanation. In the past, evidence of non-linear relations involving parameters
from dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies were heralded as evidence of a dichotomy. Galaxy

arises from the rough ﬁtting by eye of the linear relations (The data points have come from the
compilation by Graham and Guzmán (2003, their Fig. 9))
sample selection that excluded the intermediate population, and therefore resulted in twoappar-
ently disconnected relations, acted to further convince some that they were dealing with two
classes of object.19
3.2.2 Size-Luminosity Relation
Now that we know how to play this game, one can additionally make predictions for relations
involving the effective radius Re because we know that the luminosity L = π⟨I⟩eR
e, with ⟨μ⟩e =
−.log⟨I⟩e. As explained in Graham and Worley (2008, their Sect. 5.3.1), one can derive the
size-luminosity relation such that
log Re[kpc] = MB

(2.11)
for .< n < , with b ≈.n −.and where (> 2.7) is used to replace n in terms of
MB. This size-luminosity relation for elliptical galaxies is shown in >Fig. 2-8c along with real
galaxy data.
Binggeli et al. (1984, theirFig. 7; cf. Misgeld and Hilker2011, theirFig. 7)alsodemonstrated,
with empirical data that the L −Re relation for dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies is curved.
Their diagram, in addition to > Fig. 2-8c seen here, reveals why studies which only sample
bright elliptical galaxies are often content to simply fit a straight line (e.g., Kormendy 1977b).
The explanation for why this happens is of course akin to approximating the Earth as flat when
one (forgivably) does not sample enough of what is actually a curved profile. As Graham et al.
(2006, their Fig. 1b) re-revealed recently, and as reiterated by Bernardi et al. (2007), a sample of
massive elliptical galaxies will have a steeper size-luminosity relation than a sample of ordinary
19A simple one-dimensional example of sample bias would be a survey of the average physical properties, such
as size or mass, of people at a primary school. One would measure the properties of children and adults but
miss the bridging population which reveals a continuity and thus unification of the species.

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws
elliptical galaxies, which will in turn have a steeper size-luminosity relation than a sample of
dwarf elliptical galaxies because the size-luminosity relation is curved. Graham and Worley
(2008) explains why the L −Re relation given by (> 2.11), based on two linear relations and the
functional form of Sérsic’s model, is curved.
Due tothe linearrelations between magnitude, central surface brightness, and the logarithm
of the Sérsic exponent n, the use of faint isophotal radii results in what is roughly a linear size-
luminosity relation (e.g., Oemler 1976; Strom and Strom 1978; Forbes et al. 2008, their Fig. 3;
van den Bergh 2008; Nair et al. 2011), with the bright-end slope dependent on the adopted
isophotal limit or Petrosian radius used. The implications of this important observation shall
be detailed elsewhere.
Helping to propagate the belief that dwarf and ordinary elliptical galaxies are distinct
species, Dabringhausen et al. (2008) and Lisker (2009) fit a double power law to their curved
size-luminosity relation for dwarf and ordinary elliptical galaxies, thus yielding distinct slopes
at the faint and bright end. In addition, the interesting study by Janz and Lisker (2008) reported
small deviations from the predicted curved relation. However, galaxies that are well described by
Sérsic’s function and which follow linear M–n and M–μrelations must follow a single-curved
M–Re relation. The deviations that they found are therefore mirroring (a) the inadequacy of the
fitted linear relations to the M–n and M–μdistribution (noted in the caption of >Fig. 2-8)
and/or (b) poorly fitting Sérsic models to their sample of elliptical and disk galaxies. Adding
uncertainties to the linear relations in
> Sect. 3.1, and propagating those through to the
predicted M–Re relation, is required before we can claim evidence of significant deviations.
However, searching for such second-order effects may indeed be interesting given the different
types of dwarf galaxies that are emerging (Lisker et al. 2007).
3.2.3 Size-Concentration Relation
One can additionally derive an expression relating Re and n by substituting the magnitude from
the empirical MB–n relation, expressed in terms of n (> 2.7), into the size-luminosity relation
(> 2.11) to give
log Re[kpc] = .n −.−.log(n)
+.log [
bn
ebnΓ(n)].
(2.12)
While the MB–n relation is linear, the Re–n relation is curved, as can be seen in >Fig. 2-9.
In passing, it is noted that the form of this relation ( > 2.12) matches the bulge data from
Fisher and Drory (2010, their Fig. 13). They interpret the departure of the low-n bulges (n < )
from the approximately linear relation defined by the high-n bulges (n > ) to indicate that a
different formation process is operating to produce the less concentrated “pseudobulges.” How-
ever, based upon linear unifying relations that span the artificial n = divide, we know that this
Re–n relation must be curved. Without an understanding of this relation, and other curved
relations (e.g., Greene et al. 2008), they have at times been misinterpreted and used to claim the
existence of different physical processes (see >Sect. 4.3 for a discussion of pseudobulges, and
Hohl (1975) and references therein).
It may be worth better defining the behavior of the Re–n relation at small sizes in >Fig. 2-9.
The data from Davies et al. (1988) suggests than when n = ., values of Re may range from
1 kpc down to 0.2 kpc (Caon et al. 1993, their Fig. 5). Such a reduction to the flattening of the

Re–n distribution, below n ≈, may in part arise from the inclusion of dwarf spheroidal galaxies
(see Misgeld and Hilker 2011, their Fig. 1).
3.2.4 Size-(Eﬀective Surface Brightness) Relation
As discussed in Graham (2010), the first two linear relations in >Fig. 2-7 naturally explain the
curved ⟨μ⟩e–Re relation in >Fig. 2-10. From the empirical μ–n relation ((>2.8), >Fig. 2-7b),
one can convert μinto ⟨μ⟩e using ( > 2.2) and ( > 2.3). The effective radius Re is acquired
by matching the empirical MB–μrelation ((> 2.6), >Fig. 2-7a) with the absolute magnitude
formula
M = ⟨μ⟩e −.log(πR

(see Graham and Driver 2005, their (12)). Eliminating the absolute magnitude gives the

(2.14)
in which we already know the value of n associated with each value of ⟨μ⟩e. This is achieved by
(again) using the empirical μ–n relation (> 2.8) with (> 2.2) and (> 2.3), such that

parameters, is a curved relation that is shown in >Fig. 2-10. Overplotted this predicted relation

For those who may have the Sérsic parameter set (Re, μe, n), one can use (> 2.3) to convert
μe into ⟨μ⟩e if one wishes to compare with the relation given by (> 2.14). For those who may

⊡Fig. 2-10
Due to the observed linear relations in >Fig. 2-7, the relation between the eﬀective radius (Re) and
the mean surface brightness within this radius (⟨μ⟩e) is highly curved for elliptical galaxies. The

(2.16)
where the value of n associated with the value of μe is given by
μe = .+ .b −.log(n).
(2.17)
To summarize, due to the linear relations in >Fig. 2-7 which connect dwarf and ordinary
elliptical galaxies across the alleged divide at MB = −(Kormendy 1985b), or at n = (Kor-
mendy and Kennicutt 2004), coupled with the smoothly varying change in light profile shape
as a function of absolute magnitude, the ⟨μ⟩e-Re and μe-Re relations are expected to be curved
(>Fig. 2-10), as previously shown with empirical data by, e.g., Capaccioli and Caon (1991). This
also explains why the fitting of a linear relation to (Re, μe) data by Hoessel et al. (1987) resulted
in slopes that depended on their galaxy sample magnitude.
The Kormendyrelation is a tangent tothe bright arm ofwhat is actuallya curved distribution
defined by the relation given by ( > 2.14) that is taken from Graham (2010). The apparent
deviant nature of the dwarf elliptical galaxies from the approximatelylinear section of the bright
end of the ⟨μ⟩e-Re distribution does not require that a different physical process be operating.
Moreover, as noted by Graham and Guzmán (2004) and Graham (2005), galaxies which appear
to branch off at the faint end of the Fundamental Plane (Djorgovski and Davis 1987) – the flat
portion at the bright end of a curved hypersurface – also need not have formed from different
physical mechanisms. Simulations that assume or reproduce a linear ⟨μ⟩e-Re or μe-Re relation,

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws 2
117
across too great a magnitude range, have failed to mimic the continuous curved distribution
defined by real elliptical galaxies. The same is true for simulations of the “Fundamental Plane.”
3.3 Broken Relations
3.3.1 Luminosity-(Central Surface Brightness) Relation
While the relation between a galaxy’s absolute magnitude and extrapolated central surface
brightness is remarkably linear (>Sect. 3.1.1), there is a clear break in this relation when using
the actual central surface brightness at the luminous end of the distribution (>Fig. 2-7a). This
departure from the MB-μrelation by elliptical galaxies brighter than MB ≈−.(M > .–
× M⊙) was addressed by Graham and Guzmán (2003) in terms of partially depleted cores
relative to the outer Sérsic profile (see also Graham 2004; Trujillo et al. 2004; Merritt and
Milosavljevi´c 2005; Ferrarese et al. 2006a; Côté et al. 2007). This transition has nothing to do
with the alleged divide between dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies at around MB = −, but is
instead directly related with the Sérsic versus core-Sérsic transition at around MB = −..
As noted in >Sect. 2.2.1, such partially depleted cores in luminous core-Sérsic galaxies are
thought to have formed from dry, dissipationless galaxy merger events involving the central
coalescence of supermassive black holes (Begelman et al. 1980; Ebisuzaki et al. 1991; but see
footnote 13) and resulted in Trujillo et al. (2004) advocating a “new elliptical galaxy paradigm”
based on the presence of a central stellar deficit versus either none or an excess of light, an
approach embraced by Ferrarese et al. (2006a) and Côté et al. (2007), and others.
Further evidence for a division at MB = −.comes from the tendency for the brighter
galaxies to be anisotropic, pressure supported elliptical galaxies having boxy isophotes, while
the less luminous early-type galaxies may have disky isophotes and often contain a rotating
disk (e.g., Carter 1978, 1987; Davies et al. 1983; Bender et al. 1988; Peletier et al. 1990; Jaffe et al.
1994). Core galaxies also tend to be more radio loud and have a greater soft X-ray flux (e.g.,
Ellis and O’Sullivan 2006; Pellegrini 2010; Richings et al. 2011, and references therein).
It was, in part, a diagram of central surface brightness versus magnitude that led
Kormendy (1985b, his Fig. 3) to advocate a separation of dwarf and normal elliptical galaxies at
MB = −mag. However, as noted by Graham and Guzmán (2003), his sample was miss-
ing the bridging population near MB = −± mag. Excluding galaxies of this magnitude
from >Fig. 2-7a would also result in two apparently disjoint relations nearly at right angles
to each other. Strom and Strom (1978, their Fig. 8; see also Binggeli et al. 1984) had already
shown that a linear relation exists between magnitude and central surface brightness from
−.< MV < −., spanning the magnitude gap in Kormendy (1985b). Nonetheless,
Faber and Lin (1983) had just observed that three of their six dwarf elliptical galaxies had
near-exponential light profiles, leading them to speculate that dEs are more closely related
to “exponential systems” than (tidally truncated) elliptical galaxies, and Wirth and Gallagher
(1984, see also Michard 1979) had also just advocated a division between exponential-dwarf
and R/-giant elliptical galaxies.
To further confound matters, a slope error in Kormendy (1985b) for the distribution of
dwarf elliptical galaxies in the M–μplane meant that, first, the bright end of his dwarf ellip-
tical galaxy distribution did not point toward the faint end of his luminous elliptical galaxy
distribution, and thus, there was no suggestion of a connection. Consequences are still seen
today (e.g., Tolstoy et al. 2009, their Fig. 1), although Kormendy et al. (2009) have now cor-
rected this. Second, two points representing flattened disk galaxies were added at the bright end

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws
of the misaligned dwarf elliptical galaxy sequence by Kormendy (1985b), implying a connection
between dwarf elliptical galaxies and disk galaxies rather than ordinary elliptical galaxies.
A decade later, the Astronomy and Astrophysics Review paper by Ferguson and Binggeli
(1994; theirFig. 3)had a big question mark as to“how” and indeed “if” dwarfand ordinaryellip-
tical galaxies might connect in this diagram. When galaxies spanning the gap in Kormendy’s
(1985b) analysis were included by Faber et al. (1997, their Fig. 4c) and shown to follow a trend
consistent with the relation from Strom and Strom (1978) and Binggeli et al. (1984), in which
the central surface brightness became fainter with decreasing galaxy luminosity, Faber et al.
(1997) suggested that this behavior in their data was spurious and due to limited resolution,
still using a paradigm in which a discontinuity separated dwarf and ordinary elliptical galax-
ies. At the same time, Jerjen and Binggeli (1997) argued exactly the opposite, suggesting that it
was instead the “core” galaxies which had been displaced in the M–μdiagram from a linear
M–μrelation rather than wrong central surface brightness measurements for the faint (non-
dwarf) elliptical galaxies. As Graham and Guzmán (2003) and Graham (2004) later explained,
in terms of a ∼0.1% central mass deficit relative to the outer Sérsic profile in galaxies brighter
than MB ≈−., Jerjen and Binggeli (1997) were right, supporting the views expressed by
Binggeli et al. (1984) on a continuity between dwarf elliptical and ordinary elliptical galaxies
across the alleged divide at MB ≈−.
An Alternate View
Before continuing, two points regarding the M−μdiagram in Kormendy et al. (2009, their
Fig. 34) should perhaps be made. First, Kormendy et al. (2009) have again introduced an appar-
ent gap in their diagram by using only nine galaxies from Binggeli et al.’s (1985) Virgo Cluster
Catalog within the magnitude range MV = −±. Obviously, other elliptical galaxies exist with
magnitudes over this range, and the HST data in Faber et al. (1997, their Fig. 4c) reveals that
these “gap galaxies” – which they identify as “power-law galaxies” – extend the linear M −μ
relation defined by the dwarf elliptical galaxies (e.g., Jerjen and Binggeli 1997, their Fig.3). Faber
et al. (1997) did note that these galaxies may have dense, unresolved nuclear components which
might increase their central surface brightness and erase this connection. However, the central
surface brightness of the Sérsic model describing the host galaxy is not significantly different
from that shown in their figure, and as such their speculation, which may be valid, is not actually
relevanthere as we are interestedin the host galaxy unbiased by additional nuclear components.
The second issue regarding Kormendy et al.’s (2009) M–μdiagram is that they have
included M32, NGC 4486B plus 4 other “compact elliptical” galaxies fainter than MV = −
(VCC 1199, VCC 1627, VCC 1440, and VCC 1192; see Binggeli et al. 1985, their Table XIII).
They claim that these objects, rather than the non-compact elliptical galaxies without partially
depleted cores, define the faint end of the elliptical galaxy sequence. Compact elliptical galax-
ies were once thought to be small elliptical galaxies because they were, like bright ellipticals,
thought to have R/-like light profiles. However, the bulge-disk nature of M32, the prototype
“compact elliptical” which resides close to M31, reveals that it is likely a stripped S0 galaxy
(Nieto 1990; Bekki et al. 2001b; Graham 2002) as does the age of its stellar population (Davidge
and Beck 2008).20 Further analysis of other nearby “compact elliptical” galaxies has reaffirmed
their bulge/disk nature (e.g., Smith Castelli et al. 2008; Chilingarian et al. 2009; Price et al. 2009;
20We speculate that some old, “free-flying” “compact elliptical” galaxies may be the descendants of the compact
galaxies seen at .< z < .which simply never accreted and built a significant cold disk (e.g., Kereš et al.
2005).

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws 2

Huxor et al. 2011). An analysis using CCD data (Graham 2002), rather than the older photo-
graphic data used in Kormendy et al. (2009), to define the outer light profile of M32 results
in parameters which do not position it at the extension of the core-galaxy distribution in the
M–μdiagram.
From the light profile data for VCC 1199 (Kormendy et al. 2009, their Figure 24), a galaxy
with the bright companion M49, one can see the bulge/disc transition at 5 arcseconds in
the position angle, ellipticity and colour profiles. From the light profile data for VCC 1627
(Kormendy et al. 2009, their Figure 24), one can again see a transition in the position angle and
ellipticity profiles, while the colour profile has been truncated. The significant ordered struc-
ture in their data minus Sérsic model residual profile reveals the mismatched inner profile
shape (evident as the hump out to 13 arcseconds) followed by excess light out to 28 arcsec-
onds. This behaviour is also displayed in the residual profile for VCC 1440, with a transition at
about 6 arcseconds, where the ellipticity and position angle also change (Kormendy et al. 2009,
their Figure 23). Lastly, there is again clear evidence of this same structure in both VCC 1192’s
HST/ACS light profile (Kormendy et al. 2009, their Figure 23), another galaxy which resides
close to M49, and in NGC 4486B’s light profile (Kormendy et al. 2009, their Figure 22), a galaxy
which resides close to M87. All of this is suggestive of a bulge/disc nature for these additional
“compact elliptical” galaxies.
3.3.2 Luminosity-Color Relation
Additional support for the dissipationless dry-merging scenario at the high-mass end is the flat-
tening of the color-magnitude relation above 0.5–1 × M⊙. While low luminosity, low Sérsic
index, elliptical galaxies are bluer than bright elliptical galaxies (e.g., de Vaucouleurs 1961; Webb
1964; Sandage 1972; Caldwell and Bothun 1987), the brightest galaxies have the same color as
each other. This flattening in the color-magnitude relation was noted by Tremonti et al. (2004)
and is evident in Baldry et al. (2004, their Fig. 9), Ferrarese et al. (2006a, their Fig. 123), Boselli
et al. (2008, their Fig. 7), and even Metcalfe et al. (1994). These observations help alleviate past
tension with semi-analytic models that had predicted a relatively flat color-magnitude relation
for bright elliptical galaxies (e.g., Cole et al. 2000). Previously, based on what was thought to
be a linear color-magnitude relation, Bernardi et al. (2007) had written that “if BCGs formed
from dry mergers, then BCG progenitors must have been red for their magnitudes, suggesting
that they hosted older stellar populations than is typical for their luminosities.” However, the
flattening in the color-magnitude relation has since been recognized in yet more data sets (e.g.,
Skelton et al. 2009; Jiménez et al. 2011), although it should perhaps be noted that Skelton et al.
reported the transition at MR = −, i.e., ∼1 mag fainter.
In passing, it is noted that the relation between luminosity and supermassive black hole
mass (Marconi and Hunt 2003; McLure and Dunlop 2004) as refined by Graham (2007) shows
a linear relation for black hole masses predominantly greater than M⊙– consistent with the
concept of dry galaxy merging at this high-mass end.
3.3.3 Dynamics
From a sample of 13 early-type galaxies, plus one spiral galaxy, Minkowski (1962) noted that a
“correlation between velocity dispersion and (luminosity) exists, but it is poor.” He wrote that

120 2
Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws
“it seems important to extend the observations to more objects, especially at low and medium
absolute magnitudes.” This was done by Morton and Chevalier (1973) who noted the same “con-
tinuous distribution of dispersions from 60 km/s for M32 to 490 km/s for M87” but also did
not attempt to quantify this trend. It was Faber and Jackson (1976) who, with improved data
and a larger sample of 25 galaxies, were the first to quantify Minkowski’s relation and discov-
ered that L ∝σ for their data set. This result has proved extremely popular and is known as
the Faber-Jackson relation. Not long after this, Schechter (1980) and Malumuth and Kirshner
(1981) revealed that the luminous elliptical galaxies followed a relation with an exponent of ∼5
rather than 4. At the same time, Tonry (1981) revealed that expanding the sample to include
more faint elliptical galaxies results in an exponent of ∼3. This led Binney (1982) to write that
“probably the correlation cannot be adequately fitted by a single power law over the full range
of absolute magnitudes,” and Farouki et al. (1983) wrote that “the data suggests the presence of
curvature in the L−σ relation.” Davies et al. (1983), and later Held et al. (1992), showed that the
dwarf elliptical galaxies followed a relation with an exponent of ∼2, which explains why Tonry
(1981) had found a slope of ∼3 when including dwarf and ordinary elliptical galaxies. The rela-
tion found by Davies et al., with a slope of ∼2, has recently been observed by de Rijcke et al.
(2005), and the curved or possibly broken L −σ distribution has been interpreted by Matkovi´c
and Guzmán (2005) as a change in slope at MB = −.(see also Evstigneeva et al. 2007) in
agreement with Davies et al. (1983).
In spite of all the above work, there is a huge body of literature today which does not reflect
the evidence for an L−σ relation that is curved or broken. Simulations of galaxies which succeed
in producing the linear Faber-Jackson relation, L ∝σ , have actually failed to produce the full
distribution of dynamics seen in real elliptical galaxies as a function of magnitude.
4
Disk Galaxy Light Proﬁles
The term “disk galaxy” refers to galaxies with large-scale stellar disks, encompassing both spiral
(Sp) and lenticular (S0) galaxies, with the latter not displaying a noticeable spiral pattern of stars
nor ongoing star formation – at least not in the optical (Gil de Paz et al. 2007). Broadly, their
bulges are centrally located stellar distributions with a smooth appearance, which appears as an
excess, a bulge, relative to the inward extrapolation of the outer exponential disk light (excluding
bars, nuclear star clusters, and nuclear disks). Readers may like to refer to Wyse et al. (1997) for
a fuller definition.
It is perhaps worth noting that as galaxy photometry and image analysis have improved
over the years, along with the availability of kinematic information, it has become increasingly
apparent that some galaxies previously labeled as elliptical galaxies actually possess a large-
scale stellar disk and are in fact lenticular galaxies (Davies et al. 1983; Bender et al. 1988; Rix
and White 1990). These have long been known to occur among the fainter early-type galaxies,
rather than the massive elliptical galaxies (e.g., Liller 1960, 1966). Similarly, albeit to a lesser
extent, some previously classified dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies have also been recognized to
contain a large-scale stellar disk and are therefore actually dwarf lenticular (dS0), and rarely
dwarf spiral (dSp) galaxies (e.g., Graham and Guzmán 2003; Lisker et al. 2006a). To accurately
quantify the optical structure of these, and all, disk galaxies, require, as a minimum, that one
models the 3D bulge (when present) and the flattened 2D disk as distinct entities rather than
fitting a single R/n, or worse still R/, model to both components.

The following section reviews the decomposition of disk galaxy light into its two primary
(bulge and disk) components. A brief discussion regarding the problems of dust is provided
in >Sect. 4.2, while a discussion of the problems with the identification of pseudobulges is pre-
sented in >Sect. 4.3. A few words about bulgeless galaxies are provided in >Sect. 4.4 while
a number of references to works which have advanced the modeling, and shown the impor-
tance, of bars are provided in >Sect. 4.5. Those interested in the more detailed morphology
and components of disk galaxies may like to look at
>Chap. 1 in this volume.
4.1 The Bulge-Disk Decomposition
It has long been known that the (azimuthally averaged) radial distribution of starlight in disks
(i.e., the disk component of disk galaxies) can be reasonably well approximated with an expo-
nential model (e.g., Patterson 1940; de Vaucouleurs 1957, 1958; Freeman 1970), such that the
intensity I varies with R according to the expression
I(R) = Ie−R/h,
(2.18)
where Iis the central intensity and h is the e-folding disk scale length. Expression relating these
two quantities to the parameters of the Sérsic R/n model, which reproduces an exponential
model when n = , can be found in Graham and Driver (2005).
While the intensityprofiles ofthese disks decline with radius, uninterrupted in most galaxies
(e.g., Barton and Thompson 1997; Weiner et al. 2001; Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2005), deviations
from this general exponential disk structure have also been known for a long time. Spiral arms
can introduce bumps and upturns in the light profile, as seen in the data from de Jong and van
der Kruit (1994) and highlighted by Erwin et al. (2005). On the other hand, some disks are
known to partially truncate at a few disk scale lengths (van der Kruit 1987; Pohlen et al. 2004,
and references therein), including our own (Minniti et al. 2011), often resulting in an apparent
double-disk structure (van der Kruit 1979; van der Kruit and Searle 1981). Due to the nonzero
thickness of disks, one can additionally study their vertical structure orthogonal to the plane of
the disk (van der Kruit and Searle 1981; van der Kruit 1988; de Grijs et al. 1997; Qu et al. 2011,
and references therein). Although it has been recognized that some galaxies may have both a
thin and a thick disk (Gilmore and Reid 1983; Chang et al. 2011), the level of observational
detail in most galaxies makes this separation impossible, and as such, it is not common practice
to attempt this differentiation in external galaxies.
Around the time of Capaccioli’s (1985, 1989) advocation of Sérsic’s R/n model, Shaw and
Gilmore (1989) and Wainscoat et al. (1989) remarked that the bulge component of spiral galax-
ies is neither all similar nor are they adequately described by the R/model. This was not a
new result, as de Vaucouleurs (1959) had himself noted departures from the R/model, and
van Houten (1961) had clearly demonstrated that an exponential model provided a better fit
to some bulges than the R/model (see also, e.g., Liller 1966, his Fig. 2; Frankston and Schild
1976; Spinrad et al. 1978). The exponential model was also eventually shown to provide a good
description for the bulge of the Milky Way (Kent et al. 1991). While Andredakis and Sanders
(1994) demonstrated that many bulges are better fit with an exponential model than an R/
model, it was Andredakis et al. (1995) who demonstrated that Sérsic’s R/n model provided a
good description for the bulges of all disk galaxies. They discovered that the concentration of
stars in bulges, quantified by the Sérsic index n, varied with bulge mass. After a number of
other early works by Heraudeau and Simien (1997), Iodice et al. (1997, 1999), Schwarzkopf and

Dettmar (1997), Seigar and James (1998), and Wadadekar et al. (1999), it has become common
practice to routinely fit disk galaxies with a Sérsic bulge plus an exponential disk. Typical bulge
Sérsic indices and bulge-to-disk flux ratios for spiral galaxies are provided in >Table 2-1.
This Sérsic-bulge plus an exponential-disk approach was used by Allen et al. (2006) to model
over 10,000 galaxies from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue (Liske et al. 2003). From this, the
luminosity function of bulges and disks, rather than simply galaxies, were constructed (Driver
et al. 2007a). This is important because the spheroidal bulge and flattened-disk component of
galaxies formed through different physical processes. If one is to more fully understand the
growth of galaxies, tracing their evolution in simulations or observing their evolution over a
range of redshifts, then the disk galaxies should not be treated as single-component systems.
The stellar mass density of bulges and disks was subsequently derived by Driver et al. (2007a),
superseding studies with (a) notably smaller sample sizes and (b) that had used R/models.
A full correction for the obscuring effects of dust was provided by Driver et al. 2007b).
4.2 Dust and Inclination Corrections
The impact of interstellar dust21 (see the review by Draine 2003) often does not receive the
attention that it deserves. In addition to Trimble’s (1999) scholarly report on how most studies
from circa 1850 until Trumpler (1930a, b) ignored reports that the space between stars is not
transparent, the influence of dust on modern, UV-optical, and near-infrared measurements of
the luminosity of bulges and disks is still to receive due diligence. This is not due to a complete
lack of appreciation but rather because it is a difficult topic which has until recently been swept
under the rug.
Although the importance and extent of dust’sthermal emission at infrared wavelengths have
been studied in external galaxies for over two decades (e.g., Devereux and Young 1990; Goud-
frooij and de Jong 1995; Temi et al. 2004), the importance of dust obscuration at UV, optical, and
21Dust was formerly referred to as “dark matter” (e.g., Trumpler 1930a, b).

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws 2
123
near-IR wavelengths has not fully filtered through to the entire community – even though it is
primarily the re-radiation of this absorbed energy which produces the infrared and millimeter
wavelength emissions. It is hoped that the level of dust recognition may soon increase due to
the vast interest and awareness in results from Spitzer (Werner et al. 2004) and coming from
the infrared Herschel Space Observatory (Pilbratt et al. 2010; see also Walmsley et al. 2010) and
also from the sub-mm Planck mission (e.g., Ade et al. 2011).
While most elliptical galaxies do not possess much diffuse dust (Bregman et al. 1998;
Clemens et al. 2010), lenticular and spiral disk galaxies can have copious amounts (e.g., White
et al. 2000; Keel and White 2001a, b). As a result, the far side of a bulge viewed through the
dusty disk component of a disk galaxy can have its light substantially diminished. Corrections
for dimming due to dust, beyond the necessary masking in one’s image when faced with obvi-
ous dust lanes and patches (e.g., Hawarden et al. 1981), therefore need to be applied to both the
disk and bulge components of disk galaxies. To date, at optical wavelengths, these corrections
have typically been inadequate for the disk and nonexistent for the bulge (e.g., de Jong 1996;
Graham 2001; Unterborn and Ryden 2008; Maller et al. 2009).
A simple schematic often used to help explain the influence of dust on disks is to start by
considering an optically thick, face-on disk, in which you can only see some depth l into the disk
before your view is obscured by dust. As this disk is inclined by some angle i, toward an edge-on
orientation i = ○, your line-of-sight depth into (the z direction of) the disk will be reduced
by cos(i), and thus you will see even less stars, with the observed disk luminosity declining
as the inclination increases toward an edge-on orientation. Numerous studies have revealed
how the observed luminosity of disk galaxies declines with inclination (e.g., Tully et al. 1998;
Masters et al. 2003). Correcting for this “inclination effect,” in a sample average sense, yields the
galaxy luminosities that would be observed if the inclined galaxies that one observed had a face-
on orientation, and this is typically the only correction applied. However, after correcting to a
face-on orientation, i.e., after determining the amount of flux that one would observe if the disk
galaxies were seen face-on, one still needs to apply an additional correction to determine the
luminosity that would be observed from the face-on disk galaxies if the dust was not present.
To date, most observational studies have only calibrated disk galaxy magnitudes to the face-
on orientation; they have not then accounted for the obscuring dust which remains. To do so
requires recourse to sophisticated radiative transfer models.
One such model is that from Popescu et al. (2000, 2011) which self-consistently explains the
UV/optical/FIR/sub-mm emission from galaxies. Other recent radiative transfer codes which
readers may find helpful include TRADING (Bianchi 2008), GRASIL (Schurer et al. 2009),
and SUNRISE (Jonsson 2006; Jonsson et al. 2010). Using these models, a renaissance of sorts
is slowly emerging in regard to correcting the optical, and near-infrared, luminosities of disk
galaxies. Expressions are now available to fully correct for dust extinction in disk galaxies (e.g.,
Driver et al. 2008; Graham and Worley 2008). Such equations will become more refined as dust
corrections for different disk morphological types, or luminosity, eventually become available.
Properly accounting for dust at ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelengths will have
many ramifications. For example, the dust-corrected ultraviolet flux density in the local Uni-
verse (Robotham and Driver 2011) is significantly greater than previously reported, as is the
associated star formation rate (SFR) density which is now 0.0312 ± 0.0045 h M⊙year−Mpc−.
We are also now in a position to construct dust-free Tully and Fisher (1977) relations, rather
than relations that are based on the luminosities of dusty galaxies corrected only to a face-on
inclination. Observations of the redshift evolution of this dust correction remain unexplored.
Until addressed, measurements of evolution in galaxy luminosities and luminosity functions

124 2
Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws
remain somewhatlimited (although see the simulations by Somerville et al. (2011)). Finally, it is
also noted that one should correct for inclination and face-on dust extinction, if only implicitly
through template spectra, and if using (the increasingly popular) photometric measurements
to estimate redshifts (e.g., Yip et al. 2011).
Correcting for dust in galaxies has revealed that the luminosity output of the (local) Uni-
verse, at visible wavelengths from starlight, is actually twice as bright as observed (Driver
et al. 2008; see also Soifer and Neugebauer 1991). It has also enabled a more accurate esti-
mate of the stellar mass density of bulges and disks in the Universe today (i.e., at z = ),
with Driver et al. (2007b) reporting that ρdisks = .± .× hM⊙Mpc−and ρbulges =
.± .× hM⊙Mpc−, implying that 11.9 ± 1.7 h percent of the baryons in the universe
(Salpeter-“lite” IMF) are in the form of stars, with ≈58% in disks, ≈10% in red elliptical galaxies,
≈29% in classical bulges, and the remainder in low luminosity blue spheroidal systems.
4.3 Pseudobulges
Pseudobulges are rather controversial, and the final section of Wyse et al. (1997) highlights
many concerns. These exponential-like bulges, formed from disk material, were discussed at
length in Hohl (1975, see his Fig. 6) which covered results from N-body simulations of disks
over the previous 7 years (see also Bardeen 1975). While it has since been shown that such
“pseudobulges” can coexist with “classical” bulges in the same galaxy (e.g., Norman et al. 1996;
Erwin et al. 2003; Athanassoula 2005), pseudobulges remain difficult to identify (because, in
part, we now know that classical bulges can also have exponential light profiles), and they bring
to mind different classes of object for different authors. Even in our own galaxy, there has been
confusion as to whether a pseudobulge or a classical bulge exists (Babusiaux et al. 2010). Due
to an increasing number of papers using questionable criteria to separate bulges into either a
classical bulge or a pseudobulge bin, this section has been included. However, readers who may
regard the identification of pseudobulges as pseudoscience at this time may wish to skip to the
following subsection.
Pseudobulges are not thought to have formed from violent relaxation processes such as
monolithic collapse, early rapid hierarchical merging, nor late-time merger events nor are they
thought to have formed from cluster harassment of disk and irregular galaxies, i.e., processes
that may have built the elliptical galaxy sequence. Such processes give rise to what are termed
“classical bulges.” Pseudobulges – or disky bulges in the notation of Athanassoula (2005) – are
comprised of, or built from, disk material through either secular evolutionary processes (Hohl
1975; Combes and Sanders 1981; Combes et al. 1990) or alternatively invoked by external trig-
gers (Mihos and Hernquist 1994; Kannappan et al. 2004). Pseudobulges are supposed to rotate
and have an exponential light profile, akin to the disk material from which they formed (Hohl
and Zhang 1979; Kormendy 1982; Pfenniger 1993; Kormendy and Kennicutt 2004), although,
as we shall see, such behavior does not confirm their existence.
For many years, the bulges of disk galaxies were generally thought to resemble small ellipti-
cal galaxies displaying an R/light-profile (e.g., de Vaucouleurs 1958; Kormendy 1977a; Kent
1985; Kodaira et al. 1986; Simien and de Vaucouleurs 1986). After Andredakis and Sanders’
(1994) revelation that many bulges are better approximated with an exponential model, some
studies, not ready to abandon the R/model,started to report on an apparent bulge dichotomy:
classical R/bulges versus exponential bulges allegedly built from the secular evolution of the

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws 2
125
disk. After the eventual recognition that a continuous range of bulge profile shapes and proper-
ties exist (e.g., Andredakis et al. 1995; Khosroshahi et al. 2000; Graham 2001; Möllenhoff and
Heidt 2001; MacArthur et al. 2003), we have since seen the practice by some of dividing classical
versus secular bulges upon whether their Sérsic index n has a value greater than or less than 2
(Kormendy and Kennicutt 2004; Fisher and Drory 2008).
Kormendy and Kennicutt (2004) advocate several additional criteria, which sometimes can
be used and other times cannot, for identifying pseudobulges. Their first criteria is a flattened
shape similartoa disk, which is arguablythe best criterion in theorybut often difficult toobserve
in practice. Kormendy and Kennicutt claim that the presence of an inner spiral pattern (or
a nuclear bar) rules out the presence of a classical bulge. However, spiral patterns (in disks)
can apparently exist within classical bulges (Jerjen et al. 2000b; Thakur et al. 2009). Moreover,
the existence of inner disk within elliptical galaxies (e.g., Rest et al. 2001; Tran et al. 2001) is
evidence that a classical bulge may be present, surrounding the disk. Indeed, Kormendy et al.
(2005) reiterate past suggestions that secular growth within a classical bulge may explain such
inner disks, a scenario further supported by Peletier et al. (2007). That is, rather than secular
evolution within a disk building a pseudobulge, one may have the construction of a disk within
a classical bulge. A third criterion from Kormendy and Kennicutt (2004) is that a boxy bulge in
an edge-on galaxy rules out a classical bulge. Williams et al. (2010) have however shown that
boxy bulges (previously), thought to be bars seen in projection (Combes and Sanders 1981),
do not all display cylindrical rotation and that they can have stellar populations different from
their disk, revealing the presence of a classical (and very boxy) bulge. Furthermore, Binney and
Petrou (1985) established that mergers can build boxy, cylindrically rotating bulges. As noted,
Sérsic index and rotation, reflecting the results from Hohl (1975), are additionally offered as a
tool by Kormendy and Kennicutt (2004) to separate pseudobulges from classical bulges, and
these criteria are addressed separately below, along with a discussion of ages and structural
scaling relations. The intention is not to argue that “pseudobulges” do not exist but only to
raise awareness that there are substantial grounds to question their identification from certain
selection criteria.
4.3.1 Sérsic Index
It has been suggested that one can identify pseudobulges if they have a Sérsic index of 1, i.e., an
exponential light profile, or, more broadly, if they have a Sérsic index less than 2 (Kormendy and
Kennicutt 2004). Given that bulges with R/-like profiles are now known to be relatively rare
(Andredakis and Sanders 1994) even among early-type disk galaxies (Balcells et al. 2003), this
approach is somewhat problematic as it would tend to identify the majority of bulges as pseu-
dobulges based upon the 400+ bulge Sérsic indices tabulated by Graham and Worley (2008).
Given the extent of galaxy merging predicted by hierarchical models, it seems unlikely that most
disk galaxies have not experienced a merger event that has influenced their bulge. We argue that
use of the Sérsic index to identify pseudobulges is at best risky and at worst highly inappropriate.
As we have seen in this article, elliptical galaxies display a continuum in numerous proper-
ties as a function of mass (see also Graham and Guzmán 2003; Côté et al. 2007, and references
therein). One of these properties is the concentration of the radial distribution of stars, i.e., the
shape of the light profile (e.g., Caon et al. 1993; Young and Currie 1994). The low-mass dwarf
elliptical galaxies, not believed to have formed from the secular evolution, or perturbation, of a
disk, have Sérsicindices around 1–2. Therefore, disk galaxybulges with Sérsicindices n < need

126 2
Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws
not have formed via secular disk processes, although some may have. The bulge of the Milky
Way is a good example where an exponential (Sérsic n = ) model (Kent et al. 1991; Graham
and Driver 2007) describes the light of what is a classical bulge (Babusiaux et al. 2010). Further-
more, while secular evolution is not proposed to build large bulges, like the one in the Sombrero
galaxy, such big bulges display a continuum of profile shapes with ever smaller bulges, such that
the Sérsic index decreases as the bulge luminosity decreases (>Table 2-1), which has led many
to speculate that a single unifying physical process is operating (e.g., Peletier and Balcells 1996b)
or at least overriding what has gone before.
Domínguez-Tenreiro et al. (1998) and Aguerri et al. (2001) have grown bulges from hierar-
chical simulations and minor merger events that have Sérsic indices from 1 to 2. Scannapieco
et al. (2011) have also shown that classical bulges formed by mergers can have Sérsic indices less
than 2. Although their gravitational softening length was only two to four times their bulge scale
lengths, this is comparable to the situation that observers often deal with (e.g., de Jong 1996). By
fitting simulated light profiles, Gadotti (2008) revealed that one can reliably measure the Sér-
sic index for bulges if their half-light radius is larger than just 80% of the image’s point-spread
function’s (PSF’s) half width half maximum (HWHM).
4.3.2 Rotation
The identification of rotating bulges goes back a long time (e.g., Pease 1918; Babcock 1938, 1939;
Rubin et al. 1973; Pellet 1976; Bertola and Capaccioli 1977; Peterson 1978; Mebold et al. 1979).
Early-type galaxies can also display significant rotation, albeit likely due to the presence of a disk
(e.g., Davies et al. 1983; Graham et al. 1998; Emsellem et al. 2007, 2011; Krajnovi´c et al. 2008).
Due to the presence of a bar, as opposed to a pseudobulge, classical bulges can also appear to
rotate (e.g., Babusiauxet al. 2010). Classical bulges can alsobe spun upbya bar(Saha et al. 2011).
To further complicate matters, simulations indicate that merger events can result in rotating
elliptical galaxies (Naab et al. 1999, 2006; González-García et al. 2009; Hoffman et al. 2009),
and Bekki (2010) has shown that a rotating bulge can also be created by a merger event and
is thus not necessarily a sign of a pseudobulge built by secular evolution from disk material as
typically assumed. In addition, Qu et al. (2011) report on how the rotational delay between old
and young stars in the disc of our Galaxy may be a signature of a minor merger event.
This is not to say that inner, rotationally flattened, and supported disks do not masquerade
as bulges (e.g., Erwin et al. 2003), only that rotation may not be a definitive sign of “bulges” built
via secular disk processes.
4.3.3 Ages
The bulge of the Milky Way consists of an old stellar population (Rich and Origlia 2005;
Zoccali et al. 2006; Cavichia et al. 2012)and has kinematics consistent with a pressure-supported
system rather than a rotationally supported system (Wyse and Gilmore 1995; Babusiaux et al.
2010). Contrary to classical bulges formed early on in the universe, pseudobulges are thought
to be young, built from disk material.
Using optical and near-infrared colors, Bothun and Gregg (1990) had argued that S0 galaxy
disks were more than 5-Gyr younger than the bulges they host, affirming the previously held
belief that bulges are akin to old elliptical galaxies (Renzini 1999). With refined measurements,

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws 2
127
and avoiding obvious dusty regions, Peletier and Balcells (1996a) discovered that the color and
age difference (assuming old populations with identical metallicities) between the bulge and
disk from the same galaxy, in a sample of early-type disk galaxies, are much closer than had
been realized, but still with the bulges older than their surrounding disks. Peletier et al. (1999)
went on to conclude that the bulges of their S0-Sb galaxies are indeed old and cannot have
formed by secular evolution22 more recently than z = (see also Goudfrooij et al. 1999, and
Bell and de Jong 2000). From a sample of nine late-type galaxies, Carollo et al. (2007) used
optical and near-infrared images to discover that roughly half of their bulges were old and half
were young (see also Gadotti and Anjos 2001).
Dust and bright young blue stars (≲1 Gyr) can significantly bias the light at optical wave-
lengths (MacArthur et al. 2010), as can young-ish (≲2 Gyr) stars in the near-infrared due to
thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars (e.g., Freeman 2004; Tonini et al. 2010). From
a line strength analysis, Thomas and Davies (2006) concluded that secular evolution is not a
dominant mechanism for Sbc and earlier-type spirals, and Moorthy and Holtzman (2006) con-
cluded that merging rather than secular evolution is likely the dominant mechanism for bulge
formation (see also Jablonka et al. 2007). MacArthur et al. (2009) revealed, also with spectra
rather than colors, that bulges in both early- and late-type spiral galaxies, even those with Sérsic
indices n < , have old mass-weightedages, with less than 25% by mass of the stars being young.
Based on the bulge’s stellar populations and stellar gradients (see also Fisher et al. 1996), they
concluded that early-formation processes are common to all bulges and that secular processes
or “rejuvenated” star formation generally contributes minimally to the stellar mass budget but
has biased luminosity-weighted age estimates in the past. Such “frostings” of young stars, up to
some 25%, can bias some techniques into missing the dominance of old stars by mass in (most)
bulges.
4.3.4 Scaling Relations
Following on from >Fig. 2-7 for elliptical galaxies, >Fig. 2-11 reveals how the K-band mag-
nitudes of nearly 400 bulges vary with (a) Sérsic index and (b) the central surface brightness
(extrapolated from the Sérsic fit outside of the core). The data points have come from the com-
pilation by Graham and Worley (2008). While the scatter is large, there is no evidence of a
discontinuity between bulges with n greater than or less than 2. The following linear relations,
shown in the figures, appear to roughly describe the distributions:
MK = −.log(n) −.;
(2.19)
MK = .μ,K −..
(2.20)
The curved relation shown in >Fig. 2-11c is not a fit but simply
MK = .(μe,K −.b) −.,
(2.21)
where b ≈.n −.and n = −(.+MK)/.. That is, the above two linear relations
predict the existence of this curved magnitude (effective surface brightness) relation.
The scatter in the data, and the lack of bulges with n > , makes the curvature in >Fig. 2-11c
hard to see with the current data. Instead, it may appear that there is a cascade of fainter data
22Peletier et al. (1999) additionally observed three late-type spirals with blue colors indicative of a young
luminosity-weighted age.

most bulges in each panel)
departing from the region associated with the bright arm of the predicted relation correspond-
ing to bulges with larger Sérsic indices. This apparent departure of fainter galaxies does not,
however, imply that two physical processes must be operating.
Due tobulges possessing a continuous range ofstellarconcentrations, with theirluminosity-
dependent Sérsic indices n ranging from less than 1 to greater than 4 (> Fig. 2-11a), several
bulge parameters will follow a number of nonlinear scaling relations. The explanation for how
this arises is provided in greater detail in >Sect. 3.2. Departures from the magnitude-(effective
surface brightness) relation, the Kormendy (1977b) relation, and other relations including the
Fundamental Plane (Djorgovski and Davis 1987) are expected at the low-luminosity, low Sérsic
index, faint central surface brightnesses region of the bulge sequence. This does not imply that
these bulges are pseudobulges (Greene et al. 2008; Gadotti 2009), although some may be.
4.4 Bulgeless Galaxies
The bulge-to-disk flux ratio, known to vary with disk morphological type (see >Table 2-1) is
primarily due to changes in the bulge luminosity along the spiral galaxy sequence, as first noted
by Yoshizawa and Wakamatsu (1975, their Figs. 1 and 2) and reiterated by Ostriker (1977). Are
there disk galaxies at the (small-bulge)-end of the sequence which actually have no bulge?
Although a central “bulge” in the light profile of the Triangulum nebula, M33, has long been
evident (e.g., Stebbins and Whitford 1934, and references therein; van den Bergh 1991; Wyse
et al. 1997), it has become common practice by many to nowadays refer to M33 as bulgeless.
This is a reflection of efforts by some to try and distinguish some excesses of central light rel-
ative to the inward extrapolation of the outer exponential disk from a “classical” bulge of stars
(e.g., Böker et al. 2003; Walcher et al. 2005). However, some papers have even started referring
to the Milky Way as bulgeless, because they feel that it may have a pseudobulge built from disk
instabilities and also labeling any galaxy whose bulge’s Sérsic index is less than 2 as “pure disk”
galaxies. As stressed by Cameron et al. (2009, their Sect. 4), and Allen et al. (2006) – who mod-
eled over 10,000 galaxies with a Sérsic bulge plus an exponential disk – may have added to the

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws 2
129
confusion by referring to galaxies in which the bulge could not be resolved, and was thus sim-
ply ignored in the fit, as “pure disk” galaxies (see also Kautsch 2009a) rather than labeling them
“quasi-bulgeless” as done by Barazza et al. (2008). Obviously, the above practices have lead to
quite a confusing situation in the literature today. Nonetheless, there are some good examples
of what most would agree are almost truly bulgeless galaxies (free from either a classical or a
pseudobulge), such as IC 5249 and NGC 300 with less than 2% bulge light (Bland-Hawthorn
et al. 2005) and the superthin edge-on galaxies reviewed by Kautsch (2009b).
Current interest in bulgeless galaxies exists for at least two reasons. The first reason extends
to disk galaxies with small bulges. Most galaxy simulations have, in the past, had a tendency to
produce bulges rather than (pure) disks because of baryon angular momentum losses during
major merger events (e.g., Navarro and Benz 1991; D’Onghia et al. 2006) and due to central
star formation from minor merger events (Stewart et al. 2008). As highlighted by Graham and
Worley (2008) and Weinzirl et al. (2009), many disk galaxies have small (<1/4) bulge-to-total
flux ratios (see >Table 2-1), which has been at odds with most simulations until recently (Koda
et al. 2009; Governato et al. 2010; Brook et al. 2011; Fontanot et al. 2011).
The second reason pertains to claims of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in bulgeless
galaxies. Given the apparent wealth of data revealing correlations between the masses of super-
massive black holes and the properties of their host bulge (e.g., Ferrarese and Ford (2005)),
the existence of supermassive black holes in bulgeless galaxies is an interesting unresolved
problem. While the central kinematic data for the “bulgeless” galaxy M33 is consistent with
no SMBH (Merritt et al. 2001; Gebhardt et al. 2001), SMBHs in allegedly bulgeless galaxies
includes NGC 4395 (Filippenko and Ho 2003, but see Graham 2007), NGC 1042 (Shields et al.
2008, but see Knapen et al. 2003), NGC 3621 (Gliozzi et al. 2009, but see Barth et al. 2009, their
Fig. 4), NGC 3367, and NGC 4536 (McAlpine et al. 2011, but read their text and see Dong and
De Robertis 2006). However, if the bulges of these “bulgeless” galaxies are pseudobulges, then
questions arise as to the origin and connection of the SMBHs with these bulges. Given the con-
nection between pseudobulges and bars (Hohl 1975), it is pertinent to perform bulge-bar-disk
decompositions in galaxies with prominent bars, where the bar is perhaps still more connected
to the disk instability than the ensuing pseudobulge (Graham 2011).
4.5 Barred Galaxies
Disk galaxies can possess more components than just a bulge and disk; they may, for example,
have bars, oval distortions and lenses, inner and outer rings, spiral arms, local star forma-
tion, etc. Features arising from global instabilities in the disk are reviewed in
>Chap. 18 of
Volume 5. As was noted by the Third Reference Catalogue of de Vaucouleurs et al. (1991, and
references therein), multiple components often exist, and sometimes these have been modeled
(e.g., Tsikoudi 1979; Prieto et al. 1997, 2001). In addition to these large-scale features, nuclear
bars and disks can also be present (e.g., de Zeeuw and Franx 1991; Rest et al. 2001), and when
the resolution permits it, these can also be modeled (e.g., Balcells et al. 2007; Seth et al. 2008).
In this section, we shall, however, only briefly discuss large-scale bars (reviewed by Knapen
2010, see also Buta’s article in this volume). Roughly half to three-quarters of disk galaxies dis-
play a large-scale bar (e.g., de Vaucouleurs 1963; Eskridge et al. 2000; Marinova et al. 2012,
and references therein), and many papers have performed a quantitative analysis of these (e.g.,
Martin 1995; de Jong 1996; Aguerri et al. 1998). Accounting for bars is important where these

130 2
Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws
features are of sufficiently large amplitude to influence the models being fit to the light dis-
tribution (e.g., Laurikainen et al. 2005, 2007; Reese et al. 2007; Gadotti 2008; Weinzirl et al.
2009).
Ferrers’ (1877) ellipsoid is often used to describe bars (e.g., Sellwood and Wilkinson 1993),
as is Freeman’s (1966) elliptical cylinder (e.g., de Jong 1996), generalized by Athanassoula et al.
(1990). Sérsic’s model is also sometimes used with n = ., which reproduces a Gaussian func-
tion and has a sharpish decline at large radii for approximating the behavior seen at the ends
of bars, although truncated models are also sometimes employed. While the bar shows up as
a plateau in the galaxy light-profile corresponding to the bar’s major-axis, in some galaxies,
the azimuthally averaged light profile effectively recombines the bar and (apparently hollowed
inner) disk light to reproduce an exponential profile, like that seen in the disks of non-barred
galaxies (e.g., Ohta et al. 1990; Elmegreen et al. 1996).
The strength of a bar is often quantified by its ellipticity (e.g., Athanassoula 1992; Martin
1995; Wozniak et al. 1995) – a measure of the departure from the circular orbits of the disk
stars – rather than its luminosity contrast (e.g., Ohta et al. 1990; Rozas et al. 1998). Strong bars
have major-to-minor axis ratios of 3–4 while very strong bars may have ratios as high as 5. The
gravitational torque has also been used to quantify bar strength (e.g., Combes and Sanders 1981;
Laurikainen and Salo 2002) and similarly in triaxial bulges (e.g., Trujillo et al. 2002).

Summary
We have reviewed the progress over the last century in modeling the distribution of stars in
elliptical galaxies, plus the bulges of lenticular and spiral galaxies and their surrounding disks.
A number of nearly forgotten or poorly recognized references have been identified. The univer-
sality, or at least versatility, of Sérsic’s R/n model to describe bulges (>Sect. 4.1) and elliptical
galaxies (>Sect. 2.1) extends to the stellar halos of cD galaxies (>Sect. 2.4) and simulated dark
matter halos (>Sect. 2.1.1).
Dwarf and ordinary elliptical galaxies were shown in >Sect. 3.1 to be united by two contin-
uous linear relations between absolute magnitude and (a) the stellar concentration quantified
through Sérsic’s (1963) R/n shape parameter (>Sect. 3.1.2) and (b) the central surface bright-
ness, which is also related to the central density ( >Sect. 3.1.1). As discussed in >Sect. 3.3,
a break in the latter relation at MB ≈−.signals the onset of partially depleted cores rela-
tive to the outer Sérsic profile in luminous elliptical galaxies. Additional scaling relations are
also noted to show a change in character at this magnitude, which may denote the onset of dry
galaxy merging.
The identification of depleted galaxy cores and excess nuclear light relative to the outer Sér-
sic profile was discussed in > Sects. 2.2, >2.2.1, and >2.3. After accounting for these features,
the above two linear relations result in curved scaling relations involving effective half light
radii and effective surface brightness (>Sect. 3.2). Specifically, the M–Re, M–μe, M–⟨μ⟩e, μe–
Re, ⟨μ⟩e–Re, and n–Re relations are nonlinear. These continuous curved relations exist because
elliptical galaxies do not have a universal profile shape, such as an R/profile but instead a range
of profile shapes that vary smoothly with absolute magnitude. Without an appreciation of the
origin of these curved relations, they had in the past been heralded as evidence for a dichotomy
between faint and bright elliptical galaxies. Numerical simulations and semi-numerical mod-
els which try to reproduce the full elliptical galaxy sequence must be able to reproduce these

Elliptical and Disk Galaxy Structure and Modern Scaling Laws 2
131
nonlinear relations. This will likely require physical processes which work in tandem, albeit
to different degrees over different mass ranges, to produce a continuum of galaxy properties
that scale with mass while adhering to the linear M–n and M–μrelations (subject to core
formation).
The structure of disk galaxies was reviewed in >Sect. 4, with >Sect. 4.1 covering the even-
tual recognition that bulges, like elliptical galaxies, are well described by the Sérsic model. A
discussion of the difficulties in identifying pseudobulges was provided in >Sect. 4.3, covering
the shape of bulge light profiles, rotation, stellar ages, and nonlinear scaling relations. Additional
sections briefly encompassed issues related to dust (>Sect. 4.2), bulgeless galaxies (>Sect. 4.4)
and models for barred galaxies (>Sect. 4.5).
The upcoming 2.6-m VLT Survey Telescope (VST, Arnaboldi et al. 1998; Capaccioli et al.
2005), plus the 4×1.8-m Pan-STARRS array (Kaiser et al. 2002), the 4-m Visible and Infrared
Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA, Emerson et al. 2004) and the 8.4-m Large Synop-
tic Survey Telescope (LSST, Tyson 2002) are expected to deliver sub-arcsecond, deep and wide
field-of-view imaging covering thousands of resolvable galaxies. By pushing down the lumi-
nosity function into the dwarf galaxy regime, and through the application of improved galaxy
parameterization methods which allow for structural nonhomology and the two- or three-
component nature of disk galaxies, both statistical and systematic errors will be reduced. This
will undoubtedly provide improved constraints on galaxy scaling relations and, in turn, a fuller
understanding of galaxy evolution.

Star Formation in Galaxies 3
143
Abstract:
The process of star formation is at the core of the evolutionary cycle of galaxies, as
newborn stars produce new chemical elements, dust, and light. The energetic output delivered
first by stellar winds and then by supernovae a few Myr after a star formation episode may
also directly impact on the evolution of galaxies and their interstellar medium (ISM), as well as
having an effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM), through feedback and outflows.
This chapterconcerns star formation on galactic scales. First, the galactic processes that may
affect large-scale star formation are presented. Second, the various methods to measure star
formation rates are discussed (star formation tracers, timescales, calibrations, limits). Finally,
the observational status concerning star formation in galaxies (its relation to other quantities
and its evolution) is presented. The Schmidt Law (star formation rate–gas relationship) is amply
discussed.

Introduction
Star formation is at the core of the cycle of evolution of galaxies. From their gas reservoir (and its
replenishment), stars are formed at a given rate (the star formation rate, SFR) with a paramount
impact on many aspects of galaxy evolution. The first one is the simple fact that galaxies are filled
with stars that emit the light that allows us to see them. Generations after generations, the most
massive of newly formed stars will also quickly yield the chemical elements formed in their core
(stellarnucleosynthesis)toenrich the interstellarmedium (ISM). This chemical enrichment will
affect the properties and evolution of the next generations of stars and allow in fact the galaxies
to hosts planets and life itself (both relying on heavy elements). Star formation is important for
other aspects of extragalactic physics: the energy released by evolved stars and supernovae can
affect the interstellar medium. It may heat the gas and prevent the collapse of the gas or, on the
contrary, shock it and induce the formation of new stars. Its role on the distribution of stars and
gas impacts the morphology of galaxies. Star formation finally affects the intergalactic medium
(IGM), as winds due to violent episodes of star formation may exit their original galaxy and
chemically and dynamically impact the IGM.
Because star formation is so crucial in shaping the galaxies (and maybe even their sur-
roundings) the way they are seen, the subject has naturally motivated a lot of work. While
it is generally admitted that stars form within molecular clouds, in the densest phases of
the interstellar gas, the complex details of the process are not yet fully understood. For the
actual physics of star formation, on small scales, the reader is referred to
>Chap. 3 of this
handbook, or the McKee and Ostriker (2007) review. Such studies of the details of the process
are accessible mostly in the Milky Way where star formation regions can be studied in great
details.

Star Formation in Galaxies
On the other hand, star formation is also related to the scales of galaxies themselves. First,
from a purely observational point of view, in many cases it is only possible to know the inte-
grated SFR for the whole galaxy. But there are also physical links to be investigated: what is
the main driver of star formation on the large scales? How is the SFR related to the galaxy gas
reservoir? Is the SFR affected (enhanced or reduced) by the spiral arms of disk galaxies? By the
density? By the galaxy kinematics? By other phenomenon? These questions are the subject of
this chapter, focused on star formation on the scales of galaxies (by opposition to the scales of
individual star-forming regions).
While early on the SFR (and its history) was derived in external galaxies from global
quantities such as colors (with the help of evolutionary synthesis models), a number of SFR
diagnostics (based on observables that will be called “SFR tracers”) have been developed and
largely used since the 1980s (emission lines, UV continuum, far-infrared luminosities). SFRs
are usually deduced from these tracers using famous calibrations, relying on specific physics
or empirical relations that are often forgotten. None of the SFR tracers in fact provide a
really instantaneous SFR. To measure it, it is assumed that the SFR was constant on a typical
timescale (between a few Myr and a few 100 Myr depending on the tracer). A given initial
mass function (IMF) has also to be chosen. It is important to understand the origin of the
calibrations used to derive the SFR and to know the assumptions underlying them and their
limits.
Early on, Schmidt (1959) found a relation between the SFR and the gas density in the Milky
Way. This relation, now known as the Schmidt Law, has been revisited frequently and has taken
many forms (over the scales of whole galaxies or “local” scales of a few 100 pc within galaxies).
It is still today an active field of research and a constraint for models of the evolution of galaxies.
Today, SFR are routinely derived for large samples of galaxies, in the nearby universe, as well as
in deep fields showing us galaxies in a young universe. The SFR distribution is computed and
even integrated to provide a “cosmic” SFR and its evolution: the history of star formation in the
whole universe. These studies bring an unprecedented amount of information on the history of
galaxies.
In this chapter, the subjects briefly described above are distributed in three sections.
In >Sect. 2, the formalism describing star formation is presented, followed by the theoretical
ideas suggesting relations between star formation and other galactic phenomenon or quantities.
The diagnostics for measuring the star formation activity in galaxies (the SFR tracers) are pre-
sented in >Sect. 3 including the underlying assumptions, the calibrations, the timescales, and
some observational difficulties. Finally, a review of the current observational status concerning
star formation on the scales of galaxies, the Schmidt Law, the specific star formation rate, and
the star formation history is proposed in >Sect. 4.
Other reviews (complementary to the material presented in these pages) can be found in
books and classical papers, such as Chapter 9 of Mo et al. (2009), Kennicutt (1998a), and Larson
(1992). A number of ideas about star formation in galaxies were discussed during a nice inter-
national conference hold at the Abbazia di Spineto on the subject “SFR@50: Filling the Cosmos
with Stars” at the occasion of the 50th birthday of the seminal paper by Schmidt (1959). While
no traditional proceedings were published, the reader may find the presentations given in that
occasion on DVD or via the Internet.1

Theoretical Background
2.1 Formalism
In order to describe star formation in quantitative terms, it is necessary to adopt a simple
formalism. It would be ideal to know at any time the functional form form(m, t) describing
the number of stars dN formed in the dm mass interval during the time dt so that dN =
form(m, t)dtdm. It is convenient to decompose this functional form into two independent
terms. First, the total amount of material forming stars from interstellar gas by unit of time (in,
e.g., M⊙year−)is called the starformation rate (SFR, noted ψ in the following). Second, the stel-
lar mass (m) distribution of a generation of newly formed stars (the initial mass function, IMF,
noted ϕ in the following). The IMF is defined as ϕ(m) = dN/dm and normalized as follows:
∫
Mu
Ml
mϕ(m)dm = ,
(3.1)
where Ml and Mu are the lower and upper mass limits, respectively. In his classical study,
Salpeter (1955) defined in fact the logarithmic IMF ξ(m) = dN/d log(m). The two functions
are simply linked by ξ(m) = ln()mϕ(m). There are some uncertainties concerning the upper
and lower limits, but it is usual to consider values between 0.1 and 100 M⊙. With this formal-
ism, form(m, t) = ψ(t)ϕ(m), where it is implicitly assumed that the IMF is stationary in time
and only dependent on m (see however, >Sect. 3.8.2 for different suggestions).
The IMF is often parametrized as a power law, following the classical study of Salpeter
(1955). Under this assumption, it is possible to write ϕ(m) ∝m−(+x) or equivalently ξ(m) ∝
m−x. The index x, measuring the logarithmic slope of the IMF, was found by Salpeter (1955)
to have a value of 1.35 in the solar neighborhood. Even though it was estimated over a limited
mass range, this value is still frequently used. However, more recent determination of the IMF
have established that the IMF presents a flattening at low masses. The universal IMF of Kroupa
(2001) is an example of formulations more in accordance with the recent measurements. It is
characterized by a slope of x = 0.3 between 0.1 and 0.5 M⊙, and x = 1.3 for masses larger than
0.5 M⊙. In the following, this IMF (largely used in the literature) is adopted. More details on
the IMF can be found elsewhere in these volumes ( >Chap. 4 of Volume 5).
The IMF might result from fundamental physical processes (such as turbulence and self-
gravity, etc.) leading to star formation. For this reason, it is reasonable to expect some level
of universality, and there are indeed good signs of it (e.g., Bastian et al. 2010, and references
therein), but see other considerations in >Sect. 3.8.2. With a universal IMF, star formation is
summarized in the SFR, which dictates how much mass is converted intostars perunit time and,
as a consequence, what will be the production of heavy elements, light, feedback, etc. Under-
standing what influences the SFR on the scales of galaxies is thus of paramount importance for
every aspect of galaxy evolution. The rest of the chapter is an attempt to summarize the present
understanding of the SFR on the galactic scales.
2.2 Conditions for Star Formation
The modern view of star formation is that giant molecular clouds (GMC) are a prerequi-
site to form stars (e.g., Leroy et al. 2008, and references therein). Once molecular clouds are
formed, “local” processes (not considered in this chapter) will transform part of them into stars,

146 3
Star Formation in Galaxies
on a short timescales (e.g., Tamburro et al. 2008). In that case, the question of star formation
reduces to the formation of molecular gas and GMCs from which stars will be formed (e.g.,
Blitz and Rosolowsky 2006).
Many processes reviewed below have been presented as favoring the collapse or conden-
sation of gas. In the current adopted view, they should be seen as not leading directly to the
apparition of stars, but to the formation of molecular gas and molecular clouds. The processes
described in the >Sect. 2.2 concern conditions that should be fulfilled for star formation to
occur, leading to the concept of thresholds for star formation. >Section 2.3 will concern the
direct influences on the SFR itself.
2.2.1 Gravitational Instability
The most obvious and discussed effect is the disk gravitational instability. In reality, other insta-
bilities (e.g., the thermal and Parker instability, see for instance in Elmegreen 1993a) may play
a role. Wang and Silk (1994) argue that the gravitational one is the leading phenomenon, with
only some contribution from other instabilities, an idea frequently accepted. While studying
the stability of stellar disks (in order to explain the observation of spiral and S0 galaxies with
smooth distribution of stars), Toomre (1964) established that a rotating stellar disk is unstable
when Q∗< , where the “Toomre parameter” Q∗is defined as
Q∗=
σ∗κ
.GΣ∗
.
(3.2)
Σ∗is the stellar surface density, σ∗is the velocity dispersion, and κ is the epicyclic frequency.
κ can be defined as (Binney and Tremaine 1987):
κ = (R dΩ
dR + Ω)
.
.
(3.3)
The Toomre parameter Q∗can be seen as the balance between the velocity dispersion and the
Coriolis force tending to tear apart the stars, counterbalancing their gravity. This result inspired
a lot of other works that gave to this “Toomre stability criterion” a diversity of forms. For a
gaseous disk (of surface density Σgas and velocity dispersion σgas), one can assume (e.g., Cowie
1981; Kennicutt 1989; Wang and Silk 1994) that the disk is unstable when Q < where
Q =
σgasκ
πGΣgas
.
(3.4)
It is common to define a gas “critical” density Σcrit such that Q = . The gaseous disk is unstable
when Σgas > Σcrit following the idea of Quirk (1972). While originally, the criterion concerns
axisymetric instabilities, it may also be appropriate for various processes of star formation, for
instance, the collapse of expanding shells or of turbulence-compressed regions (see Elmegreen
and Hunter 2006, and references therein).
In a number of studies (e.g., Kennicutt 1989; Martin and Kennicutt 2001), a pragmatic
approach has been adopted by using Q′ in place of Q, defined simply as
Q′ = αQ Q,
(3.5)
αQ is a normalization factor, determined by measuring the limit of the disk stability and
affecting Q′ = to it. In this way, Martin and Kennicutt (2001) found αQ = .± ..

Star Formation in Galaxies 3
147
Wang and Silk (1994) also proposed an approximation for the Q parameter taking into
account the effect of the stellar disk (based on the analysis of two isothermal fluids in Jog and
Solomon 1984) whose density can help the collapse of the gaseous component:
Q ≃
σgasκ
πGΣgas
(+ Σ∗σgas
Σgas σ∗
)
−
.
(3.6)
Note that this effect of the stellar density in (> 3.6) can be hidden in αQ of (> 3.5) that should
then however depend on the stellar density.
2.2.2 Shear Criterion
Noticing that star formation seems to occur in regions of low shear, Elmegreen (1993a) pro-
posed another definition of the Q parameter, incorporating the shear rather than the epicyclic
frequency:
QA = .σgasA
πGΣgas
,
(3.7)
where A is the Oort shear constant:
A = .R dΩ
dR .
(3.8)
Ω is the angular frequency. For a flat rotation curve with a constant linear velocity V (indepen-
dent from the radius R), one has Ω = V/R. It is easy to find that Q from (> 3.4) is then close
to QA. This is true for a large part of disks in spiral galaxies, but makes differences in the inner
parts of spirals and dwarf galaxies where the shear is low (Hunter et al. 1998). Seigar (2005)
argued that the observed shear rates do present a threshold (at A/Ω ∼.) corresponding to a
null star formation rate.
2.2.3 Formation of a Cold Phase
Schaye (2004) suggested that the formation of a cold phase and an efficient formation of
molecular gas (depending on the physics of the ISM) is more relevant to star formation than
gravitational stability effects over large scale. He found a critical surface density that depends
(weakly) on the metallicity, the gas fraction, the flux of ionizing photons, and the ratio of the
thermal to total pressure. He provided a fitting formula in his paper, and a typical local critical
gas density Σcrit ∼−M⊙pc−for “reasonable values” of the parameters.
2.3 Galactic Inﬂuences on the Star Formation Rates
Many processes on galactic scales have been proposed to directly affect the star formation
rate itself. The more often discussed ones are reviewed below. A comparative study of many
propositions has been done recently by Leroy et al. (2008).

148 3
Star Formation in Galaxies
2.3.1 Free Fall
It is possible to write the star formation rate density in a disk as the ratio of the gas density and
the timescale to turn gas into stars, with an efficiency є (e.g., Wang and Silk 1994; Larson 1992):
Σψ = є Σgas
τ .
(3.9)
What sets the timescale τ? The first natural idea is to consider the free fall time for pure gravi-
tational instability that leads to τ ∝ρ−.
gas (e.g., Madore 1977), giving for a constant scale height
of the disk (e.g., Bigiel et al. 2008; Leroy et al. 2008, and references therein):
Σψ ∝Σ.
gas.
(3.10)
2.3.2 Hydrostatic Equilibrium
Contrary to the assumption in the above section, the scale height (h) of a disk might not be
constant, but regulated by the hydrostatic equilibrium of the disk. It is then approximated by
Corbelli (2003) as:
h = σgas
πG ( Σgas
σgas
+ Σ∗
σ∗
)
−
.
(3.11)
It is still possible to use τ ∝ρ−.
gas with ρgas = Σgas/h, leading to (see also Leroy et al. 2008):
Σψ ∝Σ
gas
σgas
(+ Σ∗
Σgas
σgas
σ∗,z
)
.
(3.12)
In a parallel approach, Abramova and Zasov (2008) used the assumption of hydrostatic equi-
librium to compute the scale height of the gaseous disk, and then use it to compute volume
density. They showed that the volume density of gas and SFR correlate better than the surface
densities. They also suggested a direct dependence of the SFR on the stellar surface density.
2.3.3 Gravitation Versus Dispersion
Another point of view is to consider that the perturbation growth timescale τ from (> 3.9) is
obtained by balancing dispersion against gravitation (Larson 1992):
τ ∝
σgas
πGΣgas
.
(3.13)
Assuming the velocity dispersion is constant, the star formation rate density is then
Σψ ∝Σ
gas.
(3.14)
This relation should apply to kpc scales because the gravitational aggregation proceeds on these
scales.

Star Formation in Galaxies 3

2.3.4 Self-regulated Star Formation
When star formation occurs, it may dynamically heat the gaseous disk. Then, σgas in (> 3.13)
is not constant (in contrast with the assumption of > Sect. 2.3.3) but will increase with star
formation, what will also increase the Toomre parameter Q. The disk may then become stable,
star formation stops. The gas can then cool down and Q go down. Thus, it is possible to consider
that Q has a quasi-constant value (around 1). Self-regulation was suggested by, e.g., Kennicutt
(1989) noticing that the ratio Σgas/Σcrit presents a small variation over a large range of Σgas. In
that case, by combining Q = , (> 3.4) and (> 3.13), one obtains τ ∝κ−, leading for the star
formation rate (using (> 3.9)) to
Σψ ∝Σgasκ.
(3.15)
Note that for a flat rotation curve (a good approximation to observations of rotation curves in
the Milky Way and nearby galaxies), κ =
√
Ω so that the SFR depends in this case on the
density of gas and the rotation curve, both quantities being relatively easy to observe in nearby
galaxies.
Larson (1992) noted that the cases leading to ( > 3.15) and ( > 3.14) are two simplistic
assumptions and that reality might be somewhere in between, i.e.,
Σψ ∝Σα
gasκβ; < α < ; < β < .
(3.16)
For a flat rotation curve, this can be written as
Σψ ∝Σα
gasΩβ.
(3.17)
Note that this self-regulated form is obtained for either a constant Toomre Q ( > 3.4) or for a
constant value of the shear Toomre parameter QA (> 3.7).
2.3.5 Cloud Collapse Versus Stellar Disruption
Madore (2010) proposed that the collapse time scale for a cloud (parametrized as τC ∝ρ−n
gas)
should be combined with a timescale τS, characteristic of the disruptive effect of star formation
(at a place in a galaxy, once stars are formed, the gas is dispersed and ionized, so that no further
star formation can occur at that place for the time τS). The star formation rate (per volume unit)
can then be written as
ρψ ∝
ρn
gas
τS + ρ−n
gas
.
(3.18)
Madore (2010) showed that this functional form allow to reproduce the trend obtained by Bigiel
et al. (2008) between the star formation rate and the total gas surface density (see >Sect. 4).
2.3.6 Cloud–Cloud Collisions
Assuming that the crucial step of neutral gas turning into molecular gas (formation of GMCs)
occur during cloud-cloud collisions, Wyse (1986) proposed that the star formation rate should
be proportional to Σ
HI and included a dynamical factor to take into account the effect of the
spiral arms (see >Sect. 2.3.8 below).

150 3
Star Formation in Galaxies
Under the assumption of cloud-cloud collisions, Tan (2000) obtained a more complex
formula, including the effect of shear on the collision rate:
Σψ ∝ΣgasΩ(−.β),
(3.19)
where β = d ln(V)/d ln(R). Note that β is null for a flat rotation curve, in wich case the SFR
law obtained has the same form as (> 3.17) obtained with a different approach.
2.3.7 Physics of the ISM
Since stars are formed within molecular clouds, the SFR may be directly linked to the processes
affecting the amount of molecular gas present in a galaxy, i.e., to the detailed physics of the
ISM. Which process actually governs the molecular fraction within galaxies is however under
discussions.
Elmegreen (1993b) proposed that the fraction of molecular gas is set by the hydrostatic
pressure and the radiation field and that this is the limiting factor for star formation rather than
the gravitational assembly of material into clouds and GMCs. This idea was pursued by several
authors (Leroy et al. 2008, and references therein). Blitz and Rosolowsky (2006) expressed it by
saying that the molecular ratio Rmol = ΣH/ΣHI should depend on the pressure:
Rmol = (P/P)α.
(3.20)
For low pressures (P ≪P), over large part of galaxies (where HI dominates over H2), the SFR
should then follow a relation of the type:
ΣSFR ∝Σgas(P/P)α.
(3.21)
Blitz and Rosolowsky (2006) found that their observations in 14 galaxies (including the Milky
Way) were in good agreement with such a relation with an index close to α ∼., also found
in other studies (see Leroy et al. 2008, and references therein). Blitz and Rosolowsky (2006)
noticed however that under their assumptions (constant velocity gas dispersion, turbulent pres-
sure providing support), their expression is equivalent to Rmol being a function of the midplane
gas density and that their data alone cannot distinguish these possibilities. They stressed that
while they suggest that the hydrostatic pressure determines the molecular fraction, it does not
determine how the GMC are assembled from molecular gas, or if the gas is first assembled into
GMC-sized object, and then becomes molecular. In other words, even if they argue that the
hydrostatic pressure plays a major role, there is room for other processes in the formation of
GMCs and then, likely, of stars.
Monaco et al. (2012) found that their multiphases models including a pressure-determined
molecular fraction do produce a dynamical relation (ΣSFR ∝Σgasκ) that they interpret as
resulting from the equilibrium between the energy injection (via supernovae) and dissipation.
Krumholz et al. (2009) proposed an alternatemodelbased on the combination of few simple
ideas. The Hydrogen self-shielding determines the amount of molecular gas that once formed
is regulated by internal process and form stars at a rate of 1% per free fall time (as a result of
turbulence). This allows them to predict the Σψ −Σgas relationship (as well as the molecular
fraction) as a function of the metallicity of the gas.

2.3.8 Inﬂuence of the Spiral Arms?
The first impression when one looks at most nearby spiral galaxy is that young stars are
distributed along spiral arms or arcs, and it is hard to think that star formation is unrelated to
spiral structure. Elmegreen (1979) however suggested that two types of spiral arms should be
considered. The spiral density wave, related to the stellar underlying density, is responsible for
the grand design spirals that are often seen in galaxies. The other type is made of stochastic spiral
arms or filaments produced by the shear of self-propagating star formation (this type of stochas-
tic arms would be a product of star formation but would not affect the galaxy SFR). According
to Elmegreen (1979), the density wave/grand design arms can play an active role by compress-
ing or shocking the interstellar material. Cowie (1981) also found that the gaseous disk of the
Milky Way is globally stable against collapse, but that the passage of the clouds ensemble trough
the spiral arm will modify the velocity dispersion of the clouds and produce the instability. Star
formation should then proceed only in the arms. Through such processes, grand-design spiral
arms should affect star formation. If star formation (or cloud collapse) is indeed enhanced when
the gas crosses the arms, then the efficiency of star formation should depend on the frequency
at which it happens. On this basis, Wyse (1986) proposed that
Σψ ∝(Ω −ΩP).
(3.22)
ΩP is the angular velocity of the spiral pattern. This term should in fact come in combination
with other factors, depending on which of the processes adopted above is considered (e.g., one
of the (> 3.10), (> 3.12), (> 3.14), (> 3.15), (> 3.19), and (> 3.21)). Considering that ΩP of
the density wave is small with respect to the angular frequency of the material, the factor above
becomes simply Ω. Wyse (1986) combined it with a cloud-cloud assumption to compute the
SFR as Σψ ∝Σ
HI(Ω −ΩP), and it was generalized in Wyse and Silk (1989) in Σψ ∝Σn
HIΩ
(n = 1,2). Interestingly, in combination with the total gas density rather than HI, the spiral arm
term (>3.22) suggests again a form similar to (>3.17) even if it is for a totally different reason!
This form seems to be robust in the sense that it accommodates various theories.
Before closing this section, it should be noted that active star formation is present even when
no strong spiral structure is present (e.g., Kennicutt 1989; Tan 2000), and no clear-cut differ-
ences in star formation rates between grand-design and flocculent spirals was ever established.
Maybe after all, the differences induced by the grand design spiral arms are minor, organizing
the star formation in a different way rather than enhancing it.
2.3.9 Galactic Inﬂuences on the SFR: A Tentative Summary
Many theoretical ideas lead to different relations between various quantities and the SFR. The
problem is that some of these ideas actually drive to the same relationships (at least under some
of the possible assumptions). For instance, the dynamical factor Ω can appear as a reference to
spiral arms or instabilities of the disk. Also, the ISM phase balance can under some conditions
be directly related to the gas density (and thus hide in another index of a dependence on Σgas). In
the case ofa self-regulated starformation rate (constant Q), the same expression can be obtained
based on different Q definitions (collapse versus dispersion due to Coriolis forces or shear).
Moreover, the proposed explanations are not totally exclusives: the self-regulation (Q = ) could
be view as an approximation of the H2/HI equilibrium regulated by SN feedback!

152 3
Star Formation in Galaxies
Following the approach of Larson (1992) already mentioned, it is possible to try to write a
general form for the factors affecting the star formation rate, by combining all the previously
described ones. For a flat rotation curve, this general form would be (willingly forgetting other
possible factors, e.g., the stellar surface density)
Σψ ∝Σα
gasΩβPγ
(3.23)
(with α between 1 and 4, β between 0 and 2, γ between 0 and ∼1). Unfortunately, these indexes
are partly degenerated since, e.g., Σgas and Ω both decline with radius within galaxies. It will
then be hard to derive them from observations alone.
Nevertheless, observational studies (see > Sect. 4) will allow us to have a minimum of
constraints on the possible relation between star formation and various quantities. This may
help us to decide among the various processes at play which is the leading one (but it is already
visible that this task will be hard). Even if the physical basis for these relations stay under debate,
they will still provide useful constraints for models of evolution of galaxies.
2.4 Starbursts and Peculiar Star Formation Regimes
Up to this point, star formation has been discussed as a secular process occurring in a galactic
disk. There are however different situations.
Starbursts regions (or galaxies) are characterized by elevated star formation rates, with an
unusually high efficiency (e.g., Larson 1992, and references therein). Characterized by some
signatures such as blue colors (Searle et al. 1973) and strong high-excitation emission lines, they
form an ill-defined family of objects (e.g., Meurer et al. 1995, 1999) with large SFR (in absolute
value, but also relative to the past average SFR, or in surface density) and short consumption
timescales (the SFR is so high that the gas reservoir would be quickly depleted at this rate). As
a result, the term apply to a number of objects that are not necessarily similar (especially when
comparing high and low redshift ones).
Starbursts are often found in the nuclear regions of galaxies. This nuclear emission is found
in an increasing fraction of galaxies with types going from early (8% in S0) to late (80% in
Sc-Im) (Kennicutt 1998a, and references within). >Eq. 3.15 suggests that the high level of star
formation in central regions could be related to the elevated densities and high values of κ that
are found there.
Starbursts are also revealed in the far infrared (FIR) with the observation of galaxies with
very large luminosities (up to L⊙) corresponding to SFR up to 1,000 M⊙year−, occurring in
very dense molecular gas, in which the optical radiation is almost totally absorbed. Kennicutt
(1998a) reminds that the most luminous galaxies in FIR are systems in which a mass of gas
corresponding to the total ISM of a normal galaxy is compressed into a small area and entirely
transformed into stars.
It is tempting to relate the peculiar regime of starbursts to tidal encounters and mergers that
could be responsible for enhancing the SFR by factor 10–100 (Kennicutt 1998a). Recent inter-
actions and mergers simulations by, e.g., Di Matteo et al. (2008) produce a modest enhancement
of the SFR (by a factor 5) but the modes of star formation during major mergers may need high-
resolution simulations and hence be hard to catch in simulations in general (see, e.g., Teyssier
et al. 2010, obtaining a gain of a factor 10 in star formation efficiency with high-resolution
simulations). Barnes (2004) proposed that a shock-induced mode of star formation takes place

Star Formation in Galaxies 3
153
during such interactions. This mode is usually not taken into account (and hard to model in
general) but provided a good fit to the observations of the Mice system.

Before discussing the various observational evidences and especially those linked to theoretical
expectations of the previous section, it should be presented how the SFR is actually measured.
A famous review concerning tracers of star formation can be found in Kennicutt (1998a) whose
formula are widely used. The reader is referred to this paper for many interesting discussions
on the various tracers of the SFR. Recently, Calzetti et al. (2009) reviewed the subject, focusing
in the long wavelength range (infrared and radio).
Almost all SFR measurements rely on few principles and assumptions. The main idea is to
have an observable linked to the amount of recent star formation, i.e., of stars formed within
the last time interval δt, with δt being small with respect to the age of the galaxy. Since massive
stars do have short lifetimes (that can be associated to δt), astronomers can use them (or their
observable effects) to derive the SFR. Once the amount of massive stars formed during δt is
known, it is easy to calculate the total amount of stars formed (in solar masses)by extrapolating
over the full IMF and divide by δt to get a rate (the SFR).
Often, it is not possible to actually count massive stars. Instead, some emission (that will
be called a “star formation tracer”) due to their presence is measured, and the actual SFR is
deduced from the flux detected through calibrations described below.
A purely “instantaneous” rate cannot be measured. All tracers have different typical
timescales associated, depending on the mass range of the stars they are related to. Thus, the
tracers are calibrated by assuming the SFR is constant over the typical timescale δt for this
tracer (e.g., the lifetimes of stars responsible for it). In other words, an assumption of steady
state is made to compute the SFR. Note that the SFR deduced; in this way is well an estimate
assuming that the SFR was constant over the timescale δt, and not the average of the actual SFR
during this period (>Fig. 3-1 shows that the two are not equivalent).
Finally, in the following, “primary tracer” is used for measurements directly related to mas-
sive stars. The expression “secondary tracer” is used for those tracers that were introduced
(at least historically) by empirically noting a correlation with a primary tracer that has been
used to calibrate the secondary one. It is true that often more detailed models were constructed
to recalibrate secondary tracers (at the price of more complex models), but these works were
still motivated by the empirical evidence of a correlation in the first place.
3.1 Proto-Stars, Young Stars and Stellar Remnants
The Milky Way is a peculiar case in terms of SFR measurement.Most of the techniques detailed
below cannot be applied, at least without some modifications. However, its SFR has been stud-
ied, mostly by using as SFR tracers the number of “young objects,” as it was done by Schmidt
(1959) early on. Guibert et al. (1978) provide a list of objects related to recent star formation
that can be used to trace the SFR. It includes OB stars, giant HII regions, supernova remnants,
and pulsars. In the recent years, the SFR in our galaxy was studied by detecting OB stars in

The dotted curve shows the FUV luminosity (a SFR tracer) of a 108 M⊙instantaneous burst of age
T as a function of T. The horizontal line shows the UV luminosity generated by a constant SFR of
1 M⊙year−1 during 108 year. All these populations have the same average SFR within 108 year, the
timescale for the FUV emission. However, the SFR deduced from L(FUV) assuming a constant SFR
can vary by 2 orders of magnitude
the far infrared. The ISM, being transparent at this wavelength, it is possible to detect star-
forming regions as point-like source over the whole galaxy (e.g., Bronfman et al. 2000; Luna
et al. 2006). It is also possible to detect young stellar objects (YSOs) and thus derive the SFR
from pre-main-sequence objects themselves (see Robitaille and Whitney 2010).
Even if this “resolved approach” cannot be used in general for external galaxies, it is
mentioned here because the spatial resolution of current and future observatories allow to con-
template the possibility to use a similar approach in our nearest neighbors (see, e.g., Whitney
et al. 2008, for YSOs in the LMC).
3.2 Stellar Continuum
The continuum spectrum of a galaxy is the superposition of the emission of many generation
of stars. In the UV, this emission is dominated by the hot young massive stars (above a few
solar masses) and can thus be used to trace the “recent” star formation, over the lifetime of the
contributing stars (of the order of 100 Myr).
For a steady state and a chosen IMF (and its mass limits), it is possible to relate the SFR and
the luminosity of stars. Following Kennicutt (1998a), it can be written
ψν(M⊙year−) = C × Lν(ergs−Hz−).

nosity to reach 90% of its 1 Gyr value for a constant SFR, as well as the value of C at that time.
Because the SFR should be derived for massive stars with short lifetimes, this method should be
used only in the UV, but the figure extends the results to the optical/near infrared for educative
purpose. Short timescales are clearly obtained in the UV that makes a good tracer on ∼100 Myr
timescale. Fortunately, for reasonable IMFs, the Lν luminosity per unit frequency in the UV has
a relatively flat spectrum so that the calibration factor C depends weakly on the wavelength in
this range. The various proposed calibrations however vary by 0.3 dex, depending on the stellar
libraries used (Kennicutt 1998a). Calibration factors (and associated timescales) are provided
in >Table 3-1 for several common photometric bands.
The “U” bands are intermediate: their flux to SFR conversion factor is close to the UV one,
but the timescales are getting larger (about 500 Myr to the 90% level as defined previously) and
thus are not as good to trace recent star formation.
3.3 Recombination Emission Lines
3.3.1 Motivation and General Approach
The strong flux emitted by young massive stars at shorter wavelengths than the Lyman limit
ionizes the gas surrounding them. The recombination lines that follow can be used to estimate

this ionizing flux and hence the SFR. The most famous SFR tracer among recombination lines
is Hα (owing to its strength), but many lines from the Balmer, Pashen, and Brackett series have
been used too.
For Hβ, it is possible to write (Osterbrock and Ferland 2006), assuming that all the photons
are absorbed and reemitted:
L(Hβ) = hνHβNphotons
αeff

(3.25)
where Nphotons is the number of ionizing photons. Nphotons can be obtained from stellar
synthesis codes (such as Starburst99 for instance). For a temperature of 10,000 K and Oster-
brock case B recombination, the recombination coefficients are αeff
Hβ = .−cms−,
αB = .−cms−. Relations for other hydrogen recombination lines can be computed
using the relative intensities of these lines with respect to Hβ (Table 4.4 of Osterbrock and
Ferland 2006). For instance, in the above-mentioned conditions, L(Hα)/L(Hβ) = .,
L(Pα)/L(Hβ) = ., L(Pβ)/L(Hβ) = ..
It is thus possible to use these relationships to compute the luminosity in any recombination
line for a constant SFR and thus calibrate a relation between this luminosity and the SFR. For the
same assumptions used for the stellar continuum (Kroupa 2001 IMF, constant SFR for 1 Gyr),
the 90% level is reached in 6.5 Myr, almost instantaneously with respect to the long timescales
obtained even with the UV continuum. This comes from the fact that the ionizing photons are
on average emitted by more massive stars with shorter lifetimes than the one dominating the
UV spectrum.

3.3.2 Application to Hα
Since Hα is a strong emission line with a short timescale, relatively easy to observe, moreover
with good spatial resolution, it is an important tracer of star formation, and this section presents
some more considerations about it. Using the method and formulae underlined in >Sect. 3.3.1,
it is possible to calibrate the relation between the Hα line intensity and the SFR:
ψHα(M⊙year−) = C × L(Hα)(erg s−).
(3.26)
The coefficient is given in >Table 3-1, along with other SFR indicators.
Despite the advantages of Hα, making it the preferred SFR tracer, many uncertainties and
difficulties exist. First, a dispersion between calibrations of 30% is due to various stellar models
(e.g., Kennicutt 1998a), and the result is also very sensitive to the IMF slope in the very upper
mass range. Hα, in order to be a precise tracer of the SFR must take into account the extinction
that reduces the observed luminosity (see discussion on the role of dust in >Sect. 3.4). When
narrow-band filters around Hα are used tomeasure the luminosityofthe line, it is alsonecessary
to take into account the contamination of the Hα line by the neighboring [NII] λ 6548 and 6584
lines. In the absence of spectroscopy, typical ratios are used, see, e.g., the appendix of Boselli
et al. (2001) for ratios given as a function of morphological type.
A fraction of the ionizing photons is in fact absorbed by dust rather than by the gas. Thus,
the calibration should be corrected for this fraction that is not participating in the ionization.
This fraction is estimated to be equal to 20% by Charlot et al. (2002), 0–30% by Bicker and
Fritze-v. Alvensleben (2005) depending on the metallicity of the object.
Finally, a fraction of the ionizing photons may escape the HII regions. While in individual
regions this escape fraction can be high (15–50%), it is thought to be lower on the scale of
galaxies as a whole (Kennicutt 1998a, and references therein).
3.3.3 Lyman α
From the above, it is easy to find that the Lyα luminosity should be large, and thus should
be a good tracer of star formation. This emission line has in fact been used in the recent
years to search and find high redshift star-forming galaxies. The relations Lyα/Hβ = 23.1 and
Lyα/Hα = 8.11 are obtained for a 10,000 K case B scenario (Osterbrock and Ferland 2006)
and combined with, e.g., ( > 3.26) should allow us to derive the SFR from the Lyα luminos-
ity. It is however a poor SFR tracer, and measurements are systematically lower than these
predictions.
The path length of Lyα photons in the ISM is extremely large due to resonant scatter-
ing by hydrogen atoms. Thus, they have increased chances to be absorbed by even a modest
amount of dust. As a result, the resultant Lyα emission is quickly decoupled from star formation
(Giavalisco et al. 1996). A Lyα escape fraction f (fraction escaping the galaxy and measurable
by observers) can be defined by comparing the ratio of Lyα to other SFR tracers (Hα, Hβ, UV).
Following such methods, f ∼.is found in the nearby universe and at redshift ∼0.3 (Dehar-
veng et al. 2008). The escape fraction seems to increase with redshift, with values of f ∼0.2–0.3
around redshift 2–3, and f ∼at very large redshifts (Gronwall et al. 2007; Cassata et al. 2011).
This evolution, statistical in nature, may tell us about the evolution of the dust and of the ISM
properties with redshift but still relies on few samples. These results are based on other tracers

158 3
Star Formation in Galaxies
to measure the actual SFR, and the escape fraction is deduced by comparison. As a conclusion,
Lyα is more a tool (to study the statistical properties of the ISM or to detect objects) than a
quantitative SFR tracer.
3.4 The Role of Dust
The primary SFR tracers (recombination lines, UV emission) are based on luminosities which
are (in most cases) sensitive to the attenuation of light by interstellar dust. The energy “lost” in
the UV star light is found again in the mid and far infrared where the emission of the dust grains
can be measured. In this section, corrections of primary tracers for the effect of dust attenuation
are discussed, as well as the use of the dust emission itself as a SFR tracer.
3.4.1 Extinction Corrections from Recombination Lines
For Hα (or other recombination lines), corrections are usually estimated from line ratios.
Observed line ratios are compared to the predictions of case B recombination, and the differ-
ence is ascribed to the differential extinction between the two wavelengths. Combined with an
extinction curve, it is then possible to estimate the amount of attenuation of, e.g., Hα: A(Hα).
Typical attenuations are found between 0 and 2 mag (e.g., Kennicutt 1998a). Another method
consists in using the thermal radio to Hα ratio (e.g., Bell 2003).
In most cases, the Balmer ratio is used, for which Hα/Hβ = .in the T = 10,000 K
case B. This view is however challenged by the models of Charlot and Longhetti (2001). When
such models are used to simultaneously fit extinction and various line intensities, a dependence
on the metallicity of the intrinsic Hα/Hβ ratio is found, which affects the derived extinctions
(Brinchmann et al. 2004; Gilbank et al. 2010). This dependence is due to the fact that metallic-
ity affects the cooling and thus the electron temperature of the HII regions. The typical value of
2.847 is given for T = 10,000 K, but the ratio does depend on the temperature (Osterbrock and
Ferland 2006).
Observational uncertainties also affect the Hα/Hβ ratio, especially if narrow-band imaging
has been used to obtain the data. As mentioned in the >Sect. 3.3.2, the Hα has to be corrected
for the neighboring [NII] lines. Also, the Balmer absorption features in the underlying stellar
spectra have to be corrected for. In the absence of good spectroscopic data allowing to measure
it, a standard absorption of 2–5 Å in equivalent width is often used (e.g., Boselli et al. 2001).
3.4.2 Extinction Corrections in the UV
The UV attenuation can be large (reaching over 4 mag). The energy lost by the absorption of UV
(and optical) photons is reemitted in the mid and far infrared (between 8 and 1,000 μm). Usu-
ally, the total luminosity emited in this range is estimated on the basis of a few available bands
(e.g., the IRAS 60 and 100 μm in the past, the Spitzer and Herschel bands in the more modern
time). Here, this total infrared luminosity is generically called L(FIR) although different defi-
nitions (extrapolating to different infrared wavelength range and using different observations)
exist (e.g., Boquien et al. 2010b, and references therein).

Star Formation in Galaxies 3
159
Because of this balance of energy, the UV attenuation is related to the L(FIR)/L(UV) ratio.
UV-derived star formation rates can be corrected using this ratio (Cortese et al. 2008). A limi-
tation of the method is that at low SFR, part of the FIR emission can come from the heating by
old stars, leading to an overestimateof the extinction (e.g., Iglesias-Páramo et al. 2006). Cortese
et al. (2008) proposed a method correcting for this effect by using various color indexes to trace
the balance between old and young stars.
In many cases, it is difficult to have far infrared data, especially at high redshift. A popular
method (although uncertain) in that case consists in using the slope of the spectrum in the
UV (β), which is empirically related to the L(FIR)/L(UV) ratio (in the absence of dust, the
UV slope is flat, the observed slope, by comparison, can be ascribed to dust). The method is
however known to suffer some problems. For instance, different attenuation curves may affect
the shape of the spectrum, independently of the amount of dust itself. And mostly, it was shown
that local normal galaxies and starbursts provide quite different relations between β and the UV
attenuation (Buat et al. 2010; Muñoz-Mateos et al. 2009; Seibert et al. 2005; Kong et al. 2004;
Meurer et al. 1999).
3.4.3 Other Considerations on the Dust Attenuation
In the absence of a better indication, “standard” extinctions are sometimes applied to large sam-
ples. However, the extinction may depend on the SFR itself (Hopkins et al. 2001; Bell 2003) or
on other properties such as the galactic mass or metallicity. While the trends in the nearby uni-
verse are relatively well studied, such relationships at high redshift are very uncertain, mostly
in reason of the very different selection criteria of various samples (e.g., Gilbank et al. 2010).
It is believed that moving toward higher redshift, the extinction increases (as the cosmic SFR
does). Eventually, the extinction should decline again when a metal-poor era is reached, and
there is some claim of indirect measurements of this effect in the recent high-redshift studies
(e.g., Cucciati et al. 2012). The question of the cosmic evolution of dust extinction is however
still open and debated.
Another point to note is that extinction corrections are more difficult to apply on small
spatial scales than on the global scales of galaxies. For instance, in the case of the UV attenuation
estimated from the far-infrared radiation, the heating of a small region can come from UV
photons emitted in a neighboring region rather than from the one studied.
The UV emission coming from older stars than the Hα emission, the position of the vari-
ous type of stars may be decoupled, and their distribution with respect to dust different. In that
case, attenuation derived for a population may not apply to another one. In fact, it is thought
that the nebular lines are attenuated by roughly twice as much dust as the stellar continuum
(because young stars are found inside dust-rich molecular clouds, while the old stellar popula-
tion has drifted away from the dusty regions (Bell 2003; Calzetti et al. 1994) or because the dust
clouds have themselves a finite lifetime (Charlot and Fall 2000). In her “recipe for reddening,”
Calzetti (1997) suggests that the reddening of the stellar continuum is 0.44× the reddening in
the Balmer lines.
3.4.4 Far-Infrared Star Formation Rates
Since a large amount of the stellar emission in the UV is absorbed by dust and the
energy is radiated in the far infrared, this dust emission itself can be used as a SFR tracer.

since they dominate the heating of the dust. It however depends on the star formation history
because of the contribution to the dust heating by older stars. Calibrations published by vari-
ous authors using the same IMF as in the primary tracer table are provided. These tracers were

Buat and Xu (1996) found that galaxies follow a relation of the type L(FIR) = , Å ×
L(, Å) where L(2,000 Å) is the UV luminosity, corrected for extinction, and L(FIR) is an
estimate of the total luminosity emitted in the FIR range. Combining such a relation to a cali-
bration between the UV emission and the SFR, one can calibrate a relation between the SFR and
the FIR emission (Buat and Xu 1996; Kennicutt 1998a) (>Table 3-2). This relation is however
dispersedby a factor 3 (Buat and Xu 1996), and the method should be valid in galaxies with high
star formation rates where dust is mostly heated by young stars, with a negligible contribution
by older stars.
Under the assumption that the ISM is totally opaque, the whole luminosity emitted by the
stars should be found in the infrared. It is then possible to compute the infrared luminosity
L(FIR) for a constant SFR. Buat et al. (2008) proposed for the same IMF adopted above:
log(ψ[M⊙year−]) = log(L(FIR)[L⊙]) −..
(3.27)
This relation cannot be applied blindly to, e.g., dwarf galaxies and system with low SFRs that are
usually suffering low extinctions and in systems with low activity in which the dust is heated by
lower mass stars, with longer timescales (but, e.g., Bell 2003, proposed a calibration taking into
account this effect.)
Instead of using the total far-infrared emission as above, some authors have argued that
it is best to use monochromatic far-infrared indicators. The main reason is that it avoids the
need to extrapolate from few measured points to compute the total luminosity and that some
wavelengths may be associated in a closer way to the hot dust directly tracing star formation.
Calzetti et al. (2009) reviewed many calibrations proposed for the Spitzer telescope observations
at 24 μm and proposed relationships for the monochromatic luminosities at 70 and 160μm. The
8 μm emission was also studied but this wavelength is a poor tracer of star formation (Calzetti
et al. 2007). Boquien et al. (2010a)provided a SFR surface density–surface brightness calibration
for the Herschel PACS bands at 100 and 160 μm on the basis of Herschel observations of M33.

Herschel SPIRE 250 μm observations of M33 were used by Verley et al. (2010b) to provide a
calibration of the SFR from 250 μm.
3.4.5 The Mixed Tracers
Finally, it was recently proposed a family of “mixed” tracers, combining optical or UV, and
infrared observables.
As mentioned above, the SFR deduced from the infrared is either empirically derived or is
derived under the assumption of full transfer of the energy from the UV to the infrared. For
galaxies of low masses, this assumption is usually wrong. It has been proposed to compute the
SFR in a more general situation by combining an infrared tracer (that gives us the amount of
energy transferred to the infrared by dust), and an optical/UV tracer (that gives us the amount
of young stars whose light is not extinguished by dust. Iglesias-Páramo et al. (2006) proposed
such a mixed tracer:
ψ = ψUV,obs + (−η)ψdust.
(3.28)
The first term is the SFR derived from the observed UV luminosity (following ( > 3.24)), the
second term is the SFR traced by dust ( > 3.27). η accounts for the IR cirrus emission: this
diffuse component of dust heated by the interstellar radiation field generated by old stars, and
not directly tracing the SFR. The value of η depends on the samples under study. From 0 for
starbursts, it can reach 0.4 for star-forming galaxies (Iglesias-Páramo et al. 2006; Hirashita et al.
2003; Bell 2003).
Kennicutt et al. (2009) proposed several calibrations of mixed tracers composed of Hα (or
[OII]) lines and IR (or radio) tracers. They take the form:
ψ = C(L(line, observed) + a L(dust)).
(3.29)
C is the calibration factor that relatesdirectly the luminosity in a line and the SFR. L(dust) is the
luminosity in a tracer sensible to the dust-extinguished SFR. Kennicutt et al. (2009) provided
values of a when 8 and 24 μm, total infrared, or 1.4 GHz luminosities are used. These values are
determined by fitting the coefficients using as a reference the SFR deduced from the Hα line
corrected for extinction using recombination lines ratio. Expressed under the form of (>3.29),
the a L(dust) term is nothing else than a statistical extinction correction. In order to study the
spatial distribution of star formation within nearby galaxies, Bigiel et al. (2008) defined a mixed
tracer by a combination of 24 μm (from Spitzer) and UV (from GALEX) luminosities since
these two wavelength are observed with a similar resolution.
A nonexhaustive list of mixed tracers that have been proposed in the literature can be found
in >Table 3-3.
3.5 Other Spectral Diagnostics
3.5.1 [OII] 3,727 Å Forbidden Line
Especially at high redshift, the oxygen emission doublet [OII]λ3727 is often used because of
its strength to detect galaxies and attempt to measure their SFR. Such forbidden lines are how-
ever not as directly related to the stellar emission as the primary tracers. The line luminosity

is much more sensitive to temperature and ionization state of the gas than recombination lines
such as the Balmer lines. The [OII] line has been calibrated empirically by noticing that a good

given Hβ flux. Kennicutt (1998a) also mentions a large scatter (up to 1 dex) for the [OII]/Hα
ratio.
A proper calibration has to take into account the respective extinction in the two lines.
Kewley et al. (2004) found an average ratio of [OII]/Hα = 1.2 ± 0.3 that can be combined with
a Hα-calibrated SFR to compute the SFR. However, this oxygen line is clearly affected by
metallicity (see >Sect. 3.8.1).
3.5.2 [CII] 158 µm Fine structure line
The [CII] 158 μm line is the more important coolant of the warm neutral interstellar medium,
while the heating of the gas is related to the incident FUV emission (Malhotra et al. 2001,
and references therein). It is thus linked to star formation in an indirect way. Malhotra et al.
(2001) presented a statistical comparison of the line emission with the far-infrared one: the
ratio L([CII])/L(FIR) has a value about −with a large dispersion (factor 50). They also
found a trend with the temperature of the dust, indicated by the ratio of the luminosities at 60
and 100 μm. Within M31, Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. (2006) showed that the [CII] line traces
the regions of star formation, identified with Hα or at 24 μm.
While opening a possible large area of interest for the future, this line is not yet a popular
tracer of star formation.
3.6 Radio Emission
The radio emission in normal galaxies come from synchrotron radiation from relativistic elec-
trons and free-free emission from HII regions (see the review of Condon 1992, for all this
section). The relativistic electrons are thought to have their sources in the supernovae rem-
nants (SNRs) appearing in galaxies after the explosions of massive stars. The radio emission is
thus associated to short-lived massive stars. Since the FIR emission is also linked to star forma-
tion (see >Sect. 3.4.4), a relation between the radio emission and the FIR emission should be

observed, and it is indeed the case in nearby galaxies The FIR-radiocorrelation can be expressed
as (Condon 1992, and references therein)
log(Sν) = log(FIR) −q.
(3.30)
q is observed to have a median value of 2.3 at 1.4 GHz (even if the relation is not perfectly
linear, especially at low luminosity where the radio emission is lower than predicted by this
equation). Though this relation, the radio emission can be considered as a secondary tracer of
star formation. Simple models allow to reproduce this relation between SFR, FIR, and radio
emission, although the physics is not clearly understood (see Condon 1992, for a much longer
discussion). Bell (2003) noted that both the FIR and radio emission underestimate the SFR at
low luminosities and proposed a calibration taking this effect into account.
Because the electrons travel in the galaxy before emitting their radiation, this indicator may
not bring spatial information on very small scales. Murgia et al. (2002) however suggests that
the Hα and radio continuum trace each other well even on scales of a few kpc.
3.7 X-Ray Luminosity
Star-forming galaxies host a number of sources of X-ray emission: high mass X-ray binaries,
supernovae remnants and hot plasma (Ranalli et al. 2003). Observations show that the X-ray
luminosity (Ranalli et al. 2003) and the numberof high mass X-ray binaries (Grimm et al. 2003)
correlate with other SFR tracers, what allows to derive the SFR from the X-ray luminosity. The
relations provided by Grimm et al. (2003) are included in >Table 3-4. The dispersion obtained
in the various relations is typically 0.25–0.3 dex. It is also possible to develop more complex
models linking this secondary indicator to the SFR (Grimm et al. 2003).

3.8 Additional Factors
All the tracers have been discussed above adopting an IMF and assuming a solar metallic-
ity. Adopting other assumptions could change the calibrations of the SFR tracers easily by a
factor up to 2 (see below), even for the primary tracers. Another difficulty is the steady-state
assumption that may not always hold. These aspects are discussed in the rest of the section.
3.8.1 The Eﬀect of the Metallicity
The primary tracers of the SFR depend on the metallicity as low-metallicity stars have higher
temperatures, higher UV luminosities and ionizing fluxes. Bicker and Fritze-v. Alvensleben
(2005) calibrated the dependence on the metallicity of the C factors in (> 3.24) and (> 3.26).
Both calibration factors vary with the metallicity by a factor about 2 between low and high
metallicity. The reader is refereed to Bicker and Fritze-v. Alvensleben (2005) for quantitative
values.
The [OII] line emission can also be computed through detailed modeling, and Bicker and
Fritze-v. Alvensleben (2005) provide also a calibration of its dependence on metallicity. The
influence of metallicity on the luminosity of this line was also investigated by empirical stud-
ies that established that the [OII]/Hα ratio does vary with metallicity. This dependence was
calibrated by Kewley et al. (2004). Mouhcine et al. (2005) however showed that even this cali-
bration does not catch all the physics at play. They found a non-monotonic relation between the
[OII]/Hα ratio and the metallicity. They also found that, in addition, the ionization state affects
the ratio, especially in metal-poor active starbursts.
Technically, all the secondary tracers calibrated on one of the primary tracers (with an
explicit dependence on metallicity) should present the same dependence on metallicity.
3.8.2 Choice of the IMF
Since the primary tracers are related to the more massive stars, but the SFR is integrated over
the whole IMF, the calibration factors are very sensitive to the form of the IMF (that determines
how many massive stars are present per unit stellar mass formed). A proper computation is
necessary to provide a calibration. >Table 3-5 quotes a few transformation formulas that can
be found in the literature and provides an idea of the uncertainty due to the IMF. Seeing these

numbers, it is obvious that the choice of the IMF can affect the SFR by a factor at least as large as
the metallicity influence or the fraction of Lyman continuum photons not contributing to the
ionization of the gas.
There is good reason to think that the IMF is universal (Bastian et al. 2010). In that case, such
a global correction should allow us to switch from one IMF to another. However, the idea of
variations of the IMF come back to haunt extragalactic astronomers frequently. GALEX allowed
discovery of a surprisingly high fraction of galaxies with extended UV emission, interpreted as
extended star formation (see >Sect. 4.3). This discovery, together with the fact that Hα (very
sensible on the IMF slope at high masses) had not revealed this star formation, previously led
to some speculations about the possible variation of the IMF with radius within galaxies, prob-
ably through a physical dependence on other quantity, such as the gas density or the total SFR.
Krumholz and McKee (2008) proposed a gas density threshold for the formation of massive
stars, while Pflamm-Altenburg et al. (2007) suggested that the IMF for a whole galaxy (what
they call the integrated galactic initial mass function, IGIMF) results from the combination of
the cluster mass distribution and the IMF within clusters. In their approach, the maximum stel-
lar mass in a star cluster is limited by the cluster mass, and the maximum cluster mass depends
on the SFR. As a result, they found that the IGIMF does depend on the SFR. If confirmed,
such a variation would have important consequences, the first one being that the calibrations
discussed above would be false, especially at low SFRs.
This motivated several studies on measurements of the Hα/UV ratio in small galaxies and
outer parts of spirals and its interpretation, with conflicting results. In addition to the difficulty
due to measurements and calibrations, the situation is complicated by the fact that this ratio may
also depend on other factors (e.g., different attenuations, variation of the fraction of ionizing
photons absorbed by the dust, micro-history of the star formation: see next section). As a result,
a clear situation has not emerged yet, but several works are ongoing on the subject.
A variation of the IMF with the redshift has also been advocated (with a top-heavy IMF at
high redshift), for instance, to reconcile the evolution of the SFR and stellar mass cosmic average
densities (e.g., Wilkins et al. 2008a).
In summary, suggestions of IMF variations are proposed in various contexts, and their
possibility should be kept in mind. However, the subject stays under debate because of the
complexity of the observations and the possible alternate explanations.
3.8.3 Eﬀect of the Star Formation Micro-History
The steady state assumption was applied to calibrate the relationships between star formation
tracers and SFR described before. This seems to be a reasonable assumption when considering
normal galaxies as a whole. However, it cannot be applied to, e.g., very small individual regions
inside galaxies (e.g., individual star clusters). A minimum scale is needed to average out the
stochasticity of star formation. The assumption may also break down for starbursts (or post-
starbursts), in which the star formation history is undergoing (or has undergone) large and
sudden variations, or in small galaxies, where for stochastic reasons the micro-history of star
formation (over the last 10–100 Myr) may present significant variations. When there is reason
to believe that the star formation history was not constant over δt, time corresponding to the
timescale of the tracer used, a meaningful SFR cannot be derived with this tracer. It is still possi-
ble to study these objects, but it is then necessary to obtain data constraining, e.g., the total mass
that was formed during a star-forming event together with the age and duration of this event.

166 3
Star Formation in Galaxies
Using resolved stars, McQuinn et al. (2010, and references therein) found that the duration
of starbursts in nearby dwarf galaxies is several 100 Myr (longer than many other estimations of
a starburst duration), allowing to derive reasonable SFR for tracers with similar timescales (e.g.,
UV). But they also found that Hα measurements sometimes provide a different result because
the SFR fluctuates on a few Myr timescale. Boissier et al. (2008) also suggested that the colors
of their LSB galaxies may be due to a succession of active star formation and quiescent phases.
The effect of such bursts and micro-star formation history on SFR tracers (and their ratio,
especially Hα/UV) has been much discussed in, e.g., Weilbacher and Fritze-v. Alvensleben
(2001), Iglesias-Páramo et al. (2004), Boquien et al. (2007), and Boselli et al. (2009). It is how-
ever difficult to disentangle from other possible effects, e.g., the IMF variations discussed in the
previous section.

Star Formation Observed in Galaxies
Provided the assumption and limitations discussed in >Sect. 3, it is possible to compare the
SFR actually observed to the theoretical ideas presented in >Sect. 2 and more generally discuss
some empirical properties of star formation on galactic scales.
4.1 Star Formation in the Local Galaxies
Surveys of the local volume show that star formation in galaxies depends on their luminos-
ity, gaseous content, or morphological type. This can be seen in >Fig. 3-3 reproduced from
Karachentsev and Kaisin (2010) who combined Hα observations from galaxies within 8 Mpc
(in addition, the overplotted open square indicates typical values for the Milky Way). The
SFR is also found to depend on other quantities, such as colors (as more luminous galax-
ies are also redder). Another Hα survey of the local 11 Mpc can be found in Kennicutt et al.
(2008). A similar study based on the ultraviolet tracer of star formation (instead of Hα)
can be found in Lee et al. (2009). Some differences between Hα and UV are found espe-
cially in the smallest galaxies; see
> Sect. 3.8.2 for a possible interpretation. Many other
surveys in, e.g., Hα, UV, and FIR provide different views according to their selection criteria
(as discussed in the review of Kennicutt 1998a).
The SFR range from ∼0 in early type galaxies to a few M⊙year−in the Milky Way
and relatively normal disk galaxies. However, much higher values of the SFR (up to several
100 M⊙year−) are also found in rarer starbursts (absent in the small local volume), usually
associated with signs of interaction or mergers.
4.2 The Schmidt Laws
4.2.1 Preliminary Considerations: Many “Laws”
An important part of the study of star formation on the scales of galaxies revolves around the so
called Schmidt Law. Although now largely in usage, the term “law” is not really appropriate as

spond to a constant ratio between y- and x-axis . The open square indicates values typical for our
Milky Way (e.g., Boissier and Prantzos 1999; van den Bergh 1999, and references therein)
it is really an empirical relationship, originally established between the number of young stars
in the Milky Way and the gas volume density by Schmidt (1959). This law can be writen in this
form:
ρψ ∝ρn
gas.
(3.31)
A lot of relations similar to (> 3.31) are called “Schmidt Laws.” The first variation is the use of
surface densities rather than volume densities, suggested by Sanduleak (1969) in his study of
the Schmidt Law in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a form that is very frequently used:
Σψ ∝Σn
gas.
(3.32)
This form has the advantage to be more easy to reach from observations (no need to know the
scale heights of disks). For a constant scale height, the index n of the volume law ( > 3.31) is
obviously the same as the one of the surface densities law (>3.32). Surface densities also appear
in many of the equations of >Sect. 2, suggested by various theories. Indeed, surface densities
in a rotating disk do play a physical role. Such a local relation between surface densities of star
formation rate and gas is called “Schmidt-Sanduleak Law” by Madore (2010).
Madore et al. (1974) noticed that the index of the Schmidt Law was different in the inner and
outer parts of M33, suggesting that the star formation law may change with radius within galax-
ies. Later, the “radial” Schmidt Law was studied on the basis of azimuthally averaged profiles
(Kennicutt 1989; Kennicutt 1998b; Wong and Blitz 2002; Boissier et al. 2003, 2007).

168 3
Star Formation in Galaxies
Finally, the Schmidt Law was also studied on the scale of whole galaxies, for instance, by
computing average surface densities of gas and SFR, as it is done in the seminal paper of Ken-
nicutt (1998b). Sometimes, the total SFR and total gas amount are directly compared one to
another (without normalization per, e.g., size). Following again Madore (2010), such a global
law (normalized or not) can be called a “Schmidt-Kennicutt Law.”
Very often, these various types of laws are compared one to another or plotted together
even if this should be done only with a lot of caution. For instance, if star formation follows
a local Schmidt Law, with a local critical density threshold, an analysis of the radial Schmidt
Law may provide a steeper slope, and the threshold may be hard to recover (see >Fig. 3-4).
Similar differences will exist between the local Schmidt Law and a measurement of the Schmidt-
Kennicutt Global Law (>Fig. 3-5). The illustrations of these differences (> Figs. 3-4 and >3-5)
are qualitative, but based on actual simple toy models. Leroy et al. (2008) proceeded to a similar
exercise: they implemented a pixel-by-pixel threshold in their data. When computing radially
averaged profiles, they found that the threshold damps the average SFR but does not bring it to 0.
Kennicutt (1989) had already noticed that the globally averaged star formation rate is more
strongly coupled to the HI density than the radial profile, illustrating again that the various

toy model implement the exact same local law as the previous one, its slope and threshold are
not recovered in an azimuthal analysis. The diﬀerences between the local and azimuthal laws are
sensitive to the covering fraction of the arms and its variation with radius

scales follow intrinsically different laws. These variations may partly explain the large range of
values found in the literature for the index n (0–4), although part of this scatter traces actual
differences (Kennicutt 1998a) and the limitations of a simple Schmidt Law parametrization
(Kennicutt 1997), in addition to the various SFR tracers used.
These variations (local, azimuthal, global) are not the only one. The results may also depend
on the SFR tracer used (see >Sect. 3), but also on the gas phase used. “Gas” refer in this chap-
ter to the total gas, but often only the neutral (mostly HI) or molecular (mostly H) is used2
(sometimes for observational reasons, sometimes because one wants to study a process spe-
cific to one phase). In most cases, H2 is actually not observable, and other molecules are used
to trace it. The most famous one is CO, but the XCO conversion factor carries large uncer-
tainties (see discussion in Calzetti and Kennicutt 2009). While some authors use a metallicity
dependence, other prefer to keep a constant value, what may directly affect the slope of the
Schmidt Law.
>Table 3-6 attempts to summarize the various type of laws and the phenomenon that they
probe.
Finally, the Schmidt Laws have been extended to include other factors than the gas density,
especiallytotest the various theoretical expectations discussed in >Sect. 2 (forinstance,>3.23).
This was motivated by the theoretical expectations, but also by the fact that a perfect fit cannot
2To account for the abundance of the other elements (mostly Helium), a corrective factor ∼1.36 is sometimes
used to go from HI to neutral and from Hto the molecular contents. On the other hand, some authors call
“total gas” the sum of the HI and Hmasses, i.e., the total mass of hydrogen, not including this factor.

be obtained with a pure dependence on the gas density. First, the observed simple Schmidt Law
presents a large scatter, believed tobe largerthan the observational uncertainties (e.g., Kennicutt
1998b). Second, it was noticed in many occasions that the Milky Way and a number of other
nearby galaxies present flat HI profiles, dominating the total gas at large radii, while their SFR
clearly decreases with radius. A pure dependence on the total or HI surface density alone (at
least in azimuthal profiles) cannot work (e.g., Blitz and Rosolowsky 2006; Boissier and Prantzos
1999; Ferguson et al. 1998; Kennicutt 1989).
4.2.2 Which Law Is Right?
Which of the Schmidt Laws described in >Sect. 4.2.1 should be used to, e.g., constrain our
models? It actually depends on the precise goal that is aimed at. To understand the very physics
of star formation (how gas is turned into stars), local studies are of prime importance (the issue
on which scale “local” studies should be performed is discussed below). Ifone wants toconstrain
a 2D model of galaxies, then again the local law brings more constraints.
However, it is well known that some properties depend mostly on the galactocentric radius
R (e.g., the fact that star-forming galaxies display an exponential disk, the abundance, and color
gradient). This is related to the fact that these quantities results from processes occurring on
timescales longer than the rotation time around the center of the galaxy. 1D models (depending
onlyon radius)are thus performed, especiallyin studies ofchemical evolution. Such models aim
at reproducing the radially averaged SF law (that tells us about how star formation is related to
the gas on timescales similar to the rotation time).
The total amount of gas is difficult to measureat high redshift, and a “reversed”Schmidt Law
is sometimes used to determine the amount of gas from the measured SFR (e.g., Péroux et al.
2011). If the starting observation is a surface brightness, then a local law should be used. On
the contrary, a global SFR measurementshould be combined with a global Schmidtt-Kennicutt.
Studying the global law is however not limited to the remote universe. One can see it also as
a study of the rate at which the global reservoir of gas in a galaxy becomes available for star
formation. In this case, the Schmidt Law is not really a wayto study the process of star formation
itself, but also the role of gas accretion or other external processes (e.g., Schiminovich et al.
2010).

Star Formation in Galaxies 3

4.2.3 Which Scale Is Right?
The question of the smallest scale on which the Schmidt Law should be studied is often asked.
Koda (2008) suggests that the properties of GMCs provide two limits. The first one is the “drift
scale.” Young stars have a relative velocity with respect to the gas clouds. In combination with
the typical timescale of the star formation tracer used (10 Myr for Hα, 100 Myr for the UV),
one can expect a separation between the SFR tracer and the physically related gas of 100 pc–
1 kpc. At smaller scales, the SFR tracer and the underlying gas are not physically related. The
second scale advocated by Koda (2008) is the separation between GMCs, which is typically
200 pc in the Milky Way, and provide an order of magnitude for other galaxies. The “statistical”
behavior of star formation can be seen only if the adopted typical resolution includes at least a
few GMCs. Some of the theoretical argument discussed in >Sect. 2 also apply on large scales
(e.g., gravitational collapse), up to the kpc scale. Thus, also from this point of view, the Schmidt
Law should be valid only on scales larger than at least a few 100 pc.
In their simulations, Feldmann et al. (2011) found that the scatter in the SFR–molecular gas
relationship increases rapidly with decreasing averaging scales. In their view, this is due to the
fact that the molecular gas is the local “instantaneous” one, while the SFR is time-averaged over
100 Myr timescales.
All these considerations suggest that the Schmidt Law should break down when looking at
scales smaller than a few 100 pc and that the scatter should increase when going from the kpc
scale downward. Observational work in nearby spirals have recently reached this level (local
laws on few 100 pc resolution), and an increase of the scatter of the empirical law when going
from the kpc to the 100 pc scales is actually observed (Thilker et al. 2007b; Kennicutt et al. 2007;
Bigiel et al. 2008; Verley et al. 2010a; Liu et al. 2011).
4.2.4 Schmidt Laws: Current Observational Status
The left panel of >Fig. 3-6, taken from Kennicutt (1998b), shows the Schmidt-Kennicutt Law,
with a best fit relation often used in the literature:
Σψ = .−(
Σgas
M⊙pc−)
.
.
(3.33)
It is impressive that this relationship holds on 5 orders of magnitudes of the gas density, show-
ing that there is certainly some level of universality in star formation, related to fundamental
processes. Also, the relation is very close (index 1.4 vs. 1.5) to the one proposed in the theo-
retical section on the simple basis of free fall as the main driver for star formation ( > 3.10).
However, it should be noticed that if one focus on one type of galaxies, e.g., normal spirals, then
the scatter remains important, and the slope is not so clearly established. Nevertheless, many
other studies have found this relation to give a satisfactory description in many different cases:
azimuthal profiles of outer disks (Boissier et al. 2007), tidal dwarf galaxies (Lisenfeld et al. 2001),
low surface brightness galaxies and dwarfs (may be with some shift downward with respect to
the canonical relation; see, e.g., Boissier et al. 2008; Wyder et al. 2009).
The right part of >Fig. 3-6 shows that a Schmidt Law including a dynamical factor (Ω ∝
/τ) suggestedon several theoretical grounds (see >Sect. 2) works as well as the simple Schmidt

one with respect to the other one.3 The fit by Kennicutt (1998b) for this law is simply

(3.34)
With the advent of high-quality UV data (GALEX satellite) and infrared data (Spitzer), it
became recently possible to obtain for large samples of nearby galaxies detailed maps of the
SFR (as a combination of UV and far infrared). A noticeable benchmark was obtained by the
THINGS team who combined such data with HI and CO maps allowing to proceed to a detailed
study of the local Schmidt-Sanduleak Law for a representative sample of spirals and dwarfs
(Bigiel et al. 2008; Leroy et al. 2008). Their results are discussed below in quite some details
because they represent the state of the art and as such establish a new reference (even if some
of their results had been found before on the basis of other samples or methods).
Bigiel et al. (2008) showed that the best local correlation is obtained between the SFR and
the molecular gas (see >Fig. 3-7). Their best fit is

Star Formation in Galaxies
Bigiel et al. (2008) interpret this index n = 1 as the fact that several clouds are included within
the surface studied at their resolution, and the value of ΣHis only dictated by the number of
clouds within the beam. Then, these clouds all form stars with a universal behavior. There is
no clear relation with HI (but a saturation, discussed in >Sect. 4.3). The SFR-total gas relation
presents a two-slope behavior. At high density, the relation is dominated by the linear relation
between the dominant molecular component and the SFR. At low density, it is dominated by
the HI/H2 transition. This relation is reproduced in the simple approach of Madore (2010) pre-
sented in >Sect. 2.3.5. It is also well reproduced by the Krumholz et al. (2009) model (>2.3.7),
that has been shown tobe alsoin agreement with otherobservations (e.g., in QSO absorbing sys-
tems). This model, however, is purely local (thus it should not be applied to global or azimuthal
observations blindly). Krumholz et al. (2009) in fact proposed that, e.g., gravitational instabil-
ities, spiral arms, and other global processes regulate in fact the total gas distribution. Then,
their theory predicts the right amount of molecular gas and the SFR.
Leroy et al. (2008) went one step further with respect to the results presented in >Fig. 3-7.
They tried to fit their data with a selection of several possible laws for the transformation of HI
into H2 and stars. Despite extensive tests, they could not definitely pinpoint one unique driver
for star formation. Many effects are observed (dependence of the ratio Σψ/Σgas on the, e.g.,
radius, orbital timescale, stellar density) but not a single theory can explain the observations
over the full range of gas density and in all type of galaxies beyond any doubt. They established
that the molecular fraction decreases with radius (what was suggested by previous observations
nevertheless)but also with decreasing stellar density, hydrostatic pressure, and orbital timescale
(or equivalently Ω). Those dependence are quantified in four scaling relations proposed in their
Sect. 5.4.5:
ΣH/ΣHI = .exp(−R/.R)
(3.36)
= Σ∗/M⊙pc−
(3.37)
= (P/.cm−KkB).
(3.38)
= (τorb/.yr)−,
(3.39)
where Ris the isophotal radius at 25mag arcsecin the B band and τorb is the orbital timescale,
thus τorb = πΩ−.
Note that the dependence on P can be hiding a dependence on the gas density, as already
mentioned (see Blitz and Rosolowsky 2006) and that Leroy et al. (2008) did not test relations
with “free” index such as ( > 3.23) but only precise relations predicted by various theories (if
several phenomenon contribute to the final relation, one can imagine that the final observed
relation could be in between the various predictions).
4.2.5 Starbursts and the Schmidt Law
Most of the discussion above concerns spirals and dwarf galaxies. Kennicutt (1998a) included
however in his study the circumnuclear starbursts (see >Fig. 3-6) and found an index .for the
Schmidt-Kennicutt Law. How can this value be reconciled with the linear relation of Bigiel et al.
(2008) with H2 (at these high densities, most of the gas is molecular)? Gao and Solomon (2004)
proposed that the SFR presents in fact a linear relation with the dense gas density (as traced
by HCN) rather than with the molecular content (as traced by CO). In “normal galaxies,” the
ratio of dense to molecular gas (the dense gas fraction) is constant. Thus, a linear relation is

Star Formation in Galaxies 3
175
obtained between the SFR and CO. In starbursts, the SFR is still proportional to the dense gas,
but the dense gas fraction becomes larger so that the index n of the Schmidt Law (with either the
molecular or the total gas) will be larger than 1. The enhancement in the dense gas fraction in
starbursts with respect to normal galaxies has still to find a physical cause, probably linked to the
much higher densities and short timescales that they experience (as mentioned in >Sect. 2.4).
Adding the dependence on the dynamical timescale allow starbursts and normal galaxies to
follow a similar relationship, even at high redshift (Genzel et al. 2010; Daddi et al. 2010).
4.3 Observed Thresholds
As seen in >Sect. 2.2, various theories for star formation predict the existence of a threshold,
or a critical surface density of gas Σcrit below which star formation should not proceed. This
motivated several empirical studies, such as the early one of Kennicutt (1989) who observed
thresholds in the range 1–10 M⊙pc−. Other works suggesting the existence of a sharp thresh-
old followed (Kennicutt 1998b; Martin and Kennicutt 2001), mostly based on Hα azimuthal
profiles. A number of more recent works based on another star formation tracer (namely, the
UV emission) challenged this view, as star formation (UV emission) was found at very large
radius in many nearby galaxies. Boissier et al. (2007) showed that most of the UV azimuthal
profiles were extending quite smoothly beyond the optical radius, where it was thought previ-
ously that star formation was indeed present but only rare and stochastic (e.g., Ferguson et al.
1998). This UV emission at low density was a very generic finding since the GALEX satellite
revealed the existence of so-called XUV (eXtended UV) galaxies (Gil de Paz et al. 2005; Thilker
et al. 2005). It was realized little after their discovery that this phenomenon concerns a large
fraction of disk galaxies (about 30% according to Thilker et al. 2007a).
Measuring the Hα emission at large radii is quite challenging. Goddard et al. (2010) pro-
posed a new analysis of existing Hα and FUV images for 21 galaxies, computing Hα profiles
with an enhanced method (addition of detected object fluxed in radial bins) with respect to
simple azimuthal averages. This allowed them to make a detailed comparison of FUV and Hα
profiles. They classified their objects into “normal” disks (for which a break is observed in both
UV and Hα close to the optical radius) representing 50% of their sample. Note however that a
break (change of slope) is observed rather than a very sharp truncation (threshold). The other
half of their sample consist in UV extended galaxies. Of these, they claimed that 6 out of 10
galaxies are also extended in Hα, and only 4 out of 10 galaxies have a UV smooth profile and a
sharp truncation in Hα.
On a local basis (by opposition to the azimuthal profiles discussed above), the recent work
by Bigiel et al. (2008) suggests that there is a (local) critical density for HI, above which the gas
is mostly molecular. In other words, there is a saturation of ΣHI around 10 M⊙pc−(what had
been previously suggested, e.g., Blitz and Rosolowsky 2006). However, the analysis of Leroy et al.
(2008) cannot ascribe clearly this “critical density” to any of the threshold theories they tested
(Toomre and other). In fact, the saturation corresponds to a phase transition from HI to H2:
it does not mean that there should be an absolute threshold for star formation in the total gas
density. Although the saturation density seems to favor a Schaye (2004) critical density, Leroy
et al. (2008) argue that according to this assumption, the full disk should be supercritical. While
it allows to predict an edge for the disk, it does not predict locally within a galaxy the regions
forming stars or not.

176 3
Star Formation in Galaxies
In conclusion, the idea of a threshold radius beyond which star formation is totally
suppressed (and even of a critical density) seems to be of little predictive power to decide where
star formation proceeds or not. If there is indeed a gravitational instability threshold corre-
sponding to the full disk being instable and prone to form stars, then beyond the corresponding
radius, star formation still proceed, may be due to local enhancements of the density, an idea
followed in the simulations of Bush et al. (2008).
Elmegreen and Hunter (2006) proposed that this absence of clear threshold shows that star
formation is the results of different processes all combining to produce the observed radial
trends. In their view, the SFR saturates at a maximumpossible rate independentlyof the respon-
sible physical process. Especially in outer, low-density regions, this allows to sustain a low level
of star formation even when some of these possible processes shut down.
4.4 Relations to the Stellar Content: The Speciﬁc Star Formation
Rate
The possible influence of the stellar surface density on the SFR surface density was discussed
in >Sect. 2. Such influence has been studied empirically (e.g., Shi et al. 2011; Abramova and
Zasov 2008; Leroy et al. 2008; Dopita and Ryder 1994) but is not clearly favored with respect
to other theoretical suggestions. The fact is that a relation seems to exist between the SFR and
the stellar mass in the nearby universe (Brinchmann et al. 2004) and at high redshift (Boissier
et al. 2010, and references therein). The current interpretation is however that this relation is
not causal, but reflects the star formation history of the galaxies.
In fact, the SFR to stellar mass ratio, the specific star formation rate (SSFR), has become
an important diagnostic tool to study galaxies (e.g., Buat et al. 2008; Noeske et al. 2007; Bell
et al. 2005). The SSFR has the advantage over the SFR to be a normalized quantity, representing
the balance between the present activity of a galaxy (the SFR) and its past one (the stellar mass
accumulated up to this point). A related quantity is the birthrate parameter b, the current SFR
to past average SFR ratio (Kennicutt 1998a). Empirically, it has been directly estimated from
the equivalent width of the Hα line, and it is also related to broadband colors of galaxies. Salim
et al. (2005), for instance, provide a relationship between b and the NUV-r color. Nowadays that
stellar mass are relatively easy to estimate, the use of SSFR is more frequent than the one of b.
They are however directly related (in a closed box model of evolution with a returned fraction
R, age T, SSFR = b/((−R)T).
The SSFR (or b) is thus an extremely interesting quantity to study galaxy evolution. In the
nearby universe, there is a relation between the Hα equivalent width (related to b, see Kennicutt
1998a) and the morphological type (shown in >Fig. 3-8 with the data of James et al. 2004). This
relation is due to the differences in the average star formation histories of galaxies of different
type as illustrated by the sketch of Sandage (1986a). SSFRs were used also in the context of
radial profiles to get clues on the growth history of galactic disks (Muñoz-Mateos et al. 2007) or
at high redshift to unravel the mysteries of galaxy formation at the earliest epochs (e.g., Noeske
et al. 2007).
4.5 Star Formation History
The SSFR was presented in >Sect. 4.4. This quantity gives an important clue on the star for-
mation history of galaxies, but only in a rough sense: the present SFR versus the past averaged

one. Ideally, to decipher the evolution of galaxies, it is needed to know its star formation his-
tory (SFH), i.e. the variation of the SFR with time. In some cases, it is possible to derive it from
observations.
An indirect method consist in comparing the predictions of models assuming SFH (e.g.,
exponentially declining star formation rates or more complex histories) with observational sets.
This can be the case for instance of chemical evolution models that are constrained by, e.g.,
age-metallicity, gas fractions, and metallicity distributions, Spectral synthesis models can be
constrained by observed spectra, spectral energy distributions, or simply colors. These indirect
methods are not discussedin details here. In the remaining, more direct methods are presented.
In the Milky Way, it is possible to determine the ages of large number of stars. By measuring
how many stars are found within bins of ages, it is possible to reconstruct the SFH. One still
has to be careful about which component is considered (see, e.g., Wyse 2009): in the thin disk,
it is in general assumed (on the basis of observations and chemical evolution models) that the
SFR in the solar neighborhood has been oscillating around a more or less constant value, but
it should have declined between its early existence and the current epoch if the whole disk
is considered. The thick disk and the halo should have different histories according to their
formation scenario. Rocha-Pinto et al. (2000) used 552 late-type dwarfs chromospheric ages

178 3
Star Formation in Galaxies
to derive a SFH consisting in a series of small amplitude bursts in their 0.4 Gyr bins. Fuchs et al.
(2009) used a sample of M-Dwarfs to derive an increase of the Milky Way SFR when going
backward in time and compared it to several previous determinations.
Another method consists in the analysis of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Combin-
ing the observed position of stars in CMDs with stellar evolution models, it is possible to
recover the star formation history of galaxies. This approach has been used in the Milky Way
(Hernandez et al. 2000; Cignoni et al. 2006). Especially with the observations of the Hubble
Space Telescope, it became possible to resolve stars in many galaxies and apply this method
to determine their SFHs. It was found that the local group dwarfs present a large variety in
their SFH, with extended episodes of activity separated by short quiescent phases (see, e.g., Tol-
stoy et al. 2009, and references therein). Harris and Zaritsky (2009) used CMDs in the large
magellanic cloud to recover its global SFH, as well as the SFH of various regions within the
galaxy.
Of course, comparing the “instantaneous” SFR of galaxies observed at various redshift is
another way to derive the history of galaxies (provided it can be assumed that the galaxies
observed at various redshifts probe the same population). Nowadays, deep surveys have allowed
tomeasure SFRs in manysamples uptorelativelylarge redshifts. Interestingly, a SFR-stellarmass
relationship seems to exist (with considerable scatter nevertheless) at all redshifts (see, e.g., the
compilation in Boissier et al. 2010), providing an important clue on the history of galaxies (more
work is howeverneeded to definitively establish its reallity). In a few studies, SFR measurements
have been combined with determinations of the molecular gas content of high-redshift galaxies,
what allowed to test the validity of the Schmidt Laws described in >Sect. 4.2.4 in the young
universe (Bouché et al. 2007; Daddi et al. 2010; Genzel et al. 2010). It was found that a universal
Schmidt Law seems to be valid, independently of redshift up to at least z ∼2.5, including both
normal and starburst galaxies. The later ones, however, may require a star formation efficiency
larger by a factor 4 at high redshift than for z ∼. It should be kept in mind that uncertainties
stay extremely large (for instance, on the H2-CO conversion factor at high redshift) and the
number of studies small.
Finally, it is possible to study the evolution with redshift of the “cosmic” SFR, i.e., the SFR
per unit volume averaged over very large scales, to obtain a SFR representative of the whole
population of galaxies. The famous “Madau plot” shows such a cosmic SFR density as a func-
tion of redshift (Madau et al. 1996). Since then, many works have attempted to add points to the
diagram and to interpret it. A compilation of measurements of the cosmic SFR density can be
found in Hopkins and Beacom (2006), but new observations are added every year from various
sources (e.g., galaxies deep surveys, gamma ray bursts). This “cosmic SFR” is to be related to all
the other “cosmic” variables that can be obtained trough observations. Wilkins et al. (2008b)
compiled measurements of the cosmic stellar mass density as a function of redshift and studied
the coherence of the cosmic SFR and stellar mass densities. A related subject is the amount of
metals formed by all the generation of stars: an evolution of the “cosmic metallicity” should be
found. Metallicity of high-redshift galaxies are measured in QSO or GRB absorbing systems, but
are often difficult to relate to the average metallicity on very large scales. Savaglio et al. (2009)
show the evolution with reshift of abundances observed in large column density absorbers (for
which precise measurements are achievable), but it is unsure that they are representative of
the whole population of galaxies. At lower densities, it is possible to place limits on the cos-
mic metallicity from ionic abundances (e.g., Songaila 2001). Finally, it is possible to link the
density of heavy element to the background radiation emitted by the stars responsible for their
formation (e.g., Longair 1995, and references therein).

In fact, the cosmic SFR density (and then the related cosmic stellar mass density and cosmic
metallicity) is not linked solely to the actual transformation of gas into stars. It is modulated by
the SFR distribution and influenced by the whole range of physical processes affecting galaxy
evolution (accretion, interactions, feedback, etc.), discussed in more details in the dedicated
chapter.

The Cool ISM in Galaxies
Abstract:
This chapter describes the different constituents of the observable interstellar
medium (ISM) in galaxies and reviews the relationships between the ISM and the star forma-
tion in galaxies. The emphasis is on the component which is most widespread and most easily
observable, the neutral atomichydrogen (H I). It brieflytouches upon effects ofthe environment
and of the interplay between star formation and the ISM (feedback).
1
Introduction
The best census of the different components of the interstellar medium (ISM) exists for the
Milky Way, the result of close to half a century of observational and theoretical studies. Much
of this is well described in various chapters of the Handbook ( > Chap. 10 of Volume 5).
The ISM components range from various forms of the most abundant specious, neutral hydro-
gen (H I), ionized hydrogen (H II), and molecular hydrogen (H), and a large variety of complex
molecules and dust grains, to the more energetic components of the cosmic ray population. In
this chapter, we restrict ourselves to the neutral hydrogen component of the ISM in galaxies and
only briefly address some of the other components such as the ionized and molecular hydrogen,
and the dust.
The ISM plays a crucial role in the process of star formation throughout a galaxy’s lifetime.
How efficiently star formation proceeds depends on the local properties of the ISM. These are
in turn affected by the star formation which provides feedback via stellar winds and supernova
explosions. This feedback is an important regulating mechanism for the ongoing process of
the buildup of galaxies throughout cosmic time. Detailed imaging of the ISM, in particular in
H I is now available for many objects in the nearby universe. This chapter will therefore briefly
review the current ideas and observational evidence for the physical connection between the
local properties of the ISM and the star formation.
Although such constituents of the ISM as dust and ionized gas have long been known in
the Galaxy, it was not until the detection of the first 21-cm line emission of H I (Ewen and
Purcell 1951; Muller and Oort 1951; Pawsey 1951), following the prediction by van de Hulst
(1945), opened a full perspective on the structure, kinematics, and physics of the H I in the
Galaxy (see
>Chap. 11 of Volume 5). The first pioneering observations of H I in other galaxies
(Raimond and Volders 1957; Volders 1959; Volders and Högbom 1961) were the beginning of
several decades of galaxy surveys in the H I line using single-dish radio telescopes of increasing
diameter. This led to insight into the global properties of H I in galaxies, well summarized in
Roberts and Haynes (1994) following the much earlier reviews of Roberts (1963, 1975).
The advent of earth-rotation synthesis radio telescopes drastically changed the field, as it
became possible to image the H I in galaxies with angular resolutions of a few arcminutes origi-
nally (Baldwin et al. 1971; Rogstad and Shostak 1971; Wright et al. 1972) with quality improving
over the years to ∼′′ (Walter et al. 2008). By 2012 some 500 galaxies have been imaged in the
H I line, some individually, some as part of large observing programs such as WHISP (van der
Hulst et al. 2001; García-Ruiz et al. 2002; Swaters et al. 2002; Noordermeer et al. 2005) and
THINGS (Walter et al. 2008). Although a main focus of the earlier work was on using the H I
kinematics to determinethe mass distributions of galaxies, in particular the dark mattercontent
(Sanders 2010), this chapter will primarily discuss the distribution of the H I in relation to other
components of the ISM, and in particular in relation to the star formation in galaxies, using the
latest results from surveys such as WHISP and THINGS in H I, and BIMA-SONG (Helfer et al.
2003) and HERACLES (Leroy et al. 2008, 2009) in CO.

This chapter will not repeat the information of many previous reviews, nor will it review
recent low-resolution surveys of H I in galaxies such as HIPASS (Meyer et al. 2004; Zwaan et al.
2004; Koribalski et al. 2004) or ALFALFA (Giovanelli et al. 2005; Toribio et al. 2011). It will
concentrate instead on the resolved distribution of the ISM as traced by the H I, as there now is
a wealth of information from high-resolution H I imaging of a few hundred galaxies. Further-
more, it will discuss the relation of the H I and other ISM components to the star formation
in galaxies and touch upon the role of the star formation and the environment in shaping the
distribution of the H I. This chapter provides an overview of the current knowledge of the cool
ISM and its relation to star formation in galaxies, but does not pretend to be complete.

The Neutral Hydrogen (H I) in Galaxies
This section first provides a brief discussion of the relevant physics of the H I and associated
observables, followed by an overview of the detailed distribution of H I in galaxies, and a brief
description of the warm and cold components of the ISM.
2.1 The H I Physics and Observables
The basic physics of the H I atom is well described in
>Chap. 11 of Volume 5 and in Walter-
bos and Braun (1996). A full treatment of the level population of the hydrogen atom is given in
Field (1959). In the ISM, collisions dominate the excitation of the fine-structure 21-cm H I line.
Resolved observations of H I in galaxies provide a set of images of the H I at a series of frequen-
cies (i.e., Doppler velocities) determined by the spectral resolution and observing frequency
used. Each image basically provides the brightness distribution of the H I line at a particular
Doppler velocity. For each line of sight then an H I profile can be constructed which can be inte-
grated over all velocities to determine a column density. The realization that the H I in galaxy
disks is predominantly optically thin allows us to determine H I column densities directly from
the measured brightness temperatures of the H I emission using the following equation:
NH I
cm−= .× ∫
TB(v)
K kms−dv,
(4.1)
where the brightness temperature TB(v) is related to the flux per beam (S(v), the usual units
used in synthesis maps) and the beam area (ΩB) via
TB(v) = (λ/.cm)
S(v) (mJy)
ΩB (sq.arcsec)
(4.2)
The column density basically is the integral over velocity of all emission along a given line of
sight within one resolution element. Commonly, it is determined by calculating the 0th moment
ofthe measured HI profiles. Higherordermoments can alsobe calculated and are a measure ofa
characteristic radial velocity (1st moment)and velocity dispersion (2nd moment). These higher
order moments are not necessarily the best measures of velocity and velocity dispersion. Better
results are obtained by fitting profiles with a single or multiple Gaussians or Gauss-Hermite
polynomials (Noordermeer et al. 2005; Swaters et al. 2002).
In addition to determining observational parameters of each line of sight, one can also
integrate the H I signal spatially to determine the total flux in each channel for a given object

186 4
The Cool ISM in Galaxies
(e.g., an entire galaxy, a companion feature, or a feature within a galaxy disk). These fluxes can be
integrated over velocity to determine the total mass, which is related to the total flux integral as
MH I
M⊙
= ( D
Mpc)

∫
S(v)
mJy
dv
kms−
(4.3)
When calculating detection limits based on the rms noise of the observation, one has to assume
a profile velocity width as both NH I and MH I are integrated over velocity. This has led to a
range of limit definitions in the literature as some authors integrate over the velocity resolution
while others use (different) estimatesof the expected profile width for the objects under study. It
would be better to introduce uniformity and quote limits in NH I/Δv and MH I/Δv rather than
NH I and MH I to avoid this practical problem.
For H I absorption, the situation is more complex as H I absorption measurementsbasically
probe optical depth:
τ(v) = .× −NH I
Ts
P(v)
(4.4)
with a Maxwellian velocity distribution P(v) given by
P(v) =

√π.b e(−v/b)
(4.5)
with
b =
√
kTk
mH I
,
(4.6)
where τ(v) is the optical depth and Ts and Tk are the spin temperature and the kinetic
temperature of the H I, respectively. Because the optical depth depends on both the column
density (NH I) and the spin temperature, it is not possible to interpret absorption line mea-
surements unambiguously. This is a major limitation which can only be resolved if one has
an independent measurement of HI emission along the same line of sight. For small opti-
cal depths, the absorption and emission observations can be combined to solve for NH I
and Ts independently. Such observations do not generally exist, however, so an assumption
about the spin temperature is required to estimate column densities from absorption line
measurements.
An example ofthe H I distribution ofa spiral galaxyis given in >Fig. 4-1. It shows NGC 5055
in H I, visible light, and UV (GALEX). The HI reveals a wealth of structure, not only in the inner
part of the galaxy, coincident with the bright optical disk, but also in the outer parts where faint
light is present and structures in UV light indicate the presence of star formation. This HI obser-
vation is ratherdeep. Most H I synthesis observations in the literature donot probe much deeper
than column densities of NH I ∼cm−for the typical sensitivities and angular resolutions
used. Synthesis observations offer the flexibility of improving the column density sensitivity by
changing the weights of the u, v data. Giving lower weight to the longer baselines lowers the
resolution (increases ΩB) and enhances the surface brightness sensitivity and hence column
density sensitivity. This is illustrated further in > Fig. 4-2 which shows the H I distributions
of NGC 6946 at two resolutions: ′′ and ′′. It is clear that the ′′ image brings out fainter
features at the expense of resolution, especially in the outer parts. Most notable is the faint tail
in the northwest which is interpreted as the remnant of an infalling gas complex (Boomsma
et al. 2008). These images result from long integrations at the Very Large Array (VLA) and
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT).

2.2 The Distribution of H I in Galaxies
Observations of H I in other galaxies have clearly confirmed the picture that emerged from
studies of the Milky Way: most of the H I is in a thin (∼few hundred pc scale height), rotat-
ing disk, typically more extended radially than the observable distribution of star light. This
disk may flare and warp in the outer parts as does the H I disk of the Milky Way (Levine et al.
2006; Kerr 1969, and references therein). In addition, evidence is mounting for the presence
of extraplanar H I: either gas thrown out of the disk by star formation activity (the “Galactic
Fountain,” Bregman 1980), or gas accreted from satellitegalaxies (such as the MagellanicStream
around the Milky Way, Putman et al. 2003) or from the cosmic web (Sancisi et al. 2008). Edge-
on galaxies provide the best view of both the thin H I disk and such extraplanar H I. Prominent,
well-studied examples are NGC 891 and NGC 4565 (Oosterloo et al. 2007a; Rupen 1991). In
NGC 891, observations of increasing depth provided the first evidence for extraplanar H I. Part
of this H I is in a more slowly rotating, thick disk reaching scale heights of a few kpc; another
part consists of more patchy filaments, reaching heights of 10 kpc above the plane, and is kine-
matically less well behaved. These components are illustrated in >Fig. 4-3 and will be discussed
in more detail later.
The overall radial surface density (i.e., deprojected column density) distribution of H I in
the disks of spiral galaxies is rather flat within the optical disk, with an approximately exponen-
tial decline in the outer parts (Swaters et al. 2002; Bigiel et al. 2008). Early-type spiral galaxies
tend to have a deficiency of H I surface density in the inner parts, often compensated by the
presence of large amounts of H(Noordermeer et al. 2005). Typical average surface densities

image superposed on the optical image of the galaxy. At this resolution and sensitivity, the thick,
lopsided H I distribution is very clear. The right panel shows only the H I that is not corotating with
the disk. This anomalous-velocity gas is everywhere, but most prominent and extended in the
northwest. Its H I mass is ∼108 M⊙, a few percent of the total H I mass of the galaxy

the H I disk of the Milky Way is displayed on the same scale in the center of the ﬁgure
in the disk are a few M⊙pc−in the inner parts, with local maxima of over 10 M⊙pc−.
Blitz and Rosolowsky (2006) investigated the effect of pressure in the ISM and suggested that
above 10 M⊙pc−most of the hydrogen turns into molecular form. This is actually confirmed
by observations (Bigiel et al. 2008).
H I disks exhibit a wealth of structure. This is very obvious in a bird’s-eye view of 34 different
galaxies from the THINGSsurvey(>Fig. 4-4). In the innerparts, theyexhibit the same structure
as seen optically, traced bythe recent starformation (spiral arms, spiral arm segments, filaments,
etc.). The outer H I disks also exhibit structure, often with spiral arm-like features similar to the
inner parts. Also in the outer disk, the brightest H I structures coincide often with locations of
star formation as shown by the UV emission detected by GALEX in the outer disks of galaxies
(Thilker et al. 2005, 2007). This is very clear in > Figs. 4-1 and >4-9.
When examined globally, many galaxies exhibit asymmetries, both kinematically and spa-
tially. Sancisi et al. (2008) examined some 300 galaxies in the WHISP sample and concluded
that half of the objects are asymmetric. A more quantitative analysis by van Eymeren et al.
(2011a, b) shows that more than 60% of the WHISP galaxies show kinematic and/or morpho-
logical asymmetries. The latter studies show that kinematic lopsidedness is more common than
the occurrence of morphological asymmetries. The cause for asymmetries is not well estab-
lished. Sancisi et al. (2008) suggest that accretion or minor mergers are the main cause. This
could be fallback of material in tidally interacting systems, though not in every case as not all

The Cool ISM in Galaxies
lopsided galaxies are interacting systems. van Eymeren et al. (2011b) investigate the dependence
of the degree of lopsidedness on the environment and confirm that there is no clear effect. So if
tidal interactions are the only way to induce lopsidedness, it needs to be long-lived.
In addition to global asymmetries, a large fraction of H I disks of galaxies appear warped
(García-Ruiz et al. 2002; Sancisi et al. 2008). Warped H I disks are best studied in edge-on galax-
ies but can also be found and quantified through their signature in the H I velocity fields as
described by Briggs (1990) and more recently by Józsa (2007) and Józsa et al. (2007). The warps
usually start at the edge of the optical disk (García-Ruiz et al. 2002). As with the asymmetries
in general, warps need to be long-lived if tidal interactions are the only cause, suggesting other
mechanisms such as accretion and minor mergers (Sancisi et al. 2008). The warped H I layer
of the Milky Way increases in thickness toward the outer parts (Levine et al. 2006; Kalberla
and Kerp 2009). This thickening has not been established as well for other galaxies. Some well-
studied edge-on galaxies have been shown to exhibit flaring H I layers (Sancisi and Allen 1979;
Olling 1996; O’Brien et al. 2010), indicating that flaring H I disks may be very common. Further
investigations combining accurate measurement of both the velocity dispersion of the gas and
the thickness of the H I layer are required to confirm this trend for a larger number of galaxies.
For a more detailed overview of the methods and results see Kregel and van der Kruit (2005 and
references therein), O’Brien et al. (2010), and the review by van der Kruit and Freeman (2011).
There is an indication that low-luminosity dwarf galaxies have thicker H I disks than normally
found in spiral galaxies (Roychowdhury et al. 2009, 2010).
Detailed studies at increasing sensitivity and resolution of the nearby edge-on galaxy
NGC 891 (Sancisi and Allen 1979; Swaters et al. 1997; Oosterloo et al. 2007a) have shown that
there exist a thick HI disk and an HI halo. They are corotating with the disk, though the rotation
slows down with increasing height above the plane. This decrease is too large (20–40 km s−)
to be explained by asymmetric drift. The existence of a thick disk/halo can also be detected in
moderatelyinclined galaxies as it becomes manifest by its slower rotation as gas at lower veloci-
ties in position-velocity diagrams (termed the “beard” by Schaap et al. 2000, who first identified
and studied this component in NGC 2403). Fraternali et al. (2001, 2002) made a detailed study
of this phenomenon in NGC 2403 using more sensitive HI data. >Figure 4-5 shows this “beard”
in NGC 2403. Modeling showed that also in this galaxy the thick disk is rotating more slowly
by a few tens of km s−as is the case for NGC 891.
The indication for the possible existence of an extended gaseous halo around galaxies orig-
inally came from the detection of galactic absorption lines in the direction of bright stars in the
Magellanic Clouds that could be ascribed to hot gas in a galactic “corona” (Savage and de Boer
1979). This component, often termed the warm ionized medium (WIM) or the diffuse ionized
gas (DIG), has also been shown to be present in the disks and halos of other galaxies (Dettmar
1990; Rand et al. 1990). This thick WIM component in galaxies is thought to be fed by stel-
lar winds and supernova explosions, though the number of “chimney”-like structures expected
based on models such as those of Norman and Ikeuchi (1989) has not yet been confirmed by Hα
imaging of edge-on galaxies. This phenomenon is also supposed to drive the outflow of neutral
gas and be at the root of the “Galactic Fountain” mechanism (Bregman 1980; Kahn 1994; Rosen
and Bregman 1995) in the disk-halo interface.
A related phenomenon discovered along with the thick H I disk and H I halo is the presence
of gas complexes outside the thin H I disk. These were noted as either gas moving at velocities
different from the general rotation in face-on galaxies (M 101: van der Hulst and Sancisi 1988;
NGC 6946: Kamphuis and Sancisi 1993; Boomsma et al. 2008) or as features above the disk in
edge-on galaxies (NGC 891: Oosterloo et al. 2007a). This anomalous-velocity gas appears to be

a mix of gas removed from the disk by a “Galactic Fountain” mechanism, related to massive star
formation processes in the disk, and steady accretion of intergalactic gas or tidal debris, much
like the mechanisms proposed for the presence of the high velocity clouds and the Magellanic
Stream around the MilkyWay(formore details see the review bySancisi et al. 2008). The amount
of H I in these features typically is of the order of ∼M⊙or less than 10% of the total amount
of H I in a typical disk galaxy.
The discovery of these features required long integrations (∼100 h on current synthesis tele-
scopes) and they have thus far been found only in a small number of galaxies. Large surveys
of galaxies such as WHISP (van der Hulst et al. 2001) and THINGS (Walter et al. 2008) do not
reach the required H I column density sensitivity well below cm−. A recent deep survey
of ∼20 galaxies (HALOGAS, Heald et al. 2011) is expected to provide more insight in these
phenomena.
Detailed studies of H I in galaxies have been expanded to early-type galaxies (ETGs, usually
S0s and ellipticals), systems which have less copious amounts of H I relative to their stellar or
total mass. The picture that emerges here (Oosterloo et al. 2007b, c, 2010a; Serra et al. 2012)
is that roughly half of the ETGs in the field are detected in H I with detection limits of a few
times M⊙. About half of these exhibit large, regularly rotating H I disks or rings, while many
objects show the presence of tails and outlying H I structures reminiscent of tidal effects and
accretion.
In dense environments such as the Virgo cluster, the H I properties of galaxies change dras-
tically as a result of tidal interactions and interaction with the intracluster medium (e.g., see
Chung et al. 2009; Solanes et al. 2001). In Virgo, only 10% of the ETGs are detected (Serra
et al. 2012), while the spiral galaxies show truncated H I disks and clear signs of stripping and
interactions (Chung et al. 2009). These effects will be discussed in more detail in >Sect. 4.

192 4
The Cool ISM in Galaxies
At the other extreme, there are the low-luminosity and low-surface-brightness galaxies in
the field. Some 65 small, low-luminosity (MB > −) dwarf irregular galaxies have been stud-
ied recently with the GMRT (the Faint Irregular Galaxies GMRT Survey (FIGGS), Begum
et al. 2005, 2008) and confirm existing trends in that the H I to optical sizes of galaxies
increases toward lower optical luminosities (implying also an increase in MHI/LB with decreas-
ing luminosity). These low-luminosity systems continue to obey the MHI/DHI relation first
demonstrated by Broeils and Rhee (1997), indicating that the average H I surface densities are
similar to those in the H I disks of more luminous galaxies. Complementary surveys, carried
out with the VLA and focusing on studies of the H I in nearby, low-mass star-forming galaxies,
are LITTLE-THINGS (Hunter et al. 2011) and VLA/ANGST (Ott et al. 2008).
The classical low-surface-brightness galaxies (van der Hulst et al. 1993; de Blok et al. 1996)
appear to fill the gap between these very-low-luminosity systems and the galaxies of normal
surface brightness and normal luminosity in terms of their properties.
2.3 The Warm and Cold ISM in Galaxies
The presence of ionized hydrogen around OB stars, in the form of H II regions, has been known
fora long time. The idea that in addition the ISMin the Galaxymayhave a more widespread, hot,
ionized hydrogen component came from the interpretation ofthe low-frequencyturnoverofthe
spectrum of the Galactic synchrotron emission as free-free absorption (Hoyle and Ellis 1963).
Ten years later, the presence of the diffuse ionized interstellarmedium was clearly demonstrated
from the detection of ubiquitous Hα emission (Reynolds 1971; Reynolds et al. 1973). Another
20 years later, Dettmar (1990) and Rand et al. (1990) showed with deep Hα imaging of NGC891
that other galaxies also have such a warm, ionized component. A very complete and recent
review of this so-called warm ionized medium (WIM) in galaxies has been given by Haffner
et al. (2009).
The presence of dust in the ISM has been obvious for centuries: naked-eye observations of
the central Milky Way show large dark patches of obscured starlight, bearing witness to the pres-
ence of obscuring material. Similar structures are also evident from images of other galaxies,
where dust features outline the sometimes regular, sometimes chaotic spiral structure in galaxy
disks. A major leap in studying dust in galaxies has come from infrared astronomy as noted in
an early review (Stein and Soifer 1983) written at the dawn of routine mid-IR and far-IR imag-
ing. A major breakthrough came from imaging of galaxies in the far-IR by IRAS (http://irsa.
ipac.caltech.edu/IRASdocs/iras.html), and later the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO; http://
iso.esac.esa.int), SPITZER (http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu), and HERSCHEL (http://www.esa.
int/herschel). Not only detailed spectral energy distributions are now available, supporting the
models describing the overall IR spectrum as thermal emission from cold dust, but also many
spectral features resulting from complex molecules, primarily Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocar-
bons (PAHs; see
> Chap. 10 of Volume 5) providing better insight in the interpretation of
mid-IR and far-IR images of galaxies.
The tradition of observing H I and H II in galaxies is by now half a century old. The realiza-
tion that molecules in the ISM can also be imaged using radio lines came almost two decades
later with the first detection of CO in the Galaxy in 1970 (Wilson et al. 1970) and the first extra-
galactic CO detection in M 82 and NGC 253 in 1975 (Rickard et al. 1975a, b). The CO emission
indirectly traces H, as rotational transitions of the CO molecules are excited by collisions with
hydrogen molecules. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to observe the cold Hdirectly. Electronic

transitions are very faint and occur in the ultraviolet where both the Earth’s atmosphere and
interstellar extinction obstruct our view (Shull and Beckwith 1982; Habart et al. 2005). Rota-
tional transitions occur in the mid-infrared (Black and van Dishoeck 1987) at 28.2, 17.0, and
12.3 μm. Hcan also be observed at shorterwavelengths when the temperatureincreases to sev-
eral hundred K, but this only occurs around hot stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These
lines of cold molecular hydrogen are weak and require very high column densities to be observ-
able. So far, only detections of fairly warm gas have been made in the edge-on disk of NGC 891
(Valentijn and van der Werf 1999) and the nucleus of NGC 6946 (Valentijn et al. 1996).
Young and Scoville (1991) reviewed the early work on the CO and hence molecular content
of galaxies, mostly carried out with single-dish radio telescopes. The first detailed images came
with the advent of mm arrays and eventually large observing programs such as BIMA-SONG
(Regan et al. 2001; Helfer et al. 2003) and HERACLES (Leroy et al. 2008, 2009).
A major uncertainty remains the conversion from CO brightness to Hcolumn density. The
general relation is expressed as
NH
cm−= XCO ∫
ICO(v)
K kms−dv
(4.7)
The commonly adopted value for XCO is the value determined for Galactic molecular clouds,
XCO = × cm−(K km s−)−. This conversion factor has, however, been demonstrated to
depend on metallicity and can be uncertain by an order of magnitude (Wilson 1995; Israel 1997;
Leroy et al. 2011a; see also Shetty et al. 2011a, b; Liszt et al. 2010 for a theoretical treatment of
the XCO conversion factor for both dense and diffuse molecular gas).
3
Star Formation and the ISM
The transformation of gas into stars is one of the most important processes in galaxy evolution.
Understanding the conditions that determine the efficiency of this process, and the associated
physics, is the goal of many observational and theoretical studies. They also form important
input into numerical computer models of galaxy formation and evolution. A complete under-
standing requires knowledge of these processes over a large range in scales: from galaxy-sized
scales where gas is transported from the disk of the galaxy into the halo and back (which is
also the scale where accretion and capture of satellites takes place) to kpc-sized scales where gas
clouds are coalescing, via sub-kpc scales where neutral gas cools and forms molecular gas in
GMCs, to parsec scales where individual stars are formed.
These very small scales can be directly observed in our Galaxy, while the processes happen-
ing at galaxy scales can in principle be studied in external galaxies. Tying together the processes
happening at these two extreme scales has been a major challenge in this particular field: in our
Galaxy, we lack the overview we have for other galaxies, while we rarely have the resolution to
study the detailed processes leading to star formation in external galaxies.
This led to many studies exploring empirical relations between the properties (usually
surface or volume density) of the gas component and some kind of tracer of the recent star
formation. In the last couple of years, significant progress has been made with the advent
of high-resolution multiwavelength surveys of the gas and star formation components. These
surveys are now starting to bridge the gap between the observations at the scales of stars and
those at scales of galaxies.

The Cool ISM in Galaxies
Schmidt (1959) was the first to relate the gas density in our Galaxy to the star formation rate
(SFR) using a relation ρSFR ∼ρn
gas. He found a value n ≃. Schmidt’s relation between volume
densities can be translated into a relation involving surface densities ΣSFR ∼ΣN
gas. Surface den-
sities are more easily quantifiable in external galaxies, and the exponents n and N are related as
long as the scale height of the disk is constant. This kind of relation has become known as the
“Schmidt Law,” and the name is commonly used for any sort of relation that describes the link
between a gas component (neutral, molecular, or global) and a star formation tracer (young
stars, ionized gas emission, infrared emission).
The first investigations of the Schmidt Law in external galaxies were done by Sanduleak
(1969) and Hartwick (1971), who looked at young stars and star-forming regions in the SMC
and M31. Madore et al. (1974), Newton (1980), Tosa and Hamajima (1975), and Hamajima and
Tosa (1975) followed up on this by studying the relation between young stars and HI surface
density in nearby galaxies such as M31, the LMC, M101 and others. These studies found N ≃
but with a large spread of a few tens of percent.
In a landmark paper, Kennicutt (1989) (see also Kennicutt 1998) studied the averaged gas
and Hα content of 61 nearby spirals and 36 starburst galaxies. He derived a Schmidt Law
between the total gas surface density Σgas = ΣHI + ΣHand the Hα-derived SFR with values
of N = .± .for spirals and N = .± .for all galaxies (spirals and starbursts) in his
sample. As a result of this work, the relation between gas surface density and star formation is
often referred to as the “Kennicutt-Schmidt Law.” >Figure 4-6 shows this result as presented in
the Kennicutt (1989) paper.
Similar studies, using different measures for the gas surface density, and different star for-
mation tracers (such as ultraviolet or infrared emission) found similar values, but again with a
large spread. This may reflect actual variations in the physics, but a large part of this spread is
very likely also due to choice of sample, analysis, and star formation tracers. For a description
of these studies, see the review by Kennicutt (1998).
Kennicutt (1989, 1998) and Martin and Kennicutt (2001) also found evidence for a star for-
mation threshold. That is, the star formation efficiency (as traced by Hα) decreases dramatically
once the gas surface density drops below a certain threshold, but star formation does not shut
off completely (e.g., Ferguson et al. 1998). Kennicutt (1989) relates this star formation threshold
density to the Toomre Q parameter and the stability of the disk.
A similar cutoff behavior in the star formation efficiency had also been observed by
Skillman (1987), who noted that star formation (again, as traced by Hα) did not seem to occur
below a (constant) H I surface density threshold of ∼⋅cm−. The star formation threshold
was also suggested by van der Hulst et al. (1993) as an explanation for the low star formation
rates observed in low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. These galaxies generally have lower H I
surface densities than “normal” galaxies (de Blok et al. 1996). Though this is not the place to
review the large body of theoretical and numerical work on the relation between gas (surface)
density and star formation rate, we note the work by Schaye (2004) and Taylor and Webster
(2005) who suggest that the star formation threshold is related to the formation of a cold phase
in the neutral ISM when a sufficiently high surface density is reached. This cold phase makes
efficient cooling suddenly possible, leading to star formation.
Over the last decade, the amount of high-resolution, multiwavelength information about
galaxies in the nearby universe has increased dramatically. This had made possible new studies
of the conditions for star formation on kpc or even sub-kpc scales in a significant number of
galaxies. Here we summarize some of the main results derived and refer to these papers for
further references.

(Adopted from Kennicutt 1989)
Bigiel et al. (2008) investigated relations of the star formation rate surface density ΣSFR with
the HI surface density ΣHI, the molecular surface density ΣHand the combined gas surface
density Σgas on scales of 750 pc in a number of nearby disk and dwarf galaxies. The star-
formation rate maps were based on a combination of GALEX FUV maps and Spitzer 24 μm
maps from respectively the GALEX NGS (Gil de Paz et al. 2007) and the Spitzer Infrared Nearby
Galaxies Survey (SINGS; Kennicutt et al. 2003). For the gas surface densities, information was
used from THINGS (Walter et al. 2008) for the neutral part of the ISM, and HERACLES (Leroy
et al. 2009) and BIMA-SONG (Helfer et al. 2003) for the molecular part (as traced by the CO
line). > Figure 4-7 shows three galaxies with such detailed information: the distribution of
molecular hydrogen, atomic hydrogen, the kinematics of the atomic hydrogen, the distribu-
tion of near-IR light (predominantly old stars), and a composite of UV light, mid-IR light, and
Hα emission (tracing star formation).
It was found that, at least in the star-forming disks of the sample galaxies, a strong relation
exists between ΣHand ΣSFR, with a power-law exponent N = .±., i.e., a linear relation. This
can be interpreted as stars forming from the molecular ISM at a constant efficiency. This agrees
with a result from Kennicutt (1989) who had found a similar relation for starburst galaxies,

formation
where the Hsurface densities are much higher. This is illustrated in >Fig. 4-8 (adopted from
Fig. 10 of Schruba et al. 2011), which shows two different measures of the star formation surface
density versus the gas surface density. The power-law regime applies to gas surface densities
above 10 M⊙pc−.
Note, though, that the Bigiel et al. (2008) result does not say anything about the neces-
sary conditions for star formation inside GMCs. At the working resolution of 750 pc, GMCs
are not resolved, and the linear relation found must therefore be interpreted within the con-
text of “counting clouds,” i.e., they can be explained by assuming that the GMCs have uniform
properties with the observed CO surface density determined by the beam filling factor of these
clouds.
Bigiel et al. (2008) found less well-defined relations between Σgas or ΣHI on the one hand
and ΣSFR on the other hand. The relation between Σgas and ΣSFR was found to vary from galaxy
to galaxy, and there is almost no relation with ΣHI. These results were revisited by Schruba et al.
(2011) who used stacking of the HERACLES CO data (using HI radial velocities as a prior) to
push the CO detections to larger radii. In these outer parts, the gas content is dominated by
the neutral HI rather than the molecular H. In this lower gas surface density regime, the star
formation law changes its linear behavior. This is clear in >Fig. 4-8.

+ H2). Each point represents a radial average in a given galaxy. Regions that are H2 dominated are
plotted with dark blue symbols, regions that are H I dominated in light red symbols. Whereas SFR is
not correlated with H I (in the inner parts of galaxy disks), it correlates with H2 and total gas surface
density. The scaling exhibits a change in slope at the transition between H I- and H2-dominated
environments (This ﬁgure is adopted from Fig. 11 in Schruba et al. 2011)
Schruba et al. (2011) found that the linear relation between ΣHand ΣSFR extends into this
HI-dominated regime. One interpretation of these results is that the Kennicutt-Schmidt Law
can be separated into two separate processes. The first one is star formation proceeding with a
constant efficiencyonce His formed. The “bottleneck” determining the starformation rate thus
seems to be the second process of conversion from HI into H(likely through the formation
of a cold neutral component as discussed earlier). The star-formation threshold as found by
Kennicutt (1989) therefore seems to be caused by a change in SFR due to a changing ratio of HI
to H(as a function of total gas density) rather than an actual shutting off of star formation.
This is supported by the realization that star formation in the outer parts of disks is more
widespread than originally thought. The early observations of Ferguson et al. (1998) showed
isolated star-forming regions (as traced by Hα) well beyond the optical disks of a number of
nearby galaxies. The discovery of further star formation using GALEX observations in the UV
showed that these early observations were showing only the tip of the iceberg (Thilker et al.
2005). The UV observations enabled direct detection of O and B stars which would otherwise
have escaped detection due to their inability to excite the surrounding ISM enough to pro-
duce Hα emission. It is now thought that these so-called extended UV (XUV) disks are found
in ∼30% of nearby disk galaxies (Thilker et al. 2007). A striking example is M 83 (NGC 5236)
shown in >Fig. 4-9: the outlying H I structures show up remarkably well in the UV, indicating
that star formation is progressing there as well, albeit with a lower efficiency (Bigiel et al. 2010b)
than in the bright, inner region of the galaxy. A comparison of star formation as traced by Hα
with star formation as traced by UV radiation from O and B stars shows that while the level of
Hα emission typically drops very steeply at the edge of the optical disk (giving the appearance
of a star formation threshold), such an edge is not observed in the UV emission. Rather, the

mation structures the single UV composite image is shown as well (rightpanel). Note the extended
structures, (arms, arcs, ﬁlaments) in the outer disk, visible in both the H I and the UV images, indi-
cating that even in the faint outer H I star formation is progressing (Courtesy Dave Thilker and
NASA/JPL-Caltech/VLA/MPIA)
density of young stars gradually decreases, again supporting the idea that the changing ratio of
HI to Hultimately determines the overall star formation efficiency.
The above broad-brush picture illustrates the progress made in the last few years, and these
results can now be used as input for numerical models that can help explain variations of star
formation efficiency with, e.g., redshift, environment, or galaxy mass.
It is, however, still difficult to link the observations with the actual physical processes driv-
ing the star formation rate. Leroy et al. (2008) used the same data set as Bigiel et al. (2008) to test
a number of theoretical explanations proposed in the literature linking the gas density and the
SFR. They looked at the disk free-fall time, the orbital timescale, the effects of cloud-cloud colli-
sions, the assumption of fixed GMC star formation efficiency, and the relation between pressure
in the ISM and the phases of the ISM.
Similarly, they investigated several models proposed for the star formation threshold, such
as gravitational stability in a gas disk, gravitational stability in a mixed disk of gas and stars, the
effects of shear in a disk, and the onset of a cold gas phase.
Their conclusions were that none of these offers a unique explanation for the observed
behavior. While large-scale relations can be identified (such as the Kennicutt-Schmidt Law),
the actual physics remains more complicated, and still below the resolutions achieved so far.
Observationally we will also have to get a better understanding of the balance between warm
and cold HI phases, the efficiency of Hformation, and possibly the effects of shocks and turbu-
lence. Many of these have already been studied numerically or theoretically. In the next decade
or so we, should be able to obtain the observational evidence in a large number of galaxies at

sufficient resolution in order to gauge the ability of the ISM to form GMCs over a wide range
of galaxy conditions.

Accretion, Feedback and the Environment
One of the main puzzles in galaxy evolution is that the rate at which new stars have formed
in galaxies has declined dramatically over the last 7 Gyr (e.g., Madau et al. 1998; Hopkins and
Beacom 2006), in contrast to the lack of a similar decline in the estimatedcold gas density in the
universe (Lah et al. 2007). Observed star formation rates in galaxies are such that the observed
gas supply is exhausted in a few Gyr (e.g., Bigiel et al. 2008) and the dwindling star formation
could, in principle, be due to star formation consuming the available gas supply. Galaxies must,
therefore, continuously accrete gas from the intergalactic environment to keep the observed gas
density levels. Continuous accretion of gas from the IGM maysolve this discrepancy so that star
formation can continue over much longer periods than given by the initial gas reservoirs and
the gas consumption times.
The observational evidence for accretion has been extensively described in the review of
Sancisi et al. (2008), who examine a number of H I signatures in galaxies in the nearby universe.
Examples are small (and often subtle) asymmetries in the distribution and/or kinematics of the
H I (lopsidedness), the presence of warps, of small H I companions, faint H I tails and other
structures, and the presence of extraplanar gas (a prime example being NGC 891, Oosterloo
et al. (2007a)). >Figure 4-10 provides a few examples of galaxies with this kind of evidence for
accretion. From an inventory of such H I signatures in WHISP (van der Hulst et al. 2001; Sancisi
et al. 2008) estimate an accretion rate of ∼0.2 M⊙year−in H I. This number is very uncertain
and does not account for the accretion of warm, ionized gas.
From the theoretical point of view, there is increasing evidence that so-called cold-mode
accretion plays an important role in providing the dark matter halos with the fuel for form-
ing stars and building up the stellar mass in galaxies (Birnboim and Dekel 2003; Dekel and
Birnboim 2006; Binney 2004; Kereš et al. 2005; Cattaneo et al. 2006; Kereš et al. 2009a).
Cosmological simulations suggest that cold-mode accretion is the dominant process at redshifts
z ≥but becomes less important at lower redshifts (van de Voort et al. 2011). The cold-mode
accretion has been examined closely in the Milky Way and a few nearby galaxies (NGC 891 and
NGC 2403) by Fraternali and Binney (2008), Marinacci et al. (2010) and Binney and Frater-
nali (2012), in particular with the goal of verifying theoretically what fraction of the gas in the
halo of the Milky Way results from accretion versus gas brought into the halo by the “Galac-
tic Fountain” mechanism. Marasco and Fraternali (2011) and Marasco et al. (2012) conclude
from detailed modeling of the halo of the Milky Way that the “Galactic Fountain” induces a
steady inflow of ∼2 M⊙year−, enough to sustain the star formation in the disk and an order of
magnitude larger than the accretion rate estimated by Sancisi et al. (2008).
Accretion is not the only process relevant to the interplay between star formation and the
environment. Gas removal processes can be equally important depending on internal processes
(stellar winds, supernovae, presence of an AGN) or external, environmental conditions (density
of the intergalactic medium (IGM), local galaxy density, i.e., the probability of gravitational
interactions). Examples of such external processes are plentiful in the denser environments of
clusters and groups. The best observational evidence is found in the Virgo cluster (>Fig. 4-11),
which offered the first clear effects of gas removal by ram pressure in the hot intraclustergas and
gravitational interactions (Warmels 1988; Cayatte et al. 1994; Chung et al. 2009). These studies

Examples of eﬀects of the environment in the Virgo cluster. The right panel shows the central part
of the Virgo cluster with in red the X-ray emission from the intracluster gas and individual massive
galaxiesand in bluethe H I distributionsof the galaxiesimaged with the VLA by Chunget al. (2009).
Note that the H I disks are enlarged by a factor 10 for visible presentation. The H I disks in the core
of the Virgo cluster are clearly smaller than those of galaxies in the outer parts. To the right, two
particular examples of ram pressure stripping are enlarged: NGC 4388 (Oosterloo and van Gorkom
2005) and NGC 4522 (Kenney et al. 2004)
showed that all galaxies are systematically small in H I in the cluster core where the IGM density
is highest (>Fig. 4-11), with two clear examples of ongoing ram pressure stripping: NGC 4522
(Kenney et al. 2004), and NGC 4388 (Oosterloo and van Gorkom 2005). These studies provided
insight into why the relative H I content in galaxies in dense environments is low (Solanes et al.
2001).
Internal gas removal processes, often referred to as “feedback,” are most obvious in galaxies
with either an AGN or a massive starburst. Very telling examples are the nearby galaxies M 82
and NGC 253. >Figure 4-12 shows the H I, the ionized gas and the hot X-ray gas blown out
of the central disk by the massive nuclear starburst in NGC 253 (Boomsma et al. 2005). For
a review of such massive starbursts, see Heckman et al. (1993). These phenomena are much
more energetic than the moderate “Galactic Fountain” mechanism but may have much shorter
duration. The combination of such processes has been implemented in theoretical models
describing galaxy evolution (Cook et al. 2010; Kereš et al. 2009a, b; Springel et al. 2005) and

The Cool ISM in Galaxies
⊡Fig. 4-12
Deep optical image of NGC 253 with superposed H I column density contours (in green at 0.18,
0.36, 0.72, 1.4, 2.9, 5.8, 12, and 23 × 1020 cm−2) and 0.1–0.4 keV X-ray emission (in red). The nuclear
outburst is clearly visible in X-rays outlining the hot gas, and in H I outlining the cooler gas at the
periphery of the nuclear wind (Boomsma et al. 2005)
appears to be important for regulating the star formation such that the observed luminosity
and H I mass functions can be reproduced.
Understanding the balance between gas removal and gas accretion processes, including the
role ofthe environment, will be a crucial element ofunderstanding galaxyevolution. Though the
current work on H I in a variety of environments is beginning to provide insight (van Gorkom
2008, 2011), it is based on only a small number of cases. New facilities, recently or soon avail-
able, will image an order of magnitude more galaxies and therefore contribute significantly to
determining this balance. Such facilities are ALMA, the E-VLA, APERTIF on the WSRT (Ver-
heijen et al. 2008, 2009; Oosterloo et al. 2010b), MeerKAT (de Blok et al. 2010; de Blok 2011),
and ASKAP (Johnston et al. 2009; Westmeier and Johnston 2010).

The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution 5
209
Abstract:
Galaxy evolution is influenced by environment. The properties in terms of mor-
phology, color, gas content, and star formation of galaxies residing in the field, groups, or
clusters are markedly different. Environmental effects include gravitational interactions with
other galaxies or the cluster potential and hydrodynamical effects as ram pressure stripping. An
overview of the theoretical and observational aspects of galaxy evolution in different environ-
ments is given. Spherical, disk, and dwarf galaxies are discussed separately. Different simulation
techniques for the modeling of environmental effects on the ISM are presented and compared.
Environmental interactions leave imprints on the atomic and molecular hydrogen, dust, cos-
mic ray gas, and large-scale magnetic fields. They also modify the star formation of a galaxy that
enters an environment of higher density. A global picture of galaxy evolution in different envi-
ronments is drawn by combining integrated and resolved observations at multiple wavelengths.
Special attention is given to multiwavelength interaction diagnostics of individual cluster galax-
ies. This leads to a more detailed understanding where and how different interactions occur.
We are now at the point where we can study the reaction (phase change, star formation) of the
multiphase ISM (molecular, atomic, ionized) to environmental interactions.

Introduction
During cosmic evolution, matter, which is sufficiently close to a massive object, decouples from
the Hubble flow and is accreted by the massive object. Accretion takes place mostly within fil-
amentary structures. In this way, a galaxy cluster gains mass through infall of dark matter, gas,
and stars. Galaxy clusters have typical masses of –M⊙and sizes of several Mpc. They
contain hundreds of galaxies. The mass budget is dominated by dark matter which contributes
about 80% to the total mass; galaxy clusters are thus the objects with the highest dark mat-
ter fraction in the universe. A tenuous (∼−cm−) gas sits in the gravitational potential of
the whole cluster. When gas falls into the galaxy cluster, accretion shocks heat it to the Virial
temperature (−K; Sarazin 1986). It then stays hot, because of the exceedingly long cool-
ing time of such a low-density gas. This X-ray emitting cluster atmosphere represents typically
10–20% of the total cluster mass. The optically visible side of a galaxy cluster, i.e., the galaxies,
only account for 5–10% of the cluster mass. The large-scale evolution of a galaxy cluster is thus
mainly governed by gravitation and gas heating.
On smaller scales, things are more complex. Together with the dark matter and gas, galaxies
fall into the cluster. These galaxies might have been isolated or assembledin groups before infall.
Once they enter the cluster, their evolution can change radically through interactions with their
environment. It is known for decades that galaxy populations in clusters are very different from
those in the field, i.e., outside galaxy groups and clusters. The morphological type of a galaxy is
closely related to its environment (Dressler 1980; Whitmore and Gilmore 1991): whereas about
80% of the field galaxies are spirals, this fraction drops to ∼50% at the cluster outskirts and
becomes almost zero in cluster cores.
Even within the disk galaxy population, cluster spiral galaxies are redder and have less star
formation than field galaxy of similar Hubble types (Kennicutt 1983; Gavazzi et al. 2006a). Since
morphology is closely related to the star formation history of a galaxy, it is not surprising that
the average galaxy properties related to star formation also depend on local density (Hashimoto
et al. 1998; Lewis et al. 2002; Gómez et al. 2003; Kauffmann et al. 2004; Balogh et al. 2004).
The fraction of early-type galaxies and passive non-star-forming galaxies both grow with time

210 5
The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution
during cluster evolution. The rate at which these fractions change depends sensitively on envi-
ronment, i.e., the local density of galaxies (Dressler et al. 1997; Poggianti et al. 1999; Smith
et al. 2005; Postman et al. 2005; Moran et al. 2007). Whereas in the cluster cores the early-type
fraction has increased steadily with time from 70% at z = to 90% at the present epoch, in
intermediate-density regions corresponding to groups and the accretion regions of rich clus-
ters, significant evolution appears to begin only after z = .. At the same time, the fraction of
blue star-forming galaxies in clusters decreases with time (Butcher–Oemler effect; Butcher and
Oemler 1978, 1984).
The analysis of a spectroscopic catalog of galaxies in ten distant clusters (Dressler et al. 1999;
Poggianti et al. 1999) has shown that the galaxy populations of these clusters are characterized
by the presence of a large number of post-starburst galaxies. Poggianti et al. (1999) concluded
that the most evident effect due to the cluster environment is the quenching of star formation
rather than its enhancement. They found two different galaxy evolution timescales in clusters:
(i) a rapid halt of star formation activity (∼1 Gyr) and (ii) a slow transformation of morphology
(several Gyr).
To understand the galaxy transformation with time, we have to understand when, where,
and which interaction between a galaxy and its cluster environment changes the galaxy’s aspect.
The ideal place to find answers to these questions is a local cluster where the interaction mech-
anisms can be studied in detail at high spatial resolution (≤1 kpc) and where the whole range
of galaxies to low luminosities can be observed. Therefore, this chapter is focused on the Virgo,
Coma, and Abell 1367 clusters and to a lesser extent, on the Norma and Fornax clusters. At this
point, it should be noted that galaxy clusters can be very different. Whereas the Virgo cluster
is a dynamical young cluster with a high spiral fraction and a peaked X-ray emission (cooling
core cluster), the Coma cluster is more relaxed and spiral-poor and has a much more extended
X-ray emission distribution.
The consequences of a galaxy–cluster interaction can be observed in the integrated and
resolved properties of a cluster galaxy. The seminal article on late-type galaxy evolution in local
clusters of Boselli and Gavazzi (2006) is mainly based on the integrated properties of cluster
galaxies at multiple wavelengths. The fundamental review on the relation between physical
properties and environment of Blanton and Moustakas (2009) is based on statistical results
from recent large surveys of nearby galaxies including the SDSS. Therefore, special attention
will be payed to the resolved properties of Virgo spiral galaxies.
2
Galaxy Populations in Groups and Clusters
As many as 50–70% of all galaxies reside in groups of galaxies (Eke et al. 2005). These groups
contain less than ∼100 galaxies and have total masses of ∼M⊙. Studies of groups at low red-
shift have revealed them tobe a heterogeneous population with theirgalaxypopulations varying
from cluster-like to field-like (Zabludoff and Mulchaey 1998). Groups showing extended X-ray
emission tend to have a significant fraction of early-type galaxies and a dominant early-type
galaxy at the group center (Mulchaey and Zabludoff 1998; Mulchaey et al. 2003; Osmond and
Ponman 2004; Jeltema et al. 2007). About 30% of galaxy groups are dominated by elliptical or
lenticular galaxies (Croston et al. 2005).
The group environment changes the morphology of galaxies. McGee et al. (2008) compared
the fractional bulge luminosities of galaxies in groups at .< z < .to a similarly selected

The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution 5
211
group sample at .< z < .. They found that, at both epochs, the group and field frac-
tional bulge luminosity distributions differ significantly, with the dominant difference being a
deficit of disk-dominated galaxies in the group samples. The group environment thus favors the
formation of bulge-dominated early-type galaxies.
The same phenomenon is found in galaxy clusters. From his study of ∼6,000 galaxies in
55 rich clusters, Dressler (1980) showed that the fraction of early-type galaxies increases with
projected galaxy density: elliptical galaxies prevail in high-density regions, i.e., in the cores of
massive clusters, whereas spiral galaxies are the dominant population in low-density regions.
Lenticular galaxies occupy regions with intermediate to high galaxy densities. This is known as
the morphology–density relation.
Moreover, the fraction of spiral galaxies in a galaxy cluster increases with increasing red-
shift (Dressler et al. 1997; Fasano et al. 2000). The spiral population in distant clusters consists
of the great majority of blue galaxies responsible for the Butcher–Oemler effect, as well as a size-
able fraction of the red population (Dressler et al. 1999; Poggianti et al. 1999). Coupled to the
increase in the spiral fraction, the S0 galaxies at intermediate redshifts are proportionately (two
to three times) less abundant than in nearby clusters, while the fraction of ellipticals is already
as large or larger (Dressler et al. 1997).
A morphology–density relation also exists for dwarf galaxies: dwarf elliptical galaxies are
more frequent in dense environments, while dwarf irregulars are ubiquitous (Binggeli et al.
1990; Sabatini et al. 2005).
In galaxy clusters, a morphological segregation with respect to the distance from the clus-
ter center is observed for R < .Mpc (Dressler 1980; Whitmore et al. 1993). Thomas and
Katgert (2006)claimed that this morphology–radius relation is mainlydue tothe different radial
distributions of bright elliptical and late-type galaxies.
Environment thus influences the morphological mix of galaxies in regions of different
galaxy density and/or cluster radius. Is this mix already in place before the assembling of a
massive structure as a galaxy cluster (nature) or is it established by galaxy evolution within a
dense environment (nurture)? Environment does play an important role for the evolution of
late-type spiral galaxies. In the following, it will be discussed how interactions between a galaxy
and its environment can affect its ecology and ultimately its morphology.
3
Interaction Types
One can distinguish two different classes of interactions based on gravitation or gas physics. The
first class includes galaxy–galaxyand galaxy–clustertidal interactions. The second class involves
the hot intracluster medium through which the galaxy is moving at a high speed. Whereas
gravitational interactions act in the same way on all components of a galaxy (dark matter, stars,
and gas), hydrodynamic interactions only affect the galaxy’s interstellar matter.
3.1 Gravitational Interactions
The tidal interaction of a galaxy and the gravitational potential of the whole cluster is com-
pressive within the cluster core. A disk parallel to the orbital plane develops a transient spiral
pattern. If the disk is inclined with respect to the orbital plane, it is transiently compressed and

212 5
The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution
an initially circular disk is deformed into an ellipse (Byrd and Valtonen 1990; Valluri 1993;
Henriksen and Byrd 1996). The compression increases with decreasing distance to the cluster
center.
Direct galaxy–galaxy encounters affect a spiral galaxy significantly if the impact parameter
is of the order of or smaller than
b = r (M
m ) ,
(5.1)
where r and m are the size and mass of the galactic disk at the optical radius and M is the mass
of the perturbing galaxy. In addition, the relative velocity between the galaxy has to be close to
the rotation velocity of the spiral galaxies (100–200 km s−). The prominent example for a tidal
interaction in the Virgo cluster is NGC 4438 (>Fig. 5-1).1
Fast encounters with relative velocities much larger than the rotation velocity lead to tidal
shocks, which heat the systems. The increased kinetic energy causes the system to expand and
cool. A prograde encounter where the orbital angular momentum is aligned with the rotational
angular momentumleads to strong tidal arms, whereas a retrograde encountergives rise to only
mild tidal distortions. The seminal article of Struck (1999) gives a detailed description of tidal
effects during galaxy–galaxy encounters.
Since the velocityofclustergalaxies is large (400–1,000 km s−), slow galaxy–galaxyencoun-
ters are rare once a galaxy has entered the cluster core. However, since a significant fraction of
infalling galaxies are assembled in groups, slow encounters can occur at the periphery of clus-
ters (preprocessing, Dressler 2004). On the other hand, multiple tidal shocks induced by rapid
flybys of massive galaxies lead to an expansion of the stellar disk. This effect is termed galaxy
harassment (Moore et al. 1996, 1999). The probability of close encounters with massive galaxies
is higher in the cluster core, where the galaxy density is highest. The disk stars and gas loos-
ened from the galaxy by multiple flybys are then stripped by the gravitational potential of the
⊡Fig. 5-1

1The strength parameter for a galaxy–galaxy collision has been defined by Gerber and Lamb (1994) as S =
GM/(bvrelvrot), where vrel is the relative velocity between the two galaxies and vrot is the rotation velocity of
the primary galaxy.

whole cluster. Since it is easier to strip matter from a galaxy with a shallow potential well, galaxy
harassment most efficiently affects low-mass systems and might lead to a morphological trans-
formation. However, in most cases harassment does not change the morphology of massive,
high surface brightness disk galaxies (Moore et al. 1999).
Tidal shocking through multiple nearby high-speed encounters and the cluster potential
depends on the galaxy orbit within the cluster. A highly eccentric orbit leads the galaxy close to
the cluster center where both effects are strong.
3.2 Hydrodynamical Interactions
Whereas gravitational interactions act equally on the dark matter, stellar, and gaseous content
of a spiral galaxy, hydrodynamical interactions take place between the hot intracluster gas and
the interstellar medium of the galaxy. There is evidence that the star formation rate of a massive
spiral galaxy of about 1 M⊙/year has to be balanced by accretion of cold gas (Sancisi et al. 2008)
and hot gas (Rasmussen et al. 2009) from an extended halo. In the absence of this gas halo, star
formation is consuming the interstellar medium within a few Gyr. Larson et al. (1980) were
the first to propose a halt of external gas accretion in cluster spiral galaxies. Bekki et al. (2002)
developed this concept of starvation or strangulation by studying the stripping of an extended
diffuse gas halo by ram pressure from the intracluster medium. They concluded that the diffuse
halo is stripped if the galaxy orbit is eccentric, leading it to a pericenter distance three times
larger than the cluster core radius. Once the halo is stripped, star formation will decrease and
the galaxy becomes red.
A galaxy which enters a cluster on an eccentric orbit accelerates due to the gravitational
potential of the cluster. At the same time, it encounters an intracluster medium of increasing
density when it approaches the clustercenter. From the point of view of the galaxy, which moves
at a high speed through the cluster atmosphere, a wind due to ram pressure blows on its inter-
stellar medium. If this ram pressure wind is higher than the gravitational restoring force due to
the stellar disk, the gas is removed or stripped from the galactic disk (Gunn and Gott 1972):

where G is the gravitation constant, ρICM the intracluster medium density, vgal the galaxy
velocity with respect to the intracluster medium, Σ∗/ISM the stellar/gas surface density, vrot the
rotation velocity, and Rstr the stripping radius. Gas which is located at R > Rstr is removed via
momentum transfer from the galactic disk by ram pressure stripping. The associated timescale
is short trps ∼10–100 Myr (Abadi et al. 1999; Vollmer et al. 2001a; Roediger and Brüggen 2006).
One of the best examples of ongoing ram pressure stripping is the Virgo cluster spiral galaxy
NGC 4522 (>Fig. 5-2).
Whereas momentum transfer ram pressure stripping only removes the gas of the outer disk,
continuous gas removal from the whole gas disk proceeds via viscous stripping (Nulsen 1982).
This stripping mode dominates if the galaxy moves edge-on through the cluster atmosphere.
Viscosity can be classical for laminar flows or turbulent depending on the effective Reynolds
number of the hot gas

where λKH is the dominant wavelength for the gas ablation by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (see,

Gott criterion ( > 5.2). The stripping radius for viscous edge-on stripping is somewhat larger
but comparable to that of momentum transfer face-on stripping (Marcolini et al. 2003). The
instabilities lead to mixing of the intracluster medium into the ISM, which leads to a decrease
of the ISM density. For nICM = −cm−, Ω = −year−, vturb = km s−, and vgal =
, km s−, the viscous stripping timescale is τvisc ∼Gyr, much longer than that of classical
momentum transfer ram pressure stripping (10–100 Myr). The magnetic fields contained in
the ISM and intracluster medium might suppress Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (Landau and
Lifshitz 1960; Spitzer 1978) and stripping might become laminar. Moreover, if the fields are
stretched along the surface, thermal conduction will be suppressed (Vikhlinin et al. 2001).

Simulations
Since the work of Toomre and Toomre (1972), gravitational interactions between two galaxies
have been simulated extensively (see, e.g., Combes et al. 1988; Barnes and Hernquist 1996; Duc
et al. 2004). Today’s simulations of gravitational interactions include the interstellar medium
of the galaxies and a recipe for star formation. Byrd and Valtonen (1990) and Valluri (1993)
investigated gravitational interactions between a disk galaxy and the gravitational potential of
the whole cluster. Since the impact of this interaction on a galaxy is small, this subject did not
receive further attention.
In the recent past, most progress has been made on the modeling of ram pressure stripping
events. Therefore, this section is focused on the simulations of the hydrodynamic interaction
between the intraclustermedium and the ISM. The ISM can be simulatedeither by a continuous
description (Eulerian hydrodynamics in 2D or 3D), a discrete description (sticky particles),
or a discrete-continuous hybrid description (smoothed particles hydrodynamics, SPH). The
common point of all methods is that the gas is treated as a collisional phase, whereas dark
matter and stars are collisionless. The discrete description has no shocks nor instabilities and
a finite penetration length of the intracluster medium into the ISM. This penetration length
is 0 by definition in SPH. The latter method handles shocks and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities,
but it is not able to produce Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The continuous description solves
Euler’s equations for compressible gas dynamics. Either the gas is assumed to be adiabatic or
gas cooling is explicitly implemented. Modern codes contain an adaptive mesh refinement to
resolve small-scale structures as shocks (see, e.g., Fryxell et al. 2000). Since the ISM is neither
a continuous medium nor exclusively made of clouds, one has to chose the numerical method
which is well adapted for the investigated astrophysical problem.

The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution
4.1 Spherical Galaxies
The bulk of gas in elliptical galaxy is hot, has a high volume filling factor, and can be detected in
X-rays. It has tobe modeled bya continuous prescription. The gas is supported against gravityby
thermal pressure and rotation is negligible. Complete ram pressure stripping from a spherical
galaxy requires that ram pressure exceeds the thermal pressure at the center of the gravita-
tional potential well of the galaxy. For incomplete stripping, hydrodynamical simulations show
a leading bow shock and a weak gravitationally focused wake or tail behind the galaxy.
Takeda et al. (1984), Gaetz et al. (1987), and Balsara et al. (1994) studied the influence of
constant ram pressure in 2D. The two lattersimulations included gas cooling and replenishment
by stellar mass loss. Gaetz et al. (1987) determined several important parameters affecting the
stripping efficiency. For not too high galaxy velocities, Balsara et al. (1994) found that the galaxy
accretes mass from the downstream side into the core. Stevens et al. (1999) continued the work
of Balsara performing a parameter study, for parameters appropriate for different clusters, rang-
ing from cool clusters or groups up to hot clusters. They provide synthetic flux and hardness
maps, as well as surface brightness profiles which can be directly compared to observations.
Mori and Burkert (2000) studied ram pressure stripping of a cluster dwarf spheroidal galaxy
without cooling and gas replenishment. They found that the gas in dwarf galaxies is rapidly
removed in a typical cluster environment by ram pressure stripping. Stripping proceeds in two
phases: (i) instantaneous ram pressure stripping via momentum transfer and (ii) gas ablation
by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities with a timescale of ∼1 Gyr.
4.2 Disk Galaxies
The ISM in disk galaxies is supported by rotation. For a face-on ISM-intracluster medium inter-
action, gas stripping occurs mainly via rapid momentum transfer. For edge-on interactions,
slow viscous stripping or gas ablation by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities is responsible for ISM
removal. For intermediate angles between the disk plane and the direction of the ram pres-
sure wind, both mechanisms are at work. Since SPH and sticky particle codes do not produce
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, they cannot simulate turbulent viscous stripping.
All simulations validate the Gunn and Gott formula ( > 5.2) and yield similar short
timescales for ram pressure stripping via momentum transfer (10–100 Myr; Jáchym et al.
2007, 2009). Whereas sticky particle and SPH simulation produce similar results, Eulerian
hydrodynamical simulations show differences in (i) the dependence between the stripped mass
fraction and inclination angle between the disk plane and ram pressure wind and (ii) gas back-
fall after the ram pressure peak. In the following, an overview is given on simulations using the
different numerical techniques.
Tosa (1994) studied the influence of ram pressure on a disk galaxy treating the gas as test
particles. Vollmer et al. (2001a) used a sticky particle code including the effects of ram pressure
stripping to study the influence of (i) time-dependent ram pressure due to the galaxy orbit
within the cluster and (ii) the inclination angle between the orbital and the disk plane on gas
removal. They showed that ram pressure can lead to a temporary increase of the central gas
surface density. In some cases, a considerable part of the total atomic gas mass (several M⊙)
can fall back onto the galactic disk after the stripping event. A quantitative relation between
the orbit parameters and the resulting gas loss was derived containing explicitly the inclination
angle between the orbital and the disk plane. Jáchym et al. (2009) proposed an alternative and

The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution 5
217
physically motivated relation depending on the disk tilt angle and on the column density of the
encountered intracluster medium.
Abadi et al. (1999) modeled a constant ram pressure wind on a disk galaxy using SPH for
different values of ram pressure and different inclination angles between the orbital and the
disk plane. Schulz and Struck (2001) used an SPH code allowing for gas cooling. They observed
a dependency of the stripped gas mass on the inclination angle. Not all the gas stripped from
the disk escapes immediately from the halo, some gas can linger for times of order 100 Myr.
Under the action of ram pressure, the gas disk is displaced relative to the halo center and com-
pressed. In this way, the formation of numerous flocculent spirals is triggered. These waves
transport angular momentum outward, resulting in further compression of the inner disk. This
“annealing” process makes the inner disk, which contains much of the total gas mass, resistant
to further stripping. Jáchym et al. (2007, 2009) investigated the evolution of the ISM which
undergoes time-dependent ram pressure at various inclination angles with SPH. They high-
lighted the significant dependence of the stripping efficiency on the duration of a short ram
pressure pulse. Their simulations confirmed the general trend of less stripping at orientations
close to edge-on. The dependence on the disk tilt angle is more pronounced for compact intr-
acluster medium distributions; however it almost vanishes for strong ram pressure pulses. The
role of ram pressure stripping on star formation was studied by Kronberger et al. (2008).
Eulerian hydrodynamical simulations of ram pressure stripping of disk galaxies became
possible only in the last decade in 2D (Roediger and Hensler 2005) and 3D (Quilis et al. 2000;
Roediger and Brüggen 2006; Tonnesen and Bryan 2009). Marcolini et al. (2003) addressed the
role of ram pressure stripping for dwarf disk galaxies. Roediger and Brüggen (2006) investi-
gated the role of inclination between the orbital and the disk plane for constant ram pressure
(>Fig. 5-3). They found that the inclination angle does not play a major role for the mass loss as
long as the galaxy is not moving close to edge-on (i > ○). This different behavior compared to
sticky particles and SPH is probably due to the action of strong Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.
The stripping of disk galaxies on realistic orbits within the cluster was studied by Roediger and
Brüggen (2007). These authors observed a repeated backfall of stripped gas prior to pericenter
passage. In contrast to SPH and sticky particle simulations, there is no backfall after pericenter
passage. Tonnesen and Bryan (2009) included radiative cooling in their high-resolution sim-
ulations to model the reaction of clumpy ISM to ram pressure stripping. In their simulations,
lower density gas is stripped quickly from any radius of the galaxy, and the higher density gas
can then be ablated via Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The overall stripping timescale is thus
longer than in previous simulations. The stripped gas tails are studied in Roediger et al. (2006),
Roediger and Brüggen (2008), Tonnesen and Bryan (2010), and Tonnesen et al. (2011).
The combined influence of tidal interactions and ram pressure stripping was addressed by
Vollmer (2003), Vollmer et al. (2005a, b), and Kapferer et al. (2008). Tidal interactions can push
the outer ISM to larger galactocentric radii. In addition, the ISM has often a lower surface den-
sity. This tidally loosened gas is easily stripped by ram pressure. Tidal interactions thus increase
the stripping efficiency.
Three-dimensional Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations of a whole galaxy cluster are pre-
sented in Domainko et al. (2006), Kapferer et al. (2007), and Tonnesen et al. (2007). These
simulations generally show huge gas tails behind the stripped galaxies. In these simulations,
the intracluster medium is not static but moving. Depending on the galaxy’s velocity vector
⃗vICM, this changes ram pressure from ρICMv
gal to ρICM∣⃗vgal −⃗vICM∣. This can have sig-
nificant consequences for a galaxy moving against the ram pressure wind (see NGC 4522
in >Sect. 8.3).

The Multiphase ISM
In a widely accepted picture (see, e.g., Kulkarni and Heiles 1988; Spitzer 1990; McKee 1995),
the ISM consists of five different phases which are listed in >Table 5-1. About 80% of the total
gas mass is neutral and 50% is in form of clouds or filaments. The warm/cold neutral phase
is observable in Hi line emission/absorption and the molecular phase in CO line emission.
Hα emission traces the dense warm ionized medium (diffuse gas and Hii regions) and X-ray
emission the hot ionized gas phase. The CO emission in spiral galaxies is concentrated in the
inner disk where giant molecular clouds are ubiquitous. In field spiral galaxies, Hα emission is
detectable over the whole stellar disk. The extent of Hi emission is usually 1.5–2 times larger
than the galaxy’s optical diameter (R). Cosmic ray electrons, which are accelerated in super-
nova shock waves to relativistic velocities, are observable in the radio continuum at wavelengths
≥6 cm. The associated magnetic field is traced by the polarized radio continuum emission. In
the following, an overview is given on the observations of the different ISM phases in groups
and clusters with emphasis on nearby clusters.
5.1 Atomic Hydrogen
The ISM at galactic radii larger than ∼2 scale-lengths of the optical disk of a spiral galaxy
is mostly made of atomic hydrogen. The Hi disk of isolated galaxies typically extends up
to 1.5–1.8 optical radii (Cayatte et al. 1990; Salpeter and Hoffman 1996; Broeils and Rhee
1997; Walter et al. 2008). Since the outer gas of a spiral galaxies is less strongly bound by
the gravitational potential, it is most vulnerable against external perturbations. Therefore, the
Hi emission of a cluster and group spiral galaxy is the most sensitive tracer of environmental
interactions.
Hi-deficient galaxies are observed in group environments. This indicates that the environ-
ment affects the gas content of the group galaxies. Since the galaxy velocity dispersion and the
intragroup gas density are small, slow tidal interactions are the main driver of galaxy evolu-
tion within groups. The fraction of Hi-deficient galaxies depends on the evolutionary stage
of the group. Evolved groups display an X-ray halo and a high fraction of early-type galax-
ies. Kilborn et al. (2009) determined the Hi deficiency of galaxies within 16 galaxy groups.
They found that around two-thirds of Hi-deficient galaxies were preferentially located at a

projected distance of less than 1 Mpc from the group center.2 Sengupta et al. (2007) observed 13
galaxies from fourX-raybright groups having disturbed and often truncated Hi disks. Kern et al.
(2008) imaged 16 Hi sources in six galaxy groups. They found several interacting systems with
extended Hi envelops. The Hickson compact groups (HCGs), owing to their high number den-
sity coupled with low-velocity dispersions, undergo frequent tidal interactions, distortions, and
mergers between group members (Hickson et al. 1992; Mendes de Oliveira and Hickson 1994).
Huchtmeier (1997) determined the Hi content of 54 Hickson Compact groups. Many of these
groups show extreme Hi deficiencies as compared to nearby groups. In their sample of 72 Hick-
son compact groups, Verdes-Montenegro (2001) found that galaxies are, on average, deficient
in Hi by a factor of ∼2 compared to loose groups. Tidal interactions between galaxies in groups
thus can efficiently remove atomic gas from galactic disks.
Davies and Lewis (1973) were the first who noticed a difference in the Hi content of Virgo
spiral galaxies compared to field spiral galaxies of the same morphological type. A first quanti-
tative comparison sample for isolated galaxies was established by Haynes and Giovanelli (1984).
Similar to Chamaraux et al. (1980), these authors introduced the Hi deficiency:
defHI = log Mexp
HI
Mobs
HI
,
(5.8)
where Mobs
HI is the observed and Mexp
HI the expected Hi mass of a galaxy of the same size and
morphological type. A galaxy with an Hi deficiency of defHI = has thus lost 90% of its atomic
hydrogen. The typical uncertainty of the Hi deficiency is 0.25. Based on their comparison sam-
ple, Giovanelli and Haynes (1985) showed that a significant fraction of galaxies in dense clusters
are Hi deficient and that the Hi deficiency increases with decreasing distance to the cluster cen-
ter (>Fig. 5-4). Gavazzi (1987, 1989) and Gavazzi et al. (2005, 2006b) completed this picture for
the Virgo cluster and the Coma supercluster region. The Hi mass function of the Virgo Cluster
differs significantly from that in the field, due to the combined effect of morphology segregation
and the presence of Hi-deficient objects (Gavazzi et al. 2005).
Solanes et al. (2001) continued the work of Giovanelli and Haynes (1985) by extending the
sample to 1,900 galaxies within 18 clusters. They did not find a correlation between the fraction
of Hi-deficient spirals in a cluster and the clusters’global properties. The Hi deficiency is related
to the morphology of the galaxies and not to their optical size. The radial extent of the region
with significant gas removal from galaxies can reach up to two Abell radii. Within this region,
the fraction of Hi-deficient spiral galaxies increases continuously toward the cluster center.
A blind Arecibo Hi survey of the Virgo cluster (80 deg) showed that Hi-rich Virgo galaxies
are structurally similar to ordinary late-type galaxies. This is consistent with a scenario where
a structural change of a galaxies implies a significant loss of atomic hydrogen. Moreover, less
than 1% of early-type galaxies contain neutral hydrogen (>M⊙; Gavazzi et al. 2008).
Imaging observations of the atomic gas content of cluster spiral galaxies showed that
Hi-deficient galaxies have truncated gas disks (Virgo cluster: Warmels 1988; Cayatte et al. 1990;
Chung et al. 2009 (>Fig. 5-5); Coma cluster: Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2000). Galaxies near the clus-
ter core (≤0.5 Mpc) have Hi disks that are significantly smaller compared to their stellar disks.
The most natural explanation for these findings is ram pressure stripping. Cayatte et al. (1994)
divided their galaxy sample into four groups: (i) Hi-normal galaxies, (ii) galaxies with mildly
truncated Hi and a central surface density which is lower than that of normal galaxies, (iii)
galaxies with strongly truncated Hi and a low central surface density, and (iv) anemic galaxies
2Galaxy groups have sizes of ∼1 Mpc. The typical size of compact groups is about half this value.

which a mildly truncated and show an overall very low Hi surface density. In their sample of ∼50
Virgo galaxies, Chung et al. (2007) found seven spiral galaxies with long Hi tails. These galaxies
are found in intermediate- to low-density regions (0.6–1 Mpc in projection from M 87). The
tails are all pointing roughly away from M 87, suggesting that these tails may have been created
by a global cluster mechanism. A rough estimate suggests that simple ram pressure stripping
could have indeed formed the tails in all but two cases. It should be noted that in three of the
seven systems, a gravitational galaxy–galaxy interaction is involved.
5.2 Molecular Hydrogen
The ISM becomes mainly molecular in the inner part of the galactic disk. The Hsurface den-
sity has about the same scale-length as the stellar disk (e.g., Leroy et al. 2008). The molecular

X-ray image (orange) by Böhringer et al. (1994). The galaxies are located at the proper position in
the cluster, but each HI image is magniﬁed by a factor 10 (From Chung et al. 2009)
gas is sitting deeply in the gravitational potential of the galaxy and is thus very hard to move
or remove. However, in the absence of gas accretion, the molecular gas will be consumed
by star formation within a few Gyr (Bigiel et al. 2008). Molecular hydrogen can only be
indirectly observed via CO line emission. To derive Hcolumn densities and masses, a con-
version factor X = N(H)/I(CO) has to be assumed. For massive galaxies, the standard value
X = × cm−(K km s−)−applies (Dame et al. 2001). For low-mass, low-metallicity sys-
tems, the conversion factoris substantiallyhigher. Boselli et al. (2002)give a correlation between

The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution 5
223
X and the NIR H band luminosity of a galaxy. As the Hi deficiency, the Hdeficiency is defined
as the logarithm of the ratio between the expected and measured Hmass of a galaxy.
Observations of the molecular gas in group galaxies are rare. Boselli et al. (1996) did not find
any difference between the molecular gas content of spiral galaxies in Hickson Compact groups
compared to isolated spirals. On the other hand, Leon et al. (1998) argued for an enhanced
molecular gas content in compact group galaxies, especially for the most compact groups, sug-
gesting that tidal interactions can drive the gas component inward, and concentrating it in the
dense central regions, where it is easily detected.
CO observations of galaxies in the Virgo (Stark et al. 1986; Kenney and Young 1986; Boselli
et al. 1995, 2002) and Coma cluster (Casoli et al. 1991, 1996) did not show an Hdeficiency
in these clusters, i.e., cluster spirals are indistinguishable from field spirals with respect to
their molecular gas content. However, Fumagalli and Gavazzi (2008) found a weak correlation
between the Hmass divided by the stellar mass and the Hi deficiency.
5.3 Dust and Metallicity
Heavy elements are produced in massive stars and released by stellar winds and supernova
explosions. Metallicity is thus closely linked to the star formation history of a galaxy. The spec-
trum of a stellar population does not only depend on its age but also on its metallicity. Little is
known about environmental effects on metallicity.
Early-type galaxies with low-velocity dispersions in Hickson Compact groups show an
enhanced [Mg/Fe] ratio and depleted metallicity [Z/H] with respect to their counterparts in the
field (de la Rosa et al. 2007). This anomalous behavior is interpreted as evidence for the action
of a mechanism that truncates star formation. This is expected after a merger event between
two spiral galaxies.
The influence of environment on metallicity is still an open question. Skillman et al. (1996)
determined the metallicity gradients of 9 Virgo spiral galaxies. They found that Hi-deficient
Virgo galaxies have larger mean abundances than field galaxies of comparable luminosity or
Hubble type, while the spirals at the periphery of the cluster are indistinguishable from the field
galaxies. There is also weak evidence of shallower abundance gradients in the Hi-deficient Virgo
spirals compared to the spirals on the periphery of the cluster. On the other hand, by reanalyzing
the Skillman sample, Pilyugin et al. (2002) found that all Virgo periphery and core spirals have
counterparts among field spirals. They concluded that if there is a difference in the abundance
properties of the Virgo and field spirals, this difference appears to be small and masked by the
observational errors. Lee et al. (2003) compared oxygen abundances of Virgo to local dwarf
elliptical galaxies with the conclusion that there is no systematic difference between the two
populations. Boselli and Gavazzi (2006) presented evidence that Hi-deficient galaxies have on
average larger metallicities than similar objects with a normal gas content.
Metals are injected into the interstellar medium by AGB stars, stellar winds, and supernova
explosions. These metals aggregate to form dust which absorbs the energy of the stellar UV
emission and reemits it in the infrared. The ISM dust-to-gas column density ratio is related
to the metallicity. Molecular hydrogen forms on the surface of dust grains. The Hforma-
tion timescale thus depends on the dust-to-gas ratio or metallicity of the ISM (Tielens and
Hollenbach 1985). In normal galaxies, the bulk of dust mass has temperatures around 20 K and
is detected at wavelengths >μm. The bulk of the radiation is emitted at wavelengths between
and μm from warm dust (∼30 K). Dust is mixed with the ISM and therefore follows

224 5
The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution
its distribution. Gas removal thus always implies dust removal. Bicay and Giovanelli (1987)
derived far-infrared (IRAS 60–100 μm) properties for a sample of over 200 galaxies in seven
clusters. Irrespective of the Hi deficiency of a cluster galaxy, the sample consists almost entirely
of infrared-normal galaxies. However, they found a lack of high luminosity (LIR > L⊙) com-
pared tothe field. The Herschel (100–500 μm)Virgoclusterluminosityfunctions show the same
lack of very luminous galaxies. In addition, they do not have the large numbers of faint galaxies
seen previously in surveys covering less dense environments (Davies et al. 2010). Popescu et al.
(2002) derived temperatures and masses of cold dust from the IRAS and ISOPHOT μm
data. Using the same data, Boselli and Gavazzi (2006) argued that there is a tentative trend
of smaller dust masses in galaxies of higher Hi deficiency. This is expected if the dust which is
associated to the ISM is stripped during a ram pressure stripping event. Based on Herschel data,
Cortése et al. (2010b) confirmed this scenario by showing that galaxies with truncated Hi disks
also have truncated dust disks. Stickel et al. (2003) presented the first tentative detection of an
intergalactic dust cloud in the region between galaxies near the stripped Virgo spiral galaxy,
NGC 4402. The clearest evidence of dust displaced together with the ISM from the disk of the
Virgo cluster spiral galaxy NGC 4438 is presented by Cortése et al. (2010a).

Electrons are accelerated to relativistic velocities in supernova shocks. In the presence of a
magnetic field, they emit synchrotron radiation. The hot electrons in Hii regions emit thermal
bremsstrahlung. The radio continuum emission of non-starburst galaxies at wavelengths >6 cm
is dominated by synchrotron emission whose emissivity is proportional to the density of rela-
tivistic electrons and the magnetic field strength to the power of ∼2. In spiral galaxies, the radio
continuum emission is closely related to the star formation rate and the far-infrared emission
(Helou et al. 1985; Niklas et al. 1997; Niklas 1997). It is well possible that the influence of the
cluster environment on the radio continuum emission of cluster galaxies depends on the cluster
properties, especially on those of the intracluster medium. Jaffe and Gavazzi (1986), Andersen
and Owen (1995), and Rengarajan et al. (1997) found an enhanced radio to far-infrared ratio in
galaxies which are located in the cores of dense clusters. Gavazzi and Boselli (1999a) studied the
radio luminosity function of Virgo cluster galaxies for early- and late-type galaxies separately.
They found that late-type galaxies develop radio sources with a probability proportional to their
optical luminosity, independently of their detailed Hubble type. In a second article, Gavazzi
and Boselli (1999b) compared the radio luminosity functions of galaxies in different clusters
to those of isolated galaxies. They concluded that the radio luminosity function of Virgo clus-
ter galaxies is consistent with that of isolated galaxies, whereas the Coma cluster galaxies show
an excess of radio emissivity. Moreover, Gavazzi and Boselli (1999b) suggested that the radio
excess observed in dense cluster galaxies is probably due to ram pressure compression of the
ISM and its associated magnetic field or shock-induced re-acceleration of relativistic electrons
as proposed by Völk and Xu (1994). It should be kept in mind that in the absence of imaging
observations, a radio excess can also be due to nuclear activity. Vollmer et al. (2004a) deter-
mined the spectral index of the radio continuum emission of 81 Virgo galaxies. They noted that
galaxies showing flat radio spectra also host active centers. No clear trend appeared between
the spectral index and the galaxy’s distance to the cluster center.

Star Formation
As reviewed in
> Chap. 3, the star-formation activity of a galaxy can be determined using
various tracers (Kennicutt 1998a): (i) dense Hii regions around massive (>8 M⊙) stars give
rise to Hα line emission, (ii) other recombination and forbidden nebular lines are emitted by
gas around massive stars, (iii) intermediate-mass (–M⊙) stars show strong UV emission,
(iv) dust is heated by this UV emission and radiates at wavelengths between and μm,
and (v) supernova shocks/remnants emit in the radio continuum. Since star formation approx-
imatelly follows the ISM surface density via the Schmidt law (Schmidt 1963; Kennicutt 1998b),
gas removal leads to a decrease of star formation in a group or clustergalaxy. On the other hand,
gravitational interactions can lead to important tidal torques which compress the gas and lead
to a temporarily enhanced star formation rate.
Wilman et al. (2005) showed that the fraction of galaxies with [O II] emission, a measure of
star formation, is much higher in group galaxies at intermediate redshift (z ∼.) than in the
local universe. However, the group galaxies still exhibit suppressed star formation relative to
the field at the same epoch. Although observations have found abundant traces of tidal interac-
tions in Hickson Compact Group (HCG) galaxies (Mendes de Oliveira and Hickson 1994), their
star formation levels are surprisingly similar to those found in isolated galaxies (e.g., Zepf and
Whitmore 1991; Moles et al. 1994; Allam et al. 1996; Verdes-Montenegro et al. 1998; Iglesias-
Páramo and Vílchez 1999). Johnson et al. (2007) looked at the Spitzer IRAC (.–.μm) color
space distribution of HCGs and found that the mid-infrared (MIR) colors of galaxies in Hi gas-
rich HCGs are dominated by star formation, while the MIR colors of galaxies in Hi gas-poor
HCGs are dominated primarily by stellar photospheric emission. Galaxies in the most gas-rich
groups tend to be the most actively star forming. Galaxies in the most gas-poor groups tend to
be tightly clustered around a narrow range in colors consistent with the integrated light from
a normal stellar population. These authors infer an evolutionary sequence in which galaxies
in gas-rich groups experience star formation and/or nuclear actively until their neutral gas is
consumed, stripped, or ionized.
Kennicutt (1983) was the first to compare the star formation rate of cluster spirals to that
of field spirals of similar Hubble type. He found that Virgo cluster spiral galaxies have on aver-
age lower star formation rates than their isolated counterparts. Based on Hα observations of
273 galaxies in the Virgo, Coma, Abell 1367, and Cancer clusters, Gavazzi et al. (2006a) con-
cluded that, within each Hubble-type class, galaxies with normal Hi content have twice the Hα
equivalent width of their Hi-deficient counterparts. The star formation rate per unit mass of
high-luminosity spirals that are projected within one virial radius is about a factor of 2 lower
than at larger clustercentric projected distances, whereas low-luminosity objects have similar
Hα properties at all clustercentric radii.
The analysis of the Hα equivalent width of large galaxy samples with redshifts .≤z ≤.
from the SDSS and the 2dF survey (Lewis et al. 2002; Gómez et al. 2003; Tanaka et al. 2004)
showed that the overall distribution of star formation rates is shifted to lower values in dense
environments compared with the field population. This is consistent with earlier findings by
Hashimoto et al. (1998). The distribution of the star formation rate as a function of projected
galaxy surface density shows a discontinuity or a break at a galaxy number density of ∼1 Mpc−.
This corresponds to a cluster radius of about Mpc or ∼3 Virial radii. In the Tanaka et al. (2004)
sample, only faint galaxies show this break. The morphology of these galaxies also changes sig-
nificantly. It seems thus difficult to disentangle the star formation-density relation from the

226 5
The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution
morphology–density relation. It should be noted that all galaxies used in these samples are of
high luminosity according to the definition of Gavazzi et al. (2006a).
Imaging observations of the star formation of larger samples of cluster galaxies are rare.
Koopmann and Kenney (2004a, b) divided the Hα morphology of 52 Virgo spiral galaxies
into several categories: (i) normal (37% of the sample), anemic (6%), enhanced (6%), and
(spatially) truncated (52%). Anemic galaxies have a significant lower overall Hα surface bright-
ness. Truncated galaxies are further subdivided on the basis of their inner star formation
rates into truncated/normal (37%), truncated/compact (6%), truncated/anemic(8%), and trun-
cated/enhanced (2%). The fraction of anemic galaxies is relatively small (∼10%) both in the
Virgo cluster and the field, suggesting that starvation is not a major factor in the reduced star
formation rates of Virgo spiral galaxies. The majority of Virgo spiral galaxies have their Hα disks
truncated, whereas truncated Hα disks are rarer in isolated galaxies (> Fig. 5-6). Most of the
Hα-truncated galaxies have relatively undisturbed stellar disks and normal to slightly enhanced
inner disk star formation rates. Koopmann and Kenney (2004a, b) suggested that ram pressure
stripping is the main mechanism causing the reduced star formation rates of Virgo spiral galax-
ies. Fumagalli and Gavazzi (2008) found in their much smaller Virgo cluster galaxy sample a
larger fraction of truncated/anemic galaxies.

The Global Picture
Based on the observational findings presented in >Sect. 5, a consistent global picture for galaxy
evolution in groups and cluster can be constructed.
Since in galaxy groups, the galaxy velocity dispersion (∼200 km s−) and the density of the
intergalactic medium are low, ram pressure is in most cases negligible and slow galaxy–galaxy
collisions should be the main driver of galaxy evolution. Close flybys leading to important tidal
perturbations are relatively frequent. Tidal interactions can pull gas and stars out of the gravita-
tional potential of a galaxy. In X-ray bright groups, which have a rich intergalactic medium, the
tidally expelled gas might then be stripped by ram pressure. The merging of two spiral galax-
ies leads to a lenticular or elliptical galaxy, depending on the interaction parameters. The end
product are galaxies with a quenched star formation which then evolve passively. Thus, group
galaxies can already be gas deficient with a low star formation rate with respect to their field
counterparts and/or of early type before they fall into a galaxy cluster. This phenomenon is
termed as preprocessing of galaxies in groups. Cortése et al. (2006) presented a nice illustra-
tion of a compact group with a bright lenticular galaxy which is falling into the galaxy cluster
Abell 1367. If the low-luminosity group galaxies were observed later, when ram pressure has
stripped their gas entirely and star formation has stopped, they would probably resemble the
post-starburst galaxies detected by Poggianti et al. (2004) in the Coma cluster.
Once a galaxy enters the cluster, its fate depends on the eccentricity of its orbit and the dis-
tribution of the intracluster medium. Observations indicate that Hi-deficient galaxies are on
more eccentric orbits within a cluster than Hi-normal galaxies (Dressler 1986; Solanes et al.
2001). Numerical simulations (Ghigna et al. 1998) showed that galaxy dark matter halos evolv-
ing within a cluster settle on isotropic orbits with a median ratio of pericentric to apocentric
radii of 1:6. In dynamically young, spiral-rich clusters as Virgo, the intracluster medium distri-
bution is peaked on the central elliptical galaxy. In relaxed, spiral-poor clusters such as Coma,
the intracluster medium distribution is more extended. In the latter case, less eccentric orbits are

needed to remove a significant amount of gas from the galaxy by ram pressure stripping. The
velocity dispersion of cluster galaxies is typically higher than km s−. In the cluster core,
where the galaxy density is high, gravitational encounters occur in the form of rapid flybys.
These lead only to significant distortions if the impact parameter is small. At the apocenter of a
galaxy orbit, far away from the cluster center, a slow galaxy–galaxy encounter is not excluded.
The primary effect of the cluster environment on a galaxy is the quenching of its star forma-
tion. If ram pressure is the cause of the quenching, the timescale is small (–Myr). If the
main cause for the halt of star formation are gravitational interactions, the timescale is much
longer ≥1 Gyr. The high fraction of spiral galaxies with truncated gas and star formation disks
indicates that ram pressure is an important environmental effect in the Virgo cluster. Once the
galaxies have lost their outer gas disk, star formation stops in these regions. There is no direct
observational evidence that ram pressure instantaneously alters the gas content of the inner
disk in a significant way. The molecular gas contents and star formation rates of stripped galax-
ies are similar to those of unperturbed galaxies. After a few Gyr, the gas of the inner disk will be
consumed by star formation and truncated gas, and star formation disk will become anemic.
In the absence of significant star formation, the galaxy’s color becomes red and the
luminosity-weighted mean stellar population age increases. For the galaxy population of the
local universe, a change in the fraction between the number of blue young and red old galaxies
can already be observed in regions of low galaxy density. As expected, this fraction decreases
with increasing density. In cluster of galaxies, the fraction between the number of blue young
and red old galaxies is reversed with respect to that of isolated galaxies. Old red galaxies are the
dominant population in clusters (> Fig. 5-7; Blanton and Moustakas 2009). At fixed morpho-
logical class according to light concentration, the distribution of stellar population ages strongly
depends on environment. In contrast, galaxy–scaling relationships keep constant with environ-
ment, i.e., the distribution of galaxy morphologies does not depend strongly on environment
once color is fixed (e.g., Bamford et al. 2008; Blanton and Moustakas 2009). Based on the analy-
sis of large samples of nearby galaxies, it is claimed that environmental effects are relatively local.
It appears that preprocessing of galaxies in groups is the main driver of these effects (Blanton
and Moustakas 2009). However, this does not exclude that clusterenvironment can significantly
affect infalling galaxies (see >Sect. 8.2).
How can a spiral be transformed into a lenticular galaxy? Dressler (1980) showed that the
bulge sizes and bulge-to-disk ratios of lenticular galaxies are systematically larger than those of
spiral galaxies. Boselli and Gavazzi (2006) confirmed this result for the Virgo cluster. Christlein
and Zabludoff (2004) excluded the generation of early-type galaxies (E/S0) by fading the disks
of late-type galaxies. Under their assumptions, the bulge luminosities needed to be physically
enhanced for such a transformation. Since ram pressure does not act on the stellar content
of a spiral galaxy, only tidal interactions can lead to such an enhancement. Moreover, (i) the
large scatter in the Tully–Fisher relation of Coma and Virgo cluster S0 galaxies in comparison
to the known late-type spiral relation, together with the small zero-point offset, and (ii) the
weak dependence of morphological segregation on galaxy density cannot be explained by an
S0 formation through simple gas removal from spiral galaxies. Again, tidal interactions like
slow encounters, minor mergers, or harassment are needed to transform spiral galaxies into
lenticulars (Dressler and Sandage 1983; Neistein et al. 1999; Hinz et al. 2003).
Bright and faint lenticulars might not share the same history (Barway et al. 2009). Bright
cluster and field lenticulars resemble ellipticals and bulges of early-type spirals suggesting that
they may have formed at early epochs via major mergers or rapid collapse. Faint cluster lenticu-
lars show systematic differences with respect to faint field lenticulars. These differences support

the idea that the bulge and disk components fade after the galaxy falls into a cluster, while
simultaneously undergoing a transformation from spiral to lenticular morphologies (Barway
et al. 2009; Boselli and Gavazzi 2006). It thus seems that, if one wants to look for the end prod-
uct of spiral galaxy transformation in a galaxy cluster, one should have a look at faint cluster
lenticulars.
Due to their shallow gravitational potential, dwarf galaxies are particularly vulnerable
to environmental interactions. Gravitational interactions, most probably in form of galaxy
harassment ( > Sect. 3.1), can efficiently remove stars and gas from the outer parts of the
galaxy and transform the galaxy’s morphology. Ram pressure stripping ( >Sect. 3.2) of dwarf
irregular galaxies (dI) removes the gas, stops star formation, and makes the galaxy evolve
passively.
The density morphology relation ( > Sect. 2) extends to low-luminosity dwarf galaxies
(Binggeli et al. 1988, 1990). Early-type dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies strongly prefer dense

environments. They represent the numerically dominant galaxy population in nearby galaxy
clusters and groups (Ferguson and Binggeli 1994). In galaxy groups, dEs are preferentially
found near giant galaxies. One of the specific properties making dE/dS0s different from late-
type dwarf irregular and spiral galaxies is the lack of interstellar medium (ISM) and, hence,
ongoing star formation. Stellar populations of dE galaxies are remarkably different from those
of giant early-type galaxies pointing out to differences in star formation histories and chemical
evolution.
Most dE galaxies have compact nuclei with a whole range of sizes and central surface bright-
nesses (Côté et al. 2006). Based on their analysis of 413 Virgo cluster dwarf ellipticals, Lisker
et al. (2007) divided their sample into nucleated and nonnucleated dEs depending on the pres-
ence of a strong nucleus compared to the galaxy’s total luminosity. The nonnucleated dEs can
show disk features like bars or spiral arms (also named dwarf S0 galaxies, dS0) and can have cen-
tral star formation. Whereas the nucleated dEs have a centrally peaked distribution within the
cluster-like giant elliptical and lenticular galaxies, the distribution of nonnucleated dEs shows
no central clustering.
About half of the dEs are supported by rotation (van Zee et al. 2004a; Toloba et al. 2011).
Based on the observed maximum rotation velocities, the rotating dwarf galaxies appear to fol-
low the Tully–Fisher relation for gas-rich dwarf and spiral galaxies. No significant difference in
dominant stellar populations between rotating and nonrotating dwarf elliptical galaxies (Geha
et al. 2003; van Zee et al. 2004b) or between dEs with and without disks (Paudel et al. 2010) were
found. The analysis of the color–magnitude relation of these objects led Lisker et al. (2008) to the
conclusion that there must be multiple formation channels. Boselli et al. (2008) compared UV
to radio centimetric properties of star-forming and quiescent Virgo dwarf galaxies to the pre-
dictions of multizone chemospectrophotometric models. The models include the quenching
of star formation due to ram pressure stripping. These authors suggested that young, low-
luminosity, high surface brightness star-forming galaxies such as late-type spirals are probably
the progenitors of relatively massive dwarf ellipticals, while it is likely that low surface brightness
Magellanic irregulars evolve into very low surface brightness quiescent objects hardly detectable
in ground-based imaging surveys.
Dwarf elliptical thus represent a heterogeneous class of galaxies. Most probably several dif-
ferent mechanisms, including environmental effects as galaxy harassment and ram pressure
stripping, are involved in the creation of the overall population of dEs.
Ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) have properties between dwarf ellipticals and glob-
ular clusters. They were first discovered in the Fornax and Virgo clusters (Hilker et al. 1999;
Drinkwater et al. 2000; Ha¸segan et al. 2005). They are also found around giant galaxies in
nearby groups. Ultracompact dwarfs are characterized by predominantly old stellar popula-
tions (≥8 Gy, e.g., Chilingarian et al. 2011), small sizes (half-light radii of ≤rh ≤pc),
and dynamical masses of × ≤M ≤M⊙(Hilker et al. 2007; Mieske et al. 2008).
As dEs, ultracompact dwarfs represent a heterogeneous class of objects (Mieske et al. 2006).
They might be (i) very massive globular clusters, (ii) tidally stripped nucleated dEs (Bekki et al.
2001), or (iii) end products of small-scale primordial density fluctuations in dense environ-
ments (Phillipps et al. 2001). It is suggested that the most massive ultracompact dwarfs are
remnants ofmore extended galaxies, whereas the less massive ones represent a transition objects
toward the regime of ordinary globular clusters (Chilingarian et al. 2011).
If tidal stripping acts on massive progenitors, one would expect the remnants to be larger
and more luminous than UCDs. An example of such an object is M 32, a compact elliptical (cE)
satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy. It has a luminosity comparable to typical dE in clusters but

10 times smaller half-light radius, therefore 1,000 times higher stellar density per unit of vol-
ume. For several decades cE galaxies were considered unique since only three of them including
M 32 were known and several dedicated searches failed to detect any. Therefore, even solid argu-
ments for M 32 to be a heavily tidally stripped lenticular galaxy (Graham 2002) did not allow to
consider tidal stripping an important channel of galaxy evolution because of the lack of exam-
ples. The situation might change with the discovery of a population of 21 cE galaxies in nearby
galaxy clusters by Chilingarian et al. (2009). These authors showed that the properties of the cE
galaxies can be reproduced by numerical simulations of tidal stripping.

Resolved Multiwavelength Interaction Diagnostics
Can we catch a galaxy with an ongoing environmental interaction? To do so, imaging obser-
vations with a spatial resolution of ∼1 kpc are necessary. With multiwavelength imaging
observations, the reaction of the multiphase interstellar medium and star formation to these
interactions can be studied in detail. Deep optical imaging reveals perturbations of the galaxy’s
stellar content due to tidal interactions. The comparison between optical and interferometric Hi
observations can discriminate between tidal and hydrodynamic interactions. Since ram pres-
sure only affects the gas, a symmetric stellar disk with a truncated gas disk within the optical
radius and a one-sided gas tail in a cluster galaxy are signs of ongoing ram pressure stripping
(e.g., Chung et al. 2007). In rare cases, extraplanar molecular gas traced by its CO emission can
also be found (Combes et al. 1988; Vollmer et al. 2005b, 2006). Perturbed and extraplanar star
formation distributions are observed in Hα (e.g., Koopmann and Kenney 2004b) or UV (e.g.,
Abramson et al. 2011). Sometimes the radio continuum halo can be compressed on the side
where ram pressure is acting (Gavazzi et al. 1995; Crowl et al. 2005). In rare cases, an extended
one-sided X-ray tail is detected (e.g., Sun et al. 2006).
Relatively new diagnostic tools are the polarized radio continuum and radio/FIR distribu-
tions of cluster spiral galaxies.
Under the assumption of a constant FIR-radio correlation within normal galaxies, Murphy
et al. (2009) used Spitzer infrared data to create model radio maps, which were compared to
observed radio images. These authors found that galaxies, which are affected by ram pressure
stripping, have enhanced global radio fluxes with respect to the FIR. These galaxies contain
regions along their outer edges where the observed radio surface brightness is significantly
below the model expectation (>Fig. 5-8). The radio-deficient regions are located in the direc-
tion of the ram pressure wind and often show an enhanced polarized radio continuum emission
(see >Fig. 5-9 for NGC 4522).
Polarized radio continuum emission is due to relativistic electrons with density ne gyrat-
ing around the regularly oriented, large-scale magnetic field B: SPI ∝neB. The polarized
radio continuum emission is enhanced in regions where shear and compression of the regu-
lar or random magnetic field component parallel to the sky plane occur. From spectroscopic
observations, noncircular motions of the order of ∼10 km s−induced by an interaction can be
determined by a detailed analysis of a galaxy’s velocity field (e.g., Schoenmakers et al. 1997).
On the other hand, the distribution of polarized radio continuum emission represents a very
sensitive tool for uncovering the transverse motions of the ISM (Beck 2005) even in the case of
unfavorable inclinations (close to face-on). Therefore, the information contained in polarized
radio continuum emission is complementary to that of Hα, CO, and Hi observations. The total

⊡Fig. 5-8
Radio-deﬁcient regionsof theVirgo cluster spiral galaxiesNGC4330, NGC4402, and NGC4522 with
radio continuum contours (From Murphy et al. 2009)
radio continuum emission is sensitive to the turbulent small-scale magnetic field, which is usu-
ally a factor of 2–5 larger than the regular large-scale magnetic field in spiral arms and 1–2
times larger in the interarm regions at a typical resolution of a few 100 pc (Beck 2001). When-
ever there is enhanced turbulence due to an enhanced star formation efficiency, the large-scale
magnetic field is diminished. The polarized radio continuum emission has to be observed at
a frequency that is high enough to avoid significant Faraday rotation (typically >2 GHz). In a
pioneering work, Vollmer et al. (2007) presented 6 cm polarized radio continuum emission of
8 Virgo spiral galaxies. All galaxies show strongly asymmetric distributions of polarized inten-
sity with elongated ridges located in the outer galactic disk. These features are not found in
existing observations of polarized radio continuum emission of field spiral galaxies, where the
distribution of 6 cm polarized intensity is generally relatively symmetric and strongest in the
interarm regions. Once an asymmetric distribution of polarized radio continuum emission is
detected,one has to discriminate between shear or compression motions as its cause. In the case
of ram pressure compression, one expects an Hi gas tail at the opposite side of the compression
region (e.g., Vollmer et al. 2004b; >Fig. 5-9). Tidal interactions can lead to compression and
shear motions (Soida et al. 2006).
8.1 Environmental Eﬀects in Nearby Galaxy Groups
In galaxy groups, encounters between two galaxies are the most important environmental effect.
Relative velocities between galaxies are small, and for small impact parameters, tidal fields
produce important distortions of the stellar and gaseous content of the galaxies. Since galaxy
density is highest in compact groups, galaxy encounters occur frequently in this environment.
One of the best studied compact group is Stephan’s Quintet which is madeof four group galaxies
and one foreground object. A fifth galaxy, situated ∼4′ to the east, is also dynamically associated
to the group. The group has experienced a violent dynamical history with numerous interac-
tions between the different members during the past Gyr. As a result of these interactions, two
tidal arms, a faint older one and a brighter young one stemming from NGC 7319, have been
created toward the eastern side of the group (Sulentic et al. 2001). The other group spiral galax-
ies show important tidal perturbations. Because of these interactions, most of the gas is found

R-band image (from Williams et al. 2002). The galaxy with the white area (NGC 7320) is in the
foreground. The HI projected onto this galaxy actually belongs to the group
in a highly disturbed intragroup medium (>Fig. 5-10; Williams et al. 2002). The last and pre-
sumably ongoing event involves the collision of the gas-rich spiral NGC 7318b with the debris
field produced by past interactions.
Due tothe dense environment, galaxyand groupevolution is accelerated in compact groups.
In Stephan’s Quintet, we can directly observe galaxy transformation via multiple gravitational
encounters. In this way, gas and stars are loosened and eventually removed from the parent
galactic disks. The fraction of the diffuse light from tidally stripped stars to the total light from
the group can be up to ∼50% in compact groups (da Rocha and Mendes de Oliveira 2005).
Galaxy mergers lead to lenticular or elliptical galaxies. Indeed, there are compact groups whose
galaxypopulations are dominated byearly-type galaxies (e.g., Huchtmeier 1997). Since gas disks
of normal spiral galaxies are more extended than stellar disks, the amount of expelled gas is
larger than that of stars. This gas then forms an intragroup medium. It is expected to be heated
through evaporation in a previously existing intragroup medium or through large-scale shocks
from freshly accreting material falling into the galaxy group.
To investigate the importance of ram pressure stripping in compact groups, Rasmussen
et al. (2008) analyzed the diffuse X-ray emission of 8 Hi-deficient Hickson compact groups.

If ram pressure stripping were the dominant cause of Hi removal, one would expect an impor-
tant intragroup medium traced by X-ray emission in these groups. Their finding that the most
Hi-deficient groups do not show a detectable hot intragroup medium suggests that tidal interac-
tions are the most likely cause of gas removal. This is consistent with the absence of a correlation
between the fraction of Hi-deficient galaxies in a group and the X-ray luminosity in the sam-
ple of Kilborn et al. (2009). On the other hand, Hi imaging of spiral galaxies in X-ray bright
groups (Sengupta et al. 2007) revealed disturbed morphologies and truncated gas disks com-
pared to field spirals. The observed gas disk truncation might be an indication that ram pressure
stripping plays a role in groups with a prominent intragroup medium.
Thus, for the overall statistics tidal interaction dominate and ram pressure seems to play a
minor role in the evolution of group spiral galaxies. However, in X-ray bright groups, it may
represent an additional cause for the observed Hi deficiency. Most probably, the ISM has to be
loosened tidally to be stripped efficiently by ram pressure. In rare cases, arriving spiral galaxies
can undergo important ram pressure if the intragroup gas is still in the form of relatively dense
tidal tails of atomic gas from a previous galaxy–galaxy encounter. As an example, Clemens et al.
(2000) presented the case of ram-pressure stripping by a gaseous tidal tail in the interacting pair
of galaxies NGC 4490/4485.
8.2 Environmental Eﬀects in Nearby Galaxy Clusters
Multiwavelength imaging observations of cluster galaxies give insights when and where in the
cluster a galaxy experiences an environmental interaction and how its different components
are affected by this interaction. In the following, we will have a look at five close galaxy clusters:
Coma, Norma, Abell 1367, Virgo, and Fornax. The five clusters represent quite different envi-
ronments. The Coma, Norma, and Abell 1367 clusters are more massive than the Virgo and
Fornax clusters. Whereas the Norma and Virgo clusters are dynamically active with galaxy sub-
groups or clusters falling onto and merging with the main cluster, Coma and Fornax are more
dynamically quiescent, i.e., their galaxy accretion rates are much lower than those of Norma,
Abell 1367, and Virgo. However, even in the more quiet systems galaxies and galaxy groups are
still falling into the main cluster. The fraction of Hi-deficient galaxies is large in Coma, Virgo,
and Norma and intermediate in Abell 1367. Galaxies in the Fornax cluster do not show signs
of strong Hi deficiency (Horellou et al. 1995). In the following, the properties of these clusters
sorted by velocity dispersion are presented.
1. The Coma cluster is a massive relaxed cluster with a mass of ∼× M⊙within Mpc
and galaxy velocity dispersion of km s−. It is the richest nearby (∼90 Mpc) cluster and
represents the end product of an ancient merger of two clusters. The dominating two cen-
tral elliptical galaxies, NGC 4874 and NGC 4889, are reminiscent of this merger. The Coma
cluster is spiral-poor which is typical for rich clusters. Despite the symmetric galaxy distri-
bution, a galaxy group in the southwest of Coma, associated with the giant elliptical galaxy
NGC 4839, has probably passed the cluster core in the recent past. The cluster is X-ray lumi-
nous, has a symmetric main component with an extendedintraclustermedium distribution,
and has some substructure related to galaxy groups (Briel et al. 1992). For a review on the
Coma cluster, see Biviano (1998).
2. The Norma cluster (Abell 3627) is the nearest (∼65 Mpc) rich, massive cluster of galaxies
(Kraan-Korteweg et al. 1996; Woudt 1998), with properties comparable to the Coma cluster

236 5
The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution
(Mazure et al. 1998). It has remained relatively unexplored in comparison to its well-known
counterpart, mainly because of its location at low galactic latitudes in the southern zone
of avoidance (ZOA) where dust extinction and star crowding dilute its appearance. The
dynamical mass ofthe Norma clusteris ∼M⊙within its Abell radius ofMpc. The galaxy
velocity dispersion is km s−(Woudt et al. 2008). The spiral/irregular galaxies reveal a
large amount of substructure. The X-ray emission distribution is not spherically symmetric
and shows indications of an ongoing cluster merger (Böhringer et al. 1996).
3. Abell 1367 forms together with the Coma cluster the Coma-Abell 1367 supercluster at a
distance of ∼90 Mpc. Its velocity dispersion is 880 km s−(Moss et al. 1998). The cluster is a
rather unusual example of a rich clusterwith a comparatively high fraction of spiral galaxies.
It has been identified as having significant optical and X-ray substructure (Grebenev et al.
1995). The X-ray emission is elongated along a southeast-northwest axis and contains small,
localized clumps. This is interpreted as a merger of two subclusters (Donnelly et al. 1998).
The high spiral fraction and a relatively cool intracluster medium temperature (Donnelly
et al. 1998) are typical of what is expected for a dynamically young system.
4. The Virgo cluster is less massive (∼× M⊙within .Mpc) and has a galaxy velocity
dispersion of ∼600 km s−. It represents the nearest cluster (17 Mpc) in the northern hemi-
sphere. The Virgo cluster is spiral-rich and has a lot of substructure (see, e.g., Schindler et al.
1999). Different galaxy groups can still be distinguished spatially and kinematically from the
main cluster. Virgo is thus said to be dynamically young. Its X-ray luminosity is ∼6 times
smaller than that of the Coma cluster. X-ray emission can be associated to the main cluster,
where it is strongly peaked on the central elliptical galaxy M 87, and several substructures
(Böhringer et al. 1994).
5. After Virgo, the largest concentration of galaxies within 20 Mpc is the Fornax cluster. Its
spiral-rich galaxy distribution has a more regular shape than that of the Virgo cluster, indi-
cating a more dynamically evolved state. Fornax is also considerably smaller and denser
than Virgo, with a core radius ∼40% that of Virgo and a central density twice as large. The
total mass of Fornax is .–× M⊙within ∼1 Mpc (Drinkwater et al. 2001; Dunn and
Jerjen 2006), its velocity dispersion 380 km s−(Drinkwater et al. 2001). The X-ray emission
shows an asymmetric spatial distribution, and the central elliptical galaxy, NGC 1399, is
offset from the center (Paolillo et al. 2002), which may be related to large-scale dynamical
evolution such as infall motions of galaxies into the cluster (Dunn and Jerjen 2006).
In a cosmological context, galaxies assemble into small groups which then merge forming
large groups or small clusters like Fornax. A central cluster is growing with the accretion of
groups and small clusters (Virgo). When two big clusters merge, they have the appearance of
Abell 1367 or the Norma cluster. Without further accretion, the cluster virializes and becomes
spherical (Coma). Galaxy clusters can be classified according to their degree of relaxation. Non-
relaxed clusters have an irregular overall shape, are spiral-rich, and have a low X-ray luminosity.
On the other hand, relaxed clusters are spherical, rich of early-type galaxies, and have a high
X-ray luminosity. However, not all clusters follow these rules. Each cluster is different and has
its own personality according to its assembling history. This cosmological scenario is further
discussed in >Sect. 10.
In the next section, we will have a close look at resolved multiwavelength observations of
cluster galaxies. Early-type cluster galaxies have a corona of abundant hot gas (several K),
which is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the galaxy’s gravitational potential and emits in X-rays.
In addition, small amount of cold gas ∼M⊙are often found in the galaxy cores. The ISM of

The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution 5
237
late-type galaxies has a multiphase structure with a dominant neutral warm and cold phase as
described in >Sect. 5. It is confined within the galactic disk and supported by rotation. Dwarf
spiral and irregular galaxies possess a neutral warm/cold ISM which is either supported by
rotation and velocity dispersion, respectively. Due to the shallow potential well of these galax-
ies, their gas content can be removed easily by environmental interactions. Because of these
differences, early-type, late-type, and dwarf galaxies will be discussed separately.
8.2.1 Early Type Galaxies
In early-type cluster galaxies, the hot corona is exposed to the intracluster medium. Environ-
mental effects are thus detectable in X-ray emission. The signpost of ram pressure compression
is a sharp edge on one side of the galaxy. The X-ray surface brightness drops by an order of
magnitude over the edge. These “cold fronts” are contact discontinuities, in which a sharp drop
in surface brightness (gas density) is accompanied by a corresponding rise in gas temperature.
This is characteristic for the motion of a spheroid through a uniform gas and is consistent with
a jumplike density discontinuity at the boundary in the direction of the galaxy’s motion within
the intracluster medium. The sharpness of the edge is a strong function of the inclination angle
between the galaxy’s 3D velocity vector and the plane of the sky. The edge is most prominent if
the galaxy has a negligible radial velocity with respect to the surrounding intracluster medium.
Sometimes, an X-ray low surface brightness tail can be found at the opposite side of the sharp
edge (e.g., Machacek et al. 2006).
X-ray spectra yield information on the density, temperature, and metallicity of the inter-
stellar medium of the elliptical galaxy and the intracluster medium. The ISM density and
temperature are typically nISM ∼a few −cm−and T ∼.keV= × K with an about
solar metallicity. The density and metallicity of the intracluster medium are smaller, and its
temperature is higher (TICM ≥.keV∼× K). The pressure jump can be used to deter-
mine the Mach number Mand thus the velocity with which the galaxy moves through the
intracluster medium (Landau and Lifshitz 1959). For a subsonic motion (M≤):

where γ = /is the adiabatic index for a monoatomic ideal gas and p/pthe gas pressure in
the ISM and the intraclustermedium, respectively. Together with the observed radial velocity of
the galaxy, the transverse velocity in the plane of the sky and the inclination angle between the
galaxy’s 3D velocity and the plane of the sky can be determined. The latter has to be consistent
with the observed X-ray morphology.
With this method, Machacek et al. (2005) derived a pressure jump of p/p∼implying a
Mach number of M∼for the elliptical galaxy NGC 1404 in the Fornax cluster (>Fig. 5-11).
This galaxy is approaching the dominant elliptical galaxy of the Fornax cluster, NGC 1399, and
undergoes significant ram pressure by the Fornax cluster intracluster medium.
Another example of a cluster elliptical galaxy undergoing active ram pressure is NGC 4552
(M 89) in the Virgo cluster. This galaxy is located at a projected distance of ′ = kpc east

(northwest, upper right) galaxies in the Fornax cluster (From Machacek et al. 2005)
of M 87, the central elliptical galaxy of the Virgo cluster. NGC 4552 has an extended (∼10 kpc)
X-ray low surface brightness tail (Machacek et al. 2006). The properties of the X-ray tail are con-
sistent with it being composed primarily of ram pressure stripped galaxy gas. The tail is denser
and cooler than the Virgo intracluster medium. On the opposite side, a classical cold front is
detected. Galaxy gas inside the leading edge is cool (kT = .keV) compared to the surround-
ing 2.2-keV Virgo intracluster medium. The pressure ratio of ∼7 across the leading edge of the
ram pressure interaction corresponds to a Mach number of ∼2. Two horns of emission extend-
ing 3–4 kpc to either side of the edge are composed of gas in the process of being stripped from
the galaxy due to the onset of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. This galaxy thus also undergoes
turbulent viscous stripping (see >Sect. 3.2).
The same overall X-ray morphology is found in another massive Virgo elliptical galaxy,
NGC 4472 (M 49; Biller et al. 2004), which is located at a projected distance of .Mpc south
of M 87. A taillike structure in the X-ray emitting gas extends ∼′ = kpc to the southwest of
the galaxy core. The northeastern edge in the X-ray emission distribution is most probably the
result of ram pressure compression as NGC 4472 falls toward the center of the Virgo cluster.
The most enigmatic elliptical galaxy in the Virgo cluster is M 86. The second brightest Virgo
elliptical galaxy is located at a projected distance of only kpc from M 87 and has a high
radial velocity with respect to the Virgo cluster mean (∼1,000 km s−). It might be located as
far as Mpc behind M 87 (Mei et al. 2007). An X-ray study of M 86 with Einstein (Forman
et al. 1979) revealed a peak of emission centered on M 86 and a plume extending northwest of
the galaxy. Subsequent observations showed substructure in the M 86’s X-ray halo. Finoguenov
et al. (2004a) revealed a cold front in the southwest of the galaxy core which is most probably
due to ram pressure compression. They ascribed the huge X-ray plume to a gravitational inter-
action. This scenario has gained support by the detection of faint Hα emission connecting the
perturbed spiral galaxy NGC 4438 to M 86 (>Fig. 5-17; Kenney et al. 2008). On the other hand,
Randall et al. (2008) suggested that the X-ray plume is due to ram pressure stripping.

8.2.2 Late Type Galaxies
Tidal interactions lead to asymmetries in the stellar distribution of the galactic disk observ-
able in the NIR, optical, and UV. The signposts of ram pressure stripping are (i) gas disks
which are truncated inside the optical radius, (ii) one-sided Hi tails together with a sym-
metric old stellar disk, and (iii) radio-deficient regions and/or asymmetric ridges of polarized
radio continuum emission located in the outer-disk opposite to the gas tail (> Fig. 5-9). One-
sided tails of warm or hot gas observable in Hα and X-rays are much rarer than tails of
atomic gas. Radio continuum tails are the exception. A significant fraction of perturbed cluster
galaxies undergo a tidal interaction and ram pressure stripping at the same time. In the follow-
ing, an inventory of environmentally affected disk galaxies in the different nearby clusters is
presented.
Coma Cluster
Bravo-Alfaro et al. (2000) imaged the 19 brightest spiral galaxies in the Coma cluster in the
Hi line (> Fig. 5-12). The galaxies, which are located at projected distances smaller than
d = .Mpc, show truncated gas disks with pronounced asymmetries in their atomic gas dis-
tributions and/or shifts between the optical and the Hi positions. Twelve spiral galaxies were
not detected with typical upper Hi mass limits of M⊙. Seven of the twelve non-detections
are located in the central region of Coma (d < .Mpc). In addition to Hi asymmetries, UV
and Hα asymmetries seem to be a common property of ram pressure stripped Coma cluster
galaxies. Whereas the UV emission only traces young massive stars, the Hα emission can also
provide from ionized dense gas. Yagi et al. (2010) found extended Hα clouds associated with 14
Coma cluster galaxies obtained from deep narrow-band imaging observations with the Subaru
Telescope. The parent galaxies are blue and distributed farther than 0.2 Mpc from the peak of
the X-ray emission of the cluster. Smith et al. (2010) found tails or trails of UV-bright debris in
13 star-forming Coma cluster galaxies, which they interpreted as young stars formed within gas
stripped by ram pressure from the intracluster medium. Within 1 Mpc projected distance from
the cluster center, about 30% of blue galaxies show UV trails. These trails are predominantly
oriented away from the cluster center, indicating that the galaxies are falling into the cluster for
the first time, along radial orbits.
One of the Coma spiral galaxies barely detected in Hi is NGC 4848 (CGCG 160-055
on > Fig. 5-12). This highly inclined spiral galaxy is located on the outermost X-ray con-
tour northwest of the cluster center. The atomic gas is displaced to the northwest with respect
to the optical disk. Its molecular gas distribution is also asymmetric with an off-center sec-
ondary maximum coincident with the inner part of the displaced atomic gas (Vollmer et al.
2001b). The Hα emission shows a double line in this conspicuous region. One line is due
to galaxy rotation, the other line is most probably gas accelerated by ram pressure. Further-
more, an X-ray tail is detected to the northwest which is more extended than the Hi emission
(Finoguenov et al. 2004b). An estimation of the stripping radius ( > 5.2) based on the intra-
cluster medium density at the projected distance of NGC 4848 given by Briel et al. (1992) and
a galaxy velocity of 2,000 km s−yields a stripping radius twice as large as the edge of the gas
and star formation. Thus, either the galaxy already had its closest approach to the cluster center
and is now leaving the cluster core as proposed by Vollmer et al. (2001a), or the intracluster
medium has an overdensity or moves in the direction opposite to that of the galaxy’s motion
(see >Sect. 9).

Norma Cluster
The detection of long one-sided X-ray tails is very rare compared to Hi detections.
The most spectacular example is that of the late-type galaxy ESO 137-001 (Sun et al.
2006, 2007, 2010; >Fig. 5-13), which is most probably stripped nearly face-on. The projected
distance from the cluster’s X-ray peak of this blue emission-line galaxy is only kpc. About
80% of the galaxy’s total X-ray emission corresponding to a gas mass of ∼M⊙is found
behind the galactic halo. The X-ray tail consists of two components: a straight and thin (∼8 kpc)
main tail with a size of ∼80 kpc and a secondary fainter and curved X-ray tail. The main tail
is brightest in the middle and near the galactic disk. The gas temperature in the tail is con-
stant (kT ∼.keV) and significantly lower than that of the surrounding intracluster medium
(kT ∼keV). The soft X-ray emission of the tail comes from the mixing of cold ISM with the
hot intracluster medium. Diffuse Hα is associated with the X-ray tail. Close to the galactic disk
(<20 kpc), Sivanandam et al. (2010) detected .× M⊙of shocked, warm molecular hydro-
gen. An important number of Hii regions are detected near or close to the X-ray tail up to a
projected distance of ∼40 kpc from the galactic disk. Thus, star formation proceeds in situ in the
stripped material. The imprint of galactic rotation is still present in the velocity map of these
Hii regions. It seems that the gas turbulence in the stripped gas tail did not greatly enhance the
velocities of the extraplanar Hii regions.
A second 40-kpc-long X-ray tail has been detected behind another late-type galaxy,
ESO 137-002 (Sun et al. 2010). Signature of gas stripping were also found in the Hα data,
with a sharp Hα edge and an Hα tail extending to at least 20 kpc from the galactic nucleus.
No Hii regions are found in this tail. The X-ray morphology points to a more edge-on
stripping.

Abell 1367
The only disk galaxies with a long one-sided radio continuum tail are CGCG 97-073 and
CGCG 97 079 in the galaxy cluster Abell 1367 (Gavazzi et al. 1995). Faint Hα emission is associ-
ated with these tails. The sizes of the tails are 50–75 kpc. The Hi distributions of the two galaxies
are offset from the galaxy centers in the direction coincident with the radio continuum tails
(Dickey and Gavazzi 1991). All observations are consistent with a scenario where both galaxies
are undergoing ram pressure stripping. The two galaxies are located at the periphery of a sub-
cluster merging with the main cluster. The X-ray morphology of Abell 1367 is similar to that
of the Norma cluster. The intracluster medium associated with the subcluster is significantly
hotter than that of the main cluster. Another galaxy in this region, UGC 6697, has an X-ray
tail and a sharp edge in the X-ray distribution at the opposite side (Sun and Vikhlinin 2005).
Since Gavazzi et al. (2001) proposed a scenario where UGC 6697 is composed of two interact-
ing galaxies and the system shows a prominent stellar tail, a tidal interaction and ram pressure
stripping most probably act together.
Virgo Cluster
In the Hi imaging survey of Virgo galaxies (VIVA: VLA Imaging of Virgo galaxies in Atomic
gas), Chung et al. (2007) found seven spiral galaxies with long Hi tails (>Fig. 5-14). These tail
galaxies have the following properties in common in the Hi morphology: (i) the Hi is extended
well beyond the optical disk only on one side; (ii) the tails differ from tidal bridges; i.e., there is
no optical counterpart at the tip of the tail down to r ∼26 mag arcsec−in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) images; and (iii) the projected length of the gas tail is larger than half of the sym-
metric part in Hi. These galaxies are found in intermediate- to low-density regions (.–Mpc
in projection from M 87). The tails are all pointing roughly away from M 87. At least three sys-
tems show Hi truncation to within the stellar disk, providing evidence of a gas–gas interaction.
A comparison between the estimated (based on (> 5.2)) and observed stripping radii suggests
that simple ram pressure stripping could have indeed formed the tails in all but two cases. One
of these cases is NGC 4654 where ram pressure stripping is facilitated by a tidal interaction (see
below). The Hi observations of this spiral galaxy sample represents evidence that ram pressure
stripping already begins to affect spiral galaxies around the cluster virial radius. At least % of
the large spiral galaxies in the region between .and Mpc from the Virgo cluster center seem
to be recent arrivals being stripped of gas.
There are four cases of a mixed interaction, i.e., the combination between a tidal interac-
tion and ram pressure stripping, in the Virgo cluster: NGC 4424, NGC 4654, NGC 4254, and
NGC 4438. In the following their properties are described in detail. Other galaxies affected by
ram pressure stripping are described in >Sect. 8.3.
The broadband optical appearance of NGC 4424 is peculiar, with shell-like features and
banana-shaped isophotes, suggesting a major gravitational disturbance or a merger (Kenney
et al. 1996). This galaxy has extremely modest stellar rotation velocities (∼30 km s−), and stars
are supported by random motions as far out as it can be measured (.kpc). The ionized gas
kinematics in the core are disturbed and possibly counterrotating. Cortése et al. (2006) sug-
gested that the peculiarities of NGC 4424 are the result of an intermediate-mass merger plus
ram pressure stripping which created the long one-sided Hi tail detected by Chung et al. (2007).
The spiral galaxy NGC 4654 is located at a projected distance of .○∼Mpc from the
cluster center (> Fig. 5-5). It is one of the galaxies with a long one-sided Hi tail of Chung
et al. (2007). The velocity field of the tail does not show rotation (> Fig. 5-15). This galaxy

also shows an asymmetric stellar distribution. Numerical simulations using ram pressure as
the only perturbation can produce a tail structure of the gas content but cannot account for its
kinematical structure. Simulations using a gravitational interaction with the companion galaxy
NGC 4639 can account for the asymmetric stellar distribution of NGC 4654 but cannot repro-
duce the observed extended gas tail. Only a mixed interaction, gravitational and ram pressure,
can reproduce all observed properties of NGC 4654 (Vollmer 2003; >Fig. 5-15). The tidal inter-
action loosened the gas from the galaxy’s gravitational potential. Only a small amount of ram
pressure, about /of the ram pressure estimated using ( > 5.2), is necessary to produce the
observed Hi tail.
The spiral galaxy NGC 4254 is located at the same projected distance as NGC 4654 (∼1 Mpc)
on the other side of the Virgo cluster. The spiral structure of NGC 4254 shows an important
m = 1 mode, giving it a one-armed appearance. Deep VLA Hi observations (Phookun et al.
1993) revealed, in addition to the galactic Hi disk component, Hi clouds superposed on and
beyond the gas disk with velocities that do not follow the disk rotation pattern. Very low surface
density atomic gas is found up to ∼6′ (∼30 kpc) to the north-west of the galaxy center. Subse-
quent WSRT (Minchin et al. 2007) and Arecibo (Haynes et al. 2008) Hi observations revealed
the longest low surface density gas tail ever observed with a length of ∼250 kpc (> Fig. 5-16).
This tail structure could be reproduced by a rapid (∼1,000 km s−) and close (∼60 kpc) flyby of
a massive galaxy (1.5 times the mass of NGC 4254) by Duc and Bournaud (2008). The smooth
velocity field with a reversal of the gradient in the middle of the tail is a natural result of the
dynamical model (> Fig. 5-16). As in NGC 4654, ram pressure might act on the gas loosened
by the gravitational interaction (Vollmer et al. 2005a; Kantharia et al. 2008).
NGC 4438 has the most spectacular tidal tails in the Virgo cluster (>Fig. 5-1). It is located
at a projected distance of only ○= kpc from the cluster center (M 87). Despite the strong
tidal perturbation, ram pressure is the dominant effect on the observed gas distribution and
kinematics (Vollmer et al. 2005b). A double line profile is observed in CO(2–1) observations.
As in the Coma spiral galaxy NGC 4848, one CO line is due to galactic rotation, whereas the
second CO line is most probably due to gas pushed by ram pressure. Recent deep Hα obser-
vations of the M 86 region (> Fig. 5-17; Kenney et al. 2008) revealed a highly complex and
disturbed interstellar/intraclustermedium. NGC 4438 is connected to M 86 by several faint Hα
filaments, which suggests a tidal interaction between the two galaxies, as advocated by Kenney
et al. (2008). The timescale and the relative galaxy velocities of the two scenarios (encounter
with M 86 or NGC 4435) are about the same. The discovery of an ∼190-Myr-old starburst in
NGC 4435 by Panuzzo et al. (2007) favors the interaction scenario between NGC 4438 and
NGC 4435. Together with NGC 4522 (see below), NGC 4438 is the second galaxy which is
undergoing strong ram pressure stripping at a location in the Virgo clusterwhere this would not
be expected from a classical model assuming a spherical, smooth, and static Virgo intracluster
medium distribution.
8.2.3 Dwarf Galaxies
Two examples of low-mass irregular galaxies, which have undergone recent ram pressure strip-
ping, were found in the Virgo and Coma cluster. RB 199 is a post-starburst dwarf galaxy with
a stellar mass of a few M⊙in the Coma cluster. Yoshida et al. (2008) found a complex of
narrow blue filaments, bright blue knots, and Hα-emitting filaments and clouds, which mor-
phologically resembled a complex of “fireballs,” extending up to 80 kpc from RB 199. This galaxy

has a highly disturbed morphology indicative of a galaxy–galaxy merger remnant (left panel
of >Fig. 5-18). The optical colors of the filaments and knots suggest that most of the stars in
the fireballs were formed within several times 100 Myr.
The optical morphology of the Virgo cluster dwarf irregular galaxy IC 3428 (M∗∼M⊙)
resembles that of RB 199. Hester et al. (2010) found a 17-kpc UV tail of bright knots and diffuse
emission behind the galaxy IC 3418 (right panel of >Fig. 5-18). Hα imaging confirmed that
star formation is ongoing in the tail. The stripped gas thus vigorously formed and still forms
stars over the last few Myr. This is in contrast to the low star formation rate in stripped gas
tails of late-type galaxies (e.g., Vollmer et al. 2008).
8.3 A Holistic View on Ram Pressure Stripping
A first complete ram pressure stripping time sequence was established by Vollmer
(2009; >Fig. 5-19). He combined the results of detailed comparisons between dynamical mod-
els and observations of the interstellar medium in ram pressure stripped galaxies in the Virgo
cluster. According to his analysis, it is possible to observe ram pressure-induced perturbations

∼300 Myr around the galaxy’s closest approach to the cluster center, i.e., when peak ram pres-
sure occurs if a spherical, smooth, and static intracluster medium distribution is assumed. The
relative brevity of this period compared to the galaxy’s orbital timescale (several Gyr) explains
the rareness (∼15%) of observed ram pressure-induced perturbations in Virgo spiral galaxies.
Observationally, the different stages of ram pressure stripping can be recognized in the
following way:
•
Increasing, moderately strong ram pressure (>50 Myr before peak, class (i)):
moderately truncated Hi disk, extraplanar gas of moderate surface density, continuous
velocity field between the disk and the extraplanar region, radio-deficient region, and/or
ridge of polarized radio continuum emission at the outer gas disk opposite to the extraplanar
region, for example, NGC 4501, NGC 4330.
•
Ongoing strong ram pressure (near peak, class (ii)):
strongly truncated Hi disk, extraplanar gas of high surface density, continuous velocity
field between the disk and the extraplanar region, radio-deficient region, and/or ridge of

thus in a stage of pre-peak ram pressure (class (i)). NGC 4522 (gray scale: HI, contour: polarized radio continuum emission; Kenney et al. 2004; Vollmer et al.

density; contour: stellar distribution; Vollmer and Huchtmeier 2003) and NGC 4569 (class (iv); gray scale and contours: HI; Vollmer et al. 2004a) are leaving
the cluster center (From Vollmer 2009)

polarized radio continuum emission at the outer gas disk opposite to the extraplanar region,
for example, NGC 4438, NGC 4522.
•
Decreasing ram pressure (<200 Myr after peak, class (iii)):
strongly truncated Hi disk, extended extraplanar gas of low surface density, continuous
velocity field between the disk and the extraplanar region, and ridge of polarized radio
continuum emission at the outer gas disk opposite to the extraplanar region, for example,
NGC 4388.
•
Decreasing ram pressure (>200 Myr after peak, class (iv)):
strongly truncated Hi disk, perturbed outer gas arms, discontinuous velocity field between
the disk and the extraplanarregion, ridge ofpolarized radiocontinuum emission at the outer
gas disk opposite to the extraplanar region, and possible ridge of polarized radio continuum
emission at the outer gas disk due to shear motions from the resettling gas, for example,
NGC 4569.
The dynamical models yield the 3D velocity vector of the galaxies, the peak ram pressures,
and the times to peak ram pressure. In the case of a smooth, static, and spherical intracluster
medium, peak ram pressure occurs during the galaxy’s closest approach to the cluster center, i.e.,
when the galaxy’s velocity vector is perpendicular to its distance vector. Underthese conditions,
the galaxy’s present line-of-sight distance and its 3D position during peak ram pressure can
be calculated. The linear orbital segments derived in this way together with the intracluster
medium density distribution from Schindler et al. (1999) are consistent within a factor of 2 with
the dynamical simulations for NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569. The impact parameters
of the galaxy orbits vary between kpc and kpc.
The analysis of multiwavelength photometry and optical spectra of the gas-free outer
regions of the galactic disks allow to derive the time since star formation has been quenched
by gas removal via ram pressure stripping. Boselli et al. (2006) used multiband photometry and
stellar population modeling to constrain the quenching time. Crowl and Kenney (2008) ana-
lyzed the stellar populations in these outer disks of 10 Virgo cluster spiral galaxies, using integral
field spectroscopy and UV photometry. All of the galaxies with spatially truncated star forma-
tion have outer-disk stellar populations consistent with star formation ending within the last
500 Myr. For approximately half of the galaxies, the truncation ages are consistent with galaxies
being stripped in or near the cluster core, where simple ram pressure estimates can explain the
observed stripping radius. However, the other half of the galaxies were clearly stripped outside
the cluster core. Pappalardo et al. (2010) refined the truncation age determination for NGC 4388
using a nonparametric inversion tool to reconstruct the star formation history of a galaxy from
deep VLT spectroscopy and multiband photometry. For all three galaxies where star formation
truncation ages based on dynamical models exist (NGC 4569, NGC 4388, NGC 4522), they
agree with the timescales derived from spectrophotometry.
Finally, the small edge-on galaxy NGC 4522 (>Fig. 5-2) deserves special attention. Its gas
disk is strongly truncated and extraplanar high column density gas is present (> Fig. 5-2).
Dynamical modeling, the presence of an asymmetric ridge of polarized emission (Vollmer et al.
2004b), and the analysis of the optical spectrum of the gas-free outer disk (Crowl and Kenney
2008) infer strong ongoing ram pressure stripping. However, the galaxy is located at a projected
distance of .○∼Mpc from the cluster center. Assuming a smooth and static intracluster
medium, the calculated ram pressure at this location ( > 5.2) appears inadequate by an order
of magnitude to cause the observed stripping. The most probable scenario is a dynamic, shock-
filled intracluster medium with bulk motions and local density enhancements associated with

The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution 5

the galaxy group around the elliptical galaxy M 49, which falls into the Virgo cluster from the
south. Together with NGC 4438 (see >Sect. 8.2.2), NGC 4522 represents a second galaxy which
is not classically stripped in the core of the Virgo cluster.
8.3.1 The Response of the Multiphase ISM and Star Formation to Ram
Pressure
As described in >Sect. 5, the interstellar medium consists of different phases. The warm neu-
tral phase is observable in Hi line emission and the molecular phase in CO line emission. Hα
emission traces the dense warm ionized medium (diffuse gas or Hii regions) and diffuse X-ray
emission the hot ionized gas phase. In addition, synchrotron emission from cosmic ray gas and
the magnetic field is detected in the radio continuum.
Tidal interactions act in the same way on all gas phases and on the stellar component. Ram
pressure only affects the ISM. The acceleration of gas clumps by ram pressure depends on their
surface density,

(5.11)
where pramp is the ram pressure, ρICM the intracluster medium density, vgal the galaxy veloc-
ity with respect to the intracluster medium, and ΣISM the ISM surface density. Clouds with
higher surface densities are thus less affected by ram pressure than clouds with low surface den-
sities. There is evidence that this is actually the case. The edge-on Virgo spiral galaxy NGC 4402
(> Fig. 5-20) shows signs of ongoing ram pressure stripping (Crowl et al. 2005): the Hi disk
is strongly truncated and a short Hi tail is observed. Moreover, the radio continuum halo is
compressed on one side of the galactic disk. Deep optical images show a remarkable dust lane
morphology: at half the optical radius, the dust lane of the galaxy curves up and out of the
disk. On the leading eastern edge of the interaction, the Hi contours appear to cut off inside the
dust distribution, suggesting that the less dense gas in this part of the galaxy has already been
stripped. To the south of the galactic disk, where the galaxy is relatively clean of gas and dust,
there are 1-kpc-long linear dust filaments with a position angle that matches the shape of the
radio continuum halo. One of the observed dust filaments has an Hii region at its head. These
dust filaments are interpreted as large, dense clouds that were initially left behind as the low-
density interstellar medium was stripped but were then ablated by the ram pressure wind. The
same phenomenon of massive dense molecular clouds which decouple from the ram pressure
wind is observed in NGC 4522 and NGC 4438. Both galaxies undergo strong active ram pres-
sure stripping. In both galaxies, small amounts of molecular gas (∼M⊙) with very narrow
linewidths are observed in Hi-free regions where the bulk of the gas has been removed by ram
pressure: in the northern tail of NGC 4438 (Vollmer et al. 2005b) and in NGC 4522 beyond
the gas truncation radius (Vollmer et al. 2008). There is one indication that the diffuse warm
ionized gas is stripped more efficiently than molecular gas: in the region where extraplanar gas
is detected in NGC 4438, the radial velocities of the diffuse Hα emission are significantly offset
from (Δv ≥km s−), whereas the velocities of the Hii regions follow those of the molecular
gas (Vollmer et al. 2009).
The evidence of extraplanar star formation is rare in ram pressure stripped Virgo
spiral galaxies. Some extraplanar Hii regions are detected in Virgo spiral galaxies with
Hi tails: NGC 4402 (Cortése et al. 2004), NGC 4438 (Kenney et al. 1995), NGC 4388

Based on their dynamical model, Vollmer et al. (2008) suggested the following ram pressure
stripping scenario: a significant part of the gas is stripped in the form of overdense armlike
structures. Molecules and stars form within this dense gas according to the same laws as in

the galactic disk, i.e., they mainly depend on the total large-scale gas density. Star formation
proceeds where the local large-scale gas density is highest. In the absence of a confining grav-
itational potential, the stripped gas arms will most probably disperse; i.e., the density of the
gas will decrease and star formation will cease. This might have happened in NGC 4330 where
Abramson et al. (2011) discovered an offset between the UV and Hi tails (>Fig. 5-21). This off-
set can be explained with the following scenario: since collapsing and star-forming gas clouds
decouple from the ram pressure wind, the UV-emitting young stars have the angular momen-
tum of the gas at the time of their creation. On the other hand, the gas is constantly pushed by
ram pressure and its density decreases. At a certain density threshold, star formation ceases in
the displaced gas. The observed gas tails has a very low present star formation efficiency. The
UV emission indicates that the past star formation efficiency (∼100 Myr) was much higher.

The Detailed Picture
It is difficult to find cluster spiral galaxies with clear signs of ongoing ram pressure stripping
and unambiguous examples are rare. The signposts of ram pressure stripping are (i) a symmet-
ric old stellar disk together with a gas disk truncated inside the optical radius, (ii) a one-sided gas
tail, and (iii) a radio-deficient region and/or an asymmetric polarized radio continuum ridge
located in the outer gas disk opposite to the gas tail. In the absence of a long gas tail, it is easier to
recognize extraplanar gas in edge-on galaxies. Therefore, we are somewhat biased against this
particular projection. Although the distortions of the gas distribution can be quite dramatic,
the gas velocity field is still smooth and regular. In the Virgo cluster, these asymmetries can be
observed during ∼300 Myr, compared to an orbital timescale of a few Gyr. This partly explains
the rareness of published cases with ongoing ram pressure stripping. In the classical picture,

254 5
The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution
a galaxy approaches the cluster center on a highly eccentric orbit. The intracluster medium is
in hydrostatic equilibrium and does not move. Ram pressure stripping thus occurs close to the
cluster core when ( > 5.2) is fulfilled. The distance from the cluster center where a significant
amount of gas is removed from the galaxy depends on the radial distribution of intracluster
medium which can be very different from cluster to cluster (e.g., Virgo and Coma). We have
learned from the Virgo spiral galaxy NGC 4522 that ram pressure stripping can occur far away
from the cluster center in regions where classical ram pressure by a static intracluster medium
is insufficient. The explanation is that the intracluster medium is moving at a high speed in
the opposite direction of the galaxy’s motion. Since ram pressure depends on the square of the
intracluster medium velocity with respect to galaxy, this can dramatically enhance ram pres-
sure. Thus, whenever the intergalactic medium of a subcluster or galaxy group collides with the
intracluster medium of the main cluster during a cluster–subcluster or a cluster–group merger,
ram pressure stripping can occur at the cluster periphery provided that there are galaxies which
move against the direction of the infalling intergalactic medium.
The detailed comparison between dynamical models and gas distributions and velocity
fields of Virgo spiral galaxies showed that the Gunn and Gott critrion ( > 5.2) is valid within
a factor of 2 (Vollmer 2009). The models of different types (3D hydro, SPH, sticky particles)
agree in this respect (see > Sect. 4). It is not enough to reproduce the observed gas distri-
bution, because the results can be ambiguous. The observed gas velocity field adds important
constraints for the modeling. The motions in the plane of the sky can be probed via the polarized
radio continuum emission which is sensitive to compression and shear. The main ingredients
of ram pressure stripping are (i) ram pressure; (ii) galactic rotation; (iii) gas shadowing, i.e.,
gas on the windward side can shadow gas located on the downwind side; and (iv) for long gas
tails intracluster medium – ISM mixing. Mixing requires Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities and
can thus only be simulated by 3D Eulerian hydrodynamics.
Most of the gas tails are observed in Hi and only a few in X-rays, Hα, and radio contin-
uum emission. Unfortunately, there is only one simultaneous detection of a gas tail in Hi and
X-rays, NGC 4848 in the Coma cluster. Why do some tails are X-ray bright and form more stars
(ESO 137-001 in Abell 3627) than others (NGC 4388 in Virgo) which are fainter in X-rays?
Tonnesen et al. (2011) suggested that the primary requirement is a high-pressure intracluster
medium. This is because the stripped tail is mostly in pressure equilibrium with the intracluster
medium, but mixing leaves it with densities and temperatures intermediate between the cold
gas in the disk and the hot intracluster medium. Given a high enough intracluster medium
pressure, the mixed gas lies in the X-ray bright region of the phase diagram. This suggestion is
consistent with the higher intracluster medium temperature and thus pressure of Abell 3627.
This also explains why the X-ray bight tail of ESO 137-001 shows diffuse Hα emission.
The work on NGC 4522 and NGC 4330 suggests that the gas is stripped in an arm struc-
ture with high densities. As long as the gas is of high density, it forms stars. Once the gas is
pushed out of the galactic disk, the gravitational confinement vanishes and the bulk of the gas
expands and is mixed into the tenuous hot intracluster medium. Since the stripping timescale
is long compared to the lifetime of a molecular cloud, the ISM is stripped as an entity. Only the
largest molecular cloud complexes might decouple from the ram pressure wind and stay behind
(NGC 4522, > Fig. 5-2; NGC 4402, > Fig. 5-20, NGC 4438 in the Virgo cluster). There are
indications for a modest enhancement of the star formation rate per surface area in NGC 4522
(Crowl and Kenney 2006). At the same time, the total star formation rate of the galaxy is reduced
because of the truncation of the gas and star-forming disk. Thus, whereas the local star forma-
tion rate can be enhanced up to a factor of a few during a ram pressure stripping event, the total
star formation rate decreases in most cases.

255
The gas stripping of gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies proceeds in a different way. The star
formation efficiency of the stripped gas is higher leading to stellar tails which are observable in
the UV and optical domain (RB 199 in Coma and IC 3418 in Virgo).
Gravitational interactions, like close flybys of massive galaxies, can loosen the gas
from the galaxy’s gravitational potential, making ram pressure stripping more efficient
(NGC 4654,
> Fig. 5-15; NGC 4438 in the Virgo cluster). In an extreme case, a gravita-
tional interaction might even be responsible for a -kpc gas tail (NGC 4254 in the Virgo
cluster; >Fig. 5-16).
The end-product of ram pressure stripping are spiral galaxies with a truncated gas and
star-forming disk. These stripped late-type galaxies can easily be misclassified as early-type spi-
rals (Koopmann and Kenney 1998). Star formation will then consume the gas, the gas surface
density and star formation rate will decrease, and the galaxy will become passive or anemic
(NGC 4548, NGC 4579, NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster). After the stripping, the outer gas-
free disk has a post-starburst spectrum with strong Balmer absorption lines and no significant
emission from ongoing star formation (Crowl and Kenney 2006).
For the transformation of the spiral galaxies into lenticulars, a morphological transforma-
tion leading to larger bulges seems to be necessary as discussed in >Sect. 7. Tidal interactions
are the prime candidate for this transformation which happened either via slow encounters
in a group environment before infall into the galaxy cluster or via harassment or single close
flybys of massive galaxies in the cluster environment. An example for an ongoing spiral–S0
transformation at the cluster periphery is the Virgo cluster galaxy NGC 4438. A single grav-
itational interaction leads to important stellar tidal tails (> Fig. 5-17). Once the galaxy has
passed the cluster core, these tails will be stripped by the gravitational potential of the clus-
ter and NGC 4438 will resemble an S0 galaxy. The tidally stripped stars will contribute to the
diffuse intracluster light (see, e.g., Mihos et al. 2005).

A Local View on the Butcher–Oemler Eﬀect
Butcher and Oemler (1984) were the first to report an increasing fraction of blue galaxies in 33
rich galaxy clusters out to a redshift of z ∼., Subsequent studies showed similar trends for the
star formation rate (e.g., Balogh et al. 1999; Poggianti et al. 2006) and galaxy morphology (e.g.,
Dressler et al. 1997; Treu et al. 2003), or spectral properties (Ellingson et al. 2001). The frac-
tion of blue spirals is determined by the cluster richness and redshift (Margoniner et al. 2001).
This global effect can be understood in a scenario where the rate of field galaxy infall onto clus-
ters decreases with decreasing redshift (Kauffmann 1995; Abraham et al. 1996; Ellingson et al.
2001). Since the mean cluster mass increases with decreasing redshift, the specific infall rate per
unit cluster mass decreases at an even faster rate. Furthermore, because of the sharply declining
global star formation rate as a function of decreasing redshift (Hopkins and Beacom 2006), field
galaxies form on average more stars and are bluer at higher redshifts. A more detailed view of
the Butcher–Oemler effect is that of a significant evolution in the fractional population gradi-
ent of early- and late-type galaxies (Ellingson et al. 2001). Both low- and high-redshift clusters
have similar populations in the cluster cores, but higher redshift clusters have steeper gradi-
ents and more star-forming galaxies at radii outside of the core region. The blue galaxy fraction
at a given redshift depends on cluster mass (richness, Margoniner et al. 2001; X-ray tempera-
ture Urquhart et al. 2010), but its gradient with respect to redshift is approximatelly the same
for all clusters (Margoniner et al. 2001). The Buther–Oemler effect thus has an environmental

256 5
The Inﬂuence of Environment on Galaxy Evolution
and a cosmological component. The main effect of the cluster environment is to quench star
formation of the infalling galaxies, and more massive galaxy clusters are more efficient in stop-
ping the star formation of their galaxies. The cause of the environmental component of the
Butcher–Oemler effect (ram pressure stripping or tidal interactions) has still to be determined.
It is well possible that both effects are equally needed. The local view of the cosmological com-
ponent of the Butcher–Oemler effect is that the fraction of dynamically young clusters as the
Virgo, Abell 1367, and Norma clusters with a high infall rate of blue field galaxies increases with
redshift.
The studies of local galaxy clusters teach us that cluster environments can be very different.
In a tentative sequence for clusterevolution, a galaxy cluster begins as a Fornax-like cluster with
a high fraction of healthy spirals and a small amount of hot intracluster medium peaking on
the central luminous galaxy. In this environment, gravitational interactions dominate and ram
pressure stripping does not play a role for galaxy evolution within the cluster. When impor-
tant groups of galaxies fall into the cluster, it will look like the Virgo cluster with a spiral-rich
galaxydistribution which shows a lot ofsubstructure. Ifthe infalling groups contain a significant
amount of hot intragroup gas, the intracluster–intragroup gas merging will heat the intraclus-
ter medium and lead to important bulk motions. In these highly dynamic environment with
increasing intracluster medium mass, ram pressure becomes more and more efficient. Ram
pressure typically begins to affect the galaxies’ outer gas disks inside the cluster’s Virial radius.
The clustercentric distance from which ram pressure significantly reduces the galaxies’ gas and
star-forming disks dependson (i) the central density and core radius of the intraclustermedium
distribution and (ii) the intracluster medium bulk motions. Only galaxies on eccentric orbits,
leading them deeply into the cluster core or galaxies flying against bulk motions will be stripped
efficiently. The gas stripping is then quasi-instantaneous. For the other galaxies on less eccentric
orbits close flybys of massive perturbers can loosen the gas in the outer parts of the disk which
can then be stripped by a relatively small amount of ram pressure. The timescale for this mixed
interaction is longer and depends on the probability of a close gravitational interaction. Galaxy
harassment, or multiple close flybys, mainly changes the morphology of low-mass galaxies. In
addition, spiral galaxies consume their gas via star formation without a supply of fresh gas. The
galaxy cluster grows steadily in this way.
If another smaller galaxy cluster with a significant amount of intracluster gas hits the main
cluster, the intracluster medium temperature and bulk motions increase. With increasing mass
and temperature of the intracluster medium, its central density and core radius increase (Jones
and Forman 1999; Schindler et al. 1999). We then have a cluster-like the Norma or Abell 1367
clusters where ram pressure stripping is enhanced in the gas merger region. When the intr-
acluster medium is relaxed again, the cluster will look like the Coma cluster. Through the
dynamical buildup of the intracluster medium, ram pressure becomes more and more impor-
tant for the evolution of the star formation of cluster galaxies. Ram pressure stripped spirals
consume the residual gas and the spiral galaxy becomes passive or anemic. The end products
might be relatively faint lenticular galaxies.
Global morphological transformation of spiral galaxies into lenticulars within the cluster
environment certainly needs important tidal interactions. It should not be forgotten that some
galaxies are already preprocessed within infalling groups, where they have already lost a fraction
of their ISM and might have changed morphology. The formation of lenticular galaxies is thus
a heterogeneous process which acts in group and cluster environments (see also Moran et al.
2007; van den Bergh 2009).

Conclusions and Outlook
We have seen that the environment modifies the properties of a galaxy. The primary effects
are gas removal, quenching of star formation, and a possible morphological transformation.
Those galaxies that live in a group undergo predominantly slow tidal interactions with other
galaxies. Because of their high galaxy density, compact groups show dramatic tidal tails and
galaxy mergers. In rare cases, ram pressure can play a role, if a galaxy flys through a gaseous
tidal tail or if the group contains a considerable amount of intragroup gas. The end product of a
galaxy merger is a lenticular or elliptical galaxy. Tidal interactions will drive the ISM of the inner
disk into the galaxy center and loosen the ISM of the outer disk. Star formation then consumes
the ISM in the galactic disk. In this way, some group galaxies can become Hi deficient and/or
undergo morphological transformation.
A significant fraction of galaxies are preprocessed in a group environment before falling
into a cluster. In galaxy clusters, tidal interactions are fast and numerous (galaxy harassment).
These interactions will mainly modify the morphology of low-mass galaxies. If the intracluster
gas mass is high and the core radius of its distribution is large, or if the intracluster medium is
moving due to a cluster–cluster merger, ram pressure stripping becomes an important agent of
galaxy evolution. Ram pressure stripping is most efficient for galaxies on highly eccentric orbits
and for galaxies moving against bulk motions of the intracluster gas. The galaxies’ ISM is then
removed instantaneously according to the Gunn and Gott criterion ( > 5.2), and the galaxies
become Hi deficient. There is now evidence in local galaxy clusters where and how ram pres-
sure acts on a spiral galaxy. Tidal interactions and ram pressure stripping can act simultaneously,
enhancing the ISM removal. These mixed interactions occur preferentially at the clusterperiph-
ery (≥1 Mpc). Signs of ram pressure stripping can be detected up to about one virial radius of
the cluster. The time window, in which we can unambiguously identify the effects of ram pres-
sure stripping, is small compared to the orbital period. Therefore, it is not easy to find these
galaxies in a cluster. Large imaging Hi surveys are particular useful to identify ram pressure
stripping candidates. Polarized radio continuum observations can be used to verify the ram
pressure stripping hypothesis. The physics of the interaction can then be studied by multiwave-
length observations from the X-ray to radio domain. For a limited sample of galaxies, it is now
possible to constrain their 3D orbits and interaction histories within the cluster. We are now
at the point where we can study the reaction (phase change, star formation) of the multiphase
ISM (molecular, atomic, ionized) to ram pressure.
For the moment, detailed interaction diagnostics are limited to local galaxy clusters where
the resolution of current telescopes is sufficiently high. The Hi imaging resolution for Coma
galaxies is already too coarse to permit detailed modeling. Furthermore, the most distant galaxy
clusters where galaxies could be detected (not resolved) in Hi emission are at z = .(Abell 963,
Abell 2192; Verheijen et al. 2007). The main obstacles to observing Hi in distant galaxies are
the necessarily long integration times and man-made interference outside the protected 21-cm
band. The square kilometer array (SKA) will entirely change this situation, allowing us detailed
Hi line and radio continuum imaging of cluster galaxies in local clusters beyond Virgo and
giving us access to the gas content of galaxies at higher redshifts. With ALMA, it will be pos-
sible to study the reaction of the dense gas phase to ram pressure stripping (the decoupling
of giant molecular clouds from the ram pressure wind) and investigate the total molecular gas
content of spiral galaxies in clusters beyond the local universe. LOFAR will give us access to
the population of older cosmic ray electrons. This will greatly increase our knowledge on the

258 5

effects of ram pressure stripping on the cosmic ray gas. The Herschel satellite has already and
will improve our understanding of the role of dust in environmental interactions. The road to a
better understanding of environmental effects on galaxy evolution is thus lined with beautiful
upcoming instruments.

Abstract:
This chapter focuses on galaxy clusters, tackling three aspects. Firstly, we look at
clustersas laboratories, where we can study galaxy evolution and the interaction of galaxies with
their environment. By measuring the properties of galaxies in clusters as a function of redshift,
we can build a statistical history of galaxy formation and test this against theoretical models.
Secondly, we look at the diffuse intra-cluster medium (ICM) that pervades galaxy clusters. This
plasma makes accounts for the vast majority of baryons in the cluster. X-ray emission from the
plasma can be used to measurethe gravitational potential and to trace the thermal history of the
universe. Finally, we look at clusters as probes of cosmology and their role in complementing
the cosmic microwave background in constraining cosmological parameters.

Introduction
1.1 What Is a Cluster?
What is a cluster? Clusters are self-gravitating systems of galaxies, hot gas, and dark matter.
By convention, they have typical masses of –M⊙and contain 100s–1,000s of galax-
ies. We distinguish clusters by their mass. They are the most massive collapsed objects in the
present-day universe. Clusters are rare, and even the least massive have a space density less than
−Mpc−. The most massive examples have a space density of ∼−Mpc−in the local uni-
verse. The space density declines rapidly to higher redshifts. Our nearest rich cluster, the Coma
cluster, is a good example of fairly typical galaxy cluster (see > Fig. 6-1). Its close proximity
makes it possible to study the galaxy properties in great detail.
We often refer to lower mass (and more common) systems with masses in the range
M⊙> Mtot > M⊙as galaxy groups. There is no strict definition of the mass limits,
however, and some authors would include the systems containing two bright galaxies (e.g., the
MilkyWayand Andromeda)as “groups.” Manypapers alsoreferto“field” galaxies. Such galaxies
are really average galaxies drawn from random locations in the universe. Consequently, some
field galaxies might well lie in groups, while clusters are too rare to be represented. It is perhaps
better to refer to “isolated” galaxies if we want to contrast the properties of galaxies inside and
outside groups.
Our modern understanding is that clusters form as the result of gravitational instability.
They are the result of small density fluctuations in the post-inflation universe. The gravitational
instability creates a whole spectrum of virialized (i.e., stable) dark matterhaloes. As the universe
evolves, the characteristic halo mass moves to larger and larger scales. Clusters are the most
massive of these haloes and exponentially rare in the present-day universe. They will become
increasingly common in the future, until the acceleration driven by dark energy eventually halts
development of cosmic structure.
1.2 Historical Perspective
It is helpful to begin with a brief review of the long history of galaxy cluster studies. Almost
as soon as the first astronomical telescopes were developed, clusters were identified as striking
concentrations of galaxies on the sky. The discovery predated the realization that the “spiral

268 6

With a mass of 2 × 1015 M⊙, the Coma cluster is our nearest large cluster. It lies at a distance of
100 Mpc. The image shows the central regions of the cluster and is annotated with some of the
brighter galaxies catalogued by early astronomers. The cluster is often used as the archetypal
cluster. Nevertheless, the cluster may have resulted from a recent merger of two smaller systems
resulting in the two dominant galaxies, NGC 4884 and NGC 4874 (Image credit: NASA/DXS)
nebulae” were outside our own galaxies. A clear division in galaxy properties was already evi-
dent in these observations, and it was immediately evident that most galaxies in clusters were
amorphous systems, devoid of spiral arms. This density–morphology relation has been the
motivation of a great deal of “ecological” research over past decades. The central questions have
morphed into a consideration of the star formation histories of galaxies, but the issues are still
the same.
The development of spectrographs allowed the redshifts (and hence relative velocities) of
galaxies to be measured. This lead to an apparent contradiction: if clusters were bound, the
mass associated with each of the galaxies must greatly exceed the visible stellar mass. Zwicky
had discovered the existence of dark matter. Of course, these observations do not make it clear
that the dark matter is non-baryonic. The discovery of the hot gas in clusters had to wait until
the development of X-ray balloon observations. The discovery of bright X-ray emission was a
great surprise, but it was quickly realized that the mass of hot gas trapped by the gravitational
potential greatly exceeded that in visible stars.

This image shows the cluster MS0735.6+ 7421 (McNamara et al. 2005) and superposes the optical
(yellow), X-ray (blue), and radio (emission). The jet of radio emission from the central galaxy has
swept aside the intra-cluster medium creating a cavity in the X-ray-emitting plasma. Such events
are hugely energetic and are thought to balance the radiative cooling of the intra-cluster medium
(Image credit: NASA/CXC/SAO)
The discovery of hot gas, however, leads to a new puzzle. The luminosity implied a high
cooling rate. Surely, this cooling gas must go somewhere, and surely, it must lead to the for-
mation of stars. The “cooling flow” paradox was born. A paradox because the cooling rates
seemed incompatible with the red colors and low rates of star formation in cluster galaxies.
Some authors suggested that the gas might form rocks or invisible low-mass stars, but resolution
would have to wait for the vastly improved image quality and spectroscopic energy resolution
of X-ray satellites.
A key piece of the puzzle is the frequent association of “radio galaxies” with clusters. Such
galaxies have strong radio emission, frequently in the form of jets generated by accretion onto
a central black hole. An example is shown in >Fig. 6-2. Thus, the story of galaxy clusters links
the collapse of dark matter on cosmological (100 Mpc or m) scales to the accretion physics
on the scale of the black hole horizon (scales of m).
More recently, gravitational lensing has provided overwhelming evidence of the existence
of dark matter. Although the bending of light was an early prediction of general relativity, it was

of background galaxies. The source is strongly magniﬁed making, it possible to exploit the cluster

shapes of background objects across the entire ﬁeld. Inverting this distortion provides a means of
directly measuring the cluster’s mass (Image credit: NASA/HST)
not widely appreciated that clusters were so massive that they would easily bend light from
background objects into spectacular giant arcs. Initial explanations suggested that these were
galaxies being ripped apart by the tidal forces of the cluster, but spectroscopy clearly showed
them to be objects at much greater distance than the cluster. Spectacular arcs have now been
observed from young galaxies at z = and greater (>Fig. 6-3).
The discovery of gravitational lensing has ushered in a new era of cluster studies, where the
mass content and concentration of galaxy clusters can be determined without reference to the
galaxy content or the X-ray hot gas. This has made it possible to directly calibrate the masses
of clusters and thus to use them as probes of galaxy evolution. More startlingly, the clusters
can also become telescopes, gravity creating the first lens of a cosmic telescope that provides an
unprecedented views of the first galaxies to form in the universe.

1.3 Overview
In this chapter, I will take the reader on a guided tour of forefront studies of galaxy clusters. This
will begin with a close look at the optical properties of clusters and the galaxies they contain.
I will examine the special morphologies and star formation histories of cluster galaxies com-
pared to those in more isolated environments. The aim is to understand how the differences
between these galaxies are established. This has led to better understanding of Galaxy Ecology –
the ways in which galaxies interact with their surroundings – and to improved understanding of
the suppression of star formation in the universe in general. An important topic at the present
is to compare the properties of galaxies in presented day clusters with those of clusters at higher
redshifts. The higher redshift clusters are seen at earlier times and are (in a statistical sense)
the progenitors of toady’s most massive systems. This is a fertile test-bed for theories of galaxy
formation and evolution.
Although clusters are often thought of as collections of galaxies, galaxies are far from the
dominant baryonic component. A far greater fraction of the system’s baryons are associated
with a diffuse hot plasma that is confined by the gravitational pull of the system’s dark matter.
The plasma is a strong X-ray emitter, and the spectrum can be analyzed to reveal the plasma
density and temperature. This allows the cluster to be used as cosmic calorimeter reflecting the
thermal history of its formation. I will discuss the major puzzle of this plasma – the “cooling flow
paradox.” Although the plasma has a short cooling time, the measured star formation rates of
cluster galaxies are much smaller than this would seem to imply. The resolution to this paradox
seems to be intimatelyconnected to the frequent presence of radio galaxies in clusterof galaxies,
an observation that has now been incorporated into theoretical models of galaxy formation with
profound consequences.
In the final section, I will look at clusters of galaxies from a theoretical perspective, focusing
on the evidence for their dark matter content and on their role in setting cosmological param-
eters. I will also set the formation of clusters of galaxies in the context of the growth of the
large-scale structure of the cosmos.

The Optical Properties of Clusters
2.1 The Density–Morphology Relation
Galaxies contain two main components – a flattened stellar disk that is supported by the coher-
ent rotation of stars and an ellipsoidal bulge that is supported the random and roughly isotropic
motion of its stars. Hubble developed a system for classifying galaxies on the basis of (1) the rela-
tive strength of the disk and bulge components and (2) the presence and strength of spiral arms.
Galaxies with a dominant bulge component and weak spiral arms are referred to as “early type”
while the galaxies with a strong disk and clear spiral arms are “late types.” The designation is not
intended to indicate a morphological sequence. The late or spiral galaxies are then subclassified
according to the presence of a central bar as well as the strength of the bulge/spiral arms. An
important class of galaxies is the lenticular or S0 galaxies. These have a clear disk component
(as well as a strong bulge) but weak or absent spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies have significantly
weaker (or undetectable) disks. From the view point of clusters, the key distinction is between
the early and late types and between the elliptical and S0 galaxies.

Clusters of Galaxies
Dressler (1980) applied the classification scheme to clusters of galaxies. This was a heroic
work obtaining clear photographic plates and laboriously classifying the galaxies in the clus-
ters. Although it had been clear to even the first observers (such as Herschel and Wolfe) that
early types were clustered into the densest regions, Dressler’s measurements made it possible to
quantify this trend. The results showed a universal relationship between the local density and
galaxy type, and Dressler used this to argue that there was a causal connection between galaxy
morphology and clustering. More recent results have been used to show that the trends extend
to lower density environments such as galaxy groups and that the development of the relation
can be traced back to high redshift.
The origin of galaxy morphology is often phrased in terms of “nature vs. nurture.” In other
words, is the morphology of galaxies a result of the initial conditions of galaxy formation, or as
the result of the laterevolution of the galaxy? Were the galaxies formed differently and then cap-
tured into the cluster, or were they modified by the cluster? Current theories suggest that both
play a role. The galaxies in clusters (and groups) tend to be more massive than galaxies in lower
density environments. This describes a large part of the trend since more massive galaxies are
very often elliptical. But a trend with environment is still evident at a fixed stellar mass, and this
is ascribed to various physical processes that tend to suppress star formation in cluster galaxies
(converting spirals to S0 types as the disk fades and the arms dissolve) and to randomize the
coherent disk motion to form a bulge (converting S0 to elliptical types). Ram-pressure strip-
ping of disk and halo gas is thought to drive the spiral to S0 transformation, while the S0 to E
transformation is most likely driven by galaxy collisions/mergers and harassment (the cumu-
lative effect of weak encounters). Theoretical models for galaxy evolution make an important
distinction between the galaxy at the center of the system and the satellite galaxies that orbit
around it. We should expect the satellites to be subject to the transformation processes, while
the central galaxy may continue to accrete further gas from its surroundings. I will describe the
transformation processes in more detail below. The timescales for the two transitions need not
be the same.
At higher redshift, the trends evolve, with higher redshift clusters containing a higher pro-
portion of later-type galaxies. A particularly contentious issue has been the rapid buildup of the
S0 content of clusters. The controversy has largely arisen due to the difficulty of clearly distin-
guishing the E and S0 types and in allowing for the biases in clusters/galaxy selection due to the
redshifting of the observed bands.
A major effort has therefore been made to establish a morphological classification scheme
that can be determined by computers rather than the human eye. Machine-based schemes use
the light profile or the concentration and asymmetry (Simard et al. 2002). Some success has
been obtained in describing the broad-brush evolution of the galaxy population as a whole, but
the differences in the morphologies of cluster galaxies are rather more subtle. Indeed, the issue
of mapping machine-based classifications onto Hubble scheme is difficult because the original
classification scheme relies on more than one property.
A new development is the “Galaxy Zoo” (Lintott et al. 2008; Bamford et al. 2009): using a
popular web site, “citizen-scientists” are invited to classify galaxy images (currently from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Although each individual classifier may have a large uncertainty in
classifying one object, each galaxy is classified by hundreds of people so that the trends can be
carefully examined with statistical tools. Recent results present a reassuring confirmation of the
trends identified by Dressler but emphasize that galaxy mass has at least as important a role as
galaxy environment.

2.2 The Color–Magnitude Relation
The lack of a clear physical interpretation of galaxy morphology has led many authors to pre-
fer classification schemes based on galaxies, stellar populations and star formation histories.
In outline, spiral galaxies have significant contributions from young, relatively hot stars (this
makes the spiral arms stand out in imaging data), while elliptical and S0 galaxies are dominated
by older stars similar to the sun. Color (or certain spectral absorption lines) may therefore be
used to create a classification scheme that is clearly related to underlying physical properties of
the galaxies. The universe encourages us to use this scheme since galaxies fall onto two largely
separated sequences of passive galaxies (with red colors and little ongoing star-formation) and
star-forming galaxies (with blue colors and specific star formation rates around .Gyr−, such
galaxies will double their stellar mass in Gyr which suggests that their average star formation
rate has changed little over the history of the universe).
Galaxy color has the advantage that it is relatively “cheap” (in terms of telescope exposure
time) to measure and that the average color of the whole galaxy can be determined (making it
simple to compare galaxies of different angular size). Colors have the drawback that they are
affected by both the age of the stellar population and its star formation history. This degener-
acy can make it hard to interpret results uniquely, although the situation is improved by using
several colors spanning along wavelength base line, preferably including data from the near-
infrared. It is also difficult to determine instantaneous star formation rates from optical/near-IR
data: so, additional data in the ultraviolet or mid-infrared is required. Spectra of galaxies con-
tain more information than galaxy colors, allowing instantaneous star formation rates to be
determined from strong nebular emission lines (such as Hα) and allowing the age-metalicity
degeneracy to be broken using carefully selected stellar absorption features. This is an exten-
sive topic. Nevertheless, a great deal can be learned from a look at the broadband optical colors
of cluster galaxies, particularly if the galaxy redshift is known (or can be accurately estimated
using multiple photometric bands).
The standard approach is to plot galaxy color as a function of luminosity. In clusters, a clear
sequence of red galaxies stands out. An example (for the Coma cluster) is shown in >Fig. 6-4.
All the galaxies in this plot are confirmed to have redshifts matching that of the cluster. The
close proximity of the cluster makes it possible to measure accurate colors for even very faint
galaxies and to show that the sequence extends over a range of 10,000 in stellar mass.
The existence of this relation places strong constraints on the formation history of cluster
galaxies, as well as making clusters stand out in imaging of random fields. The relation is so
red because the majority of the cluster galaxies have few young stars: the bulk of the stars in
these systems must have formed many Gyr in the past. If we focus on the cores of galaxy clus-
ters, the very small proportion of cluster galaxies that deviate to the blue side of this sequence
implies that few star-forming galaxies are present and the fraction of blue galaxies can be used
to establish an analog of the morphology–density relation. The slope of the red sequence can
be understood in terms of a stellar mass – metalicity and stellar mass – age relationships. These
relationships appear to be universal from cluster to cluster, implying a great deal of similarity
in cluster formation history.
The cluster can be contrasted with a random field where the galaxy colors are much more
smoothly distributed in the color plane. Although a red-sequence is also evident in the random
field, it is occupied by a far smaller fraction of galaxies (recall that the random field will include
galaxy groups in the sample). However, the spread in the red shifts of the field systems means

the brightness of cluster galaxies and their color. The points are labeled by morphology. The rela-
tion obeyed by the early-type (E/S0 and dwarf E) galaxies is extremely tight with a scatter of less
than 0.06 mag. In these spectacular observations, the relation is seen to hold over 10 mag in galaxy
luminosity (a factor of 10,000 in galaxy mass) (Image credit: Hammer et al. 2010)
that the sequence (and the corresponding bluer sequence of star-forming galaxies) is smeared
out. This makes it possible to effectively select clusters of galaxies using optical techniques, cap-
italizing on the enhanced the contrast of the cluster against the projected background of the
field galaxies (Gladders and Yee 2000).
2.3 Spectroscopic Properties of Cluster Galaxies
The spectra of galaxies are, of course, essential for confirming a galaxy’s membership of a cluster,
but theyalsocontain a great deal ofinformation about the current starformation rate ofgalaxies,
their past star formation histories, and their metal abundance.
•
Star formation rate diagnostics. Ongoing star formation rates of galaxies can be estimated
from the emission lines in the spectrum. The technique measures the total ionizing flux
produced by massive stars, since this is remitted as line radiation when the interstellar gas
recombines. Because hydrogen is so abundant (and has a low-ionization potential), it is
particularly strong. One of the best star formation tracers is thus the Hα emission line at
6,563 Å (Kennicutt 1998; Brinchmann et al. 2004). Conversion of a line luminosity to a
star formation rate is, however, complicated by the presence of dust that may scatter or
absorb line photons before they leave the galaxy. It is possible to correct for this using the

Clusters of Galaxies 6
275
relative strength of Hα and Hβ. Other elements, notably oxygen, also produce strong lines,
but interpretation of these lines as star formation indicators is dependent on the system’s
metal abundance (as well as dust), so they must be carefully calibrated. It is also possible
to estimate star formation rates on the basis of the mid-IR (e.g., 24 μ) flux. This uses the
flux of UV radiation that is reprocessed by dust. In this way, it is possible to determine star
formation rates even in galaxies that show no detectable emission. With all these methods,
care needs to be taken that the source of flux is star formation rather than accretion on to a
black hole (an AGN).
•
Star formation history diagnostics. Absorption lines in the spectrum can be used to study the
star formation history of a galaxy. This is usually parameterized as the luminosity weighted
age of the stellar population. The technique relies on the different surface gravity and met-
alicity sensitivity of various Balmer and metal lines (Worthey 1994). Strong higher-order
Balmer lines are indicative of a young stellar population. For example, an Hδ equivalent
width of greater than 3 Å can only be explained by the presence of a substantial population
of A-class stars. This indicates a luminosity weighted stellar age of around 1 Gyr.
•
Metalicity indicators. The metal abundance of the stellar population can be determined from
diagnosticlines in a similarway. However, the differences between lines as a function ofmet-
alicity are relatively subtle and careful modeling is required. In particular, galaxies in clusters
often show an enhancement in the abundance of α process elements(such as Mg) relative to
that in the solar spectrum. This provides an additional measureof the star formation history
of the galaxy suggesting a relatively rapid enrichment, primarily by type II supernovae.
These techniques allow the galaxy population to be described in more detail. Current results
confirm that the most massive early-type galaxies are old (age ∼Gyr) and metal rich. There is
a consistent tendency for lower luminosity galaxies to be both less metal rich and to be younger
than the more massive galaxies. This mayagree well with the results from the observed evolution
of galaxy color–magnitude diagrams. In addition, the lower mass galaxies show less enrichment
of α process elements, suggesting that they have a more extended star formation history as well
as being younger (Nelan et al. 2005).
2.4 The Fundamental Plane of Early-Type Galaxies
The spectra of galaxies also allow the velocity dispersion or rotation speed of the stellar system
to be determined. Combining this with the stellar radius of the system yields the dynamical
mass of the galaxy. In clusters, this is most often applied to the elliptical and bulge-dominated
S0 population. Since the velocity dispersion profile is approximately flat, the mass can be esti-
mated by the simple application of the virial theorem. If we further assume that the mass is
dominated by the stellar population (or at least proportional to the luminosity) and that the
shape of the system is homologous, this predicts a tight correlation between the system radius,
velocity dispersion, and mass:
Re ∝Me
σ 
or
Re ∝σ I−
e
(6.1)
where Re is the effective radius of the galaxy, Me the mass within Re, σ the central velocity
dispersion, and Ie the surface brightness at Re. Such a tight correlation is indeed observed,

276 6
Clusters of Galaxies
although the coefficients of the observed relation differ slightly (Jorgensen et al. 1996):
Re ∝σ .I −.
e
(6.2)
The difference between the two appears to arise from variations in the mass-to-light ratio of
the stellarpopulation and a degree of nonhomology. Such variations are not surprising since the
stellar populations are known to vary with total system mass. Indeed, many galaxy properties
correlate more tightly with velocity dispersion than with system mass.
By choosing suitable combinations of the surface brightness and the velocity dispersion, the
fundamental plane may be viewed edge on. The resulting tight correlation with luminosity may
be used as a powerful distance indicator and also as a strong constraint on the mass-to-light
ratio evolution of cluster galaxies (Holden et al. 2005).
2.5 Galaxy Ecology
Galaxy ecology is the study of how galaxies interact with their environment. Clusters make
a good laboratory (Gunn and Gott 1972). There are lots of galaxies in one place, at one red-
shift. The drawback is that cluster galaxies represent only a small fraction of the total galaxy
population. Galaxy groups contain a much larger fraction of the population, and galaxy trans-
formations, also more likely there. The subject is opening up due to large redshift surveys which
identify large samples of group galaxies, but at high redshift, these surveys are still limited to
relatively bright galaxies.
Although the trends of morphology and color with environment density are well estab-
lished, the theoretical underpinnings of the relationships are only now becoming clear. There
are essentially four key processes that transform galaxy properties: galaxy collisions, dynamical
friction, the ram pressure of the intra-cluster medium, and “strangulation.” However, the prop-
erties of galaxies in clusters are not simply the result of galaxy transformation. Cluster galaxies
are generally brighter than spirals, so the comparison needs care to ensure that galaxies are
being compared on a like-for-like basis. Samples must match in stellar masses, not luminosi-
ties, and the comparison must allow for tidal stripping and fading of the disk. Finally, it should
be remembered that the progenitors of cluster galaxies are not the spiral galaxies we observe
today, but the field galaxy population at z ∼.
2.5.1 Galaxy Collisions
Consider what happens when one galaxy passes another. The stars feel a perturbation in their
gravitational force. A rapid fluctuation removes energy from the (ordered) motion of the galaxy
and puts it into random motions of the stars. If the encounter is sufficiently rapid, we can use
impulsive approximation. The energy transferred from the orbital motion of the galaxies to the
internal motion of the stars is then
ΔE ∼GM

(6.3)
where Mand Mare the masses of the perturbed and perturbing galaxies, respectively, ris
the size of the perturbed galaxy, their relative velocity is Vp, and their closest approach distance
is Rp (Richstone 1975; Covington et al. 2008).

The effect is (1) to puff up the galaxy’s stellar disk. If the energy transfer is extreme, the
heating destroys the disk. S0 disks are indeed thicker than those of spiral galaxies. (2) Remove
orbital angular momentum. If enough is removed, the two galaxies become bound, and as they
encounter each other again, more energy is lost and they spiral together eventually merging to
form an (elliptical) remnant. If the galaxy masses are comparable, the remnant will be domi-
nated by the bulge. The remnant’s shape is dominated by velocity dispersion (which need not
be isotropic). If the masses are unequal, a significant disk may survive.
However, these processes are more effective if the encounter speed is comparable to the
motion of the stars. If it is too rapid, the energy exchange is minimal. As a result, clusters with
high-velocity dispersions are not likely to be strongly influenced by collisions. “Harassment,” the
cumulative effect on multiple, weak encounters, may be important however (Moore et al. 1996).
2.5.2 Dynamical Friction
As a galaxy travels through the dark matter halo of the cluster, it experiences a drag force. This
results because the dark matter is focused towards the galaxy as it orbits and generates a wake
behind the galaxy. The slight mass excess exerts a retarding force on the galaxy’s motion.
Over time, this saps the orbital energy of the galaxy. The timescale for the galaxy to sink to
the center is given by
tsink = rVc
Gm

F ln Λ
(6.4)
where Vc is the circular velocity of the halo and r the initial radius of the satellite of mass m.
F and ln Λ are dimensionless constants relating to the velocity anisotropy of the dark matter
particles in the halo and the relative range of encounter scales (Chandrasekhar 1943). The satel-
lite’s dark matter halo also looses mass as it spirals in, tending to increase the dynamical friction
timescale. These uncertainties can be calibrated bynumerical simulations (Boylan-Kolchin et al.
2008).
Dynamical friction leads to galaxies spiraling into the center of the cluster. Indeed, the cen-
tral galaxies of clusters have unusual properties, not seeming to fitting extrapolation of the
normal luminosity function and reflecting a flattening of the galaxy mass-metalicity relation.
When clusters merge, dynamical friction will cause the central galaxy of each system to merge
together. This is a likely explanation of clusters, like the Coma cluster, that contain two (or more)
dominant galaxies.
2.5.3 Ram-Pressure Stripping
Cluster galaxies are moving through the diffuse intra-cluster medium (ICM) and are subject to
hydrodynamic forces. In particular, if the galaxy contains a disk of cold gas, it must force the
ICM aside for the galaxy to pass through. If the gravitational force holding the gas in the plane
of the galaxy is too weak, the gas will be stripped. This condition can be written as
ρICMV > πGΣ∗(r)Σg(r)
(6.5)
where ρICM is the density of the diffuse external gas V in the orbital velocity of the galaxy,
Σ∗(r) is the stellar surface density of the galaxies disk at radius r, and Σg the surface density
of gas at this radius. If the condition is satisfied, gas will be stripped from this radius. If the

the intra-cluster medium, the ram pressure sweeps material out of its disk leaving a trail of ionized
material behind it. Such trails have been observed behind spiral galaxies in clusters (Image credit:
Quilis et al. 2001)
galaxy is moving sufficiently fast, all the gas in the galaxy will be removed. At lower velocity,
only material in the outer parts is removed (Gunn and Gott 1972). The results of these simple
analytic arguments can be verified with numerical simulations (>Fig. 6-5). These show that the
formulae are broadly correct (Quilis et al. 2001), but highlight a number of potential issues such
as the compression of the interstellar medium during the stripping process.
The ram-pressure stripping mechanism presents a plausible explanation of the absence of
conventional spiral galaxies in clusters. Indeed, some examples of galaxies in the process of
being stripped have been clearlyidentified through high-resolution ultraviolet imaging ofgalax-
ies in nearby clusters. However, the stripping process is only likely to be strong if the motion of
the galaxy is rapid and the ICM is sufficiently dense. Since lower mass systems, such as galaxy
groups, contain a much lower density plasma, this is not likely to explain the relative abun-
dance of the early-type galaxies in groups. Yet, observations of galaxy groups show that the
passive galaxy sequence and many of the characteristic properties of cluster galaxies are already
established in lower mass groups. It seems that this mechanism cannot be the dominant driver
of galaxy ecology.

Clusters of Galaxies 6
279
2.5.4 Strangulation
This is a theorist’s mechanism, and not directly observed. Galaxy formation models suggest that
galaxies continually recycle gas between their disk and halo (White and Frenk 1991). Feedback
from supernovae ejects the gas from the disk regulating the star formation rate of the galaxy.
Without this process, galaxy formation is far too efficient to match the very-low-observed stellar
mass fraction of the universe. (Clusters are a good census: only 10% of the cluster baryons are
locked into stars.)
In cluster galaxies, this cycle is easily interrupted by ram-pressure stripping of the loosely
attached material in the halo of the galaxy. This is a distinct process from the stripping of the
tightly bound material in the galaxy disk. However, the process can be described by the same
formula, but need to reassess the coefficient because of the relative distributions of mass and
gas. Essentially, the same formula applies as for the ram-pressure stripping of disk gas but with
a new coefficient to allow for the revised geometry (McCarthy et al. 2008).
This process is effective even in small groups. Indeed, it seems to be too effective when
incorporated into a cosmological self-consistent model for galaxy formation and evolution.
The current challenge is to realistically incorporate the mechanism into cosmological galaxy
formation models. Current schemes seem to predict that the mechanism is rather too effective
compared to the observational data.
2.6 Evolution of Galaxy Clusters
The idea is appealing and simple. In order to map out the formation of cluster galaxies, we
should find clusters at high redshift and compare them to local systems. The process has been
likened to understanding the family history through a set of snapshot photographs. Of course,
it is not quite so simple since we cannot observed the same cluster at different moments in its
history, and we must piece the story together from statistical arguments.
It therefore needs care: (1) we need to match the masses of galaxies, not their luminosities,
and to be careful to make measurements the rest frame of each cluster. (2) Massive clusters at
high redshift will grow in mass bythe present-day. Theyare alsosorare that it can be problematic
to sample a sufficiently large volume in the local universe. (3) We must pay attention to how the
clusters are selected. If selection is based on an observed-frame optical band, high-z clusters
will be preferentially selected if they contain more blue galaxies.
2.6.1 Color Evolution
One of the most striking results from the early observations of clusters was the Butcher–Oemler
effect (Butcher and Oemler 1984). The authors reported the colors of galaxies in optically
selected distant clusters. To the surprise of the community, they discovered a rapidly rising
fraction of blue galaxies in the clusters. This was unexpected in that the effect was seen out to
quite moderate redshifts (z = .), in stark contrast to the paradigm of the time that cluster
galaxies were old, with ages comparable to that of the universe.
The result is illustrated in >Fig. 6-6 for a modern sample. The line illustrates the evolution
in the fraction of star-forming galaxies based on the sample of clusters at z < .. If the trend
could be extrapolated, then there would be almost no red (passive) galaxies in clusters at z ∼.

280 6
Clusters of Galaxies
⊡Fig. 6-6
A modern measurement of the Butcher–Oemler eﬀect. The Butcher–Oemler eﬀect was originally
seen as an increase in the fraction of blue (and hence star forming) galaxies in clusters towards
higher redshifts. Here, the same eﬀect is seen in a sample of carefully selected clusters using mid-
infrared observations to identify star-forming galaxies. A rapid increase with redshift is suggested
(dashed line, ﬁtted to data z < 0.3), but scatter between clusters is very large. Solid symbols show
results from high X-ray luminosity clusters, while opensymbols denote systems of lower X-ray lumi-
nosity. Open squares show higher redshift clusters observed by Saintonge et al. (2008). Clearly,
these clusters do not follow the trend suggested by the dashed line (Image credit: Haines et al.
2009)
Butcher–Oemler’s original result has been heavily criticized. Clearly, not all the clusters follow
the same trends, and some local but less relaxed clusters have blue fractions comparable to
clusters at higher redshifts. Moreover, Butcher and Oemler’s original selection of the clusters
was inhomogeneous, with some of the clusters being selected from blue photographic plates.
Clearly, this could bias the cluster sample to systems that contained more blue galaxies than
the ensemble average. Another important bias is that the greater star formation rates of high-
redshift field galaxies, combined with the bluer rest-frame pass bands typically used, mean that
magnitude limited samples typically contain disproportionately many dwarf galaxies compared
to local systems.
However, these biases do not seem to be sufficient to fully account for the effects, and the
result has been reported in more modern clustersamples including results based on mid-IR star
formation rates, as shown in the figure. It seems that these biases cannot fully explain the effect.
However, another bias is much harder to remove. Because the universe is younger (and
the masses of clusters are more extreme compared to the average halo mass), the growth rates
of clusters are significantly higher in the past compared to the present-day. Infalling galaxies
cannot easily be distinguished from the virialized cluster population. Moreover, the field galaxy
population is much more active at higher redshifts, with a larger fraction of the population

Clusters of Galaxies 6
281
having blue colors. The situation is therefore unclear, and a modern interpretation could be
that the increase in active galaxies results from the changes in the field galaxy population rather
than from changes in the physics that occur within galaxy clusters.
2.6.2 E+A Galaxies
In the classic literature, the discussion of the evolution of cluster galaxies is closely related to the
presence of a “new” population of “post-starburst” galaxies in distant clusters.These galaxies are
often referred to as “E+A” galaxies because their distinguishing feature is spectra that are dom-
inated by strong Balmer absorption, most notably the Hδ line. The line strengths, combined
with the absence of emission lines, seen in some spectra cannot be reproduced with declin-
ing star formation history. The best described as the spectrum of an A star superposed on that
of an elliptical galaxy (hence the tag “E+A”) and required a strong burst of star formation fol-
lowed by an abrupt truncation (Couch and Sharples 1987). Recently, it has been realized that
an alternative interpretation is possible in which the star formation is ongoing but heavily dust
obscured. Only the A star population escapes from the strong dust obscuration creating the
strong absorption.
The E+A population is now realized not to be confined to clusters, and examples of the
E+A type are evident in the local galaxy populations where they can be observed in detail to
explore the cause of the unusual activity. It is likely that the population originally identified in
distant clusters is the result ofthe greaterstarformation rates offield galaxies and the subsequent
suppression of their star formation in the cluster or galaxy group environment.
2.6.3 Cluster Archaeology
An alternative approach to cluster evolution is to observe the properties of local galaxies in
detail. High signal-to-noise observations of galaxies in local clusters allow the degeneracy
between metalicity and average stellar age to be broken. This work requires great care and the
development of spectral models that allow for nonsolar element abundances.
While these results show that the high-mass cluster galaxies are old, as expected, they reveal
a significant trend for the lower mass galaxies to be younger (>Fig. 6-7). This is an intriguing
result that seems to require a degree of co-ordination between the metalicity of the lower mass
galaxies and their weighted age. This cancelation does not arise naturally in theoretical models
that have efficient feedback.
2.6.4 The Luminosity Function
A fourth approach to the evolution of clustergalaxies is to observed the system luminosity func-
tion. This requires care since the normalization of the luminosity (or mass function) depends
on the overall mass of the halo and not the volume surveyed. To compare, the mass of the halo
requires an independent measure of the system mass, such as that obtained from gravitational
lensing.
However, the relative shapes of the mass function can be compared much more simply.
In particular, the fraction of the total stellar mass contributed by high, and low-mass passive

De Lucia et al. (2004) reported a relative porosity of low-mass red-sequence galaxies on the
basis of HST imaging. The result has been confirmed in several (although not all) subsequent
studies, such as that shown in >Fig. 6-8.
It is interesting to compare this with the emergence of relatively young ages for low-mass
galaxies from cluster archaeology. A simple interpretation suggests that the correlation between

The evolution of the ratio of dwarf (fainter than MV = 20) to giant (brighter than MV = 20) red-
sequence galaxies as a function of redshift. The sample shown here is taken from Stott et al. (2007)
and uses carefully matched samples of X-ray-selected clusters. A strong trend is seen with fewer
red-sequence dwarf observed in the higher redshift clusters. This suggests that star formation in
faint galaxies has not yet been suppressed in these systems
age and stellar mass should twist the color-magnitude sequence, increasing its slope at higher
redshift (in contrast to the mild slope evolution that is observed). However, this is based on
the assumption that the star formation rate slowly declines as the galaxy is incorporated into
the clusters. A more complex interpretation appears to be required, in which galaxies make a
rapid switch between the passive and star-forming sequences. It is interesting to note that the
“rapid switch” picture is supported by the strong presence of two sequences even in studies of
the group and field population (Balogh et al. 2004).
The discussion of the evolution of the stellar mass function has highlighted the need for
care when comparing clusters at different redshifts and even between systems of different mass.
It is now very apparent that stellar masses need to be compared on a like-for-like basis and
that samples need to be compared on the basis of stellar mass, not luminosity (particularly
luminosity in bluer bands). This not only complicates the comparison of systems at different
redshift, but it makes it harder to compare systems of different total halo mass (since this also
affects the stellar mass function).
2.6.5 Morphology
The launch of the HST has offered the possibility of studying the morphologies of galaxies in
distant clusters, allowing this to be compared to the changes in the star-forming properties.
This topic has resulted in extensive controversy largely because of the difficulty in obtaining

284 6
Clusters of Galaxies
objective computer-derived morphologies. Carefullymoderated “eyeball” morphologies consis-
tently suggest that distant clusters contain fewer S0 galaxies and more spiral galaxies than local
counterpart clusters (Dressler et al. 1997). Interestingly, the clusters contain similar fractions
of early-type galaxies at all redshifts, hinting that the cluster population consists of an intrinsic
elliptical galaxy population and an S0 population that has built up over time. It is difficult to
reproduce this result, with current galaxy formation models.
The spiral to S0 transformation would appear to reinforce the evolution of galaxy colors first
suggested by the Butcher–Oemler effect. However, the same caveats about the role of magni-
tude limits, cluster selection, and galaxy infall apply equally here. Nevertheless, many authors
are convinced of the evidence for a long timescale of transformation of spiral galaxies to S0,
others identify galaxy groups as the key environment in the history. Care, however, needs to
be exercised since many studies average the whole galaxy population together and do not fully
account for the biases in the stellar mass function of cluster, group, and isolated galaxies.
2.6.6 Other Wavebands
Observations in the FIR have opened up the possibility of including deeply dust-obscured star
formation in the census of star formation in clusters and groups of galaxies. In particular, the
observations stand to reveal a source of star formation in the E+A galaxy population.
To date, the results have been mixed. Some authors report the discovery of strong FIR
sources in clusters, consistent with such deeply obscured star formation (Geach et al. 2009).
However, the sources appear to be rare, and when the mass biases are taken into account, it is
unclear whether the population is specific to the cluster environment, or is better accounted for
by the enhanced infall of cluster galaxies. With the advent of Herschel and better models for the
evolution of galaxies, this is a rapidly advancing field.
2.7 The Relation of Clusters to Galaxy Groups
The above discussion makes it clear that the evolution of galaxy clusters cannot be separated
from the evolution of galaxy groups and a great deal of effort is being targeted on measuring the
properties of galaxies in less rich environments, or even to measure the properties of galaxies as
a function of their clustering strength rather than assigning individual halo masses to galaxies.
The laterapproach has the advantage that it can be computed using objectivelydefined statistical
measures such as the correlation function or the marked correlation function.
Studies of galaxy groups are, however, hard work compared to studies of clusters since tar-
getted spectroscopic campaigns return a much larger fraction of field galaxies compared to
group members. One of the best approaches is therefore to undertake large, highly complete
redshift surveys (such as the zCOSMOS survey (Maier et al. 2009)) and to select galaxy groups
from the survey. These can then be followed up in more detail. The results are exciting – at inter-
mediate redshift, the galaxy groups are offset from the field but have a larger proportion of active
galaxies than similarly selected groups at low redshift. These results are now being confirmed
out to higher redshifts. At z = groups from the zCOSMOS survey appear to be dominated by a
transition population of E+A galaxies (Balogh et al. 2011). These results have encouraged many
authors to consider that galaxy groups are the powerhouse of galaxy transformation.

Clusters of Galaxies 6
285
Another approach to this issue is to assign each galaxy an environment based on its local
density. Peng et al. (2010) use this approach to present an interesting view of the relation
between galaxies and environment. Presenting the results in this was, they show that the frac-
tion of star-forming galaxies can be effectively written as the product of two quenching terms,
one based on the galaxy’s mass and the other on its local density. The two terms are independent,
which seems to agree well with the expectation of theoretical models. This will be an interesting
angle to pursue with new, even larger, redshift surveys.
2.8 Intra-cluster Light
In a later section, I will present the role of dynamical friction in causing the orbits of galaxies
to decay. As the orbit decays, the galaxy becomes subject to stronger tidal forces which may
strip stars from the outer parts of the galaxy. The stars that are stripped in this way would con-
tinue to orbit in the cluster creating a diffuse interstellar glow. Although faint, the diffuse light
is just observable (Gonzalez et al. 2005), particularly around the dominant galaxy where it is
concentrated to the center of the gravitational potential.
Although the existence of the intra-cluster light is now well established, The total fraction
of stars in this diffuse form is still a matter of controversy. It is difficult to make this assess-
ment directly because of the surface brightness that drops rapidly away from the central galaxy.
McGee and Balogh (2010) circumvent this difficulty by measuring the intergalactic supernova
rate in clusters. Current estimates suggest that the intra-cluster light in clusters accounts for
about 10% up to 50% of the total star light. While recent measurements in lower-mass haloes
have suggested a larger contribution (based on extrapolation to low surface brightness), it is
hard to see how these results can be reconciled with the hierarchical growth of massive clusters
from lower mass systems.

X-Ray Emission
3.1 The Physics of X-Ray Emission
The optical properties of galaxy clusters reflect only a small fraction of their baryonic mass.
Most of the baryons in a cluster are in the form of a diffuse intra-cluster medium (ICM). This
relatively dense,high-temperatureplasma gives rise to copious X-rayemission. The typical tem-
perature of the cluster plasma is –K, and the core density reaches 0.01–0.1 atoms per
cm−. At these temperatures, the plasma is highly ionized leading to X-ray emission from ther-
mal Bremsstrahlung (also referred to as free–free emission) and inner-shell electron capture
and transitions.
3.1.1 Thermal Bremsstrahlung Emission
Conceptually, thermal Bremsstrahlung is straightforward. It arises as the trajectories of elec-
trons are deflected by the strong fields of ionized nuclei, including H+ and He++. The acceler-
ation of the electron generates the emission of a photon. Computation of the actual spectrum

286 6
Clusters of Galaxies
involves integration over impact parameters and the thermal distribution of electron velocities.
For an ion with charge Z and a plasma with electron temperature Te and electron and ion den-
sities ne and ni, respectively, the emissivity (per unit volume per unit frequency) is given by
є f f
Z (ν) = AZneniT −/
e
exp(−hν/kBTe)
(6.6)
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, h Plank’s constant, and the normalization constant is
given by
AZ = πe
mec(
π
mekB
)
/
Zg f f (Z, Te, ν)
(6.7)
where me is the electron mass, e the electron charge, and g f f the Gaunt factor, a slowly varying
function that corrects quantum mechanical effects (Sarazin 1988).
The spectrum has a continuous exponential distribution. If plotted in terms of log(ν), this
translates to a break at high energies corresponding to the thermal temperature of the plasma.
In order to obtain the total luminosity arising from free–free emission, we must integrate over
frequency and the volume, V, of the cluster and sum over each species:
L f f = ∑
Z ∫ν ∫V є f f
Z (ν) dν dV
(6.8)
Although the emission formula appears complex, it is characterized by its dependence on the
square of the density of plasma and its T/
e
temperature dependence. The later arises because a
higher temperature pushes the photon energy cutoff to higher energy (∝Te), while the higher
temperature reduces the effectiveness of individual collisions (∝T−/
e
). Free–free emission in
spectrum is dominated by collisions with hydrogen and helium nuclei.
The dependence on the square of the plasma density is a key result. This has important con-
sequences for the cooling instability since most heating mechanisms depend linearly on density.
This makes it difficult for a heating mechanism to simultaneously compensate for radiative
cooling over a range of radii.
Thermal Bremsstrahlung dominates the emissivity at temperatures above × K, where
the common elementsbecome completely ionized. At lower temperatures,electron energies are
comparable to the ionization potential and free-bound and bound–bound transitions become
important.
3.1.2 Bound–Bound Electron Transitions
X-rayemission alsoarises from bound transitions and the capture ofelectrons intobound shells.
Typically, the electron will be captured into a high-energy state, and a cascade of X-ray transi-
tions will result. Alternatively, one of the ion’s inner-shell electrons will be excited by collisional
processes. The resulting spectrum of emission lines depends both on the temperature of the
plasma and the abundance of different species. The calculation is complex because it requires
careful determination of the ionization balance of each species. More details of the calculation
are given in Sutherland and Dopita (1995). Recent calculations of the emission spectrum are
discussed in Wiersma et al. (2009), where the role of photo-ionization is considered in depth.
Fortunately, this correction is less important for high-temperature plasmas such as those in
clusters. Line emission dominates the emissivity at temperatures below K.

The contribution of diﬀerent elements to the overall cooling rate of the intra-cluster plasma. The
plot here illustrates the temperature dependence of the total emissivity for a solar abundance
plasma (solid lines). The contributions of diﬀerent elements are indicated. The emissivity of a
primordial plasma containing on hydrogen and helium is indicated by a solid line. These calcula-
tions assume that the plasma is in collisional ionization equilibrium, and at low temperatures, the
cooling curve is modiﬁed substantially in the presence of an ionizing background (Image credit:
Wiersma et al. 2009)
Just as for thermal Bremsstrahlung, the total emissivity depends on the square of the plasma
density since ionization mechanism is (at cluster temperatures) a two-body process. Moreover,
the shape of the emission spectrum can be used to infer the plasma temperature and the abun-
dance makeup. If the relative abundance of the elements is known, this makes it possible to
accurately infer the density and temperature of the plasma even in relatively low-quality X-ray
data (>Fig. 6-9).
It is interesting to consider the temperature dependence of the total (or volumetric) emis-
sivity in more detail. For a plasma that has not been enriched by stellar nucleosynthesis, the
temperaturedependence of the total emissivity is dominated by two peaks corresponding to the
ionization potentials of hydrogen and helium. As the metal abundance of the plasma increases,
the elements C, O, and Ne play an important role. As a result, the total emissivity of the plasma
has a very strong dependence on metal enrichment in the temperature range –K. This
has important consequences for the predicted luminosities of groups and clusters. Cross talk
between the formation of stars and the cooling of gas in galaxy clusters makes simulations of
the universe extremely challenging.
In addition, nonthermal processes can also lead to the emission of higher energy pho-
tons. The comptonization of the cosmic microwave background, in particularly, is potentially
important at higher redshift.

3.1.3 Total Emissivity
The total (or volumetric) emissivity is conveniently written as
є = n
HΛ(T, Z)
(6.9)
where nH is the hydrogen number density and Λ encapsulates the complex function of tem-
perature and ion abundance. This must be computed with computer codes such as those of
Sutherland and Dopita (1995) and Wiersma et al. (2009). Tabulated results are readily available,
but care needs to be taken to ensure that the density term in ( > 6.9) is consistently defined;
many authors use a pre-factor of nenH. For a primordial plasma containing 25% helium by
mass, ne = .nH. Fortunately, the gross behavior of the emissivity can be approximated by

(6.10)
where Tis the plasma temperature in units of K and fm is a factor that takes into account
the metal abundance of the plasma (Peacock 1999). For solar abundances, fm = , and for a
primordial plasma, fm ≈.. Note that at high temperatures, we recover the T/dependence
expected for thermal Bremsstrahlung, while at temperatures lower than those of groups and
clusters, the dependence is T−/.
3.2 The Baryon Content of Galaxy Clusters
We can apply our understanding of the emission mechanisms to determine the hot gas con-
tent of galaxy clusters. The temperature can be inferred from the spectrum. If consideration is
restricted to fixed element abundance ratios, this can be achieved even at relatively low spectral
resolution. This makes it possible to construct detailed temperature (and abundance) maps for
nearby clusters.
3.2.1 Temperature and Density Proﬁles
The temperature profile is close to isothermal, with most clusters showing a modest decrease
in temperature towards their center, and a slight drop in temperature towards their outer edge.

the critical density of the universe at the redshift of collapse. Combining these expressions, we

This is within 15% of the observed relation (Vikhlinin et al. 2006).
The density can be reconstructed from the observed X-ray surface brightness. Of course,
care is needed to reconstruct the 3-dimensional density distribution from the 2-dimensional
measurements. This typically involves making an assumption of spherical symmetry which
allows the contribution from successive shells to be determined.
Clusters are conventionally fitted by a density profile of the form
ρ =
ρc
(+ (r/rc))

β
(6.14)
where ρc, rc, and β are fitting constants. Typically, β = /provides an adequate fit although
more recent papers fit more complex profiles, or dispense with simple fitting formulae alto-
gether and use the results of numerical simulations directly (Vikhlinin et al. 2006). Central gas
densities greater than −atoms per cm(ρg ∼× M⊙Mpc−) and core radii around
kpc are typical. The plasma is typically enriched with metals, typically to about /of the
solar abundance (Leccardi and Molendi 2008).
Integrating the profile gives the total gas mass. This is typically 12% of the total system mass
(see below for a discussion of techniques for estimating the total mass of the system). The gas
content of clusters is much greater than the mass in stars and in cold gas, which makes up only
10% of the total baryon content. A great deal of the residual uncertainty comes from the diffuse
intra-cluster stars.
These fractions are very comparable to the stellar fraction of the universe as a whole, with
the notable exception that it is not possible to directly detect intergalactic plasma because its
temperature is too low for efficient X-ray emission and its presence is inferred indirectly from
cosmological measurements of Ωb/Ωm.
3.2.2 The Entropy Distribution
Measurement of the temperatures and density of the intra-cluster plasma may be summarized
in terms of the “entropy” of the plasma at each radius. Typically, X-ray astronomers use the
adiabat of the gas
K ≡kBT ρ−/
as a proxy for the entropy (thermodynamic entropy is proportional to log K). The adiabat is
a useful quantity, because it does not change as the gas is adiabatically compressed due to
changes in the gravitational potential. Moreover, the buoyancy of the gas results in a nat-
ural sorting of the material such that the lower entropy material sinks to the center of the
cluster, while the higher entropy material rises to the outside. Numerical experiments show
that this segregation occurs rapidly as the cluster grows. Hydrostatic equilibrium, buoyancy,
and an insensitivity to the outer boundary conditions make it possible to uniquely spec-
ify the gas distribution in the cluster in terms of the gravitational potential and the entropy
distribution.
Entropy also provides a good variable for clusterstudies since it can be used to infer the total
heating and cooling of the gas as the system has formed. Heating sources include the shock
heating of gas as it enters the cluster (and energy injected by a central radio galaxy), while
cooling is dominated by the radiative losses of the ICM. These ideas can be used to treat clusters

The entropy proﬁles of intra-cluster medium in galaxy clusters taken from the REXCESS survey. The
entropy proﬁle in each cluster has been scaled by dividing by the characteristic entropy expected
for a cluster of the observed temperature (K500 = 1
2 ( 2πG2M200
15fbH(z) )). The colors of the lines indicate the
cluster temperature. Black lines and shaded regions show the expectations of theoretical models.
Scaling by K500 brings the proﬁle to similar values at the outer edge of the system, but the proﬁles
have a wide range of slopes. Typically, the lower temperature clusters have shallower proﬁles. This
results from a loss of the lower entropy material from these systems (Image credit: Pratt et al. 2010)
of galaxies as “cosmic calorimeters” allowing us to gain great insight into the thermal history of
the material that is left over from the process of galaxy formation (>Fig. 6-10).
Observations of the entropy distribution functions of clusters of different mass reveal an
unexpected scaling. Rather than the entropy distributions being scaled copies of each other, gas
in lower mass systems has a much flatter distribution of entropy. This leads to a much lower
concentration of the central gas and hence to much weaker X-ray emissivities of low-mass clus-
ters than expected. The difference cannot be attributed to a greater stellar fraction in the lower
mass systems, but the distinction is clearly connected to the “cooling flow paradox” that we
discuss below. Initially, the differences in entropy profile were thought to result from a mini-
mum entropy boost associated with an early epoch of galaxy formation (Ponman et al. 1999),
but it now seems more appropriate to view this as arising from the loss of low entropy material
from lower mass groups during the cluster formation (McCarthy et al. 2011). This has pro-
vided powerful but complimentary evidence for the role of AGN in regulating the formation of
galaxies.

3.3 The Cooling Instability
A useful quantity is to define the cooling time of the X-ray plasma as the ratio of its thermal
energy to its radiation rate:
tcool ≡

n kBT
n
HΛ
(6.15)
where n is the total number of thermal particles in the plasma and ne and nH are the electron
and hydrogen number density of the plasma. For a primordial plasma containing 25% helium
by mass, n =
ρg
.mp and nH =
ρg
.mp , where mp is the proton mass and ρg is the plasma density.
Using the approximation for Λ introduced previously (> 6.10), one obtains
tcool ∼(
ρg
(M⊙Mpc−))
−
(T−/

+ .fmT−/

)
−Gyr
(6.16)
Inserting a typical core gas density and temperature gives tcool ∼Gyr, significantly shorter
than the age of the universe.
The key point is that denser plasma has a shorter cooling time. Reducing the temperature
also shortens the cooling time. This leads to a cooling instability. As the plasma radiates, it is
squeezed by the weight of the material at larger radii. The net effect is that the pressure remains
roughly constant, but the density rises. The rise in density further increases the emission rate,
which in turn accelerates the increase in density. This leads to a radial inflow of gas referred
to as a “cooling flow” (Fabian 1994). Initially, the rate of flow is much smaller than the system
sound speed, and it is adequate to consider the cluster proceeding through a sequence of quasi-
hydrostatic states. Eventually, this approximation breaks down, and the plasma becomes subject
to local instabilities that grow on a timescale comparable to the free-fall time of the gas.
Clusters of galaxies are thus intrinsically unstable (> Fig. 6-11), leading to the expecta-
tion that the observed cluster should contain a net inflow of material towards the center of
the gravitational potential. Fortunately, the timescale for such flows in clusters is relatively long
compared to the overall age of the universe. Nevertheless,while we would not expect the cluster
to cool completely, a significant fraction of the material is expected to flow towards the center
of the system. Paradoxically, there is no evidence for such “cooling flows” on the scale expected.
A subtle but important point is that the cooling of the plasma does not necessarily result in
a drop in temperature if the cooling time is longer than the system dynamical time. In a quasi-
hydrostatic, flow the temperature reflects the shape of the potential. However, once the gas is
sufficiently dense, the cooling time becomes short compared to the dynamical time and clumps
of gas will condense out of the flow and cool.
In contrast to the situation in galaxy clusters, the cooling time is relatively short in galaxy
systems. A relevant comparison is with the local dynamical time:
tdyn = (Gρtot)−/
(6.17)
where ρtot is the total density (including both dark matter and gas). Assuming Ωb/Ωm = .
and that dark matterand gas have the same distribution (a poorapproximation within clusters!),
we can write
tdyn ≈(
ρg
M⊙Mpc−)
−/
Gyr
(6.18)
Comparing this with (>6.16), tcool/tdyn >> in the centers ofgalaxyclusters. However, the ratio
rapidly declines as the virial temperature of the halo falls, and the way in which cooling proceeds

The cooling time proﬁles of a sample of X-ray clusters taken from Sanderson et al. (2006). The cool-
ingtime of the plasma decreasesstrongly with decreasing radius so that the central cooling time of
most clusters is much less than the age of the universe. Solid and dashed lines distinguish between
clusters that have a central dip in their temperature proﬁle and those that do not (Image credit:
Sanderson et al. 2006)
in galaxy-scale haloes is potentially quite different to that in higher mass cluster systems (White
and Frenk 1991; Dekel and Birnboim 2006). This leads to an important distinction between hot-
mode accretion (i.e., cooling flows) and the “cold-mode” accretion that dominates the growth
of galaxies. In galaxies, the fueling rate is therefore determined by the rate of growth of the halo
and not the rate at which gas is able to radiate its energy. The accretion rate of galaxies is thus a
strong function of redshift.
Is strong AGN feedback in clusters inevitable, or should we be surprised by the frequency
and strength of the energy input? This is currently a subject of much debate. On the one hand,
if the AGN were not present or effective, this would lead to a pileup of cold gas at the center of
the cluster. Surely, this would eventually lose its angular momentum and find a way to accrete
onto the central black hole and thus establish a regulating feedback loop! But while this picture
is appealing, there are many missing pieces. For example, why are the processes so effective at
transporting the cooling gas down to a few Au of the black hole? What would happen if the
accretion rate were so high that the central accretion disk radiated the accretion energy away

rather than producing a powerful radio jet? Hopefully, we will be able to piece together a much
more complete picture in the near future.
3.3.1 Cooling Flows: Comparison to Observations
Detailed calculations of the cooling time profiles of galaxy clusters suggest that material should
be flowing to the centerat typical flow rates of 100–1,000 M⊙year−(Peres et al. 1998). The rates
are sensitive to the resolution of the X-ray observations (higher flow rates are found in better
resolved systems), and samples are biased by X-ray selection (since clusters with higher cooling
rates also have higher X-ray luminosity). Nevertheless, this work leads to the expectation that,
in the absence of an effective heating mechanism, mass should be transported to the center of
the cluster, cool out and form into stars. Some modern determinations of cooling time profiles
are shown in >Fig. 6-11.
However, the short cooling times seem contrary to observations.
(1)
Although central cluster galaxies often contain significant populations of young stars and
cold gas, the inferred star formation rates are roughly /of that inferred from the
analysis above. Similarly, the observation of extended Hα emission filaments does not
directly imply the high star formation rates since the emission strength greatly exceeds that
expected even under the flow scenarios above. It seems more likely that the filamentary
emission is indicative of the cosmic ray flux in the cluster.
(2)
As gas cools in the cluster, it should be possible to identify multiphase gas including com-
ponents with temperature well below the mean plasma temperature. A low-temperature
component would however emit efficiently in low-ionization lines. Surprisingly, these are
not evident in the X-ray spectrum of clusters (Peterson et al. 2003), limiting the maximum
cooling rate to less than M⊙year−in typical systems.
Many clusters are observed to have a central dip in temperature.Although this is often assumed
to be a result of high cooling rates, the temperature of the plasma more accurately reflects the
underlying gravitational potential. In gravitating systems, cooling (energy loss) does not result
in a drop in temperature.
3.3.2 Resolution
The lack of evidence of a sink for the cooling material has led to the search for an energy source
to offset the radiated energy. If there is sufficient energy input, the system can be held in (or
close to) a steady state. It has been apparent for some time that clusters of galaxies are often
associated with radio sources, but the significance of this association has only recently become
clear (Binney and Tabor 1995; Churazov et al. 2001; Fabian et al. 2006). It is now widely accepted
that heat input from radio galaxy activity (ultimately from the accretion of mass onto a central
black hole) provides the energy source that offsets the cooling losses from the ICM.
Radio galaxies are driven by AGN activity, but the activity is usually only visible through
the radio frequency emission produced by the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons. In
contrast toQuasars and Seyfert galaxies, optical line emission from the central black hole maybe
weak or absent. Radio observations classify such radio galaxies into FRI or FRII morphologies
depending on the relative brightness of the central source compared to the hot spots at the end
of the radio lobes. Clusters usually host FRI galaxies.

294 6
Clusters of Galaxies
The classification and study of radio galaxies is a vast subject in its own right. For our pur-
poses, we will focus on radiogalaxies as a source ofenergyin the cluster. It should be emphasized
that the power directly measured in the radio emission is small. However, it has recently been
seen that the radio jets correspond to cavities in the X-ray surface brightness. This allows the
total power to be estimated directly from the PV work done in displacing the ICM. The current
paradigm is that the radio jet inflates a bubble that then raises in the cluster due to its buoyancy
(Churazov et al. 2001). As it rises, its buoyant energy is dissipated in the surrounding medium.
Additional heating may come from weak shocks as the bubble is inflated.
Observationally, the mechanical luminosity, Lmech, is given by
Lmech = βpicmVc
tc
(6.19)
where picm is the ambient pressure of the intra-cluster medium surrounding the cavity, Vc is the
cavity volume (which must be estimated from its projected size), and tc is the age of the cavity.
β is a coefficient that accounts for the total work done as the cavity is inflated and rises: values
between 3 and 10 are plausible. The age of the cavity tc must be estimated from its buoyant
rise time. Current estimates of the heating rate suggest that it is comparable to the cooling rate
(>Fig. 6-12), and thus heating by radio galaxies may well resolve the “cooling flow paradox.”

Detailed observations show that the shutdown of star formation is not complete, and central
galaxies continue to form stars at rates of typically 1–M⊙year−, with associated emission
from molecular gas (Edge 2001). The lack of a complete shutdown is unsurprising, given the
intermittency of the radio outbursts and the nonspherical nature of jet emission, but the star
formation observed in central galaxies makes little contribution to the growth of the stellar
system.
The feedback from radio galaxies clearly plays an important role in suppressing cooling
flows and thus in establishing the maximum mass of galaxies that are formed (Bower et al.
2006). Incorporating these mechanisms into theoretical models greatly improves their ability
to describe the observed universe. The action of the AGN activity may also play an important
role in stirring the central gas, extending its central cooling time and distributing the metals
ejected by the central galaxy.
3.4 The Sunyaev–Zeldovich Eﬀect
The Sunyaev–Zeldovich (SZ) effect arises because the hot electrons in the intra-cluster plasma
scatter cosmic microwave background photons to higher temperatures. This imprints a pattern
of spots on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at the location of clusters. Depending on
the frequency of observation, the spot many be more or less luminous and this makes it possible
to efficiently distinguish the clusters from intrinsic CMB fluctuations and other foreground. The
detection of clusters through CMB methods is currently the subject of great attention: from the
ground with the South Pole Telescope and from space with the Planck mission.
The effect of the cluster is often encapsulated by the comptonization y parameter:
y ≡∫σTne kBT
mecdl
(6.20)
At low frequencies, the SZ effect cause a decrease in the CMB intensity δI/I = −y.
One of the advantages of the SZ effect is that the decrement does not depend on redshift.
Furthermore, it does not depend on the detailed clumping of the IGM, since only the pressure
is important. This means that it is a powerful alternative to exploring the properties of the IGM.
This will be an important avenue for future work.

Dark Matter
One of the most important roles of galaxy clusters has been to provide conclusive proof of
the existence of dark matter. Combined with limits on the abundance of baryons from nucle-
osynthesis and observations of the cosmic microwave background, this implies that the dark
matter is non-baryonic. We consider three methods of measuring the dark matter content of
clusters below.

where R is the virial radius of the system. Hence, the mass of the cluster can be estimated:
M ≈⟨σ 

(6.23)
More accurate calculations must allow for orbital anisotropy and a variety of other effects.
4.2 Hydrostatic Equilibrium
The X-ray-emitting plasma permits another approach to mass measurement. Assuming spher-
ical symmetry and that pressure forces balance the gravitational forces so that the system is in
hydrostatic equilibrium, we have

ρgas(r)
dP
dr = −GM(< r)
r
(6.24)
where M(r) is the total mass enclosed within radius r and ρg is the gas density.
Since the intra-cluster plasma is well described by an ideal gas with mean molecular weight
μ, the gas density and temperature are related to pressure by
P = ρgkT
μmp
(6.25)
where our assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium means that turbulence makes a negligible
contribution to the total pressure. For a pure ionized hydrogen plasma, μ = ., and for a more
realistic plasma including helium and heavier elements, μ = .. Eliminating pressure from the
equations gives
M(r) = −kBT(r)r
μmpG (d ln T
d ln r + d ln ρg
d ln r )
(6.26)
Since T and ρg can be mapped from the X-ray data, we can see that X-ray measurements
of the 3-dimesional density and temperature profiles thus allow us to determine the total
enclosed mass.

Clusters of Galaxies 6

For a simple example, if the cluster is isothermal and the density profile is described by
ρg ∝r−(as appropriate for (> 6.14) at large radius), the enclosed mass is given by

(6.27)
More complete analyses can make use of the full temperature and density profiles. Using
simulations as a guideline, a 10% correction should be included to allow for departures from
hydrostatic equilibrium. The error arising from departures from spherical symmetry can also
be estimated in this way. The error tends to be small because the gravitational potential is
more symmetric than the underlying gas distribution. High-quality X-ray measurements thus
provide a robust means of determining the mass profiles of clusters.
4.3 Gravitational Lensing
Because of the high dark matter content of clusters, they create strong sources of gravitational
lensing. These result in spectacular giant arcs. However, the use of gravitational lensing for clus-
ter is more easily applied to the weak lensing case, where the lensing effect results in the weak
distortion of background galaxies. The effect on an individual galaxy is weak, but by averaging
over many galaxies, a clear signal can be obtained.
The underlying principle of gravitational lensing is that the gravitational potential of the
cluster gives space an effective refractive index. This deflects light rays passing through the
cluster. For a circularly symmetric lens, the deflection angle, α, is given by
α = G
c
M(< b)
b
(6.28)
where b is the closest distance between the light ray and the cluster and M(< b) is the projected
mass enclosed within this radius. We can express in terms of the geometry of the lens, b ≡DLθI,
where DL is the distance to the lens and θI is the angular separation of the source and lens as
seen by the observer.
In the weak lensing case, where α << θI, the effect is to distort the background source into
a slightly elongated image. The elongation is related to the lensing potential by
( e
e) = ( ψ−ψ

(6.29)
where ψi j =
∂ψ
∂θ i ∂θ j and ψ is the lensing potential given by
∇ψ = DLDLS

πG
cΣ
where Σ = ∫ρdl is the projected mass surface density.
These equations can indeed be inverted to map the mass density of the cluster (Kaiser and
Squires 1993). For a spherically symmetric cluster, we can relate the distortion to the surface
density within a certain radius as
γ =
¯Σ(< b) −Σ(b)
Σcrit
(6.30)

298 6
Clusters of Galaxies
where Σ is the mass surface density. While the lensing signal directly measures the gravitating
mass of the system, the signal is still subject to confusion by line-of-sight projections, such as
the “mass-sheet degeneracy” (Bradac et al. 2004).
In the strong lensing case, the affect on the light path is more extreme and nonlinear. Several
different paths through the cluster may result in local stationary points in the path length and
thus correspond to images. The brightness of the different images will vary, some being brighter
and others fainter. Note that the intrinsicsurface brightness ofthese images is the same; it is their
angular extent that differs, and this can give rise to large magnification factors. Although the
strong lensing measurements cannot give total cluster mass (since the strong lensing effect is
confined to the center of the system), they give a powerful technique for measuring the mass dis-
tribution within the Einstein radius. This can, in turn, be used to confirm the mass distribution
with the radius probed by X-ray measurements.
4.4 Implications for Cosmology
The presence of dark matter in clusters is clear. All the methods are in broad agreement
(see >Fig. 6-13), with a much greater mass than can be associated with the galaxies alone, or
indeed even with the diffuse intra-cluster plasma. Of course, this does not directly preclude the

dark component being baryonic, but it is hard to imagine any viable way in which the required
vast abundance of baryons could be hidden. For example, the necessary mass of dust would
greatly exceed the limits on obscuration of background sources. We conclude that most of the
mass in cluster is non-baryonic.
Moreover, observations of the microwave background and nucleosynthesis are incompat-
ible with a significant baryonic component. Recent CMB constraints suggest Ωb/ΩM = .
(Komatsu et al. 2011). Allowing for the small (10%) contribution from baryons locked up in
stars, this is 13% higher than the observed value in galaxy clusters (Ettori et al. 2009). The
remaining factor maybe due to some mass ejected from the halo. This process is clearly seen
in galaxy groups, and it is thought that energy injection from AGN is responsible.
Additional cosmological constraints come from the abundance of clusters. They are a sensi-
tive probe ofthe highest peaks ofthe primordial densityfield. Tounderstand how the abundance
of clusters can be used as a cosmological constraint, we must understand how clusters are
formed.
5
The Formation of Clusters
A full treatment of the evolution of cosmological density perturbation is beyond the scope of
this chapter. We provide a very brief outline.
One approach is to consider the evolution of the cosmological density field following the
ideas of Press and Schechter (1974). This provides a simple analytical model of the most impor-
tant features. In the small amplitude regime, the growth of density perturbation is linear and
the different Fourier modes can be treated independently.
For a critical density universe, the perturbations, δ ≡Δρ/ρ, grow as (+ z)−. For a more
general cosmology, the growth rate is more complicated, but the principle is the same. However,
as the perturbations grow in amplitude, they eventually become large enough that the nonlinear
terms in the equations can no longer be ignored. At this point, the growth rate accelerates. When
δ ∼, the perturbation turns around and decouples from the cosmic expansion. It then rapidly
collapses to form a virialized object.
The key idea of the Press–Schechter model is to separate the growth of the perturbation into
the linear and nonlinear regimes. In this way, it is possible to count the fraction of space that
collapses into objects of a given size. So that the probability that a particle is part of an object of
a mass greater than M is given by
F ≡p(δ > δc∣R f (M)) [×] = 

⎛
⎝−erf ⎛
⎝
δc
√
σ(R f , z)
⎞
⎠
⎞
⎠[×]
(6.31)
δc is the threshold for nonlinear collapse. In the critical density of the universe, this is usually set
to .(to match the behavior expected for a top hot spherical density perturbation). R f (M)
is an appropriate scale corresponding to collapsed objects of mass M. An appropriate choice
would be to set this to (M/(πρ/))/, where ρis the average density of the universe. The
term σ(R f , z) is the rms amplitude of density fluctuations on scale R f at redshift z. You should
read the left side as giving the probability for collapse when the linear density field has been
filtered on scale R f . The growth on the density fluctuations is encapsulated in the σ(R f , z)
term. We can simplify this expression by encapsulating the redshift and mass dependence in
ν =
δc
σ(R f ,z).

Clusters of Galaxies
I have included a mysterious term [×] factor in this expression. If we were to count only
regions where the linear field exceeded the density threshold, this term would not appear. How-
ever, the formula would then only ever place half the mass of the universe in collapsed objects.
Press and Schechter multiplied the expression by 2 so that all the mass is placed in collapsed
objects if the threshold is sufficiently low. One argument is that we must account for regions
of the universe that are close to over-dense peaks as well as the peaks themselves. As the peak
collapses, it pulls in material from the surrounding region. This process does not need to be
independent of scale, but the factor of 2 approximation does a remarkably good job. Another
way to look at this problem is to examine the trajectories of the density of a point as a function
of the filtering scale. In this way, we can avoid undercounting regions (Bond et al. 1991).
In order to derive the mass spectrum of density perturbations, we can differentiate this
probability function in order to obtain the mass function of objects with mass M. If we define
f (M) as the commoving number of objects of mass M, so that M f (M)/ρ= ∣dF/dM∣, we
obtain
f (M) = ρM∣d ln σ
d ln M ∣

(6.32)
With recent advances in numerical simulations, it is possible to improve on this mass func-
tion by more carefully calibrating the terms. A detailed discussion of a better approximation to
this mass function, and extension to a wider range of cosmologies can be found in (Reed et al.
2007).
Nevertheless, the simple analytic formula gives remarkable insight into the formation of
structures in the universe and the growth of clusters in particular. At the present epoch, the
characteristic mass of haloes is ∼M⊙and thus clusters represent extreme objects in regions
of accelerated structure growth. It is possible to take this picture further and to ask how the
growth of a cluster differs from that of an average region of the universe.
Of course, numerical simulations are needed to see the full 3-dimensional picture. It can be
seen that clusters are knots formed at the intersection of the filaments. They grow by accreting
smaller lumps (such as galaxy groups) as well as more diffuse material that drains in along the
filaments. The Press–Schechter model can give insight into the growth statistics, but these can
also be determined directly from the numerical models.
An interesting question to ask is, what fraction of a cluster’s mass arrives in the form of
galaxy groups and what fraction in mass units of individual galaxies or smaller (McGee et al.
2009). A relatively large fraction of galaxies in a cluster have previously been in a group. This
raises important issues. The properties of galaxies now in rich clusters might have been largely
determined by the environmental interactions at the galaxy group stage.
These theoretical developments allow us toconnect togethersnapshots ofgalaxies in clusters
and groups at different epochs and give us the tools needed to create an empirical history of
cluster galaxy formation based on statistical arguments. Our understanding of the growth of
clusters also allows us to better trace the growth of the entropy of the intra-cluster medium and
to explain the nontrivial scaling of the entropy distribution with cluster mass.
The abundance of clusters is an encouraging cosmological probe. Cluster abundance should
vary strongly as a function of the cosmological power spectrum amplitude. Its evolution is a
strong function of the background cosmology as illustrated in >Fig. 6-14.
The difficulty with these constraints is that cluster masses are not measured directly, but
rather use proxy such as X-ray temperature, luminosity, or red galaxy content. Measurements

abundance, from Vikhlinin et al. (2009). The black (blue) lines distinguish cluster samples at high
and low redshift. Thetwo panelscompare predictions (lines) with observational data. Notethat the

based on the SZ effect may overcome some of the biases, but to make cutting-edge constraints
requires control of systematics at better than a 1% level. This may be possible in future surveys,
but it is clearly challenging to improve on the tight constraints that come from observations
of the cosmic microwave background. Cluster abundance constraints may have a stronger role
in constraining (or measuring) non-Gaussian distortion of the power spectrum. These cause
the growth rate of clusters to exceed (or lag behind) the rates estimated from the power spec-
trum and may provide significant insight into the nature of inflation or quintessence (Verde and
Matarrese 2009).

Summary and the Future
6.1 Summary
This has been a brief introduction to the scientific excitement of galaxy clusters. The picture
has changed considerably from the inception of cluster studies based on optical concentrations
of galaxies seen in photographic plates. We now realize that the major mass component of the
cluster is unseen. It has been revealed through careful dynamical measurements, the high pres-
sure of the intra-cluster plasma in galaxy clusters, and through the distortion of background
objects lensed by the gravitational mass of the system. Even amongst the baryonic component,
we now realize that the stars in galaxies in the cluster make up a minor contribution. Most of

the baryons in the cluster are in the diffuse, hot plasma that is trapped by the system’s gravita-
tional potential. Clusters of galaxies have given us much greater insight into the formation of
the universe than just their role as a laboratory for the interactions of galaxies.
In this introduction, we have looked at:
•
The optical properties and galaxies. I have emphasized the role clusters play as laboratories
for the interactions of galaxies with their environment. “Galaxy ecology” is rapidly gaining
momentum and understanding through the comparison of cluster (and group and field)
observations over a wide range of redshifts with theoretical models. The study has much to
tell us about how galaxies evolve and how star formation in the universe is suppressed.
•
X-ray emission and the intra-cluster medium. Clusters of galaxies offer unique insight,
because this material cannot be observed in lower mass systems such as the haloes of
individual galaxies. Although a “warm–hot intergalactic medium” is needed to reconcile
the observed abundance of galaxies and the cosmic baryon density, the WHIM cannot be
observed directly, because it is too cold for observation with standard techniques. The intra-
cluster medium offers us the best insight into the thermal history of most of the vast majority
of baryons in the universe.
•
Clusters of galaxies in their cosmological context. Clusters of galaxies also play an impor-
tant role in cosmology, allowing us to independently confirm the cosmological parameters
extracted from analysis of the cosmic microwave background. As the field progresses, the
two approaches may take on complementary roles allowing a deep study of the nature of
the initial fluctuations that seed galaxy formation in the universe.
Clusters of galaxies still offer a very promising avenue for these research goals and will con-
tinue to be the target of observing campaigns for many years to come. It will be exciting to see
the new twists that a new generation of astronomers brings to cluster research.

Active Galactic Nuclei
Abstract:
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent an extreme stage in the life cycle of a galaxy.
For a relatively short period of time (∼10years or less), a region less than a parsec across at
the center of a galaxy produces tremendous amounts of energy, often outshining the rest of
the galaxy by orders of magnitude. The most luminous of these objects are the most power-
ful, continuously emitting sources in the universe. The observational characteristics of AGN
are reviewed, as well as how these properties are used to sort them into different classes. The
evidence that supports the current paradigm, under which the central source powering AGN
is a supermassive black hole, is discussed. While these are found in virtually all bright galax-
ies, in AGN the black holes are actively accreting matter, most likely as a result of an increased
matter density in their immediate environs. A variety of accretion models are considered, par-
ticularly disk and Bondi accretion, along with the mechanisms by which material is carried
inward and angular momentum is dissipated. Photoionization models for the broad and nar-
row emission line regions are reviewed in detail, including the physical conditions that prevail
in each and their location relative to the central black hole. The evidence for unified models is
presented. Under unified models, different types of AGN are related by means of viewing angle.
A key aspect of these models is the presence of large-scale obscuring regions within the active
nucleus. The phenomenology of nuclear absorption is discussed, both within the torus as well
as in lines, along with present models for these obscuring regions. Also discussed are genera-
tion mechanisms for and the physics of relativistic jets, which are present in 10–20% of AGN.
Finally, the entire picture is brought together by discussing the evolution of AGN.

A Little History
It has been more than 100 years since the first evidence of nuclear activity in galaxies was first
discovered. Interestingly, this history proceeded parallel to – rather than after – the discovery
of the spiral nebulae themselves, and as with so many in astronomy, was at least partly the result
of serendipity. As pointed out by Osterbrock (1999) and Shields (1999), the first documented
observation of what today is called an active galactic nucleus was made by E. A. Fath in 1907
using the Lick 36-inch reflector telescope (Fath 1909). Fath was using a prism spectrograph
that he had built; as part of his thesis project, he obtained low-resolution spectra of seven spi-
ral nebulae, including M31. These observations required a titanic effort – his spectrum of M31
required 18 h of exposure. Most of his spectra were dominated by the same absorption lines
seen in stars. However, one spectrum stood out: that of NGC 1068, which showed emission
lines, more typical of planetary nebulae – what one would recognize today as Hβ; [O III] λλ
4363, 4959, 5007; [OII] λ 3727; and [Ne III] λ 3869. During the next two decades, several differ-
ent observers – notably Pease (1915), Moore (1915), Slipher (1917), and Hubble (1926) – also
noticed emission lines in spectra of NGC 1068, NGC 4151 (see, e.g., >Fig. 7-1), and NGC 4051.
Anothernine such objects were known bythe time that Carl K. Seyfert, then a National Research

A section of three of the early spectra of active galaxies, obtained using the Mt. Wilson 1.5 and
2.5 m telescopes by Carl Seyfert (1943, his Fig. 1). Note the bright Hβ and [O III] emission lines seen
in all three spectra
Council Postdoctoral Fellow, systematized the properties of what are now called Seyfert galax-
ies (Seyfert 1943). As Seyfert wrote, the “most consistent characteristic” of the class was “an
exceedingly luminous stellar or semistellar nucleus which contains a relatively large percentage
of the total light of the system.” He also pointed out that many of the anomalous emission lines
were amazingly wide – up to 10,000 km s−. >Figure 7-1 shows Seyfert’s spectra for three of
the earliest known AGN in the region around Hβ and [O III] λλ 4959, 5007. All three of these
lines are visible in each spectrum, although their strength and width vary significantly – a factor
discussed later in this chapter.
It was Seyfert’s work that first put forth the hypothesis that there was a distinct class of
galaxies whose properties were dominated by nuclear emissions. At nearly the same time as
Slipher, Pease, and Moore were undertaking their spectroscopic studies, Heber Curtis pointed
out in 1918 that the galaxy M87 exhibited a “curious straight ray…apparently connected with
the nucleus by a thin line of matter.” At the time, Curtis’s discovery was not connected to
the spectroscopic evidence mentioned above – it took a large number of other discoveries for
this to happen. The key development in this regard was the development of radio astronomy
as a discipline. As is well known, the first receiver sensitive enough to receive cosmic radio
emissions was built by Karl Jansky in the 1920s. Jansky, who at the time was working at Bell

Laboratories, was conducting a study of the sources of static in trans-Atlantic communications
(Jansky 1932). His records showed two types of interference: thunderstorms and a persistent
hiss that moved around in azimuth every 24 h and precessed through the sky seasonally. After
further study, (Jansky 1933, 1935) concluded that the radiation came from the centerand disk of
the Milky Way galaxy. During the next decade, the first radio maps and surveys of the sky were
done (Reber 1940a, b; Ryle and Smith 1948). By 1950, three radio sources had been identified
with external galaxies (Bolton et al. 1949), namely, Virgo A (M87), Cygnus A, and Centau-
rus A (NGC 5128). Each of these objects was later identified optically as an active galaxy. This
pointed out another facet of the AGN phenomenon – namely, that a substantial fraction have
well-collimated outflows that extend out for many kiloparsecs from the nuclear regions.
Radio astronomy continued to play a role in defining our knowledge of active galaxies dur-
ing the next two decades, as two bright radio sources, namely, 3C 273 and 3C 48, were the first
two objects found to have systemic redshifts greater than 0.1 (Hazard et al. 1963; Schmidt 1963;
Oke 1963; Greenstein and Matthews 1963). While initially there was some controversy about
the nature of these redshifts (respectively 0.16 and 0.37), with some suggesting bizarre config-
urations such as galactic stars with a high density and hence a large gravitational redshift, the
least objectional interpretation was that the redshifts were cosmological; however, this would
require extreme optical luminosities for these objects, 10–30 times that of the brightest elliptical
galaxy, and total emitted energies as high as 10ergs (Greenstein and Schmidt 1963).

Fundamental Properties of AGN
As can be seen by the previous discussion, the class of objects which today are called active
galactic nuclei (or AGN) displays a rather complex phenomenology. These properties include
not only bright emission lines but also strong continua (both thermal and nonthermal), X-ray,
and radio emission. In this section, the observational properties of AGN are discussed, along
with the taxonomy that has been developed through the years to describe subclasses.
2.1 Overall Continuum Shape
One of the distinguishing characteristics of AGN is a strong continuum that stretches from
at least the infrared through hard X-rays, and in some cases up to gamma-ray energies.
In >Fig. 7-2, two examples of the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGN are
shown. The SEDs of AGN are very different from those of typical galaxies: instead of displaying
two main peaks (in the optical and far-IR, respectively, from starlight and cool dust emission) a
much broader distribution is seen, with nearly equal power per decade from millimeter wave-
lengths through X-rays. For this reason, it is typical to characterize the spectra of AGN over a
broad range of frequencies as a power law of the form Fν ∝ν−α, where α is the spectral index.
α = corresponds to a flat spectrum in Fν, whereas α = describes a spectrum in which the
luminosity is constant in every decade of frequency, similar to the situation seen in >Fig. 7-2
over the infrared to soft X-rays.
Two other features seen in > Fig. 7-2 are immediately obvious: the local maxima in the
ultraviolet and mid-infrared, displayed in both SEDs. The first of these, often referred to as the
“big blue bump,” has a remarkably similar shape in most AGN, with a peak in the far-UV and

their Fig. 1))
a typical UV spectral index of α = .(Zheng et al. 1998; Scott et al. 2004). This translates
to a U-B color of <−0.3, far bluer than that seen in “passive” galaxies and also bluer than all
stellar populations except hot white dwarfs. This same characteristic also gives AGN spectra
between the UV and X-rays a very characteristic shape, with spectral indices αOX clustered
tightly between 1.2 and 1.8 (Tang et al. 2007). As discussed later on in this chapter, the UV
bump is often interpreted in terms of emission from an accretion disk surrounding a central
black hole (e.g., Shang et al. 2005 and references therein). The second “hump,” believed to be
due to thermal emission from warm dust at greater distances from the central engine, has a
much more diverse morphology, with dust temperatures seen from tens to thousands of Kelvin,
and often includes multiple components.
Emission is also seen in other bands, including a strong high-energy continuum in X-rays
as well as radio emission. The strong X-ray emission is a property shared by both SEDs which,
as shown later on in this chapter, is a characteristic common to all AGN, although strong obscu-
ration in some objects can impair our ability to see this component. The radio luminosity of the
two SEDs shown in >Fig. 7-2 differ radically, however, by more than 3 orders of magnitude
relative to the emission seen in other bands. This points out what is known as the radio-
loud/radio-quiet dichotomy, a subject that will be explored in depth later on in this chapter.

2.2 Emission and Absorption Lines in the Optical – UV
As already discussed,one of the original, distinguishing characteristics of AGN was their bright
emission lines. These lines are the dominant feature of AGN spectra in the optical-UV, as shown
in >Fig. 7-3, which was generated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey’s quasar sample (Van den
Berk et al. 2001). As can be seen, many bright lines are present, including the Hydrogen Lyman
and Balmer series as well as lines of various ionized metal species, such as MgII, CIII, CIV, OIII,
etc. Near-IR observations reveal similar lines.
The lines come in two categories: broad (FWHM > 1,000 km s−) and narrow (FWHM <
1,000 km s−). Generally speaking, it is the permitted lines (e.g., Ly α, C IV λ 1549, C III λ 1909,
Mg II λ 2798, Hα, Hβ) which are observed to be broad, while forbidden lines (e.g., [O III]
λλ 4959, 5007; [OII] λ 3727) are observed to be narrow – although many or most permitted
lines are also observed to have a narrow core. The widths of these emission lines are gener-
ally interpreted as Doppler shifts, and thus indicative of gas motions in the producing regions.
These emission lines are very different from what is normally found in external galaxies, as seen
in >Fig. 7-4, which shows the spectrum of Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies, as well as a LINER (low-
ionization emission region) galaxy, a BL Lacertae object (see >Sect. 3), broad- and narrow-line
radio galaxies (BLRG and NLRG, respectively), as well as a normal galaxy.
The differences between the main AGN spectral types is reasonably obvious – no broad
lines are found in Seyfert 2s or NLRG, while LINERS have predominantly narrow lines, but
only in low-ionization states (their lines are generally less broad as well), and the BL Lac objects

Optical spectrum of several diﬀerent types of active galaxies as compared to a normal elliptical.
Note the strong emission lines present in all types except the BL Lacs and LINERs, where they are
either weaker or absent. Note also that narrow-line objects completely lack the broad lines found
in Seyfert 1 or BLRG-type objects (Figure taken from Keel, http://astronomy.ua.edu/keel/agn)
show a nearly complete lack of emission lines. What is not shown in >Fig. 7-4, however, is that
the same narrow lines are seen also in starburst galaxies, where they originate in HII regions
surrounding hot stars. Therefore, in identifying AGN, one does need to be careful. Veilleux
and Osterbrock (1987) proposed to use the line strengths of five commonly found features to
distinguish between Seyferts, LINERS, and HII (Starburst) galaxies. This procedure, illustrated
in >Fig. 7-5, is quite efficient at sorting objects into AGN and nonactive objects, although there
is some overlap. These “transition objects” indicate a possible link between the two phenomena.
The fact that there exists a significant population of AGN without broad emission lines was
for many years a source of significant controversy in the field. Various attempts were made to
explain these objects as being less luminous, but these were unsuccessful, as the bolometric
luminosity of Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies are similar. As discussed later, however, comparing the
broadband spectra of Seyfert 1 and 2 objects, one sees the evidence of significant obscuration,
as not only are the broad lines missing in Seyfert 2s but their optical spectra are redder, and they
are also brighter in the mid-infrared (where any AGN light would be reradiated). This divide
became the genesis of unified schemes, which will be discussed in >Sect. 3.
The emission lines ofAGN not onlyindicate the presence ofa powerful ionizing and exciting
source in the center, they also indicate the presence of high-velocity gas surrounding the cen-
tral source. There is a strong dependency on the equivalent width of many lines on luminosity

⊡Fig. 7-5
Diagnostic diagrams for all nuclear emission line galaxies with published line ratios, excluding
objects with a composite spectrum. Note that Seyfert 1, Seyfert 2, and LINER galaxies separate
relatively neatly into the drawn regions, which are determined empirically. A few Seyfert 2s with
weak [N II] lines appear outside the region assigned to Seyfert 2s. A few other objects falling in
“intermediate” regions deserve a more detailed study (Figure taken from Veron-Cetty and Veron
(2000, their Fig. 3))
(Yip et al. 2004), in the sense that more luminous objects tend to have relatively weaker lines.
They can also be used to diagnose the physical state of the material in the regions producing
the lines – as will be investigated in more detail later in this chapter. >Figure 7-6, also taken
from the SDSS, shows an expanded view, revealing the enormous variety of lines seen in AGN
spectra. Many of the lines are blended, so to get quality diagnostics, often high resolution and
signal to noise are needed. In addition to the bright emission lines, one also sees other inter-
esting features. In particular, one sees in some of the broad emission lines a “P Cygni” type of
profile – that is, the emission line is redshifted, and the blue wing exhibits strong absorption,
often with a complex profile. This spectral morphology, seen in about 10% of quasars (known
as “broad absorption line” or BAL quasars, discussed in >Sect. 6.2), is similar to those seen
in Be type stars such as their namesake, P Cygni, and in those objects they are interpreted as
being due to an outflow, with the emission lines originating in the outermost shell, which is seen
relatively unabsorbed, while the absorption lines originating in the portion of the wind that is
approaching us. The same interpretation is invoked for AGN as well.
2.3 Radio Emission and the Radio-Loud/Radio-Quiet Divide
The SEDs of AGN come in both radio-loud and radio-quiet varieties, as shown in >Fig. 7-2.
Typical radio-loud AGN have radio continuum emission that is about 1,000 times brighter,
relative to the IR-UV continuum, than a typical radio-quiet AGN. However, radio-quiet objects
are significantly more numerous, amounting to 80–90% of all AGN.

In contrast to the continuum at higher energies (far-infrared up to far-UV), which is
believed to be dominated by thermal emission from various components of the AGN struc-
ture, the radio emission must have a nonthermal origin ( >Sect. 7). The radio emission from
both radio-quiet and radio-loud AGN are roughly power law in shape and display remarkably
similar spectral slopes, with α ∼.being typical of the extended structure, while α ∼is more
typical of the compact, core components. The radio emission is often linearly polarized (both
in the extended and core components), with degrees of polarization that can reach into the tens
of percent.
2.3.1 Radio-Loud Versus Radio-Quiet: A True Bimodality?
Traditionally, the radio-loud/radio-quiet break has been drawn in terms of the ratio between
the emission at 5 GHz and that in the blue (rest frame), with the dividing line being at a ratio
R ≡FGHz/F,Å > (Kellermann et al. 1989; Stocke et al. 1992). The main reason why
this ratio was chosen was observational – AGN were historically found by surveys in the UV or
X-ray band, with radio loudness being established by correlating with a radio survey. Up until
the last 10 years, the best data showed a bimodality in R, with very few objects having R ∼–10.
However, more recent data are divided on this issue, and it is not certain whether this division
represents a true bimodality or is a product of observational biases in the surveys (see Cirasuolo
et al. 2003; Ivezic et al. 2002, 2004 for both sides of this debate, as well as >Fig. 7-7). What is
clear is that the fraction of radio-loud objects appears to depend strongly on both the optical
luminosity and redshift, with the RLF at z = .declining from ∼24.3% to 5.6% (from a sample
of 4472 SDSS/FIRST quasars) as luminosity decreases from M,= −to −22 and the RLF at
M,= −declining from 24.3% to 4.1% as redshift increases from 0.5 to 3 (Jiang et al. 2007).
It is also somewhat unclear what produces this dichotomy, real or not. Sikora et al. (2007)
pointed out that there appear to be distinct radio-loud and radio-quiet sequences in the Edding-
ton ratio versus radio-loudness plane, with both sequences showing a similar dependence of R
on Eddington ratio. This led them to suggest that the main difference between the two was the
spin of the central black hole, a view more recently backed up by general relativity simulations of
jet formation in high and low spin environments (Tchekhovskoy et al. 2010; see also >Sect. 7).
An alternate view (Körding et al. 2006, 2008) is that the radio-loud and radio-quiet popula-
tions represent two different accretion states in a continuum of AGN. The idea behind this
latter scenario is the behavior of X-ray binaries, which are known to switch between several
states, with the same objects sometimes exhibiting radio jets and sometimes not, depending on
their positions in an (X-ray) hardness/intensity diagram. Radio jets are only ejected from X-ray
binaries when they are in the high-intensity and hard X-ray spectrum part of the diagram. As
the timescales for phenomena around black holes should scale with the mass, one would not
expect to be able to observe objects to switch from radio-loud to radio-quiet behavior. Impor-
tantly, however, the two scenarios given here may not be mutually exclusive, as pointed out by
Sikora et al. (2007); it may be that the black hole spin governs the efficiency of the jet production
process, but that a second factor may determine whether a jet is produced.
2.3.2 Radio Morphology
The radio morphology of active galaxies is quite varied, but several characteristics appear
common to a variety of classes. Typically, one sees highly collimated outflows on one or both

sides of the nucleus, terminating in diffuse lobes. These lobes are often far larger than the galaxy
in which the active nucleus resides and can extend for many hundreds of kiloparsecs. Several
classic examples are shown in >Fig. 7-8. 3C 341 and Cygnus A are examples of Fanaroff-Riley
type II (FR II) sources: highly luminous (the classical definition is PMHz > W Hz−,
as laid out by Fanaroff and Riley (1974)), with lobes that have an edge-brightened morphol-
ogy, terminate in hotspots, and have fairly straight large-scale morphology. Less powerful
sources (PMHz < W Hz−) do not have as extreme a morphology. Two examples of
these Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) sources are shown in > Fig. 7-8, namely, M87 and 3C 31.
The morphological differences between FR I and FR IIs are obvious: while both classes show
jets that extend for many kiloparsecs, in FR Is, one sees obvious bends and a much more
edge-dimmed morphology than seen in FR IIs, usually with one or both lobes lacking obvious
hotspots.

Images of the nuclear regions of BL Lacertae over several years. Motions for several components
are pointed out. Note that at the distance of BL Lacertae, 1mas = 1.381pc, so that an angular speed
of 1 mas year−1 works out to an apparent speed of 4c (Figure from Mutel et al. (1990, their Fig. 1))
The jets of both FR I and FR II radio sources are collimated on small scales (within 1 pc
of the central engine; see >Sect. 7) and carry a major fraction of the kinetic flux and angular
momentum (>Sect. 4) generated by the central source with them. They affect the host galaxies
of the AGN quite significantly as well, often triggering star formation in their path as well as
other shocks, as witnessed by optical emission line shocks near the path of the jets in nearby
radio galaxies, as well as the high-redshift “alignment effect” (see
>Chap. 11).
An important property of relativistic jets is that they display apparent superluminal motion
on parsec scales. An example is shown in >Fig. 7-9 for the prototype BL Lac object, BL Lacertae.
As can be seen, several components are tracked over more than 10 years; each is apparently
moving at several times the speed of light.

Geometry illustrating relativistic eﬀects in jets
This is actually a relativistic effect. The geometry is shown in >Fig. 7-10, with an object
moving at speed v at a small angle θ to the line of sight. The time of origin is chosen arbitrarily
as t = . At time t = te, the component has moved a distance vte. As shown, the observed
separation will be the transverse component of the distance,
Δr = vte sin θ
(7.1)
However at time te, the component has moved both in the transverse direction as well as along
our line of sight and is closer to Earth than at t = 0. Photons emitted at times t = and t = te
will reach us at times separated by
Δt = te −vte sin θ
c
= te (−β cos θ)
(7.2)
where β = v/c is the velocity in units of the speed of light. Thus if ( > 7.1) and ( > 7.2) are
divided, the apparent velocity is obtained:
vapp = Δr
Δt =
v sin θ
−β cos θ
(7.3)
This result was first pointed out by Sir Martin Rees in 1966 (Rees 1966) – a full decade before
it was first observed. There are two results here: first of all, the observed velocity is a function
both of the true velocity as well as the direction of the motion relative to our line of sight,
and second, that (through a trick of geometry) it is possible to observe speeds that seem to
be faster than that of light without an object ever actually traveling faster than light. Further
exploration of equation (> 7.3) shows that a maximum velocity is found at a value sin θmax =
/Γ, where γ is the Lorentz factor Γ = (−v/c)
−/. (It should be noted that very often in
the literature one sees the capital letters as referring to bulk motion within the jet, whereas
particle velocities are expressed by small letters. This convention is adopted herein). When the
viewing angle θ = θmax, the apparent velocity is then vapp = Γv. Thus it is quite possible for us to
observe speeds much larger than c, as in M87. In fact, speeds as high as 40c have been observed
in high-frequency VLBI observations of BL Lac objects (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2001, 2005).

2.4 Infrared Emission
The infrared emissions of active galaxies have been studied with a number of tools. However, the
increased sensitivity of Spitzer, combined with the angular resolution possible with 10-m class
ground-based telescopes, has spawned a revolution over the last decade. In the infrared, one
finds much of the power emitted by AGN – typically upwards of 25%, as shown by >Fig. 7-2.
This fraction varies from 10% at a minimum to more than 50% in some objects, depending
on the amount of obscuration within the AGN as well as the amount of star formation in the
surrounding galaxy. Here the latter topic, which is studied in detail in the
>Chap. 11, is not
discussed; however, it does bear mentioning in the global sense. Infrared light in AGN typically
originates in warm dust, which is believed to be heated by the central AGN and also obscuring
some fraction of its emission, as discussed further in >Sect. 3.
The continuum emission of AGN in the infrared is characterized by three main features.
These include (i) a minimum at ∼1–2 μm, corresponding to the sublimation temperature of
the most refractory dust (1,000–2,000 K, depending on the composition of the dust grains);
(ii) an “IR bump,” somewhere between a few up to 100 μm. This bump can have a variety of
morphologies, from a narrow, nearly single-temperature blackbody shape in some objects to
a flat morphology that requires multiple emitting components. This component is due to the
thermal emission of dust, with temperaturesusually between 50 and 1,000 K, and in radio-quiet
objects, (iii) a steep decline (α > ) at large wavelengths, typical of the low energy spectrum of a
gray emitter (Chini et al. 1989). This latter feature is not present in radio-loud objects, wherein
the far-infrared and submillimeter nonthermal emission (discussed in > Sects. 2.3 and >7)
takes over.
Underlying the seemingly simple picture described above is a considerable amount of com-
plexity. There are a broad range of spectral features in the infrared, and moreover, the mid-IR is
alsothe site ofa great deal ofspatial complexitywithin the central regions ofboth the host galaxy
as well as the AGN. In >Fig. 7-11, average mid-IR spectra of Seyferts and starburst galaxies are
shown, as well as six example spectra. Several things are seen in this figure. Both the Seyfert
and starburst spectra possess an overarching thermal continuum, as already discussed above;
however, the typical starburst possesses a considerable amount of additional cold gas, likely due
to the massive amounts of star formation going on within it. Also seen in the Seyfert spectra are
forbidden lines from high-ionization species, notably [Ne V] and [O IV]. This is a strong sign of
a powerful exciting source in the nucleus. Also present in all of the spectra are molecular emis-
sion features, notably those due to PAH molecules. These indicate that the dusty regions that
emit in the mid-IR are rich in molecular gas and also that it is not easy to completely separate
the AGN from the surrounding host galaxy in this band, either physically or phenomenolog-
ically. The final set of features that are notable in all of the spectra shown in >Fig. 7-11 are a
pair of features due to dusty silicates, the first located at 10 μm and the second at 18 μm. These
are seen in absorption in some objects, notably Sey 2s, while in Sey 1s, they are typically seen
in emission.
The stable, low-noise nature of the space environment gives space-based telescopes an enor-
mous advantage when it comes to sensitivity. Ground-based telescopes are limited by thermal
emission from the Earth’s atmosphere as well as molecular features from atmospheric mate-
rial, neither of which are a factor in space, where the background is orders of magnitude
lower. Unfortunately, however, Spitzer was only a 0.85-m telescope, and as a result it does
not have the angular resolution to separate the inner regions of the AGN from the nearby
regions of the surrounding galaxy. To accomplish this task, one must currently resort to imag-
ing and spectroscopy with ground-based telescopes, which are essentially diffraction limited

in the 10- and 20-μm windows. With ground-based 8–10-m class telescopes, angular resolu-
tions ∼0.3′′ at 10 μm can be reached, a factor of 10 better than what Spitzer is capable of. In the
mid-IR, JWST will be capable of similar resolution once launched, but much greater sensitivity;
however, it will lack polarimetric capability.
An example of this work is shown in >Fig. 7-12 for the prototype Sey 2 NGC 1068 (Mason
et al. 2006). The spectra cover the nucleus and central 6.0′′ × 0.4′′ of the ionization cones. The
spectra extracted in 0.4′′ (∼30 pc) steps along the slit reveal striking variations in continuum
slope, silicate feature profile and depth, and fine structure line fluxes, illustrating the complexity
of the circumnuclear regions of this galaxy at MIR wavelengths. A comparison of photometry
in various apertures reveals two distinct components: a compact (radius <15 pc), bright source
within the central 0.4′′ × 0.4′′ and extended, lower brightness emission. The compact source
is identified as the torus (see > Sect. 6 for discussion) and the diffuse component as warm
or hot, AGN-heated dust located mostly in the ionization cones ( >Sect. 4). While the torus
emission dominates the flux observed in the NIR, the MIR flux measured with apertures larger
than about 1′′ is dominated instead by the dust emission from the ionization cones; in spite of
its higher brightness, the torus contributes <30% of the 11.6-μm flux contained in the central
1.2′′. Thus if one attempts to determine the torus SED using space-based data alone, one is sig-
nificantly compromised by contamination from the extended emission. Mid-IR interferometry

emission axis (PA 20○). All positions are relative to the mid-IR peak. Black and gray lines refer
to two diﬀerent epochs. Note how the shape of the spectrum changes within the 7.5–13-μm
window – both the depth of the silicate feature (shaded region) as well as the luminosity of emis-
sion lines (e.g., [S IV] 10.5 µm and [Ar III] 8.99 µm) vary. This emphasizes how critical it is to attain
high angular resolution when studying the AGN in mid-IR (Figure taken from Mason et al. (2006,
their Fig. 2))
(Poncelet et al. 2006; Jaffe et al. 2004) also supports a very small central obscuring source for
NGC 1068, placing a severe limit of only ∼3 pc on its size. Work on a variety of other sources is
showing similar results: the nuclear obscuration in AGN is concentrated in the innermost few
parsecs (e.g., Radomski et al. 2003, 2008; Packham et al. 2005; Roche et al. 2006, 2007; Meisen-
heimer et al. 2007; Tristram et al. 2007, 2009; Poncelet et al. 2007, 2008), although in a few
sources, more extended nuclear dust is seen (e.g., IC 5063, Young et al. 2007). This places severe
constraints on unification models, as discussed in >Sect. 6, and also directly links the regions
of heaviest mid-IR obscuration to the observations of water masers by Greenhill et al. (1996)
(discussed below).
2.5 X-Ray and Higher-Energy Emission
The X-ray and gamma-ray properties of active galactic nuclei are complex. Emission is seen
from the galactic absorption cutoff at ∼0.1 keV up to a few hundred keV. This emission contains

reﬂection component is also shown. The most relevant narrow feature is the iron Kα emission line

the signature of a number of processes, discussed in this section. >Figure 7-13 summarizes the
various emission and absorption components that tend to be present in AGN X-ray spectra.
At zeroth order, the intrinsic continuum shape is a power law that extends from about 1 keV
to over 100 keV. The typical spectral index of this power law is between α = .and α = , both
for lower luminosity Seyfert galaxies as well as quasars. A somewhat flatter spectral shape is
seen for radio-loud AGN, typically between α = .and α = .. These spectral indices are
remarkably constant with redshift, according to work done on the SDSS AGN (Green et al.
2009). The difference between radio-loud and radio-quiet X-ray spectral slopes is believed to
be due to the additional inverse-Compton scattering taking place within the jet’s inner regions.
BeppoSAX spectra reveal that this power law cuts off exponentially at energies between 80 and
300 keV for most AGN, with the exception of some radio-loud objects (in particular blazars,
which will be discussed later).
Further examination reveals that considerable complexity underlies this power law. At the
soft end of the spectrum, one often observes a quasi-thermal component (the so-called soft
excess), with characteristic temperature kT ∼.–1 keV. A second feature is seen between 10
and 50 keV, namely, a “hump” believed to be due to Compton reflection in the accretion disk’s
corona (see >Sect. 4.3). Tied to this reflection “hump” is a warm absorber component seen
in about ∼50% of Seyfert 1 galaxies. This feature is quite complex, featuring a variety of line

322 7

features, most notably “edges” due to hydrogen and helium-like oxygen, but also a wide variety
of other highly ionized species, visible in deep, higher-resolution spectra. A variety of emission
lines are also present in these objects. Most prominent among the emission lines is the Fe Kα
line at a rest energy of 6.4 keV; however, a number of other emission lines are also seen in deep,
higher-resolution spectra, including K- and L-shell features of iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium
and other elements. An example of a high-resolution spectrum is shown in >Fig. 7-14.
These generalities apply to many objects; however, in a large number of AGN, one sees
absorption much heavier than galactic. Obscuration in the X-rays can be due to photoelec-
tric absorption (which dominates below a few keV) and Compton scattering (dominant above
7 keV). The observed spectral properties will depend on the amount of absorbing material
present along our line of sight: column densities below ∼.×cm−produce a cutoff at ener-
gies between 1 and 10 keV, with higher-energy cutoffs observed in more obscured objects. In
this case, the source is called “Compton thin.” However, at higher column densities, the source
is optically thick (and hence faint) up to several tens of keV. In this case the source is called
“Compton thick,” and the main spectral features seen are a prominent Fe Ka line with equiv-
alent width ∼1–3 keV and a reflected and/or scattered continuum. For less obscured sources,
the Fe Kα line typically has a much lower equivalent width. These properties are summarized
in >Fig. 7-15.
2.6 Variability
Another important property of AGN is their variability, a property first discovered in the late
1960s (Cannon et al. 1968; Kinman 1968; Pacholczyk and Wyemann 1968; Barnes 1968; Selove
1969; Zaitseva and Lyutyi 1969; Babadzhanyants and Hagen-Thorn 1969) in the optical, and
a couple years later in the radio (Stull 1970; Ross 1970). This variability has since been found
to extend to all wavebands (see Ulrich et al. 1997 for a review), in both continuum and line
emission. Variability in AGN is seen on all timescales (see >Fig. 7-16 for examples), ranging
from years down to days, with a variety of amplitudes as well. In some objects (BL Lacs and
blazars), violent variability is a defining characteristic, with flux varying by factors of several in
short time periods.
Variability on such short timescales puts tight constraints on the size of the emitting region –
since nothing can move faster than the speed of light, an object that varies within a few days
must be no larger than a few light-days in diameter. This topic will be discussed in depth below,
along with the nature of the central object and the need for a black hole. However, it is worth-
while to mention at this time that the variability of AGN is one of the strongest reasons behind
the fact that an alternate model, advocated by Terlevich et al. (1992), is not well regarded in the
literature. Under the Terlevich et al. model, AGN are viewed as giant young stellar clusters, and
variability must be explained as the result of nova and supernova explosions generating rapidly
evolving remnants due to the interaction between their ejecta and a high density circumstellar
environment. This model is supported by the overall similarity of the optical spectra and com-
pact supernova remnants (e.g., Filippenko 1989). What this model has difficulty explaining is
not the overall character of the variations (Aretxaga and Terlevich 1994; Cristiani et al. 1996),
which can be explained by a combination of complicated processes that could arise either in the
structure discussed in this chapter or in separate, interstellar processes such as novae or super-
novae, but rather the combination of small variability timescale and massive luminosity. For
quasars, the variability properties seen require that more than 10solar luminosities, spanning

ing such large variations by a series of supernova-related explosions requires an extreme stellar
density, large enough that the cluster would be unstable to gravitational collapse over short
timescales.
Importantly, AGN variability is often correlated across wavebands (e.g.,
> Fig. 7-17).
This indicates that the processes responsible for the emission in these different bands
must be connected somehow. Interestingly, however, the variability seen in different bands,

The Overall Structure: Uniﬁed Models
With the large zoo of AGN properties outlined in the previous section, there is a strong moti-
vation to explain them all through a single, unified structure that has a minimum of different
features. It was out of this desire that unified schemes were born. From the outset it was clear
that any unified scheme had to be able to generate the massive luminosity observed within a
small region – light-days or smaller. The scheme also had to be reasonably stable for millions
of years. That last fact rules out any origin in a collection of normal stars (as proposed by Ter-
levich in 1992), as the generation of up to 10solar luminosities by thermonuclear fusion would
require of order 10solar masseswithin that small volume (thus being unstable to gravitational
collapse in a very short time) and would have no way to explain the variability without positing
the existence of novae or supernovae. The modern view centers around a supermassive black
hole and posits a nonaxisymmetric system, where the properties observed depend entirely on
the perspective.

a timescale of weeks and months breaks down at long (years) and short (days) timescales (Ulrich
et al. (1997), their Fig. 3)
3.1 The Basic Scheme
The basic structure, illustrated in >Fig. 7-18, is seen in both radio-loud and radio-quiet objects
and features a supermassive black hole at the center, accreting material, possibly (although not
necessarily; see >Sect. 4) through a disk. Accretion is an elegant way to generate enormous
luminosities within the small volumes required by the observed variability as it offers the poten-
tial of converting up to half of the gravitational potential energy from accreting matterinto light
and heat in the process. Surrounding the accretion disk are various layers of warm gas, which
would explain the broad and narrow emission line features. These two sets of gas clouds need
to be located at vastly different distances from the central black hole, because, as indicated in
future discussion, detailed modeling indicates that the physical conditions in the two regions
are vastly different.
A critical feature of this model is the presence of a large-scale obscuration region.
>Figure 7-18 illustrates this obscuration as having a uniform, optically and geometrically thick
toroidal structure, which is the simplest model. However, this geometryis bynomeans required,
and in fact the most modern data indicate that a patchy geometry may be more likely, as dis-
cussed in >Sect. 6. This obscuration region would need to be dusty and possibly molecular
gas-rich, but whateverits geometry, has gained the name “torus” in the literature. Its key feature
is to obscure the view of the broad-line clouds from some points of view. Objects that are viewed
through the dusty, obscuring clouds would be seen to have Seyfert 2 type spectra, whether with
or without a radio jet, while objects viewed at a more direct angle would have broad-line spec-
tra, more typical of Seyfert 1s. Intermediate objects would be possible depending on how much
obscuring material was along our line of sight.

⊡Fig. 7-18
The basic structure for active galaxies as postulated by uniﬁed schemes. This ﬁgure is not to scale,
nor is the geometry for all regions settled, as discussed in the text. Nevertheless, it illustrates the
basic geometry and aspect-dependent nature of the scheme (Figure courtesy of P. Padovani)
The final piece of this picture, present only for radio-loud objects, is bipolar jets that emerge
from the nuclear regions at relativistic speeds. For objects where the jet was seen close to our
line of sight, relativity would increase the apparent luminosity of the source so that the source
was dominated by the jet properties. The result in this case would be what is known as a
blazar, a radio-loud object with weaker or no emission lines, apparent superluminal motion
and extreme variability. The most extreme of these observationally are the BL Lacertae objects,
which are distinguished by their featureless optical spectra (see example in >Fig. 7-4). Under
unified schemes, BL Lacs represent low-luminosity, FR 1 radio galaxies viewed at small angles
to the jet axis, while a subclass of quasars, the FSRQ or flat-spectrum radio quasars (also called
OVV or optically violent variables), represent the FR 2 radio galaxies viewed at small angles to
the jet axis. FSRQ are more luminous than BLLacs and donot have theirfeatureless optical spec-
tra but share with BL Lacs the properties of superluminal motion and violent multiwaveband
variability.
Special relativity has a number of important consequences for high-velocity jets. A lit-
tle manipulation will show that a number of other interesting effects are observed for a
relativistically approaching object (i.e., a jet component). The observed is also distorted

for these sources, as are the frequencies of the radiation observed:
Δtapp = δ−Δt
(7.4)
vapp = δv
(7.5)
where the commonly used Doppler factor is δ = [Γ(−β cos θ)]−. However, perhaps most
importantly, the luminosity one would infer (if one naively assumes uniform illumination over
4π steradians) differs greatly from that truly emitted:
Lapp = δ pL
(7.6)
where the exponent p depends on the source’s morphology and spectral index α. This last rela-
tion, often referred to as Doppler boosting or beaming, arises because the product of intensity
and frequency cubed, Iν, can be shown to be a Lorentz invariant. For a spherical source,
p = + α, whereas for a cylindrical morphology, p = + α. Thus for a relatively modest
bulk Lorentz factor γbulk = , it is possible to infer luminosities up to 10,000 times higher
if one is in the beaming cone. In >Fig. 7-19, all three of these effects are plotted (along with

angles, and even for relatively modest values of γ, one can easily obtain significant Doppler
boosting.
3.2 Evidence for Type 1/Type 2 Uniﬁcation
The evidence supporting this view, known variously as AGN unification or the unified scheme, is
strong and comes from a variety of avenues. In this section and the next, some of the strongest
evidence for unified schemes is described.
If indeed the broad-line region of Sey 2 galaxies is hidden from view by dusty obscuration
regions, one would expect to be able to directly detect evidence of silicates in the infrared spec-
tra of these objects, as well as emission features from molecular features such as PAH and H.
Observations of numerous type 2 AGN with Spitzer have revealed direct evidence of these fea-
tures. >Figure 7-20 shows an example of such a spectrum (Armus et al. 2006), specifically for
the Seyfert 2 NGC 6240. As can be seen, this spectrum shows strong silicate absorption features
around 10 and 18 μm. Equally important, these same features are detectedin emission in Seyfert
1s, exactly as would be predicted if dust clouds are obscuring our view of the central regions in
these objects.
It should be noted, however, that while the Spitzer spectra just mentioned indicate the pres-
ence of an optically thick obscuring structure, they do not say anything about what is being
obscured. Thus a second piece of evidence is required. This is provided by spectropolarimetry
(Antonucci and Miller 1985; Antonucci 1983; Miller et al. 1991). Spectropolarimetry is a key
diagnostic becauseit takes advantage of the fact that the obscuring region will scattersome frac-
tion of the background region’s light, and this scattered light will be polarized. >Figure 7-21
shows the detection of this scattered light for the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 (Antonucci and
Miller 1985). As can be seen, while the total intensity spectrum of this object shows only very
weak Hβ and other Balmer lines, the broadness of these features is not obvious in total intensity.
However, a completely different picture emerges in the polarized light spectrum, where broad
Balmer lines typical of type 1 objects are seen, while the narrow [O III] lines are unchanged in
strength. This directly indicates that the light intercepted and scattered by the dust in the torus,
comes from the broad-line region.
Subsequent observations have revealed polarized broad-line emission in many other type 2
objects, both radio-loud and radio-quiet. In radio-loud objects, there is additional information,
allowing us to infer the orientation of this obscuring medium relative to the radio jets. For
example, in 3C 234 (Antonucci 1984) and IC 5063, scattered broad-line emission is detected,
with the plane of polarization being perpendicular to the axis of the jets. This is expected if a
type 1 nucleus is at least partially obscured by optically thick dust clouds whose axis coincides
with the radio jet axis. Interestingly, spectroscopy of narrow-line radio galaxies also reveals
that the luminosity of the obscured region is quasar-like (e.g., di Serego Alighieri et al. 1994;
Goodrich and Cohen 1992; Antonucci et al. 1994, 1996), although not all NLRG have polarized
optical broad lines (in particular Cygnus A, Jackson and Tadhunter 1993, although Antonucci
et al. 1994 suggested that this may be due to dilution by the local optical continuum at the
scattering site).

3.3 Blazars, Jets, and Uniﬁed Schemes for Radio-Loud AGN
As has been seen, when an emitting plasma is moving at speeds close to that of light, relative
to a fixed observer, a number of special relativistic effects are observed. Among these are
superluminal motion as well as relativistic beaming. Therefore an important element in the

verification of unified schemes is to see whether radio galaxies contain evidence of relativistic
phenomena. This can be done in two ways: both by searching directly for those phenomena
as well as by looking at the luminosity functions of both radio galaxies (known as the parent
population under unified schemes) and blazars to see if the introduction of a simple relativis-
tic beaming term can reproduce the features. In addition, since relativistic beaming is thought
to explain the rapid variations and high polarizations observed in blazars and is also required
to explain their GeV and TeV emission (Maraschi et al. 1992); these properties must also be
present in unbeamed radio galaxies, albeit at lower levels.
Superluminal motion and violent variability have been observed in the radio galaxy M87,
an FR 1 which is believed to be a misdirected BL Lacertae object (Tsvetanov et al. 1998; Har-
ris et al. 2003). >Figure 7-22 shows two important results from multiyear monitoring of M87
with the HST, Chandra and VLA. Several regions of the M87 jet show apparent superluminal
motion, most prominently in HST-1, a knot located 60 pc (projected distance) from the core.
As shown in >Fig. 7-22 (left-hand panels), in this region four optical knots have been observed
with apparent motions at speeds of ∼6c (Biretta et al. 1999). Somewhat slower speeds have been
found in the radio for this region, as high as 4.3c (Cheung et al. 2007; Biretta et al. 1995), albeit
not over the same 1994–1998 time period. Superluminal speeds have also been found in optical
observations of several other regions of the M87 jet, out to about 10′′ (780 pc) from the nucleus,

Knot HST-1 in the M87 jet, locatedat a projected distance of 60 pc from the nucleus (see inset at top
left), is the site of violent variability as well as superluminally moving components. The images at
left, taken from Biretta et al. (1999, a color version of their Fig. 2), show the HST-1 region at ﬁve
epochs, roughly once per year between 1994 and 1998. Four components are seen to move at
speeds ∼6c. As shown at right (taken from Harris et al. 2009, their Fig. 4), this region is also the
site of violent variability; beginning in 2000, the knot began to increase in brightness, culminating
in April 2005 when HST-1 had surpassed the core in ﬂux by a factor of 2–6 in the UV and X-rays
with speeds that appear to decrease with distance from the nucleus, suggesting a gradual decel-
eration process may be at work. As of now no other radio galaxies have had such rapid motions
detected, however a few other radio galaxies have been seen with mildly superluminal motions
(1–2c), in particular B2 1144+35B (Giovannini et al. 2007, 1999).
Knot HST-1 is also the site of violent variability, another key property of blazars. As can
be seen in >Fig. 7-22 (right-hand panels), beginning in 2000–2001, HST-1 began a massive
increase in its flux, which culminated in March–May 2005 when for 10 weeks the knot was two
to six times brighter than the nucleus (depending on the band) in the ultraviolet and X-rays. At
maximum, the flux of HST-1 had increased by about 100 over its quiescent level. It is not known
whether other regions in the large-scale jet of M87 also vary in brightness; however, the nucleus
of M87 is also known to vary rapidly, both in the optical (Tsvetanov et al. 1998; Perlman et al.
2011) as well as in the X-rays (Harris et al. 2009).
Significant core variability has been seen in other radio galaxies, particularly Centaurus A,
which is known to vary massively in the hard X-ray and millimeter bands (Jourdain et al. 1993;
Beckmann et al. 2007; Abraham et al. 2007; Chitnis et al. 2009), as well as 3C 390.3 and 3C
120, both of which are known to be variable in the optical and X-rays. In those last two objects,

Active Galactic Nuclei 7

there is, however, some controversy over the nature of the observed variability, as some of the
properties are consistent with the less violent variability shown by Seyferts (both are broad-line
objects; see Gliozzi et al. 2009 for 3C 390.3 and Marshall et al. 2009 for 3C 120), suggesting
an origin outside the inner jet regions. However, both objects are known to exhibit apparent
superluminal motion (see Gomez et al. 1998 for 3C 120, and Alef et al. 1988, 1996 for 3C 390.3),
and in addition, Arshakian et al. (2010) and Abraham et al. (2007) argue strongly for the origin
of the variability in 3C 390.3 in its jet. Radio variability is also seen for these objects as well as
others in the radio (Ekers et al. 1983; Valtaoja et al. 1992), albeit in some cases mild enough that
beaming may not be required for an explanation.
A well-known property of blazars is their high-energy gamma-ray emission – until recently,
they were the only extragalactic objects known to emit at GeV and TeV energies, where in
many cases it turns out that blazars emit the majority of their power (> Fig. 7-23). Blazar
gamma-ray emissions are highly variable, and it turns out that these variations put strong,
model-independent constraints on the compactness required, requiring relativistic beaming
in their own right. Specifically, in order for gamma-rays to escape the source, the optical
depth to pair production, τγγ, must be of order unity or less, which is equivalent to say-
ing the compactness, a convenient dimensionless parameter that represents source luminosity
divided by dimension, must be less than about 40 at the threshold for pair-production. That
is, τγγ = l/= , where l = (L/r) (σT/mec) is the compactness, with L and r being the
source luminosity and dimension. The Thomson cross section, σT, is appropriate because most
pairs will be produced by interactions with gamma-rays rather than particles (see >Sect. 7).
For 3C279 and PKS 0528+134, the first two blazars where this variable emission was detected,
the inferred values for the compactness are 5,000–15,000, well in excess of the optical depth
limit. To allow gamma-rays to be observed from these blazars, the true gamma-ray luminosity
must be much smaller than observed and the true size much larger. Relativistic beaming has the
effect that Lobs ∼δ(+α)L, where δ is the Doppler beaming factor (> 7.7) and α is the spectral
index. If r is estimated from the variability timescale, then
l = δ−Lobs

(7.7)
The limit l ≤then translates to δ ≥for 3C 279 and δ ≥for PKS 0528+134, where Lobs
has been evaluated at X-ray energies under reasonable spectral assumptions (Maraschi et al.
1992); similar limits are obtained for other gamma-ray blazars (Dondi and Ghisellini 1995).
More recent observations (Abdo et al. 2009a) show much shorter timescale variability now in
GeV observations, as small as days, and in TeV observations on timescales of less than an hour
(Benbow et al. 2008). As shown in >Fig. 7-23, M87 (Abdo et al. 2009b; Aharonian et al. 2006;
Beilicke et al. 2005) is now known to emit in both GeV and TeV gamma-rays, with a luminosity
much less than that seen in blazars, and is in addition, strongly variable on timescales as small as
a day, while Centaurus A and NGC 1275 (Abdo et al. 2009c) are now confirmed as GeV emitters,
with luminosity similarly orders of magnitude below that seen in blazars. Thus the detection of
very-high-energy gamma-ray emission also argues for relativistic jets in both blazars and radio
galaxies, and hence unification.
A final piece of evidence in favor of the unification of radio-loud classes of AGN can be
found in their luminosity functions. Specifically, Urry and Padovani (1995) found that they
could use a fit to the luminosity function of the 2 Jy radio galaxy sample and apply a simple
beaming correction, and derive a reasonable fit to the luminosity function of both quasar-
type and BL Lac-type blazars. That work requires Doppler factors for both populations of

Nuclear Black Holes and Accretion
The development of the dominant paradigm for AGN occurred gradually. Of key importance
was the realization that a black hole was necessary to drive the enormous luminosities and
high-energy phenomena seen in AGN. The generation of large luminosities (as high as 10−
solar luminosities in quasars) in a region only a few light-days across is quite difficult. A stellar
cluster, for example, would have to include many billions of stars in this small volume in order
to explain these luminosities, and it is a simple matter to calculate that such a cluster would be
unstable to collapse within very short timescales. It is for this reason that Donald Lynden-Bell
(1969) first suggested the connection between active galaxies and black holes.
Accretion onto a black hole can be highly efficient in producing energy. If one assumes a
small mass δm spiraling into a black hole from infinity, it will have an available (gravitational
potential) energy of δE = GMBHδm
r
, such that the upper limit on the luminosity is simply
Lmax = GMBH ˙M
r
. Note that this is an upper limit – not all of the gravitational potential energy
can be extracted from infalling matter. If, however, one assumes that the matter goes in to 3 RS
(the location of the innermost stable orbit for a Schwarzschild black hole), then the efficiency ε is
ε ≡
L
˙Mc=
GMBH ˙M
(GMBH/c) ×

˙Mc≈.
(7.8)
A considerably higher efficiency can be reached if the matter goes all the way to the event
horizon before plunging (as it would in a maximally rotating Kerr black hole). However, a coun-
terveiling factor is that this calculation is purely Newtonian and does not take into account
relativistic effects, nor does it take into account exactly how the energy is extracted or any fluid-
dynamical effects within the accretion disk (about which more later). Taking these into account,
the best estimate for ε is ∼0.06 for the Schwarzschild case and 0.42 for the Kerr case. So, for
example, if ε ∼., then a luminosity of 10erg s−requires an accretion rate ˙M = M⊙year−.
Another constraint on the energy that can be extracted from accretion onto a black hole
comes from radiation pressure. A basic result from electromagnetism is that radiation exerts a
momentum flux of Prad = L/(πrc), and so there will be a force Frad = LσT
πrc on each electron
at a distance r, where σT is the Thomson cross section. So, if the radiative force equals that from
gravity, the luminosity is
LEdd = πGcmp
σT
MBH = .× ( M
M⊙
) erg s−.
(7.9)
This result, known as the Eddington limit, is a result that is also important to X-ray binary sys-
tems as well as high mass stars. If the luminosity exceeds this quantity, radiation force must
overpower gravity. It represents a fundamental limit to the luminosity of any accretion-powered
source, as without matter streaming in, the accretion process cannot function (although, n.b.,
there are a few objects where asymmetric, super-Eddington flows are suspected (Collin et al.
2006; Collin and Kawaguchi 2004)). This argument can also be inverted – that is, the large lumi-
nosities observed from AGN absolutely demand central black holes in the range 10–10M⊙,
as if the central object were either less massive or not a black hole, the Eddington limit would

336 7

be violated. In fact, if a black hole’s accretion flow produces light with a fixed efficiency ε, its
mass also sets a characteristic scale for the mass accretion rate – the Eddington rate:
˙MEdd = LE
cε = ( MBH
M⊙

.)
−
M⊙year−,
(7.10)
An important – if obvious – point needs to be made here and that is that in order to reach high
efficiencies ε, the matter cannot just quickly accrete into the black hole. If matter plunges into
the black hole quickly and as discrete lumps (e.g., stars or planets), there is little prospect for
extracting significant amounts of radiative energy from it. Thus, two critical parts of the equa-
tion are the time taken in the accretion process and whether accreted objects are disrupted into
smaller bits as they stream in. The latter question is governed by tidal forces, and for a rough
indicator of where these forces operate, one can turn to the Roche criterion, which expresses
the competition between the smoothed out mass density of the central black hole and the grav-
itational forces (i.e., internal mean density) of the star or planet. For a self-gravitating object of
mass M∗and radius R∗, this will mean that the object will be pulled apart by tidal forces when
it approaches closer than the tidal radius,

RS,
(7.11)
where the latter scaling holds for an object at the solar density. For a solar-type star, this radius
is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole’s mass is less than 10M⊙– so
that it is entirely conceivable that a star could accrete onto the black hole without being dis-
rupted first. Thus, even though this radius varies weakly with the density of the object being
accreted, it is important to realize that gravity alone will not serve to extract significant amounts
of energy from matter. Therefore it is more profitable to consider the supply of matter at lower
densities, that is from the interstellar medium. Furthermore, one also needs to consider the
roles played by other processes – such as viscosity and disk structure – in the energy produc-
tion mechanism. The actual efficiency of the process and hence the luminosity of any accreting
black hole system are highly dependent on the type of accretion flow – disk, spherical, or oth-
erwise – as well as whether the cooling within the disk is dominated by radiative or dissipative
losses.
The data are decisively in favor of the association of AGN with nuclear black holes. A few
AGN were included in the HST Nuker survey of nearby galaxies (Magorrian et al. 1998) for
central black holes, in particular M87, where the data require a × M⊙black hole. This link
has been strengthened by gas dynamical measurements of black hole masses for a number of
other AGN (Wang et al. 2009; Onken and Kollmeier 2008; Zhang et al. 2008; Vestergaard et al.
2008; McGill et al. 2008; Hicks and Malkan 2008; Onken et al. 2007; Greene and Ho 2007; Kelly
and Bechtold 2007). Moreover, reverberation mapping (>Sect. 5.1) has now been used to esti-
mate the black hole masses for dozens of AGN (Vestergaard and Peterson 2006; Vestergaard
and Osmer 2009; Bentz et al. 2009c) and work back to the M-σ relation (Ferrarese and Merritt
2000), which is found to be the same for AGN as it is for normal galaxies. Finally, masing molec-
ular line features have been discovered in several Seyfert 2s. The data indicate that the material
comes from warped, rotating disks a few thousand RS from the black hole (e.g., >Fig. 7-24).
The advantage of this last method is that it is sensitive to only the accretion structure itself,
as the resolution of the VLBI technique is a 100 times finer than that available from HST
optical data.

None of these datasets, however, can tell us what kind of a black hole is present. The jury is
still out on this; however, the latest data indicate that at least some AGN require near maximally
rotating Kerr black holes. The reason for this is twofold. First of all, broadened Fe Kα lines
have been observed in several AGN (e.g., > Fig. 7-25), which not only require both special
and general relativistic corrections to explain their profiles, but also require that material be
present within 3 RS, where the innermost stable orbit would lie for a nonrotating Schwarzschild

-6-30-15, bottom panels, Fabian et al. 2002). This type of line proﬁle can only be produced by the
warped spacetime that exists close to the event horizon of a central black hole
black hole. The presence of cold material at smaller radii requires a rotating black hole, where
the innermost stable orbit can move closer in to the ergosphere. If the black hole were not
rotating, all of the material within 3 RS would be in the “plunging region” where no stable orbit
is possible, and in that case it would plunge into the black hole in a very short time with no
further release of energy.

Active Galactic Nuclei 7
339
The second reason why rotating black holes may be required for many AGN comes from
models of jet ejection (e.g., Meier et al. 2001; Tchekhovskoy et al. 2011; see >Sect. 7), which
indicate that the acceleration of a highly relativistic jet is much easier in the ergosphere sur-
rounding a maximally spinning black hole. This latter work is not yet backed up by data,
although some authors (notably Sikora et al. 2007) have linked the radio-loud/radio-quiet
dichotomy to the spin of the central black hole.
4.1 Bondi Accretion
The simplest type of flow one can imagine into the central black hole is purely spherical. This is
the classicproblem of Bondi accretion. Imagine a black hole moving through a uniform medium
of density ρ∞at some (relatively slow) velocity v. In spherical symmetry, the accretion rate
from a radius r will then be simply ˙M = πrρ∞v. If the gas is adiabatic, then from a fluid-
mechanical analysis of the surrounding medium, one can derive (see, e.g., Krolik 1999) that the
overall accretion rate will be
˙M = πλ (γ) (GM)
cs
ρ∞,
(7.12)
where cs is the speed of sound and λ is a dimensionless parameter dependent only on the
adiabatic exponent γ:

−(−γ)/[(γ−)]

(7.13)
This analysis then allows one to estimate the gas density necessary to feed an AGN of a given
luminosity and mass:

Bondi accretion represents the simplest solution to the problem of accretion in the sense that
no assumption is made regarding the density of the material, incoming angular momentum, or
the like. Of course more complex solutions, particularly disks (discussed next), are possible if
the matter comes in with significant angular momentum.
As matter that is accreting spherically does not spend a large amount of time falling into the
black hole, the majority of the regions around the black hole are optically thin, so that any emis-
sion is Bremsstrahlung, which has an emissivity proportional to T−/n. An adiabatic accretion

By putting in values typical of galactic nuclei, one sees that this is generally a very inefficient
process. For example, Bondi accretion for Sgr A∗gives an efficiency ε = −, whereas most
AGN require much higher efficiencies. As a result, Bondi accretion is probably important only
for low-luminosity AGN, particularly LINERs and possibly also FR I radio galaxies (Allen et al.
2006). For more luminous objects, a different solution must be sought.
Thus spherical accretion, while likely common in galactic nuclei, actually has limited utility
for fueling activity. In general, it is very inefficient in translating gravitational potential energy
into radiative energy due primarily to the fact that the density of incoming material tends to
be low and a given parcel will accrete onto the black hole relatively quickly (as opposed to disk
accretion, for which see the next section).
4.2 Disk Accretion
One of the problems with spherical accretion is that the matter can fall into the black hole in a
relatively short time, thus allowing little opportunity for the extraction of energy into radiative
form. Also, it takes no account of the angular momentum of the matter streaming in. This latter
consideration is important. If, for example, the central regions of the host galaxy are rotating, or
if matter is streaming in to the central regions from a galactic interaction, then it will enter the
central regions with considerable angular momentum, which must be dealt with if matter is to
accrete onto the central black hole. In a typical galaxy, matterorbiting the nucleus at distances of
kiloparsecs has a typical specificangularmomentum of10−cms−, while matterorbiting
at the last stable orbit of a 10M⊙black hole has a specific angular momentum four orders of
magnitude less. Thus if rotation or large-scale streaming motions are important in a galaxy,
it will be necessary for any matter that accretes to shed its angular momentum before being
accreted onto the central black hole to fuel activity.
It is well known that typical galaxies are rotationally flattened into disk shapesby their angu-
lar momenta. It should therefore not be surprising that the same thing happens to accreting
matter. Thus when angular momentum is important, one would expect material orbiting the
black hole to stream into a disk, where as it loses energy and angular momentum (by heretofore
unspecified processes) it will fall into a succession of ever-so-slightly smaller circles until finally
it reaches the last stable orbit and plunging region. It should be mentioned that matter in this
case will take a considerably longer period of time to make the journey from the nuclear inter-
stellar medium into the black hole. This allows much more time for the extraction of energy,
which was one of the problems plaguing Bondi accretion. Thus disk accretion can be much
more efficient at extracting energy from accreting matter than Bondi accretion.
It is a good idea to begin our consideration of accretion disks with a discussion of their struc-
ture in terms of both temperature and density. If one assumes that the disk is supported against
gravity by a pressure gradient in the vertical coordinate z, then from hydrostatic equilibrium,

Ω is the angular velocity, and the velocity vϕ is just the Keplerian orbital speed for a given
radius. This means that the specific angular momentum at any radius R will be l = √GMBHR.
To flow inward, the gas must lose angular momentum through some unknown process. This can
include redistribution of some kind (i.e., by gas at the smallest radii losing angular momentum)
or a generalized wind or outflow. In either case, matter will be transported to small radii while
angular momentum is carried out to a very large radius by some tiny fraction of the mass that
must therefore leave the black hole’s environs at large speeds.
If the gas is flowing inward, it will have a potential energy per unit mass of
E = −GMBH

.
(7.21)
So for a small parcel of mass dM flowing inward by dR (see geometry in > Fig. 7-26), its
potential energy will change by

It should be noted that this analysis, due to Shakura and Sunyaev (1973), does not account
for the transport of angular momentum or boundary conditions (including general relativistic
corrections near the black hole), and of course it assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium.
A more correct analysis that includes these factors as well as the disk viscosity (see below) (Melia

The overall disk spectrum will then be an integral over the entire range of radii for which the
disk exists, weighted by the mass in each annulus. The majority of the disk emission will come
from the innermost region of the disk (i.e., the innermost few gravitational radii); however, as
the accretion disk is expected to span at least two to three decades in radius, a similar range in
temperature and hence frequency is to be expected from the disk spectrum. Theoretical models
of disks indicate that the spectrum one should expect (e.g., Koratkar and Blaes 1999) is rela-
tively flat, ν−/, over the range of temperatures seen in the disk, with an exponential cutoff at
high frequencies. As shown by > Fig. 7-27, this is consistent with the broad spectral energy
distribution seen from most AGN in the near-IR, optical, and ultraviolet.
The exact mechanism for redistributing angular momentum is not clear. While it is clear
this is a viscous process, it cannot simply be the microscopic viscosity, which is far too weak to
have a noticeable effect. One way to produce a larger viscosity is via turbulence; however, there
is no obvious reason why one might expect a turbulent disk as the Rayleigh stability criterion
is satisfied for the Keplerian potential. It is true that since the interesting regions of AGN disks
have temperatures ∼10K, He II/He III ionization transitions may occur at some radii, which
would then be convectivelyunstable. However, such a mechanism is unlikelytoexist throughout
the disk, and, moreover, simulations appear to show that convection tends to carry angular
momentum in rather than out (Stone and Balbus 1996). The conventional view now appears to
be that magnetic fields are required to transport angular momentum outward, as required. In
the presence of a magnetic field, the instability criterion is satisfied because the magnetic field
couples fluid elements together. This mechanism, known as the magnetorotational instability
(MRI) (e.g., Balbus 2003), can transport angular momentum outward. If the magnetic field
grows as one goes to smaller radii, the MRI becomes stronger, and therefore one can see that
this process is also intimately tied up with the mechanism for producing large-scale outflows
and jets (about which more later), which also are likely responsible for carrying outward a fair
fraction of the angular momentum of disk matter.
4.3 Disk Coronae and the 6.4 keV Iron Line
Accretion disks produce a quasi-thermal spectrum that tends to peak in the ultraviolet to soft
X-rays. However, as already indicated, AGN usually exhibit emission that extends to much
higher energies, ≥100 keV even for radio-quiet AGN. This emission cannot come from the disk

itself or the broad- or narrow-line regions because the conditions are not right. However, one
aspect not yet considered is whether, in a system where disk accretion is going on, the regions
surrounding the accretion disk will contribute to the emissions observed. It is logical to assume
that, at higher latitudes surrounding the accretion disk, there is an “atmosphere” or (as more
often attributed) corona of hot gas. This corona can be much less dense than the accretion disk
itself; however, thanks to well-known processes such as Compton scattering, it can account for
a major portion of the AGN emission.
In Compton scattering, photons are scattered by electrons. It is important to point out
that Compton scattering is a mandatory process – that is, if one has a region of space with a
considerable population of free electrons, and a bright radiation source nearby, the process is
unavoidable. These conditions are easy to satisfy in a lower-density region near the center of
an AGN, and therefore it is critical to consider Comptonization and its implications for AGN –
both in the corona as well as other regions (see >Sect. 7 on jets, below). In this section, the the-
ory of Comptonization and its impact on AGN are discussed. More information on the subject
is available from, for example, Rybicki and Lightman (1986).
It is a well-known result from special relativity that when a photon is scattered by an
electron, its wavelength changes by
Δλ =
h
mec (−cos θ) ,
(7.26)
and its final energy is related to its initial energy via
ΔE =
E
mec(−cos θ) .
(7.27)
In the electron’s rest frame, the photon imparts energy to the recoiling electron. However,
in the laboratory frame, it is possible for the electron to impart energy to the photon, up to
ΔE = (γ −) mec(where γ is the electron’s Lorentz factor) if the angle is right. This process,
whereby the photon gains energy through scattering, is called inverse-Compton scattering. For
low-energy electrons, this process is not important; it is only for high-energy particles (i.e., hot
gas) where it takes on critical importance.
It can be shown that for a nonrelativistic, thermal distribution of electrons with temperature
Te, the average change in energy becomes
⟨ΔE⟩= (kTe −E)
E
mec.
(7.28)
For a thermal distribution of electrons, a photon will gain energy if its energy E ≪kTe, with
the change in energy being proportional to γ. One factor of γ in this proportionality comes
from the boosting of the photon into the electron’s initial rest frame, while the other comes from
the boosting of the scattered photon back into the lab frame. The process of inverse-Compton
scattering can occur an arbitrary number of times (so long as the photon remains within the
scattering region), as long as E ≪kTe, with ΔE/E = kTe/mec. After N scattering events,
the photon’s final energy will be given by
E f = Ei exp(N kTe
mec)
(7.29)
Typicallythe numberofscatters is parameterized in terms ofthe optical depth τes; in this param-
eterization, the average number of scatters will be max(τes, τ
es). Often one speaks in terms of

Active Galactic Nuclei 7
345
the Compton y-parameter, where y is defined such that
y = max(τes, τ
es)(kTe/mec)
(7.30)
and E f = Eiey. If y is large – a case known as saturated Compton scattering – the aver-
age photon will reach the thermal energy of the electrons. This process is less important
for accreting black hole systems. More important for AGN coronae is the unsaturated case,
which is the suspected mechanism for producing the hard X-ray continuum in the broadband
spectrum of AGN. In the context of accreting black hole systems, it is most convenient for
the corona to speak of the virial temperature that refers to the average accretion energy per
particle. Since the gravitational energy released per particle of mass m scales as GMBHm/r,
which itself scales as mc/ [R/(GMBH/c)], the virial temperature is independent of the
size of the black hole. Electron virial temperatures of tens to hundreds of keV can be readily
achieved in the innermost regions of black hole systems (the proton virial temperature is a fac-
tor ∼2,000 higher), and this represents the maximum energy that Comptonized photons can
achieve.
The resulting spectrum thus reflects the competition between the number of scatterings and
the likelihood of these multiple scatters – although multiple scatterings become exponentially
unlikely, they produce exponential energy gain. The two effects balance to some degree, and it
can be shown that for a given Compton y-parameter, the resulting spectrum is a power law with
photon index Γ(N(γ) ∝E−Γ) of approximately 1 (see Reynolds and Nowak 2003).
Γ = −

y .
(7.31)
As can be seen from > Fig. 7-13, the typical hard X-ray spectrum of an AGN has a photon
index of around 2, which means that the typical Compton y-parameter in black hole coronae
is about 1. Of course the exact function Γ(y) depends on the geometry and other assump-
tions, and a power-law form is only achieved for photon energies less than the electron thermal
energy. As photons approach the thermal energy, they can no longer gain energy from scat-
tering, so that the observed high-energy spectral cutoff – typically in the neighborhood of a
few hundred keV – yields information about the temperature of the electrons in the AGN’s
corona.
It should be mentioned that the mechanism for heating the electrons to near-virial tem-
peratures is currently unknown, although the leading hypothesis is that magnetic processes are
dominant. Second, the geometry of the corona in AGN is completely unconstrained; various
workers have produced models for a variety of geometries, as shown in >Fig. 7-28.
A second set of processes, due to reprocessing in the accretion disk’s outer layers of pho-
tons scattered within the corona and then “reflected” back toward the disk, are also important
for AGN X-ray spectra. These processes may be modeled simplistically by supposing that the
accretion disk is a semi-infinite slab of uniform density gas, irradiated from above by a contin-
uum produced in the corona via thermal Comptonization. Hydrogen and helium are assumed
to be fully ionized, but heavier elements are neutral. While a crude approximation, this is not
far from the truth in a relatively “cold” accretion disk.
An X-ray photon coming from the corona can either be scattered by the free electrons asso-
ciated with the ionized hydrogen and heliums, or the outer electrons of the other elements,
or photoelectrically absorbed by one of the neutral atoms. For the latter process to occur,
the photon’s energy must be above the threshold energy for a given photoelectric transition.
The transitions with the largest cross sections are those associated with the ejection of K-shell

(i.e., n = ) electron. Following K-shell photoionization, the resulting ion usually de-excites in
one of two ways, both of which start with an L-shell (n = ) electron dropping into the K-shell.
This can occur with either the excess energy being radiated as a Kα line photon or a second L-
shell electron can be ejected (often called autoionization or the Auger effect). Thus the output
spectrum must include both of these effects: a “hump” due to the reflection at 30–40 keV and
then a variety of Kα lines from different elements (see >Fig. 7-29).
These features are indeed observed in most spectra, as shown by the recent Suzaku spectrum
of MCG-6-30-15 (Reynolds and Miller 2009), as well as Chandra and XMM observations of
several other AGN (Brenneman and Reynolds 2009). Importantly, one expects that the disk,
and the associated corona, will truncate at a similar radius, namely, that of the innermost stable
orbit (Reynolds and Miller 2009; Reynolds and Fabian 2008). Thus the shape of the observed Fe
Kα line becomes a link to not only how far inward the disk goes but indeed what type of black
hole the object hosts – as it is the spin parameter that determines the location of the innermost
stable orbit (>Fig. 7-25). However, in radio-loud objects, these features can be overshadowed
by the continuum from the jet (which will be discussed in >Sect. 7). In addition, there appears
to be an inverse correlation between the 2–10-keV X-ray luminosity and the equivalent width
of the Fe Kα line (Iwasawa and Taniguchi 1993; Nandra et al. 1997).

Emission Line Regions
As already discussed, one of the original characteristics by which AGN were first identified is
their strong line emission in the optical. This is a property displayed by the great majority of
all AGN, with the exception of BL Lac objects. The widths of these emission lines are generally
interpreted as Doppler velocities, as the alternate interpretation of thermal broadening would
require temperatures∼10K in the case of the broad lines. At that temperature,all atoms would
be fully ionized so that no emission lines would be produced (in addition, a plasma at that tem-
perature would efficiently produce e+/e−pairs, and the resulting annihilation line at 511 keV
is not observed in the Gamma rays).
To get a first idea of the distance scale at which velocities ∼10,000 km s−might be possible,
one might suppose that the velocities are indicative of the local rotation around the central black
hole. In this case, since

(7.32)
one would expect a distance R ∼500 RS for velocities ∼c/30. Hence, to a first approximation, the
broad lines can be produced no closer to the black hole than ∼1,000 RS (although this estimate
was based on the assumption of rotational motion, the infall velocity for free fall is within a
factor 2). The region in which these broad emission lines are produced is called the broad-line

region or BLR. By a similar argument, then, one would expect the narrow lines to be produced
at greater distances from the central black hole, specifically at least 2 orders of magnitude more
distance given that their widths are at least a factor 10 smaller.
5.1 Reverberation Mapping
A more direct way to measure the extent of emission regions in AGN and their geometry is
provided by reverberation mapping. This technique, pioneered by B. M. Peterson (1993), uti-
lizes the fact that heating and ionization of the BLR (for details see the ensuing discussion) are
both accomplished by the central continuum source of the AGN, that is, the accretion disk.
One would expect that variability in the accretion disk would therefore produce corresponding
variations of the physical conditions in the BLR, and hence the broad lines observed. However,
things are not quite as simple as that, as light (as with all other information) travels at a finite
speed, namely c. If indeed a change in the continuum causes a change in the observed emission
lines, then one would expect a delay Δt ∼r/c between the change in the continuum and that
observed in the emission lines – where r represents the distance between the regions where the
two are produced. Thus what is done in reverberation mapping is that one correlates changes in
a variety of emission lines to the changes in the UV continuum and thus infers the correspond-
ing values of r, which correspond to the characteristic distances at which each of these lines
are produced. One can also monitor different continuum bands to investigate the temperature
structure of the accretion disk.
It should be mentioned that carrying out this technique is very demanding – one needs
to continuously monitor the fluxes of both the continuum and lines (many of them) over a
long period and then cross-correlate them against one another to look for correlated variability.
The technique is illustrated in > Figs. 7-29 and >7-30. Looking at the figure, it is important to
point out the multiplicity of timescales that one needs to monitor: while the variations in the
continuum and lines are on timescales of days to hours, the delays between the continuum and
the broad lines occur on much longer timescales – months to a few years. Thus one needs to
obtain data from many observatories in order to avoid gaps due either to bad weather or even
the normal day-night cycle at single observing sites.
These campaigns (see >Fig. 7-31) show that the BLR is typically at distances of light-months
from the central black hole. Furthermore, the BLR extends over a wide range of radii, which
consists of a variety of different layers; higher ionization potential lines are produced closer in
to the black hole (and therefore have smaller delays observed) while lower potential lines are
produced at greater distances from the black hole. For example, for the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC
5548, for which >Fig. 7-30 shows the result of reverberation monitoring data, one obtains r ∼
light-days for Lyα, about 26 light-days for C III], and about 50 light-days for Mg II. It should be
noted that the finding that higher ionization potential lines are produced at smaller distances
from the black hole is consistent with the observation that the higher ionization potential lines
also tend to be broader than lines at lower ionization potential (Bentz et al. 2006, 2007). Inter-
estingly, lines of higher ionization energy also tend to have a mean redshift that is systematically
shifted blueward compared to narrower emission lines – thus hinting at a generalized outflow
structure in which the BLR participates (see e.g., Risaliti and Elvis 2010). Another interesting
finding from reverberation mapping data is that the extent of the BLR also scales with the lumi-
nosity of the AGN (Peterson et al. 2005; Kaspi et al. 2007; Bentz et al. 2009b) – larger BLRs are
observed in more luminous objects and vice versa.

5.2 Physical Conditions in the BLR
The broad lines observed in AGN are nearly all permitted transitions typical of those seen in the
warm interstellar medium. The BLR clouds are photoionized by energetic (i.e., UV and X-ray)
continuum radiation from the AGN’s accretion disk (See > Sect. 5.4). This photoionization
does not, however, represent the only heating source. There is clearly significant hydrodynamic
heating as part of the generalized outflow that is taking place in the AGN, which the BLR clouds
take part in. The main energy loss mechanism in the BLR clouds is emission of line radiation.
Detailed photoionization models (e.g., Korista and Goad 2004, 2000; Korista et al. 1995; and
references therein) are very successful at reproducing the line emission and line ratios seen in
AGN (>Fig. 7-32).
Those efforts use techniques similar to those used in ISM work (e.g., line ratios and the like)
to fill in information regarding the temperatureand density of BLR clouds as well as other infor-
mation. What is found is that the typical densities in BLR clouds range from 10up to 10cm−,
near the critical density for CIII] λ 1909, thus making that line a very important diagnostic
with higher values required for higher ionization potential lines, which (as detailed above) also
appear to come from regions somewhat closer to the central black hole, while the lower val-
ues pertain to lower ionization lines. The typical temperature is around 20,000 K. Interestingly,

the abundances seen in AGN broad-line regions do not appear to be typical of the interstellar
medium. Arav et al. (2005, 2007) and Costantini et al. (2007), for example, find typically ∼2×
solar abundances of C, N, and O in the outflow and broad-line region of Mrk 279, using data
from HST, FUSE, and Chandra. The origin of these supersolar abundances is unclear, but it hints
at links between the host galaxy (i.e., the number of stellar generations in an AGN nucleus) and
the presence of AGN.
There is considerable controversy about the filling factor and number of clouds required for
BLR. While HST observations (e.g., Gabel et al. 2005; Scott et al. 2009, among others) suggest
a filling factor ∼0.1 and a complex kinematic structure within the BLR, high-resolution spec-
troscopy (Arav et al. 1997, 1998) show that an extraordinarily high number of clouds – upwards
of 10and possibly upwards of 10– are required to explain the smoothness of the broad-line
profiles observed in bright, albeit low-luminosity Seyfert AGN such as NGC 4151 and Mrk
335. These two results are at least outwardly difficult to reconcile with one another; however,
it is possible for both to be true in a turbulent region. However, the combination of this large
number of clouds and filling factor ∼0.1 indicates that the discrete clouds that make up the BLR
must be relatively small, ∼10cm in size at most. This small size has significant implications
for the stability (i.e., evaporation time) of BLR clouds, especially under these conditions.
5.3 Physical Conditions in the Narrow-Line Region
In addition to the broad emission lines discussed above, one also observes a variety of narrow-
line features. Their typical line widths are ∼500 km s−, considerably narrower than the lines
of the BLR. By analogy to the BLR, the region in which these lines are produced is known as
the narrow-line region or NLR. The strongest line from the NLR is, besides Ly α and C IV, the
forbidden [O III] line at 5007. The existence (and indeed dominance) of forbidden lines implies
that the gas densities in the NLR are significantly lower than in the BLR.
Like the BLR, the NLR gas is assumed to be photoionized by the UV and X-ray contin-
uum from the central engine. Photoionization modeling is described in detail in >Sect. 5.4.
From estimates analogous to those used for the BLR (see above), one can obtain the physical
conditions of the NLR. An example of this work is shown in >Fig. 7-33.
It should be noted, however, that one cannot apply the technique of reverberation map-
ping, as no correlated variability has been observed, and the extent of the NLR is believed to be
of order 100 pc. The line ratios of allowed and forbidden lines yield typical electron densities
ne ∼–10cm−for the gas where the lines originate. The typical temperature is ∼15,000 K,
similar to but perhaps slightly lower than the BLR, and the filling factor for the line-emitting
material is significantly less than one – typically in the neighborhood of 10−. Hence one can
use a similar geometrical picture as for the BLR, namely, that of line-emitting clouds, perhaps
embedded in a generalized outflow.
Since the NLR is much more extended than the BLR, in nearby objects one can hope to
resolve it with modern telescopes. An example of such data is seen in >Fig. 7-34. As can be
seen, the morphology of the NLR is highly interesting – rather than spherically symmetric, it
appears to show two cone-shaped regions on opposite sides of the nucleus. Thus it would appear
as if the ionization of the NLR by the AGN’s continuum radiation is not isotropic at these scales,
but instead depends strongly on the direction. This is an observation which agrees strongly with
unified schemes (>Sect. 6).

5.4 Photoionization
As discussed above, the temperatures in the emission line regions of AGN are typically of order
10,000–20,000 K. How, then, do the regions around the central engine achieve a large enough
abundance of ionized species to generate emission lines of highly ionized species, including
[C IV, O III], etc.? Collisional ionization, which operates in supernova remnants and some other
nebulae, cannot provide the answer: under pure shock-wave heating, the [O III] lines would
require temperatures in excess of × K, and even higher for some of the higher-ionization
lines. In addition, one expects a relationship between the temperature and degree of ionization,
which is not observed. What is seen instead is a relatively constant temperature in both narrow

based image of the galaxy. At right, a composite false-color image made from HST observations
taken in the Hα+ [NII] and [OIII] lines (Wilson et al. 1993). As can be seen, the ionized gas lies in two
conical regionslocated on either sideof theactivenucleus; these regionsrepresent the narrow-line
region gas in this object
and broad emission line clouds, with a wide range of densities. Reverberation mapping cam-
paigns also show that the highest ionization broad emission line clouds lie closest to the active
nucleus (>Fig. 7-31) – precisely where the flux of ionizing, high-energy radiation would be the
highest. Moreover (> Sects. 2 and >4), the active nucleus is a copious source of high-energy
UV and X-ray emission, with a roughly power-law shape. Thus these considerations lead to the
preeminence of photoionization as the primary excitation mechanism in both the broad and
narrow emission line regions.
The physical balance in the broad- and narrow-line regions is dictated by the following
concerns. Energy input to the emission line regions can come from both photoionization as
well as hydrodynamic processes. The latter can include both generalized outflows (such as those
in the model of Risaliti and Elvis 2010), as well as any interaction with the jet (in radio-loud
objects) or obscuration lines. The primary method for energy output is via radiative cooling by
collisionally excited lines, which increases rapidly with temperatures above 10,000 K, which is
the temperature where hydrogen becomes dominantly ionized across a wide range of physical
conditions. This fact tends to keep the temperature in the 10–20,000 K range over a wide range
of input ionizing continua.
It is usually assumed that the photoionized gas is far enough from the central source that
the gas can be modeled as an infinite slab. A given model will generally assume a constant den-
sity in the slab, with the gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The Boltzmann and Saha

Active Galactic Nuclei 7
355
equation are solved at each point, thus allowing the ionization and thermal structure to be
determined within the gas along a radial direction from the central source. This will produce a
depth-dependent opacity at every frequency as well as emission coefficients for different lines,
allowing one to solve the equation of radiative transfer given the input emission spectrum. Sev-
eral photoionization codes are in use; the most commonly used are CLOUDY (Ferland et al.
1998), Ion (Netzer 1990), and Xstar (Kallman and Bautista 2001).
The calculations these models do are quite complex, but the results can be encapsulated in
two physical quantities: the number density and state of ionization. The number density is usu-
ally expressed in terms of the hydrogen column, whereas the ionization state is a more complex
quantity, usually parameterized in terms of the ionization parameter, defined as the dimension-
less ratio of the ionizing photon density to the electron density. In its simplest form – where
ionization is done only by incident radiation – the ionization parameter can be expressed as
U =

πrcn
∞
∫
νo
Lν
hνdν,
(7.33)
Here Lν is the ionizing luminosity per unit frequency interval above the Lyman limit (i.e., hν=
.eV), and n is the numberdensity of the gas in the slab. This formalism can be extendedfairly
trivially to the case of collisional ionization by specifying a “pressure ionization parameter,”
usually written as Ξ = L/(πrcp), where p is the gas pressure.
The methodology one adopts is that one varies the density and ionization parameters until
the predicted line luminosities match those observed. One must incorporate into the code all
relevant atomic data, including recombination rates, ionization cross sections, charge exchange
rates and the like. For each line, the luminosity is calculated, assuming that the total number of
ionizing photons emitted by the central source must balance the number of recombinations in
the ionized gas. These are of course related directly to the total number of line photons emitted
in the gas. Thus, for any line, the equation of radiative transfer can be written (e.g., for Hβ)
LHβ = hνHβ
αeff
Hβ (H, T)
αB (H, T)
ΩELG
π
∞
∫
ν
Lν
hν dν,
(7.34)
where ΩELG is the solid angle covered by the emission line gas (so that ΩELG/π is the covering
factor), αeff
Hβ (H, T) is the effective recombination coefficient for the Hβ line, and αB (H, T)
is the recombination coefficient for H, such that the ratio of these two coefficients is the num-
ber of Hβ photons produced per hydrogen recombination. See, for example, Osterbrock and
Ferland (2006) as well as Crenshaw et al. (2003) for detailed descriptions of the process and
assumptions of photoionization models.
Thus once one has measured the input photon spectrum as well as the luminosity in each
of the emission lines, one can calculate parameters for the regions where each line is generated
using (> 7.33) and (>7.34), with the former modified as appropriate for the line in question.
It is the output of these calculations that has been shown in > Figs. 7-32 and >7-33. Note also
that this same procedure is used to model the ionization structure of any intrinsic absorption
region (>Sect. 6), where the models are iterated in density and ionization parameter to attempt
to match the observed ionic column density.
Once these calculations have been done for each emission line, it is also useful to comment
on the total mass of the BLR, which allows us to close the circuit begun at the beginning of this

356 7

section by discussing the mean radius of these regions. The luminosity in a given emission line
can be rewritten as
L (Hβ) = nenpαeff
HβhνHβV ΩELG
π ,
(7.35)
where V is the volume of the line emission region. Then, if one assumes roughly solar abun-
dances, it can be shown that ne ≈.np, and the mass of the region can then be calculated easily,
as can its volume. The NLRs of the most luminous Seyfert galaxies have L(Hβ) = × L⊙,
which gives a total mass Mion ≈× (/ne)M⊙if a roughly spherical NLR is assumed. Of
course, this very elementary assumption does not pay attention to the underlying geometrical
complexity of the emission line regions (e.g., >Fig. 7-34 for the NLR and >Fig. 7-31 for the
BLR); however, it is adequate to an order of magnitude.
6
Nuclear Obscuration: Tori, Broad, and Narrow Absorption Lines
As shown by >Fig. 7-18, the basic picture underlying the unified scheme places a geometri-
cally and optically thick cloud of gas, often described as the torus surrounding the broad-line
regions along the equatorial plane. This obscuring region is central to our view of AGN – when
viewing the AGN along an equatorial line of sight, the torus obscures the broad-line emission,
but the narrow emission line region is still visible, resulting in a type 2 object. In comparison, a
pole-on view would provide a direct view of both the narrow and broad emission line regions,
resulting in a type 1 classification. The presence of the torus can account for the ionization cones
commonly observed in AGN in both emission lines and polarized flux through shadowing of
the ionizing radiation by the torus, resulting in the biconical shape shown in >Fig. 7-34 (e.g.,
Packham et al. 1997). The torus also accounts for the X-ray differences, where soft X-rays are
at least partially absorbed during their passage through the torus (Maiolino and Risaliti 2007).
In addition to the torus, there are other absorption regions in AGN, from which one observes
a variety of line features. Both will be discussed in this section.
6.1 The Torus
By far the most ubiquitous and well known of these obscuration regions is the torus, which
as already discussed is central to unified schemes. Before torus models are discussed in detail,
it is important to note that torus models currently rank as the least well constrained of all the
different parts of the unified scheme simply because of how recently good data became available.
Classical models of the torus assumed for simplicity a uniform dust distribution within a large,
extended obscuration region (e.g., Pier and Krolik 1992; Granato and Danese 1994; Efstathiou
and Rowan-Robinson 1995). However, these models require large (100 pc scale) tori to produce
long-wavelength emission, and fine-tuning to account for differences between types 1 and 2
sources. However, the mid-IR observations described in >Sect. 2.5 have thrown these notions
largely into disrepute, as such a large, extended torus would easily have been resolved in nearby
sources with ground-based observations. Moreover, such models fail to replicate the silicate
feature characteristics and the extremely large (NH > cm−) column densities that X-ray
data indicate for many sources.
More modern models of the torus must cope with size limits of only a few parsecs from
the mid-infrared, as well as reverberation mapping observations (Suganuma et al. 2007) which

Active Galactic Nuclei 7
357
place the 1–2 μm emission region just outside the broad-line region, that is, typicallyat distances
of a few tenths of parsecs in Seyfert galaxies and more distant in more luminous objects, in
agreements with simple calculations for the dust sublimation radius. These results are difficult
to explain under homogeneous, extended torus models, but are consistent with the new breed
of compact, but patchy torus models whereby the distribution of dust is clumpy (Elitzur et al.
2004; Elitzur 2007; Elitzur and Shlosman 2006; Nenkova et al. 2008a, b; see >Fig. 7-35). The
fundamental distinction of the inhomogeneous density distribution is that radiation can freely
propagate between different optically thick clumps.
The model formalism accounts for both direct heating by the AGN and indirect heating by
the ambient clouds’ emission, so some dense clouds remain cool to provide long-wavelength
emission within a compact volume. It is relatively elementary to derive that under these
assumptions, the intensity at a point s generated by clouds along a given ray is
IC
λ (s) =
s
∫e−tλ(s′,s)SC,λ (s′) nCAC (s′) ds′,
(7.36)
where tλ (s′, s) = N (s′, s) (−e−τλ)
, N (s′, s) =
s
∫
s′ nCAC (s) ds is the mean number of clouds
between s′ and s; nC and AC, respectively, are the number per unit volume and area of clouds
along s; and τλ is the optical depth at wavelength λ, and all clouds are assumed to be identical.
This is an exact analog tothe general solution ofstandard radiative transferin continuous media.
If radiation is propagating from s′ to s, then it will have a probability of escaping that is equal to
Pesc (s′, s) = e−tλ(s′,s).
(7.37)
Thus the only difference between clumpy and continuous media is that by integrating, one
replaces the standard optical depth with its equivalent ts
λ and the absorption coefficient is
replaced by the product nCAC. Because of the particulate composition of matter, this equation
is always valid in a statistical sense only, corresponding in principle to the intensity averaged
along the same path over an ensemble of many sources with identical average properties.
⊡Fig. 7-35
Left: In the clumpy torus model, the clouds follow a power-law distribution with radius from the
inner radius, Rd, to outer radius Ro. The clouds are concentrated in the equatorial plane, distributed

To integrate a path containing a background source, such as the line of sight to the AGN,
requires different handling since one cannot then average. For each line of sight, there are k
intervening clouds, with Poisson probability Pk, and one then generates tabulations of inten-
sities and their associated probabilities (Ik, Pk) with an actual source corresponding to one
particular member of this probability distribution. Thus if the normalized spectral shape of
the AGN radiation is feλ, the fraction of the AGN luminosity that emerges through a spherical
shell of radius r centered on the nucleus is, on average,
pAGN (r) = ∫

d sin β ∫dλ feλPλ,esc (r, β).
(7.38)
where Pλ,esc (r, β) is the probability for a photon of wavelength λ emitted by the AGN in direc-
tion β to reach radius r. Therefore, the fraction of type 2 sources in a given sample will be
f= −pAGN (Rout) where Rout is the outer torus radius.
Within the clumpy models, one generally assumes a power-law distribution of clouds with
radius from the inner radius, Rd (presumably where dust sublimates), to outer radius Rout. One
general result is that there is no such thing as a single-temperature torus – the distribution
of temperatures in a given cloud will be dependent on the optical depth within it, with the
coldest dust temperatures found at the highest optical depth. Thus in this context it is important
to understand that the radius for the 2-μm emission found by Suganuma et al. (2007) does
not represent the inner radius of the torus but rather the mean distance of the torus clouds
themselves because what Suganuma et al. would have measured would be just the dust in the
outermost layers of clouds located in the torus, not necessarily those located in a certain part of
the torus.
>Figure 7-36 shows the spectral energy distribution of slabs illuminated by AGN radiation
in the case of two different observer directions and a number of temperatures. As can be seen,
the general features of AGN mid-IR continua ( > Sect. 2.5) are duplicated. Thus the clumpy
models capture the broad spectral distinction of type 1 and type 2 AGN, with only the for-
mer affording direct views of the central engine and remaining bright across the entire UV-FIR
bandpass, while producing nearly isotropic MIR emission. Most significantly, the models can
reproduce the variety of observed MIR spectral characteristics, notably weak silicate absorption
and emission, and a range of continuum slopes. The observations therefore provide powerful
diagnostics of these physical conditions in the galaxies’ central regions. Also, the emergent IR
flux scales directly with the intrinsic luminosity of the AGN. Fitting a model to an observed
spectrum therefore immediately reveals the power of the central engine, which is not otherwise
evident in the obscured (type 2) cases.
6.2 Line Absorption
In addition to the above, AGN spectra contain a variety of line absorption features. This section
will discuss only absorption that is intrinsic to either the AGN or its host galaxy rather than
caused by intervening gas that lies by chance along the line of sight. While the latter features,
seen in all AGN spectra, are interesting in their own right and place fundamental constraints on
the physical state of the intergalactic medium and high-redshift galaxies, they are not germane
to the subject of AGN physics.
Almost all varieties of AGN exhibit absorption, but its character seems to vary widely from
one class to the next – both broad and narrow features are seen, with a large range in properties

mum temperature of 850 K. In the top and bottom panels, the observer direction is 60○from slab
normal on the illuminated and dark sides, respectively (Nenkova et al. 2008a, their Fig. 8)
that is at some level luminosity dependent. However, one feature appears to be common among
all of these absorbers, namely, that any velocity shift seen is toward the blue (as compared to the
AGN’s systemic velocity) – that is, the absorbing material is approaching us and must therefore
be moving away from the AGN. This last fact will be discussed in detail at a later time; however,
this discussion makes clear that these absorption lines offer a view into material that is flowing
out from the active nucleus, driven by some process that is connected with the overall energy
generation mechanism and hence fundamental to our understanding of the AGN itself.
The features observed in AGN spectrum range from features that are narrow (tens to hun-
dreds of km s−in width) to extremely broad (from 1 to 50,000 km s−). The former are found in
a majority of Seyfert galaxies, both in the optical/UV (e.g., >Fig. 7-37) and X-ray (>Fig. 7-14),
as well as in many quasars. When observed in Seyferts, these features have typical widths
of 20–400 km s−, while their more luminous cousins tend to have broader features, up to
∼1,000 km s−. The blueshifts of these features range from ∼0 to ∼2,000 km s−in Seyferts and up
to 5,000 km s−in more luminous quasars. These lines can be detectedwith only moderatespec-
tral resolution and signal to noise, given their high column depth. Typically, these features are
seen in C, N, and O in electric dipole transitions from the ground to high states – such as in the

seen including O VI λ 1034, Si IV λ 1400, Ly α, and Mg II λ 2800. High-resolution observations
reveal that these features are often quite complicated, as with the complex shown in >Fig. 7-37,
which has several components. These widths are much wider than the expected thermal widths
(a FWHMof9 km s−would be expected forcarbon at a temperature of20,000 K). This indicates
macroscopic motions within the absorbing gas.

Active Galactic Nuclei 7
361
A more spectacular form of absorption is seen in a minority of quasars, which exhibit broad
features that extend from 1,000 to as much as 60,000 km s−blueward of the quasar’s systemic
velocity (Weymann et al. 1991; see examples in >Fig. 7-38). These features, like their less spec-
tacular Seyfert cousins, are most often found in UV lines, although they are sometimes seen
in the Balmer lines. These features are typically highly saturated – in fact, so much flux can be
removed from the rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum that some quasars with these features (called
BAL, or broad absorption line, QSOs) will drop out of flux-limited optical samples. Therefore,
there is significant debate about the exact fraction of quasars with these features: although flux-
limited samples suggest the number is less than 10%, the extreme nature of some BAL features
suggests that the number may be significantly higher, perhaps as high as one-sixth (Reichard
et al. 2003a) of all quasars.
A wide range of BAL quasar types are seen – in some objects, known as miniBALs, the lines
are relatively modest in width (only a few thousand km s−at most), while in others, the lines
can be much broader. There is also a significant range in the types of lines where the BAL fea-
tures are seen, with some objects showing them only in low-ionization lines (the LoBALs) and
others showing them both in low- and high-ionization lines (HiBALs). The reader is referred
to Reichard et al. (2003b) for the relative fraction of these subclasses, as drawn from the SDSS
quasars. Delving into the taxonomy of each of these subclasses is beyond the scope of this work.
However, their common feature is the overall spectral morphology, which shows a classic P
Cygni-type line in the iconic objects, although in others where the absorption is heaviest and
covers the largest velocity range, the amount of continuum and line emission that is absorbed
makes the classical QSO spectral morphology of >Fig. 7-6 almost impossible to recognize.
Until very recently, BAL features were seen almost exclusively in radio-quiet objects. How-
ever, this is now known to be at some level a selection effect – BAL QSOs had first been identified
in optically selected samples, and the complete radio-selected samples known at the time sim-
ply were not deep enough to contain these objects in significant numbers. This began to change
with the identification of fainter radio quasars found in the FIRST sample (Brotherton et al.
1997, 1998) that were both clear BALs and clearly radio-loud. Later work with the SDSS verified
that optically selected samples also contained these objects (insert comment about the fraction
of these and whether there is any remaining dependence of BALnicity on radio-loudness).
The method that one would like to use to calculate the physical characteristics of these
absorbing systems is similar to that used for the emission line regions: photoionization
(>Sect. 5.4). This is the method of choice for the narrow absorption systems; however, in the
more spectacular BAL QSOs, it is by no means clear that hydrodynamic ionization does not
play a significant role.
Let us first consider the narrow absorption systems. One clue to their origin lies in the fact
that in nearly all AGN with such features, the depth of at least one component is sufficiently
large to indicate that the gas absorbs both the incident continuum as well as the broad emission
line flux (as in the case of component 4 seen in the spectrum of NGC 5548, >Fig. 7-37). This
material must therefore lie outside of the broad emission line region. Calculations based on
photoionization models typically yield density ranges n ∼–10cm−and ionization param-
eters of ∼0.01–1 in the UV-absorbing gas; higher ionization parameters and densities are seen
in the X-ray-absorbing gas. While these figures are somewhat lower than seen in the BLR, by
itself this puts only loose bounds on the relative location of the absorbing gas, which from other
considerations (see above) was already known to exist outside of the BLR.
A more recent constraint on this last question can be imposed from the existence of
variability in these features, which is commonly observed on timescales of months to years

(e.g., Crenshaw et al. 1999, 2004; George et al. 1998; Kraemer et al. 2001a, b). Deep analy-
sis of high-resolution, time-resolved spectra reveal that two mechanisms are at work: both
changes in the ionization of the gas, due to variations in the ionizing continuum, as well as
changes in the total column density due to, for example, bulk motion of the gas across the line
of sight are required to explain the variability observed. Kraemer et al. (2001b) was able to
map the absorbers in another Seyfert galaxy, NGC 4151, revealing a huge range in distances
(from 0.03 to 2,150 pc from the nucleus, that is, extending from just outside the BLR to the
larger galactic environment), number densities (n ∼−× cm−), and column densities
(NH ∼−×cm−). Both number and column densities typically decrease with distance,
but there are no other obvious correlations with distance.
BAL features are much more difficult to model. One reason for this lies in the morphol-
ogy of the lines – whereas the narrow absorption features found in Seyfert spectra are almost
entirely contained within the broad emission line’s blue wing, this is not at all the case in BAL
QSOs, which sometimes extend to blueshifted velocities much larger than the extent of the
BLR. In addition, there is a much broader range of optical depths observed as a function of
wavelength. Very often there are a significant range of wavelengths where the intensity goes to
zero – that is, the broad absorption feature has removed essentially all flux from the spectrum.
At other wavelengths, the absorption is only partial. The saturation of the absorption lines in
many BAL quasars indicates that these flows are very high column densities – at least 10cm−
and even higher, ranging up to 10cm−. Early X-ray observations also indicated that BAL
quasars appear less luminous (Green and Mathur 1996), which more modern observations with
Chandra and XMM-Newton suggest is due to the presence of large absorbing columns, which
in several sources appear to be Compton-thick or nearly so (Brotherton et al. 2005; Shemmer
et al. 2005; Gallagher et al. 2006; Giustini et al. 2008).
However, matters are not as simple as this. Naively, one would like to interpret the depth of
absorption simply as an indicator of the optical depth and hence the absorbing column: where
the flux goes to zero, the optical depth is several or higher, while where significant flux remains
the optical depth is lower. However, the saturated nature ofthese systems means that particularly
in the most opticallythick systems it is verydifficult toestimate the true column: the naïve calcu-
lation usually underestimates the true amount of material. This is partly due to the fact that the
absorber does not have the same depth along all lines of sight to the continuum emission region
(often referred to as partial covering). One might, for example, have very large optical depths
along some rays and much less optical depth along others. The correct mean column density,
averaged over the continuum source’s projected area, is then seriously underestimated. Another
complication is that higher-resolution observations of many BALs find that they have a consid-
erable complexity in structure (>Fig. 7-38), similar to their narrower cousins. In this case, also,
what appears to be partial absorption and modest optical depth could in fact be much larger
optical depth at some velocities, but no absorption at others. The inference of partial covering is
strongly supported by the observation that BAL quasars are much more highly polarized than
non-BAL objects, with polarizations as high as 10%, concentrated in the absorption troughs
(e.g., Ogle et al. 1999 and references therein). The simplest explanation of this is that the polar-
ized light is scattered by dust in the BAL clouds by a mechanism similar to that invoked for
Seyfert galaxies (e.g., electron scattering, as discussed by Wang et al. 2005). This also means
that the polarized light was originally emitted along another line of sight than ours, and thus
the column along that line of sight is different than our own.
Modeling of BAL systems indicates a higher ionization parameter than in narrow absorp-
tion systems, typically at least 1–10 given the presence of N V and O VI BAL features, but not
too much higher, as Mg II, CIII] C IV are also seen. It is possible, if not likely, that a range of

364 7
Active Galactic Nuclei
parameters is seen, but more work needs to be done here. It should also be noted that in BAL
systems the ionization balance is also more complex, likely having contributions from both
photoionization as well as hydrodynamic mechanisms. The distances of BAL regions from the
central engine is not well constrained by ionization models. The best constraints come from
observations of variability on timescales of months to years, which suggests distances of light-
years or less from the nucleus. This is on the same scale as the BLR in quasars, as opposed
to the narrow absorbers which are typically more distant. Another rough constraint can be
derived from the fact that BAL features often absorb both line and continuum flux: this fact
indicates that at least some of the BAL region lies beyond the BLR, although some overlap is
possible.
The best estimates of the densities in BAL regions come from the combined use of ioniza-
tion models with variability data, as pointed out by Krolik (1999). If, for example, the column
density is observed to decrease along with the object’s luminosity, then one may infer that
recombination dominates ionization so that

where Zeff is the charge of the ion and Δtrec is the timescale for an order unity change in the
ionic abundance due to recombination. Alternatively, if the column density increases as the flux
does, one would suggest that ionization by the increasing flux caused the change. Because the
absorbing matter is exactly along the line of sight, it sees the same ionizing luminosity, so one
can infer both an estimated location for the absorber (relative to the nucleus) as well as a density:

where Δtion is the timescale for an order unity change in the ionic abundance (note that in
this case photoionization dominates over any pressure terms). A third alternative is that the
column might vary independently of the object’s luminosity. In this last case, no such estimate
is possible as the changes would be the result of the cloud moving across our line of sight. It
should be noted that similar methods can also be used to infer the distance and density of
narrow absorbing clouds.
The exact geometry associated with these absorbing clouds is uncertain. The fact that the
narrow and broad variety of absorption features at least partially eat into the broad emission
lines suggests that the material must be at a different orientation than the torus, discussed in
the last section, as originally suggested by Weymann et al. (1991) for BAL QSOs. However, this
is not at all clear, and more complicated geometries are certainly possible, particularly with
a patchy torus composed of discrete, higher-density clouds as envisioned in the most recent
models. What is, however, known is that these absorption features are evidence of large-scale
mass outflows in AGN.
The kinematics observed in these lines show that the clouds that produce them are moving
out from the nucleus with velocities of hundreds to tens of thousands of km s−, at distances
of parsecs or more away from the nucleus. Such a flow will carry considerable momentum and
will deposit large amounts of energy into the regions that surround the AGN, in the process

also taking away from the active nucleus’s immediate environs material that might be used to
fuel future activity. The rate at which mass flows out is

where μH is the mean mass per H atom, r is the distance of the absorbing gas from the active
nucleus, Δr is the radial thickness of the absorbing shell, ⟨v⟩is the mean outflow velocity, ε is
the efficiency of accretion, τCIV is the optical depth in the C IV line, and XCIV is the abundance
of C IV. Particularly in luminous objects (e.g., quasars), this can be an interesting fraction of the
accretion rate:

(7.43)
Thus the existence of these clouds actually constitutes a major problem for BAL quasars as it
can remove from the nuclear regions almost as much matter as is accreting into the black hole!
Thus in these objects one is almost forced to conclude that the BAL stage must be transitory, a
point discussed also later.
A second question one must ask ourselves before leaving the subject of these outflows is,
exactly how are they driven? A number of mechanisms have been devised, including both
thermal and radiation-pressure driven mechanisms. If one assumes that the gas is heated to
a temperature such that its thermal energy matches its gravitational binding energy, then mat-
ter may be injected at some point; exposed to the AGN’s radiation, its temperature rises, and
once its temperature increases beyond the critical value, it is expelled. For this mechanism to
work, a heating mechanism is needed. Many are possible, including photoionization, Comp-
tonization, and collisions with energetic particles (see Begelman et al. 1991). If the heating rate
is parameterized by that due to Comptonization, which may not be too bad an approximation
as the rate of photoionization will be roughly dominated by radiative cooling, then the heating
criterion is

(7.44)
The above assumes that gas is injected with the kineticenergythat corresponds toa circularorbit
at radius r, μe is the mean mass per electron, and ϕ describes how different the true heating rate
is from that derived from Comptonization. Once the wind takes off, its temperature may not
need to maintain the Compton temperature TC referred to above, because adiabatic expansion
can compete with radiative heating. If one assumes that the wind achieves a Mach number of
order 1, then the Compton heating rate is balanced by an effective cooling per (mean) unit mass

This assumption also allows us to estimate the maximum electron scattering depth as
τT,max ∼U−(vorb/cs)(L/LE). In a thermally driven wind, the ratio of orbital speed to sound

Active Galactic Nuclei
speed will be ∼1, and because the critical ionization parameter for evaporation is ∼10 (see the
discussion in Chap. 10 of Krolik 1999), one can thus expect optical depths ∼.L/LE whenever
the luminosity is large enough to create the wind. These inferred conditions match fairly well to
those found in the warm X-ray absorbers associated with Seyfert galaxies. If the terminal Mach
numbers are few, then these winds can be expected to flow outward at several hundred km s−
and develop clouds within the flow that are at temperatures of tens of thousands of degrees,
which would match the properties of the narrow absorbers found in Seyfert 1 spectra.
Thus thermal mechanisms can drive the narrow absorption features but fail to achieve the
velocities necessary to drive the winds in BAL quasars. In those objects, radiative driving must
dominate. This mechanism is much more difficult to calculate, but if one assumes that the pri-
mary driving mechanism is due to Thomson scattering, photoionization codes may be used to
compute the distribution of opacities dNl/dκ (U), that is, the number of lines Nl with center
opacities κ. The equation of motion is then
v dv
dr = GM

M (NH, U)].
(7.46)
where M(NH, U) is a force multiplier that expresses the efficacy of line-driving over Thomson
scattering. This parameter can be as large as 10–100 if the C IV line is marginally optically thick.
It should be noted that radiative driving, augmented by winds, is a mechanism used to power
the outflows in OB stars, so its presence in quasars should not be surprising. Calculations by
Proga et al. (2000) and Chelouche and Netzer (2001) indicate that this mechanism can reach
the velocities necessary to drive BAL outflows.

Jets and Lobes in Radio Loud AGN
The distinguishing feature of radio-loud AGN are their jets, as well as the hotspots and lobes
seen at larger scale. These are features that, as already discussed, are also present in a significant
number of radio-quiet AGN as well, albeit at much lower power levels.
7.1 Acceleration of Jets
A suite of both modeling and observational evidence indicates that these jets must originate
deep within the central regions of an active nucleus. On the observational side, the evidence
comes from high-frequency VLBI mapping of the M87 jet (> Fig. 7-39, Walker et al. 2009;
Krichbaum et al. 2006), which shows that the jet extends very close to the central black hole
and even reveals the location where collimation is taking place. The expansion of the jet’s “cone”
appears in these images on scales smaller than 0.5 milliarcsec, which corresponds to about
150 RS for M87, and it continues in to distances of 0.1 milliarcsec from the VLBI core, which
likely constitutes the base of the jet. Therefore, whatever process first collimates these relativis-
tic outflows must occur on very small scales – within no more than 30 RS from the black hole.
Interestingly, however, the monitoring program that generated the images shown in >Fig. 7-39
did not show motions as fast as those seen on larger, arcsecond scales (>Fig. 7-22), where speeds
as high as ∼6c have been seen. On milliarcsecond scales, it is necessary to image the jet every
few weeks to reveal relativistic motions, but indeed, speeds as high as 2c are seen in the moni-
toring data. On the smallest scales (within 0.5 milliarcsec), the counterjet – that is, the flow that

Importantly, note that the jet takes up a constant angle up until the very smallest scales, when the 86-GHz image reveals that the initial expansion and
collimation region can be seen (traced out by red dotted lines) within the innermost 0.5 milliarcsecond of the jet. For reference, at the distance of M87
(16 Mpc), 1 milliarcsecond is 0.078 pc = 16,000 AU, or 300 times the Schwarzschild radius for a 3 × 109-M⊙black hole (Figures from Walker et al. (2009) and

emerges in the direction opposite to the jet seen at arcsecond scales – is measured. One can also
see in >Fig. 7-32 that the images of the jet have a very edge-brightened appearance. This sug-
gests that they are located along the jet’s outer edge, often called the “sheath.” Only much fainter
components can be seen in the inner part of the jet’s cross section, the “spine.” Many jet models
(e.g., Ghisellini et al. 2005) postulate that the spine should move at faster speeds, similar to the
center of the flow of a fire hose. There are no detected motions in this central region, but the
data are not deep enough to say this with confidence. However, it is clear that the acceleration
process must take place over a significantly larger scale than does the collimation of jets.
This recent observation set constitutes a challenging goal for models of jet generation to
meet – they need to be able to simulate the region very close to the central black hole, certainly
within a few tens of gravitational radii if not all the way to the ergosphere. Thus any modelfor jet
generation must include both special and general relativity, as well as a variety of other physics,
most particularly magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Moreover, if it is to model the generation,
acceleration, and collimation of the jet, it needs to cover a large dynamic range in angular scale.
This makes it very challenging for computational modeling. Because of this complexity, mod-
els of jet generation typically make a number of simplifying assumptions, in particular that of
axisymmetry, as well as essentially infinite conductivity, which together allow the equations of
ideal, relativistic MHD to be cast in a semianalytic form (e.g., Li et al. 1992; Contopoulos 1994;
Meier et al. 2001; Vlahakis and Königl 2003, 2004) via self-similarity arguments.
It is beyond the scope of this chapter to give a full treatment of the equations of MHD.
However, the differences between regular fluid flow and ideal MHD flow can be understood by
referring to >Fig. 7-38 (left-hand panel), which shows a three-dimensional GR-MHD simula-
tion of a magnetized jet’s propagation. As shown by >Fig. 7-40, the magnetic field lines thread
the plasma and are frozen in. These field lines restrict the flow of plasma to the parallel direc-
tion. Moreover, if the field is strong (i.e., if the plasma’s hydrodynamic pressure ρvis less than
the magnetic pressure B/π) and anchored in a rotating star or disk, then any plasma trapped
in the field will be flung centrifugally outward along the field lines. Another important point
is that parallel magnetic field lines tend to repel each other. This produces a pressure on the
plasma perpendicular to the field lines due solely to the magnetic field. A weak field can thus be
strengthened by bringing together many weak parallel lines of force to produce the equivalent
of a few strong ones. As a result, compression perpendicular to the field lines or toroidal coiling
can enhance the field. Finally, magnetic field lines do not maintain a curved shape unless they
are acted on by forces from the plasma or other field lines – if left alone, they will straighten
like springy wires, and if coiled in a hoop or spiral, the field will try to shrink around its axis to
eliminate all but the straight axial component.
Simulations (>Fig. 7-40, center and right panels) begin with a disk that is initially in rota-
tional equilibrium about the central black hole. Such a disk naturally rotates differentially. The
disk is also threaded with an axial (vertical) magnetic field that is sufficiently strong to exert a
braking force on the rotating plasma. As the simulation progresses, the magnetic field’s brak-
ing force removes angular momentum from the torus, transferring it up along magnetic field
lines into the coronal plasma, which is also frozen to the field lines. As these rotating magnetic
twists propagate out, they push out and pinch the coronal plasma into a spinning jet. As the
disk material loses angular momentum, it falls toward the central object, releasing half of its
gravitational energy into kinetic energy of rotation that continues to power the outflow. Thus
the production of a high-velocity outflow or jet is a natural and mandatory byproduct of the
accretion process where a strong magnetic field is present. The same process that generates the
jet is also behind the magnetorotational instability, and therefore it may be that the presence of

Propagation (left) and generation (center and right) of a magnetized jet by a supermassive black
hole and its accretion ﬂow. The diagram at left shows ﬂow velocity (arrows), plasma density (col-
ors, with white and blue lines indicating high and low pressure, respectively), and magnetic lines
of force (metallic tubes). In this simulation, the initially axisymmetric, rotating jet has developed
a helical-kink instability that distorts its shape; such an instability may explain some of the wig-
gles observed in parsec-scale jets. The feature at far right in this diagram is a strong shock wave
generated as the super-Alfvenic ﬂow propagates into a region with decreasing Alfven velocity. The
diagrams at center and right were generated from a simulation that included a thick, magnetized
toroidal disk surrounding a central 108 M⊙black hole. The center panel shows the initial state, with
the disk in rotational equilibrium with the axial magnetic ﬁeld. As time goes on, the diﬀerentially
rotating disk drags the ﬁeld lines in the azimuthal direction, creating a braking force that allows
material to accrete inward and gain additional rotational energy. This produces a torque on the
magnetic ﬁeld and generates a spinning plasma jet that carries away matter, angular momentum,
and energy, producing the conﬁguration seen at right (Figures from Meier et al. (2001, their Figs. 2
and 5))
such an axial magnetic field and hence the jet is a critical factor in removing angular momentum
from disk material as it spirals inward toward the black hole.
Most simulations show that the speed of the ejected outflow is close to the escape speed at
that radius – in other words, the magneticfield lines that are anchored to the disk closer in to the
black hole will produce a faster flow than those that are anchored at greater distances. Thus these
simulations reproduce the fire-hose-like velocity structure (“spine-sheath,” see above) hinted at
by the high-frequency VLBA images of M87. Simulations have been done both for nonrotating
(Schwarzschild) black holes as well as strongly rotating (Kerr) black holes. An outflow is gener-
ated in both cases, with a speed that is directly related to the escape velocity at the location of the
innermost stable orbit, which represents the accretion disk’s inner edge. In the Schwarzschild
case, the innermost stable orbit is at 3 RS, which makes the jet production region slightly larger,
and hence the speed of the outflow is ∼0.5c. However, in the maximal Kerr case, stable orbits
can exist right down to the event horizon, making the center of the jet production region much
smaller (similar in size to the ergosphere) and generating a faster outflow (∼0.9c, i.e., Lorentz
factor Γ = ). Thus the production of a relativistic jet is most likely tied to the spin of the black
hole. Furthermore, even if the disk surrounding a Kerr black hole is initially given no rotation,
a jet is still formed. This is because as matter plunges in to the ergosphere, it becomes caught up

370 7
Active Galactic Nuclei
in the rotating space around the black hole and then routed out into the jet. Thus the production
of the jet is intimately rooted in the coupling of the magnetic field with the black hole’s spin –
the so-called Blandford–Znajek (1977) mechanism.
It should be mentioned that the generation of jets through a thin accretion disk produces a
rather small luminosity. Therefore most jet generation models require a thick, more toroidally
shaped disk. This can be produced by advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), where
most of the disk’s thermal energy is carried into the black hole, as well as convection-dominated
solutions. These increase the power that one can generatethrough the Blandford–Znajek mech-
anism by orders of magnitude. However, to produce the most luminous quasars, it appears
necessary to combine the Blandford–Znajek mechanism operating on a thin disk with a rapidly
rotating Kerr black hole. This will have the effect of naturally thickening the disk on small scales,
through the frame dragging near the black hole’s ergosphere.
One additional factormust be considered, namely, the fact that the Blandford–Znajek mech-
anism does not by itself appear to accelerate jets to speeds fast enough to account for those seen
in VLBI monitoring (up to 40c), nor can it account for their collimation. To get Lorentz fac-
tors up to 40 requires an additional, distributed acceleration process. This is provided by ideal
MHD acceleration, which is by itself quite efficient, and powered by the pressure gradient in
the toroidal magnetic field within the rotating jet. It can be thought of as akin to the gradual
unwinding of a twisted rubber band and is by its very nature spatially extended. It naturally
produces a rough balance between the Poynting and kinetic fluxes. The process develops natu-
rally with the jet core due to compression by the hoop stress in the toroidal magnetic field. It is
this same process that helps to confine the inner core of the magnetic field; however, the outer
sheath of the jet must be confined by external pressure. These two can be driven together by a
disk wind, which might develop hydrodynamically and are also seen in radio-quiet AGN.
Another issue that is not well constrained is the makeup of jets – whether they are
positron/electron pair plasma, hadron dominated, or carry most of their energy as Poynting
flux. Part of the problem is that there are no easy diagnostics given the nearly complete ioniza-
tion of the jet material. Various methods have been derived to answer this issue, most of which
have so far come up with a negative answer, both at large and small scales, most of which have to
do with using the jet material as a Comptonization target (see >Sect. 7.3) and then predicting
the response. For examples, see Georganopoulos et al. (2005), Begelman and Sikora (1987), and
Sikora et al. (1997).
7.2 Propagation and Dynamics of Jets at Larger Scales
Once launched, the jet can carryawaya majorfraction ofthe kineticpowerand angularmomen-
tum that was within the disk. A jet of high power thus will remain collimated for very long
distance, flowing through the galaxy and out beyond it into the surrounding cluster – as is
indeed seen in virtually all sources. As the jet propagates, the magnetic field is carried along with
it, and once the jet has reached its terminal velocity, the magnetic field lines will be essentially
along the jet direction.
Jets are prone to a number of instabilities. Included among these are Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities, as well as waves, pinches, and bends. Simulations of these have been performed
by many workers, including Aloy et al. (2003), Hughes et al. (2002, 1996), Hardee et al.
(2001, 2005, 2007), Hardee (2003), and Hardee and Rosen (2002). These simulations show that
instabilities, perhaps combined with natural variations in the flow of material down the jet, can

Active Galactic Nuclei 7
371
produce many of the moving and stationary features in VLBI and VLA maps and also pro-
vide a natural mechanism for producing flares such as those seen in blazars as well as the M87
jet. As instabilities propagate, shock waves are generated, changing the direction of the local
magnetic field.
Polarization observations, both in the radioand in the optical, reveal the complexityofmany
ofthese features. An example is shown in >Fig. 7-41, which shows VLAand HST polarimetry of
the jet of M87 (Perlman et al. 1999) on arcsecond (kiloparsec) scales. These maps reveal a wealth
of detail, with complex structure in several of the knots, including evidence for compressed
magnetic fields (as predicted in shock models) as well as rotations in the magnetic field. Several
jet regions show a higher polarization at the jet edges, indicating shear by the surrounding
interstellar medium. At least four inner jet knots show strong decreases of polarization at the
position of the flux maximum. Closer examination of these figures shows that several of the
knots have changes in optical polarization that are not seen in the radio. These include large

changes in the optical, including perpendicular magnetic ﬁelds and reduced polarization, that are
not seen in theradio. Thesesuggest that theoptical emission from the M87 jet comesmainly from a
region distinct from the radio emission (suggested to be the jet spine), while radio emission comes
from the entire cross section (Figures adapted from Perlman et al. (1999))

rotations (near 90○) in magnetic field direction as well as decreases in the polarization fraction,
in some cases to near zero. The explanation suggested for this phenomenon was that the optical
emission and the jet shocks come largely from the jet’s interior or spine region, while the radio
emission comes from the entire jet cross section. Shocks would accelerate particles and thus
be seen as enhanced emission first within the optical. Later multiband imaging (Perlman et al.
2001a) supported this scenario, as dramatic spectral index changes are seen in knot regions
in the optical, but not in the radio. Later work on several other FR I radio galaxy jets reveals a
similarpattern – not onlydothe jet dynamics reflect themselves in the polarimetryin the optical
but also a spine-sheath pattern to the jet flow appears common, with more subtle changes also
seen that indicate a variety of different disturbances in those jets, including twists as well as
other features.
Emission at higher energies (optical, X-rays) is seen in over three dozen jets now, thanks
to observations by the HST and Chandra (e.g., > Fig. 7-42). The next section discusses the
emission mechanisms for these large-scale jets in the next section; however, it is worth noting
here that optical and X-ray emission from jets is often concentrated within the brighter knots
in the inner jet and often does not appear to occupy the entire jet cross section.
Finally, it is worth discussing in this respect the effect that the jet will have on its surround-
ings. As the jet propagates, it carries with it an enormous amount of kinetic flux (up to 10ergs),
and even though the flow is usually lower density than the surrounding medium, because of its
high speed, it will deposit large amounts of energy into the surrounding regions. A number
of effects can be stimulated, including star formation as well as hydrodynamic shockwaves that
result in heating of the galactic and clustermedium. Simulations by O’Neill et al. (2005) indicate

Multispectral appearances of the jets of M87 and 3C273. The optically visible portion of the jet of
M87 (shown) extends about 7,000 light-years from the nucleus (at left in the image at bottom) and
feeds plasma to lobes that span 200,000 light-years. The bright portion of the jet of 3C273 extends
for a projected distance of 90,000 light-years, beginning with a bright knot approximately 100,000
light-years from the host galaxy’s nucleus (which is 12′′ oﬀto the left side in the image shown).

that even light jets will deposit approximately half of their kinetic flux as thermal energy in the
surrounding medium. Half of this would go directly into dissipative heating of the ICM, which
is believed to be needed to support the reheating of the cluster gas against cooling flows. The
remainder of the energy would reside primarily in the surrounding cocoon, which has been
observed in jets on large scales (see >Fig. 7-8 for examples). Interestingly, these same simu-
lations show that jets at low Mach numbers are more easily bent and disrupted. As a result, it
seems likely that the Fanaroff-Riley divide is not only a reflection of the power of the outflow
and AGN process but also the Mach number of the jet flow.
7.3 Emission Mechanisms in Jets
The emission from the jets and lobes of active galaxies at lower (radio through optical) energies
is normally interpreted in the framework of synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons
whirling around in the magnetic field of the jet. Basic electromagnetic theory shows that elec-
trons in a magnetic field propagate along helical, that is, corkscrew-shaped paths, so that they
are constantly accelerated by the Lorentz force. Accelerated electrons also emit electromagnetic
radiation in the form of synchrotron emission. If an electron has Lorentz factor γ, this emission
has a characteristic frequency
νc = γeB
πmec ≈.× γ( B
G ) Hz,
(7.47)
where Bis the magneticfield strength, e is the electron charge, and me is the mass ofthe electron.
For frequencies considerably lower than νc, the spectrum of a single electron is proportional
to ν/, whereas at larger frequencies it decreases exponentially. As the synchrotron emission is
seen over several decades of frequency, to a first approximation, the spectrum of a single elec-
tron can be considered as quasi-monochromatic, as it radiates over a very small energy range.
To produce radiation at centimeter wavelengths in a ∼100 μG magnetic field, Lorentz factors
γ ∼are required, that is, the electrons need to be highly relativistic. To attain such high
energies, particles must be accelerated very efficiently in the inner regions of AGN, particularly
in some objects where synchrotron radiation is observed up through X-ray energies. The mech-
anism for this particle acceleration is believedto be diffusive shock acceleration. Diffusive shock
acceleration naturally produces a power-law distribution of particle energies (see e.g., Longair
1994), with a number density N (E) dE ∝E−sdE. It is easy to show that the synchrotron radi-
ation from a population of particles that has a power-law energy distribution will also be a
power law, with spectral index α = (s −)/. An observed spectral index of α = .results
from a particle energy spectral index of s = ., which is very similar to the energy distribution
of cosmic rays observed from Earth. Thus the synchrotron emission observed in AGN results
from a population of energetic electrons that covers a wide range of energies.
At low frequencies, the optical depth for absorption due to the synchrotron process can
become significant. When this optical depth is close to or larger than 1, a source is called syn-
chrotron self-absorbed. Such a source can have a significantly flatter spectrum, and for a small
frequency interval, it may even rise. In the limiting case of infinite optical depth, the spectral
shape approaches Sν ∝ν.at low frequencies. It is synchrotron self-absorption that accounts
for the rather different spectral morphology of the compact radio-emitting components.

The electrons in the emitting region lose energy through emission. The power emitted by
an electron of Lorentz factor γ, integrated over all frequencies, is

where, in the last form, UB is the energy in the magnetic field. The characteristic time in which

years.
(7.49)
As the cooling time tcool depends on γ−, it is thus dependent also on ν−. For low-frequency
(meter-wave and longer) radio emission, this lifetime is longer than or comparable to the age
of radio sources. But at higher frequencies, the cooling time becomes important, with optical
synchrotron-emitting particles having radiative lifetimes typically in the hundreds of years, and
X-ray synchrotron-emitting particles having radiative lifetimes of only a few years. The fact that
optical and X-ray synchrotron emission are observed in a significant number of objects (see
later in this chapter) means that the processes of particle acceleration are not confined to the
innermost regions of an AGN but must also occur at large distances (many kiloparsecs) from
the central black hole.
Since the characteristic frequency (> 7.47) of synchrotron emission depends on both the
radiating particle’s Lorentz factor γ and the magnetic field B, it is impossible to measure both
quantities independently. In order to estimate the magnetic field strength, it is often assumed
that energy is divided equally between the particles and the magnetic field (this is often called
equipartition). A second, more sophisticated approach is to first estimate the magnetic field
such that the total energy of the relativistic electrons and magnetic field is minimized for a
given luminosity. It can thus be shown that equipartition represents the minimum energy state
for the macroscopic system and is thus a plausible, if not a physically accurate, representation
of the physical state of the radiating region.
A second process, that of inverse-Compton scattering (already discussed in >Sect. 4.3),
also occurs in AGN jets. It is trivial to show that if the input spectrum is a power law, then
the inverse-Compton process produces a power law with the same slope. The photons being
scattered (the so-called seed photons) can come from a variety of sources – either from the
jet itself (often referred to as synchrotron self-Compton), the broad or narrow-line regions,
the torus, starlight, or even the cosmic microwave background. Models of AGN jet emission
must take all of these regions into account as possible seed photon sources. In >Fig. 7-43, an
example jet spectrum is shown that takes into account not only the synchrotron process but
also Comptonization from broad-line photons.
Two issues must be mentioned when discussing >Fig. 7-43. The first is that multiple Comp-
tonization processes are possible. One uses synchrotron photons generated within the jet (called
synchrotron self-Compton or SSC). For SSC, so long as one can use the Thomson cross section
(see below), one can derive that the power radiated via the inverse-Compton process is

This is almost identical to the form discussed earlier ( > 7.49) for synchrotron energy, with
the exception that in place of UB, the energy density in the magnetic field, one has Urad, the

At most energies, the cross section for Compton scattering is simply the Thomson cross-section.
However, at high energies, when x = hν/mec≥, it is necessary to use a result from quantum
electrodynamics, namely, the Klein-Nishina cross section,

(7.52)

Active Galactic Nuclei
The Klein-Nishina cross section is an energy-dependent modification to the Thomson cross
section. At low energies (x ≪), it reduces to the Thomson cross section, but at high energies
it decreases roughly as /x. A rough rule of thumb is that the Klein-Nishina cross section is
dominant when εoγ ∼where εo is the photon energy and γ is the Lorentz factor of the particles.
A second type of Comptonization process is also possible, where the seed photons come
from outside the jet. This process, called external Compton or EC, can use seed photons either
from the BLR (at small scales), the torus, starlight, or(at the largest scales)the cosmicmicrowave
background. Which process will be dominant in a given jet depends only on the energy density
of the various photon populations in the jet’s comoving frame.
Thus, it is noted that >Fig. 7-43 was created with parameters that match 3C 279, a typi-
cal Compton-dominated source. One can see in >Fig. 7-43 a number of features due to the
Klein-Nishina cross section. For example, there is a “hump” at optical-UV energies, where both
jet and BLR seed photons are present with εwγ ∼. As a result, the scatters that produce GeV
photons will occur between the Thomson and Klein-Nishina regime, producing a flat or rising
GeV spectrum, as well as achromatic GeV variability, with the latter occurring because elec-
tron cooling is not energy dependent in the valley between the Thomson and Klein-Nishina
regime. These predictions are just beginning to be tested with data. CGRO observations of 3C
279 find a fairly flat spectrum at high energies (Joshi et al. 2011; For a counterexample, however,
see Ackerman et al. 2010).
The second remark that needs to be made concerns the nature of the variability one will
observe in a given source, for it is through observing variability in coordinated, multiwaveband
campaigns that models of this sort can be tested. In most of the environments within AGN jets
and lobes, the source is optically thin – that is, a given photon will scatter at most once before it
escapes the source. Therefore the response that one would expect at gamma-ray energies would
be what is known as quadratic variability – that is to say, if the source increases in flux by a
factor of 2 at lower energies (i.e., in its synchrotron component), an increase of a factor 4 in its
gamma-ray flux would be seen. This is the expectation if a source’s inverse-Compton emission
is roughly equal or less than its synchrotron emission, as in BL Lacs. This is shown in >Fig. 7-43
by the lowest-luminosity set of curves.
This argument led early workers, notably Wehrle et al. (1998), to argue that due to the obser-
vation of superquadratic variability in 3C 279, an additional seed photon source, believed to be
the BLR, might be needed. In 3C 279, a bright blazar with prominent broad lines, it might be
natural to expect EC to contribute significantly to the observed high-energy emissions of the
source; it is important to note that the data do not yet require BLR seed photons to be invoked.
However, while attractive, this argument is not strictly correct.
In more luminous sources, such as 3C 279, the efficiency of Comptonization increases,
as the increased number of seed photons increases the number of photon-electron collisions.
After a certain point, the source will not be optically thin to Comptonization, and in fact in
the most luminous sources it is Comptonization, rather than synchrotron emission, that repre-
sents the primary cooling channel for jet electrons. In these sources, the jet becomes optically
thick to Compton scattering. As a result, one can get a superquadratic variability response, as
pointed out by Georganopoulos et al. (2006), even without invoking an external seed photon
source. >Figure 7-44 shows how the response of the spectrum changes as the luminosity of the
synchrotron component, and corresponding dominance of the Compton channel goes up.
Observational data are now becoming good enough where direct tests of some of these
models are possible. The most direct way to test these models directly is with multiwave-
band campaigns, which use the fact that different physical models of emission and/or jet

Example spectral response for variable sources. Synchrotron emission is seen in the left-hand
curves, whereas SSC emission is seen in the right-hand curves. As can be seen, as the dominance of
Compton cooling increases, the source becomes optically thick to Comptonization. These second-
order reactions cause superquadratic variability without the need for an external seed photon
source
compression/expansion predict different responses from different jet bands. If for example, one
is observing purely synchrotron emission where the main jet cooling process at X-rays is due
to synchrotron emission, one would expect to observe not only correlated variability between
bands but also an energy-dependentresponse during the cooling phase, with less energetic pho-
tons taking longer to cool, and the jet spectrum softening during the cooling process. This has
been observed in the X-ray band during many BL Lac observations (e.g., Fossati et al. 2008). An
alternate possibility, however, is that adiabatic expansion may dominate the cooling process, at
least between bands, and this would predict no change in the SED as the source cools.
Multiwaveband campaigns can be used to test the latter set of comments regarding
superquadratic variability. This was done recently by Aharonian et al. (2009) for the exceptional
gamma-ray variability episodes of PKS 2155–304 during 2006. As can be seen (>Fig. 7-45), at
that epoch, PKS 2155 exhibited variations that were very similar in X-ray and TeV gamma-rays,
but those bands were not correlated with the optical emission. Moreover, the response of the
SED to the variations was not the classical quadratic one would expect – instead, nearly cubic
behaviorwas commonlyseen, as shown in >Fig. 7-38. This demonstrates the viabilityofthe SSC
mechanism for producing superquadratic variations. However, the lack of correlation between
the X-ray/TeV and optical lightcurves led Aharonian et al. (2009) to invoke a multizone model.
As noted earlier, high-energy emissions are also seen from jets on kiloparsec scales. Here it
is not so easy to find diagnostics to test the viability of emission mechanisms. While at optical

and radio energies, synchrotron emission is the natural interpretation, supported bythe spectral
shape and high polarization; at X-ray energies synchrotron, and Comptonization mechanisms
are both possible. For FR I sources, it is likely that synchrotron emission is the dominant X-ray
emission mechanism. This is for several reasons. First of all, the observed optical-radio emission

Active Galactic Nuclei 7

component is seen to extrapolate to X-ray energies, albeit with breaks that may be steeper than
the classical 0.5 and evidence that only a fraction of the jet cross section radiates at these high
energies (see, e.g., Hardcastle et al. 2001; Marshall et al. 2002; Perlman and Wilson 2005). In
addition, the variability observed in M87’s knot HST-1 weighs heavily in favor of synchrotron
X-ray emission.
For more luminous, FR II sources, however, the jury is still out on the X-ray emission
process (Harris and Krawczynski 2002, 2006; Hardcastle et al. 2004). The SSC mechanism is
highly unlikely because it requires the jet to be massively out of equipartition; moreover, the
observed morphology, whereby the jet emission is seen primarily within knots, also argues
against it. However, two other mechanisms are possible, namely, synchrotron emission and
Comptonization of the cosmic microwave background photons. Both processes appear to be
viable at present. In some sources, for example, 3C 273 (shown in >Fig. 7-40) and PKS 1136–
135, the optical-UV spectrum appears to extend to high energies and connect with the Chandra
emissions, and high optical polarizations are detected (Cara et al. 2010), the latter ruling out
Comptonization of an unpolarized photon population (Uchiyama and Coppi 2010; McNamara
et al. 2009). However, in other sources, notably PKS 0637–752 (Mehta et al. 2009), the valley
in between the radio-optical and X-ray components is extreme, and a separate mechanism is
needed, which is more likely to be EC/CMB.

Final Remarks
This chapter has discussed active galactic nuclei in considerable depth, including their proper-
ties, the current state of unified schemes, and the emission mechanisms required. As detailed in
the discussion above, the evidence for the unified scheme is quite strong, so that active galaxies
comprise a particular subset of the supermassive black holes that lie at the center of all bright,
massive galaxies. As detailed in further chapters ( > Chaps. 10 and
> 11), these galaxies –
and thus the black holes located at their centers – presumably grew hierarchically from initial
density perturbations through merging of smaller galaxies into the objects seen today.
Yet despite all this discussion, the one question left unexplored is fairly basic – namely, what
actually makes a given galaxy’s nucleus become active. It is fairly easy to prove that 100 million
solar mass black hole, accreting at the Eddington rate, will exhaust the nuclear medium that
feeds its activity in a small fraction of the Hubble time, ∼a few tens of millions of years. Thus it
is important to realize that the AGN phase represents a small fraction of the life cycle of a given
galaxy. Moreover, in order to maintain the number of AGN seen today, it is necessary to assume
that most or all bright galaxies go through an AGN phase at some time within their history but
remain quiescent for the vast majority of their history.
Turning this argument around, then, a fully self-consistent understanding of the AGN phe-
nomenon requires a working mechanism to transform a hitherto-inactive galaxy into an active
one. Such a mechanism would need to be able to force large amounts of material into the galaxy’s
central regions, as observations of bulges (particularly in massive galaxies) have consistently
shown that the central bulges of galaxies represent an environment where many generations of
star formation have exhausted the nuclear ISM, leaving it with much less material than would
be required to support nuclear activity. An example of such an object would be our own galaxy,
which possesses a supermassive black hole (Sag A∗) that is, compared to the galaxies discussed
in this chapter, remarkably inactive – estimates of its accretion luminosity are in the range of
∼10−times the Eddington rate.

Active Galactic Nuclei
The most consistent mechanism for such a transformation lies in the interaction and
merging process that each galaxy undergoes throughout its history. Simulations of galactic
interactions show that the merger process profoundly disturbs the matter distribution of each
(e.g., Mihos and Hernquist 1996), eventually producing out of the merger a single aggregate
elliptical galaxy (Barnes and Hernquist 1992) that takes several dynamical times (hundreds of
millions of years) to fully relax. As the product galaxy is forming, material from the interstellar
media of both galaxies falls toward the center of the aggregate. Moreover, at the same time, the
central black holes of the two galaxies are also falling towards one another and will eventually
merge. This latter point is actually important because it is difficult if not impossible to spin up
a black hole in any way other than by merging it with another black hole that comes in with a
different angular momentum and a considerable fraction of its mass.
It was for these reasons that Wilson and Colbert (1995) first proposed that a major merger
of two disk galaxies could provide the mechanism for producing an active nucleus, particularly
one that is radio-loud. The Wilson-Colbert hypothesis explains the strong correlation between
radio-loud AGN and giant elliptical host galaxies ( >Chap. 11) as well as the relative num-
bers of radio-quiet and radio-loud AGN, the latter being a by-product of the fact that most
mergers are not of nearly equal mass objects, where the central black hole could be spun up.
An unequal merger could then ignite activity, but not necessarily the ejection of jets, which
appears to require a strong black hole spin. Under the merging scenario, an initial merger of disk
galaxies at high redshift and their individual supermassive black holes would create a rapidly
spinning product black hole and a luminous AGN. However, as the surrounding clusterorgroup
of galaxies in which the AGN is embedded develops a hot ICM, a large fraction of the cluster
galaxies will be stripped of most of their gas, thus ensuring that subsequent mergers are “dry,”
and provide less and less accretion power.
The merger scenario is supported by the discovery of twin, active black holes in the centers
of two ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), NGC 6240 and Mrk 463 (Komossa et al. 2003;
Bianchi et al. 2008). If the merger scenario is correct, these objects would represent an inter-
mediate stage in the AGN development process, wherein the black holes are merging. Indeed,
the host galaxies are clearly merger products, with their nuclei separated by a few kiloparsecs.
A second line of evidence supporting the merger hypothesis is that HST imaging of the nearest
compact symmetric objects (CSOs), which represent the very youngest of radio sources, appear
to require that they underwent a major merger a few hundred million years ago (Perlman et al.
2001b) – long enough in the past that the merger of the black holes may either be in process
or have taken place (e.g., Begelman et al. 1984) but also recently enough so that the nuclear
medium would be expected to be dense enough to fuel an AGN. This delay of a few hun-
dred million years is actually supported by the simulations, which show that the length of time
required to force gas to the aggregate center is of the same order (di Matteo et al. 2005, 2008;
Hopkins et al. 2005, 2006, 2008a, b; Springel et al. 2005a, b). It should be mentioned that in
quasars, this phase might also correspond to the BAL stage, when the active nucleus is most
dense. In such a case, one would expect that the luminosity of the AGN would peak when the
object is very young and then decrease as the AGN ages and the amount of material available
for accretion decreases. The latter mechanism has been used by Bicknell et al. (1997) to attempt
to fit the luminosity function of CSOs as compared to FR II and FR I galaxies. Finally, some very
recent work (Batcheldor et al. 2010) on M87 indicates that its supermassive black hole does not
in fact lie in the galaxy’s dynamical center but rather is offset from the center of the isophotes by
7 pc (projected), along the direction opposite to the jet. The most consistent explanation for this

Active Galactic Nuclei 7
381
result is either that the black hole is displaced as a result of gravitational recoil resulting from
the coalescence of binary supermassive black holes, or that it was accelerated by an intrinsically
asymmetric jet. Since the latter hypothesis is not suggested by any other evidence, whereas the
possibility of gravitational recoil is predicted by models of black hole mergers (e.g., Tichy and
Marronetti 2007), which show that when two spinning black holes merge, gravitational waves
can produce a kick of hundreds of km s−that damp out on Gyr timescales (Gualandris and
Merritt 2008). Note, however, that due to the long damping timescale, any merger of spinning
supermassive black holes can produce such an offset – not merely the one that might have been
the activity’s proximate cause.
As of the current writing, this merger scenario represents the leading hypothesis for the
development of an active nucleus. Besides fleshing out various aspects of AGN properties and
physics, it is therefore important to also test this mechanism for the development of nuclear
activity.

The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
Abstract:
Galaxies are not uniformly distributed in space. On large scales, the Universe dis-
plays coherent structure, with galaxies residing in groups and clusters on scales of∼1–3 h−Mpc,
which lie at the intersections of long filaments of galaxies that are >10 h−Mpc in length. Vast
regions of relatively empty space, known as voids, contain very few galaxies and span the volume
in between these structures. This observed large-scale structure depends both on cosmological
parameters and on the formation and evolution of galaxies. Using the two-point correlation
function, one can trace the dependence of large-scale structure on galaxy properties, such as
luminosity, color, stellar mass, and track its evolution with redshift. Comparison of the observed
galaxy clustering signatures with dark matter simulations allows one to model and understand
the clustering of galaxies and their formation and evolution within their parent dark matter
halos. Clustering measurements can determine the parent dark matter halo mass of a given
galaxy population, connect observed galaxy populations at different epochs, and constrain cos-
mological parameters and galaxy evolution models. This chapter describes the methods used
to measure the two-point correlation function in both redshift and real space, presents the cur-
rent results of how the clustering amplitude depends on various galaxy properties, and discusses
quantitative measurements of the structures of voids and filaments. The interpretation of these
results with current theoretical models is also presented.
1
Historical Background
Large-scale structure is defined as the structure or inhomogeneity of the Universe on scales
larger than that of a galaxy. The idea of whether galaxies are distributed uniformly in space can
be traced to Edwin Hubble, who used his catalog of 400 “extragalactic nebulae” to test the homo-
geneityofthe Universe (Hubble 1926), finding it tobe generallyuniform on large scales. In 1932,
the larger Shapley-Ames catalog of bright galaxies was published (Shapley and Ames 1932), in
which the authors note “the general unevenness in distribution” of the galaxies projected onto
the plane of the sky and the roughly factor of 2 difference in the numbers of galaxies in the
northern and southern galactic hemispheres. Using this larger statistical sample, Hubble (1934)
noted that on angular scales less than ∼10○, there is an excess in the number counts of galaxies
above what would be expected for a random Poisson distribution, though the sample follows a
Gaussian distribution on larger scales. Hence, while the Universe appears to be homogeneous
on the largest scales, on smaller scales it is clearly clumpy.
Measurements of large-scale structure took a major leap forward with the Lick galaxy cat-
alog produced by Shane and Wirtanen (1967), which contained information on roughly a
million galaxies obtained using photographic plates at the 0.5-m refractor at Lick Observatory.
Seldner et al. (1977) published maps of the counts of galaxies in angular cells across the sky
(see >Fig. 8-1), which showed in much greater detail that the projected distribution of galax-
ies on the plane of the sky is not uniform. The maps display a rich structure with a foamlike
pattern containing possible walls or filaments with long strands of galaxies, clusters, and large
empty regions (see
>Chap. 6). The statistical spatial distribution of galaxies from this cata-
log and that of Zwicky et al. (1968) was analyzed by Jim Peebles and collaborators in a series of
papers (e.g., Peebles 1975) that showed that the angular two-point correlation function (defined
below) roughly follows a power-law distribution over angular scales of ∼0.1–5○. In these papers
it was discovered that the clustering amplitude is lower for fainter galaxy populations, which

Angular distribution of counts of galaxies brighter than B ∼19 on the plane of the sky recon-
structed from the Lick galaxy catalog (from Seldner et al. 1977, reproduction created by Ed Groth).
This image shows the number of galaxies observed in 10′ × 10′cells across the northern galactic
hemisphere, where brighter cells contain more galaxies. The northern galactic pole is at the cen-
ter, with the galactic equator at the edge. The distribution of galaxies is clearly not uniform; clumps
of galaxies are seen in white, with very few galaxies observed in the dark regions between
likely arises from larger projection effects along the line of sight. As faint galaxies typically lie at
larger distances, the projected clustering integrates over a wider volume of space and therefore
dilutes the effect.
These results in part spurred the first large scale redshift surveys, which obtained optical
spectra of individual galaxies in order to measure the redshifts and spatial distributions of
large galaxy samples. Pioneering work by Gregory and Thompson (1978) mapped the three-
dimensional spatial distribution of 238 galaxies around and towards the Coma/Abell 1367
supercluster. In addition tosurveying the galaxies in the supercluster, theyfound that in the fore-
ground at lower redshift there were large regions (>h−Mpc, shown well in their Figure 2a)
with no galaxies, which they termed “voids.” Joeveer et al. (1978) used redshift information
from Sandge and Tammann (1975) to map the three-dimensional distribution of galaxies on
large scales in the southern galactic hemisphere. They mapped four separate volumes that
included clusters as well as field galaxies and showed that across large volumes, galaxies are
clearly clustered in three dimensions and often form “chains” of clusters (now recognized as
filaments).
Two additional redshifts surveys were the KOS survey(Kirshner et al. 1978) and the original
CfA survey (Davis et al. 1982). The KOS survey measured redshifts for 164 galaxies brighter
than magnitude 15 in eight separate fields on the sky, covering a total of 15 deg. Part of the

390 8
The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
motivation for the survey was to study the three dimensional spatial distribution of galaxies,
about which the authors note that “although not entirely unexpected, it is striking how strongly
clustered our galaxies are in velocity space,” as seen in strongly peaked one dimensional redshift
histograms in each field.
The original CfA survey, completed in 1982, contained redshifts for 2,400 galaxies brighter
than magnitude 14.5 across the north and south galactic poles, covering a total of 2.7 stera-
dians. The major aims of the survey were cosmological and included quantifying the clus-
tering of galaxies in three-dimensions. This survey produced large area, moderately deep
three dimensional maps of large-scale structure (see > Fig. 8-2), in which one could iden-
tify galaxy clusters, voids, and an apparent “filamentary connected structure” between groups
of galaxies, which the authors caution could be random projections of distinct structures
(Davis et al. 1982). This paper also performed a comparison of the so-called complex topol-
ogy of the large-scale structure seen in the galaxy distribution with that seen in N-body
dark matter simulations, paving the way for future studies of theoretical models of structure
formation.
The second CfA redshift survey, which ran from 1985 to 1995, contained spectra for ∼5,800
galaxies and revealed the existence of the so-called Great Wall, a supercluster of galaxies that
extends over 170 h−Mpc, the width of the survey (Geller and Huchra 1989). Large underdense
voids were also commonly found, with a density 20% of the mean density.
Redshift surveys have rapidly progressed with the development of multi-object spectro-
graphs, which allow simultaneous observations of hundreds of galaxies, and larger telescopes,

which allow deeper surveys of both lower luminosity nearby galaxies and more distant, lumi-
nous galaxies. At present, the largest redshift surveys of galaxies at low redshift are the Two
Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS, Colless et al. 2001) and the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey 9SDSS, York et al. 2000), which cover volumes of ∼× hMpc−and ∼× h
Mpc−with spectroscopic redshifts for ∼220,000 and a million galaxies, respectively. These sur-
veys provide the best current maps of large-scale structure in the Universe today (see >Fig. 8-3),
revealing a spongelike pattern to the distribution of galaxies (Gott et al. 1986). Voids of ∼10 h−
Mpc are clearly seen, containing very few galaxies. Filaments stretching greaterthan 10 h−Mpc
surround the voids and intersect at the locations of galaxy groups and clusters.
The prevailing theoretical paradigm regarding the existence of large-scale structure is that
the initial fluctuations in the energy density of the early Universe, seen as temperature devi-
ations in the cosmic microwave background, grow through gravitational instability into the
structure seen today in the galaxy density field. The details of large-scale structure – the sizes,
densities, and distribution of the observed structure – depend both on cosmological parame-
ters such as the matter density and dark energy, as well as on the physics of galaxy formation
and evolution. Measurements of large-scale structure can therefore constrain both cosmology
(see
>Chap. 13) and galaxy evolution physics.
2
The Two-Point Correlation Function
In order to quantify the clustering of galaxies, one must survey not only galaxies in clusters (see
>Chap. 6) but rather the entire galaxy density distribution, from voids to superclusters. The
most commonly used quantitative measure of large-scale structure is the galaxy two-point cor-
relation function, ξ(r), which traces the amplitude of galaxy clustering as a function of scale.

392 8
The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
ξ(r) is defined as a measure of the excess probability dP, above what is expected for an unclus-
tered random Poisson distribution, of finding a galaxy in a volume element dV at a separation
r from another galaxy,
dP = n[+ ξ(r)]dV,
(8.1)
where n is the mean number density of the galaxy sample in question (Peebles 1980). Measure-
ments of ξ(r) are generally performed in comoving space, with r having units of h−Mpc. The
Fourier transform of the two-point correlation function is the power spectrum, which is often
used to describe density fluctuations observed in the cosmic microwave background.
To measure ξ(r), one counts pairs of galaxies as a function of separation and divides by what
is expected for an unclustered distribution. To do this, one must construct a “random catalog”
that has the identical three-dimensional coverage as the data – including the same sky coverage
and smoothed redshift distribution – but is populated with random distribution points. The
ratio of pairs of galaxies observed in the data relative to pairs of points in the random catalog is
then used to estimate ξ(r). Several different estimators for ξ(r) have been proposed and tested.
An early estimator that was widely used is from Davis and Peebles (1983),
ξ = nR
nD
DD
DR −,
(8.2)
where DD and DR are counts of pairs of galaxies (in bins of separation) in the data catalog
and between the data and random catalogs, and nD and nR are the mean number densities of
galaxies in the data and random catalogs. Hamilton (1993) later introduced an estimator with
smaller statistical errors,
ξ = DD RR
(DR)−,
(8.3)
where RR is the count of pairs of galaxies as a function of separation in the random catalog. The
most commonly used estimator is from Landy and Szalay (1993),
ξ =

RR [DD ( nR
nD
)

−DR ( nR
nD
) + RR].
(8.4)
This estimator has been shown to perform as well as the Hamilton estimator (>8.3), and while it
requires more computational time, it is less sensitive to the size of the random catalog and han-
dles edge corrections well, which can affect clustering measurements on large scales (Kerscher
et al. 2000).
As can be seen from the form of the estimators given above, measuring ξ(r) depends sen-
sitively on having a random catalog which accurately reflects the various spatial and redshift
selection affects in the data. These can include effects such as edges of slitmasks or fiber plates,
overlapping slitmasks or plates, gaps between chips on the CCD, and changes in spatial sensi-
tivity within the detector (i.e., the effective radial dependence within X-ray detectors). If one
is measuring a full three-dimensional correlation function (discussed below), then the ran-
dom catalog must also accurately include the redshift selection of the data. The random catalog
should also be large enough to not introduce Poisson error in the estimator. This can be checked
by ensuring that the RR pair counts in the smallest bin are high enough such that Poisson errors
are subdominant.

Angular Clustering
The spatial distribution of galaxies can be measured either in two dimensions as projected
onto the plane of the sky or in three dimensions using the redshift of each galaxy. As it can
be observationally expensive to obtain spectra for large samples of (particularly faint) galax-
ies, redshift information is not always available for a given sample. One can then measure the
two-dimensional projected angular correlation function ω(θ) defined as the probability above
Poisson of finding two galaxies with an angular separation θ,
dP = N[+ ω(θ)]dΩ,
(8.5)
where N is the mean number of galaxies per steradian and dΩ is the solid angle of a second
galaxy at a separation θ from a randomly chosen galaxy.
Measurements of ω(θ) are known to be low by an additive factor known as the “inte-
gral constraint,” which results from using the data sample itself (which often does not cover
large areas of the sky) to estimate the mean galaxy density. This correction becomes impor-
tant on angular scales comparable to the survey size; on much smaller scales, it is negligible.
One can either restrict measurementsof the angular clustering to scales where the integral con-
straint is not important or estimate the amplitude of the integral constraint correction by doubly
integrating an assumed power-law form of ω(θ) over the survey area, Ω, using
AC = 
Ω ∫∫ω(θ)dΩdΩ,
(8.6)
where Ω is the area subtended by the survey. In practice, this can be numerically estimated over
the survey geometry using the random catalog itself (see Roche and Eales 1999 for details).
The projected angular two-point correlation function, ω(θ), can generally be fit with a
power law,
ω(θ) = Aωθδ,
(8.7)
where A is the clustering amplitude at a given scale (often 1′) and δ is the slope of the correlation
function.
From measurements of ω(θ), one can infer the three-dimensional spatial two-point cor-
relation function, ξ(r), if the redshift distribution of the sources is well known. The two-point
correlation function, ξ(r), is usually fit as a power law, ξ(r) = (r/r)−γ, where ris the char-
acteristic scale length of the galaxy clustering defined as the scale at which ξ = . As the
two-dimensional galaxy clustering seen in the plane of the sky is a projection of the three-
dimensional clustering, ω(θ) is directlyrelated toits three-dimensional analog ξ(r). Fora given
ξ(r), one can predict the amplitude and slope of ω(θ) using Limber’s equation, effectively inte-
grating ξ(r) along the redshift direction (e.g., Peebles 1980). If one assumes ξ(r) (and thus
ω(θ)) to be a power law over the redshift range of interest, such that

Here, F(r) is the curvature factor in the Robertson-Walker metric,
ds= cdt−a[dr/F(r)+ rdθ+ rsinθdϕ].
(8.12)
If the redshift distribution of sources, dN/dz, is well known, then the amplitude of ω(θ) can
be predicted for a given power-law model of ξ(r), such that measurementsof ω(θ) can be used
to place constraints on the evolution of ξ(r).
Interpreting angular clustering results can be difficult, however, as there is a degeneracy
between the inherent clustering amplitude and the redshift distribution of the sources in the
sample. For example, an observed weakly clustered signal projected on the plane of the sky
could be due either to the galaxy population being intrinsically weakly clustered and projected
over a relatively short distance along the line of sight, or it could result from an inherently
strongly clustered distribution integrated over a long distance, which would wash out the signal.
The uncertainty on the redshift distribution is therefore often the dominant error in analyses
using angular clustering measurements. The assumed galaxy redshift distribution (dN/dz) has
varied widely in different studies, such that similar observed angular clustering results have
led to widely different conclusions. A further complication is that each sample usually spans
a large range of redshifts and is magnitude limited, such that the mean intrinsic luminosity of
the galaxies is changing with redshift within a sample, which can hinder interpretation of the
evolution of clustering measured in ω(θ) studies.
Many of the first measurements of large-scale structure were studies of angular clustering.
One of the earliest determinations was the pioneering work of Peebles (1975) using photo-
graphic plates from the Lick survey (>Fig. 8-1). They found ω(θ) to be well fit by a power law
with a slope of δ = −.. Later studies using CCDs were able to reach deeper magnitude limits
and found that fainter galaxies had a lower clustering amplitude. One such study was conducted
by Postman et al. (1998), who surveyed a contiguous 4○× 4○field to a depth of IAB = mag,
reaching to z ∼. Later surveys that covered multiple fields on the sky found similar results. The
lower clustering amplitude observed for galaxies with fainter apparent magnitudes can in prin-
ciple be due either to clustering being a function of luminosity and/or a function of redshift. To
disentangle this dependence, each author assumes a dN/dz distribution for galaxies as a func-
tion of apparent magnitude and then fits the observed ω(θ) with different models of the redshift
dependence of clustering. While many authors measure similar values of the dependence of
ω(θ) on apparent magnitude, due to differences in the assumed dN/dz distributions, different
conclusions are reached regarding the amount of luminosity and redshift dependence to galaxy
clustering. Additionally, quoted error bars on the inferred values of rgenerally include only
Poisson and/or cosmic variance error estimates, while the dominant error is often the lack of
knowledge of dN/dz for the particular sample in question.
Because of the sensitivity of the inferred value of ron the redshift distribution of sources,
it is preferable to measure the three-dimensional correlation function. While it is much easier
to interpret three-dimensional clustering measurements, in cases where it is still not feasible to
obtain redshifts for a large fraction of galaxies in the sample, angular clustering measurements
are still employed. This is currently the case in particular with high redshift and/or very dusty,
optically obscured galaxy samples, such as submillimeter galaxies (e.g., Brodwin et al. 2008;
Maddox et al. 2010). However, without knowledge of the redshift distribution of the sources,
these measurements are hard to interpret.

Real and Redshift Space Clustering
Measurementsof the two-point correlation function use the redshift of a galaxy, not its distance,
to infer its location along the line of sight. This introduces two complications: one is that a cos-
mological model has to be assumed to convert measured redshifts to inferred distances, and
the other is that peculiar velocities introduce redshift space distortions in ξ parallel to the line
of sight of Sargent and Turner (1977). On the first point, errors on the assumed cosmology are
generally subdominant, so that in theory one could assume different cosmological parameters
and check which results are consistent with the assumed values, which is generally not neces-
sary. On the second point, redshift space distortions can be measured to constrain cosmological
parameters, and theycan alsobe integrated overtorecoverthe underlying real-space correlation
function.
On small spatial scales (≲1 h−Mpc), within collapsed virialized overdensities such as
groups and clusters, galaxies have large random motions relative to each other. Therefore, while
all of the galaxies in the group or cluster have a similar physical distance from the observer,
they have somewhat different redshifts. This causes an elongation in redshift space maps along
the line of sight within overdense regions, which is referred to as “Fingers of God.” The result
is that groups and clusters appear to be radially extended along the line of sight toward the
observer. This effect can be seen clearly in >Fig. 8-4, where the lower left panel, shows galax-
ies in redshift space with large “Fingers of God” pointing back to the observer, while in the
lower right panel the “Fingers of God” have been modeled and removed. Redshift space dis-
tortions are also seen on larger scales (≳1 h−Mpc) due to streaming motions of galaxies that
are infalling onto structures that are still collapsing. Adjacent galaxies will all be moving in the
same direction, which leads to coherent motion and causes an apparent contraction of struc-
ture along the line of sight in redshift space (Kaiser 1987), in the opposite sense as the “Fingers
of God.”
Redshift space distortions can be clearly seen in measurements of galaxy clustering. While
redshift space distortions can be used to uncover information about the underlying matter den-
sity and thermal motions of the galaxies (discussed below), they complicate a measurement of
the two-point correlation function in real space. Instead of ξ(r), what is measured is ξ(s), where
s is the redshift space separation between a pair of galaxies. While some results in the literature
present measurements of ξ(s) for various galaxy populations, it is not straightforward to com-
pare results for different galaxy samples and different redshifts as the amplitude of redshift space
distortions differs depending on the galaxy type and redshift. Additionally, ξ(s) does not follow
a power law over the same scales as ξ(r), as redshift space distortions on both small and large
scales decrease the amplitude of clustering relative to intermediate scales.
The real-space correlation function, ξ(r), measures the underlying physical clustering of
galaxies independent of any peculiar velocities. Therefore, in order to recover the real-space
correlation function, one can measure ξ in two dimensions, both perpendicular to and along
the line of sight. Following Fisher et al. (1994), vand vare defined to be the redshift positions
of a pair of galaxies, s to be the redshift space separation (v−v) and l = 
(v+ v) to be the
mean distance to the pair. The separation between the two galaxies across (rp) and along (π)
the line of sight are defined as

here through the declination direction) in two-dimensional comoving space. The top row shows
all galaxies in this slice (67,626 galaxies in total), while the bottom row shows galaxies that have
been identiﬁed as having “Fingers of God.”The rightcolumn shows the position of these galaxies in

at (x,y=0,0), and the “Fingers of God” eﬀect can be seen in the lower left panel as the positions of
galaxies being radially smeared along the line of sight toward the observer
One can then compute pair counts over a two-dimensional grid of separations to estimate
ξ(rp, π). ξ(s), the one-dimensional redshift space correlation function, is then equivalent to
the azimuthal average of ξ(rp, π).
An example of a measurement of ξ(rp, π) is shown in >Fig. 8-5. Plotted is ξ as a function
of separation rp (defined in this figure to be σ) across and π along the line of sight. What is
usually shown is the upper right quadrant of this figure, which here has been reflected about
both axes to emphasize the distortions. Contours of constant ξ follow the color coding, where
yellow corresponds to large ξ values and green to low values. On small scales across the line of
sight (rp or σ <∼h−Mpc) the contours are clearly elongated in the π direction; this reflects
the “Fingers of God” from galaxies in virialized overdensities. On large scales across the line
of sight (rP or σ >∼h−Mpc) the contours are flattened along the line of sight, due to “the
Kaiser effect.” This indicates that galaxies on these linear scales are coherently streaming onto
structures that are still collapsing.

The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe 8

As this effect is due to the gravitational infall of galaxies onto massive forming structures,
the strength of the signature depends on Ωmatter. Kaiser (1987) derived that the large-scale
anisotropy in the ξ(rp, π) plane depends on β ≡Ωmatter/b on linear scales, where b is the
bias or the ratio of density fluctuations in the galaxy population relative to that of dark matter
(discussed further in the next section below). Anisotropies are quantified using the multipole
moments of ξ(rp, π) defined as
ξl(s) = (l + )/∫ξ(rp, π) Pl(cos θ) d cos θ,
(8.15)
where s is the distance as measured in redshift space, Pl are Legendre polynomials, and θ is the
angle between s and the line of sight. The ratio ξ/ξ, the quadrupole-to-monopole moments
of the two-point correlation function, is related to β in a simple manner using linear theory

What is often desired, however, is a measurementof the real-space clustering of galaxies. To
recover ξ(r), one can then project ξ(rp, π) along the rp axis. As redshift space distortions affect
only the line-of-sight component of ξ(rp, π), integrating over the π direction leads to a statistic
wp(rp), which is independentof redshift space distortions. Following Davis and Peebles (1983),

for the real-space correlation function, ξ(r). In practice, ( > 8.17) is not integrated to infinite
separations. Often, values of πmax are ∼40–80 h−Mpc, which includes most correlated pairs. It
is worth noting that the values of rand γ inferred are covariant. One must therefore be careful
when comparing clustering amplitudes of different galaxy populations; simply comparing the
rvalues may be misleading if the correlation function slopes are different. It is often preferred
to compare the galaxy bias instead (see next section).
As a final note on measuring the two-point correlation function, as can be seen
from >Fig. 8-3, flux-limited galaxy samples contain a higher density of galaxies at lower red-
shift. This is purely an observational artifact due to the apparent magnitude limit including
intrinsically lower luminosity galaxies nearby, while only tracing the higher luminosity galax-
ies further away. As discussed below in >Sect. 6, because the clustering amplitude of galaxies
depends on their properties, including luminosity, one would ideally only measure ξ(r) in
volume-limited samples where galaxies of the same absolute magnitude are observed through-
out the entire volume of the sample, including at the highest redshifts. Therefore, often the full
observed galaxy population is not used in measurements of ξ(r), rather volume-limited sub-
samples are created where all galaxies are brighter than a given absolute magnitude limit. This
greatly facilitates the theoretical interpretation of clustering measurements (see >Sect. 8) and
the comparison of results from different surveys.

Galaxy Bias
It was realized decades ago that the spatial clustering of observable galaxies need not precisely
mirror the clustering of the bulk of the matter in the Universe. In its most general form, the
galaxy density can be a nonlocal and stochastic function of the underlying dark matter density.
This galaxy “bias” – the relationship between the spatial distribution of galaxies and the under-
lying dark matter density field – is a result of the varied physics of galaxy formation which

The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe 8
399
can cause the spatial distribution of baryons to differ from that of dark matter. Stochasticity
appears to have little effect on bias except for adding extra variance (e.g., Scoccimarro 2000),
and nonlocality can be taken into account to first order by using smoothed densities over larger
scales. In this approximation, the smoothed galaxy density contrast is a general function of the
underlying dark matter density contrast on some scale,
δg = f (δ),
(8.19)
where δ ≡(ρ/¯ρ) −and ¯ρ is the mean mass density on that scale. If we assume f (δ) is a linear
function of δ, then we can define the linear galaxies bias b as the ratio of the mean overdensity
of galaxies to the mean overdensity of mass,
b = δg/δ,
(8.20)
and can in theory depend on scale and galaxy properties such as luminosity, morphology, color,
and redshift. In terms of the correlation function, the linear bias is defined as the square root of
the ratio of the two-point correlation function of the galaxies relative to the dark matter
b = (ξgal/ξdark matter)/
(8.21)
and is a function of scale. Note that ξdark matter is the Fourier transform of the dark matterpower
spectrum. The bias of galaxies relative to dark matter is often referred to as the absolute bias as
opposed to the relative bias between galaxy populations (discussed below).
The concept of galaxies being a biased tracer of the underlying total mass field (which is
dominated by dark matter) was introduced by Kaiser (1984) in an attempt to reconcile the dif-
ferent clustering scale lengths of galaxies and rich clusters, which could not both be unbiased
tracers of mass. Kaiser (1984) shows that clusters of galaxies would naturally have a large bias as
a result of being rare objects which formed at the highest density peaks of the mass distribution
above some critical threshold. This idea is further developed analytically by Bardeen et al. (1986)
for galaxies, who show that for a Gaussian distribution of initial mass density fluctuations, the
peaks which first collapse to form galaxies will be more clustered than the underlying mass dis-
tribution. Mo and White (1996) use extended Press-Schechter theory to determine that the bias
depends on the mass of the dark matter halo as well as the epoch of galaxy formation and that a
linear bias is a decent approximation well into the nonlinear regime, where δ > . The evolution
of bias with redshift is developed in theoretical work by Fry (1996) and Tegmark and Peebles
(1998), who find that the bias is naturally larger at earlier epochs of galaxy formation, as the first
galaxies to form will collapse in the most overdense regions of space, which are biased (akin to
mountain peaks being clustered). They further show that regardless of the initial amplitude of
the bias factor, with time galaxies, will become unbiased tracers of the mass distribution (b →
as t →∞). Additionally, Mann et al. (1998) find that while bias is generally scale dependent,
the dependence is weak, and on large scales, the bias tends toward a constant value.
A galaxy population can be “anti-biased” if b < , indicating that galaxies are less clus-
tered than the dark matter distribution. As discussed below, this appears to be the case for
some galaxy samples at low redshift. The galaxy bias of a given observational sample is often
inferred by comparing the observed clustering of galaxies with the clustering of dark matter
measured in a cosmological simulation. Therefore, the bias depends on the cosmological model
used in the simulation. The dominant relevantcosmological parameter is σdefined as the stan-
dard deviation of galaxy count fluctuations in a sphere of radius 8 h−Mpc, and the absolute
bias value inferred can be simply scaled with the assumed value of σ. As discussed

400 8
The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
in >Sect. 9.1 below, the absolute galaxy bias can also be estimated from the data directly, with-
out having to resort to comparisons with cosmological simulations, by using the ratio of the
two-point and three-point correlation functions, which have different dependencies on the bias.
While this measurementcan be somewhat noisy, it has the advantage of not assuming a cosmo-
logical model from which to derive the dark matter clustering. This measurement is performed
by Verde et al. (2002) and Gaztañaga et al. (2005), who find that galaxies in 2dFGRS have a
linear bias value very close to unity on large scales.
The relative bias between different galaxy populations can also be measured and is defined
as the ratio of the clustering of one population relative to another. This is often measured using
the ratio of the projected correlation functions of each population,
bgal/gal= (wp,gal/wp,gal)/,
(8.22)
where both measurements of wp(rp) have been integrated to the same value of πmax. The rel-
ative bias is used to compare the clustering of galaxies as a function of observed parameters
and does not refer to the clustering of dark matter. It is a useful way to compare the observed
clustering for different galaxy populations without having to rely on an assumed value of σfor
the dark matter.

The Dependence of Clustering on Galaxy Properties
The two-point correlation function has long been known to depend on galaxy properties and
can vary as a function of galaxy luminosity, morphological or spectral type, color, stellar mass,
and redshift. The general trend is that galaxies that are more luminous, early-type, bulge-
dominated, optically red, and/or higher stellar mass are more clustered than galaxies that are
less luminous, late type, disk-dominated, optically blue, and/or lower stellar mass. Presented
below are relatively recent results indicating how clustering properties depend on galaxy prop-
erties from the largest redshifts surveys currently available. The physical interpretation behind
these trends is presented in >Sect. 8 below.
6.1 Luminosity Dependence
>Figure 8-3 shows the large-scale structure reflected in the galaxy distribution at low redshift.
What is plotted is the spatial distribution of galaxies in a flux-limited sample, meaning that all
galaxies down to a given apparent magnitude limit are included. This results in the apparent
lack of galaxies or structure at higher redshift in the figure as at large distances only the most
luminous galaxies will be included in a flux-limited sample. In order to robustly determine
the underlying clustering, one should, if possible, create volume-limited subsamples in which
galaxies of the same luminosity can be detected at all redshifts. In this way, the mean luminosity
of the sample does not change with redshift and galaxies at all redshifts are weighted equally.
The left panel of >Fig. 8-6 shows the projected correlation function, wp(rp), for galaxies
in SDSS in volume-limited subsamples corresponding to different absolute magnitude ranges.
The more luminous galaxies are more strongly clustered across a wide range in absolute optical
magnitude, from −< Mr < −. Power-law fits on scales from ∼0.1 to ∼10 h−Mpc show that
while the clustering amplitude depends sensitively on luminosity, the slope does not. Only in

value of γ ∼.. Across this magnitude, range rvaries from ∼2.8 h−Mpc at the faint end
to ∼10 h−Mpc at the bright end. This same general trend is found in the 2dFGRS and other
redshift surveys (e.g., Norberg et al. 2001).
The right panel of >Fig. 8-6 shows the relative bias of SDSS galaxies as a function of lumi-
nosity, relative to the clustering of L∗galaxies, measured at the scale of rp = .h−Mpc,
which is in the nonlinear regime, where δ > (Zehavi et al. 2005). L∗is the characteristic
galaxy luminosity defined as the luminosity of the break in the galaxy luminosity function.
The relative bias is seen to steadily increase at higher luminosity and rise sharply above L∗. This
is in good agreement with the results from Tegmark et al. (2004), using the power spectrum of
SDSSgalaxies measured in the linear regime on a scale of ∼100h−Mpc. The data also agree with
the clustering results of galaxies in the 2dFGRS from Norberg et al. (2001). The overall shape
of the relative bias with luminosity indicates a slow rise up to the value at L∗, above which the
rise is much steeper. As discussed in >Sect. 8.2 below, this trend shows that brighter galaxies
reside in more massive dark matter halos than fainter galaxies.
6.2 Color and Spectral-Type Dependence
The clustering strength of galaxies also depends on restframe color and spectral type, with a
stronger dependence than on luminosity. >Figure 8-7 shows the spatial distribution of galaxies
in SDSS, color coded as a function of restframe color. Red galaxies are seen to preferentially pop-
ulate the most overdense regions, while blue galaxies are more smoothly distributed in space.

galaxies are seen to be more clustered than blue galaxies and generally trace the centers of groups
and clusters, while blue galaxies populate further into the galaxy voids (Taken from Zehavi et al.
(2011))
This is reflected in the correlation function of galaxies split by restframe color. Red galaxies have
a larger correlation length and steeper slope than blue galaxies: r∼5–6 h−Mpc and γ ∼.for
red L∗galaxies, while r∼3–4 h−Mpc and γ ∼.for blue L∗galaxies in SDSS (Zehavi et al.
2005). Clustering studies from the 2dFGRS split the galaxy sample at low redshift by spectral
type into galaxies with emission line spectra versus absorption line spectra, corresponding to
star forming and quiescent galaxies, and find similar results: that quiescent galaxies have larger
correlation lengths and steeper clustering slopes than star-forming galaxies (Madgwick et al.
2003).
Red and blue galaxies have distinct luminosity-dependent clustering properties. As shown
in >Fig. 8-8, the general trends seen in rand γ with luminosity for all galaxies are well reflected
in the blue galaxy population; however, at faint luminosities (L ≲.L∗), red galaxies have larger
clustering amplitudes and slopes than L∗red galaxies. This reflects the fact that faint red galaxies
are often found distributed throughout galaxy clusters.
Galaxy clustering also depends on other galaxy properties such as stellar mass, concentra-
tion index, and the strength of the 4,000Å break (D,) in that galaxies that have larger stellar
mass, more centrally concentrated light profiles, and/or larger D,measurements (indicat-
ing older stellar populations) are more clustered (Li et al. 2006). This is not surprising given the
observed trends with luminosity and color and the known dependencies of other galaxy prop-
erties with luminosity and color. Clearly, the galaxy bias is a complicated function of various
galaxy properties.

function of luminosity. While all galaxies are more clustered at brighter luminosities and red galax-
ies are more clustered than blue galaxies at all luminosities, below L∗, the red galaxy clustering
length increases at fainter luminosities. The clustering slope for faint red galaxies is also much
steeper than at other luminosities (Taken from Zehavi et al. (2011))
6.3 Redshift Space Distortions
The fact that red galaxies are more clustered than blue galaxies is related to the morphology-
density relation (Dressler 1980), which results from the fact that galaxies with elliptical
morphologies are more likely to be found in regions of space with a higher local sur-
face density of galaxies. The redshift space distortions seen for red and blue galaxies also
show this.
As discussed in >Sect. 4, redshift space distortions arise from two different phenomena:
virialized motions of galaxies within collapsed overdensities such as groups and clusters and the
coherent streaming motion of galaxies onto larger structures that are still collapsing. The former
is seen on relatively small scales (rp ≲h−Mpc) while the latter is detected on larger scales
(rP ≳h−Mpc). While the presence of redshift space distortions complicates the measurement
of the real space ξ(r), these distortions can be used to uncover information about the thermal
motions of galaxies in groups and clusters as well as the amplitude of the mass density of the
Universe, Ωmatter.
> Figure 8-9 shows ξ(rp, π) for quiescent and star-forming galaxies in 2dF. The quiescent
galaxies on the left show larger “Fingers of God” than the star-forming galaxies on the right,
reflecting the fact that red, quiescent galaxies have larger motions relative to each others. This
naturally arises if red, quiescent galaxies reside in more massive, virialized overdensities with
larger random peculiar velocities than star-forming, optically blue galaxies. The large-scale
coherent infall of galaxies is seen both for blue and red galaxies, though it is often easier to
see for blue galaxies, due to their smaller “Fingers of God.”

coherent infall on large scales. Contours show lines of constant ξ at ξ =10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1 (Taken

These small-scale redshift space distortions can be quantified using the σstatistic known
as the pairwise velocity dispersion (Davis et al. 1978; Fisher et al. 1994). This is measured by
modeling ξ(rp, π) in real space, which is then convolved with a distribution of random pairwise

The Evolution of Galaxy Clustering
The observed clustering of galaxies is expected to evolve with time as structure continues to
grow due to gravity. The exact evolution depends on cosmological parameters such as Λ and
Ωmatter. Larger values of Λ, for example, lead to larger voids and higher density contrasts
between overdense and underdense regions. By measuring the clustering of galaxies at higher
redshift, one can break degeneracies that exist between the galaxy bias and cosmological param-
eters that are constrained by low redshift clustering measurements. It is therefore useful to
determine the clustering of galaxies as a function of cosmic epoch not only to further constrain
cosmological parameters but also galaxy evolution.
One might expect the galaxy clustering amplitude rto increase over time as overdense
regions become more overdense as galaxies move toward groups and clusters due to gravity.
However, the exact evolution ofthe clustering ofgalaxies depends not onlyon gravitybut alsoon
the expansion history of the Universe and therefore cosmological parameters such as Λ. Addi-
tionally, over time, new galaxies form while existing galaxies grow in both mass and luminosity.
Therefore, the expected changes of galaxy clustering as a function of redshift depend both on
relatively well-known cosmological parameters and more unknown galaxy formation and evo-
lution physics which likely depends on gas accretion, star formation, and feedback processes,
as well as mergers.
For a given cosmological model, one can predict how the clustering of dark matter should
evolve with time using cosmological N-body simulations. For a ΛCDM Universe, rfor dark
matter particles is expected to increase from ∼0.8 h−Mpc at z = to ∼5 h−Mpc at z = 
(Weinberg et al. 2004). However, according to hierarchical structure formation theories, at high
redshifts, the first galaxies to form will be the first structures to collapse, which will be biased
tracers of the mass. The galaxy bias is expected to be a strong function of redshift, initially >1 at
high redshift and approaching unity over time. Therefore, rfor galaxies may be a much weaker
function of time than it is for dark matter as the same galaxies are not observed as a function
of redshift, and over time, new galaxies form in less biased locations in the Universe.
The projected angular and three-dimensional correlation functions of galaxies have been
observed to z ∼. Star-forming Lyman break galaxies at z ∼3–5 are found to have r∼4–6 h−
Mpc, with a bias relative to dark matter of ∼3–4 (Adelberger et al. 2005; Ouchi et al. 2004).
Brighter Lyman break galaxies are found to cluster more strongly than fainter Lyman break
galaxies. The correlation length, r, is found to be roughly constant between z = and z = ,
implying that the bias is increasing at earlier cosmic epoch. Spectroscopic galaxy surveys at
z > are currently limited to samples of at most a few thousand galaxies, so most clustering
measurementsare angular at these epochs. In one such study by Wake et al. (2011), photometric
redshifts of tens of thousands of galaxies at < z < are used to measure the angular clustering
as a function of stellar mass. They find a strong dependence of clustering amplitude on stellar
mass in each of three redshift intervals in this range.
At z ∼, largerspectroscopicgalaxysamples exist, and three-dimensional two-point cluster-
ing analyses have been performed as a function of luminosity, color, stellar mass, and spectral
type. The same general clustering trends with galaxy property that are observed at z ∼are
also seen at z ∼, in that galaxies that are brighter, redder, early spectral type, and/or more
massive are more clustered. The clustering scale length of red galaxies is found to be ∼5–6 h−
Mpc, while for blue galaxies, it is ∼3.5–4.5 h−Mpc, depending on luminosity (Coil et al. 2008;
Meneux et al. 2006). At a given luminosity, the observed correlation length is only ∼15% smaller
at z = than z = , indicating that unlike for dark matter, the galaxy ris roughly constant over
time. These results are consistent with predictions from ΛCDM simulations.

406 8
The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
The measured values of rat z ∼imply that galaxies are more biased at z = than at
z = . Within the DEEP2 sample, the bias measured on scales of ∼1–10 h−Mpc varies from
∼1.25–1.55, with brighter galaxy samples being more biased tracers of the dark matter (Coil
et al. 2006). These results are consistent with the idea that galaxies formed early on in the most
overdense regions of space, which are biased.
As in the nearby Universe, the clustering amplitude is a stronger function of color than of
luminosity at z ∼. Additionally, the color-density relation is found to already be in place at
z = , in that the relative bias of red to blue galaxies is as high at z = as at z = .(Coil et al.
2008). This implies that the color-density relation is not due to cluster-specific physics, as most
galaxies at z = in field spectroscopic surveys are not in clusters. Therefore, it must be physical
processes at play in galaxy groups that initially set the color and morphology-density relations.
Red galaxies show larger“Fingers ofGod” in ξ(rp, π) measurements than blue galaxies do, again
showing that red galaxies at z = lie preferentially in virialized, more massive overdensities
compared to blue galaxies. Both red and blue galaxies show coherent infall on large scales.

Halo Model Interpretation of ξ(r)
The current paradigm of galaxy formation posits that galaxies form in the center of larger dark
matter halos, collapsed overdensities in the dark matter distribution with ρ/¯ρ ∼, inside of
which all mass is gravitationally bound. The clustering of galaxies can then be understood as a
combination of the clustering of dark matterhalos, which depends on cosmological parameters,
and how galaxies populate dark matter halos, which depends on galaxy formation and evolu-
tion physics. For a given cosmological model, the properties of dark matter halos, including
their evolution with time, can be studied in detail using N-body simulations. The masses and
spatial distribution of dark matter halos should depend only on the properties of dark matter,
not baryonic matter, and the expansion history of the Universe; therefore, the clustering of dark
matter halos should be insensitive to baryon physics. However, the efficiency of galaxy forma-
tion is very dependent on the complicated baryonic physics of, for example, star formation,
gas cooling, and feedback processes. The halo model allows the relatively simple cosmological
dependence of galaxy clustering to be cleanly separated from the more complex baryonic astro-
physics, and it shows how clustering measurements for a range of galaxy types can be used to
constrain galaxy evolution physics.
8.1 Estimating the Mean Halo Mass from the Bias
One can use the observed large-scale clustering amplitude of different observed galaxy pop-
ulations to identify the typical mass of their parent dark matter halos in order to place these
galaxies in a cosmological context (see
>Chap. 10). The large-scale clustering amplitude of
dark matter halos as a function of halo mass is well determined in N-body simulations, and
analytic fitting formula are provided by, for example, Mo and White (1996) and Sheth et al.
(2001). Analytic models can then predict the clustering of both dark matter particles and galax-
ies as a function of scale by using the clustering of dark matter halos and the radial density
profile of dark matter and galaxies within those halos (Ma and Fry 2000; Peacock and Smith
2000; Seljak 2000). In this scheme, on large, linear scales where δ < (ρ/¯ρ ∼), the clustering

The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe 8
407
of a given galaxy population can be used to determine the mean mass of the dark matter halos
hosting those galaxies for a given cosmological model. To achieve this, the large-scale bias is
estimated by comparing the observed galaxy clustering amplitude with that of dark matter in
an N-body simulation, and then galaxies are assumed to reside in halos of a given mass that
have the same bias in simulations.
Simulations show that higher mass halos cluster more strongly than lower mass halos (Sheth
and Tormen 1999). This then leads toan interpretation ofgalaxyclustering as a function oflumi-
nosity in which luminous galaxies reside in more massive dark matter halos than less luminous
galaxies. Similarly, red galaxies typically reside in more massive halos than blue galaxies of the
same luminosity; this is observationally verified by the larger “Fingers of God” observed for
red galaxies. Combining the large-scale bias with the observed galaxy number density further
allows one to constrain the fraction of halos that host a given galaxy type by comparing the
galaxy space density to the parent dark matter halo space density. This constrains the duty cycle
or fraction of halos hosting galaxies of a given population.
8.2 Halo Occupation Distribution Modeling
While such estimates of the mean host halo mass and duty cycle are fairly straightforward to
carry out, a greater understanding of the relation between galaxy light and dark matter mass is
gleaned by performing halo occupation distribution modeling.
The general halo-based model discussed above, in which the clustering of galaxies reflects
the clustering of halos, was further developed by Peacock and Smith (2000) to include the effi-
ciency of galaxy formation, or how galaxies populate halos. The proposed model depends on
both the halo occupation number, equal to the number of galaxies in a halo of a given mass, for
a galaxy sample brighter than some limit, and the location of the galaxies within these halos. In
the Peacock and Smith (2000) model, it is assumed that one galaxy is at the center of the halo
(the “central” galaxy), and the rest of the galaxies in the same halo are “satellite” galaxies that
trace the dark matter radial mass distribution, which follows an NFW profile (Navarro et al.
1997). The latter assumption results in a general power-law shape for the galaxy correlation
function.
A similar idea was proposed by Benson et al. (2000), who used a semi-analytic model in con-
junction with a cosmological N-body simulation to show that the observed galaxy ξ(r) could be
reproduced with a ΛCDM simulation (though not with a τ CDM simulation with Ωmatter = ).
They also employ a method for locating galaxies inside dark matter halos such that one galaxy
resides at the center of all halos above a given mass threshold, while additional galaxies are
assigned the location of a random dark matter particle within the same halo, such that galaxies
have the same NFW radial profile within halos as the dark matter particles (see >Fig. 8-10, left
panel).
In these models, the clustering of galaxies on scales larger than a typical halo (∼1–2h−Mpc)
results from pairs of galaxies in separate halos called the “two-halo term,” while the clustering
on smaller scales (≲1 h−Mpc) is due to pairs of galaxies within the same parent halo called the
“one-halo term.” When the pairs from these two terms are added together, the resulting galaxy
correlation function should roughly follow a power law.
Benson et al. (2000) show that on large scales, there is a simple relation in the bias between
galaxies and dark matter halos, while on small scales, the correlation function depends on the
number of galaxies in a halo and the finite size of halos. When the clustering signal from these

which assumes that dark matter halos above a given mass threshold have at least one “central”
galaxy located at the center of the halo. Higher mass halos contain additional “satellite” galaxies,
which are assigned the location of a random dark matter particle in the halo (Taken from Benson
et al. (2000)). Right: The two-point correlation function of dark matter particles (dotted line) and

1996)
two scales (corresponding to the “two-halo” and “one-halo” terms) is combined, a power law
results for the galaxy ξ(r) (right panel, >Fig. 8-10). Galaxies are found to be anti-biased relative
to dark matter (i.e., less clustered than the dark matter) on scales smaller than the typical halo,
though the bias is close to unity on larger scales. The clustering of galaxies that results from
this semi-analytic model is also found to match the observed clustering of galaxies in the APM
survey above a given luminosity threshold (Baugh 1996).
By defining the halo occupation distribution (HOD) as the probability that a halo of a given
mass contains N galaxies, P(N∣M), Berlind and Weinberg (2002) quantify how the observed
galaxy ξ(r) depends on different HOD model parameters. Using N-body simulations, they
identify dark matter halos and place galaxies into the simulation using a simple HOD model
with two parameters: a minimum mass at which a halo hosts, on average, one central galaxy
(Mmin) at the center of the halo, and the slope (α) of the P(N∣M) function for satellite galaxies.
The latter determines how many satellite galaxies there are as a function of halo mass. They fur-
ther assume that the satellite galaxies follow an NFW profile, as the dark matter does, though the
concentration of the radial profile can be changed. They show that the “two-halo term” is simply
the halo center correlation function weighted by a large-scale bias factor, while the “one-halo
term” is sensitive to both α and the concentration of the galaxy profile within halos. Obtaining
a power law ξ(r) therefore strongly constrains the HOD model parameters.

The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe 8
409
Kravtsov et al. (2004) propose that the locations of satellitegalaxies within dark matterhalos
should correspond to locations of subhalos, distinct gravitationally bound regions within the
larger dark matter halos, instead of tracing random dark matter particles. Using cosmological
N-body simulations, they show that at z > ξ(r) for galaxies should deviate strongly from a
power law on small scales, due to a rise in the “one-halo term.” In this model, the clustering
of galaxies can be understood as the clustering of dark matter parent halos and subhalos, and
the power-law shape that is observed at z ∼is a coincidence of the one- and two-halo terms
having similar amplitudes and slopes at the typical scale of halos. They find that the formation
and evolution of halos and subhalos through merging and dynamical processes are the main
physical drivers of large-scale structure.
With the unprecedentedly large galaxy sample with spectroscopic redshifts that is provided
bySDSS, departures from a powerlaw ξ(r) were detected byZehavi et al. (2004)using a volume-
limited subsample of 22,000 galaxies from a parent sample of 118,000 galaxies. The deviations
from a power law are small enough at z ∼that a large sample covering a sufficiently large
cosmological volume is required to overcome the errors due to cosmic variance to detect these
small deviations. It is found that there is a change in the slope of ξ(r) on scales of ∼1–2 h−Mpc;
this corresponds to the scale at which the one- and two-halo term are equal (see >Fig. 8-11).
Zehavi et al. (2004) find that ξ(r) measured from the SDSS data is better fit by an HOD model,
which includes small deviations from a power law, than by a pure power law. The HOD model
that is fit has three parameters: the minimum mass to host a single central galaxy (Mmin), the
minimum mass to host a single satellite galaxy (M), and the slope of P(N∣M) (α), which

model, dark matter halos with Mmin < M < Mhost a single galaxy, while above M, they host,
on average, (M/M)α galaxies. Using wp(rp), one can fit for Mand α, while the observed

8.3 Interpreting the Luminosity and Color Dependence of Galaxy
Clustering
In general, these HOD parameters reflect the efficiency of galaxy formation and evolution and
can be a function of galaxy properties such as luminosity, color, stellar mass, and morphology.
Zehavi et al. (2011) present HOD fits to SDSS samples as a function of luminosity and color
and find that α is generally ∼1.0–1.1, though it is a bit higher for the brightest galaxies
(∼1.3 for Mr < −22.0). There is a strong trend between luminosity and halo mass; Mmin varies
as a function of luminosity from ∼10h−M⊙for Mr < −18 to ∼10h−M⊙for Mr < −22.
Mis generally ∼17 times higher than the value of Mmin for all luminosity threshold samples
(see >Fig. 8-12). This implies that a halo with two galaxies above a given luminosity is ∼17 times
more massive than a halo hosting one galaxy above the same luminosity limit. Further, the frac-
tion of galaxies that are satellitesdecreases at higherluminosities, from ∼33% at Mr < −18 to 4%
at Mr < −22. The right panel of >Fig. 8-12 shows the mass-to-light ratio of the virial halo mass

The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe 8

In terms of the color dependenceof galaxy clustering, the trend at fainter luminosities of red
galaxies being strongly clustered(with a highercorrelation slope, γ, see >Fig. 8-8) is due to faint
red galaxies being satellite galaxies in relatively massive halos that host bright red central galax-
ies (Berlind et al. 2005). HOD modeling therefore provides a clear explanation for the increased
clustering observed for faint red galaxies. For a given luminosity range (−< Mr < −),
Zehavi et al. (2011) fit a simplified HOD model with one parameter only to find that the fraction
of galaxies that are satellites is much higher for red than for blue galaxies, with ∼25% of blue
galaxies being satellites and ∼60% of red galaxies being satellites. They find that blue galaxies
reside in halos with a median mass of .h−M⊙, while red galaxies reside in higher mass
halos with a median mass of .h−M⊙. However, at a given luminosity, there is not a strong
trend between color and halo mass (though there is a strong trend between luminosity and halo
mass). Instead, the differences in wp(rp) reflect a trend between color and satellite fraction; the
increased satellite fraction, in particular, drives the slope of ξ(r) to be steeper for red galaxies
compared to blue galaxies. And while the HOD slope α does not change much with increasing
luminosity, it does with color, due to the dependence of the satellite fraction on color. Hav-
ing a higher satellite fraction also places more galaxies in high mass halos (as those host the
groups and clusters that contain the satellite galaxies), which increases the large-scale bias and
boosts the one-halo term relative to the two-halo term. The HOD model facilitates interpre-
tion of the observed luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering and provides strong,
crucial constraints on models of how galaxies form and evolve within their parent dark matter
halos.
8.4 Interpreting the Evolution of Galaxy Clustering
As mentioned in >Sect. 7 above, the galaxies that are observed for clustering measurements
at different redshifts are not necessarily the same populations across cosmic time. A significant
hurdle in understanding galaxy evolution is knowing how to connect different observed popu-
lations at different redshifts. Galaxy clustering measurementscan be combined with theoretical
modelsto trace observed populations with redshift in that for a given cosmology, one can model
how the clustering of a given population should evolve with time.
The observed evolution of the luminosity dependenceof galaxy clustering can be fit surpris-
ingly well using a simple nonparametric, non-HOD, model that relates the galaxy luminosity
function to the halo mass function. Conroy et al. (2006) show that directly matching galaxies
as a function of luminosity to host halos and subhalos as a function of mass leads to a model
for the luminosity-dependent clustering that matches observation from z ∼to z ∼. In this
model, the only inputs are the observed galaxy luminosity function at each epoch of interest
and the dark matter halo (and subhalo) mass function from N-body simulations. Galaxies are
then ranked by luminosity and halos by mass and matched one to one, such that lower lumi-
nosity galaxies are associated with halos of lower mass, and galaxies above a given luminosity
threshold are assigned to halos above a given mass threshold with the same abundance or num-
ber density. This “abundance-matching” method uses as a proxy for halo mass the maximum
circular velocity (Vmax) of the halo; for subhalos, they find that it is necessary to use the value
of Vmax when the subhalo is first accreted into a larger halo to avoid the effects of tidal strip-
ping. With this simple model, the clustering amplitude and shape as a function of luminosity
are matched for SDSS galaxies at z ∼, DEEP2 galaxies at z ∼, and Lyman break galaxies
at z ∼. In particular, the clustering amplitude in both the one- and two-halo regimes is well

The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
fit, including the deviations from a power law that seen at z > (Coil et al. 2006; Ouchi et al.
2005). These results imply a tight correlation between galaxy luminosity and halo mass from
z ∼to z ∼.
While abundance-matching techniques provide a simple, zero parameter model for how
galaxies populate halos, a richer understanding of the physical properties involved may be
gained by performing HOD modeling. Zheng et al. (2007) use HOD modeling to fit the
observed luminosity-dependent galaxy clustering at z ∼measured in SDSS with that mea-
sured at z ∼, in DEEP2 to confirm that at both epochs there is a tight relationship between
the central galaxy luminosity and host halo mass. At z ∼the satellite fraction drops for higher
luminosities, as at z ∼, but at a given luminosity, the satellite fraction is higher at z ∼than
at z ∼. They also find that at a given central luminosity, halos are ∼1.6 times more massive
at z ∼than z ∼, and at a given halo, mass galaxies are ∼1.4 times more luminous at z ∼
than z ∼.
Zheng et al. (2007) further combine these HOD results with theoretical predictions of the
growth of dark matter halos from simulations to link z ∼central galaxies to their descendants
at z ∼and find that the growth of both halo mass and stellar mass as a function of redshift
depends on halo mass. Lower mass halos grow earlier, which is reflected in the fact that more
of their z ∼mass is already assembled by z ∼. A typical z ∼halo with mass × h−M⊙
has about 70% of its final mass in place by z ∼, while a z ∼halo with mass h−M⊙has
∼50% of its final mass in place at z ∼. In terms of stellar mass, however, in a z ∼halo of mass
× h−M⊙, a central galaxy has ∼20% of its stellar mass in place at z ∼, while the fraction
rises to ∼33% above a halo mass of × h−M⊙. They further find that the mass scale of the
maximum star formation efficiency for central galaxies shifts to lower halo mass with time, with
a peak of ∼h−M⊙at z ∼and ∼× h−M⊙at z ∼.
At < z < , Wake et al. (2011) use precise photometric redshifts from the NEWFIRM
survey to measure the relationship between stellar mass and dark matter halo mass using HOD
models. At these higher redshifts, rvaries from ∼6 to ∼11 h−Mpc for stellar masses ∼
to M⊙. The galaxy bias is a function of both redshift and stellar mass and is ∼2.5 at z ∼
and increases to ∼3.5 at z ∼. They find that the typical halo mass of both central and satel-
lite galaxies increases with stellar mass, while the satellite fraction drops at higher stellar mass,
qualitatively similar to what is found at lower redshift. They do not find evolution in the rela-
tionship between stellar mass and halo mass between z ∼and z ∼but do find evolution
compared to z ∼. They also find that the peak of star formation efficiency shifts to lower halo
mass with time.
Simulations can also be used to connect different observed galaxy populations at different
redshifts. An example of the power of this method is shown by Conroy et al. (2008), who com-
pare the clustering and space density of star-forming galaxies at z ∼with that of star-forming
and quiescent galaxies at z = and z = to infer both the typical descendants of the z ∼
star-forming galaxies and constrain the fraction that have merged with other galaxies by z = .
They use halos and subhalos identified in a ΛCDM N-body simulation to determine which
halos at z ∼likely host star-forming galaxies, and then use the merger histories in the sim-
ulation to track these same halos to lower redshift. By comparing these results to observed
clustering of star-forming galaxies at z ∼and z ∼, they can identify the galaxy populations
at these epochs that are consistent with being descendants of the z ∼galaxies. They find that
while the lower redshift descendent halos have clustering strengths similar to red galaxies at
both z ∼and z ∼, the z ∼star forming galaxies cannot all evolve into red galaxies by lower
redshift as their space density is too high. There are many more lower redshift descendents

than there are red galaxies, even after taking into account mergers. They conclude that most
z ∼star-forming galaxies evolve into typical L∗galaxies today, while a non-negligible fraction
become satellite galaxies in larger galaxy groups and clusters.
In summary, N-body simulations and HOD modeling can be used to interpret the observed
evolution of galaxy clustering and further constrain both cosmological parameters and theo-
retical models of galaxy evolution beyond what can be gleaned from z ∼observations alone.
They also establish links between distinct observed galaxy populations at different redshifts,
allowing one to create a coherent picture of how galaxies evolve over cosmic time.

Voids and Filaments
Redshift surveys unveil a rich structure ofgalaxies as seen in >Fig. 8-3. In addition tomeasuring
the two-point correlation function to quantify the clustering amplitude as a function of galaxy
properties, one can also study higher-order clustering measurements as well as properties of
voids and filaments.
9.1 Higher-Order Clustering Measurements
Higher-order clustering statistics reflect both the growth of initial density fluctuations as well as
the details of galaxy biasing (Bernardeau et al. 2002), such that measurements of higher-order
clustering can test the paradigm of structure formation through gravitational instability as well
as constrain the galaxy bias. In the linear regime, there is a degeneracy between the amplitude
of fluctuations in the dark matter density field and the galaxy bias in that a highly clustered
galaxy population may be biased and trace only the most overdense regions of the dark matter
or the dark matter itself may be highly clustered. However, this degeneracy can be broken in
the nonlinear regime on small scales. Over time, the density field becomes skewed toward high
density as δ becomes greater than unity in overdense regions (where δ ≡(ρ/¯ρ) −) but cannot
become negative in underdense regions. Skewness in the galaxy density distribution can also
arise from galaxy bias, if galaxies preferentially form in the highest density peaks. One can
therefore use the shapes of the galaxy overdensities through measurements of the three-point
correlation function to test gravitational collapse versus galaxy bias.
To study higher-order clustering, one needs large samples that cover enormous volumes;
all studies to date have focused on low redshift galaxies. Verde et al. (2002) use 2dFGRS to
measure the Fourier transform of the three-point correlation function, called the bispectrum, to
constrain the galaxy bias without resorting to comparisons with N-body simulations in order to
measure the clustering ofdark matter. Fryand Gaztanaga (1993)present the galaxybias in terms
of a Taylor expansion of the density contrast, where the first-order term is the linear term, while
the second-order term is the nonlinear or quadratic term. Measured on scales of 5–30 h−Mpc,
Verde et al. (2002) find that the linear galaxy bias is consistent with unity (b= .± .), while
the nonlinear quadratic bias is consistent with zero (b= −.± .). When combined with
the redshift space distortions measured in the two-dimensional two-point correlation function
(ξ(rp, π)), they measure Ωmatter = .± .at z = .. This constraint on the matter density
of the Universe is derived entirely from large-scale structure data alone.

414 8
The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
Gaztañaga et al. (2005) measure the three-point correlation function in 2dFGRS for tri-
angles of galaxy configurations with different shapes. Their results are consistent with ΛCDM
expectations regarding gravitational instability of initial Gaussian fluctuations. Furthermore,
they find that while the linear bias is consistent with unity (b= .+./−.), the quadratic
bias is nonzero (b/b= −.+./−.). This implies that there is a nongravitational contri-
bution to the three-point function, resulting from galaxy formation physics. These results differ
from those of Verde et al. (2002), which may be due to the inclusion by Gaztañaga et al. (2005)
of the covariance between measurements on different scales. Gaztañaga et al. (2005) combine
their results with the measured two-point correlation function to derive σ= .+./−..
If the density field follows a Gaussian distribution, the higher-order clustering terms can be
expressed solely in terms of the lower-order clustering terms. This “hierarchical scaling” holds
for the evolution of an initially Gaussian distribution of fluctuations under gravitational insta-
bility. Therefore, departures from hierarchical scaling can result either from a non-Gaussian
initial density field or from galaxy bias. Redshift space higher-order clustering measurements
in 2dFGRS are performed by Baugh et al. (2004) and Croton et al. (2004a), who measure up
to the six-point correlation function. They find that hierarchical scaling is obeyed on small
scales, though deviations exist on larger scales (∼10 h−Mpc). They show that on large scales,
the higher-order terms can be significantly affected by massive rare peaks such as superclus-
ters, which populate the tail of the overdensity distribution. Croton et al. (2004a) also show that
the three-point function has a weak luminosity dependence, implying that galaxy bias is not
entirely linear. These results are confirmed by Nichol et al. (2006) using galaxies in the SDSS,
who also measure a weak luminosity dependence in the three-point function. They find that
on scales >10 h−Mpc, the three-point function is greatly affected by the “Sloan Great Wall,”
a massive supercluster that is roughly 450 Mpc (Gott et al. 2005) in length and is associated
with tens of known Abell clusters. These results show that even 2dFGRS and SDSS are not large
enough samples to be unaffected by the most massive, rare structures.
Several studies have examined higher-order correlation functions for galaxies split by color.
Gaztañaga et al. (2005) find a strong dependence of the three-point function on color and
luminosity on scales <6 h−Mpc. Croton et al. (2007) measure up to the five-point correlation
function in 2dFGRS for both blue and red galaxies and find that red galaxies are more clustered
than blue galaxies in all of the N-point functions measured. They also find a luminosity depen-
dence in the hierarchical scaling amplitudes for red galaxies but not for blue galaxies. Taken
together, these results explain why the full galaxy population shows only a weak correlation
with luminosity.
9.2 Voids
In maps of the large-scale structure of galaxies, voids stand out starkly to the eye. There appear
to be vast regions of space with few, if any, L∗galaxies. Voids are among the largest structures
observed in the Universe, spanning typically tens of h−Mpc.
The statistics of voids – their sizes, distribution, and underdensities – are closely tied to
cosmological parameters and the physical details of structure formation (e.g., Sheth and van
de Weygaert 2004). While the two-point correlation function provides a full description of
clustering for a Gaussian distribution, departures from Gaussianity can be tested with higher-
order correlation statistics and voids. For example, the abundance of voids can be used to
test the non-Gaussianity of primordial perturbations, which constrains models of inflation

The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe 8

(Kamionkowski et al. 2009). Additionally, voids provide an extreme low-density environment
in which to study galaxy evolution. As discussed by Peebles (2001), the lack of galaxies in voids
should provide a stringent test for galaxy formation models.
9.2.1 Void and Void Galaxy Properties
The first challenge in measuring the properties of voids and void galaxies is defining the
physical extent of individual voids and identifying which galaxies are likely to be in voids. The
“void finder” algorithm of El-Ad and Piran (1997), which is based on the point distribution of
galaxies (i.e., does not perform any smoothing), is widely used. This algorithm does not assume
that voids are entirely devoid of galaxies and identifies void galaxies as those with three or less
neighboring galaxies within a sphere defined by the mean and standard deviation of the dis-
tance to the third nearest neighbor for all galaxies. All other galaxies are termed “wall” galaxies
(see >Fig. 8-13). An individual void is then identified as the maximal sphere that contains only
void galaxies. This algorithm is widely used by both theorists and observers.
Cosmological simulations of structure formation show that the distribution and density of
galaxy voids are sensitive to the values of Ωmatter and ΩΛ (Kauffmann et al. 1999). Using ΛCDM

The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
N-body dark matter simulations, Colberg et al. (2005) study the properties of voids within the
dark matter distribution and predicts that voids are very underdense (though not empty) up to
a well-defined sharp edge in the dark matter density. They predict that 61% of the volume of
space should be filled by voids at z = compared to 28% at z = and 9% at z = . They also find
that the mass function of dark matter halos in voids is steeper than in denser regions of space.
Using similar ΛCDM N-body simulations with a semi-analytic model for galaxy evolution,
Benson et al. (2003) show that voids should contain both dark matter and galaxies and that
the dark matter halos in voids tend to be low mass and therefore contain fewer galaxies than
in higher density regions. In particular, at density contrasts of δ < −., where δ ≡(ρ/ρmean) −
, both dark matter halos and galaxies in voids should be anti-biased relative to dark matter.
However, galaxies are predicted to be more underdense than the dark matter halos, assuming
simple physically motivate prescriptions for galaxy evolution. They also predict the statistical
size distribution of voids, finding that there should be more voids with smaller radii (<10 h−
Mpc) than larger radii.
The advent of the 2dFGRS and SDSS provided the first very large samples of voids and
void galaxies that could be used to robustly measure their statistical properties. Applying the
“void finder” algorithm on the 2dFGRS dataset, Hoyle and Vogeley (2004) find that the typical
radius of voids is ∼15 h−Mpc. Voids are extremely underdense, with an average density of
δρ/ρ = −., with even lower densities at the center, where fewer galaxies lie. The volume of
space filled by voids is ∼40%. Probing an even larger volume of space using the SDSS dataset,
Pan et al. (2012) found a similar typical void radius and concluded that ∼60% of space is filled
by voids, which have δρ/ρ = −.at their edges. Voids have sharp density profiles in that
they remain extremely underdense to the void radius, where the galaxy density rises steeply.
These observational results agree well with the predictions of ΛCDM simulations discussed
above.
Studies of the properties of galaxy in voids allow an understanding of how galaxy forma-
tion and evolution progresses in the lowest density environments in the Universe, effectively
pursuing the other end of the density spectrum from cluster galaxies. Void galaxies are found
to be significantly bluer and fainter than wall galaxies (Rojas et al. 2004). The luminosity func-
tion of void galaxies shows a lack of bright galaxies but no difference in the measured faint
end slope (Croton et al. 2005; Hoyle et al. 2005), indicating that dwarf galaxies are not likely
to be more common in voids. The normalization of the luminosity function of wall galaxies is
roughly an order of magnitude higher than that of void galaxies; therefore, galaxies do exist
in voids just with a much lower space density. Studies of the optical spectra of void galax-
ies show that they have high star-formation rates, low 4,000Å spectral breaks indicative of
young stellar populations, and low stellar masses, resulting in high specific star formation rates
(Rojas et al. 2005).
However, red quiescent galaxies do exist in voids, just with a lower space density than
blue, star-forming galaxies (Croton et al. 2005). Croton and Farrar (2008) show that the
observed luminosity function of void galaxies can be replicated with a ΛCDM N-body sim-
ulation and simple semi-analytic prescriptions for galaxy evolution. They explain the existence
of red galaxies in voids as residing in the few massive dark matter halos that exist in voids.
Their model requires some form of star-formation quenching in massive halos (>∼10M⊙),
but no additional physics that operates only at low density needs to be included in their
model to match the data. It is therefore the shift in the halo mass function in voids that leads
to different galaxy properties, not a change in the galaxy evolution physics in low-density
environments.

9.2.2 Void Probability Function
In addition to identifying individual voids and the galaxies in them, one can study the statistical
distribution of voids using the void probability function (VPF). Defined by White (1979), the
VPF is the probability that a randomly placed sphere of radius R within a point distribution will
not contain any points (i.e., galaxies, see >Fig. 8-14). The VPF is defined such that it depends
on the space density of points; therefore, one must be careful when comparing datasets and
simulation results to ensure that the same number density is used. The VPF traces clustering in
the weakly nonlinear regime, not in the highly nonlinear regime of galaxy groups and clusters.
Benson et al. (2003) predict using ΛCDM simulations that the VPF of galaxies should be
higher than that of dark matter, that voids as traced by galaxies are much larger than voids
traced by dark matter. This results from the bias of galaxies compared to dark matter in voids
and the fact that in this model the few dark matter halos that do exist in voids are low mass
and therefore often do not contain bright galaxies. Croton et al. (2004b) measure the VPF in
the 2dFGRS dataset and find that it follows hierarchical scaling laws in that all higher-order
correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the two-point correlation function. They
find that even on scales of ∼30 h−Mpc, higher-order correlations have an impact and that the
VPF of galaxies is observed to be different than that of dark matter in simulations.
Conroy et al. (2005) measure the VPF in SDSS galaxies at z ∼.and DEEP2 galaxies at
z ∼and find that voids traced by redder and/or brighter galaxy populations are larger than

The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
voids traced by bluer and/or fainter galaxies. They also find that voids are larger in comoving
coordinates at z ∼.than at z ∼; i.e., voids grow over time, as expected. They show that the
differences observed in the VPF as traced by different galaxy populations are entirely consis-
tent with differences observed in the two-point correlation function and space density of these
galaxy populations. This implies that there does not appear to be additional higher-order infor-
mation in voids than in the two-point function alone. They also find excellent agreement with
predictions from ΛCDM simulations that include semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution.
Tinker et al. (2008) interpret the observed VPF in galaxy surveys in terms of the halo model
(see >Sect. 8). They compare the observed VPF in 2dFGRS and SDSS to halo model predictions
constrained to match the two-point correlation function and number density of galaxies using
a model in which the dark matter halo occupation depends on mass only. They find that with
this model, they can match the observed data very well, implying that there is no need for the
suppression of galaxy formation in voids, i.e., galaxy formation does not proceed differently in
low-density regions. They find that the sizes and emptiness of voids show excellent agreement
with predictions of ΛCDM models for galaxies at low redshift to luminosities of L ∼.L∗.
9.3 Filaments
Galaxy filaments – long strings of galaxies – are the largest systems seen in maps of large-scale
structure and as such, provide a key test of theories of structure formation. Aragon et al. (2010)
show that in simulations while filaments occupy only ∼% of the volume of space, they account
for ∼40% of the mass content of the z = Universe. Measuring the typical and maximal length of
filaments, as well as their thickness and average density therefore constrains theoretical models.
Various statistical methods have been proposed to identify and characterize the morphologies
and properties of filaments (e.g., Sousbie et al. 2008 and references therein; see >Fig. 8-15).
In terms of their sizes, the largest length scale at which filaments are statistically significant,
and hence identified as real objects, is 50–80 h−Mpc, according to an analysis of galaxies in the
Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS; Shectman et al. 1996) by Bharadwaj et al. (2004). They
show that while there appear to be filaments in the survey on longer scales, these arise from
chance alignments and projection effects and are not real structures. Sousbie et al. (2008) iden-
tify and study the length of filaments in SDSS by identifying ridges in the galaxy distribution
using the Hessian matrix (∂ρ/∂xi∂x j) and its eigenvalues (see >Fig. 8-12). They find excellent
agreement between observations and ΛCDM numerical predictions for a flat, low Ωmatter Uni-
verse. They argue that filament measurements are not highly sensitive to observational effects
such as redshift space distortions, edge effects, incompleteness, or galaxy bias, which makes
them a robust test of theoretical models.
Bond et al. (2010) use the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix of the smoothed galaxy dis-
tribution to identify filaments in both SDSS data and ΛCDM simulations and find that the
distribution of filaments lengths is roughly exponential, with many more filaments of length
≲10 h−Mpc than >20 h−Mpc. They find that the filament width distribution agrees between
the SDSS data and N-body simulations. The mean filament width depends on the smoothing
length; for smoothing scales of 10 and h−Mpc, the mean filament widths are 5.5 and 8.4 h−
Mpc. In ΛCDM simulations, they find that the filamentary structure in the dark matter density
distribution is in place by z = , tracing a similar pattern of density ridges. This is in contrast to
what is found for voids, which become much more prominent and low density at later cosmic
epochs.

Choi et al. (2010) use the methods of Bond et al. (2010) to study the evolution of filamen-
tary structure from z ∼.to z ∼.using galaxies from the DEEP2 survey and the SDSS.
They find that neither the space density of filaments nor the distribution of filament lengths has
changed significantly over the last 7 Gyr of cosmic time, in agreement with ΛCDM numerical
predictions. The distribution of filament widths has changed, however, in that the distribution
is broader at lower redshift and has a smaller typical width. This observed evolution in the fila-
ment width distribution naturally results from nonlinear growth of structure and is consistent
with the results on voids discussed above in that over time, voids grow larger while filaments
become tighter (i.e., have a smaller typical width) though not necessarily longer.

Summary and Future
This overview of our current understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe has
shown that quantitative measurementsof the clustering and spatial distribution of galaxies have
wide applications and implications. The nonuniform structure reveals properties of both the
galaxies and the dark matter halos that comprise this large-scale structure. Statistics such as
the two-point correlation function can be used not only to constrain cosmological parame-
ters but also to understand galaxy formation and evolution processes. The advent of extremely

420 8
The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
large redshift surveys with samples of hundreds of thousands of galaxies has led to very precise
measurements of the clustering of galaxies at z ∼.as a function of various galaxy properties
such as luminosity, color, and stellar mass, influencing our understanding of how galaxies form
and evolve. Initial studies at higher redshift have revealed that many of the general correlations
that are observed between galaxy properties and clustering at z ∼were in place when the
Universe was a fraction of its current age. As larger redshift surveys are carried out at higher
redshifts, much more can be learned about how galaxy populations change with time. Theoret-
ical interpretations of galaxy clustering measurements such as the halo occupation distribution
model have also recently made great strides in terms of statistically linking various properties
of galaxies with those of their host dark matter halos. Such studies reveal not only how light
traces mass on large scales but how baryonic mass and dark matter coevolve with cosmic time.
There are many exciting future directions for studies of galaxy clustering and large-scale
structure. Precise cosmological constraints can be obtained using baryon acoustic oscillation
signatures observed in clustering measurements from wide-area surveys (Eisenstein et al.2005).
Specific galaxy populations can be understood in greater detail by comparing their clustering
properties with those of galaxies in general. For example, the clustering of different types of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be used to constrain the AGN fueling mechanisms, lifetimes,
and host galaxy populations (Coil et al. 2009). As discussed above, measurements of galaxy clus-
tering have the power to place strong constraints on contemporary models of galaxy formation
and evolution and advance our understanding of how galaxies populate and evolve within dark
matter halos.

The Distance Scale of the Universe
Abstract:
We critically review the methods currently being used to determine extragalac-
tic distances. Within the Milky Way, direct parallaxes and traditional main-sequence fitting
for both young open clusters and old globular clusters tie us directly to high-luminosity,
variable stars used in extragalactic studies: Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars. These, in turn,
inform a calibration of the tip of the red giant branch as well as red clump stars. Apart from
the Milky Way, we focus on the Large Magellanic Cloud as an important stopping point
at which a large variety of possible distance indicators have been evaluated and differen-
tially tested against each other. Beyond the Local Group many stellar distance indicators fall
below current detection and/or resolution limits, and they must be replaced with methods
employing higher luminosity (and often much more rare) objects. These methods include
the properties of nuclear masers, surface brightness fluctuations, the Tully–Fisher relation,
and finally various types of supernovae. Ultimately a calibration of the expansion rate of the
universe can provide distances using observed recessional velocities scaled by the Hubble
constant.

Introduction
Modern extragalactic astronomy began with Edwin Hubble’s discovery of Cepheid variables
in NGC 6822 (Hubble 1925), M33 (Hubble 1926), and M31 (Hubble 1929). It has taken
the better part of a century to develop the instrumentation and techniques to measure dis-
tances to accuracies of better than 10%, but this is now routine. Smith (1982) gives a his-
tory of the “Great Debate” that occupied the first three decades of the twentieth Century,
while Webb (1999) gives a popular and very readable account of measuring the universe.
Recent developments and a discussion of the convergence of the extragalactic distance to
better than 10% accuracy are reviewed by Freedman and Madore (2010). The current arti-
cle builds upon and augments this discussion. Previous accounts can be found in Hodge
(1982), Rowan-Robinson (1985), Huchra (1992), Jacoby et al. (1992), van den Bergh (1992),
Jackson (2007), and Tammann et al. (2008). There are also several conference proceedings
dedicated to the extragalactic distance scale, including those edited by van den Bergh and
Pritchet (1988) and by Livio et al. (1997); “Stellar Candles for the Extragalactic Distance Scale”
edited by Alloin and Gieren (2003) is particularly comprehensive. Finally, a very up-to-date
and authoritative account of distance measurements in astronomy has recently been published
by de Grijs (2011).
Over the years, a great many extragalactic distance indicators have been tested, calibrated,
and applied to nearby galaxies. Until recently these individual determinations have been scat-
tered throughout the literature and were not being tracked or compiled in any systematic way.
This has all changed with the introduction of NED-D, which is a feature of the NASA/IPAC
Extragalactic Database (NED) that is dedicated to archiving published distances to galaxies,
linking them back to the individual objects, and making them widely available in electronic
form. These up-to-date compilations can be accessed on object-by-object basis through the
main NED interface (http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/forms/d.html), and the entire archive of dis-
tances can be downloaded as a single file from http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/Library/Distances/.
NED-D is updated several times a year.

Measurement of Distances
Measuring extragalactic distances generally involves use of one of two types of cosmological
distances: the luminosity distance,
dL =
√
L
πF
(9.1)
which relates the observed flux (integrated over all frequencies), F, of an object to its intrinsic
luminosity, L, emitted in its rest frame; and the angular diameter distance,
dA = D
θ
(9.2)
which relates the apparent angular size of an object in radians, θ, to its proper size, D. The
luminosity and angular diameter distances are related by
dL = (+ z)dA.
(9.3)
The distance modulus, μ, is related to the luminosity distance as follows:
μ ≡m −M = log dL −
(9.4)
where m and M are the apparent and absolute magnitudes of the objects, respectively, and dL is
in units of parsecs.
Characterized as “standard candles” and “standard rulers,” or more generally known simply
as “distance indicators,” methods that transcend geometry usually rely on identifying a quan-
tity that is independent of distance (a color, a period, a morphological feature, etc.) that can
be precisely measured and then shown to be a predictor of another property of the object in
question (say a star or an entire galaxy) that is either dimmed in luminosity or reduced in size
with distance.
3
Parallaxes
Measuring a parallax (i.e., using direct geometric triangulation with the annual displacement of
the Earth around the Sun as a baseline) is the most straightforward way of determining inter-
stellar distances. In principle, triangulation can be used over any distance; however, the level of
precision required in its application is quickly outstripped by the increasing distances encoun-
tered across our Milky Way galaxy and beyond. Virtually all of the distances discussed from
this point on build upon and use trigonometric parallaxes as foundational but generally rely on
the inverse-square law fall-off of apparent luminosity with distance as the means of inferring
distances across cosmic scales. A comprehensive review of trigonometric parallaxes and espe-
cially the impact of the Hipparcos astrometric satellite can be found in Heck and Caputo (1999),
amplified and updated in Perryman (2009). We discuss the HST Cepheid parallax calibration
in >Sect. 8.4.1.

Rotational Parallax Method
In a variety of contexts (optical and radio), the combination of proper motions and radial
velocities has been implemented as a novel and promising means of determining a geometric
distance to nearby galaxies (Loeb et al. 2005). For objects in the Local Group (at distances out
to ∼1 Mpc.), proper motions having a precision of 10–20 μarcsec/year measured from the
ground (in the radio) or from space (e.g., with the planned European Space Agency mission
GAIA) are sufficient to provide “rotational parallaxes” within a 3–5-year time baseline. For
a rotating disk galaxy (such as M31 or M33), the in-plane rotational velocity (km/s) can be
equated to the transverse angular velocity (i.e., the proper motion) appropriately scaled by the
distance. Bymeasuring (tangential)propermotions and having knowledge ofthe radial-velocity
field of the disk (corrected for inclination), one can derive the distance assuming reasonable
symmetries in the structure of the disk and its velocity field.
Using 22 GHz HO (water) masers, a rotational parallax for M33 has already been mea-
sured (Brunthaler et al. 2005), and a complementary program is now underway using recently
discovered water masers in M31 (Darling 2011). Watermasers have also been observed in IC 10
(Henkel et al. 1986), but given their less than regular velocity field (Wilcots and Miller 1998),
the inversion of proper motions and radial velocities to determine a distance to this galaxy will
be more challenging. Perhaps the apparent angular divergence of sources (discussed by Darling
2011 for M31) as IC 10 approaches the Milky Way at −350 km/s, can be used in the future.
5
The Role of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds
The Large Magellanic Cloud has played and probably will continue to play a central role in the
refinement of the extragalactic distance scale. The primary reason is, of course, its proximity.
Additionally, the LMC is a composite system, containing a mix of old, intermediate-age, and
young stars in a system that is sufficiently massive that it has numerous examples of almost
every type of distance indicator currently in use; one notable exception being a recent type Ia
supernova. An extensive compilation of 275 distance estimatesto the LMC is currently available
from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED): http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/
nDistance?name=lmc. The range in quoted distances is almost certainly dominated by system-
atic errors. The values for the LMC distance modulus fall generally in the range of 18.1–18.7mag
(i.e., 42–55 kpc), with more recent values tending to cluster around a distance modulus of
18.5 mag (see Alves 2004; Schaeffer 2008).
The LMC is sufficiently far away that its stellar components can all be considered to be at
the same distance. Under this assumption, most of the observed dispersion in any luminosity-
based distance indicator can be ascribed either to differential reddening or an intrinsic scatter
in the distance determination method itself. Similarly, differences in relative zero points of vari-
ous distance indicators when compared in a single system, like the LMC, can expose systematic
errors in one or both of the methods. At a finer level of scrutiny, however, the back-to-front
geometry of the LMC is in fact measurable by individual distance indicators of exceptionally
high internal precision, such as the Classical Cepheids (Gascoigne and Shobbrook 1978), or
by methods employing large statistical samples (e.g., Weinberg and Nikolaev 2001). System-
atic shifts in the apparent distance modulus with position on the sky can then, with some
certainty, be attributed to tilt of the disk of the galaxy with respect to the plane of the sky.

> Figure 9-1 illustrates this for Cepheids in the LMC recently observed using mid-IR data
Cepheid from Spitzer (Scowcroft et al. 2012).
The Small Magellanic Cloud is only slightly (0.4 mag or 10 kpc) further away than the LMC,
and it is also somewhat less massive, but its three-dimensional geometry is so distorted that the
system as a whole holds less promise than the LMC (or even some more distant galaxies like IC
1613, M31, and M33) in testing distance indicators. The SMC appear to be so tidally disrupted
that the line-of-sight differences in distance moduli across the system appears to be as large as
0.5 mag peak-to-peak.

RR Lyrae Stars
It is probable that every type of variable star has been tested for its suitability as a distance
indicator, if for no other reason than its period (if it has a stable period) or its characteristic
timescale might be used as a distance-independentmeans of predicting the star’s intrinsic lumi-
nosity. RR Lyrae stars are no exception to this rule, but they also have the added advantage that

428 9
The Distance Scale of the Universe
many of them are known to be members of globular clusters. This latter attribute offers up the
possibility that they can be independently calibrated in absolute terms, through main sequence
fitting, for example. On the negative side, for most extragalactic applications, RR Lyrae variables
are faint. They reside on the horizontal branch and have absolute magnitudes that are around
MV = +.mag. An up-to-date and comprehensive review of the properties of RR Lyrae stars
can be found in the monograph by Smith (1995), while a recent review of their status as distance
indicators can be found in Bono (2003). An indication of the systematics encountered in apply-
ing RR Lyraes to the distance scale can be seen in >Fig. 9-2, which compares 38 independent
RR Lyrae distance determinations to the LMC.
Heroic ground-based efforts to detect RR Lyrae stars beyond the Magellanic Cloud were
surpassed only in precision and sample size by HST. However, no effort by any telescope on the
ground or in space has been made to detect RR Lyraes beyond the Local Group; they are simply
too faint. Nevertheless 23 Local Group galaxies have been successfully surveyed for RR Lyrae
stars; a representative sampling of these is given in >Table 9-1.
If RR Lyraes are to be continued to be observed in Local Group galaxies and used to test
for consistency in overlapping distance indicators, then there are some newly revealed advan-
tages in moving the calibration to the near infrared. As modeled by Catelan et al. (2004)
and earlier observed by Longmore et al. (1986), the period-luminosity relation for RR Lyrae
stars becomes significantly better defined in the near infrared, having a steeper slope and
much decreased intrinsic scatter, as compared to the optical where the V-band magnitude
is almost degenerate with period. This behavior for variable stars in general is discussed in
Madore and Freedman (2012).

Red Clump Stars
After leaving the hydrogen-burning main sequence, stars can enter a second fairly long-lived
phase of central nuclear energy generation, this time powered by core helium burning. The
helium-burning main sequence of low-mass stars is seen as the horizontal branch typical of
many Population II systems. The helium-burning main sequence of intermediate-age (higher-
mass) clump stars can be seen in the color–magnitude diagram as an enhancement in the
luminosity function near to the giant branch and at an absolute magnitude level slightly brighter
than the older, traditional horizontal branch.
Use of the red giant clump as a distance indicator has had a checkered history. This is pri-
marily due to the difficulty of establishing the age and metallicity of the underlying stellar
populations, but it is also affected by the changing wavelength domain that has been used to
calibrate it. The evolving nature of our understanding of this feature is best illustrated by its
application to determining a distance to the LMC.
As with many distance indicators, age and metallicity effects are often in play at the same
time, but the luminosity measured at different wavelengths may be responding, to varying
degrees, to each of these effects. The question ultimately boils down to this: Is the luminosity of
any given feature in the color–magnitude diagram a strong function of age and/or metallicity?
Often a second parameter is usually sought to “calibrate out” the sensitivity of the luminos-
ity to nuisance parameters such as metallicity and age (see, e.g., Alves and Sarajedini 1999;
Girardi and Salaris 2001). However, it is also true that the degree to which any one of these
parameters affects the luminosity can itself be a function of wavelength. Atmospheric line tran-
sitions that are often sensitive to and diagnostic of metallicity are heavily concentrated in the
shorter-wavelength blue and optical portions of the spectrum; therefore by moving to the red
or near infared, one should become naturally less sensitive to metallicity and thus a better dis-
tance indicator. The other immediate benefit of moving as far to the infrared as possible is the
monotonically decreasing effect of interstellar reddening.
Udalski et al. (1998) and later Udalski (2000) used I-band data for the red clump stars
in the LMC to argue for a very small distance modulus to the LMC of 18.24 mag, or nearly
0.25 mag short of the generally accepted distance modulus of 18.50 mag. The debate rapidly
gathered momentum and diverged on several fronts. Stanek et al. (1998) compared I-band

data of red clump stars from the Hipparcos catalog with their counterparts in two fields in
the LMC and found an even shorter distance to the LMC corresponding to a true modulus of
only 18.07 mag ± 0.03 (random) ± 0.09 (systematic).
Alves (2000) then moved the debate to the near infrared by providing a K-band calibration
based again on galactic stars with direct individual parallaxes from Hipparcos combined with
I-band photometry. Koerwer (2009) subsequently applied a mid-IR calibration of the red clump
to the LMC and found 18.54 ± 0.06 mag. Alves et al. (2002) and also Pietrzynski et al. (2003)
each determined a distance modulus for the LMC that yielded a value of 18.50 ± 0.03 mag. The
Alves calibration was claimed to be independent of metallicity over the range −.< [Fe/H] <
.dex. However, Girardi and Salaris (2001) have modeled corrections for population effects,
involving age and metallicity, (see also Sarajedini 1999 and Pietrzynski et al. 2010 for comple-
mentary empirical approaches) and find corrections in the I band of 0.2 mag. For completeness,
see also Seidel et al. (1987), Paczynski and Stanek (1998), Grocholski and Sarajedini (2002) and
Sarajedini et al. (2002).
Sixteen distance determinations to the LMC using the red clump method have been pub-
lished; their values range from 18.03 to 18.59 mag; there distribution is shown in >Fig. 9-3.
Eleven other galaxies, all in the Local Group, have also had their distances estimated by the red
clump method.
7.1 The CMD Method, the Horizontal Branch, and Mira Variables
Given full color–magnitude diagrams (CMD) for the resolved populations of nearby galaxies
not only can individual stars (e.g., Cepheids, RR Lyraes, Miras, etc.) and featured groups of
stars (such as the TRGB and the horizontal branch) be used to gauge distances, but the entire
CMD itself can be deconstructed, with distances and stellar populations being self-consistently
solved for. The concept finds its origins with Tolstoy and Saha (1996) and has been more fully
developed by Dolphin (2002) and applied most recently by de Jong et al. (2008). Only eight

The Distance Scale of the Universe
Local Group galaxies (And I, II, and III, Sculptor, CVn II, LGS 3, Ursa Minor, and Fornax) are
close enough to use the horizontal branch method to determine distances. And four galaxies
(LMC, M33, NGC 5128, and the Phoenix Dwarf) have been monitored sufficiently that they
have had distance estimates derived from long-period Mira variables.

Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF)
The distinctive and rapid cutoff observed at the bright end of the [OIII]5007λ emission-line
luminosity function for planetary nebulae provides a distance determination method (e.g.,
Ciardullo et al. 1989). Examples of some luminosity functions obtained at the current dis-
tance limits of this method’s application and the adopted fits are given in >Fig. 9-4. Extensively

referenced reviews of the technique can be found in Jacoby et al. (1992), Jacoby and Ciardullo
(1993), and more recently Ciardullo (2003).
One important advantage of the PLNF method is that it can be applied to both elliptical
galaxies and Population II rich spiral galaxies, thereby providing an important point of direct
comparison of distance determination methods that are otherwise heavily restricted to only
one or the other populations, such as the SBF method for elliptical galaxies and the Cepheid PL
relation for spirals. An excellent reviews of PLNF distances are given in Ciardullo et al. (2002)
and Ciardullo (2005).
There are some subtleties that need to be paid attention to in using the PLNF method for
deriving distances. These include culling out interlopers, especially at the bright end of the lumi-
nosity function where the measurement of the edge is intrinsically sensitive to small-number
statistics. Known contaminants include HII regions, supernova remnants, background high-
redshift, emission-line galaxies, and rare but super-luminous planetary nebulae. Accounting
for the possible effects of interstellar extinction is a concern not easily dealt with (Ciardullo
et al. 2002).
To date, 57 galaxies have had their PNLF measured and used to estimate their distances;
the most distant application being made to objects in the Virgo and Fornax clusters. Pressing
the technique to large distances requires not only larger aperture telescopes but also custom-
built (or tuneable) narrowband (30-Å) filters targeting specific redshift intervals appropriate to
individual galaxies.
8.1 Globular Cluster Luminosity Functions (GCLF)
At one time, it was suggested that the brightest globular cluster in any given system might be
used as a distance indicator (Sandage 1968). This proved not to be the case as later studies found
that the there was no bright cutoff in the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) and that
the brightest globular clusters simply scaled with the size of the total population. Later the mag-
nitude of the peak of the luminosity function, which is relatively bright (MV ∼−.mag), was
explored as a distance indicator (Hanes 1979). Recent reviews and discussions of the GCLF
method can be found in Tamman and Sandage (1999), Ferrarese et al. (2000), and Richler
(2003). Further complications include the realization that cluster destruction rates will be differ-
ent in disk galaxies compared toelliptical galaxies and will be a function ofan individual cluster’s
physical structure, such as compactness. Gnedin and Ostriker (1998) calculate that 50–90% of a
globular cluster population will be destroyed, by dynamical friction, tidal shocks, or simple core
collapse and disintegration, in a Hubble time. Furthermore, the discovery of color bimodality in
the integrated color–magnitude distributions of globular clusters in a number of nearby galax-
ies (see Forbes et al. 1997) means that there will be age or metallicity-induced differences in the
mean magnitude of the luminosity function itself, thereby complicating its calibration and com-
promising its application as a distance indicator (see Richler 2003 for an in-depth discussion).
To date, over 142 galaxies have their distances estimated by the GCLF method.
8.2 Novae
Novae are cataclysmic variables (thought to result from thermonuclear runaway on a
mass-accreting white dwarf in a close binary system) whose absolute visual magnitudes cover

434 9
The Distance Scale of the Universe
a wide range but can reach up to MV = −mag. This alone makes them of interest as potential
distance indicators. Zwicky (1936) was the first to note that the peak brightness of a nova corre-
lates with its rate of decline; that is, intrinsically faint novae fade more slowly than their brighter
counterparts. As most recently emphasized by Ferrarese et al. (2003), a calibration of the max-
imum magnitude versus rate of decline (MMRD) relation (actually called the “life-luminosity”
relation by Zwicky) has proven to be “remarkably illusive,” primarily due to a lack of data. Other
than M31, where the heroic surveys by Arp (1956) early on, and then again later by Capaccioli
et al. (1989) produced many novae, the LMC (with only a handful of well-studied novae, Capac-
cioli et al. 1990) is the only other galaxy that has a viable sample of published light curves with
which to attempt a calibration (e.g., Della and Livio 1995 for a recent example).
Novae cannot be predicted, but once found, they fade rapidly and are not easily followed up
at other wavelengths or at higher signal-to-noise. Moreover, the interpretation of single-band
discoveries is subject to being systematically compromised by unknown amounts of individ-
ual lines-of-sight extinction. A 24-orbit HST campaign to discover and follow novae in the
Virgo-cluster galaxy, Messier 49 = NGC 4472 (Ferrarese et al. 2003), resulted in only five “fairly
complete” light curves. However, the sobering conclusion of that study was that there are sub-
stantial differences in the shape of the MMRD in M31, the Milky Way, and M49. A more
optimistic assessment of novae as extragalactic distance indicators can be found in Gilmozzi
and Della Valle (2003) but see also Della and Livio (1995). Only three galaxies (LMC, M31, and
M100 = NGC 4321) have had their distances estimated using novae.
8.3 Type II Supernovae: EPM and SEAM
Two methods are used to determine distances in the universe based on type II SN: the expand-
ing photosphere method (EPM, Kirschner and Kwan 1974; Eastman and Kirshner 1989) and
the spectral-fitting expanding atmosphere method (SEAM, Baron et al. 1995, 2004). The EPM
is based on the Baade–Wesselink method (Baade 1926) and is particularly effective when the
metallic line-blanketing effects in the optical are small (early phases). EPM uses a black-body
approximation to the spectral energy distribution, adjust by a variety of correction factors
(Eastman et al. 1996). SEAM uses synthetic spectra and fits the observed energy distributions
directly. For a discussion of the relative merits of the two techniques, the reader is referred to
the recent paper on the SN II distance scale (Dessart and Hiller 2005). Over 30 galaxies have
had their distances determined using type II supernovae.
8.4 Cepheid Distance Scale
Since the discovery of the Leavitt Law (Leavitt 1908; Leavitt and Pickering 1912) and its use by
Hubble to measure the distances to the Local Group galaxies, Cepheid variables have remained
a widely applicable and powerful method for measuring distances to nearby galaxies. Cepheids’
periods of pulsation range from 2 to over 100 days, and their intrinsic brightnesses range from
−2 < MV < −mag. Detailed reviews of the Cepheid distance scale and its calibration can be
found in Madore and Freedman (1991), Sandage and Tammann (2006), Fouque et al. (2007),
and Barnes (2009). A recent, more lengthy discussion is contained in Freedman and Madore
(2010), while a review of the early history of the subject is given in Fernie (1969).

The Distance Scale of the Universe 9
435
There are many steps that must be taken in applying Cepheids to the extragalactic distance
scale. Overcoming crowding and confusion is the key to the successful discovery, measure-
ment, and use of Cepheids in galaxies beyond the Local Group. From the ground, atmospheric
turbulence degrades the image resolution, decreasing the contrast of point sources against the
background. As higher precision data have been accumulated for Cepheids in greater numbers
and in different physical environments, it has become possible to search for and investigate a
variety of lower level, but increasingly important, systematics affecting the Leavitt Law.
The physical basis for the Leavitt Law is well understood. Cepheid pulsation occurs because
of the changing atmospheric opacity with temperature in the doubly ionized helium zone. This
zone acts like a heat engine and valve mechanism. During the portion of the cycle when the
ionization layer is opaque to radiation that layer traps energy resulting in an increase in its
internal pressure. This added pressure acts to elevate the layers of gas above it, resulting in
the observed radial expansion. As the star expands, it does work against gravity and the gas
cools. As it does so, its temperature falls back to a point where the doubly ionized helium layer
recombines and becomes transparent again, thereby allowing more radiation to pass. Without
that added source of heating, the local pressure drops, the expansion stops, the star recollapses,
and the cycle repeats. The alternate trapping and releasing of energy in the helium ionization
layer ultimately gives rise to the periodic change in radius, temperature, and luminosity seen
at the surface. Not all stars are unstable to this mechanism. The cool (red) edge of the Cepheid
instability strip is thought to be controlled by the onset of convection, which then prevents the
helium ionization zone from driving the pulsation. For hotter temperatures, the helium ioniza-
tion zone is located too far out in the atmosphere for significant pulsations to occur. Further
details can be found in the classic stellar pulsation textbook by Cox (1980), and Freedman and
Madore (2010).
Cepheids have been intensively modeled numerically, with increasingly sophisticated
hydrodynamical codes (for a recent review, see Buchler 2009). While continuing progress is
being made, the challenges remain formidable in following a dynamical atmosphere and in
modeling convection with a time-dependent mixing length approximation. In general, obser-
vational and theoretical period–luminosity–color relations are in reasonable agreement (e.g.,
Caputo 2008). However, subtle effects (e.g., that of metallicity on the luminosities and colors of
Cepheids) remain difficult to predict from first principles.
8.4.1 Galactic Cepheids with Trigonometric Parallaxes
An accurate trigonometric parallax calibration for galactic cepheids has been long sought but
very difficult to achieve in practice. All known classical (galactic) Cepheids are more than 250pc
away; therefore for direct distance estimates good to 10%, parallax accuracies of ±0.2milliarcsec
are required, necessitating space observations. The HIPPARCOSsatellite reported parallaxes for
200 of the nearest Cepheids, but (with the exception of Polaris) even the best of these had very
low signal-to-noise ratio (Feast and Catchpole 1997).
Benedict et al. (2007) used the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) on HST to provide the first
high-precision, geometric parallaxes to ten nearby galactic Cepheids having periods ranging
from 4 to 36 days. Spitzer mid-infrared data for the HST parallax calibration sample, as well as
Cepheids in the LMC, have now been obtained (Monson et al. 2012; Scowcroft et al. 2012; Freed-
man et al. 2012). The advantages of the mid-infrared are many, including the small dispersion
in the mid-infrared Leavitt relations, as well as the insensitivity to reddening and metallicity.

The Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud Based on Cepheids
Several thousand Cepheids have been identified and cataloged in the LMC (Leavitt 1908;
Alcock et al. 2000; Soszynski et al. 2008), all at essentially the same distance. Both historically
and today, the slope of the Leavitt Law is both statistically and systematically better determined
in the LMC than it is for Cepheids in our own galaxy. This is especially true for the long-period
end of the calibration where the extragalactic samples are much larger than the small sample
of nearby Cepheids in the Milky Way. The main drawback to using the LMC as the fundamen-
tal calibrator of the Leavitt Law is the fact that the LMC Cepheids are of lower metallicity than
many of the more distant spiral galaxies useful for measuring the Hubble constant. This system-
atic is largely eliminated by adopting the higher-metallicity galactic calibration or calibration
based on the distance to the maser spiral galaxy, NGC 4258.
In >Fig. 9-5, we show the Leavitt Law at 3.6 μm for 82 Cepheids in the LMC (with 6 < P < 60
days) as given by Scowcroft et al. (2012). The dispersion in the 3.6-μm relation amounts to only
±0.106 mag (oran uncertaintyof±5% in distance fora single Cepheid). Forcomparison, we also
show the V-band data from Madore and Freedman (1991) for LMC Cepheids. The dispersion in
this case is more than a factor of 2 greater, amounting to ±0.252 mag. One hundred previously
published distance moduli to the LMC, based solely on Cepheids, are shown in >Fig. 9-6.

9.1 Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) Method
The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method uses the theoretically well-understood and
observationally well-defined discontinuity in the luminosity function of stars evolving up the
red giant branch in old, metal-poor stellar populations. This feature has been calibrated using
galactic globular clusters, and because of its simplicity and straightforward application, it has
been widely used to determine distances to nearby galaxies. The method was developed quan-
titatively in two papers: one by DaCosta and Armandroff (1990) for galactic globular clusters
and the other by Lee et al. (1993), where the use of a quantitative digital filter to measure the tip
location was first introduced in an extragalactic context. The method has a precision compara-
ble to Cepheids. Recent and excellent reviews of the topic have been published by Rizzi et al.
(2007) and Bellazzini (2008).
Approximately 250 galaxies have had their distances measured by the TRGB method. This
is to be compared to a total of 57 galaxies with Cepheid distances. (A comprehensive compi-
lation of direct distance determinations is available at the following website: http://nedwww.
ipac.caltech.edu/level5/NED1D/ned1d.html). A comparison of nine applications of the TRGB
method to the LMC is given in >Fig. 9-7. In practice, the TRGB method is observationally a
much more efficient technique since, unlike for Cepheid variables, there is no need to follow
them through a variable light cycle; a single-epoch observation, made at two wavelengths (to
provide color information), is sufficient. A recent example of applying the TRGB technique to
the maser galaxy, NGC 4258, is shown in > Figs. 9-7 and >9-8.
The TRGB is also well-understood theoretically (e.g., Iben and Renzini 1983; Freedman
and Madore 2010). In brief, the helium core at the center of a red giant is supported by electron
degeneracy pressure. A hydrogen-burning shell surrounds the core and provides the luminosity
of the star. Fall-out, in the form of “helium ash” from the shell, increases the mass of the core
over time. As the core mass increases, the radius shrinks, the temperature of the shell, and con-
sequently the luminosity generated in the shell, increases; the star rises along the giant branch

with increasing luminosity and higher core temperatures. When the (isothermal) core temper-
ature reaches a physically well-defined temperature, helium ignites throughout the core. This
helium core ignition lifts the electron degeneracy within the core. This dramatic change in the
equation of state is such that the core flash is internally quenched in a matter of seconds. The
core is inflated and settles down to a lower-luminosity, helium core-burning main sequence.
The transition from the red giant to the horizontal branch occurs rapidly (within a few mil-
lion years) so that observationally the TRGB can be treated as a physical discontinuity. Nuclear
physics fundamentally controls the stellar luminosity at which the RGB is truncated, essentially
independent of the chemical composition and/or residual mass of the envelope sitting above
the core.
The radiation from stars at the TRGB is redistributed with wavelength as a function of the
metallicity and mass of the envelope. Empirically it is found that the bolometric corrections
are smallest in the I-band, and most recent measurements have been made at this wavelength.
The small residual metallicity effect on the TRGB luminosity is well documented and can be
empirically calibrated out (see Madore et al. 2009).
9.2 Maser Galaxies
HO (water) megamasershave been shown to provide an independentand potentially powerful
means of accurately measuring extragalactic distances geometrically. Lo (2005) has reviewed
both the physical nature of megamasersand their application to the extragalactic distance scale.
The technique utilizes the mapping of 22.2 GHz water maser sources orbiting in the accretion
disks of black holes in spiral galaxies with active galactic nuclei, where modeling of those disks
assumes simple Keplerian motion. A rotation curve is derived for the major axis of the disk;
proper motions are measured on the near side of the disk on the minor axis. Scaling the angular
velocities across the line of sight to the absolute (radial) velocities along the line of sight yields
the distance.
The method requires a sample of accretion disks that are relatively edge on (so that a rotation
curve can be obtained from radial-velocity measurements) and a heating source such as x-rays
or shocks to produce maser emission. The basic assumption is that the maser emission arises
from trace amounts of water vapor (<10−in number density) in very small density enhance-
ments in the accretion disk and that they act as perfect dynamical test particles. The maser
sources appear as discrete peaks in the spectrum or as unresolved spots in the images con-
structed from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Measurements of the acceleration
(a = V/r) are obtained directly by monitoring the change of maser radial velocities over time
from single-dish observations. Proper motions are obtained from observed changes in angular
position in interferometer images. The approximately Keplerian rotation curve for the disk can
then be modeled, allowing for warps and radial structures. The best studied galaxy, NGC 4258,
at a distance of about 7 Mpc is still too close to provide a secure measurement of the Hubble
constant on its own (i.e., free from local velocity-field perturbations), but it can serve as an
invaluable independent check of the Cepheid zero-point calibration.

masers have been published (e.g., Herrnstein et al. 1999; Humphreys et al. 2008, and refer-
ences therein). Over time, it has been possible to measure both proper motions and accel-
erations of these sources and thereby allow for the derivation of two independent distance
estimates to this galaxy. The excellent agreement of these two estimates supports the a pri-
ori adoption of the Keplerian disk model and gives distances of 7.2 ± 0.2 and 7.1 ± 0.2 Mpc,
respectively.
Because of the simplicity of the structure of the maser system in NGC 4258 and its rela-
tive strength, NGC 4258 will remain a primary test bed for studying systematic effects that may
influence distance estimates. Several problems may limit the ultimate accuracy of this tech-
nique, however. For example, because the masers are only distributed over a small angular part
ofthe accretion disk, it is difficult toassess the importance ofnoncircularorbits. Ofpossible con-
cern, eccentric disks of stars have been observed in a number galactic nuclei where the potential
is dominated by the black hole, as is the case for NGC 4258. In addition, even if the disk is cir-
cular, it is not a given that the masers along the minor axis are at the same radii as the masers
along the major axis. The self gravity of the disk also may need to be investigated and mod-
eled since the maser distribution suggests the existence of spiral arms (Humphreys et al. 2008).
Finally, radiative transfer effects maycause nonphysical motions in the maserimages. Although
the current agreement of distances using several techniques is comforting, having only one sole
calibrating galaxy for this technique remains a concern, and further galaxies will be required to
ascertain the limiting uncertainty in this method.
9.2.2 Other Distance Determinations to NGC 4258
The first Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 was published by Maoz et al. (1999) who found
a distance of 8.1 ± 0.4 Mpc, scaled to an LMC-calibrated distance modulus of 18.50 mag.
Newman et al. (2001) found a distance modulus of 29.47 ± 0.09 (random) ±0.15 (systematic),
giving a distance of 7.83 ± 0.3 ±0.5 Mpc. Macri et al. (2006) reobserved NGC 4258 discov-
ering 281 Cepheids at BV and I wavelengths in two radially (and chemically) distinct fields.
Their analysis gives a distance modulus of 29.38 ± 0.04 ± 0.05 mag (7.52 ± 0.16 Mpc), if one
adopts μ(LMC) = .mag. Several more recent determinations of resolved-star (Cepheid
and TRGB) distance moduli to NGC 4258 are in remarkably good agreement with the maser
distance modulus. For instance, diBenedetto (2008) measures a Cepheid distance modulus of
29.28 ± 0.03 ± 0.03 for NGC 4258 (corresponding to a distance of 7.18 Mpc); Benedict et al.
(2007) find a distance modulus of 29.28 ± 08 mag; and Mager et al. (2008) also find a value of
29.28 ± 0.04 ± 0.12 mag both from Cepheids and from the TRGB method. These latter studies
are in exact agreement with the current maser distance. Higher accuracy has come from larger
samples with higher signal-to-noise data and improved treatment of metallicity.
An alternative approach to utilizing the maser galaxy in the distance scale is to adopt
the geometric distance to NGC 4258 as foundational, use it to calibrate the Leavitt Law, and
from there, determine the distance to the LMC. Macri et al. (2006) adopted this approach and
concluded that the true distance modulus to the LMC is 18.41 ± 0.10 mag.

9.2.3 NGC 4258, UGC 3789, and Their Calibration of Ho
The distance to NGC 4258 has been used to bypass the LMC in calibrating the
Cepheid PL relation and then secondary methods. For example, Macri et al. (2006) and
Riess et al. (2009a, b) have adopted the distance to NGC 4258 to calibrate the supernova distance
scale, as discussed further in >Sect. 10.
Attempts to measure distances to additional megamaser host galaxies have been challeng-
ing. About 2000 galaxies have been surveyed in search of nuclear disk masers, with about 100
masers being culled from this sample. The rather low detection rate of 5% is likely due to detec-
tion sensitivity, combined with the geometric constraint that the maser disk be viewed nearly
edge on, because the maser emission is expected to be highly beamed in the plane of the disk.
About 30 of these masers have spectral profiles indicative of emission from thin disks: that is,
masers at the galactic systemic velocity and groups of masers symmetrically spaced in velocity.
In the end, about a dozen maser galaxies are sufficiently strong that they are candidates for being
imaged with phase-referenced VLBI techniques. However, only about five have been found to
have sufficiently simple structures that they can be fit to dynamical models and thereby have
their distances determined. The most promising example is UGC 03789 at a recessional velocity
of 3,325 km/s. A first-epoch determination of a geometric distance to this galaxy has been pub-
lished by Braatz et al. (2010) as part of the Megamaser Cosmology Project (Reid et al. 2009). For
its geometric/maser distance of 49.9 ± 7.0 Mpc, this galaxy alone gives Ho = 69 ± 11 km/s/Mpc.
Correcting the observed velocity for large-scale flow perturbations due to Virgo, the Great
Attractor and the Shapley Concentration give V = 3,530 ± 26 km/s and Ho = 71 km/s/Mpc.
If a significant number of maser galaxies can be found and precisely observed even further
into the Hubble flow, this method can, in principle, compete with methods such as SNe Ia for
directly measuring distances at cosmologically significant scales.
9.3 Surface Brightness Fluctuation (SBF) Method
Fordistances toelliptical galaxies and early-type spirals with large bulge populations, the surface
brightness fluctuation (SBF) method, first introduced by Tonry and Schneider (1988), overlaps
with and substantially exceeds the current reach of the TRGB method (Tonry et al. 2001). Both
methods use properties of the red giant branch luminosity function to estimate distances. The
SBF method quantifies the effect of distance on an overall measure of resolution of the Pop-
ulation II red giant stars, naturally weighted both by their intrinsic luminosities and relative
numbers. What is measured is the pixel-to-pixel variance in the photon statistics (scaled by the
surface brightness) as derived from an image of a pure population of red giant branch stars. For
fixed surface brightness, the variance in a pixel (of fixed angular size) is a function of distance
simply because the total number of discrete sources contributing to any given pixel increases
with the square of the distance. While the TRGB method relies entirely on the very brightest
red giant stars, the SBF method uses a luminosity-weighted integral over the entire RGB pop-
ulation in order to define a typical “fluctuation star” whose mean magnitude, MI, is assumed
to be universal and can therefore be used to derive distances. For recent discussions of the SBF
method, the reader is referred to Biscardi et al. (2008), Blakeslee et al. (2009), and an update by
Blakeslee et al. (2010).
Aside from the removal of obvious sources of contamination such as foreground stars,
dust patches, and globular clusters, the SBF method does require some additional corrections.

442 9
The Distance Scale of the Universe
It is well known that the slope of the red giant branch in the color–magnitude diagram is
a function of metallicity, and so the magnitude of the fluctuation star is both expected and
empirically found to be a function metallicity. A (fairly steep) correction for metallicity has
been derived and can be applied using the mean color of the underlying stellar population
MI = −.+ .(V −I)o −.(Tonry et al. 2002).
9.4 Tully–Fisher Relation
The total luminosity of a spiral galaxy (corrected to face-on inclination to account for extinc-
tion) is strongly correlated with the galaxy’s maximum (corrected to edge-on inclination)
rotation velocity. This relation, calibrated via the Leavitt Law or TRGB, becomes a powerful
means of determining extragalactic distances (Tully and Fisher 1977; Aaronson et al. 1986;
Pierce and Tully 1988; Giovanelli et al. 1997). The Tully–Fisher relation at present is one of
the most widely applied methods for distance measurements, providing distances to thousands
of galaxies both in the general field and in groups and clusters. The scatter in this relation
is wavelength-dependent and approximately ±0.3–0.4 mag or 15–20% in distance (Giovanelli
et al. 1997; Sakai et al. 2000; Tully and Pierce 2000).
In a general sense, the Tully–Fisher relation can be understood in terms of the virial relation
applied to rotationally supported disk galaxies, under the assumption of a constant mass-to-
light ratio (Aaronson et al. 1979). However, a detailed self-consistent physical picture that
reproduces the Tully–Fisher relation (e.g., Steinmetz and Navarro 1999) and the role of dark
matter in producing almost universal spiral galaxy rotation curves (McGaugh et al. 2000) still
remain a challenge.
Spitzer archival data have recently yielded an unexpected and exciting discovery. Of the 23
nearby galaxies with HST Cepheid distances that can be used to independently calibrate the
Tully–Fisher relation, there are 17 that currently also have 3.6-μm total magnitudes (Seibert
et al. 2012). In >Fig. 9-9 (left three panels), we show the B-, V-, and I-band TF relations for
the entire sample of currently available calibrating galaxies from Sakai et al. (2000). Their mag-
nitudes have been corrected for inclination-induced extinction effects, and their line widths
have been corrected to edge-on. The scatter is ±0.43, 0.36, and 0.36 mag for the B-, V-, and
I-band relations, respectively; the outer lines follow the mean regression at ±2 sigma. In the
right panel of > Fig. 9-7, we show the mid-IR TF relation for the same 17 galaxies with
Cepheid distances and IRAC observations, measured here at 3.6 μm. The scatter at 3.66 μm is
±0.31 mag. This calibration will be applied to Spitzer 3.6-μm data for several hundred galaxies
(Seibert et al. 2012).
9.5 Type Ia Supernovae
One of the most accurate means of measuring cosmological distances out into the Hubble flow
utilizes the peak brightness of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The potential of supernovae for
measuring distances was clear to early researchers (e.g., Baade, Minkowski, Zwicky), but it
was the Hubble diagram of Kowal (1968) that set the modern course for this field, followed
by decades of work by Sandage, Tammann, and collaborators (e.g., Sandage and Tammann
1982; Sandage and Tammann 1990); see also the review by Branch (1998). Analysis by Pskovskii
(1984), followed by Phillips (1993), established a correlation between the magnitude of an SN Ia

for 17 galaxies are available at all four wavelengths. The dispersions in these relations are shown
in the lower right
at peak brightness and the rate at which it declines, thus allowing supernova luminosities to be
“standardized.” This method currently probes farthest into the unperturbed Hubble flow, and it
possesses very low intrinsic scatter; in recent studies, the decline-rate corrected SN Ia Hubble
diagram is found to have a dispersion of ±7–10% in distance (e.g., Folatelli et al. 2010; Hicken
et al. 2009). A simple lack of Cepheid calibrators prevented the accurate calibration of type Ia
supernovae for determination of H○prior to HST. Substantial improvements to the supernova
distance scale have resulted from recent dedicated, ground-based supernova search and follow-
up programs yielding CCD light curves for nearby supernovae (e.g., Hamuy et al. 1996; Jha et al.
2006; Contreras et al. 2010). Sandage and collaborators undertook a major program with HST
to find Cepheids in nearby galaxies that have been host to Type Ia supernovae (Sandage et al.
1996; Saha et al. 1999), and thereby provided the first Cepheid zero-point calibration, which
has recently been followed up by Macri et al. (2006) and Riess et al. (2009a, b) > Figs. 9-10
and >9-11.
SNe Ia result from the thermonuclear runawayexplosions of stars. From observations alone,
the presence of SNe Ia in elliptical galaxies suggests that they do not come from massive stars.
Many details of the explosion are not yet well understood,but the generally accepted view is that
of a carbon–oxygen, electron-degenerate, nearly Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf orbiting in

a binary system with a close companion (Whelan and Iben 1973). As material from the Roche
lobe of the companion is deposited onto the white dwarf, the pressure and temperature of the
core of the white dwarf increase until explosive burning of carbon and oxygen is triggered. An
alternative model is that of a “double degenerate” system (merger with another white dwarf).

The Distance Scale of the Universe 9
445
Although on observational grounds, there appear to be too few white dwarf pairs, this issue
has not been conclusively resolved. A review of the physical nature of SNe Ia can be found in
Hillebrandt and Niemeyer (2000).
A defining characteristic of observed SNe Ia is the lack of hydrogen and helium in their
spectra. It is presumed that the orbiting companion is transferring hydrogen- and helium-rich
material onto the white dwarf; however, despite extensive searches, this hydrogen or helium
has never been detected, and it remains a mystery as to how such mass transfer could take
place with no visible signature. It is not yet established whether this is a problem of obser-
vational detection or whether these elements are lost from the system before the explosion
occurs.
Various models for SN Ia explosions have been investigated. The most favored model is one
in which a subsonic deflagration flame is ignited, which subsequently results in a supersonic
detonation wave (a delayed detonation). The actual mechanism that triggers an SN Ia explo-
sion is not well understood: successfully initiating a detonation in a CO white dwarf remains
extremely challenging. In recent years, modeling in 3D has begun, given indications from
spectropolarimetry that the explosions are not spherically symmetric. The radiative transport
calculations for exploding white dwarf stars are complex. However, there is general consensus
that the observed (exponential shape of the) light curves of SN e Ia are powered by the radioac-
tive decay of Co to Fe. The range of observed supernova peak brightnesses appears to be
due to a range in Ni produced. However, the origin of the peak magnitude – decline rate – is
still not well understood.
Despite the lack of a solid theoretical understanding of SNe Ia, empirically they remain
one of the best-tested, lowest-dispersion, and highest-precision means of measuring relative
distances out into the smooth Hubble flow.
10
The Extragalactic Distance Scale and the Hubble Constant
We now give a brief discussion of the application of the extragalactic distance scale to measure-
ments of the Hubble constant and its uncertainties. A recent, detailed review of the Hubble
constant can be found in Freedman and Madore (2010). We focus here on recent efforts,
subsequent to that of the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project (Freedman et al. 2001).
A recent calibration of SNe Ia has come from Riess et al. (2009a, b, 2011) from a new calibra-
tion of six Cepheid distances to nearby well-observed supernovae using the Advanced Camera
for Surveys (ACS) and the Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS)
on HST. By extending to the near-infrared, these observations of the newlydiscovered Cepheids
directly address the systematic effects of metallicity and reddening. Riess et al. determine a value
of Ho = 74.2 ± 3.6 km s−Mpc−combining the systematic and statistical errors. This value is in
excellent agreement with that from the Key Project (Freedman et al. 2001), which is calibrated
using the galactic Cepheid parallax sample. At the current time, there is not much need for
larger, low-redshift samples since the dominant remaining uncertainties are systematic rather
than statistical. Recent studies (e.g., Wood-Vasey et al. 2008; Folatelli et al. 2010) confirm that
supernovae are better standard candles at near-infrared (JHK) wavelengths and minimize the
uncertainties due to reddening.
Tammann et al. (2008) also undertook a recent recalibration of supernovae, as well as
a comparison of the Cepheid, RR Lyrae, and TRGB distance scales. In contrast, they find a

446 9
The Distance Scale of the Universe
value of H○= .± .km s−Mpc−, where the quoted (systematic) error includes their
estimated uncertainties in both the Cepheid and TRGB calibration zero points. Their quoted
error is dominated by the systematic uncertainties in the Cepheid zero point and the small
number of supernova calibrators, both of which are estimated by them to be at the 3–4%
level; however, the Ho values differ by more than 2-σ. A discussion of the reason for the dif-
ferences in these analyses can be found in Riess et al. (2009a, b); these include the use of
more heavily reddened galactic Cepheids, the use of less accurate photographic data, and a
calibration involving multiple telescope/instruments for supernovae by Tammann, Sandage,
and Reindl.
A recent and comprehensive review of the application of the SBF method to determin-
ing cosmic distances, and its comparison to the fundamental plane (FP) method is given
in Blakeslee et al. (2002). This analysis leads to the a value of Ho = ± (random) ±
(systematic)km s−Mpc−. Mould and Sakai (2008) have used the TRGB as an alternate
calibration to the Cepheid distance scale for the determination of Ho. They use 14 galaxies for
which TRGB distances can be measured to calibrate the Tully–Fisher relation, and determine a
value of H○= 73 ± 5 (statistical only) km s−Mpc−, a value about 10% higher than found ear-
lier by Sakai et al. (2000) based on a Cepheid calibration of 23 spiral galaxies with Tully–Fisher
measurements. In subsequent papers, they calibrate the SBF method (Mould and Sakai 2009a)
and the FP for early-type galaxies and the luminosity scale of type Ia supernovae (Mould and
Sakai 2009b). They conclude that the TRGB and Cepheid distance scales are all consistent using
SBF, FP, SNe Ia, and the TF relation.
As part of a new Carnegie Hubble Project (CHP), new mid-infrared observa-
tions of Cepheids have been obtained at 3.6 μm using the Spitzer Space Telescope
(Freedman et al. 2012). A mid-IR zero point of the Leavitt Law is obtained using time-
averaged 3.6-μm data for the five longest-period, high-metallicity (Milky Way) Cepheids
having trigonometric parallaxes (Monson et al. 2012). The slope is measured from new time-
averaged, mid-IR data for 82 Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids falling in the period range
0.8 < log(P) < 1.8 (Scowcroft et al. 2011). These data yield a value of H○= 74.3 ± 1.5 (statisti-
cal) ±2.1 (systematic) km/s/Mpc (Freedman et al. 2012). This Spitzer calibration decreases the
systematic uncertainty in H○over that obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project by a
factor of 3.
Mid-infrared observations retire many of the systematic uncertainties in the Cepheid dis-
tance scale, which dominate at optical wavelengths. Specifically, the mid-IR reduces, by a
factor of at least 20, the sensitivity of the Cepheid distance scale to reddening corrections and
assumptions about the universality of the reddening law. The new Spitzer calibration eliminates
instrumental zero-point uncertainties for the Cepheids, as it is based solely on observations
taken using a single, stable detector/telescope combination (the Spitzer IRAC camera). This
calibration is also less sensitive to metallicity effects since it is centered on a high-metallicity
(galactic) zero point. Moreover, the 3.6-μm band is demonstrably less sensitive to the atmo-
spheric metallicity effects seen at shorter wavelengths. The current systematic uncertainty on
the Hubble constant is now dominated by the small number of galactic calibrators having
independent, trigonometric distances. This systematic error will be significantly reduced with
the inclusion of addition Cepheid parallaxes expected to be forthcoming from the Global
Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) mission. In principle, a value of H○hav-
ing a well-tested and robust systematic error budget of only 2% is within reach over the
next decade.

Galaxies in the Cosmological Context 10

Abstract:
In the last decades, a number of observational experiments have converged to estab-
lish the cold dark matter model as the “de facto” standard model for structure formation.
While the cosmological paradigm appears to be firmly established, a theory of galaxy formation
remains elusive, and our understanding of the physical processes that determine the observed
variety of galaxy properties and their evolution as a function of cosmic time and environment is
far from complete. Although much progress has been made, both on the theoretical and obser-
vational side, understanding how galaxies form and evolve remains one of the most outstanding
questions of modern astrophysics. This chapter provides an introduction to ideas and concepts
that underpin modern models of galaxy formation and evolution, in the currently favoured
cosmological context.

Introduction
It was not until the seventeenth century that Galileo discovered that the swathe of light visible
on a dark night from horizon to horizon was not made up of some sort of “celestial fluid” but
was instead composed of myriads of unresolved stars. More and more “patches of light” started
to be observed – nebulae or Island Universes, using the definition given by Immanuel Kant.
A comet hunter – Charles Messier – and a musician who become a skilled maker of the most
powerful telescopes of his time – Wilhelm Herschel – independently produced the first catalogs
of nebulae. The designations introduced by Messier, for basically all the nebulae that can be seen
with small telescopes, are still in use today (e.g., the nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way –
Andromeda – is also known as M31). Despite a Great Debate1 held in 1920 to establish the
nature of these objects, the controversy remained unresolved until 1925 when Edwin Hubble,
using distances estimated from Cepheid variables in M31, provided the definitive demonstra-
tion of their extragalactic nature. Since then, astronomers have made huge progress in the
observation of extragalactic systems and have collected a vast amount of detailed informa-
tion, in different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, for millions of galaxies. Despite
almost one century having passed since the birth of extra-galactic astronomy, and despite much
progress from both the observational and theoretical side having been made, many questions
about the formation and the evolution of galaxies remain unanswered.
How do the nebulae form? And how do they evolve as a function of cosmic time and
environment? The first detailed models for the formation of galaxies were proposed only about
40 years after the confirmation of their extragalactic nature. In their classical paper, Eggen et al.
(1962) analyzed the properties and motion of 221 dwarf stars and showed that those of lower
metallicity tended to move on more highly eccentric orbits. The observed trends were inter-
preted as a signature that the stars that are observed as a spheroidal halo in our galaxy formed
during a rapid radial collapse that later continued to form the stellar disk. This scenario was
later worked out in more detail in early numerical simulations carried out by Larson (1975,
1976). His work showed that, with appropriate choices of the parameters, these dissipative

Although Curtis turned out to be correct as he believed that the nebulae were galaxies external to our own,
Shapley was correct in arguing that our galaxy was larger than previously thought and for showing that our
Sun was not at the center of its galaxy.

collapse models can reproduce the observed basic properties of both elliptical and spiral galax-
ies, provided that the star formation is much slower in proto-spirals than in proto-ellipticals.
The numerical work by Larson, however, also pointed out that if some means of redistribut-
ing angular momentum is not included (e.g., viscosity), these models are unable to obtain the
high-surface brightnesses that are observed in real galaxies. We now know that one of the main
problems with these early studies was that they neglected the presence of dark matter.
The first observational evidence of a missing mass problem dates back to the 1930s, when
Zwicky (1937) estimated that the speeds of galaxies in the Coma cluster are too large to keep
the system gravitationally bound, unless the dynamical mass is at least 100 times larger than
the mass contained in galaxies. The reality of the problem, however, gained a hold upon the
astronomical communityonlyinthe mid-1970s, when different studies showed that the rotation
curves of spiral galaxies are either flat or rising at the optical edge of the galaxies, contrary to
the Keplerian fall off that is expected if the visible stars and gas were the only mass in the system
(Rubin and Ford 1970; Einasto et al. 1974; Ostriker et al. 1974). These observations led to the
conclusion that dark mattermust play an important role in galaxy formation, and motivated the
two-stage theory proposed by White and Rees (1978). In this scenario, dark matter haloes form
first, and the physical properties of galaxies are then determined by cooling and condensation
of gas within the potential well of the haloes. This model contains many of the ideas that are at
the basis of the tools that are nowadays used to study the formation and evolution of galaxies,
and that will be discussed in more detail in this chapter.
In the 1980s, much work focused on the nature of the unseen dark matter component.
Initially, many studies focused on neutrinos as the most likely candidates for the dark matter.
It was soon realized, however, that in a neutrino-dominated universe, structure would form by
fragmentation (top-down), with the largest superclusters forming first in a sort offlat “pancake”-
like sheets (Zeldovich et al. 1982). These must then fragment to form smaller structures like
galaxy groups and galaxies – a picture that conflicts with observation, as shown by detailed
simulations of structure formation (White et al. 1983). During the same years, a number of
different dark matter candidates were provided by particle physics models based on supersym-
metry. These weaklyinteracting massive particles (WIMPS)are todayconsidered the most likely
candidates for dark matter.Because their massesare much larger (and therefore their velocities2
are much smaller) than those of neutrinos, these particles are said to be “cold.” Cold dark mat-
ter (CDM) decouples from the radiation field long before recombination so that its density
fluctuations can grow significantly before the baryons decouple from the radiation. When this
happens, baryons are free to fall in the dark matter potential wells that have formed and that
allow structure formation to occur at a rate sufficient to be consistent with the large-scale struc-
ture observed at present (Davis et al. 1985). The CDM theory has now become the preferred
scenario for galaxy formation and is the framework that will be adopted in this chapter. In a
CDM universe, structure grows hierarchically (bottom-up), with small objects collapsing first
and later merging in a continuous hierarchy to form more and more massive systems.
The aim of this chapteris to provide an introduction to the ideas and concepts that underpin
modern models of galaxy formation and evolution, in a universe in which cosmic structures
originate from small initial perturbations and build up hierarchically through gravitational
instabilities. The layout of this chapter is as follows: >Section 2 provides a brief description
of the cosmological model that is currently accepted as the standard model for structure for-
mation, while >Sect. 3 deals with the physical processes that govern the formation and the

evolution of galaxies. >Section 4 provides a brief review of the numerical techniques that are
currently used to study galaxy formation in a cosmological context and highlights their most
recent successes and open problems. Finally, >Sect. 5 gives some concluding remarks. Due to
space limits, this chapter does not contain a detailed overview of the observational properties of
local and/or distant galaxies. The interested reader is referred to other chapters of this volume,
as well as to the textbooks by, e.g., Binney and Merrifield (1998) and Mo et al. (2010), where
also a more detailed exposition of some of the topics discussed in the following can be found.

The Framework: The Dissipationless Universe
This section provides a brief review of the cosmological framework in which galaxy formation
and evolution take place, focusing on those ingredients that can be considered as the initial
and boundary conditions for any galaxy formation model. For a more rigorous and detailed
exposition of the subject, the reader is referred to classical textbooks by, e.g., Padmanabhan
(1993) and Peacock (1999).
2.1 The Cosmological Model
During the last decade, a variety of observational tests have ushered in a new era of “preci-
sion cosmology” and have converged to establish the CDM model (Peebles 1982; Blumenthal
et al. 1984) as the de facto standard cosmological model for structure formation. In the cur-
rently favored cosmogony (the ΛCDM universe), about 75% of the energy density is due to a
yet unknown form of dark energy that tends to increase the rate of expansion of the universe,
about 21% to a nonbaryonic cold dark matter that has yet to be detected in the laboratory, and
only about 4% is made of baryonic matter out of which stars and galaxies are made. In the past
years, it has been shown that this cosmological model is able to match simultaneously a variety
of observational measurements, among which are the power spectrum of low-redshift galaxies,
the structure that is seen in the Lyman α forest at z ∼, the present acceleration of the cosmic
expansion as inferred from supernovae observations, and the temperature fluctuations in the
cosmic microwave background. By combining these experiments, the parameters of this cos-
mological model are currently known with uncertainties of only a few percent (e.g., Komatsu
et al. 2011), thus effectively removing a large part of the parameter space in galaxy formation
studies.
The initial fluctuations are assumed to follow a Gaussian random distribution and to have
expanded to cosmological scales by inflation3 – a brief period of time during which the scale
factor of the early universe increased exponentially. The dark matter component that has no
pressure undergoes gravitational collapse, which makes the perturbations grow. The early evo-
lution of these perturbations can be accurately described using the linear approximation which
breaks down, however, when the densitycontrast becomes nearlyunity. In the nonlinearregime,
the evolution can be studied analytically if some simplifying assumptions are made (e.g., the
3The inflationary hypothesis was introduced by Guth (1981). While inflation is understood principally by its
detailed predictions of the initial conditions for the hot early universe, the detailed particle physics mechanism
responsible for it is not known.

spherical top-hat model,see, e.g., >Chap. 8 of Padmanabhan) or, more directly and accounting
for the full geometrical complexity of the problem, using cosmological N-body simulations.
For the purposes of modeling galaxy formation, the following information should be avail-
able: (i) the distribution of the dark matter halo masses at any given redshift, (ii) the structural
properties of the dark matter haloes, and (iii) a statistical representation of their assembly
history (that is what in the jargon is called a “merger tree”).
2.2 The Halo and Subhalo Mass Functions
The first calculation of the abundance of gravitationally bound structures was carried out
by Press and Schechter (1974), long before the CDM model was introduced. By assuming a
Gaussian density field smoothed using a spherical top-hat window, and by varying the radius of
the smoothing window, one can consider structures of different mass M = /πρR. The abun-
dance of haloes above a given mass depends on the fraction of spheres for which the density
contrast (this is usually expressed as δ = ρ(x)/¯ρ −) exceeds some critical value δc. A natural
choice for the critical value of the density contrast is provided by the spherical top-hat model
and corresponds to the linearly extrapolated density contrast at which haloes are expected to
virialize (δc ∼.).
Assuming that the probability that δ > δc is the same as the fraction of mass elements that
are contained in haloes with mass larger than M, one obtains

/ρ
M
δc
σ(M) ∣d ln σ

(10.1)
where ρis the mean density of the universe, σ(M) is the fractional root variance in the den-
sity field smoothed using a top-hat filter that contains, on average, a mass M, and δc(t) is the
critical overdensity for spherical top-hat collapse at time t. The Press and Schechter deriva-
tion neglects underdense regions that can be enclosed within larger overdense regions and
that would have a finite probability of being included in a larger collapsed object. To correct
this, Press and Schechter introduced a “fudge factor” equal to 2 in front of the derived expres-
sion (this is included in the equation above) but did not give a proper demonstration of the
correction adopted. An alternative derivation of the halo mass function was given by Bond et al.
(1991), using what is usually referred to as the “excursion set formalism.” A detailed expositionl
of this formalism can be found in White (1994, see also Sect. 7.2 of Mo et al. 2010).
The halo mass function predicted by this simple calculation agrees surprisingly well with
the results obtained from N-body simulations. This is shown in the left panel of >Fig. 10-1.
The colored symbols are results from the Millennium Simulation, which follows the evolution

formula underpredicts the high-mass end of the mass function by up to an order of magnitude,
with the disagreement becoming worse at earliercosmicepochs. Solid lines are predictions from
the fitting formula proposed by Jenkins et al. (2001) that appears to describe results from the
N-body simulation remarkably well, over the redshift and mass range well sampled.
Until the late 1990s, dissipationless simulations suffered from the so-called “overmerging”
problem, i.e., substructures disrupted very quickly within dense environments so that haloes
were smooth and featureless. The problem was initially explained by the lack of dissipation in
N-body simulations (Katz et al. 1992; Summers et al. 1995): it was thought that baryons would

sink into the center of dark matter haloes making them more resilient to disruption by the tidal
field of the parent halo. Both analytic work and high-resolution simulations, however, demon-
strated later that the cores of dark matterhaloes that fall into a larger system can actually survive
as self-gravitating objects orbiting in the smooth dark matter background of the halo, provided
high enough force and mass resolution are used. A wealth of dark matter substructures are now
routinely identified using different techniques (see below). If any, we are now facing the opposite
problem of having “too much” substructure, at least on the galactic scale, where simulations pre-
dict more substructures than visible galaxies by almost two orders of magnitude (see Sect. 4 in
Tasitsiomi 2003). As an example of the performance achievedby numerical N-body simulationsh
in the last years, >Fig. 10-2 reproduces the density map of a 10-year-old high-resolution sim-
ulation of a galaxy cluster in the right panel, and what could be considered the state-of-the-art
numerical simulation on the same scale only about three decades ago in the left panel.
The identification of substructures in dark matter haloes is a difficult technical problem,
and many different algorithms have been developed to accomplish this task in the last years.
Each of these has its own advantages and weaknesses. For example, in the hierarchical friends-
of-friends algorithm (HFOF, Klypin et al. 1999), the linking length4 is reduced in discrete
4The friend-of-friend (FOF, Davis et al. 1985) algorithm is a percolation algorithm that links together all the
particles with a separation less than b times the mean interparticle separation. It has been shown that, with an
appropriate choice of the linking length, it is possible to select groups close to the virial overdensity predicted
by the spherical collapse model.

region of the simulation contains about 66 million particles
steps, thus selecting groups of higher and higher overdensity. The choice of the levels of linking
lengths is somewhat arbitrary, and the algorithm requires an iterative procedure. The bound
density maximum algorithm (BDM, Klypin et al. 1999) iteratively determines a bound subset
of particles in a sphere around a local density maximum. Since this method separates back-
ground particles from particles that are bound to the halo, the BDM algorithm estimates the
physical properties of substructures more accurately. It implicitly assumes, however, that the
halo is spherically symmetric, while the HFOF algorithm can deal with haloes of arbitrary
shapes. Another approach is given by the SKID algorithm (see http ref: http://www-hpcc.astro.
washington.edu/tools) in which the density around each particle is evaluated using a smooth-
ing kernel. The particles are then moved along the density gradients toward a local density
maximum. Particles that end up in the same local maximum are linked together using an FOF
algorithm and then checked for self-boundness.Only self-bound groups with more than a user-
specified minimum number of particles are kept as genuine substructures. An algorithm that
has been frequently used in recent years is, finally, SUBFIND (Springel et al. 2001) which com-
bines ideas used in other group-finding techniques with a topological approach for finding
substructure candidates.
Typically, only about 10% of the total mass of a dark matter halo is found in substructures.
The abundance of relatively massive substructures increases systematically (albeit weakly) with
host halo mass, as shown in the right panel of >Fig. 10-1. This trend reflects the fact that more
massive haloes are both less centrally concentrated and younger (i.e., they assembled later) than
their less massive counterparts. Therefore, they exert weaker tidal forces and have had less time
to disrupt their substructures. As discussed above, different algorithms can be used to identify
dark mattersubstructures, and different criteria for defining the boundaries and membershipof
these substructures are bound to lead to systematic differences. Several recent studies, however,

Galaxies in the Cosmological Context 10
459
find very similar slopes for the subhalo mass function, which suggests that the expected differ-
ences can be probably corrected by simple scale factors (a recent detailed comparison between
different algorithms is given in Knebe et al. 2011).
2.3 Halo Structure
The internal structure of dark matter haloes has been studied extensively using N-body simula-
tions. These show that the density profiles of dark matter haloes are shallower than r−at small
radii and steeper at large radii. The density profile extracted from N-body simulations is well
described by the following equation:
ρ(r) = ρcrit
δchar
(r/rs)(+ r/rs)
(10.2)
where rs is a scale radius and δchar is a characteristic overdensity. The above profile has been
shown to provide a good representation of the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter haloes
of all masses in all CDM-like cosmogonies (Navarro et al. 1997, NFW). In ( > 10.2), the local
logarithmic slope gradually changes from a value of −3 in the outer parts to an asymptotic slope
of −1 in the inner parts. The spatial scale rs of this transition is treated as a fitting parameter
and is often parameterized in terms of the concentration c = rh/rs of the halo, which in fact is
a reparametrization of δchar relative to the critical density:
δchar = Δh

c
ln(+ c) −c/(+ c)
where the limiting radius of a dark matter halo (rh) is defined as the radius within which the
mean matter density is
ρh = Δh ¯ρ = ΔhρcritΩm
and ¯ρ is the mean matter density of the universe at the time considered and ρcrit is the cor-
responding critical density for closure. Different definitions of the radius of a halo can be
found in the literature. The most commonly adopted definition corresponds to R, that is,
the radius that contains a mean overdensity equal to 200 times the critical density at the red-
shift considered. The corresponding enclosed mass is usually referred to as M, and in this
case, Δh = /Ωm.
For a given cosmology, the NFW profile is then completely characterized by the halo mass
and by the concentration parameter c = rh/rs. At any given epoch, less massive haloes are more
concentrated than their more massive counterparts (Neto et al. 2007 and references therein),
a finding that can be interpreted as reflecting the density of the universe at the time of halo
formation. More recent N-body studies (e.g., Navarro et al. 2004) show that the density profiles
of highly resolved simulated haloes deviate from the NFW profile, particularly in the inner
regions, and demonstrate that they are better described by an Einasto (1965) profile:
ρ(r) = ρ−exp[−
α [( r
r−
)
α
−]]
with r−equal to the radius at which the logarithmic slope of the density distribution is equal to
−and ρ−= ρ(r−). The shape parameter of the Einasto profile (α) appears to vary systemat-
ically with halo mass (e.g., Hayashi and White 2008), a result that indicates a (small) deviation
of the mean density profiles from a “universal” shape.

460 10
Galaxies in the Cosmological Context
N-body simulations also show that dark matter haloes have strongly triaxial shapes, with a
slight preference for nearly prolate systems (Jing and Suto 2002; Hayashi et al. 2007), and that
they are supported by nearly isotropic velocity dispersions (Wojtak et al. 2005). Another impor-
tant property of a dark matter halo is its angular momentum, traditionally parameterized as
λ = J E/
G M/
where J, E, and M are the total angular momentum, energy, and mass of the halo, respectively.
Numerical simulations have shown that the distribution of spin parameters for dark matter
haloes is well fit by a log-normal distribution:
p(λ)λ =

√
πσlnλ
exp[−ln(λ/¯λ)
σ 
lnλ
] dλ
λ
with ¯λ ∼.and σlnλ ∼.. The median and width of this distribution appear to depend
weakly on halo mass, redshift, and cosmology (Bett et al. 2007; Macciò et al. 2007).
2.4 Halo Merger Trees
A statistical description of the assembly history of haloes, i.e., a description of the merging
events and of the masses of the haloes involved, can be obtained using a Monte Carlo approach
by sampling the distribution of progenitor masses predicted from the extended Press-Schechter
theory (Lacey and Cole 1993) or by using outputs from N-body simulations. In the jargon, this
is called “merger tree.” Its first schematic representation was presented by Lacey and Cole and
is reproduced in >Fig. 10-3. In the figure, cosmic time increases from top to bottom, and the
widths of the branches reflect the masses of the individual merging haloes.
The excursion set approach of the extended Press-Schechter formalism provides a neat way
to calculate the distribution of halo progenitor masses Mat redshift z, for a halo of mass M
at later redshift z. This can be written as

(σ 

) ]
(10.3)
where σ= σ(M), σ= σ(M), δc= δc(z), δc= δc(z). Repeating the procedure at different
redshifts, and imposing that the mass is conserved so that in each individual realization, the
sum of the progenitor masses is equal to the mass of the parent halo, one can construct merger
trees of haloes of different mass, with arbitrary high resolution. In practice, finding a suitable
algorithm is not trivial, and different methods have been proposed (see Sect. 7.3 of Mo et al.
2010). In general, the Press-Schechter formalism and its Monte Carlo extension capture the
qualitative behavior of all statistics that can be extracted from N-body simulations. However,
recent studies have shown that some discrepancies are found between analytic merger trees and
the corresponding statistics extracted from N-body simulations. The level of this disagreement,
which becomes more important with increasing redshift, can be reduced by empirically tuning
the progenitor distributions, but no theoretical justification exists for the form of the proposed
corrections (Parkinson et al. 2008).
A fundamental assumption that underlies the Monte Carlo approach is that the forma-
tion history of a halo of a given mass does not depend on the “environment.” This assumption

was supported by early numerical work who found no dependence of halo clustering on con-
centration or formation time5 (see, e.g., Lemson and Kauffmann 1999; Percival et al. 2003).
A reanalysis of the same data, however, showed that close pairs of haloes form at slightly higher
redshifts than more widely separated halo pairs, suggesting that haloes in dense regions form
at slightly earlier times than haloes of the same mass in less dense regions (Sheth and Tormen
2004). These results were later confirmed by more recent numerical work that analyzed the
properties of dark matterhaloes in large volumes with high resolution, and found a clear depen-
dency of the clustering amplitude on the halo formation time (Gao et al. 2005). This is illustrated
in >Fig. 10-4 which shows the two-point correlation function6 for haloes in four different mass
ranges (each panel corresponds to a different mass bin, as indicated in the legend) and for the
20% oldest (red lines) and youngest (blue lines) haloes in each mass range. The figure shows
that older haloes are more clustered than their younger counterparts with similar mass and
that the dependence on the formation time is strongest for galactic mass haloes. It should be
noted that these haloes were not well resolved by earlier numerical work that addressed the
same issue.
Strictly speaking, this result invalidates the Monte Carlo approach in terms of using a one-
parameter model (i.e., the halo mass) to construct the merger tree. In addition, as discussed
above, this effect is strongest for haloes similar in mass to that of our Milky Way, which represent
a large fraction of the galaxies in typical observational surveys. Since it is plausible that galaxy

first contains half the final mass.

galaxies at a given relative distance.

properties depend on the assembly history of their haloes, these results suggest that models
that ignore the dependence on the large-scale structure will be in error, although the extent of
the problem does likely depend on the specific galaxy formation model considered. Recent tests
suggest that the effect discussed above influences the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-mass correlation
function by 5–10%, which is within their current statistical uncertainty (Croton et al. 2007). The
trends discussed,however, are likely to play a more important role for studies of extreme objects
that may be thought, for example, to form particularly early or late.
Alternatively, merger trees can be constructed using outputs from N-body simulations.
This is not a trivial task: a discrete number of simulation outputs is available; one may want
to include substructures which complicate significantly the merger tree structure; the mass of
a halo can decrease with time; haloes may spatially overlap at a given time output and there-
fore be blended together by the specific group-finding algorithm employed, then separate at

Galaxies in the Cosmological Context 10

the next time output, and eventually come back together again later on; etc. (for a discussion
of problems commonly encountered when building merger trees from N-body simulations, see
Tweed et al. 2009). The main advantage of using merger trees extracted from simulations to
graft on galaxy formation models is that they can give predictions for the positions of galaxies
within haloes. This allows realistic “mock catalogues” to be constructed which contain not only
the physical properties of all model galaxies (e.g., luminosities, masses, star formation rates)
but also dynamically consistent redshift and spatial information, like in real galaxy redshift sur-
veys. In addition, numerical merger trees are immune to the problem discussed above because
they automatically take into account the dependence of halo clustering on age. On the other
hand, N-body merger trees suffer of a finite mass resolution and of the “technical” problems
mentioned above. Both approaches, extracting the trees directly from an N-body simulation
and growing Monte Carlo trees, have therefore their advantages and weaknesses, and both are
still widely used as input for some classes of galaxy formation models that will be discussed in
more detail in >Sect. 4.
> Figure 10-5 shows the merger tree of a cluster-size halo, extracted from an N-body
simulation. The branch highlighted in green is obtained by connecting the halo at each time
step to the progenitor with the largest mass (the “main” progenitor). The rightmost branches are

present in the FOF group at z = . Circles mark objects that belong to the same FOF group as the

when a halo is accreted onto a bigger system (i.e., becomes a “subhalo”), it loses mass efficiently
due to tidal stripping (De Lucia et al. 2004a; Gao et al. 2004). A nice example of this process is

shown by the halo branch located roughly at the center of >Fig. 10-5. The simulation work men-
tioned above also shows that a significant fraction of the substructures residing in cluster-size
haloes at the present day were accreted at redshifts z ≲and that the infall time and the retained
mass of a subhalo are both strongly increasing functions of clustercentric radius. This implies
that subhaloes in the inner regions of cluster haloes today were generally more massive in the
past than similar mass but more recently accreted subhaloes in the outer regions. This is an
important result to consider when linking the properties of luminous galaxies to those of dark
matter (sub)haloes.

The Physics of Galaxy Formation
So far, this chapter has focused on the formation and evolution of structure under the influence
of gravity alone. In order to make a close link between theoretical modelsof structure formation
and observational data, it is necessary to consider the gas-dynamical and radiative processes
that drive the evolution of the baryonic component of dark matter haloes. These processes are
far more difficult to deal with than gravitational instability, as they cover several orders of mag-
nitude in physical size and timescales, and are intertwined in an entangled network of actions,
back reactions, and self-regulations. This section provides an overview of the main physical pro-
cesses and ingredients that have to be considered when modeling the formation and evolution
of galaxies in the cosmological set discussed in the previous section, highlighting the current
status of observational and numerical studies.
3.1 Gas Accretion
During the linear regime, the density perturbation fields of the baryons and dark matter are
expected to be equal on scales above the Jeans length. After halo formation, hydrodynami-
cal forces come into play, and further collapse of the gaseous component associated with dark
matter haloes is regulated by a combination of gravity, cooling, and hydrodynamical processes.
If the halo virial temperature exceeds the temperature of the accreting gas, then the gas will
accrete supersonically, which will give rise toan accretion shock. Both analyticwork and numer-
ical simulations have early shown that when the cooling times are longer than the dynamical
times, the shock occurs at a radius that is comparable (or slightly larger than) the virial radius
(Bertschinger 1985; Evrard 1990). In reality, the accreting gas is not smooth but lumpy so that
there is no well-defined accretion shock but rather a complex network of shocks. These heat the
gas by thermalizing its kinetic energy up to the virial temperature of the halo. For an isothermal
sphere, this can be written as
Tvir = μmp
kB
V 
c ≃.× K (
Vc
km s−)

where mp is the proton mass and μ is the mean molecular weight of the gas. This gas will form
a hydrostatically supported atmosphere which will obey the hydrostatic equilibrium equation:
dP
dr = d(kBTρ/μmp)
dr
= −ρ(r)dΦ
dr = −ρ(r)GM(r)
r

Galaxies in the Cosmological Context 10

where P is the gas pressure, ρ(r) the gas density, and M(r) the total (i.e., dark matter plus
baryonic) masswithin the radius r. This gas will then cool radiatively and eventually lose energy
and, consequently, pressure support. At this point, the gas will fall toward the center of the
gravitational potential provided by the dark matter halo, conserving its angular momentum
and settling in a denser gas disk.
In the regime where the cooling times are much shorter than the dynamical times, the shock
forms at much smaller radii, close to the forming galaxy. The gas is still heated to very high tem-
peratures (actually larger than in the slow cooling regime because the preshock velocity of the
infalling gas will be larger than in this case of a virial shock) but will cool so rapidly that it
cannot maintain the pressure needed to support a quasistatic hot atmosphere. The distinction
between these “rapid” and “slow” cooling regimes was clearly understood when the first hier-
archical galaxy formation models were presented (Rees and Ostriker 1977; Binney 1977; White
and Frenk 1991). This picture has been validated by 1D hydrodynamical simulations (Birnboim
and Dekel 2003, see also unpublished work by Forcada-Miro and White 1997) and by more
recent 3D hydrodynamical simulations (Kereš et al. 2005; Ocvirk et al. 2008) that show that
most of the accretion on haloes with mass ≲M⊙tend to be directed along filaments, and is
often referred to as “cold accretion.” As Croton et al. (2006) have stressed and as noted above, the
term cold accretion is a misnomer. In fact, what differentiates mainly the two modes of accre-
tion is not the temperature to which infalling gas is shocked but rather the time spent by the gas
at the postshock temperature before its energy is radiated away. It is worth noting that the tran-
sition mass between the rapid and slow cooling regimes found in the most recent simulations is
very close to that identified in early analytical work (see discussion in Benson and Bower 2011).
Finally, it should be noted that the rates computed in simulations often correspond to accretion
rate onto the haloes and that these are different from the accretion rates onto the galaxies. The
latter can be strongly affected by metal line cooling and by feedback from supernovae and/or
active galactic nuclei (Benson and Bower 2011; van de Voort et al. 2011).
3.2 Gas Cooling
The primary cooling processes relevant for structure formation are two-body radiative pro-
cesses. A gas with primordial composition (only hydrogen and helium) is almost entirely
ionized at temperatures above K, while a gas of nonzero metallicity is fully ionized at
temperatures above a few K. At these high temperatures, the cooling is dominated by the
bremsstrahlung continuum due to the deceleration of electrons as they encounter atomic nuclei.
At lower temperatures (i.e., K < T < K), collisional ionization, recombination, and col-
lisional excitation become important. At even lower temperatures (T < K), most of the
electrons have recombined so that atomic cooling is very inefficient. Cooling can still take place
(albeit at very low rates) if the gas is enriched, but the dominant cooling in this regime is given
by the excitation (through collisions) of rotational or vibrational energy levels of molecular
hydrogen (or of other molecules if present) and subsequent decay. Since the dominant cooling
processes are two-body processes, one can write the cooling rate per unit volume as
L = n
HΛ(T, Z)
where nH is the number density of hydrogen (both neutral and ionized) and Λ(T, Z) is the
cooling function that, as explained above, will depend (strongly) both on the temperature and
on the chemical composition of the gas.

of the halo is indicated on the top axis. The diﬀerent curves show how the cooling rate depends
upon the metallicity of the gas, as indicated by the legend
>Figure 10-6 shows how the cooling rate varies as a function of the temperature of the hot
halo gas and how it depends upon the chemical composition of the gas. Cooling is dominated
by bremsstrahlung at the high temperature end, where Λ ∝T/. The peaks in the primordial
cooling function at ∼15,000 K and ∼K are due to the collisionally excited electronic levels of
hydrogen and singly ionized helium, respectively. For an enriched gas, cooling is significantly
enhanced at temperatures ≳K due to the collisionally excited levels of ions of oxygen, car-
bon, nitrogen, etc. Above ∼K, other metal lines contribute significantly, in particular neon,
iron, and silicon. The cooling functions shown in >Fig. 10-6 are based on model results from
Sutherland and Dopita (1993) and assume ionization equilibrium, i.e., that the densities of all
ions are equal to their equilibrium values. This approximation is correct if the time scales of
the radiative processes are much shorter than the hydrodynamical time scales of the gas, which
might not be the case in shocks or in the case of a very dilute gas (where reaction rates are low).
In these cases, a more appropriate treatment requires cooling rates to be recomputed using
nonequilibrium densities.
At high redshifts, an additional cooling channel has to be taken into account: inverse Comp-
ton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by electrons in the ionized plasma
inside dark matter halos. This channel is effective if the temperature of the plasma exceeds that
of the microwave background Tγ ≈.(+ z) K. It can be shown that
tCompton

where tage is the age of the universe at redshift z. For Ωm = .and h = ., one obtains
tCompton/tage
= at z
∼. So Compton cooling against the cosmic microwave back-
ground becomes important only at z ≳. The cooling rate per unit mass associated with
Compton cooling is proportional to the electron temperature and independent on the gas den-
sity (see Sect. 8.1.2 of Mo et al. 2010). So, assuming an isothermal distribution and a constant
electron fraction, gas that is able to cool via this process will do so at all radii.
In a spherically symmetric gaseous system, a local cooling time can be defined dividing the
thermal energy density of the gas by the cooling rate per unit volume:
tcool(r) = 

kTρg(r)
¯μmpne(r)Λ(T, Z)
where ne(r) is the electron density and ρg(r) is the gas density at a radius r. A simple estimate of
the instantaneous cooling rate onto the central object can be obtained by following the method
proposed by White and Frenk (1991): a cooling radius, rcool, can be defined as the radius at
which the local cooling time is equal to a suitably defined age for the halo, e.g., the Hubble time.
At early times and for low-mass haloes, the cooling radius can be larger than the virial radius.
In this case, the hot gas is never expected to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, and the cooling rate
is essentially limited by the accretion rate (the halo is in the rapid cooling regime discussed
above). At late times and in massive systems, the cooling radius lies within the virial radius,
and the gas can be assumed to cool quasistatically with a cooling rate that can be modeled by a
simple inflow equation (this is the slow cooling regime):
dMcool
dt
= πρg(rcool)r
cool
drcool
dt
The cooling model just described is extremely simplified and does not account, for example, for
the fact that the gas distribution can readjust itself once gas starts to cool out (Viola et al. 2008).
Nevertheless, it has been shown to provide results that are statistically in relatively good agree-
ment with more detailed hydrodynamical simulations that adopt the same physics (e.g., Benson
et al. 2001; Yoshida et al. 2002, but see also Saro et al. 2010). A number of assumptions need
to be made, however, to implement the above simple prescriptions in analytic models of galaxy
formation (e.g., about the gas profile and for the calculation of the cooling radius). Recent work
has shown that the different assumptions adopted can give rise to significant differences, in
particular at scales larger than those typical of our own galaxy (De Lucia et al. 2010).
3.3 Star Formation
It is generally accepted that the rate at which galaxies can form stars is determined by its abil-
ity to form dense molecular clouds. This is supported by direct observations of associations of
young stars in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies, as well as by observations of CO emis-
sion from starburst galaxies. From the theoretical point of view, that of star formation remains a
poorly understood mechanism where processes like turbulence, magnetic fields, dust, molecu-
lar cooling, etc., all play an important role (a recent review can be found in McKee and Ostriker
2007). In terms of building a galaxy formation model, it is important to understand: (i) where
and when the first generation of stars formed and their properties, (ii) the rate at which stars
form in disks and starbursts, and (iii) the distribution of stellar masses produced in episodes of
star formation.

3.3.1 The First Generation of Stars
If we believe that the structures in the universe grew hierarchically, the first objects that became
nonlinear are expected to have masses much smaller than those of typical galaxies. The first
generation of stars is expected to be extremely metal poor, because heavy elements can only be
produced in the interior of stars. These stars are referred to as Population III stars. In a CDM
model, the virial temperature of a halo is related to its mass through the following equation:
Tvir ∼Ω/
m (
M
h−M⊙
)
/
(+ zvir

) K
where it has been assumedthat the average density of dark matterhaloes is 200 times the critical
density, H(z) = HΩ/
m (+ z)/for z >> , and zvir is the assembly redshift of the halo.
At z ≳, Compton scattering plays an important role, and the temperature of the intergalactic
medium is
Tgas = Tγ = .(+ z) K
where Tγ is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. At these redshifts, only
haloes with M ≳M⊙can trap significant amount of baryonic gas. At lower redshift, the tem-
perature of the intergalactic medium decreases faster than that of the microwave background,
and lower mass haloes start trapping baryonic gas. The gas that is trapped will eventually be
heated to the virial temperature of the parent haloes by shocks. If this gas can cool, it will
condense and eventually fragment allowing the formation of stars in these early haloes.
As discussed in the previous section, at temperatureslower than ∼K, the only significant
cooling is due to molecular hydrogen, so the chemistry of this molecule governs the formation
of the first objects. > Figure 10-7 shows the minimum mass of haloes within which Hcool-
ing is sufficiently effective to lead to gas collapse (for a more rigorous exposition, see Ciardi
and Ferrara 2005 and references therein). This minimum halo mass turns out to be between
M⊙at z ≳and M⊙at lower redshift. In a CDM universe, haloes in this mass range
start forming in large numbers only at z ≲. Significant uncertainties are involved in the
discussion outlined above. For example, the presence of UV photons can dissociate hydro-
gen molecules and therefore suppress significantly the cooling efficiency. On the other hand,
induced formation of hydrogen molecules behind shocks driven by the first stars can out-
weigh its photodissociation. In addition, once star formation begins, mechanical and radiative
feedback from the first stars can remove a large fraction of the remaining halo gas.
Because of the very low metallicities, the cooling time of the gas may be significantly longer
than the time scale of the gravitational collapse so that the cloud may not be able to fragment.
First simulations of this initial collapse phase have confirmed this scenario and concluded that
the first stars formed in isolation and were very massive (of the order of 60–100 M⊙but with
large uncertainties, see, e.g., Abel et al. 2002; Yoshida et al. 2006). More recent numerical studies
have shown that metal-free gas clouds can fragment strongly, with the details of the process
depending on the degree of turbulence in the halo. As a consequence, the mass spectrum of Pop
III stars might be relatively flat ranging from ∼0.1 to ∼M⊙(Clark et al. 2011; Greif et al. 2011).
3.3.2 A Star Formation Law
The problems relatedto the formation of the first stars propagate into galaxy formation theory if
we wish to understand the rate at which stars form in these systems and any consequences that

diﬀerent values of the rate of ionizing photon production by ultra-high energy cosmic rays
star formation might have for further evolution. Our limited understanding of the physical pro-
cesses involved prevents us from constructing a “star formation law” from first principles that
describes how the star formation rate Σstar dependson the physical conditions of the interstellar
medium. In order to make progress, one can appeal to empirical laws. A power-law relation of
the form
Σstar ∝ΣN
gas
(10.4)
has been known since a long time (Schmidt 1959) and has been shown to provide a very good
parametrization of the global star formation rate over a large range of surface densities, from
the gas-poor spiral disks to the cores of the most luminous starburst galaxies (Kennicutt 1998).
The best-fit observational data is

where Σgas = ΣHI + ΣHis obtained averaging over the entire star-forming disk. Recently, it has
become possible to study the star formation law by fitting Schmidt laws to individual galaxies
for which Σgas and Σstar are measured in azimuthally averaged rings or even on a pixel-by-pixel
basis. > Figure 10-8 is based on a recent study by Bigiel et al. 2008 and shows the local star
formation rate per unit area measured on a scale of ∼750 pc as a function of the local atomic gas
density (left panel), molecular gas density (middle panel), and total gas density (right panel).
The atomic hydrogen distribution saturates at about 10 M⊙pc−, and the figure shows that it

level of star formation needed to consume 1%, 10%, and 100% of the gas in 108 years. The dashed
vertical lines in the left and right panels indicate the surface density at which HI saturates
poorly correlates with the star formation rate measured. Gas in excess of this value is predom-
inantly molecular, and the middle panel of >Fig. 10-8 shows that there is a well-defined law
for this gas component, which is well described by a power law with slope N ∼. This implies
a constant molecular hydrogen depletion time of ∼2 Gyr. As argued in Bigiel et al. (2008), the
star formation law can be interpreted as a combination of two laws that regulate the conversion
of atomic to molecular hydrogen and the formation of stars from molecular gas, respectively.
Variants of > 10.4 are commonly adopted in galaxy formation models where the formation of
molecular gas is not usually followed explicitly. While this allows us to bypass the question of
how stars form, it should be noted that such an empirical relation is then applied also beyond
the regimes where it has been originally measured.
3.3.3 The Initial Mass Function
Galaxy properties depend not only on the rate and efficiency of star formation but also on the
mass spectrum with which stars form, that is, the initial mass function (IMF). Observational
results for our Milky Way suggest that the IMF has roughly the same form, independent of
the location in the galaxy. The first determination of the IMF in the solar neighborhood was
obtained by Salpeter (1955) who found that it is well described by a power law:
ϕ(m)dm ∝m−bdm
with b = ., for stars in the mass range 0.4 M⊙≲m ≲M⊙. ϕ(m)dm provides the relative
number of stars born with masses in the range m ± dm/. Different measurements have been

Galaxies in the Cosmological Context 10
471
made more recently, and they suggest that the IMF deviates from a pure power law, becoming
flatter at the lowest mass end and steeper at the highest mass end. All subsequent determi-
nations do not deviate significantly from the Salpeter IMF for masses ≳M⊙, while for lower
masses,there are significant differences among different determinations. One of the most recent
measurements that is widely used in current years has been made by Chabrier (2003):
ξ(m) ∝{ m−.for m > M⊙
exp(−[log(m/.M⊙)]/.) for m < M⊙
where ξ(m) is the logarithmic IMF and is defined as ξ(m)dlogm = ϕ(m)dm.
The question of the “universality” of the IMF is a heavily debated one, particularly in recent
years. From the observational point of view, there are large uncertainties, and only a small num-
ber of local star-forming clouds can be studied in detail (for a critical review of observational
measurements,see Bastian et al. 2010). From the theoretical point of view, it is worth reminding
that the ability of a gas cloud to collapse and fragment depends on the local Jeans mass:
MJ ≃M⊙(T/K)/(n/cm−)
−/(μ/)−,
where T, n, and μ are the temperature, number density, and mean molecular weight at the
halt of fragmentation. For gas of primordial composition, a minimum temperature of ∼200 K
is reached when molecular hydrogen cooling becomes inefficient. This gives a Jeans mass
MJ ≃10 M⊙. If metals are present, cooling can proceed to lower temperatures allowing the
collapsing gas cloud to undergo fragmentation and form smaller clumps. The IMF can there-
fore depend onthe metallicity: the hydrodynamical simulations bySmith and Sigurdsson(2007)
show that above a critical metallicity, of about −Z⊙, clouds can fragment to form low-mass
stars, while for gas of lower metallicities, stars form following a more top-heavy IMF. The crit-
ical metallicity defined above is well below that of the observed galaxies and, therefore, this
effect might not be significant for galaxy formation studies. Further work is, however, needed
to clarify if the IMF depends on the metallicity also above this critical value.
3.4 Feedback
The importance and the need of physical mechanisms that are able to modulate the efficiency of
galaxy formation as a function of halo mass was recognized early on: Larson (1975, 1976) noted
that supernovae-driven winds could remove most of the gas and heavy elementsfrom low-mass
galaxies. White and Rees (1978) argued that feedback is required to explain the overall low effi-
ciency of galaxy formation. If dark matter haloes represent the birthplaces of luminous galaxies,
evidence for the need of feedback comes from the observation that the shape of the halo mass
function is very different from the shape of the observed luminosity function of galaxies. Thus, a
simple model that assumes a fixed mass-to-light ratio would overpredict by order of magnitudes
both the number of faint galaxies and that of bright ones (see left panel of >Fig. 10-9). By match-
ing the observed galaxy groups to dark matter haloes that are predicted to have the same space
density, it is possible to derive the mass-to-light ratio that guarantees a match between theo-
retical predictions and the observed luminosity function (see right panel of >Fig. 10-9). The
required mass-to-light ratio is lowest for haloes of mass ∼M⊙which are, in other words,
those in which galaxy formation is most efficient. In addition, this simple exercise confirms
that the overall efficiency of galaxy formation must be low since most baryons do not end up as
stars.

We now know that feedback processes are those that have arguably the strongest influence
on the observed galaxy properties but also those that are the most difficult to model. Broadly
speaking, galaxy formation models consider three different forms of feedback: photoionization
heating, supernovae feedback, and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The first two
are believed to play an important role in shaping the faint end of the luminosity function, while
the latter is believed to play a crucial role in regulating the condensation of gas in relatively
massive haloes, thereby reducing the number of bright galaxies that would be predicted in the
simple model outlined above. The following sections describe in more details these three modes
of feedback and comment on recent theoretical results.
3.4.1 Photoionization Heating
It is believed that the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium must have been reionized some-
where between z ∼and z ∼. Although it remains uncertain which energy sources
were responsible for reionization, it was soon realized that the photoionizing background
responsible for reionizing the intergalactic medium may also act to inhibit galaxy formation.
In particular, this process acts in two different ways: (i) it heats the gas increasing its ther-
mal pressure and therefore inhibiting its accretion onto dark matter haloes, and (ii) it also
heats the gas that has already collapsed in haloes, therefore reducing the abundance of neu-
tral atoms which can be collisionally excited, which in turn reduces the rate of radiative cooling
of gas inside haloes (Doroshkevich et al. 1967; Efstathiou 1992). Both these mechanisms can
effectively suppress galaxy formation in small haloes. > Figure 10-10 shows examples of net

heating/cooling functions in the presence ofa photoionizing background. These were calculated
coupling the photoionization background computed self-consistently from a galaxy formation
model with a photoionization code (for details, see Benson et al. 2002) and are computed for
the typical densities of gas at each redshift indicated in the legend. The figure shows that pho-
toionization can significantly suppress cooling in haloes with virial temperature in the range
–K and therefore inhibit the formation of low-mass galaxies.
The value of the characteristic mass, Mc, below which galaxies are strongly affected by pho-
toionization was calculated by Gnedin (2000) who argued that Mc = MF, i.e., the filtering mass
that corresponds to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are smoothed in linear per-
turbation theory. This relation has often been used in galaxy formation models to explain the
low number of satellites observed in the Local Group. Recent numerical work has shown that
the fitting function provided by Gnedin overestimates the characteristic mass by large factors
(Okamoto et al. 2008).
3.4.2 Supernovae Feedback
The mechanical energy supplied by massive stars in the form of supernovae and stellar winds
represents the engine that drives the galactic-scale outflows that are observed in the most
actively star-forming galaxies both in the local universe and at high redshift. Observations
suggest that outflows are ubiquitous in galaxies in which the global star formation rate per

474 10
Galaxies in the Cosmological Context
unit area exceeds roughly −M⊙year−kpc−and that the material is multiphase contain-
ing cold, warm, and hot gas, plus dust and magnetized relativistic plasma. Different techniques
and datasets can be used to estimate the mass and energy outflow rates. The available data sug-
gest that the outflow rates are comparable to the star formation rates and that radiative losses in
superwinds are not significant (Heckman 2002, and references therein). The estimated outflow
speeds can be significant (in the range from hundreds to thousands km s−), and recent studies
suggest that there is a weak trend with the galaxy star formation rate (Weiner et al. 2009, see
also Martin 2005). This trend seems to support a picture in which winds are momentum driven
through radiation pressure (Murray et al. 2005) rather than by the kinetic energy of supernova
ejecta by entrainment in the hot wind (Strickland and Stevens 2000, and references therein).
Unfortunately, the observational measurements available refer to material that is still relatively
deep within the gravitational potential of the halo. So the estimated outflow rates are difficult to
translate into rates at which mass, metals, and energy escape from galaxies and are eventually
transported into the intergalactic medium. The fate of the winds (or superwinds depending on
their velocity) will depend critically on a number of unknowns and on the multiphase nature
of the outflowing material.
The dynamical evolution of a starburst-driven outflow has been studied using hydrody-
namical simulations. The deposition of mechanical energy by supernovae and stellar winds
creates an overpressured cavity of hot gas inside the starburst. This cavity expands, sweeping
up ambient material and developing a bubble-like structure. If the ambient medium is strati-
fied (like in a disk), the bubble expands most rapidly in the direction of the vertical pressure
gradient. Numerical simulations show that when the bubble size reaches several disk verti-
cal scale heights, it is fragmented because of Raleigh-Taylor instabilities which allow the hot
gas to blow out of the disk into the halo in a weakly collimated bipolar outflow (a “wind”).
>Figure 10-11 shows snapshots of the density distribution for models of galaxies with differ-
ent initial masses and mechanical luminosities (as indicated in the legend). These simulations,
carried out by Mac Low and Ferrara (1999), also showed that it is relatively difficult for
supernovae-driven outflows to remove the gas from low-mass galaxies, while they appear to
be fairly efficient at ejecting metals. This “metal loading” effect is just another manifestation
of the importance of the multiphase nature of the outflow material and is often neglected in
models of galaxy formation.
As mentioned above, supernovae feedback is believed to play a very important role in regu-
lating the number of faint galaxies (Benson et al. 2003) but also in shaping the mass-metallicity
relation that is observed for star-forming galaxies (Tremonti et al. 2004) and in enriching the
intergalactic and intraclustermedium(De Lucia et al. 2004b). Given the uncertainties discussed
above, this process is included in galaxy formation models using a number of different prescrip-
tions that are based on observations and/or theoretical arguments. Currently, it is difficult to
argue that one specific model is and/or works better than another.
3.4.3 AGN Feedback
AGN can release huge amounts of energy during their lifetimes. Assuming an energy conver-
sion efficiency of єcper unit of accreted mass, one finds that an accreting black hole liberates
∼(є/.) erg per gram, and it is easy to compute that this energy input can easily exceed the
binding energy of the host galaxy (Begelman 2004). Broadly speaking, there are two different
forms of feedback.

The photons generated by AGN can ionize and heat the surrounding gas. If the host galaxy
contains significant amounts of dust, the radiation pressure on the dust grains can overcome
the gravitational force of the halo, generating a momentum-driven wind (Murray et al. 2005).
This is a “radiative” feedback mode, and in the literature, it is sometimes referred to as “quasar
mode.” This energy injection mechanism is effective in broad-line quasars for which the pres-
ence of high velocity winds has been confirmed in a number of cases. Galaxy formation models
incorporate this energy injection channel in mergers of gas-rich galaxies that can funnel copi-
ous amounts of cold gas toward the central regions of galaxies and feed the central black holes
with high gas accretion rates. This particular form of feedback is therefore believedto be impor-
tant at higher redshift where the activity of quasars peaks. Numerical simulations show that it
can affect significantly the physical properties of the host galaxy, by expelling large amounts of
gas and therefore suppressing significantly subsequent star formation (Springel et al. 2005a).
When the accretion rate onto the central black hole is low, AGN can drive highly collimated
and powerful jets which can reach out well into the surrounding halo. This is a “mechanical”
feedback mode, sometimes referred to as “radio mode.” Evidence for this form of feedback can

be seen in the central regions of galaxy clusters: X-ray observations show that these often con-
tain cavities that are filled with relativistic gas and are believed to be inflated by the jet launched
from the central black hole. > Figure 10-12 shows, for example, an X-ray image (adaptively
smoothed) of the central region of the Perseus cluster that contains a bright radio source at
its center. It has long been realized that this form of feedback can provide a solution to the
“cooling flow” problem, i.e., the observation that the gas at the center of most galaxy clus-
ters is apparently not condensing and turning into stars, although the observed X-ray emission
implies a cooling time that is much shorter than the age of the system (Tabor and Binney 1993).
The ensemble-averaged power from radio galaxies seems sufficient to offset the mean level of
cooling, and a large fraction of central clustergalaxies are radio loud (Best et al. 2007). The steep
dependence of the radiative cooling function on density makes, however, difficult to stabilize
cooling flows so that heating approximately balances cooling at all radii. Numerical simulations
show that the efficiency of this feedback in suppressing gas condensation depends strongly on a
number of unknown parameters, e.g., the duty cycle (i.e., the frequency of the energy injection),
the geometry, and gas viscosity (e.g., Sijacki and Springel 2006).
In addition to the two modes of AGN feedback described above, significant outputs of
energetic particles (cosmic rays) or exotic particles consisting, for example, of relativistic neu-
trons and neutrinos can contribute to inject energy into the surrounding gas. The precise
composition of the bubbles, in these terms is, however, not well known, both from an observa-
tional and a theoretical point of view. Thus, it is currently unclear if the energy released via this
channel is significant.

3.5 Chemical Enrichment
As explained above, the first generation of stars (the Pop III stars) formed from gas with
primordial composition. Stellar nucleosynthesis and the subsequent pollution of the inter-
stellar and intergalactic medium (through, for example, supernovae-driven winds) affect the
formation of later stellar populations. In particular, the presence of heavy elements increases
significantly the rate at which gas can cool and affects the luminosity and colors of the stellar
populations. In addition, star formation also leads to the formation of dust which attenuatesthe
optical and ultraviolet light of galaxies and re-emits at longer wavelengths.
The final stages of stellar evolution and metal production depend on the stellar mass. Stars
with masses ≲M⊙end up their life as C/O white dwarfs, after an asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) phase during which the star is burning helium in an inner shell and hydrogen in an
outer shell. Unfortunately, there are still large theoretical uncertainties in the treatment of con-
vection and mass loss from AGB stars. If the C/O white dwarf is part of a close binary system,
it can accrete material from the companion. When the star reaches the Chandrasekhar limit
(1.4 M⊙), it explodes as supernovae type Ia which dominate the production of elements in the
iron peak. Massive stars (with masses ≳M⊙) enrich the interstellar medium with metals via
both stellar winds and their final explosions as core-collapse supernovae (type II SNe). These
are primarily responsible for the production of α elements (among which oxygen, magnesium,
silicon, calcium) but also of other elements like nitrogen and sodium. Since the progenitors
of type II SNe are massive stars with lifetimes shorter than ∼year, while the progenitors of
type Ia SNe are less massive stars with lifetimes ≳year, the relative proportions of the metal
species they contribute (often quantified in the [α/Fe] ratio) provide information on the time
scale of star formation. So studying the metallicity and [α/Fe] ratio of galaxies, it is possible to
constrain the time scale over which star formation took place. The only complication is given
by the fact that the [α/Fe] ratio does not depend only on the star formation history but also on
the shape of the IMF.
In the framework of galaxy formation models, chemical evolution has often been (and still
largely is) included using the instantaneous recycling approximation (i.e., the models neglect
the finite lifetime of stars so that both chemical enrichment and gas recycling are assumed to
take place at the same time of star formation) and a constant yield that is usually treated as a free
parameter. More recent studies have included a more accurate treatment of type Ia supernovae
and are able to follow the evolution of individual elements (e.g., Nagashimaet al. 2005; Arrigoni
et al. 2010).
3.6 Galaxy-Galaxy Interactions
In the hierarchical scenario, dark matter haloes (and therefore the galaxies that reside in them)
undergo frequent interactions with each other. These interactions have dramatic influence on
the morphologies and star formation histories of the galaxies involved. Numerical simulations
have shown that close interactions can lead to a strong internal dynamical response driving
the formation of spiral arms and, depending on the structural properties of the disks, of strong
bar modes. The developing nonaxisymmetric structures (spiral arms and/or central bars) lead
to a compression of the gas that can fuel starburst/AGN activity (see Mihos 2004, and ref-
erences therein). Simulations have also shown that in sufficiently close encounters between

478 10
Galaxies in the Cosmological Context
galaxies of similar mass, violent relaxation completely destroys the disk and leaves a kinemat-
ically hot remnant with photometric and structural properties that resemble those of elliptical
galaxies.
The merger hypothesis for the formation of elliptical galaxies was suggested early on by
Toomre and Toomre (1972) and later confirmed by many numerical simulations (Mihos 2004;
Cox et al. 2008, and references therein). In recent years, a large body of observational evidence
has been collected that demonstrates that a relatively large fraction of early-type systems show
clear evidence of interactions, mergers, and recent star formation, in particular at high red-
shift. However, the data also seem to indicate that only a small fraction of the final mass is
involved in these episodes. This observational result has often been interpreted as strong evi-
dence against the somewhat extended starformation historynaivelypredicted from hierarchical
models. A related issue concerns the α-element enhancements observed in elliptical galaxies.
As explained above, the [α/Fe] ratio is believed to encode important information on the time
scale of star formation, and it is a well-established result that massive ellipticals have supersolar
[α/Fe] ratios, suggesting that they formed on relatively short time scales and/or have an initial
mass function that is skewed toward massive stars. The inability of early models of the hier-
archical merger paradigm to reproduce this observed trend has been pointed out as a serious
problem for these models (Thomas 1999).
In order to model galaxy interactions and mergers, one needs to know what determines the
structural and physical properties of a merger remnant. Numerical simulations have shown that
these depend mainly on the following two factors:
1. The progenitor mass ratio. As mentioned above, during “major” mergers, violent relaxation
plays an important role, and as a consequence, the merger remnant has little resemblance to
its progenitors. On the other hand, during minor mergers, the interaction is less destructive
so that the merger remnant often resembles its most massive progenitor. The exact value
at which one distinguishes between minor and major mergers is somewhat arbitrary but is
usually chosen to be of the order of M/M∼..
2. The physical properties of the progenitors. The structure of the galaxies involved in a merger
plays an important role in determining the response to interactions: disks that are stable
against the growth of instabilities (e.g., because of a central bulge or a lowered disk surface
density) will be less “damaged” than disk-dominated systems that are prone to strong insta-
bilities. In addition, in a merger between two gas-rich progenitors, a significant fraction of
the gas content can be fuelled toward the center, triggering a starburst and/or accretion of
gas onto the central black hole. Merger-driven starbursts are instead suppressed if the two
merging systems are gas poor. These purely stellar mergers are often referred to as a “dry”
or “red,” and as will be discussed below, they are believed to contribute significantly to the
recent assembly of elliptical galaxies.
> Figures 10-13 and >10-14 show the projected stellar and gas mass density, respectively,
during a merger with baryonic mass ratio 2.3:1. The figures show that the satellite galaxy
first makes a fast, direct approach toward the primary galaxy. The tidal interaction between
the two merging disks generates symmetric tails in both of them. Due to the initial orbital
energy, the two galaxies separate again for several orbital periods (∼1 Gyr in the particular
case shown) before getting closer again. After the first or second passage, the initial angu-
lar momentum is lost, and the orbit becomes almost entirely radial. This limits the coupling
between orbital and spin angular momentum and therefore the tidal response during the final
coalescence.

The time scales of the galaxy mergers depend significantly on the orbital parameters that,
to some extent, also affect the structural properties of the remnant. For example, the relative
orientation of the orbital spin with respect to the intrinsic spin of the progenitors influences sig-
nificantly the prominence of tidal tails. A good approximation of the merging times of galaxies
is provided by the classical Chandrasekhar (1943) dynamical friction formula:
d
dt ⃗vorb = −πGln(Λ) Msat ρhost(< vorb) ⃗vorb
v
orb
,
where ρhost(<vorb) is the density of background particles with velocities less than the orbital
velocity vorb of the satellite, Msat is the mass of the satellite,and Λ is the Coulomb logarithm that
depends on the mass ratio between the two merging galaxies. The formula given above, that is
valid in the approximation ofa point mass satellite and a uniform background mass distribution,
is often adopted in analytic models of galaxy formation to estimatethe time scale for an orbiting
satellite to lose its energy and angular momentum and merge with the central galaxy of its
host halo. Recent work has, however, shown that the classical dynamical friction formula tends
to underestimate merging times computed from controlled numerical experiments and high-
resolution cosmological simulations (e.g., Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2008). In addition, it should
be noted that different models usually assume different variations of the classical formula (e.g.,
adopt a different “fudge” factor and/or a different expression for the Coulomb logarithm) that
can lead to significant differences in the estimated merger times (see Sect. 8 and Fig. 14 in De
Lucia et al. 2010).
3.7 The Environment
The distribution of galaxies on the sky is not uniform: galaxies appear to be arranged in a com-
plex web of filaments and sheets that surround empty “voids” and intersect in dense nodes that
can contain up to thousands galaxies, the rich clusters of galaxies. It has been known for a long
time that the local and large-scale environments play an important role in determining many
galaxy properties. First indications of a correlation between the galaxy type and the environ-
ment can be found in the The Realm of Nebulae by E. Hubble (1936), but the milestone paper in
the subject is probably the work by Dressler (1980), who showed the existence of a well-defined
relationship between local galaxy density and galaxy type for a sample of ∼20 massive nearby
clusters.
Disentangling the processes responsible for the observed correlations has proved difficult,
and it remains unclear whether the observed relations are imprinted during formation or by
physical processes at work preferentially in dense environments. The difficulty is in part intrin-
sic: according to the current paradigm for structure formation, dark matter collapses into haloes
in a bottom-up fashion. Small systems form first and subsequently merge to form progressively
larger systems. As structure grows, galaxies join more and more massive systems, therefore
experiencing different “environments” during their lifetimes. In this context, it is clear that both
“heredity” (i.e., the initial conditions) and “environment” (i.e., subsequent physical processes
that galaxies experience during their lifetimes) do play a role in shaping the observed galaxy
properties and in determining the observed environmental trends.
A number of different physical mechanisms have been early identified that can influence
significantly the physical properties of galaxies in a clusterenvironment. Broadly speaking, they
can be grouped in two big families: (i) interactions with other cluster members and with the

482 10
Galaxies in the Cosmological Context
cluster potential well, and (ii) interactions with the hot gas that is known to permeate galaxy
clusters. In the following, the specific mechanisms often considered when trying to assess the
influence of the environment on galaxy evolution are discussed in more detail.
3.7.1 Galaxy Harassment
Galaxy mergers and more generally strong galaxy–galaxy interactions are commonly viewed
as a rarity in massive clusters because of the large velocity dispersion of the system. It should
be noted, however, that they are still important in the outskirts of galaxy clusters, and they
were certainly more efficient in the infalling group environment. Therefore, they may repre-
sent an important “preprocessing” step in the evolution of cluster galaxies. In rich clusters,
the encounters between galaxies will be generally high-speed interactions. The colliding galaxy
is impulsively heated and becomes less bound and more vulnerable to disruptions by further
encounters and by tidal interactions with the global cluster potential.
The cumulative effect of repeated, numerous fast encounters is usually referred to as “harass-
ment.” This process has been discussed in early work on the dynamical evolution of cluster
galaxies (Richstone 1976) and has been explored in detail using numerical simulations (Farouki
and Shapiro 1981; Moore et al. 1998). These have confirmed that repeatedhigh-speed collisions,
coupled with the effects of the global tidal field of the cluster, can drive a strong response in clus-
ter galaxies. The efficiency of the process is, however, largely limited to low-luminosity hosts due
to their slowly rising rotation curves and their low-density cores. Therefore, it is believed that
harassment might have an important role in the formation of dwarf ellipticals or in the destruc-
tion of low-surface brightness galaxies in clusters, but it is less able to explain the evolution of
luminous cluster galaxies.
>Figure 10-15 shows the evolution of the stellar surface density of a galaxy that is orbiting
close to the center of a galaxy cluster. The first stages of the evolution are characterized by the
formation of a strong bar and of an open spiral pattern that is, however, easily stripped by tidal
interactions. In contrast, the bar appears to be quite stable. It undergoes strong “buckling” insta-
bilities that make the central part of the galaxy more spherical. In the final stages, the galaxy
resembles a drawf spheroidal system.
3.7.2 Cannibalism
Early theoretical studies have discussed the role of cannibalism due to dynamical friction in
the formation of brightest cluster galaxies (e.g., Ostriker and Tremaine 1975). This early work,
however, significantly overestimated the efficiency of the process due to different simplified
assumptions adopted. In the now standard paradigm of structure formation, clusters assemble
quite late, through the merging of smaller systems. In this perspective, cooling flows are the
main fuel for galaxy formation at high redshift, in dense and lower-mass haloes. This source
is removed at lower redshift possibly due to feedback from AGN. Galaxy-galaxy mergers, as
discussed above, are most efficient within small haloes with low-velocity dispersions. These
mergers are indeed driven by dynamical friction, but it is the accretion rate of the galaxies onto
the protocluster, along with the cluster growth itself, that regulate and set the conditions for
galaxy merging.
This is illustrated very nicely in > Fig. 10-16 which shows the merger tree of the central
galaxy of a cluster-sized halo (for details, see De Lucia and Blaizot 2007). The brightest cluster

are plotted downward going back in time recursively. Galaxies with stellar mass larger (resp.
smaller) than h−M⊙are shown as symbols (resp. lines) and are color-coded according to
their rest-frame B-V color. The leftmost branch in >Fig. 10-16 represents the “main branch,”
obtained by connecting the galaxy at each time step to the progenitor with the largest stellar
mass at the immediately preceding time step (the “main progenitor”).
>Figure 10-16 shows another important point: in the context of the hierarchical paradigm
for structure formation, the full history of a galaxy is described by its complete merger tree.
Whereas in the “monolithic” approximation, the history of a galaxy can be described by a set
of functions of time, hierarchical histories are difficult to summarize in a simple form because
even the identity of a galaxy is ill-defined. A galaxy is no more a single object when viewed at
different times but the ensemble of its progenitors, all of which need to be taken into account for
a correct characterization of the stellar population of the final object. It is also interesting to note
that although the merger trees of these central galaxies have a very large number of branches,
only a small fraction of these contribute significantly to the buildup of their stellar mass: in this
particular example, ∼70% of the mass comes from the accretion of 12 galaxies more massive
than h−M⊙(see also De Lucia et al. 2006).
3.7.3 Ram-Pressure Stripping
Galaxies travelling through a dense intracluster medium suffer a strong ram-pressure stripping
that can sweep cold gas out of the stellar disk (Gunn and Gott 1972). Depending on the binding
energy of the gas in the galaxy, the intracluster medium will either blow through the galaxy,
removing some of the diffuse interstellar medium, or will be forced to flow around the galaxy

are shown with symbols. Circles are used for galaxies that reside in the FOF group inhabited by the
main branch. Triangles show galaxies that have not yet joined this FOF group
(Cowie and Songaila 1977; Nulsen 1982). Ram-pressure stripping is expected to be more impor-
tant at the center of massive systems because of the large relative velocities and higher densities
of the intracluster medium. By considering the distribution and history of ram-pressure expe-
rienced by galaxies in clusters, Brüggen and De Lucia (2008) estimated that strong episodes
of ram-pressure are indeed predominant in the inner core of the clusters. They also showed,
however, that virtually all cluster galaxies suffered weaker episodes of ram-pressure, suggesting
that this physical process might have a significant role in shaping the observed properties of the
entire cluster galaxy population. In addition, Brüggen and De Lucia found that ram-pressure
fluctuates strongly so that episodes of strong ram-pressure alternate to episodes of weaker ram
pressure, possibly allowing the gas reservoir to be replenished and intermittent episodes of star
formation to occur.
Ample observational evidence that ram-pressure is occurring is available, and the process
has been extensively studied using hydrodynamical simulations. >Figure 10-17 shows snap-
shots from the simulations carried out by Quilis et al. (2000). The figure shows a galaxy moving
face on and nearly edge on through the core of a rich clusterat a velocity of ∼2,000 km s−. These
simulations showed that the time scale for stripping is very short compared to the orbital time
scale, and that the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium and the presence of bubbles
and holes make the disk more susceptible to viscous stripping. A simple estimate of the effi-
ciency of ram-pressure was obtained by Gunn and Gott (1972), by comparing the ram pressure
with the galactic gravitational restoring force per unit area. This leads to the following condition:

simulations showed that this analytical estimate fares fairly well, as long as the galaxies are not
moving close to edge on. More recent numerical work (e.g., Roediger and Brüggen 2007) has
shown that this formulation often yields incorrect mass-loss rates. In addition, simple models
based on the Gunn and Gott formula usually do not consider the possibility that ram-pressure
stripping could temporarily enhance star formation.
3.7.4 Strangulation
Current theories of galaxy formation assume that when a galaxy is accreted onto a larger struc-
ture, the gas supply can no longer be replenished by cooling that is suppressed because of the
removal (by tides and ram-pressure) of the hot-gas halo associated with the infalling galaxy
(Larson et al. 1980). This process is usually referred to as “strangulation” (or “starvation” or
“suffocation”). It is common to read in discussions related to these physical mechanisms that
strangulation is expected to affect the star formation of cluster galaxies on relatively long time
scales, and therefore to cause a slow decline of the star formation activity. As we will see below,
however, in recent galaxy formation models, this process is usually associated to a strong super-
novae feedback. As a consequence, galaxies that fall onto a larger system consume their cold gas
rapidly, moving onto the red sequence on very short time scales.
Traditionally, in galaxy formation models, the stripping of the hot gaseous reservoir has
been assumed to be complete and instantaneous. Using a suite of controlled full hydrodynamic
simulations, however, McCarthy et al. (2008) have found that a fraction (about 30%) of the ini-
tial hot galactic halo gas can remain in place even after 10 Gyr. Saro et al. (2010) have confirmed
that cooling can occur on satellite galaxies, but this seems to be limited to the most massive ones.
In these satellites, the star formation can last for up to ∼1 Gyr after accretion, albeit significantly
suppressed with respect to the average value before accretion.
3.8 Stellar Populations
Observational studies of galaxies make use of the radiation emitted by them to infer their phys-
ical properties. In order to make a close link between model predictions and observational data,
it is therefore necessary to compute the luminosity emitted by the galaxy as a function of wave-
length or frequency. Analytically, the spectral energy distribution of a galaxy can be expressed as
the superposition of numerous “single-stellar populations” (SSPs) that are populations of stars
with the same age, initial mass function, and chemical composition. The luminosity of each of
these SSPs can be written as
L(SSP)
ν
(t, Z, ϕ) = ∫
Mmax
Mmin
ϕ(M′)L(star)
ν
(t, Z)dM′
where Mmin and Mmax are the minimum and maximum mass for stars, respectively, ϕ(M) is the
initial mass function, and L(star)
ν
(t, Z) is the spectrum of a single star of metallicity Z and age t.
If the luminosity of the SSPs is known as a function of age and metallicity, then the luminosity
of a galaxy can be written as

where ˙M⋆(t, Z) gives the rate at which stars of metallicity Z form at the time t inside the galaxy.
Several libraries are available in the literature which provide L(SSP)
ν
(t, Z, ϕ) for different
ages, metallicities, and initial mass functions (e.g., Bruzual and Charlot 2003; Maraston et al.
2009; Conroy et al. 2009). These libraries are constructed using a combination of theoretical
stellar evolution models, direct observations of stars for which age and metallicity can be mea-
sured, and theoretical models of stellar atmospheres where no observations are available. In the
framework of galaxy formation, these population synthesis models are usually treated as “black
boxes.” It is important, however, to remember that significant uncertainties remain in many of
their ingredients. The AGB regime, for example, is very difficult to treat because of the pul-
sational regime, the double-shell burning, and especially the strong mass losses affecting this
phase. This leads to large uncertainties in the evolution of the spectral continuum in rest-frame
near infrared (for a review, see Maraston 2011).
Real galaxies are not made only of stars but also contain gas (both hot and cold) and dust.
This can significantly affect the observed luminosities in the ultraviolet and in the optical and
even dominate the luminosity in the far-infrared portion of the spectrum. Indeed dust, that is
believed to be produced in the envelops of AGB stars and from supernovae, absorbs light emit-
ted by stars particularly at short wavelengths, is heated by this light, and re-emits it at longer
wavelengths (infrared and sub-mm). It is clear that in order to accurately model the dust extinc-
tion and emission, one needs to know how dust grains and stars are distributed and which is
the composition of the dust grains.
For a population of galaxies that are assumedto have the same composition and distribution
of dust, one can derive an “effective” extinction law that can then be used without modeling
in detail the dust distribution. For example, one can assume that an “obscuting screen” or a
“slab” geometry of dust is sitting between the galaxy and the observer. A simple estimate of the
amount of extinction can then be obtained by adopting the measured effective law (e.g., the
law found for local starburst galaxies by Calzetti et al. 1994) and by scaling the depth at optical
wavelengths on the basis of the physical properties of the galaxy under consideration (e.g., gas
content and metallicity). Alternatively, the propagation of light through the interstellarmedium
can be studied using radiative transfer calculations which take into account the geometry of the
galaxy, as well as the distribution and mix of dust (Silva et al. 1998; Jonsson 2006). Recent work
by Fontanot et al. (2009b) has compared the two approaches and has shown that the former can
predict quite accurately results from the full radiative transfer calculation, with a small scatter.
However, there is a large galaxy-to-galaxy variation, likely due to different geometries, that the
simple approach cannot capture. It should be noted that also radiative transfer codes often need
to make a number of assumptions about the physical state of the dust and about its distribution
relative to stars and the interstellar medium. Finally, given the uncertainties involved, often
these properties are assumed not to vary as a function of cosmic time.

Putting It Together: Models of Galaxy Formation
in a Cosmological Context
As discussed above, the process of galaxy formation involves complex and nonlinear physical
processes that cover many orders of magnitude in physical size (from the scale of black holes to
that of massive galaxy clusters) and in time scales. In addition, as we have seen in the previous
section, many (if not all) of the physical processes at play cannot be treated from first principles.

488 10
Galaxies in the Cosmological Context
In the past decades, however, three major approaches have been used and further developed in
order to circumvent these difficulties and improve our understanding of the physical processes
that drive galaxy formation and evolution. The following provides a brief review of these tech-
niques and discusses the most recent successes and problems of one particular class of models
that is widely used to make detailed predictions of galaxy properties at different cosmic epochs
and environments.
This section will not provide a detailed description of the implementations used in differ-
ent models. Given the complexity involved, such a description would rapidly become out of
date as models are continuously being improved and developed. Rather, this section is aimed at
discussing the weaknesses and the strengths of each of the methods that can be used to model
galaxy formation in a cosmological context.
4.1 The Halo Occupation Distribution Method
This method essentially bypasses any explicit modeling of the physical processes driving galaxy
formation and evolution and specifies the link between dark matter haloes and galaxies in a
purely statistical fashion. The halo occupation framework has a long history: a first descrip-
tion can be found in Neyman and Scott (1952) who discussed an analytic model that described
galaxy clustering as the superposition of randomly distributed clusters with given profiles. The
method has become very popular in more recent years, after it was realized that it provides
a powerful formalism for understanding the clustering of galaxies (e.g., Benson et al. 2000;
Berlind and Weinberg 2002, and references therein). A classical halo occupation distribution
(HOD) model can be constructed by specifying the probability that a halo of mass M contains
N galaxies of a particular class (the halo occupation distribution – P(N∣M))and by assuming a
spatial distribution of galaxies inside dark matter haloes (the most common assumption is that
the distribution of galaxies follows that of the dark matter). The halo occupation distribution
can then be constrained using galaxy clustering data. For example, a simple model that is often
employed in the literature assumesthat the mean number of galaxies above a certain luminosity
threshold changes with halo mass as
Navg = { 
if M < Mmin
(M/M)α
otherwise,
(10.6)
where Mmin is a cutoff halo mass below which haloes cannot contain galaxies. In this model, M
corresponds to the mass of haloes that contain, on average, one galaxy. >Figure 10-18 shows
the influence of Mmin (left panel) and α (right panel) on the galaxy correlation function and
demonstrates that these observational data can be used to constrain the HOD parameters.
The same approach can be extended to constrain the halo occupation as a function of
some galaxy physical property (e.g., luminosity, color, type, etc.). For example, one can define
a “conditional luminosity function” Φ(L∣M)dL that specifies the average number of galaxies
with luminosities in the range L ± dL/that reside in a halo of mass M. This provides a direct
link between the observed galaxy luminosity function and the halo mass function:

tribution described in (>10.6) with diﬀerent values of Mmin and α as indicated in the legend. Data
points show the correlation function measured from the APM galaxy survey (Baugh 1996)
In addition, one can express the total luminosity of a halo of a given mass as a function of the
conditional luminosity function:
< L(M) > = ∫
∞

Φ(L∣M)LdL
It has been shown that by adopting this formalism, it is possible to constrain both galaxy for-
mation and cosmology by using the following observational data: the observed luminosity
function, the luminosity dependence of the galaxy-galaxy two-point correlation function, and
the average mass-to-light ratios as function of halo mass (van den Bosch et al. 2003).
The method described above is conceptually simple and relatively easy to implement.
As shown, it can be constrained using the increasing amount of available information on the
clustering properties of galaxies at different cosmic epochs, and it provides important statistical
constraints for galaxy formation models. It remains difficult, however, to move from this purely
statistical characterization of the link between dark matter haloes and galaxies to a more phys-
ical understanding of the galaxy formation process itself. In addition, the method described
above implicitly assumes that the number of galaxies of a given type populating a dark matter
halo, as well as the clustering properties of dark matter haloes, depend only on the halo mass.
That is, the method neglects the assembly bias that has been discussed in >Sect. 2.4. Recent
studies show that this might not be a significant problem, at least for relatively bright galaxies
(Tinker et al. 2008, and references therein). Further investigations are, however, needed, par-
ticularly in light of the statistical power and redshift coverage of forthcoming observational
surveys.
A variant of the HOD approach is provided by the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM)
technique. The method consists in assigning observable galaxy properties to the subhalo pop-
ulation of an N-body simulation, assuming a monotonic relation between these properties and

490 10
Galaxies in the Cosmological Context
some property of the substructure (e.g., the mass or the maximum circular velocity of dark
matter halos) at the time of “accretion,” i.e., when the halo was accreted onto a larger structure
becoming a subhalo (Conroy et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2006). This method offers some advantages
with respect to the simple HOD approach described above. For example, it explicitly accounts
for the dependence of the halo history on the environment. It could, however, depending on the
resolution of the simulation, miss a significant fraction of the galaxy population: the “orphan”
galaxies (i.e., those whose parent substructures were destroyed below the resolution by tidal
stripping).
4.2 Hydrodynamical Simulations
Two different approaches can be used to include gas physics in N-body simulations. The most
straightforward technique is adopted in smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) codes. These
are based on a Lagrangian method which essentially works dividing the fluid into a set of dis-
crete elements (particles). These have a spatial distance (“smoothing length”), over which their
properties are smoothed by a kernel function. Any physical quantity of a particle (for example,
density, temperature, and chemical composition) can then be obtained by summing the rele-
vant properties of all the particles which lie within the range of the kernel. The contributions of
each particle to a physical property are weighted according to their distance from the particle of
interest and their density. Because of the smoothing, SPH codes have problems in resolving and
treating dynamical instabilities developing at sharp interfaces in a multiphase fluid (e.g., shocks,
Agertz et al. 2007). The Lagrangian nature of the method, however, means that regions of high
density are automatically better resolved than regions of low density so that it is possible to
study many orders of magnitude in the fluid properties. An alternative scheme is adopted in
Eulerian codes in which the fluid equations are solved on a grid which is fixed in time and that
can be “refined” several times to increase the resolution in regions of interest. This method is
thus well adapted for capturing shocks and discontinuities. The resolution of the simulation can
be increased by using “adaptive mesh refinements,” but it can become quite time consuming.
As a tool for studying galaxy formation and evolution, hydrodynamical simulations offer
the great advantage of providing an explicit description of the gas dynamics. They are, however,
quite demanding in terms of computational time and memory consumption so that it is often
necessary to limit the resolution range and the size of the volume being simulated. Additionally,
and perhaps more importantly, complex physical processes such as star formation, feedback,
etc., still have to be included as “subgrid physics.” This is the case either because the resolution
of the simulation is inadequate to treat a specific problem or simply because (and this is true
almost always) we do not have a complete theory for the physical problem under consideration.
Current state-of-the-art full hydrodynamic cosmological simulations include the Galaxies-
Intergalactic Medium Interaction Calculation project (GIMIC, Crain et al. see 2009) and the
OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project (OWLS, Schaye et al. 2010). In the GIMIC project,
five different regions with different mean overdensities have been selected from the Millennium
simulation. These have been resimulated at high resolution using a SPH code that takes into
account metal-dependent cooling in the presence of an ionizing UV background and includes
a model for star formation and supernova feedback. Since each of the simulations is a consid-
erable investment of computational time, they have been run using a unique set of parameters
and concentrating on the environmental effects ofthe physical processes considered. The OWLS
project represents a complimentary approach as it is based on a suite of over 50 cosmological

GIMIC project (colored curves) and their weighted average (black curve). The stellar mass function
of the region with largest overdensity at high resolution is also shown (gray curve) to illustrate the
degree of convergence. Symbols with error bars show observational measurements from Drory
et al. (2005) at z = 2 and from Li and White (2009) at z = 0
simulations (typically much smaller than the GIMIC high-resolution regions) that investigate
the effects of different implementations of subgrid physics.
>Figure 10-19 shows how the stellar mass function resulting from the GIMIC simulations
compares with observational measurements at z ∼in the left panel and at z = in the right
panel. Colored lines show results from each simulation while the black lines show theirweighted
average. The figure shows that the shape of the predicted stellar mass function differs signifi-
cantly from that measured: the simulations predict an excess of low- and high-mass galaxies
with respect to the observations and a “dip” in correspondence of the “knee” of the observed
stellar mass function (that is where most of the galaxy mass is). At higher redshift, where the
observations span only a limited mass range, the agreement looks better, but the shape of the
predicted galaxy mass function does not vary with respect to the z = predictions. The excess
at large masses in the overdense regions originates mainly from the fact that these simulations
do not include any modeling of the heating processes that can quench cooling flows in clusters
(see also next sections). At low and intermediate masses, the disagreement with observational
data is likely due to the simple wind model that has been adopted (for details, see Crain et al.
2009). A feedback model that follows the scalings expected for momentum-driven winds can
give a better match with observational data around the knee of the luminosity function but still
fails at higher and lower masses (Davé et al. 2011).
Much work has been done using direct simulations of the baryonic physics to study the
formation and evolution of individual haloes at high resolution. These simulations take advan-
tage of the zoom technique: first, a cosmological simulation of a large region is used to select a
suitable target halo. The particles in the selected halo and its surroundings (usually all the par-
ticles within two times the virial radius) are then traced back to their initial Lagrangian region
and are replaced by a larger number of lower mass particles. These are perturbed using the

492 10
Galaxies in the Cosmological Context
same fluctuation distribution as in the parent simulation but now extended to smaller scales to
account for the increase in resolution. This resampling of the initial conditions thus allows a
localized increase in mass and force resolution. Outside the high-resolution region, particles of
variable mass (increasing with distance) are used, so that the computational effort is concen-
trated on the region of interest while still maintaining a faithful representation of the large-scale
density and velocity field of the parent simulation.
On the cluster scale, significant disagreements with the observational data are still found
in terms of the statistical description of the cluster galaxy population. For example, Saro et al.
(2006) analyze a set of 19 cluster resimulations carried out using a SPH code that includes gas
cooling, star formation, a detailed treatment of stellar evolution and chemical enrichment, as
well as supernova feedback. They find that the total number of galaxies in their simulated clus-
ters falls short of the observational measurements by a factor 2–3. The problem does not have
an obvious numerical origin (e.g., lack of mass and force resolution). In addition, the BCGs of
the simulated clusters are always predicted to be too massive and too blue when compared to
data, stressing the need for the inclusion of a physical process that suppresses gas condensation
at the center of relatively massive haloes.
At galaxy scales, simulations have generally had problems reproducing disk-dominated
galaxies in typical dark matter haloes, when taking into account the cosmological setting. One
major problem is known as the “angular momentum catastrophe”: baryons condense early in
clumps that then fall into larger haloes and merge via dynamical friction. This produces a net
and significant transfer of angular momentum from the baryons to the dark matter. As a result,
simulated disks are generally too small with up to ten times less angular momentum than real
disk galaxies. The formation of a realistic rotationally supported disk galaxy in a fully cosmo-
logical simulation is still an open problem. Recent numerical work shows that it is in part due
to limited resolution and related numerical effects that cause artificial angular momentum loss
and spurious bulge formation (for a detailed discussion, see Mayer et al. 2008). The physics of
galaxy formation during the merger of the most massive protogalactic lumps at high redshift
and, in particular, the feedback due to supernovae is, howevelr, also playing a very important
role (e.g., Scannapieco et al. 2008, and references therein).
4.3 Semianalytic Models of Galaxy Formation
The backbone of any semianalytic model is a statistical representation of the growth of dark
matter haloes, i.e., a merger tree. Once the backbone of the model is constructed, galaxy forma-
tion and evolution can be coupled to the merger trees using a set of analytic laws that are based
on theoretical and/or observational arguments to describe complex physical processes like star
formation, supernovae and AGN feedback processes, etc. Adopting this formalism, it is possible
to express the full galaxy formation process through a set of differential equations that describe
the variation in mass of the different galactic components (e.g., gas, stars, metals). Given our
limited understanding of the physical processes at play, these equations contain “free parame-
ters,” whose values are typically chosen in order to provide a reasonably good agreement with
observational data in the local universe. These techniques find their seeds in the pioneering
work by White and Rees (1978), have been laid out in a more detailed form in the early 1990s
(White and Frenk 1991; Cole 1991), and have been substantially extendedand refined in the last
years by a number of different groups. For a detailed review of these techniques, the interested
reader is referred to Baugh (2006).

Galaxies in the Cosmological Context 10
493
In their first renditions, semianalytic models relied on Monte Carlo realizations of merg-
ing histories of individual objects, generated using the extended Press-Schechter theory
(e.g., Kauffmann et al. 1993). An important advance of later years came from the coupling of
semianalytic techniques with large-resolution N-body simulations that are used to specify the
location and evolution of dark matterhaloes – the birthplaces of luminous galaxies (Kauffmann
et al. 1999; Benson et al. 2000). On a next level of complexity, some more recent implementa-
tions of these techniques have explicitly taken into account dark matter substructures, i.e., the
haloes within which galaxies form are still followed when they are accreted onto a more mas-
sive system (Springel et al. 2001; De Lucia et al. 2004b). There is one important caveat to bear
in mind regarding these methods: dark matter substructures are fragile systems that are rapidly
and efficiently destroyed below the resolution limit of the simulation (see >Sect. 2.4). Depend-
ing on the resolution of the simulations used, this can happen well before the actual merger can
take place. This treatment introduces a complication due to the presence of “orphan galaxies,”
i.e., galaxies whose parent substructure mass has been reduced below the resolution limit of the
simulation. In most of the available semianalytic models, these galaxies are assumed to merge
onto the corresponding central galaxies after a residual merging time which is given by some
variation of the classical dynamical friction formula.
One great advantage of these hybrid methods, with respect to classical techniques based
on the extended Press-Schechter formalism, is that they provide full dynamical information
about model galaxies. Using realistic mock catalogs generated with these methods, accurate
and straightforward comparisons with observational data can be carried out. Since N-body
simulations can handle large numbers of particles, the hybrid approach can access a very large
dynamic range of mass and spatial resolution, at small computational costs. In addition, since
the computational times are limited, these methods also allow a fast exploration of the param-
eter space and an efficient investigation of the influence of specific physical assumptions. This
comes at the expenses, however, of loosing an explicit description of the gas dynamics.
One common criticism to semianalytic models is that there are “too many” free parameters.
It should be noted, however, that the number of these parameters is not larger than the number
of published comparisons with different and independent sets of observational data, for any of
the semianalytic models discussed in the recent literature. In addition, these are not “statistical”
parameters but, as explained above, they are due to our lack of understanding of the physical
processes considered. Therefore, a change in any of these parameters has consequences on a
number of different predictable properties so that often there is little parameter degeneracy
for a given set of prescriptions. Finally, observations and theoretical arguments often provide
important constraints on the range of values that different parameters can assume.
4.4 Successes and Problems of Semianalytic Models of Galaxy
Formation
Clearly, each of the methods described above has its own advantages and weaknesses, and
they should be viewed as complementary rather than competitive. In the framework of galaxy
formation, semianalytic models certainly represent the most developed theoretical tool for
interpreting observations of galaxy formation and evolution. This section provides a brief
discussion of some of the most recent successes and problems of current models.
It is interesting to start this discussion from what can be considered the most fundamental
description of the galaxy population: the galaxy luminosity function. As mentioned above, since

494 10
Galaxies in the Cosmological Context
early implementations of semianalytic techniques, it was clear that a relatively strong super-
novae feedback was needed in order to suppress the large excess of faint galaxies due to the
steep increase of low-mass dark matter haloes (White and Frenk 1991; Benson et al. 2003).
The left panel of >Fig. 10-20 shows results from different models: the simplest one is obtained
converting the dark matter halo mass function into a galaxy luminosity function by assum-
ing a fixed mass-to-light ratio (this is the same model shown in > Fig. 10-9). As discussed
in >Sect. 3.4, this model overpredicts the faint and the bright ends of the luminosity function
by orders of magnitude. The other lines shown in the left panel of >Fig. 10-20 correspond to
different models where different ingredients have been switched on, as indicated in the legend.
None of these models reproduces the observational measurements.The right panel of the figure
shows how the predicted K-band luminosity function compares with observational measure-
ments, for increasing efficiency of supernovae feedback. Adopting a relatively strong feedback
(see also Guo et al. 2011), the agreement with the observational data becomes satisfactory at
the faint end. It is interesting to note, however, that matching the faint end of the luminosity
function comes at the expenses of exacerbating the excess of luminous bright objects. This is
due to the fact that the material reheated and/or ejected by low-mass galaxies in this model (but
this is generally true for most of the models that can be found in the literature) ends up in the
hot gas that is associated with the corresponding central galaxies. At later times, this material
cools efficiently onto the corresponding central galaxies increasing their luminosities and star
formation rates, at odds with observational data.

Matching the bright end of the luminosity function has proved much more difficult than
matching the faint end, and a reasonable success has been achieved only recently by means of a
relativelystrong form of“radio-mode” AGN feedback (see >Sect. 3.4.3). Different prescriptions
of AGN feedback have been proposed in recently published models (e.g., Croton et al. 2006;
Bower et al. 2006; Monaco et al. 2007), and still much work remains to be done in order to
understand if and how the energy injected by intermittent radio activity at the cluster center
is able to efficiently suppress the cooling flows. In addition, recent work has pointed out that
most models assume a strong dependence of radio-mode feedback on the parent halo mass.
As a consequence of this assumption, these models predict that essentially all massive galaxies
should be associated with a bright radio source, while observational data suggest that faint and
bright radio sources are found in similar environments in equal numbers (Fontanot et al. 2011).
Finally, it should be noted that although AGN feedback has received much attention in recent
years, the necessity of introducing a physical process to suppress the condensation of gas at the
center of massive haloes and the hypothesis that this might be due to feedback from AGN was
noted in earlier work (e.g., Kauffmann et al. 1999).
The main reason forthe success ofthe “radio-mode” AGN feedback is that it does not require
star formation to be effective. As a consequence, this mode of feedback permits to suppress the
luminosity of massive galaxies and, at the same time, to keep their stellar populations old, in
qualitative agreement with observational data (see, e.g., De Lucia et al. 2006). The models also
seem to reproduce, at least qualitatively, the observed trend for more massive ellipticals to have
shorter star formation time scales. A good quantitative agreement has not been shown yet, and
a detailed comparison between models and observations is complicated by large uncertainties
associated to star formation histories extracted from observed galaxy spectra (see, e.g., Fontanot
et al. 2009a).
In these models, ellipticals and bulges form mainly through mergers (for a detailed anal-
ysis of the contribution of different channels, see De Lucia et al. 2011). Naively, one expects
very large numbers of mergers in the hierarchical scenario, where more massive systems form
through the mergers of smaller units, and larger systems are expected to be made up by a larger
number of progenitors. It is therefore interesting to ask how the number of progenitors varies as
a function of galaxy mass. The left panel of >Fig. 10-21 shows the “effective number of stellar
progenitors” of elliptical galaxies of different mass. This quantity represents a mass-weighted
counting of the stellar systems that make up the final galaxy, and therefore provides a good
proxy for the number of significant mergers required to assemble a galaxy of given mass. The
figure shows results from a model where only mergers contribute to the formation of bulges
(empty circles) and those from a model where bulges can also form through disk instability
(filled symbols). The vertical dashed line indicates the threshold above which the morphology
classification can be considered robust (the limit is set by the resolution of the parent N-body
simulation). As expected, more massive galaxies are made up of more pieces. The number of
effective progenitors is, however, less than two up to stellar masses of ≃M⊙, indicating that
the formation of these systems typically involves only a small number of major mergers. Only
more massive galaxies are built through a larger number of mergers, reaching up to ≃5 for

⊡Fig. 10-21
From DeLucia et al. (2006). Rightpanel: distribution of formation (toppanel) and assembly redshifts
(bottompanel). The shadedhistogram is for elliptical galaxies with stellar mass larger than 1011 M⊙,
while the open histogram is for all ellipticals with mass larger than 4 × 109 M⊙. Arrows indicate the
medians of the distributions, with the thick arrows referring to the shaded histograms. Left panel:
eﬀective number of progenitors as a function of galaxy stellar mass for model elliptical galaxies.
Symbols show the median of the distribution, while error bars indicate the upper and lower quar-
tiles. Filled and empty symbols refer to a model with and without a disk instability channel for the

assemble “later” than their lower-mass counterparts. The assembly history of ellipticals hence
parallels the hierarchical growth of dark matter haloes, in contrast to the formation history
of the stars themselves. Data shown in the right panel of >Fig. 10-21 imply that a significant
fraction of present elliptical galaxies have assembled relatively recently, through purely stellar
mergers. This finding appears to be supported by recent observational results (e.g., van Dokkum
2005).
Models predict an increase in stellar mass by a factor 2–4 since z ∼, depending on stellar
mass (De Lucia et al. 2006; De Lucia and Blaizot 2007). This creates a certain tension with the
observation that the massive end of the galaxy mass function does not appear to evolve signifi-
cantly over the same redshift interval. A large part of this tension is removed when taking into
account observational errors and uncertainties on galaxy mass estimates (see Fontanot et al.
2009a, and references therein). For the mass assembly of the BCGs, the situation is worse: while
observations seem consistent with no mass growth since z ∼, models predict an increase in
mass by a factor about 4 (De Lucia and Blaizot 2007; Whiley et al. 2008). One major caveat
in this comparison, however, is given by the fact that observational studies usually adopt fixed
metric aperture magnitudes (which account for about 25–50% of the total light contained in
the BCG and intracluster light), while models compute total magnitudes. Semianalytic mod-
els do not provide information regarding the spatial distribution of the BCG light, so aperture
magnitudes cannot be calculated. In addition, most of the available models do not take into

account the stripping of stars from other cluster galaxies due to tidal and harassment effects
(Monaco et al. 2006; Conroy et al. 2007).
Most of the models currently available exhibit a remarkable degree of agreement with
a large number of observations for the galaxy population in the local universe (e.g., the
observed relations between stellar mass, gas mass, and metallicity; the observed luminos-
ity, color, and morphology distribution; the observed two-point correlation functions). When
analyzed in detail, however, some of these comparisons show important and systematic (i.e.,
common to most of the semianalytic models discussed in the literature) disagreements. A few
of the problems on which the community is focusing in current years are discussed in the
following.
Although models are not usually tuned to match observations of galaxy clustering, they gen-
erally reproduce the observed dependenceof clustering on magnitude and color. The agreement
appears particularly good for the dependence on luminosity, while the amplitude difference on
color appears greater in the models than observed (Springel et al. 2005b). This problem might be
(at least in part) related to the excess of small red satellite galaxies which plagues all models dis-
cussed in the recent literature (e.g., see Fig. 11 in Croton et al. 2006 and discussion in Fontanot
et al. 2009a). At low redshift, this excess is largely due to satellite galaxies that were formed and
accreted earlyon and that are dominated byold stellarpopulations. As explained in >Sect. 3.7.4,
semianalytic models assume that when a galaxy is accreted onto a larger structure, the gas sup-
ply can no longer be replenished by cooling that is suppressed by an instantaneous and complete
stripping of the hot-gas reservoir. Since this process is usually combined with a relatively effi-
cient supernovae feedback, galaxies that are accreted onto a larger system consume their gas
very rapidly, moving onto the red sequence on quite short time scales (Weinmann et al. 2006;
Wang et al. 2007). This contributes to produce an excess of faint and red satellites and a tran-
sition region (sometimes referred to as “green valley”) which does not appear to be as well
populated as observed. Much effort has been recently devoted to this problem, and many mod-
els have implemented a noninstantaneous stripping of the hot halo around satellites (e.g., Font
et al. 2008; Weinmann et al. 2010; Guo et al. 2011). With these modifications, a larger fraction
of the model satellites have bluer colors, resulting in a color distribution that is in better (but not
perfect) agreement with the observational data. These models, however, still appear to overes-
timate the number of low- and intermediate-massgalaxies at higher redshift and the clustering
signal on small scales (see, e.g., Figs. 20 and 23 in Guo et al. 2011).
The completion of new high-redshift surveys has recently pushed comparisons between
model results and observational data to higher redshift (Stringer et al. 2009; de la Torre et al.
2011). This currently still rather unexplored regime for models of galaxy formation is very
interesting because it is at high redshift that predictions from different models differ more
dramatically.
To close this section, it is worth reminding that a long-standing problem for hierarchical
models has been to match the zero point of the Tully-Fisher relation (the observed corre-
lation between the rotation speed and the luminosity of spiral disks, Tully and Fisher 1977)
while reproducing, at the same time, the observed luminosity function. As discussed in Baugh
(2006), no model with a realistic calculation of galaxy size has been able to match the zero
point of the Tully-Fisher relation using the circular velocity of the disk measured at the half-
mass radius. It remains unclear if this difficulty is related to some approximation in the size
calculation, or if it is related to more fundamental shortcomings of the cold dark matter
model.

Concluding Remarks
This chapter has assumed that the cosmogony of our universe is well described by the ΛCDM
paradigm. As a matter of fact, the CDM paradigm is not without its problems. The most dis-
cussed ones are related to the central mass distribution of low-surface brightness galaxies, to
the existing substructure in galaxy-size haloes, and to the angular momentum of the galaxy
disks (e.g., Tasitsiomi 2003; Benson 2005, and references therein). If there is a CDM “crisis”
then, it is on the galactic and subgalactic scale, where the influence of the baryonic component
is expected to play an important role. Indeed, many (all?) of the problems listed above might
have an astrophysical solution, so rather than problems of the CDM scenario they might be
problems with the way we model the evolution of the baryons in the cosmological context. It is
clear then that in order to really test CDM, we need to improve our galaxy formation models
so as to make more accurate predictions on small scales.
As discussed in >Sect. 3 of this chapter, galaxy formation is a very difficult physical prob-
lem as one should account for a variety of phenomena that act on different scales and at
different times and that interact in many possible ways. In addition, both theoretically and
observationally, we have a very limited understanding of most of the physical processes that
should be taken into account. Given the complexity of the problem, it is clear that we are not
yet (and perhaps we will never be) in the position of being able to model galaxy formation
“from first principles.” We can, however, use a number of different techniques that can help us
improving our understanding of the physical processes at play.
The theoretical tools that can be employed to study galaxy formation and evolution are
many and complementary. None of them will ever provide “the model” that reproduces the
observed universe. Indeed, it would be perhaps naive to believe that it is possible to summa-
rize all the complexity that we observe in a set of analytic or semianalytic or seminumerical
equations. The way to proceed then is to take advantage of the complementarity between dif-
ferent approaches and use the observational data to falsify the hypotheses that have been made.
In going into this loop, one has to remember that the models generally include a number of
free parameters. However, more than to the exact value of the parameters, attention should be
given to the “parameterizations,” i.e., specific assumptions on the physical processes considered.
It is clear that the larger the number of processes considered is, the larger will the number of
parameters/parametrizations be. There will be some degeneracy that can, however, be limited
by considering a larger set of observational constraints.
These are exciting times to study galaxy formation. More and better data are becoming
available. Theoretical models that try to reproduce the ever more detailed observational picture
of the universe, will also require ever more complex modeling. Only by keeping the close link
between theoretical predictions and observational data discussed, will it be possible to shed
light on the physical processes governing galaxy formation and evolution.

Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
Abstract:
Supermassive black holes (SMBH) lurk in the nuclei of most massive galaxies, per-
haps in all of them. The tightly observed scaling relations between SMBH masses and structural
properties of their host spheroids likely indicate that the processes fostering the growth of both
components are physically linked, despite the many orders of magnitude difference in their
physical size. This chapter discusses how we constrain the evolution of SMBH, probed by their
actively growing phases, when they shine as active galactic nuclei (AGN) with luminosities
often in excess of that of the entire stellar population of their host galaxies. Following loosely
the chronological developments of the field, we begin by discussing early evolutionary stud-
ies, when AGN observed at various wavelengths represented beacons of light probing the most
distant reaches of the universe and were used as tracers of the large-scale structure (“cosmog-
raphy”). This early study turned into a more mundane enterprise of AGN “demography,” once
it was realized that the strong evolution (in luminosity, number density) of the AGN popula-
tion hindered any attempt to derive cosmological parameters from AGN observations directly.
Following a discussion of the state of the art in the study of AGN luminosity functions, we
move on to discuss the “modern” view of AGN evolution, one in which a bigger emphasis is
given to the physical relationships between the population of growing black holes and their
environment (“cosmology”). This includes observational and theoretical efforts aimed at con-
straining and understanding the evolution of scaling relations, as well as the resulting limits on
the evolution of the SMBH mass function. Physical models of AGN feedback and the ongoing
efforts to isolate them observationally are discussed next. Finally, we touch upon the problem
of when and how the first black holes formed and the role of black holes in the high-redshift
universe.

A Historical Perspective on AGN Research
The study of astrophysical black holes, as it has developed over the last five decades, is driven
by three main rationales and goals. Because the mere existence of black holes is the most far-
reaching implication of the theory of general relativity (together with the Big Bang cosmological
theory), they can first of all be used to test theories of gravitation in the strong field regime.
Secondly, astrophysical black holes are revealed to us through emission processes taking place
in accretion flows and relativistic jets, both originating in the black hole’s deep potential well,
and they offer a unique opportunity of studying interesting and complex astrophysical prob-
lems, involving extreme physical conditions, relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, and radiative
effects. Thirdly, black hole formation and evolution might play an important role in a broader

cosmological context, affecting the formation and the evolution of the structures they live in,
such as galaxies, groups, and clusters.
During the first golden age1 of black hole astrophysics, efforts were focused on finding proof
ofthe existence ofblack holes and todefine theirbasicinteractions with the environment (accre-
tion and relativistic jet theory). Such goals only touched on the first two of the rationales listed
above. The history of the development of black hole physics (both theoretical and observa-
tional) in these years has been beautifully laid out by Kip Thorne in his book Black Holes and
Time Warps:Einstein’sOutrageous Legacy (Thorne 1994), where the reader can find a more com-
plete set of references and biographical notes, together with the historical accounts presented
elsewhere in this volume (see
>Chap. 7).
Beginning at about the turn of the twenty-first century, black hole astrophysicists have
acknowledged the relevance of their subject of study for a broader community of cosmolo-
gists and extragalactic astronomers, thanks to the multiple lines of evidence pointing toward a
fundamental role played by black holes in galaxy evolution.
In fact, black holes in the local universe come in two main families according to their
size, as recognized by the strongly bimodal distribution of the local black hole mass function
(see >Fig. 11-1). While the height, width, and exact mass scale of the stellar mass peak should
be understood as a by-product of stellar (and binary) evolution and of the physical processes
that make supernovae and gamma-ray bursts explode, the supermassive black hole peak in this
distribution is the outcome of the cosmological growth of structures and of the evolution of

a log-normal distribution with mean mass equal to 5 solar masses, width of 0.1 dex, and a normal-
ization yielding a density of about 1.1×107 M⊙Mpc−3 (Fukugita and Peebles 2004), which is about
7 × 10−5 times the critical density of the universe. The supermassive black hole peak, instead, con-
tributes to an overall density of about 4.2×105 M⊙Mpc−3 or a fraction only 2.7×10−6 of the critical
density (see>Sect. 3.1 for details)

the early 1960s and the early 1970s.

accretion in the nuclei of galaxies, likely modulated by the mergers these nuclear black holes
will experience as a result of the hierarchical galaxy–galaxy coalescences.
This picture of the local demographics of black holes has been made possible by the discov-
ery of tight scaling relations between the central black hole mass and various properties of their
host spheroids (velocity dispersion, σ∗, stellar mass, M∗, luminosity, etc.) that characterize the
structure of nearby inactive galaxies (Magorrian et al. 1998; Gebhardt et al. 2000; Ferrarese and
Merritt 2000; Häring and Rix 2004; Gültekin et al. 2009, see >Fig. 11-2).
These correlations are a result of the search for local QSO relics via the study of their dynam-
ical influence on the surrounding stars and gas made possible by the launch of the Hubble

Space Telescope. They have revolutionized the way we understand the physical link between
the evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN2).
In addition, it is now understood that supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth is due
mainly to radiatively efficient accretion over cosmological times, taking place during active
phases (see >Sect. 3.1 below). This, together with the understanding of a near universal pres-
ence of black holes in galactic centers, has led to the suggestion that most, if not all, galaxies
went through a phase of nuclear activity in the past, during which a strong physical coupling
(generally termed “feedback”) might have established a long-lasting link between host and black
hole properties.
Such a renewed interest for AGN in a cosmological context requires a good understanding
of the evolutionary properties of this class of objects. The fact that AGN and quasars were a
strongly evolving class of astronomical sources became evident very soon after their discovery,
as we will discuss at length in the following sections. Nonetheless, the appreciation that such
an evolution could not only mirror but also influence that of galaxies, groups, and clusters only
became commonplace after the discovery of the above-mentioned scaling relations.
In this chapter, we will focus on the current knowledge of AGN evolution. Following loosely
the chronological developments of the field, we will begin by discussing the “first generation”
of AGN evolutionary studies (>Sect. 2), during which AGN observed at various wavelengths
represented beacons of light probing the most distant reaches of the universe and were used as
tracers of the structures themselves.
This short-lived epoch of AGN “cosmography” quickly gave way to a more mundane enter-
prise of AGN “demography,” once it was realized that the strong evolution (in luminosity,
number density, etc.) of the AGN population hindered any serious attempt to derive cosmo-
logical parameters from AGN observations directly. The attention then moved to the study of
the evolution of active galactic nuclei by means of determinations of their luminosity functions.
An update on the most recent works on the luminosity functions of AGN selected in differ-
ent ways from different electromagnetic bands will also be given in >Sect. 2, which will be
closed by a brief discussion of AGN clustering as a natural complementary cosmographic tool
(>Sect. 2.2).
We will then move to discuss the “modern” view of AGN evolution, one in which a big-
ger emphasis is given to the physical relationships between the population of growing black
holes and their environments. We call this the “cosmology” phase of AGN studies, to highlight
the close link between these subject areas that has been established in recent years. We will
first discuss observational and theoretical efforts aimed at constraining and understanding the
evolution of the scaling relations, as well as the resulting limits on the evolution of the SMBH
mass function (>Sect. 3), and we will then present physical models of AGN feedback and the
ongoing efforts to isolate them observationally in >Sect. 4.
Finally, in the last section of this chapter (>Sect. 5), we will touch upon the problem of when
and how the first black holes form and the role of black holes in the high-redshift universe.
Before all this, however, a small diversion is in place. To be consistent, the very notion of
an evolutionary study of any particular class of objects, not only in astrophysics, requires a
definition of the non-evolving substratus that allows us to first identify an object as a memberof
2In this chapter, we will use both the term AGN and QSO/quasar to indicate actively growing supermassive
black holes, implying no real physical distinction between the two, apart from one based on the total emit-
ted luminosity: While AGN can be used for any objects, QSO/quasar usually identify those with bolometric
luminosity log Lbol > in cgs units.

the class, the evolution of which one wishes to study. To make just a simple example drawn from
astronomical research, the evolution of galaxies is very much complicated by the never-ending
morphological and photometric transformation of the different populations, so that a nontrivial
element of any such study is the identification of progenitors and offspring along the Hubble
sequence (see
>Chap. 1).
1.1 Redshift Evolution in AGN Spectral Energy Distributions
The overall spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGN extends over many decades in frequency
and is the result of a number of different emission processes acting at different physical scales.
We refer the reader to
>Chap. 7 in this book for a thorough discussion of these processes and
of the main characteristic of AGN SED.
The observational appearance of an active galactic nucleus is determined not only by its
intrinsic emission properties but also by the nature, amount, dynamical, and kinematic state
of any intervening material along the line of sight. AGN obscuration is a crucial factor for our
general understanding of the AGN phenomenon as, for example, in the traditional unification-
by-orientation schemes, where different classes of AGN are explained on the basis of the
line-of-sight orientation with respect to the axis of rotational symmetry of the system (see,
e.g., Antonucci 1993; Urry and Padovani 1995, and references therein).
At odds with such simple schemes,evidence for a variation of the fraction of obscured AGN
as a function of luminosity has been mounting recently (Ueda et al. 2003; Steffen et al. 2003;
Simpson 2005; Hasinger 2008). The fraction of absorbed AGN, defined in different and often
independent ways, appears to be lower at higher nuclear luminosities. This might be considered
a signature of AGN feedback (in the “quasar” mode, see >Sect. 4.6 below), in that powerful
sources are able to clean up their immediate gaseous environment, responsible for the nuclear
obscuration, more efficiently.
After accounting for such a clear luminosity dependence,it is currently unclear whether the
overall incidence of obscuration and extinction in the nuclear regions of a galaxy evolve with
redshift. This would be expected if, for example, nuclear obscuration were causally linked to the
overall amount of gas within galaxies, a quantity that increases obviously with redshift.
What we are interested in here, however, is any possible evidence of redshift evolution (or
lack thereof) of the intrinsic AGN spectral properties, that is, those characterizing the emission
processes associated with the major mode of radiative energy release.
X-ray emission is ubiquitous in AGN and is a very effective way for selecting accreting
black holes due both to the minimal contamination of star-forming processes and due to the
decreasing importance of obscuration at increasing X-ray energies. Unfortunately, the exact
mechanism responsible for AGN X-ray emission and its physical location are not fully under-
stood yet (see
>Chap. 7 in this book). Still, as a very general diagnostic, the “X-ray loudness,”
usually characterized by the αox parameter, that is, the slope of the spectrum between 2,500
Å= eV and 2 keV: αox = .log(FkeV/F,) can be used to characterize the fraction
of bolometric light carried away by high-energy X-ray photons. Recent studies of large samples
of both X-ray and optical selected AGN have clearly demonstrated that αox is itself a function of
UV luminosity (see, e.g., Steffen et al. 2006; Young et al. 2009). However, no redshift evolution
can be discerned in the data, as shown in the left panel of >Fig. 11-3.

Moreover, large collecting-area X-ray telescopes allow a more precise determination of the
X-ray spectra of AGN, which are usually characterized by a power law, upon which emis-
sion lines and absorption features are superimposed. Up to the highest redshift where reliable
spectral analysis of AGN can be performed, no clear sign of evolution in the X-ray spectral slope
Γ has been detected (see the right panel of >Fig. 11-3).
Similarly, while the narrow iron Kα emission line, the most prominent feature in AGN X-ray
spectra, is clearly dependent on luminosity (the so-called Iwasawa–Taniguchi effect; (1993)), it
shows no sign of evolution in its equivalent width with redshift, at least up to z ≃.(>Fig. 11-4;
Chaudhary et al. 2010, and references therein).
Even more surprising is the lack of evolution in the optical emission line properties of QSOs.
The metallicities implied by the relative strength of broad emission lines do not show any signif-
icant redshift evolution: They are solar or super-solar, even in the highest redshift QSOs known
(see, e.g., Hamann and Ferland 1992), in contrast with the strong evolution of the metallicity in
star-forming galaxies.
A pictorial view of this surprising uniformity is shown in the left panel of >Fig. 11-5, where
the raw spectra from ∼17,000 QSOs extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are
plotted next to each other in a sequence of increasing redshift from bottom to top. The right
panel of >Fig. 11-5 shows a direct comparison of stacked QSO spectra in three redshift intervals
(Juarez et al. 2009), where it is clear that the flux ratios among the most prominent lines stay
almost constant up to the highest redshift probed.

Summarizing, there exists a remarkably uniform set of spectral characteristics that defines
active nuclei at all epochs in the history if the universe, at least if we consider objects of a fixed
total (bolometric) luminosity. The simplest explanation is that the emission properties from
AGN, that is, those which are (in most cases, at least) set by physical processes taking place
within the gravitational sphere of influence of the central black hole, are essentially dictated by
the gas and plasma dynamics there, where the central object’s gravity dominates. We should

then expect them to be relatively insensitive to the cosmological epoch, which instead greatly
affects the properties of matter (density, temperature, ionization state, etc.) at the generic outer
boundary, that is, right outside the SMBH gravitational sphere of influence.

Cosmography and Demography
Accreting supermassive black holes have long been the lighthouses of our observable universe,
holding the record of the most distant object known for more than four decades. As such, they
have played a key role in the early phases of cosmological investigations.
Already in 1955, the second Cambridge catalog (2C) of unresolved radio sources (the so-
called radio stars) observed at 81 MHz (3.7 m) had shown both a remarkable uniformity in the
distribution of objects in the sky and an increase in the cumulative number counts (see below)
that allowed Ryle and Scheuer (1955) to unambiguously demonstrate not only their extragalac-
tic origin but also that the bulk of the sources should lie at distances larger than a few tens of
Mpc, that is, well beyond the edge of the optically observable universe at the time.
The dispute over the exact shape of the radio sources number count distribution that ensued
soon afterward became a key part of the debate between “steady state” and “evolutionary” mod-
els of the universe, lending strong support against stationary universe models (see >Fig. 11-6).

by the steady state cosmological model assuming two possible luminosity functions, given the
observed sources. A clear discrepancy emerged between observations and non-evolving universe
models. A more detailed discussion of current constraints on radio sources number counts is given
in >Sect. 2.1.1

512 11
Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
Just 2 years after the discovery of quasars (Schmidt 1963) with their exceedingly large redshifts,
A. Sandage wrote: “The objects would seem to be of major importance in the solution of the cos-
mological problem. They can be found at great distances because of their high luminosity. Studies
of the [number counts] curves using [quasars] should eventually provide a crucial test of various
cosmological models” (Sandage 1965). Similar hopes were expressed by Longair a few months
later (Longair 1966).
However, as we will discuss in more detail in the following sections, quasars and radiogalaxy
source counts demonstrated clearly that the populations being studied did evolve strongly with
cosmic epoch: The number of quasars per unit comoving volume was clearly larger in the past,
so that the information about the geometry of the universe and the cosmological parameters is
buried underneath that about the evolution of the AGN themselves.
Progress in characterizing the intrinsic evolution of the QSO population effectively
quenched the hope to use black holes as ideal tracers of the structure of the universe, but opened
up the study of the evolution of growing supermassive black holes, that we outline below.
2.1 From Number Counts to Luminosity Functions
By number counts, one typically means the surface density in the sky of a given class of sources
as a function of the limiting flux of the observations. In astronomy, this is the simplest observa-
tional tool that can be used tostudythe evolution ofa sample of objects (and totest cosmological
models).
The space density of sources of different intrinsic luminosities, L, is described by the lumi-
nosity function (LF), ϕ(L), so that dN = ϕ(L)dL is the number of sources per unit volume
with luminosity in the range L to L + dL. Let us consider, for simplicity, the local or nearby
(Euclidean) universe uniformly filled with sources with LF ϕ(L). If S is the limiting flux that
we can detect, sources with luminosity L can be observed out to a distance r = (L/πS)/. The
number of sources over the solid angle Ω, observable down to the flux S are
N(> S) = ∫
Ω
rϕ(L)dL =
Ω
(π)/S−/∫L/ϕ(L)dL .
(11.1)
Thus, independent of the exact shape of the luminosity function entering in the
determination of a normalization constant, the slope of the cumulative number counts of
any non-evolving class of sources in a uniform, Euclidean universe should always be equal
to d log N(>S)/d log S = −/(if we use magnitudes, m, instead of luminosities, then d log
N(> m)/dm = .).
In general, the correct relativistic expression for number counts differs from the Euclidean
one because (a) the observed flux density depends upon the spectrum of the source, as
the radiation emitted at frequency νis observed at the redshifted frequency ν= ν/(+ z),
and (b) curvature effects modify the volume element per unit redshift, making it smaller with
increasing z. Overall, for typical source spectra which are not too strongly “inverted” (i.e., with
flux density increasing with increasing frequency), the combination of these effects makes it
more and more difficult to detect sources at progressively higher redshift and causes number
counts to have slopes always shallower than the Euclidean one (see, e.g., Longair 2008, Chap-
ter 17). As we will see below, strong evolutionary effects (i.e., luminosity functions changing
rapidly with time) can counteract such a behavior.

Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei 11
513
Before proceeding, a brief introduction of common terminology widely adopted in the
study of luminosity function evolution is necessary. The simplest and most general approach
describes an evolving luminosity function with the aid of two functions, fl(z) and fd(z),
that take into account the evolution of the luminosity and number density of the sources,
respectively:
ϕ(L, z) = fd(z)ϕ(L/fl(z), z = ).
(11.2)
In the pure luminosity evolution (PLE) case (fd = const.), the comoving number density of
sources is constant, but luminosity varies with cosmic epoch; in the pure density evolution (PDE)
case (fl = const.), but the comoving density of sources of any luminosity varies.
In the following sections, we will discuss the observational state of the art as far as AGN
number counts and luminosity functions are concerned, in the radio, X-rays, and optical/IR
bands. More comprehensive and specialized reviews have, of course, been published. In par-
ticular, we refer to the recent work by de Zotti et al. (2010) for a discussion of observations at
radio wavelengths, Croom et al. (2009) for optical QSOs, and to Brandt and Hasinger (2005)
for X-ray studies.
2.1.1 The Evolution of Radio AGN
>Figure 11-7 shows a compilation of cumulative source number counts from a large number of
surveys in different radio bands (data points from Massardi et al. 2010, see references therein).
On the bottom x-axis, the total radio flux is expressed as SR ≡νSν (where Sν is the observed
radio flux density at any given radio frequency ν) in cgs units, while the top axis shows the
corresponding radio flux density at 1.4 GHz. Overall, the shape of the radio counts is similar
in all bands, indicating the relative lack of spectral complexity of radio AGN. This is best seen
when normalizing the observed counts to the Euclidean slope, as shown in the top panel.
At bright fluxes, counts rise more steeply than S−/. This was already discovered by the
first radio surveys at meter wavelengths (Ryle and Scheuer 1955), as we have discussed above,
lending strong support for evolutionary cosmological models,as opposed to theories of a steady
state universe (see >Fig. 11-6).
At fluxes fainter than about a Jansky3 (or ≈−ergs s−cm−at 1 GHz), the counts increase
less steeply than S−/, being dominated by sources at high redshift, thus probing a substantial
volume of the observable universe.
At flux densities above one mJy, the population of radio sources is largely composed by
AGN. For these sources, the observed radio emission includes the classical extended jet and
double lobe radio sources as well as compact radio components more directly associated with
the energy generation and collimation near the central engine.
The deepest radio surveys, however, (see, e.g., Padovani et al. 2009 and references therein),
probing well into the sub-mJy regime, clearly show a further steepening of the counts. The
nature ofthis change is not completelyunderstood yet, but in general, it is attributed tothe emer-
gence of a new class of radio sources, most likely that of star-forming galaxies and/or radio quiet
AGN. Unambiguous solutions of the population constituents at those faint flux levels require
not only identification of the (optical/IR) counterparts of such faint radio sources but also a
3A Jansky (named after Karl Jansky, who first discovered the existence of radio waves from space) is a flux
measure, corresponding to −ergs cm−Hz−.

A compilation of cumulative radio source counts (number of objects brighter than a given ﬂux per

also references therein). On the bottom horizontal axis the total radio ﬂux SR = νSν in CGS units is
shown, while the top horizontal axis shows the corresponding ﬂux density in Jansky, where ν1.4 is
the frequency of 1.4 GHz. The bottom panel shows the observed counts, while the top panel shows
the counts after the Euclidean slope has been factored out
robust understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed emission both
at radio and optical/IR wavelengths.
Thus, the complex shape of the observed number counts provides clues about the evolution
of radio AGN, as well as on their physical nature, even before undertaking the daunting task
of identifying substantial fractions of the observed sources, determining their distances, and
translating the observed density of sources in the redshift-luminosity plane into a (evolving)
luminosity function. Pioneering work from Longair (1966) already demonstrated that, in order
to reproduce the narrowness of the observed “bump” in the normalized counts around Jy seen
in >Fig. 11-7, only the most luminous sources could evolve strongly with redshift. This was
probably the first direct hint of the intimate nature of the differential evolution AGN undergo
over cosmological times.

Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei 11
515
Indeed, many early investigations of high-redshift radio luminosity functions (see, e.g.,
Danese et al. 1987) demonstrated that neither PLE nor PDE models could explain the observed
evolution of radio sources, with more powerful sources (often of FRII morphology, see
>Chap. 7)displaying a farmore dramaticrise in theirnumberdensities with increasing redshift
(see also Willott et al. 2001).
Trying to assess the nature of radio AGN evolution across larger redshift ranges requires
a careful evaluation of radio spectral properties of AGN. Steeper synchrotron spectra are pro-
duced in the extended lobes of radio jets, while flat spectra are usually associated with compact
cores. For objects at distances such that no radio morphological information is available, the
combination of observing frequency, K-corrections, intrinsic source variability, and orientation
of the jet with respect to the line of sight may all contribute to severe biases in the determination
of the comoving number densities of sources, especially at high redshift (Wall et al. 2005).
In a very extensive and equally influential work, Dunlop and Peacock (1990) studied the
evolution of the luminosity functions of steep, and flat-spectrum sources separately. They
showed that the overall redshift evolution of the two classes of sources were similar, with steep-
spectrum sources outnumbering flat ones by almost a factor of 10. Uncertainties remained
regarding the possibility of a high-redshift decline of radio AGN number densities. The issue is
still under discussion, with the most clear evidence for such a decline observed for flat-spectrum
radio QSO at z > (Wall et al. 2005), consistent with the most recent findings of optical and
X-ray surveys (see also >Sect. 5 below).
Under the simplifying assumption that the overall radio AGN population can be subdivided
into steep- and flat-spectrum sources, characterized by a power-law synchrotron spectrum
Sν ∝ν−α, with slope αflat = .and αsteep = ., respectively, a redshift-dependent luminosity
function can be derived for the two populations separately, by fitting simple models to a very
large and comprehensive set of data on multifrequency source counts and redshift distributions
obtained by radio surveys at ν < GHz (Massardi et al. 2010). The comoving number densities
in bins of increasing radio power (at 1.4 GHz) from the resulting best-fit luminosity function
models are shown in the left panel of >Fig. 11-8.
Radio AGN, both with steep and flat spectrum, show the distinctive feature of a dif-
ferential density evolution, with the most powerful objects evolving more strongly toward
higher redshift, a phenomenological trend that, in the current cosmologist jargon, is called
“downsizing.”
Recent radio observational campaigns of large multiwavelength sky surveys have also cor-
roborated this view, by providing a much more detailed picture of low-luminosity radio AGN.
For example, the work of Smolˇci´c et al. (2009) on the COSMOS field showed that radio galaxies
with L.GHz < few × WHz−evolve up to z ≃, but much more mildly than their more
luminous counterparts, as shown in the right panel of >Fig. 11-8.
2.1.2 X-Ray Surveys and the Resolution of the X-Ray Background
As already mentioned, active galactic nuclei are powerful X-ray emitters. The discovery of the
intense cosmic X-ray background radiation (CXRB; Giacconi et al. 1962) in the early 1960s
opened up a privileged window for the study of the energetic phenomena associated with
accretion onto black holes.
Due to the relative weakness of X-ray emission from stars and stellar remnants (magnet-
ically active stars, cataclysmic variables, and, more importantly, X-ray binaries are the main

stellar X-ray sources), the X-ray sky is almost completely dominated by the evolving SMBH
population, at least down to the faintest fluxes probed by current X-ray focusing telescopes. The
goal of reaching a complete census of evolving AGN and thus of the accretion power released by
SMBH in the history of the universe has therefore been intertwined with that of fully resolving
the CXRB into individual sources. Accurate determinations of the CXRB intensity and spectral
shape, coupled with the resolution of this radiation into individual sources, allow very sensitive
tests of how the AGN luminosity and obscuration evolve with redshift.
New generations of synthesis models of the CXRB (Gilli et al. 2007; Treister et al. 2009)
have quickly followed the publication of increasingly larger and deeper surveys (for the current
deepest view of the X-ray sky, see >Fig. 11-9). >Figure 11-10 shows a recent compilation of the
CXRB measurements together with one incarnation of a synthesis model (Treister et al. 2009)
of AGN evolution that explains those data. The hard slope of the background spectrum (well
described by a power law with photon index ΓCXRB ≃.at E < keV) and the prominent peak
at about 30 keV are accounted for by assuming that the majority of active galactic nuclei are in
fact obscured.
These new models have progressively reduced the uncertainties in the absorbing column
density distribution. When combined with the observed X-ray luminosity functions, they pro-
vide an almost complete census of the Compton-thin AGN (i.e., those obscured by columns

CXRB radiation below ∼5 keV into individual sources, the vast majority of which are accreting
supermassive black holes (From Xue et al. 2011)
dominates the counts in the lower energy X-ray energy band, where almost the entire CXRB
radiation has been resolved into individual sources (Worsley et al. 2005). It should be noted,
however, that at the peak energy of the observed CXRB radiation, only a small fraction (less
than 5%) of the emission has so far been resolved into individual objects.
CXRB synthesis models, like the one shown in >Fig. 11-10, ascribe a substantial fraction of
this unresolved emission to heavily obscured (Compton thick) AGN. However, because of their
faintness even at hard X-ray energies, their redshift and luminosity distribution is essentially
unknown, and even their absolute contribution to the overall CXRB sensitively depends on the
quite uncertain normalization of the unresolved emission at hard X-ray energies. The quest
for the physical characterization of this “missing” AGN population, most likely dominated by
Compton-thick AGN, represents one of the last current frontiers of the study of AGN evolution
at X-ray wavelengths.
Putting together the observational data from a large suite of complementary sur-
veys, >Fig. 11-11 shows a compilation of X-ray number counts, for both soft (0.5–2 keV) and
hard (2–10 keV) selected samples.

and dashed gray lines are two diﬀerent CXRB spectral models proposed in the literature depending
on the assumed normalization of the HEAO 1; the main diﬀerence is the number of Compton-thick
AGNs, which is reduced by a factor of 4 if the black solid line is assumed instead of the dashed one
(Adopted from Treister et al. (2009), where a complete list of references of the data points shown is
presented)
Given the steepfrequencydependence ofphotoelectricabsorption cross sections, the harder
the energy band probed, the less affected by obscuration the objects under study are. Current
technologies provide the best compromise between telescope effective area and energy range
in the 2–10-keV band. Indeed, the density of AGN detected in this band is higher than that of
0.5–2-keV selected ones, by at least a factor of 3.
As for the radio log N-log S of >Fig. 11-7, the counts become shallower than the Euclidean
slope at intermediatefluxes (about −ergs s−cm−), where the largest relative fraction of the
CXRB is produced. Tentative evidence of a steepening at the lowest fluxes might indicate the
emergence of a different, non-AGN, population of star-forming galaxies whose X-ray emission
is primarily due to stars and stellar remnants.

mented by the painstaking work of optical identification and redshift determination of the

AGN luminosity function. Neither PLE nor PDE provides a satisfactory description of the X-ray
LF evolution, with a good fit to the data achieved with a “Luminosity dependent density evo-
lution” (LDDE) model or variations thereof. In their influential work, Hasinger et al. (2005)
unambiguously demonstrated that in the observed soft X-ray energy band, more luminous
AGN peaked at higher redshift than lower luminosity ones (see >Fig. 11-12).
A good enough sampling of the luminosity redshift plane necessary for accurate LF stud-
ies requires more extensive observational efforts in the hard X-ray band, as obscured AGN are
more difficult to identify (and to obtain redshifts for) in the optical band. Nonetheless, the gen-
eral “downsizing” trend illustrated by the soft-X-ray selected AGN of >Fig. 11-12 has so far
been confirmed by almost all recent studies of (2–10 keV) X-ray selected AGN (see, e.g., Ueda
et al. 2003; Barger et al. 2005).

2.1.3 Optical and Infrared Studies of QSOs
Bright AGN emit a large fraction of their bolometric luminosity in the optical/UV part
of the spectrum (see
> Chap. 7). For Eddington ratios (λ ≡Lbol/LEdd, where LEdd =
πGMBHmpc/σT ≃.× (MBH/M⊙) ergs s−is the Eddington luminosity) larger than a
few percent, the AGN light outshines the emission from the host galaxy, resulting in point-like
emission with peculiar blue colors.
Finding efficient ways to select QSO in large optical surveys, trying to minimize contamina-
tion from stars, white dwarfs, and brown dwarfs has been a primary goal of optical astronomers
since the realization that QSO were extragalactic objects often lying at cosmological distances
(Schmidt and Green 1983; Richards et al. 2006).
Optical surveys remain an extremely powerful tool to uncover the evolution of unobscured
QSOs up to the highest redshift (z ∼). In terms of sheer numbers, the known population
of SMBH is dominated by such optically selected AGN (e.g., more that QSOs have been
identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey), essentially due to the yet unsurpassed capability of
ground-based optical telescopes to perform wide-field, deep surveys of the extragalactic sky.

largest recent optical surveys (2SLAQ, 2QZ, and SDSS), for objects in the redshift range .<

at bright fluxes, followed by a turnover at around g ≃. A comparison with > Figs. 11-7

a number density of sources in the sky more than one order of magnitude smaller that those
probed by the deepest X-ray and radio surveys.
Thus, the dominant AGN population eludes systematic detection in optical surveys. In gen-
eral terms, the difficulty of optical QSO surveys to probe deep into the AGN population is due
to two major effects: The first one is the already mentioned issue of nuclear obscuration, dra-
matically affecting the UV/optical appearance of AGN; the second is galaxy dilution of the AGN
light (and of the broad emission line signature often used to select quasars). More specifically,
let us consider an AGN with B-band luminosity given by LAGN,B = λLEdd fB, with bolometric
correction fB ≈.(Richards et al. 2006). Assuming a bulge-to-black hole mass ratio of 0.001
and a bulge-to-total galactic stellar mass ratio of (B/T), the contrast between nuclear AGN
continuum and host galaxy blue light is given by

Thus, for typical mass-to-light ratios, the AGN will become increasingly diluted by the host
stellar light at Eddington ratios λ smaller than a few percent.

have so far only been possible in the very local universe. At higher redshift, the deepest multi-
wavelength AGN-galaxy surveys to date are starting to probe AGN luminosities such that the
contribution of the host galaxy to the overall SED cannot be neglected. This compromises the
efficiency and “cleanness” of AGN selection at optical/IR wavelength but opens up the possibil-
ity of studying the connection between nuclear black hole activity and host galaxy properties.
We will come back more extensively in >Sect. 3.2 to the issue of the overall decomposition of
the AGN–galaxy spectral energy distribution in large multiwavelength surveys.
As for the general evolution of the optically selected QSO luminosity function, it has been
known for a long time that luminous QSOs were much more common at high redshift (z ∼).
Nevertheless, it is only with the aid of the aforementioned large and deep surveys covering a
wide enough area ofthe distance-luminosityplane that it was possible toput sensible constraints
on the character of the observed evolution. The most recent attempts (Croom et al. 2009) have
shown unambiguously that optically selected AGN do not evolve according to a simple PLE,
but instead more luminous objects peaked in their number densities at redshifts higher than
lower luminosity objects, as shown in the left panel of >Fig. 11-14.
We close this section with a brief discussion of the current status of IR AGN LF studies.
According to the AGN unification paradigm, obscuration comes from optically thick dust
blocking the central engine along some lines of sight. The temperature in this structure, which

can range up to 1,000 K (the typical dust sublimation temperature), and the roughly isotropic
emission toward longer wavelengths should make both obscured and unobscured AGNs very
bright in the mid- to far-infrared bands. This spectral shift of absorbed light to the IR has
allowed sensitive mid-infrared observatories (IRAS, ISO, Spitzer) to deliver large numbers of
AGN (see, e.g., Treister et al. 2006).
The problem with IR studies of AGN evolution, however, lies neither in the efficiency with
which growing supermassive black holes can be found nor with the completeness of the AGN
selection, which is clearly high and (almost) independent of nuclear obscuration but rather
in the level of contamination. IR counts are, in fact, dominated by star-forming galaxies at all
fluxes. This, and the lack of clear spectral signatures in the nuclear, AGN-powered emission in
this band, implies that secure identification of AGN in any IR-selectedcatalog often necessitates
additional information from other wavelengths, usually radio, X-rays, or optical spectroscopy.
Indeed, unlike the case of the CXRB, AGN contribute only a small fraction (up to 2–10%)
of the cosmic IR background radiation (Treister et al. 2006), and similar fractions are estimated
for the contribution of AGN at the “knee” of the total IR luminosity function at all redshifts.
Nonetheless, tremendous progress has been achieved in recent years, thanks to more refined
color-selection criteria (Stern et al. 2005) that are little affected by contamination and provide
reliable AGN samples, albeit with some well understood completeness biases against AGN that
are faint with respect to their hosts and z ∼4.5 type 1 AGN.
Thus, deep surveys with extensive multiwavelength coverage can still be used to track the
evolution of active galaxies in the mid-infrared (see, e.g., Assef et al. 2011). Strengthening sim-
ilar conclusions discussed above from other wavelengths, IR-selected AGN do not appear to
evolve following either the PLE or PDE parametrizations but require significant differences in
the evolution of bright and faint sources, with the number density of the former declining more
steeply with decreasing redshift than that of the latter (see the right panel in >Fig. 11-14).
2.1.4 Bolometric Luminosity Functions
We have seen in the previous sections how a qualitatively consistent picture of the main features
of AGN evolution is emerging from the largest surveys of the sky in various energy bands.
Strong (positive) redshift evolution of the overall number density as well as marked differential
evolution (with more luminous sources being more dominant at higher redshift) characterizes
the evolution of AGN.
Fundamental constraints on the physical evolution of the accretion-powered emission over
cosmological times, like the ones we will discuss laterin >Sect. 3, require, ideally, a good knowl-
edge ofthe bolometric luminosityfunction ofAGN. This, in turn, demands a detailed assessment
of selection biases and a robust estimation of the AGN spectral energy distribution (SED).
A thorough and detailed understanding of the AGN SED as a function of luminosity (and,
possibly, of redshift, but see > Sect. 1.1 above) could in principle allow us to compare and
cross-correlate the information on the AGN evolution gathered in different bands. As for the
accuracy of our knowledge of the bolometric correction, we refer the reader to the studies of
Marconi et al. (2004), Richards et al. (2006), and Hopkins et al. (2007). All of them consistently
demonstrate that a luminosity-dependent bolometric correction is required in order to match
type I (unabsorbed) AGN luminosity functions obtained by selecting objects in different bands.
Summarizing the discussion of the previous sections, > Fig. 11-15 shows a compilation
of luminosity functions observed at various wavelengths. The observed mismatch among the

various LF observed at all redshift is due to a combination of different bolometric correc-
tions and incompleteness due to obscuration. In fact, adopting a general form of luminosity-
dependent bolometric correction, and with a relatively simple parametrization of the effect of
the obscuration bias on the observed LF, Hopkins et al. (2007) were able to project the dif-
ferent observed luminosity functions in various bands into a single bolometric one, ϕ(Lbol)
(> Fig. 11-17). As a corollary from such an exercise, we can then provide a simple figure of
merit for AGN selection in various bands by measuring the bolometric energy density associ-
ated with AGN selected in that particular band as a function of redshift. We show this in the left
panel of >Fig. 11-16 for four specific bands (hard X-rays, soft X-rays, UV, and mid-IR). From
this, it is obvious that the reduced incidence of absorption in the 2–10-keV band makes the
hard X-ray surveys recover a higher fraction of the accretion power generated in the universe
than any other method.
While optical QSO surveys miss more than three quarters of all AGN of any given Lbol, hard
X-ray selection only fails to account for about one third (up to 50%) of all AGN, the most heavily
obscured (Compton thick) ones, as shown in the right panel of >Fig. 11-16. A common feature
apparent from such a figure is that the effects of obscuration appear to be more severe at lower
intrinsic luminosities, an observational fact that has been discussed previously in the context
of X-ray surveys of AGN (see >Sect. 1.1 above). It is important to note that the high missed
fraction for mid-IR-selected AGN is a direct consequence of the need for (usually optical) AGN
identification of the IR sources, so that optically obscured active nuclei are by and large missing
in the IR AGN luminosity functions considered here.

increase in AGN activity with redshift, up to z ≈, and the mirroring high-redshift decline.
At the center, the total integrated luminosity density evolution mark the epochs of rapid build
up of the SMBH mass density. On the lower left, the evolution in the break luminosity Lbol,∗
indicates that the “typical” accreting black holes were significantly more luminous at z ≈than
now, a different way of looking at AGN “downsizing.” This is accompanied by a progressive
steepening of the faint-end slope of the LF (upper left panel): Low-luminosity AGN become
more and more dominant in the overall number density of AGN as time progresses.
Such a detailed view of the evolution of active galactic nuclei, with its distinctive signatures
of “downsizing,” has lent additional support to the notion that the lives of growing black holes
must be intimately linked to those of their host galaxies. Indeed, both galaxies and black holes
show signs of a similar differential evolution. The very term “downsizing” was first used by
Cowie et al. (1996) to describe the finding that actively star-forming galaxies at low redshift
have smaller masses than actively star-forming galaxies at z ∼. It has come to identify, in
the current cosmology jargon, a variety of possibly distinct phenomena, not just related to the
epoch of star formation, but also to that of star-formation quenching or galaxy assembly (see
> Chap. 10). Our current understanding of AGN evolution, encapsulated in the observable
evolution of their bolometric luminosity function, emphatically suggests that growing nuclear
black holes take part in this global process of structure formation.
2.2 AGN Clustering and the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
The bolometric luminosity function of AGN provides the basic tool to describe the differential
evolution of growing black holes. Some key properties of AGN, however, remain impossible
to determine on the sole basis of the observed LF. As it is increasingly difficult to measure
black hole masses at high redshift, and currently only possible for bright, unobscured broad
line QSOs, we do not have robust, direct, observational constraints on the distribution of AGN
Eddington ratios beyond the local universe. The Eddington ratio distribution, in turn, depends
on the details of the average AGN lightcurves which could reveal important details of the
physical processes driving the accreting gas toward the black hole.
The spatial distribution of QSOs (clustering) in the sky could provide such an alternative
method to estimate lifetimes (Martini and Weinberg 2001; see also
>Chap. 8). In the current
ΛCDM paradigm for structure formation, more clustered objects are rarer and live in more
massive dark matter structures (or “halos”). Thus, if AGN are strongly clustered, their hosts
must be rare objects, too, and the effective AGN lifetime must be long, in order for such a
rare “parent” population to account for the total AGN luminosity density observed. If, on the
other hand, their clustering is comparable to the clustering of smaller, less massive, dark mat-
ter halos, their host are more common and their luminous phases must therefore have short
duration.
A commonly used technique for measuring the spatial clustering of a class of objects is the
two-point correlation function ξ(r), which measures the excess probability dP above a random
distribution of finding an object in a volume element dV at a distance r from another randomly
chosen object:
dP = n[+ ξ(r)]dV.
(11.4)

Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei 11
529
where n is the mean number density of objects. In the scale range between a few tens of kpc and
a few tens of Mpc, for most classes of astronomical objects ξ(r) can be described by a single
power law:
ξ(r) = ( r
r
)
−γ
.
(11.5)
where ris the correlation, or clustering, length, defined as the scale at which the two-point
correlation function is equal to unity.
Unfortunately, a direct comparison of the measured clustering length of AGN with that
expected for dark matter halos of different masses is hampered by the fact that, according to
current theories of structure formation, galaxies (and their nuclear black holes) do not follow
the distribution of the underlying matter but form in the high-density peaks of the dark matter
field. The bias of any astrophysical population X is defined as the (square root of the) ratio
between the two-point autocorrelation functions of population X and of the dark matter (DM)
halos: bX,DM(r) ≡
√
ξX(r)/ξDM(r).
Many groups have now been able to measure the clustering of AGN at different luminosities,
bands, scales, and redshifts (see, e.g., the recent review of Shankar 2009 for a complete list of
references). Overall, the clustering length of quasars appears to be an increasing function of
redshift but does not depend strongly on luminosity.
As shown in >Fig. 11-19, the bias of optically selected (broad line) AGN increases with
redshift following an evolution at approximately constant dark matter halo mass (since halos of
a fixed mass are progressively more clustered toward higher redshift), in the range log MDM ≃
.–13 h−M⊙at redshifts z < ..
Instead, X-ray selected objects (Allevato et al. 2011), both obscured and unobscured, reside
in more massive DM structures at all redshifts z < ., with a typical mass of the hosting halos
constant over time in the range logMDM ≃–13.5 h−M⊙.
By combining the number density of AGN with that of the hosting dark matter halos,
one can estimate an AGN duty cycle and a corresponding average lifetime. The observed
biases of the rare, luminous broad-lined quasars imply timescales of the order of –
years, increasing with redshift, as the massive halos typically hosting AGN become increasingly
rare.
For X-ray selected AGN, a larger duty cycle is inferred, which translates into an AGN life-
time of ∼0.1–1 Gyr, about one order of magnitude longer than that estimated for optically bright
QSOs at the same redshift. This is mainly due to the higher number density and higher bias of
AGN found in X-ray selected samples.
Numerical simulations of merger-induced AGN activity in a cosmological context have
shown (Bonoli et al. 2009) that the clustering of optically selected quasars is well explained
by a model in which these objects are triggered by major merger events. The difference between
optically selected and the (lower luminosity) X-ray selected AGN of >Fig. 11-19 might suggest
that X-ray selected AGN are triggered by different (secular) processes which may be capable of
fueling luminous AGN in the gas-rich environment of star-forming galaxies at high redshift.
The same models also predict an increase in AGN duty cycle for the brightest quasars at halo
masses larger than M⊙but fail to reproduce the large biases for less luminous X-ray selected
AGN at z ∼, possibly pointing (again) toward the need for a larger variety of AGN triggering
mechanisms for this class of objects.

Cosmology I: The Growth of Supermassive Black Holes in
Galaxies
As we have discussed in the previous section, the strong cosmological evolution of the quasar
population was recognized early on by observers in essentially all bands of the electromagnetic
spectrum. In the early 1990s, deep optical surveys of star-forming galaxies began to probe the
cosmological evolution of the rate at which stars are formed within galaxies, thus providing
robust constraints for models of galaxy formation and evolution (the so-called Lilly–Madau
plot; Madau et al. 1996). It was soon clear that QSOs luminosity density and star formation rate
(SFR) density evolved in similar fashion, being much higher in the past, with a possible (very
broad) peak at z ≈(Boyle and Terlevich 1998).
In the previous section, we have traced the history of the study of AGN luminosity func-
tions in various spectral bands, closing with an assessment of our current understanding of the
bolometric luminosity function evolution. A reliable census of the bolometric energy output of
growing supermassive black holes (see, e.g., the central bottom panel of >Fig. 11-18) allows a
more direct estimate of the global rate of mass assembly in AGN and an interesting compar-
ison with that of stars in galaxies. Together with the tighter constraints on the “relic” SMBH

mass density in the local universe, ρBH,, provided by careful application of the scaling relations
between black hole masses and host spheroids, this enables meaningful tests of the classical
“Soltan argument” (Soltan 1982), according to which the local mass budget of black holes in
galactic nuclei should be accounted for by integrating the overall energy density released by
AGN, with an appropriate mass-to-energy conversion efficiency.
Many authors have carried out such a calculation, either using the CXRB as a “bolometer”
to derive the total energy density released by the accretion process (Fabian and Iwasawa 1999)
or by considering evolving AGN luminosity functions (Yu and Tremaine 2002; Marconi et al.
2004; Merloni and Heinz 2008). Despite some tension among the published results that can be
traced back to the particular choice of AGN LF and/or scaling relation assumed to derive the
local mass density, it is fair to say that this approach represents a major success of the standard
paradigm of accreting black holes as AGN power sources, as the radiative efficiencies needed to
explain the relic population are within the range ≈0.06–0.20, predicted by standard relativistic
accretion disc theory (Novikov and Thorne 1973).
In this section, we begin with a schematic account of the current constraints on the black
hole mass density growth and discuss some recent attempts to compare it on a quantitative
level with the observed growth of the galaxy population. This will be followed by the (related)
discussion of the possible evolution of the scaling relations.
3.1 A Global View of the Accretion History of the Universe
Under the standard assumption that black holes grow mainly by accretion, their cosmic evo-
lution can be calculated from the bolometric luminosity function of AGN ϕ(Lbol, z), where
Lbol = єrad ˙Mcis the bolometric luminosity produced by an SMBH accreting at a rate of ˙M with
a radiative efficiency єrad. The non-negligible fraction of the AGN population which is unac-
counted for in current surveys, the so-called Compton-thick AGN (see >Sect. 2.1.2 above), is
usually included in the bolometric luminosity function by assuming a redshift-invariant col-
umn density distribution as measured in the very local universe and an overall number density
of heavily obscured AGN that fits the CXRB.
The total, integrated mass density in supermassive black holes can then be computed as a
function of redshift:

(11.8)
The exact shape of ρBH(z) and ΨBH(z) then depends only on the local black hole mass density
ρBH,and the (average) radiative efficiency єrad.

532 11
Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
We can then link the growth of SMBH from (>11.6) to the growth of stellar mass in galaxies.
To do so, we will use the Hopkins et al. (2007) bolometric LF of AGN (see >Sect. 2.1.4 above).4
Because local SMBH are observed to correlate with spheroids only, we introduce the parameter
λ(z), the ratio of the mass in discs, and irregulars to that in spheroids at any redshift, so that the
total stellar mass density can be expressed as ρ∗(z) = ρsph(z)+ρdisk+irr(z) = ρsph(z)[+λ(z)].
We can now assumethat λ(z) evolves according to λ(z) = λ(+z)−β, where λis the value
of the disc to spheroid mass density ratio in the local universe. Also, we assume that the mass
density of spheroids and supermassive black holes evolve in parallel, modulo a factor (+ z)−α,
obtaining a prediction for the observable stellar mass density evolution as traced by SMBH
growth:
ρ∗(z) = AρBH(єrad, z)(+ z)−α[+ λ(+ z)−β].
(11.9)
where Ais the constant of proportionality in the SMBH mass–spheroid mass relation. By tak-
ing the derivative of (> 11.9), accounting for stellar mass loss, an expression is also found for
the corresponding star formation rate (SFR) density evolution:
dρ∗(z)/dt = Ψ∗(z) −∫
z
zi
Ψ∗(z′)d χ[Δt(z′ −z)]
dt
dt
dz′ dz′,
(11.10)
where χ[Δt(z′−z)] is the fractional mass loss that a simple stellar population experiences after a
time Δt (corresponding to the redshift interval (z′−z)), and zi is the redshift of (instantaneous)
formation of the first stellar populations.5
With these expressions, we fit observational data points of both ρ∗(z) and SFR(z). For
each choice of ρBH,, λ, and of the critical accretion rate ˙mcr, the fitting functions depend only
on three parameters: α, β, and the radiative efficiency єrad. One example of such fits is shown
in >Fig. 11-20 for the specific case ρBH,= .× M⊙Mpc−(Shankar 2009), and λ= .
(Fukugita and Peebles 2004).
Because the drop in the AGN integrated luminosity density at low z is apparently fasterthan
that in the SFR density, the average black hole to spheroid mass ratio must evolve (slightly) with
lookback time (α > ). This result is independent of the local black hole mass density and inde-
pendent of λ. For the particular example shown here, the average radiative efficiency turns out
to be єrad = .+.
−., while we obtain α = .+.
−.(both shown with 3-σ confidence bounds).
At face value, this would imply a very mild evolution of the average MBH/Msph mass ratio.
We will discuss in >Sect. 3.2.1 how these constraints compare with recent efforts to directly
measure the ratio of black hole to host galaxy mass at high redshift.
This simple exercise should make clear that the available constraints on SMBH growth from
the observed bolometric LF are robust enough to provide interesting nontrivial insight into the
cosmological coevolution of AGN and galaxies.
3.1.1 The Evolution of the SMBH Mass Function
Despite the relative successes of “Soltan argument” – like calculations of the integral evolution
of the SMBH mass density, it is obvious that a much greater amount of information is contained
4As discussed in Marconi et al. (2004), in order to correctly estimate the total bolometric output of an AGN,
care should be taken in avoiding double counting of the IR reprocessed emission. This appears not have been
done in Hopkins et al. (2007), so we correct the bolometric luminosities by 30% to account for this.
5An analogous term for ρBH, due to the ejection of SMBHs from galaxy halos after a merger event, is much
more difficult to estimate and is neglected here.

pensated by a change in the normalization of the average black hole to spheroid mass ratio with
redshift (seetext for details). The dashed (dotted) line withred(blue)-shaded area showsthe relative
growth of the mass density in spheroids (discs). Values of λ0 = 0.3 (Fukugita and Peebles 2004) and

area.Thedash-triple-dottedlineis(1,000times)theblackholeaccretionratedensity ΨBH(z)(BHAR).
It appears that the BHAR declines slightly faster than the SFR, another way to emphasize the need
of an evolution in the average MBH/Msph ratio
in the differential distributions (mass and luminosity functions). We will now discuss attempts
to use this information to constrain the evolution of the mass function of SMBH.
As opposed to the case of galaxies, where the direct relationship between the evolving mass
functions of the various morphological types and the distribution of star-forming galaxies is
not straightforward due to the never-ending morphological and photometric transformation
of the different populations, the situation in the case of SMBH is much simpler. For the latter
case, we can assume their evolution is governed by a continuity equation (Merloni and Heinz
2008, and references therein), where the mass function of SMBH at any given time can be used
to predict the mass function at any other time, provided the distribution of accretion rates as a
function of black hole mass is known. Such an equation can be written as
∂ψ(μ, t)
∂t
+ ∂
∂μ (ψ(μ, t)⟨˙M(μ, t)⟩) = .
(11.11)
where μ = log M is the black hole mass in solar units and ψ(μ, t) is the SMBH mass function at
time t. ⟨˙M(μ, t)⟩is the average accretion rate of SMBH of mass M at time t and can be defined

534 11
Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
through a “fueling” function, F( ˙μ, μ, t), which describes the distribution of accretion rates for
objects of mass M at time t
⟨˙M(μ, t)⟩= ∫
˙MF( ˙μ, μ, t) d ˙μ,
(11.12)
Such a fueling function is not a priori known, and observational determinations thereof
have been possible in any robust sense only for the extremes of the overall population. However,
the AGN fueling function can be derived by inverting the integral equation that relates the
luminosity function of the population in question with its mass function. And so, we can write
ϕ(ℓ, t) = ∫F(ℓ−ζ, μ, t)ψ(μ, t) dμ
(11.13)
with the definitions ℓ≡log Lbol and ζ ≡log (єradc), with єrad the radiative efficiency, here
assumed to be constant.
Using this approach, ( > 11.11) can be integrated backward from z = , where we have
simultaneous knowledge of both the mass function, ψ(μ), and the luminosity function, ϕ(ℓ),
thus evolving the SMBH mass function backward in time, up to where (i) reliable estimates of
the AGN luminosity functions are available and (ii) the accumulated error in the mass function
becomes of the order of the mass function itself.
The first thing to notice from such an approach is that the different shapes of the observed
SMBH mass function ψ(μ) (that decays exponentially at high masses) and AGN LF ϕ(ℓ) (well
described by a double power law) necessitate a broad distribution of accretion rate (Merloni
and Heinz 2008): AGN, as a population, cannot be simply characterized by an on–off switch at
fixed Eddington ratio. Instead, integration of (> 11.11) gives insight on the relative importance
of massive black hole growth at different accretion rates.
>Figure 11-21 shows the number density evolution as a function of redshift for black holes
of constant mass (in the range < log(MBH/M⊙) < .) at different Eddington ratios. Numer-
ically, the AGN population is always dominated by slowly accreting objects, but the observed
flattening of the bolometric LF shape (see > Fig. 11-18) implies that the relative number of
rapidly accreting black holes increases significantly with redshift. In terms of grown mass,
however, high-Eddington-ratio AGN strongly dominate the budget, as shown in the top panel
of >Fig. 11-21: most of the mass of a typical ≈M⊙black hole has been accumulated in (short-
lived) episodes of rapid accretion, between a few and a few tens of percent of the Eddington
luminosity.
The specific instantaneous ratio of black hole mass to accretion rate as a function of SMBH
mass defines a timescale, the so-called growth time, or mass doubling time. The redshift evo-
lution of the growth time distribution can be used to identify the epochs when black holes of
different sizes grew the largest fraction of their mass: Black holes with growth times longer than
the age of the universe are not experiencing a major growth phase, which must have necessarily
happened at earlier times.
>Figure 11-22 (left) shows that, according to this simple estimate, while at z < only black
holes with masses smaller than M⊙are experiencing significant growth, as we approach the
peak of the black hole accretion rate density (z ∼.−), we witness the rapid growth of the
entire SMBH population.
Solutions of the continuity equation also allow one to trace the growth of black holes of a
given final (i.e., at z = ) mass.The right-hand side panel of >Fig. 11-22 shows that, for the most
massive black holes (>M⊙), half of the mass was already in place at z ∼, while those with
M(z = ) < M⊙had to wait until z ∼to accumulate the same fraction of their final mass.

3.2 The AGN-Galaxy Connection
The very existence of scaling relations between black holes and their host galaxies and the broad
accretion rate distributions of AGN derived from the continuity equation approach imply that,
as observed throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, growing black holes will display a large
range of “contrast” with the host galaxy light.
The most luminous QSO, accreting at the highest Eddington ratios, will be able to outshine
the stellar light from the galaxy, while less luminous, Seyfert-like AGN will have a global SED
with a non-negligible contribution from the host (see also ( > 11.3) above). At high redshift,
when it becomes increasingly difficult to spatially separate the nuclear emission, unbiased AGN
samples will have optical–NIR colors spanning a large range of intermediate possibilities.
>Figure 11-23 nicely illustrates this point. It is taken from the analysis of an X-ray selected
sample of AGN in the COSMOS field (Brusa et al. 2010), the largest fully identified and redshift
complete AGN sample to date. It displays the slope of the rest-frame SED in the optical (αOPT,
between 0.3 and 1 μm) and NIR (αNIR between 1 and 3 μm). Pure QSOs, i.e., objects in which
the overall SED is dominated by the nuclear (AGN) emission, have a typical dip in the NIR
region and would lie close to the empty blue star in the lower right corner (positive optical

instead that, in order to describe the bulk of the population, one needs to consider both the
effects of obscuration (moving each pure QSO in the direction of the orange arrow) and an
increasing contribution from stellar galaxy light (moving the objects toward the black stars in
the upper part of the diagram).
This demonstrates that current multiwavelength extragalactic surveys are sensitive enough
todisentangle the complexinterplaybetween nuclearand galaxylight in the SED ofmore typical
AGN. It is no coincidence that such surveys are beginning to probe the details of the coevolution
of black holes and host galaxies on an object-by-object basis. In the following section, we will
briefly discuss how one can use such information to observationally trace the evolution of the
scaling relations between nuclear SMBH and their host galaxies.
3.2.1 Redshift Evolution of the Scaling Relations
Local scaling relations between black hole mass and structural properties of their (spheroidal)
hosts have been unable to unambiguously determine the physical nature of the SMBH–galaxy
coupling. A large number of theoretical models for the AGN–galaxy interaction responsible for
establishing, for example, the M −σ∗relation, have been proposed, all tuned to reproduce the
z = observations. One obvious way out of this impasse is the study of their evolution.
In recent years, a number of groups have employed different techniques to detect signs of
evolution in any of the locally observed scaling relations. Only type 1 AGN, with unobscured

from the left to the right. Nuclear obscuration, parametrized with a Calzetti extinction law, moves
every pure type 1 AGN along the direction of the orange arrow
broad line region allow a simple direct estimate of BH masses, via the so-called “virial” or empir-
ically calibrated “photoionization” method (Peterson et al. 2004). Based on existing samples of
broad line QSOs, most efforts have been devoted tothe studyofthe MBH−σ∗relation. Forexam-
ple, Salviander et al. (2007) have used narrow nebular emission lines ([OIII], [OII]) excited by
the AGN emission in the nuclear region of galaxies as proxies for the central velocity dispersion
and compared these to the black hole mass estimated from the broad line width of QSOs from
z ∼to z ∼. In this case, a large scatter has been found in the relation between MBH and σ∗.
An alternative path is to study carefully selected samples of moderately bright AGN in
narrow redshift ranges, where the host’s stellar velocity dispersion can be measured directly
from the absorption lines in high signal-to-noise spectra. These studies also found evidence
of (strong) positive evolution of the MBH to σ∗ratio compared to the local value (see
Bennert et al. 2011, and references therein). This method, although promising and reliable, is
quite inefficient and telescope-timeconsuming: Secure detection of spectral absorption features
in massive ellipticals at < z < require hundreds of hours of integration time on an 8-m class
telescope.

538 11
Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
When a good sampling of the AGN SED is instead available, rather than high-resolution,
high signal-to-noise spectra, it is possible to try to decompose the overall spectral energy distri-
bution into a nuclear and a galaxy component and derive in this way the physical properties of
the host galaxies of unobscured AGN whose SMBH masses can be estimated from their broad
lines (Merloni et al. 2010).
Other groups have chosen to try to derive information on the host mass of broad line
AGN using multicolor image decomposition techniques. Due to the severe surface brightness
dimming effects, employing these techniques for high-redshift QSOs becomes increasingly
challenging, unless gravitationally lensed QSOs are selected. In all cases, very deep, high-
resolution optical images (HST) are necessary to reliably disentangle the nuclear from the host
galaxy emission.
The main result of these various investigations is that our estimates of the type 1 AGN host
physical parameters are inconsistentwith the hypothesis that theylie on the z = scaling relation
(see >Fig. 11-24). At high redshift, bigger black holes are hosted in galaxies of a given mass as
compared to what we observe locally. The best linear fit to the ensemble of observations shown
in >Fig. 11-24 is MBH/Msph ∝(+ z).±.for the black-hole-to-spheroid mass ratio and
MBH/Mhost ∝(+ z).±.for the black-hole-to-total host stellar mass ratio.
However, the objects for which this study can be made are selected essentially on the
basis of the nuclear (AGN) luminosity and on the detectability of broad emission lines, clearly

leading to a bias toward more massive black holes, similar to Malmquist bias for luminosity-
selected samples of standard candles. Can such a bias be responsible for the observed
trends?
Let us consider in detail the effects on the observed systems of a given intrinsic scatter, σμ,
in the MBH – M∗scaling relation. Any nonzero σμ implies that there is a range of possible
masses log M∗± σμ for each object of a given black hole mass MBH, where we have assumed,
for simplicity, a symmetric scatter in the relation. If the number density of galaxies is falling off
rapidly in the interval log M∗± σμ, it will then be more likely to find one of the more numerous
small mass galaxies associated with the given black hole and therefore a larger ratio MBH/M∗.
Thus, given a distribution of galaxy masses and provided that the scatter σμ is not too large,
the logarithmic offset of each point from the correlation, assumed to be held fixed to the local
determination, is given by

One can estimate observationally the logarithmic derivative of the galaxy mass function
d log ϕ
d log M∗. At z ≈, the offset expected from such a bias is of the order of 0.25 dex, if σμ = .and
increases to about 0.5 dex for σμ = .. The average offset shown in >Fig. 11-24 is clearly in
excess of what is expected in the most extreme case of large intrinsic scatter in the local relation,
estimated to be less than 0.5 dex (Gültekin et al. 2009). The data point toward an evolution of
the scaling relation, either in normalization or in scatter (or a combination of both).
What are the implications of these findings for our understanding of the cosmological
coevolution of black holes and galaxies?
In the next section, we will discuss in more detail a number of physical processes by which
AGN can regulate the growth of their host galaxies, thereby affecting any observable evolution
of the scaling relations. We will see how, from the physical point of view, a clear distinction has
to be made between two modes of AGN feedback.
The first one is associated to the numerous, long-lived, LLAGN, with emitted power dom-
inated by the kinetic energy of their jets and outflows. It becomes increasingly important for
very massive holes at low redshift (see >Sect. 3.1.1 above). Many models of galaxy formation
invoke such a feedback mechanism in order not to overproduce very massive galaxies in the
largest virialized DM halos at low redshift (Croton et al. 2006).
It is not clear, however, how such a feedback mode can effectively couple the SMBH mass
with the structural properties of their galactic hosts and give rise to the observed scaling rela-
tions. For such a task, modelers have instead turned to feedback modes associated to the phases
of fast SMBH growth in bright QSO.
In all feedback models in which the black hole energy injection is very fast (explosive),
if strong QSO feedback is responsible for rapidly terminating star formation throughout the
entire bulge (Di Matteo et al. 2005), QSOs and, in general, type 1 AGN are associated with
the final stage of bulge formation. Then, very little evolution, as well as very little scatter, is
expected for the scaling relations, and it is very hard to produce any positive offset like the one
observed.

The physics of such (“quasar”) mode of AGN feedback remain elusive, as it remains the issue
of whether the energy release by the associated process of rapid black hole growth is indeed
responsible for halting the conversion of gas into stars on galactic (kpc) scales or whether it
is only responsible for a milder form of “self-regulation” by cutting off its own gas supply on
nuclear (pc) scales (Hopkins et al. 2009).

Cosmology II: AGN Feedback
The phenomenological investigation presented in >Sect. 3 above leaves open the fundamental
question about the physical origin of such a clear, parallel differential growth of both the black
holes and the galaxy population.
From the discussion of AGN activity in
>Chap. 7, it should be immediately apparent that
black hole growth is often, if not always, accompanied by the release of enormous amounts of
energy, in the form of radiation, outflows, and gravitational waves.
Black holes accreting at high rates in the so-called radiative (or quasar) mode will release
of order 10% of the accreted rest mass energy as radiation. They can also drive broad (un-
collimated) outflows, again described in more detail in
>Chap. 7, and in about 10% of bright
AGN, radio emitting, relativistic jets are observed (the quasar 3C273 seems to be such an object
that is accreting efficiently and making powerful jets at the same time).
But even black holes in the so-called inefficient accretion regime, where cooling is domi-
nated by advective processes rather than radiation, can drive powerful, collimated outflows in
the form of relativistic jets. Perhaps the best example of such a powerful “low-efficiency” black
hole is the radio galaxy Virgo A, which is the product of inefficient accretion onto the super-
massive black hole at the center of M87, which itself is located in the center of the Virgo cluster.
See
>Chap. 7 for a detailed discussion of the properties of the M87 jet.
This energy will be released directly into the environment from which the black hole grows:
the cooling, possibly star-forming gas in the central galaxy. Any transfer of energy to the gas
should thus reduce the rate at which gas cools and forms stars. While the direct link between star
formation through cooling in the centers of galaxies and black hole growth through accretion
is not fully established, it is easy to imagine how such an energy deposition can reduce the rate
of accretion onto the central black hole as well.
This process of cooling-induced black hole activity can therefore be considered as a negative
feedback loop, in that increased accretion activity acts to decrease the large-scale gas supply to
the black hole. The impact on star formation might be coincidental (if black hole growth is
unrelated to the actual star formation rate) or fundamental (if black hole growth is mediated or
directly fueled by star formation, e.g., through direct accretion of stars).
Furthermore, while the direct link between black hole growth and star formation suggested
by the M–σ∗relation is hidden, and evidence for the suggested underlying feedback process on
stars is largely circumstantial (as will be discussed below), some important clues can be derived
by tracing the evolution of the feedback energy released by growing black holes as a function of
black hole mass and redshift.
In this section, we describe in some detail how such an inventory can be made and how
feedback itself operates. We will focus primarily on the information about the properties of
black holes that can be extracted from observations of feedback, with other chapters discussing
the role of black hole growth on the formation of structure in more detail (see
>Chap. 6).

4.1 Evidence and Arguments for Feedback
The process of accretion is a multi-scale phenomenon: The range from the place of capture,
where the gas first enters the sphere of influence of the black hole, to the event horizon of the
black hole spans roughly seven orders of magnitude in scale–too much to simulate in one big
simulation for even just one dynamical time on the outer scale.
Yet, as extreme as this range in scales may be, the process of feedback can cover another 5
orders of magnitude more in scale: from the scales of the horizon (about AU size for a typical
central black hole in a typical, L∗, galaxy) to scales of entire galaxy clusters (several hundred
kiloparsec), a dynamic range of 12 orders of magnitude.
Given that our understanding of accretion is still developing, and that our understanding
of jet formation is, at best, elementary, it should not come as much of a surprise that our under-
standing of AGN feedback is mostly limited to fairly crude statements about energy input and
global heating efficiencies from a theoretical perspective.
The best observational evidence for feedback is not on galaxy scales at all but on the largest
spatial scales on which we can expect black holes to have any meaningful influence: in the
centers of galaxy clusters. The reason for this is twofold:
•
First, the angular scales on which feedback in galaxy clusters unfolds are readily resolvable
by telescopes in all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.
•
Second, the signatures of AGN feedback in galaxy clusters are easy to identify from X-ray
and radio imaging, as we will discuss momentarily.
Consequently, we have developed a fairly mature picture of how AGN feedback works on
the very large scales and have even successfully simulated the feedback processes in computers.
On smaller scales, the evidence for feedback becomes increasingly circumstantial. Thus,
while the link between black hole and galaxy properties may be the most fundamental expres-
sion of direct coupling of their growth processes, it is also the most elusive in terms of direct
evidence for this coupling.
A number of reasons conspire to limit our observational insight into galactic scale feedback:
•
The angular scales of this process are inherently small, given that the feedback must be
happening in the centers of galaxies.
•
While cluster evolution is happening in the current epoch, at low redshift, galaxy growth
happens at higher redshift–during the star formation epoch. This is especially true for the
galaxies that seem to require AGN feedback the most.
•
Both star formation and rapid black hole growth tend to cloak themselves in dust extinc-
tion and photo-electric absorption. It may be that the smoking guns of feedback are mostly
hidden behind Compton-thick X-ray absorbers and many magnitudes of dust extinction.
Finally, the tight connection between black hole growth and star formation suggested by the
M−σ∗relation and by the similarity in the redshift evolution of both populations seems to imply
that stars and black holes grow roughly simultaneously. For feedback to have a strong impact
on star formation and at the same time couple the mass of growing black holes to the mass of
stars in a galaxy, one would expect rapid black hole growth to be concurrent with episodes of
star formation.
This would imply that feedback on star formation would have occurred during the quasar
phases, and since most quasars are radio quiet, this suggests that at least part of the feedback on
star formation operates through a different channel than the readily observable “radio galaxy”

542 11
Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
feedback on cluster scales at low redshift. Given that this feedback must have occurred during
the quasar epoch, it is commonly referred to as “quasar mode” feedback.
In fact, the most convincing “evidence” for such a mode comes not from actual observa-
tions of black holes but from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation; in order to explain the
galaxy luminosity function and galaxy color distribution, modelers have to assume two types of
feedback: one that disperses and heats the star-forming gas at the end of a star formation cycle
(generally triggered by mergers), effectively halting star formation (this is the “quasar mode”)
and one that maintains the gas in typical elliptical galaxies in its tenuous, hot state (this is the
“radio” or “maintenance mode”) (Springel et al. 2005; Croton et al. 2006).
However, these models say nothing about the actual physical mechanism of feedback: They
assumequasi-spherical heating of the gas in both “quasar” and “radio” mode, and the only thing
that distinguishes them is the prescription of how the black hole accretes (whether from cold
or hot gas). The more appropriate naming convention is thus “cold” and “hot” mode accretion.
Thus, the circumstantial evidence for “cold” mode feedback does not answer the question
of whether the heating/dispersal occurs as a result of winds, jets, or radiation released by the
accreting black hole. Given that slowly growing black holes are radiatively inefficient and uni-
versally seem to be radio-active (Ho 2008), it has generally been assumed that any feedback
from black holes in the “hot” mode must be in the form of jets.
4.2 Feedback in Galaxy Clusters
It is instructive to begin by discussing the obvious examples of AGN feedback. This will inform
our discussion of the possible influence of AGN on the process of star formation on galactic
scales. In particular, from a discussion of radio galaxy feedback on cluster scales, it is possi-
ble to draw quantitative conclusions about “radio-mode” or “hot-mode” feedback by jets from
slowly growing black holes. For a more detailed discussion of feedback in galaxy clusters, see
McNamara and Nulsen (2007).
On a basic level, the importance of feedback was already apparent with the discovery of
powerful radio galaxies in the 1960s and onward (though the relevance of the black hole in
this context took longer to establish): radio galaxies, like the example of Cygnus A shown
in >Fig. 11-25, exhibit diffuse “lobes” of synchrotron emission (see
>Chap. 7), on scales of
tens and even hundreds of kiloparsec. In other words, the action of a jet from the central black
hole deposits magnetized relativistic plasma into the surrounding medium.
Simply summing up the entire synchrotron radiation and making reasonable assumptions
about the shape and volume filling fraction of the emitting regions, it is straight forward to
derive lower limits on the total energy needed to explain the radio emission. In some cases, the
minimum energy derived could be enormous: Perley et al. (1984) found that Cygnus A required
at least Emin ∼> ergs pumped into the lobes by the central black hole. For perspective, this
is of the same order as the gravitational binding energy of the Milky Way.
If jets could release this much energy in relativistic gas into the environments of black holes,
it would be hard to imagine how the environment could not be strongly affected.
The first direct evidence for feedback on the gas surrounding the black hole came with the
arrival of high-resolution X-ray imaging: Using ROSAT data, Boehringer et al. (1993) discov-
ered that the radio galaxy Perseus A (powered by the supermassive black hole in the central
clustergalaxy NGC 1275) excavates large cavities in the hot, X-ray emitting thermal gas that fills

the Perseus cluster. The gas is pushed aside into dense shells, and the excavated X-ray cavities
are filled with radio emission by the lobes of the radio galaxy (see >Fig. 11-26).
Similarly, the privileged view we enjoy of the nearby radio galaxy Virgo A (also known
as M87) allowed a uniquely detailed study of its multi-scale emission well before the idea of
feedback had taken hold. The inner (roughly kpc) jet of M87 is discussed in some detail in
>Chap. 7. However, lower frequency observations revealed a much richer picture on scales
just outside of the visible galaxy, still in the very center of the Virgo cluster (Owen et al. 2000):
curling and twisting strands of radio emission, connecting the nucleus to a set of radio lobes
about 20 kpc in radius, and misaligned with respect to the central jets by about 90○on the sky.6
6Part of this misalignment could be due to projection, of course, given that at least the inner jet is directed
fairly close to the line of sight.

544 11
Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
Both Perseus and Virgo are cool core clusters, and in particular, Perseus had long been
considered a prototypical example of a cooling flow. That is, the radiative cooling time in the
center of the cluster is shorter than the age of the cluster. In a quasi-hydrostatic model of a
cluster (inward gravity, mostly provided by the dark matter contribution, balanced by an out-
ward thermal pressure gradient), this would imply that the cluster must be contracting on a
Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale, with gas at the center cooling rapidly to star-forming tempera-
tures. Cooling gas from further out in the cluster would replace the gas in a slow, subsonic
inflow (for a review, see Fabian 1994, and references therein).
Even before the era of Chandra and XMM, it was already apparent that this simple picture
of ongoing inflow of cooling gas did not accurately describe cool core clusters: The implied rates
for star formation were an order of magnitude higher than the observed rates.
Radio surveys of cluster centers revealed that essentially all traditional “cooling flow” clus-
ters had active radio galaxies in their centers (Burns 1990). Generally, these radio sources are
Fanaroff–Riley type I sources (henceforth abbreviated as FR I; see
>Chap. 7 for a discussion
of radio source morphology), though it is not entirely clear whether this is due to lower average
source power compared to field FR II galaxies or due to the increased gas density in clusters
(frustrating source evolution and possibly leading to increased entrainment).
Guided by the detailed examples of feedback in the Virgo and Perseus clusters and the
observed mismatch between the X-ray cooling rate and the star formation rates in clusters,
the first models of black hole feedback in the context of galaxy clusters were presented in Tabor
and Binney (1993).
4.2.1 The Chandra and XMM-Newton View
The role of AGN in regulating the cooling of gas in cool core clusters was brought into clear
focus with the launches of Chandra and XMM-Newton in two ways:
Chandra observations revealed the presence of cavities just like those found in the center of
Perseus in virtually every cool core cluster, providing the observational confirmation that the
radio galaxies present in these clusters actively perturb the gas. Generically, the cavities appear
to be surrounded by relatively cool gas.7 Deep Chandra observations sometimes reveal multiple
cavities on different scales, which has been interpreted as evidence for variability in the AGN
power.8
At the same time, XMM-Newton’s high-resolution X-ray spectra of the cluster centers
revealed that radiative cooling must be impeded below a threshold temperature of order 10
million degrees (about 1 keV), at a temperature where cooling should be efficient and rapid due
to the flattening of the cooling curve for thermal gas as atomic line cooling becomes dominant
(Peterson et al. 2003).
This result is consistent with the observed lack of star formation in central cluster galaxies,
compared to the hundreds of solar masses of star formation per year that would have been
expected based on simple cooling flow models. It moves the discrepancy of cool gas missing at
molecular temperatures to cool gas missing at X-ray temperatures below about a keV. In either
case, a heating agent is needed, but in the “revised” cooling flow problem, the gas that must be
7This was surprising because one might naively expect the gas most strongly affected by feedback to be hot.
8But see Morsony et al. (2010) for arguments why the presence of cavities is not a sufficient argument for AGN
duty cycles.

Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei 11

preferentially targeted is at about a keV and will thus occupy a much larger volume fraction,
which should make it easier to interact with for any feedback mechanism.
Thus, after about a decade of study, a standard paradigm has emerged from the high inci-
dence of radio loud AGN in cool core clusters and from the theoretical requirement of a heating
agent that maintains the temperature distributions in galaxy clusters: radio galaxies provide the
energy needed to counterbalance cooling in the centers of clusters.
From these observations, and from theoretical modeling (Begelman and Cioffi 1989;
Reynolds et al. 2001), a simple understanding of radio source evolution has been developed
that underpins the radio galaxy feedback paradigm. According to this picture, radio source
evolution separates into three stages (e.g., Reynolds et al. 2001):
1. In the initial supersonic phase, jet plasma inflates cocoons that are strongly overpressured
relative to the environment. These cocoons must expand, and the rapid energy release
implies that this expansion is supersonic in the frame of the environment.
The expansion is similar to that of a wind-blown bubble described by Castor et al. (1975):
The cavity radius roughly follows the self-similar scaling9
R ∝(Pjett
ρICM
)
/
(11.15)
which is functionally equivalent to the Sedov–Taylor solution if the blast energy is replaced
by the injected energy over time, Pjett. In this expression, ρICM is the density of the
environment.
Note that this argument neglects the actual jet propagation completely and assumes the
jet energy is randomized as the jet encounters the environment (in more powerful FR II
sources) or through entrainment (which has been suggested as the dissipation agent in FR
I source; Laing and Bridle 2002).
2. As the source expands, the pressure inside the cocoon and in the shell eventually approaches
the pressure of the environment and the expansion becomes subsonic. The initially gener-
ated shock wave of the supersonic expansion will continue to coast outward, leaving behind
a subsonically expanding cavity. As the expansion velocity becomes subsonic, the confine-
ment is dominated by the thermal pressure of the environment, so the solution changes to
a pressure confined bubble,
R ∝(Pjett
pe
)
/
(11.16)
3. Finally, as the source expansion velocity drops below the buoyancy speed or once the
pressure of the source drops below the dynamic pressure of motions in the environment,
the cavities/cocoon will detach and float away from the black hole buoyantly or advectively.
Once cold gas has refilled the central region of the cluster, any jet activity will start the
cycle anew.
It is clear from (>11.15) that jet power and density are the controlling variables in the initial
evolution: lower power jets in denser environments will be more easily frustrated (with more
slowly expanding cocoons that become sub-sonic and unstable at smaller sizes).
9This expression applies to bubbles smaller than a cluster pressure scale height. It is straight forward to extend
it to stratified power-law atmospheres.

4.2.2 Estimating the Kinetic Power of a Radio Source
Before the discovery of X-ray cavities, measurements of the kinetic power of radio galaxies
(i.e., the total power traveling down the jets) were limited to estimates based on the observed
synchrotron emission (see discussion in >Sect. 4.2). These were hampered by several factors:
•
Without knowledge of the field strength, an observed synchrotron flux, along with an esti-
mate of the emitting volume could only provide a lower limit of the total energy in the radio
plasma (essentially assuming equipartition between the energy in electrons and magnetic
field).
•
The estimate of the volume depends strongly on the volume filling fraction, which is not
measurable.
•
Synchrotron aging can cause electrons to cool and develop a sharp cutoff in the syn-
chrotron spectrum. Thus, significant amounts of energy in lower energy electrons would
be unaccounted for in the total power budget.
One of the most important results from the discovery of X-ray cavities in clusters is a robust,
independent way to estimatethe power of cluster radio sources. It is based on the fluid mechan-
ics of inflated bubbles: In order to inflate a cavity in the intra-clustergas, the jet must (a) displace
the material in the environment into a shell surrounding the cavity, which is of the order of
EpV ∼pV (and depends on the details of the inflation history of the bubble) and (b) replace it
with relativistic, magnetized gas. At a minimum, the amount of energy needed to do this is the
work done on the cluster gas and the internal energy of the radio plasma. If the expansion of
the cavity is adiabatic, the total energy needed is
Ecavity =
γpV
(γ −) ∼pV,
(11.17)
where γ is the adiabatic index of the gas inside the cavity and is typically assumed to be γ = /,
given the presence of relativistic electrons and tangled magnetic fields.
Estimating the age of the cavity, and thus the jet power needed to inflate it, is more difficult
and introduces some uncertainty. Direct kinematic measurementsof the expansion velocities of
cavities are impossible with current X-ray telescopes. However, in many cases, the observations
suggest that the temperature of the shells surrounding the cavities is low. In this case, it is safe
to assume that the recent expansion of the cavity was subsonic. Thus, the sound crossing time
of the bubble radius is a reasonable lower limit on the cavity age:
tcavity ≥τsonic = Rcavity
cs
,
(11.18)
where Rcavity is the radius of the cavity and cs the sound speed of the cluster gas.
Given that most cavities are found in cluster centers, a reasonable upper limit on the age of
the cavity is the buoyant rise time τbuoy of the bubble in the gravitational potential of the cluster
(since any bubble older than τbuoy would have risen out of the cluster center):

the pressure scale height of the cluster in bubble radii but should be of order unity for typical
observed bubble radii.10 For detached cavities, the appropriate age to use is the buoyancy time
for the projected distance instead of the bubble diameter.
Given that buoyancy sets in after the source becomes subsonic, this loosely brackets the
power inferred for the jets from the measurement of cluster cavities to

(11.20)
Estimates of the central cluster density and temperature (and thus pressure and sound
speed)are readilyobtained from X-rayimages and spectra. The most difficult part is the estimate
of the cavity volume, since errors in the estimated cavity radius and viewing angle uncertain-
ties can compound to errors of up to an order of magnitude in source power. Nonetheless, this
method has afforded us with a large number of reliable estimates of jet powers to within a factor
of a few for dozens of radio galaxies in nearby clusters.11
While early, shallower Chandra exposures of cluster centers only showed cool shells
in the vicinity of the cavities, deep observations of a number of important clusters later also
showed the presence of shocks surrounding at least some of the cavities (e.g., McNamara et al.
2005; Wise et al. 2007; Forman et al. 2007). Given the generic picture of how radio sources
evolve over time described in >Sect. 4.2.1, the presence of weak shocks should be expected
(and had been predicted in Reynolds et al. 2001).
In fact, an important corollary from (> 11.15) is that the initial strongly supersonic phase
is short lived in typical cluster environments: The expansion velocity of the shell is
vshell = dR
dt ∝(
Pjet
ρICMR)
/
∝R−/∝t−/
(11.21)
Given that cavities should remain in the cluster centers for about 2–3 sound crossing times
before becoming buoyant, the fraction f>M of time a given radio galaxy spends expanding
supersonically at or above a given Mach number M, relative to the total dynamic lifetime before
buoyant removal, should only be of order
f>M ∼
τ>M
τsonic
∼
M−/.
(11.22)
Thus, the observational lack of evidence for sources expanding at large Mach numbers does not
rule out that radio sources go through this strong shock phase. It is, however, short lived and
only a small mass fraction of AGN’s environment passes through a strong shock.
The detection of a shock (which requires not just the detection of a surface brightness jump
but also a temperaturejump, which is most easily identified through a harder X-ray color) offers
a significantly better diagnostic of jet power than the cavity method: Because the shock strength
is an indication of the expansion velocity, a measured shock radius, brightness, and strength can
be modeled using simple 1D spherical shock models to give a reliable source power. Typical
Mach numbers for shocks detected in clusters are between one and two, consistent with this
argument.
10The buoyancy speed can never exceed the sound speed.
11It should be kept in mind that the inferred powers are averages over the cavity age, which can be between
millions to hundreds of millions of years old.

548 11
Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
This rather simple parametric description of radio source evolution is complemented by
a growing body of numerical simulations of jet-driven feedback. Initial 2-dimensional sim-
ulations generally supported the simple picture (Reynolds et al. 2001). However, a thorough
understanding requires full 3-dimensional simulations, and work on understanding the details
of feedback ab initio is still in the early stages.
A key problem posed by 2D and early 3D simulations is the apparent contradiction of highly
bipolar release of energy in the jet and the need for mostly isotropic heating (Vernaleo and
Reynolds 2006). While outgoing shocks assume a spheroidal shape relatively quickly, heating
by shocks is insufficient to solve the cooling flow problem (see ( > 11.22)). In addition, jets
evacuate cocoons around them. Ongoing, unidirectional jet activity was found to propagate
inside this cocoon, dynamically and energetically isolated from the inner cluster gas and thus
unable to counteract cooling in the center.
The solution might lie in the interaction with the cluster and in the internal dynamics of
jets: Heinz et al. (2006) found that the jets can continue to efficiently couple to the inner cluster
if their axes are subjected to a moderate wobble and, crucially, the cluster itself is dynami-
cally evolved in the context of a cosmological simulation. Simulations generally show that the
complex X-ray appearance of clusters, and even the appearance of multiple successive cavities,
can be generates by a single, ongoing episode of jet activity and a dynamic cluster atmosphere
(Morsony et al. 2010). This suggests that the interaction between jets and clusters goes both
ways: Cluster dynamics affects jet dynamics and vice versa.
4.2.3 Cluster Radio Sources as a Population
A census of nearby clusters with cavities reveals a number of important insights about the
statistical and global properties of central cluster radio sources:
•
When plotting jet power vs. X-ray luminosity, radio sources straddle the heating=cooling
line: About half of the radio sources sampled have kinetic powers that are higher than the
cooling luminosity of the cluster (see >Fig. 11-27 adapted from Rafferty et al. 2006).
•
More importantly, the jet power appears to be correlated with the cooling luminosity of the
cluster: More powerful radio sources are found in clusters with higher cooling rates. This is
exactly the signature one would expect in an AGN feedback picture (Rafferty et al. 2006).
•
The jet power measured from cavities appears to be related to the Bondi accretion rate of the
cluster. That is, in clusters with higher central densities and/or lower core temperatures, the
jet power is higher (Allen et al. 2006). While this correlation does not imply that black holes
actually accrete at the Bondi rate in clusters, the relatively close match suggests that black
holes accrete directlyfrom the clustergas as it flows intothe central galaxy(see >Fig. 11-27).
Together, these results suggest that the balance between heating and cooling in clusters is
relatively tight. In fact, the high efficiencies suggested by these findings, in a global sense, as
well as from studies of individual, powerful black holes with relatively low masses, have led to
the suggestion that the black holes powering the jets in cluster centers might even require the
extraction of black hole spin (McNamara et al. 2011).
However, given the significant uncertainties in the jet power estimates, and given that clus-
ters are, in all likelihood, not steady state systems (thus, cooling rates can temporarily exceed
heating rates, as long as they are balanced on average), a sufficient region of parameter space

is still allowed in which AGN can balance cooling without requiring extreme efficiencies,
accretion rates, or black hole masses.
All of the detailed studies of radio galaxy feedback in clustershave been limited to clusters at
relatively low redshifts, becauseof the need for high-fidelityX-ray images of cavities and shocks.
In addition, high-redshift cluster samples are sparse. Consequently, constraints on cluster feed-
back at higher redshift are much harder to obtain. Radio surveys of high-redshift clusters do
indicate an increase in the cluster radio luminosity function (Branchesi et al. 2006), hinting at
an increase in feedback activity.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that, while the central massiveelliptical galaxies harbor by far
the most massive black holes in clusters, other cluster galaxies can be radio loud. This situation
typically leads to the formation of a bent radio source. The exploration of the statistics of non-
central cluster radio sources is ongoing, and it has been suggested that this population of sources
could contribute to cluster feedback (Hart et al. 2009). However, it is difficult to envision a
scenario whereby a population of such sources will dominate the heating rate in the average
cluster. It is also unclear how they could respond to central gas cooling as would be required for
thermal regulation of the cluster gas.
4.3 Feedback in Groups
Due to the lower temperatures and densities in the intragroup medium, detecting evidence for
group-wide feedback from X-ray observations is significantly more difficult than in clusters.

Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
Statistical X-ray studies of cluster and group samples show that, generically, lower mass
halos have excess central entropy when compared to self-similar models of halo formation,
indicating that an additional source of nongravitational heating must have injected entropy
preferentially into the low mass systems (e.g., Ponman et al. 2003). AGN have been suggested
as a possible heating mechanism (e.g., Short and Thomas 2009). >Figure 11-28 shows how the
inclusion of feedback in detailed models of cluster and group atmospheres affects primarily low
mass systems and raises their central entropies.
And, in fact, surveys of groups suggest that such a scenario might work: Dong et al. (2010)
find that a fraction ofat least 25% ofthe groups in theirsurveycontain clearly detectable cavities,
with a clear preference for cavities to be found in groups with cooler cores (as is the case in
clusters). In their sample, the presence of cavities does not appear to be correlated with the
1.4-GHz radio flux.
On the other hand, a survey of radio properties of groups shows that the central temper-
atures of groups with central radio sources are elevated compared to a radio quiet sample of
groups, which was suggested as a possible indication of ongoing radio galaxy feedback (Croston
et al. 2005).
4.4 Radio-Mode Feedback in Galaxies
The best direct evidence for black holes affecting the surrounding gas within galaxies comes
again from combined radio and Chandra observations of nearby objects: >Fig. 11-29 shows
images of three nearby galaxies where jets clearly excavate cavities and affect gas on sub-galactic
scales: M87, M84, and NGC5128 (Centaurus A). In the latter case, the entrainment of gas into
the jet, and the formation of a strong shock driven by the expanding southwestern radio lobe is
directly visible in X-rays.

These are clearlocal examples ofrelativelypowerful, evolved radiogalaxies. Numerous other
examples have been studied individually. Yet, perhaps the most convincing argument for the
importance and prevalence of jets in massive galaxies come from statistical studies.
In a study of X-ray cavities in and around nearby ellipticals, Nulsen et al. (2007) found that
AGN power more than matched the cooling luminosity of the gas in the hot galactic X-ray
halo; compared to the same study in clusters (shown in the left hand panel of >Fig. 11-27), the
galaxies fall consistently above the heating=cooling line (McNamara and Nulsen 2007).
The implication that radio-mode feedback is important in massive galaxies (those that have
detectable X-ray halos) is complemented by statistical studies of the radio source incidence in
galaxies of different type and mass: The left panel of >Fig. 11-30 shows a steady increase of the
fraction of radio loud galaxies (i.e., galaxies above a fixed radio luminosity per stellar mass)with
stellar mass of the host galaxy (Best et al. 2005). The most massive galaxies exhibit the highest
radio fluxes per stellar mass, indicating that radio-mode feedback is most active in today’s most
massive galaxies, with 10% or more of the most massive galaxies hosting radio loud AGN.
Given that more massive galaxies harbormore massive black holes, one might naivelyexpect
this result to suggest that radio loudness is a fraction of black hole mass. Early studies seemed
to suggest this (e.g., Franceschini et al. 1998). However, deep radio surveys of a wider class
of black holes show that the radio loudness, defined relative to the bolometric flux, actually
increases for decreasing Eddington ratios (Ho 2002): The right panel of >Fig. 11-30 shows that
radio emission increases in relative brightness (compared to the bolometric luminosity) for
lower luminosity AGN.
This suggests that black holes become relatively more efficient at liberating energy in the
form of jets as their luminosity (and presumably accretion rate) drops, such that all black holes
at sufficiently low accretion rate appear to be driving some form of radio loud outflow.
The idea that low-luminosity black holes are universally radio loud arose roughly in parallel
also in the study of X-ray binary black holes (Gallo et al. 2003), where it is possible to track
individual black holes across outburst and decline into quiescence. These observations showed
that a jet was always present at low luminosities, with increasing relative radio flux at decreasing
X-ray luminosities.

While a thorough theoretical understanding is still missing, it has been shown that low-
efficiency accretion leads to the formation of geometrically thick flows, as opposed to the
geometrically thin accretion discs found in, for example, Seyfert galaxies and quasars. In such a
geometrically thick (quasi-spherical) flow, it might be much easier to build up significant mag-
netic flux, even just from stochastic turbulent dynamo processes in the disc, which could in
turn drive the jet (see
>Chap. 7).
Anecdotally, the case of the M87 jet makes the perfect illustration of this point: The total
radiative output from the black hole is unimpressive12 at LM∼ergs s−, about two orders
of magnitude below the luminosity corresponding to efficient accretion at the Bondi rate of that
particular black hole. Meanwhile, the estimated jet power from this object is about two orders
of magnitude larger (Forman et al. 2007), consistent with the accretion power one would derive
if the black hole were accreting at the Bondi accretion rate, thus making M87 a jet-dominated
low-luminosity black hole.
While a direct translation of radio loudness into feedback efficiency is challenging, this
result suggests that black hole feedback might be more prevalent than just in the most pow-
erful AGN in the most massive galaxies. In fact, the ubiquity of low-luminosity AGN and their
increased dominance at low redshift (see >Fig. 11-8) supports both the idea of a radio main-
tenance mode of ongoing feedback in early-type galaxies (Croton et al. 2006) as well as the
picture of gentle feedback (through buoyancy rather than shocks) not just in clusters but also
in galaxies.
Additionally, ongoing low-level jet activity seems much better suited at targeting gas within
the galaxy than explosive outbursts in the form of powerful radio galaxies that would trans-
port most of the energy far beyond galactic scales, and the prominent examples of radio-mode
12Much of this radiation may actually be in the form of X-rays from the unresolved base of the jets itself.

Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei 11

feedback shown in >Fig. 11-29 should be considered extreme outliers from more typical radio-
mode feedback. This statementcan, in fact, be quantified based on the global AGN evolutionary
models outlined in >Sect. 3.1.1, which we shall discuss next.
4.5 Quantifying the Eﬃciency of the Radio Mode
The observed omnipresence of radio cores13 in low-luminosity AGN and the observed increase
in radio loudness of X-ray binaries at low luminosities can be placed on a solid theoretical
footing. Jets launch in the innermost regions of accretion flows around black holes, and at low
luminosities, these flows likely become mechanically (i.e., advectively) cooled.
Such flows can, to lowest order, be assumed to be scale invariant: A low-luminosity accretion
flow around a ten solar mass black hole, accreting at a fixed, small fraction of the Eddington
accretion rate, will be a simple, scaled-down version of the same flow around a billion solar
mass black hole (with the spatial and temporal scales shrunk by the mass ratio). It follows,
then, that jet formation in such a flow should be similarly scale invariant.
This assumption is sufficient to derive a very generic relation between the radio luminosity
emitted by such a scale invariant jet and the total (kinetic and electromagnetic) power car-
ried down the jet, independent of the unknown details of how jets are launched and collimated
(Heinz and Sunyaev 2003): The synchrotron radio luminosity Lν of a self-absorbed jet core
depends on the jet power Pjet through
Lradio ∝P
+α


M−α ∼P

.
(11.23)
where M is the mass of the black hole and α ∼is the observable, typically flat radio spectral
index of the synchrotron power law emitted by the core of the jet. This relation is a result of
the fact that the synchrotron photosphere (the location where the jet core radiates most of its
energy) moves further out as the size scale and the pressure and field strength inside the jet
increase (corresponding to an increase in jet power). As the size of the photosphere increases, so
does the emission. The details of the power-law relationship are an expression of the properties
of synchrotron emission.
For a given black hole, the jet power should depend on the accretion rate as Pjet ∝˙M (this
assumption is implicit in the assumed scale invariance). On the other hand, the emission from
optically thin low-luminosity accretion flows itself depends nonlinearly on the accretion rate,
roughly as Lacc ∝˙M, since two body processes like bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton
scattering dominate, which depend on the square of the density. Thus, at low accretion rates,
Lradio ∼L


bol, which implies that black holes should become more radio loud at lower luminosi-
ties (Heinz and Sunyaev 2003; Merloni et al. 2003; Falcke et al. 2004). It also implies that more
massive black holes should be relatively more radio loud than less massive ones, at the same
relative accretion rate ˙M/M.
>Equation 11.23 is a relation between the observable core radio flux and the underlying jet
power. Once calibrated using a sample of radio sources with known jet powers, it can be used
to estimate the jet power of other sources based on their radio properties alone (with appro-
priate provisions to account, statistically, for differences in Doppler boosting between different
sources).
13The “core” of a jet is the brightest innermost region of the jet, where the jet just becomes optically thin to
synchrotron self absorption, that is, the synchrotron photosphere of the jet.

554 11
Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
The cluster radio sources shown in
> Fig. 11-27 provide such a sample. Plotting the
core (unresolved) radio power against the jet power inferred from cavity and shock analysis
shows a clear nonlinear relation between the two variables (Merloni and Heinz 2007). Fitting
this relation provides the required constant of proportionality and is consistent (within the
uncertainties) with the power-law slope of /predicted by (> 11.23):

with an uncertainty in the slope ζ of 0.11, where Lradio = νLν is measured at ν = GHz.
Because this relation was derived for the cores of jets, which display the characteristic
flat self-absorbed synchrotron spectrum, care has to be taken when applying it to a sample
of objects: Only the core emission should be taken into account, while extended emission
should be excluded. As discussed in > Sect. 2.1.1, radio luminosity functions are separated
spectrally into flat and steep sources, and we can use both samples to limit the contribution of
flat-spectrum sources from both ends.
Given a radio luminosity function Φrad and an appropriate correction for relativistic boost-
ing, (> 11.24) can be used to derive the kinetic luminosity function of jets (Heinz et al. 2007;
Merloni and Heinz 2008):

The resulting kinetic luminosity functions for the flat-spectrum radio luminosity functions14
from Dunlop and Peacock (1990) and de Zotti et al. (2005) are plotted in the right panel
of >Fig. 11-31.
Since the figure plots P ⋅ΦP, the curves show directly the total contribution of AGN at a
given jet power to the total feedback power at a given redshift. At the low-luminosity end, these
curves are roughly flat, implying that low-luminosity source contributed a significant fraction
of the total power. These are the low-luminosity AGN presumably responsible for radio-mode
feedback, and they dominate the total jet power output at low redshift.
Integrating the luminosity function over Pjet gives the local jet power density ρPjet, which,
at redshift zero, is of the order of ⟨ρPjet⟩∼× ergs s−Mpc−, which is comparable to the
local power density from supernovae, but will be significantly above the supernova power in
early-type galaxies (which harbor massive black holes prone to accrete in the radio mode but
no young stars and thus no type 2 supernovae).
Finally, integrating Φkin over redshift gives the total kinetic energy density uPjet released by
jets over the history of the universe, uPjet ∼× ergs Mpc−. By comparing this to the local
black hole mass density ρBH, we can derive the average conversion efficiency ηjet of accreted
black hole mass to jet power:
η ≡uPjet
ρBHc≈.% −.%.
(11.26)
In other words, about half a percent of the accreted black hole rest mass energy gets converted
to jets, averaged over the growth history of the black hole.
14Comparison to the steep-spectrum luminosity function shows that the error in ΦP from the sources missed
under the steep-spectrum luminosity function is at most a factor of 2.

Since most black hole mass was accreted during the quasar epoch, when black holes were
mostly radio quiet, about 90% of the mass of a given black hole was accreted at zero efficiency
(assuming that only 10% of quasars are radio loud). Thus, the average jet production efficiency
during radio loud accretion must be at least a factor of 10 higher, about 2–5%, comparable to the
radiative efficiency of quasars. These are exactly the kinds of efficiencies needed for radio-mode
feedback to work.
4.6 Quasar Mode Feedback
Arguments for black hole feedback on galactic scales stem primarily from three facts:
•
The deviation of the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function from self-similar predic-
tions (Springel et al. 2005), that is, a dearth of bright galaxies.
•
The bimodality of the galaxy distribution in color-magnitude space (Strateva et al. 2001),
with early-type galaxies forming the “red sequence” and late type galaxies forming the “blue
cloud.” Between these two populations lies, naturally, the so-called “green valley,” which is
relatively sparsely populated. This bimodality is shown in >Fig. 11-32.
•
The tight relation between stellarbulge massand black hole mass, which suggests a common
formation scenario. Given that massive black holes grew mostly as quasars during the epoch
of star formation, this suggests a relationship between both. In fact, the argument for quasar
mode feedback was first made in part to motivate black hole–galaxy scaling relations (e.g.,
Silk and Rees 1998; Wyithe and Loeb 2003).

the “green valley”in between both populations (Adopted from Schawinski et al. (2009))
Rapidly growing black holes are attractive as agents of feedback on ongoing star formation
because they have similar growth histories, they can be found in the centers of galactic bulges
(the stellar populations their feedback is supposed to influence), they can release large amounts
of energy isotropically, and they are likely to be fueled rapidly in response to galaxy mergers,
which also trigger star formation.
Numerical simulations of black hole feedback in individual galaxy mergers have produced
impressive visualizations of how rapid, isotropic energy injection by a growing black hole can
heat and disperse the cool, star-forming gas, in essence explosively terminating star formation
and black hole growth (Di Matteo et al. 2005). In part as a result of these successes, quasar mode
feedback is now routinely incorporated into cosmological simulations of structure formation
and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation (Croton et al. 2006; Bower et al. 2006).
In these simulations, the prescription of how black holes accrete is simplified to vari-
ations of the Bondi accretion rate, necessitated by the unresolvably vast dynamic range
of the problem. Energy is injected isotropically, which is an appropriate zero-order choice
given our lack of knowledge about the actual channel through which the energy is deliv-
ered. What the simulations tell us is that efficient black hole feedback can regulate star

Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei 11
557
formation and black hole growth. But because black hole feedback and supernova feedback
are operationally very similar and because the presumed AGN feedback mechanism is generic,
it is difficult to extract more detailed information about the AGNs themselves from the
models.
In addition, the causality of the interaction of black holes with the star-forming gas sur-
rounding them is not yet fully established. It is also plausible that star formation itself provides
the feedback through supernovae and that competitive accretion starves both black holes and
stars, leading to a passive link between black holes and stars.
Identifying currentlyongoing episodes offeedback has proven tobe difficult, in part because
of the large degrees of visible and soft X-ray extinction toward star-forming regions and because
of the small angular scales involved. Proving the causal connection between AGN activity and
terminated star formation is even more difficult.
Generally, one would assume that galaxies caught in the act of feedback should just start
their transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence, as the population of recently formed
early stars fades without any replenishment. The relative under-density of galaxies in the green
valley suggests that this transition is a relatively rapid process (one would expect it to occur
roughly on A-star life times).
Stellar population modeling has successfully been used to identify such post-starburst
galaxies. And indeed, sources have been found among this class that show clear evidence for
very fast outflows in excess of , km s−(Tremonti et al. 2007) that might be the smoking
gun. Estimating the mass in the outflow has proven to be difficult, and we have to await deep
imaging that can directly resolve the outflow to quantify the energetic impact of the AGN on
the galactic gas.
In addition, surveys of (hard) X-ray selected AGN find these sources to preferentially lie
in the green valley (from the all-sky Swift-BAT survey; Schawinski et al. 2009), as can be seen
in >Fig. 11-32. Since AGN accretion timescales can be expected to be shorter than the transi-
tion time across the green valley, this observation suggests that the AGN activity comes after star
formation has been terminated. Since this is true also for hard X-ray selected AGN, this con-
clusion should not be affected by obscuration unless AGN in the act of feedback are so heavily
obscured that even Swift cannot detect them.
Thus, the question of what is at the heart of the putative quasar mode feedback is left unan-
swered. Generally, AGN can release energy via three channels: through radiation, through jets,
and through uncollimated outflows (i.e., “winds”).
The most obvious source of feedback energy in efficiently accreting black holes is, of course,
the radiation itself. Since most bright AGN are obscured, we can infer that a high fraction of the
initially emitted light is reabsorbed by the surrounding gas. If some of the energy is deposited on
sufficiently large scales (rather than into gas bound to the black hole), it can in principle supply
the energy for feedback. Models of radiative feedback (Ciotti and Ostriker 2001; Sazonov et al.
2005) generally rely on Compton heating. The efficiency of radiative feedback requires about
10% of the radiation to be absorbed on scales outside of the Bondi radius but within the star-
forming region of the host. Whether radiative transfer will always conspire to provide such an
arrangement is an open question.
Efficiently accreting AGN (quasars and Seyferts) are also known to generate massive winds:
Optical absorption line studies show outflows at velocities of thousands of kilometers per sec-
ond. The most dramatic demonstration comes from the class of broad absorption line quasars
(BAL QSOs), which show high column densities of absorption in visible and X-rays (indicating
high mass fluxes) and wind velocities up to 50,000 km s−.

558 11
Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
If column density measurements made in the X-ray band trace the same gas that produces
the large outflow velocities in optical absorption lines, the power and mass contained in these
winds would be of the same order as the total radiative power of these objects (Furlanetto and
Loeb 2001). Driving such a wind would presumably require some form of mechanical input
(e.g., from magneto-centrifugal launching as described in
>Chap. 7) in addition to radiative
driving.
The ubiquity of outflow signatures in efficiently accreting AGN, coupled with the large wind
efficiencies inferred from the more extreme cases, has made AGN winds the primary mech-
anism invoked in feedback models (see, e.g., King 2005). Given the uncertainties in column
density of the high-velocity gas, a direct imaging detection of outflow signatures (like the cavi-
ties in the case of AGN feedback in clusters) would provide more certainty that winds can affect
the surrounding gas on the scales needed for feedback to operate.
The uncertainty about whether winds are powerful enough to drive feedback raises the
interesting question whether episodes of powerful jet activity in quasars can lead to feed-
back on galactic scales and whether they can be observed. In the simple framework of radio
source dynamics laid out in >Sect. 4.2.1, an episode of jet activity will inflate a supersonically
expanding cocoon, the size scale of which depends on the jet power and the density of the
environment.
In the dense environments of star-forming regions, one might thus expect sources to go
through a compressed evolution, with slowed or even stalled expansion as sources run into
dense gas. In such a scenario, the initial expansion might produce strong shocks (given the cold
gas they encounter) but at much reduced shock temperatures given the slower expansion. Is
it possible that powerful radio sources in dense environments can heat the gas sufficiently to
provide the quasar mode feedback postulated by semi-analytic models?
Given that about 10% of all powerful quasars are radio loud and given that the required aver-
age feedback efficiency for the quasar mode can be an order of magnitude lower still, jet powered
feedback may actually contribute significantly to the quasar mode as well. In fact, a class of
sources that might represent these powerful radio quasars in the act of feedback exists in the
so-called compact-steep-spectrum (CSS) and the gigahertz-peaked-spectrum (GPS) sources
(O’Dea 1998).
These are small-scale radio sources that show clear signs of strong absorption to the radio
spectrum (indicating a high local pressure and thus ISM density) and otherwise appear sim-
ilar to classical radio sources but on smaller scales. The cause for their compactness has been
debated since their discovery: They might be young sources, in the very early stages of super-
sonic expansion, or frustrated older sources, caught in very dense environments. In either case,
this would be a population of sources directly heating the dense gas in the centers of galaxies,
where quasar mode feedback is observed.
Recent evidence does suggest that these sources are indeed young and that we are looking
at infant powerful radio sources (e.g., Holt et al. 2008; Kunert-Bajraszewska et al. 2010).
The high rate of incidence, compared to bona fide quasars, suggests that they are a short-
lived phenomenon, which would make them effective short-cycle thermostats in a feedback
scenario.
The detection of compact radio sources in high-redshift star-forming environments seems
to support the role of jets in quasar mode feedback: A number of high-power compact
radio sources have been found in actively star-forming regions with powerful outflows
(Nesvadba et al. 2007, 2011) and in dense, high-z cooling flow environments (Siemiginowska
et al. 2010). Because we know jet feedback works in the context of clusters and likely in the

Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei 11
559
“maintenance” mode of feedback, and because we know that CSS and GPS sources are (a) fre-
quent and (b) powerful, they present an attractive alternative to the wind-driven QSO mode of
feedback.
Simulations of jets in dense, multiphase environments, as might be expected in star-forming
galaxies, already show significant promise in solving the question of how bipolar, highly colli-
mated jets in even very powerful radio sources could efficiently heat the gas in galaxies (Wagner
and Bicknell 2011).

> Sect. 3.1 that the total mass density estimated in relic supermassive
black holes at z ∼is consistent with the total mass accreted by growing black holes
during (obscured and unobscured) AGN phases for a radiative efficiency of the accretion pro-
cess (.< єrad < ., depending on the bolometric corrections and local mass density
exact estimate), well in line with the prediction of classical relativistic accretion disc models
(Novikov and Thorne 1973).
In fact, the validation of the Soltan (1982) argument implies that the last few e-folds of a
SMBH’s mass are mainly grown via (radiatively efficient) classical accretion discs, rather than
through mergers or radiatively inefficient accretion. If this is true, however, the very process of
cosmological black hole growth through accretion quickly erases the initial condition, namely,
the primordial mass function of seed black holes, making it almost impossible to deduce the
physical properties of early black hole formation from observations probing redshifts smaller
than that corresponding to the most efficient growth (z ≈−). That is, unless a specific range of
BH masses is identified which is less affected by the complex process of AGN activation during
structure formation.
Indeed, some have argued that small mass black holes in isolated, small mass galaxies could
have maintained a “memory” of the seeding mechanism (in their location with respect to the
scaling relations defined for more massive systems, for example), being less affected by the mul-
tiple generations of hierarchical mergers in the emerging cosmic web (see, e.g., Volonteri 2010).
Very few observational constraints are available for this class of objects, however.
On the other hand, the observation of luminous quasars at z ≃(e.g., Fan et al. 2001) has
shown that it is possible to probe directly the earlier epochs of massive black hole assembly and
thus to try to directly constrain the various physical processes responsible for planting the seeds
that grow into the giant monsters in the nuclei of galaxies.
5.1 The First Black Holes: Observational Constraints
and Theoretical Ideas
The observed luminosity functions of AGN suggest a rapid decline of the total luminosity den-
sity above z ≈(see > Fig. 11-18). At face value, the constraints on the very-high-redshift
evolution of the population at z > come primarily from bright optical quasars detected in very
large area surveys, but recent indications from large area and moderately deep radio (Wall et al.
2005) and X-ray (Civano et al. 2011) surveys do provide a consistent picture for the evolution
of the most luminous AGN over all observational wavebands (>Fig. 11-33).

The yellow-shaded area represents the maximum and minimum space density. The green symbols
correspond to the data of XMM-COSMOS (From Civano et al. (2011))
The observed rapid decline of QSO number density toward high redshift translates into
a rapid decrease in the number of AGN-generated ionizing photons toward the end of the
re-ionization epoch. Accurate determination of the QSO rest-frame UV luminosity function
are thus crucial to assess the role of growing black hole might have played in re-ionizing the
universe. Current estimates suggest that galaxies do dominate the comoving emissivity of ion-
izing photons esaping in the intergalactic medium at z > (Haardt and Madau 2012, and
references therein).
Despite their rarity, very-high-redshift QSOs can provide interesting constraints on the
early evolution (and even formation mechanisms) of nuclear supermassive black holes. The
high metal enrichment observed in high-z AGNs (see >Sect. 1.1), even in those close to reion-
ization (z ∼), indicates that the host galaxies of these AGNs must have undergone a powerful
and rapid burst of star formation. And indeed, vigorous star formation is observed in such
high-z quasars, as inferred from the detection of prominent PAH features, strong far-IR emis-
sion and from the detection of the [CII]158-m line (see Maiolino 2009), redshifted to millimeter

wavelengths. Most likely, we are witnessing the coeval, rapid formation of massive bulges along
with their supermassive central black holes.
These luminous quasars detected at z > , when the universe was less than 1 Gyr old
have estimated BH masses (from the “virial method”) in excess of ≈M⊙, and it is by no
means a trivial task to grow such massive holes in the relatively short time available. Assuming
continuous growth at an Eddington ratio of λ = L/LEdd:
dMBH
dt
= (−єrad)λ × LEdd/(єradc),
(11.27)
we have, for the final BH mass as a function of the initial mass,
MBH,f(t) = Mi exp [(−єrad)/єrad × (t/τsalp)],

where we have defined the typical e-folding time (the so-called Salpeter time) as

(11.29)
Depending on the redshift of formation of the seed of mass Mi, and on the average radiative
efficiency of the accretion process, only a limited range of final BH masses can be reached at
z = , as shown in >Fig. 11-34 (Shapiro 2005). If the BH seed masses are in the range expected
from Pop III remnants, of the order of a few hundred solar masses, then highly radiative efficient

(єrad > .) accretion is excluded, as it would not allow enough mass to be accumulated into the
black hole rapidly enough.
Such a scenario has a number of major difficulties. First of all, if the accretion is indeed con-
tinuous and proceeds at high Eddington rates, the accretion flow should form a geometrically
thin, optically thick disc. If this is the case, even a black hole with zero initial dimensionless
angular momentum ai = will be rapidly spun up by the angular momentum captured with
the accreting gas. Bardeen (1970) has shown that in this case, the final spin obeys:

.
(11.30)
where rms,i is the radius of the marginally stable orbit of the initial black hole (itself a mono-
tonic function of spin, with rms(a = ) = and rms(a = ) = in gravitational units). Thus,
an initially non-spinning BH is spun up by accretion of gas in a classical geometrically thin
and optically thick accretion disc as soon as15 M f /Mi =
√
. Since an accretion disc around a
maximally rotating hole will radiate with an efficiency єrad = ., we are left with the impossi-
bility of growing black holes larger than a few thousands of solar masses via prolonged coherent
accretion onto a stellar mass seed (see >Fig. 11-34).
A few solutions have been proposed to the above problem:
1. First, accretion might not be coherent, but rather stochastic, such that the accreting gas
comes into the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole in parcels with randomly
oriented angular momenta. If the mass of each parcel is small enough (roughly speaking, if
ΔM ≪
√
Mi), then the BH spin vector performs a random walk, but as it is easier to spin a
black hole down than up, the net effect is a relatively low average spin (and correspondingly
lower radiative efficiency) of the final hole (King and Pringle 2006).
2. In the primordial cosmological setup where protogalaxies form, the first black holes grow
in a very gas-rich environment, and there is no reason to believe that the gas could not
flow toward the central black holes at vastly super-Eddington rates. It is not clear, however,
whether the hole can swallow matter that fast. On the one hand, quasi-spherical inflows
can be established, where the radial velocity of the accreting gas is so high that the pho-
tons produced inside the disc by the viscous torques cannot escape (Frank et al. 2002).
In those cases, although the emerging luminosity is at most logarithmically in excess of the
Eddington limit, the accretion rate onto the hole can be orders of magnitude larger. On the
other hand, the accretion flow can start blowing out matter at the (large) radius where the
locally produced energy exceeds the local Eddington limit (Shakura and Sunyaev 1973).
A powerful wind ensues, which may prevent the mass accretion rate onto the black hole
from exceeding the Eddington limit by more than a factor of a few.
3. Black hole seeds in the early universe can be more massive than the remnants of Pop III stars.
These would have formed by direct collapse of primordial massive stars (see, e.g., Volonteri
2010). For example, some theoretical models have argued that the gas chemistry in the most
massive, hottest primordial DM halos can prevent fragmentation of the cooling gas and lead
to the formation of very massive stars. Their cores will rapidly collapse, leaving a black hole
15Note that the above calculation assumes that there is no torque at the inner boundary of the accretion disc
(Novikov and Thorne 1973). Magnetic linkage between the disc, the plunging region, and the event horizon
can modify the above picture, reducing the maximal spin a BH can reach (Krolik et al. 2005). Nonetheless,
most numerical models of geometrically thin magnetized discs are still consistent with a rapid spin of the BH.

at the center of a quasi-static, radiation pressure-supported supermassive star. The resulting
object, called a quasistar, resembles a red giant with a luminosity comparable to a Seyfert
nucleus. The black hole grows inside it until the cooling photosphere can no longer sustain
its own radiation pressure and the envelope disperses, leaving behind the naked seed black
hole of typically –M⊙(Begelman 2010).
4. Finally, a large number of major mergers could help relax the demands on the efficiency and
stability of gas accretion on the first black holes by enhancing the final-to-initial mass ratio
by a factor of the order of the number of equal-mass (or major) mergers along the main tree
of the hierarchy.
Cosmological numerical simulations (Li et al. 2007) provide a possible route to the for-
mation of a M⊙at z ∼by starting with Pop III stellar mass seeds at z ∼which
experience an early phase of continuous, Eddington-limited accretion (subject, however, to
the limitations discussed above), before entering the merger tree at z ∼, where a large
number of major merger events is able to accumulate the final mass, even in the presence of
AGN feedback.
Analytic and semi-analytic models of the early assembly of massive black holes that include
(with varying degrees of sophistication) the many competing processes (mergers, gravitational
wave recoil and nuclear black hole ejection, dynamical friction on wandering BHs, pristine gas
accretion, etc.) make clear predictions for the early seed mass distributions, the initial condi-
tions for SMBH growth that we would like to probe. >Figure 11-35 shows one such prediction,
comparing the outcomes of three different formation scenarios: direct collapse, runaway stellar
mergers in high-redshift stellar clusters, and Population III remnants. A more complete census

of large astronomical facilities could provide direct means to distinguish among these simple
formation scenarios, allowing us to glimpse into the obscured epoch when the first nuclear
black holes formed.

The Intergalactic Medium
Abstract:
The intergalactic medium has contained, and still does, most of the matter in the
universe. Galaxies form out of matter that originates from the intergalactic medium. The radia-
tion from stars in galaxies plays an essential role in writing the ionization and thermal histories
of the intergalactic medium. Galaxies return matter back to the intergalactic medium in the
form of galactic winds powered by stellar winds and supernova explosions that in addition
transport energyand metals. The various forms offeedback exerted on the intergalacticmedium
by galaxies have profound effects on subsequent galaxy formation. This two-way interaction
between galaxies and the intergalactic medium is the primary driver of the formation and evo-
lution of both. This chapter synthesizes our current knowledge of this interaction, focusing
mainly on the evolution of the intergalactic medium. While it covers the entire redshift range
from z = 1,100 to z = , the content is heavily skewed toward lower redshift, reflecting the
current state of knowledge.
Keywords: Cosmology: observations, Intergalactic medium, Large-scale structure of universe

Introduction
More than 99% of the space in the present-dayuniverse is occupied by the intergalactic medium
(IGM), a tenuous gas in the intergalactic space of density lower than −atom per cubic cen-
timeter. Toward higher redshift, the IGM takes a still higher percentage of space, with its mean
density going up as (+ z), where z is redshift, due to the expansion of the universe with
time. The IGM provides the fuel for galaxy formation and serves as the depository for mate-
rial returned from star formation. The thermal, ionization, and metal-enrichment histories of
the IGM are very complex and an active research subject area in the contemporary research of
formation and evolution of galaxies and IGM.
This chapter provides an up-to-date review on these histories, chronologically separated
into three periods: (1) Dark Ages, z = 30–1,000; (2) Epoch of Reionization, z = 6–30; and (3)
Growth of Modern Structures, z = 0–6. The knowledge content of the periods increases with
time, a reflection of the current state of knowledge. The presented history is expected to take
place in the context of the current standard cosmological constant-dominated cold dark matter
model (Komatsu et al. 2011) that is widely accepted,and where direct observations are available,
it is largely in agreement with them. Alternative theories will not be described in the interest of
space.

Dark Ages: z = 30–1,100
The universe is believed to begin with a hot Big Bang (Lemaître 1931). Subsequently, it expands
and its content cools. By the time when the universe is about 300,000 years old, it has cooled to
a temperature of about 3,000 K that hydrogen atoms begin to form, a landmark phase tran-
sition in the IGM that is termed “cosmological recombination” – the IGM switches from a
plasma to a neutral medium. Most of the early history of the IGM preceding the dark ages – at
z ≥1,100 – is relatively well understoodand its dynamics is analytically tractable (Peebles 1993).
The state of the IGM at the cosmological recombination at z ∼1,100 has been directly measured
by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, as shown in >Fig. 12-1. At that
moment, the density and temperature fluctuations in the IGM are about ten parts in a million

A CMB temperature ﬂuctuation map from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
observations (This ﬁgure is taken from Bennett et al. (2003))
(e.g., Spergel et al. 2003). These small density fluctuations will grow with time under the attrac-
tive action of gravity, in conjunction with other astrophysical processes, to ultimately produce
the complex universe we see around us that is filled with galaxies, stars, and planets.
What follows is the period termed the cosmic “Dark Ages” (DA) (Peacock 1992), over which
the universe grows by a factor of about 30. During this period, the IGM continues to cool pas-
sively as the universe continues to expand, until the formation of the very first gravitationally
bound astrophysical system – a star or a black hole that shines, ending the DA. When the first
star or black hole forms is unknown. The relevant cosmological parameters that determine the
redshift of the formation of first star or black hole are the amplitude and shape of the den-
sity fluctuation power spectrum of matter. Because the formation (i.e., gravitational collapse)
epoch of the very first cosmic structure depends rather sensitively on these two parameters, the
exact ending redshift of the DA is imprecisely known theoretically in the context of the param-
eters that are presently observationally measured to an accuracy of 5–10% (Seljak et al. 2005;
Komatsu et al. 2011). The most likely range is z = 30–50 (Barkana and Loeb 2001), when the
universe is about 50–100 million years old.
The DA is thus rather uneventful: there is no star and black hole or any significant astronom-
ical systems that are capable of producing a significant amount of energy, either tapping into
gravitational or nuclear potential, to affect their surroundings. Nonetheless, four points may be
noted about the IGM during the DA. First, the temperature of the IGM decreases as (+ z)
nearly uniformly. Second, the density of the IGM decreases as (+ z)nearly uniformly. Third,
near the end of this period some overdense regions on various small mass scales of ≤M⊙
gradually decouple from the universal expansion and turnaround en route to gravitational col-
lapse. Finally, the IGM is predominantly neutral with an ionization fraction of ∼−, a remnant
of the cosmological recombination event. As a result, the universe is opaque to all light blueward
of the Lyman alpha line wavelength of , Å.

Epoch of Reionization: z = 6–30
Following the formation of the first star or black hole, the era of the DA comes to an end. So
does the phase of passive cooling of the IGM, because stars and black holes exert feedback on
the IGM in several ways. First, radiation from stars and black holes provides a source of heating
and ionization of the IGM. Second, mechanical energy in the forms of winds from stars and
black holes affects their surroundings, including the IGM. Finally, these winds also carry metals
produced in stars, and they contaminate the primordial IGM with metals that have profound
effects on subsequent formation of stars, black holes, and galaxies.
The subsequent thermal history of the IGM is determined by an intricate balance of pri-
marily three competing processes – the universal expansion that cools it, radiative heating by
stars and black holes, and gravitational interactions. This rather prolonged epoch, from the end
of the DA to the end of reionization, is called the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The prevail-
ing theory is that the primary ionizing source for EoR are stars. While the precise history of
the EoR is not known, one may make a plausible theoretical estimate. > Figure 12-2 shows
the density fluctuation history and hence formation redshift of dark matter halos. In the stan-
dard cold dark matter model, most of the nonrelativistic dynamical matter is in an unknown

form dubbed “cold dark matter” that is believed to be nonbaryonic. The dynamics on galactic
and larger scales are largely determined by dark matter halos, within which galaxies form and
live. Equipped with this basic knowledge and plausible (but very uncertain) assumptions about
the astrophysics of galaxy formation in that era, one can sketch out the history of IGM in the
EoR era. >Figure 12-3 shows a theory where the universe turns out to be reionized twice, once
at z ∼and then again at z ∼, in the context of the cold dark matter model (Cen 2003).
This model is consistent with all extant observations, including quasar absorption spectrum
measurements at z ∼(Fan et al. 2006) and the CMB observations (Komatsu et al. 2011). The
bimodal reionization picture originates from the bimodal nature of stellar radiation efficiency,
where Population III (Pop III) stars – the very first generation of stars that form out of prestine
primordial gas – are much more efficient, by a factor of ∼20, in producing hydrogen ionizing
photons than the subsequent Pop II stars that form out of metal-enriched gas (Bromm et al.
2001). In the left panel, the inflection point at z ∼follows the birth of the very first star at
a slightly higher redshift. A sustained ascent in the mean temperature of the IGM from z ∼
up to the redshift of the first reionization at z ∼reflects a continued heating by an increasing
star formation rate with time. Subsequently, the mean temperature of the IGM is roughly main-
tained at K, due to the action of two counter-balancing effects: substantial cooling reduces
the Jeans mass of the IGM and increases the star formation rate, which then provides increased
heating by photoionization that in turn suppresses star formation. Thus, the mean temperature
of the IGM is self-regulateddue to the competition between the cooling (mostly Compton cool-
ing by the cosmic microwave background) and photoheating due to ionization of hydrogen and
helium atoms by Lyman continuum ultraviolet photons. In the cold dark matter cosmological
model with the measured parameters (Komatsu et al. 2011), it happens that the star formation

activities are at a level such that the two balancing terms are comparable in magnitude when
temperature is maintained at ∼K, thus resulting in a fairly mild evolution of the IGM mean
temperature seen. By redshift z ∼, the star formation rate has surpassed a threshold such that
the rate of recombination between protons and electrons in a significantly neutral medium is no
longer capable of balancing the photo-ionization rate by stars: the universe is now fully ionized
finally and for all.
The temperature evolution shown in the left panel of > Fig. 12-3 is accompanied by the
global evolution of ionization fraction shown in the right panel. The first reionization at z ∼
as well as the sustained ionized state until z ∼is made possible by Pop III stars. The redshift
z ∼marks the transition from Pop III stars to Pop II stars, which occurs after a fraction −
of total gas has formed into Pop III stars and IGM is metal-enriched to a critical value, causing
the emission of hydrogen ionizing photons to plunge. The suddenly reduced hydrogen ionizing
photon emission is no longer able to counter the rapid hydrogen recombination process, result-
ing in the second cosmological recombination at z ∼. Since a very small amount of neutral
fraction suffices to blank out all Lyα emission, the universe essentially becomes opaque to Lyα
photons from z ∼to z ∼.
A key issue is the ionizing photon budgetary constraints during cosmological reioniza-
tion: how many ionizing photons per atom are required? Since the IGM contains nearly all the
baryons in the universe during EoR, the minimum, necessary requirement is one ionizing pho-
ton per hydrogen atom. To facilitate understanding, it is useful to show some important time
scales involved. The left panel of >Fig. 12-4 shows the ratio of hydrogen recombination time
over the Hubble time and the ratio of Compton cooling time over the Hubble time. It is noted

that at the redshift and density of interest, Compton cooling dominates over other cooling pro-
cesses for the general IGM, although adiabatic cooling starts to become important approaching
the end of the final reionization epoch. It is seen that the hydrogen recombination time is sig-
nificantly longer than the Compton cooling time, both of which are, however, shorter than the
Hubble time at z ≥. Therefore, the IGM at early times heated up by the photoionization would
subsequently not only cool down but also recombine. Because ionized hydrogen has a tendency
to recombine to become neutral and because the recombination time scale is shorter than the
Hubble time, the actual number of ionizing photons per hydrogen needs to exceed unity in
order to fully reionize the universe. From the right panel of >Fig. 12-4, it is seen that at the
epoch of the first reionization about two ionizing photons per baryon have been produced by
Pop III stars. About −fraction of gas formed into Pop III stars then. More than ten ionizing
photons per baryon have been produced by the time the universe is reionized for the second
time at z = . By this time, about % of the total gas has formed into Pop II stars that are primar-
ily responsible for the final reionization. The more stringent requirement for ionizing photons
at z ∼than at z ∼stems from the fact that the IGM becomes increasingly clumpy in nature,
which substantially lowers the recombination time scale of the IGM as a whole, even though
the mean density of the IGM has decreased with time.
The starting redshift as well as the overall evolution of the IGM in the EoR era are still
quite uncertain. Other plausible models can be designed to meet extant observational con-
straints (e.g., Haiman and Holder 2003). The primary constraint on the duration and starting
redshift comes from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations that
give an integral constraint of the Thomson optical depth τe = .± .due to scattering
by free electrons in the IGM (e.g., Dunkley et al. 2009). The above double reionization pic-
ture yields τe = .± .that is consistent with this constraint. The ending redshift of EoR, if
defined as the redshift when the universe becomes transparent to Lyα photons, is, however, very
well constrained observationally by quasar absorption spectra of the hydrogen Lyman alpha
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (Fan et al. 2006), as shown in >Fig. 12-5. It is seen
in >Fig. 12-5 that there is a complete lack of photon flux down to an observed wavelength of
about λobs ≈, Å, whereas measurable non-zero flux is detected at still shorter wavelengths
for each spectrum of the high-redshift quasars. The observed wavelength λobs is related to the
intrinsic restframe wavelength λint = , Å by λobs = , (+ z) Å. There is clear evidence
that redshift z ∼.marks a transition from an opaque to transparent universe to Lyα photons,
another landmark event in the cosmic history.

Growth of Modern Structures: z = 0–6
Following the completion of the cosmological reionization at z ∼, the IGM becomes increas-
ingly more transparent, primarily due to the fact that the mean optical depth of the IGM at the
restframe Lyα wavelength decreases with redshift approximately as (+ z)/at a fixed neutral
fraction. The number density of quasars, which are the background light sources for absorption
spectrum observations, is observed toincrease rapidlywith decreasing redshift. In combination,
the IGM can be probed with increasing precision and statistics at lower redshift. The amount of
direct observational data is very rich. Because of this reason, this section is subdivided into
several subsections organized around distinct IGM absorption systems. First in > Sect. 4.1
a description of the global evolution of the IGM from z ∼to z = is given, followed by

4.1 The Global History of IGM at z = 0–6
Before describing more quantitatively, it is useful to give a simple and surprisingly accurate
order of magnitude physical argument. In all standard pictures for the growth of structure, there
is imprinted at an early time a spectrum of perturbations, with the amplitude of the fluctuations
being largest at small scales and smaller at larger scales. After decoupling at z ∼, , all waves
grow (due to self-gravity) roughly as (+z)−. They have reached the nonlinear length and mass
scales of 5–7 h−Mpc and (5–10) × h−M⊙, respectively, by z = . When a perturbation of a
given scale L collapses at time t due to gravity, geometry indicates it must do so with a velocity
v ≈L/t and, as opposite sides of the collapsing perturbation meet and attempt to cross one
another, a shock is generated behind which the sound speed is C ≈v. Combining these simple
arguments and noting that t−≈Hz gives us
C
z = K(HzLnl)
z,
(12.1)
where K is a numerical constant and Hz and Lnl,z are the Hubble constant and nonlinear length
scale at epoch z, respectively. Applying this to the current epoch (with K = ) gives Co ∼500–
700 km s−, which corresponds to a temperature of (2–4) × K. This should correspond to
the typical temperature of recently collapsed (i.e., high density) objects, with the global mean
temperaturesomewhatlower. Note that K is only a dimensionless numberto indicate the nature
of the scaling relation and is not intended to model shock jump conditions.
Detailed cosmological simulations produce results that are consistent with this physical
argument. >Figure 12-6 shows the mean computed temperature as a function of redshift based
on cosmological simulations. The volume weighted average temperature at z = is .K, the
mass (ρ) weighted average temperature is .K (the value given by (> 12.1) with K = ), and
the ρweighted average (roughly speaking emission weighted) is .K. Thus, the high-density
regions are in just the temperature domain indicated by (> 12.4) with the constant taken to be
unity; in other words, ( > 12.1) (adopting K = ) in fact roughly tracks the density-weighted
averages from redshift three onward, confirming the simple physical picture presented earlier.
Now examine the overall thermal evolution of the IGM in greater detail, dividing the IGM
into three temperature ranges: (1) T < K cold-warm gas, a dominant portion of which is
the Lyα forest described in > Sect. 4.2; (2) K> T > K gas, which is termed “warm-
hot intergalactic medium” (WHIM) and is mainly in unvirialized regions that will be detailed
in >Sect. 4.6; and (3) T > K, the normal X-rayemitting gas, predominantly in collapsed and
virialized X-rayclusters ofgalaxies. Alast component (4)is the cold gas that has been condensed
into stellar objects, which is designated as “galaxies.” >Figure 12-7 shows the evolution of these
four components. The overall evolution of the four components are in good agreement and
relevant observations (e.g., Fukugita et al. 1998). In particular, the hot component (T > K)
increases in mass fraction, reaching % by mass at z = , and is consistent with observations of
the local properties of the X-ray emitting great clusters of galaxies. The condensed component
remains small (8%) but consistent with the observed mass density in galaxies at z = (Cole
et al. 2001). While most of the volume is always filled with T < K gas (Lyα forest) at all

redshift, the mass fraction of the cold-warm IGM declines from nearly % at z > to %
at z = , consistent with both high (Rauch 1998) and low redshift observations (Penton et al.
2004) of Lyα forest. About 40–50% of all baryons are in WHIM by the time z = .
Each of the IGM components is composed of different regions that have gone through dis-
tinct evolutionary paths and thus spans a wide range in density, as shown in >Fig. 12-8. The
distribution of the cold-warm component (triangles) is always peaked at the mean density at all
redshifts, reflecting the initial Gaussian distribution of gas around the cosmic mean and indi-
cating that the bulk of the IGM at mean density or lower has never been shock heated by either
gravitational shocks or feedback shocks due to galactic winds. The cold-warm gas extends to
very high densities (≥). It is interesting to note that the amount of cold-warm gas that could
potentially feed the star formation, i.e., the cold-warm gas at density log ρ/ < ρ >≥2–3, remains
constant, within a factor of ∼2, over the range redshift shown z = 0–5. This is consistent with
observations of the nearly nonevolving amount of gas probed by DLAs (e.g., Péroux et al. 2003).
The physical relation between this apparently nonevolving gas and the precipitous drop of star
formation rate at z < is currently unclear.
The distribution of the WHIM also appears to peak at a constant overdensity of about ten
times the mean density. This is rather intriguing. In order to properly interpret this interesting
phenomenon, it is useful to understand the heating sources of WHIM. There are two primary

heating sources for WHIM: shocks due to the collapse of large-scale structure and galactic
wind-produced shocks. Studies have shown that gravitational shock heating due to the for-
mation of large-scale structure dominates the energy input for heating up and thus turning
about % of the IGM into WHIM by z = (Cen and Ostriker 1999; Davé et al. 2001; Cen
and Ostriker 2006). It is, however, expected that heating due to hydrodynamic shocks emanat-
ing from galactic winds become increasingly more important at higher redshifts because the
amount of energy from gravitational collapse of large-scale structure as well as the resulting
shock velocity decreases steeply toward higher redshift (Cen and Chisari 2011). For the case
of galactic wind-generated shocks, if gas is shock heated to K, the shock velocity is roughly
70 km s−. With that velocity, the shock will be able to travel roughly (+ z)−kpc comoving
over the Hubble time at any redshift. Therefore, one should expect to see shocks have reached a
few hundred kpc comoving at any redshift, which are about one to a few times the virial radius
of typical large galaxies, which in turn correspond to an overdensity in the vicinity of and are
thus in good agreement with simulation results. Some shocks penetrate deeper into the IGM,
especially along directions with lower densities and steeperdensity gradients, but the amount of
mass effected in these low-density regions is small, corresponding to the sharp drop of WHIM
mass at the low-density end (>Fig. 12-8). This last point is best corroborated by the distribution
of the hot gas at high redshift (z = , ), in the bottom two panels of >Fig. 12-8. There, a small
amount of hot gas heated up by GSW shocks is indeed produced in regions of density lower

mass contained (This ﬁgure is taken from Cen and Chisari (2011))
than the mean density and traces a larger amount of WHIM gas that is also produced there.
At z = and lower, some comparable, small amount of hot gas is still produced at low-density
regions. But the vast majority of hot X-ray emitting gas is now residing in the deep potential
wells of X-ray clusters of galaxies, when the cluster scale turns nonlinear and collapses.
4.2 Lyα Forest
The previous section shows that most of the IGM at moderate to high redshift (z > ) should
be in the cold-warm phase that comprises mostly the Lyα forest. For a background quasar its
emitted light redshifts to longer wavelength, when traveling toward the observer on Earth. For a
photon of wavelength shorter than the Lyα line wavelength, it may be redshifted to the restframe
Lyα line center at some redshift. If at that redshift a significant amount of neutral hydrogen
atoms intercept the line of sight to the quasar, that photon will be scattered out of the line of

sight, causing a dip at the corresponding wavelength in the observed flux spectrum. This could
occur for photons of different initial wavelengths, resulting in a forest-like quasar spectrum,
hence the Lyα forest. >Figure 12-9 shows an example of an observed quasar spectrum. One can
measure the corresponding neutral hydrogen column density for each spectral dip. The neutral
hydrogen column density for Lyα forest ranges from to cm−. Because the background
quasar and its foreground absorbers are unrelated, absorption spectrum provides an unbiased
probe of the IGM.
The physical origin of neutral hydrogen concentrations that produce the spectral dips in
the quasars spectrum was not fully understood until mid-1990s, when cosmological hydrody-
namic simulations show that the fluctuating density field at moderate redshift during structure
formation can naturally explain the observed Lyα forest (Cen et al. 1994; Zhang et al. 1995;
Hernquist et al. 1996; Miralda-Escude et al. 1996). >Figure 12-10 shows the iso-density surface
structure of the IGM at three different densities. It is seen that the IGM forms an intercon-
nected network of sheets and filaments at 3 times the mean density (or below) at z = ,
whereas at 30 times the mean densitythe regions are well separated and isolated. Roughlyspeak-
ing, at (, , ) times the mean density, the corresponding column density of Lyα clouds is
(−, −, −) cm−, respectively, at redshift z = 2–4.
>Figure 12-11 shows detailed distribution of density, temperature, and velocity divergence
in a thin slice of IGM at z = . Placing a quasar at the left end of the top horizontal dashed
line (out of the four horizontal lines) one obtains an example synthetic spectrum shown in the
top panel of >Fig. 12-12 along with the physical properties of the IGM that gives rise to the
obtained spectral features. From > Fig. 12-11 to > Fig. 12-12 it is clear that intersections of
lines of sight to quasars with the cosmic web produce the most common Lyα forest lines. These
regions tend to be moderately overdense and demarcated by outward shocks at both sides. An
ensemble of such synthetic spectra may be generated and observables extracted to be compared
with direct observations. It is found that the standard cold dark matter model can reproduce
the observed Lyα forest without introducing any additional free parameters. > Figure 12-13
shows one measure of such agreements between theory and observations with respect to the
distribution of column densities of Lyα forest lines.

Doppler width distribution, allows one, in turn, to use Lyα observations to precisely constrain
cosmological parameters. CMB observations provide tight constraints on many fundamental
cosmological parameters including the power spectrum of the matter density fluctuation, but
CMB observations alone do not have the necessary leverage to precisely constrain the slope
of the power spectrum. The Lyα forest flux distribution provides the only competitively accu-
rate measurement of the matter power spectrum at small scales. The statistical accuracies to
determine the amplitude, slope, and curvature of the density power spectrum using Lyα forest
from large SDSS QSO samples have reached unprecedented 1–3% level (e.g., Mandelbaumet al.
2003). Thus, Lyα forest observations and CMB observations jointly will be able to nail down the
matter power spectrum to a unprecedented level that may test fundamental theories, such as
inflationary theories (Seljak et al. 2005).

4.3 Lyman Limit Systems
Over about ten decades of cloud column density from to cm−, the interval from to
cm−is termed the Lyman limit systems (LLSs), because they are optically thick to Lyman
continuum photons at λ < Å. Since the completion of cosmological reionization (i.e., at
z < ), LLSs determines how far a Lyman continuum photon can travel before it gets absorbed
by a neutral hydrogen atom. As a result, LLSs are responsible for establishing the amplitude of
ionizing ultraviolet (UV) background at z < and are cosmologically important entities. While
a significant sample of observed LLS is available (e.g., Storrie-Lombardi et al. 1994; Prochaska
et al. 2010), their properties are not well understood for two reasons. First, observationally,
LLSs have absorption profiles that are saturated (i.e., the optical depth at the core is substan-
tially greater than unity) but are not damped (see >Sect. 4.4 for damped Lyman alpha systems).
Because of that, it is difficult to precisely measure the column density of an LLS, even with high-
resolution high signal-to-noise spectra. This is evident in >Fig. 12-14 by the large errorbar for
the column density range where LLS are located. Second, theoretically, unlike Lyα forest, the
LLSs are optically thick to Lyman continuum photons. Consequently, it is much more difficult
to simulate LLS, and currently no fully consistent model has been enacted to statistically address
the issue, although several pioneering attempts have been made (e.g., Katz et al. 1996; Gardner
et al. 1997a; Kohler and Gnedin 2007). In conclusion, while LLSs are a very important compo-
nent of the Lyα absorption lines, much progress still needs to be made to have a satisfactory
physical understanding.

4.4 Damped Lyα Systems
Damped Lyα systems (DLAs) are significant because they contain most of the neutral gas in the
universe at all times since cosmological reionization (e.g., Storrie-Lombardi and Wolfe 2000;
Péroux et al. 2003; Prochaska and Wolfe 2009). Molecular clouds, within which star formation
takes place, condense out of cold dense neutral atomic gas contained in DLAs, evidenced by
the fact that the neutral hydrogen (surface) density in DLAs and molecular hydrogen (surface)
density in molecular clouds form a continuous sequence (e.g., Zwaan and Prochaska 2006), as
shown in >Fig. 12-15. Therefore, DLAs hold key to understanding the fuel for and ultimately
galaxy formation. A substantial amount of recent theoretical work has been devoted to studying
the nature of DLAs (e.g., Pontzen et al. 2008; Tescari et al. 2009; Hong et al. 2010) since the first
investigation of Katz et al. (1996) in the context of the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogony.
Here, an up-to-date account is given based on lastest cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
(Cen 2012).
Until now, no single model has been able to match the observed velocity width distribution
of DLAs in that models underpredict the abundance of large velocity width DLAs, where veloc-
ity width is defined to be the velocity interval of 90% of the optical depth of the unsaturated
Si II λ1808 (or other low-ionization metal lines) absorption line associated with the DLA, v
(Prochaska and Wolfe 1997); the velocity structure in Lyα flux of a DLA is “damped” and does
not provide the kinematic information of the underlying physical cloud. >Figure 12-16 shows
the velocity width distribution at three redshifts (z = ., ., .) from latest simulations. The
two sets of curves, one labeled “C” and the other “V,” are expected to bracket the true prediction

range of z = 1.7–4.5 (This ﬁgure is taken from Cen (2012) )
of the cold dark matter model. Insofar as the observed velocity width distribution function lies
in between the two bracketing sets and the shape of the functions are in excellent agreement
with observations, including the high-velocity tail (v≥km s−), one could claim that the
standard cold dark matter model can successfully explain this observed DLAs with respect to
the velocity width distribution. The most important new ingredient in the latest simulations
are large-scale simulations with very high resolution, properly sampling and resolving close
interactions of galaxies that previously were not adequately modeled. These close interactions
significantlyincreases DLAcross section foreach galaxyin a mass-dependent fashion in that, on
average, larger galaxies that tend to experience more interactions than smaller ones have larger
increase in DLA cross sections relative to their stellar disk size or a fixed fraction of the area
within the halo virial radius. The ubiquity of large-scale neutral cross sections at high redshift
is illustrated in >Fig. 12-17, where the DLA cross section and disk size for a random set of four
galaxies are contrasted and ubiquitous extended structures are common due to galaxy-galaxy
interactions at very high redshift (z ≥).
This newlyfound physical nature of DLAs at high redshift – extended filamentary structures
instead of stellar disks – has its signature imprinted in the metallicity and size distribution of
DLAs. >Figure 12-18 shows the DLA metallicity distributions at four redshift, z = , ., ., ..

density maps in SDSS z band in units of L⊙kpc−2. The even rows are the logarithm of the corresponding neutral gas column density maps in units of cm−2.

⊡Fig. 12-18
Shows the DLA metallicity distributions at four redshift, z = 0, 1.6, 3.1, 4.0, for both “C” (red his-
tograms) and “V” (green histograms) run. The observational data are from Prochaska et al. (2005),
shown as black histograms. Because there is non-negligible evolution, the comparisons between
simulationsat a given redshift are only made with observed DLAswithin a narrow redshift window,
as shown. Probabilities that simulated and observed samples are drawn from the same underlying
distribution are indicated in each panel, separately for “C” and “V” run (This ﬁgure is taken from
Cen (2012))
For the three redshifts, z = ., ., ., where comparisons can be made, it is found that the
agreementbetween simulations and observations at z = .to z = is excellent, as Kolmogorov-
Smirnov tests show. It is seen that the peak of the DLA metallicity distribution evolves from
[Z/H] = −.at z = 3–4, to [Z/H] = −.at z = ., and to [Z/H] = −.at z = . In the
used convention, [Z/H] = corresponds to solar metallicity value and [Z/H] = −means
one-tenth of solar metallicity, [Z/H] = −means one hundredth of solar metallicity, etc. Both
simulations and nature indicate that there is a weak but real evolution in DLA metallicity. What
is also important to note is that, in agreement with observations, simulations indicate that the
distribution of metallicity is very wide, spanning three or more decades at z ≥1.6–4. This wide
range reflects the rich variety of neutral gas that composes the DLA population, from pristine
gas clouds falling onto or feeding galaxies to cold neutral gas clouds in galactic disks. There is a
metallicity floor at [Z/H] ∼−at z = 1.6–4, and that floor moves up to [Z/H] ∼−.by z = ,

consistent with observations (Prochaska et al. 2003). The distribution at z = is significantly
narrower, partly reflecting the overall enrichment of the IGM and partly due to much reduced
variety of DLAs with galactic disks becoming a more dominant contributor to DLAs.
>Figure 12-19 shows the size (radius) distribution at redshift z = , ., ., .for individ-
ual DLA size and total DLA size of each galaxy. >Figure 12-20 presents the size information
in a different way, where the probability that, for a random pair of sightlines separated by
(, , , , )kpc at the redshift in question, one sightline intercepts a DLA and the other
intercepts a column density lower than shown in the x-axis. On average, individual DLA size
as well as the total DLA size of galaxies are larger at high redshift than at lower redshift. This is
consistent with the gradual dominance of contribution from stellar disk with decreasing red-
shift. The individual DLA size distribution appears to sharply peak at rDLA ∼kpc at z = ,
then move left to a broader peak at rDLA ∼10–12 kpc at z = ., then sharpen somewhat to peak
at rDLA ∼4–5 kpc at z = ., and finally move rightward slightly to peak at rDLA ∼6–7 kpc at
z = . What is quite remarkable is that, at z = .and z ∼where comparisons can be made, the
predicted size distributions and the available observations agree very well. This is a testament
to the success of the standard cold dark matter model.
Finally, the model also successfully reproduces the following properties of DLAs: column
density distribution evolution, line density evolution, kinematic structural parameters evolu-
tion, neutral mass content evolution, and others. Taking all together, it is concluded that the
standard cold dark matter model can now satisfactorily explain all observed properties of DLAs.
The next frontier of research in this subject area will be to understand what role DLAs play in
fueling galaxy formation.
4.5 Metal-Line Systems
One of the pillars of the Big Bang theory is its successful prediction of a primordial baryonic
matter composition for the IGM, made up of nearly 100% hydrogen and helium with a trace
amount of a few other light elements (e.g., Schramm and Turner 1998). Galaxies, collectively
through stellar winds and supernova explosions, return a significant amount of material that
formed into stars back to the IGM, including “metals” – in the astronomers’ term, all elements
in the periodic table except H and He that are nucleosynthesized in stars. Metals are found
almost everywhere in the observable IGM, ranging from the metal-rich intracluster medium
(e.g., Mushotzky and Loewenstein 1997) to moderately enriched damped Lyman systems (e.g.,
Pettini et al. 1997; Prochaska et al.2003)tolow metallicityLyman alpha clouds (e.g., Schaye et al.
2003). It is generally believed that metals in the IGM originate in galaxies. To see how metals
produced in galaxies get transported to the IGM via galactic winds powered collectively by stel-
lar winds and supernova explosions, >Fig. 12-21 shows the spatial distribution of metallicity in
the IGM with (left panel) and without (right panel) galactic winds from cosmological hydrody-
namic simulations. While other, gravitational and hydrodynamic processes do transport metals
to the vicinity (≤∼kpc) of galaxies (right panel of >Fig. 12-5), galactic winds clearly play
a more important role to transport the metals from galaxies to larger distances, in conjunction
with other processes. The “metal bubbles” (reddish bubbles seen in the left panel of >Fig. 12-21)
have the ratio of metal density to total gas density (i.e., metallicity) equal to ρmetals/ρgas ∼−,
indicating that these metal-contaminated regions are enriched to a metallicity close to about
1% of solar value. Most of the volume far from galaxies, however, remains uncontaminated
by galactic winds. What is the metallicity of the IGM in low-density regions that are distant

from galaxies? Is there gas that is still primordial? These questions remain unanswered obser-
vationally. Theoretically, large uncertainties exist, primarily due to lack of knowledge of galaxy
formation at high redshift.
Needless to say, matter that ends up in stars comes from the IGM. In other words, the inter-
actions between galaxies and the IGM are two-way. Thus, probing the IGM, especially with
metals, yields vital information about the physical process of galaxy formation and feedback.
Astronomers have done this for decades. Metal-line absorption systems in QSO spectra are the
primary probes of the metal enrichment of the IGM as well as in the vicinities of galaxies. The
most widely used metal lines include Mg II λλ2796, 2803 doublet; C IV λλ1548, 1550 doublet;
and O VI λλ1032, 1038 doublet. A brief up-to-date account of the C IV and O VI absorption
lines and the global evolution of metals in the IGM in the redshift range z = 0–6 is given here
in the context of theory confronted with observations. The C IV λλ1548, 1550 doublet places
itself at the redward of Lyα line and hence is easily distinguished from the Lyα forest lines. The
ionization potential of O VI and the relatively high oxygen abundance are very favorable for
production of O VI absorbers in the IGM. The rest wavelength of OVI (1,032, 1,037 Å) places
it within the Ly-α forest, which makes the identifications of these lines more complicated. O VI
absorption lines can probe the metal content of the IGM in ways complementary to what is pro-
vided by C IV lines. For example, the O VI lines can probe IGM that is hotter than that probed
by the C IV lines and can reach lower densities thanks to higher abundance.
For a statistically understood sample of QSO absorption lines, one could derive the cos-
mological density contained in them. Early investigations indicate that ΩCIV remains approxi-
mately constant in the redshift interval z ∼1.5–4 (e.g., Songaila 2005). There have been recent
efforts to extend the measurementsof ΩCIV to z < .(Cooksey et al. 2010) and to z > (Simcoe
2006; Ryan-Weber et al. 2006, 2009; D’Odorico et al. 2010; Becker et al. 2009). Observations in
these redshift ranges have been difficult to carry out because C IV transition moves to the UV at
low redshift and to the IR band at high redshift. D’Odorico et al. (2010) find evidence of a rise in

The Intergalactic Medium 12
593
the C IV mass density for z < .. Simcoe (2006) and Ryan-Weber et al. (2006) found evidence
of C IV density at z ∼being consistent with estimations at z ∼2–4.5. More recently, however,
Becker et al. (2009) set upper limits for ΩCIV at z ∼.and Ryan-Weber et al. (2009) observe a
decline in intergalactic C IV approaching z = , which are in fact in good agreement with latest
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, as will be shown below. More recently, observational
studies of O VI absorbers and measurements of the O VI mass density, ΩOVI, have been made
(Carswell et al. 2002; Bergeron et al. 2002; Simcoe et al. 2004; Simcoe 2006; Frank et al. 2012).
Like for Lyα clouds, individual metal absorption lines and their properties may be charac-
terized. >Figure 12-22 shows the column density distributions for C IV and O VI absorbers at
z = .. Overall, the predictions of the standard cold dark matter model are in good agreement
with extant observations for both C IV and O VI lines over the range of column density shown,
N = −cm−, given the uncertainties of the current observational data. Since the regions
probed by C IV lines and O VI lines are often physically different and to some extent reflect
the different stages of the evolution of the feedback shocks, the good agreement between the
simulations and observations suggests that current physical treatment of the feedback process
provides a good approximation to nature, and it is indirect but strong evidence that feedback
from star formation plays the central role in enriching the IGM with its energy and metals.
Metals in the IGM ultimately comes from stars. It is tempting to extract information from
the evolution of metal density in the IGM to infer the star formation history. >Figure 12-23
shows the evolution of the mass density contained in the C IV (left) and O VI (right) absorption
lines, respectively. Considering the observational uncertainties and cosmic variance, it is very
encouraging to see the good agreement between the simulation results and observations over
the entire redshift range z ∼2–6, where comparisons may be made. In agreement with obser-
vations, the mass density contained in the C IV absorption line is, within a factor of 2, constant

from z = to z = (e.g., Songaila 2001, 2005) and subsequently drops by a factor of ∼(, )
by z = (, ) (Becker et al. 2009; Ryan-Weber et al. 2009). Because the total amount of star for-
mation and metals in the IGM is observed to have increased significantly in the redshift range
z = 0–4, it seems that the near constancy of ΩCIV at the redshift range z = 1–4 and ΩOVI at the
redshift range z = 0–2 reflects neither the star formation history nor the amount of metals in
the IGM. This reflects a “selection effect” of said absorption systems of the overall metals in the
IGM, which may be due to a combination of several different processes, including the evolution
of the mean gas density as (+ z), the evolution of the overdensity of the regions that produce
C IV lines, the density dependence of the IGM metallicity and its evolution, the evolution of
the radiation background, and hierarchical build-up hence gravitational shock heating of the
large-scale structure. Both the magnitude and evolution of ΩOVI are somewhat different from
C IV absorbers.
To understand the physical properties of C IV and O VI absorbers, different projections
through the multidimensional parameter space spanned by several fundamental physical vari-
ables are now shown. >Figure 12-24 shows the distribution of gas overdensity for C IV (left)
and O VI absorbers (right) at six different redshifts, z = (, ., ., ., , ). A comparison
of the three histograms for three subsets of C IV and O VI absorbers in each panel indicates
that higher column C IV and O VI absorbers are produced, on average, by higher density
gas. There is a clear trend that C IV absorbers trace increasingly more overdense regions with
decreasing redshift. For example, while the location of the vast majority of C IV absorbers with
log(NC IV cm) = [, ] appears to be outside virialized regions (i.e., overdensity less than
about 100) at z > ., a significant fraction of them reside in virialized regions at z < .;
the same is true for higher column C IV absorbers. A comparison to O VI absorbers reveals a
striking contrast: the vast majority of O VI absorbers with log(NC IV cm) ≤are located out-
side virialized regions at all redshifts. In addition, typical O VI lines arise from somewhat lower

The Intergalactic Medium 12
595
density regions than C IV lines. For example, for O VI absorbers of log(NC IV cm) = [, ],
the typical overdensity peaks at δ ∼for O VI absorbers versus ∼10 for C IV lines at z = 2.6–5,
which jumps to δ ∼for O VI absorbers versus ∼50 for C IV absorbers at z = ..
>Figure 12-25 shows the distribution of gas metallicity for C IV (left) and O VI absorbers
(right) at six different redshifts, z = (, ., ., ., , ). It is seen that C IV absorption lines
arise from gas with a wide range of metallicity from [C/H] = −3 to −0.5, peaked approximately
around −2.5 to −1.5 at z > .. The metallicity distributions for O VI absorbers are generally
cut off at a higher metallicity than those for C IV absorbers at the low end and peak at a higher
metallicity. The situation appears to start reversing at z = .such that at z < .the fraction of
high metallicity C IV absorbers exceeds that of O VI absorbers. What is also interesting is that
the typical metallicity of C IV and O VI lines displays a nonmonotonic trend at a fixed column
density. For O VI absorbers, at z = 4–5 the metallicity of O VI lines with log(NO VI cm) =
[, ] peaks at [Z/ Z⊙] = −.to −., which moves to a lower value of [Z/ Z⊙] = −.to −.
at z = ., then slightly moves back up to [Z/ Z⊙] ∼−.at z = (., ., ). For comparison, the
overall behavior for C IV lines is as follows: the metallicity of C IV lines with log(NO VI cm) =
[, ] peaks at Z = −.to −.at z = , at [Z/ Z⊙] ∼−at z = , followed by a very broad
distribution peaking at Z = −to −at z = .to z = .with a larger fraction reaching a
relatively high metallicity gas with [Z/ Z⊙] > −.
The overall trend in metallicity evolution with redshift for the C IV and O VI absorbers
could be understood as follows. First, note that the ionizing radiation background at z = , is
about (/, /) of that z = ., which in turn is larger than that at z = (., ., ) by a factor of
∼(, , ). At z = 4–5, both C IV and O VI absorbers are predominantly collisionally ionized
with the temperatures peaking at and .K, respectively, as shown below in >Fig. 12-26.
These regions are relatively closer to galaxies, from which metal-carrying shocks originate and
have relatively high metallicities. At lower redshift z = ., larger regions around galaxies have
been enriched with metals and the rise of the ionizing radiation background produces a large
population of photoionized C IV and O VI lines at lower temperature and lower metallicity.
Toward still lower redshift z = ., the decrease of the mean gas density in the universe demands
a rise in overdensity of the O VI -bearing gas in order to produce a comparable column density,
causing a shift of these regions to be closer to galaxies where both metallicity and density are
higher.
The combination of lower density (> Fig. 12-24) and higher metallicity (> Fig. 12-25) for
the typical (low) column density O VI absorbers compared to C IV absorbers is reminiscent of
metal-carrying shocks propagating through inhomogeneous medium, exactly the situation one
would expect of the feedback shocks from galaxies entering the highly inhomogeneous IGM.
Given the widespread steep density gradients (steeper than −2) in regions just outside the virial
radius of galaxies, these shocks could not only heat up lower density regions to higher tempera-
tures but also enrich them to higher metallicity. The feedback shocks generically propagate in a
direction that has the least resistance and is roughly perpendicular to the orientation of a local
filament where a galaxy sits, as seen clearly in >Fig. 12-21. While higher density regions, on
average, tend to have higher metallicity, the dispersion is sufficiently large that the reverse and
other complex situations often occur in some local regions. This appears to be what is happening
here, at least for some regions that manifest in C IV and O VI lines.

contribution to both species and the two types of absorbers arise from different regions. The
rapid drop in the amplitude of the UV radiation background beyond z = and increase in
gas density with (z + )are the primary reasons for diminished component of photoionized
C IV and O VI absorbers at these high redshifts. At redshift z < ., the distributions for the
two absorbers become progressively broader ranging from .to .K for C IV absorbers,
and from .to K for O VI absorbers. Thus, at z < ., both C IV and O VI absorbers
are a mixture of photoionized and collisionally ionized ones. For both C IV and O VI lines,
while the temperature distributions of O VI lines at z < .are broad, there is no signifi-
cant segregation in temperature of lines of different column densities. Recall that there is a
noticeable correlation between column density and overdensity for both O VI lines and C IV
lines. This is indicative of complex, inhomogeneous nature of metal-enrichment process around
galaxies.
4.6 Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium
The Warm-hot intergalactic medium is generally defined to be gas in the temperature range of
–K and is a cosmologically and astrophysically important component of the IGM. Here,
the attention is focused on WHIM at z = 2–3 and z = .
4.6.1 The Missing Metals Problem at z = 2–3
At z ∼2–3, there is a so-called “missing metals problem”: observationally, integrating the
observed star formation rate history from high redshift down to z = .suggests that the
vast majority (possibly ≥%) of cosmic metals at z ∼.appear to be missing (e.g., Pettini
1999). Note that this conclusion is insensitive to the choice of the stellar initial mass function
(IMF), since both UV light and metals are, in the zeroth order, produced by the same mas-
sive stars. Metals that have been accounted for in the estimates include those in stars of Lyman
break galaxies (LBG), damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs), and Lyα forest, i.e., cold-warm
gas and stars. Thus, all the regions where metals have been accounted for trace temperatures
lower than about × K. Since metals are transported to large distances from galaxies by
galactic winds as shown in > Fig. 12-21, one may ask, could a significant fraction of metals
that accompanies the galactic winds energy be heated up and be in a phase like WHIM that
is different from those where metals have been inventoried? This is in fact borne out in simu-
lations.
>Figure 12-27 displays the temperature distributions corresponding to the same two
projections shown in > Fig. 12-21. It is clear that the metal bubbles are generally heated to
temperatures higher than about × K, mostly falling in the temperature range of WHIM.
Put it simply, it is in WHIM where most of the energy and metal exchanges between galaxies
and the IGM take place. It has been proposed earlier that the missing metals may be found in
hot gaseous halos of star-forming galaxies (Pettini 1999; Ferrara et al. 2005). That proposal was
partly correct, except that simulations show that most of the missing metals at z = 2–3 are in a
diffuse IGM of temperature in the range T = .−K that are outside of dark matter halos.
To be more quantitative, the cold-warm IGM component (1) (T < K cold-warm gas)
shown in >Fig. 12-7 is broken up into two sub-components with (1C) (T < × K cold gas)
and (1W) (T = × –K warm gas). The purpose of this finer division is to separate out

the cold gas (1C), which can be more appropriately identified with Lyα forest clouds and DLAs.
The results are shown in > Fig. 12-28. About one-third of all metals produced by z = is
locked up in stars, decreasing monotonically toward high redshift, dropping to about % by
z = . The fraction of metals in the hot X-ray emitting component is at about % level at
z = , plummeting to about % at z = and slowly rising back to about % at z = . The
remaining metals are in the general photoionized Lyα forest and the WHIM. At z = , the
Lyα forest (T < × K, open triangles) contains about % of all metals, while WHIM (T =
–K, open circles) and warm IGM (T = × –K, solid triangles) contain % and
%, respectively. But the fraction of metals in the Lyα forest decreases steadily with time and
becomes a minor component by z = at <%. Most of the metals are seen to be contained in
the WHIM at all times below redshift five at 50–60%, peaking at ∼60% at redshift z ∼. In total,
the amount of metals contained in the IGM with temperature T > × constitutes about 2/3
of all metals produced by z = .. Metals in this temperature range have not been accounted for
in the quoted observational inventory at z = ..
What is the typical density of this WHIM gas where most of the metals are hidden? The
distribution of metal mass as a function of density for each IGM component is shown in
>Fig. 12-29. A very interesting result is that at high redshift (z =, ) the metal mass in the
WHIM tends to peak at a somewhat lower overdensity than that for the overall WHIM mass,
thanks to the upturn of metallicity of the WHIM at low overdensity end. Specifically, at z =−,
it appears that the metal mass peaks at δ ∼, whereas the total WHIM mass peaks at δ ∼.
This trend is reversed at lower redshift; for example, at z = , the metals in WHIM is now
broadly peaked at δ ∼, while the WHIM mass peaks at δ ∼. This reversal is due to accre-
tion of metal-enriched gas onto high-density regions during recent formation of large-scale
structures. Quantitatively, at z = ., only about % of the metals in warm and WHIM gas
is located within virialized regions. About % of the metals in warm and WHIM gas resides

in the IGM with δ = 1–100, with the remaining % in underdense regions. Thus, the solution
to the long-standing problem of missing metals at z = 2–3 has been found: most of the missing
metals are in the warm and WHIM gas with moderate overdensity broadly distributed between
δ ∼1–10.
4.6.2 The Missing Baryons Problem at z = 0
In the remarkably successful standard cosmological model (Krauss and Turner 1995), most
of the mass-energy density in the universe is in dark energy and dark matter with cold dark
matter being the most popular choice for the latter. But the puzzle extends beyond our igno-
rance of the nature of the dynamically measured matter. The remainder, 4–5%, is in the normal
matter – baryons, as detected by the WMAP cosmic microwave background (CMB) obser-
vations (Komatsu et al. 2011) at z ∼1,100 and verified at much lower redshift (z ∼) by the
hydrogen Lyα absorption observations (Weinberg et al. 1997; Rauch et al. 1997):
Ωbaryon(Lyα) ≥.h−= ..
(12.2)
In addition, the observed light-element ratios (in particular, the deuterium to hydrogen ratio)
in some carefully selected absorption line systems at z = 2–3, interpreted within the con-
text of the standard light element nucleosynthesis theory, yield the total baryonic density

⊡Fig. 12-29
Shows the distributions of metal mass for the three IGM components – (1) cold-warm gas at T <
105 K, (2) WHIM at 107 K > T > 105 K, and (3) Hot X-ray emitting gas at T > 107 K – as a func-
tion of overdensity at four diﬀerent redshifts z = 0, 1, 3, 5. Note that the area under each curve
is proportional to the metal mass contained (This ﬁgure is taken from Cen and Chisari (2011))
(Burles and Tytler 1998; Kirkman et al. 2003; Pettini et al. 2008) that is consistent with those
inferred by CMB and Lyα forest observations:
Ωbaryon(D/H) = (.± .) h−= .± ..
(12.3)
The agreement between these three completely independent measurements is remarkable. But,
at redshift zero, after summing over all well-observed contributions, the baryonic density
appears to be far (by a factor greater than 3) below (e.g., Fukugita et al. 1998) this level:
Ωb(z = )∣seen = Ω∗+ ΩHI + ΩH+ ΩXray,cl ≈.≤.(σ limit),
(12.4)
where Ω∗, ΩHI, ΩH, and ΩXray,cl are the baryonic densities contained in stars, neutral atomic
hydrogen, molecular hydrogen, and hot X-ray emitting gas in rich cluster centers, respectively,
in units of the critical density. Thus, unless three independent errors have been made in the
arguments that led tothe three measurements, there is a sharpdecline ofthe amount ofobserved

baryons from high redshift to the present-day; i.e., most of the baryons in the present-day uni-
verse are missing. A significant fraction of missing baryons locally may have been found in the
Lyα forest primarily in warm gas with ΩLyα,z=∼.(e.g., Penton et al. 2004; Danforth and
Shull 2008). But about % of all baryons are still missing. A simple prediction from cosmo-
logical hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Cen and Ostriker 1999, 2006; Davé et al. 2001) is that
nearly one-half of all baryons in the local universe should be in cosmic web of WHIM with
densities of 10–300 times the mean baryon density, as shown in >Fig. 12-30.
The O VI (1,032, 1,034) Å doublet line provides vital information on the WHIM. The reality
of the WHIM, at least the low-temperatureportion of it (T ≤K), has now been convincingly
confirmed by a number of observations from HST and FUSE, through the O VI absorption
line in the FUV portion of QSO spectra (e.g., Tripp et al. 2000; Danforth and Shull 2005). The
overall agreement between theory and observations with respect to O VI absorption line is
excellent, as typified by the column density distribution shown in > Fig. 12-31. The part of
WHIM detected in O VI absorption constitutes about 20% of total WHIM. The Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph (COS) now aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has a sensitivity 10–30
times greater than previous UV spectrographs on HST. COS will provide at least an order of
magnitude increase in the number of detected O VI absorption lines (Shull 2009) to provide
unprecedented statistical power to further scrutinize theory to test both the cosmological model
as well as galaxy formation.

Shows the number of O VI absorption lines per unit redshift as a function of equivalent width in

curve from the simulation without GSW. The black curve is computed using CLOUDY code on the
assumption of ionization equilibrium based on the density, temperature, and metallicity informa-
tion from the simulation with GSW. The symbols are observations by Danforth and Shull (2005)
(This ﬁgure is taken from Cen and Fang (2006))
The search for X-ray absorption of WHIM, in the higher temperature portion (T ≥K),
turns out to be elusive. The O VII absorber at λ = Å is predicted to be the most abundant
and contains a large portion of the WHIM gas (e.g., Hellsten et al. 1998; Cen and Fang 2006),
and it is therefore extremely important to be able to detect O VII WHIM gas to account for the
missing baryons. Early pioneering observations (e.g., Fang et al. 2001) produced no convinc-
ing detections. Mathur et al. (2003) performed a dedicated deep observation of the quasar H
1821+643, which has several confirmed intervening O V I absorbers, but found no significant
X-ray absorption lines at the redshifts of the O V I systems. Nicastro et al. (2005) embarked on
a campaign to observe Mrk 421 during its periodic X-ray outbursts with the Chandra LETGS
and presented evidence for the detection of two intervening absorption systems at z = .and
z = .. But the spectrum of the same source observed with the XMM-Newton RGS does not
show these absorption lines (Rasmussen et al. 2007), despite higher signal-to-noise and com-
parable spectral resolution. Kaastra et al. (2006) have reanalysed the Chandra LETGS data and
are in agreement with Rasmussen et al. (2007). Observations of 1ES 1028+511 at z = .by
Steenbrugge et al. (2006) yield no convincing evidence for WHIM absorption. Theoretical pre-
dictions also suggest that high-temperature portion of the WHIM should be closely associated
with groups and clusters. So far, observations performed to detect the absorption by WHIM
associated with known massive clusters are indeed more successful. An XMM-Newton RGS
spectrum of quasar LBQS 1228+1116 revealed a marginal feature at the Virgo redshifted posi-
tion of O VIII Lyα at the % confidence level (Fujimoto et al. 2004). Using XMM-Newton RGS
observations of an active galactic nuclei behind the Coma Cluster, X Comae, Takei et al. (2007)
claimed to have detected WHIM associated with the Coma cluster. Through the Sculptor Wall,
Buote et al. (2009) have detected WHIM O VII absorption at a column greater than cm−.
To fully settle the issue of the high-temperature end (T ≥K) of WHIM, a high-throughput

and high-sensitivity X-ray mission for absorption study will be needed. Direct imaging of the
emission lines in X-ray, such as the O VII 21 Å line, will be extremely valuable (e.g., Ohashi
et al. 2010).
In summary, the WHIM, as a conduit for exchanges of matter and energy between galaxies
and the general IGM, plays a very important role in galaxy formation. Ongoing observational
and theoretical efforts in this area are expected to significantly advance our understanding of
galaxy formation and its feedback.

Cosmic Microwave Background 13

Abstract:
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the relic of the early phases
of the expanding universe, is bright, full of information, and difficult to measure. Along with
the recession of galaxies and the primordial nucleosynthesis, it is one of the strongest signs that
the Hot Big Bang Model of the universe is correct. It is brightest around 2 mm wavelength, has
a temperature of Tcmb = .± .K, and has a blackbody spectrum within 50 parts
per million. Its spatial fluctuations (around 0.01% on 1○scales) are possibly the relics of quan-
tum mechanical processes in the early universe, modified by processes up to the decoupling
at a redshift of about 1,000 (when the primordial plasma became mostly transparent). In the
cold dark matter (DM) model with cosmic acceleration (ΛCDM), the fluctuation statistics are
consistent with the model of inflation and can be used to determine other parameters within a
few percent, including the Hubble constant, the Λ constant, the densities of baryonic and dark
matter, and the primordial fluctuation amplitude and power spectrum slope. In addition, the
polarization of the fluctuations reveals the epoch of reionization at a redshift approximately
twice that determined from the Gunn-Peterson trough due to optically thick Lyman α absorp-
tion in QSO spectra. It is of historic importance, and a testament to the unity of theory and
experiment, that we now have a standard model of cosmology that is consistent with all of the
observations.
Current observational challenges include (1) improvement of the spectrum distortion mea-
surements, especially at long wavelengths, where the measured background is unexpectedly
bright; (2) the search for the B-mode polarization (the divergence-free part of the polariza-
tion map), arising from propagating gravitational waves; and (3) the extension of fluctuation
measurements to smaller angular scales. Much more precise spectrum observations near 2 mm
are likely and would test some very interesting theories. Current theoretical challenges include
explanation of the dark matter and dark energy; understanding, estimating, and removing the
interference of foreground sources that limit the measurements of the CMB; detailed under-
standing of the influence of nonequilibrium processes on the decoupling and reionization
phases; and searches for signs of the second order or exotic processes (e.g., isocurvature fluctu-
ations, cosmic strings, non-Gaussian fluctuations). At this writing, we await the cosmological
results of the Planck mission.

Introduction
1.1 Outline
In this article we outline the importance and the modern view of the CMB, its prediction and
discovery, and the reason for its blackbody form. After a summary introduction we discuss,
in section 2, the theory and measurement of the CMB spectrum and its distortions. We then
discuss the theory and measurements of the CMB spectrum and its distortions, the standard μ
and y distortions, the details of recombination, the effects of particle decay and annihilation,

alternatives to the Hot Big Bang, tests of cosmic inflation through the Silk damping effects, the
effects of the dark energy, other processes, the reionization history, and far IR sources.
In section 3 we discuss high-precision spectrum measurements,outlining the techniques of
differential comparison with reference blackbodies, as illustrated by the COBE FIRAS instru-
ment, the COBRA rocket-borne instrument, the ARCADE 2 balloon-borne instrument, and
the TRIS ground-based long wavelength measurements.We describe the PIXIE proposed high-
precision spectropolarimeter and briefly discuss the DARE mission to search for the effects of
the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line.
The treatment of anisotropy and polarization measurements is somewhat different because
there is a companion article describing the instrumentation by Hanany et al. (2012). We briefly
review the history of temperature and polarization measurements and discuss the WMAP
results, the standard cosmological model, the origin of structure, the geometry of the universe,
the matter content of the universe, the age of the universe, the initial conditions from infla-
tion, and parameters beyond the standard model. We discuss the anisotropy and polarization
measurement frontiers, the search for non-Gaussianity in the fluctuations, and the search for
large angular scale B-mode polarization, small scale anisotropy and polarization, the effects of
lensing of the CMB, and the effects of neutrinos on the CMB.
1.2 Modern View
The cosmic microwave background radiation is the measurable relic of nature’s greatest par-
ticle accelerator, the hot Big Bang, in which the temperatures and densities were so high that
all particle species, and possibly all their collective oscillation modes, were in local thermal
equilibrium. These particles must include quarks, leptons including the cosmic neutrino back-
ground, the Higgs boson, dark matter, supersymmetric particles if they exist, and the carriers
of the four known forces: weak and strong nuclear forces, electromagnetism, and gravitation. If
the Standard Model of particle physics is correct, then the weak and strong nuclear forces and
electromagnetism are all unified in a single description, and all have comparable strength at
high-enough temperatures and densities. Pushing back even farther, we can imagine an infla-
tionary period in which a false vacuum filled with a scalar or other fields would decay into the
true vacuum we observe today, along with particles and exponential expansion. And perhaps
there was an era of quantum gravity in which gravitation was unified with the other three forces,
and space and time were themselves quantum phenomena. But as the universe cooled, symme-
tries were broken many times as structures developed from the primordial material, antimatter
was annihilated, and energy liberated from those phase transitions has been added to the elec-
tromagnetic fields, now observed at microwave frequencies. As a result, the CMB is now the
dominant electromagnetic radiation field in the universe, and its photons far outnumber the
baryons. The only other free particles with comparable densities are the unobserved cosmic
background neutrinos, and potentially the dark matter particles, whatever they may be.
Of course there are innumerable virtual particles and vacuum fluctuations, whose influ-
ence can be measured in the Casimir effect, but whose meaning is not fully appreciated.
Also, there may be holographic quantum fluctuations of space-time itself, but that is another
topic. And curiously enough, since photons in vacuum are massless, the proper time for their
trajectories from the Big Bang to our receivers is exactly zero. (On the other hand, the idea of
the photon trajectory is itself a bit fuzzy, since electromagnetic fields are not billiard balls, and
there are plasma interactions.)

In the homogeneous and isotropic expanding universe model, the CMB is approximately
isotropic in a “preferred rest frame” at each point in space time. More precisely, the dipole
term, that is, the lowest spherical harmonic of the distribution of the CMB temperature, is zero.
That means that the velocity of the Earth relative to a large sample of the early universe can
be observed and explained, but no more fundamental consequence has been recognized. It is
also interesting that a substantial velocity of the observer relative to the CMB would change the
angular scale of the features, owing to the aberration of light.
1.3 Prediction and Discovery
Prediction. The expanding universe was predicted by Friedman (1922) based on the cosmologi-
cal equations of Einstein (1917), and independently by Lemaître (1927) who also estimated the
Hubble constant from the known observations, and measured by Hubble (1929) using Cepheid
variables as distance indicators. But it might or might not have been hot in the beginning, and
the Steady State Theory of Hoyle (1948) and Bondi and Gold (1948) requiring replenishment
by matter creation might have been correct, so the prediction and discovery of the CMB were
hugely important for cosmology. When the expanding universe was first recognized, the dis-
tance measurements were seriouslyincorrect. Hubble’s Cepheid variables in the MilkyWaywere
a different type from the ones he found in other galaxies, leading to an expansion age that was
significantly less than the ages of stars and even the Solar System, and casting doubt on the
whole concept of the Big Bang. The discovery of the CMB did not quite erase all doubt about
the hot Big Bang, as there was still the possibility that either a cold Big Bang or a steady state
universe would produce starlight that could be absorbed and reemitted by dust grains to fill the
universe with microwave background radiation. Also, even into the 1990s, there were questions
about the expansion age of the universe relative to the oldest stars. This issue was not resolved
until the launch and repair of the Hubble Space Telescope, which enabled more precise mea-
surements of the Hubble constant, detection of the acceleration of the expansion, and better
understanding of stellar ages.
Early Unrecognized CMB Measurements. The first known observation that can now be
interpreted as a measurement of the CMB was reported very briefly by McKellar (1941), and
mentioned by Herzberg (1950), a textbook with a statement that it had only limited signifi-
cance. The observation of the ultraviolet absorption lines of interstellar CN molecules yielded
their rotational excitation temperature, and of course one could imagine many possible ways
that the molecules could be excited. Hence, the observation was not pursued at the time.
Alpher and Herman Prediction of Temperature. Alpher and Herman (1948), working
with G. Gamow, estimated the temperature of the CMB at 5 K; later they estimated 28 K.
They (Alpher, personal communication) tried to convince observers to go look for it, but at
that time no serious effort was made, and in any case it would have been extremely difficult
with the technology available then. J. Weber wanted to try but was told directly that the mea-
surement was impossible (Weber, personal communication). The Alpher and Herman papers
did not emphasize the predicted spectrum of the CMB or compare the spectrum with fore-
ground sources or discuss how it might be detected. Later, radio astronomers and engineers
made a number of measurements of the temperature of the dark sky and gave evidence that it
was not in their instruments, but none of them were recognized as strong enough evidence or
sufficiently surprising to the observers to command attention.

Cosmic Microwave Background
Discovery. The CMB was finally discovered at Bell Telephone Labs by Penzias and Wilson
(1965), who were not looking for it but were astronomers testing a new, sensitive, and stable
microwave receiver and horn antenna, working at 7.35 cm wavelength. As they were rechecking
their measurement, they learned through B. Burke of a group at Princeton who were building
equipment to measure the radiation. The Princeton group had been thinking about the bounc-
ing universe, which would be filled with photons left over from previous expansion/contraction
cycles. The Bell Labs discovery was published simultaneously with the Princeton interpretation
by Dicke et al. (1965) and was front-page news in the NY Times (May 21, 1965). The Prince-
ton group (Roll and Wilkinson 1966) soon completed their measurementat 3.2 cm wavelength,
confirming or at least making it plausible that the CMB has the blackbody spectrum required
by the hot Big Bang idea.
For a remarkable historical summary of the discovery of the CMB and its properties, the
book “Finding the Big Bang” by Peebles et al. (2009) gives the human side of this field as well
as an excellent tutorial on the technical aspects.
1.4 Blackbody Form and Dominance
Prediction of Blackbody Form. The idea that the CMB is the remnant of a hot equilibrium phase
implies that the spectrum must be very close to a blackbody spectrum, although when exam-
ined very closely there must be tiny differences due to the cooling of matter below the CMB
temperature (Chluba and Sunyaev 2012a). The blackbody form is preserved exactly through
the history of the expanding universe, according to the following simple argument: Imagine
a box containing primordial CMB, and imagine that the box expands with the homogeneous
and isotropic expanding universe. Then photons crossing the walls of the box are in detailed
balance, so we may now replace the imaginary box with a real box of moving mirrors that move
with the expanding universe. Within this mirror box, we may represent the electromagnetic
field as quanta occupying the spatial and polarization modes of the box. As the box expands,
these modes expand adiabatically, and the occupation numbers do not change. The energy of
each quantum diminishes as the box expands as well. In combination, these factors imply that
the Planck function description of the blackbody is preserved, and the occupation number of
each mode is just /(ex −), where x = hν/kT. Also, the temperature of the CMB is inversely
proportional to the expansion factor of the universe; conversely, Tcmb = T(+z), where Tcmb is
the temperature of the CMB at a time in the past, Tis its temperature now, and z is the redshift
corresponding to the time in the past. This dependence has been confirmed by observations of
the excitation temperature of cyanogen (CN) and other molecules and ions seen in absorption
against quasars, and through observations of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect in distant clusters of
galaxies.
Dominance and Perfect Spectrum. On a cosmic scale the CMB is extraordinarily bright,
even though it has been difficult to measure. Its brightness (σT, with T = .K) is
3.129 μW/m. The prediction of the blackbody form is very robust because the photons out-
number the baryons by nine orders of magnitude, and it is very difficult to conceive of any way
in which they could have modified the CMB spectrum very much. This difficulty is a matter
of perspective and scale – there are many kinds of proposed exotic processes such as explosive
events that could have modified the spectrum, as well as four processes that are expected to
occur: (i) acoustic damping, (ii) cooling of photons by adiabatically cooling matter, (iii) recom-
bination radiation, and (iv) depending on the mass of the Dark Matter (DM) particle, also DM

annihilation. All of these processes are explained in Chluba and Sunyaev (2012a). The current
success of the ΛCDM model has shifted focus from the more radical of these ideas.
Spectrum Turnover. Early measurements of the CMB were made at long wavelengths (more
than a few mm) where the Planck function is close to a power law, that might also occur from
a nonthermal process, so it was important to observe at shorter wavelengths. Many additional
measurements of the CMB spectrum were made from the ground, balloons, rockets, and inter-
stellar molecules, eventually confirming the blackbody turnover at short wavelengths. Until the
flight of the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite in 1989, reported by Mather et al.
(1990), there was evidence that the spectrum was not exactly blackbody, as reported, for exam-
ple, by Matsumoto et al. (1988), suggesting excess brightness at short wavelengths, but only
with limited accuracy. The COBE results were quickly confirmed by the COBRA experiment
of Gush et al. (1990). Reasons for the difficulties include: the CMB is faint relative to our 300 K
local environment, it is nearly isotropic so that measurements must be absolutely calibrated,
receiver sensitivity was barely adequate, atmospheric emission is strong, galactic emission from
electrons (free-free scattering and synchrotron) is bright at long wavelengths, galactic dust is
bright at short wavelengths, and instruments operated in air cannot be cooled to temperatures
comparable to the CMB so that instrument self-emission is strong and absolute calibration is
difficult. >Figure 13-1 shows the original COBE-FIRAS spectrum that showed that the COBE
was working well. It is now the iconic figure even though the error bars have been reduced to
50 parts per million by Fixsen et al. (1996); see below for details.
Where Does the Energy Go? The energy density of the CMB and other constituents of the
universe decline with the expansion, so where does that energy go? There are a few surprises.
First, energy alone is not a conserved quantity in relativity. In special relativity, it is one com-
ponent of a four-vector, and mass and energy can be interconverted according to E = mc.

In general relativity it is only one component of a stress-energy tensor, and in both cases its
numerical value changes according to the velocity of the coordinate system in which it is mea-
sured. But there are still local conservation laws. Second, the “universe” is not a closed, finite
system. In the expanding mirror box described above, the photons inside the box do work on
the walls of the box, but when we remove the mirrors and replace the photons with others com-
ing from the other side, there is nothing receiving the work that is being done on the imaginary
walls. We conclude that we should trust the differential equations of general relativity but not
the simplifications from analogies. There was a reason that cosmology could not be completed
with Newtonian mechanics and nineteenth-century thermodynamics.
1.5 Celestial Emission at CMB Frequencies
> Figure 13-2 shows the antenna temperature of the sky from 1 to 1,000 GHz for a region
at a galactic latitude of roughly 20○, though the levels one measures can be different by an
order of magnitude depending on galactic longitude. The antenna temperature of a gray body
is Tant = єTx/(ex −), where T is the physical temperature, є is the emissivity, and x = hν/kT.
Ignoring emission from the atmosphere, synchrotron emission dominates celestial emission
at the low-frequency end, and dust emission dominates at high frequencies. The basic picture
in > Fig. 13-2 has remained the same for over 30 years (Weiss 1980), though over the past
decade, there has been increasing evidence for a new component of celestial emission in the
30 GHz region (e.g., Kogut et al. 1996; de Oliveira-Costa et al. 1997; Leitch et al. 1997). This
new component is spatially correlated with dust emission. It has been identified with emis-
sion by tiny grains of dust that are spun up to GHz rotation rates by a variety of mechanisms,
so-called “spinning dust,” though other emission mechanisms may contribute to or produce the
signal (Draine and Lazarian 1998, 1999). Understanding this emission source is an active area of
investigation.
1.6 Energy Release, Anisotropy, Standard Model, and Polarization
Limits on Early Energy Release. If the CMB spectrum does not match a blackbody form, then
significant energy release must have occurred to change it. When the universe was about 1 year
old (redshift about × ), the double-photon Compton scattering processes that create and
destroy photons effectively ceased, but multiple Compton scatterings that equilibrate energy
between wavelengths were still operating. Hence, if energy were added or removed from the
CMB, for instance by the decay of some dark matter particle, then the CMB could have a spec-
trum with a dimensionless chemical potential μ, and the photon occupation number would
equilibrate to the form /(ex+μ −). (This form is only valid at high frequencies; at low frequen-
cies, μ has to be a function of frequency.) When the universe cooled sufficiently to stop even
this equilibration process, it became possible that we would observe a mix of blackbodies at
different temperatures, either from a simple mixing or from energy added by Compton scatter-
ing from hot electrons. This is described by the Kompaneets parameter y, and the first serious
limits were set by the COBE FIRAS instrument. Less than 0.01% of the CMB energy was added
after the first year.
Events at and After Decoupling. About 400,000 years later, the universe became fairly
quickly (over a period of about 100,000 years) transparent when temperatures reached around

The antenna temperature from 1 to 1,000GHz for a region of sky near a galactic latitude of roughly
20○. The ﬂat part of the CMB spectrum, roughly below 30 GHz, is called the Rayleigh-Jeans portion.
A Rayleigh-Jeans source with frequency-independent emissivity is a horizontal line on this plot.
The synchrotron emission is from cosmic ray electrons orbiting in galactic magnetic ﬁelds and is
polarized. Free-free emission is from galactic electrons’ “braking radiation” (bremsstrahlung) and
is not polarized. The amplitude of the spinning dust is not well known. This particular model comes
from Ali-Haïmoud et al. (2009). The standard spinning dust emission is not appreciably polarized.
The atmospheric models are based on the ATM code (Pardo et al. 2001) and are for a zenith angle
of 45○. The South Pole/Atacama (Chile) spectrum is based on a precipitable water vapor of 0.5 mm.
The diﬀerence between the two sites is inconsequential for this plot. The atmospheric spectra
have been averaged over a 10% bandwidth. The pair of lines at 60 and 120 GHz are the oxygen
doublet. The lines at 19 and 180 GHz are vibrational water lines. The ﬁner scale features are from
ozone
3,000 K and electrons were bound to atomic nuclei. This moment is known as the decoupling.
We observe the map of the CMB predominantly as it was when it was last scattered in our direc-
tion. Little effect on the spectrum can be produced by the details of the reactions because as
noted above, the photons outnumber the baryons by an enormous factor. But after decoupling,
Compton drag on the residual ionization of the baryonic material still limits its ability to move,
and, in addition, the baryons can cool adiabatically to have a temperature less than that of the
CMB. These effects have tremendous importance to the formation of stars and galaxies, even if
we cannot see much effect on the CMB. (Note that although it is often said that we observe the
universe at the decoupling, the CMB spectrum is determined by and responds to events back
to year one.)

Cosmic Microwave Background
Isotropy. The first test for the cosmic nature of the CMB was that it is isotropic (the same
brightness in all directions). If its brightness showed any correlation with known objects such as
the weather or the ecliptic plane or the galactic plane or nearby galaxies or clusters, then it would
not be cosmic. As it happens, the foregrounds are bright enough to matter, but can be measured
at other wavelengths and modeled and extrapolated to find a residual background. For many
years, the only results on anisotropy were upper limits, but eventually the Doppler shift due to
the Earth’s motion relative to the cosmos was measured as a significant dipole. The Doppler-
shifted blackbody is still a blackbody but at a modified temperature. We now know the velocity
of the Solar System relative to the cosmos as v = .± .km s−from COBE and WMAP
(Hinshaw et al. 2009). The velocity produces a CMB temperature distribution that is to first
order T = T(+ (v/c) cos θ) where, v is the velocity of motion, and θ is the angle between
the observed direction and the direction of motion. The measured velocity is the vector sum of
the instrument’s velocity around the Earth and the Sun, the Sun’s velocity around the center of
the Milky Way galaxy, and the Milky Way’s velocity relative to the rest of the universe, or more
precisely the slice of space-time when the universe became transparent to the photons now
reaching our detectors. The masses of nearby galaxies, acting through gravitational attraction
over cosmic time, are thought to be enough to explain the motion of the Milky Way and hence
the vector sum.
Higher Order Anisotropy. As it happens, the decoupling was soon after a time when baryonic
matter was beginning to move under the influence of gravitational forces, now that it was no
longer so strongly tied by Compton scattering to the CMB radiation field, and the attenuation of
the radiation temperaturediminished the gravitational importance and the pressure of the radi-
ation field itself. (Dark matter was free to move much sooner.) On angular scales greater than
7○, the major feature is the Sachs–Wolfe effect (Sachs and Wolfe 1967), in which some regions
of the universe are more dense than others, and photons leaving the dense regions suffer more
gravitational redshift than others. It was predicted by Harrison (1970), Peebles and Yu (1970),
and Zel’dovich (1972) on very general grounds that the primordial fluctuations should have a
scale-free power spectrum, with equal fluctuation amplitudes on all spatial scales. This predic-
tion has been confirmed to excellent precision and extended by the WMAP team and by other
anisotropy measurements at small angular scales. In addition, some forms of inflation theory
say that the spectral index should not be exactly unity as predicted by Harrison, Peebles and Yu,
and Zel’dovich, but a few percent smaller; this has also been has been measured as discussed
below.
For smaller angular scales, a detailed analysis of coupled fluids acting before and after the
decoupling is necessary. The fluids include the CMB, the cosmic neutrino background, the bary-
onic matter, the dark matter (cold and/or warm), and the dark energy (affecting the recent
expansion history). In a remarkable accomplishment, cosmologists agree very well on the equa-
tions to be solved and the methods to be used; this is possible because all the motions are small
and the complexity of the modern universe has not yet developed. There is now a “standard
model” of cosmology based on cold dark matter with an Einstein Λ constant that matches all
of the observations of anisotropy on all measured scales from the quadrupole term (90○angu-
lar scale) up to multipole orders of thousands (arcminute scales). This is true despite the tiny
amplitude of the fluctuations: a part in on 7○scales, a part in on 1○scales.
The remarkable feature found by observations and matched by theory is that there is a pre-
ferred angular scale for the fluctuations, called the “acoustic peak,” at about 1○scale (spherical
harmonic order about 200). This is effectively the observed size of the event horizon (and the
age of the universe then) at the time of decoupling, and as matter feels the gravitational fields

Cosmic Microwave Background 13
619
of primordial perturbations, it begins to move at the decoupling time. More precisely, the event
horizon (at the speed of light) is about 1.2○, and the acoustic horizon is about 0.6○, smaller
because the speed of sound then is about half the speed of light. This acoustic horizon size
at decoupling provides a physical scale that is imprinted on the matter distribution and pre-
served as the universe expands. It can be detected in the galaxy-galaxy correlation function
and is the basis for the baryon acoustic oscillation method of measuring the cosmic acceler-
ation, since the apparent size of a physical marker can be measured as a function of redshift.
At smaller angular scales, there are approximate harmonics of the fundamental oscillation fre-
quency, and the small-scale oscillations lose amplitude because of photon diffusion, an effect
called Silk damping.
Propagation. Note that the intergalactic medium is not perfectly transparent; after decou-
pling, there is still residual ionization, and then after the first bright UV sources arise, the
universe becomes reionized. The optical depth of the intergalactic medium after decoupling
has been measured by the correlation of anisotropies and polarization on relatively large angu-
lar scales using the WMAP data. According to the WMAP7 data set (Jarosik et al. 2011), the
optical depth from here tothe decoupling is about τ = .±., and the reionization redshift
was z = .± ., assuming the reionization happened quickly.
Lensing. A somewhat surprising result of general relativity is that the distant universe is
not where it seems to be, but may be arcminutes away, due to the effect of gravitational lens-
ing of intervening clusters and superclusters of galaxies. The Millennium Simulation yielded a
mean deflection angle of 2.4′ (Carbone et al. 2009). The lensing preserves surface brightness,
so might naïvely be expected to have no effect on the CMB and its anisotropy, but this is untrue
because the lensing changes the observed angular scales of the fluctuations, magnifying some
and shrinking others. Hence, the lensing can be detected statistically against the random fluctu-
ation field of the CMB and used to measure parameters of the mass distribution of the universe.
Lensing would not directly affect the polarization of a CMB photon much (because the deflec-
tion angles are small), but it does affect the spatial map of the polarization field and sets a limit
on the measurement of primordial gravitational waves (see below).
Standard Model. The results of these observations, interpreted through the standard model,
have produced a total transformation of the subject of cosmology, from highly speculative to
highly quantitative. The parameters of the standard model can be measured with accuracies of
the order of a few percent or better and are in agreement with measurements of the acceler-
ating universe obtained in other ways (supernova distance scale, baryon acoustic oscillations,
and clustering). On the other hand, some writers believe that warm dark matter may also be
required, rather than or in addition to cold. Although the CMB observations are matched essen-
tially perfectly by ΛCDM, the populations and spatial distributions of dwarf galaxies may not
match the models so well. This is not simple to model or to observe, as all the complexities of
star formation, stellarwinds, galactic growth and evolution, black holes, and AGN can influence
the comparison of observations with numerical simulations.
Polarization. The new and exciting challenge for CMB observers is to measure the polariza-
tion of the CMB. Some large-scale polarizations and correlations with the intensity anisotropy
have already been observed by the WMAP team and interpreted to measure the ionization his-
tory after the decoupling and the onset of reionization, extending the direct measurements of
quasar absorption lines. But the current challenge is to measure the effects of primordial grav-
itational waves. If such waves were in equipartition equilibrium with other fluctuation events
in the early universe, then there should be a statistical signature left. In analogy with electro-
magnetic fields, the observed polarization vectors of the CMB can be broken down into a curl

620 13
Cosmic Microwave Background
part with no divergence (B mode) and a divergence part with no curl (E mode). Primordial
gravitational waves, unlike other cosmological perturbations, produce equal amounts of E and
B modes. The mode of action is that the gravitational waves, still propagating at the epoch of
decoupling, would be stretching and squeezing the primordial fluid so that there is a quadrupole
intensity anisotropy at the time of the decoupling. This quadrupole anisotropy, incident on the
electrons at last scattering, will result in polarization vector, proportional to two of the five com-
ponents of the quadrupole term then. We then observe the polarization as a map of the spatial
variation of that quadrupole. The predicted signal is very small. Nevertheless,calculation shows
that the signal can be measurable, and hundreds of people are working on roughly ten different
projects to do it. We cover this topic in more detail below.

CMB Spectrum Theory and Measurements
2.1 Major Questions and Spectrum Distortions
In this section we describe three predicted forms of distortion of the CMB spectrum and several
effects that could alter the spectrum from the initially perfect pressure-cooker blackbody form.
Did the universe really start with a hot Big Bang? Is there any effect of cosmic inflation on the
spectrum of the CMB? Did some kind of matter decay or other energy source add energy to
the CMB, in such a way that the effect could be seen today? Were there exotic processes like
cosmic strings, explosive events, or abundant black holes in the early universe that could mod-
ify the CMB spectrum? When all the details about reactions and radiation transfer around the
recombination are included, what difference do they make to the general history? Are there
observable consequences of the atomic recombination sequences (H, He, He+, Li) or molecules
(LiH, H)? How does the CMB interact with the hyperfine structure of hydrogen, and what
could redshifted 21 cm hydrogen emission and absorption tell us? What might make the unre-
solved excess background radiation seen at cm wavelengths? What is the history of structure
formation? The history of reionization? What are the foreground sources, and how can we see
past them?
2.2 Bose-Einstein μ Distortion
Wright et al. (1994) and Kogut et al. (2011) summarize the leading models for observable spec-
tral distortions in the context of the FIRAS observations and the proposed PIXIE mission.
Energy release within the first year of the expansion would simply be thermalized, without a
change from the blackbody form, due to rapid Compton scattering and the double Compton
process in which e + γ ←→e + γ.
But when the temperaturedrops sufficiently, this process becomes slow compared to the age
of the universe. For redshifts from zy = .×to zth = ×, energy added to the CMB field
will not be fully thermalized, because the photons are no longer freely created or destroyed,
resulting in a Bose-Einstein distribution with a dimensionless chemical potential μ. Electrons
still produce Doppler shifts when scattering the photons, and multiple scatterings are enough
to produce a pseudoequilibrium form for the photon occupation number: η = /(ex+μ −).
Detailed calculations are reported by Burigana et al. (1991), Daly (1991), and Hu et al. (1994).

Cosmic Microwave Background 13
621
In this case the chemical potential μ = .ΔU/U, where ΔU is the energy added to the CMB
and U is its total energy (Sunyaev and Zel’dovich 1970b; Illarionov and Sunyaev 1975a, b).
Forwide ranges of ν, it is convenient to let μ be a function of ν, μ(ν). Note also that a negative
μ could be produced if the electron cloud is colder than the CMB, which can happen as matter
cools adiabatically below the CMB temperature. Negative μ would produce a singularity in the
brightness temperature of the CMB at zero frequency, but this does not happen because the
free-free opacity is large at low frequencies. Chluba and Sunyaev (2012b) show that negative μ
would only be produced at redshift z > ,. Khatri et al. (2011) discussed this in depth and
described it as a Bose-Einstein condensation.
2.3 Compton y Distortion
At lower redshifts than zth = .× , multiple Compton scattering is too slow to produce an
equilibrium spectrum. In that case, energy added to the CMB could retain some of its original
spectrum. In particular, hot objects would produce additions to the short-wavelength end of
the CMB spectrum, even though scattering would prevent observing them. In the absence of
discrete hot objects or high energy photons, we consider the effects of scattering from warm
electrons, heated above the CMB temperature by some energy source. Doppler shifts from
Compton scattering by nonrelativistic electrons effectively produce a CMB spectrum that is
a mixture of blackbodies at different temperatures. The resulting spectrum is parameterized by
the Kompaneets y, where y = ΔU/U, and ΔU and U are the total energy release and the total
energy, as before,
y = ∫
k(Te −Tcmb)
mec
dτ,
(13.1)
where Te is the electron temperature, Tcmb is the CMB temperature at the time, and τ is the
optical depth to electron scattering. A modification is required if the electrons are relativistic
(Wright 1979) because individual scatterings can shift photons far into the short wavelength
Wien tail of the spectrum.
2.4 Recombination Details
An obvious question is whether the details of the recombination process at the time of decou-
pling can produce a measurable effect on the anisotropy or spectrum of the CMB. The short
answer is no because there are photons per baryon. However, the scattering optical depth
of the hydrogen and helium transitions to and from the ground state is also extremely large,
so there is a calculable delay in recombination, a slightly nonequilibrium distribution of pop-
ulations of the levels, and a small trace of the hydrogen lines in the CMB spectrum. Peebles
(1968a) discussed the Lyman α line emission, and as did Zel’dovich et al. (1969), Varshalovich
and Khersonskii (1977), and Dubrovich and Stolyarov (1995). Dubrovich (1975) was the first
to mention recombination lines at high n. An H atom in the n = state faces a bottleneck
in reaching the ground level: either it decays by a two-photon path or it emits a Lyman α
photon that must escape an optically thick cloud. This trapping means that each atom can pro-
duce many residual photons resulting from transitions among the excited states, leading to an
amplification of the spectrum distortions, but they are still too small to observe directly now.

622 13
Cosmic Microwave Background
On the otherhand, at 2GHz, the fractional distortion maybe as large as ×−, and on the Wien
end of the spectrum, the fractional distortion is large and affects the chemistry calculations at
low redshfits (e.g., Switzer and Hirata 2005; Coppola et al. 2012a).
Detailed computer simulations have now been done, keeping track of the reaction rates
and the populations of individual atomic, ionic, and molecular states of H, He, and Li. Key
recent papers include Seager et al. (1999, 2011), Chluba and Sunyaev (2006), Rubiño-Martín
et al. (2008), Sunyaev and Chluba (2009), and Chluba and Sunyaev (2012b). Switzer and Hirata
(2008) discussed primordial helium recombination, Ali-Haïmoud and Hirata (2011) described
the HyRec code for hydrogen and helium recombination, and Alizadeh and Hirata (2011) dis-
cuss the effects of possible molecular Hat the recombination era (z = −,). Coppola
et al. (2012b) review prior work back to 1983 and discuss a detailed analysis of the reaction
rates and effects of the formation of molecular hydrogen H. Peak production rates would occur
around redshift z = , and the rotational-vibrational transitions would emit radiation peaking
around 2 μm wavelength.
The predicted spectral distortion from all of these factors is very small but not necessarily
unobservable, now that technology and concepts have improved. The Lyman series of spectral
lines are the strongest but are broad, and the contrast against the continuum is of order −.
The Lyman α line is redshifted to around 130 μm, where Galactic and zodiacal dust emission
are bright, and atomic and molecular transitions in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way
and external galaxies would confuse the search for the recombination line.
The electron gas cools adiabatically far below the CMB temperature when it is no longer
strongly coupled (thermally and kinematically) to the CMB, but this event occurs around a
redshift z = , and of course the optical depth is then also small. Galli et al. (2008) report
that the “delayed recombination” has important effects in determining cosmological parame-
ters from the WMAP data, but would be less important when smaller angular scale data are
included. Peebles et al. (2000) demonstrated the effect for the first time and gave it the name.
2.5 Free-Free Distortion
At long wavelengths the free-free opacity after decoupling is significant and can either cool or
heat the CMB depending on whether the electrons have been cooled or heated. Chluba and
Sunyaev (2012b) included this effect in their numerical simulations. For the case of cooled
electrons, they find spectral distortions similar to a negative y at high frequencies, created
at late times, and a negative μ at low frequencies (1 GHz), created well before recombination
(z > ,).
2.6 Particle Decay and Annihilating Particles
As noted by Wright et al. (1994), rare photons with hν ≫mec/τH would lose most of their
energybymultiple Compton scattering and delivertheirenergytothe electron gas, which would
then modify the spectrum of the CMB photons. In this formula, τH is the optical depth for
electron scattering per Hubble time. Such photons must be rare; otherwise, we would have seen
a large distortion ofthe CMBspectrum. The photons could come from the decayofrare particles
or from the decay of common particles with small branching ratios. For instance, Fukugita and
Kawasaki (1990) considered the decay of massive (20 keV) neutrinos at z ≈,, which would
produce a y distortion.

Some theories have posited that ordinary matter or dark matter may be slightly unstable.
In the standard model of particle physics, baryon number is conserved, and the proton is the
lightest baryon, so it must be stable. Observational limits on its lifetime are greater than about
years. On the other hand, baryogenesis and the asymmetry between matter and antimatter
are not understood, and some theories predict that protons are unstable. Also, since we do
not know what particles comprise dark matter, perhaps it is the decay product of some other
particles that might have had interesting lifetimes. A lifetime of one year corresponds to the
time at which the CMB spectrum could begin to deviate from a blackbody form.
The dark matter might be neutralinos (supersymmetric partners of photons), which arise
naturally in supersymmetry theories; there may be four neutralinos, of which only the lightest
would be stable. The primordial supersymmetric particles, most of which are charged, could
not be stable or we would still see them. Instead, annihilation of these charginos by their
antiparticles would produce electromagnetic energy and neutralinos as dark matter. If dark
matter particles are massive, then they would have cooled to low temperatures during the adi-
abatic expansion of the universe. If all the dark matter particles were produced in the first year
of expansion, we would not see an effect on the CMB. But if they were produced later, and
the energy could be coupled to the electromagnetic fields, then the CMB spectrum would be
distorted.
Silk and Stebbins (1983), prior to the COBE launch, and later McDonald et al. (2001)
reviewed some of the possibilities. According to de Vega and Sanchez (2010), CMB spec-
trum distortions would be most sensitive to neutralinos at a mass scale below 80 keV. Feng
et al. (2003) computed the possible spectrum distortions as a function of particle lifetimes and
electromagnetic energy release for two different particle models. They considered gravitinos
(the supersymmetric partners of gravitons) as the dark matter and produced graphs illustrating
the range of parameter space tested by CMB spectrum distortions. They show a range of the
possible WIMP lifetime from to s and a range of their energy release parameter ζEM
from −to −.
Particles could also be annihilated by meeting their antiparticles, producing similar effects
on the CMB spectrum. The CMB constraints on this process are already strong (Galli et al.
2008), as are those from the Fermi observatory, so predicted μ values are only a few times −.
2.7 Alternatives to the Hot Big Bang
Cold Big Bang. The current inflationary picture of the early universe provides a cold starting
point, with a single scalar field rolling down into a potential well, and then radiating photons
and other particles at extreme temperatures. But a more literal meaning, prior to the concept
of inflation, held that the expanding universe was cold even after the particles were produced.
If such a cold universe were unstable, then it could break up into clusters, galaxies, and stars,
which would then liberate photons and dust, and then the dust would convert visible light into
CMB. Lemaître (1931), immediately following the translation of his 1927 article, considered
the instability of the early universe, as did Eddington and others. In those times there was also
a theory that the cosmic rays are relics of the great explosion. Zel’dovich (1963) suggested that
a zero-temperature early universe would undergo a phase transition and would then break up
into condensations of planetary mass.
Layzer and Hively (1973) argued that the CMB could be produced in a cold Big Bang Model,
if most of the matter in the universe were included in a population of stars at redshift 25–50.

624 13
Cosmic Microwave Background
The dust grains produced in these stars would thermalize the energyreleased bynuclearburning
and supernova explosions. Aguirre (1999) reviewed the possibility of nucleosynthesis in such
a cold Big Bang. He argues that the element abundances can be explained by a cold Big Bang
and leaves open the question of whether the CMB could be astrophysically generated. His later
paper Aguirre (2000) discusses the CMB and concludes that even with generous assumptions,
the cold Big Bang idea is probably not correct.
Steady State Theory. The Steady State Theory held that the CMB (which had not been pre-
dicted by the theory) would be the accumulated, redshifted, thermalized radiation of all the
stars. To achieve a steady state, it was necessary to posit an unobserved process of matter cre-
ation, to keep the mean density of the universe constant through time. The theory did not
predict that the CMB should have a blackbody spectrum, and it also held that the tempera-
ture of the CMB should be independent of redshift, in conflict with observations of CN, CH,
and [C II] lines in distant objects. Attempts to rescue the Steady State Theory in light of new data
were increasingly ad hoc and required selective belief in certain observations and not others.
In both the Cold Big Bang and the Steady State theories, the optical depth and special optical
properties of dust that would be needed to thermalize the CMB to the precise blackbody form
would be quite unusual. Wright (1982) computed the properties of iron whiskers and outlined
the tests to be made when a more precise spectrum of the CMB could be determined. But now
that the CMB is known to have a precise blackbody form, the Cold Big Bang and the Steady
State theories no longer match the data.
Of course, the radiation field produced by all the generations of stars, black holes, etc.,
and partially thermalized by dust does exist. It was measured at both near- and far-infrared
wavelengths by the DIRBE team and is comparable in luminosity to all the visible classes of
stars and galaxies. But it does not have a blackbody spectrum with emissivity near unity, as the
CMB does.
2.8 Tests of Cosmic Inﬂation: Silk Damping
Do the primordial density fluctuations follow the power-law spectrum that has been tested so
far by anisotropy measurements,and is its index different from the scale-invariant value? Below
we discuss this in the context of direct measurements of the anisotropy. However, it is also pos-
sible to test this on small scales by searching for energy release at redshifts greater than ,
which would result in a distorted CMB spectrum. Primordial density fluctuations are frozen in
place as the early universe inflates, and then come back into the horizon as expansion slows.
As the smaller scale fluctuations come into view, the photons associated with them diffuse,
the anisotropy is erased, and their energy can be converted to heat (Silk damping, Silk 1968;
Sunyaev and Zel’dovich 1970b; Daly 1991; Hu et al. 1994). This effect is already taken into
account in the prediction of anisotropies, but the effect on the spectrum would be too small
to have been detected so far. The effect becomes a test of inflation because it is sensitive to
primordial fluctuations on scales much smaller than those observable as CMB anisotropies. If
those fluctuations were significantly stronger than the approximately scale-invariant prediction
of inflation, then we would know from this measurement. Both y and μ distortions could be
produced, depending on the physical scale at which the fluctuations deviate from the inflation
prediction.
The limit set by the FIRAS instrument (below, Wright et al. (1994)) gives ∣μ∣< .× −
(95% confidence). With this limit, the power law spectrum index of the fluctuations is less than

Cosmic Microwave Background 13
625
+ /≈.. This result limits the fluctuations on scales much smaller than are accessible from
the anisotropy measurements. PIXIE (see below) could do more than 4 orders of magnitude
better, down to μ of −.
For later energy release, the first-order effect of Silk damping on the spectrum is again to
mix together blackbodies at a range of temperatures, and y = var(T)/T, where var() is the
variance. Note that because this is quadratic, the y resulting from the measured anisotropy of
−is only × −and not yet measurable. On the other hand, future precise measurements
will have to account for this effect. For earlier energy release between zy and zth, the spectrum
equilibrates to the Bose-Einstein form with μ = .var(T)/T, also not yet detectable.
Chluba et al. (2012b) compute the effects of Silk damping of primordial acoustic waves,
carrying the computations to second order in the perturbation amplitude and in the energy
transfer. The acoustic energy can raise the temperature of the CMB (which we cannot distin-
guish from other effects) or it can cause both y and μ distortions. The μ distortion is particularly
interesting because it occurs early. Future measurements of μ can set limits on the primordial
fluctuations at scale sizes k from 50 to 10Mpc−, even though these fluctuations are completely
erased from the anisotropy and baryon distributions. Chluba et al. (2012a) show explicitly how
powerful measurements of the CMB spectrum could be and that the COBE-FIRAS limit is
already stronger than the primordial black hole limits.
2.9 Dark Energy
The cosmic acceleration has no predicted direct effect on the CMB except through modify-
ing the expansion itself, and the CMB blackbody form is preserved. On the other hand, the
details of the expansion history are critically important to the calculation of the anisotropy and
its relation to present-day large-scale structure. The basic Sachs–Wolfe effect produces the pri-
mary anisotropies observed on large angular scales; dense regions cause gravitational redshifts
of photons leaving them at decoupling. The integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect refers to the effect of
the changing depth of the gravitational potential wells as the universe expands and dilutes the
material and depends on whether the source of the gravitational potential includes radiation as
well as matter.
2.10 Other Processes
Wright et al. (1994) summarize other exotic processes that might have occurred. Ostriker and
Cowie (1981) considered an explosive scenario for galaxy formation; this is now ruled out as a
general explanation. Gnedin and Ostriker (1992) considered massive black hole accretion and
photodisintegration of He, but this is also ruled out. Cosmic strings have been ruled out as
a primary source of the general anisotropy, and consequently, it is unlikely that there could be a
direct effect on the CMBspectrum through energyrelease from the strings. On the otherhand, a
search for the spatial signature (anisotropy) of cosmic strings continues to be an active research
area as better maps are obtained. Energy release by superconducting strings was considered by
Ostriker and Thompson (1987) and Tashiro et al. (2012), and magnetic fields were discussed by
Jedamzik et al. (2000).

Cosmic Microwave Background
2.11 Reionization History and the X-ray Background
The reionization of the intergalactic medium, presumably by UV from discrete sources such as
the first stars and AGN, was accompanied by energy delivered to the CMB through the Comp-
ton scattering ofthe newlyfreed electrons. The reionization energyofabout 10 eVperelectron is
small compared with the CMB energy of (+z) MeV per electron, for ΩBh= .(Wright
et al. 1994). The electrons left afterdecoupling, or produced by reionization, will be cooled fairly
quickly by Compton processes until z = . If they are produced later, they might be relativistic
and the CMB distortion need not follow a simple y form.
The hot electrons producing the X-ray background can be isotropically but not uniformly
distributed; otherwise, they would produce a measurable distortion of the CMB spectrum. The
FIRAS limit was that a hot IGM produces less than −of the X-raybackground and conversely
that the X-ray background comes from material with a filling factor less than −.
The Sunyaev–Zel’dovitch (Sunyaev and Zel’dovich 1970a) effect is the result of Compton
scattering by hot gas in clusters of galaxies and has now been observed directly as hot spots in
the sky maps (at short wavelengths) and cold spots at long wavelengths. With enough precision,
it should be possible to observe the cumulative effect of these clusters on the mean sky spectrum
and to determine whether the cluster population explains the whole distortion seen.
2.12 Far-IR Background Sources
It is expected that AGN and star-forming galaxies would have produced significant far-infrared
fluxes from dust emission and that if this occurred at a high enough redshift, it might add to the
CMB spectrum in a way that would be hard to recognize. In total the far-IR background mea-
sured by the COBE DIRBE and FIRAS instruments is comparable in brightness to all the known
categories of visible and near-IR sources so that of order 1/3 of the total (post-recombination)
luminosity of the universe is in the far-IR. The measured far IR background has been partially
resolved into discrete sources, particularly ULIRGs at modest redshift (z = −). This is
an active field of study using data from the ISO, Spitzer, and Herschel space observatories,
the BLAST instrument, far-IR cameras on large ground-based telescopes, and submillimeter
interferometers.

High-Precision Spectrum Measurements
The history of the measurements of the CMB spectrum is full of challenges and mistakes, later
overcome by clever design, diligent pursuit of systematic errors, and careful measurement of
foreground sources of radiation that might be mistaken for CMB. When the CMB was first pre-
dicted in 1948, a measurement had already been made by Dicke’s group at MIT, producing an
upper limit of 20 K, but no connection to the prediction was made at the time. Wright (2012)
gives an online tutorial and argues that Dicke might have been able to discover the CMB if he
had tried. But by the time Penzias and Wilson were hunting for excess noise in their system,
receiver sensitivity had advanced orders of magnitude, enough that the extra 3 K they saw was
a significant part of the equipment sensitivity. In addition, they knew that the full sensitivity

they wanted for telecommunication and astronomy would require an excellent antenna with
very low sidelobes (response to signals from directions outside the main beam of the antenna).
Also, scientific research projects now demanded liquid helium, which could be purchased com-
mercially, so it was possible to design a calibration process that would compare the sky with a
reference body at a low temperature. Finally, they were well aware that the Milky Way galaxy is
bright and that the atmosphere might emit radiation, so they knew that they should measure
these effects. All of these advances were crucial to their discovery and to the confirmation by
the Princeton group months later.
In this section we first describe the foregrounds that obstruct precise measurements of the
CMB spectrum and then describe the precise measurements already completed and the prepa-
rations now being made for even better measurements. Key projects include the COBE-FIRAS;
its immediate confirmation by a similar but brief COBRA rocket experiment by H. Gush et
al. and a balloon payload (ARCADE, Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and
Diffuse Emission) that has already flown to measure the cm-wave spectrum precisely; and the
TRIS ground-based measurement at 0.6, 0.82, and 2.5 GHz. We discuss a proposed satellite
mission (PIXIE, Primordial Inflation Explorer) that in principle could measure the CMB spec-
trum, anisotropy, and polarization and briefly describe the DARE (Dark Ages Radio Explorer),
a proposed lunar satellite to search for redshifted 21 cm HI radiation that can be seen as spectral
fluctuations of the CMB. We conclude with a discussion of the ultimate limits to CMB spectrum
measurements.
We summarize the main results of the precise spectrum measurements in >Table 13-1.
3.1 Minimizing Foregrounds
There are both diffuse and discrete foreground sources that limit the accuracy of CMB mea-
surements. Excellent summaries have been published by both the WMAP (Gold et al. 2011;
Bennett et al. 2003a) and Planck science teams (Planck Collaboration et al. 2011a and 25 addi-
tional articles in a dedicated journal issue), primarily addressing the effects on anisotropy
measurements. Neither WMAP nor Planck measures absolute brightness, and hence both
are insensitive to potential isotropic foreground radiation sources. Below, we discuss the
Earth and its atmosphere, the Solar System, and Galactic electrons, dust, atoms, ions, and
molecules.

628 13
Cosmic Microwave Background
3.1.1 Earth and Atmosphere
Terrestrial instrumentation must be protected from the brightness of the Earth, occupying 2π
sr of solid angle immediately under the equipment. Typically the shield is made of reflective
material but has a residual emissivity itself, which must be measured by for instance changing
its temperature, varying the angles of incidence, etc.
In addition, the primary antenna must be made with extremely low sidelobes, and ideally
those sidelobes must be mapped as a function of direction, polarization, and frequency. Many
designs have been used. The Bell Labs antenna was called a Hogg horn, combining a very large
pyramidal horn antenna with an off-axis parabolicreflectoroperating at 45○incidence tomake a
pattern with low response toward the ground. Other ground-based and low-altitude equipment
has typically used much smaller horns with scrupulous attention to detailed design and test.
One successful design uses a corrugated circular horn. These antennas have the advantage that
the beam pattern is nearly Gaussian and nearly independent of polarization.
Above that is the atmosphere,which has a temperaturegradient with altitude, moving invis-
ible clouds of water vapor and visible clouds of water droplets or ice crystals. In mountain areas,
the stratification of the atmosphere is not necessarily plane parallel, due to the wind blowing
over the topography. The atmosphere also has complex chemistry, including the possible pres-
ence ofwater-vapordimers that produce a continuum opacity. The primaryatmosphericopacity
at wavelengths where we wish to measure the CMB is due to water vapor, and there are also
oxygen lines at 60 and 120 GHz and many submillimeter lines of ozone. There are excellent
models for all of these except the water vapor dimers. Measuring and compensating for the
atmospheric emission and opacity was critically important for ground-based measurements of
the CMB spectrum. The primary technique is to measurethe dependenceof the measuredCMB
temperature on zenith angle.
3.1.2 Solar System
The diffuse zodiacal dust in the solar system, originating from the collisions of asteroids and
comets with each other, is not bright at CMB wavelengths but can be detected. Its spatial dis-
tribution is concentrated in the ecliptic plane, but the cloud is thick and the contrast from
ecliptic pole to ecliptic plane (at 90○elongation) is only about 1:3. According to theory and
confirmed by measurements with the DIRBE instrument on the COBE mission, the dust den-
sity falls off with distance from the Sun as a power law ρ ∝r−α, where α = .(Kelsall et al.
1998). The far-IR spectrum of the zodiacal dust was reported by Fixsen and Dwek (2002), based
on the FIRAS and DIRBE observations. At wavelengths longer than 150 μm, the dust appears
to have an emissivity proportional to ν, as expected from the Kramers-Kronig relations and
causality, for dust grains significantly smaller than the wavelength, sufficiently hot, and not
spinning.
In any case, little can be done currently to avoid this foreground emission, as it is diffi-
cult and expensive to put the observatory outside the zodiacal dust cloud. But in the future,
missions to the outer solar system will become more feasible, propelled by ion engines and
powered by more efficient radio-thermal generators, nuclear reactors, or even huge solar
collectors.

3.1.3 Galactic Electrons
Galactic electrons collide with protons to produce free-free (bremsstrahlung) radiation and
orbit in magnetic fields to produce synchrotron radiation. Both have spatial structure that
is highly concentrated toward the Galactic plane and the Galactic center, and both follow
approximate power-law spectra becausethe underlying electron energy spectra also have nearly
power-law form. As shown in > Fig. 13-2, below about 1 GHz, the synchrotron radiation is
brighter than the CMB, and below about 0.5 GHz the free-free emission is also. We estimate
the contribution of these sources to the CMB spectrum by mapping the entire sky at longer
wavelengths, where the electrons are dominant, and predicting the maps at higher frequen-
cies. There are subtleties related to deviations from simple power-law behavior, variations of
the power-law indices, and the effects of discrete sources and polarization on the modeling. In
addition, differences between the angular resolution and sideloberesponse of the antennasused
at different frequencies must be modeled. Considering all these complexities, precise experi-
ments are designed to have a wide range of wavelengths with the same antenna pattern at all
wavelengths. The WMAP team reported that the spectrum steepens between 20 and 40 GHz,
consistent with steeper spectrum synchrotron sources, or with spinning dust like models (Gold
et al. 2011). They conclude that masking out the bright regions of the Galaxy leaves negligi-
ble contribution to the CMB anisotropy or polarization. Similar methods could be used to
subtract Galactic foregrounds from future high-precision CMB spectrum measurements like
PIXIE.
Early results from the Planck mission confirm the WMAP result that the Galactic emission
is not fully represented by the simple models of free-free, synchrotron, and dust emission. For
example, there is a widely extended residual “haze” around the galactic center. Maps of the haze
resemble the maps of gamma-ray bubbles observed with the Fermi mission. Hooper and Linden
(2011) consider the possibility that dark matter annihilation produces the haze. In any case, it
is likely that the electron spectrum does not have the same power-law index everywhere, and
indeed nature does not require it to be a power law at all. This is an active research area for radio
astronomers as well as cosmologists.
3.1.4 Galactic Dust
As shown in > Fig. 13-2, at wavelengths less than about 0.5 mm (ν > GHz), the ther-
mal emission from interstellar dust grains is brighter than the CMB. Although interstellar dust
grains cannot be easily collected, evidence suggests that there are many different kinds, shapes,
sizes, and compositions and that they are not all at the same temperature even within a single
cloud of dust and gas. Their properties evolve with time as they are sputtered by cosmic rays, or
are heated in shocks or grain-grain collisions or near approaches to hot stars, or serve as con-
densation nuclei in cold gas clouds. Moreover, the grains can be aligned by magnetic fields, as
we know from the polarization of starlight and scattered starlight, and therefore can emit par-
tially polarized far-infrared radiation. In addition, the smallest grains can spin at frequencies
of 10–100 GHz. They rotate because they absorb and scatter light preferentially from locations
away from the center of mass, and their rotation rates are limited by their mechanical strength.
They are also struck occasionally by high-energy atoms and cosmic rays (Draine and Lazarian
1998, 1999).

630 13
Cosmic Microwave Background
The nonspinning dust emission is typicallyrepresented bya power-law emissivitymodifying
a Planck function: Iν ∝νβBν(T), with β ≈., not far from the Kramers-Kronig limit of 2.
However, this effective index may simply approximate the sum of dust populations at different
temperatures. The fitted temperatures range from 10 to over 20 K, depending on direction, and
sometimes more than one component is required for a single direction.
3.1.5 Galactic Atoms, Ions, and Molecules
Only a few species of Galactic atoms, ions, and molecules emit strongly enough to be detectable
(so far) in the wide bandwidths needed to measure the spectrum of the CMB. These are CO (up
to the 8–7 line), [C I] at 370 and 690 μm, [C II] at 158 μm, [N II] at 122 and 205 μm, [O I]
at 146 μm, and CH at 116 μm (Fixsen et al. 1999). They also found the 269 μm line of HO in
absorption against the Galactic center. The CO lines are dominant cooling lines for cold clouds,
and the [C II] line emits about 0.3% (Wright et al. 1991) of the dust luminosity of the Milky
Way, so they are of great interest for astrophysics. Because these lines are concentrated in the
Galactic plane and in molecular clouds, they have not limited the accuracy of CMB spectrum
measurements. On the other hand, the CO lines appear in the passbands of some instruments
designed to measure CMB anisotropy.
The lines also provide frequency calibration standards for CMB spectrometers. From these
calibrations and the known values of the Planck and Boltzmann constants, it was possible to
confirm and improve the thermometric accuracy of the COBE FIRAS.
3.2 COBE FIRAS
The most precise (50 parts per million) measurement of the CMB spectrum yet accomplished
was made with the FIRAS (Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer) on the COBE satellite
(Fixsen et al. 1996). The COBE (Boggess et al. 1992) was launched Nov. 18, 1989 from Vanden-
berg Air Force Base near Lompoc, California. It still orbits 900 km above the Earth in a polar
(94○inclination) Sun-synchronous orbit so that the orbit plane precesses at 1 rotation/year to
remain approximately perpendicular to the line to the Sun. The COBE carries three instru-
ments, all protected by a conical shield.The COBE was oriented so that the Sun was always a few
degrees below the plane of the top of the shield, so the instruments were well protected. How-
ever, for about 2 months per year, the Earth limb rose slightly above the shield plane for about
20 min out of each 103 min orbit. A higher altitude orbit could have avoided this situation but
would have caused higher rates of Van Allen belt particle bombardment. The FIRAS and DIRBE
(Diffuse InfraRed Background Experiment) instruments were cooled to about 1.5 K inside a
liquid helium cryostat. The third instrument, DMR (Differential Microwave Radiometers), was
mounted around the circumference of the cryostat and inside the shield.
3.2.1 FIRAS Design
The FIRAS was sensitive to wavelengths from 100 μm to 1 cm, including the peak emission of
the CMB around 2 mm, the Wien tail of the distribution for λ < mm, and strong emission

from the interstellar dust. The instrument was based on the design of the balloon-borne spec-
trometer flown by UC Berkeley in the mid-1970s (Woody et al. 1975; Woody and Richards
1979). The instrument is a rapid-scan, symmetrical polarizing Fourier transform spectrometer
with two inputs and two outputs, using the Martin and Puplett (1970) concept. The 7○instru-
ment beam is defined by a Winston cone, a quasi-optical compound parabolic concentrator
(Winston 1970). The orbit and orientation of the spacecraft meant that the spin axis and FIRAS
line of sight were approximately 94○from the Sun at all times and so swept out an approxi-
mately great circle as the satellite orbited the Earth. The circle moved with the Sun so that over
the course of 6 months, the beam scanned the entire sky, and in the 10 month duration of the
liquid helium, about 60% of the sky was observed at intervals 6 months apart. The Winston cone
attaches smoothly to an apodizing section, flared like a trumpet bell. Calibration was provided
by a full-beam external blackbody that could be moved into the antenna, where it sealed the
aperture. The interferometer mirrors were scanned smoothly in a sawtooth pattern, producing
a time-dependent intensity at each detector, and there were two stroke lengths and two stroke
speeds that could be chosen by command. The interferometer functions as a modulator that
compares two inputs, one from the sky (or external calibrator) and one from an internal ref-
erence body. Each output of the instrument is split by a dichroic beamsplitter into short and
long wavelength bands, separated at λ = .mm, so that there are four detectors altogether.
Combining the two scan speeds, the two stroke lengths, the two sides, and the two wavelength
bands, there are altogether 16 independent data sets (> Figs. 13-3 and >13-4).

ferent paths set by the mirror mechanism. After reﬂection, the light retraverses the beam splitter,

direct it into the elliptical mirrors (EL, ER), the dichroic ﬁlters, and, ﬁnally, the detectors (DetLH,

FIRAS calibration concept. The actual FIRAS used two wire grid polarizers with wires at 45○. The
external calibrator nearly sealed the horn antenna when in place. The internal reference body was
adjusted to nearly null the sky interferogram. Both horns and both blackbodies were controllable
from about 2 to 20 K
3.2.2 FIRAS Detectors and Data Processing
The four detectors were composite bolometers, with noise equivalent powers of the order of
NEP = × −W/Hz/. Each used a doped silicon thermometer chip, bonded to a large but
thin diamond octagon, blackened with a thin film of bismuth, and all suspended by taut Kevlar
fibers.EachwasDCbiasedthroughalargeresistor,andthesignalwasamplifiedbyaheatedJFET
tofeed the signal out the long coaxcable tothe warm electronics. The JFET was suspended inside
a radiation-tight box on Kevlar fibers so that it could operate near its optimum temperature of
about 60 K. The sensitivity was limited by charged particle impacts, which were very common
in certain parts of the orbit near the horns of the Van Allen belts around the Earth’s poles, and in
the South Atlantic Anomaly, where the radiation belts are especially near to the Earth.
Data processing began with sorting the interferograms into groups according to observing
mode, temperature settings of the horns and calibrators, detector bias, and line of sight. Then,
interferograms were compared to optimally detect the impulses from cosmic rays, and these
signatures were iteratively removed by a least squares fitting program.
3.2.3 FIRAS Calibration
The operation of FIRAS in the vacuum and cold of outer space enables a nearly ideal configu-
ration for comparison of the sky with a full-beam blackbody. If the calibrator body is perfectly
black and isothermal, and there is no change of the instrument signal when the body is inserted

Cosmic Microwave Background 13

or removed from the beam, then the sky also has a perfect blackbody spectrum, regardless of
the imperfections or calibration factors of the instrument or the uncertainty of the thermome-
ter calibration. To reduce the dynamic range of the instrument, the internal reference body
was adjusted to nearly null the modulated interferogram by setting its temperature close to the
sky temperature. To be more quantitative, temperature controllers were provided to regulate
the temperatures of the external calibrator and the internal reference body and of the Winston
cone (sky horn) and its counterpart facing the internal reference body.
The calibration (Fixsen et al. 1996) was designed to measure the parameters of an instru-
ment model that included the emissivities of the Winston cone (sky horn), the similar but
smaller horn (reference horn) receiving signals from the internal reference body, the emissivity
of the reference body, and systematic and temporary errors in thermometry. Although all the
thermometers were calibrated to mK accuracy before installation, there was evidence that the
calibrations were somewhatincorrect in flight. Fortunately, the thermometererrors do not limit
the determination of whether the sky has a blackbody spectrum, but they do limit the accuracy
of the determination of the absolute temperature. There were also small residual errors in the
calibration data sets that showed that the mirror transport mechanism (MTM) was vibrating
as it moved, as was known before launch, and that some light was making more than one pass
through the interferometer, yielding the appearance of harmonic response. Models were made
for these effects, and their parameters were determined from the data. In the end, there was a
single calibration model representing all the observing modes and all the detectors, with a full
covariance matrix for the errors (>Fig. 13-5).
The accuracy of the calibrator body is critical, and the design is reported by Mather et al.
(1999). It is made of Eccosorb CR-110, cast in the form of a reentrant cone, like a trumpet

mute. This is an epoxy loaded with iron powder to increase its permeability and absorption
of microwaves; in this case it was also mixed with a fine silica powder to make it thixotropic
(to resist the settling of the iron powder during casting). The calibrator material is cast onto
a corrugated copper foil to control its temperature and make it as isothermal as possible. The
support arm and the top of the calibrator are wrapped with multilayer insulation to protect
against radiant heat flow from the warm rim of the sunshield.
There are several ways in which the calibrator could be imperfect. First, it could be partially
reflective so that emission (or lack thereof) from parts of the spectrometer that are not at the
same temperature would change the effective input. Since the spectrometer includes parts at
many temperatures, this was the main worry. The relevant parts include the detectors, the mir-
rors, the beamsplitters, the horns, and the internal reference body, as well as the surrounding
chamber. Only the horns and the internal reference body could be actively controlled. The effec-
tive reflectance of the calibrator in the horn was made as low as possible and was estimated to
be less than −, depending on frequency. It was also measured with a value of −.±.dB at
33.4 GHz. When the calibrator is in the FIRAS horn, any ray reflected from the calibrator will
bounce from the horn surface many times and almost always return to the calibrator for another
chance to be absorbed, so the effective reflectivity of the calibrator in the horn is much lower
than the actual reflectivity. (The other absorbers in this cavity are the aluminum horn and the
exit port to the spectrometer.)Other potential errors include partial transparency of the calibra-
tor material, allowing leakage from the insulated outer surface, which was slightly illuminated
at some angles by rays from the solar shield around the cryostat. This effect, if important, would
be maximum at the longest wavelengths, where the calibrator material had the least absorptiv-
ity, but no sign of a problem was seen. A third potential effect would be leakage through the
gap between the calibrator and the horn. To control this leakage, two sets of aluminized Kapton
leaflets were installed around the circumference of the calibrator, to make a direct optical seal
of the gap, without transmitting any heat in case the calibrator and horn were at different tem-
peratures. Measurements were made of the calibration signal as a function of the position of the
calibrator in the horn, and no effect was seen until the calibrator had been moved about 12 mm.
A fourth effect would be if the calibrator were not isothermal. In this case, it would emit a spec-
trum like the cosmic y distortion and enable a real cosmic y distortion to escape notice. How-
ever, the measured temperature gradients, and the known thermal conductivity, together with
models ofthe potential heat flows, show this tobe negligible on the scale ofthe FIRASsensitivity.
Fixsen et al. (1996) and Fixsen (2009) developed alternate ways to redetermine the temper-
ature scale. The wavelength scale of the FIRAS was determined precisely using the atomic and
molecular spectrum lines of the Galaxy and used to cross-check the observations of the tem-
perature dependence of the calibration signals. Also, the spectrum of the dipole anisotropy of
the CMB as measured by FIRAS has its own spectral form (the derivative of the Planck func-
tion with respect to temperature) and can be used to determine yet another estimate of the
monopole temperature. Fortunately, all these measurements are consistent at the level of 1 mK.
Finally, the FIRAS results can be recalibrated using the WMAP dipole.
3.2.4 Foreground Removal for FIRAS
At the wavelengths observed by FIRAS, the main foreground is the dust emission from the
Galaxy, concentrated in the Galactic plane. An adequate (in the sense of good χ) model for
the dust emission in most lines of sight is a product of a power-law emissivity as a function of
frequency and a Planck function for a single temperature.However, in the Galactic plane where

Cosmic Microwave Background 13
635
the dust is bright, there were many regions where this was not an adequate fit, and two or even
three components at different temperatures were required. At high Galactic latitudes, the dust
is too faint to measure in most individual lines of sight, so a smoothed Galactic model was used
to fit the data. The smoothed model was not quite proportional to the cosecant of the Galactic
latitude.
The spectrum lines of the interstellar atoms, ions, and molecules had a negligible effect on
the measurementof the CMB spectrum because they are either faint, concentrated in the Galac-
tic plane and Galactic center, or at frequencies well above the CMB frequencies. The [C II] line
at 158 μm is so bright that it produces a recognizable cosine curve in the raw interferograms of
the Galactic plane.
3.2.5 Limits on CMB Spectrum Distortion
Least squares fits to the FIRAS data produced the limits in Fixsen et al. (1996). The fitted param-
eters are correlated because the y and μ distortion spectra are not orthogonal to the derivative
of the Planck function with respect to temperature ∂B/∂T or to the model spectra for the inter-
stellar dust. In addition, the calibration model parameters are themselves correlated. The results
were ∣μ∣< −and ∣y∣< ×−, 95% confidence, including systematic errors. The RMS devi-
ation between the measured spectrum and the blackbody is less than 50 parts per million of the
peak brightness.
The most precise measurement of the CMB temperature was reported by Fixsen (2009),
giving the value Tcmb = .± .K, based on recalibration of the FIRAS data in com-
parison with the WMAP data, and other published data. This precise value is important for
comparison with measurements at different wavelengths.
Fixsen et al. (1997) showed that the spatial fluctuations of the CMB as observed by the
FIRAS instrument on a 7○scale have a thermal spectrum (actually, the derivative of the Planck
function with respect to temperature),as they should if they are really temperaturefluctuations.
Stated another way, the FIRAS, an absolute instrument, detects the CMB anisotropy. The data
also limit rms fluctuations in the Compton y parameter, observable via the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich
effect, to Δy < × −(95% CL) on 7○angular scales.
3.3 COBRA Rocket Experiment
The COBRA rocket instrument of Gush et al. (1990) was launched for the fifth time on Jan.
20, 1990, just 2 months after the launch of COBE. Built at the University of British Columbia,
it included a rapid-scan Fourier transform spectrometer very similar in concept to the COBE
FIRAS instrument, but using a dielectric beamsplitter instead of the polarizing configuration.
In its 9 min of flight, it obtained excellent quality data, using a much colder detector (0.29 K)
than the FIRAS to gain far higher sensitivity. In its short flight, there was no time or space to
move an external calibrator body into the beam, so the instrument was calibrated on the ground
before launch, using an external calibrator with emissivity >0.999. There was also no time to
scan the sky or make a map. Nevertheless, it was immensely important that this instrument
also observed the blackbody and that its measured temperature (.± .K) agreed well
with the FIRAS result. (There was still the possibility that the FIRAS thermometers were not
correctly calibrated.) The reported 95% confidence limits on y and μ were 0.001 and 0.008,
respectively (>Fig. 13-6).

COBRA design of Gush et al. (1990) showing the principle of the apparatus. H1 and H2 are sim-
ilar horn-type telescopes of 6○ﬁeld of view. H1 receives radiation from the sky, whereas H2 is
illuminated by a blackbody simulator B. Radiation issuing from the horns enters a two-beam inter-
ferometer (Int), with a beam splitter at b, from whence it emerges to be focused on two bolometric
detectors, D1 and D2. As the path diﬀerence in the interferometer is changed, the signal gener-
ated by each detector (interferogram) is proportional to the diﬀerence in intensity of the sky and
the blackbody. The numbers indicate temperatures of various sections of the spectrometer. One
challengeof thedesign wasmakinga referenceload whose temperature could be changed reliably
during the brief rocket ﬂight.
3.4 ARCADE 2
The ARCADE 2 instrument (Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and Diffuse
Emission, described by Singal et al. (2011)) is the most ambitious yet built for measurement
of the CMB spectrum at wavelengths out to 10 cm (3 GHz). It is a balloon-borne microwave
radiometer with six frequencies (3, 5, 8, 10, 30, and 90 GHz), a double-nulled design with inter-
nal reference bodies and an external calibrator, and is completely windowless to enable all the
radiometrically active parts to be cooled to 2.7 K. It extends the FIRAS concept as far as pos-
sible to long wavelengths, given the size and atmospheric constraints of balloon payloads. To
improve on ARCADE 2 will require a redesigned top surface area or a space mission.
The key discovery that enables this design is that it is possible toachieve adequate flow veloc-
ities for gaseous helium, escaping in a controlled way from a 1,900 liter cryostat, to keep the

Cryogenic radiometers compare the sky to an external blackbody calibrator. The antennas and
external calibrator are maintained near 2.7 K at the mouth of an open bucket dewar; there are no
windows or other warm objects between the antenna and the sky. Cold temperatures are main-
tained at the top of the dewar via boil-oﬀhelium gas and tanks ﬁlled with liquid helium fed by
superﬂuid pumps in the bath. For observing the sky, everything shown is suspended below a
high-altitude balloon
atmosphere from condensing on the apparatus. Scale models of the aperture were built to sim-
ulate the flow on the ground, and in-flight cameras confirmed success. In addition, superfluid
fountain-effect pumps lifted up to 55 l/min of superfluid helium to the top of the apparatus, to
keep it cold. This is a remarkable feature of engineering that enables nearly ideal calibration to be
performed. Although the calibrators are in flowing gaseous helium, they can reach the desired
temperature of 2.725 K. The details and variations of heat flow and temperature gradients in the
calibrator bodies are then the limiting factors for calibration accuracy (>Fig. 13-7).
The ARCADE 2 used corrugated circular antenna feeds to produce 11.6○FWHM Gaussian
beams. In addition, it carried a 4○beam antenna at 30 GHz for useful cross-checks. All observed
at 30○from the zenith, away from the balloon and the payload suspension (parachute, ladder,
truck plate, and FAA transmitter). The beam profile of one of the horns was measured and

Cosmic Microwave Background
agreed extremely well with the theoretical predictions; it is almost independent of frequency
within each observing band. The calculated radiometric effects of the balloon and suspension
ranged from 2.3 to 42 mK, depending on frequency band.
The radiometers all used cryogenic HEMT amplifiers, which set the system sensitivity, fol-
lowed by coax or waveguide links to warm amplifiers. The input to each cryogenic HEMT was
switched to alternate between sky and reference load using a MEMS switch at 3 and 5 GHz and
a latching ferrite waveguide switch for the higher frequency channels. The cold loads were in
coax at the 3 and 5 GHz bands, and were made of steelcast wedges in waveguide for the other
channels. The warm amplifiers were followed by frequency filters that divided each band into
two parts, low and high, for improved spectral information.
3.4.1 ARCADE 2 Calibration
The critically important external calibrator was moved from one receiver aperture to another,
so all shared the same thermometry and almost the same thermal environment, just as for the
COBE-FIRAS. A precursor calibrator is described by Kogut et al. (2004) and the actual device
by Fixsen et al. (2006). The calibrator surface was made from 298 sharp cones of steelcast, each
88 mm long and 35 mm in diameter, cast onto an aluminum core for thermal control. The mea-
sured reflectance of the calibrator ranged from −42.4 dB at 3 GHz to −62.7 dB at 10 GHz. These
reflectances are so low that they are not a significant source of error. The harder problem is ther-
mal gradient control, considering the flowing gaseous helium and the superfluid helium pumps.
The measured thermal gradient from tip to base of the cones is 600 mK, but 98% of it occurs
near the tip and involves only 3% of the absorber. The calculated calibrator emission was based
on the measured thermal gradients, the known absorption properties of the material, and the
known field distribution of the antenna pattern. There are systematic differences in heat flow
according to the position of the calibrator over the different receiver apertures, but these were
measured with many sensors. The calibration accuracy of ARCADE 2 could be improved up to
an order of magnitude, by providing active control of the temperature of the top plate, to near
2.7 K instead of the 1.4 K achieved in the last flight.
3.4.2 ARCADE 2 Results
Seiffert et al. (2011) report the final results from the ARCADE 2 instrument after accounting for
all calibration issues and the Galactic foreground. They find σ limits on the spectral distortion
of μ < ×−and ∣Yff∣< ×−. They also find that there is a residual signal that significantly
exceeds the models of all known galactic and extragalactic sources. It has a power-law spectrum
with amplitude .± .K at 0.31 GHz and a spectral index of −.± .(>Fig. 13-8).
Vernstrom et al. (2011) consider the extragalactic source population in detail and conclude
that their model does not explain the ARCADE 2 results. Seiffert et al. (2011) had suggested
that there might be a population of sub-μJy sources down to 10 nJy at 1.4 GHz that add up to
enough, and it might be possible if high z star-forming galaxies have a higher radio-to-far-IR
ratio than local ones. Radio observations at greater depth than yet obtained could be made with
the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) and the ALMA.

3.5 TRIS
Gervasi et al. (2008) report on the ground-based TRIS experiment (Zannoni et al. 2008), which
improved the uncertainty of measurements at frequencies of 0.60 and 0.82 GHz by factors of 9
and 7, respectively, and agreed with prior measurements at 2.5 GHz. The improvements were
obtained through better absolute calibration and better modeling of the Galactic foregrounds.
The TRIS operated primarily by doing drift scans while pointed at the zenith. Absolute cali-
bration was obtained using a cryogenic front end of each receiver, with a triple-throw switch
to connect the receiver to the sky, a cold load (CL) near 4 K, or a warm load (WL) near 270 K
(>Fig. 13-9).
The results for the spectrum distortion parameters were −.× −< Yff < .× −and

3.6 PIXIE
The proposed Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) is a nulling polarimeter for cosmic
microwave background observations as described by Kogut et al. (2011). It improves on the
FIRAS in several ways, and it is able to measure the polarization and anisotropy of the CMB
as well as its spectrum. It is fully symmetrical, unlike the FIRAS, and either of the two inputs
can observe the sky or a full-beam reference blackbody. It would cover the range from 30 GHz
to 6 THz (1 cm–50 μm wavelength) in 400 spectral channels and could map the Stokes I, Q,
and U parameters over the whole sky. While the primary objective in today’s context is the
search for the polarization signature of primordial gravitational waves, the ability to test the
CMB monopole spectrum against a blackbody is remarkable (>Fig. 13-10).
Improvements over the FIRAS concept include the use of 550 mm-diameterprimary reflec-
tors todefine the beams on the sky, instead ofthe quasi-optical Winston cone used bythe FIRAS.
The PIXIE design preserves the polarization sensitivity, which was intentionally ignored in the

Cosmic Microwave Background
FIRAS. Each output is split into two polarization states following a square concentrator in front
of the detectors so that there are four detectors in total. The beam size is smaller (2.6○top hat)
than the FIRAS (7○) and is optimized for the low-order peak in the primeval B-mode polariza-
tion spectrum. Other instruments, many on the ground or balloons, appear capable of detecting
the higher order polarization peak. But a full characterization of the low-order (ℓ< ) B-mode
peak requires full sky coverage and a space mission. The étendue (AΩ = 4 cmsr) is much larger
than for FIRAS (1.5 cmsr), enabling good performance at longer wavelengths. The individual
detector sensitivity is almost two orders of magnitude better (× −vs. × −W Hz−/),
based on the use of lower detector temperature (0.1 K instead of 1.4 K). In addition, the entire
instrument (except the detectors) is cooled to the mean temperature of the CMB (2.725 K) so
that emissions and reflections within the instrument do not produce modulated signals. Finally,
the PIXIE would be cooled by active refrigerators (a mechanical cryo-cooler and staged adia-
baticdemagnetization refrigerators), as well as passive radiators, sothat its much-longer(4 year)
lifetime is not limited by stored cryogens (>Fig. 13-11).

The entire PIXIE observatory would spin at 4 rpm, much faster than the COBE (0.8 rpm),
for rapid modulation of the polarization in the shorter time that it takes for the line of sight
to move one beamwidth across the sky. The orbit altitude (660 km) is lower than for COBE
(900 km), reducing the cosmic ray rates on the detectors.
The predicted PIXIE sensitivity for polarization is 70 nK per 1○square pixel, corresponding
to multipole orders up to about 200. Averaged over the best 75% of the sky, it would havea sensi-
tivity of 3 nK for the B-mode polarization signal, well under the 30nK predicted from large-field
inflation models, and comparable to the predicted noise floor from gravitational lensing of the
CMB. For the spectrum distortions, after accounting for foreground removal, the predicted
PIXIE sensitivity is μ of −or y of × −. For comparison, the FIRAS limits were ∣μ∣< −
and ∣y∣< × −, 95% confidence, including systematic errors. So the PIXIE would have a
distortion sensitivity of three to four orders of magnitude better, opening up many possibilities
for tests or detections of unexpected cosmic phenomena.
3.7 DARE
The Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE, Burns et al. 2012) is a proposed space mission to
measure the very long wavelength spectrum of the CMB with enough precision to detect
the variations due to the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line. Since the galactic synchrotron and
free-free emissions all have smooth power-law spectra, deviations from those forms would be
meaningful. Operating in the 40–120 MHz range, the mission would be sensitive to hydrogen at
redshifts from 11 to 35. To obtain a quiet-enough environment, the instrument would orbit the
Moon and would observe when it is protected from both the Sun and the Earth. The predicted
spectrum distortions range from +30 mK around 100 MHz from the Hot-Bubble-dominated
epoch, to −110 mK around 65 MHz due to accreting black holes. Instrument calibration at these
low frequencies is done with noise diodes, and the antennas are short dipoles and hence very
nondirectional. The predicted spectral features are relatively narrow (10%) so that they would
be recognizable even in the presence of strong Galactic emission.
3.8 Ultimate Limits
The PIXIE instrument pushes the limits of what will be possible, as its estimated sensitivity is
3–4 orders of magnitude better than the COBE FIRAS. Measurements to detect the spectral
distortions from the individual recombination lines at decoupling would require parts per bil-
lion sensitivity, but on the other hand, a template for all of them together might be more easily
recognizable. It might well be possible to achieve adequate raw sensitivity with an advanced
mission, but at this level every foreground component will be bright, including molecules with
narrow spectral features. Is the Planck function correct? The calibration data for the FIRAS
instrument and the proposed PIXIE instrument could be used to test it very well. Note that the
cosmological results do not require a precise verification of the Planck formula; all they require
is that the sky and the blackbody calibrator must match.

Historical Overview of Temperature and Polarization Anisotropy
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation was detected by Penzias and Wilson
(1965). After its discovery, a small number of experimentalists worked for years to better
characterize the CMB as they searched for temperature fluctuations. It is uncommon that the
beginning, emergence, and maturation of a scientific field can be seen so clearly. The anisotropy
was discovered nearly 20 years ago (Smoot et al. 1992). In that time, the temperature power
spectrum has been mapped out through eight acoustic peaks, the best-fit cosmological model
identified, and the polarization anisotropy (an independent check of the model, in this case)
measured to high accuracy. As of this writing, we await the release of the Planck data. In the
following, we briefly review the set of measurements that got us to where we are, summarize
the current state of the data and its interpretation, and then indicate some future promising
directions. In a separate contribution, Hanany et al. (2012), CMB instrumentation is discussed,
so that is not included here.
4.1 Anisotropy Searches Prior to COBE
One of the primary reasons for believing that the Penzias and Wilson discovery was cosmo-
logical in origin was that the radiation was isotropic. Immediately, one wanted to know “how
isotropic is it?” The instrumentation for measuring anisotropy is quite different than that used
for the absolute temperature measurements. The first dedicated instrument was the Wilkinson
and Partridge (1967) “isotropometer.” The instrument had a beam width of .○at a frequency
of 9.4 GHz and was used to set an upper limit of 3.2 mK on the dipole amplitude at a declination
of −○, and a limit on smaller-scale anisotropy of
√
ℓ(ℓ+ )Cℓ/π < ,μK at ℓ∼. Given
estimates of galaxy peculiar velocities, it was apparent early on (Peebles and Wilkinson 1968;
Bracewell and Conklin 1968) that a dipole term should exist at an amplitude of roughly 3 mK.
This term tells us our velocity with respect to a cosmic reference frame. The first measurement of
the dipole, consistent with the modern value and direction (.±.in direction α = .h
at δ = −.○), was made by Ned Conklin from White Mountain in California (Conklin 1969),
although there were lingering doubts about the accounting of foreground emission (Webster
1974). Clearer detections were later reported by Corey and Wilkinson (1976) and Smoot et al.
(1977).
This velocity dipole, or “aether drift,” was the first CMB anisotropy observed. However, it
was clear that if cosmic structure grew from the Big Bang, then it had to leave an imprint as
anisotropy in the CMB. The magnitude of the anisotropy was uncertain. The expansion rate,
geometry, and composition of the universe were all poorly known. It was not clear just how
large the foreground signals were relative to the anisotropy or if the reionization of the universe
erased the anisotropy en route.
Before COBE, there were over 30 different experiments, including the RELIKT satellite
mission, aimed at searching for the anisotropy, as detailed in Peebles et al. (2009). Many
experiments yielded multiple observations in different configurations. The search took place
over a range of angular scales and at many frequencies. As the bounds tightened, theories
of structure formation evolved. There was a remarkable and steady advance that drove the
development of new detector technologies: masers, heterodyne systems, bolometers, and new
ways of observing the cosmos. Observations were made from balloons, airplanes, and on
the ground from Saskatoon, Canada to the South Pole. At last, in 1992, almost 30 years after
the discovery of the CMB, the anisotropy was discovered by the DMR instrument aboard the

COBE satellite (Smoot et al. 1992). The sky map from DMR’s most sensitive 53 GHz band is
shown in > Fig. 13-12. By that time, the measured anisotropy level was somewhat higher
than expected from theory. The interpretation paper, from Wright et al. (1992), reports “The
observed anisotropy is consistent with all previously measured upper limits and with a number
of dynamical models of structure formation. For example, the data agree with an unbiased cold
dark matter (CDM) model with H= km/s Mpc and δM/M = in a 16 Mpc radius sphere.
Other models, such as CDM plus massive neutrinos [hot dark matter (HDM)], or CDM with
a nonzero cosmological constant are also consistent with the COBE detection and can provide
the extra power seen on 5–10,000 km/s scales.”
By the time of the COBE-DMR discovery, receiver technology had advanced to the point
where the anisotropy could, in principle, be detected in one night of observation. Using data
taken from before the COBE launch, the FIRS team soon confirmed the COBE discovery as
shown in >Fig. 13-13.

roughly a quarter of the sky in a one-night balloon ﬂight. Both estimates use the same portion of
the sky to facilitate the comparison and excise data with ∣b∣< 15○. The similarity is striking: the
ﬂuctuations in DMR were also present in FIRS. The uncertainties are correlated between angular
bins, so assessing statistical signiﬁcance is subtle, but the conﬁrmation by FIRS is highly signiﬁcant

4.2 From COBE to WMAP
The COBE-DMR experiment had relatively coarse angular resolution: 7○FWHM. The casual
horizon size at decoupling, when the CMB photons were last scattered, is only 1.2○1, so DMR
was insensitive to causal physical processes occurring on these subhorizon scales. In particular,
there were predictions that acoustic waves in the primordial plasma could have a coherence that
would impart distinctive structure in the CMB anisotropy on subdegree (subhorizon) scales.
Thus the COBE detection opened eyes to the potential for what the anisotropy on smaller angu-
lar scales could tell us. There were many questions: How large was the foreground emission on
these scales? Did reionization erase the anisotropy at intermediate angular scales? Were acous-
tic features present, or did the power spectrum have less ringing? Did cosmic strings play a role
in structure formation? Were the fluctuations produced by an isocurvature process, rather than
an adiabatic one?
1We follow the conventions in Komatsu et al. (2011) because they are clearly defined but note that the often
used scaling of Δθ ∼○/ℓgives different results.

If the primordial fluctuations were adiabatic, meaning that the constituent species of matter
and radiation were perturbed in phase by the source mechanism, then the small-scale CMB
anisotropy should exhibit a series of “acoustic peaks.” Measuring the spacing and amplitude
of the peaks would allow one to infer a number of fundamental cosmological parameters: the
geometry and age of the universe, the abundance of baryonic and dark matter, and the slope of
the primordial power spectrum of dark matter fluctuations. The fact that COBE-DMR was able
to measure CMB anisotropy above the level of the galactic foregrounds on large angular scales
gave the community hope that extracting the full potential of the CMB was within reach.
It is not possible to do justice to all the experimental work that took place in the decade
between COBE and WMAP. There were roughly 25 independent efforts using a host of tech-
nologies and methods, all discussed in Peebles et al. (2009). The excitement of the science drove
advances in detector and receiver technology. Over the decade, there were no major missteps,
just a steady progression of more and more precise measurements. Immediately after COBE,
there was a flurry of detections: the first measurementof the degree-scale power spectrum came
from Saskatoon (Netterfield et al. 1997), while the existence and position of the first acoustic
peak was identified by Miller et al. (1999), Knox and Page (2000), and Mauskopf et al. (2000).
A tremendous advance by the Boomerang (de Bernardis et al. 2000) and Maxima (Hanany et al.
2000) teams revealed the CMB landscape with high precision. The next few acoustic peaks then
revealed themselves over the next few years (Netterfield et al. 2002; Halverson et al. 2002; Ruhl
et al. 2003) as did the Silk damping tail (Readhead et al. 2004; Kuo et al. 2004). The status of
CMB anisotropy measurements just prior to WMAP is shown in >Fig. 13-14.

WMAP
In 1995, following the COBE-DMR discovery of CMB anisotropy, and contemporaneous with
the experimental efforts noted above, the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) mission was
proposed to measure CMB fluctuations with greater precision and accuracy than was possible
with the DMR. Specifically, MAP was tailored to have an angular resolution of better than 1/3○
in order to resolve the CMB’s acoustic oscillation features expected to be present at subhorizon
distance scales (about 2○across the sky at the distance of the last scattering surface). If present,
the features would allow one to deduce detailed information about the shape, content, and age
of the universe, among other things.
As MAP was being developed, the guiding principle was control of systematic errors
(Bennett et al. 2003b). Among the design features incorporated into the mission were:
•
A symmetric differential design
•
Rapid large-sky-area scans
•
Four switching/modulation periods
•
A highly interconnected and redundant set of differential observations
•
An Lorbit to minimize contamination from Sun, Earth, and Moon emission and allow for
thermal stability
•
Multiple independent channels
•
Five frequency bands to enable a separation of galactic and cosmic signals
•
Passive thermal control with a constant Sun angle for thermal and power stability
•
Control of beam sidelobe levels to keep the Sun, Earth, and Moon levels <μK
•
A main beam pattern measured accurately in-flight (using Jupiter)
•
Calibration determined in-flight to the subpercent level (from the CMB dipole and its
modulation from MAP’s motion)
•
Low cross-polarization levels (below −20 dB)
•
Precision temperature sensing at selected instrument locations
Because of these multiple cross-checks, the MAP data could be understood in great detail. As
discussed, the precision, accuracy, and reliability made possible by this has set the foundation
for the standard model of cosmology.
>Figure 13-15 shows a side view of the MAP’s differential observatory, indicating two lines
of sight to the sky which are sensed by the differential receivers located in the focal plane assem-
bly (FPA), directly underneath the telescope. The FPA itself, shown in the lower right, prior to
its integration on the spacecraft, houses 10 “differencing assemblies” spanning frequencies from
23 to 94 GHz.
MAP was launched at 15:47 EDT on 30 June 2001 from Cape Canaveral, FL aboard a Delta
7425–10 rocket. The satellite executed a sequence of phasing loops to position itself for a lunar
swingby en route to the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point, L. MAP commenced cosmologi-
cal observations from Lon 10 August 2001. The first results from MAP – based on one year of
data – were released in February 2003. A few months prior to the first release, one of the leading
figures in CMB research, and a founding member of the MAP team, Dave Wilkinson of Prince-
ton University, passed away. The satellite was renamed the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) in his honor. Subsequent data releases, based on 3, 5, and 7 years of data at L
were released in 2006, 2008, and 2010, respectively; and each release subsumes the earlier data
and incorporates improved data processing algorithms. In this chapter we only discuss the most
recent results based on 7 years of data.

5.1 WMAP Sky Maps
The five frequency band maps produced from 7 years of WMAP observations at L2 are shown
in >Fig. 13-16 (temperature anisotropy) and >Fig. 13-17 (polarization anisotropy). These full-
sky maps are the primary product of the WMAP mission since they represent the most
compressed form of the mission data one can produce without essential loss of information.
The temperature maps show significant emission in the galactic plane due to synchrotron, free-
free, and dust emission, but the CMB emission – seen clearly in the maps at high galactic
latitude – is constant in thermodynamic temperature units. The polarization maps also show
clear Galactic emission, primarily from synchrotron radiation, but the polarized CMB emission
is only detected statistically – no specific feature seen in the polarization maps can be ascribed
to the CMB.

The WMAP 7-year frequency band maps in galactic coordinates from 23 to 94 GHz. Note the
strong frequency dependence of the galactic microwave emission and the constancy of the CMB
ﬂuctuations at high galactic latitude
The frequency spectrum of the Galactic emission is very different from the CMB.
> Figure 13-18 shows the frequency spectra of the known galactic emission components, in
antenna temperature units, compared to CMB anisotropy in the same units. The vertical range
of each emission band indicates the rms signal level as a function of frequency if 77% (lower)
or 85% (upper) of the sky is retained. The five WMAP frequency bands, which are each ∼20%
wide, span the minimum of the galactic foreground window. There are a variety of techniques
that can be employed to separate the CMB component from the Galactic emission, each with
their own advantages and disadvantages. Conceptually, the simplest approach is to form a linear
combination of the frequency bands in such a way as to cancel signals with a Galactic spectrum
while preserving signal with a CMB spectrum. This approach has been taken by the WMAP
team to produce the “Internal Linear Combination” (ILC) CMB map shown in > Fig. 13-19
(Bennett et al. 2003a; Gold et al. 2011).
The CMB map depicted in >Fig. 13-19 looks like random noise, and in a very specific sense,
that is exactly what it is. There is no theory of cosmology that predicts any specific feature in the
CMB, only the statistical properties of the fluctuations in the map. As a result, we must analyze
the map using statistics that can be compared to theoretical models. Perhaps the most remark-
able feature of the CMB map is that there is a preferred angular scale in the data. One way to
see this is via a stacking analysis: take every isolated hot spot (local maximum) in the map and
excise a postage stamp image of the data in its vicinity. Now coadd the postage stamp images

The WMAP 7-year frequency band polarization maps from 23 to 94 GHz. The maps are dominated
by galactic synchrotron and dust emission
with each one centered on the location of its respective temperature peak. Repeat the procedure
for the locus of cold spots. The results of this stacking are shown in >Fig. 13-20. The remarkable
feature in the temperature data (left panels) are the concentric rings 1.2○from the central hot
and cold spots. These features are the remnants of acoustic waves that propagated in the pri-
mordial plasma for 400,000 years until the electrons and protons “recombined” in the cooling
plasma to form neutral gas which could no longer support acoustic waves. From this time on,
CMB photons have propagated across the universe largely unimpeded, carrying with them the
image of the last scattering or decoupling epoch, and all the information that it encodes.
5.2 WMAP Angular Power Spectrum
As noted above, cosmological models do not predict specific features in the CMB anisotropy,
only their statistical properties. The simplest models predict that the CMB fluctuations are
Gaussian distributed with random phase. We define the precise meaning of this shortly, but

WMAP observed in ﬁve bands because the foreground emission from our own Galaxy has a dif-
ferent frequency spectrum than the CMB (which is constant in the units used by WMAP), and the
multifrequency data enables a separation of the two components

The WMAP 7-year CMB map formed from an internal linear combination (“ILC”) of the ﬁve fre-
quency band maps, in such a way as to null emission with galactic frequency spectra
we note first that a Gaussian, random-phase field can be completely characterized by its 2-point
correlation function, or equivalently, its angular power spectrum. Higher-order moments can
be uniquely related to the 2-point (variance) statistics.
True for many analyses, it is convenient to expand the temperature anisotropy map, T(n),
in the basis of spherical harmonic functions, Yℓm(n),
T(n) = ∑
ℓ,m
aℓmYℓm(n).
(13.2)
(The inclusion of the monopole and dipole terms (ℓ= , ) in this expansion are a matter of
convention. Processes associated with these terms are distinct from those of the higher-order
anisotropy. These contributions are discussedearlier in this article.) The leading explanation for
the origin of the ℓ> anisotropy is that it arises from perturbations generated during inflation.

Each of the four panels represents a 5○× 5○square of sky. As discussed in the text, these images
display the remnants of acoustic oscillations in the primordial plasma
We cannot predict the map T(n) (or, equivalently, the aℓm coefficients) but rather only the
statistical properties ofthe aℓm. Ifthe fluctuations are indeed Gaussian, distributed with random
phases, then the aℓm distribution is completely specified by its angular power spectrum,
Cℓ≡⟨∣aℓm∣⟩,
(13.3)
where the angle brackets indicate ensemble average, in this case over an ensemble of widely
separated cosmic observers, each of whom samples a statistically independent realization of
the cosmic fluctuation field. The primary goal of anisotropy measurements is to estimate the
underlying power spectrum as accurately as possible from the data since this is the observable
that allows one to constrain cosmological parameters.
In practice, since we have only one sample of the cosmic fluctuation field on our own
surface of last scattering, our ability to infer the parent spectrum, Cl, is limited by “cosmic
variance.” Conceptually, if we have a full-sky anisotropy map, we can invert (> 13.2) to obtain

is
ΔCℓ= Cℓ

ℓ+ .
(13.5)
For the quadrupole (ℓ= ) power, this implies an irreducible uncertainty of 63%; at high ℓ,
the fractional uncertainty falls as ℓ−/, becoming subdominant to instrument noise at suitably
high ℓ. As of this writing, the measured spectrum uncertainty is limited by cosmic variance up
to ℓ= . The Cℓmeasurementby the Planck satelliteis expected to be cosmic variance limited
to ℓ≈,.
Readers more comfortable with position space than Fourier space may prefer to character-
ize the fluctuation properties by the angular correlation function, C(θ). This is related to the
angular power spectrum by a Legendre transform

which can be estimated directly from a sky map by averaging the product of all temperature
measurements separated by an angle θ,

(13.7)
where the average is taken over all direction pairs, n, n′ such that n ⋅n′ = cos θ (to within some
finite bin size in θ).
In practice, real world effects such as instrument noise, systematic errors, and contamina-
tion from Galactic emission force us to adopt significantly more difficult methods for estimating
the power spectrum and its uncertainty. However, due to clever work by a great number of
researchers in the field, these hurdles have been largely overcome, and they do not qualitatively
alter the simple description given above.
The angular power spectrum inferred from the 7-year WMAP data is shown in >Fig. 13-21.
The red curve is the best-fit ΛCDM model fit to the data (see >Sect. 6). The error bars plot-
ted with the data show the uncertainty due to WMAP’s instrument noise, while the gray band
centered on the ΛCDM curve indicates the cosmic variance associated with that model. We
expect the power spectrum observed in our sky to fluctuate from the underlying smooth curve
by an amount characterized by the gray band, even in the absence of instrument noise, and our
inference of the best-fit model must account for this cosmic variance.
5.3 Beyond WMAP
Aside from WMAP, the flurry of experimental activity that preceded it has continued to the
present day. ESA’s Planck satellite is remapping the CMB sky with exquisite sensitivity and
angular resolution more than twice that of WMAP’s. Planck was launched on May 14, 2009,
from Kourou, French Guiana. The cryogenic HFI instrument observed for over 2.5 years before

continues to observe as of this writing. The first cosmological results from Planck are expected
in early 2013, and the community eagerly awaits them.
In the meantime, two flagship ground-based telescopes have each been deployed for a few
years now: the South Pole Telescope is a 10-m observatory situated at the South Pole station,
while the Atacama CosmologyTelescope (ACT)is a 6-m observatorydeployed at an elevation of
>5,000 m in the Atacama Desert in Chile. Both of these systems are equipped with state-of-the-
art bolometric receiver systems that render them capable of measuring temperature anisotropy
up to multipole moments of l ∼,. Both SPT and ACT extend the reach of CMB obser-
vations well beyond that obtainable by WMAP (and even Planck, though the latter will have
superior power spectrum sensitivity up to l ∼,due to its full sky coverage). A compilation
of the WMAP, SPT, and ACT power spectrum measurements is shown in >Fig. 13-22. The
cosmological implications of these measurements are discussed next.

The Standard Cosmological Model
In this section, we interpret the CMB data and other observations in terms of a handful of
cosmological parameters. We take as a starting point that the dynamics of the universe are gov-
erned by General Relativity and that the Cosmological Principle applies, namely that on suitably
large scales, the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. In the context of General Relativity
(a metric theory of gravity), the Cosmological Principle requires that the metric of space-time
be of the Robertson-Walker form. This metric can have positive, negative, or zero spatial curva-
ture, and the relative size of the universe can be described by a dimensionless scale factor, a(t),
whose dynamics are governed by the Friedmann equations: the Einstein equations applied to
the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric. The specific behavior of a(t) depends on the initial

et al. 2011; Shirokoﬀet al. 2011; Das et al. 2011a; Keisler et al. 2011). The best-ﬁt ΛCDM cosmologi-
cal model (solid red) dominates the signal up to l ∼3,000. The model power spectrum for ℓ> 3,000
is due to Poisson noise from confusion-limited dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) observed at

their window functions (the degree to which beam smoothing suppresses variance as a function

conditions and on the matter and radiation content of the universe, but to our knowledge, it
has been monotonically increasing throughout time.
As discussed earlier, the blackbody spectrum of the CMB provides compelling evidence
for a hot early universe that was in thermal equilibrium and which has expanded and cooled
adiabatically. As we discuss later, the detailed expansion history is a topic of intense current
research. The isotropy of the CMB brightness suggests an isotropic universe, consistent with
the Cosmological Principle. While isotropy does not require homogeneity, isotropy without
homogeneity would require that we occupy a special place in the universe, which seems unten-
able. Further, the observation that galaxies recede from us, on average, at a speed proportional
to their distance, implies a homogeneous expansion; indeed, homogeneous expansion requires
this proportionality. And, while some argue that there is no definitive evidence for a cutoff in the

Cosmic Microwave Background 13
657
scale at which galaxies cluster, most workers in the field accept that at scales beyond ∼1,000Mpc,
the clustering of matter becomes insignificant. Thus, throughout most of this chapter, we adopt
the homogeneous and isotropic Hot Big Bang Model as our paradigm.
6.1 The Origin of Structure
The notion that the universe is homogeneous is a useful approximation, but it obviously breaks
down at some point because there is clearly structure in our universe. On scales smaller than
∼100 Mpc, the contrast between overdense and underdenseregions exceeds unity; and on scales
comparable to our Solar System, it far exceeds unity! In contrast, anisotropy in the CMB limits
structure in the radiation field to be of order one part in , which implies corresponding limits
on baryonic matter fluctuations on large scales, at early times. The basic paradigm for structure
formation is that some process seeded fluctuations in the very early universe – cosmic inflation
is the leading mechanism – and that these fluctuations grew in time by gravitational accretion to
form the structure we see today. In fact, much of what we know about our universe comes from
observing the evolution of cosmic structure over a range of scales. CMB anisotropy provides the
cleanest probe of structure because it is weak, and therefore a product of simple linear physics,
but laterobservations ofstructure as traced bygalaxies are alsocrucial toconstrain cosmological
models.
It is beyond the scope of this chapter to cover perturbation theory in General Relativity, or
the technology of N-body simulations that are required to study nonlinear structure. Rather,
we will focus on what the current observations of structure tell us about cosmological models.
For the purpose of interpreting CMB anisotropy, the most important concept to under-
stand is that of “baryon acoustic oscillations” (BAO). We imagine that some process like cosmic
inflation imparted a spectrum ofdensityperturbations tothe universe at veryearlytimes – effec-
tively t = – and we wish to track how those perturbations evolve between then and the time
when the CMB was decoupled 400,000 years later. The basic physics of acoustic oscillations was
worked out in the late 1960s (Peebles and Yu 1970; Sunyaev and Zel’dovich 1970a; Silk 1968)
and has been refined ever since, to the point where numerical codes that solve the Boltzmann
transport equations can now predict matter and radiation perturbation spectra to an accuracy
of better than 1% (Howlett et al. 2012).
If the initial fluctuations were “adiabatic,” meaning that the various species of matter and
radiation perturbed in phase, then an initial overdensity of baryonic matter will propagate
outward as a sound wave front with a speed that is determined by the bulk modulus of the
relativistic plasma, cs ≈c/
√
, where c is the speed of light. When the cosmic plasma becomes
neutral at the epoch of recombination, the sound waves in the photon-baryon fluid “freeze out”
due to the loss of photon pressure. The distance traveled by these wave fronts is called the sound
horizon (or the BAO scale) and is known very precisely from the propagation velocity and the
travel time, both of which only depend on the matter to radiation ratio, which is now quite well
measured.
The effect of BAO on the radiation is to impart a feature in its 2-point correlation func-
tion or angular power spectrum. Specifically, we expect a coherent series of peaks in the power
spectrum, corresponding to the harmonics of the propagating sound wave fronts. The detailed
spacing and amplitude of these peaks contain a wealth of information about the geometry and
contents of the universe. Indeed, the mere existence of these peaks is a remarkable triumph for

658 13
Cosmic Microwave Background
theoretical cosmology. The fact that such structure was predicted long before it was considered
observable is an excellent reminder that cosmology is a predictive science.
It is worth emphasizing this point once again. The relatively narrow width and coherence
of the eight acoustic peaks seen in > Figs. 13-21 and >13-22 are an indication that the initial
fluctuations were predominantly adiabatic. Specifically, the WMAP7 data limits out-of-phase
“isocurvature” perturbations to be less than ∼10% of the total signal. The fact that we are able
to resolve these peaks at all is the key feature that makes the CMB such a powerful probe of
cosmological parameters. The universe could have easily been much more complicated than it
has turned out to be so far.
6.2 Geometry of the Universe
In the context of the General Relativity and the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, a flat
universe is an unstable fixed point. That is, any positive or negative spatial curvature present
in the universe grows with time. In order for the universe to be within an order of magnitude
of flat today – as measured by the total energy density, Ω– it must have been extremely close
to unity in the past. This fine-tuning problem, known as the flatness problem, was one of the
motivating factors for cosmic inflation. Inflation addresses the flatness problem by invoking
a period of accelerated expansion in the very early universe, which dilutes any existing spatial
curvature to negligible levels. Generically, inflation predicts that the geometry should be should
be flat to a part in 10.
CMB anisotropy probes geometry by measuring the angular size of the sound horizon, as
probed by the position of the first acoustic peak in the power spectrum. If we know the distance
to the last scattering surface, we can complete the triangle and determine the shape of light-like
geodesics that span the space between us and the last scattering surface. Unfortunately, the
distance to the last scattering surface is not known a priori, since it depends on the low-redshift
normalization of the distance-redshift relation, that is, the Hubble constant. We illustrate this
degeneracy in >Fig. 13-23.
On the left are two hypothetical triangles with the same opening angle and sound hori-
zon but different lengths. To first order the CMB is unable to distinguish between these two
geometries. This is shown quantitatively in the right panel which shows allowable models that
are consistent with the WMAP data. Each point in the panel represents a cosmological model
that falls within the 95% confidence region of the WMAP7 data. The points are color-coded
by the value of the Hubble constant required to produce the correct angular size of the sound
horizon (as measured by the first acoustic peak position). The solid line with Ω= ΩΛ + Ωm
corresponds to a flat universe; points to the right of that line correspond to a closed universe.

ment of the Hubble constant by, for example, Riess et al. (2011) of H= .± ., the limits

6.3 The Matter Content of the Universe
Given the interpretation of a flat universe, we turn to the matter and energy content required to
produce Ω= .+.
−.. The acoustic peak spectrum is sensitive to both the total matterden-
sity, Ωm, and separately to the baryonic matter density, Ωb. The sensitivity to both arises because

660 13
Cosmic Microwave Background
the total matter density acts as a driving term to the acoustic oscillations, while the baryons –
which participate in the oscillations – act as a small drag term. The odd and even harmonics in
the acoustic spectrum correspond to modes that froze out at maximum compression and maxi-
mum rarefaction, respectively. Because of baryon drag, there is a small asymmetry between the
compression and rarefaction in the BAO, which gives rise to a feature in the CMB power spec-
trum, namely that the even peaks will be suppressed relative to the odd ones as the fractional
contribution of baryons to the total matter density, Ωb/Ωm, is increased.
If one restricts the cosmological model parameter space to the six parameters of the flat
ΛCDM model: the physical baryon density, Ωbh; the physical cold dark matter density, Ωch;
the cosmological constant in units of the critical density, ΩΛ; the slope of the primordial power
spectrum, ns; the optical depth ofthe reionized medium, τ; and the overall amplitude ofthe fluc-
tuations, A, the 7-year WMAP data alone gives the following constraints on the matter densities:
Ωbh= .± .and Ωch= .± ., corresponding to Ωb = .± .
and Ωc = .± .(Larson et al. 2011). If one combines WMAP with SPT data, the con-
straints tighten by 15–25% to Ωbh= .± .and Ωch= .± .(Keisler et al.
2011).
Reducing the uncertainty on Ωm is of interest for future tests of physics beyond the standard
ΛCDM model since the matter abundance is coupled to CMB probes of neutrino physics and
to the details of how dark energy affects the expansion history of the universe. The current
uncertainty in Ωm is dominated by uncertainty in the amplitude of the third acoustic peak,
which is still limited by noise in the WMAP data, and by calibration uncertainty in the SPT and
ACT data. The Planck satellite should produce a cosmic variance limited measurement of the
third acoustic peak which will substantially improve the uncertainty in our knowledge of this
key parameter.
6.4 The Age of the Universe
Given the assumption of a flat universe and the above determination of the matter and energy
content (which explicitly assumes that ΩΛ = −Ωm, ignoring the negligible present-day radi-
ation density), we can derive the age of the universe by solving the Friedmann equations for
the expansion history. The age is interpreted to be the elapsed time since a(t) = (i.e., the “Big
Bang”). This procedure alsopredicts the present-dayexpansion rate, ˙a from which we can derive
the Hubble constant, H≡(˙a/a), where the subscript 0 means evaluated at the present time.
For the 7-year WMAP data, the age of the universe is determined to better than 1% preci-
sion: t= .±.Gyr, with a predicted Hubble constant of H= .+.
−.km s−Mpc−. The
latter is in good agreement with the independently determined (Riess et al. 2011) value noted
above, H= .± .km s−Mpc−. If we relax the assumption of flatness, but invoke the
independent Hubble constant measurement to constrain the Friedmann solution, we derive a
consistent age with an uncertainty of just under 2%, t= .±.Gyr (Komatsu et al. 2011).
Note that these results assume that dark energy has the form of a cosmological constant.
If the dark energy equation of state has a more “exotic” form that makes dark energy more
significant in the early universe (as a fraction of the total energy density), the expansion history,
and hence the age of the universe, could be somewhatdifferent than the ΛCDM model predicts.
There is currently no evidence to support such a model, but it cannot presently be ruled out.

6.5 Initial Conditions: The Inﬂationary Parameters
The inflation mechanism (Guth 1981; Linde 1982; Albrecht and Steinhardt 1982; Sato 1981)
was proposed to resolve a number of problems with the “classical” Big-Bang Model. The main
problems were the following: (1) “The monopole problem.” In Grand Unified theories, there
should be a sea of magnetic monopoles in the universe. None have been observed. (2) “The
flatness problem.” A slight deviation from flatness in the early universe is amplified by the cos-
mic expansion. The universe is so close to being flat today (>Sect. 6.2) that there seems to have
been some kind offine tuning at work tomake the earlyuniverse extremelyflat. (3)“The horizon
problem.” Two regions on the sky separated by more than θh = .○at the time of decoupling
are causally disconnected given the standard expansion history. Yet the CMB is isotropic to a
part in , implying that our entire observable universe evolved from a region that was once
in thermal equilibrium, and thus in causal contact. Inflation resolves these problems by postu-
lating a period of accelerated (likely exponential) expansion in the very early universe, possibly
associated with a symmetry-breaking phase transition when the temperature of the universe
was at the scale of grand unification, T ∼GeV, t ∼−s.
Inflation solves the above three problems as follows: if inflation takes place after the pro-
duction of magnetic monopoles, their abundance will be diluted to negligible levels. Similarly,
curvature decreases during accelerated expansion; if the overall growth factor experience dur-
ing inflation is sufficient, the curvature will be reduced to negligible levels. Finally, during a
period of acceleratedexpansion, the horizon becomes much larger than was previously inferred
from “classical” decelerating expansion. In order for inflation to quantitatively solve these three
problems, the universe must have inflated by a factor of at least 50–60 e-folds in the scale fac-
tor. This implies that the current energy density of the universe should be within about one
part in of the critical density, ρc = H/πG. It will likely be a while before this level of
measurement precision is reached.
A remarkable prediction of inflation is that all structure in the universe todaywas ultimately
a product of quantum mechanical fluctuations in the microscopic preinflationary universe.
During inflation, these fluctuations became “classical” density fluctuations on astrophysical
length scales, and they subsequently evolved into the web of cosmic structure we observe today.
The simplest physical models of inflation are driven by a single scalar “inflaton” field, and
these models predict that the density fluctuations should be Gaussian distributed with random
phases. In particular, if we have a density fluctuation field δ(x), and we Fourier transform it,
δ(x) ≡ρ(x)
¯ρ
−= ∫dk δ(k) eik⋅x,
(13.8)
then the Fourier modes are Gaussian distributed with variance,
⟨δ(k)δ(k′)⟩= π
kδ(k −k′)P(k),
(13.9)
where P(k) is the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations. Single-field inflation
models predict that the primordial spectrum should be well approximated by a power law over
the range of scales we can observe with cosmic structure, P(k) ∝kns−, where ns is the spectral
index of the fluctuation spectrum. Note that P(k) gives the variance of fluctuations as a func-
tion of wave vector, k, which is roughly equivalent to angular scale on the fixed surface of last
scattering.

662 13
Cosmic Microwave Background
Inflation further predicts the slope or “tilt” of the primordial power spectrum, as measured
by ns (Mukhanov and Chibisov 1981; Hawking 1982; Guth and Pi 1982; Starobinsky 1982;
Bardeen et al. 1983).2 As inflation proceeds, the inflaton potential energy and P(k) decrease
with time. Since the largest length scales inflate past the horizon first and “freeze out,” the pri-
mordial spectrum is generically expected to have a “red” tilt, meaning that large scales should
have a slightly higher primordial variance than small scales, that is, ns < .
CMB data now indicate that the P(k) is indeed lower at smaller scales. The 7-year WMAP
data gives ns = .± .. The smaller scale SPT and ACT data expand the lever arm of
physical scales over which to fit the primordial slope and give even more precise constraints.
For example, the combination of WMAP and SPT gives ns = .±.. This is an amazing
observation. Before inflation, Harrison, Peebles, and Zel’dovich posited ns = on the grounds
of naturalness. Today, all indications are that ns is less than unity at the σ level, which points
to the need for a detailed physical model for the origin of fluctuations. Inflation provides one
such class of models, which can now be put to the test with data. The idea that we can think of
testing physics at the energy scales implied by inflation is nothing short of incredible.
Limits on deviations from a power law, as measured by the running index parameter,
α = dns/d ln k (Kosowsky and Turner 1995), show that α is within σ of zero.
Many models of inflation predict that there should be a background of primordial gravita-
tional waves: propagating perturbations in space-time. In contrast todensityfluctuations, which
are associated with scalar perturbations in the space-time metric, gravity waves are associated
with tensor perturbations. Single-field inflation models robustly predict that the amplitude of
the gravity wave background is proportional to the energy scale at which inflation occurred
(Baumann et al. 2009):
Pt(k) =

π
V
M
pl
∣

,
(13.10)
where Pt(k) is the power spectrum of tensor perturbations (analogous to the density perturba-
tion spectrum noted above), V is the energy scale of inflation, and H is the Hubble parameter
during inflation.3 The detection of primordial B-modes would impact far more than just cos-
mology. It would be the first example of an empirical connection between gravity and quantum
field theory.
Observationally, the amplitude of the gravity wave background is parameterized by the
“tensor to scalar” ratio,
r ≡Pt(k)
Ps(k)∣
k=.Mpc−
,
(13.11)
which is simply the ratio of tensor to scalar power spectra, evaluated at a particular wave-
length. Both types of perturbations contribute to temperature anisotropy in the CMB, via the
Sachs-Wolfe effect, but their relative contributions as a function of physical or angular scale are
different, so they can be roughly distinguished on the basis of features in the temperature power
spectrum. The current limit on r from CMB temperature measurements is r ≲.(95% cl)
(Komatsu et al. 2011; Dunkley et al. 2011; Keisler et al. 2011). >Figure 13-25 shows the joint
constraints on ns and r from the 7-year WMAP data. In the limit that r ≲., the contri-
bution of tensors to the temperature fluctuations becomes so small that they negligibly affect
2This prediction is not unique; for example, the cyclic model (Khoury et al. 2003) makes a similar prediction.
3Cyclic models predict no gravitational waves, and thus, if the waves are detected, these models will be ruled
out.

the power spectrum. Consequently, we need another channel for probing a weak gravitational
wave background. Fortunately, there appears to be such a channel in the CMB polarization
anisotropy.
6.6 Gravitational Waves and CMB Polarization
As noted above, both scalar and tensor perturbations contribute to temperature anisotropy in
the CMB, via the Sachs-Wolfe effect. They both also contribute to polarization anisotropy in the
CMB via Thomson scattering. However, the scalar symmetry of density perturbations restricts
the polarization field these modes can produce. To understand this better, recall that polariza-
tion is a spin-2 field: any given pixel on the sky is characterized by a polarized amplitude and
direction, the latter of which is invariant to rotations by 180○.4 Two degrees of freedom are
required to describe linear polarization, the most common of which are the two Stokes param-
eters Q and U (Hanany et al. 2012). In analogy to vector fields, which can be decomposed
into gradient and curl components, an arbitrary polarization field can also be decomposed
into so-called E-mode and B-mode components (Kamionkowski et al. 1997; Zaldarriaga and
Seljak 1997). The symmetry of the scalar perturbations guarantees that they can only produce
the gradient-like E-mode polarization. Thus, B-mode polarization provides a unique probe of
propagating gravity waves at the epoch of recombination.
Since tensor perturbations are subdominant to scalar perturbations (see above) and since
tensor perturbations can produce both E-mode and B-mode polarization, while scalars produce
4We specifically consider linear polarization here. Some astrophysical sources produce circular polarization,
but we do not address those.

Recent measurements of the CMB polarization at medium to large angular scales. The top line

well measured. The data are from WMAP (diamonds, Larson et al. (2011)), QUaD (triangles, Brown
et al. (2009)), BICEP (asterisks, Chiang et al. (2010)), and QUIET (squares, QUIET Collaboration et al.
(2011)). Primordial B-modespectra areshown asdashedlines for diﬀerent levelsof primordial grav-
itational wave amplitude, r. The topcurve r = 0.2 is disfavored at the 95% conﬁdence level. The two
peaks arise from reionization (l ≈5) and decoupling (l ≈100). The dotted line shows the B-mode
spectrum induced by gravitational lensing of the primordial E-mode spectrum (top). The lensing
signal is comparable to or larger than the r = 0.02 primordial spectrum for l > 20 and will be chal-
lenging to separate. Polarized foreground emission is not shown. Thus far, there is no detection of
B-mode polarization in the CMB (The ﬁgure is from Katayama and Komatsu (2011))
only E-mode, it follows that B-mode polarization will be subdominant everywhere in the CMB.
This makes them challenging to detect, but the rewards of doing so are high. At large angular
scales, B-modes are produced by primordial gravitational waves. At all angular scales, they are
produced by the gravitational lensing of E-mode polarization (Zaldarriaga and Seljak 1998).
Lensing has the effect of displacing polarization “arrows,” which contaminates the symmetry of
the E-mode signal induced by scalar perturbations at the surface of last scattering. We discuss
these two phenomena in more detail below. > Figure 13-26 shows the E-mode and B-mode
power spectra predicted and measured on medium to large angular scales.
As of this writing, there has been no observation of a significant B-mode signal in the CMB
polarization anisotropy. The best direct limit on B-modes comes from the BICEP team, r < .
(95% cl) (Chiang et al. 2010).
6.7 Building on the Standard Model
The standard ΛCDM model of cosmology, a flat, expanding universe dominated by dark matter
and dark energy, with a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations, has been been
around for roughly a decade. Observations that support the model have been made over a wide

Cosmic Microwave Background 13
665
range of redshifts and wavelengths using many different cosmological observables, beyond just
the CMB. To date, there are no observations in serious disagreement with the model. This is a
remarkable state of affairs.
With the standard model as a foundation, there are many aspects of the model that remain
to be understood. Did inflation occur in the very early universe? If so, what is the physical
mechanism driving it? Is it related to spontaneous symmetry breaking? The most promising
observational probes of inflation still reside in the CMB in the form of searches for B-mode
polarization and non-Gaussianity in the temperature fluctuations. What is the nature of the
dark energy that is driving the current acceleration of the universe? Present observations sug-
gest a “vanilla” cosmological constant, but physicists are at a loss to understand its observed
amplitude: they predict its natural value should be times higher than observed! Future
observations of the expansion history of the universe may point to something other than a
cosmological constant. What is the physics and astrophysics of cosmic structure formation?
The former appear to be deeply tied to the physics of inflation; searches for primordial non-
Gaussianity may be fruitful in this regard. Understanding the astrophysics is a key element of
understanding how we came to be, and it may hold further clues about the nature of the dark
matter.
On a different front, one may use the CMB to measure the amount of helium in the universe
at the time of decoupling. This can be compared to the amount predicted by Big Bang nucle-
osynthesis at z ∼and to the abundance observed today. Making sure these pieces of the
puzzle fit together is an important step in cementing our understanding of Big Bang cosmology.
And on yet another front, new measurements of the CMB hold the potential to constrain the
sum of the neutrino masses. As discussed below, gravitational lensing of the CMB is providing
a powerful new tool for probing the physics of our universe. There is much more to be done.

Anisotropy and Polarization Measurement Frontiers
The WMAP satelliteis cosmic variance limited up to ℓ= , and the Planck satelliteis expected
to be cosmic variance limited up to ℓ≈,as discussed above. In other words, assuming
that the foregrounds have been properly accounted for and that any form of non-Gaussianity
is negligible, all the information that can be extracted from the temperature anisotropy alone
up to ℓ= ,will be present in the Planck maps. Planck will also measure the so-called
E-mode polarization in the CMB and be cosmic variance limited on them to ℓ≈,.
The primordial B-modes are another independent observable that have yet to be detected. As
we discuss below, there is at least one known cosmic source of non-Gaussianity. The source
is the gravitational lensing of the CMB. Thus, there is an immediate motivation for push-
ing below the cosmic variance limit. In addition, there may be some form of primordial
non-Gaussianity. Its detection would have a dramatic impact on our knowledge of how the
universe began.
The two frontiers in the Planck era are the search for the large angular scale B-modes and
the polarization and temperatureanisotropies at fine angular scales, beyond Planck’s resolution.
It will be quite some time before the full skyis mapped again at Planck-like resolution with better
sensitivity.

666 13
Cosmic Microwave Background
7.1 Large Angular Scale B-mode Experiments
Gravitational waves, as observed through the B-mode polarization, are a pristine probe of the
early universe. This can be appreciated as follows: Quantum fluctuations in the primordial fields
give rise to both scalar modes (variations in density as a function of position) and tensor modes
(variations in strain – gravitational waves – as a function of position). Both scalar and ten-
sor modes produce temperature and E-mode polarization anisotropies, but only tensor modes
produce the B-mode polarization. Thus, the B-mode is distinctive. Although the gravitational
waves are revealed to us through Thomson scattering off free electrons, they are unaffected by
any cosmic process other than the expansion of the universe. They come to us directly from the
inflation epoch.
Outside of experimental sensitivity, there are two astrophysics limitations to measuring
B-modes. First, gravitational lensing of the E-mode signal masks the primordial B-mode signal
for ℓ> as seen in >Fig. 13-26. At ℓ∼, the lensed signal corresponds to r ∼.. While it
is possible to subtract the lensing, one pays a price in signal to noise. Secondly, the ultimate limit
will be set by galactic foreground emission (Bock et al. 2006). Fortunately, models suggest that
in the low-dust/low-synchrotron regions of sky, (Dunkley et al. 2009) we may reach r ≈.at
150 GHz before foregrounds become a limitation. At the largest angular scales, ℓ≲, polarized
foreground emission dominates an r ∼.signal by over an order of magnitude (Page et al.
2007; Gold et al. 2011).
Measuring B-modes is challenging. Our confidence in any detection will be bolstered by
multiple levels of redundancy, internal cross-checks, and agreement among experiments. The
ability to identify and control systematic errors will ultimately determine the best approach
(or approaches), which is not yet known. The set of experiments in >Table 13-2, a snapshot of
the current efforts focused on large angular scales, cover a wide range of technique.

7.2 Small-Scale Anisotropy, ℓ> 2,000
Precise measurements of the small-scale anisotropy, ℓ> ,, are a new frontier for CMB
studies and a critical complement to the Planck satellite. Because of dramatic advances in
detector and receiver technology, much of it driven by CMB-experimentalists, the sky is now
being observed with arcminute-level resolution with cryogenic arrays of thousands of detec-
tors. Thousands of square degrees of sky are being mapped with sensitivities measured in tens
of microKelvin per square arcminute with special purpose telescopes: the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT, Fowler et al. (2007) and Swetz et al. (2011)), located in Chile, and the South
Pole Telescope (SPT, Ruhl et al. (2004) and Carlstrom et al. (2011)). Soon these receivers will be
polarization sensitive. Additional instruments with a range of resolutions (e.g., POLARBEAR,
The Polarbear Collaboration et al. (2010), POLAR-1, Kou, 2012, private communication) will
soon come on line as well. In the not-too-distant future, one expects an order-of-magnitude
improvement over current sensitivities.
The scientific questions that can be addressed with these measurements include: (1) What
is the scalar spectral index and to what degree is its determination contaminated by foreground
emission? (2) What is the sum of the neutrino masses and are there more than three relativistic
species in the early universe? (3) Did the dark energy act differently before z = ? (4) Where
are the missing baryons? Big Bang nucleosynthesis and CMB-derived baryon densities are not
in accord with the observational census. (5) Did the early universe have only Gaussian fluctua-
tions? The discovery of primordial non-Gaussianity, perhaps from cosmic strings or multifield
inflation, would revolutionize cosmology. (6) How did the universe evolve and how did cos-
mic structure form? Are there cluster of galaxies so massive and distant that they challenge the
Lambda-dominated cold-dark-matter model of the universe?
The questions are addressed by investigating the CMB in a number of ways. For example, at
small angular scales, one may think of the CMB as a backlight with precisely known statistical
properties at a precisely known distance. This light is affected by structure between us and the
decoupling surface. In the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) effect, for example, the hot electrons in
galactic clusters reveal their presence by scattering the CMB with a characteristic frequency
signature. In another mechanism, mass concentrations throughout the universe gravitationally
lens the CMB. This lensing can be determined by examining the correlations it imposes on the
CMB. Through a rich set of lensing cross-correlations with other X-ray, optical, mm-wave, and
radio surveys, we can probe the formation of structure. Through yet another mechanism, we
can observe the decoupling process with the CMB polarization.
At angular scales corresponding to ℓ< ,the anisotropy may be thought of as a direct
probe of the response of the CMB to perturbations laid down in the early universe as seen at the
decoupling surface at z = ,. The fluctuations are a part in of the background and thus
well described with linear perturbation theory. The predictions for the CMB power spectrum
may be computed with exquisite accuracy. The agreement between detailed predictions and
precise measurements is the foundation for our faith in the standard model of cosmology as
discussed above.
As one moves to finer angular scales, new phenomena are evident as shown in >Fig. 13-22.
In the structure formation process, aggregations of dark matter result in the formation of
clusters of galaxies and galaxies. At 150 GHz, after accounting for discrete radio sources, the
dominant term in the power spectrum is due to confusion noise from unresolved dusty star-
forming galaxies (DSFGs). They formed at redshifts between z ∼1–4 and carpet the sky. Their
contribution can be minimized by observing at lower frequencies but at some point a similar
background from unresolved radio sources becomes important. The DSFGs are generally

described by a Poisson distribution, that is with Cℓis independent of ℓ, although there are cor-
relations and clumping which lead to departures from this simple scaling (Bond 1996; Scott and
White 1999; Viero et al. 2009; Hall et al. 2010; Addison et al. 2012).
Subdominant to the CMB and DSFGs at 150 GHz is the power spectrum from galactic clus-
ters due to the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) effects. There are two contributions. One is from the
thermal effect in which the –K gas in clusters inverse Compton scatters CMB photons
producing a unique frequency spectrum. When the cluster is viewed against the CMB, T < Tcmb
for frequencies below 220 GHz, and T > Tcmb at higher temperatures. This effect was first
observed in Birkinshaw et al. (1984). The second effect is from the Doppler shift of the CMB by
the peculiar velocity of the cluster. In effect, the clusters act as moving mirrors. This effect was
first observed by Hand et al. (2012) through stacking CMB measurements on the positions of
many clusters.
Clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects. The clusters that contribute to the
power spectrum are being detected in blind surveys (Staniszewski et al. 2009; Hincks et al.
2010; Planck Collaboration et al. 2011b). They have masses greater than a few M⊙. How-
ever, roughly 50% of the amplitude comes from clusters with masses less than × which
will be difficult to detect in blind surveys. The SZ power spectra are produced from large simu-
lations. The physical processes that determine the overall amplitude are all “sub grid” and must
be modeled. Identifying the best description of clusters that explains X-ray, SZ, and optical data
is an active area of research.
The SZ signal is approximately independent of redshift, and so clusters can be observed to
great distances. The gas temperature goes as the depth of the gravitational well that led to the
cluster formation and is nearly redshift independent. At high redshift, the cluster would naively
appear dimmer, but back then the CMB was hotter and this compensates for the greater dis-
tance. Their mass function, dN(> M)/dM, that is, number distribution as a function of mass,
is a sensitive probe of cosmology. Currently, the limiting factor for using clusters as cosmolog-
ical probes is determining a precise mass. A typical error on the mass is 15%. Looking ahead,
one anticipates the detection of over clusters through their X-ray signature and roughly 
clusters through their SZ signature. We can think of clusters as beacons positioned in a manner
that lets us investigate the evolution of space-time. This will lead to a powerful check of the
standard cosmological model and will undoubtedly tell us more about how cosmic structure
forms and about the role of various cosmic constituents.
In the following sections we discuss three aspects of the small-scale anisotropy that will
become increasingly important in the next few years. We discuss polarization and lensing, new
modalities for CMB observations, and what we might learn from them. We conclude with a
discussion of assessing the sum of neutrino masses through observations of the CMB.
7.2.1 Small Angular Scale Polarization
The CMB polarization is produced by different mechanisms than the temperature anisotropy
and thus is sensitive to different physical processes. At small angular scale, the polarization
probes the evolution of the decoupling. The polarization was predicted by Rees (1968) and
Basko and Polnarev (1980) and first measured by Kovac et al. (2002). The signal is generated by
Thomson scattering of a local quadrupolar radiation pattern by free electrons. The scattering of
the same quadrupolar pattern in a direction perpendicular to the line of sight to the observer

has the effect of isotropizing the quadrupolar radiation field. The net polarization results from
a competition between these two effects. Basko and Polnarev (1980) show that the ratio of
the polarization anisotropy (Erms) to the temperature (Trms) signal in a flat cosmology is
given by

(13.12)
where τ(z) = cσT ∫
z
ne(z′)dz′(dt/dz′) is the optical depth. Here, σT is the Thomson cross
section, c is the speed of light, and ne is the free-electron density. Using a typical optical depth
(e.g., Peebles 1968b; Zel’dovich et al. 1969), one finds Erms ≈.Trms. The difference in brackets
in the numerator sets the range in z over which polarization is generated. For example, if the
decoupling epoch entailed an instantaneous transition from an extremely high optical depth
(τ >> ) to transparency (τ = ), there would be no polarization signal. Thus, the polarization is
produced at a particular time. In contrast, the processes that lead to the temperature anisotropy
take place over a much longer time.
At decoupling, the polarization producing quadrupole results from velocity gradients in the
flow of the primordial plasma. More specifically, in the rest frame of an electron in such a flow,
the radiation background has a quadrupolar pattern proportional to the velocity gradient, ∇⃗v,
and the mean free path between scatterings, λ. Just before decoupling, z > zdec, the photons are
tightly coupled to the electrons, and λ is small. Thus, the polarization is small. As decoupling
proceeds, λ increases and the quadrupole magnitude increases. The process is cut off at lower
redshift because the optical depth drops so rapidly. In the context of inflationary cosmology,
Harari and Zaldarriaga (1993) show that in Fourier space the polarization signal is ∝kvΔ,
where k is the wavevector and Δ ≈λ is the width of the last scattering surface.
>Figure 13-27 shows a snap shot of the ℓ> polarization spectrum along with predic-
tions for what Planck will measure. The plot also shows the levels achievable with the current
generation of polarization-sensitive experiments aimed at high ℓ. With E-mode polarization,
one may probe the damping tail more deeply than with temperature and therefore better mea-
sure ns. In addition, since the E-mode polarization arises from different physical processes,
alternative models can be tested. For example, current power spectrum data indicate that tem-
perature fluctuations are adiabatictowithin 9% and 2% foraxion and curvaton-type dark matter
(Komatsu et al. 2009; Sollom et al. 2009). Small-scale temperature and polarization data will
provide a new test of these alternative models.
As discussed above, our most direct probe of the infant universe is the scalar spectral index,
ns, and its change with scale. The formal accuracy on ns from the Planck satellite is 0.5%. How-
ever, our confidence in the result will depend on detailed knowledge of the transition from
the linear regime (primary CMB) to the nonlinear regime (secondary CMB). This transition
can only be measured through the fine-scale anisotropy. In addition, we will want to be certain
that ns is not being affected by foreground emission, point sources, or low levels of secondary
anisotropies. This is best done through the polarization.
The promise of the polarization as a new probe of cosmology is noteworthy. The CMB polar-
ization was first observed just a decade ago. Now it looks like the cleanest measure of the CMB
power spectrum over an appreciable range in ℓmay come not from the temperature but from
the polarization.

7.2.2 Lensing of the CMB
One of the forefronts of CMB observations is the lensing of the CMB by matter fluctuations
between us and the surface of last scattering. We see in many optical telescope images mag-
nificent pictures of distant galaxies being gravitationally lensed by a large cluster of galaxies
between us and the very distant galaxies. >Figure 13-28 shows an example. One thing to note
is that the lensed objects are highly distorted. They can be magnified and elongated.
For the CMB, one replaces the distant galaxies by the CMB itself, and instead of the inter-
vening galaxy, one has a universe full of matter fluctuations. The same power spectrum, P(k),
that gives rise to the temperature anisotropy also gives rise to the clumpiness of the universe
between us and the surface of last scattering. In place of seeing beautiful images of distorted
galaxies, the hot and cold spots in the CBM are subtly distorted but in such a manner as to not
change surface brightness.
CMB lensing is described in a number of seminal papers (e.g., Blanchard and Schneider
1987; Seljak 1996) and in several recent review articles (e.g., Lewis and Challinor 2006; Smith
et al. 2009). It is quantified as follows. When we measure the temperature at a given spot we find
T(n) = Tu(n + ⃗d(n)),
(13.13)
where Tu is the unlensed temperature distribution, n is the direction of the observation, and
⃗d is the deflection field transverse to the direction. The deflection field may be written as the
gradient of a potential, ⃗d = ∇nϕ. In turn, the lensing potential is related to the distribution of
the gravitational potential throughout the universe, Ψ, as
ϕ(n) = −∫

The distortion of the distant galaxies is clearly evident. Such a cluster also distorts the CMB
although the observations are not as dramatic
For CMB lensing, the source is fixed at the decoupling surface at a redshift of zdec. The quantity
D(z) is the comoving distance to an object at redshift z. Inside the large parentheses, one sees
the familiar expression for the geometry of an object at zdec being deflected by a lens at D(z).
The integral sums up contributions over Ψ, the source of the deflections. The power spectrum

the lensing power spectrum. For the power spectrum of the deflection angle, Cdd

>Figure 13-29 shows the lensing kernel, the integrand in ( > 13.15), as a function of the

because different values of ℓpick out different ranges of wavelengths k from the power spec-
trum PΨ(k = (ℓ+/)/D(z), z).Note that the kernel picks out a broad distribution at relatively
high z. This is why lensing is especially sensitive to the sum of neutrino masses and early time
dark energy.

For the CMB, the lensing distortion leads to a change in statistical distribution of the fluc-
tuations. Without lensing, the distribution of CMB temperature fluctuations is Gaussian, and
the phases are uncorrelated. Lensing correlates the phases, as is so evident in >Fig. 13-28, and
adds kurtosis (4-pt function) to the Gaussian. The source of the correlations may be seen in
( > 13.13). An expansion gives T(n) = Tu(n) + ∇Tu(n) ⃗d(n) + . . .. The second term is sig-
nificant when the CMB temperature gradients and deflections are large. From > Figs. 13-21
and >13-22 we see that the temperature gradients are high on the degree angular scales corre-
sponding to the first peak. These correspond to ℓ∼. From (> 13.14), one finds that the rms
deflection is roughly 2.5 arcmin. This angular scale corresponds to ℓ∼,. CMB lensing is
dominated by deflections of 2.5 arcmin that are coherent over degree angular scales. Thus, the
power spectrum of ℓCdd
ℓ
has a broad hump near ℓ= .
To observe lensing, one wants arcmin resolution maps of the CMB that have good statistical
properties at degree angular scales. Currently, the Planck, ACT, and SPT maps satisfy these cri-
teria. The connection between the CMB maps and the above is made with an optimal quadratic
estimator (Hu and Okamoto 2002; Das et al. 2011a):

where ℓand ℓ′ are for the high-resolution CMB maps, g is a filter that can be tuned to optimize
signal-to-noise, and N is a normalization. > Equation 13.17 manifestly shows that the conver-
gence power spectrum is related to the four-point function. The second term in brackets is the
Gaussian part of the four-point function. This must be subtracted from the full expression to
isolate the terms that are responsible for correlating the phases. The Gaussian part can be deter-
mined by randomizing the phases in the 2D transform of the map (Dvorkin and Smith 2009;
Hanson et al. 2011; Das et al. 2011a).

Lensing of the CMB was first clearly seen through a cross-correlation with radio galaxy
counts (Smith et al. 2007) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Hirata et al. 2008). There was also
∼σ evidence for it from the power spectrum of the CMB (Lueker et al. 2010; Das et al. 2011b).
The first detection that was rooted in the characteristic aspects of lensing of the CMB alone was
reported in Das et al. (2011a) and based on the ACT data. The lensing power spectrum, Cκκ,
was detected at 4σ. Next, van Engelen et al. (2012)) reported a more than σ detection of Cκκ
from the SPT. The results are shown in > Figs. 13-30 and >13-31.
CMB lensing is a new observational handle on the cosmos. The deflection field is a measure
of the effects of the matter fluctuations between us and the decoupling surface and thus probes
different physical processes than does the primary anisotropy. Thus, with lensing, one uses the
CMB to extract information about the volume of the universe and breaks the “geometric degen-
eracy” associated with the primary anisotropy. This is an exciting direction for observations of
the CMB. For example, it means that with only the CMB, we can determine the geometry of
the universe or, in other words, using only the CMB, one can deduce that there must be a dark-
energy term. Because the signal is intrinsically non-Gaussian, it also means that there is reason
to push beyond the cosmic variance limited measurements of the temperature anisotropy.
>Figure 13-32, adapted from Smith et al. (2009), shows the sensitivity of the lensing power
spectrum to various cosmological parameters of interest. To connect with the measurements
we just discussed, we examine curvature. At L ∼, the change in Cκκ
L with Ωk is −0.4. In
other words, to constrain Ωk to 25%, one must measure Cκκ
L to 0.1. This is roughly the size of
the error bars in >Fig. 13-30.
A number of studies have been made about how well one could do in principle on the
parameters to which lensing is particularly sensitive. A review based on a possible future satel-
lite mission is given in Smith et al. (2009). For an instrument with a resolution of 5 arcmin and
a sensitivity of 4 μK-arcmin (1σ noise of 4 μK for each 1 arcmin square pixel) over the full sky,
one can reach a σ sensitivity on the mass of the neutrino of 0.05 eV, on the equation of state
for early time dark energy of 0.15, and on Ωk of 0.0025. One obtains similar sensitivities by
observing a quarter of the sky with 2 arcmin resolution to a depth of 5 μK-arcmin. As a point of
reference, at 150 GHz the Planck satellite has a resolution of roughly 7 arcmin and is expected

The CMB lensing deflection field may also be correlated with the SZ effect, galaxy shear,
quasars, the LRGs, and a host of other phenomena to find the growth rate of structure. The
growth rate in turn is another probe of dark energy and the mass of the neutrino. CMB lensing
may be combined with many other cosmic probes. For example, when combined with the LSST
and Planck (e.g., Joudaki and Kaplinghat 2011), one may in principle determine the equation
of state of the early dark energy to better than a percent and curvature to 0.06%.
7.2.3 Neutrinos
The properties of neutrinos affect the appearance of the CMB. To be more precise, a weakly
interacting relativistic particle in the early universe can affect the CMB just as neutrinos would.
But because neutrinos exist, we associate them with this primordial constituent. There could
well be neutrinos plus additional weakly interacting relativistic particles, but for the purposes of
this chapter, we will lump them all together. Neutrinos affect the CMB through their response to
gravity. Thus, from the CMB we cannot tell that the particles are, for example, Dirac or Majorana
particles (the signature is the same for both) or even if they are spin 1/2. However, we can tell
the number of relativistic species and the sum of the neutrino masses. With the technologies
currently being developed, we will be able to determine the mass sum in multiple independent
ways to a level of roughly 0.06 eV, near the current lower limit set by atmospheric neutrino
oscillations.
Before getting into details, it is worth noting that neutrinos have been part of the cosmologi-
cal picture since the earliest days. Understanding them was critical to Big Bang nucleosynthesis.
At one point, hints of a 30 eV mass led many to consider them as a major cosmological
constituent. In 1972, Alex Szalay was a college student at the Eötvös University in Hungary.
Following the advice of Zel’dovich, he computed how one could find the neutrino mass from
cosmological observations as part of his undergraduate thesis. That year, the Neutrino ’72
conference meet in Balatonfüred, Hungary. Szalay’s work on neutrinos was presented at the
conference. After the conference, Feynman wrote him the note in >Fig. 13-33. His undergrad-
uate work grew into his Ph.D. thesis; computing the effect of neutrinos on density fluctuations
would later become Szalay and Marx (1976). The first link between the CMB and neutrino mass
was presented in Doroshkevich et al. (1981) and Bond and Szalay (1983).
First consider electron neutrinos. At a redshift of ∼, electrons,5 positrons, and photons
were strongly coupled through the reaction γ+γ ↔e++e−. In turn, the electrons and positrons
were coupled to the neutrinos through ν+ ¯ν ↔e+ +e−. All the particles were highly relativistic.
At these early times, the energy density in photons was σT
γ and that of neutrinos was (/) σT
ν
with Tν = Tγ and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The factor of 7/8 is from the integral over a
Fermi-Dirac distribution as opposed to a Bose-Einstein distribution. When the temperature of
the universe cooled to T ≈mec/k, or z ≈× , the vast majority of electrons and positrons
annihilated and dumped their energy into the photons. This increased the temperature of the
photons relative to the neutrinos by Tγ = (/)/Tν. Thus, today Tν = .K.
The neutrinos today are still distributed according to an orbital occupation number of nν =

e q/kTν+, where q = pac with p the relativistic momentum, Tν = .K, a the scale factor, and
5me c∼.MeV corresponds to T = × K.

676 13

⊡Fig. 13-33
Note from Richard Feynman to Alex Szalay inscribed inside Szalay’s copy of the Feynman lectures
the factor of 2 accounts for the two spin states. This occupation number does not change if the
neutrinos are massive. In other words, the occupation is set when they are highly relativistic.
Because the expansion of the universe is adiabatic, the neutrinos do not change orbitals as the
universe evolves.

In >Fig. 13-34, the distribution of the neutrino background (the integrand of ( > 13.17)) is
compared to that of the Planck distribution for the CMB. If mν = , then the energy density
as a function of momentum, p, is similar to that of the photons, but the peak is shifted to the
left because the neutrinos are slightly colder. In addition, the low momentum tail falls off more
quickly than for photons due to the “+” sign in the denominatorof nν as opposed to “−” sign for
photons. As the neutrino mass increases, the energy term in (>13.17) becomes independent of
q, and thus the low momentum tail of the distribution is proportional to q. The photons have

the same distribution at low momentum but for a different reason; here, the q dependence in
the denominator of the occupation number cancels the q in the energy dependence.
When thinking about neutrinos, the two most important times in cosmic evolution are
matter-radiaton equality and decoupling. In the the standard six-parameter, Λ-dominated flat
cosmology, these occur at zeq = ,and zdec = ,respectively (Komatsu et al. 2011). The
essential feature of zeq is that for z > zeq the expansion rate of the universe slows down and the
formation of cosmic structure can begin. Neutrinos, for any mass compatible with the data, act
relativistically at matter-radiation equality. By relativistic we mean kTν ≳mνc. >Figure 13-35
shows the energy density of various cosmic constituents as a function of scale factor of the
universe. For neutrinos, blue lines, this is simply ρ in (>13.17). The energy density in radiation
(the CMB) scales as /a, the energy density in matter scales as /a, and the energy density in
a cosmological constant is independent of a.
From >Fig. 13-35 we can gain an intuition for how neutrinos affect the CMB. First, let us
examine the number of relativistic species, Neff. We know there are three families of neutri-
nos, and so from particle physics, expect Neff = . In the cosmological context, we define Neff

The scaling of the cosmic constituents with scale factor a. Green is for CDM and baryons, blue is

like radiation before a ≈2 × 103 and like matter now. The mass corresponding to Tν = 1.95 K is
mν = 0.2 meV
Because the annihilation of e+ with e−does not result in all of the energy going into photons
alone, some goes to the neutrinos, and thus Neff = .in ( > 13.18) (Mangano et al. 2005;
Kneller and Steigman 2004). If Neff > ., then in >Fig. 13-35, the blue lines near zeq and zdec
are shifted up. As a result, zeq is closer to zdec. This means that prior to decoupling, the higher
Neff, the greater the expansion rate. This is a result of the fact that a radiation-dominated uni-
verse expands more rapidly than does a matter-dominated one. As pointed out in Bashinsky
and Seljak (2004) and Hou et al. (2011), this leads to increased Silk damping and thus a sup-
pression of the anisotropy at l > ,. An outline of the argument is as follows: the diffusion
scale of a photon, rd, scales as /
√
H, where H is the expansion parameter prior to decoupling.
If rd increases, there is more diffusion and thus more Silk damping. One way to view the scaling
(Hou et al. 2011) is that rd increased as t/as one would expect of diffusion. However, as H
increases, t decreases and rd decreases. For the CMB, the other key scale is the acoustic hori-
zon, rA = θADa with Da the angular diameter distance, and θA the angle. The quantity θA is
precisely determined by the ℓ< anisotropy data to be θA = .±.○(Komatsu et al.
2011). The sound horizon, rA, is essentially the sound speed multiplied by time and so scales as
/H. Since θA is so well constrained by the data, the relevant quantity is rd/rA which scales as
H. Thus, the more relativistic species there are, the larger H at the decoupling era and the larger
the damping scale relative to the acoustic scale. The result is more suppression of the l > ,
damping tail relative to the acoustic peaks.

Cosmic Microwave Background 13
679
The damping tail is also affected by the fraction of helium. The more helium, the more elec-
trons are bound up in atoms, the longer the diffusion length for a photon, and therefore the
greater the suppression of the CMB fluctuations. As a result, there is some degeneracy between
the primordial helium fraction and the number of relativistic species. The two effects, though,
can be separated (see, e.g., Jungman et al. 1996; Dunkley et al. 2011).
Massive neutrinos affect how we interpret the CMB in a number of ways. For example, for
all allowed mass sums (.< Σν < .eV), the neutrinos are nonrelativistic today and should
be counted as part of the matter budget as indicated on the right hand side of >Fig. 13-35.
However, for the same mass range, they are part of the radiation budget at decoupling. Thus, to
constrain the mass, one compares measures of the mass fluctuations at low redshift, for example,
with the σparameter, to the fluctuations that give rise to the CMB.
The mass of the neutrino also directly affects the acoustic peak structure and the growth rate
of structure. There are multiple effects at play as discussed in, for example, Dodelson et al. (1996)
and Ichikawa et al. (2005) (see also Hannestad and Brandbyge 2010). The driving concepts are
that at zdec the neutrino temperature is roughly 2,000 K corresponding to 0.1 eV, and so massive
neutrinos are in the process of becoming nonrelativistic. Also, while photons in the decoupling
epoch diffuse out of potential wells as they scatter off electrons, neutrinos free stream out of
potential wells as their interactions are minimal. The net effect is that the phase and amplitudes
of the acoustic peaks are slightly altered and that the more massive the neutrino, the greater the
suppression of the formation of cosmic structure at small scales.
This suppression of structure leads to a decrease in the CMB lensing signal as evident
in >Fig. 13-32. Note that this signal is based solely on CMB observations and does not depend
on additional measures of galaxy spectra or σ. As noted above, the signal can be extracted
from the non-Gaussianity of the CMB. Also note how characteristic the signal is in the lensing
spectrum. There is a second way to see the neutrino mass signature that offers a built-in cross
check. At high ℓ, B-mode polarization is produced by the gravitational lensing of the E-modes
(Zaldarriaga and Seljak 1998). This is the same mechanism that leads to a confounding astro-
physical signal at low ℓthat hides the primordial B-modes. It is convenient that in polarization
this region is relatively free of foreground emission. > Figure 13-36 shows the effect. If the
neutrino mass sum is 0.5 eV, the lensing B-mode signal is suppressed by roughly 25%.
7.3 The Future
There is still much to be learned from the CMB. The advantages of observing from space are so
strong that we should anticipate a future satellite mission. Space offers long uninterrupted peri-
ods of observation from a platform whose thermal stability can be measured in milliKelvin. This
combination enables a myriad of possible consistency checks for various systematic effects. The
history of the field is one of great advances made with ground-based and suborbital experiments
that then inform a satellite design. Detector sensitivities near 2 mm wavelength are approaching
levels where they will be limited by the photon noise from the CMB itself. Soon this will be the
case across the frequency band where the CMB dominates. We have learned how to produce
polarization-sensitive arrays of hundreds to thousands of detectors that are read out with low-
power superconducting electronics. There are no known impediments to even larger arrays.
Many groups are investigating new kinds of radiometers based on technologies ranging from
multimoded detectors and optics to multichroic detectors with broad-band optics. There are
advances with both bolometric and coherent systems. The field is dynamic. The instruments

The eﬀect of massive neutrinos on the CMB polarization spectrum. Matter ﬂuctuations between
us and the surface of last scattering lens the CMB. This can be detected directly in at least two
ways. One can isolate the non-Gaussian aspect part of the temperature anisotropy and extract
the B-mode signal from that. Another way is to measure B-modes that result from lensing of the
E-modes. This is a particularly clean signal near these wavelengths. This ﬁgure shows the diﬀer-
ence in the B-mode signal for neutrinos with a 0 mass sum and those with an 0.5 eV mass sum.
For comparison, the primordial B-mode signal with r = 0.2 is also shown. Current error bars on the
temperature anisotropy are near 1 μ K2, and so measuring the high-ℓB-modes is not far oﬀ
being developed define the forefront in receiver technology. We expect many more exciting
results over the coming years. However, as we probe ever deeper to search for more subtle
aspects of nature, a future space mission will be required.
Acknowledgments
It is a pleasure to acknowledge the work of our many colleagues who we have cited in this
work. Paul Richards, Rainer Weiss, and David Wilkinson were pioneers who showed many of
us the way to think and measure the CMB. Among living pioneers, Rashid Sunyaev and Jim
Peebles, among many others, worked out how the universe could or should be, long before
we were able to know that they were right. Pat Thaddeus initiated work on the COBE mis-
sion proposal, and Nancy Boggess at NASA Headquarters protected it from those who saw it
as only a physics experiment. Jens Chluba and Dale Fixsen read the spectrum portion of our

manuscript and made many useful comments. We thank Sudeep Das for useful comments and
for providing figures on CMB lensing. Shaul Hanany, Colin Hill, Bill Jones, Akito Kusaka, Avi
Loeb, and Suzanne Staggs made a number of helpful comments.
