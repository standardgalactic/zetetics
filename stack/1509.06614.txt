For a ﬁeld theory with a gravitational dual, following Susskind’s proposal we deﬁne holographic
complexity for a subsystem. The holographic complexity is proportional to the volume of a co-
dimension one time slice in the bulk geometry enclosed by the extremal co-dimension two hyper-
surface appearing in the computation of the holographic entanglement entropy. The proportionally
constant, up to a numerical order of one factor is GR where G is the Newton constant and R is the
curvature of the space time. We study this quantity in certain holographic models. We also explore
a possible relation between the deﬁned quantity and ﬁdelity appearing in quantum information
literature.

INTRODUCTION
AdS/CFT correspondence [1] as a concrete realization
of holographic principle [2, 3] could provide a framework
to study quantum gravity and black hole physics. On
the other hand theoretical quantum information may also
provide a useful tool to study physics of black holes in
gravitational theories. Therefore it would be interesting
or might even be crucial to understand quantum informa-
tion holographically, in the sense that for any quantity in
quantum information one could have a holographic dual
description.
Holographic entanglement entropy [4] is an explicit ex-
ample in this paradigm which is found useful to study
quantum entanglement that might be eventually used to
understand the nature of the space time geometry. In
quantum information there are other quantities, such as
n-partite information, which might be of interest from
holography point of view. Actually n-partite information
has been also studied holographically in recent years (see
e.g. [5]).
We note, however, that even if we could compute en-
tanglement entropy or in general n-partite information
(directly or holographically), it might not be enough to
fully understand the system under consideration quan-
tum mechanically. It is because no matter which entan-
glement measure is being computed, we may lose some
information of the system simply because the whole sys-
tem is not a sum of the subsystems.
Actually it was recently pointed out that in order to
understand properties of black hole horizons, it is also es-
sential to consider quantum complexity[6]. Suppose our
system is in a given state and we would like to map it to
another state. Then, intuitively, the complexity tells us
that how diﬃcult this task is. In fact, it was conjectured
that for an eternal black hole the complexity is propor-
tional to the spatial volume of the Einstein-Rosen bridge
connecting two boundaries [7].
Motivated by holographic entanglement entropy and
quantum complexity, in this paper we would like to
further explore a holographic description of complexity
within the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.
To proceed, let us consider a ﬁeld theory whose holo-
graphic dual may be provided by an Einstein gravity on
an asymptotically AdS geometry. In this context holo-
graphic entanglement entropy for a subsystem in the dual
ﬁeld theory can be computed by minimizing the area of
a co-dimension two hyper-surface in the bulk geometry.
More precisely, consider a subsystem A in a time slice
in the boundary theory. There is a minimal co-dimension
two hyper-surface in the bulk, denoted by γ(A), whose
boundary coincides with the boundary of the subsystem
∂γ = ∂A. Then the holographic entanglement entropy is
the area of the minimal surface divided by the Newton
constant[4]
SEE = Area(γ)
4G
.
(1)
Based on this prescription here is an observation. In-
deed the way the holographic entanglement entropy is
computed would naturally deﬁne, rather uniquely, an-
other quantity on the gravity side.
Actually the min-
imal hyper-surface considered above divides a constant
time slice into two parts, whose regularized volumes are
ﬁxed as soon as the minimal hyper-surface is determined.
Therefore beside its area, the volume enclosed by the
minimal hyper-surface may also deﬁne a new quantity.
To be precise, for a subsystem A in the boundary the-
ory, let us denote by V (γ) the volume of the part in the
bulk geometry enclosed by the minimal hyper-surface ap-
pearing in the computation of entanglement entropy. The
corresponding part also contains the subsystem A itself.
Then motivated by [6] one may deﬁne holographic com-
plexity as follows
CA = V (γ)
8πRG,
(2)
where R is the radius of the curvature of the space-time,
e.g. AdS radius. The numerical factor 8π is just a con-
ventional factor. Clearly the deﬁnition is ambiguous up

2
to an order of one numerical factor. It is also inherently
divergent and should be regularized by a UV cut oﬀ. Note
also that by deﬁnition
CA + C ¯
A ≤Vts,
(3)
where ¯A is the complement of A and Vts is the whole
regularized volume of the time slice. This inequality sat-
urates for the ground state1.
Here we have implicitly assumed that the background
is static, though there is a natural generalization for time
dependent geometries.
Indeed, following the covariant
conjecture of holographic entanglement entropy [8] in or-
der to deﬁne the corresponding holographic complexity
one should compute the volume of a part of the space
time enclosed by the extremal co-dimension two hyper-
surface appearing in the computation of the covariant
holographic entanglement entropy2.
It is worth noting that in the context of entanglement
renormalization [9] the entanglement entropy may be es-
timated by the minimum number of bonds cut along a
curve [10] which could be thought of as Ryu-Takayanagi
(RT) curve. Therefore, based on our deﬁnition of (2),
in this context the holographic complexity may be re-
lated (or estimated by) to the number of nods in the
area enclosed by the curve cutting the bonds. Such a re-
lation has also been suggested in [7]. Using a holographic
model, it might be possible to make this statement more
precise[11].
The aim of this paper is to examine the quantity de-
ﬁned in the equation (2) for a certain holographic model.
To be concrete we will consider a d + 1 dimensional CFT
in its ground state whose dual description is given by a
gravity on an AdSd+2 geometry. By making use of the
gravity dual we will compute the holographic complex-
ity. It is then natural to look for a proper quantity in
the ﬁeld theory, or in quantum information literature,
which could be identiﬁed as a holographic dual of the
holographic complexity. Actually we will argue that ﬁ-
delity deﬁned in quantum information might provide such
a dual quantity.
The paper is organized as follows.
In the next sec-
tion using an AdS geometry we will compute holographic
complexity for a subsystem in the form of a sphere in a
strongly coupled CFT. In section three we will compare
the results obtained in the section two with ﬁdelity de-
ﬁned for two states in a CFT. The last section is devoted
to discussions.
1 Note that one could also deﬁne another quantity in terms of the
volume as BA = Max{VA,V ¯
A}
8πRG
, which for the ground state one has
BA = B ¯
A. Here VA (V ¯
A) is the volume in the bulk associated to
the subsystem A ( ¯
A). Of course this is not the quantity we will
consider in this paper. I would like to thank K. Papadodimas
for a comment on this point.

Using the holographic description of mutual information, one
could obviously generalize the holographic complexity for multi
subsystems.

HOLOGRAPHIC COMPUTATIONS
Consider a gravitational theory on an AdSd+2 geome-
try which could provide a holographic dual for a d+1 di-
mensional strongly coupled CFT in its ground state. Us-
ing RT prescription [4] one may compute holographic en-
tanglement entropy for a sphere with radius ℓ. To do so,
it is more convenient to take the following parametriza-
tion for the AdS geometry
ds2 = R2
r2
 −dt2 + dr2 + dρ2 + ρ2dΩ2
d−1

.
(4)
Then the entangling region is given by t = ﬁxed, ρ ≤ℓ.
To compute the holographic entanglement entropy one
needs to minimize the area of a co-dimension two hyper-
surface in the bulk which may be parametrized by ρ =
f(r).
It is easy to see that the area is minimized for
f(r) =
√
ℓ2 −r2[4].
Following our proposal one needs to evaluate the vol-
ume enclosed by the above minimal area
V = Ωd−1Rd+1

where Ωd−1 is the volume of the unit sphere Sd−1 and
ε should be thought of as a UV cut oﬀ. It is easy to
perform the integration over r to ﬁnd the holographic
complexity. Indeed for even dimensional CFT’s (odd d
in our notation) one arrives at
CA=Ωd−1Rd

for d = 1, 3, 5, · · ·. Here [y] denotes the integer part of y.
On the other hand for odd dimensional CFT’s (even d )
one gets

for d = 2, 4, 6, respectively. It is interesting to note that
for odd dimensions the holographic complexity contains
a logarithmic divergent term.
It is also worth noting that the most divergent term in
the expression of holographic complexity is proportional
to the volume of the subsystem V (A)
CA =

leading to a volume law behavior. This should be thought
of as an analogous to the celebrated area law of the en-
tanglement entropy. Moreover for arbitrary d, the holo-
graphic complexity contains a universal term in the sense
that it is independent of the UV cut oﬀ.
For odd d
the universal term can be identiﬁed with the ﬁnite term,
while for even d it is given by the coeﬃcient of the log
divergence term

(9)
Note that the universal terms are also independent of the
size of the subsystem ℓ, indicating that it could reﬂect
certain intrinsic properties of the theory under consider-
ation. In fact it might be thought of as a central charge
for the model.
It is also interesting to compute the holographic com-
plexity for a subsystem in an excited state. Holographi-
cally an excited state may be described by an asymptot-
ically AdS geometry. To be concrete let us consider an
AdS black hole whose metric, adopted to our purpose,
may be written as follows
ds2 = R2
r2

−h(r)dt2 + dr2
h(r) + dρ2 + ρ2dΩ2
d−1

,
(10)
where h(r) = 1−mrd+1 with m being a constant. In this
case, similar to the pure AdS background, the minimal
hyper-surface in the bulk geometry (9) associated with
a sphere subsystem may be parametrized by ρ = f(r),
though in the present case the function f does not have
a closed simple form. Nonetheless one can ﬁnd the pro-
ﬁle of the minimal surface at leading order in m. More
precisely assuming mℓd+1 ≪1 one ﬁnds [12]
f(r) =

by

The volume enclosed by the minimal area is
V = Ωd−1Rd+1

(13)
The above integral can be evaluated order by order in m
and the result would be a function of the turning point
rt. On the other hand using the expression of the turning
point (12) one can re-write the holographic complexity as
a function of the radius ℓat leading order in m. Doing so,
in the present case unlike the entanglement entropy, one
ﬁnds that at leading order the holographic complexity
remains uncharged
CBH

(14)
In fact one could go further to evaluate the order of m2
term as well. Although the expressions are lengthy, the
ﬁnal result is simple, given by
∆CA = CBH

(15)
where cd is a calculable (non-negative) numerical con-
stant. For example one has c1 = 0, c2 =
1
128, · · · .
This result may be compared with that of the entan-
glement entropy where one ﬁnds that the variation of
entanglement entropy gets corrected at order of mℓd+1
[12, 13]
∆SEE = SBH
EE −SAdS
EE = ˜cd
Ωd−1Rd
G
 mℓd+1

(16)
leading to the ﬁrst law of entanglement[14]. Here ˜cd is a
numerical factor (see e.g. [12]). Note that ǫ = mℓd+1 is
the expanding parameter which measures how much the
ground state is deformed to the excited state. Taking into
account that in the present case the energy of the excited
state is proportional to E ∼
Rd
G mld, up to numerical
factors, one arrives at
∆SEE ∼Rd
G ǫ ∼Eℓ,
(17)
∆CA ∼(d −1)Rd
G ǫ2 ∼(d −1) G
Rd E2ℓ2,
i.e. while the change of entanglement entropy gets ﬁrst
order correction with respect to energy, the holographic
complexity receives second order correction.
Here we
have explicitly put the factor of d −1 to stress that for
d = 1 the correction vanishes.
Finally we should note that although we have done all
the computations for a subsystem with spherical sym-
metry, it could be done for other subsystem such as a
strip. An advantage to work with sphere is that we could
present the results analytically.
III.
FIDELITY AND HOLOGRAPHIC
COMPLEXITY
The complexity as deﬁned in [6] is a quantity to mea-
sure how diﬃcult a task is.
Given a quantum system
a task would be a unitary evolution to map a state to
another state.
In quantum information there are sev-
eral quantities which could provide measures to compare
two states. These include, for example, relative entropy
or ﬁdelity (see [16] for a holographic description of the
relative entropy). The aim of this section is to investi-
gate whether there is any connection between holographic
complexity and ﬁdelity.
To explore this point let us start with a quantum pure
state |Ψ(λ1)⟩in the Hilbert of a quantum system. Where
λ is a tunable parameter of the model. Now consider a

4
neighboring pure state |Ψ(λ2)⟩which may be reached
by changing, inﬁnitesimally, the parameter λ. It is then
natural to pose a question how close these two states
are? To address this question one could compute ﬁdelity
[17] which in the present case where both states are pure
it is given by the inner product of the two states. For
suﬃciently small perturbation δλ = λ2 −λ1 one has
|⟨Ψ(λ1)|Ψ(λ2)⟩| = 1 −Gλ δλ2 + O(δ3),
(18)
where Gλ is ﬁdelity susceptibility. This expression, con-
sidered as a metric (see e.g.
[18]), could measure the
distance between two neighboring quantum pure states.
Recently a gravity dual for information metric was pro-
posed in [15] where it was suggested that under certain
approximations the ﬁdelity susceptibility for a d + 1 di-
mensional CFT deformed by a marginal perturbation is
holographically given by the time slice with the maximal
volume in the AdS background which ends on the time
slice at the AdS boundary [15].
From our construction it is clear that within the same
approximations if one takes inﬁnite volume limit, the
holographic complexity reduces to the ﬁdelity suscepti-
bility Gλ as computed in [15]. In particular for a two
dimensional CFT from (6) one has
CA =
cℓ
12πε −c
24,
(19)
where c = 3R
2G is the central charge of the two dimensional
CFT. Clearly in the large ℓlimit it reduces to that in [15]
obtained from AdS Janus solution [19]. It is interesting
to note that the ﬁnite term in the above expression is pro-
portional to the Casimir energy of the two dimensional
CFT which typically appears whenever we are dealing
with a CFT in a ﬁnite volume. Note that the factor of
24 comes from our particular normalization of CA.
More generally for a d + 1 dimensional CFT one gets
CA|ℓ→∞=
V Rd
8πdGεd ,
(20)
where V is the volume of the time slice in the AdS geom-
etry. This is exactly the ﬁdelity susceptibility obtained
in [15] for an AdS background with a defect brane[20]
considered as a marginal deformation. It is important
to note that to get the right
1
εd behavior it is crucial to
deform the CFT by an exactly marginal operator [15].
In terms of the information metric Gλ the inequality (3)
reads CA + C ¯
A ≤Gλ.
Note also that the above comparison works just for
the extremely large ℓlimit. In other words there is, a
priori, no way to understand the subleading divergences
in this picture, nor it is not clear how to compare the
ﬁnite temperature case where the temperature dependent
term drops in the large ℓlimit.
Therefore although this comparison seems reasonable,
it is not quite clear to us whether there is a relation
between holographic information metric obtained in [15]
and the holographic complexity studied in this paper (or
that deﬁned in [6])3. Nonetheless it might be possible to
extend the notation of ﬁdelity susceptibility for a subsys-
tem with a ﬁnite size.
To explore this point better it is useful to write the
ﬁdelity in terms of a density metric. Denoting by ̺(λ1)
and ̺(λ2) the density matrices associated with two states
|Ψ(λ1)⟩and |Ψ(λ2)⟩respectively, the ﬁdelity can be writ-
ten as follows [17]
F = Tr
qp
̺(λ1) ̺(λ2)
p
̺(λ1),
(21)
which for pure states reduces to the inner product of the
states, |⟨Ψ(λ1)|Ψ(λ2)⟩|. On the other hand dealing with
a subsystem, it is natural to consider a reduced density
matrix and therefore deﬁne the ﬁdelity for two reduced
density matrices [21]
FA = TrA
qp
̺A(λ1) ̺A(λ2)
p
̺A(λ1),
(22)
where ̺A(λ1) and ̺A(λ2) are the corresponding reduced
density matrices. Now the aim is to expand the reduced
ﬁdelity for a small perturbation to ﬁnd an expression for
reduced ﬁdelity susceptibility.
To proceed, we will take advantage of having a subsys-
tem in the shape of a sphere. Actually when we have a
subsystem with spherical symmetry in the ground state
of a CFT, one may conformally map the system to a
thermal system whose temperature is given by the ra-
dius of the sphere; β = 2πℓ[22]. More precisely, under
this conformal map the reduced density matrix maps to
a thermal density matrix given by [22]
̺th(λ) =
e−2πℓHτ (λ)
Tr(e−2πℓHτ (λ)),
(23)
where Hτ is the standard Hamiltonian of the thermal
system which corresponds to the time translation. As a
result we will have to compute ﬁdelity at ﬁnite tempera-
ture. Fidelity for a mixed state at ﬁnite temperature has
been studied in [23] where the authors have considered
two possibilities; either to change the temperature while
keeping the parameter λ ﬁxed, or another way around.
In our model since we are dealing with a system with
a ﬁxed temperature (ﬁxed ℓ) the corresponding thermal
ﬁdelity should be given as follows [23]
F(2πℓ, λ1, λ2) = Tr
qp
̺th(λ1) ̺th(λ2)
p
̺th(λ1). (24)
Setting λ2 = λ1 + δλ, for suﬃciently small δλ and using
the deﬁnition of thermal density matrix in terms of the
Hamiltonian one gets [24]
F(2πℓ, λ1, λ2) = 1 −2πℓχλ
δλ2

+ O(δλ3),
(25)

where χλ = ∂2
λFth is the ﬁdelity susceptibility given in
terms of the free energy of the thermal system, Fth. If one
perturbs the system by an operator with dimension ∆,
then the ﬁdelity susceptibility scales as
Rd
ε2∆−2−d , where R
is a scale of the model (see e.g. [25]). Thus for a marginal
operator where ∆= d + 1 one gets χλ ∼(R/ε)d. On the
other hand the free energy and therefore susceptibilities
receive ﬁnite temperature corrections which have an ex-
pansion in power of T 2 (see e.g. [26]). Therefore for our
mixed thermal state, where the temperature is given by
T =
1
2πℓ, one arrives at
χλ ∼Rd


1 + c2

(26)
in qualitative agreement with our results in the previous
section.
It is also interesting to use the inverse of the confor-
mal map to return to the original picture of the reduced
density matrix. In fact doing so, one gets
FA = 1 −∂2
λF δλ2
8
+ O(δλ3),
(27)
where F(λ) = Tr(̺A(λ)H(λ)) −SEE(λ) with SEE be-
ing the entanglement entropy and, H(λ) is the modular
Hamiltonian by which the reduced density matrix may
be given as follows
̺A(λ) =
e−H(λ)
Tr(e−H(λ)).
(28)
Note that in terms of the modular Hamiltonian the ﬁ-
delity susceptibility χ = ∂2
λF is given by
χ = ⟨H2⟩−⟨H⟩2.
(29)
Since the explicit form of the modular Hamiltonian is
known for the subsystem we are considering[14], it would
be interesting to ﬁnd the ﬁdelity susceptibility directly
from the modular Hamiltonian. We are currently work-
ing on this line.

DISCUSSIONS
In this paper we have deﬁned and studied holographic
complexity for a subsystem in a CFT which has a holo-
graphic description. Motivated by the holographic en-
tanglement entropy, the corresponding quantity has been
deﬁned by the volume enclosed by the extremal co-
dimension two hyper-surface appearing in the computa-
tion of the holographic entanglement entropy.
We have also compared the holographic complexity of
the ground state of a CFT deformed by a marginal op-
erator with the reduced ﬁdelity susceptibility where we
have seen that these two quantities qualitatively behave
in a similar manner. We have also noticed that in large
volume limit the holographic complexity reduces to holo-
graphic information metric studied in [15].
It is also illustrative to apply the above suggestion
for the case of thermoﬁeld doubled CFT’s whose grav-
itation dual may be provided by an eternal black hole.
The entanglement entropy for this model has been stud-
ied in [27] where it was shown that the holographic en-
tanglement entropy is given by the area of an extremal
surface connecting two boundaries. Following the equa-
tion (2), one needs to compute the volume enclosed by
this extremal hyper-surface. Actually for this system the
complexity has been studied in [7] where it was shown
that the complexity is given by the spatial volume of the
Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting two boundaries.
It is worth mentioning that through the whole of this
paper we have implicitly assumed that the gravitational
theory is given by an Einstein gravity. It is then natu-
ral to ask how to deﬁne holographic complexity when we
have a gravitational theory with higher derivative terms?
Note that for this case the thermal entropy and holo-
graphic entanglement entropy are given by Wald entropy
and the generalized entropy functional (see e.g. [28]), re-
spectively. Therefore we would expect to have a general
expression (which is not necessary the volume) for the
holographic complexity as well.
Actually to address this question one needs to under-
stand two issues. First of all one should understand how
to specify the corresponding co-dimension two hyper-
surface in the bulk. And secondly, even when we have
ﬁxed a part of the time slice, what quantity should be
evaluated in this time slice?
In fact there is a natural proposal for holographic com-
plexity in a general gravitational theory which is as fol-
lows.
Consider the Wald charge appearing as the in-
tegrand in the Wald formula for entropy. Then evalu-
ate it on a co-dimension one time slice enclosed by a
co-dimension two hyper-surface minimizing the entropy
functional appearing in the computation of holographic
entanglement entropy. More explicitly
CA = −1
R
Z
enclosed volume
∂L
∂Rµνρσ
ǫµνǫρσ,
(30)
where ǫµν is binormal to the co-dimension two hyper-
surface enclosing the volume. Here the factor of 1
R comes
form a dimensional analysis and the fact that the only
natural dimensionfull parameter of the model is the cur-
vature radius of the space time.
In fact this factor
is the same as the extra R appearing in equation (2).
Clearly for Einstein gravity the above expression reduces
to the volume. On the other hand if one computes the
holographic complexity for a sphere in the most general
quadratic action
Z
dd+2x √g (α1RµνρσRµνρσ+α2RµνRµν+α3R2), (31)
then it gets corrected by an overall factor given by
4α1 + 2(d + 1)(α2 + (d + 2)α3).
Interestingly enough

6
it is exactly the factor which appears in the correction of
the entanglement entropy for a sphere. It is then natural
to think of the universal term of holographic complexity
as the central charge of the model (see also (19)).
Clearly this point deserves more investigations.
We
would like to mention that quantum complexity for a
general theory is extensively studied in [29]. Of course
it is not clear to us whether, for a generic case, there is
a direct relation between quantum complexity studied in
[29] and holographic complexity studied in the present
paper.
