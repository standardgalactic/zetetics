Geometrical intuitions spontaneously drive visuo-spatial reasoning in human adults, children and animals. Is 
their emergence intrinsically linked to visual experience, or does it reflect a core property of cognition shared 
across sensory modalities? To address this question, we tested the sensitivity of blind-from-birth adults to 
geometrical-invariants using a haptic deviant-figure detection task. Blind participants spontaneously used many 
geometric concepts such as parallelism, right angles and geometrical shapes to detect intruders in haptic displays, 
but experienced difficulties with symmetry and complex spatial transformations. Across items, their performance 
was highly correlated with that of sighted adults performing the same task in touch (blindfolded) and in vision, 
as well as with the performances of uneducated preschoolers and Amazonian adults. Our results support the 
existence of an amodal core-system of geometry that arises independently of visual experience. However, per­
formance at selecting geometric intruders was generally higher in the visual compared to the haptic modality, 
suggesting that sensory-specific spatial experience may play a role in refining the properties of this core-system of 
geometry.   
“In geometry, what is essential is invisible to the eye: it is only with the 
mind that one can see rightly” (Emmanuel Giroux, blind 
mathematician).
Philosophers have debated the emergence of geometric knowledge in
human cognition for centuries (Descartes, 1886;Kant, 1998;Plato, 2005): is
one born a geometric thinker or is such a skill a result of formal education? This
debate continues also in our times. For example, many studies consistently
documented that geometric properties such as parallelism, collinearity, or
curvilinearity play a crucial role in visual perception, because these properties
define special “non-accidental” configurations that drive visual percep­
tual and spatial grouping (Amir, Biederman, & Hayworth, 2012;Feld­
man, 1997, 2007;
J.Kubilius, Sleurs, & Wagemans, 2017;Todd, 
Weismantel, & Kallie, 2014;Van Gool, Moons, Pauwels, & Wagemans, 
1994;Wagemans, Lamote, & Van Gool, 1997). Beyond perceptual
mechanisms, several studies demonstrated that intuitions about geometry can
arise in humans in the absence of formal education, and some of them are even
shared with non-human species (Amir, Biederman, Herald, Shah, & Mintz, 
2014;Biederman, Yue, & Davidoff, 2009;Cheng & Newcombe, 2005;
Dehaene, Izard, Pica, & Spelke, 2006;Dillon, Huang, & Spelke, 2013;

Kayaert & Wagemans, 2010;Lourenco & Huttenlocher, 2008;Spelke & 
Lee, 2012). By using a visual deviant-figure detection task, some of these
studies showed that children and adults spontaneously detect a wide range of
geometric properties in visual displays (Fig. 1B): for example the topological
properties of closure and continuity, or the Euclidean properties of distance,
alignment, or parallelism (Dehaene et al., 2006;Spelke, Lee, & Izard, 
2010). Crucially, this was observed in two populations completely nave to

formal geometry, being devoid of geometric education, namely an Amazonian
group, the Mundurucu (Dehaene et al., 2006), and western preschool chil­
dren (Izard & Spelke, 2009). Specifically, although both Mundurucu and
western pre-school children detected geometric cues overall in fewer trials than
sighted educated adults, the performance of all three populations were highly
correlated across trials. This means that, independently of the group, all par­
ticipants successfully detected or failed to detect the geometric intruders in the
same trials. Thus, these findings suggest that basic geometric concepts are
built upon core intuitions of spatial reasoning that drive spatial exploration
behavior and shape perception, independently of formal education.
However, the role of visual experience in the development of this core-
system of geometry remains unclear. In his celebrated “Letter on the 
blind”, the French enlightenment philosopher Denis Diderot already 
used the example of Nicolas Saunderson, a first-rate mathematician who 
was blind since the age of one, to argue in favor of the abstractness and 
amodal (i.e., sensory-independent) character of mathematical knowl­
edge (Diderot, 1749). Initial empirical evidence supporting Diderot’s claim 
came from a seminal case study by Landau et al. which showed that a 
2½-year-old blind child spontaneously used angular relationships be­
tween objects while navigating (Landau, Gleitman, & Spelke, 1981).
Fig. 1. Methods. A. Example of a haptic trial. We created haptic sheets using the exact images of Dehaene et al.(Dehaene et al., 2006). Trials were engraved on a
transparency sheet positioned in front of the participants. On each trial, participants were asked to pick the shape that they considered the most different from all the others,
without any time constraints or feedback. B. Pictorial representation of all the trials of the deviant-figure detection task (Dehaene et al., 2006; V.Izard & Spelke, 2009).
Here, the trials are divided into seven geometric categories (e.g. Topology, Euclidean Geometry, etc.)(Dehaene et al., 2006; V.Izard & Spelke, 2009), but trial order was
randomized in the actual experiment. Each trial showed six figures that differed from each other in several features such as absolute orientation or size. Crucially, five of these figures
defined a specific geometric concept (indicated below each panel), whereas the sixth (surrounded in red) violated it. Average percent correct (with 95% confidence interval) is
shown for each of the 7 geometric categories (blind participants: blue bold; blindfolded sighted participants: black italic; sighted in vision: gray italic). For the haptic performance of
blind and sighted participants, average performance for each trial is also reported. Black asterisks depicts significance levels against chance (16.6%) using binomial test. (For

However, these results only address a limited range of geometric properties.
Moreover, in this study the authors limited their investigation to the use of
geometric cues during spatial navigation, while there is evidence suggesting
that geometric knowledge may differently influence navigation and shape
perception (Dillon et al., 2013;Spelke et al., 2010). To date, to the best of
our knowledge, a systematic investigation of the role of visual experience on
core geometric intuitions is still lacking: Does the emergence of core geometric
intuitions stem from the visual experience of space, or do those intuitions reflect
intrinsic properties of spatial cognition that are shared and consistent across
sensory modalities?
To answer this question, we created a haptic version of the visual deviant-
figure detection task previously used to test the perception of geometric
properties in the visual modality by Dehaene and colleagues (Dehaene et al., 
2006;Dillon et al., 2013;Izard & Spelke, 2009) (seeFig. 1A-B). In each
trial, 6 figures were presented. All these figures differed in several aspects, such
as for example in their size and/or orientation, but five of the figures shared a
geometric property which the 6th figure lacked (e.g. parallelism, symmetry;
seeFig. 1B for all properties). Participants were instructed to choose the figure
that they identified as the most different from all the others. Choosing the
geometric deviant-figure would show that participants detected the relevant
geometric property in spite of other types of spatial variations. Importantly,
each geometrical concept was tested only once, precluding learning or strategy
formation during the experiment itself.
We tested this haptic geometry task on a group of blind-from-birth par­
ticipants and a group of sighted blindfolded controls. To test consistency within
the responses of the blind participants, this group repeated the exact same
haptic deviant-figure detection task in a second, separate experimental session.
Sighted participants also participated in another experimental session in which
they were tested again in the same exact task, albeit in vision (see Methods).
With this design, we can perform several comparisons. First, we can
compare the performances of blind and sighted participants in touch. We can
also compare performance when the participants from each group are using
their dominant sensory modality for spatial exploration (touch and vision
respectively). This design allows us to investigate whether geometric cues are
used similarly across groups, and thus to what extent visual and haptic spatial
shape perception/exploration share the same properties. So far, the available
evidence with blind adults has yielded conflicting results. On one side, several
studies documented that blind people, when directly asked, can learn and are
able to correctly use various geometric concepts such as symmetry or mental
rotations (Bauer et al., 2015;Carpenter & Eisenberg, 1978;Cattaneo et al., 
2014, 2010;Marmor & Zaback, 1976;Occelli, Lacey, & Sathian, 2016).
These results show that blind adults can successfully acquire geometric foun­
dations via touch, but whether they use the same geometric intuitions as
sighted individuals to drive haptic spatial grouping and similarity judgments
remain an open question. Some studies, for instance, highlighted dif­
ferences between sighted and blind in spatial exploration strategies, 
with blind subjects preferentially activating an egocentric reference 
frame (self-to-object) and sighted subjects preferentially activating an 
allocentric one (objects-to-objects) (Chiesa, Schmidt, Tinti, & Cornoldi, 
2017;Iachini, Ruggiero, & Ruotolo, 2014;Pasqualotto & Proulx, 2012;
Pasqualotto, Spiller, Jansari, & Proulx, 2013;R¨oder, R¨osler, & Spence, 
2004;Ruggiero, Ruotolo, & Iachini, 2012;Schinazi, Thrash, & Chebat, 
2016). These differences might actually alter grouping strategies in the blind
population, ultimately giving rise to different spatial judgments compared to
the sighted population.
Secondly, this design allows us to compare performance in vision and touch
directly in the sighted population, and ask whether responses converge across
the two senses. To the best of our knowledge, geometric intuitions were never
investigated in the tactile modality in sighted adults for small, 2-dimensional
shapes. So far, studies on the properties of haptic space did not yet provide
conclusive evidence regarding the comparison with visual space, probably also
due to the fact that an in-depth investigation of the special configuration
classes (Feldman, 1997) driving haptic perception is still missing. Specifically,
some results suggest that visual and haptic spaces do share the same properties
with respect to spatial grouping (Haggard & Giovagnoli, 2011;Overvliet, 
Krampe, & Wagemans, 2012, 2013;Serino, Giovagnoli, de Vignemont, & 
Haggard, 2008;Verlaers, Wagemans, & Overvliet, 2015), while other re­
sults document differences in interpreting spatial relations among objects be­
tween the two sensory modalities (Cuijpers, Kappers, & Koenderink, 2003;
Kappers, 1999, 2003, 2004;Kappers & Koenderink, 1999).
Through our deviant-figure detection task, we presented participants with
a wide range of geometric concepts (Fig. 1B), thus allowing to extract per­
formance profiles and to evaluate the convergence and divergence of responses
across vision and touch. Observing similar patterns of performance (i.e., high
correlations between haptic and visual performances) irrespective of sensory
experience (blind vs. sighted) and of the sensory modality used (vision or
touch) would suggest the existence of an amodal core-system of geometry that
applies to small, 2-dimensional figures. Alternatively, observing different pat­
terns of performance between groups and/or sensory-inputs would suggest the
presence
of
two
distinct
systems
of
modality-specific
geometric
representations.
Finally, we used two different measures to examine the role of formal
geometric education on the performance of blind participants. First, at the end
of the whole experiment, we collected self-reports on the years blind partici­
pants were exposed to formal geometry education (see Methods). Second, we
compared the performance of our blind participants in touch with that of un­
educated Mundurucu adults (Dehaene et al., 2006) and pre-school children
performing the same task in vision (Izard & Spelke, 2009).
1. Methods
1.1. Participants
We tested eleven blind adults (four females; mean age 41.18 ± 9.8) in the 
haptic deviant-figure detection task. None of them had other known 
neurological diseases. Among them, nine were congenitally blind and 
two had minimal light perception only until very early in life, but have 
no visual memories nor form perception relevant to the task (see 
Table S1 for blind characteristics). The only exclusion criterion for our 
blind participants was that they should not present other sensory, 
physical or cognitive deficits. No participant was excluded based on 
these criteria. Eleven age- and gender-matched sighted adults were also 
tested (mean age 40.45 ± 12.15) and were blindfolded throughout the tactile
experiment. The Hebrew University’s ethics committee for research 
involving human subjects approved the experiment, and written 
informed-consent was obtained from each participant. Participants were 
reimbursed for their participation. 
1.2. Apparatus and stimuli
Experimental stimuli were identical to those used in previous visual studies
using the same exact task (Dehaene et al., 2006;Izard & Spelke, 2009).
However, we created a tactile version of all the stimuli in order to allow their
haptic exploration. Stimuli were drawn on transparency sheets using a specially
designed rubberized writing board (Sewell raised line drawing kit). In this way,
lines and shapes were engraved on the transparency sheet and could be
explored haptically by participants (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Movie S1). In
each trial (i.e., one transparency sheet), six different figures were presented. In
order to make clear borders between the six figures, each one of them was
embedded into a frame of a different texture (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Movie
S1). All figures forming a trial differed between each other in terms of several
spatial features such as absolute orientation or size. Five of these figures shared
a specific geometric property (e.g. quadrilaterals), while the sixth figure devi­
ated from it (e.g., triangle). The experiment consisted of 43 experimental trials
and 4 training trials (seeFig. 1B for all the trials). The 4 training trials aimed at
making sure that participants understood the task and were able to perceive all
the shapes in the haptic sheets (i.e., the raised lines were above the haptic
acuity threshold). These trials were built in the same way as the experimental
trials but did not test a geometric property (texture, orientation, numerosity
and orientation). The 43 experimental trials were divided in seven higher-order
categories defined in a previous study using the same paradigm in the visual
modality (Dehaene et al., 2006): Topology (e.g., connectedness, continuity,

closure), Euclidean Geometry (e.g., straight lines, alignment, parallelism),
Geometrical Figures (e.g., quadrilaterals, triangles, circle), Metric Properties
(distance and proportions), Chiral Figures (mirror images, rotated or not),
Symmetry Figures (complex figures in which the symmetry of shapes was
manipulated in the vertical, horizontal or oblique axes) and Geometrical
Transformations (spatial relations between two geometrical figures, such as
translations or rotations).
1.3. Procedure
Each participant was tested individually by the experimenter and was
instructed to freely explore all of the six figures presented in each trial, and
indicate the one he/she thought was the most different from all the others,
without any time constraints. Sighted participants were blindfolded throughout
the haptic experiment. Trial presentation was pseudo-randomized across par­
ticipants, such that trials testing similar concepts were not presented one after
the other. Before starting the experiment, all participants were presented with
4 training trials in which they received feedback on their responses. During the
experimental task, no response feedback was provided. Breaks were given
approximately every 10–15 trials for blind participants, every 4–9 trials for 
blindfolded sighted participants, or upon participant’s request. Blind 
participants completed the experimental session in ~60 minwhile sighted
blindfolded participants needed ~120 min to complete the task. For this 
reason, for sighted participants the full experimental session was divided 
into two parts that were completed within a time-interval of maximum 
24 h, whereas blind participants completed the whole experiment in one session
only.
In order to test the consistency of performance, a second experimental
session (i.e., repeating the whole experimental procedure) was carried out only
by blind participants, within a time-interval of 1–3 weeks (mean: 13.45 days, 
SE = 2.42) from the first session, depending on the participants’ avail­
ability. Finally, sighted participants came for an additional experimental 
session that was carried out after the previous session (3–84 days). 
During this session participants were not blindfolded and were asked to 
perform the exact same task, using the exact same stimuli engraved on 
transparency sheets which were now presented to them visually rather 
than haptically. For technical reasons, we could not analyze data from 
one participant, therefore results on vision are reported for 10 
participants. 
1.4. Assessing formal geometry education in blind participants
To exclude any effect of formal geometric education on the results of blind
participants, at the end of the second session, we asked participants to self-
declare how many years of formal geometry education they had received.
Specifically, we asked our blind participants to report until which age they
studied geometry in school. All participants were exempted at some point from
studying geometry before the end of high-school, and could only provide a
rough estimation on when exactly they were exempted. Thus, responses of
participants were divided into 3 categories and we assigned a categorical value
to each one of them: 0 if participants declared they had never studied geometry
(n = 1); 1 if participants declared they had studied geometry only at
elementary school (n = 4); and 2 if participants declared they had studied
geometry also in high-school until they were exempted (n = 6).
2. Results
2.1. Haptic deviant-figure detection task
Results from the haptic deviant-figure detection task show that blind-from-
birth participants identified the geometric deviant in most trials and categories.
Their overall performance was significantly above the chance level of 16.6%
(binomial test against chance:p-value <0.0001) and was comparable to the
overall performance of sighted but blindfolded participants (blind: average
48% ± 7% [95% confidence interval]; Sighted blindfolded: average 52% ± 6%;
Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 1B, both blind-from-birth and sighted blindfolded
participants selected the geometric deviant shape well above the chance level of
16.6% in the categories of topology (e.g., closure or connectedness), Euclidean
geometry (e.g., curvature, alignment of points to lines, parallelism) and
geometrical figures (e.g., quadrilateral, triangle, or circle). Both groups expe­
rienced more difficulties, but still achieved overall higher than chance perfor­
mance, in two other categories. With metric properties, participants mostly
successfully detected distance relations among separate elements of a given
figure, namely trials testing absolute distances (e.g. equidistance trial), but
failed in trials involving metric relations within the same shape, namely relative
distance trials (e.g., middle of segment; fixed proportions trials). In the chiral
figures category (i.e., distinguishing a shape from its mirror image), partici­
pants also performed above chance overall, but while both groups easily
identified the mirror image as the deviant in trials in which all the figures were
presented with fixed orientation (vertical axis trials), both had more difficulties
and mostly failed to spontaneously use chiral cues for the identification of the
deviant in trials in which the orientation differed between the stimuli (oblique
axes trials), thus requiring more complex mental rotations.
This remarkable performance did not extend to the categories testing
symmetrical figures (symmetry of figures in the horizontal, vertical or oblique
axis) and geometrical transformations (trials requiring the detection of spatial
relations between two geometrical figures, such as translation and rotation),
where both groups did not overcome chance level (seeFig. 1B for means and
single trials results).
We then directly compared the performance of blind-from-birth and sighted
blindfolded subjects when both used touch. Despite blind participants’ more 
extensive experience in haptic exploration, which was reflected by their 
much quicker overall response time to complete the task compared to 
the sighted blindfolded participants (average overall response time: 
Blind = 63.47 min; Sighted blindfolded = 118.86 min;p-value<0.001), a
Wilcoxon test showed no difference in overall accuracy between groups (W =
74.5, p-value <0.4;Fig. 2A). This result was further corroborated by a series
of Kruskal-Wallis tests showing that the performance of the two populations
did not significantly differ in any of the geometric categories (Fig. 2A; allp-
values>0.06). In addition, and importantly, the performance of blind and
sighted blindfolded participants was highly correlated across trials (Spearman
correlation, rho = 0.76; p-value <0.0001;Fig. 2B). Specifically,Fig. 2B
shows the average geometric selection rate for each of the experimental trials in
blind (x-axis) and sighted (blindfolded) participants (y-axis). The high corre­
lation of performance between groups means that both groups tended to
succeed/fail on the same trials.
2.2. Consistency in blind participants’ performance
To further validate our results in the blind population, we repeated the
whole experimental procedure on this group of participants in a separate
experimental session (mean interval between sessions: 13.45 days, SE = 2.42). 
A Spearman correlation test on the average performance in each 
experimental trial in the two sessions revealed a highly consistent per­
formance of the blind group (rho = 0.87,p-value <0.0001; see Supple­
mentary Fig. 1; see Supplementary Analyses 1 for full analyses). Additionally, a
Wilcoxon test confirmed no statistical difference between the overall perfor­
mance of blind participants in the second experimental session and the overall
performance of sighted participants in the haptic deviant-figure detection task
(W = 67; p-value = 0.7). 
2.3. Performance in vision vs. touch
In a separate experimental session, sighted participants performed the
exact same task in the visual modality alone, using exactly the same stimuli
(due to technical reasons, we could not analyze results from one participant).
This session was always held after the tactile session (in which they did not
receive any feedback on their answers). This was done to minimize the use of
visual imagery during tactile exploration (range between the tactile and the
visual experimental sessions: 3–84 days depending on the availability of 
participants). Results revealed that the overall visual performance of 
sighted participants was entirely comparable to previous data with 
B. Heimler et al.

sighted adults in the same task (Dehaene et al., 2006), but it was signif­
icantly better than their own performance in touch (W = 110,p-value =
0.0001) as well as that of blind-from-birth participants (W = 110, p- 
value = 0.0001) (Fig. 2A). This visual geometric advantage was also
observed within the different geometric categories (Fig. 2A and see Supple­
mentary Analysis 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2 for full analyses results). 
Crucially, however, across trials visual performance was again highly 
positively correlated with the performances of sighted but blindfolded 
participants (rho = 0.53, p-value<0.0001) as well as blind-from-birth 
participants in the haptic task (rho = 0.57, p-value<0.0001) (Fig. 2C-
D). In other words, the same trials tended to be easier or harder in both visual or
haptic deviant-figure detection tasks.
2.4. Examining the role of formal geometric education in blind participants’ 
performance 
To examine the potential role of formal geometric education in the per­
formance of blind participants in the haptic deviant-figure detection task, at
the end of the second experimental session, we asked participants to self-report
the years of formal geometric education that they received in school until
exemption (none of the participants completed the high-school geometry
curriculum; see Methods for details). No correlation was found between overall
accuracy in our deviant-figure detection test and self-reported years of formal
geometry education (rho = 0.21; p-value = 0.5). 
As an additional test for the role of formal education, we compared the
results of our blind participants in touch with previous data documenting the
performance in the same task in the visual modality in two groups: (1) sighted
adults coming from an Amazonian group, the Mundurucu, who lacked any
formal geometric education and also lack lexical terms for the geometric
concepts tested in our task (Dehaene et al., 2006) and (2) U.S. preschoolers
(Izard & Spelke, 2009). Across trials, we found significant Spearman corre­
lations between the performance of blind adults in touch and both Amazonian
adults (rho = 0.74, p-value<0.0001) and preschoolers in vision (rho =
0.72, p-value<0.0001) (Fig. 2E-F). These latter results further highlight the
consistent nature of geometric intuitions across sensory modalities. The overall
performance of pre-school children in vision and of blind-from-birth adults in
touch did not differ (Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 1.79, df = 1, p-value =
0.2). Mundurucu adults however outperformed blind participants 
(Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 11.65, df = 1, p-value = 0.0006). 
Taken together, these results further exclude a crucial role of formal edu­
cation in the emergence of spontaneous geometric intuitions. Moreover, they
suggest that geometric intuitions are strengthened by life-long spatial explo­
ration carried out through vision rather than touch.
3. Discussion
In the present study, we tested whether visual experience is necessary for
analyzing figures according to their geometrical properties. Three main con­
clusions emerged from our findings: 1) In the absence of experience with vision,
blind-from-birth participants can analyze haptic figures according to a wide
range of geometric properties. 2) The performance of sighted and blind-from
birth participants was highly correlated across items, independently of the
sensory input modality. This indicates that the geometric concepts that were
harder to detect for the blind (such as symmetry and complex geometric
transformations) were also harder to detect for sighted participants, both in
touch and vision. This in turn suggests that the two sensory modalities evoke
similar geometric intuitions, ultimately providing supporting evidence in favor
of the existence of an abstract, amodal system of geometrical concepts. 3)
Geometric selection was overall more frequent in the visual than in the haptic
modality, suggesting that sensory-specific perceptual/spatial properties might
play a crucial role in fine tuning the saliency of geometric cues during visual
versus haptic processing. In the following paragraphs, we further discuss the
implications of these three conclusions.
3.1. An amodal system of core geometry intuitions
The first and most remarkable result of the present study is that blind-from-
birth adults consistently use many geometric concepts (e.g. parallelism,
quadrilaterals, angles, topology, seeFig. 1B for all trials) to identify the haptic
deviant. These results in turn demonstrate for the first time the existence of a
set of geometric intuitions that emerge independently of visual experience and
that drive spatial grouping and spatial reasoning even when touch, rather than
vision, has been the dominant sensory modality for spatial exploration across
the life span.
Whereas blind-from-birth participants spontaneously detected the geo­
metric deviant in most trials, they failed to do so in trials requiring geometric
transformations of symmetry or rotation (whether internal to a shape, or as a
relation between two shapes;Fig. 1B). Interestingly, all participants, whether
sighted or blind, and whether performing the task in vision or touch, performed
worst on these specific trials, both in our data set (Fig. 1B;Fig. 2; Supple­
mentary Fig. 2) as well as in previously published experiments using the same
paradigm (Dehaene et al., 2006; V.Izard & Spelke, 2009;Izard et al., 
2011). More generally, participants showed a similar profile of performance
across the different individual trials, which was unraveled by strong significant
correlations across populations and sensory modalities (Fig. 2C-F). One pos­
sibility is that such correlations arise from shared general-domain processes
unrelated to geometry (i.e., spatial reasoning or working memory). However,
two aspects of our task argue against this interpretation. First, while all
experimental trials differ in their geometric or spatial content, they did not
differ in terms of the (spatial) reasoning involved. Second, participants did not
systematically fail to select the geometric deviant in the most perceptually
complex trials (seeFig. 1B for a visual representation of all experimental trials),
thus excluding the hypothesis that differences in working memory requirements
among trials might underlie our results. The strong correlations reported here
thus appear to provide encouraging evidence towards the existence of an
amodal system of geometric intuitions that can be accessed through both the
visual and haptic modalities.
This latter proposal fits with previous findings in visual-haptic object
recognition experiments documenting shared brain mechanisms subtending
both visual and haptic geometrical shape-information processing (Amedi, Raz, 
Azulay, Malach, & Zohary, 2010;James et al., 2002;Lacey, Tal, Amedi, & 
Sathian, 2009). Specifically, it was proposed that the LOtv, a region in the
lateral occipital cortex, is involved in all tasks of object shape processing,
independently of the sensory modality used (vision, sound, and 3D or 2D
touch), in both sighted (Amedi et al., 2010;Amir, Biederman, & Hayworth, 
2011;James, Kim, & Fisher, 2007;Kubilius, Wagemans, & Op de Beeck, 
2014;Lacey et al., 2009;Mancini, Bolognini, Bricolo, & Vallar, 2011;
Snow, Strother, & Humphreys, 2014) and blind populations (Amedi et al., 
2010;Dormal et al., 2018;Lacey et al., 2009;Peelen, He, Han, Caramazza, 
& Bi, 2014;Ptito et al., 2012). Overall then, these previous studies might
start to provide a shared neural substrate for the spontaneous detection of
geometric concepts. However, its specific characteristics as well as those of the
related processing network still need to be further investigated using neuro­
imaging techniques. Future studies should for instance disentangle whether the
neuronal populations underlying judgments about the geometric properties of
shapes are multisensory (visuo-tactile) or sensory-specific (visual; tactile). The
former outcome would confirm the truly amodal nature of the geometry system
(see for instance (Tal & Amedi, 2009) for initial results in this direction). The
latter outcome would instead suggest two distinct modality-specific geometric
networks, albeit largely overlapping and interconnected. Note that so far, only
a small set of studies have started to investigate mathematical processing in
blind subjects, and shown that they tend to activate math-responsive circuits
largely similar to those of sighted subjects, often with the additional recruit­
ment of occipital cortex (Amalric & Dehaene, 2016;Amalric, Denghien, & 
Dehaene, 2018;Kanjlia, Lane, Feigenson, & Bedny, 2016;Togoli, Crollen, 
Arrighi, & Collignon, 2020).
Importantly, and in line with previous evidence in the sighted population
(Dehaene et al., 2006;Izard & Spelke, 2009), the present findings also
suggest that formal geometric education does not carry a crucial role, if any, in
driving the detection of simple geometric cues in blind participants. We

reported a lack of correlation between the overall performance of blind par­
ticipants in the haptic deviant-figure detection task and their self-declared
years of formal geometry education (none of the blind participants finished
the school geometry curriculum, see details in methods). Furthermore, we
showed that the performance in the same task carried out in vision by both pre-
school children and sighted Amazonian adults lacking any geometric education
was highly correlated with the blind performance in touch (Fig. 2E-F).
3.2. Differences between visual and tactile geometrical exploration
The present data revealed that sighted participants were more sensitive to
geometric properties when tested with vision than with touch. In touch, their
performance was entirely comparable to that of blind adults, but in vision they
selected the geometric deviant with better accuracy (Fig. 2A), albeit still
showing relative difficulties in the same groups of trials (Fig. 2C-D). It is
important to highlight that this difference cannot be attributed to differences in
perceptibility between haptic and visual stimuli. We indeed took various pre­
cautions to ensure that the haptic stimuli were perfectly perceptible by touch:
First, we performed various qualitative pilots prior to the start of the experi­
ment to ensure that participants could perceive all the shapes within the haptic
sheets, namely that the raised lines were above the tactile acuity threshold.
Second, we checked that stimuli were above acuity threshold for all our par­
ticipants in two ways: by asking them to perform 4 training trials at the
beginning of the experiment (see Methods for details) and by monitoring
participants’ exploration on-line, during the experiment (all participants 
in both groups fully explored the haptic sheets). 
Thus, although more work will be needed to fully confirm this point, the
gap in geometry selection between the two modalities seems to suggest that
the system for spontaneous geometric selection during spatial exploration is
more efficient in vision than touch. Note, however, that the reasons behind the
difficulties of our sighted participants in the haptic compared to the visual
version of the task might be also related to their reduced experience in haptic
exploration – reflected in the much longer time needed by sighted participants
to complete the haptic task compared to blind-from-birth participants.2An
additionally, not mutually exclusively possibility for this longer experimental
time in sighted blindfolded participants, might be related to the fact that they
possibly tried to visually imagine the haptic figures, which might have perhaps
facilitated their answers but slowed them in time. Overall, we cannot exclude
that after specific and prolonged haptic training, sighted participants would
show a performance in the haptic deviant-figure detection task more similar to
their visual one, perhaps however, strongly mediated by visual imagery.
Nonetheless, spontaneous geometric selection was also better when sighted
participants used vision than when blind adults used touch, even though blind
adults have relied mainly on touch to explore their spatial environment across
their whole lifespan. This in turn strengthens the conclusion that geometric
selection is facilitated in the visual modality, ultimately strengthening previous
results reporting different behavioral (and transfer) efficiency between sensory
modalities in certain tasks (McGovern, Astle, Clavin, & Newell, 2016).
One possible interpretation might be that various geometric concepts
simply do not develop as a consequence of haptic rather than visual spatial
experiences. However, several previous studies showed that blind participants
do possess and can successfully master the geometric concepts which they
failed to spontaneously detect in the current work. For instance, blind
participants succeeded in perceiving symmetry relations when directly
comparing symmetrical and non-symmetrical figures (Bauer et al., 2015;
Cattaneo et al., 2014, 2010) and in performing mental rotations under more
focused experimental conditions (Carpenter & Eisenberg, 1978;Marmor & 
Zaback, 1976;Occelli et al., 2016). Some of these studies even showed that
the neural representations of certain features such as symmetry are shared
between the blind and sighted populations (Bauer et al., 2015). This evidence,
in turn, discourages the conclusion that geometric concepts simply cannot be
acquired through touch.
Another option is to interpret the difference in accurate geometric selection
between vision and touch as evidence in favor of the existence of two separate
sensory-specific systems of geometric intuitions, which nonetheless are char­
acterized by partially shared spatial exploration properties that underlie similar
(to some extent) geometric selection outcomes. However, the strong correla­
tions between visual and haptic performance discussed in the section above
(Fig. 2C-D), together with known differences between haptic-driven and
visually-driven sensorimotor spatial explorations, ultimately leading to different
explorative behaviors between vision and touch (Chiesa et al., 2017;Pas­
qualotto & Newell, 2007;Postma, Zuidhoek, Noordzij, & Kappers, 2007, 
2008) seem to suggest a slightly different conclusion. Specifically, this latter
evidence may not discourage the existence of an amodal, visuo-tactile shared
system of geometry, but rather suggests the presence of certain sensory-
specific constraints. Such constraints differentially refine the shared system
properties, facilitating for instance visual over haptic geometric selection. In
line with this conclusion, we found that uneducated Amazonian adults tested
with vision outperformed blind adults in touch, ultimately suggesting that a
lifetime of visual sensorimotor spatial exploration may enhance geometric in­
tuitions. More in detail, the sequential nature of tactile exploration as opposed
to the parallel nature of visual exploration is known to facilitate local over
holistic spatial representations, as well as the preferential activation of an
egocentric (self-to-object) rather than an allocentric (object-to-object) refer­
ence frame, with this latter preference particularly evident in blind participants
during haptic tasks (Chiesa et al., 2017;Iachini et al., 2014;Pasqualotto 
et al., 2013;Pasqualotto & Proulx, 2012;R¨oder et al., 2004;Ruggiero 
et al., 2012;Schinazi et al., 2016). And indeed, the geometric properties that
were the hardest to detect by blind participants were exactly those requiring the
adoption of holistic spatial representations and an allocentric reference frame, i.
e. trials requiring holistic shapes comparisons (e.g., symmetry trans­
formations), or a direct comparison either between shapes (e.g., geometrical
transformation trials), parts of the same shape (e.g. relative distance or pro­
portion) or a shape and its context (e.g., mental rotation). In light of these
considerations and based on the current result that many spatial geometric
intuitions are indeed shared between vision and touch, future studies may
investigate the extent to which training specifically tailored to spatial explo­
ration strategies may render these geometric concepts more spontaneously
accessible to the blind, ultimately thinning or even eliminating the differences
with the visually-driven geometric selection.
3.3. Conclusions
The present study shows that a wide range of spatial geometric intuitions
can develop independently of visual experience and drive judgments about
shapes in a largely similar manner in blind and sighted adults, independently of
the main sensory-modality used for spatial exploration (touch or vision). This
finding provide encouraging evidence to the hypothesis that geometrical con­
cepts may belong to a “core knowledge” system which is either innate or 
arises largely invariantly from both formal education and sensory- 
specific spatial experience. However, even though visual and haptic 
performances were highly correlated, we observed that vision was more 
efficient than touch for detecting geometric deviants. This in turn 
highlights that shared cognitive and perceptual systems may not develop 
exactly the same behavioral properties across sensory systems due to 
sensory-specific constraints, and thus, in turn, some sensory-modalities 
may be intrinsically more efficient to process a specific type of stim­
uli/computation. We suggest that in case of the core-system of geometry, 
such differences might stem from intrinsic differences between 
2 To test potential training facilitation in geometric selection in sighted 
blindfolded participants, we performed an additional analysis comparing their 
performance in the two separate sessions which were held in two consecutive 
days (see Methods). Our aim was to check whether we observed a tendency for 
increased geometric selection in the second part of the experiment (i.e., after 
participants acquired some experience with tactile exploration). Note that the 
first experimental session in sighted, lasted more or less the same amount of 
time needed by blind to end the whole task. These analyses revealed no dif­
ference in geometric performance between the two parts of the experiment (p =
0.9), despite a tendency for being faster in the second compared to the first part 
of the experiment.

haptically-driven and visually-driven explorative/perceptual behaviors, 
rather than from differences in the mastering or possession of geometric 
concepts per se. Taken together, these results contribute new evidence to 
the recurrent debate on the origins of geometry: not only do humans rely 
on abstract geometric cues in their judgments about shapes even in the 
absence of formal education (Dehaene et al., 2006;Dillon et al., 2013;
Izard et al., 2011;Izard & Spelke, 2009;Lourenco & Huttenlocher, 2008),
but they largely do so also in the absence of visual experience. Our results may
also have important educational implications: in agreement with the initial
statement by the outstanding blind mathematician Emmanuel Giroux, they
suggest that people who are blind, regardless of their visual impairment, share a
solid universal platform of mathematical intuitions and may thrive in
mathematics.
