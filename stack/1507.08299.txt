Abstract: The Fock–Hilbert space generated by a single–particle interaction–free Wight-
man ﬁeld is augmented by introducing non–trivial multi–particle (that is, multi–point,
multilinear) quantum ﬁelds, which is justiﬁed insofar as Haag’s theorem establishes that
free ﬁeld Fock–Hilbert spaces cannot model bound or interacting states. Two Gaussian
constructions are given: one that modiﬁes the combinatoric factors and masses associ-
ated with products of propagators and a second for which locality is determined by the
center of mass of the n–particles and relative separations of the n–particles determine the
strength of resonance; it is shown how the two constructions may also be used together.
Finally, a method is given for generating non-Gaussian n–particle quantum ﬁelds that
quite closely tracks familiar interacting quantum ﬁelds but that is signiﬁcantly better–
deﬁned and that oﬀers a much richer algebraic structure for future use.

Introduction
A possible reaction to Haag’s theorem[1, 2] is to think that the Fock–Hilbert space gen-
erated by free 1–particle Wightman ﬁelds[3, Ch. II] is not “big enough” to model bound
states or interacting states generally, which is taken here to suggest adding multi–particle
bound and interacting states explicitly as multi–point ﬁelds ˆφ(x1, ..., xn) and construct-
ing physical states as superpositions of diﬀerent products of 1–particle and multi–particle
ﬁelds acting on the vacuum state. We are already accustomed to introducing quasipar-
ticles and collective excitations that are eﬀectively bound multi–particle ﬁelds such as
phonons in statistical physics and such as for protons in high energy physics.
We will ﬁrst introduce here Gaussian scalar multi–particle ﬁelds, for which the two–
operator Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) ⟨0| ˆφ(x1, ..., xn)ˆφ(x′
1, ..., x′
n) |0⟩determines all
VEVs. The ﬁrst construction, in §2.2, is almost trivial, in that it constructs the two–
operator n–particle VEV in terms of the two–operator 1–particle VEV ⟨0| ˆφ(x)ˆφ(x′) |0⟩,
⟨0| ˆφ(x1, ..., xn)ˆφ(x′
1, ..., x′
n) |0⟩=

⟨0| ˆφ(xj)ˆφ(x′

for which the n–particle operators in general commute whenever all separations xi −x′
i
are space–like. States and measurements that use these operators allow combinatoric
factors associated with the ﬁeld to be modiﬁed. For this and any construction of an n–
particle ﬁeld, we can symmetrize ˆφ(x1, ..., xn) as ˆφs(x1, ..., xn) = P
σ∈Sn ˆφ(xσ(1), ..., xσ(n)),
so that ˆφs(x1, ..., xn) is independent of the order of x1,...xn, and symmetrization will be
a natural result of the construction of non–Gaussian n–particle ﬁelds in §4.
The second construction, in its simplest form in §2.3 and §2.4, introduces the center
of mass of the n particles, X, and the n −1 relative separations zj = xj+1 −xj, in
such a way that the locality of ˆφ(x1, ..., xn) is determined exclusively by the center of
mass.
In this case, ˆφz1,...,zn−1(X) = ˆφ(x1, ..., xn) is essentially a 1–particle Wightman
ﬁeld localized at X, for which z1,...,zn−1 are continuous indices, however the construction
here is simple when Lorentz invariantly expressed in terms of the relative separations
zj instead of being simple when expressed in terms of ﬁnite–dimensional or continuous
irreducible representations of the Lorentz group.
When introducing structure additional to that of Wightman ﬁelds, we will aim to
satisfy the spirit of the Haag–Kastler axioms[3, §III.1], that there is a Poincar´e covariant
Hilbert space and a Poincar´e invariant vacuum state, satisfying the Spectrum Condition,
Additivity, Hermiticity, Locality, and Completeness, which do not explicitly require that
ﬁelds must be 1–point, 1–particle objects (we will henceforth refer to n–particle ﬁelds,
not to n–point ﬁelds or n–linear ﬁelds, notwithstanding any preference for the latter, or
at least for the latter two).
We will ﬁnd that Additivity is not generally satisﬁable by a multi–particle construc-
tion, however Additivity is more a theoretical preference for the sake of simplicity than
an empirical principle and is not infrequently omitted from relatively informal discussions
of axiomatic approaches to quantum ﬁeld theory (as in [4], for example); multi–particle
ﬁelds, as operator–valued distributions, instead satisfy more–or–less natural extensions
of the linearity of Wightman ﬁelds.
2

The construction in §2 of n–particle ﬁelds for which commutativity is determined
by only whether the centers of mass of two sets of n points are space–like separated, is
extended in §2.5 to n–particle ﬁelds for which commutativity is determined by several
diﬀerently weighted centers of mass X1, ..., Xm, distinguishing several components of the
whole, each of which is contained in the convex hull of the n points. This construction
suggests a fairly reasonable way to restrict Locality: the Haag-Kastler axioms associates
an algebra of operators with any region of space–time, and requires algebras associated
with space-like separated regions to commute, however we will adopt a more–or–less
minimal and natural restriction for an n–particle operator, that space–time regions are
required to be convex. The success of this construction corresponds to requiring that
algebras of operators are associated with convex regions of space–time because the mul-
tiple centers of mass of n points are located within the convex hull of those points. The
importance given here to the center of mass conforms well both with its importance in
classical physics and with its importance when modeling quasiparticles and collective ex-
citations as single quantum particles such as phonons; where we construct an n–particle
ﬁeld as composed of several interacting components, we expect the centers of mass of the
several components to be signiﬁcant.
As a larger Hilbert space than the Fock–Hilbert space of the Wightman ﬁeld, a sig-
niﬁcantly larger range of models is available, which can only be more empirically capable
than a free quantum ﬁeld; given that quantum optics usefully applies just the quantized
free electromagnetic ﬁeld, we can credibly hope that including multi–particle ﬁelds might
allow more widely useful application, whether or not such constructions might be thought
fundamental.
n–particle ﬁelds require a rather diﬀerent way of thinking about quantum states. We
have become accustomed to discussing the evolution of states of a free quantum ﬁeld,
so that a 2–particle input state ˜φin(k1)˜φin(k2)|0⟩, with momenta k1, k2, evolves over an
asymptotically long period to include, say, a 3–particle output component (of a diﬀer-
ent type of particle) ˜ξout(k′
1)˜ξout(k′
2)˜ξout(k′
3)|0⟩. Given 2– and 3–particle ﬁeld operators,
however, we may take a prepared state to have always included the possibility of 2– and
3–particle components, as a superposition of vector states,
h
α1 ˜φ(k1)˜φ(k2) + α2 ˜φ(k1, k2) + β1˜ξ(k′

2)˜ξ(k′

2, k′
3)

|0⟩,
say (with no distinction between input and output Hilbert spaces now required), or
perhaps as a mixture of such vector states. The probabilities of detecting the 1–, 2–
and 3–particle components vary diﬀerently with changes of separation, with an eﬀective
dynamics determined by the construction of the n–particle ﬁelds.
The construction of multi–particle real scalar ﬁelds in §2 is extended to Dirac and
Maxwell ﬁelds in §3. Finally, §4 introduces a means for generating non–Gaussian n–
particle quantum ﬁelds that is capable of quite closely approaching familiar interacting
quantum ﬁelds when just Gaussian 1–particle quantum ﬁelds are used.
Signiﬁcantly,
however, the generation of non–Gaussian n–particle quantum ﬁelds allows a much richer
and better–deﬁned construction when we use the Gaussian n–particle quantum ﬁelds
that we have introduced in §2 and §3. The introduction of this conceptually diﬀerent
3

form oﬀers a step away from the diﬃculties of regularization and renormalization that
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian deformation entail.
Wightman ﬁeld theory, and constructive quantum ﬁeld theory more generally, has
apparently not previously been extended towards multi–particle ﬁelds (see [5, §3.4], for
example, for a 1975 critique of the Wightman axioms; see [6], for example, for a recent
overview of constructive quantum ﬁeld theory). There have instead been emphases, for
example, on 1+1– and 1+2–dimensional models, Euclidean models, wedge–localization,
and deformation approaches.
Interacting quantum ﬁelds outside of axiomatic tradi-
tions have been overwhelmingly concerned with Lagrangian dynamics, regularization,
and renormalization.

Multi–particle real scalar ﬁelds
After a very brief discussion of a non–interacting 1–particle real scalar ﬁeld, we introduce
an almost trivial multi–particle ﬁeld in §2.2. The speciﬁc case of n–particle center of
mass localized ﬁelds introduces new possibilities, discussed for two particles in §2.3, for
n particles in §2.4, and generalized to an n–particle multiple center of mass ﬁeld in §2.5.
Finally for the real scalar ﬁeld case, invariance under symmetries is discussed in §2.6.
2.1
The familiar 1–particle ﬁeld
A non–interacting real scalar ﬁeld on a 4–dimensional Minkowski space can be presented
in a manifestly Lorentz covariant way as
ˆφ(x) =
Z 
a(k)e−ik·x + a†(k)eik·x
d4k,
a(k)|0⟩= 0,
⟨0| ˆφ(k)ˆφ(k′) |0⟩= [a(k), a†(k′)] = δ4(k −k′)i ˜∆+m(k)
= δ4(k −k′)δ(k·k −m2)θ(k0)
[notation, to avoid proliferating factors of 2π: δ(k) = 2πδ(k) and d4k =
d4k
(2π)4].
The
real–space commutator
[ˆφ(x), ˆφ(x′)] =
Z
2i sin

k·(x′ −x)

i ˜∆+m(k)d4k
is zero if x′ −x is space–like, satisfying Locality, because the integrand is odd under
the space–like reﬂection k →k −2
k·(x′−x)
(x′−x)·(x′−x)(x′ −x). Critically for a quantum ﬁeld,
the commutator [a(k), a†(k′)] is a positive semi–deﬁnite inﬁnite–dimensional matrix that
is diagonal in the wave–number indices k, k′, so that we can use the vacuum state to
construct a Fock–Hilbert space, and the factor i ˜∆+m(k) projects to positive energy in
all inertial frames. Although the 4–momentum operator Pµ is often constructed as a
function of quantum ﬁelds, we will here directly construct it as a generator of active
translations,
Pµ ˆφ(x1) · · · ˆφ(xn)|0⟩= 1

which admits straightforward extension to the multi–particle case.
It is worthwhile to keep in mind that quantum ﬁelds are operator–valued distributions,
so that only quantum ﬁelds “smeared” by test functions taken from some test function
space are operators that act on the Hilbert space, where the test function space is usually
taken to be a Schwartz space of functions that are smooth both in real space and in
momentum space. The creation and ﬁeld operators of a quantum ﬁeld theory can be
written as
a†
f =
Z
a†(k) ˜f(k)d4k,
ˆφf = af∗+ a†
f =
Z
ˆφ(k) ˜f(k)d4k,
so that ⟨0| ˆφ†
f ˆφg |0⟩= [af, a†
g] = (f, g)
def
=
R ˜f ∗(k)i ˜∆+m(k)˜g(k)d4k is a positive semi–
deﬁnite inner product on the test function space that projects to positive frequency
components of the test functions, and [ˆφf, ˆφg] = (f ∗, g)−(g∗, f) is zero whenever the test
functions f and g have space–like separated supports. ˆφ†
f = ˆφf∗is self-adjoint only if f
is real–valued, f = f ∗.
2.2
An almost trivial multi–particle ﬁeld
The simplest example of a multi–particle ﬁeld is the real scalar n–particle ﬁeld
ˆφ(x1, ..., xn) =
Z 
a(k1, ..., kn)e−i P ki·xi + a†(k1, ..., kn)ei P ki·xi Y
i
d4ki,
⟨0| ˆφ(k1, ..., km)ˆφ(k′
1, ..., k′
n) |0⟩= [a(k1, ..., km), a†(k′
1, ..., k′
n)]
= δm,n
Y
i
δ4(ki −k′
i)i ˜∆+m(ki),
a(k1, ..., kn)|0⟩= 0,
⟨0| ˆφ(x1, ..., xm)ˆφ(x′
1, ..., x′
n) |0⟩= δm,n
Y
i
i∆+m(xi −x′
i).
The multi–particle ﬁeld ˆφ(x1, ..., xn) satisﬁes a natural extension of Locality, that the
commutator [ˆφ(x1, ..., xn), ˆφ(x′
1, ..., x′
n)] is zero if every xi −x′
i is space–like, which is
consistent with Haag–Kastler Locality if we take the algebra of operators associated
with a region O to be presented in its bounded Weyl form and smeared by smooth test
functions f(x1, x2, ..., xn) that have support in O for each xi. We work with unbounded
operators ˆφf instead of with bounded operators eiˆφf, but otherwise, in the spirit of the
other Haag–Kastler axioms, Hermiticity, the Spectrum Condition, Poincar´e covariance,
and the construction of a Hilbert space are satisﬁed by construction as they are for
Wightman ﬁelds by the action of creation operators on a vacuum state that is a zero
eigenstate of all annihilation operators. Additivity —that the algebra associated with
O1 ∪O2 is generated by the algebras associated with O1 and O2, A(O1 ∪O2) = A(O1) ∨
A(O2)— is not satisﬁable by any multi–point formalism, because a function f with
Supp(f) ⊆((O1 ∪O2) × (O1 ∪O2)) cannot in general be generated as a sum of functions
fi with, for each i, either Supp(fi) ⊆O1 × O1 or Supp(fi) ⊆O2 × O2, however an n–
point linearity, with an algebra generated by n–point distributions and test functions
with support in O×n, is a natural replacement for Additivity. In terms of the smeared
5

n–particle creation operators
a†
f =
X
n
Z
a†(k1, ..., kn) ˜fn(k1, ..., kn)d4nk,
the corresponding annihilation operators, and the operator ˆφf = af∗+ a†
f, the commuta-
tion relations can be presented as for the 1–particle case as [af, a†
g] = (f, g), where (f, g)
is required to be a positive semi–deﬁnite inner product on a much extended test function
space, and as [ˆφf, ˆφg] = (f ∗, g) −(g∗, f).
The introduction of this kind of multi–particle ﬁeld is non–trivial, but in the ﬁrst
instance the only change that it causes is a modiﬁcation of combinatoric factors, because
all propagators are of the form i ˜∆+m(k). If we introduce a 2–particle ﬁeld smeared by
a test function f(x1, x2) = f1(x1)f2(x2), for example, denoted by ˆφf1⊗f2, for which the
2×2–particle Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) is ⟨0| ˆφf3⊗f4 ˆφf1⊗f2 |0⟩= (f ∗
3, f1)(f ∗
4, f2),
as well as the usual ˆφf, smeared by one 1–particle test function, we can construct a
transition amplitude such as
⟨0| [ˆφf3 ˆφf4 + αˆφf3⊗f4][ˆφf1 ˆφf2 + αˆφf1⊗f2] |0⟩
= (1 + α2)(f ∗
3, f1)(f ∗
4, f2) + (f ∗
3 , f2)(f ∗
4, f1) + (f ∗
3, f4)(f ∗
1, f2),
using superpositions of diﬀerent types of 2–particle components.
A signiﬁcant diﬀerence for multi–particle ﬁelds, however, is that a variety of masses
may occur that may not occur for lower–degree multi–particle ﬁelds (including 1–particle
ﬁelds), which eﬀectively models the energy dependency of the multi–particles on space–
time separations. In non–scalar ﬁeld cases, the masses allowed for multi–particle compo-
nents may also depend on relative conﬁgurations of internal degrees of freedom.
2.3
The 2–particle center of mass localized ﬁeld
An annihilation–creation commutator for the 2–particle case, [a(k1, k2), a†(k′
1, k′
2)], must
be a positive semi–deﬁnite inﬁnite–dimensional matrix, which to ensure translation in-
variance must be diagonal in the wave–number indices k1 + k2, k′
1 + k′
2. We consider an
example of the form
[a(k1, k2), a†(k′
1, k′
2)] = δ4(k1 + k2 −k′
1 −k′
2)i ˜∆+M(k1 + k2) ˜

which is invariant under a space–like reﬂection k1 + k2 →k1 + k2 −2 (k1+k2)·V

V , for
V space–like and, separately, we require invariance of
˜

2) under the
simultaneous reversals k1 −k2 →−(k1 −k2), k′
1 −k′
2 →−(k′
1 −k′
2). k1 + k2 = k′
1 + k′
2
must be forward–pointing time–like to satisfy the Spectrum Condition, but k1, k2, k′
1, and
k′
2 do not individually have to be. The inﬁnite–dimensional matrix ˜
M(k; k′) is required
to be positive semi–deﬁnite.
This 2–particle construction satisﬁes Locality insofar as the integrand in the ﬁeld

Because Locality of ˆφ(x1, x2) is determined only by the center of mass X = (m1x1 +

The n–particle center of mass localized ﬁeld
The 2–particle construction can be extended to n particles,

we obtain small transition probabilities) or small (when we obtain large transition proba-

distance function for diﬀerent numbers of particles to be inﬁnite, but mathematically we
can extend the construction to allow the VEV ⟨0| ˆφ(x1, ..., xn)ˆφ(x′

The n–particle multi–particle creation/annihilation operator commutators can be
used together with the 1–particle creation/annihilation operator commutator to con-
struct multi–particle ﬁelds using the method of §2.2, however in §2.5 we will introduce a
more general construction.

where again we require that ˜
M(· · · ; · · · ) is a positive semi-deﬁnite matrix, Lorentz in-
variant, and invariant under simultaneous reversal of all its parameters, and we can show
that [ˆφ(x1, ..., xn), ˆφ(x′

centers of masses, X′
i −Xi, are all space–like, which will certainly be the case if the
convex hulls of x1, ..., xn and of x′
1, ..., x′
n are space–like separated.
2.6
Invariance under internal symmetry
For all multi–particle constructions, we can introduce a compact symmetry group G that
acts on parameters within the construction, so that we can introduce a multi–particle
ﬁeld that is invariant under the symmetry group by integration under the Haar measure,
ˆφG(x1, ..., xn) =
Z
G
ˆφ(x1, ..., xn g)dµ(g),
where we can require for the generic multi–particle case that
[a(k1, ..., kn g), a†(k′
1, ..., k′
n g′)] = δ(g −g′)C(k1, ..., kn; k′
1, ..., k′
n g).
For the 1–particle Klein-Gordon propagator, the only parameter is mass, whereas more
elaborate group actions are possible for n–particle propagators, depending on their inter-
nal structures. Smoothing the 1–particle propagator with a continuous mass distribution
results in generalized free ﬁelds, which satisfy the Wightman axioms but do not have a
particle interpretation[5, §3.4], however smoothing over internal masses and over other
parameters may be useful for n–particle ﬁelds.
3
Dirac and Maxwell multi–particle ﬁelds
The introduction of Lorentz covariant internal degrees of freedom introduces signiﬁcantly
more structural possibilities, including the requirement that Dirac 1–particle ﬁelds (and,
in general, Dirac n-particle ﬁelds for odd n) must anticommute to satisfy Locality.
The interaction–free Dirac and Maxwell 1–particle ﬁelds can be presented as

11

[ ˆAµ(x), ˆAµ′(x′)]
=
−gµµ′i∆0(x −x′).
For the Dirac ﬁeld as presented here, avoiding the introduction of a basis of plane
wave solutions for the Dirac equation, dc
a(k) is a creation operator and, correspondingly,
dc
a(k) is an annihilation operator. The Dirac ﬁeld anticommutator above reproduces [10,
Eq. 3 170]. To ensure that the Maxwell ﬁeld commutator is a positive semi–deﬁnite inner
product, we might restrict test functions to be the divergence of a bivector,
∂
∂xαf[αµ](x),
which, being equivalent to using the 2–form ˆFαµ =
∂
∂x[α ˆAµ](x) with the test function
f[αµ](x) (assuming appropriate boundary conditions at inﬁnity), also ensures U(1)–gauge
invariance. If we take this approach, we can write [ ˆFf, ˆFg] = [ ˆAδf, ˆAδg] = (δf, δg).
As examples of a Dirac–Maxwell multi–particle ﬁeld, we can introduce a 1–Dirac+1–
Maxwell–particle ﬁeld,
ˆψaµ(x, y) =
Z 
baµ(k, u)e−ik·x−iu·y + dc
aµ(k, u)eik·x+iu·y

either almost trivially, with

{ba(k), ba′(k′)}[aµ(u), a†
µ′(u′)],
{dc
aµ(k, u), dc
a′µ′(k′, u′)}
=
{dc
a(k), dc
a′(k′)}[aµ(u), a†
µ′(u′)],
or relatively nontrivially, using, for example, the 2–particle propagator of an equal weight
center of mass localized scalar ﬁeld,
{baµ(k, u), ba′µ′(k′, u′)}

or we can use whatever weights or other constructions are useful for empirical models.
There is no immediately obvious construction that implements the U(1) and other gauge
symmetries that have been so eﬀective when using Lagrangian and other dynamical
methods. There may be a way to implement gauge symmetries in n–particle quantum
ﬁelds formalisms, however empirical eﬃcacy may in any case be possible without there
being very close connections with contemporary methods.
4
Generation of multilinear ﬁelds by polarization
Insofar as we can freely choose test functions, we can use such constructions as ˆφf⊗f,
introducing thereby a form of nonlinear dependence on test functions. Indeed we can
immediately consider constructions of homogeneous degree such as
ˆξf = ˆφf2 + ˆφf⊗f + ˆφf ˆφf
12

and we can apply derivations Lorentz invariantly to such terms, so we can also add terms
such as
ˆφ∂µf∂µf + ˆφ∂µf⊗∂µf + ˆφ∂µf ˆφ∂µf
(we have here taken constant multipliers to be 1 wherever they could be introduced).
Given a homogeneous construction ˆξf of degree n, moreover, we can construct a multi-
linear quantum ﬁeld operator that is symmetric in its arguments by polarization, so that
homogeneous nonlinear constructions may be used to generate symmetric multilinear
constructions. For ˆξf as given above, we can construct
ˆξ(2)f1⊗f2 = 1
2!
∂
∂λ1
∂
∂λ2
ˆξλ1f1+λ2f2

λ1=λ2=0
.
We can generalize this generated construction of multilinear quantum ﬁeld operators
in a way that can be engineered to match rather closely with the usual construction of in-
teracting quantum ﬁelds by introducing a deformation of a 1–particle quantum ﬁeld (here
without time–ordering, even though time–ordering can be deﬁned for both n-particle con-
structions of §2, either propagator by propagator or with time–ordering depending only
on the center–of–mass),
ˆξf =
h
e−i ˆLf
i† ˆφfe−i ˆLf.
The deformation operator ˆLf is constructed using only parameterized functionals fκ of
the test function f for which Supp[fκ] ⊆Supp[f], so that ˆξf is localized in the support
of f. We can construct as a relatively elementary example,
ˆLf =
Z 
ˆφfκ⊗fκ −ˆφ2
fκ
2
ρ(κ)dκ,
fκ(y) = f(y) + κf(y)3.
This construction eﬀectively ensures that the test function f generates 2–particle oper-
ators ˆφfκ⊗fκ for all κ in the support of ρ(κ), depending at the lowest level of expansion
on the intensity of the crossover given by the bilinear form (f ∗
κ, f) and at higher levels of
expansion also on (f ∗
κ′, fκ) for diﬀerent values of κ, κ′.
Given such constructions of ˆξf, which are nontrivially dependent on f, we can generate
a system of n–particle multilinear quantum ﬁeld operators by polarization for any n,
ˆξ(n)f1⊗···⊗fn = 1
n!
" n

i=1

.
At the lowest level, we always have ˆξ(1)f = ˆφf.

If ˆξP λifi is dependent on the λ∗
i as well
as on the λi, as may well be the case, then we can also generate multiparticle quantum
ﬁeld operators using derivatives ∂/∂λ∗
i .

We may be able to reconstruct ˆξf as
ˆξf =
∞
X
n=1
ˆξ(n)f⊗n,
13

if this expression exists, which seems, however, quite unlikely given our experience with
interacting quantum ﬁelds. If a Hilbert space can be constructed that supports a cyclic
representation of ˆξf, then we could construct a cyclic representation of ˆξ(n)f1⊗···⊗fn by
polarization, so we could equivalently take the Hilbert space to support a cyclic rep-
resentation of ˆξ(n)f⊗n. Otherwise, however, we can nonetheless take ˆξf to be a formal
generating function for the multilinear operators ˆξ(n)f1⊗···⊗fn, then, for example, we can
use the vacuum state over the algebra generated by ˆξ(n)f⊗n, all of which are functions
of whatever Gaussian ﬁelds are used in the construction of ˆLf, to construct a vacuum
Fock–Hilbert space.
fκ can be any functional of f, and κ can be taken from any parameter space. In
particular, we can take κ to be a position in space–time, in which case we can construct
an operator that is rather close to a conventional interaction term, using a method that
might be called “test function regularization”, such as
ˆLf =
Z
ˆφ4
fxd4x,
fx(y) = |f(y) · f(x + µ(f)(y −x))|2,
and introducing time–ordering,
ˆξf = T
h
e−i ˆLf
i†
T
h
ˆφfe−i ˆLf
i
.
fx(y) can be constructed in very many diﬀerent ways, under the conditions that —as for
the example given, provided the real scalar value µ(f) increases suﬃciently fast— at a
given point x, ˆφfx is localized in the support of f because Supp[fx] ⊆Supp[f]; and ˆφfx is
also localized increasingly close to the point x as f becomes closer to the plane waves used
when we construct the S–matrix of the theory, so that ˆφfx becomes “close” to ˆφ(x) and ˆLf
becomes “close” to the conventional ˆφ4 Lagrangian interaction. Although fx(y) in general
does not approach δ4(x −y) in a Lorentz invariant way, renormalizability of a theory
is perhaps exactly the property of being insensitive to diﬀerent regularizations when
parameters of the Lagrangian are taken to ﬂow appropriately, in this case as a function of
µ(f); for nonrenormalizable theories, for which regularization does make a diﬀerence, the
nonlinear dependence of fx on f ﬁxes a regularization precisely, albeit rather intractably.
The construction by polarization of the multilinear ﬁeld ˆξ(n)f1⊗···⊗fn, using the nonlinear
dependence of the test function regularized ˆξf on f, might in traditional terms be called
an expansion in powers of the test function f.
Taking the test function f to be a plane wave, which is fundamental to the idea of
an S–matrix approach to phenomenology, is typically used as an idealized description of
an experiment, however experiments in fact do not prepare states that are extended over
all space, so a detailed description should include how the test function is localized. We
note also that constructions of this historically motivated type may not provide the most
succinct and tractable physical models, given that so many structurally very diﬀerent
alternatives are available that use general parameter spaces and that use 2–particle or
higher Gaussian ﬁelds in the construction of ˆLf.

Discussion
Part of the motivation here is that it is worthwhile to present the systematics of phenom-
ena as an alternative to and without necessarily knowing or understanding the (quantum)
dynamics that cause the systematics, even though we might prefer to know and under-
stand the dynamics. A wide range of multi–particle models is possible —much extending
the modeling reach of quantum optics, for example— however such models will be more
useful if the range of models is constrained enough that almost all models can be phys-
ically realized. A theory that includes models that cannot be physically realized may
still be useful, but it will be signiﬁcantly more useful if there is a more–or–less clear
path to realization for almost all of the theory’s models; it will be important to restrict
the allowed structure of multi–particle models as far as possible by the application of
symmetries or other constraints.
A clear distinction can be made between Gaussian and non–Gaussian n–particle quan-
tum ﬁelds. It is not necessary to introduce large n Gaussian quantum ﬁelds to enable
the construction of large n non–Gaussian quantum ﬁelds, however if large n Gaussian
quantum ﬁelds are introduced then it is not necessary that the n–particle two operator
VEV has to be even remotely similar in construction to the m–particle two operator
VEV for m ̸= n, corresponding to the emergence of entirely novel properties as the num-
ber of particles increases. If large n Gaussian quantum ﬁelds are introduced, we can
hope for the constraint of a relatively straightforward, empirically eﬀective formula that
generates n–particle two operator VEVs for all n. In contrast, we have seen that the gen-
eration of non–Gaussian n–particle quantum ﬁelds can follow the familiar construction
of interacting quantum ﬁelds quite closely.
The usual presentation of an interacting quantum ﬁeld is in terms of a quantized clas-
sical ﬁeld dynamics that is expected to cause the systematics of multi–particle dynamics,
but in that case we also have to present a renormalization scheme, which in general is a
more elaborate object than the interaction terms. The multi–particle constructions sug-
gested here are perhaps no more extraordinary as an extension of the 1–particle dynamics,
with the advantage that they are mathematically better–deﬁned.
A test function perspective can be taken to motivate a stochastic signal processing
interpretation of quantum ﬁeld theory, in which powers of ˆφg (and sums of powers) can be
understood to stochastically modulate the vacuum state vector, |0⟩7→ˆφg|0⟩, |0⟩7→ˆφ2
g|0⟩,
..., or other vectors, ˆA|0⟩7→ˆφg ˆA|0⟩, ˆA|0⟩7→ˆφ2
g ˆA|0⟩, ..., with the vacuum state being a
stochastically nontrivial, Poincar´e invariant starting point. Any eﬀective contemporary
physical theory presumably must be a stochastic signal processing formalism, insofar as
the complete set of the electronic signals generated by all our experiments and stored in
a lossily compressed digitized form in computer memory (ultimately including digitized
photographs, videos, and all), or at least the set of statistics we generate from some
chosen part of that data, is the explanandum of the theory. In a classical signal processing
context, it would hardly be expected that a linear response to a given modulation would
be better than a ﬁrst approximation; a multi–particle, multi–point, multilinear formalism
is one way to provide additional resources to describe and predict nonlinear responses to
a given modulation. One consequence for experiment of a stochastic signal processing
15

interpretation is that how much a measured response depends nonlinearly or multilinearly
on many details of a given modulation, not just on the isolated detail of an average wave–
number, becomes a question of greater than usual experimental interest that suggests a
focus on high precision as much as or more than on high energy.
The approach here is essentially elementary, using a notation and ideas that are very
little removed from those of the Wightman axioms and formalizing the usual emergence
of quasiparticles and collective excitations.
We have done no more than to allow a
quantum ﬁeld to be an operator–valued distribution ˆφ(x1, ..., xn) instead of ˆφ(x) and to
accommodate this change as naturally as seems possible in the other axioms. In terms
of test functions and systems of nonlinear stimuli and responses, we have suggested we
might more use the unexceptional constructions ˆφn
f and ˆφfn, and we have introduced
ˆφf⊗n in two forms, as the almost trivial multi–particle ﬁelds of §2.2 and as center of
mass localized ﬁelds, all of which may be used or not in the construction of physically
useful models or approximations to other models. The ˆφf⊗n satisfy forms of locality that
may seem too weak, but gradual changes to our idea of locality have been a consistent
aspect of quantum mechanics over the years. There are perhaps better formalisms for
augmenting the free Wightman ﬁeld Fock–Hilbert space, nonetheless the constructions
given above of n–particle quantum ﬁelds suggest a new direction and a new inspiration
for model building regardless of formalism.
