We develop an intensive embedding for visualizing the space of all predictions for probabalistic
models, using replica theory. Our embedding is isometric (preserves the distinguishability between
models) and faithful (yields low-dimensional visualizations of models with simple emergent behav-
ior). We apply our intensive embedding to the Ising model of statistical mechanics and the ΛCDM
model applied to cosmic microwave background radiation. It provides an intuitive, quantitative
visualization applicable to renormalization-group calculations and optimal experimental design.
What is the space of predictions available to a multipa-
rameter model? How do we ﬁnd the best parameters to ﬁt
experimental data? Which parameter combinations can
be well estimated by the experimental data, and which
change the predictions too subtly to be resolved?
For simple least-squares problems, where the model
predictions are ﬁt to data points xi with errors σi, these
questions are naturally answered by the model manifold
in data space, whose points are the model predictions
y(θ) with coordinates given by the parameters θ.
In
this space parameter sets are considered close if their
predictions are close, and so the best ﬁt to data points x
is given by the closest point on the model manifold. The
squared distance is given by the cost χ2 = d2(y(θ), x) =
P(yi(θ) −xi)2/σ2
i . The rate at which the distance
d2(y(θ + δ), y(θ)) ≈gµνδµδν
(1)
changes as parameters are shifted by a small distance
δ distinguishes the stiﬀ, easily measured combinations
from the sloppy, ill-conditioned directions. Here the nat-
ural metric on the model manifold is induced from the
embedding space, and is given by
gµν =
X
i

σ2
i
∂yi
∂θµ
∂yi
∂θν .

Although embedded in a large-dimensional space,
the model manifold can be eﬀectively projected for
visualization using principle component analysis (e.g.
Fig. 1). The fact that most physical systems show low-
dimensional emergent behavior (a property which has
been called ‘sloppiness’ [1]) make these projections use-
ful.
In this manuscript, we provide a generalization of this
embedding to models whose predictions are probability
distributions.
Models can be interpreted generally as
providing a prediction for the likelihood L(x|θ) of ex-
perimental data x given θ. In the case of least-squares
ﬁtting, this is proportional to the exponential of minus
half of the cost, L(x|θ) ∝exp(−χ2/2) .
We shall study two disparate models, the Ising model
for phase transitions (Fig. 1 a) and the dark energy and
cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model (Fig. 1 b)
predictions of the microwave background radiation. The
generalized, long-bond Ising model we study is discussed
in [2] and described by the Hamiltonian

(si,jsi+1,j + si,jsi,j+1)

(3)
Here S = {si,j} represents the spin conﬁguration with
si,j = ±1, and θ = {h, J, J′} are the parameters rep-
resenting the ﬁeld, nearest and next-nearest neighbor
coupling with the temperature set to one. The predic-
tions of this Ising model are the Boltzmann probabilities
of observing a particular spin conﬁguration S, given by
L(S|θ) = exp(−Hθ(S))/Z where the partition function
Z serves to normalize the distribution to one.
The ΛCDM model we study has six parameters, which
can be described as the Hubble constant (h0), the phys-
ical baryon density (Ωbh2), the physical cold dark mat-
ter density (Ωch2), the primordial ﬂuctuation amplitude
(As), the scalar spectral index (η), and the optical depth
at reionization (τ). The ΛCDM model predicts the an-
gular power spectrum of temperature and polarization
anisotropies in maps on the CMB, in addition to other
cosmological observables.
We use the CAMB software
package [3] to generate power spectra for a range of
ΛCDM parameters in this analysis.
Parameter ranges
are detailed in [4, Table SI]. To compare to the model,
CMB maps are decomposed into spherical harmonics
with coeﬃcients aℓm.
The angular power spectral of
temperature and polarization anisotropies are computed
as Cℓ=

ground (e.g. [5]) provide thousands of independent Cℓ
measurements from large angular scales (low ℓ) to few ar-
cminute angular scales (ℓ≈3000) that are ﬁt versus ℓto
the ΛCDM model. The predictions of the ΛCDM model
can more generally be viewed as providing the proba-
bility of observing a sky map with a particular power
spectrum, since the Cℓpredicted by the theory represent
the correlations and cross-correlations. The likelihood of

As the parameters θ are varied, neither the embedding
L(S|θ) into the 2N dimensional spin probability simplex
for the Ising model nor the predictions CXY

in the space
of variances [4, Sec. I, II] forms an isometric embedding;
both distort the natural local distances between model
predictions.
There is a straightforward isometric embedding [6–8],
which is unfortunately unusable in practice for our pur-
poses. One may check [4, Section S-II.A] that 2
p
L(x|θ)
embeds the predictions of a general probabilistic model
onto the positive octant of an n-sphere of radius 2 in a
way that preserves the metric tensor given by the Fisher
information, Eq. 5.
The dimension of the n-sphere is
given by the dimension of the data, and may be ﬁnite or
inﬁnite. We denote the cosine of the angle between the

manifold as

For small system sizes, such as the 4 × 4 Ising model,
this is a useful isometric embedding and shown in Fig. 2 a.
When increasing system sizes, such as considering a
larger Ising model or expanding CMB spectra to a high
order in spherical harmonics, even slightly diﬀerent sets
of parameters will lead to easily distinguishable predic-
tions in the sense that any prediction whose probability
is large for one set of parameters will be very unlikely for
the other. Hence the dot products become approximately
zero, leading to the the models predictions becoming 90◦
apart on the n-sphere of radius two, as shown in Fig. 2.
For our exploration of the possible CMB spectra, most
pairs of parameters very neatly the maximum possible
distance of
√
8. [4, Fig. SI].
What we want is an embedding which unwinds the
manifold, revealing its intensive properties (information
per data point, rather than total information). As a mo-
tivation for this approach, consider how four spin con-
ﬁgurations drawn from an L × L Ising model roughly
gives us the same information [9] about the parameters
as would one conﬁguration drawn from a 2L × 2L Ising
model since each of these systems has the same number
of neighboring pairs, the same number of next-neighbor
pairs, etc. We can therefore reproduce the orthogonality
catastrophe of embedding large Ising models by consid-
ering multiple replicas of small Ising models, see Fig. 2 c
and Fig. 2 d; the N-times replicated 2 × 2 Ising model
stretches and wraps around the n-sphere, soon hiding
the useful geometrical information about model predic-
tions as the number of replicas goes to inﬁnity as show
in Fig. 2 d.
What we want instead is the limit as the number of
replicas goes to zero. Just as the energy of a large system
is extensive (growing with system size) and the temper-
ature is intensive (independent of size), we want an in-
tensive manifold embedding that reﬂects the information
density about the parameters embodied in the likelihood
L(x|θ), not the total information. If the cosine angle for
the unreplicated model is
Dp
L(x|θ1),
p
L(x|θ2)

, what
is it for the replicated model? The likelihood of ﬁnding
data x1, . . . , xN for a given parameter set θ is
L(N)({x1, . . . , xN}|θ) = L(x1|θ) · · · L(xN|θ).
(8)
Similarly to the non-replicated cosine between points
from Eq. 6, we can deﬁne the cosine of the angle for this
replicated system;

Now we are poised to take the limit as the number of
replicas goes to zero, giving us an intensive model man-
ifold embedding, and note that limN→0(ZN −1)/N =
log(Z). [10] We deﬁne the intensive squared distance be-
tween two parameter predictions to be the squared dis-
tance per replica in the limit N →0, or

The intensive metric distance between two predictions
in Eq. 11 is precisely the χ2 distance for the simple least-
squares problem described early on. For example, a least-
squares model y(θ) = θ with error bar σ has a natural
Euclidean metric

E(θ1, θ2) =

(yi(θ1) −yi(θ2))2/σ2

Here, the likelihood function is simply a Normal distri-
bution with mean θ and standard deviation σ, which we
denote N(θ, σ). This Euclidean metric is identical to the
intensive embedding of the same model:

The replica trick we use in Eq. 11 has yielded fruitful
insights and correct solutions in challenging problems in
statistical physics [11–13]; however, its applicability and
interpretation is not mathematically well understood. In-
deed, we ﬁnd that the limit N →0 usefully avoids con-
straints like the triangle inequality by yielding an inten-
sive manifold embedded in a zero-dimensional data space
yet can be projected along multiple orthogonal directions,
some of which have imaginary distances. Consider the
4 × 4 Ising model with 16 spins that predicts a proba-
bility distribution for each of 216 spin conﬁgurations, so
the n-sphere embedding is a manifold in S216 shown in
Fig. 2 a. The N-replicated embedding is thus a manifold
in SN216, with dimension N216 that goes to 0 as N →0.
Despite being zero-dimensional, our intensive manifold
can nonetheless can be projected along any of several or-
thogonal directions (as shown in Fig. 1 which depicts
three-dimensional projection of the Ising and CMB man-
ifolds). The standard method for extracting the ‘long’
directions of a multidimensional data set is principal com-
ponent analysis, which centers the data into columns y(J)
of a non-square matrix MiJ = y(J)
i
, and then uses a
singular value decomposition M = UΣV T .
The coor-
dinates of a data point J in the orthonormal basis of
columns of V are given by ΣααUJα.
But the squared
singular values and the columns of V are the eigenval-
ues and eigenvectors of the square matrix of dot prod-
ucts (MM T )JK = P
i MiJMiK = y(J) · y(K).
In our
replica theory limit, it is precisely these dot products
that we can extrapolate as N →0 (Eq. 10, see SI [4,
S-IV]). However, unlike the positive deﬁnite eigenvalues
of Wishart matrices (of the form MM T ), our intensive
principal component limit can and often does have neg-
ative eigenvalues – leading to imaginary components for
the coordinates of data points in the principal compo-
nent basis. Just as in Minkowski space for special rela-
tivity, the squared straight-line distance between the pre-
dictions of two parameter combinations for the intensive
manifold embedding is given by the sum of the squares
of the diﬀerences between these coordinates, and hence
imaginary displacements correspond to negative contri-
butions to this squared distance. In particular, in Fig. 1,
the next-nearest neighbor direction for the Ising model
contributes negative values to the squared distance.
The metric tensor gµν of Eq. 5 is preserved under any
isometric embedding, and for every integer N we have
a genuine Euclidean isometric embedding, so we expect
that our intensive manifold will preserve distances be-
tween nearby points. One can check in our mathemat-
ically problematical extrapolation N →0 that our in-
tensive manifold does indeed preserve this metric [4, S-
III]. In particular, nearby points have ‘space-like’ pos-
itive intensive distances.
However, as two probability
distributions become orthogonal, their intensive squared
distance d2

goes to inﬁnity. For example, the intensive distance be-
tween two Ising models with external ﬁelds h = ±∞
will be inﬁnite, since each has zero probability except
in diﬀerent fully magnetized states s↑and s↓. (This is
in contrast to the limit of
√
8 for the n-sphere embed-
ding, but in agreement with the least-squares residual
distance.) However, for ﬁnite ﬁelds (with non-zero tem-
perature) there is a non-zero probability of being in a
state with all spins up or down. Therefore, our inten-
sive distance between these two extreme points and any
other is ﬁnite. The triple (h = ∞, h = −∞, θ) for any
parameter set θ therefore violates the triangle inequality
(the sum of the lengths of two sides is smaller than the
third). The Minkowski metric may be seen as the mathe-
matical mechanism allowing the triangle inequality to be
violated.
How do we envision using our intensive model embed-
ding? Fig. 1 b illustrates the distinguishability within the
six-parameter family of ΛCDM models given recent CMB
measurements. This approach could be used to guide the
design of future instruments to measure new cosmological
parameters, such as the neutrino mass sum, the number
of relativistic species, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. One
could map out the model manifold, incorporating these
new parameters into the model and the new measurement
probes into the data space, and then take a cross section
to be consistent with current CMB data about our uni-
verse, allowing a nonperturbative characterization of the
limits of parameter uncertainties. Fig. 2, illustrating the
family of behaviors exhibited by Ising models, could eas-
ily be coarse-grained by sampling a subgrid of spins in
a large Ising model. The renormalization group tells us
that this coarse-grained model can be rescaled to match
the original model at renormalized parameters; distance
in the intensive metric embedding could be a systematic,
principled way of matching these parameters.
Understanding how to manipulate, distill, and vi-
sualize large data sets in high dimensions is a vast
and sophisticated ﬁeld, spanning mathematics, statistics,
and machine learning.
Our intensive manifold embed-
ding promises to have wide applicability in interpreting
Bayesian models of complicated systems, visualizing and
distilling the statistical mechanics of phases and phase
transitions, and guiding optimal experimental design in
poorly constrained systems, despite the Minkowskian
weirdness of the N →0 replica limit. Perhaps this weird-
ness is the reason that this manifestly useful geometrical
construction was overlooked.

This is the supplemental material accompanying Visu-
alizing theory space: Isometric embedding of probabilis-
tic predictions, from the Ising model to the cosmic mi-
crowave background.
Section I discusses the general non-Euclidean embed-
ding provided by models whose errors are dependent
upon parameter values, with particular reference to the
cosmic microwave background correlation function where
the ﬂuctuations are the predictions of the model. Sec-
tion II shows that 2
p
L(x|θ), two times the square root
of the likelihood of a ﬁt, acts as an isometric embed-
ding for a general probabilistic model onto an n-sphere
of radius two. Section II A illustrates the failures of this
n-sphere embedding as a practical tool for models when-
ever the data provides good discrimination between dif-
ferent model predictions. (The proposed intensive em-
bedding in the main text takes a formal limit of the em-
bedding as the amount of data goes to zero to bypass
this challenge.) Here we focus on the ΛCDM model and
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy predic-
tions, complementing the discussion in the main text of
the Ising model.
Section III shows that our intensive
manifold embedding is isometric – faithfully represent-
ing the distances between predictions of nearby models,
as characterized by the Fisher information. Finally, sec-
tion IV describes in detail how one generalizes principal
component analysis to the intensive manifold embedding,
ﬂeshing out the discussion in the main text by explicitly
centering the model predictions before taking the limit
of zero replicas and implementing the singular value de-
composition.

COSMIC MICROWAVE CORRELATIONS AS
A NON-EUCLIDEAN EMBEDDING
The anisotropy in CMB radiation can be characterized
by a 2 × 2 direction dependent intensity matrix Iij(ˆn)
whose components can be recognized as 3 of the 4 Stokes
parameters, I, Q, and U. The Q and U polarization maps
can be made independent of the Stokes parameter mea-
surement basis by separating them into divergence (E)
and curl (B) components, to generate three maps of cos-
mological interest; the temperature ﬂuctuation map T
and two polarization maps, E and B. These can be ex-
panded into spherical harmonics,
X(ˆn) =
X
ℓm

where X = T, E, B.
(S1)
The anisotropies are expected to be (approximately)
Gaussian.
All of the Gaussian information can be ex-
tracted form the angular power spectra, which are de-
ﬁned deﬁned as the cross correlation of the coeﬃcients in
the expansion and written as

The values of Cℓdepend on the ΛCDM parameters,
and likelihood analyses of CMB data ﬁt with such a cor-

are invaluable for ﬁtting and forecasting CMB measure-

it we make use of the following integral for symmetric,

We can compare this to to previous results for FIM
derivations, [3, 5] and conﬁrm that we obtain the same
result. We can decompose this as a sum over ℓand the
diﬀerent spectra to obtain:
gµν =
X
ℓ,XY,X′Y ′
Jl
XY,µΩl
XY,X′Y ′Jℓ
X′Y ′,ν = (JT ΩJ)µν
(S9)
where Jℓ
XY,µ = ∂CXY
ℓ
/∂θµ is a tensor of partial deriva-
tives, and Ωis given by Eq. S8 where derivatives are
taken with respect to the CXY
ℓ
. We can express Ωas a
block diagonal matrix because the CXY
ℓ
are uncorrelated
for diﬀerent values of ℓ, and in such a form represents
the FIM where the parameters of interest are the CXY
ℓ
.
Note that gµν is not constant in the coordinates given by
Cℓ.
For regular least-squares ﬁtting, Ωwould simply be a
constant matrix representing experimental uncertainty.
However, for CMB spectra, it is parameter dependent;
it varies with the Cℓ. Geometrically, this can be inter-
preted as the metric in the Cℓembedding space. Since
it varies with the Cℓ, it produces a non-Euclidean em-
bedding. Visualizing the model manifold in this space
is therefore problematic, since the space is warped and
distorted, and distances are not faithfully represented as
show in Fig. S1 a. This problem can be solved if we in-
stead consider the probability distributions the Cℓcorre-
spond to for diﬀerent parameters. In Table S1 we present
the range of ΛCDM parameters explored in our model
manifold. In for following section we explore these prob-
ability distributions for diﬀerent Cℓ.

n-SPHERE ISOMETRIC EMBEDDING AND
ITS FAILINGS
The set of probability distributions from a model gen-
erates a ‘probability simplex’, since they are all normal-
ized to one. The Fisher Information Matrix in this space
is non-Euclidean; it is diagonal with entries that are pa-
rameter dependent. For instance, in this space the Fisher

This is a non-Euclidean metric, since it is not propor-
tional to δSµ,Sν. It has a parameter dependent compo-
nent given by the Boltzmann likelihood of being in a
given spin state. This is similar to the manifold illus-
trated in Fig. S1 a, which shows the non-Euclidean em-
bedding of CMB spectra in a space whose metric is also
point-dependent and detailed in Section I.
If instead we consider the square root of a normalized
probability distribution of a ﬁt to data x, 2

then we can generate a model manifold embedded on
an n-sphere of radius two, such that the metric is the
Fisher Information Metric. Since L(x|θ) is normalized
to one and always positive, the dot product between
p
L(x|θ1) and
p
L(x|θ2) must be less than one, or equal
to one if the likelihood functions are the same. The dis-
tance between two points on this n-sphere is proportional
to the Hellinger distance [7], an f -divergence similar to
the Kullback-Leibler divergence. It is straightforward to
show that the metric for this n-sphere of radius two em-
bedding is given by the Fisher Information Matrix, by
considering the distance for some small perturbation δθ:

be in this embedding, and that is given by the points
on the poles attached to the positive orthant of the n-
sphere. These are a distance
√
8 apart if the radius is
two. Therefore, as more and more data are collected, cre-
ating increasingly orthogonal points, the manifold ‘winds
around’ the n-sphere.
The image generated by this is
not ‘faithful’, in the sense that it does not allow for low-
dimensional representations, as shown in Fig. S1 c.
A.
Cosmic microwave n-sphere embedding
There are three important diﬀerent measures by which
the CMB probability distributions can be compared. The
ﬁrst is a scaled Helligner distance [7] dH which generates
the n-sphere embedding (Fig. S1 c), the second is our
intensive distance dI shown in (Fig S1 b) and the third is
the Kullback-Liebler divergence, derived from a normal-
ization of the least squared distance over all possible data
that could generate a given set of spectra (which cannot
be as easily visualized because it is asymmetric). Note
that the manifolds shown in Fig. S1 are presented with
no lensing or B polarization. The full model manifold for
all polarization and including lensing, up to ell = 2800, is
insuﬃciently sampled by the data used in this manuscript
and so is not presented.
When embedding CMB predictions on the n-sphere of
radius two, our squared distance between predictions for
parameter sets θ1 and θ2 is d2
H, the rescaled Hellinger
distance, and can be expressed as:

where the last expression is derived by taking a straight-
forward integral using Eq. S4. As the expansion is taken
to higher order, the product rapidly converges to zero, re-
sulting in a distance of

in parameters, as shown in the distance histogram of
Fig. S1 f which illustrates the huge peak.

It would be natural from an information geometry
point of view to minimize d2
I in ﬁnding best ﬁts of the
model to data. In practice, the astrophysics community
minimizes using a least squares method normalized over
all possible data that could yield the same results [1, 2, 8].

where ˆCℓrepresents the measured CMB spectra from ex-
perimental data, and Cℓ(θ) are the spectra predicted for
parameters θ. In both cases, the Kullback-Leibler and
the Hellinger divergences measure distance between prob-
ability distributions. These two divergences belong to a
broader class of f-divergences, where f is a convex func-
tion. In all these cases, the distance between two prob-
ability distributions is characterized by the choice of f
function, and the metric (the divergence between nearby
parameter sets) is proportional to the Fisher Information
Matrix [9].

producing the same ﬁsher information metric shown in
Eq. S11. For simplicity, we have dropped all terms from
the expansion equal to zero. By preserving the local met-
ric, our intensive embedding is isometric.

PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS FOR
THE INTENSIVE MANIFOLD EMBEDDING
In order to visualize the various model manifolds in
Fig. S1, we performed a principal component analysis on
the data. This process rotates the data into an orthogo-
nal basis such that the ﬁrst component is along the direc-
tion of greatest variation, the second direction is along
the direction of second greatest variation, and so on. In
order to accomplish this, a data set {d(J)} is produced,
indexed by the superscript (J). A data matrix can be
produced, DiJ = d(J)
i
, and the index i indicates the vec-
tor component of the data. This can be discrete, such
as the probability state vector for the Ising model, or
continuous such as the likelihood of observing a certain
ﬂuctuation alm in a CMB map.
The columns of D are centered, producing a matrix
MiJ = d(J)
i
−˜di where ˜d = 1
n
P
J d(J) and n is the num-
ber of data points.
A singular value decomposition is
normally performed on M = UΣV T , and the ith princi-
pal component for data point J is now given by ΣiiUJi.
This works for discrete data, but in the case of contin-
uous data (such as likelihood functions) we must take a
slightly diﬀerent approach.
We construct a matrix of dot products,
(MM T )JK =

d(J) · d(L) + d(K) · d(L)

d(L) · d(L′).
(S17)
Since this matrix can also be expressed as MM T =
UΣV T V ΣU T = UΣ2U T , we can ﬁnd the principal com-
ponents of our data by ﬁnding the eigenvalues and eigen-
vectors of the matrix of dot products.
If we consider
the case where data points d(J) are the square roots
of the probability distribution predicted from parame-
ter combination θJ then, using the dot product for our
N replicated system, we can write out the components
of (MM T ) as:
(MM T )JK =⟨θJ; θK⟩N

matrix of dot products becomes:

In the case where the number of replicas is not a whole
number, and in the limit where it tends to zero, the ma-
trix of dot products is no longer positive deﬁnite. As a
result, we can obtain positive and negative eigenvalues
from its decomposition, leading to real and imaginary
principal components.
In order to include experimental data into this plot,
a probability distribution from the data must be gener-
ated. The dot product between these measurements and
predicted distributions can then be calculated, and the
results used in the matrix of dot products in Eq. S19 to
ﬁnd it’s projection along the principal components. The
distance from the point to the manifold is given by our
intensive distance from the point to the best ﬁt.
