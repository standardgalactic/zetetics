Sleep is fundamental to life, and poor sleep quality is linked to the suboptimal function of
the neural circuits that process and respond to emotional stimuli. Wakefulness (“arousal”)
is chieﬂy regulated by circadian and homeostatic forces, but affective mood states also
strongly impact the balance between sleep and wake. Considering the bidirectional
relationships between sleep/wake changes and emotional dynamics, we use the term
“emotional arousal” as a representative characteristic of the profound overlap between
brain pathways that: (1) modulate wakefulness; (2) interpret emotional information;
and (3) calibrate motivated behaviors. Interestingly, many emotional arousal circuits
communicate using specialized signaling molecules called neuropeptides to broadly
modify neural network activities. One major neuropeptide-enriched brain region that is
critical for emotional processing and has been recently implicated in sleep regulation is
the bed nuclei of stria terminalis (BNST), a core component of the extended amygdala
(an anatomical term that also includes the central and medial amygdalae, nucleus
accumbens shell, and transition zones betwixt). The BNST encompasses an astonishing
diversity of cell types that differ across many features including spatial organization,
molecular signature, biological sex and hormonal milieu, synaptic input, axonal output,
neurophysiological communication mode, and functional role. Given this tremendous
complexity, comprehensive elucidation of the BNST neuropeptide circuit mechanisms
underlying emotional arousal presents an ambitious set of challenges. In this review,
we describe how rigorous investigation of these unresolved questions may reveal key
insights to enhancing psychiatric treatments and global psychological wellbeing.

INTRODUCTION
Precise control of wakefulness (‘‘arousal’’) is essential for generating the adaptive forms of
reward-seeking and stress resilience that encourage healthy survival (Tsujino and Sakurai,
2009; Eban-Rothschild et al., 2017). Thus, neuronal wakefulness systems were shaped by
evolution to confer high sensitivity for detecting, interpreting, and acting upon emotional stimuli.

BNST Neurocircuitry of Emotional Arousal
Healthy sleep/wake cycles are essential for optimal cognition and
emotion, and poor sleep quality can lead to deleterious changes
in the physiological function of brain circuits that gate behavioral
responses to emotional stimuli (Koob and Colrain, 2020). In
mental health conditions of addiction, anxiety, and depression,
maladaptive responses to hedonically-valenced stimuli are linked
to distinct activity patterns in brain arousal pathways. Indeed,
stress is a major factor driving insomnia (inability to sleep),
and various sleep-related disturbances are common among
individuals enduring stress-related psychiatric conditions. On
the other hand, experiencing pleasure and anticipating future
reward can also extend wakefulness and prevent healthy sleep,
highlighting the ability of both positive and negative hedonically-
valenced stimuli to shift the thresholds of arousal (Eban-
Rothschild et al., 2018). A further fascinating example of the link
between emotion and arousal is the sleep disorder narcolepsy with
cataplexy, in which powerful feelings of euphoria or aversion can
interrupt wakefulness by triggering rapid intrusion of a sleep-like
state (Adamantidis et al., 2020). These profound neuroscientific
mysteries hint at the commonalities among (and/or interactions
between) brain pathways that calibrate wakefulness, process
emotional information, and generate motivated behaviors.
Intriguingly, many emotional arousal circuits use specialized
modulatory signaling molecules called neuropeptides to fine-tune
the coordination of broad neural network activity (Ryabinin
et al., 2012; Schank et al., 2012; Giardino and de Lecea, 2014;
Kash et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017). One major neuropeptide-
enriched emotional processing network is the extended amygdala
(an anatomical term referring to neurons spanning the bed
nuclei of stria terminalis (BNST), central and medial amygdalae
(CeA, MeA), nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), and the
transition zones betwixt; Alheid, 2003). While communication
via neuropeptide signaling likely allows the BNST to perform
sophisticated control of emotional arousal circuitry, the primary
mechanisms underlying changes in synthesis, storage, and release
of peptide neuromodulators from BNST neurons remain largely
undescribed. This is due in part to the complex patterns
of more than 10 discrete neuropeptides that are distributed
in varying combinations of multi-neuropeptide co-expression
amongst up to forty unique cellular subpopulations (Moffitt et al.,
2018; Welch et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2020).
The BNST encompasses a particularly astonishing diversity
of cell types that differ along spectrums of several features,
including spatial organization, molecular signature, biological
sex and hormonal milieu, synaptic input, axonal output,
neurophysiological messaging, and functional role (Kash et al.,
2015; Lebow and Chen, 2016; Vranjkovic et al., 2017; Ch’ng et al.,
2018; Beyeler and Dabrowska, 2020).
Historically, an all-encompassing framework for the BNST
cell groups and connections driving emotional behaviors
was limited by existing pharmacological and neurochemical
approaches.

SPATIALLY-DEFINED BNST CELL TYPES
The BNST is a ventromedial forebrain complex surrounded
on all sides by the hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum, septum,
and lateral ventricles. Given the wide-ranging descriptions of
‘‘BNST’’, we primarily discuss the multiple distinct neuronal
populations
corresponding
to
those
encompassed
within
adult mouse (Mus musculus) brain stereotaxic coordinates
approximately +0.45 to −0.35 mm anterior/posterior (A/P),
0.40 to 1.20 mm medial/lateral (M/L) bilaterally off the
midline, and −4.0 to −5.0 mm dorsal/ventral (D/V). Various
systems of nomenclature have been proposed for labeling
unique BNST subcompartments, but the classification of BNST
cellular populations based solely on spatial location remains
unstandardized and highly subjective (Bota et al., 2012; Lebow
and Chen, 2016; Barbier et al., 2021). This persisting lack of
consensus for definitive BNST spatial subdivisions reflects the
challenges faced by early anatomists, who first divided BNST on
the M/L axis, only to be challenged by developmental biologists
who inferred a predominantly A/P axis, followed by synaptic
physiologists, neurochemists, and others who emphasized a D/V
axis (corresponding to divergent patterns of monoaminergic
innervation, for example; De Olmos and Ingram, 1972; Krettek
and Price, 1978; Weller and Smith, 1982; Bayer and Altman,
1987; Dong et al., 2000; Egli and Winder, 2003; Bota et al.,
2012; McElligott et al., 2013; Radley and Johnson, 2018).
Although functional associations with BNST divisions across
each of the anatomical axes have sparked valuable hypotheses,
variability in the degree to which unique BNST features differ
across distinct spatial dimensions limits the holistic impact
of relying solely on such descriptors to functionally parcellate
the BNST.
For example, the term ‘‘ventral BNST’’ commonly refers
to neurons located directly ventral to (beneath) the anterior
commissure (a prominent white matter tract that forms a
wide horizontal band when viewed in the coronal plane).
However, pioneering neuroanatomists acknowledged more
than 30 years ago that, while the commissure may be a
useful landmark for dividing general areas of the BNST,
‘‘it does not necessarily always define strict cytoarchitectonic
boundaries, since a component of the dorsal area may well
be separated and come to lie in the ventral area’’ (Ju and
Swanson, 1989). In other words, the commissure forms a
wide horizontal shape only at certain points along the rodent
BNST A/P axis, and the commissure’s departure from view
in the caudal BNST reveals contiguous cellular populations
that may have been ‘‘divided’’ on a D/V axis in rostral
sections purely incidentally. Indeed, Ju and Swanson (1989)
noted that ‘‘Immunohistochemical studies with antisera to
several peptides also indicate very similar staining patterns
within these (D/V) regions. It seems clear to us, therefore,

that the anterior commissure simply passes through the BNST’’
(Ju and Swanson, 1989).
Upon eschewing the commissure as a monolithic landmark,
Swanson and colleagues identified at least five different BNST
cellular populations residing ventrally to the commissure (Ju
and Swanson, 1989; Ju et al., 1989; Dong et al., 2001a,b;
Dong and Swanson, 2003, 2004a,b, 2006a,b,c). Although they
originally used the abbreviation ‘‘vBNST’’ to refer only to a
particular ventralmost subnucleus within the ventral BNST
complex (Ju and Swanson, 1989; Ju et al., 1989; Dong
et al., 2000, 2001a,b; Dong and Swanson, 2003, 2004a,b,
2006a,b,c), modern widespread usage of the term ‘‘vBNST’’
generally translates to ‘‘ventral BNST writ large’’, and the
commissure remains a major dividing line for ascribing any
readily identifiable characteristics that may be distinguished
along the D/V BNST axis. Supplementary Table 1 displays
the incongruity of stereotaxic coordinates used to target the
mouse ‘‘ventral BNST’’ in recent behavioral neuroscience
publications, reflecting the limitations of relying on ambiguous
spatial descriptors (Jennings et al., 2013b; Dedic et al., 2018;
Kim et al., 2018; Hardaway et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020;
Girven et al., 2020). Especially given the renewed interest in
adjacent bordering structures (i.e., ventral pallidum, substantia
innominata, preoptic area; McHenry et al., 2017; Gordon-
Fennell et al., 2019; Ottenheimer et al., 2019; Stephenson-
Jones et al., 2020), investigators may decide to refine their
definitions when examining ventrally-located BNST neuronal
populations. Of course, ‘‘ventral BNST’’ is simply one of
many instances of imperfect BNST anatomical nomenclature.
Numerous additional examples of incongruous systems for
spatially labeling neuronal subtypes serve only to further
strengthen the rationale for adopting a BNST framework
that heavily incorporates non-spatial defining features (Ju and
Swanson, 1989; Jennings et al., 2013a,b; Kim et al., 2013; Giardino
et al., 2018; Barbier et al., 2021).
Although beyond the scope of this review, potential
differences in the spatial organization of BNST cell types
between various rodent and primate species also require serious
consideration. In addition to the anatomical literature cited
above, we refer the reader to foundational work from Bales,
Blackford, Fox, Fudge, Luyten, Shackman, Trainor, Zahm, and
others (Zahm, 1998; Fudge and Haber, 2001; Zahm et al., 2003;
Hostetler et al., 2011; Avery et al., 2014, 2016; Fox et al., 2015;
Luyten et al., 2016; Shackman and Fox, 2016; Fudge et al.,
2017; Oler et al., 2017; Raymaekers et al., 2017; Reichard et al.,
2017; Theiss et al., 2017; Duque-Wilckens et al., 2018; Fox
and Shackman, 2019; Luyck et al., 2019, 2020; Flook et al.,
2020; Luyten, 2020). Indeed, most in vivo data generated from
monkey and human BNST thus far has been collected using
methods with a low spatial resolution like functional magnetic
resonance imaging and deep brain stimulation. Within these
mental health contexts, reliable in vivo parcellation of human
BNST subcompartments remains a lofty goal. Keeping this
in mind, we encourage others to acknowledge the possibility
that acquiring enhanced spatial resolution of the BNST in
human patients may turn out to be largely inconsequential for
improving overall psychiatric and neurological outcomes. In
doing so, we posit that emphasis on non-spatial aspects of BNST
neurons (such as molecular markers, physiological features,
long-range projection targets, and sources of upstream neural
inputs) may hold the key for accelerating discovery on functional
contributions of BNST circuitry to behavior and sleep/wake
arousal states.
MOLECULARLY-DEFINED BNST CELL
TYPES
Similar to the rest of the extended amygdala, the BNST contains
many cell types marked by a myriad of neurotransmitters,
neuropeptides, receptors, enzymes, and regulatory proteins (Bota
et al., 2012). The BNST primarily consists of subpopulations
of inhibitory neurons marked by the GABA transporter Vgat,
as well as excitatory populations marked by the glutamate
transporter
Vglut2,
and
a
mixed
excitatory/inhibitory
population marked by co-expression of Vgat and Vglut3
(Kudo
et
al.,
2012;
Jennings
et
al.,
2013b).
Although
these
various
GABAergic
and
glutamatergic
populations
are
widely
dispersed,
mapping
molecularly-defined
cell
types to different spatial areas of the BNST may help
clarify how different subregions regulate emotional arousal
behaviors (Figure 1).
To survey BNST neurons defined by molecular markers other
than GABA/glutamate transporters, multiple studies first used
Cre driver rodent lines with Ai9/Ai14 tdTomato fluorescent
reporter mice or viral labeling techniques and combined
anatomical analyses with immunohistochemical staining (Chen
et al., 2015; Pomrenze et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016; Giardino
et al., 2018; Walker et al., 2019). The global population of Vgat-
BNST neurons was found to encompass several molecularly-
defined subgroups, including neurons expressing genetic and
protein markers for the neuropeptides corticotropin-releasing
factor (Crf ; Dabrowska et al., 2013, 2016) and cholecystokinin
(Cck; Giardino et al., 2018). Crf and Cck are non-overlapping
GABAergic subpopulations that occupy separate lateral vs.
medial subdivisions, co-residing in adjacent compartments
throughout the middle of the BNST A/P axis, approximately
+0.2 to −0.2 mm from Bregma in the mouse. In addition to
Crf and Cck, the neuropeptides dynorphin (Pdyn), enkephalin
(Penk), neurotensin (Nts), neuropeptide Y (Npy), nociceptin
(Pnoc), somatostatin (Sst), substance P (Tac1), neurokinin B
(Tac2), and vasopressin (Avp) are also found in neurons
throughout the BNST (Malsbury and McKay, 1987; Walter
et al., 1991; Poulin et al., 2009; Kudo et al., 2014; Crowley
et al., 2016; Ahrens et al., 2018; Giardino et al., 2018;
Zelikowsky et al., 2018; Kovner et al., 2019; Rigney et al.,
2019; Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020;
Whylings et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Figure 1A). Labeling
for the calcium-binding protein calretinin appears selective
for the dorsolateral (dl)BNST, whereas dopamine receptor
type-1 (Drd1) and protein kinase C delta (Pkcd) neurons
cluster more specifically within the oval nucleus (ovBNST, a
discrete subnucleus within the larger dlBNST subregion; Kim
et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2016; Pomrenze et al., 2019a;
Wang et al., 2019).

hypothesized BNST pathways with unknown molecular traits and spatial distributions across the BNST.
Breakthrough efforts to characterize the entire genetic
diversity of the BNST and surrounding regions at the single-cell
level provided evidence for up to 37 distinct neuronal subtypes,
although an exhaustive discussion of this data is beyond the scope
of our review (Moffitt et al., 2018; Welch et al., 2019). A more
recent single-cell RNA sequencing study targeted specifically
in the dorsal (d)BNST identified several neuronal clusters,
including those marked by expected genes (e.g., Pkcd, Sst,
Npy), but also some surprising markers (e.g., Lmo4; Rodriguez-
Romaguera et al., 2020).
Numerous BNST neurons (particularly in the posteromedial
[pm]BNST) express markers for actions of gonadal steroid
hormones, including the androgen receptor (AR), progesterone
receptor (PR), estrogen receptors, and aromatase (Aro), the
enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens (Bayless and Shah,
2016). Aro-BNST neurons have been well-studied in contexts of
sexually dimorphic behaviors (Bayless et al., 2019), and pmBNST
neurons expressing AR and PR are more numerous in males vs.
females (Juntti et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013), highlighting the
importance of sex differences and hormonal interactions when
studying BNST contributions to emotional arousal (Bangasser
and Shors, 2008; Bangasser et al., 2019).
Concerning
the
potential
wake-modulating
effects
of
molecularly-defined BNST subpopulations, the reported pupil
dilatory effects of Pnoc-BNST neuron stimulation (Rodriguez-
Romaguera et al., 2020) suggest that such rapid arousal responses
may also regulate sleep/wake state transitions, but this has not
been explicitly tested. Furthermore, while genetic markers in
the BNST have thus far been primarily used to simply define the
type of cell rather than determine the role of the corresponding

protein product, future progress will shift toward understanding
the physiological actions of the molecule itself. For example, it
will be essential to assess whether modern neurotechnological
approaches used to stimulate CRF-expressing BNST neurons will
be sufficient to accurately recapitulate the sleep/wake changes
resulting from the natural release of the CRF neuropeptide from
BNST neurons.
PROJECTION-DEFINED BNST CELL
TYPES
A major property of the BNST is its connections with a
plethora of downstream target brain regions, providing a useful
framework for conceptualizing the potential contributions of
BNST neurons to distinct features of sleep/wake arousal states
(Figure 1B). For example, by examining BNST projection
neurons that form synapses with cells in limbic regions regulating
emotional behavior, One landmark article characterized the
role of three different BNST pathways in separate features of
anxiety (Kim et al., 2013). The authors showed that neurons
in the anterodorsal (ad)BNST target the lateral hypothalamus
(LH), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and parabrachial nucleus
(PBN) to drive anxiolysis, reward, and decreased respiratory rate,
respectively. Retrograde tracing determined minimal overlap
between cells projecting to the three different downstream
regions, collectively implying unique anxiety-relevant functions
for different BNST cell types based in part on their projection
targets. Given the rich literature describing roles for the LH
(Li et al., 2017, 2018), VTA (Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016,
2020), and PBN (Kaur and Saper, 2019) in various aspects
of sleep/wake regulation, we speculate that such BNST axonal
outputs controlling separable components of emotional behavior
may also modulate distinct physiological aspects of sleep/wake
arousal states (Figure 1C).
In earlier studies of BNST neuroanatomy in rodents,
VTA-projecting BNST neurons had been characterized by the
Watanabe group, who identified a double-inhibitory pathway
in which GABAergic BNST neurons preferentially target
VTA-GABA neurons (Kudo et al., 2012). Kudo et al. (2012,
2014) also identified VTA-projecting BNST neurons marked by
the glutamate transporters Vglut2 and Vglut3, as well as the
opioid peptide Penk, providing multiple diverse mechanisms for
modulating the activity of GABA and dopamine (DA) neurons in
the VTA. Jennings et al. (2013b) reported that Vgat and Vglut2
neurons specifically in the ventral (v)BNST synapse onto GABA
and DA VTA neurons, where they control distinct motivational
states. Numerous other studies also focused on VTA-projecting
BNST neurons, including those labeled by Crf and Pdyn (Briand
et al., 2010; Silberman et al., 2013; Marcinkiewcz et al., 2016;
Pina and Cunningham, 2017; Rinker et al., 2017; Companion and
Thiele, 2018; Dedic et al., 2018; Fellinger et al., 2020).
Given
recent
evidence
that
VTA-DA
neurons
drive
wakefulness
and
regulate
nest-building
(a
critical
sleep
preparatory sequence in mice), BNST→VTA-DA circuits
may therefore be a key mechanism influencing ethologically-
relevant behavioral arousal (Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016, 2017;
Eban-Rothschild and de Lecea, 2017). Furthermore, the activity
of the VTA-GABA neuron population was found to be positively
correlated with high-frequency gamma signal (30–80 Hz) during
wakefulness, providing another measure of physiological arousal
likely impacted by BNST→VTA projections (Eban-Rothschild
et al., 2020).
Separate efforts on LH-projecting neurons identified a large
Vgat-BNST population that preferentially targeted Vglut2-LH
neurons downstream (Jennings et al., 2013a). Later studies
determined that LH-projecting Vgat-BNST neurons include
both Crf
and Cck subpopulations that exhibit divergent
preferences for downstream target cell types, with Crf -BNST
neurons displaying a particularly high level of connectivity with
LH neurons containing the arousal-promoting neuropeptide
hypocretin (Hcrt; also known as orexin; Giardino et al.,
2018). Hcrt-LH neurons comprise a subset of glutamatergic
LH neurons, consistent with the interpretation that Crf -
BNST→Hcrt-LH
connections
represent
a
subset
of
the
larger
Vgat-BNST→Vglut2-LH
pathway.
González
et
al.
(2016) also investigated BNST→LH connectivity, finding
that Vgat-BNST neurons synapse onto both Hcrt/orexin and
melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons of the LH.
This discovery of BNST neurons interacting with the MCH
system is notable based on several studies showing that Mch-LH
neurons promote rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (Bandaru
et al., 2020).
In addition to their LH projections, Crf and Cck BNST
neurons innervate (to varying degrees) the paraventricular
nucleus
of
the
hypothalamus
(PVN),
medial
amygdala
(MeA), CeA, medial preoptic area (mPOA), NAcSh, ventral
premammillary nucleus (PMv), and ventrolateral periaqueductal
gray (vlPAG; Dabrowska et al., 2016; Giardino et al., 2018). BNST
projections to the PVN are particularly relevant given recent
findings that glutamatergic neurons in this region are critical for
the control of wakefulness (Liu et al., 2020). Further pursuing
questions
of
BNST→hypothalamus
connectivity,
Barbier
et al. (2021) traced the long-range projections of dlBNST and
dorsomedial (dm)BNST neurons in exquisite detail, finding that
the dlBNST projects especially to the LH and tuberomammillary
nucleus (TMN; the site of wake-promoting histamine neurons;
Barbier et al., 2021). In contrast to the dlBNST, the dmBNST
preferentially innervates the PVN, the arcuate nucleus (Arc), and
dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) regions that may influence
sleep pressure via regulation of metabolic and thermoregulatory
processes (Barbier et al., 2021).
In
addition
to
targeted
investigations,
serendipitous
retrograde labeling of upstream neurons has yielded surprising
BNST outputs and circuit motifs. For example, monosynaptic
rabies tracing from either ‘‘patch’’ or ‘‘matrix’’ neurons in the
dorsal striatum revealed a major input from the dBNST to patch
neurons that were largely absent from matrix neurons (Smith
et al., 2016). These dBNST neurons form inhibitory synapses
with striatal patch neurons who in turn project to DA neurons
in the substantia nigra. Similarly, a GABAergic projection from
Sst-BNST neurons was recently characterized and shown to
form synapses with parvalbumin interneurons in the NAcSh
(Xiao et al., 2020). Therefore, in addition to directly targeting
the VTA, the BNST is capable of modulating mesolimbic DA

function through indirect mechanisms at sites of midbrain
innervation in the striatum.
Monosynaptic rabies tracing also identified BNST neurons
that project directly to serotonin and GABA neurons in the
dorsal raphé nucleus (DR; Weissbourd et al., 2014). Interestingly,
BNST→DRN neurons preferentially target GABA cells over
serotonin cells. While the majority of the BNST→DR cells were
GABAergic at mouse coordinates +0.14 mm A/P from Bregma,
a smaller set of BNST→DR neurons were labeled by Vglut2
at +0.02 mm A/P from Bregma. Separate rabies tracing studies
also revealed BNST inputs to noradrenergic locus coeruleus
neurons (Schwarz et al., 2015), DA and GABA VTA neurons
(Beier et al., 2015), and CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) PVN neurons
(Jiang et al., 2018).
Beyond its rich collection of long-range projection neurons,
the BNST contains several species of short-range interneurons.
The Deisseroth group showed that ovBNST neurons project
locally between subregions of the adBNST where they release
GABA (Kim et al., 2013). In line with this, ovBNST neurons
secrete dynorphin to inhibit excitatory basolateral amygdala
(BLA) fibers innervating the adBNST (Crowley et al., 2016).
Neurons in ovBNST also send dense axons to the vBNST
(Dong et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2019). Aside from inhibitory
local connections, many studies raised the possibility that
neuropeptide modulators are also released locally from within
the BNST. For example, NPY enhances inhibitory transmission
in Crf -BNST neurons (Pleil et al., 2015) and although this
study did not identify the source of NPY, the BNST contains
several NPY-expressing neurons capable of local release. Another
study from the Kash group found a complex microcircuit in
the BNST comprised of Crf interneurons that are modulated by
serotonin and regulate the activity of separate long-range BNST
projection neurons (Marcinkiewcz et al., 2016). Collectively,
these studies demonstrate the complexity of both long-range and
local connectivity in the BNST and point to another dimension
of inherent organization arising from gene expression and
neurotransmitter phenotype.
PHYSIOLOGY-DEFINED BNST CELL
TYPES
The BNST contains multiple neuronal cell types that have been
classified according to their electrophysiological properties, most
prominently in rats by Hammack and others (Hammack et al.,
2007; Hazra et al., 2011; Dabrowska et al., 2013; Rodríguez-
Sierra et al., 2013; Silberman et al., 2013; Nagano et al., 2015;
Yamauchi et al., 2018). While originally described primarily
within the ovBNST, these three types (Type I, II, and III) have
also been identified in the non-oval areas of adBNST, as well
as anteroventral (av)BNST. Type I neurons exhibit an Ih-like
current in response to hyperpolarizing current injection and a
regular firing pattern in response to depolarizing current. Type II
neurons exhibit a similar Ih-like current but burst fire in response
to depolarizing current. Type III neurons do not exhibit an Ih-
like current but instead, show a fast rectification in response
to hyperpolarizing current and exhibit a regular firing pattern
when depolarized. Coupled with the diverse synaptic inputs,
these physiological characteristics likely play a strong role in
modulating varied forms of BNST output.
Regarding distinct output modes of neurophysiological
communication, most outgoing physiological signals from the
BNST have been recorded simply as GABAergic/glutamatergic
inhibitory/excitatory
postsynaptic
currents.
However,
the
existence of co-expressed neuropeptides in Vgat-BNST neurons
suggests the likelihood of multiplexed modes of signaling in
which single cells may influence downstream activity via a
combination of slow-acting neuropeptide release and fast-acting
classical neurotransmitter release. Indeed, a growing suite of
fluorescent sensor tools for detecting receptor signaling with the
cell-type resolution at rapid timescales may prove revolutionary
for elucidating the sleep/wake mechanisms of neuropeptide
release and actions across synaptic and extrasynaptic sites of the
BNST circuitry (Gizowski et al., 2016; Patriarchi et al., 2018; Sun
et al., 2018).
FUNCTIONALLY-DEFINED BNST CELL
TYPES
Hedonic Valence
The BNST is known to impact both positive and negative states
of reward and stress, and early studies relied primarily on
electrolytic and neurochemical lesions to generate several
opposing
hypotheses
regarding
the
bi-valent
emotional
behaviors generated by activity in the BNST (Bangasser
et al., 2005; Pezuk et al., 2008; Resstel et al., 2008). Access
to
molecularly-defined
cell
types
enabled
by
modern
neurotechnology has ushered in several recent advances in
understanding the sources of hedonic valence in the BNST,
beginning with studies from the Stuber group showing that
optical stimulation of Vgat-BNST and Vglut2-BNST neurons
produced approach and avoidance behaviors, respectively
(Jennings et al., 2013a,b).
Going beyond the separation of large populations of
GABAergic vs. glutamatergic neurons, additional tools for
recording and modulating cell-specific neural activity in vivo
revealed that dlBNST Crf
neurons preferentially respond
to aversive stimuli and drive behavioral avoidance, whereas
dmBNST Cck neurons are activated by rewarding stimuli
and generate behavioral preference/approach (Giardino et al.,
2018). Mirroring this lateral/medial functional distinction,
Drd1 neurons in the ovBNST/dlBNST and Six3 neurons in
the dmBNST also drive avoidance and approach, respectively
(Giardino et al., 2018). Because activation of the global Vgat-
BNST population promotes positive valence (Jennings et al.,
2013a,b; Giardino et al., 2018), we hypothesize that Crf marks
a specialized subgroup of lateral Vgat-BNST neurons with
opposing functional properties from the larger set of combined
lateral and medial Vgat-BNST cells. In other words, global
Vgat-BNST stimulation may more closely resemble activation of
medial Vgat-BNST neurons (like Cck) rather than lateral Vgat-
BNST neurons (like Crf ).
It should be noted that the vast majority of data on
BNST circuits driving hedonic valence has been generated only

BNST Neurocircuitry of Emotional Arousal
from male mice. Given that the BNST is a major site for
integrating signals from centrally-circulating gonadal steroids,
intense investigation of hormonal influences on the function of
extended amygdala pathways may be key for understanding sex
differences in the stress response and reward sensitivity. Future
studies may also seek to titrate levels of stressor exposure, drug
consumption, and other variables to determine whether such
experiential factors can influence the hedonic valence associated
with mobilization of particular BNST subpopulations.
Anxiety
Despite the distinct hedonic valences associated with stimulating
Crf and Cck BNST neurons, optogenetic or chemogenetic
activation of either Crf or Cck BNST neurons led to increased
indices of anxiety-like behavior in multiple paradigms (Giardino
et al., 2018), suggesting that standard measures of ‘‘anxiety’’
in rodents may reflect generalized arousal states independent
of hedonic valence per se. Consistent with this interpretation,
activation of Vgat-BNST neurons (Mazzone et al., 2018), Drd1-
ovBNST neurons (Kim et al., 2013), Pdyn-BNST→VTA neurons
(Fellinger et al., 2020), dlBNST→CeA neurons (Yamauchi
et al., 2018), and Crf -CeA→dlBNST neurons (Pomrenze
et al., 2019b) all increased anxiety-like behaviors. Yet, separate
studies found that stimulation of adBNST→LH neurons
(Kim et al., 2013), Vgat-vBNST→VTA neurons (Jennings
et al., 2013b), and Sst-BNST→NAcSh neurons (Xiao et al.,
2020) had the opposite effect of reducing anxiety, revealing
some unresolved issues regarding how BNST microcircuits
and long-range pathways regulate stress-related ‘‘anxiety’’
phenotypes. Anxiogenic circumstances like fear learning and
stress-induced social deficits also strongly engage the BNST
(Bjorni et al., 2020; Emmons et al., 2021), providing multiple
perspectives for approaching the study of BNST in anxiety-
related emotional arousal.
THE BNST IN SLEEP, WAKE, AND
EMOTIONAL AROUSAL
Only a handful of studies have explicitly investigated the
BNST within the context of sleep/wake arousal states and
corresponding neurophysiological rhythms. Beginning in 1995,
in vivo recordings of 63 single units in the BNST of cats
revealed that 72% of neurons fired more frequently during
wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than
during ‘‘quiet sleep’’ (presumably non-REM/slow-wave sleep;
NREM; Terreberry et al., 1995). These findings are consistent
with more recent data indicating that excitatory projections
from the BNST may activate REM-active neurons in the
sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD) of the brainstem
(Boissard et al., 2003; Rodrigo-Angulo et al., 2008). In the
BNST of rats, sleep deprivation increased cFos and CRF
protein expression (Duan et al., 2005; Deurveilher et al., 2008)
and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene expression
(Kushida et al., 1995), suggesting possible neuropeptidergic
and cholinergic mechanisms for homeostatic sleep drive in
the BNST.
In
2014,
an
intriguing
arousal-related
physiological
signature
was
discovered
in
the
extended
amygdala
by
Haufler
and
Pare
(2014),
who
recorded
high-frequency
oscillations (HFOs; 110–160 Hz local field potentials) that
appeared with a significantly higher incidence in the BNST
and CeA relative to surrounding areas (striatum, pallidum,
septum; Haufler and Pare, 2014). HFOs in hippocampal,
cortical, and subthalamic brain regions are thought to have
functional
consequences
in
memory-processing,
epileptic
seizures, and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, respectively.
Whereas the role of HFOs in the BNST remains unclear, their
ability to entrain large populations of neurons (with greater
power during REM vs. non-REM sleep; Haufler and Pare,
2014) provides a fascinating example of the network-level
changes in extended amygdala activity that might profoundly
influence discrete states of arousal. Future endeavors will
revolutionize understanding of how arousal state transitions
may be aligned to physiological activity changes and/or
receptor signaling events in a BNST cell type-specific manner
by implementing combinatorial approaches like EEG/EMG
sleep monitoring in tandem with next-generation neural
recording technologies (fiber photometry, miniscope, and
two-photon imaging).
To directly investigate the BNST as a potential node
in the arousal circuitry, Kodani et al. (2017, 2019) utilized
optogenetic methods and reported that they could generate
immediate transitions from NREM sleep to wakefulness by
stimulating the global GABAergic BNST population in Gad67-
Cre mice. Gad67-BNST arousal was associated with activation
of norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus (NE-LC), an
established wakefulness-promoting center. Gad67-BNST arousal
was also associated with activation of Hcrt-LH neurons and
required signaling of Hcrt receptors (Kodani et al., 2017),
consistent with the reported contributions of BNST→LH circuits
to emotional arousal and related behaviors (Giardino and
de Lecea, 2014; González et al., 2016; Giardino et al., 2018;
Barbier et al., 2021). Of course, the precise directionalities
of
the
relationships
between
endogenous
BNST
activity,
emotional behaviors, and changes in sleep and wakefulness
remain mostly uncharacterized. For example, whereas states
of stress might be hypothesized to drive insomnia via
chronically elevated BNST hyperactivity, additional experiments
are required to determine whether excess BNST activity is truly
a contributing factor or rather an indirect consequence of stress-
induced arousal.
In
addition
to
providing
outputs
to
wake-promoting
downstream targets in the LH, VTA, and PVN, the BNST
also receives inputs from arousal-promoting neurons such as
calretinin cells of the paraventricular thalamus (PVT; Hua et al.,
2018). Hua et al. (2018) recently found that starvation promotes
a state of hyperarousal via activation of the PVT-calretinin
circuit, which can be blocked by chemogenetic inhibition of the
PVT→BNST pathway. Despite this exciting progress, a complete
understanding of the arousal-promoting abilities of the global
GABAergic BNST population requires additional studies. Future
experiments will aim to determine whether distinct molecularly-
defined or pathway-specific BNST outputs are necessary and/or

BNST Neurocircuitry of Emotional Arousal
sufficient for regulating various forms of behavioral arousal and
natural sleep-to-wake transitions (see hypothesized functions in
Figure 1C).
On this note, it will be important to causally determine
which BNST neurocircuits have experience-dependent effects
on sleep/wake as a function of negative vs. positive hedonic
valence. This can be accomplished by monitoring the activities
of extended amygdala pathways and corresponding changes
in arousal following emotional experiences with ethologically
aversive or rewarding stimuli. For example, the discovery that
reward-promoting Cck-BNST neurons are densely connected
with the medial amygdala (MeA; Giardino et al., 2018) suggests
that these pathways powerfully influence arousal changes
linked to innately rewarding consummatory behaviors. In
contrast to the Cck-BNST→MeA circuit, Crf-BNST→Hcrt-
LH connections likely drive stress-induced insomnia following
psychosocial challenges.
Given the well-established role of the BNST in drug-seeking
behavior (Vranjkovic et al., 2017), attention should be placed
on the idea that addiction-related sleep disturbances are driven
by specific extended amygdala pathways. Core features of
drug addiction (e.g., craving, relapse, and withdrawal) are
each associated with maladaptive neuroplasticity in homeostatic
circuits that regulate sleep/wake cycles and stress sensitivity,
illustrating how addiction can be viewed as a condition of
pathological hyperarousal (Koob, 2013; Koob and Colrain,
2020). Substance use disorders are highly co-morbid with
other arousal-related psychiatric conditions (e.g., insomnia,
anxiety, PTSD, panic), and the BNST may be a common
substrate linking dysregulated hedonic processing to chronic
sleep disruption.
Finally, the BNST may be an important and overlooked
link in emotional arousal about the sleep disorder narcolepsy
with cataplexy (in which powerful feelings of euphoria or
aversion can interrupt wakefulness by triggering rapid intrusion
of a sleep-like state). Intriguingly, narcolepsy is associated
with selective loss of Hcrt neurons in the LH. Based on
existing evidence for BNST→LH connections driving motivated
behaviors, detailed studies are warranted on BNST circuit
contributions to emotionally-triggered arousal destabilization.
Of course, the existence of putative sleep-promoting BNST
neurons remains to be seen. However, BNST connections
with hypothalamic nuclei regulating the release of prolactin,
oxytocin, and vasopressin suggest that experiments linking
BNST activity to arousal changes following binge eating (‘‘food
coma’’) and sexual behavior (mating) may be successful in
revealing the neurocircuitry of mysterious phenomena like
post-ingestive sleep, post-copulatory sleep, and narcolepsy
with cataplexy.
CONCLUSIONS
Altogether, our understanding of extended amygdala circuits
regulating affective behaviors will have direct relevance to
therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating motivation and
sleep/wake regulation. Before the advent of tools permitting cell
type-specific and pathway-specific labeling and manipulation,
the inherent complexity of extended amygdala pathways
hindered progress in understanding their roles in emotional
arousal. As BNST circuits continue to be disentangled at
the genetic, synaptic, and systems levels, new anatomical and
functional frameworks are taking shape that illustrates the
multifaceted nature of the BNST. Data of this kind are extremely
valuable for developing new therapeutic approaches for a range
of neuropsychiatric conditions, highlighting the extraordinary
relevance of emotional arousal circuits to researchers and
clinicians across the fields of neuroscience, genetics, psychology,
and mental health interventions. We anticipate that as studies on
BNST function become more precise, effective clinical treatment
strategies will be successfully developed.
