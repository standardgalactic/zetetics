Altermagnets (AM) are a recently discovered third class of collinear magnets, distinctly different
from conventional ferromagnets (FM) and antiferromagnets (AF) [1–3].
AM have been actively
researched in the last few years, but two aspects so far remain unaddressed: (1) Are there realistic
2D single-layer altermagnets? And (2) is it possible to functionalize a conventional AF into AM
by external stimuli? In this paper we address both issues by demonstrating how a well-known 2D
AF, MnP(S,Se)3 can be functionalized into strong AM by applying out-of-plane electric field. Of
particular interest is that the induced altermagnetism is of a higher even-parity wave symmetry
than expected in 3D AM with similar crystal symmetries. We confirm our finding by first-principles
calculations of the electronic structure and magnetooptical response. We also propose that recent
observations of the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the famous Fe-based superconducting chal-
chogenides, either in monolayer form[4] or in the surface layer[5–7], may be related not to an FM, as
previously assumed, but to the induced 2D AM order. Finally, we show that monolayer FeSe can si-
multaneously exhibit unconventional altermagnetic time-reversal symmetry breaking and quantized
spin Hall conductivity indicating possibility to research an intriquing interplay of 2D altermagnetism
with topological and superconducting states within a common crystal-potential environment.
I.
INTRODUCTION
One of a longest misconception in condensed matter
physics, which was shattered only a few years ago, is
that compensated collinear magnets cannot break time-
reversal symmetry (TRS) in electronic structure. In fact,
anomalous magnetic response resulting from TRS break-
ing, such as anomalous Hall effect or magnetooptical Kerr
effect (MOKE) have been routinely used to identify fer-
romagnets (FM) whenewer direct measurements of mag-
netization are impractical (e.g., Ref. [8]). Recently, un-
conventional TRS breaking with a zero net magnetisation
and colinear magnetic order was theoretically proposed
[9, 10]. The unconventional TRS breaking was predicted
to lead to an unconventional anomalous Hall effect[9–12]
which was also experimentally verified[13–15].
The universality of the unconventional TRS breaking
was recognized by symmetry delineation of a third funda-
mental type of magnetism in addition to ferromagnetism
and antiferromagnetism[1]. The third phase, altermag-
netism, is sharply distinct from both conventional ferro-
magnetism, and antiferromagnetism [1, 2]. Ferromagnets
(and ferrimagnets) do not feature any symmetry opera-
tion that would connect opposite spin channels and thus
can have a net magnetization. In conventional antifer-
romagnets, among the symmetry operations that map
one spin sublattice onto the opposite sublattice is a lat-
tice translation and/or inversion[2, 16].
On the con-
trary, in altermagnets, the opposite spin densities are
not connected by a simple lattice translation or inver-
sion but are connected by a lattice rotational symme-
try (for instance, a four-fold rotation, mirror or a glide
plane)[1, 17]. The resulting altermagnetic spin splitting
of the bands changes signs in a manner determined by
symmetry and breaks TRS, but the magnetisation inte-
grates to zero over the entire Brillouin zone.
The symmetries of altermagnetic d-wave spin channels
are a clear analogy with unconventional d-wave supercon-
ductors. In the superconducting case, the phase of the
order parameter usually (albeit not always, cf. nematic
superconductivity) has a lower symmetry than its abso-
lute value (the excitation gap). For example, in tetrag-
onal superconductors, the order parameter may have a
d-wave symmetry (as in high-Tc cuprates), while the ex-
citation gap has the full tetragonal, i.e., the s-wave sym-
metry. Using the classification of Sigrist and Ueda[18],
such a state has a Γ+
3 or a Γ+
4 representation.
Possi-
ble types of AM can be classified analogically, revealing
d, g, or i-wave alternating spin channel polarisation in
electronic structure [1].
Curiously, altermagnetism shares some properties with
AF and even more with FM[1, 3, 19, 20], while it exhibits
also unique properties on their own [1, 9, 21–28]. Re-
markably, some of the unique anomalous and spin cur-
rents were experimentally already indicated[13–15, 26,
29, 30]. Photoemission evidence of altermagnetism was
reported in circular dichroism[31], direct band-splitting
measurements [32–34], and band spin splitting measure-
ments [32].
The classification of AM states employed develop-
ment of spin symmetries[35], i.e., pairs of symmetries
in spin and coordinate space[36], which has allowed also
identification of numerous real-world materials.
No-
tably, a great majority of those have either dxy or g-
wave symmetries, respectively, in tetragonal and hexag-
onal families.

polarisation[19]) or i-wave altermagnets are exceedingly
rare, where only a few model examples of the former have
been suggested[14, 19, 35, 37]. The most commonly stud-
ied altermagnetic candidates, such as RuO2, MnTe, or
Mn5Si3, are all bulk three-dimensional centrosymmetric
crystals. It is thus natural to ask whether we can iden-
tify realistic altermagnetic materials in 2D and without
inversion symmetry [35, 37].
In the present manuscript, we demonstrate a novel
route towards two-dimensional altermagnetism. We show
that monolayer antiferromagnets with space-time inver-
sion symmetry PT can be functionalized into an alter-
magnetic state by, for instance, an electric field, a mech-
anism starkly different from the existing protocols focus-
ing on spontaneous altermagnetic ordering in bulk crys-
tals. In Fig. 1 we show that the out-of-plane electric field
from gating, chemical substitution of elements (”Janu-
sization”), or substrate influence (or surface effects), can
break the PT symmetry while preserving altermagnetic
point-group symmetries such as mirror planes connecting
the opposite spin channels.
The resulting altermagnetic bandstructure can as-
sume the two-dimensional elusive i-wave and dx2−y2-
wave form, as we demonstrate using real material sys-
tems:
MnP(S,Se)3 and FeSe monolayers with an al-
termagnetic spin splittings as large as ∼100 meV. We
also show that these two-dimensional altermagnets can
host strong TRS breaking response manifested via large
magneto-optical Kerr angles, and can explain recent ex-
periments on monolayer and surface FeSe that indicated
the presence of time-reversal symmetry breaking.
Fi-
nally, we remark that as Fe-based superconductors are
possible candidates for topological superconductivity[38–
40], our identification of altermagnetic time-reversal sym-
metry breaking and spin splitting in FeSe opens a dis-
tinct unconventional route towards possible realization
of topological superconductivity[41, 42]. Unlike the re-
cent model proposals [41, 42], here we realize the required
altermagnetic time-reversal symmetry breaking intrinsi-
cally in the realistic crystal potential of superconducting
monolayer FeSe.

RESULTS: MnP(S,Se)3
A.
General Considerations
MnPCh3 (where Mn can be substituted by other mag-
netic 3d ions, and the chalcogene Ch can be Se or S or
a mixture of both) is a rather unique family of van der
Waals materials, easily exfoliable: they form, as opposed
to most other 2D magnets, an antiferromagnetic pattern,
corresponding to the standard collinear N´eel order on the
honeycomb lattice (analogues with other 3d metals may
have different patterns, but here we concentrate on the
Mn compound [43]).
This in-plane antiferromagnetism is different from the
A-type AF found in several other 2D van der Waals com-
pounds, such as CrI3 (in a bilayer), CrSBr, MnBi2Te4,
etc., where individual layers order ferromagnetically, but
stack antiferromagnetically. In a single layer they are all
FM, but in bilayers are AF — as long as the two part-
ner layers are symmetry-equivalent. If this symmetry is
broken, for instance, by electric field gating, they become
inequivalent, and thus formally ferrimagnetic (whether or
not they have a nonzero net magnetization). As ferrimag-
nets, they break TRS, and, in particular, have Kramers
degeneracy lifted everywhere in the Brillouin zone (see
Fig. 1a,c). This effect has been observed experimentally
in gated MnBi2Te4 [44].
With this in mind, one may ask a question, what would

happen if a similar experiment were performed on a single
layer AF, MnPCh3, where an individual plane is an AF?
To answer this question, we need to take a closer look at
its crystal structure (Fig. 1(e) and 2(a)). It has the space
group #162, P¯31m. One can see that there are multiple
symmetry operations that map one spin sublattice onto
the other (and many that don’t): inversion centers P
between the nearest neighbor Mn-Mn bond, and in the
centers of the Mn hexagons, as well as vertical mirrors M
perpendicular to the Mn-Mn bonds and passing through
P’s. In addition, there are a 3-fold proper rotations C3
as indicated in Fig. 2(a).
As discussed in the Introduction, the presence of spin-
transposing (flipping) inversions ensures Kramers’ degen-
eracy and excludes an AM. Intriguingly, breaking the
PT symmetry (an inversion mapping one spin sublat-
tice onto the other)) lifts the Kramers’ degeneracy, but
the two opposite-spin Mn sites remain mapped to each
other through the Mx mirror. This is the principal dif-
ference from the previously discussed A-type bilayer case
because there the two spin sublattices upon electric field
are crystallographically inequivalent. In the current case
the opposite spin sublattices are upon gating crystallo-
graphically locally equivalent, but globally inequivalent
as they are mapped on top of each other by mirror and
not by inversion or translation.
B.
Practical implementations
We will now discuss possible routes to effect the
symmetry breaking discussed above.
One possibility,
used previously to generate a ferrimagnetic response in
MnBi2Te4[44], is to apply a static electric field perpen-
dicular to the Mn plane.
Such gating breaks the PT
symmetry in two different ways: first, it shifts the two
Ch and two P layers in the same direction with respect
to the Mn plane. Indeed, full optimization of MnPSe3
in an external electric field of 1 eV/˚A(see the Methods
sections for details) resulted in about 0.11(0.13)˚A dispar-
ity between the heights of Se(P) atoms below and above
Mn — a sizeable difference. Second, even if the struc-
ture is not re-optimized, the addition (subtraction) of an
electrostatic potential above (below) the Mn layer ren-
ders the two Se layers crystallographically inequivalent,
breaking the PT symmetry. Note that the crystal sym-
metry is then lowered from P¯31m to just P31m, #157.
The resulting spin splitting can be as strong as 25 meV
as we show in Fig. 2(b).
Let us now turn to the angular symmetry discussed

4
in the Introduction.
The symmetry in the real space
translates into the same symmetry operation present in
the reciprocal space (for each spin and for even partial
waves). Let us consider, for instance, a known hexagonal
3D AM, MnTe (see inset of Fig. 2(a,c) and Fig. 5). It ex-
hibits [C2||C6t] nonsymmorphic screw axis and [C2||Mzt]
mirror plane.
Therefore the spin splitting follows the
same symmetry in the reciprocal space, i.e., changes sign
at the kz →−kz transformation, and is invariant under
a threefold rotation in the kx, ky plane. The lowest sym-
metry representations satisfying these condition are the
Γ+
3 , Γ+
4 mentioned above with the bulk B-4 g-symmetry
and characteristic angular dependencies of kzky(3k2
x−k2
y)
and kzkx(3k2
y −k2
x). This is indeed the AM state that is
being realized in MnTe[1].
The PT symmetry of MnPCh3 gets broken if the two
Ch layers are not equivalent, so one may expect that
the band structure in the momentum space will only be
threefold (C3) symmetric. However, since in the absence
of the spin-orbit coupling the electronic structure in the
momentum space for a given spin has to be inversion-
symmetric, Ekσ = E−kσ, the symmetry of the system
enhances to a sixfold rotation.
Furthermore, in a 2D
system, it cannot depend on kz, therefore the electronic
structure for a given spin channel cannot follow the g-
wave symmetry, as in the bulk case. Instead, the result-
ing C6 symmetry, using the terminology introduced in
Ref. [35], generates a planar class P-6 with the angular
i-wave symmetry of Γ+
2 , discussed in the introduction,
which has 6 nodal lines in the spin splitting, as seen in
Fig. 2b.
The two Ch layers can be also made inequivalent in an-
other way, not requiring gating, namely “janusization”.
Under janusization we mean synthesizing a mixed S-Se
compound of the formula Mn2P2S3Se3, where all S atoms
are below the Mn plane, and all Se above (or there is just
a disbalance between the S/Se ratios above and below).
Such Janus layers are well known in the physics of tran-
sition metal dichalcogenides[45]. In order to check the
scale of the effect in this case, we have, again, optimized
such a Janus structure (the space group is, of course,
the same, P31m). In Fig. 7(b) we show the calculated
band structure for the Janus case. We calculate the en-
ergy bands without SOC (the red and blue colours in
Fig. 7(b)) and with SOC for two different orientations of
the spin quantisation axes. The magnetic symmetry for
the in-plane system allows for an anomalous Hall effect
and magnetooptical Kerr effect. We show in Fig. 2(d)
the calculated Kerr angle. The maximum value of the
Kerr angle reaches 0.4 degrees, which corresponds to the
order of magnitude of the Kerr angle in elemental ferro-
magnets with strong magnetization. In the present case,
the origin of the effect is the altermagnetic time-reversal
symmetry breaking caused by the combined effect of an-
tiferromagnetism and Janusization.
Finally, we point out a third realization of the alter-
magnetic splitting MnPCh3: engineering a heterostruc-
ture of MnPCh3 with another 2D material.
In fact,
the lattice parameter a = 6.07 ˚A of MnPS3 closely
matches that of a well known van der Waals semicon-
ductor, MoTe2, with a′ = 3.52 ˚A. Note the a′√
3 = 6.09,
matching a within 0.3%. The resulting heterostructure,
shown in Fig. 1(e), has the formula Mn2P2S6Mo3Te6.
The calculated electronic structure (Fig. 7(a)) is semi-
conducting, with the gap formed by MoTe2 states, but
deeper lying states are derived from Mn and show size-
able spin splitting (and measurable magneto-optical re-
sponse in the corresponding frequency range).
III.
Fe(Se,Te)
A.
General Considerations
FeSe-FeTe alloys are among the most intriguing Fe-
based superconductors. Pure bulk FeSe shows no mag-
netic transition, but a nematic transition, often associ-
ated with stripe (Q = π, 0) spin fluctuations, and den-
sity functional theory (DFT) calculations result in the
mean field ground state breaking the C4 symmetry with
Q = π, π/2 and nearly degenerates with similar states
at Q = π, κ, 0 ≤κ ≤π/2[46].
FeTe forms a unique
double-stripe structure corresponding to Q = π/2, π/2.
The mixed alloys FeSexTe1−x have the highest supercon-
ducting critical temperature when x ≈0.5, and there is
no long-range ordered magnetism in this range.
Arguably the most intriguing member of this family is
the single-layer FeSe grown epitaxially on SrTiO3[47]. It
was claimed to have a critical temperature close to 100
K, when optimally doped, and is insulating and prob-
ably magnetic when undoped.
Interestingly, standard
DFT calculations, even with Hubbard correlation added
on a static (LDA+U) or dynamic (LDA+DMFT) level,
fail to reproduce the experimentally observed Fermi sur-
face. Indeed, the latter shows rather reduced compared
to DFT electron pockets around the M points in the Bril-
louin zone and does not have any hole pockets around the
Γ point at all.
It was observed that imposing, on the other hand,
the checkerboard order (Q = π, π) onto the single
layer of FeSe leads to a considerable reduction of the
Γ pocket, and, upon applying a static U, to its full
disappearance[48, 49].
Given that in all known Fe-
based superconductors LDA+U considerably worsens the
agreement with the experiment in such a fundamental
property as magnetic moment, this improvement of the
Fermi surface may be (and likely is) fortuitous, simulat-
ing some unknown physics beyond DFT. Still, it is useful
as a mechanical tool to emulate experimental fermiology.
One important piece of information that one must keep
in mind is that DFT calculation provides an approximate
hierarchy of magnetic orders. While there might be quan-
titative corrections to the latter, on the qualitative level
it must be reliable. Specifically, DFT calculations pre-
dict the ground state of all Fe-based superconductors to
be single stripe, with the exception of FeTe which is cor-

rectly predicted to have double stripes. The checkerboard
state is always higher in energy. The ferromagnetic state
often cannot even be stabilized, and if it can, it is much
higher in energy. For instance, for a fully re-optimized
FeSe monolayer, the penalty for the checkerboard struc-
ture is 26 meV/Fe, and for the FM one 68 meV/Fe, as
calculated in VASP. A corollary is that while it is not
unimaginable that Fe(Se,Te) in a monolayer form, or
in the surface layer, has a checkerboard magnetic order
(even though in DFT it is somewhat higher in energy),
a ferromagnetic layer simply cannot form. We will need
this corollary later.
From the point of view of magnetic symmetry, stripe
(or double stripe) order in Fe(Se,Te) is not AM since the
spin-mapping operation is a lattice translation. On the
other hand, the checkerboard order in a single Fe(Se,Te)
layer, while also not AM, has as the mapping interac-
tion spatial inversion, as well as Mxy and M¯xy mirrors,
see Fig. 3(a). Because of the latter, breaking inversion
symmetry will make the material a textbook AM. Very
similar to the case of MnPCh3, making the chalcogenide
layers above and below Fe inequivalent breaks the inver-
sion symmetry, converting the checkerboard AF structure
into AM.
The symmetry analysis immediately shows that it be-
longs to the planar d-wave symmetry class called P-2 in
Ref. [35], with the basis functions x2 −y2 as confirmed
in our calculations in Fig. 3(b) for the electrically gated
monolayer.
We will now demonstrate, that switching on spin-orbit
coupling in our calculations can generate topologically
nontrivial splitting at the M-point. For simplicity, and
because here we need only a demonstration of the prin-
ciple, we take now a single FeSe monolayer and shift Se
layers so as to have the Se heights consistent with the
fully optimized heterostructure with STO. In Fig. 3(c)
we show the altermagnetic spin splitting around M-point
calculated without spin-orbit coupling.
We see clear
dxy altermagnetic spin splitting which is consistent with
our results for the electrically gated monolayer shown in
Fig. 3(b).
In Fig. 3(d) we show the corresponding band struc-
ture calculated with spin-orbit coupling and moments
along [001] direction. We observe an opening of a band
gap at M-point akin to the calculations for the undis-
turbed monolayer with checkerboard order. The mono-
layer of checkerboard FeSe exhibits space-time symmetry
and was predicted to exhibit quantized spin Hall conduc-
tivity and higher order band-topology related to the pres-
ence of T C4 symmetry[39, 50]. When the moments are in
the altermagnetic state oriented along out-of-plane direc-
tion we preserve the T C4 symmetry and also we observe
nonzero spin polarisation accumulated in the valence and
conduction band only along the out-of-plane axes. Thus
we expect that the altermagnetic state will preserve the
nontrivial topology of spin-orbit coupling induced band-
gap at the M-point. This conjecture is confirmed by our
calculation of spin Hall conductivity shown in Fig. 3(d).
The spin Hall conductivity exhibits a quantized plateau
in the energy region corresponding to the topologically
nontrivial band gap at the M-point.
We also confirm
the quantum spin Hall effect by calculating nontrivial
spin Chern numbers for the valence band by the Prodan
method [51].
We have thus demonstrated the possibility of combin-
ing nontrivial band-topology with unconventional time-
reversal symmetry breaking in an experimentally known
superconducting monolayer.
We will now move on to
analyse recent puzzling experiments indicating the time-
reversal symmetry breaking in Fe-based monolayers.

conducting Fe(Se,Te) compositions[5, 7].
A natural
interpretation[5–7] would be in terms of surface ferro-
magnetism; however, as mentioned above, it is the least
likely of possible magnetic orders.
Let us take a closer look at the evidence for TRS break-
ing reported in these papers. First, in Ref. [4] the dispar-
ity of the electron energy loss function (EELS) for spin-
up and spin-down polarized electrons was measured, and
a non-zero asymmetry was found. For instance, for the
incidence energy of ∼2 eV an asymmetry close to 10%
was detected in the energy range of 0–200 meV. Impor-
tantly, exactly the same asymmetry was observed in the
electronic background and in two phonon peaks, which
indicates that it is not due to the potential presence of
asymmetric charge excitation (chiral plasmon) but to the
electron-photon dipole vertex.
In the original paper[4], a model was proposed to in-
terpret the observed chirality in a manner similar to pre-
viously known spin-asymmetry of the polarized electron
diffraction (elastic scattering). Without discussing this
model, we want to point out that EELS is directly related
to the imaginary part of the inverse dielectric function,
−Im[1/ϵ(ω)], as shown schematically in the diagram in
Fig. 4(b). The matrix element denoted by a triangle is by
definition the same as the vortex describing the screening
of electromagnetic interaction by electrons. With bro-
ken TRS and spin-orbit coupling the response may, but
does not have to, become chiral. It manifests itself in
magneto-optics as well as in EELS, as different responses
for left- or right-polarized light, or for spin-up and spin-
down electrons. The scale of these effects is set by the
non-diagonal part of the dielectric function.
However,
for the former the relevant frequency range corresponds
to the frequency at which the magnetooptical response
is measured; for the latter, however, what matters is not
the dielectric function at ω, where 0 < ω ≲200 meV
is the energy loss, but for the incoming electron energy
Ω> 2 eV.
Rather different evidence exists for the TRS breaking
in the surface layer of Fe(Se,Te) with approximately 50:50
chalcogene content[5, 7]. Below we will concentrate on
Ref. [5], where MOKE was measured directly, and found
to be small (Kerr angle on the order of 10−4 degree),
but still measurable. This TRS breaking was interpreted
as ferrimagnetism in the surface layer [Fe(Se,Te) being
a van der Waals material, it is highly unlikely to have a
deeper level differ from the bulk in any substantial way].
It is worth noting that the penetration depth of light is
≳102 interlayer distances, so whatever effect appears in
the single surface layer it will be diluted by two orders of
magnitude, or even more.
C.
Interpretation in terms of altermagnetism
Here we address the question of whether van der Waals
coupling to the SrTiO3 substrate or the under-surface
Fe(Se,Te) layer is strong enough to introduce measurable
violation of Kramers degeneracy and sizeable nondiag-
onal response. This question can be answered by direct
calculations which we will now discuss in connection with
the experiment.
As Fig. 4(a) shows, for the FeSe/SrTiO3 structure
there is a noticeable spin splitting
100 meV in the
Fe bands, including those at high energies, relevant to
EELS. Thus, the sensitivity to the electron spin in this
experiment can be simply related to the AM character of
the FeSe layer due to symmetry-breaking by the SrTiO3
substrate. Note that it is consistent with the requirement
of a sizeable SOC emphasized in Ref. [4] (otherwise there
would not be any nondiagonal component in the diagram
in Fig. 4)(b)) and elucidates altermagnetic band splitting
as the microscopic origin of the effect.
Let us now consider the Fe(Se,Te) surface. Because of
the Se-Te disorder straightforward DFT calculations are
implausible, so we have calculated instead stoichiometric
FeSe. No qualitative difference is expected with partial
substitution of Se by Te. We have optimized a slab of 6
FeSe layers, consisting of two surfaces and 4 bulk layers.
In Fig. 5 we show the calculated energy bands of the slab
with manifest altermagnetic spin splitting. In Fig. 5(b)
we plot the Kerr angle calculation. We can see a large
Kerr angle on the order of 0.05–0.1 degrees, three orders

of magnitude larger than in the experiment.
As men-
tioned above, this is understandable because the penetra-
tion depth is much larger than three layers, and multiple
altermagnetic domains[9] can reduce the observed signal
considerably. Thus, the observed Kerr rotation does not
require a much more energetically unfavorable surface
ferromagnetism but can be more naturally explained by
assuming a checkerboard order in the surface layer, which
leads to altermagnetic time-reversal symmetry breaking.
IV.
CONCLUSION
To conclude, we have presented a novel route toward
altermagnetic orders in space-time symmetric monolayer
antiferromagnets MnPSe3 and FeSe, by various means
of making the top and bottom ligand layers structurally
inequivalent. The symmetry lowering breaks the space-
time symmetry but can preserve the mirror symmetries
that protect the altermagnetic state. We have discussed
three different mechanisms: application of out-of-plane
electric field, Janusization, i.e., making the top and bot-
tom ligand layers in the structure chemically distinct,
and, finally, interfacing the 2D magnet with another
system that makes ligand layers crystallographically in-
equivalent.
We have also calculated magneto-optical response,
which can serve as a probe of the time-reversal symmetry
breaking in 2D altermagnetism. In the case of MnPSe3
we predict a large Kerr angle of up to 0.4 degrees. In the
case of FeSe we find that the symmetry breaking caused
by the STO substrate or by the symmetry-breaking sur-
face (including asymmetric atomic relaxation) can pro-
vide an alternative explanation for the recently reported
chiral electron energy loss spectroscopy, and MOKE, re-
spectively.
Finally, we have demonstrated that the 2d altermag-
netism in FeSe is compatible with a quantized quantum
spin Hall conductivity, opening prospects for studying al-
termagnetism, topological states and superconductivity
in two dimensions.
METHODS
Most first-principles DFT calculations were performed
using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)
[52], with selective tests utilizing the all-electron linear
augmented waves package WIEN2k[53] for comparison.
The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the
Perdew Burke Ernzerhof functional (PBE) [54] was uti-
lized to account for the exchange-correlation interaction.
For Mn, we included, as typical for Mn2+ ions, a Hub-
bard U term in the fully-localized LDA+U limit, and in
spherically symmetric approximation Ueff = U −J = 4
eV. Up to 100 MnP(S,Se)3 bands (correspondingly more
for the heterostructure) were included in the optical cal-
culations, and the frequencies up to 5 eV, with the K-
meshes up to 26x26 in the 2D Brillouin zone. The cut-off
energy was 170 eV, and the p-states of Mn were included
as valence states.
As discussed in the main text, while adding a a Hub-
bard U interaction for FeSe is more questionable, we
were motivated by the need to emulate the experimental
Fermiology and included in our calculations Ueff = 0.5
eV; the cutoff energy for the final calculation was 460
eV, the number of bands 240 and the optical calculations
parameters were the same as in MnP(S,Se)3.
To study the spin transport properties, the Wannier90
code [55] was utilized to construct a Wannier Hamilto-
nian.
The intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) was
computed by integrating the spin Berry curvature on a
dense 320x320x1 grid within the first Brillouin zone. This
simulation was carried out using the linres code [56].
