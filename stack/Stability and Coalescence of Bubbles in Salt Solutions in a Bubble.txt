Abstract 
Salts are known to inhibit bubble coalescence at the concentration greater than a critical 
(transition) concentration. The phenomenon of bubble coalescence governs the size distribution of 
bubbles, which is vital to many natural and industrial processes including mass transfer in the ocean, 
multiphase reactors and mineral recovery in froth flotation.  Despite intensive studies over nearly a 
century resulting in multiple hypotheses, mechanisms of the coalescence inhibition are still unclear. 
Researchers have greatly agreed that it is the liquid films between bubbles that control the coalescence 
and must be firstly understood. Surprisingly, most studies have just focused on the bubble tests, but 
there was a lack of comprehensive studies about the liquid films in a surfactant-free salt system. This 
thesis aims to provide experimental evidence and extend the current understanding of the liquid film 
stability and coalescence in salt solutions. 
Firstly, the effect of superficial gas velocity (3.5, 10, and 18 mm/s), salt type (NaCl, NaI and 
CsCl) and concentration (0.001M to 3M) on bubble coalescence and gas holdup in a small bubble 
column were studied. For the first time, it was found that the transition concentration for coalescence 
inhibition is not a unique entity of salts as reported but it decreases with increasing gas velocity, 
which highlights the importance of hydrodynamic conditions. The results also confirmed the ion 
specific responses of investigated salts to transition concentration and gas holdup.  
To understand the coalescence, liquid films of the simplest subject, deionised water (DI), were 
studies using the micro-interferometry method with the Sheludko cell. It was showed that films of DI 
water drained very fast and ruptured instantly when two bubbles were first brought into contact. 
However, the film drainage rate and rupture thickness sharply decreased and the film lifetime steeply 
increased with increasing contact time up to 10 min, but then they levelled off. It was argued that the 
phenomenon was due to the migration of inherently dissolved gases which act as the long-range 
hydrophobic attraction. The JC Erickson et al.’ theory of the hydrophobic attraction and the extended 
Stefan-Reynolds models to include the air/water surface mobility were also employed. 
The liquid film study was then extended for salts without a presence of surfactants. Drainage 
and stability of liquid films in different salts (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, CsCl, KNO3, NaClO3, CaCl2, and 
MgSO4) over a wider range of concentration (0.001M - 3M) were studied in the close (saturation) 
Sheludko cell with the strictly controlled saturation level and surface contact time.  Films of all salts 
drained slower and lasted longer with increasing salt concentration. Also, the so-called non-inhibiting 

ii 
 
 
salt, NaClO3, indeed inhibits coalescence at high concentrations (greater than 1M). The effect of the 
DLVO forces was totally ruled out. Based on the correlation between the experimental results and 
the data of oxygen solubility and solution viscosity, it was argued that the weaker hydrophobic force 
with higher salt concentrations was due to a reduction in the concentration of soluble gas. Also, it 
was suggested that the influence of solution viscosity should not be neglected, and the coalescence 
was controlled by multiple mechanisms including dissolved gases and solution viscosity. 
Finally, the drainage of those experimental film results was modelled by using the power law 
for hydrophobic attraction and the extended Stefan-Reynolds to incorporate the surface mobility. 
From the model results, it was convincingly demonstrated that the film surfaces were immobilised by 
salts, which explained the drainage retardation and the increased film stability with increasing salt 
concentration. The results were attributable to the surface viscosity caused by the ion-water 
interaction beneath the air/water interfaces. The impact of hydrophobic forces on the film stability 
was also confirmed but shown not as critical as the surface mobility.  
The outcomes of this work will provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
of bubble coalescence inhibition. As proposed, salts affect the coalescence via multiple mechanisms 
including dissolved gases and surface mobility. In fact, those mechanisms are not separate but 
interrelated. It would be a real challenge to correlate them into a single model but is worthwhile to be 
further investigated.

Chapter 1. Introduction 
1.1. Background to the Research. 
Salts have been known to stabilise bubbles by preventing them from coalescence and been 
subjects for numerous studies over decades. The coalescence inhibition can be observed in the 
improved flotation performance by using saline water (Harvey et al., 2002; Klassen et al., 1963; 
Paulson et al., 1996) which was attributed to the more stable froth with the presence of salts. The high 
surface area of bubbles is also important to many other processes including oxygen dissolution and 
mass transfer of ions from the ocean to the atmosphere (Andreas et al., 2000; Blanchard, 1971; 
Hofmeier et al., 1995; Monahan, 1971; Monahan et al., 1986; Scott, 1975; Thorpe, 1982; Wu, 1979; 
Yuan et al., 2009). Also, the bubble coalescence inhibition is found to be ion specific. It means that 
different cations and anions in the solution will inhibit coalescence differently. The mechanism of 
coalescence inhibition and ion specific effect  has been the topic of many studies in the last four 
decades (Christenson et al., 2008; Craig, 2004; Craig et al., 1993a; Henry et al., 2010; Lessard et al., 
1971; Prince, 1990a, 1990b). 
Several hypotheses have been proposed to understand the ion specificity in bubble coalescence 
inhibition. These hypotheses have considered effects of the surface tension gradient on air/water 
interface due to high concentration of salts (i.e. the Marangoni effect) (Marrucci, 1969; Prince, 1990b; 
Weissenborn et al., 1995, 1996), the influence of increased electrostatic repulsion (Marčelja, 2006), 
hydration force (Pashley, 1981), water structure (Hribar et al., 2002; Lessard et al., 1971), ion affinity 
and accumulation at air/water interfaces (Jungwirth et al., 2002, 2006), and gas solubility (Craig et 
al., 1993b; Weissenborn et al., 1996). Despite many hypotheses proposed, to date there is still little 
agreement on the true mechanism of the ion specificity in the bubble coalescence inhibition. 
The drainage and rupture of a thin liquid film (TLF) formed between two bubbles is a 
prerequisite for coalescence (Marrucci, 1969). So to understand the coalescence, it is necessary to 
explain behaviours of liquid films. Many studies have been undertaken on studying effects of 
surfactants on drainage and stability of liquid films (Angarska et al., 2001; Ivanov, 1980; Karakashev, 
Manev, Tsekov, et al., 2008; Manev et al., 1974; Manev et al., 2005b; Radoëv et al., 1974; Velikov 
et al., 1997). However, studies on drainage and stability of  liquid films in surfactant-free salt solutions 
are limited. From the experimental side, of the few available studies some were carried out either not 
in a suitable and consistent evaporative atmosphere (Karakashev, Nguyen, et al., 2008) or only for 

2 
 
 
one single salt (NaCl) over a narrow range of concentration (Cain et al., 1985; Yaminsky et al., 
2010a). None of the proposed hypotheses discussed above was supported by these experimental 
studies. Some results obtained from the liquid film studies are even contradictory. For example, 
Karakashev et al., (2008c) reported that films of deionised water were unstable and ruptured 
instantaneously whereas Yaminsky et al., (2010a) claimed that water films could last for days. 
Another important feature of the inhibition of bubble coalescence is the transition salt 
concentration. It is well accepted that some salts inhibit coalescence with a transition concentration 
around 0.1 M (for example NaCl), whereas others show no effect up to 0.5M of salts (for example 
NaClO3) (Craig et al., 1993b; Lessard et al., 1971). However, Christenson et al., (2008) showed that 
some salts believed not to inhibit coalescence indeed do at higher concentrations (>1M) and suggested 
that any study on inhibition should use a wider range of salt concentrations. Unfortunately, the 
importance of this finding has been underestimated and not been well considered for further 
investigations. 
1.2. Aims and Objectives 
This work aims to investigate the mechanism of bubble coalescence inhibition by studying 
drainage and stability of thin liquid films in salt solutions. 
The specific objectives of this work are: 
i. To examine effects of hydrodynamic conditions, type and ionic strength of salts on the 
transition concentration for coalescence inhibition and gas hold up. 
ii. To investigate drainage and stability of distilled water liquid films under effects of the 
traditional DLVO (Derjagiun-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) and non-DLVO surface 
forces in vapour-saturated conditions. 
iii. To characterise the influence of surface forces, gas solubility and solution viscosity on 
drainage and stability of thin liquid films in distilled water and salt solutions from 
0.001M to 3M. 
iv. To evaluate drainage and stability of saline liquid films of different salts over a wide 
range of concentration from 0.001M to 3M 

3 
 
 
v. To investigate interfacial forces and mobility of liquid films in low and high 
concentration salt solutions. 
1.3. Hypotheses 
Following hypotheses are proposed based on a review of available literature: 
i. Coalescence of bubbles is governed not only by type and concentration of salts but also 
the superficial velocity of the feeding gas. 
ii. The hydrophobic attraction between film surfaces is due to dissolved gases existing in 
the liquid film. The decrease of coalescence with increasing concentrations may be 
attributable to the reduction in gas concentration in the solution due to the salting-out 
effect. 
iii. Solution viscosity is also of importance to the film drainage due to its potential role as 
a hydrodynamic barrier to prevent bubble surfaces from approaching. 
iv. Surfaces of thin liquid films are partly immobile with increasing salt concentration due 
to interactions between ions and water at the air/solution interfaces. 
v. Thin liquid films of non-inhibiting salts are transient stable if the concentration is high 
enough. 
1.4. Statement of Originality 
The results from this work have not been submitted for a degree in any university and do not 
contain intellectual work published by another person. The original contributions of this work can be 
highlighted as below: 
i. The influence of superficial gas velocity, type and concentration of salts on bubble 
coalescence and gas holdup was investigated. The transition concentration for bubble 
coalescence inhibition was reported to be ion-specific and decreased with increasing gas 
velocity, which was hypothesised to be due to the difference in ion partitions at the interfaces. 
The results also showed that both gas velocity and salt properties influence the transition 
concentration for coalescence inhibition and gas holdup. The study was reported in Chapter 
3. 

4 
 
 
ii. We designed a special experimental method to study effects of vapour saturation and 
hydrophobic attraction on the stability of deionised water films. The results showed that gases 
inherently dissolved in water have a significant effect on the film drainage and rupture. 
Migration of dissolved gases in water might be attributed to the critical transient behaviour of 
the water films at the short contact time. The film drainage rate and instability at the long 
contact time were analysed using the long-range hydrophobic attraction suggested by 
Eriksson et al., (1989) and the extended Stefan-Reynolds drainage theory which considers the 
mobility of the film interfaces. The results were reported in Chapter 4. 
iii. Effects of different salts (inhibiting and non-inhibiting, structure maker and breaker, 
monovalent and bivalent) from 0.001M to 3M on the film drainage and stability were 
investigated. The results showed that films of all salts drain slower and last longer with 
increasing salt concentration. By correlating the film results with data of oxygen solubility, it 
was  suggested that the reduction of dissolved gas in salt solutions caused weaker hydrophobic 
attraction between two film surfaces, which consequently resulted in slower drainage and 
more stable films. The effect of solution viscosity was also analysed and apparently cannot be 
ruled out. It was argued that there was no single mechanism for the coalescence inhibition in 
salts, but it must be analysed in the light of different contributing factors. 
iv. Experimental results were analysed and fitted with the Stefan-Reynolds and extended Stefan-
Reynolds models, and with the DLVO and extended-DLVO theories.  The results showed that 
the surface viscosity (surface mobility) decreased with increasing concentration. In addition, 
the hydrophobic factor needed to be added to explain the film behaviour. 
v. It was proven that films of all investigated salts were transient stable if the concentration was 
sufficient.

Chapter 2. Literature Review 
2.1. Bubble coalescence inhibition in salt solutions 
Water is not only the matrix of life but also protects our planet from climate warming by 
absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere into the oceans. The absorption of CO2 and 
other gases from the air into the oceans increases with the formation of bubbles caused by breaking 
waves, which is known as whitecapping. For a given wind condition, the whitecap coverage on the 
oceans is substantially larger than that on the surface of fresh-water lakes (Andreas et al., 2000; 
Blanchard, 1971; Monahan, 1969, 1971; Monahan et al., 1986; Scott, 1975; Slauenwhite et al., 1999; 
Thorpe, 1982; Thorpe et al., 1979; Wu, 1979). The difference in the whitecap coverage has been 
attributed to the foaminess of seawater due to its saline property. The major content of seawater is 
NaCl, which is known to significantly inhibit bubble coalescence (Chesters et al., 1982; Craig et al., 
1993a; Craig et al., 1993b; Lessard et al., 1971; Scott, 1975). Another good example of the influence 
of salts is the improved flotation recovery in mineral processing industry by using saline water 
(Klassen et al., 1963; Paulson et al., 1996; Quinn et al., 2007). It has been explained that salts in saline 
process water prevent bubble coalescence and consequently enhance contact area and attachment 
efficiency between bubbles and particles.  
The earliest studies that explored the foaming impact of salts were done by Foulk in the 1920s 
(Foulk, 1924). However, more comprehensive studies on the effects of salts on inhibiting bubble 
coalescence started in the 1960s and 1970s. Marrucci et al., (1967) used an air sparger as a gas 
distributor to generate bubbles at different superficial gas velocities in various salts. They observed 
the decreasing bubble size with increasing salt concentration and specific effects of ions on bubble 
size. They were the first to correlate the coalescence inhibition with surface tension gradient based 
on the Gibbs adsorptions concept. However, it was not explained why salts with negative adsorption 
at the interface prevented bubbles from coalescing. This correlation was recalled later in other studies 
(Pashley et al., 1997; Weissenborn et al., 1995, 1996) and is still yet to be fully understood. Later, 
Lessard et al., (1971) published a comprehensive study in which they simplified the coalescence 
process by investigating contact between bubble pairs. They carried out the tests in various salt 
solutions and concentrations. The concept of transition concentration at which 50% coalescence 
occurs was firstly introduced, and it has been used to characterise coalescence in salts since then. 
They reported that the multivalent salts prevent bubble coalescence at a lower concentration than the 
monovalent ions. The ion size also affected coalescence. They explained the inhibiting effect of salts 

7 
 
 
by ion-water interactions. It was argued that ions slow liquid film drainage and consequently retard 
the coalescence of bubbles by affecting the hydrogen bonding. They also correlated the transition 
concentration of different salts with solution viscosity and hydration energy of ions, from which initial 
concepts about the correlation between "structure maker" and "structure breaker" salts and bubble 
coalescence were introduced. In addition, the effect of salts on gas transfer from the environment to 
solutions was mentioned. Those preliminary concepts are of importance to many studies in the next 
four decades (Craig et al., 1993b; Hofmeier et al., 1995; Kim et al., 1990; Prince, 1990a, 1990b; 
Oolman et al., 1986; Pashley et al., 1997) and are still not fully understood. We will discuss more 
details in the following sections. However, Lessard and Zieminski did not mention the effects of 
interfacial forces, which are critical to the drainage and rupture of liquid films between bubbles.  
In the early 1990s, the coalescence inhibition of salts attracted renewed interest with several 
new investigations. Among those, the study by (Craig et al., 1993a; Craig et al., 1993b) obtained the 
most attention thanks to their empirical model for the combination of cations and anions to determine 
if the salts inhibit coalescence or not. They measured bubble coalescence by using the bubble column 
system for a range of concentration and salts. Salts are defined as "non-inhibiting" if they show no 
effect on coalescence relative to pure water with the concentration up to 0.5M. They assign α or β to 
each cation and anion based on the experimental observations. The combination of either αα or ββ 
salts inhibits coalescence whereas αβ or βα salts does not inhibit coalescence. The results of this 
combining rule are summarised in Table 2.1.       
However, this definition was later proven not fully appropriate in a study by Christenson et al., 
(2008). They showed that some salts that are considered as ‘'non-inhibiting'' indeed do at a higher 
concentration. For example, transition concentration for NaClO4 is 1.7M. They suggested that 
investigations on bubble coalescence should be carried out over a wider range of concentration. This 
observation was challenged with the concern that surfactants as contaminants might accumulate in 
salt solutions at high concentrations and stabilise liquid films and bubbles. However, this observation 
is proven valid and is not due to contamination in Chapter 5.

Bubble coalescence system is complex and involves many chemical and mechanical processes. 
Different methods have been used to understand this phenomenon including the bubble column 
(Christenson et al., 1995; Craig et al., 1993b; Henry et al., 2007; Hofmeier et al., 1995; Marrucci et 
al., 1967), pairing bubbles (Christenson et al., 2008; Lessard et al., 1971; Tse et al., 1998), and thin 
liquid film (Henry et al., 2009; Karakashev, Manev, & Nguyen, 2008; Kazakis et al., 2008; Yaminsky 
et al., 2010a; Yaminsky et al., 2010b).  The bubble column method is simple to setup and provides 
information about macroscopic properties of bubbles including bubble size and gas holdup. However, 
it provides no insight into the interaction mechanism between bubbles. On another hand, the micro-
interferometry thin liquid film method provides microscopic insights about the drainage and rupture 
of liquid films between two air/water interfaces with well-controlled experimental conditions. 
However, it is a sophisticated and time-consuming technique to gain sufficient statistical data.  
Despite its minor disadvantages, the thin liquid film is a well-accepted method to study the 
mechanism of bubble coalescence.

2.2. Drainage and Rupture of Liquid Film 
As noted above, the stability of thin liquid films between bubbles is the core process to control 
the coalescence of bubbles. The surface forces and boundary conditions of the air/water interfaces 
can significantly affect the drainage and rupture of the liquid films.  
2.2.1. Surface forces 
Stability of liquid films or any colloidal system is under the effect of two types surface forces:  
attractive and repulsive. The conventional and prominent theory of surface forces for more than half 
a century is the DLVO theory of colloidal stability (Derjaguin et al., 1941; Verwey et al., 1948). In 
this theory, the stability of colloidal systems is explained by the balance of two independent forces: 
the electrostatic double-layer forces (EDL) and the van del Waals forces (vdW) (Israelachvili, 1991; 
Nguyen et al., 2004).  For liquid films between bubbles, the EDL is always repulsive, and the vdW is 
always attractive. The liquid film is stable if the magnitude of repulsive forces in the system is 
stronger than that of attractive counterparts. Apart from the EDL, the steric force is also another 
repulsive component. However, multiple studies have shown that it is short-ranged (up to 5 nm) 
(Exerowa et al., 2003) and cannot play a role in the stability of surfactant-free liquid films which 
rupture at several tens of nanometres. In addition, the existence of the long-ranged hydrophobic forces 
has been verified and plays an important role in explaining the stability of many colloidal systems. 
The various forces can be captured in a single equation for the disjoining pressure, ∏:

2.2.1.1. van der Walls (vdW) 
The vdW force is due to induced dipoles. It is a close function of separation distance between 
two acting particles or surfaces (A. V. Nguyen et al., 2004). The vdW interaction can be calculated 
by either the Hamaker method or the Lifshitz method (Israelachvili, 1991; A. V. Nguyen et al., 2004).

. For the symmetric liquid film, vdW is negative, 
which means attraction. The vdW is strong but very short-ranged, i.e., shorter than 10 nm 
(Israelachvili, 1991) due to electromagnetic retardation, and is partially screened at high ionic strength 
solutions. Films of surfactant-free salt liquid film usually rupture at the thickness greater than 20nm. 
Therefore, the vdW attraction is not an important factor in the stability of salt films. The magnitude 
of the vdW between two bubble surfaces is not comparable with the EDL at the film thickness greater 
than 10 nm. Also, Craig et al., (1993b) showed that the vdW forces could not counterbalance the 
hydrodynamic repulsion between air bubbles. Therefore, it is necessary to employ the presence of 
other attractive forces, so-called hydrophobic forces, which are discussed below. 
2.2.1.2. Electrostatic double layer (EDL)  
The charge of bubble surfaces is negative in aqueous solutions (Li et al., 1993). In deionised 
water, the surface potential of an air bubble is 20-65mV at different pH (Li et al., 1991). According 
to the Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory, the surface charge is balanced by the oppositely charged ions 
called counterions, some of which are bound to the surface by the Coulombic forces in the Stern 
layer; while others are thermally diffused in the solution to form a diffused layer. The overlapping of 
two double layers of ions of two surfaces as they are brought into together causes the EDL. The 
magnitude of the EDL strongly depends on the concentration of ions between the two surfaces. A 
representation of the structure of an EDL is shown in Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1. The structure of the EDL around a single bubble surface. 
As the two charged surfaces of the film approach from an infinite separation, the overlap of the 
two double layers will lead to repulsive forces, namely the EDL forces. The EDL can be determined 
by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Under the condition of constant surface potential, the EDL can 
generally be described as (Nguyen et al., 2004)

A limitation of the EDL theory is that it does not characterise the specific ion effect (Craig, 2004). 
As shown in the Eq. 2.4 and 2.5, the EDL is a function of the concentration and valency of ions, 
which means that at the same concentration, ions with the same valency result in the same reduction 
of the EDL. Type, size, and polarization of ions are not taken into account. This fact is a striking 
deficiency of the electrostatic theory, as there is much experimental evidence for ion specificity. 
These include the ion specificity in bubble coalescence (Craig et al., 1993b), surface tension (Bostrom 

13 
 
 
et al., 2005; Weissenborn et al., 1995), enzyme activity (Cacace et al., 1997; Collins et al., 1985), and 
protein stability (Bauduin et al., 2004). In addition, the DLVO theory does not describe well the forces 
in a high ionic strength environment (>0.1 M), which is illustrated in Figure 2.2. Despite the 
magnitude of the EDL increases with the increasing of salt concentrations below 0.01 M, the EDL is 
completely screened at concentration greater than 0.01 M (Israelachvili, 1991; Nguyen et al., 2004). 
Consequently, the liquid films between bubbles in high concentration salts should be unstable, which 
consequently enhances coalescence.  
2.2.1.3. Non-DLVO (Hydrophobic forces) 
With the failure of the DLVO theory in explaining the stability of surfactant-free salt films as 
discussed above, the long-range hydrophobic force is another possible explanation. (Craig et al., 
1993b; Lessard et al., 1971) showed that bubble coalescence decreases with increasing salt 
concentration, which suggests a decrease of hydrophobic forces. Although researchers have widely 
agreed on the existence of  long-ranged and strong attractive forces between two hydrophobic 
surfaces (Angarska et al., 2004; Phil Attard, 2003; Christenson et al., 2001; J. C. Eriksson et al., 1989; 
Israelachvili et al., 1982; Parker et al., 1994), the origin of those forces is still in debate. Various types 
of hydrophobic forces have been discussed.                     
The first, and most common, theory is that hydrophobic forces are due to the capillary bridgings 
of pre-existing nanobubbles on the hydrophobic surfaces (Phil Attard, 2003; Christenson et al., 2001; 
Parker et al., 1994). Those nanobubbles form at the defects of the solid surfaces, at which the bubbles 
can nucleate. This hypothesis is supported by the measurement of surface forces on two hydrophobic 
and smooth surfaces conducted by Meyer et al., (2006). In this experiment, the interaction order of 
the attraction was around 10nm. However, this mechanism cannot explain long-ranged attractive 
forces between gas bubbles in foam films (Angarska et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004). Craig et al., 
(1993b) and then Weissenborn et al., (1996) suggested that the hydrophobic forces may relate to the 
concentration of soluble gases which is a strong function of the salt concentration due to the salting-
out effect (Lang et al., 1986). The concentration of soluble gases decreases with increasing salt 
concentration, which leads to weaker hydrophobic interactions and more stable bubbles. However, 
designing a setup to examine directly that hypothesis is challenging, and so far, there has not been 
any direct evidence for it.           

14 
 
 
Another theory of long-ranged hydrophobic forces is the propagation of the hydrogen bonding 
from the interface into the bulk due to the restructuring of water molecules at the interfaces (Eriksson 
et al., 1989). The authors attributed the propagation of hydrogen bonding to the increase of hydrogen 
bonding density per water molecule, which is energetically favourable. This theory showed good 
agreement with experimental data in hydrophobic forces carried out by Claesson et al., (1988). 
However, how the propagation of hydrogen bonding could extend to the order of 70-90nm in 
thickness is not clear.  
2.2.2. Surface Boundary Conditions 
After consideration of the effects of surface forces on the coalescence inhibition, the mechanism 
for the inhibition is still not clear (Craig, 2004). Another aspect to consider is the boundary conditions 
of air/water interfaces which can control the drainage and the rupture of the intervening liquid film 
between two bubbles (Chesters et al., 1982). Numerous studies have investigated the impact of these 
mechanisms on the film rupture to explain the specificity of salts in inhibiting coalescence. Several 
theories have been introduced that take into account effects of the surface tension and the structure 
of the air/water interfaces.               
2.2.2.1. Surface tension gradient – Gibb-Marangoni effect 
The most popular explanation of ion specific effects in bubble coalescence is the surface tension 
gradient at the air/solution interfaces (Craig et al., 1993b; Weissenborn et al., 1995, 1996). The 
surface tension gradient relates to the interfacial structure and ion adsorption at the air/water interface. 
According to the Gibbs adsorption isotherm, ions have the propensity to stay away from the air/water 
interface. The depletion of ions at the interface is due to the lower potential energy of ions in bulk, 
where they are fully hydrated, compared with being partially hydrated at the interface (Manciu et al., 
2003).                  
According to the theory of coalescence (Marrucci, 1969), the effect of the surface tension 
gradient in coalescence correlates with the elasticity of the surface. The term surface elasticity is 
conceptually described as the resistance of the film against the expansion of the surface by increasing 
its surface tension. The surface elasticity prevents the coalescence by slowing the drainage of the 
liquid film between bubbles (Mahassine et al., 2009). This argument is interpreted by using the Gibbs 
definition of the elasticity E (Christenson et al., 1995)

Experimentally, Christenson et al., (1995) reported the correlation between the effects of salts

is greater than 1 (mN2m-2M-2) for salts that inhibit coalescence, and is smaller than 1 for 
ones that have no apparent inhibiting effect on coalescence.  This observation has been confirmed by 
the systematic experiments for surface tension gradient and coalescence carried out by (Weissenborn 
et al., 1995). Figure 2.3 shows the gradient of surface tension with salt concentrations. 
However, in a review paper of specific ion effects in bubble coalescence, Craig (2004) pointed out 
that the surface tension gradient is not a satisfactory reason for coalescence inhibition by suggesting 
some exceptions of correlations between the coalescence and the surface tension gradient. For 
example, tetramethylammonium acetate can inhibit the coalescence with a (

addition, the effect of surface tension on the case of the mixed salt system is also exclusive (Henry et 
al., 2007). Therefore, it is not fully justifiable to elucidate the specificity of ions in coalescence 
inhibition by using the surface tension.

2.2.3. Bulk solution structure and Dispersion Forces 
The surface tension cannot satisfactorily explain the specific nature of salts in bubble 
coalescence. By itself, it is also an example of the ion specificity (Bostrom et al., 2001; Bostrom et 
al., 2005) as salts have their specific values of surface tension. The hypothesis that ions have different 
capabilities to modify the water structure (Leontidis, 2002) has been the dominant point of view of 
the specific ion effects for some time.  The hydration energy of ions varies with the size and the 
charged density of the ions, from which the following terms: water-structure-makers or kosmotropic 
ions; and water-structure-breakers or chaotropic ions (Kunz, 2006; Leontidis, 2002) arise. The 
kosmotropic ions, which are small, and have a high density of charge, are strongly hydrated and more 
likely to be repelled from an air-water interface.  In contrast, the chaotropic ions are distributed nearer 
the interfaces since they are large, have a lower charge density and are more weakly hydrated 
(Weissenborn et al., 1996). Shown in Figure 2.4 is the correlation between the standard entropy of 
hydration of some cations of chloride solutions and the surface tension gradient.

some cations of chloride solutions and surface tension gradient (Weissenborn et al., 
1996). 
However, if the hydration is the answer, it is unclear why does the surface tension of acids, such 
as of HCl and HNO3, decreases (Kunz, 2006). It is evident that the hydration of ions cannot provide 
a complete explanation for the ion specificity in the surface tension of salt solutions.       
Ninham et al., (1997) proposed the dispersion forces to solve this problem. By employing the 
dispersion forces between ions at the air/water interface and taking into account in-depth properties 
of ions, such as polarizabilities and electron affinities, the surface tension can be fully explained 
(Bostrom et al., 2001). This theory is supported by recent developments in computation (Dang et al., 
2002; Jungwirth et al., 2001). By employing the polarizable models, the authors successfully 
demonstrated the surface propensity of halide ions. Specifically, the kosmotropic ions (small and 
nonpolarizable anions) such as fluoride are repelled from the surface, whereas chaotropic anions 
(large and polarizable) such as bromide and iodide are enriched at the surface rather than in the bulk. 
Figure 2.5 shows the typical snapshots from the molecular dynamic simulations of some halide 
anions.

simulations (Jungwirth et al., 2001). 
The effect of dispersion forces, however, is quite small and can be negligible in strong 
electrostatic environments, as has been pointed out by (Bostrom et al., 2001; Ninham et al., 1997). 
Also, it has been shown that the macroscopic parameters of a bulk solution such as the osmotic 
coefficient cannot be justified by the micro magnitude of dispersion forces (Kunz et al., 2004).

The Influence of Gas Velocity, Salt Type and Concentration on 
Transition Concentration for Bubble Coalescence Inhibition 
and Gas Holdup

Published in “Chemical Engineering Research and Design”, 2012, 90, 33-39 
 
3.1. Abstract 
The influence of gas velocity (3.5, 10, and 18 mm/s), salt type (NaCl, NaI and CsCl) and salt 
concentration (0.001M to 3M) on bubble coalescence in a small bubble column were studied. The 
bubble coalescence was determined by the relative change in the measured light intensities passing 
through the salt solutions and clean deionised water. It was shown that the transition salt concentration 
for bubble coalescence inhibition (determined at 50% of bubble coalescence) of all investigated salts 
decreases with increasing superficial gas velocity. The difference in the transition concentration 
between NaCl and CsCl does not significantly change with the gas velocity. However, that difference 
between NaI and NaCl (or CsCl) significantly decreases with increasing the gas velocity. The gas 
holdup significantly increases with NaCl and CsCl concentrations but does not significantly change 
with NaI concentration. These new results imply that the transition salt concentration for bubble 
coalescence and gas holdup depend not only on the salt properties (i.e. the ion type and their 
combination) as previously reported, but also on the hydrodynamic conditions.

3.2. Introduction 
Air bubbles are used in industrial applications to provide high specific surface areas for mass 
and/or heat transfer in bubble columns and chemical reactors or for flotation separation in mineral 
processing, wastewater treatment and water desalination. Salts have been found to significantly affect 
the size and the coalescence of bubbles, and hence the performance of these applications (Harvey et 
al., 2002; Klassen et al., 1963; Paulson et al., 1996). 
Numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the effects of salts on bubble coalescence 
and the underlying mechanisms (Chesters et al., 1982; Craig et al., 1993b; Hofmeier et al., 1995; 
Marrucci, 1967; Marrucci et al., 1969; Prince, 1990b). Many studies have focused on explaining the 
ion effects specific to the ion types and combinations. Some salts have been found to inhibit 
coalescence, whereas many other salts do not. Ctrans is defined as the concentration at which bubble 
coalescence is 50%, where 100% is for pure water. Bubble coalescence has been found to be ion-
specific, that is, Ctrans strongly depends on ion types and their combination (Christenson et al., 2008; 
Craig et al., 1993b). In some of the studies, Ctrans was identified as a unique parameter for each of the 
salts examined. Some researchers (Chan et al., 2005; Marrucci et al., 1967; Prince, 1990b) developed 
models to predict Ctrans as a function of surface tension, bubble size, and van der Waals forces. It is 
noted that these theories were developed for the immobile air-water interface, which are expected to 
be different to the mobile air-salt solution interfaces. The mobility of air-salt solution interface is 
hypothesised to be a function of ion partition at the interface. Zahradnik et al., (1995) have used the 
proposed model equations and compared the theories with various experimental data (Lessard et al., 
1971) but have not realised that the models developed for bubbles with the immobile surface might 
not be physically consistent with the data obtained with bubbles having a mobile surface (Zahradnik 
et al., 1995). Tsang et al., (2004) reported the first evidence of Ctrans dependence on bubble size. They 
investigated bubble coalescence in aqueous MgSO4 solutions using the pair-bubble interaction 
method. The Ctrans was found to increase with decreasing of bubble size. 
The effect of salt ion chemistry on bubble coalescence has also been investigated and provided 
interesting insight (Craig et al., 1993b; C. L. Henry et al., 2010; Werner Kunz, 2010). Craig (2004) 
showed the combining rule of the salt ions in bubble coalescence: the hαβ or βα salts such as sodium 
chlorate do not inhibit bubble coalescence, but αα or ββ salts such as sodium chloride or lithium 
chloride inhibit bubble coalescence. Similarly, molecular dynamics simulations (Jungwirth et al., 
2006; Marčelja, 2006) show that the αβ or βα salt ions equally partition at the interface, but the αα or 

22 
 
 
ββ salt ions unequally distribute at the interface. These results show the importance of the ion 
specificity (size and polariability) effect at high salt concentrations on bubbles coalescence inhibition. 
Recently, the salt ions can be matched by the ion affinity to water according to the empirical Collins’ 
concept “like seeks like” to explain many experimental observations in biology (Kunz, 2010) and 
flotation separation of hydrophobic particles in brine solutions (Ozdemir et al., 2011). 
The available experimental data and models show that salts significantly influence bubble 
coalescence. However, the available data are scattered, and the models are not able to describe the 
available experimental results. This paper aims to re-examine the influence of salts on bubble 
coalescence. Specifically, the paper focuses on the effect of gas superficial velocity, salt type and 
concentration on bubble coalescence inhibition. It is expected that both hydrodynamics and salt 
chemistry influence bubble coalescence, and hence Ctrans. 
3.3. Materials and Methods 
The bubble column setup (Figure 3.1) used for the bubble coalescence experiments consisted 
of a cylindrical glass column (4.5 cm inner diameter and 20 cm high) and an optical system for 
measuring the light intensity passing through the column. The change in bubble coalescence in salt 
solutions was determined by the change in solution turbidity measured by the light intensity. High 
purity nitrogen bubbles (BOC, Australia) were created using a glass frit (porosity 11-16 µm) at the 
bottom of the column. Experiments were conducted at superficial velocities of 3.5, 10, and 18 mm/s. 
The optical system composed of a cold light source 24V 150W (XGY-II(A) Halogen Lamp Unit, 
ProSciTech, Kirwan, QLD, Australia) on one side of the column, and a condensing lens followed by 
a photo sensor (S121C, Thorlabs Inc., Newton, NJ, USA) on the other side, which was connected to 
a laptop computer via a USB power and energy meter interface (PM100USB, Thorlabs Inc., Newton, 
NJ, USA). Only the 635 nm wavelength light of the white light source emitted from the XGY-II(A) 
Halogen Lamp unit was selected by the built-in software of the PM100USB USB interface for 
calibrating and measuring. This experimental method is based on measuring the solution turbidity 
inside the bubble column. The measured light intensity was calibrated against the light intensity 
measured for clean deionised water (100% coalescence) at which the solution turbidity and light 
absorbance are minimum. For each measurement, the sensor measured the energy of the transmitted 
light every 0.5 seconds for 100 seconds, i.e., 200 data points were taken to reliably obtain a histogram 
of energy (Figure 3.2). The histogram did not change with time. The histogram of the light energy 

23 
 
 
measured by the photodetector was then used to calculate the mean value at a probability of 95%, 
which was used to provide stable and reproducible results. 
All glassware was thoroughly cleaned by soaking in alkaline cleaning solution prepared from 
potassium hydroxide, water and ethanol (12.5:16:84 mass ratio), and vigorously rinsed many times 
with pure deionised (DI) water, produced by a Milli-Q system (Millipore, USA). The glassware was 
then soaked in a diluted hydrochloric acid solution and flushed thoroughly with the DI water. The 
column was cleaned using the above cleaning procedure, followed by bubbling with nitrogen for 10 
minutes. This cleaning method ensured the column and the glass frit were free from contamination. 
All salts (NaCl, CsCl and NaI) used were of the highest purity (99.5% A.C.S grade, Sigma-Aldrich, 
Australia). Further recrystallization and calcination did not improve the salt purity but foam 
fractionation by bubbling the salt solutions for two minute before starting the experiments removed 
the trace organic contaminants as evidenced by surface tension and chromatography analysis. The 
three salts were chosen to provide a suitable combination of halide anions and cations for comparison. 
The effect of the salt ion chemistry on bubble coalescence is also known (Craig et al., 1993b). 
The gas hold-up, ε, was determined by the bed expansion method which gives, where H is the 
total height of the aerated solution and H0 is the initial height of the solutions, which was 8.2 cm (100 
mL solution). For the salt solutions studied, the foam volume formed on the surface was significantly 
small, and the bed expansion method gives a good estimation for the gas holdup in the bubble 
columns. All experiments were carried out at controlled room temperature (21.5 – 23oC).

3.4. Results 
Shown in Figure 3.3 are the results for the bubble coalescence versus salt concentration and gas 
superficial velocity. The bubble coalescence decreases with increasing salt concentration for each 
salt. A similar trend was previously reported for a low gas velocity (Craig et al., 1993b). However, 
the results in Figure 3.3 show a strong influence of superficial gas velocity on bubble coalescence. 
Figure 3.4 summarises the experimental results for the transition salt concentration, Ctrans, for bubble 
coalescence inhibition as a function of superficial gas velocity. The results on Figure 3.4 show that 
Ctrans of all investigated salts decreases with increasing superficial gas velocity. The decrease in Ctrans 
of NaCl and CsCl with increasing the gas velocity is similar. Therefore, the difference between Ctrans 
of these two salts does not significantly change with the gas velocity. However, with increasing the 
gas velocity Ctrans of NaI decreases much faster than Ctrans of NaCl and CsCl. The influence of gas 
superficial velocity on Ctrans of all investigated salts follows the order: NaI>NaBr>CsCl>NaCl>NaF. 
This result agrees with the combining rule (Craig et al., 1993b) in that the combination of the cations 
(Na and Cs) and anions (I and Cl) in the salts inhibits bubble coalescence, but the order of the 
inhibition strength as revealed by our experiments is also important. The strongest influence of gas 
superficial velocity on transition salt concentration by NaI indicates that of the cations and anions 
examined, iodide appears to influence bubble coalescence most significantly.

Figure 3.4. Transition salt concentration, Ctrans, for bubble coalescence 
inhibition for NaCl, CsCl and NaI versus superficial gas velocity. 
Figure 3.5. shows the experimental results for the gas holdup, ε, as a function of salt 
concentration and superficial gas velocity. In agreement with the literature data (Moshtari et al., 2009; 
Orvalho et al., 2009; Zahradnik et al., 1995), gas holdup increases with increasing superficial gas 
velocity. This dependence of ε on increasing salt concentration is opposite to the dependence of Ctrans 
(Figure 3.4). The results also show that the gas holdup increase in NaI solutions is not as rapid as in 
the other salt solutions. At the highest salt concentration of 3M and the highest gas flow rate of 18 
mm/s, the highest gas holdup obtained for NaCl and CsCl is 1.9 and 2.4 times higher than the highest 
gas holdup obtained for NaI, respectively. The influence of high gas superficial velocity on ε of all 
investigated salts follows the increasing order: NaI<NaBr<NaCl<CsCl, which oppositely mismatches 
the decreasing order of Ctrans: NaI>NaBr>CsCl>NaCl. Furthermore, the increase in gas holdup with 
increasing salt concentration can be divided into two regimes: the low and high salt concentration 
regimes. In the low salt concentration regime, the increase in gas holdup with superficial gas velocity 
is not very sensitive to the salt type. In this regime, the extensive data on gas holdup for a wide range 
of salts (and at least two gas rates) were presented by Quinn et al., (2007) who showed a weak 
correlation of gas holdup with ionic strength. In the high salt concentration regime, the gas holdup 
increase is rapid for CsCl, NaF, NaBr, and NaCl, but not for NaI. In the high salt concentration regime, 
the gas holdup appears to be sensitive to the salt type.

3.5. Discussion 
The mechanism of inhibition of bubble coalescence in salt solutions is yet unknown. However, 
it is known that salts influence the drainage and stability of liquid films between bubbles, which are 
the driving force for bubble coalescence. The coalescence of bubbles is governed by three consecutive 
steps: 1) the relative approach of bubbles, which leads to the formation of a thin liquid film between 
gas-liquid interfaces, 2) the drainage of the liquid film under external forces (due to gravity, inertia 
and flow) proportional to the bubble volume, and surface forces of molecular origin, which are 
proportional to thin liquid film area, and 3) the film rupture at a critical thickness under the influence 
of attractive surface forces and mechanical disturbances, leading to bubble coalescence.

The first step of the relative approach of bubbles is governed by the bubble rise velocity. 
Recently, the effect of salts on the bubble rise velocity was re-examined to determine whether or not 
the mobility of the gas-aqueous salt solution interfaces would influence bubble rise velocity and 
coalescence inhibition (Parkinson et al., 2008; Henry et al., 2008). The measured data for terminal 
rise velocity of small bubbles (with diameter smaller than 110 μm) in both the bubble coalescence 
inhibiting and non-inhibiting salt solutions show that the bubble rise velocity obeys the Hadamard-
Rybczynski model (Figure 3.6), which corresponds to a mobile interface (slip boundary condition) 
and agrees with observations in ultra-clean water. The Hadamard-Rybczynski theory predicts the 
bubble rise velocity higher than the Stokes theory (based on immobile air-liquid interface) by a factor 
of 1.5. Only the properties of water (the density δ = 1000 kg/m3 and the bulk viscosity µ = 0.001 
Pa⋅s) are used in calculating the Hadamard-Rybczynski bubble rise velocity, which excellently 
compares with the experimental results for inhibiting and non-inhibiting salt solutions and ultra-clean 
water. This agreement provides strong evidence that the inhibiting and non-inhibiting salt solutions 
for bubble coalescence salts do not influence the rise velocity of small bubbles, and the salts do not 
influence bubble coalescence through bubble rise velocity. In fact, the gas holdup remains unchanged 
along the bubble column height above the frit surface. The bubble coalescence should significantly 
occur during the bubble formation on the frit surface, where the film drainage and rupture play an 
important role. The role of liquid film drainage and rupture and attractive surface forces is discussed 
below.

Repulsive hydration (decays by a 
single exponential function of 
separation distance) 
When bubbles are in close contact, a small amount of liquid is entrapped between them, forming 
a small circular lens or liquid film with an initial thickness of a few 100nm. Capillary and molecular 
forces on the opposite sides of the liquid films cause the film to grow thinner and rupture at a critical 
film thickness. The film drainage equation established by the lubrication approximation has been 
solved employing both short- and long-range van der Waals attraction, and repulsive hydration (Chan 
et al., 2005; Marrucci, 1969; Prince, 1990b). The change in surface tension due to increasing salt 
concentration (the Gibbs-Marangoni effect) was assumed to play a significant role in immobilising 
the liquid flow inside the film and preventing the film from coalescence. The available predictions 
for Ctrans are summarised in Table 3.1. All the three available theoretical models based on the Gibbs-
Marangoni effect predict that Ctrans is proportional to the square of surface tension gradient with 
respect to salt concentration. Although the surface tension gradient has been found to correlate with 
the entropies of ion hydration, the Gibbs-Marangoni effect does not provide a satisfactory explanation 
for the bubble coalescence inhibition of salts (Weissenborn et al., 1996). Furthermore, the Hamaker 
constants and coefficient (A and B) and many other parameters contained in the three model equations 
do not specifically depend on specific properties of salt ions such as ion size or charge/polarisability. 

33 
 
 
The electrical double-layer forces are not dependent on the ion-specific properties and normally 
become vanishingly small at high salt concentration. Therefore, the classical DLVO (Derjaguin-
Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) theory of colloid stability does not explain the bubble coalescence and 
the transition concentration shown in Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4, respectively. Several additional 
hypotheses were suggested including an increase in repulsion due to hydration (Pashley, 1981) and a 
decrease in hydrophobic attractions (Craig et al., 1993b). The hydration force due to the change in 
solvent structure and hydration shell is short-ranged and cannot stabilise saline water films with 
thickness >50nm. The origin of the measured hydrophobic attraction is still in debate. Therefore, the 
suggested extensions of the DLVO theory remain unsatisfactory. 
Interestingly, the available theories as summarised in Table 3.1 do not show the influence of 
the gas superficial velocity on the salt transient concentration. This contradicts the experimental 
results shown in Figure 3.4. The theoretical deficiency requires further theoretical investigation. 
It is further noted that increasing gas rate increases the bubble size and decreases the salt 
transition concentration (Figure 3.4). There could be a correlation between the bubble size and the 
salt concentration, but this correlation while useful in many cases is secondary here. The bubble size 
cannot be the primary factor causing the change in the bubble coalescence in the experiments. Indeed, 
the high-speed movies show that the bubble coalescence mainly occurs at the frit surface, where the 
momentum of the gas stream is high and can overcome the resistance of liquid film between the gas-
liquid interfaces, causing the film rupture and coalescence. Evidently, the gas velocity is the primary 
factor (i.e., more important than the bubble size) causing the bubble coalescence in different salt 
solutions. The experiments with frits of big and small pore sizes show the same decreasing trends of 
the salt transition with increasing the gas superficial velocity. Evidently, the transition concentration 
can change from one to another experimental system (with the different gas velocities, frit pore sizes, 
hydrostatic pressures, and salts) and its accurate prediction remains a challenge. 
The failure of the DLVO theory in explaining the inhibition of bubble coalescence in salt 
solutions implies that ion-specific non-DLVO factors may be responsible for bubble coalescence. 
Recently, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation (Jungwirth et al., 2006) and sum-frequency-
generation spectroscopy (Liu et al., 2004) have provided useful information about ion partition at the 
gas-liquid interfaces, which may influence the salt inhibition of bubble coalescence. The MD results 
show (Figure 3.7) that the ions of NaCl and NaI do not equally concentrate at the interfaces, but for 
NaF the salt ions equally distribute at the gas-salt solution interfaces. Specifically, the big anions like 

34 
 
 
iodide are significantly expelled to the gas phase by the interface while the smaller anions like fluoride 
stay within the interface layer, where they strongly associate with the sodium cations. Experiments 
in this study show that  NaI weakly inhibits the bubble coalescence and Craig et al., (1993b) found 
that other salts with large anion size, for example, NaClO3 do not. It is possible that the difference in 
salt ion partition at the interface can generate different interfacial properties capable of causing or 
inhibiting bubble coalescence (Henry et al., 2010). In particular, the affinity of salt ions to water 
molecules appears significant in determining the ion partition at the interface and the salt capability 
of inhibiting bubble coalescence. The Collins concept of matching water affinities of salt ions 
(Collins, 2004; Kunz, 2010; Ozdemir et al., 2011) can be applied here. The small (and hard) halide 
ions like Li+, Na+ and F- are strongly hydrated (kosmotropic), while the big (and soft) halide ions like 
K+, Rb+, Cs+, Cl-, Br- and I-  are weakly hydrated (chaotropic). If the constituent ions of salt are 
matched in water affinity (kosmotrope-kosmotrope and chaotrope-chaotrope), such as in the case of 
NaF and CsCl, the ion partitions within the water-gas interface layer should not be significantly 
different, and the salt capability of inhibiting bubble coalescence is strong. Conversely, if salt ions 
are not matched in water affinity (kosmotrope-chaotrope), such as in the case of NaI, the salt ion 
partitions within the water-gas interface layer are not significantly different, and the salt capability of 
inhibiting bubble coalescence in water becomes weak.

3.6. Conclusion 
The influence of gas superficial velocity, salt type and salt concentration on bubble coalescence 
and gas hold-up was investigated. The transition concentration for bubble coalescence inhibition was 
shown to be ion-specific and decrease with increasing gas velocity, which was hypothesised to be 
due to the difference in salt ion partitions at the interface. The gas velocity had the strongest influence 

36 
 
 
on Ctrans for NaI and weakest influence on the gas holdup for NaI. Our results show that both 
hydrodynamics and salt properties (the ion type and their combination) influence the transition salt 
concentration for inhibition of bubble coalescence and the gas holdup. 
Despite interesting results from the bubble column system, many hypotheses are still 
unexplainable by just using the bubble column. The bubble column system is too complex due to 
simultaneous interactions between multiple bubbles and hydrodynamic conditions such as rising 
velocity, viscosity, and bubble size. Therefore, in Chapter 4 we simplified further investigation by 
using a thin liquid film system in strictly-controlled conditions. Also by using just deionised water, 
we aimed to focus on just DLVO and hydrophobic forces without being interfered by salts. More 
details are presented in Chapter 4.

Drainage, rupture and lifetime of deionised water films: effect 
of dissolved gases?

4.1. Abstract 
Gas bubbles coalesce in deionised (DI) water because the water (foam) films between the 
bubbles are not stable. The so-called hydrophobic attraction has been suggested as the cause of the 
film instability and the bubble coalescence. In this work, micro-interferometry experiments show that 
foam films of ultrapure DI water can last up to ten seconds and the contact time between the two gas 
bubble surfaces at close proximity (~1 micron separation distance) significantly influences the film 
drainage, rupture and lifetime. Specifically, when the two bubbles were first brought into contact, the 
films instantly ruptured at a half-micron thickness. However, the film drainage rate and rupture 
thickness sharply decreased and the film lifetime steeply increased with increasing the contact time 
up to 10 min, but then they levelled off. The constant thickness of film rupture was around 35nm. 
Possible contamination was vigorously investigated and ruled out. It is argued that migration of gases 
inherently dissolved in water might cause the transient behaviour of the water films at the short 
contact time. The film drainage rate and instability at the long contact time were analysed employing 
JC Erikson et al.’s phenomenological theory of long-range hydrophobic attraction and the hypothesis 
of water molecular structure modified by dissolved gases, and the extended Stefan-Reynolds theory 
by incorporating the mobility of the air-DI water interfaces.

4.2. Introduction 
Strong attraction between hydrophobic interfaces has inspired scientists and engineers for many 
decades. Surface force apparatus (Christenson et al., 2001) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Butt 
et al., 2007) have significantly contributed to our current understanding of the attraction. In particular, 
spontaneous formation of gas bubbles (or vapour cavities) bridging hydrophobic (neutral 
hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon) surfaces was first observed by the surface force apparatus 
(Christenson et al., 1988). The attraction between these hydrophobic surfaces could be measured at 
separations of 70 to 90nm. The bridging bubbles were spontaneously formed when the fluorocarbon 
surfaces were brought into contact, but they occurred between the hydrocarbon surfaces only after 
separation from contact. The very long-range forces measured were interpreted because of the 
metastability of water films between macroscopic hydrophobic surfaces. It was also noted that the 
hydrophobic interaction between macroscopic surfaces may not be related to water structure in the 
same way that the hydrophobic effect between nonpolar molecules is related to water structure 
(Claesson et al., 1988). Indeed, structure and properties of water around small and large hydrophobic 
species can be significantly different (Setny, 2008). Around small hydrophobic species, water 
molecules form a solvation shell of higher density than that of the surrounding bulk, which are able 
to reorganise and maintain a maximum number of hydrogen bonds with their neighbours, leading to 
the overall positive free energy of solvation (of the so-called hydrophobic hydration). On the contrary, 
neighbouring water molecules in close proximity to large hydrophobic species are geometrically 
unable to maintain a maximum number of hydrogen bonds and are forced to point one of their 
hydrogens toward the hydrophobic (nonpolar) surface (Pratt et al., 2002), causing the hydrophobic 
dehydration. Scaled particle theory (Ashbaugh et al., 2006) predicts a depletion of the density of water 
molecules in contact with hydrophobic cavities of radii greater than 10A°. Furthermore, it is noted 
that as a rule gases inherently dissolved in water might be present in the clusters (Bunkin et al., 2006; 
Bunkin et al., 1997) that fill the large (hydrophobic) cavities in water which otherwise would be voids. 
The depletion of the density of water molecules in contact with the cluster of dissolved gases might 
result in the larger decay length of the phenomenological theory for the long-range hydrophobic force 
which was developed by Eriksson et al. using a square-gradient order parameter approach (Eriksson 
et al., 1989). 
On the experimental side, in 1994, the hypothesis of the bridging air bubbles causing the long-
range hydrophobic attraction between macroscopic surfaces was further confirmed with the MASIF 
apparatus which was used to measure the surface forces between two spherical surfaces (particles) 

39 
 
 
(Parker et al., 1994). The stepwise feature in the force curves between hydrophobic surfaces was 
observed and interpreted as the bridging of pre-existing nanobubbles on the surface. The attraction 
by bridging bubbles was also quantitatively analysed (Attard, 1996). The stepwise force curves were 
also obtained using atomic microscopy (AFM) (Attard, 2000; Carambassis et al., 1998; Ishida et al., 
1999; Ishida et al., 2000; Nguyen et al., 2003). Nanobubbles formed at solid-water interfaces were 
imaged by the AFM tapping mode (Attard et al., 2002; Tyrrell et al., 2001; J. Yang et al., 2003; Zhang 
et al., 2006) and correlated with the range and magnitude of the strong attraction between hydrophobic 
surfaces (Attard, 2003; Hampton et al., 2008). 
The nanobubble bridging theory which proposes the hydrophobic attractive force due to the 
coalescence of pre-existing nanobubbles at the hydrophobic surfaces that bridge the two approaching 
hydrophobic surfaces is gaining increasing acceptance and popularity (Attard, 2003; Christenson et 
al., 2001; Lin et al., 2005; Stevens et al., 2005). The pre-existing sub-microscopic bubbles adhering 
to the hydrophobic surfaces can be formed by repeatedly contacting and separating the solid surfaces 
which is a routine experimental procedure of measuring forces with AFM using the colloidal probe 
technique (Kappl et al., 2002). Indeed, no long-ranged attraction was measured if the hydrophobic 
surfaces were not previously contacted (Vinogradova et al., 2001). 
The steps in the AFM force curves can be explained by the rupture of liquid films between 
hydrophobic solid surfaces. Indeed, the bubble nucleation theory was proposed to explain the rupture 
of liquid films (Derjaguin et al., 1981). The rupture of the wetting film (i.e., the liquid film between 
a solid surface and an air bubble) normally leads to the dewetting of the solid surface. Nanobubbles 
were proposed to explain the rupture of wetting films through a number of stages (Stockelhuber et 
al., 2004). First, during the film drainage the apex of the largest nanobubbles on the hydrophobic 
solid surface comes closer to the surface of the macroscopic bubble, where surface forces interact. 
An aqueous foam film in nanometre size is effectively formed between the macroscopic bubble and 
the nanobubble, where the van der Waals interaction is attractive (Slavchov et al., 2005; Stockelhuber 
et al., 2004). The attractive van der Waals force can destabilise the film locally as traditionally 
proposed (Coons et al., 2003; Manev et al., 2005a; Sheludko, 1967; Valkovska et al., 2002). The local 
film destabilisation can be further increased by the increase in the local capillary pressure due to the 
concave surface of the nanobubble. If the local film destabilisation forms a hole with a diameter larger 
than the critical diameter (~10nm) (Nguyen et al., 2004), the entire wetting film is destabilised, and 
the hydrophobic surface becomes dewetted. Evidently, the nanobubble (hole) theory on the wetting 
film rupture is supported by the direct imaging of nanobubbles at hydrophobic surfaces in water by 

40 
 
 
AFM as discussed (Attard, 2003; Hampton et al., 2008; Simonsen et al., 2004; Steitz et al., 2003; 
Yang et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2007). Nevertheless, the nanobubbles imaged by the AFM tapping 
mode normally requires special surface treatment with liquids supersaturated by air or gases, usually 
by rapid temperature change or alcohol-water exchange. The treatment by alcohol-water exchange 
usually involves flushing liquids through the AFM fluid cell in the following consecutive steps: 
water–ethanol–water (Hampton et al., 2008). These required surface treatments have not been used 
to prepare the solid surfaces in the experiments of the wetting film rupture. Therefore, the interpreted 
role of (static) nanobubbles in the rupture of liquid films has been questioned recently (Karakashev 
et al., 2009). The direct experimental evidence showed the critical effect of the migration of dissolved 
gases on the drainage and rupture of water films between two hydrophobic oil-water interfaces. 
Specifically, the migration of dissolved gases from thin films of deionised water to the degassed oil 
and vice versa was found to significantly change transient profiles of film drainage and the rupture 
thickness of the emulsion films. It was also noticed that the degassing of water foam films (i.e., water 
films between two air bubbles) which are in direct contact with air is practically impossible. As a 
result, oil-in-water emulsion films were selected in the study in place of water foam films. Obviously, 
water foam films are interesting because the air-water interface free from surfactants and many other 
surface contaminants are the most hydrophobic (Yoon et al., 2006). For a long time, it has been widely 
accepted that foam films in pure water should be unstable (Craig, 2004; Karakashev, Nguyen, et al., 
2007; Mahnke et al., 1999; Marrucci, 1969; Ruckenstein et al., 1973).  More importantly, unstable 
foam films of water have been even used as an indicator of contamination-free systems (Craig, 2004; 
Karakashev, Nguyen, et al., 2007; Karakashev, Nguyen, et al., 2008). 
The aim of this study is to present further experimental evidence to show the significant role of 
dissolved air migration in the transient behaviour of DI water foam films. Specifically, we developed 
and applied a special experimental procedure to examine the critical effect of the contact time between 
the air-water interfaces at a close proximity before the film formation on the film drainage rate, 
rupture and lifetime under the condition of global vapour saturation in the measuring cell. 
4.3. Experimental Section 
4.3.1. Apparatus and Materials 
The micro-interferometric technique developed by Scheludko et al. (Sheludko, 1967; Exerowa, 
1998;) was used to determine the drainage, rupture and lifetime of the DI water foam films. The 

41 
 
 
apparatus used was described previously (Karakashev, Nguyen, et al., 2008). The central part of the 
apparatus was a short cylindrical glass tube (with 2.0 mm inner radius), called the film holder, which 
was housed in an enclosed glass cylindrical vessel. The film holder was connected, through a glass 
capillary attached the glass vessel, to a gastight motorised syringe pump (WPI Inc., USA) capable of 
delivering small volumetric flow rates (10 – 1000 nL/s). The film holder and the housing glass vessel 
formed the major unit, called the Scheludko cell for producing the foam films using the motorised 
syringe pump. The additional major units of the micro interferometric apparatus included: 1) a 
metallurgical inverted microscope (Epihot 200, Nikon, Japan) for illuminating the film by the parallel 
rays of the white light produced by a mercury lamp and for observing the film and the interference 
fringes (Newton rings) in the reflected light, 2) a digital video camera (PS640, Canon, USA) for 
recording the transient interferometric images formed by the light reflected from the film, and 3) a 
computer for controlling the experimental setup (the syringe pump and the digital camera) and for 
off-line processing the interferometric images to determine the film thickness. The white light from 
the mercury lamp arrived at and reflected off the two film interfaces perpendicularly. The heat filter 
was used to isolate the heat produced by the mercury lamp. The light intensity was also kept at a level 
as low as possible. The temperature in the film holder was carefully checked and measured by an 
infrared sensor. The room temperature was kept at 22±0.5°C. 
 Pure deionised (DI) water was produced from tap water first purified by a Reverse Osmosis 
Unit and then with a Milli-Q system (Millipore, USA). The resistivity of 18.2 MΩ•cm for the DI 
water was carefully checked. The DI water used in the experiments was equilibrated at the room 
temperature and pressure. All the glassware and the Scheludko cell were thoroughly cleaned by 
soaking in alkaline cleaning solution prepared from potassium hydroxide, water and ethanol (by 
12.5:16:84 mass ratio) and vigorously rinsed many times with a large quantity of the DI water. The 
film holder and the Scheludko glass vessel were dried with pure nitrogen and then equilibrated with 
the DI water. 
4.3.2. Experimental Methodology and Procedure 
Initially, a small amount of the DI water was placed at the bottom of the Scheludko cell to 
saturate the environment inside the cell. A small volume of the DI water was also transferred into and 
held as a biconcave drop in the film holder by the capillary effect due to the hydrophilic inner wall 
(Figure 4.1). The amount of the liquid in the biconcave drop was controlled by the gastight syringe. 
Microscopic films of radius from 0.05 to 0.1 mm were formed by slowly bringing the surfaces of the 

42 
 
 
biconcave drop closer and closer using the motorised syringe to pump out the DI water inside the 
concave drop. The pump speed used was 200 nL/s. The pumping was stopped as soon as the 
biconcave surfaces were close enough to form a film (to allow the capillary pressure to drive and 
control the film formation and the initial film drainage). The film formation was identified by the 
appearance of a small interferometric image. Immediately, the purity test for the Scheludko cell and 
the DI water was conducted by checking the film stability. If the first film ruptured instantly and 
could not be recorded, then the system (the Scheludko cell and the DI water) was considered to be 
clean. Otherwise, the system was contaminated, and the cleaning procedure and the purity test had to 
be repeated until no first water film was observed. 
The most straightforward approach to investigating the effect of dissolved gases in water on 
bubble and film stability would be developed by the degassing. However, this approach was not 
applicable for foam water films that were formed by slowly bringing two air-water (bubble) surfaces 
of the concave water drop in the film holder into contact because the water films were always in 
contact with air enclosed in the Scheludko cell. An alternative method to overcome this difficulty was 
developed to examine the drainage, rupture and lifetime of DI foam films as a function of contact 
time between the concave drop and the air enclosed in the Scheludko cell. It was expected that air 
inherently dissolved in the DI water of the thin concave drops would not be in equilibrium when the 
drops were formed. The dissolved gases could migrate to the DI water-air interface which in the 
absence of surfactants (adsorbed) and surface contamination could not stop the dissolved gases to 
migrate to the gas phase to establish equilibrium over time. The experimental steps are described in 
the following paragraph. 
The cell and the DI water were first checked for purity as described above. The DI water inside 
the film holder was then replaced by new DI water taken from the stock volume, and a new biconcave 
DI water drop was formed. The syringe pump was used to withdraw the water out of the film holder 
at the rate of 200 nL/s and was stopped as soon as the biconcave surfaces were close enough to form 
a film (by the capillary pressure).  The film ruptured instantly and this moment was offset as the zero 
contact time. Subsequently, the water was pumped back into the film holder to form another 
biconcave drop.  After waiting for a designated (contact) time, another film was formed using the 
syringe pump (Figure 4.1). The interferometric images were recorded during the film drainage (until 
rupture) using the CCD camera. The process was then repeated for different contact times, i.e., for 
different ages of the biconcave drops. The results were analysed and reported in this paper for ten 
contact times, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40 and 60 min.

foam films of deionised water. Shown in the inset is the procedure to make films with 
different drop ages (contact times between the film surfaces). 
 
4.3.3. Calculation of Film Thickness 
The film thickness, h, was calculated based on the intensity of the monochromatic light and the 
phase lag between the incident and reflected beams perpendicular to the two film interfaces. The 
colourful interferometric images were filtered by a digital monochromatic filter with the wavelength 
λ = 546 nm to obtain the monochromatic images using the image analysis software Optimas (Version 
6.5, Optimas Inc., USA). This new way of determination of film thickness was developed by us 
recently (Karakashev, Nguyen, et al., 2007). The thickness calculation with automatic data input and 

44 
 
 
output was performed using a Visual Basic for Application (VBA) code written in Microsoft Excel 
as a VBA macro which significantly enhanced the data processing. The equations used in developing 
the VBA macro can be described as (Nguyen et al., 2004)

4.4. Results and Discussion 
4.4.1. Experimental results 
Shown in Figure 4.2 are the experimental results for the transient thickness of DI water films 
versus contact time of the air-water interfaces before the film formation, i.e., the age of the biconcave 
drops. At the off-set zero contact time (i.e., at very short contact time < 1 min), the DI films ruptured 
instantly after formation as expected, and no interferometric image was observed and recorded by the 
camera system. Interferometric images of the light reflected from the film surfaces were only 
observed and recorded by the camera system for the DI water films formed from the biconcave drops 
with the age of at least 1 min. As it can be seen from Figure 4.2, the transient film thickness decreases 
with increasing the drop age up to about 8 min and then do not change with the drop age. The film 
drainage rate thus decreases with increasing the drop age initially and then reaches values independent 
of the drop age.   
The film lifetime versus the biconcave drop age is shown in Figure 4.3. A clear difference in 
the film lifetime (and drainage rate inferred from Figure 4.1) could be identified for short (from 1 to 
8 min) and long (> 8 min) drop ages. At the beginning, the film lifetime sharply increased and then 

45 
 
 
levelled off.  Specifically, for the drop age of 1min, the films only lasted less than 0.1s and their 
thickness dropped sharply from about 300 – 400 nm to the film thickness of instant rupture at around 
150 nm. For drops older than 1 min, the film drainage rate gradually declined, leading to increasing 
the film lifetime. The DI water films formed from the biconcave drops with the age of 8, 10, 20, 40, 
and 60 mins had similar lifetime and similar drainage rate. It is also interesting to note that all films 
formed from drops with age older than 1 min ruptured at a thickness at around 50 nm or smaller than 
50 nm (Figure 4.4). In particular, the DI water films formed from the biconcave drops with the age 
of 8, 10, 20, 40, and 60 mins ruptured at almost constant thickness of around 35.6 nm which is smaller 
than the thickness of film rupture for some surfactant systems (Angarska et al., 2004; Qu et al., 2009).

4.4.2. Drainage and Rupture at Short Contact Time: Effect of Migration of Dissolved Gases 
We discuss here the effects of dissolved gases in mediating drainage and rupture of liquid films. 
First, one could raise the question whether the system was contaminated by organic compounds and 
salts. These contaminants could have come from the water and the experimental system itself, or have 
been absorbed by the glass walls during the experiment. However, as the water purity was checked 
for high resistivity and an unstable film was formed at the beginning, the former sources of 
contamination could be excluded. Furthermore, the contaminants like surfactants usually stabilise the 
films. In addition, all the glassware was dried by pure nitrogen and sealed from ambient air, thus the 
latter form of contamination could also be removed. Overall, the system was ensured to be free from 
contamination. 
The prerequisite for film rupture is the existence of attractive surface forces between the film 
surfaces. For foam films between two gas bubbles, the attractive force is usually assigned to the van 
der Waals force. In the case of wetting films, the van der Waals force is repulsive, and the electrical 
double-layer force can be changed to attractive by recharging the solid surface, for instance, by 
adsorbing multivalent ions onto a silica surface (Stockelhuber et al., 2004). Without the surface 
modification, the DLVO forces for the wetting films between an air bubble and a silica surface in 
water are repulsive, and the films are stable. If the surface treatment is done by a hydrophobization 
process with a hydrophobising reagent, such as esterification (Hampton et al., 2008), the wetting films 
on such hydrophobic surfaces are not stable and normally rupture quickly.  
Evidently, the DLVO theory cannot explain the change in the drainage of the DI films versus 
the contact time (the concave drop age) as shown in Figure 4.2: The water was free from surfactants 
and salts. Therefore, both the double-layer and the van der Waals forces should be constant and 
independent of the drop age. However, water always contains dissolved gases so that fish can survive.  
It was demonstrated that there exist clusters of nanobubbles of dissolved gases with a typical diameter 
of around 15-20 nm in DI water (Bunkin et al., 1996; Bunkin et al., 2006; Vinogradova et al., 1995). 
The long-range hydrophobic forces are often referred to the bridging of nanobubbles as measured 
between solid surfaces by atomic force microscopy (Attard, 2003; Christenson et al., 2001; Hampton, 
Donose, et al., 2009; Parker et al., 1994). However, none of the surfaces of foam films is solid, so 
there was nothing to support the bridging nanobubbles in the foam film studies. Therefore, the 
nanobubble bridging attractive force cannot be responsible for the rupture of the DI foam films. 

48 
 
 
Similarly, the nanobubble bridging attraction could not explain the rupture of foam films of dilute 
surfactant solutions (Wang et al., 2004, 2005) 
When constrained by the film surfaces and the menisci, the nanobubbles would migrate towards 
the film surfaces. The migration of the gas nanobubbles would make the DI water draining faster. 
The nanobubble migration slowed down with the age of the concave drops, reaching equilibrium at 
about 8-10 minutes of contact time. After this drop age, the change in the film drainage with the drop 
age was not significant as shown in Figure 4.2. The coalescence of the nanobubbles could enhance 
the film rupture which is discussed in Section 4.4.3.  
In addition to the effect of the nanobubble migration on the DI film drainage, the effect shock 
waves as a consequence of the bubble collapse on the film transient behaviour could be significant. 
In particular, the migration of nanobubbles themselves could amplify the surface waves on the film 
surfaces and could play an important role in the instability of fully mobile surfaces of water foam 
film (Sheludko, 1967). According to Vrij 1(966) and Ruckenstein et al., (1973), increasing the 
physical perturbation and surface waves could increase the rupture probability of liquid films. The 
film rupture by the thermal-capillary waves on the film surfaces is analysed in the following section. 
4.4.3. Comparison with the Theory for Film Rupture at Long Contact Time: Role 
Hydrophobic Attraction between Film Surfaces due to Dissolved Gases 
At very short drainage time, the transient film thickness was large (h > 200 nm). At this large 
thickness, the disjoining pressure, 
( )h
Π
, was significantly smaller than the capillary pressure,Pσ , 
and the DI water films drained by the capillary force as described by the drainage theories illustrated 
by Eq. 4.8 and Eq. 4.9 in Section 4.4.4. Due to the water drainage out of the film as time went by, the 
film thickness gradually decreased and became sufficiently small, so that surface forces started to 
influence the film drainage and stability. The influence of the surface forces on the film drainage is 
discussed in Section 4.4.4. Here we focus on the influence of the surface forces on the DI water film 
stability.  
The foam film rupture is traditionally explained by the growth of thermal-capillary waves on 
the film interfaces that are amplified by the attractive van der Waals force which rapidly increases 
with decreasing film thickness (Coons et al., 2003; Manev et al., 2005a; Sheludko, 1967; 
Stöckelhuber, 2004; Valkovska et al., 2002). In the case of wetting films, the important role of

coalescence between the gas-liquid film surface and nanobubbles formed at the solid surface in the 
film rupture has also been considered, as previously discussed in the introduction. However, the 
nanobubble theory on the film rupture remains questionable, at least for foam films such as those 
foam films obtained at long contact time in this paper, for several reasons. It is reinforced here that 
the formation of the nanobubbles “seen” by imaging with the AFM tapping mode normally requires 
surface treatment with liquids supersaturated by air or gases, usually by rapid temperature change or 
alcohol-water exchange (Hampton et al., 2008).  However, these required surface treatments have not 
been applied to prepare the solid surfaces used in the experiments of the wetting film rupture or to 
prepare the foam films. 
In this section, the rupture of foam films obtained at long contact time is quantified using the 
traditional theory based on the growth of thermal-capillary waves. In the conventional thermal-
capillary wave theories on foam film rupture, the critical thickness, 
crh , of film rupture can be 
predicted by a stability analysis of small amplitude thermal corrugations on thin films (Coons et al., 
2003; Manev et al., 2005a; Valkovska et al., 2002). Approximations for film thickness and disjoining 
pressure,

trh , and the (non-

the transcendental Eq. 4.3 - 4.5. 
The total disjoining pressure required in Eqs. 4.3 - 4.5 is usually expressed as the sum of the 
van der Waals and electrical double layer interactions. For the film thickness of 
35.64 nm
crh =
, the 
van der Waals contribution to the film rupture is negligible. For the symmetrical double layer systems 
of foam films, the double layers interaction is always repulsive. Therefore, there must be an attractive 
disjoining pressure component responsible for amplifying the surface thermal-capillary waves to 
cause the film rupture. Here we consider the hydrophobic attraction described by Eriksson et al.’s 
theory (Eriksson et al., 1989; Eriksson & Yoon, 2007) which describes the hydrophobic disjoining

mica surfaces, Eriksson & Henriksson (2007) obtained BEriksson= 0.50 mN/m which gives B=2518 
N/m2 for the expected strength of the hydrophobic disjoining pressure. The intriguing question as to 
how it comes about that the decay length
15.6 nm

significantly extends over such a long-range 
equivalent to a few hundred of water molecules has not been fully addressed. Here we emphasise that 
water contains clusters of hydrophobic solute molecules of dissolved gases, which can disrupt the 
hydrogen bond of the water molecular network throughout the water films, causing the long ranged 
hydrophobic attraction. Indeed, Eriksson et al.’s theory (Eriksson et al., 1989; Eriksson & Yoon, 

51 
 
 
2007) has been successfully applied for quantifying the behaviour of emulsion and foam films 
(Angarska et al., 2004; Paunov et al., 2001). 
 The electrostatic disjoining pressure,

Π , can be precisely calculated as a function of the film 
thickness using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. For the DI water films considered in this paper, the 
double layer interaction under the condition of constant surface potentials should be appropriate and 
the exact numerical solution to the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation can be semi-analytically 
described as (Nguyen et al., 2000)

double-layer pressure under the condition of constant surface potentials. The semi-analytical solution 
reduces to the solution of the Debye-Hücker linearisation and many other predictions obtained for 
special conditions (Nguyen et al., 2000). 
 Knowing the disjoining pressure by the approximation, the governing Eq. 4.3 - 4.5 can be

rupture, for example,

interval for hydrophobic interactions between macroscopic interfaces (Angarska et al., 2004;

4.4.4. Drainage at Long Contact Time (Drop Age): Effect of the Film Surface Mobility and 
Hydrophobic Attraction 
Knowing the disjoining pressure components from the prediction for the critical thickness of 
the DI water film rupture at long contact time, as described previously in Section 4.4.3, the 
experimental results for the DI water film drainage at long contact time can be compared with the 
available theories. We focus on the data for film drainage at long contact time, that is, when the 
critical thickness is constant, and both the transient thickness and the critical thickness are almost 
independent of the contact time; therefore, the effect of migration of dissolved gases on the film 
rupture and drainage can be neglected. 
 
Figure 4.5. Comparison between the experimental data (points) for transient film 
thickness at long contact time ( ≥ 8 min) and the drainage models with either rigid (dotted 
line) or mobile  (solid line) film surfaces as described by Eq. 4.8 and 4.9, respectively. 
Shown in Figure 4.5 is the comparison between the transient thickness of the DI water films

shown by the dotted line in Figure 4.5.  
 The significant discrepancy between the experimental data and the Stefan-Reynolds theory 
can be attributed to the nonslip (rigid) boundary condition applied at the air-water interfaces. The 
condition implies that both water velocity components perpendicular and parallel to the film surfaces 
are zero. The theory can be improved by relaxing the boundary condition to allow for partial mobility 
of the air-water interfaces, leading to the following prediction for the film drainage velocity:

where f is a correction factor for the film surface mobility and can be obtained by applying the stress 
boundary condition at the film surfaces. For foam films with rigid film surfaces (at high surfactant 
concentrations), f should be equal to 1 and Eq. 4.9 reduces to the Stefan-Reynolds equation given by 
Eq. 4.8. For foam films of dilute surfactant solutions or foam films of DI water investigated in this 
paper, the correct factor f should be significantly small but nonzero (otherwise the mathematical 
singularity occurs). For simplicity, the following prediction for the correction factor, f, is used to 
analyse the deviation of the film drainage from the Stefan-Reynolds theory (Karakashev & Nguyen, 
2007; Karakashev, et al., 2008;)

and the factor f approaches zero if both Bo=0 andMa=0. 
However, since experimental data for the surface (shear plus dilational) viscosity and the Gibbs 
surface elasticity (Bo and Ma) for the DI water films are not available at present, the numerical 
integration of Eq. 4.9 was conducted in conjunction with the Levenberg-Marquardt (Press et al., 1992) 
nonlinear regression (best fit) procedure for different combinations of numerical values for Bo and 
Ma. The model results are shown by the solid line in Figure 4.5. The excellent agreement confirms 
the hyperbolic dependence of the mobility factor,  f, on the film thickness, h, as described by Eq.4.10. 
It is also noted that there would be many combinations of Bo and Ma to fit the data in Figure 4.5. For 
example, if  Ma=0, the value Bo=90 would fit the data. Likewise, if Bo=0, the value Ma= 500 would 
also fit the data. Similarly, a suitable combination of Bo and Ma between 0 and the upper bounds of 
Bo = 90 and Ma = 500 would be found to fit the data as well; this happens because both the Bo and Ma 
terms in Eq. 4.10 have the same (first order) dependence on h which can be easily combined into one 
term for the best fit. For comparison, it should be noted that, to obtain the limit of film drainage with 
rigid film surfaces (i.e., f=1) as predicted by the Stefan-Reynolds equation, Eq. 4.9 would require 
Bo=10 000 (if Ma=0) or Ma=100 000 (if Bo=0). Evidently, the fitting results for the upper bounds for 
both Bo and Ma indicate that the DI film surfaces were indeed very mobile. 
In the above analysis using Eq. 4.10, the Boussinesq number and the Marangoni number are 
employed as the relevant fitting parameters. An increase in the value of the two model parameters 
indicates a decrease in film drainage rate. However, it is emphasised that we do not necessarily ascribe 
the observed drainage velocity changes purely to the change in surface viscosity and elasticity; it is 
simply a convenient means to compare drainage rates at varying film thickness with the standard 
drainage theory of Stefan and Reynolds, which considers nonslip (rigid) film surfaces. The effect of 
dissolved gases and nanobubbles in the film liquid on the film drainage could not be ruled out. 
Equations for film drainage would require further modifications to include the effect of dissolved 
gases present in water as clusters of nanometre-sized bubbles.

4.5. Conclusion 
In this paper, a special experimental method and procedure were developed to investigate the 
critical effect of the contact time (the drop age) between the air-DI water interfaces at proximity 
before the film formation on the film drainage rate, rupture and lifetime under the condition of global 
vapour saturation in the measuring cell. The method involved contacting the concave air-water 
interfaces for different times and examining the drainage and rupture of foam water films using micro-
interferometry with the Scheludko cell and thin film balance. The results have shown that gases 
inherently dissolved in water have a significant effect on the film drainage and rupture. In particular, 
the foam films of ultrapure DI water could last up to ten seconds and the contact time significantly 
influenced the film drainage, rupture and lifetime. When the two interfaces were first brought into 
proximity, the films instantly ruptured at a half-micron thickness. However, the film drainage rate 
and rupture thickness sharply decreased and the film lifetime steeply increased with increasing the 
contact time up to 8 min and then they levelled off. The constant thickness of film rupture was around 
35 nm. Migration of gases inherently dissolved in water might be the cause for the critical transient 
behaviour of the water films at the short contact time. The film drainage rate and instability at the 
long contact time were analysed using the long-range hydrophobic attraction and the extended Stefan-
Reynolds drainage theory that considers the mobility of the film interfaces. 
After this work was published in 2009, our research on this topic was postponed due to our 
commitments in other projects. Further investigations were resumed in 2015 which were reported in 
Chapter 5 and 6. During that period, few investigations had been made by other researcher which 
focused on evaporation and impurities (Yaminsky et al., 2010b), bubble speed and single salt at low 
concentration (Castillo et al., 2011; Firouzi et al., 2014; Yaminsky et al., 2010a). The key finding is 
that speed of liquid films or bubbles promotes film rupture or bubble coalescence. Yaminsky et al., 
(2010a) also reported that drainage of liquid films in water and single salt systems followed the DLVO 
theory. For example, liquid films in pure water can be very stable at low approaching speed and 
became less stable with addition of NaCl. The finding contradicts with the well-known facts about 
instability of bubbles in water and stability in salt solutions that were summarised in Chapter 2 and 
confirmed in Chapter 3. Nevertheless, mechanism of coalescence inhibition in salt solutions, and 
effects of hydrophobic forces and different salts in coalescence were still unclear. Our research was 
resumed in 2015 to provide better understanding about hydrophobic forces due to dissolved gases 
and effects of other hydrodynamic parameters such as solution and surface viscosity in stability of 
thin liquid films. Results are presented in Chapter 5 and 6.

Effects of Dissolved Gases and Solution Viscosity on Drainage 
and Stability of Thin Liquid Films of Salt Solutions

In preparation for publication 
5.1. Abstract 
Salts can stabilise thin liquid films and inhibit bubble coalescence. Despite vast research on this 
topic, the mechanism underlying the effect of ion specificity on inhibiting bubble coalescence is 
unclear. In this study, the effect of a range of salts (inhibiting and non-inhibiting, structure maker and 
breaker, monovalent and bivalent) over a wide range of concentration on drainage and stability of the 
thin liquid films was investigated using the micro-interferometric technique. The experiments were 
carried out under well-controlled saturated (non-evaporative) conditions. It is found that the films of 
all salts drain slower and last longer with increasing of salt concentration. The transition 
concentration, at which the films drain at a significantly slower speed and last longer, is in a similar 
range to previous studies. By correlating the film results with data of oxygen solubility, we suggest 
that the reduction of soluble gas in salt solutions causes weaker hydrophobic attraction between two 
film surfaces, which consequently leads to slower drainage and more stable films. The effect of 
solution viscosity is also analysed and may contribute to the increasing film stability. We conclude 
that the bubble coalescence inhibition caused by salts is due to several contributing factors. 
 
 

57 
 
 
5.2. Introduction 
In Chapter 3, by using the bubble column system, we have shown that the transition 
concentration for bubble coalescence and gas holdup depend not only on the salt properties (i.e. the 
ion type and their combination) as previously reported but also on the hydrodynamic conditions. 
Those results expand our understanding about coalescence at the macroscopic scale (bubble 
population), but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. To do that, we need to understand 
responses of thin liquid films formed between bubbles in salt solutions as discussed in Chapter 2. In 
Chapter 3, we started with the simplest system – thin liquid films in deionised water (DI). We have 
highlighted the existence of dissolved gases in deionised water (or liquid phase). We argued that the 
dissolved gases play important roles in bubble coalescence by acting as a long-range hydrophobic 
attraction and modifying water molecular structure according to the JC Erickson et al.’ theory. 
In addition, as discussed in Chapter 2, most studies in bubble coalescence have been only 
carried out in salt solutions up to 0.5M. Recently, Christenson at al. extended the bubble coalescence 
tests in salt solutions at higher concentrations (Christenson et al., 2008). They found that some salts 
thought not to inhibit coalescence indeed do at higher concentrations (>1M). They suggested that 
study on coalescence inhibition should be investigated over a wider range of salt concentration. 
Almost at the same time, other researchers studied the effect of high concentration on the stability of 
thin liquid films (Karakashev et al., 2008). They concluded that the results of film stability were 
consistent with results obtained in the bubble column tests (Craig et al., 1993b). However, it is noted 
that they studied liquid film tests in an open Sheludko cell. It meant that the gas phase was 
unsaturated, and the evaporation effect might occur on the film surfaces. This effect has been proven 
to play a significant role in the stability of thin liquid films (Yaminsky et al., 2010b). On this point of 
view, one question to be asked is whether the liquid film tests in the open (unsaturated) or close 
(saturated) cell reflect better the interaction between bubbles in the bubble column system. Moreover, 
we have shown in Chapter 4 that the contact time between two films surfaces in the close cell plays 
critical effects on the drainage and stability of the liquid films (Nguyen et al., 2009). We hypothesised 
that the migration of gases inherently dissolved in water changes the so-called hydrophobic attraction, 
which influences the film instability and bubble coalescence. 
Thus, in this Chapter 5, we aim to investigate drainage and stability of liquid films of different 
salts over a wider range of concentration (0.001M - 3M) in a close (saturation) Sheludko cell. We 
strictly controlled the saturation level and contact time between two film surfaces. The results show 

58 
 
 
that both inhibiting and non-inhibiting salts stabilise the liquid films at high concentrations under the 
specified experimental conditions. By correlating with the value of solution viscosity and gas 
solubility, we highlight that they may play critical roles in stabilising the thin liquid films. 
5.3. Material and experiment 
5.3.1. Experimental Methodology and Procedure 
The drainage, rupture and lifetime of foam film in salt solutions were investigated using the 
micro interferometric technique developed by Sheludko (1967). The apparatus used was described 
previously (Karakashev, Manev, & Nguyen, 2008). Details about the setup and the purity tests were 
described in Section 4.3.1.  
After the purity tests, films of the DI water and salts were undertaken. Before any measurement, 
2ml of the studied liquid was poured into the bottom of the Scheludko cell to saturate the environment 
inside the cell. The film holder of the Scheludko cell was then flushed many times with investigated 
solution before being filled by one biconcave drop of the solution. The cell was closed and left for 30 
minutes for thermal equilibrium and vapour saturation. Microscopic films of radius from about 90 
nm were formed by bringing the surfaces of the biconcave drop using the motorised syringe to pump 
out the solution inside the concave drop at a rate of 100 nL/s. As soon as the film was formed 
(identified by the appearance of a small interferometric image), the pumping was stopped, and the 
film was left to drain until rupture. Three subsequent film drainage events were generated and 
recorded for each drop of the solution before being replaced by another drop from the fresh solution. 
15-20 films were recorded for each solution to calculate average film lifetime. 
 Salty foam films were formed from aqueous solutions of ultrahigh purity (99.99% metal trace) 
supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (Australia) or salts roasted at 550oC. Some experiments were also carried 
out to examine whether any possible contamination presented by checking films of roasted and as-it-
is high purity salts. The results show no significant difference between two conditions, which means 
that potential organic contaminant in the salts can be ruled out. 
5.3.2. Calculation of Film Thickness 
Details of the calculation of film thickness are described in Chapter 4 

59 
 
 
5.4. Results 
Drainage velocity of the liquid films in water and eight different salts at the concentration of 
0.001-3M was measured and is reported in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2. We chose salts with different 
properties: structure-maker and structure-breaker, monovalent and divalent, and inhibiting and non-
inhibiting with aiming to gain a broad overview of various effects. We chose that concentration range 
because it covers the concentrations at which the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) 
surface forces are maximum (~0.001M) or screened (~0.1M). That range also includes the so-called 
transition concentration for coalescence inhibition (around 0.1M). 
5.4.1. Drainage velocity of the liquid films versus concentration and type of salts 
We observed that with the saturated experimental condition, films for all salts expanded rapidly 
to around 75-100 µm radius shortly after the suction pump stopped at the film formation. Most films 
maintained that size during drainage until reaching a critical film thickness and ruptured. Drainage 
profile and lifetime were recorded from the first appearance of interferogram until the film ruptured. 
Of around 15-20 films on each experimental condition, we selected one film for thickness analysis to 
build drainage profile. That selected film must represent typical fashion of drainage and lifetime for 
that condition (based on the film lifetime distribution) and had a radius of approximately 80-100µm. 
Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2 showed significant effects of the solution concentration on the film 
drainage. Films of distilled water drained fastest and were least stable compared with films of salts at 
all concentrations. For all salts, the film drainage velocity reduced consistently with increasing 
concentration from 0.001M to 3M. The inverse correlation between the drainage velocity and 
concentration was predominant for LiCl, NaCl, KNO3, CaCl2, and MgSO4, and surprisingly even for 
non-inhibiting salt NaClO3. However, the correlation was less apparent for KCl and CsCl. 
In addition, the difference in the drainage velocity of monovalent salts at concentrations less 
than 0.1M was modest. The drainage velocity of LiCl and KNO3 films at this concentration range was 
just slightly slower than that of DI water. However, the difference magnified and became apparent at 
around 1M. Similar drainage behaviour occurred for films of bivalent salts MgSO4 and CaCl2, but 
the transition concentration was lower at around 0.1M to 0.5M. At high concentrations (i.e. 3M for 
monovalent salts, greater than 2M for CaCl2, and 1.2M for MgSO4), films drained very slowly, 
gradually reached a critical thickness less than 50 nm (except MgSO4) before rupturing. Interestingly, 
films of 3M NaClO3 drained very slowly and were stable comparably with films of other salts. Noted 

60 
 
 
that NaClO3 is classified as “non-inhibiting” when researchers carried out the bubble column tests at 
the concentration up to 0.5M (Craig et al., 1993b). However, the results of this study confirm the 
finding of (Christenson et al., 2008) that “non-inhibiting” salts indeed inhibit coalescence at high 
concentrations.

5.4.2. Rupture thickness of the liquid films versus concentration and type of salts 
Film drainage velocity is known to inversely proportional to the film radius. In this study, we 
stopped the nano suction pump as soon as the first interferometry fringe of the film appeared and was 
visible at around 350-380 nm. The practice was the same for all salts at any concentration. Films then 
either stabilised at that radius range or grew slowly to the maximum of 150 μm (but rarely) until 
rupture. Films were relatively stable and uniform. We observed no dimple or anomalous films. After 
formation, films thinned quickly in the first five seconds to reach the thickness of 100 nm before 
gradually draining until reaching the critical thickness of less than 50 nm (except for 1.2M MgSO4 at 
80 nm) at which the film ruptured. The rupture thickness is summarized in Figure 5.3. Films in 
solutions up to 0.1M ruptured at the 25-40 nm range. The rupture thickness increased by around 10 
nm for most salts at 0.5M concentration before slightly decreased to below 30 nm when the 
concentration increased to 1M and 3M. In addition, type and valence of ions showed no direct 
correlation with the rupture thickness.

5.4.3. Film lifetime increased with increasing salt concentration 
A strong correlation between the lifetime and salt concentration is summarised and illustrated 
in Figure 5.4. Overall, the lifetime increases with increasing salt concentration. The lifetime slightly 
increases from below 6 seconds up to 10 seconds with an increase of solution concentration up to

0.1M. At concentrations greater than 0.5M, the lifetime starts increasing dramatically, especially at 
1M and 3M and for strong inhibiting salts LiCl, NaCl, MgSO4, and CaCl2. This trend of lifetime is 
consistent with the film drainage behaviour as showed in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2 above. With a 
similar order of the rupture thickness, the slower the drainage velocity the longer the lifetime of the 
film.

5.5. Discussions 
5.5.1. Transition concentration obtained in this study versus transition concentration obtained 
in other bubble column studies 
We confirm in this study that purified distilled water does form transient films under a properly 
saturated condition. These results do not contradict our previous report’s results (Karakashev, 
Nguyen, et al., 2008) which were obtained from tests in the open (unsaturated) conditions. Indeed, 
the water film ruptured instantly if we formed films immediately without waiting for 30 minutes to 
achieve the vapour saturation inside the Scheludko cell. The results for the water reported in this 
study align with results in Chapter 4 (Nguyen et al., 2009) and somewhat agree with results of 
(Yaminsky et al., 2010a) who observed very stable films of hours or days. We did not observe any 
such long lasting films in this study. More details about the effect of the saturation time on the film

stability are referred to our previous study (Nguyen et al., 2009), which suggested the migration of 
dissolved gas with time. 
Interestingly, we also confirmed that NaClO3, which was believed as a non-inhibiting salt, 
indeed formed transient stable films at high concentration (Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.4). At the 
concentrations up to 0.5M, the films drainage velocity slowly decreased with a slight increase of 
lifetime. However, the film at 3M drained dramatically slower and was more stable with the lifetime 
of about 30 seconds. By examining drainage profiles of NaClO3 (Figure 5.2), we believe that the 
transition would possibly occur at a concentration less than 3M and greater than 0.5M. However, 
additional tests at between 0.5M and 3M have yet to be carried out. This finding further supports the 
observation in bubble column studies by Christenson et al., (2008), who observed that non-inhibiting 
salts indeed inhibited coalescence at high concentrations (greater than 1M). We agree with 
Christenson et al., (2008) that coalescence inhibition and thin liquid film studies should be carried 
out over a wider concentration range to obtain a better picture about the effect of salts. 
With other salts, it can be seen from Figure 5.1 to Figure 5.3 that there was a gradual transition 
concentration at which the films drained significantly slower and lasted longer. It was approximately 
around 1M for monovalent salts and 0.1-0.5M for MgSO4 and CaCl2. However, whereas the transition 
concentration can be quantitatively determined in the bubble column or adjacent capillary methods 
by using light intensity or counting the number of bubbles coalescing, it cannot be accurately 
quantified in the interferometric method by using film lifetime. Thus, it is arguably not relevant to 
compare the transition concentration obtained in this study with the concentration obtained in the 
bubble column studies (Craig et al., 1993a; Lessard et al., 1971) given the difference in the methods. 
5.5.2. Effect of the solution viscosity on the drainage and stability of liquid films 
Figure 5.5 summarises the solution viscosity of investigated salts at varying concentrations. 
The viscosity of bivalent salts MgSO4 and CaCl2 increases significantly with increasing 
concentration. The viscosity of other strong structure-maker salts, LiCl and NaCl, also increases 
markedly with concentration but to a lesser extent. In contrast, the viscosity of KCl, CsCl, and KNO3 
decreases slightly with increasing concentration. The viscosity results of these salts align with the 
hydration theory that has been discussed previously (Weissenborn et al., 1996). 
By correlating the results of film drainage in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2 with the viscosity results 
in Figure 5.5, it would be reasonable to argue that the viscosity affects the stability of the liquid films. 

66 
 
 
As can be seen, the film drainage velocity of strong structure-maker salts CaCl2, MgSO4, LiCl, and 
NaCl decreased significantly with increasing salt concentration. This fact is consistent with increasing 
viscosity of these solutions. In rather opposite, the drainage velocity for the films of KCl and CsCl 
only differed slightly, which may be attributed to the slight decrease in viscosity of these salts at 
higher concentrations. The exception, in this case, is KNO3. Despite the reduction in viscosity with 
increasing concentration, its film drainage velocity decreased and film lifetime increased. 
To explain the correlation between the drainage velocity and viscosity, we revisit the drainage 
theory of small plane parallel liquid film, which is described as

where

the velocity of the film drainage, h is the film thickness, Pσ and π are the capillary 
and disjoining pressure, respectively, R is the film radius, μ is the solution viscosity. The correction 
factor, f, in the equation accounts for the deviation from the Stefan-Reynolds equation for drainage 
of the film with plane parallel and tangentially immobile surfaces. 
As described in the above equation, the drainage velocity of liquid films is inversely 
proportional to the solution viscosity. In other words, the higher of viscosity, the lower of drainage 
velocity is. An increase in viscosity has been debated to increase hydrodynamic barrier for film 
thinning between two film surfaces, which leads to the slower film drainage, more stable film, and 
therefore less bubble coalescence. This statement explains most experimental results above (except 
KNO3). In the case of KCl and CsCl, one would challenge that the drainage velocity should accelerate 
with the decrease in viscosity. Similarly, why do the films of KNO3 drain more slowly and last longer 
at higher concentrations despite the decrease in viscosity? As a result, one would conclude that the 
influence of solution viscosity on thin film drainage is not consistent and should be ruled out. Other 
researchers (Craig et al., 1993b; Karakashev, Nguyen, et al., 2008) used this type of logic to eliminate 
the effect of the solution viscosity. Craig et al. found some salts decreasing the solution viscosity but 
reducing bubble coalescence and therefore ruled out the correlation between the solution viscosity 
and bubble coalescence inhibition (Craig et al., 1993b). We accept that the difference in viscosity at 
concentrations smaller than 0.1M is not significant compared to the viscosity of pure water. In fact, 
the difference in the film behaviour was tiny at concentrations less than 0.1M and became 

67 
 
 
significantly obvious at higher concentrations. Indeed, the film stability only significantly changes 
after 0.1M. In the discussion about KNO3 above, it is possible that the effect of viscosity is still valid, 
but other factors dominate the viscosity to slow down drainage of the KNO3 films (which is discussed 
below). Therefore, we argue that the effect of the solution viscosity cannot be discounted and needs 
further investigations. 
In fact, the correlation that we have drawn above agrees with results from other studies using 
pair bubbles (Orvalho et al., 2015) or measuring bubble size distribution (De Preval et al., 2014). 
Those studies provided convincing evidence of the influence of viscosity on bubble coalescence.

5.5.3. Effect of dissolved gases on the drainage and stability of liquid films

solubility in solutions with increasing salt concentration. At low concentration (less than 0.01M), the 
salting-out effect is not prominent. There is no significant difference in oxygen solubility amongst

salts. At concentrations greater than 0.01M, the difference in gas solubility becomes clearer. At 
concentrations greater than 0.5M, the oxygen solubility decreases significantly and the difference 
amongst salts is obvious. In addition, bivalent salts CaCl2 and MgSO4 salt out oxygen more 
significantly compared to others monovalent salts. The solubility results apparently align well with 
the results of the film stability demonstrated in Figure 5.1 to Figure 5.3.

taken from (Khomutov et al., 1974; MacArthur, 1915; Yasunishi, 1978). 
In an attempt to rationalise the influence of dissolved gas on film drainage, we put the salt 
solutions into three smaller groups based on the similarity in gas solubility. Then we compared 
drainage and lifetime of the films within and amongst those groups. The comparison is displayed in 
Figure 5.7. Details of the arrangement are shown in Table 5.1.

What interesting in the data shown in Figure 5.7 is the clear correlation between the oxygen 
solubility and the film drainage and stability. With the decrease in gas solubility from Group 1 to 
Group 3, the drainage velocity decreases with the order: Group 1 > Group 2 > Group 3 and 
consequently the film lifetime increases with the order: Group 1 < Group 2 < Group 3. We 
hypothesise that as the concentration increases, the oxygen solubility decreases which results to 
weaker long-range hydrophobic attraction caused by the dissolved gases. That reduced hydrophobic 
force would lead to slowing film drainage and helping the film last longer. 
Craig et al., (1993b) raised the possible impact of the gas solubility on bubble coalescence. 
However, to date, there is no any direct evidence to support this. It is well known and documented 
that nanobubbles on the pre-treatment solid surfaces is responsible for the long-range attraction 
between hydrophobic surfaces (Attard, 1989; Attard, 2003; Attard et al., 2002; Hampton, Donose, et 
al., 2009; Hampton & Nguyen, 2009; Hampton et al., 2010; Meagher et al., 1994; Meyer et al., 2005; 
Tyrrell et al., 2001). However, it has been believed that this interaction could not be applied to the 
thin liquid film between two bubbles since neither of the surfaces is solid and thus no nanobubbles 
exist on the liquid film surfaces. However, we have demonstrated in Chapter 4 that migration of 
dissolved gases in the solution generated from aeration (not from the pre-treatment surfaces) could 
be responsible for the long-range hydrophobic attractions between liquid films (Nguyen et al., 2009). 
It was also recently found that dissolved gases could enrich at hydrophobic surfaces in the form of a 
dense gas layer (Azadi et al., 2015), which caused hydrophobic attractions. That evidence gives us 
the confidence to believe that dissolved gases can account for the stability of the water and salty films. 
Having said that, we are not entirely certain and are not yet able to model the effect of dissolved gases 
within the scope of this chapter. We also do not exclude the influence of viscosity as discussed above. 
Indeed, we hypothesize that there is no single mechanism to explain the effect of salts. It must be a 
combination of many factors either related or unrelated.

5.6. Conclusion 
We experimentally measured and analysed the stability of the thin liquid films for distilled 
water and various salts over a wide range of concentration. We also investigated the effects of solution 
viscosity and dissolved gases. From the results of this study and previous results in the literature, it 
appears that the viscosity and gas solubility of the aqueous solutions play important roles in the 
stability of aqueous films.  
Several conclusions about the stability of liquid films in salt solutions can be drawn: 
• Thin liquid films of distilled water are unstable initially but are more stable if the vapor 
equilibrium is acquired in the closed environment after 30 minutes. The observation can be 
attributed to the high concentration of dissolved gases at the beginning, which means strong 
hydrophobic attractions between bubbles. As the gases migrate to the surface with time, the 
gas concentration decreases, and as a results the attraction decreases. 
• In the presence of salts, the concentration of dissolved gases decreases due to the salting-out 
effect, which results in weakening the hydrophobic attraction and stabilising liquid films. 
The specificity in the gas solubility can account for the ion specificity in the film drainage 
and lifetime. 
• The solution viscosity may also play a role in the drainage and stability of the salty films, 
especially at high concentrations. 
• The so-called non-inhibiting salt NaClO3 indeed forms transient liquid films at high 
concentrations.

Effect of interfacial forces and mobility on drainage and 
stability of thin liquid films in salt solutions 
 
Phong Nguyen and Anh V. Nguyen 
 
In preparation for publication 
6.1. Abstract  
The experimental results for liquid films in salt solutions were quantitatively analysed by 
computational fitting using different theoretical surface forces theories and drainage models. The 
impact of the DLVO, non-DLVO, and surface mobility on the film drainage were investigated. The 
results show that the surface mobility has the most significant impact on the film drainage. The effect 
of non-DLVO (hydrophobic) forces is less significant than that of the surface mobility whereas the 
effect of the DLVO forces is negligible. The prediction by combining the extended Stefan-Reynolds 
equation (to allow relaxation of surface mobility) with the non-DLVO forces matches very well with 
the experimental results. The surface mobility decreases with increasing salt concentration, which 
explains the retardation of the drainage and prevents bubbles from coalescence. However, there is no 
strong correlation between the hydrophobic forces and salt concentrations. 
 
6.2. Introduction 
In Chapter 5, we have shown liquid film results for different salts over a wide range of 
concentration. There was a strong correlation between the film stability and salt concentrations. In 
addition, by correlating the film stability with the concentration of dissolved gases, we highlighted a 
possible role of gases as the hydrophobic attraction in causing the film instability, which agrees with 
the suggestion from other researchers (Craig et al., 1993b; Weissenborn et al., 1996). Finally, we 
argued that the role of solution viscosity could not be neglected. However, theoretical works have yet 

73 
 
 
been developed to validate those arguments. Therefore, this chapter aims to examine the strength of 
the hydrophobic attraction by using computational modelling.  
Besides effects of surface forces, surface rheology is also critical to the film drainage as 
discussed in Chapter 2 (Ivanov, 1980; Ivanov et al., 1974). It is well known that films with immobile 
surfaces thin slower than those with more mobile surfaces due to the air/water surface stress. 
However, it is still in debate that films of electrolytes are mobile (Henry et al., 2008) or partially 
mobile (Christenson et al., 1995; Prince, 1990a). It was suggested that a presence of a solute such as 
surfactants facilitates a shear stress on the surfaces, reduces the surface mobility and retards the film 
drainage (Angarska et al., 2004). In the case of salts without a surfactant, the surface tension gradient 
(Marangoni effect), which acts to reduce the surface flow of liquid films, was reported not sufficient 
to affect the film mobility (Weissenborn et al., 1996). Other investigators (Henry et al., 2007; Lessard 
et al., 1971) suggested that ions altered the structure of water molecules that are few layers beneath 
the air/water interface and change its mobility. The argument was supported by findings from other 
theoretical studies (Jungwirth et al., 2002; Petersen et al., 2006). However, there have not been any 
direct study on thin liquid films to validate the hypothesis about the effect of salts on the surface 
mobility. In that regard, this chapter aims to address that point by collating the experimental results 
obtained in Chapter 5 and modelling them using different drainage models.  The influence of surface 
forces and surface mobility with salts will be analysed and discussed. 
6.3. Method and Materials 
Details about experiments and results are clearly described in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5. 
However, for the sake of convenience to follow, a brief summary of the results is presented here. If 
required, the rest of the results are referred to Chapter 5.  
Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4 show the effects of salts on the film rupture thickness and lifetime, 
respectively. In short, most films ruptured at the thickness of 30-50 nm. In addition, the drainage 
velocity of all investigated salts decreased, and the films were more stable with increasing salt 
concentration. We observed that films for all salts drained very quickly at the formation and more 
slowly after the first three seconds. Films lasted from below 10 seconds in 0.001M solutions to 50 
seconds in the 3M CaCl2 solution. Most films maintained the radius below 100µm from the formation 
to rupture, but there were also few films expanding to more than 100µm at the rupture. In below 

74 
 
 
sections, we attempted to understand effects of surface forces (both DLVO and non-DLVO) and 
surface viscosity on the stability of surfactant-free liquid films. 
6.4. Quantitative Analysis and Discussions 
The classical DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) forces between two film surfaces 
comprise the van der Walls attraction (vdW) and the electrostatic double layer (EDL) forces. The 
vdW interaction can be calculated by either the Hamaker method or the Lifshitz method (Israelachvili, 
1991; Nguyen et al., 2004). For the liquid film, it can be combined as

When two charged bubbles are brought into contact, an electrostatic double layer force is 
caused by the overlapping of two double layers of ions of two surfaces. This electrostatic force can 
be determined by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Under the condition of constant surface potential,

Values of surface potential are required to calculate the DLVO forces. However, available data 
for surface potential is very limited, and the potential at high concentrations cannot be measured due 
to the hydrolysis. To examine the impact of the potential on film drainage, we calculated film 
thickness versus time using Eq. 6.1 to Eq. 6.4 with different assumed values of potential. The 
calculated drainage was very sensitive to the potential at low salt concentrations (smaller than 10-3M) 
but was not at the concentrations of equal or greater than 10-3M (as showed in Figure 6.1). As can be 
seen, the drainage profiles using different values of surface potential are the same at 10-3M. It has 
been known that salts have the most significant impact on preventing coalescence at a concentration 
around 0.1M. This study investigates the liquid film at the concentration from 10-3M to 3M. Due to 
the negligible role of the surface potential on the drainage at this concentration range, we adapted 
potential results for NaCl from another study (Firouzi et al., 2014) and used them to calculate the film 
drainage not only for NaCl but also for other salts.

The calculation was undertaken for all films of LiCl, NaCl, KCl, CsCl, CaCl2, and MgSO4 at 
0.001M – 3M. The vdW and EDL of the DLVO forces were calculated by using Eq. 6.1 to Eq. 6.4. 
Data for surface tension was adapted from (Weissenborn et al., 1996). Surface tension at 
concentrations greater than 1M was obtained by extrapolating the surface tensions curves from the 
Weissenborn’s study (Weissenborn et al., 1996).

theory (Eq. 6.1) are illustrated in red dotted lines. As shown, there is a significant discrepancy between 
the experimental and prediction results (using Eq. 6.5) for all studied salts at all concentrations. The 
actual drainage was much faster than the theoretical drainage using the Stefan-Reynolds lubrication 
and DLVO theories. The discrepancy is likely due to the boundary conditions used in the Stefan-
Reynolds theory, which is applicable for two rigid (immobile) surfaces whereas surfaces of 
surfactant-free salt films have been known not fully immobile. Immobile films always drain slower 
than mobile ones. In addition, the DLVO forces cannot explain the rupture of salty films. At 0.001M, 
the EDL repulsion outweighs the vdW attraction and the capillary pressure at film thickness below 
60 nm. In theory, films should be stable, but they are not, which indicates a presence of other attraction 
forces between bubble surfaces. For simplicity, these attraction forces will be referred as the non-
DLVO (

6.4.2. Effect of non-DLVO Forces in the Drainage of Thin Liquif Films 
With the questions about the surface mobility and non-DLVO forces in mind, firstly we 
employed another non-DLVO force which is represented as below using the power law expression

The Eq. 6.6 was chosen because it was successfully used to predict the strength of hydrophobic

the characterised K232 constant of the non-DLVO (or hydrophobic) forces can be compared with the

Eq. 6.8 was used to find the best fit of the theoretical drainage to the experimental data as Eq. 
6.7 by using the Solver function in Excel. We carried out fitting for different salts at various 
concentrations. The theoretical drainages with the extended-DLVO forces and the Stefan-Reynolds 
equation (Eq. 6.4) are shown as the solid red lines from Figure 6.2 to Figure 6.7. As shown for all 
salts and concentrations, the fitting using the extended-DLVO forces (solid red lines) is better than 
using only the DLVO forces (dotted red lines). Figure 6.8 shows the effect of salt concentration on 
K232. As shown, the values of K232 decreases consistently with increasing concentration for all salts, 
which indicate a possible decrease in the strength of hydrophobic attractions with increasing salt 
concentration. Other studies, which measured bubble stability in salt solutions using the pair bubble 
setup (Lessard et al., 1971) and the bubble column setup (Craig et al., 1993b), reported an increase in 
bubble stability with increasing salt concentration. They attributed the decrease in bubble stability to 
the decreased of hydrophobic forces (Craig et al., 1993b). The presence of the hydrophobic force has 
been well accepted but its origin is still in debate. With analysis presented in Chapter 5, we 
hypothesized that the hydrophobic attraction between bubbles could be attributed to the dissolved 
gases in solutions. 
However, if only the non-DLVO forces were applied, the model matched poorly with the 
experimental results especially at low salt concentrations and at the film thickness greater than 100 
nm. The films actually thinned much faster than the prediction speed calculated by using the Stefan-
Reynolds equation (Eq. 6.8). The discrepancy is attributed to the fact that the Stefan-Reynolds 
equation is ideally applicable to a system with two rigid (fully immobile) surfaces as mentioned 
above. (Wang et al., 2004) successfully modelled the drainage of liquid films by using the Stefan-
Reynolds equation and the extended DLVO in the system of NaCl and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate 
surfactant. Surfactants have been known to immobilise the air/water interfaces due to the surface 
tension gradient along film surfaces (Marangoni effect) (Manev et al., 1974; Ostrach, 1982; Scriven 
et al., 1960), which explains the success of the Stefan-Reynolds model in their study. In fact, the 
influence of salts on surface mobility and stability of liquid films is still in debate and has been the 
research interest for many studies (Henry et al., 2008; Lessard et al., 1971; Marrucci, 1969; Parkinson 
et al., 2008).

6.4.3. Effect of Surface Mobility in the Drainage of Thin Liquid Films 
To examine the influence of salts on surface mobility, we used only the DLVO forces and 
extended the Stefan-Reynolds equation (Eq. 6.5). The film drainage can be described as

where f  is the correction factor for the film surface mobility and can be obtained by applying the 
stress boundary conditions on the film surfaces. For liquid films with immobile surfaces (in high 
surfactant concentration solutions), the correction factor f should be equal to 1 and Eq. 6.9 reduces to 
the Stefan-Reynolds equation given by Eq. 6.5. Surface velocity can affect drainage velocity through 
surface diffusion and surface viscosity (Ivanov, 1980). For surfactant-free foam films as investigated 
in this thesis, the surface diffusion is negligible, as shown by (Weissenborn et al., 1995), which is due 
to the absence of surfactant, and depletion or low density of ions at the air/water interfaces. Therefore, 
the surface mobility is investigated through the surface viscosity; then the correction f factor should 
be described as

where λk is the k-th root of the Bessel function of the first kind and zero order, Bo = μs/(Rμ) is the 
dimensionless Boussinesq number which is a function of the surface (shear plus dilational) viscosity, 
μs. More details about how the equation was derived can be found in another study (Karakashev & 
Nguyen, 2007).  
Eq. 6.10 was again numerically integrated to obtain transient film thickness using the VBA 
Excel Solver for stiff differential equations. The numerical integration of Eq. 6.10 was carried out 
using the nonlinear regression (best fit) procedure for different numerical values for Bo. The model 
results are shown in the green dotted lines in Figure 6.2 to Figure 6.7. As shown, the fitting improves 
significantly, and the prediction results match reasonably well with the experimental data for all 
investigated salts at various concentrations. The results suggest that the surface viscosity representing 
by the Bo number indeed affects the film drainage at all film thickness. Apart from few exceptions 
such as films of 0.01M CsCl, 2M CaCl2, 0.5M and 1.2M MgSO4 of which prediction drainages match 

80 
 
 
very well with the experimental results, the fitting for other films seems to be at best at the early 
thinning stage when the film thickness is still above 70 nm. As the film thins, the discrepancy between 
the prediction and experimental results appears and is most significant at the rupture with the 
thickness around 20 nm to 50 nm, depending on the type and concentration of salts. As the film 
thickness is well below 100 nm, the prediction using the DLVO theory and the extended Stefan-
Reynolds equation (Eq. 6.9) underestimates the thinning velocity. When the thickness is below 70 
nm, the effect of surface forces is operational. The discrepancy at low thickness suggests that an 
attraction hydrophobic force, which is negligible at the thickness greater than 70nm, is probably 
acting. This observation agrees with previous results about the interaction range of the hydrophobic 
forces, which is well below 100 nm. 
Figure 6.9 shows the effect of salt concentration on the fitted Bo number for different salts. The 
most striking result of Figure 6.9 is that salt concentration has a profound impact on the Bo value. 
The Bo number increases exponentially with increasing salt concentration. An increase in the Bo 
value indicates an increase in surface viscosity. As discussed, the surface viscosity directly relates to 
the surface mobility given the negligibility of surface diffusion for the surfactant-free films 
investigated in this study. Therefore, the increase in the Bo value would also mean a decrease in 
surface mobility and as results, slow drainage speed (Ivanov, 1980). For example, the Bo value for 
the film of 0.001M NaCl is 236 compared with around 600 for the 3M NaCl film. For comparison, 
the Bo for DI water film is 58 and to obtain the film drainage with rigid film surfaces (i.e., f=1) as by 
the Stefan-Reynolds equation, Eq. 6.4 would require Bo=60000. Evidently, lower results of the fitted 
Bo indicate that surfaces of salty films are not either fully immobile or mobile, but are partially 
immobile. In addition, the surface mobility decreases with increasing concentration of all salts. 
However, we re-emphasized that it is not necessary to ascribe the observed changes in drainage 
velocity purely to the change in surface viscosity; it is merely a convenient means to compare drainage 
rates under certain conditions with the standard drainage theory of Stefan-Reynolds that considers 
nonslip (rigid) film surfaces. 
6.4.4. Combining Effects of the Surface Mobility and non-DLVO Forces in the Drainage of 
Thin Liquid Films 
As noted just above, employing invidually the surface viscosity factor (representing by the Bo 
number) and the DLVO forces does not satisfactorily predict the film drainage at a thickness below 
70 nm. It was also reported in Section 6.4.2 that the extended DLVO forces improve the fitting 

81 
 
 
between the modelled and experimental drainages. Therefore, in this section we employed both 
surface viscosity and extended DLVO to model the film drainage. The drainage equation becomes

(6.11)
In this case, the Bo and K232 are the fitting parameters for the Excel Solver function. We have 
tried to fit Bo and K232 separately and simultaneously. With the first method, we fitted using Eq. 6.5 
and Eq. 6.6 as in the previous section and the obtained Bo values are summarised in Figure 6.9. 
Afterwards, we used the fitted Bo value for Eq. 6.7 to find the best fit with K232 as the fitting parameter. 
With the latter method, both Bo and K232 are the fitting parameters. We found that the values of Bo 
and K232 obtained from two methods for the same fitting conditions differed by around 10%, few by 
up to 20% but was still in the same magnitude order. The difference did not significantly affect how 
the results were presented and explained. For simplicity to refer to Section 6.4.3, we chose to report 
data from the former fitting method. 
The prediction results are presented as the solid green lines in Figure 6.2 to Figure 6.7. As can 
be seen, the matching between the prediction and experimental results is excellent for all salts and 
concentrations. The discrepancy between prediction and experimental results at film thickness 
smaller than 70 nm as discussed in Section 6.4.3 was resolved by the addition of the hydrophobic 
factor K232. The fitted values of Bo and K232 are summarised in Figure 6.9 and Figure 6.10, 
respectively. Evidently, both surface viscosity and hydrophobic forces play important roles in the 
stability of salt films. From Figure 6.9, the higher of the salt concentration, the higher of the Bo 
number. It means that the films are less mobile and thin slower. In addition, Figure 6.10 shows that 
the hydrophobic attractions representing by K232 do indeed exist, play a role in the thinning and 
rupture thickness of the salt films. However, the dependence of the hydrophobic strength, indicating 
by the K232 value, on the salt concentration and type is not consistent. The inconsistency is not fully 
understood, but it reflects the complexity of the hydrophobic forces, especially when it was 
investigated simultaneously with the surface rheology.  
The strong correlation between the increasing Bo value and the increasing salt concentration 
(Figure 6.9) matches closely with the increasing film lifetime (Figure 5.4 above). It indicates that a 
decrease in surface viscosity (can be called surface mobility in this case) under the effect of salts is 
likely the reason for the film stability and inhibition by a retardation of film drainage. Details about 

82 
 
 
the mechanism by which salts increase surface viscosity and decrease surface mobility are not entirely 
clear. However, we suggest that interactions between ions and water at the air/water interfaces are a 
possible mechanism. Interfaces between air and deionised water are mostly mobile or slip due to the 
self-diffusion of water molecules (Lessard et al., 1971). Accordingly, water of a liquid film between 
two bubbles can easily drain out in the lamella direction to bring the film to a critical rupture thickness 
and lead to coalescence (Ivanov, 1980; Marrucci, 1969). However, the presence of salts at surface 
layers of bubbles can decrease the water mobility by hydration (Lessard et al., 1971; Weissenborn et 
al., 1995) and retards the film drainage. The higher of the salt concentration, the more interfacial 
water molecules interact with ions (Baldelli et al., 2002; Jungwirth et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2004; 
Schnitzer et al., 1999). The enhanced structure due to hydration should immobilise the interfacial 
water molecules and leads to formation of resistance to the liquid flow on layers beneath the 
interfaces. The resistance reduces the film drainage rate and prevents bubbles from coalescence. If 
this hypothesis can be justified, then a correlation between the Bo value and hydration energy, which 
is dependent on size and valence of ions, is expected to exist. Small ions (Li+, Na+) and multivalence 
ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-), which have highest hydration energy (Lessard et al., 1971; Weissenborn et 
al., 1995), should have higher Bo values and lower transition concentrations for inhibition than other 
bigger ions (K+, Cs+). While the transition concentration seems to follow this relationship showing 
by the film lifetime (Figure 5.4), the Bo values among different salts summarised in Figure 6.9 cannot 
be explained. KCl and CsCl, in fact, have higher Bo values than other structure-enhanced salts. There 
probably exist others mechanisms that have not been aware of in this discussion and still play a role.

6.5. Conclusions 
We have analysed and modelled experimental results for different salts and concentrations to 
examine impacts of hydrophobic forces and surface mobility on the film drainage and stability. The 
prediction using the extended Stefan-Reynolds equation and extended DLVO theory matches very 
well with the experimental data. The results show that both surface mobility and hydrophobic forces 
simultaneously affect the film drainage and stability. Surface mobility decreases with increasing salt 
concentrations, which leads to a retardation of drainage and prevents bubbles from coalescence. 
However, the effect of the hydrophobic forces in the film drainage is not consistent when it was 
investigated simultaneously with the surface mobility.

Chapter 7. Summary 
The addition of salts prevents coalescence of bubbles in pure water. Some salts inhibit the 
coalescence at around 0.1M whereas others stabilise bubbles at much larger concentrations. Many 
mechanisms of the ion specificity on the inhibition have been proposed, but none has been fully 
validated. This thesis provided experimental and modelled results about stability and coalescence of 
bubbles in salt solutions in a bubble column and thin liquid films to improve our current 
understanding about the process. Below is the summary of the results based on the hypotheses 
proposed in Chapter 1.  
i. 
Coalescence of bubbles is governed not only by type and concentration of salts but also the 
superficial velocity of the feeding gas. 
To validate this hypothesis, the transition concentration for bubble coalescence inhibition of 
different salts with a bubble column system was correlated with the superficial gas velocity. 
It was shown that the transition salt concentration of all investigated salts decreases with 
increasing superficial gas velocity. The gas holdup was also measured. The results show that 
the transition salt concentration for bubble coalescence and gas holdup depend not only on 
the salt properties (i.e. the ion type and their combination) as previously reported but also on 
the superficial gas velocity.

The hydrophobic attraction between film surfaces is due to dissolved gases existing in the 
liquid film. The decrease of coalescence with increasing concentrations may be attributable 
to the reduction in gas concentration in the solution due to the salting-out effect. 
To validate this hypothesis, firstly we carried out micro-interferometry liquid film 
experiments for distilled water at different contact times between two bubble surfaces. The 
results show that the contact time significantly influences the film drainage, rupture and 
lifetime. The longer the contact time, up to 10 minutes, the more stable of the liquid films. 
The thickness of film rupture was 35 nm. Possible contamination was vigorously investigated 
and ruled out. It is suggested that migration of gases inherently dissolved in water might cause 
the transient behaviour of the water films at the short contact time. The film drainage rate and 
instability at the long contact time were analysed employing JC Erikson et al.’s (1989) 
phenomenological theory of long-range hydrophobic attraction and the hypothesis of water

molecular structure modified by dissolved gases, and the extended Stefan-Reynolds theory by 
incorporating the mobility of the air-DI water interfaces. Afterwards, we undertook liquid film 
experiments for different salts at various concentrations under well-controlled conditions. The 
most striking feature is that film lifetime increased with increasing salt concentration. One of 
the arguments being made is that the concentration of dissolved gases decreases with 
increasing concentration, which leads to weaker hydrophobic attraction and more stable films.  
iii. 
Solution viscosity is also of importance to the film drainage due to its potential role as a 
hydrodynamic barrier to prevent bubble surfaces from approaching. 
To justify this hypothesis, we correlated the results of film drainage and viscosity data. We 
reported that the drainage velocity of strong structure-maker salts CaCl2, MgSO4, LiCl, and 
NaCl decreases significantly with increasing salt concentration, which is consistent with the 
increase of solution viscosity. On another hand, the drainage velocity of structure breaker salts 
such as KCl and CsCl differs very slightly with concentration, which is reflected by the 
decrease in viscosity with concentration.   
iv. 
Surfaces of thin liquid films are partly immobile with increasing salt concentration due to 
interactions between ions and water at the air/solution interfaces. 
To examine this hypothesis, we extended the Stefan-Reynolds theory to allow relaxation of 
the boundary conditions of film surfaces and used the extended Stefan-Reynolds equation to 
fit to the experimental results. The Bo value, which represents the surface viscosity of the 
film, was the fitting parameter. The results show that the Bo value increases with increasing 
salt concentration. With the surface gradient to be neglected in the surfactant-free system, the 
surface viscosity plays the main role in deciding the surface mobility. Therefore, the increase 
in Bo also means a decrease in surface mobility, which explains the stability of liquid films 
and bubbles at high salt concentrations. 
v. 
Thin liquid films of non-inhibiting salts are transient stable if the concentration is high 
enough. 
To validate this hypothesis, liquid film tests for the so-called non-inhibiting salt NaClO3 were 
conducted. As shown in Chapter 5, films of NaClO3 at 3M are transient stable and the lifetime 
is even comparable with that of other inhibiting salts.
