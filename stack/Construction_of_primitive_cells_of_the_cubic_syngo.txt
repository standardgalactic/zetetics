Abstract: Topicality of the present article is connected with introduction of new verifying condition, 
which is required for estimation of structures of cores of the "elementary" lattices of the body-centred 
cell and face-centred cell (these lattices were proposed in accordance with the Bravais theory), on the 
basis of theoretical calculations of the ultrasonic velocities, which are directed along the edges of the 
selected cells and which are verified with the help of the experimental data that were obtained in 
accordance with the molecular analysis method. The purpose of the present investigation was as 
follows: to carry out evaluation of the core structures of the elementary and primitive cells of the 
body-centred and face-centred cell of the crystal lattice of the cubic syngony (for alpha iron and 
cuprum) in respect of their conformity with methods of the molecular acoustics. The method of the 
present investigation is based on comparison of values of the ultrasonic velocities (longitudinal 
velocity, transversal velocity, and velocity within the rod), which were calculated on the basis of the 
relevant theory and which are transmitted over edges of the primitive cell that is constructed (for alpha 
iron and cuprum), with the values of these velocities of the ultrasound, which were obtained 
experimentally with the help of the molecular acoustics method for these materials. Introduction of the 
additional criterion (requirement) in respect of selection of the least cell on the basis of the molecular 
analysis has made it possible to draw the conclusion that cores of the "elementary" cells of the body-
centred and face-centred crystal lattices, which are determined in accordance with the Bravais theory 
and which are assumed as the basis of the analysis with the help of the analytic geometry method, are 
inconsistent with actually existing mechanism of transmission of the ultrasound over the interatomic 
bonds (edges of the cell). In addition, this conclusion has made it possible to reveal new type (that is, 
a new syngony), which is the basis of the core structure of these "elementary" cells. The theoretically 
calculated ultrasound velocities, which are directed along the edges of the primitive cell of the new 
type (for alpha iron and for cuprum), have been coincident with high accuracy with the values of the 
longitudinal and transversal sound velocity, as well as with the sound velocity within the rod, which 
were experimentally established with the help of the molecular acoustics method. 
Keywords: interatomic distance, parameters of the crystal lattice, core of the cell, longitudinal 
velocity, transversal velocity, frequency of vibrations, monoatomic two-dimensional planes. 
 
1. Introduction 
Physical and mechanical parameters (PMP), such as velocity of the ultrasound in the relevant material or 
mechanical strength characteristics (Young's modulus of elasticity, modulus of transverse elasticity G, and 
other parameters) are usually determined in the course of relevant experiments. These characteristics are 
always connected with the structure of the relevant material, that is with the relevant parameters of the 
elementary cell [1-2]. However, ambiguity of the criteria, which are usually applied and which determine 
types of various crystal lattices (see Figure 1), desire for introduction of maximum quantity of straight 
angles, which simplify description of elementary cells, as well as different quantities of atoms, which are 
contained within the unit volume of "elementary" cells, violate relevant principle of unity in respect of

selection of the cell structures in accordance with the Bravais theory. In addition, this theory does not 
envisage any possibilities of existence of the monoatomic two-dimensional materials [3], which were found 
during previous years. 
The main attention in the present article was paid to the cubic syngony (see Figure 2), because of majority 
of materials, which are used in the metal goods industry, are always characterised by this kind of crystal 
lattices. It is well known that geometrical theory of development of the crystal structure was proposed by 
Bravais in 1849 [4], as well as that this theory is utilised (up to the present time) for development of 
mathematical models in the course of investigation of structure of various materials with the help of the 
following methods: method of deformation, method of the X-ray analysis of crystal structure, as well as with 
the help of the molecular acoustics method. 
 
Figure 1. Types of the crystal lattice depending on the syngony 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
In the course of analysis of all the syngonies, which are presented in the Figure 1, in accordance with the 
Bravais theory, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that volumes of the primitive cells (with the 
tetragonal, rhombic, rhombohedral, monoclinic, triclinic and cubic syngonies) are only created by means of 
interaction of the atoms, which are only situated in two neighbouring parallel planes. It is possible that, in the 
course of introduction of such determination Bravais supposed existence of certain monoatomic two-
dimensional materials. However, Mr. Bravais did not introduce any determination of the monoatomic two-
dimensional materials. Therefore, taking into consideration relevant classification of types of the crystal 
lattices, which are presented in the Figure 1, it is possible to demonstrate that there exist certain cores of 
crystal lattices, structure of cells of which is created in three atomic planes. 
So, for example, crystal lattices in the cubic syngony are created both by two atomic planes α and β (see 
Figure 2a), and three atomic planes α, β, and γ (see Figure 2 b-c), which are revealed in the course of 
analysis of the "elementary" cells of the BCC-lattice (body-centred cubic lattice) and the FCC-lattice (face-
centred cubic lattice) by means of assignment of the "primitive" cell, within which the cell volume is created 
at the expense of the interatomic interaction of atoms, which are situated in two neighbouring parallel planes 
(see Figure 3 a-b) [5].

Therefore, a primitive cell is usually presented as the minimum volume of the crystal. Translations of this 
crystal volume in three dimensions (parallel translations) make it possible to construct the three-dimensional 
crystal lattice of the entire volume of the relevant material. Such elementary cell is usually characterised by 
the fact that it must comply with the symmetry elements of the final volume, as well as with the properties of 
the relevant crystal [6]. 
In his theory, Mr. Bravais has formulated three rules for selection of elementary cells: 
1. Symmetry of the elementary cell must comply with the symmetry of the relevant crystal. 
2. The elementary cell must have maximum quantity of equal edges and equal angles. 
3. Subject to fulfilment of these two rules, the elementary cell must have the least volume. 
Let us introduce the additional condition in respect of selection of elementary cells of crystal lattices of 
various materials (because of the fact that elementary cell must comply with the physical and mechanical 
parameters of the crystal) with the help of the following statement: 
4. Longitudinal velocity and transversal velocity of the ultrasound transmission within the material 
volume, which are determined in the course of relevant experiments, must comply with the theoretically 
calculated sound velocities, which propagate along the edges of the elementary cell that was constructed 
(that is, selected), thus confirming conditions of actual existence of such elementary cell. Therefore, in order 
to ensure strict assignment of the elementary (primitive) cell in this article, we will utilise the molecular 
acoustics method, which ensures possibility to compare velocities of transmission of the sound (ultrasonic) 
waves in the material [7], provided that these velocities were obtained in accordance with relevant 
experiments, as well as with the help of theoretical calculations. 
Taking into consideration the fact that longitudinal velocity of the ultrasound propagates over the 
interatomic bonds within the monoatomic planes along the edge length, which is constructed (that is, 
selected) for the elementary (primitive) cell, as well as taking into consideration the fact that the wave length 
is limited by any maximum value, which (in accordance with results of article [8]) is approximately equal to 
double radius of atoms, then it is possible to present the wave length (λ) with the help of the following 
expression: 
λ ≈ 2 · R of the relevant atom, metres, 
(1) 
Then, velocity of the longitudinal ultrasound wave within the plane will be presented with the help of the 
following equation: 
υ = λω m/s, 
(2) 
where λ denotes the interatomic distance, which is equal to the edge length within the plane, while ω denotes 
the natural frequency of vibration of atoms in the planes, which create volume of the elementary (primitive) 
cell of the relevant material. 
We have to take into consideration the fact that natural frequency of vibration of atoms within the 
elementary cell is limited by certain maximum frequency ωmax [9] that has the same value for all the atoms, 
which create volume of the elementary (primitive) cell [10]. At the same time, it is assumed that lengths of 
edges within the cubic primitive cells are the same (a = λ). Therefore, in accordance with equation (2), values

of the longitudinal and transversal velocities of ultrasound must have the same values (this fact can be 
confirmed in the course of investigation of the polonium, which has the same structure: the cubic crystal 
lattice). 
However, it is known [11-12] that longitudinal and transversal sound velocities for the iron (BCC-lattice 
elementary cell) and copper (FCC-lattice elementary cell), which were determined in the course of relevant 
experiments with the help of the method of molecular acoustics, are different. It is only possible to explain 
this discrepancy taking into consideration the fact that all volumes of the primitive cells are created at the 
expense of the interatomic interactions of the atoms, which are situated in two neighbouring monoatomic 
parallel planes. At the same time, in the elementary crystal lattice, within which the intermediate plane β 
exists (see Figure 4), the prohibition occurs in respect of interatomic interactions of the atoms between 
planes α and γ. It is possible that in this case the ultrasound velocity can distribute over the interatomic bonds 
at the level of minimum resistance. Therefore, let us introduce relevant prohibition in respect of interatomic 
interaction of atoms through the intermediate plane in order to ensure further theoretical analysis. 
Now let us calculate velocity of the ultrasonic wave for iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) on the basis of the 
introduced condition. From the very beginning, it is necessary to do the following: we have to construct the 
"elementary" cell of iron with the help of the atoms, which are situated in three parallel planes α, β, and γ 
(see Figure 4). 
 
 
 
Figure 4. "Core" of the elementary body-centred cubic cell of the crystal lattice of iron. This core is created 
with the help of the atoms, which have sequential numbers from 0 to 8 and which are situated within the 
monoatomic two-dimensional parallel planes α, β, and γ. 
 
Having assumed that energy of the ultrasound has already achieved the atom No. 0, let us analyse further 
transmission of energy over the bonds between the atoms, which create the "core" of the elementary cell of 
the BCC crystal lattice of iron (see Figure 4). This "core" is created with the help of two "primitive" cells, 
type of which is described in article [5]. The first cell is created with the help of the atoms, which have 
sequential numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 and which are situated within the plane α, as well as with the help of the 
atoms, which have sequential numbers 0, 12, 13, and 14 and which are situated within the neighbouring 
parallel plane β. The second cell is created with the help of the atoms, which have sequential numbers 11, 10, 
9, and 0 and which are situated within the plane β, as well as with the help of the atoms, which have 
sequential numbers 5, 6, 7, 8 and which are situated within the neighbouring parallel plane γ. In this case, 
these primitive cells comply with the relevant criteria for selection of cells. These criteria were proposed in 
accordance with the Bravais theory and they were described above already. Due to introduction of the 
restriction in respect of the interatomic interactions through a plane, there are no transmissions of the 
ultrasonic waves over the following edges of the core of the "elementary" cell: L1-8, L2-7, L3-6, and L4-5. 
The longitudinal velocity of ultrasound exists within the monoatomic two-dimensional planes α, β, and γ 
over the edges (interatomic bonds) of primitive cells of the following types: L1-2, L9-11, and L7-8. With the 
help of the experimentally established value of the longitudinal velocity of ultrasound in iron (in accordance 
with the data of article [13]), which is equal to 5.940 m/s, as well as with the help of the edge length L1-8, 
which is equal to 310-10 m (in accordance with article [10]; this fact is connected with introduction of the 
unified principle of the interatomic interaction for the cell volume), let us calculate frequency of vibration of 
atoms in accordance with the following formula: 
ωmax = υlongitudinal / λ, 
(3) 
ωmax = 5,940 (m/s) / 3  10-10 (m) = 1.98 1013 Hz.

3. Results and Discussion 
In order to calculate transversal velocity of ultrasound within the core of the "elementary" cell of the BCC 
crystal lattice of iron, let us determine the length of the interatomic bond L 1-0 with the help of the length of 
the interatomic interaction L 1-2 of the atoms, which are situated within the plane ɑ (length of the 
interatomic interaction in any of three monoatomic planes ɑ, β or γ has the constant value: L 1-2 = L 9-11 = 
L 8-7). Due to the fact that the central atom (which has sequential number No. 0 and which is assumed as the 
atom, through which sound is transmitted) is situated in the middle of the space diagonal, then (with the help 
of the theorem of Pyphagoras) it is possible to calculate length of the interatomic interaction of the atoms, 
which are situated within the plane β, with the atoms, which are situated in the planes ɑ and γ: 
L 1-0 = L 0-6 = L 1-2  (√ 3) / 2, 
(5) 
L 1-0 = 310 -10  (√ 3) / 2 = 2.598  10 -10 m, 
(6) 
Time τ(in seconds) of transmission of the ultrasound wave over the length of the interatomic bond L 1-0 
(taking into consideration the fact that frequency of vibration of atoms for the core of the elementary cell has 
the constant value) will be equal to: 
τ 1-0 = 1 / ωmax = 1/ 1.98 1013 Hz = 0.505 10 -13 seconds, 
(7) 
Theoretical value of velocity of the ultrasound transmission between the monoatomic planes ɑ – β and β – 
γ will have the following value: 
υ 1-0 = L 1-0 / τ 1-0 = 2.598  10 -10 m / 0.505 10 -13 s = 5.144103 m/s, 
(8) 
Then, it is possible to calculate the theoretical value of velocity of the transversal wave in the following 
manner: 
υtransversal = L 7-2 / (τ 1-0 + τ 0-6), 
(9) 
where L 7-2 denotes the "fictitious" interatomic bond between planes ɑ and γ. 
τ 1-0 denotes duration of transmission of the ultrasound energy over the interatomic bond L 1-0; 
τ 0-6 denotes duration of transmission of the ultrasound energy over the interatomic bond L 0-6. 
Because of the fact that (in accordance with equation (5)) lengths of the interatomic bonds (that is, edges 
of cells) have the same length, then (respectively) durations of transmission of the ultrasound wave over the 
lengths of these interatomic bonds will be equal to each other: 
τ 1-0 = τ 0-6 = 1 / ωmax. 
(10) 
In addition, equation (9) can be presented in the following form: 
υtransversal = L 7-2 / ((1/ω) + (1/ω)) = L 7-2  ωmax / 2. 
(11) 
If we will substitute value of the "fictitious" length of the interatomic bond (in accordance with the 
condition, which we have introduced, this interatomic bond does not exist), which is equal to 310 -10 m, and 
if we will substitute value of frequency of vibration of atoms in the planes, which create core of the 
elementary cell (this frequency is equal to 1.98 1013 Hz), into equation (11), then we will calculate the 
following theoretical value of transversal velocity of ultrasound: 
υtransversal = 310 -10 m  1.98 1013 Hz / 2 = 2.973 103 m/s = 2.940 m/s, 
(12) 
It is well known that value of the transversal velocity of ultrasound, which was obtained in accordance 
with relevant experiments with the help of the molecular acoustics method, has the value which is equal to 
υtransversal = 3,100 ± 100 m/s in accordance with the data of article [13]. In fact, the transversal velocity of 
ultrasound, which was calculated on the basis of new model of construction of the core of the "elementary" 
cell (taking into consideration the introduced restriction in respect of the interatomic interactions of atoms 
through the intermediate plane), has coincided with the lower boundary of the experimentally established 
value of transversal velocity of ultrasound in iron. 
Theoretical value of the ultrasound velocity in the equation (8) υ1-0 = 5.144103 m/s. This value 
describes transmission of the ultrasound over the face of the primitive cell between two monoatomic parallel 
planes is in line with the ultrasound velocity within the rod of iron. The experimentally established value of 
the ultrasound velocity (which was calculated with the help of the method of molecular acoustics) within the 
iron rod has the following value: υtransversal = 5.170 m/s [13]. Values of these velocities coincide with each 
other in accordance with the following percentage: 
% = [5.148/5.170] 100% = 99.574 %, 
(13) 
Coincidence of the ultrasound velocity along the edge of the primitive cell between planes and velocity of 
ultrasound within the rod can be caused by the fact that the rod has the strictly assigned ratio between the 
length and diameter.

Coincidence of the theoretically calculated values of the longitudinal velocity, transversal velocity and 
velocity of ultrasound within the rod was obtained due to taking into consideration the single frequency ωmax 
= Ϳdem of vibration of all atoms within the core of the "elementary" cell of iron in respect of all interatomic 
bonds (both within parallel atomic planes and within the interatomic bonds, which connect neighbouring 
planes). All theoretical calculations of the ultrasound velocity can be presented with the help of the single 
equation, which was proposed in article [10] and which is presented below: 
υ = L  ω  (1/n), 
(14) 
where L denotes length of the interatomic distance, which is expressed through the length of the 
interatomic bond of atoms, which are situated within the plane. 
ω denotes frequency of vibration of atoms within the core of the "elementary" (primitive) cell of the 
crystal lattice of iron. 
n denotes quantity of the interatomic interactions, which are used for transmission of the ultrasound to 
different planes within the core of the elementary (primitive) cell of the crystal lattice. 
 
 
Figure 5. Core of the "elementary" of the face-centred cubic crystal lattice that is created with the help of 
the atoms, which are situated in three parallel planes ɑ, β, and γ 
 
Introduction of the new verifying condition in the course of selection of the elementary cell, as well 
transmission of the ultrasound wave over edges of the cell, which is constructed, have demonstrated that the 
"elementary" cell of the BCC crystal lattice (this "elementary" cell was proposed in accordance with the 
Bravais theory) does not exist, because of the interatomic bond between planes ɑ and γ does not exist. In this 
case, relevant cell (Figure 3а), which is considered as the "primitive" cell and which is the basis of structure 
of the "elementary" cell, describes actual process of transmission of the ultrasound over edges of the present 
cell. Such "primitive" cell complies with conditions of construction, which are used for the rest types of 
primitive cells in accordance with the Bravais theory, in accordance with which the cell volume is only 
created with the help of the atoms, which are situated in two neighbouring parallel monoatomic planes ɑ and 
β. 
Let us perform similar theoretical analysis of structure of the "elementary" cell of copper, which has the 
FCC crystal lattice and which belongs to the cubic syngony as well. In order to do that, we will construct the 
core of the "elementary" cell of copper with the help of the atoms, which are situated in three parallel planes 
ɑ, β, and γ (see Figure 5). 
Atoms with subsequent numbers 1-14 (see Figure 5) are in correspondence with the entire core of the 
"elementary" face-centred cell, which is created with the help of atoms of four primitive cells [5] (see Figure 
6).

Figure 6. Primitive cell of the FCC crystal lattice is created with the help of the atoms 3, 4, 5, and 15, 
which are situated within the plane ɑ, as well as with the help of the atoms 6, 13, 12, and 14, which are 
situated within the parallel plane β 
 
Let us calculate frequency of vibration of atoms in the planes ɑ, β, and γ with the help of values of the 
longitudinal velocity of ultrasound, which were determined experimentally with the help of the molecular 
acoustics method. Value of this longitudinal velocity is presented in article [13] as υlongitudinal = 4.700 m/s. Let 
us assume (on the basis of condition of the unified principle of the interatomic interaction) that value of 
parameter of the edge of the "elementary" cell of copper is equal to L 1-2 = 3.6510 -10 m. This value was 
determined in the course of theoretical calculation, which is presented in article [10]. As concerns the core of 
the "elementary" cell of the FCC crystal lattice, the edge length of the primitive cell L 3-4 does not comply 
with the edge length L 1-2 (L 3-2) of the core of the elementary cell. This situation is observed within the 
primitive cell of the BCC crystal lattice. Because of the fact of introduction of the fourth point in respect of 
transmission of the ultrasound over edges of primitive cells, let us assume that longitudinal velocity of 
ultrasound will propagate along the edge length L 3-4. Let us present the edge length of the primitive cell 
through the edge length of the "elementary" cell L 1-2 as follows: 
L 3-4 = L 1-2  (√ 2/2) = 3.6510-10  0.707 = 2.58 10-10 m, 
(15) 
Let us calculate value of frequency ωCu for the atoms, which create volume of the primitive cell: 
ωCu = υlongitudinal Cu / L 3-4 = 4.700(m/s) / 2.5810 -10 m = 1.8211013 Hz, 
(16) 
We will calculate velocity of the ultrasound transmission along the length of the edge, which connects 
planes α and β of the primitive cell L 3-13, in the following manner: 
υ 3-13 = L 3-13  ω Cu, 
(17) 
In order to perform this calculation, we will present length of the space edge of the primitive cell L 3-13 
with the help of the length of the interatomic interaction of atoms within the core of the FCC crystal lattice L 
3-2 = L 1-2 = 3.6510 -10 m: 
L 3-13 = L 1-2  (√2 /2) = 2.58 10 -10 m, 
(18) 
If we will substitute value of length of the space edge of the primitive cell L 3-13 from equation (18) into 
equation (17), then we will calculate the following value of velocity of the ultrasound transmission: 
υ 3-13 = 2.58 10 -10 m  1.8211013 Hz = 4.700 m/s, 
(19) 
This theoretically calculated value of velocity of the ultrasound transmission along the edge, which 
connects atoms in two neighbouring parallel planes, has coincided with the value of longitudinal velocity of 
ultrasound within the FCC crystal lattice of copper. At the same time, the experimentally established value of 
the ultrasound velocity within the copper rod is equal to 3.700 m/s. Taking into consideration the fact that 
velocity of ultrasound within the iron rod has been complied with the theoretically calculated value of the 
ultrasound velocity along the edge (that is over the interatomic interaction of planes α and β of the primitive 
cell of the BCC crystal lattice), then it is possible to expect that mechanism of the ultrasound transmission 
velocity within the rod (in accordance with the principle of uniformity) within the primitive cell of the FCC 
crystal lattice of copper must be the same or similar. Therefore, it is not expedient to perform further analysis 
of such primitive cell (see Figure 6). 
This is the reason why we will introduce the additional condition for selection of primitive cells: 
maximum length of the primitive cell edge must coincide with the maximum length of the interatomic

interaction of atoms within the monoatomic plane. So, let us construct new primitive cell, which creates the 
core of the "elementary" cell of the FCC crystal lattice of copper (see Figure 7). 
 
 
Figure 7. Structure of the primitive cell of the FCC crystal lattice that is created with the help of the 
atoms, which are situated in two parallel planes and which comply with the introduced condition in respect 
of the maximum length of the interatomic bond within the plane. 
 
 
Figure 8. Core of the "elementary" cell of the FCC crystal lattice. This core is created with the help of 
four new primitive cells 
 
Figure 7 presents structure of the primitive cell of the FCC crystal lattice. This structure is created with 
the help of the atoms that are situated in two parallel planes and this structure complies with the introduced 
condition in respect of the maximum length of the interatomic bond within the plane. 
Let us perform construction of the core of the "elementary" cell of the FCC crystal lattice with the help of 
the atoms, which are situated in three planes ɑ, β, and γ, taking into consideration structure of such new 
primitive cell (see Figure 8). 
Now let us calculate frequency of vibration of atoms ωCu in the planes ɑ, β, and γ for the volume of such 
new primitive cell. In accordance with the results of article [10], maximum edge length of the primitive cell 
is equal to L 1-2 = 3.6510-10 m. This length complies with the velocity of ultrasound, which is equal to 
4.700 m/s (see article [9]) and which was determined experimentally with the help of the method of 
molecular acoustics. Therefore, frequency of vibration of atoms will have the value, which is equal to: 
ωCu = 4.700 (m/s)/ 3.6510-10 m = 1.2871013 Hz, 
(20) 
Taking into consideration the fact that value of frequency of vibration of atoms, which was determined in 
the equation (20) in the same manner for all atoms (both within the primitive cells of the FCC-lattice, and 
within the core of the "elementary" cell of the FCC crystal lattice of copper), let us calculate velocity of 
ultrasound along the edge that determines interatomic interaction of the atoms, which are situated in the 
planes α and β, L1-7 (see Figure 7): 
υ 1-7 = L1-7 ωCu, 
(21) 
Let us present value of the space edge length L1-7 with the help of the edge length L1-2 in the following 
manner: 
L1-7 = L3-2  (√2 /2) = 2.5810-10 m,

Therefore, if we will substitute this value into (21), then we will calculate value of the ultrasound velocity 
between the atoms, which are situated within the neighbouring parallel planes α and β. That is, this value 
corresponds to the edge of the primitive cell:

υ1-7 = 2.5810-10 m  1.2871013 Hz = 3.320103 m/s, 
(23) 
This value of the ultrasound velocity, which was theoretically calculated on the basis of the space 
diagonal and on the basis of the primitive cell edge, practically corresponds to the velocity of ultrasound 
within the copper rod. Difference of the theoretically calculated value of the sound velocity within the rod 
from the experimentally established value of the ultrasound velocity within the rod (which was determined 
with the help of the method of molecular acoustics), υster= 3,700 m/s, is equal to: 
% = [(3700 – 3328) /3700]  100% = 10%, 
(24) 
This error (10% only) is the allowable deviation due to the error in determination of parameters of the 
interatomic distance with the help of the method of the X-ray analysis of crystal structure (due to vibration of 
an atom near the equilibrium position [10]). 
We will use the following formula in order to calculate theoretical value of the transversal velocity of 
ultrasound within the core of the "elementary" cell of the FCC crystal lattice of copper: 
υ 2-11 = L 2-11  ωCu  (1/n), 
(25) 
It is necessary to point out that (in accordance with the accepted restriction in respect of the interatomic 
interaction through the plane) length L2-11 is the "fictitious" length. Therefore, quantity of the interatomic 
interactions n, which are required for transmission of ultrasound from the monoatomic plane ɑ into the 
monoatomic plane γ, will have the value, which will be equal to 2 (two). Then, respectively, the transversal 
velocity will have the value, which is equal to: 
υtransversalCu = 3.6210-10 m  1.2981013 Hz  (1/2) =2.349103 m/s, 
(26) 
This theoretically calculated value of the transversal velocity in copper (υtransversalCu = 2.349 m/s) differs 
from the experimental value of the transversal velocity 2.260 m/s (which was determined with the help of the 
method of molecular acoustics) by 3.9% only. Therefore, new structure of the primitive cell of the FCC 
crystal lattice complies with the condition of the ultrasound transmission over edges of the cell, that is, it 
describes the actually existing interatomic bonds of atoms, which create the entire volume of the constructed 
cell. Therefore, (in the same manner, as it was in the previous situation with the "elementary" cell of the 
BCC crystal lattice) it is possible to draw the conclusion that the FCC "elementary cell", which was 
described in accordance with the Bravais theory as the cube, does not exist.

described in the following manner: volume of the elementary cell is created with the help of the interatomic 
interaction of the atoms, which are situated in two neighbouring parallel monoatomic planes. In the course of 
thorough analysis of the structure of such "primitive" cells (see Figure 9 a-b), it is possible to determine the 
main characteristic of such primitive cells through the lengths of edges and relevant angles: 
1. For the BCC-cell (Figure 9a) lengths of the edges a = b ≠c, angles ∟αº =∟β◦≠∟γº; 
2. For the FCC-cell (Figure 9b) lengths of the edges a ≠ b =c, angles ∟αº =∟β◦≠∟γº. 
On the other hand (depending on the accepted names of sides of these primitive cells), it is possible to 
determine one common characteristic: 
a = b ≠c, ∟αº =∟βº ≠∟γº, 
(27) 
Development of the new type of the primitive cell confirms the idea of the Academician E. S. Fedorov
 
(which he has formulated in article [14]) in respect of the fact that the process of selection of conditions of 
the symmetry is the most important factor for subsequent development of the interconnected theory for 
analysis of all aggregative processes, which occur within the crystal lattice. This theory was clearly 
demonstrated in this article with the help of selection (that is, construction) of various primitive cells as the 
core of the "elementary" cell of the BCC-lattice and the FCC crystal lattice. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In the course of the theoretical analysis, which was performed in this article, it was established that cores of 
the "elementary" cells of the body-centred and face-centred crystal lattices (these "elementary" cells were 
presented in accordance with the Bravais theory, they are used in the models for estimation of various 
physical and mechanical processes, which occur in the course of deformation, as well as they are the basis of 
the analytic geometry method) do not describe process of transmission of the ultrasound over the interatomic 
bonds, that is, over edges of the cell within the selected (that is, within the constructed) volume of the cell 
core. The discrepancy, which has appeared between structure of the core and actually existing interatomic 
bonds, has demonstrated that the interatomic bonds through the intermediate plane do not exist. It has also 
demonstrated that construction of the cubic syngony is implemented by taking into consideration the 
interatomic interactions of the atoms, which are only situated within two neighbouring parallel planes. This 
conclusion corresponds to the majority of types of lattices within the same theory of Bravais. Introduction of 
the additional condition in respect of structure of cells (that is, requirement in respect of transmission of the 
ultrasound over edges of the selected cell) has made it possible to determine new type of the primitive cell, 
which has the following characteristics of the crystal lattice: a = b ≠c, ∟αº =∟βº ≠∟γº. This type of the 
primitive cell is used for construction of cores of the BCC and the FCC "elementary" cells. The theoretically 
calculated values of the ultrasound velocity over faces of the new type of primitive cell (within the alpha iron 
and cuprum) have coincided with sufficiently high accuracy with the values of the longitudinal sound 
velocity, transversal sound velocity and with the sound velocity within the rod. These values were 
experimentally established with the help of the molecular acoustics method. 
New approach to construction (selection) of the basics of structure of materials (that is, construction of 
the primitive cells, edges of which (lengths of the interatomic bonds) are in correspondence with the physical 
process of the ultrasound transmission) has provided the author of this article with possibility to carry out 
theoretical calculation of values of the Young's modulus of elasticity and G modulus of transverse elasticity 
with the help of parameters of primitive cells. Procedure of this theoretical calculation will be presented in 
the next article of the author, which will be published in future.
