For over 35 years, biological scientists have come to rely on the research protocols and
methodologies in the critically acclaimed Methods in Molecular Biology series. The series was
the ﬁrst to introduce the step-by-step protocols approach that has become the standard in all
biomedical protocol publishing. Each protocol is provided in readily-reproducible step-by-
step fashion, opening with an introductory overview, a list of the materials and reagents
needed to complete the experiment, and followed by a detailed procedure that is supported
with a helpful notes section offering tips and tricks of the trade as well as troubleshooting
advice. These hallmark features were introduced by series editor Dr. John Walker and
constitute the key ingredient in each and every volume of the Methods in Molecular Biology
series. Tested and trusted, comprehensive and reliable, all protocols from the series are
indexed in PubMed.

Preface
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) challenge current views on biomolecular communi-
cation because these proteins participate in functional biological complexes despite their lack
of 3D structures, a scenario which until recently was unimaginable. An important key to
unlocking the enigmatic nature of IDPs is the development of appropriate experimental
methods and tools for their analysis, and derivation of mechanistic models. Due to their
dynamic nature, IDPs expand the types of possible complexes, and they are highly challeng-
ing to investigate with traditional methods. However, with a remarkable rate, novel modes
of operations are being uncovered, leading to new methods, tools, and strategies developed
and modiﬁed speciﬁcally for studies of IDPs. Therefore, a Methods in Molecular Biology book
on Intrinsically Disordered Proteins: Methods and Protocols is warranted. This edition follows,
but is independent from, the ﬁrst successful books on the topic in this series published
almost 10 years ago. The edition covers methods to study IDPs in general and includes
methods to study very recent topics such as extremely high-afﬁnity disordered complexes,
kinetics that evades established concepts, liquid–liquid phase separation, and novel disorder-
driven allosteric mechanisms. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biol-
ogy™series format, the chapters include the kind of detailed description and implementa-
tion advice that is crucial for dissemination of good practice and for getting optimal and
reliable results in the laboratory. Thorough and intuitive Intrinsically Disordered Proteins:
Methods and Protocols helps scientists with different backgrounds to further their investiga-
tions of these fascinating and dynamic molecules.

Disorder for Dummies: Functional Mutagenesis of Transient
Helical Segments in Disordered Proteins
Gary W. Daughdrill
Abstract
Most cytosolic eukaryotic proteins contain a mixture of ordered and disordered regions. Disordered regions
facilitate cell signaling by concentrating sites for posttranslational modiﬁcations and protein–protein inter-
actions into arrays of short linear motifs that can be reorganized by RNA splicing. The evolution of
disordered regions looks different from their ordered counterparts. In some cases, selection is focused on
maintaining protein binding interfaces and PTM sites, but sequence heterogeneity is common. In other
cases, simple properties like charge, length, or end-to-end distance are maintained. Many disordered
protein binding sites contain some transient secondary structure that may resemble the structure of the
bound state. α-Helical secondary structure is common and a wide range of fractional helicity is observed in
different disordered regions. Here we provide a simple protocol to identify transient helical segments and
design mutants that can change their structure and function.

Introduction
By the end of the last century, it was well established that protein
disorder was a common, functionally relevant feature of eukaryotic
proteomes [1–10]. However, hypotheses to test relationships
between structure and function were fragmented due to the limited
number of examples where high-resolution data on the structure
and dynamics of disordered regions was available. There was also
ﬁrm resistance from a structural biology community reluctant to
ignore 50 years of protein folding precedent. As more disordered
regions were investigated, it became clear that tertiary structures
were not present, but unstable secondary structures were common
[9, 11–16]. In particular, transient α-helices are frequently
observed in disordered regions that form protein binding sites
[17–20]. In most cases, these transient α-helices become stabilized
when bound to another protein [12, 16, 21–24]. This is a good

thing for molecular and structural biologist interested in under-
standing relationships between structure and function of their
favorite disordered proteins because the physical properties of
α-helices are well understood, and it is relatively straightforward
to design mutants for an α-helix to interrogate structure and func-
tion [25, 26]. I will brieﬂy describe a protocol my group has reﬁned
over the years to identify protein interaction sites in disordered
regions, assess transient helical structure, and design mutants that
can either disrupt or augment structure and function.
I will discuss several examples my lab has worked on in the last
decade as I describe the protocol (Table 1). In four of the examples
(p53, cMyb, Sgs1, and COR15A), we measured residue-speciﬁc
helicity using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
[27–30]. In the ﬁfth example (MdmX), we are currently testing
whether a disordered region that inhibits p53 binding has transient
helical structure [31]. For p53, cMyb, Sgs1, and COR15A, we
made mutations that either increase or decrease helicity and tested
the effects on protein binding and used other functional assays. For
MdmX, we mutated aromatic residues and tested the effects on
autoinhibition of p53 binding.
As with any study of protein structure and function, under-
standing evolution is an important starting point. Early studies of
protein disorder suggested that their sequence evolution was less
constrained than ordered proteins due to a lack of long-range
interactions [13, 32, 33]. While this is the case for a number of
disordered regions, including phosphorylation sites, amino acids
that are buried upon binding to other proteins are often conserved
[10, 17, 34, 35].
Figure 1 shows a summary of a study we performed to measure
amino acid conservation in a database of disordered proteins
[34]. The ﬁgure shows amino acid conservation for ordered and
disordered proteins. The shaded regions show the range of conser-
vation observed for buried and surface residues in ordered proteins,

and the points show conservation for amino acids in disordered
proteins. The data provides some important context for under-
standing how to identify disordered regions that form transient
helical secondary structures that are stabilized by protein binding.
Some of the most conserved residues in disordered proteins are
tryptophan, tyrosine, and to a lesser extent phenylalanine. These
amino acids are some of the most conserved but also some of the
least frequent residues in disordered proteins [34]. This means they
are functionally important, which is supported by the fact they are
frequently buried at the interface in the bound state [36]. In con-
trast, residues like S, T, N, and D are less conserved and are usually
found on the solvent-exposed side of amphipathic helices. This
leads to an interesting contradiction; the interfacial residues will
be conserved but the solvent-exposed residues may not be. This
means that care must be taken when performing multiple protein
sequence alignments because there may not be a high level of
sequence conservation across the binding site even though the
interfacial residues are conserved [37].

Materials
The methods described in Subheadings 3.1 and 3.2 require that
you know the sequence of the protein and closely related homo-
logues. We will use the protein sequences to estimate disorder
propensity using IUPred2A and to perform multiple protein
sequence alignments using CLUSTAL W [38–41]. You also need
a computer with access to the Internet. In Subheadings 3.3–3.5, I

structure and a variety of methods to test protein structure and
function including site-directed mutagenesis, circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), quanti-
tative real-time PCR, RNA sequencing, ﬂow cytometry, and
growth assays. I will not describe these methods in detail but will
provide appropriate references. Whether or not you need to use any
of these methods will depend on your system and the hypothesis
you are trying to test.

Disorder
Predictions
and Sequence
Alignments
A disorder prediction is usually a good place to start. It will delin-
eate regions of order from regions of disorder and can provide
valuable
information
about
potential
protein
binding
sites.
Figure 2a shows a plot of disorder propensity for the human
tumor suppressor, p53, and Fig. 2b shows a domain schematic.
p53 contains a transactivation domain (TAD1/2), a proline-rich
region (PRR), a DNA binding domain (DBD), a tetramerization
domain (TET), and a regulatory domain (RD). The disorder pre-
diction in Fig. 2a was made using IUPred2A, which is one of a
number of programs that you can use for disorder predictions [40–
42]. To perform a prediction, go to the IUPred2A site at https://
iupred2a.elte.hu, enter the accession number or paste the sequence
in the window, select from the available options (either long or
short disorder), and submit the job. A new window will appear that
contains a plot of disorder propensity as a function of sequence as
well as a list of the disorder propensity values. This list can be copied
and pasted into any spreadsheet program to generate a disorder
propensity plot. In general, it is recommended that you use multi-
ple disorder predictors, and there are servers available for this
purpose [43], but for this demonstration IUPred2A is adequate.
Figure 2a shows that about 50% of human p53 is predicted to be
disordered. My lab and other groups have shown that the
N-terminal regions from residues 1–93 are disordered [12, 44,
45]. Other groups have shown that in monomeric p53 both the
tetramerization domain and the C-terminal regulatory domain are
also disordered [46–48].
In addition to disorder predictions, you should perform a
multiple protein sequence alignment to see if you can identify
conserved amino acids that may form part of the binding interface.
As mentioned in the introduction, this may be challenging if the
region containing the protein binding site has undergone extensive
sequence changes. In some case it may be necessary to narrow the
alignment down to the sequence that corresponds to the dip in the
disorder plot and restrict the alignment to closely related homo-
logues because sequence conservation may be low at noninteract-
ing sites, as shown for residues 21 and 24 in Fig. 2c. Figure 2c

shows a multiple protein sequence alignment of the Mdm2 binding
site for mammalian p53 homologues. Mdm2 is an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that negatively regulates p53. The alignment is for human
p53 residues 12–32. Notice in Fig. 2a that this region corresponds
to a dip in the disorder plot, which is often (but not always)
indicative of protein binding sites in disordered proteins.
Figure 3 shows another example of using a disorder propensity
plot to identify protein binding sites. Figure 3a shows a plot of
disorder tendencies for MdmX. MdmX is a homologue of Mdm2
and a negative regulator of p53. It forms a heterodimer with Mdm2
to ensure that p53 levels are kept low in the absence of cellular stress
[49, 50]. Figure 3b shows a domain schematic for Mdmx, which
contain a p53 binding domain (p53bd), an autoinhibitory domain

that contains two tryptophans (WW), a zinc ﬁnger domain (Zn),
and an inactive E3 ring domain (Ring). The p53bd is ordered and
binds to the same disordered segment of p53 as Mdm2 [51]. This
domain binds tightly to TAD1 of p53 but full length MdmX does
not [31]. We helped solve this conundrum by showing that the
WW domain loops around and binds to the p53bd and inhibits the
binding of p53 TAD1. The disorder plot in Fig. 3a was the ﬁrst clue
we had this was happening. We noticed the dip in the disorder plot
around residue 200 and identiﬁed conserved tryptophan residues at
this site (Fig. 3c). Using short peptides, we showed the WW
domain binds to p53bd and overlaps the TAD1 binding site
[31]. To promote a more disordered state, the pair of tryptophans
at residues 200 and 201 was changed to serine and glycine, respec-
tively, decreased the binding to p53bd, and inhibited p53 transac-
tivation in a reporter gene assay due to increased binding to TAD1

between p53bd and the WW domain reduced the binding of
TAD1 to p53bd by 400-fold [52].
3.2
Prediction
of Transient Helicity
If the strategy outlined in Subheading 3.1 allows you to identify
potential protein binding sites in your favorite disordered protein,
there are several ways to determine whether this binding site is
helical. Of course, our favorite approach is to measure residue-
speciﬁc helicity using NMR spectroscopy. We will describe a couple
of important examples where we do this in Subheading 3.4, but we
understand that using this approach may not be practical for every-
one. The simplest thing to do is try to predict the presence of helical
segments based on the amino acid sequence, but care must be taken
because transient helical segments in disordered proteins are difﬁ-
cult to identify using secondary structure predictors. We have had
the most success using Agadir (an algorithm to predict the helical
content of peptides) [25]. Agadir was developed using helix-coil
transition theory and only considers short-range interactions. The
performance of Agadir was evaluated using CD data from 1200
short peptides. It is well established that disordered proteins behave
like short peptides, which may explain why Agadir is able to predict
the low levels of transient helicity observed in disordered regions. If
you think you have identiﬁed a protein binding site based on
sequence but there is no predicted helix, it may form a beta or
irregular structure in the bound state (see Note 1).
We have used Agadir in concert with NMR spectroscopy and
CD to identify transient helical segments and design mutants to
augment or disrupt the helix [28, 30]. It is also possible to use
Agadir independently without the need for NMR or CD [53]. In
one case we used Agadir to help predict a transient helical segment
in the long RecQ-like DNA helicase from yeast (Sgs1) that forms a
binding site for topoisomerase III (TopIII) [28]. We conﬁrmed the
presence of this helical segment and precisely deﬁned its boundaries
using NMR spectroscopy, which was important for the functional
analysis we performed (see Subheading 3.5).
We also used Agadir in a study of the myeloblastosis oncopro-
tein, c-Myb. c-Myb contains a helical segment that is 20 amino
acids long with an average helicity of 40%. We used CD to measure
the helicity of a 53-amino acid fragment of wt c-Myb and 9 mutants
[30]. Figure 4a shows the helicity estimates from Agadir plotted
against the values we measured with CD. There is a good correla-
tion between the predictions and measurements, but Agadir sys-
tematically underestimated percent helicity. Pappu and colleagues
obtained a similar result with the PUMA protein [54].

3.3
Measuring
Transient Helicity
with CD Spectroscopy
The simplest way to measure transient helicity is with CD and base
your estimate of percent helicity on the molar ellipticity at 222 nm
(see Note 2). It is relatively inexpensive, requires a moderate
amount of protein, and does not require any labeling. There are
two important considerations when using CD to measure transient
helicity in disordered regions. CD does not provide residue-speciﬁc
information, and the signal you get will depend on what fraction of
the disordered region has transient helicity as well as the amount of
helicity. For instance, it will be difﬁcult to detect a 10-amino acid
segment that is 50% helical in a disordered fragment that is
100 amino acids long. Since there has not been a systematic assess-
ment of transient helicity in disordered proteins, it is difﬁcult to
know what percent helicity to expect in a disordered region, and
like so many features of protein structure under selection, the
percent helicity you observe will depend on the system and process.
In a previous report, Han and colleagues collected transient helicity
measurements from the literature for 25 disordered proteins and
observed an average value less than 30% [55]. If most transient
helical segments in disordered proteins are below this level, the
effectiveness of CD to assess transient helicity will be limited.

However, if the transient helicity is high enough to measure by CD,
as it was for c-Myb, you should observe an excellent correspon-
dence with percent helicity values obtained from NMR spectros-
copy (Fig. 4b). Whether or not the helix population for your system
is high enough to measure by CD depends on a number of factors,
including the quality of the sample and the CD spectra. Based on
experience we usually do not use measurements of fractional heli-
city from CD spectra below 10%. In Fig. 4b one of the c-Myb
mutants (L300P) falls into this category, and this point is not well
correlated with the rest of the data. If you suspect a short helical
segment and you are working with a longer polypeptide, you can
always have a shorter peptide synthesized to see if you can detect a
helical signal.
3.4
Measuring
Transient Helicity
with NMR
We recently published a book chapter that reviews how to use
NMR chemical shifts to determine residue-speciﬁc secondary struc-
ture populations for disordered proteins [56]. See this reference if
you are interested in the details of the procedure. Here I will
summarize two examples where we have used this approach to
identify transient helicity and then designed mutants to increase
or decrease helicity and change function. When performing NMR
spectroscopy on disordered proteins, you will have to deal with the
resonance overlap problem. See Note 3 for one strategy to reduce
resonance overlap based on minimal fragment design (see Note 3).
One might ask whether precise levels of transient helicity are
functionally relevant. We showed very clearly that the low percent
helicity observed for the p53 TAD is necessary for controlling the
binding afﬁnity with Mdm2 because of the energetic penalty asso-
ciated with coupled folding and binding [29]. However, increasing
percent helicity for c-Myb had a small effect on binding to the KIX
domain of the CREB binding protein (CBP) [7].
The p53 tumor suppressor was an early example of a eukaryotic
protein with mixed regions of disorder and order [44, 45, 57–
59]. As discussed in Subheading 3.1, the disordered N-terminal
TAD contains a transient helical segment important for binding the
negative regulator, Mdm2. Mdm2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that
targets p53 for proteasome degradation [60]. A short segment of
the p53 N-terminus from F19-L25 forms a stable helix when
bound to Mdm2. In the absence of Mdm2, this segment of p53
has the puniest helical character (Fig. 5a) that can only be reliably
detected using NMR. Figure 5a shows a plot of secondary chemical
shifts (SCS) of Cαs and helical frequency values obtained from the
δ2D method [61]. The only input required for δ2D is a table
containing the backbone and Cβ chemical shifts. The output
includes the populations for helix, beta, PPII, and coil. Consecutive
positive SCSs of Cαs are observed for helical segments, and negative
values are observed for beta structures. Helical frequency can also
be calculated directly from chemical shifts without using δ2D (see
Note 4).

We wanted to determine if the level of helicity observed for free
p53 was important for binding to Mdm2 and expected there
should be an energetic penalty associated with folding and binding.
To make this region of p53 more helical, we mutated the conserved
proline residues that ﬂank the Mdm2 binding site. Figure 5b shows
how transient helicity was increased by mutating a single proline at
position 27 to alanine (P27A). The P27A variant of p53 bound
more tightly to Mdm2. This resulted in more effective ubiquityla-
tion and degradation of p53 and decreased the transcriptional
activity of p53 in response to DNA damage [29]. In particular,
decreased p21 expression resulted in reduced cell cycle arrest at the
G1 checkpoint. Figure 5c shows the structure of p53 TAD bound
to Mdm2, and Fig. 5d is a sequence alignment of p53 TAD high-
lighting the conserved prolines that ﬂank the Mdm2 binding site.
In another example, we investigated the relationship between
helical stability and binding afﬁnity for the disordered TAD from
the myeloblastosis oncoprotein, c-Myb, and its ordered binding
partner, KIX [30]. We designed a series of c-Myb mutants that
increased or decreased helix stability without changing the binding
interface with KIX. This included a complimentary series of alanine,
glycine, proline, and valine mutants at three noninteracting sites.
The glycine mutants were used as a reference state to correlate
binding afﬁnity and helix stability. We measured the helicity of wt
c-Myb and the mutants using CD and NMR. Based on the residue-
speciﬁc helicity measurements from NMR, we identiﬁed a contigu-
ous helical segment in c-Myb that was divided into two conforma-
tionally distinct segments. The N-terminal segment, from K291 to
L301, was more helical than expected for a disordered protein with

an average helicity greater than 60% (Fig. 6a), and the C-terminal
segment, from S304 to L315, had an average helicity less than 10%.
Different effects on binding were observed when the helicity of
these two segments was increased or decreased. Mutants in the
N-terminal segment that increased helicity had no effect on the
binding afﬁnity to KIX, while helix destabilizing glycine and proline
mutants reduced binding afﬁnity by more than 1 kcal/mol. Fig-
ure 6b shows an example of how helicity was modestly increased
when an N-terminal ﬂanking proline was mutated to alanine.
Mutants that either increased or decreased helical stability in the
C-terminal segment had almost no effect on binding. Analysis of
binding free energies and helical stability for several of the mutants
suggested that multiple conformations are accessible in the bound
state. Figure 6c shows the structure of c-Myb TAD bound to the
Kix domain of the CREB binding protein, and Fig. 6d is a sequence
alignment of c-Myb TAD highlighting the conserved prolines that
ﬂank the Kix binding site.
Figures 5d and 6d show a curious feature we have identiﬁed for
some disordered protein binding sites with transient helicity. The
regions that become helical are ﬂanked by conserved proline resi-
dues [62]. The fact that conserved prolines are frequently found
ﬂanking helical regions suggests they are functionally important. It
is tempting to speculate that ﬂanking prolines keep helicity low and
control the energetic penalty for coupled folding and binding. This
appears to be the case for p53 but not c-Myb or the mixed lineage
leukemia (MLL) protein [63].

Mutant Design
In addition to the mutants described in Subheading 3.4, I will also
describe a mutagenesis study of a transient helical segment in Sgs1,
a RecQ-like helicase in yeast that is important for genome stability
[64]. Sgs1 contains a 650-amino acid disordered region at the
N-terminus [28]. We identiﬁed 3 segments in the ﬁrst 120 amino
acids of Sgs1 with transient helical secondary structure. The helical
segments span residues 9–20, 24–35, and 88–97. In Subheading
3.4 we discussed removing prolines that ﬂank transient helical
segments as a strategy for augmenting function. For Sgs1 we inter-
fered with function by inserting proline residues at different posi-
tions in the helical segments. Figure 7a shows the SCS of Cαs and
the helical frequencies for Sgs1 residues 24–38, and Fig. 7b shows
the reduction in transient helicity of this segment when F30 was
changed to proline. Insertion of a single proline at this position was
functionally similar to deleting the sgs1 gene in a hydroxyurea
hypersensitivity assay (Table 2). We were able to conﬁrm this phe-
notype was due to disrupting the interaction between Sgs1 and
TopIII. A proline inserted in the middle of the helical segment for
residues 88–97 had no effect on growth following hydroxyurea
treatment. The transient helical segment from residues 24–35 was
further probed with proline mutations (Table 2). Mutating a
hydrophobic cluster in the middle of the helix that included V29,

F30, and I33 had the largest functional effects. Residues on the
periphery of the helix had weaker effects except for D25. We were
also able to identify a weaker helical segment from residues 9–20
that included a rare tryptophan residue. Proline mutants in this
segment also reduced TopIII binding and increased sensitivity to
hydroxyurea treatment (Table 2).

Notes
1. Dealing with Non-helical Segments. If you already have evi-
dence that a disordered region contains a protein binding site
and there is a dip in the disorder plot corresponding to a cluster
of hydrophobic residues but this region is not predicted to be
helical, then your binding site may form a beta strand or
extended structure in the bound state [10]. These regions are
challenging to identify using NMR spectroscopy because the
SCSs of disordered regions that form either beta strands or
extended structures tend to go in the opposite direction of a
helical segment. If there is evidence in the SCSs for an
extended/beta strand region, you should consider the possi-
bility of intra- or intermolecular beta-sheet formation. In our
experience, most regions that are not helical will be dominated
by coil-like structures with some small fraction of beta strand.

In this case it is difﬁcult to identify the structural boundaries of
a binding site. At this point a deletion study may be the most
practical option. Since disordered regions rarely contain long-
range intramolecular contacts, any functional affects you
observe will not be related to destabilizing these interactions.
However, the possibility of unstable intramolecular interac-
tions that lead to even a low population of beta-strand forma-
tion cannot be ignored.
2. Calculating Helix Populations Using Molar Ellipticity at
222 nm. For the CD data presented, helix populations were
calculated based on the molar ellipticity at 222 nm using the
method developed by Munoz and Serrano [25, 65]. Here, the
percent helix of a polypeptide is given by:
% helix ¼
100
1 þ
MRE  MREhelix
ð
Þ= MRE  MREcoil
ð
Þ
ð
Þ
ð
Þ
where MRE (mean residue ellipticity) is equal to (100  θ222)/
l  n  c, l is the path length in cm, n is the number of amino
acids in the polypeptide, and c is the concentration in M. The
standard value for MREhelix is corrected for chain length and
temperature so MREhelix ¼ 40,000(1  (1/n)) + (100  T),
and the standard value for MREcoil is corrected for temperature
so MREcoil ¼ 640  (45  T). For both corrections T is
temperature in degrees Celsius.
3. Resonance Overlap in NMR Spectra. A common problem in
performing NMR spectroscopy on disordered proteins is a lack
of chemical shift dispersion. This leads to resonance overlap in
the NMR spectra making assignments difﬁcult. To reduce res-
onance overlap, design IDR fragments between 80 and
100 amino acids. A fragment of this length will allow you to
incorporate functionally relevant motif(s) like protein-protein
interaction sites and be large enough to detect using
SDS-PAGE but small enough to reduce resonance overlap.
4. Calculating Helix Populations Directly from Chemical Shifts.
The relationship between protein secondary structure and
backbone chemical shifts was reported almost 30 years ago
[66, 67]. Estimating helical populations from chemical shifts
depends on a reliable database of residue-speciﬁc random coil
chemical shifts, and there is still debate about whether any of
the available random coil chemical shifts libraries capture the
complete conformational diversity of disordered or denatured
proteins. Residue-speciﬁc random coil chemical shifts have
been determined using either model peptides in denaturing
conditions or estimated using chemical shift databases [68–
74]. Even small deviations from random coil chemical shifts
(RCCS) can be used to calculate helix populations. For
instance, the average helical shift for Cα residues in ordered
16
Gary W. Daughdrill

proteins can be used to estimate helical populations using the
following relationship: ∑i, j(ΔδCαi, j)/3.1), where ΔδCα is the
α-carbon SCS for residues i through j. 3.1 ppm is the average
α-carbon SCS for all residues types found in helices of ordered
proteins [75]. Of course, not all residue types will have the
same α-carbon SCS when they assume a helical structure. A
more precise method relies on residue-speciﬁc α-carbon SCS
values [76–78]. For this method of calculation, the formula
would be ∑i(ΔδCai)/(Hδi  RCδi)) where ΔδCα is the alpha
carbon secondary chemical shift for residue i, Hδi is the helical
chemical shift for the residue type i, and RCδi is the RCCS of
residue type i.

Computational Prediction of Intrinsic Disorder in Protein
Sequences with the disCoP Meta-predictor
Christopher J. Oldﬁeld, Xiao Fan, Chen Wang, A. Keith Dunker,
and Lukasz Kurgan
Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins are either entirely disordered or contain disordered regions in their native
state. These proteins and regions function without the prerequisite of a stable structure and were found to
be abundant across all kingdoms of life. Experimental annotation of disorder lags behind the rapidly
growing number of sequenced proteins, motivating the development of computational methods that
predict disorder in protein sequences. DisCoP is a user-friendly webserver that provides accurate
sequence-based prediction of protein disorder. It relies on meta-architecture in which the outputs gener-
ated by multiple disorder predictors are combined together to improve predictive performance. The
architecture of disCoP is presented, and its accuracy relative to several other disorder predictors is brieﬂy
discussed. We describe usage of the web interface and explain how to access and read results generated by
this computational tool. We also provide an example of prediction results and interpretation. The disCoP’s
webserver is publicly available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/disCoP/.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) form broad structural
ensembles and lack stable folded structure in isolation under physi-
ological conditions [1–6]. These proteins have also been called
partially folded, natively denatured, natively unfolded, natively dis-
ordered, intrinsically unstructured, intrinsically denatured, and
intrinsically unfolded [1]. IDPs have one or more intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs) and in some cases they are fully disor-
dered. Recent computational studies estimate that eukaryotic
organisms have between 3% and 17% of fully disordered proteins
and that between 30% and 50% of proteins in their proteomes have
at least one long IDR (30 or more consecutive amino acid residues
long) [7–13]. IDPs also occupy a large part of proteomes in

bacteria, archaea, and viruses [7, 10–12, 14–20]. They are instru-
mental for numerous cellular functions including signaling [21–
24], regulation of transcription [25, 26], translation [27], chroma-
tin condensing [28–31], and molecular interactions with proteins
and nucleic acids [28, 32–39], to name just a few. Intrinsic disorder
was shown to be enriched in alternatively spliced regions [40–43]
and in posttranslational modiﬁcation sites [43–45]. Moreover,
IDPs are being explored as drug targets [46, 47], which is moti-
vated by their association with a number of human diseases
[48, 49].
Sequences of IDRs are substantially different from the
sequences of structured regions and proteins. For example, IDRs
are enriched in polar amino acids, depleted in large hydrophobic
and aromatic amino acids, and have relatively low sequence com-
plexity [50–53]. These differences underlie the development of
accurate computational methods for the prediction of disorder in
protein chains. Over 70 computational disorder predictors were
developed over the last few decades [4, 54–65]. Many of the
recently published methods rely on meta-architectures that com-
bine outputs produced by several disorder predictors to (re)predict
disorder. The meta-predictors include (in chronological order)
VSL2 [66], metaPrDOS [67], PreDisorder [68], NN-CDF [69],
MD [70], PONDR-FIT [71], MFDp [72], CSpritz [73], MetaDi-
sorder [74], ESpritz [75], MFDp2 [76, 77], DisMeta [78], disCoP
[79], DISOPRED3 [80], and MobiDB-lite [81]. This type of
predictive architecture is motivated by studies that empirically dem-
onstrate that outputs from the meta-predictors are more accurate
when compared to the results produced by their input single pre-
dictors [79, 82]. However, the improved accuracy comes at a cost
of a longer runtime and inconvenience. The long runtime stems
from the fact that multiple disorder predictions have to be com-
puted and combined together. The inconvenience is due to the fact
that outputs of several disorder predictors must be collected by the
user. The latter drawback is alleviated by some meta-predictors that
incorporate computation of the input disorder predictors into their
publicly available implementations.
A recently published example of a convenient meta-predictor is
disCoP (disorder Consensus-based Predictor) [79]. The disCoP
method is available as a user-friendly webserver that automates
the entire prediction process. Users only need to enter the sequence
of their proteins and click the “Run” button to obtain disorder
prediction. Moreover, benchmarking tests show that DisCoP pro-
vides accurate predictions, with area under the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) ¼ 0.85 and Matthews correla-
tion coefﬁcient (MCC) ¼ 0.50. DisCoP was compared empirically
to 20 other disorder predictors including several meta-predictors
such as ESpritz (AUC ¼ 0.83 and MCC ¼ 0.48), CSpritz
(AUC ¼ 0.83 and MCC ¼ 0.45), MD (AUC ¼ 0.82 and
22
Christopher J. Oldﬁeld et al.

MCC ¼ 0.45), MFDp (AUC ¼ 0.82 and MCC ¼ 0.45), and
PONDR-FIT (AUC ¼ 0.78 and MCC ¼ 0.41). These tests con-
cluded that predictive performance of disCoP is statistically signiﬁ-
cantly better (p-value < 0.01) [79]. To sum up, the two main
advantages of disCoP are the availability of the convenient webser-
ver and good predictive performance.
This chapter describes the underlying meta-architecture of dis-
CoP, explains its web interface, and provides detailed instructions
on how to generate predictions with this computational tool. We
also explain how to read and interpret the results generated by this
meta-predictor using a case study that concerns prediction of
intrinsic disorder for the chromatin accessibility complex 16kD
protein.
2
Materials
1. Sequences of proteins to be predicted. The sequences must be
formatted using the FASTA format (see Note 1). Up to ﬁve
protein sequences can be submitted at one time as either a ﬁle
upload or using a text entry ﬁeld (see Note 2).
2. disCoP: The webserver that is freely available at http://bio
mine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/disCoP/ is designed to be simple to
use. All computations are performed on the server side, and
thus the only requirements for submitting predictions are an
Internet connection and a modern web browser (Firefox,
Internet Explorer, or Chrome). The webserver visualizes the
results directly in the web browser window and also delivers
these results to the user-provided email address.
The meta-architecture of the disCoP’s webserver is shown in
Fig. 1. The input protein sequence goes through a three-stage
process to generate putative IDRs. In stage 1, the sequence is
processed by four disorder predictors: SPINE-D [83], DISOclust
[84], DISOPRED2 [85], and MD [70]. This collection of four
predictors was selected from among 20 disorder predictors using an
empirical procedure that aims to maximize predictive performance
[79]. Each of the four methods outputs numeric propensity for
disorder and binary disorder annotations (disordered versus
ordered) for each residue in the input protein chain. In stage
2, these predictions are processed to produce features that numeri-
cally quantify information which is relevant for the disorder predic-
tion. The features are calculated using sliding windows that
aggregate and summarize putative disorder information among
neighboring (in the sequence) amino acid residues. This reduces
the risk of making spurious predictions. The windows are repre-
sented by dashed boxes in Fig. 1. A balanced and complementary
set of seven features is collected by considering both types of
Intrinsic Disorder from Sequence – disCoP
23

outputs (propensities and binary) generated by each of the four
disorder predictors. Stage 3 uses these features as input to a trained
regression model to produce disCoP’s predictions in the form of
numeric propensities for disorder. These propensities range
between 0 and 1, where higher propensity scores are indicative of
a higher likelihood of intrinsic disorder. The disCoP’s webserver
further processes these propensities to generate binary predictions,
which correspond to the putative IDRs. Residues with propensities
>0.5 are predicted to be disordered, while the remaining residues
are predicted as ordered/structured (see Note 3).

Methods
Submission of predictions is made at the main disCoP’s webpage
at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/disCoP/. Notiﬁcations of
completed predictions are given by email, and thus an email address
is required for each submission. These notiﬁcations provide a link
to prediction results, which can be viewed in a browser window
and/or downloaded as a parsable text ﬁle. The predictions can be
accessed at a later time and they are kept on the webserver for at
least 3 months.
Fig. 1 Prediction process implemented in the disCoP predictor. The outputs of the four disorder predictors
(SPINE-D, DISOclust, DISOPRED2, and MD) generated in stage 1 include the propensity scores and the
corresponding putative IDRs, which are shown using the green horizontal bars. The dashed boxes with gray
shading denote the sliding windows that are used to compute the seven features in stage 2. In stage 3, the
binomial deviation regression model predicts the putative propensities for disorder from the seven features.
The putative IDRs generated by disCoP are shown at the bottom of the ﬁgure, and they correspond to the
residues for which the putative propensities for disorder 0.5. The example shows results produced for the
chromatin accessibility complex 16kD protein (UniProt id: Q9V452)

3.1
Running disCoP
Three easy steps are required to submit sequences for prediction
(Fig. 2, labels 1, 2, and 3):
1. Enter FASTA-formatted sequences (see Note 1) in one of two
ways:
(a)
Upload a ﬁle of FASTA-formatted sequences.
(b)
Input the FASTA-formatted sequences into the white text
entry ﬁeld. This can be done using the copy and paste
function. An example of properly formatted sequence can
be obtained by clicking the “Example” button located
below the text entry ﬁeld.
Clicking the “Reset sequence(s)” button clears both
submission options. There are limits to both the number
of sequences and maximum length of sequences that can
be submitted for prediction (see Note 2).
Fig. 2 The disCoP prediction submission webpage. Orange/yellow circles indicate the three steps to submit
sequences for predictions, discussed in the text
Intrinsic Disorder from Sequence – disCoP
25

2. Provide an email address (see Note 4). This email is only used to
send notiﬁcation of completed predictions.
3. Click “Run disCoP” to start the prediction.
Clicking “Run disCoP” takes the user to a status page that
reports on the current state of the submitted prediction. Sub-
missions to several different bioinformatics webservers located
at the http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu site (see Note 5) are entered
into the same queue system (see Note 6). The status page
reports the current position in the queue and shows when
prediction for this submission begins. The runtime needed to
complete prediction for an average length protein sequence
(about 250 amino acids) is approximately 10 min. The predic-
tion can take over 40 min when submitting ﬁve longer protein
sequences. After the prediction is completed, the status page
automatically redirects the user to the prediction results page.
This also triggers an email with the location of the results page
that is sent to the user-provided email address. There is no need
to keep the status page open while predictions are running
since the notiﬁcation email is always sent when the prediction
is ﬁnished.
3.2
Results
Generated by disCoP
The results page can be reached by leaving the status page open for
the duration of the prediction or by following the link provided in
the email.
The email (Fig. 3) provides a job identiﬁer together with the
location of the prediction results page and the text ﬁle with the
results. Each submission is assigned a unique 14-digit-long identi-
ﬁer (Fig. 3, label 1) that is shown at the top of the notiﬁcation email
(see Note 7). In the case of issues with the completion and/or
contents of the prediction, the identiﬁer can be used to trace the

corresponding submission. The email message includes a direct link
to the webpage with the results of the prediction (Fig. 3, label 2)
and to the text ﬁle with the results (Fig. 3, label 3).
This results page (Fig. 4) includes a link to a text ﬁle results.csv
with prediction results (Fig. 4, label 1) and a visualization of the
predictions (Fig. 4, label 2) (see Note 8). The text ﬁle contains
protein identiﬁers, sequences, binary predictions, and propensity
scores for each of the submitted protein sequences. These data are
in the comma-separable CSV format to ease parsing. An example of
the CSV format results ﬁle is shown in Fig. 5. Each sequence is
represented by three lines:
1. The protein nametaken from theFASTA header provided by the
user followed by the protein sequence. The individual amino
acids are comma-separated to ease aligning them to the
corresponding predictions listed in the two subsequent lines.
2. Binary predictions of disorder, where D denotes disordered
residues and O denoted ordered residues.
3. Propensity for disorder, ranging between 1 for high propensity
and 0 for low propensity. Residues with propensity >0.5 are
annotated as D in the second line.
The visualization (Fig. 4, label 2) shows the binary annotations
of the putative IDRs (using red highlights) and putative ordered
regions (green highlights) for each residue in the input protein
chain. Each binary annotation is associated with the propensity
score, which is provided directly underneath. The scores are in
the range between 0 and 99, where residues with scores >50 are
predicted in binary as disordered.

Case Study
The protein CHRAC16 is a component of the chromatin accessi-
bility complex (CHRAC), formed by interaction of CHRAC16 and
CHRAC14 with the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remo-
deling factor (ACF) complex. The crystal structure of the
CHRAC14/16 dimer has been determined [86], which revealed
two disordered regions located at either terminus (Fig. 6, top
panel). The N- and C-terminal IDRs play a role in the ACF binding
and modulating DNA binding afﬁnity, respectively [86].
Disorder predictions for CHRAC16 demonstrate the improve-
ment of disCoP predictions relative to its component predictions
from SPINE-D, DISOPRED, DISOclust, and MD. This is shown
in Fig. 6 by comparing the amount of incorrect predictions (hatch
portions of the score lines) between disCoP and the other four
methods. For comparison, prediction scores from disCoP server’s
CSV output ﬁle were plotted along with prediction scores of the
component predictors (Fig. 6, middle and bottom panels). The

four component predictors of disCoP generally perform well for
Drosophila CHRAC16 (Fig. 6, middle panel); SPINE-D, DIS-
OPRED, DISOclust, and MD predict 85%, 87%, 84%, and 69% of
residues correctly, respectively. Both SPINE-D and DISOPRED
predict disordered and ordered regions correctly, but predict the
two disordered regions to be shorter than found experimentally.
DISOclust and MD both predict too much disorder, with MD
predicting much of the structured region to be disordered. In
contrast, the disCoP prediction is highly accurate (Fig. 6, bottom
panel), predicting 98% of residues correctly. Similar to SPINE-D
and DISOPRED, disCoP slightly underpredicts disorder at the
N-terminus and C-terminus, but only by two residues and one
residue, respectively.

2. Up to ﬁve FASTA-formatted sequences can be submitted at
one time. Moreover, the programs used to implement the
disCoP predictor limit the length of submitted protein
sequences to the range between 26 residues and 1000 residues.
These limits apply to both the text entry ﬁeld and when upload-
ing the ﬁle. Submissions exceeding either of these limits receive
an error notiﬁcation from the server (“You entered 10 proteins.
Up to 5 proteins allowed!” or “Input sequence is 1024 amino
acids long. The minimal allowed length is 26 amino acids and
the maximal length is 1000. Please re-submit your sequence.”),
and prediction is disallowed. Requests with more than ﬁve
proteins have to be broken into multiple submissions each
with ﬁve or fewer sequences (also, see Note 6). The users
must combine the results from different submissions manually.
3. Analysis of the predictions generated by disCoP beneﬁts from
examining the propensity scores in addition to the binary pre-
dictions. High values of the propensity scores which are below
the 0.5 threshold (and which consequently do not result in the
binary prediction of IDRs) may suggest presence of disorder if
combined with other data. Benchmarks show that the thresh-
old ¼ 0.5 corresponds to the predictions with sensitivity of
about 65% and low (15%) false-positive rate, resulting in a
rather conservative set of disorder predictions. This means
that residues that were not predicted as disordered based on
the binary outputs and which have high propensity scores have
elevated likelihood for disorder, but at higher levels of false
positives.
4. Rather than requiring an active browser connection for the
duration of the entire prediction, notiﬁcations of completed
predictions are provided via the email address provided by
the user.

6. The http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu site utilizes the ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-
serve queue. However, the number of simultaneous submis-
sions across all webservers (see Note 5) that are received from
the same IP address is limited to three. Users who submit too
frequently receive a message to resubmit after one of their
pending submissions is completed. This limit aims to equalize
access to this resource across users by not allowing any one user
to submit an excessive number of jobs that would severely
delay/block access for the other users.
7. Both links to the results are based on the unique job identiﬁer
and they are not posted online. This means that the other users
of this webserver are unable to access the results, preserving
privacy of the submission.
8. Users should save the email and the links to the results. They
can be accessed only via the links that are provided in the
notiﬁcation email and on the results webpage.

Computational Prediction of Disordered Protein Motifs
Using SLiMSuite
Richard J. Edwards, Kirsti Paulsen, Carla M. Aguilar Gomez,
and A˚ sa Pe´rez-Bercoff
Abstract
Short linear motifs (SLiMs) are important mediators of interactions between intrinsically disordered
regions of proteins and their interaction partners. Here, we detail instructions for the computational
prediction of SLiMs in disordered protein regions, using the main tools of the SLiMSuite package:
(1) SLiMProb identiﬁes and calculates enrichment of predeﬁned motifs in a set of proteins; (2) SLiMFinder

Introduction
Protein sequences can be broadly divided into two major classes
with respect to their structure: globular domains with relatively
stable three-dimensional structures, and intrinsically disordered
regions (IDRs) that are conformationally ﬂexible and lack persistent
structure [1, 2]. IDRs have been implicated in a wide range of
fundamental biological processes, particularly in the context of
cell signaling and other dynamic interactions [3, 4]. Whereas glob-
ular domains largely adhere to the “structure-function” paradigm,
where the three-dimensional structure of the protein governs their

activity and interactions, IDRs predominantly derive their function
through
conformationally
ﬂexible
interactions
with
other
proteins [5].
One important class of IDR-protein interactions is those
mediated by short linear motifs (SLiMs), which are speciﬁc
sequence patterns that bind interaction partners [5, 6]. SLiMs are
thought to underpin millions of protein-protein interactions and
post-translational modiﬁcations [7]. However, their small size
(generally 2–15 amino acid residues long), sequence degeneracy
(typically 2–5 speciﬁc residues), and often low binding afﬁnity make
SLiM identiﬁcation difﬁcult, both experimentally [8] and compu-
tationally [9, 10].
Here, we present detailed instructions for predicting intrinsi-
cally disordered protein motifs using the SLiMSuite package for
SLiM discovery and analysis [10, 11]. Protocols cover the two main
tasks in SLiM prediction: (1) identifying occurrences of known
SLiMs and (2) de novo prediction of new SLiM patterns. For
more detail on these tasks and an overview of other tools available,
see [10, 12]. Identiﬁcation of IDRs is clearly important for intrinsi-
cally disordered motif prediction, and we also present some meth-
ods for incorporating IDR predictions into SLiM discovery. For
details of the disorder prediction tools used and more comprehen-
sive coverage of other available methods, see [13].

Materials
This protocol is entirely computational. In this section, we outline
the main software tools and data formats used in the protocol.
Commands for locally running programs are written for a UNIX
or Mac terminal. They have not been tested on Windows machines.
Precise details of the implementation may depend on the system
you are using.
2.1
SLiMSuite
Installation
SLiMSuite is available for download as a git repository (see Note 1)
or
stand-alone
tarball
from
https://github.com/slimsuite/
SLiMSuite.
For basic functionality, no other setup should be necessary
beyond downloading and unzipping the package in the desired
directory on your local computer. Visit the Releases page of the
GitHub repository and click to download the relevant slim-
suite.YYYY-MM-DD.tgz “Asset.” The YYYY-MM-DD part of the
ﬁlename indicates the release date. It is recommended to use the
latest release.
This ﬁle can be unpacked using standard archiving tools. On a
UNIX system:
tar -xzf slimsuite.YYYY-MM-DD.tgz

For the rest of this protocol, the main installation path will be
replaced with $SLIMSUITE (see Note 2).
2.2
SLiMSuite
Directory Structure
Once unzipped, the download will unpack a top level slimsuite/
directory with the following subdirectories:
1. data/ contains example data for testing programs (see Sub-
heading 2.7.5).
2. docs/ contains documentation, including manuals.
3. extras/ contains accessory programs that are not part of the
main program suite.
4. legacy/ contains superseded programs that are no longer
supported.
5. libraries/ contains all the python libraries used by the main
tools
(and
extras),
some
of
which
have
stand-alone
functionality.
6. settings/ contains INI ﬁles to set default options (see
Note 3).
7. tools/contains the main program suite (see Subheading 2.5).
It is recommended that analyses are performed outside these
directories for ease of reinstallation (see Notes 4–6).
2.3
Python 2.x
For basic functionality, SLiMSuite only requires Python 2.x
installed on your system. If you do not have Python, you can
download it for free from www.python.org at http://www.
python.org/download/. The modules are written in Python
2 and most have been tested with version 2.7.x. Do not try running
SLiMSuite with Python 3.
2.4
SLiMSuite
Servers
SLiMSuite tools for disordered SLiM prediction are also available as
online servers at http://www.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/servers.php.
To run SLiMSuite tools online, no installation is necessary. SLiM-
Suite servers have been tested in Chrome and Safari but should
work in any browser. Example REST server URLs are given in
the Methods (Subheading 3) (see Notes 7–14 for additional details
using the servers).
2.5
SLiMSuite Tools
The SLiMSuite tools used in this chapter are summarized in
Table 1. A brief overview of each is given below. Additional docu-
mentation is available from the main server page (see Subheading
2.4 and Note 8). General reviews of computational SLiM discovery
can be found in [10, 12].

2.5.1
SLiMProb:
Prediction of Predeﬁned
SLiMs
SLiMProb (formerly known as SLiMSearch 1.0) [14] searches a set
of protein sequences for occurrences of predeﬁned SLiM sequence
patterns. SLiM patterns may come from the literature, user deﬁni-
tions, or a SLiM database like ELM (see Subheading 2.7.4 and Note
14). SLiMProb calculates their probability of occurrence given the
amino acid composition of the sequences. When the datasets are
small enough, information about the statistical over- or underrep-
resentation can be returned, using a modiﬁcation of the SLiM-
Chance
algorithm
of
SLiMFinder
that
corrects
for
the
evolutionary relationships (see Note 20). Masking options also
permit the incorporation of biological context, including protein
disorder, into SLiM prediction.

2.5.2
SLiMFinder: De
Novo SLiM Prediction
SLiMFinder [15] is a de novo SLiM prediction program that
searches for new SLiMs in a set of proteins. “Ambiguous” positions
(where 2+ different amino acids are permitted) and variable length
wildcards (any amino acid) can be incorporated into the search.
SLiMFinder uses two algorithms.
SLiMBuild identiﬁes possible motif patterns in the input data,
based on sequence masking (see Note 23) and evolutionary rela-
tionships between proteins (see Note 20). Once convergently
evolved motifs with ﬁxed positions are identiﬁed, these are com-
bined to create motifs incorporating ambiguity (see Note 21).
SLiMChance
calculates
the
probability
of
motifs
being
enriched over expectation by chance. It corrects for the size, com-
position, and evolutionary relationships of the dataset (see Note
20). The signiﬁcance value (Sig) estimates the likelihood of any
motif being as overrepresented or more, based on enrichment
probability. Sig should be interpreted as an empirical P value and
acceptable values set according to the user’s desired balance
between statistical power (low false-negative rate) and stringency
(low false-positive rate).
2.5.3
QSLiMFinder:
Query-Focused De Novo
SLiM Prediction
QSLiMFinder [16] is a modiﬁcation of the basic SLiMFinder tool
to speciﬁcally look for SLiMs shared by a query sequence and one
or more additional sequences. To do this, SLiMBuild ﬁrst identiﬁes
all motifs that are present in the query sequence before removing it
(and any related proteins) from the dataset. The rest of the search
takes place using the remainder of the dataset but only using motifs
found in the query. The ﬁnal correction for multiple testing is made
using a motif space deﬁned by the original query sequence, rather
than the full potential motif space used by the original SLiMFinder.
This is offset against the reduction of support that results from
removing the query sequence.
Due to similarities in input and output between the two pro-
grams, SLiMFinder and QSLiMFinder will be collectively referred
to as “(Q)SLiMFinder” in this chapter.
2.5.4
CompariMotif:
Motif-Motif Comparisons
CompariMotif [17] takes two lists of SLiMs as regular expressions
(Table 2) and compares them to each other, identifying which
motifs have some degree of overlap and identifying the relation-
ships between those motifs. Its primary use in de novo SLiM
discovery is to compare predicted motifs with a list of previously
published motifs (e.g., the eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) resource
[18]) in order to identify candidates for known motifs (see Sub-
heading 3.2.1). It can also be used to identify common motifs
between different SLiM discovery runs.

2.5.5
GABLAM: Global
Alignment from BLAST
Local Alignment Matrix
GABLAM [19] is used for establishing evolutionary relationships
between the input proteins (see Note 20). GABLAM performs an
all-by-all BLAST+ [20] blastp protein search and converts the local
alignments
into
series
of
global
(i.e.,
full-length)
pairwise
comparisons.
2.5.6
GOPHER:
Generation of Orthologous
Proteins from
Homology-Based
Estimation of Relationships
GOPHER [21] is used to generate alignments of predicted ortho-
logues for conservation masking (see Note 24). Unlike most ortho-
logue prediction tools, GOPHER is explicitly query-focused and
does not enforce orthology relationships between the predicted
orthologues themselves. Furthermore, GOPHER will only keep
the most closely related predicted orthologue from each species,
to avoid species with gene expansions from dominating the dataset.
GOPHER uses estimated phylogenetic relationships based on
GABLAM global similarities to differentiate paralogues and
orthologues.

SLiMSuite
Dependencies
Very simple motif prediction does not require the use of any addi-
tional programs. However, the recommended protocols for disor-
dered motif prediction will require the use of one or more third-
party software tools. These will need to be installed on the system
and SLiMSuite given the path to the ﬁle or bin directory (see below)
needed to access the relevant programs via a simple command-line
call (see Note 4).
2.6.1
BLAST+ Homology
Search
BLAST+ [20] is used by SLiMSuite for multiple tasks, including
establishing and correcting for evolutionary relationships (see Note
20) and generating sets of predicted orthologues (see Note 24). It
is strongly recommended that BLAST+ is installed on your system
if running SLiMSuite locally. BLAST+ is in fact a suite of programs,
and the path containing these executables should be provided using
blast+path¼PATH/, if the BLAST+ bin has not been added to the
environment path (see Note 4), e.g.:
blast+path=/usr/local/ncbi/blast/bin/
2.6.2
IUPred Disorder
Predictor
IUPred2 [22] is the recommended disorder predictor to be used
with SLiMSuite (see Subheading 3.1.1). Alternative methods for
identifying disordered regions are also available (see Subheading 3.1
and Notes 25 and 26).
2.6.3
ClustalW2 Multiple
Sequence Alignment
ClustalW2 [23] is used as the default phylogenetic inference and
backup multiple sequence alignment tool. ClustalW2 is not gener-
ally used for motif discovery workﬂows.
2.6.4
ClustalOmega
Multiple Sequence
Alignment
ClustalOmega [24] is used as the default multiple sequence align-
ment tool. In motif discovery, it is primarily used in the context of
making predicted orthologue alignments with GOPHER (see
Note 24).
2.6.5
R
R [25] is used by some SLiMSuite tools for generating visualiza-
tions and/or markdown/HTML outputs. R is not currently
required by any of the tools used in this protocol, but this require-
ment might change with future updates.

2.7
Input Data
for Motif Prediction
This section covers the core input data types (see Subheading 2.7.1)
and formats (see Subheading 2.7.2) required for motif analysis with
SLiMSuite.
2.7.1
Data Types
Multi-protein Datasets
Standard input for SLiMSuite is a set of multiple protein sequences
(see Subheading 2.7.2 for accepted formats) that share a common
feature, generally a common interaction partner. (Q)SLiMFinder
de novo SLiM discovery (see Subheading 3.2.2) requires multiple
unrelated proteins for input as it explicitly invokes a model of
independent (convergent) evolution to determine overrepresenta-
tion (see Note 20). The major beneﬁt of SLiMSuite over other
methods is its ability to correct for evolutionary relationships in
the input data for these calculations [10, 15, 19, 26]. If too few
unrelated proteins are found, (Q)SLiMFinder will exit. SLiMProb
identiﬁcation of known motifs (see Subheading 3.2.1) has no such
requirement.
Single Proteins
SLiMSuite is optimized for predicting SLiMs in multi-protein
datasets. Nevertheless, SLiMProb motif predictions can be run on
single proteins. (Q)SLiMFinder de novo SLiM discovery needs
multiple proteins for input. For de novo disorder SLiM discovery
in single proteins, please see SLiMPrints [27].
Multiple Multi-protein
Datasets
SLiMSuite tools can be run in a batch mode where multiple data-
sets each consisting of multiple sequences are run one after the
other (see Note 15 for details).
Proteomes
SLiMSuite corrections for evolutionary relationships tend to break
down with very large datasets (e.g., several hundred proteins),
especially with numerous multi-domain proteins. It is therefore
recommended that very large datasets are run with efilter¼F
(see Note 20). For whole proteome searches of known SLiMs,
please see SLiMSearch [28].
Motif Data
SLiMProb prediction of known motifs requires a set of protein
motifs deﬁned as SLiMSuite regular expressions (see Subheading
2.7.4). These can be user-deﬁned motifs, published SLiMs down-
loaded from the ELM database [18], or the output of de novo
SLiM prediction from (Q)SLiMFinder.
2.7.2
SLiMSuite FASTA
Format
One of the most common input and output formats for SLiMSuite
is FASTA format, which is a very simple, human-readable sequence
format. Despite the simplicity of FASTA, there are many subformat
variants in which the sequence name is formatted with speciﬁc
information. Many of these will work and be recognized by SLiM-
Suite programs, but it also has its own favored subformat, which is
preferentially used for input/output.
44
Richard J. Edwards et al.

SLiMSuite FASTA format is:
>Gene_SPCODE__AccNum [Description]
SEQUENCE
where:
l
Gene is not used for anything and is purely for easy visual
identiﬁcation.
l
SPCODE is the species code. Where possible, UniProt species
mnemonics should be used, but any short code can be used as
long as (a) it contains uppercase letter and numbers only
(no symbols) and (b) it is consistently used within a species/
database (i.e., you can make it up as long as all sequences from
the same species use the same code).
l
AccNum is the accession number, which is used as the unique
sequence identiﬁer.
l
Description is optional and can contain any other text, sepa-
rated from the sequence name by whitespace. (NB. The square
brackets above are not required; the notation is purely to indi-
cate that this is an optional element.)
SEQUENCE can be on one or more lines and contain spaces.
However, it is best to have a single SEQUENCE line with no white-
space (some programs may enforce this).
UniProt FASTA downloads should be automatically recog-
nized and converted where needed. SLiMSuite contains tools for
reformatting a variety of input formats into SLiMSuite FASTA
format, including UniProt, GenBank, and a variety of FASTA
inputs.
2.7.3
UniProt Text Files
SLiMSuite is also able to recognize and parse UniProt text ﬁles
(sometimes referred to as “DAT ﬁles”). Details of the UniProt plain
text format can be found in the UniProt Knowledgebase user
manual: https://web.expasy.org/docs/userman.html#entrystruc.
If running on a computer with an Internet connection, SLiMSuite
can also download UniProt entries directly from a list of UniProt
accession numbers (see the UniProt help pages for more details:
https://www.uniprot.org/help/accession_numbers).
For most applications, SLiMSuite programs will extract only
the species and sequence from UniProt entries. UniProt annotation
can also be used for feature-based disorder masking (see Subhead-
ing 3.1.2).
2.7.4
Motif Formats
The term “motif” has a variety of meanings in different ﬁelds. Here,
we will be using it as a synonym for “short linear motif” (SLiM).
SLiMProb searches of known motifs (see Subheading 3.2.1) and
SLiMSuite Motif Prediction
45

CompariMotif exploration of predicted motifs (see Subheading
3.2.5) require the input of a set of SLiM motif patterns. In SLiM-
Suite, a motif consists of three basic elements:
1. Name. The motif “Name” is a single word (i.e., no whitespace)
that provides a unique human-readable identiﬁer for the motif.
If not provided, the motif pattern will also be used for
the name.
2. Pattern. SLiMSuite tools are based around regular expression
pattern descriptors (see Table 2 and [10] for more details).
3. Description. The description is free text providing additional
details. If not provided, the motif name will also be used for its
description.
For maximal information, SLiMSuite has its own motif format,
known as “SLiMSuite” or “PRESTO” format, which has one line
per motif in the form:
Name Pattern # Description
Names and patterns cannot have whitespace. For example:
CLV_C14_Caspase3-7 [DSTE][^P][^DEWHFYC]D[GSAN] # Caspase-3 and
Caspase-7 cleavage site. [39 ELM instances]
Lines beginning with # are ignored.
SLiMSuite will also recognize a plain list of regular expression
patterns (Table 2) and ELM class deﬁnitions downloaded directly
from ELM (see Note 14). Summary results tables from (Q)SLiM-
Finder can also be used as motif input (see Subheading 3.2.5).
2.7.5
Example Data

Example data for running SLiMSuite tools is provided in the
SLiMSuite data/ directory and freely available to download from
Open Science Foundation [29] (Table 3).

Methods
Most of the protocols in this section are provided in two forms:
(1) as a command-line program call and (2) as a call to the SLiM-
Suite REST server. The REST servers provide an easy entry point
for the tools and will be suitable for general small-scale analyses.
Some of these have simple web forms available for running the tool
(see Subheading 2.4 and Note 10). Users interested in large-scale
or bespoke analyses are encouraged to download and run SLiM-
Suite locally.

Richard J. Edwards et al.

3.1
Disorder
Masking
SLiMSuite is not exclusively designed for the prediction of motifs in
intrinsically disordered regions; prediction tools can be run without
any disorder masking. However, SLiMs are generally found in
disordered regions [6], and incorporating a disorder-masking strat-
egy has been shown to improve results [14–16, 30]. (Q)SLiMFin-
der and SLiMProb therefore share a number of core disorder-
masking strategies.
The main purpose of disorder masking is to exclude regions of
the input proteins that are not likely to contain SLiMs. This reduces
the search space for SLiM discovery. This in turn has two beneﬁts:
(1) programs will run faster; (2) statistical power to detect overrep-
resentation will be increased. However, it should be noted that de
novo SLiM prediction appears to be more sensitive to the loss of
signal (i.e., accidentally masking out true SLiM occurrences) than
the addition of noise (i.e., failing to mask out regions with SLiMs).
It is therefore recommended that disorder masking is used
conservatively.
This section gives an overview of the main disorder-masking
methods implemented for SLiMSuite. These fall broadly into mask-
ing from disorder predictions (see Subheading 3.1.1), masking
UniProt features (see Subheading 3.1.2), and custom user masking
of input FASTA ﬁles (Subheading 3.1.3). For additional masking
options, please see Note 23.

3.1.1
Masking from
Disorder Prediction Scores
Disorder masking is activated using the dismask¼T command,
with disorder¼X setting the prediction strategy used (see Note
3 for more information about setting command-line options).
Please note that to perform disorder masking on the command
line, you will need to have the appropriate software tools installed
and/or disorder scores pre-computed (see Note 25). For details of
disorder prediction tools, please refer to the appropriate literature
(e.g., [13]).
SLiMSuite currently has three disorder prediction methods
implemented:
1. disorder¼iupred2. This will run the IUPred2A API [22] in
either short (iumethod¼short or
disorder¼iushort2,
default), long (iumethod¼long or disorder¼iulong2), or
redox (iumethod¼redox or disorder¼iuredox2) mode.
Alternatively, iumethod¼anchor (or disorder¼anchor2)
will run ANCHOR2 instead. IUPred2/ANCHOR2 returns a
value for each residue, where a residue is determined to be
disordered if >0.5. For SLiM discovery, a more relaxed thresh-
old of 0.2 or 0.3 is normally used to limit false negatives. This is
probably particularly important for de novo SLiM prediction,
where loss of signal is problematic. This threshold can be
modiﬁed using iucut¼X and is set to iucut¼0.2 by default.
Any use of IUPred2 or ANCHOR2 for disorder masking
should cite [22]. You must have a live web connection to use
this method. IUPred2 retrieves results based on accession
numbers rather than sequences and will therefore only work
for UniProt proteins.
2. disorder¼iupred. This will run a local installation IUPred
[31] (see Subheading 2.6.2) in either long (iumethod¼long)
or short (iumethod¼short, default) mode. This has to be
installed locally (iupath¼PATH to set executable command)
and is available on request from the IUPred website (see
https://iupred2a.elte.hu/ for more details). Results are pro-
cessed as for IUPred2.
3. disorder¼anchor. ANCHOR [32] scores can be used in
place of IUPred. This also has to be installed locally
(anchor¼PATH to set executable command). It is available on
request from the IUPred website (see above) and any use of
results should cite the method. ANCHOR masking will also

directly from the website (https://fold.weizmann.ac.il/) and
more simply returns a list of disordered regions without any

this method.
Alternatively, pre-computed disorder prediction scores
from other methods can be provided (see Note 25).

3.1.2
Masking UniProt
Features
As an alternative (or in addition) to masking predicted disorder,
SLiMSuite can mask input based on UniProt features. All features
of a given type will be masked, so some editing of UniProt input
ﬁles (see Subheading 2.7.3) might be required if only a subset are to
be masked. UniProt feature masking is activated with the
ftmask¼LIST command, where LIST speciﬁes the feature types
to mask. Setting ftmask¼T is equivalent to setting ftmask¼EM,
DOMAIN,TRANSMEM (see the SLiMFinder manual for more details).
3.1.3
Custom Masking
of FASTA Files
There are two main strategies for custom disorder masking of input
by embedding masking information directly in the FASTA ﬁle
without disrupting the evolutionary relationships identiﬁed.
Regions to be masked can be added to the protein description
in the FASTA ﬁle in the form #X-Y ¼ disordered region; &X-Y ¼
ordered
region.
This
will
be
recognised
by
dismask¼T
disorder¼parse.
Mask out either lowercase (casemask¼Lower) or upper case
(casemask¼Upper) sequences.
3.2
Disordered Motif
Prediction
This section covers the basic tasks in disordered motif prediction,
with associated Notes describing some more advanced variants.
Additional options are covered in the manuals for the relevant
tools, available through the SLiMSuite GitHub site. Users are
also encouraged to contact the author if they have speciﬁc SLiM
prediction tasks that are not covered by these protocols.
Each tool generates a large number of output ﬁles. The sections
below will focus on where to ﬁnd the main results of interest. Please
refer to the manuals for more details of available outputs (see Note
5 for renaming and controlling the output ﬁles). For simplicity, the
protocols in this section will assume default disorder masking
(disorder¼iushort2 iucut¼0.2) unless otherwise indicated
(see Subheading 3.1).
3.2.1
Prediction of New
Disordered Instances
of Known SLiMs (SLiMProb)
SLiMProb (see Subheading 2.5.1) takes a set of protein motifs (see
Subheading 2.7.4) and will search for occurrences of them in a set
of proteins. SLiMProb calls take the general form:
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/slimprob.py
seqin=<FILE>
motif=<MOTIF> dismask=T
where <FILE> is FASTA (see Subheading 2.7.2) or UniProt (see
Subheading 2.7.3) format and <MOTIF> is a motif ﬁle (see Sub-
heading 2.7.4) or regular expression pattern. For example, to
search a set of proteins with a single motif:
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/slimprob.py
seqin=POL30.Scer.
apid-hq.fas motif=LIG_PCNA_PIPBox_1.motif dismask=T
SLiMSuite Motif Prediction
49

or regular expression:
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/slimprob.py
seqin=POL30.Scer.
apid-hq.fas motif=Q..[IL]..FF dismask=T
or a set of motifs (see manual for input ﬁltering):
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/slimprob.py
seqin=POL30.Scer.
apid-hq.fas motif=elm2019.motifs dismask=T
The two main result ﬁles of interest produced are the summary
results table (slimprob.csv) and the SLiM occurrence table (slim-
prob.occ.csv) (see Note 5). These are comma-separated ﬁles, which
can be opened in other programs (e.g., MS Excel or R) for further
analysis.
The summary table contains one line per motif for each dataset
(see Note 15) (Tables 4 and 5). This provides the total number of
occurrences in the dataset, along with over- and underrepresenta-
tion statistics (see Note 20). The occurrence table contains one line
per motif occurrence and includes the information on which pro-
teins have which motif and where (Table 6). See Note 27 for
additional occurrence statistics that can be calculated and see Note
28 for occurrence visualization.
If you have an active Internet connection, SLiMProb can also
be run on a set of UniProt accession numbers, either given as a
comma-separated list:

tistics are otherwise not required, users might want to switch off the
evolutionary ﬁlter using efilter¼F (see Note 20).
SLiMProb can also be run on a set of UniProt accession num-
bers through the online REST server. The REST server takes the
same commands as the local Python code, with whitespace
removed and each command preﬁxed with &:

3.2.2
Predicting Novel
SLiMs De Novo in a Set
of Proteins (SLiMFinder)
SLiMFinder is designed to look for convergently evolved motifs
that are shared between unrelated proteins. The run command is
similar to SLiMProb, but no motif ﬁle is given:
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/slimfinder.py
seqin=<FILE>
dismask=T
For example, to search for motifs in the example dataset of
yeast proteins:
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/slimfinder.py seqin=POL30.Scer.
apid-hq.fas dismask=T
or pulling down UniProt entries:
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/slimfinder.py uniprotid=POL30.
Scer.apid-hq.acc dismask=T
Via the REST server (with a subset of the POL30.Scer.
apid-hq.acc accession numbers):
http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/
slimfinder&uniprotid¼P25336,P12887,P38766,P04819,
P47110,P26793&dismask¼T
As with SLiMProb, the two main result ﬁles of interest pro-
duced are the summary results table (slimﬁnder.csv) (Tables 4 and
7; see Note 15) and the SLiM occurrence table (slimﬁnder.occ.csv)
(Table 6; see Note 27).
The summary table is of most interest, as it contains the pre-
dicted motif patterns (if any) and their estimated signiﬁcance
(Table 7). One of the things that sets SLiMFinder apart from
most other de novo protein motif discovery tools is the estimation
of the probability of observing any motifs enriched in the data
[15, 26]. SLiMChance has been shown to be slightly conservative,
SLiMSuite Motif Prediction
53

and so the default signiﬁcance threshold is set to 0.1. Even so, the
stringency of SLiMChance means that most searches will not return
motifs unless there is a strong signal. The REST server is also set to
return the top 100 patterns only. (It is rare for a dataset to return so
many unless evolutionary ﬁltering is switched off and/or the sig-
niﬁcance threshold relaxed.) These settings can be altered with
probcut¼X and topranks¼X, respectively.
It should be noted that the motif patterns returned are unlikely
to precisely match the true SLiM. Signiﬁcant motifs will be grouped
into motif “clouds” of patterns that are physically overlapping on
two or more non-wildcard positions in 2+ sequences, which indi-
cates probable variants of a more complex SLiM. These are sum-
marized in the ∗.cloud.txt output ﬁle (see Note 22).
3.2.3
Query-Focused De
Novo SLiM Prediction
(QSLiMFinder)
SLiMFinder treats all proteins equally and looks for all possible
motif patterns, as constrained by the SLiMBuild settings (see
Note 19). Sometimes, a speciﬁc protein is of particular interest.
This may be because it has higher-quality data supporting a SLiM-
mediated interaction (such as a solved structure of a protein-protein
interaction) or because SLiMs in that protein are of particular

interest (such as a molecular mimicry in a viral protein). QSLiM-
Finder [16] is a modiﬁed version of SLiMFinder that builds the
motif space on a speciﬁc query and then searches for (convergent)
enrichment in the rest of the dataset.
QSLiMFinder is run with the same commands as SLiMFinder
with the addition of a query¼X command to identify the query.
This can either be a sequence identiﬁer (name or accession number;
see Subheading 2.7.2) or a number specifying the position in the
input ﬁle. The default setting is query¼1, which means that the
ﬁrst protein in the dataset will be used as the query in the absence of
a speciﬁed query:
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/qslimfinder.py
seqin=<FILE>
dismask=T
This is the same as:
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/qslimfinder.py
seqin=<FILE>
dismask=T query=1
Generally, it is safer to explicitly specify the query by name, so
that an error will be generated if the query is not found. For
example, the
POL30.Scer.apid-hq.fas ﬁle contains high-
quality interactors of yeast POL30 from the APID database
[34]. The CDC9-POL30 interaction can be considered as a partic-
ularly high-quality binary interaction, as it is supported by PDB
structure 2OD8 [35]. This information can be used to restrict the
motif search space to be in CDC9 (P04819) using QSLiMFinder:
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/qslimfinder.py seqin=POL30.Scer.
apid-hq.fas dismask=T query=P04819
Or via the REST server (with a subset of the proteins for
clarity):

SLiMSuite Motif Prediction

3.2.4
Restricting De
Novo SLiM Prediction
to a Speciﬁc Protein Region
(QSLiMFinder)
Chain B of the PDB structure 2OD8 in the example above is a 22 aa
segment of P04819 corresponding to residues 32–53. This can be
given to QSLiMFinder to further increase the sensitivity using the
qregion¼X,Y parameter:
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/qslimfinder.py seqin=POL30.Scer.
apid-hq.fas dismask=T query=P04819 qregion=32,53
Or via the REST server (with a subset of the proteins):
http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/
qslimfinder&uniprotid¼P25336,P12887,P38766,P04819,
P47110,P26793&dismask¼T&query¼P04819&qregion¼32,53
From v2.3.0, QSLiMFinder uses position numbering starting
from 1 (previous versions start at zero).
It is possible to list several regions to include, separated with
commas:
qregion=start1,end1,start2,end2,..,startN,endN.
For example, to keep the peptide region and the ﬁrst ten
residues of the protein:
http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/
qslimfinder&uniprotid¼P25336,P12887,P38766,
P04819,P47110,P26793&dismask¼T&query¼
P04819&qregion¼1,10,32,53
To focus on the c-terminus, negative numbers can be given to
count back from the end of the sequence. For example, to keep the
last ten residues:
http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/
qslimfinder&uniprotid¼P25336,P12887,P38766,
P04819,P47110,P26793&dismask¼T&query¼
P04819&qregion¼-10,-1
Note that all masking options are additive; any residues in a
speciﬁed query region that are not predicted to be disordered will
be masked out by dismask¼T. This can result in a situation where
the entire query protein has been masked out and no motif predic-
tion can take place (see Note 23).

3.2.5
Identifying Known
Motifs from De Novo
Predictions (CompariMotif)
When you have a lot of motif predictions, it can be tiresome and
error-prone to manually scan them for things that look familiar.
CompariMotif [17] compares sets of motifs for similarity. One
common task in SLiM prediction is to compare (Q)SLiMFinder
results to known SLiMs, e.g., from the ELM database [18].
To compare SLiM prediction to known motifs:
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/comparimotif_V3.py motifs=slim-
finder.csv searchdb=elm2019.motifs
The main comparimotif.compare.tdt tab-delimited out-
put will contain details of any motif matches. Predicted motifs will
be named in the form Datset|RunID|Rank|Pattern.
It is recommended to open this ﬁle in MS Excel and sort on
Score to look at the highest scoring hits ﬁrst. CompariMotif is
designed to help users make informed manual decisions; there is
currently no deﬁnitive set of CompariMotif rules to deﬁne a
strong/weak match. Please see the CompariMotif paper [17] and
manual for more details.
SLiM predictions from the (Q)SLiMFinder servers can also be
fed into the online CompariMotif server. This is achieved by giving
the CompariMotif server the relevant REST output as input. The
CompariMotif server is called with the same general command as
the stand-alone program:
http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/
comparimotif&motifs¼X&searchdb¼X
Prediction results can be speciﬁed in the form
jobid:
NNNNNNNNNNN:main. For example, to compare SLiMFinder pre-
dictions from job 19052400010 to ELM:
http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/comparimo-
tif&motifs¼jobid:19052400010:main&searchdb¼elm2019
3.2.6
Comparing
Different De Novo
Prediction Runs
(CompariMotif)
CompariMotif can also be used to compare the results of different
(Q)SLiMFinder analyses. This can be helpful for identifying shared
motifs and common themes. To compare two (Q)SLiMFinder
runs:
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/comparimotif_V3.py motifs=slim-
finder.csv searchdb=qslimfinder.csv
For batch analysis of multiple datasets (see Note 15), it can be
useful to compare the results ﬁle to itself. In this case, Compari-
Motif does not need a searchdb¼FILE setting:
SLiMSuite Motif Prediction
57

python $SLIMSUITE/tools/comparimotif_V3.py motifs=slim-
finder.csv
SLiM predictions from the (Q)SLiMFinder servers can also be
compared with the online CompariMotif server as outlined above.
For example, to compare SLiMFinder predictions from job
19052400010 to QSLiMFinder job 19052400025:
http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/comparimo-
tif&motifs¼jobid:19052400010:main&-
searchdb¼jobid:19052400025:main
Or to compare them against themselves:

tif&motifs¼jobid:19052400010:main
3.2.7
Searching De Novo
Predictions Against Another
Set of Proteins (SLiMProb)
In the same way that (Q)SLiMFinder results can be used for Com-
pariMotif searches, they can also be given to SLiMProb to search
for the predicted SLiM patterns in a set of proteins:
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/slimprob.py
Uniprotid=P52701,
P13051,P18858,P38936,P26358 motifs=slimfinder.csv dismask=T

Notes
These notes have been organized into broad themes to help the
user ﬁnd the relevant advice.
Running and Installing SLiMSuite
1. Downloading SLiMSuite as a git repository. SLiMSuite is
available
to
download
at
https://github.com/slimsuite/
SLiMSuite. The most ﬂexible way to download SLiMSuite is
by cloning the git repository. This will enable the user to pull
down updates without having to download and extract the
entire repository. To clone SLiMSuite on the command line:
git
clone
https://github.com/slimsuite/
SLiMSuite.git
58
Richard J. Edwards et al.

The repository can also be cloned using the GitHub Desk-
top app or another git GUI. Users unfamiliar with git and
GitHub are encouraged to refer to the GitHub user guides
(https://guides.github.com/).
2. Setting the SLiMSuite path. If you are running on a UNIX
system (recommended) and want to use the example com-
mands as given, you can create a $SLIMSUITE environment
variable that points to your SLiMSuite download:
SLIMSUITE=/share/apps/slimsuite
Alternatively, you might want to set up a symbolic link to
the slimsuite directory in your run directory to simplify
commands:
ln -s $SLIMSUITE slimsuite
python slimsuite/tools/slimsuite.py -help
If the second command works, you have set up your
link OK.
3. SLiMSuite
command-line
parameters.
Command-line
options have two parts: the argument and the value. These
can be fed to programs in one of two formats:
argument=value
-argument value
These two lines have equivalent functions. The two styles
can be mixed within a program call, e.g.:
python program.py arg1=val1 -arg2 val2
Options can also be supplied within a special ∗.ini text
ﬁle. This is simply a text ﬁle containing a list of commands,
which is parsed to the program using the ini¼FILE command:
python program.py arg1=val1 ini=myini.ini -arg2 val2
Arguments are processed in the order they are received and
supersede previous settings. In the above example, any arg1
setting myini.ini would supersede val1, whereas val2
would supersede any arg2 setting in myini.ini. More details
can be found at the SLiMSuite blog (http://slimsuite.
blogspot.com/).
SLiMSuite Motif Prediction
59

A list of command-line options can be accessed using the
help (or -h or -help or --help) command, e.g.:
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/slimfinder.py help
Or via the REST server without giving any option, e.g.:
http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/
slimfinder
4. Recommended procedures for running SLiMSuite pro-
grams. Running SLiMSuite can produce a lot of output ﬁles,
especially if batch running on multiple input ﬁles. It is not
uncommon to try running searches with different parameter
settings or to make mistakes during early runs. It is therefore
recommended to keep the SLiMSuite installation, input data,
and run directories separate. In this way, runs can easily be
archived or deleted without interfering with either the installa-
tion or the data, e.g.:
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/slimfinder.py
-seqin
$SLIMSUITE/
data/POL30.Scer.apid-hq.fas -dismask T
Example commands elsewhere in this chapter have not
followed this recommendation purely to keep the commands
as short as possible.
5. Renaming and controlling output. By default, output will go
into ﬁles named after the SLiMSuite tool. For example, SLiM-
Prob will generate
slimprob.log,
slimprob.csv, and
slimprob.occ.csv, with additional dataset ﬁles saved in
SLiMProb/. These can be modiﬁed using log¼FILE, resfi-
le¼FILE (setting the name of the main ∗.csv ﬁle, also sets
root of all main outputs), and resdir¼PATH. The log and
main outputs can be set together using basefile¼BASEFILE
(see Note 16).
By default, existing ﬁles will be appended rather than over-
written. This can be switched off with append¼F, in which case
existing ﬁles will be backed up with a ∗.bak sufﬁx, unless
backups¼F. To overwrite the log ﬁle rather than appending
to it, set newlog¼T (see Note 6).
6. Error handling, troubleshooting, and SLiMSuite log out-
put. The ∗.log ﬁle records all the important information for a
run, including the command-line parameters and progress dur-
ing the run. It is therefore strongly recommended to keep log
ﬁles with all run jobs and to set meaningful ﬁlenames with log
¼FILE or
basefile¼FILE (see Note 5). Log ﬁles are
tab-delimited ﬁles with three ﬁles:
60
Richard J. Edwards et al.

(a)
Log code: #XXXXX. This enables certain types of log lines
to be extracted easily.
(b)
Run time: HH:MM:SS. The time since the run started.
(c)
Information: ASCII text. The log information.
If something goes wrong with a run, the ﬁrst place to look
is the log ﬁle. Errors themselves are recorded with the code
#ERR. The source of the error may have occurred earlier in the
run, so always check the log ﬁle for expected behavior. A run
may also generate warnings (#WARN), which will highlight
unexpected behavior or setting combinations that are not
recommended.
Using the SLiMSuite REST Server
7. Retrieving REST jobs from the server front page. All server
jobs
will
be
allocated
an
11-digit
“JobID”
in
form:
19052500004. Jobs can be retrieved at the main server page
(http://www.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/servers.php)
in
the
“Retrieve REST Server job” by entering the allocated code in
the “JobID:” box and clicking “Check/Retrieve.” This will
launch the same URL as the job itself in a new browser tab.
To simply check the status of a queued/running job, change
the dropdown option from “Retrieve” to “Check.” This will
then return the status as Queued, Running, or Finished. See
Table 8 for JobIDs to retrieve example runs used in this
chapter.
8. Running REST jobs from the server front page. At the
bottom of the main server page (http://www.slimsuite.unsw.
edu.au/servers.php) is a simple form to “Run REST Server
Job” with three boxes: Prog, Options, and Password (optional)
(see Note 9). To run jobs from this page, enter the relevant tool
in the Prog box and the command-line options in the Options
box, and then click “Submit to REST Server.” These can be
given as either space-separated arg¼val commands or a string

9. Data protection and passwords. Any data or jobs submitted
to the server can be accessed by anyone with the JobID. It is
possible to add limited protection by adding &password¼X to
the REST options (or entering something in the Password box
if running through the server front page (see Note 8)). This
password will then need to be entered to retrieve any job
information/results. Please note, however, that there is no
data encryption and the server hosts will still be able to see all
the details of the job run, including the password. It is strongly
recommended that sensitive or protected data is run locally
using the stand-alone version of SLiMSuite.
10. Running REST jobs using speciﬁc program servers. The
original SLiMFinder [36] and SLiMSearch [14] servers have
been retired and replacement servers are under development.
Simple web forms for generating REST jobs are available at
http://www.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/servers.php. At time of
publication, server forms were available for SLiMProb, SLiM-
Finder, and QSLiMFinder. These server pages provide the
capability to run the REST servers on custom sequences in
FASTA format (see Subheading 2.7.2) in addition to UniProt
sequences. These can be pasted into a text box or uploaded as
a ﬁle. Note that there is a size limit to input provided this way.
Large jobs should be run locally.
11. Running REST server jobs with SLiMParser. The SLiM-
Suite download also contains a tool, SLiMParser, for running
and/or parsing results from the REST server. The main
SLiMParser input is given to the restin¼X command and
can take one of three forms:
(a)
A full results ﬁle saved from the REST server for a job
(&rest¼full).
(b)
An 11-digit JobID.
(c)
A full REST command URL.
REST output for a job can then be downloaded by
setting restout¼T. By default, output will be named
after the JobID. Alternatively, restbase¼BASFILE can
set
the
output
ﬁle
preﬁx.
Optionally,
restout-
dir¼PATH will save ﬁles to a different location.
For example:
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/slimparser.py
restin¼"http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/
slimprob&uniprotid¼P04051,P04819,P25336,P2
5847,P26793&motif¼LIG_PCNA_PIPBox_
1&dis-
mask¼T" restout¼T restbase¼slimprob
12. Using SLiMParser for API REST calls. The SLiMSuite
servers can be accessed programmatically. Please see the server
API
page
(http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/docs&
SLiMSuite Motif Prediction
63

page¼API) for details. SLiMParser can also be used to exe-
cute this function through command-line calls, using rest¼X
and pureapi¼T to print the selected output to STDOUT in
conjunction with silent¼T to avoid additional STDOUT
output and log generation:
(a)
Submit the job and retrieve the JobID:
python
$SLIMSUITE/tools/slimparser.py
restin¼"http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/
slimprob&uniprotid¼P04051,P04819,P25336,
P25847,P26793&motif¼LIG_PCNA_PIPBox_1&dis
mask¼T" pureapi silent rest¼jobid
(b)
To wait until the job is complete, check the job status
and wait until “Finished” is returned (see Note 7):
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/slimparser.py restin=19052500004
rest=check pureapi silent
(c)
Once the run is complete, retrieve the relevant output
(s):
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/slimparser.py restin=19052500004
rest=main pureapi silent
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/slimparser.py restin=19052500004
rest=occ pureapi silent
SLiMParser will execute step a as part of step c. A sepa-
rate step b call is only required if the user wants to assess the
job status and make different decisions accordingly.
13. Protein data available at the REST servers. The SLiMSuite
servers have a number of protein datasets available for analysis,
including human and yeast interactome data. Please see the
REST server “Alias” page (http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.
au/alias) and SLiMSuite GitHub Wiki for more details.
14. Motif data available through the REST servers. The SLiM-
Suite servers have a number of protein motifs and motif
datasets available for analysis, including ELM data [18]. Please
see the REST server “Alias” page (http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.
edu.au/alias) and SLiMSuite GitHub Wiki for more details.
Batch Analysis: Running Multiple Datasets
15. Running SLiMSuite tools in batch mode. SLiMFinder is
designed to run on multiple datasets with a low false-positive
rate. To run SLiMProb or (Q)SLiMFinder on a set of protein
64
Richard J. Edwards et al.

ﬁles, use the
batch¼FILELIST command in place of
seqin¼FILE, e.g. to run on every ∗.dat and ∗.fas ﬁle in
the current directory:
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/slimfinder.py batch="∗.dat,∗.fas"
dismask=T
(This is actually the default program behavior in the
absence of any input command.) Note that wildcards are
permitted. If wildcards are used, care must be taken that
they are not expanded by the UNIX shell. FILELIST can
also be a plain text ﬁle with one list element per line.
When running in batch mode, all results will go into the
same main results ﬁles. Each dataset will also have its own
results ﬁles output into the resdir¼PATH path (see Note 5).
It is therefore important that datasets with the same name in
different directories are not passed to the program.
More details on running in batch mode can be found in
the SLiMFinder manual and GitHub Wiki.
16. Rerunning SLiMSuite with different settings. If SLiM-
Prob or QSLiMFinder are rerun on the same datasets, they
will try to reload intermediate ﬁles (including masked
sequence
data
and
SLiMBuild
motifs)
from
the
resdir¼PATH directory. This makes it very fast to rerun
programs with different ﬁltering criteria. If a batch run (see
Note 15) was incomplete, setting pickup¼T will skip any
datasets that has already run (as loaded from the main ∗.csv
ﬁle and matched by runid¼X). To rerun data without reusing
results, it is advisable to set basefile¼X, resdir¼PATH and
runid¼X to something different from the original run. Alter-
natively, force¼T can be set to force the regeneration of all
ﬁles with the same locations.
SLiMProb and (Q)SLiMFinder will also look for existing
intermediate ﬁles in the buildpath¼PATH directory, which
has the same default as resdir¼PATH (e.g., SLiMProb/,
SLiMFinder/, or QSLiMFinder/). To reuse existing inter-
mediates but keep results ﬁles separate, point this to the resdir
of the previous run. To avoid reusing these ﬁles, point this
directory elsewhere or run with force¼T.
More
details
can
be
found
in
the
SLiMSuite
documentation.
17. Farming jobs out to use multiple threads. To make use of
multiple CPUs, batch running multiple datasets can be exe-
cuted through SLiMFarmer rather than directly in SLiMProb
or (Q)SLiMFarmer. Please see the SLiMSuite documentation
and GitHub Wiki for details.
SLiMSuite Motif Prediction

18. Whole proteome preprocessing. Batch running multiple
datasets with overlapping protein content can be made faster
by preprocessing the proteome for disorder and/or conserva-
tion masking scores. Please see the SLiMSuite documentation
and GitHub Wiki for details.
Advanced Features and Protocols
19. Controlling motif search space with SLiMBuild. The
SLiMChance
statistics
implemented
in
(Q)SLiMFinder
make use of the ﬁnite motif space being searched due to the
SLiMBuild settings. Searches can be made more ﬂexible, but
less sensitive and slower, or vice versa, by modifying these
settings. The key SLiMBuild options are:
(a)
termini¼T/F. Whether to add termini characters (^ &
$) to search sequences [True],
(b)
minwild¼X. Minimum number of consecutive wildcard
positions to allow [0],
(c)
maxwild¼X. Maximum number of consecutive wildcard
positions to allow [2],
(d)
slimlen¼X. Maximum length of SLiMs to return
(no. non-wildcard positions) [5],
Default settings are termini¼T minwild¼0 maxwild¼2
slimlen¼5. This means that a motif can be up to 13 amino
acids long (5 deﬁned positions, plus 2 wildcards at each of
4 positions). Please see the SLiMFinder documentation for
other SLiMBuild motif space options.
In addition to the motif construction options, (Q)SLiM-
Finder also have a minimum number of occurrences that a
pattern must be observed. This is to reduce memory usage
(and computation) by preﬁltering rarer patterns that are
unlikely to be signiﬁcantly enriched. (This ﬁltering does not
affect the SLiMChance correction for motif space.) By
default, a pattern must occur in at least 5%, and at least 3, of
the unrelated protein clusters, whichever is greater. This is
controlled by minocc¼X and absmin¼X (see Note 21).
20. SLiMChance statistics and adjusting for evolutionary
relationships. The “Unrelated Proteins” (UP) algorithm
identiﬁes relationships with BLAST+ that are later clustered
into “Unrelated Protein Clusters” (UPC) where no protein
has a BLAST-detectable relationship with another form a
different UPC [19]. This is used to take out all the motifs
that do not occur in enough unrelated proteins (see Note 19)
and adjust the probability of the observed enrichment to take
evolutionary relationships into account [15, 26]. Without this
adjustment, results can have massive biases due to shared
evolutionary history, which often swamp any signal of
66
Richard J. Edwards et al.

convergent SLiM evolution. For very large datasets, this can
take a long time (due to the all-by-all BLAST+ search) and
result in excess grouping of multi-domain proteins. Where
the adjustment for evolutionary relationships is unwanted or
problematic, it can be switched off with efilter¼F, with the
concomitant risk of biased statistics.
21. Motif ambiguity. Ambiguity in (Q)SLiMFinder predictions
is controlled in a similar fashion to TEIRESIAS [37], using an
“equivalence list” (equiv¼LIST) of sets of amino acids that
are free to replace each other at ambiguous positions. The
default sets are
AGS,ILMVF,FYW,FYH,KRH,DE,ST. (Q)
SLiMFinder ﬁrst ﬁnds ﬁxed position patterns, with a relaxed
minimum
occurrence
of
2
UPC
(ambocc¼0.05
absminamb¼2), and then combines them using the equiva-
lence groups. A position can only be in a single group: AGS
and ST will never be combined into a [GST] position, for
example. Wildcard spacers are similarly grouped into variable
length wildcards (returned as “.{min,max}”). This can be
switched off with wildvar¼F. For increased ambiguity (but
slower runtimes and more false positives), both kinds of
ambiguity can be combined with combamb¼T.
Note: Due to the lack of independence between different
variants of an ambiguous motif, the SLiMChance statistics do
not currently correctly adjust for ambiguity. For this reason,
especially with QSLiMFinder, there can be a tendency for
ambiguous patterns to receive artiﬁcially inﬂated signiﬁcance.
It is recommended that high-throughput analyses are run
with
cloudfix¼T, which restricts output of ambiguous
motifs to those that “cloud” with a ﬁxed pattern (see Note
22).
Ambiguity
can
be
switched
off
completely
with
ambiguity¼F.
22. Motif clouding. Signiﬁcant motifs are grouped into motif
“clouds” of patterns that are physically overlapping on two or
more non-wildcard positions in 2+ sequences. These are sum-
marized in the ∗.cloud.txt output ﬁle. Motif clouds repre-
sent probable variants of a more complex SLiM. The ∗.
cloud.txt ﬁle contains a consensus pattern for each cloud
made by SLiMMaker [16] from all the occurrences of motifs
in the cloud. Degrees of overlap between different clouds are
also reported.
23. Additional masking options. Masking is important as it
reduces the sequence search space, which increases statistical
power and reduces the likelihood of returning irrelevant pat-
terns. In addition to the disorder, UniProt feature and custom
case masking (see Subheading 3.1), SLiMSuite has masking
options for:
SLiMSuite Motif Prediction
67

(a)
Low-complexity masking (compmask¼X,Y, mask where
5/8 residues are the same amino acid, by default).
(b)
N-terminal methionines (metmask¼T/F, on by default).
(c)
Position masking of speciﬁc amino acids in speciﬁc posi-
tions (posmask¼LIST, mask alanines at position 2 (2:
A), by default).
(d)
Conservation-based
masking
based
on
multiple
sequence alignments for input proteins (see Note 24
and SLiMFinder manual) (consmask¼T/F, off by
default).
(e)
Motif masking (motifmask¼MOTIFS, off by default).
Overzealous masking can reduce the signal if it incorrectly
masks true positives, which can cause problems in small data-
sets or hunts for biased motif patterns. All masking can be
switched off with masking¼F.
24. Generating orthologue alignments with GOPHER for
conservation masking. The easiest way to generate align-
ments for conservation masking (see Note 23) is to use
GOPHER (see Subheading 2.5.6), which can be switched on
with usegopher¼T and setting a ﬁle of proteins as the source
of possible orthologues with orthdb¼FILE. This ﬁle will
need to be reformatted in SLiMSuite format (see Subheading
2.7.2). For vertebrates, the Quest for Orthologs proteomes
are recommended [38]. This is the default for the con-
smask¼T option on the REST servers (&orthdb¼qfo_ref).
The server also has a set of yeast proteomes for yeast analysis
(&orthdb¼yeasts). Please contact the author to get addi-
tional proteome sets added. If running locally, it is also recom-
mended to set gopherdir¼PATH so that alignments can be
reused for different datasets.
GOPHER can also be run stand-alone on the full prote-
ome prior to SLiM prediction:
python $SLIMSUITE/tools/gopher.py seqin=FILE orthdb=FILE
gopherdir=PATH
See the GOPHER documentation for additional options.
25. Providing pre-computed disorder predictions. In addition
to the implemented disorder prediction methods (see Sub-
heading 3.1), SLiMSuite can use pre-computed prediction
values from any tool. If iuscoredir¼PATH is set, then
SLiMSuite will look for ﬁles named <ACC>.<DISORDER>.
txt where <ACC> is the accession number or md5 hash of
the
protein
and
<DISORDER>
matches
the
dis-
order¼<DISORDER> setting. To use the accession number
(see Subheading 2.7.2), set md5acc¼F. The content of the ﬁle
68
Richard J. Edwards et al.

is the sequence name, followed by a simple whitespace-
separated list of disorder scores for each residue. Disorder
will be predicted using the iucut¼X threshold, so the scoring
system should range from low being order and high being
disordered.
26. Region smoothing for disorder masking. Disorder predic-
tions are generated at the per-residue level. These can be
smoothed out to avoid extremely short regions of order or
disorder using the minregion¼X setting. In our hands, min-
region¼5 seems to work well.
27. Calculating additional statistics for predicted SLiM occur-
rences. In addition to the core motif occurrence information
(Table 6), SLiMSuite can also calculate a number of other
statistics, controlled by slimcalc¼LIST, where LIST con-
tains one or more of:
(a)
Cons ¼ Evolutionary conservation. A wide range of
conservation calculation options are available. See SLiM-
Finder manual for details. These require alignments (see
Notes 23 and 24).
(b)
SA ¼ Surface accessibility using a very crude estimate
based on Janin and Wodak [39] over a 7 aa window. Each
amino acid gets a SA value based on it and the three
amino acids either side. These values are then averaged
over the length of the SLiM.
(c)
Hyd ¼ Hydropathy, calculated using the Eisenberg scale
[40] over an 11 aa window, centered on each amino acid.
The mean is then taken across the SLiM.
(d)
Fold ¼ Mean FoldIndex disorder.
(e)
IUP ¼ Mean IUPred disorder.
(f)
Chg ¼ The absolute and net charge at pH 7.
(g)
Comp ¼ Simple complexity measure. The number of
different amino acids observed across the length of the
SLiM occurrence, divided by the maximum possible
number, which is the length of the motif or 20, which-
ever is smaller. For example, a PxxPx[KR] motif occur-
rence with a sequence PASPPR would have a complexity
of 4/6 ¼ 0.6667.
Calculations can be extended to ﬂanking regions, using
winsize¼X. If winsize <0, then only the ﬂanks are used and
not the motif itself. This does not apply to SLiM conservation
scores or local percentage identity.
Mean values for each motif are also added to the main
summary results ﬁle. Please see the SLiMFinder manual for
more details of these options.
SLiMSuite Motif Prediction

28. Visualizing predicted motif occurrences with ProViz. The
SLiMSuite servers do not currently have any motif occurrence
visualizations built into them. However, predicted motifs in
UniProt data can be visualized for conservation and proximity
to (or overlap with) known protein features using the ProViz
server [41]. A ProViz custom URL can be generated for a
motif occurrence using the data from the occurrence results
table, where <FIELD> entries in the URL correspond to ∗.
occ.csv ﬁelds (Table 6), and X & Y values should be selected
to ﬂank the motif:

Abstract
Over the past few years, it has become apparent that approximately 35% of the human proteome consists of
intrinsically disordered regions. Many of these disordered regions are rich in short linear motifs (SLiMs)
which mediate protein–protein interactions. Although these motifs are short and often partially conserved,
they are involved in many important aspects of protein function, including cleavage, targeting, degradation,
docking, phosphorylation, and other posttranslational modiﬁcations. The Eukaryotic Linear Motif
resource (ELM) was established over 15 years ago as a repository to store and catalogue the scientiﬁc
discoveries of motifs. Each motif in the database is annotated and curated manually, based on the experi-
mental evidence gathered from publications. The entries themselves are submitted to ELM by ﬁlling in two
annotation templates designed for motif class and motif instance annotation. In this protocol, we describe
the steps involved in annotating new motifs and how to submit them to ELM.

Introduction
The understanding of protein structure and function has been
changing radically in recent years. A substantial fraction of eukary-
otic proteomes is made up by intrinsically disordered proteins/
regions (IDPs/IDRs) which lack the ability to self-fold into an
ordered globular structure. IDRs cannot provide the platform for
classical protein functions such as enzyme catalysis or for building
regular structures such as helical polymers in the cytoskeleton. It is
estimated that 35% of the human proteome is intrinsically disor-
dered [1], with plenty of proteins, such as Tau, which is well known
for its role in Alzheimer’s [2, 3], being fully natively disordered.
The inescapable corollary is that, in order to understand how cells

function, we need to know what the range of functions of IDPs and
IDRs are and for which proteins particular functions apply [4].
Many cell regulatory proteins have highly modular architec-
tures with multiple folded domains interspersed with IDRs. It turns
out that most (but not all) posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTMs)
are performed on amino acid residues in IDRs. It is anticipated that
the human proteome is subjected to upward of one million PTMs
[5]. Phosphorylation and many other types of PTM are used as
ﬂags for signaling the regulatory status of proteins and the macro-
molecular complexes in which they are embedded. The sites of
modiﬁcation usually have short conserved sequence motifs recog-
nized by the modifying enzymes. These are termed linear motifs
because only the local linear sequence is important to the functional
site [6]. The presence or absence of a PTM changes the status of the
motif, for example, enabling a phosphopeptide-binding domain to
engage the site. However, not all linear motifs are necessarily mod-
iﬁed, and many have a domain-binding function in the unmodiﬁed
state, for example, protein kinase docking motifs are often required
for correct targeting of a substrate to a kinase [7, 8].
We consider that these short linear motifs—or SLiMs—are the
most abundant modules in cell regulation and signaling. The acces-
sibility, sequence compactness, and capacity to overlap to form
molecular switches mean that individual IDR-containing proteins
can embody a large array of functional modules. SLiMs enable
subtlety and robustness of cellular control at the expense of a vast
and currently unquantiﬁable amount of complexity in the system
[9]. They can also arise de novo by point mutation in IDRs,
providing great potential for change over evolutionary timescales.
They can also be mimicked by pathogens and are heavily used to
repurpose host cells to the beneﬁt of the invader but the detriment
of the host [10, 11].
ELM—the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource—was initiated in
2001 with a focus on capturing types of SLiMs and their biology
[12]. Motif information is collated by curators into motif entries
from the experimental literature [13]. This means that ELM aspires
to be a high-quality database (though it is certainly not error-free).
Of necessity, personal curation by a small team means that ELM
does not attempt to be up-to-date with all of the research literature.
Moreover, instances of very abundant motif classes are more effec-
tively collated in much bigger databases like UniProt [14] or Phos-
phoSitePlus [15] that have automated data collection functions.
Though there are now many other large and small databases
that incorporate aspects of motif data, ELM continues to be the
main hand-curated bioinformatics resource. The need to annotate
SLiMs in ELM is set to continue indeﬁnitely. We don’t know how
many different kinds of SLiMs exist in eukaryotes, but their discov-
ery continues inexorably. The purpose of this protocol is to give an
overview of how ELM entries are curated and created. In principle,
74
Marc Gouw et al.

the curation pipeline is clear and relatively straightforward. In
practice, however, almost every motif entry causes difﬁculty and
presents uncertainties that the curator may not be able to resolve.
This means that, in order to be able to annotate motifs in ELM at
all, “perfection is the enemy of the good.”
In ELM there are two main types of data: “motif instances” and
“motif classes” [13]. A “motif instance” is an existing SLiM which
occurs in an existing protein and whose function has been experi-
mentally validated. Motif instances represent the basic data which
underlie the deﬁnition of every “motif class” in ELM, which is a
higher-level description of a (variable) amino acid sequence, its
binding characteristics, and the biological functions it is associated
with. Thus, a motif class consists of several motif instances, which
have been used to deﬁne and characterize it.
In this article, we ﬁrst describe the two main steps involved in
submitting a motif to ELM: how to annotate and submit a motif
instance (Subheading 3.1) and how to annotate and submit a motif
class (Subheading 3.2). During the research phase, in which the
annotator is reading publications and collecting experimental evi-
dence, deﬁning the motif classes and collecting the motif instances
is often done together. Note though that the instance collection
must be completed before the class text and motif pattern can be
reﬁned. However, as there are two separate templates used to
annotate motif instances and motif classes, we have chosen to
describe these in separate sections. We will assume that the reader
is in the process of reading and collecting the experimental litera-
ture needed to deﬁne the motif class and has identiﬁed at least a few
supporting motif instances. In the last two sections, we outline how
to submit a new candidate motif class for future annotation (Sub-
heading 3.3) and how to update an existing motif class (Subhead-
ing 3.4).

Materials
Motif annotation is a nonlinear iterative process which cycles
between stages of collecting and reading experimental literature
and ﬁlling out the motif annotation templates. Although this pro-
tocol is presented as a guide on how to ﬁll in the annotation
templates, we expect that annotators will ﬁnd themselves annotat-
ing motif instances (Subheading 3.1) and motif classes (Subhead-
ing 3.2) at the same time as they are mining through publications.
In this protocol, we will not focus on how to ﬁnd and interpret
experimental evidence for a motif and will only describe the techni-
cal aspects involved in ﬁlling in the annotation templates.

Required to Submit
a Motif to ELM
1. A computer with a web browser (Chrome or Firefox preferred)
and a working Internet connection.
2. Before starting to ﬁll in the motif annotation templates, please
make sure to contact the internal curation team at ELM by
sending an e-mail to curation@elm.eu.org, who will provide
guidance and assistance during the annotation process.

Methods
Before annotating and submitting a motif to ELM, there are a few
critical points to be aware of. There are many ways that motif patterns
can be computationally represented (beyond the scope of this article).
ELM uses POSIX Regular Expressions that are used for text proces-
sing. Regular Expressions (RegExps) make exact matches, without
scoring or ranking. An ELM RegExp is designed according to the set
of experimental instances and alignments with their homologs. It is
critical that the annotator watches out for motif instances incorrectly
reported in the literature [16, 17]. Many of these false reports do not
match the “true motif” RegExp, and if they were used to deﬁne a
motif class in ELM, they would degrade the motif regular expression.
Key reasons why reported instances are incorrect are because (1) the
motif is buried in the protein structure, (2) no in vitro binding work
has been undertaken, and (3) the supposedly interacting proteins
never meet in the cell (different cell compartments, differentially
expressed, etc.). This means that papers should be read very critically
for what the experiments really support, andthe setofchecks outlined
below that would reveal the false attribution must be undertaken.
3.1
How to Annotate
and Submit a Motif
Instance
1. Search and collect published literature for instances of the
motif being annotated (see Notes 1–3). Figure 1 includes an
overview of the data collection stage of motif annotation.
Figure 2 shows an example of an annotated motif instance on
the ELM website.
2. Download the ELM motif instance annotation spreadsheet
from the ELM website by navigating to the templates down-
load page on ELM (elm.eu.org/downloads.html#templates)
and downloading the ﬁle “elm_template.xlsx.” Rename the
ﬁle by replacing the word “template” with the ELM motif
identiﬁer (see Subheading 3.2, step 3) (see Notes 4 and 5).
3. Switch to the “Input_table” sheet in the annotation spreadsheet,
and have a look at the example annotations in rows 6 and 7 (see
Note 6). These rows may be deleted right away, or kept as a guide
during annotation, but must be deleted before submission.
4. Start annotating a single motif instance in a new row. Each row
should contain information from a single publication. If there
are multiple publications describing the same motif instance or
76
Marc Gouw et al.

if this motif has multiple interacting partners or binding afﬁ-
nities reported, each one of these should be annotated as a
separate instance (on a separate row) (see Note 7). Every col-
umn contains a property or attribute to annotate for each motif
Fig. 1 Workﬂow for reading literature and annotating motifs. The process of annotating motif classes and motif
instances is iterative by nature. As papers are read and collected to identify motif instances, the working
deﬁnition of the motif class and its RegExp are continually updated and in turn may be used to identify
additional motif instances. Motif instance information is largely quantitative, whereas motif class information
is mostly descriptive. The ELM motif instance and motif class templates are usually ﬁlled in while the
annotator is collecting published experimental evidence and reﬁning the motif class RegExp. Once both
annotation documents are complete, the motif can be submitted to ELM

detail in the following steps in this section.
5. Complete the compulsory ﬁeld “ELM identiﬁer” in column
A. If the motif class already exists, use the identiﬁer used on the
ELM website; otherwise use the provisional ELM identiﬁer of
the motif class (see Subheading 3.2, step 3).
6. Complete the compulsory ﬁeld “PubMed ID” in column B
with the PubMed identiﬁer (PMID) of the publication being
used to annotate this motif instance (see Note 8).
7. Complete the compulsory ﬁeld “UniProt ACC” in column C
with the UniProt accession number of the protein containing
the motif instance (www.uniprot.org, [14]). Make sure the
sequence of the protein is the same as the one from UniProt
(see Notes 9–12).

22. Complete the ﬁeld “Switches.ELM ID” in column S. This ﬁeld
is optional. If the motif instance is a molecular switch that is
already present in Switches.ELM (switches.elm.eu.org, [19]),
ﬁll in the Switches.ELM ID (e.g., the Switches.ELM ID of the
LIG_PDZ_Class_2 motif in APBA1 is “SWTI000330”).
23. Complete the ﬁeld “Notes” in column T. This ﬁeld is optional.
It is intended for fellow annotators and the ELM internal
curation team and can contain information about the motif
instance, experimental procedures, or about any nonstandard
but important information that needs to be taken into account
for reviewing the motif instance annotation (see Note 27).
24. Repeat the above steps 4–23 for all other motif instances for
the same motif class (see Note 28). Remember to add a new
row when annotating the same motif instance with evidence
from different publications or for the same motif instance with
multiple binding proteins, binding domains, or binding
afﬁnities.
25. After completing the annotation form, e-mail the completed
annotation template to the ELM internal curation team at
curation@elm.eu.org. At this point the annotation is reviewed
and checked by the ELM internal curation team. If there are
any issues or points which could be improved, the annotations
may bounce back and forth between the original annotators
and the curation team before it is ﬁnalized and uploaded to the
ELM database.

descriptions of the motif, to derive the motif pattern, or to
annotate instances (see Note 45).
18. Complete the section “Optional Additional Data” (part 2),
which can include sequence alignments, PDF ﬁles of the pub-
lications that were cited, and any notes made during the anno-
tation process to specify any issues that were encountered.
These data are available to annotators, but will not be pub-
lished on the website. This section is optional.
19. After completing the annotation form, e-mail the completed
annotation document to the ELM internal curation team at
curation@elm.eu.org (see Note 46). At this point the annota-
tion is reviewed and checked by the ELM internal curation
team. If there are any issues or points which could be improved,

the annotations may bounce back and forth between the origi-
nal annotators and the curation team before it is ﬁnalized and
uploaded to the ELM database.

How to Submit
a Candidate Motif
Class
1. Identify convincing experimental evidence from one or more
publications for a candidate motif (see Note 47).
2. Prepare an email to the internal ELM curation team (curatio-
n@elm.eu.org). This email should contain six separate pieces of
information each of which is outlined in the following steps 3–
8 (see Note 48).
3. Supply an “ELM Identiﬁer,” the identiﬁer used in ELM to
name motifs (see Subheading 3.2, step 3 and Table 5).
4. Supply the “ELM model,” the regular expression which repre-
sents the amino acid pattern matching the motif’s sequence (see
Subheading 3.2, step 16 and Table 4).
5. Supply the “PMID” of at least one publication which gives
experimental evidence for this motif. If there are more

How to Update
a Motif Class
1. Search and collect publications about an existing ELM motif
class that are not included in the current motif class deﬁnition
(see Note 49).
2. Download the ELM motif class annotation spreadsheet from
the ELM website by navigating to the templates download
page on ELM (elm.eu.org/downloads.html#templates) and
downloading the ﬁle “elm_template.doc” (see also Subheading
3.2, step 2).
3. Open a browser window and navigate to the page on ELM with
the motif class that will be updated. This page will serve as a
template for completing the new motif class annotation
document.
4. Complete all of the ﬁelds (as outlined in Subheading 3.2) by
copy-pasting the information from the ELM entry in the
browser into the annotation document and updating any ﬁelds
which need to be updated (see Notes 50 and 51). If the original
information on the ELM site is no longer relevant, copy-pasting
the content is not necessary, and the new information can be
entered into the annotation template ﬁelds (see Note 52).
5. After completing the annotation document, e-mail it to the
ELM internal curation team at curation@elm.eu.org. At this
point the annotation is reviewed and checked by the ELM
internal curation team. If there are any issues or points which

Notes
1. The research and literature collection involved in annotating a
motif class and the motif instances used to deﬁne it are often
done at the same time (Fig. 1). In Subheading 3.1, step 1, we
describe how to complete the annotation template used to
submit motif instances to ELM. Most publications (and litera-
ture mining) result in a collection of multiple different motif
instances. We focus on how to annotate a single motif instance
in the Excel template in this section (Subheading 3.1),
although multiple motif instances are usually annotated and
submitted together.
2. It is possible to add new motif instances to an existing motif
class when new literature is published or discovered. In this
case, be sure to read the existing motif class deﬁnition in ELM
in detail to make sure the motif model (the RegExp) and
biological functions and context are still correct. It may be
necessary to update the existing motif class deﬁnition to
include any new discoveries (see Subheading 3.4).
3. Evaluating which experiments (and publications) provide good
and reliable evidence is not trivial, and a lot of interpretation
and manual curation of the results is required to deﬁne a motif
instance (Fig. 1). Although a complete guide to literature
curation is beyond the scope of this protocol, we suggest the
review [17] as a starting point for annotators.
4. Microsoft Excel is not required to use the motif instance anno-
tation spreadsheet. For example, the free and open-source
software applications “LibreOfﬁce” (www.libreofﬁce.org) and
“OpenOfﬁce” (www.openofﬁce.org) can also be used to open
and edit this spreadsheet.
5. The annotation spreadsheet contains four “sheets.” The
“Input_table” sheet is the main sheet, which will contain the
ﬁnal list of all motif instances (one per row) and shows two
example annotations (DOC_EXAMPLE_1 and LIG_XXX_1).
The sheet “Notes” has some general information about the
template, as well as a description of each of the data columns on
the “Input_table” sheet. “Assessment” lists the codes and
abbreviations used to ﬁll in some of the columns in the
“Input_table” sheet. The last sheet (“Example”) has a few
more examples of annotated motif instances.
How to Annotate and Submit a SLiM to ELM
89

6. The ﬁrst example is an annotated example of the (not real)
“DOC_EXAMPLE_1” motif, which shows the types of data
expected in each column. The second example (also not real)
“LIG_XXX_1” shows in more detail which columns should be
completed using additional information from the ELM website
and other sheets in the template.
7. If a motif instance has been reported in multiple publications,
each of these is annotated on a separate row. This makes it
possible to store which evidence methods, evidence classes, and
reliabilities are associated with each publication (see Subhead-
ing 3.1, steps 13, 14, and 17). Similarly, different binding
afﬁnities (see Subheading 3.1, step 21) may be reported for
different binding partners, or in different publications, and are
also annotated on separate rows.
8. The PMID is the numerical identiﬁer assigned by PubMed. For
example, the 2008 Journal of Cell Science article “The impor-
tance of stupidity in scientiﬁc research.” by Marin Schwartz
[30] is identiﬁed by PMID “18492790.” The PMID of any
article (indexed by PubMed) can be found by searching
PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed).
9. The UniProt accession number is the unique sequence identi-
ﬁer assigned in UniProt and consists of only letters and num-
bers (e.g., “Q5R9Z7” for serine/threonine-protein kinase
PLK4 in D. melanogaster).
10. Unless speciﬁed otherwise in the article, the UniProt accession
number of the primary (canonical) isoform should be used.
Noncanonical isoforms are indicated with a hyphen (“-”) in
their UniProt accessions (e.g., “P12931-2” is the second Uni-
Prot isoform of protein “P12931,” human proto-oncogene
tyrosine-protein kinase Src).
11. The UniProt accession is used to link the entry in ELM to
UniProt, the most comprehensive protein information data-
base in the world. UniProt also contains links to other useful
databases, many of which are automatically retrieved from
UniProt, including pathway information from KEGG [31]
and Reactome [32] and protein information (from SMART
[22] and Pfam [21]), and displayed on the ELM motif instance
pages and used in the ELM prediction pipeline [33].
12. In case the UniProt accession is not mentioned in the article,
different protein sequence databases can be used to ﬁnd it. One
reliable way to ﬁnd the UniProt ID is to use BLAST (blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi [34]) to ﬁnd the protein with the same
amino acid sequence in the same species.
13. The UniProt name is the protein identiﬁer assigned by Uni-
Prot,
for
example,
“PLK4_DROME”
for
the
serine/
90
Marc Gouw et al.

threonine-protein kinase PLK4 in D. melanogaster, from the
previous step.
14. Various external databases and prediction tools can be used to
determine the order/disorder context of the motif instance (see
Tables 6 and 3). Whether or not the instance occurs in a known
domain can be found at UniProt or at a protein-domain data-
base
such
as
Pfam
[21],
SMART
[22],
or
InterPro
[41]. Resources for determining disorder region include Dis-
Prot [35] and MobiDB [29]. If there is no known information
about the presence of domains or disordered regions, disorder
prediction tools such as IUPred 2a [38] should be used to
determine the order/disorder context of the motif instance.
15. If the publication doesn’t provide the PDB ID but does men-
tion resolving an X-ray or NMR structure, search PubMed for
links to the PDB, or search the PDB directly (www.ebi.ac.uk/
pdbe/about or www.rcsb.org) for the corresponding PDB ID.
16. To ﬁnd the ELM experimental method ID, navigate to the
ELM methods browse page (elm.eu.org/infos/browse_elm_
methods.html), or click on the menu item “ELM DB,” and
follow the link to “ELM experiments.” Browse the list of
experimental methods, or alternatively search for a term in
the “Search” ﬁeld to ﬁnd the ELM experimental method ID
(in the column on the left). The column “Biosource” helps
distinguish between in vivo, in vitro, and in silico techniques.
This list can also be downloaded from the ELM methods
download page (elm.eu.org/downloads.html#methods).
17. If the experimental method has not been included in ELM yet,

18. It is not appropriate to swamp ELM entries with lots of pre-
dicted motif instances. Also, emphasizing a predicted motif
that you know someone has unpublished work on does not
do them any favors and may force them to publish prematurely.
However, there can be convincing and interesting predicted
motifs that could be brought to the attention of the ELM user
community to encourage experimental follow-up.
19. This helps to build up the assessment of the data quality that
supports an instance. It reminds the annotator to be critical. It
is possible to ﬁnd the same instance with favorable logic in one
paper and contradictory in another. If at all possible, the anno-
tator will need to decide which paper is more trustworthy.
20. If there are reasons to choose an assessment other than TP, it is
desirable to add a short explanation in the “Notes” column
(Subheading 3.1, step 23).
21. It may be that a linear motif instance is very well deﬁned over
several papers, but no single paper has enough results that
would score certain. In this case, multiple publications can be
added with “likely” reliabilities.
22. If there are multiple binding partners, each one of these should
be included as a new motif annotation, i.e., a new row in the
annotation sheet.
23. If there are multiple binding domains for a single binding
partner, each one of these should be included as a new motif
annotation, i.e., a new row in the annotation sheet. If different
experiments were done for each binding protein, make sure
that this is reﬂected in the “Evidence Method ID,” “Evidence
Class ID,” “Evidence Logic ID,” “Curator’s Instance Assess-
ment,” and “Reliability ID” values annotated in steps 13–17.
24. This ﬁeld is included to take into account proteins with multi-
ple instances of the same domain. Providing the starting posi-
tion of the domain clariﬁes to which of the domains the motif
binds or which interaction is being annotated in this row (if the
motif binds to multiple identical domains in the same binding
protein).
25. If the motif binds to more than one domain of the same type/
family in the same binding protein, these should be included as
a new motif annotation (i.e., a new row in the annotation
sheet). If different experiments were done for each binding
domain, make sure that this is reﬂected in the “Evidence
Method ID,” “Evidence Class ID,” “Evidence Logic ID,”

26. If different experiments were done for each binding domain,
make sure that this is reﬂected in the “Evidence Class ID,”

in steps 13–17 and that the “Binding Protein,” “Binding
Domain,” and “Start position of Binding Domain” (steps
18–20) correspond to the “Binding Afﬁnity” ﬁlled in this row.
27. The “Notes” column can contain any information which may
be helpful for fellow annotators or the ELM curation team. For
example:
(a)
Explaining where information was obtained from. The
DOC_MAPK_JIP1_4 motif in Human T-cell activation
Rho GTPase-activating protein (elm.eu.org/instances/
DOC_MAPK_JIP1_4/Q8N103/436)
was
obtained
from the publication’s supplementary material, and the
annotator commented: “Not discussed in detail in the
cited article but detected as a positive hit according to
the experiments in the supplementary material.”
(b)
Additional information on binding which does not ﬁt in
the annotation template. The article describing how the
LIG_LRP6_Inhibitor_1 in Chicken Sclerostin domain-
containing
protein
1
(elm.eu.org/instances/LIG_
LRP6_Inhibitor_1/Q6VYA3/109) binds to its partner,
speciﬁes the binding region but not the exact position.
The note reads: “Binding region is speciﬁed as heel
region, glycosylation at N47 and N173.”
28. Typically, a single completed motif instance annotation spread-
sheet will contain motif instances of the same motif class. Motif
instances from different motif classes belonging to the same
functional site can also be annotated in the same sheet, making
sure to include the correct motif class in column A (step 5).
29. While annotating a motif class for the ELM database, a thor-
ough literature study should be conducted to collect and read
relevant literature. Also, a variety of external resources can be
consulted (Table 3), as they provide additional information
regarding the species, proteins, and interaction domains that
are involved, as well as the localization and function of motif-
containing and/or motif-binding proteins and the processes
they regulate. A more detailed description of this important
step can be found in the introduction of this manuscript (see
Subheading 1 and Fig. 3).
30. The document consists of two main parts: part 1 to annotate a
functional site and part 2 to annotate the ELM motif class.
Each part contains different sections, most of which are
How to Annotate and Submit a SLiM to ELM
93

mandatory, that allow a detailed description of a motif class.
For each section a brief explanation is added to guide annota-
tors through the process of annotating a motif class for ELM. It
is strongly advised to thoroughly read through each section
and
the
accompanying
information
before
adding
the
requested data. An overview of all of the components of an
ELM motif class deﬁnition is shown in Fig. 3.
31. Microsoft Word is not required to use the motif instance
annotation spreadsheet. For example, the free and open-source
software applications “LibreOfﬁce” (www.libreofﬁce.org) and
“OpenOfﬁce” (www.openofﬁce.org) can also be used to open
and edit this document.
32. The ELM identiﬁer will be shown on the browse page for the
motif classes and on top of the individual page of each motif
class. It has a ﬁxed structure and is constructed according to an
informative naming convention, which is also described in the
motif class annotation document. An ELM identiﬁer is a
descriptive name of a motif class and starts with a three-letter
abbreviation that indicates the type of motif, i.e., whether the
motif functions as a ligand binding site (LIG), a proteolytic
cleavage site (CLV), a posttranslational modiﬁcation site
(MOD), an enzyme docking site (DOC), a degron for docking
to ubiquitin ligases that target substrates for proteasomal deg-
radation (DEG), or targeting/trafﬁcking signals that dictate
the subcellular localization of a protein (TRG). The following
parts of the ELM identiﬁer differ depending on the motif type
and include the binding partner (for DEG and DOC) or
domain (for LIG), an enzyme or modiﬁcation type (for CLV
and MOD), cell compartments (for TRG), and if applicable a
synonym used as a canonical name for the motif in the litera-
ture. The last part of the ELM identiﬁer consists of a number,
or in some cases the name of a protein or a species, indicating
variant motif classes belonging to the same functional site (see
Fig. 3 and Table 5). For each type of motif, the structured
ELM identiﬁer looks like this:
(a)
LIG_BindingDomain_Switch_BindingPartner_Syno-
nym_Variant (e.g., LIG_EABR_CEP55_1, a class of
motifs binding to the EABR domain of the CEP55
protein).
(b)
MOD_Modiﬁcation_BindingPartner_Synonym_Variant
(e.g., MOD_PKA_1, a class of motifs targeted for phos-
phorylation by PKA).
(c)
TRG_CellCompartmentFrom-CellCompartmentTo_-
BindingPartner_Synonym_Variant
(e.g.,
TRG_ER_-
diArg_1, a class of ER retention motifs deﬁned by two
arginine residues).
94
Marc Gouw et al.

(d)
CLV_MEROPSFamily_BindingPartner_Synonym_Var-
iant (e.g., CLV_Separin_Metazoa, a motif class speciﬁc to
metazoans that function as cleavage sites for separase).
(e)
DEG_UbLigaseClass_BindingPartner_Switch_Syno-
nym_Variant (e.g., DEG_Kelch_Keap1_2, a class of
motifs binding with low afﬁnity to the Kelch domain of
the KEAP1 protein).
(f)
DOC_Modiﬁcation_BindingPartner_Synonym_Variant
(e.g., DOC_MAPK_JIP1_4, a class of MAPK docking
motifs speciﬁcally recognized by the JNK family).
33. A “functional site” speciﬁcation groups one or more motif
classes together that share a similar binding groove or domain,
but show different speciﬁcities or a distinctive phylogenetic
distribution, and hence a different regular expression (see Sub-
heading 3.2, step 16). For instance, RPA binding motifs con-
stitute a functional site containing several motif classes involved
in DNA replication and repair in different species. Functional
sites are commonly named by the interacting domain (LIG,
DOC, DEG motifs) (e.g., SH3 ligand), modiﬁcation type
(MOD motifs) (e.g., PKA phosphorylation site), cellular loca-
lizations (TRG motifs) (e.g., nuclear export signal motifs),
cleaving peptidase (CLV motifs) (e.g., caspase cleavage
motif), or a canonical name used in literature, which is pre-
ferred when available (e.g., WRPW motif). Names of func-
tional sites for MOD motifs might also include the modifying
enzyme and/or the type of modiﬁed residue; for LIG, DOC,
and DEG motifs, a binding protein (family) might be included.
The name of the functional site is shown at the top of the
individual page of a motif class, and also other motif classes
that belong to the same functional site are listed.
34. The short description of the functional site provides a summary
of the function of the motif in biological processes, its evolu-
tionary conservation, the interacting proteins, and a possible
role in disease etiology and pathogenesis. The short description
of a functional site will be shown on top of the individual page
of each motif class belonging to that functional site.
35. The abstract of the functional site should review cellular sys-
tems in which the motif classes belonging to this functional site
are involved and will be shown on the individual page of each
motif class belonging to that functional site. Appropriate refer-
ences, including citations, PDB structures, related motifs in
ELM, and protein domains, should be included, preferably as
a hyperlink. Hyperlinks are generated automatically from
shortcuts added to the abstract. These shortcuts should be
constructed according to a speciﬁc format containing a preﬁx
that refers to the external resource to which the link refers and

the database-speciﬁc identiﬁer, separated by a colon (“:”). For
instance, links to PubMed should be inserted as “(PMID:
PMID)” (without the quotation marks and where PMID is
the actual PMID, for example, “(PMID:18492790)”). Other
external links and their abbreviations are “GO” for Gene
Ontology terms, “PDB” for a structure in PDB, “ELM” for a
motif in ELM, “SMART” for a domain in SMART, “PFAM”
for a domain in Pfam, and “UNIPROT” for a protein in
UniProt. Multiple identiﬁers can be added, separated by a
semicolon,
for
example,
“(PMID:18492790;
PMID:26136366).”
36. Synonyms are currently not shown on the website. However,
they are stored internally in the ELM database to avoid dupli-
cation in case a motif class using one of its synonyms is anno-
tated in the future.
37. The long description of the motif class will be shown on the
individual page of the motif class and should provide a detailed
description of the role of the relevant amino acids or types of
amino acids (e.g., basic residues). Also, information about
speciﬁc issues, limitations, and uncertainties in deriving the
motif pattern should be included. It should also warn users if
the motif is highly promiscuous and matches have low
conﬁdence.
38. This ﬁeld is kept optional as the requested information is not
always available; however, the binding domain and the stoichi-
ometry of the interaction should always be included when they
have been determined and are described in the literature.
39. Although this ﬁeld is optional (in case there are no known GO
terms that are relevant), it is strongly advised to add GO terms
in as much detail as possible, to provide data to users
concerning the localization and cellular role of the motif.
Speciﬁcally, the terms related to the cellular component are
important, as they are applied for ﬁltering by cellular compart-
ment when users analyze protein sequences for putative motifs
with ELM.
40. It is possible to add multiple taxonomy ranges using their
NCBI taxonomy IDs, for example, Fungi (4751) and Viridi-
plantae (33090). If necessary, it is also possible to exclude a
certain taxonomy range, for example, Eukaryota (2759) except
Fungi (4751). To determine the taxonomy range for a motif
class, it is important to align homologous sequences from
different species and evaluate the motif in these alignments,
keeping in mind several pitfalls: (a) for some species the quality
of the available sequences is poor and insufﬁcient to construct
reliable alignments (Fig. 5); (b) the conservation of residues
might be due to structural constraints and not because of
96
Marc Gouw et al.

functional requirements; and (c) a sequence matching the
pattern of the motif should also be accessible in the folded
protein in order to be a functional motif (Fig. 6). Once a
motif class is entered in ELM, its taxonomic range is used as a
ﬁlter when searching for putative motif candidates in protein
sequences submitted by users.
41. ELM uses the “Taxonomy Range” to ﬁlter motif occurrences
when users analyze protein sequences for putative motifs.
42. In ELM, the pattern of a motif is described with a regular
expression, in which each position of the motif is deﬁned
using a predeﬁned character (see Table 4). For each position,
these characters indicate if only a single amino acid, a speciﬁc
subset of amino acids, or any amino acid is allowed or excluded
and thus which positions are important determinants of the
speciﬁcity of the motif. In addition, modiﬁcation of a residue or
localization at the N- or C-terminal part of the protein can be
indicated. Regular expressions also allow deﬁning text strings
with ﬂexible lengths and can accommodate alternative patterns
in a single expression using a Boolean “or” separator. To
determine the regular expression of a motif class, the available
instances should be considered, and homologous sequences
from different species should be aligned, keeping in mind the
pitfalls described previously (see Note 40). In case a motif
model is too generic and thus the probability for a match in a
random sequence is too high, it might be recommended to
split the motif class into two or more classes with different

from UniProt/ Swiss-Prot and aligned and displayed with Jalview [43]. The globular N-terminal protein kinase
domain ends at column 270 and is followed by an IDR, within which lies the degron for the E3 ligase betaTrCP,
represented by the RegExp “D(S)G.{2,3}([ST])” in ELM. The red bar over columns 306–312 highlights the
degron location. Jalview calculates a column conservation score ranging from 0 to 9, with ∗for completely
conserved columns. The motif is completely conserved in this key cell cycle regulator protein, making it easy
to identify. Motif conservation is very important but is not always so clear as for this example

patterns reﬂecting distinct speciﬁcities or taxonomic distribu-
tions. Once a motif class is entered in ELM, its model is used to
search for putative motif candidates in protein sequences sub-
mitted by users.
43. Each ELM motif model (or RegExp) has an automatically
calculated “pattern probability.” The pattern probability is an
estimate of how likely it is to ﬁnd a sequence matching a given
RegExp in a random peptide sequence (similar to an informa-
tion content score). A higher score indicates a RegExp is more
likely to occur in a random sequence. For example, the
MOD_GSK3_1 RegExp “...([ST])...[ST]” has a high pattern
probability (0.026786559556), and matches to this RegExp
are more likely to be “false positives.” In contrast, the more
stringently deﬁned TRG_LysEnd_GGAAcLL_2 RegExp “S

The RegExp from ELM motif LIG_SUMO_SIM_anti_2 (elm.eu.org/elms/LIG_SUMO_SIM_anti_2) picks up the
G/T mismatch-speciﬁc thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) protein sequence in a region which is not accessible.
The motif has been colored in dark orange, and the surface representation clearly shows that the instance is
buried and cannot form a functional site to interact with SUMO1 (PDB:2KQS). (Right) Example of an accessible

augmenting motif from RANBP2 interacts via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with SUMO1
(PDB:1Z5S). The region matching the motif’s regular expression matched region (DVLIVYE) is rendered in
red, and hydrogen bonds between the motif and SUMO1 are drawn in magenta. The bound beta-strand from
SUMO1 is colored in purple to show the hydrogen-bond interactions in the protein complex. The surface

[LW]LD[DE]EL[LM]” has a much lower pattern probability
(1.03823788548  109), and matches to this RegExp are
more likely to be “true-positive” matches.
44. Multiple sequence alignments are essential for visualizing pro-
tein families harboring prospective motif instances. Without
inspecting sets of aligned homologs, there is no prospect of
deriving a sensible RegExp for a new ELM entry. Most motif
instances are conserved in coherent sets of species, e.g., verte-
brates, all metazoans, plants, or fungi. While very recently
derived de novo motifs found only in one species are theoreti-
cally possible, they are certainly rare compared to older motifs
present across a larger evolutionary range. Alignments show
which residues are conserved and can also be used for second-
ary structure prediction when no 3D structure is available.
They are important for gauging boundaries of motifs, e.g.,
for peptide length for experimental binding studies. We use
Jalview for alignment visualization [43]. It provides powerful
tools for manipulating alignments and also interfaces with
remote servers for calculating alignments, secondary structure
prediction, etc. Jalview has extensive online help including
training videos (www.jalview.org). A key feature of Jalview is
that the sequences can be searched by RegExp. This means that
a draft RegExp can be tested for how well it is at detecting the
instances, enabling iterative RegExp development.
45. The PMID is essential, as this is used to retrieve the descriptive
metadata of the articles for publication on the ELM website
(Table 3). Most useful for annotation of motifs are papers that
report structural analysis of a motif-mediated interaction
and/or experiments which deﬁne the speciﬁcity (binding part-
ners, regions, and afﬁnities) of a motif. Depending on the type
of motif, different types of experiments are more relevant. Each
citation is assigned with an evidence code from the annotation
template (numbered 1 to 16) to indicate the type of data that is
provided for the motif, i.e., whether it was based on sequence
similarity, inferred from experimental evidence or a physical
interaction, among others. If none of the options is relevant,
select the option “1: null_evidence_code,” although this is not
encouraged.
46. Do not forget to include the motif instance annotation tem-
plate with the list of motif instance annotations used to create
the motif class (see Subheading 3.1).
47. Candidate motifs are motif classes which are still in a very early
stage and serve as candidates for motifs to be fully annotated in
the future. Candidate motifs require a small amount of infor-
mation: minimal experimental evidence that this motif exists is
usually enough to submit a candidate. This implies that when
How to Annotate and Submit a SLiM to ELM
99

we have found someone who can annotate the motif (and
identiﬁed additional evidence if needed), the actual annotation
will start. Overall, it is an efﬁcient way to store and monitor
potential new motifs. At this point it is not necessary to be
100% certain about the motif, its regular expression, or
biological function. The information used to create a candidate
motif is used as a starting point for the full annotation, and a lot
of the initially provided annotations are likely to change as the
annotator collects more literature and experimental evidence to
improve the motif deﬁnition.
48. Candidate motifs can also be submitted online, but only by
members of the internal ELM annotation team.
49. Frequently, new experiments on existing motif classes will be
published after the original motif class was annotated in ELM.
In these cases, it may be possible to update the motif class
deﬁnition with the new experimental ﬁndings. Any novel
motif instances should be submitted using the steps in Sub-
heading 3.1.
50. When copy-pasting text from the ELM site in a browser to the
annotation document, the links to ELM and to external
resources must be manually ﬁxed. Hyperlinks to ELM should
be retyped as “ELM:ELM ID,” and links to PubMed and the
PDB should be retyped as “PMID:PMID” and “PBD:PDB
ID,” respectively (see also Note 35).
51. Use “track changes” or otherwise indicate the changes made to
the text of the original annotation made to the text (using
different color or comments).
52. If possible, add missing GO terms, taxonomy, and references.
The ELM class might have not been updated recently so its
information might be somewhat outdated.

Analyzing the Sequences of Intrinsically Disordered
Regions with CIDER and localCIDER
Garrett M. Ginell and Alex S. Holehouse
Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions are ubiquitous across eukaryotic proteomes where they
play a range of functional roles. Unlike folded proteins, IDRs lack a well-deﬁned native state but exist in
heterogeneous ensembles of conformations. In the absence of a deﬁned native state, structure-guided
mutations to test speciﬁc mechanistic hypotheses are generally not possible. Despite this, the use of
mutations to alter sequence properties has become a relatively common approach for teasing out the
relationship between sequence, ensemble, and function. A key step in designing informative mutants is
the ability to identify speciﬁc sequence features that may reveal an interpretable response if perturbed. Here,
we provide guidance on using the CIDER and localCIDER tools for amino acid sequence analysis, with a
focus on building intuition with respect to the most commonly described features.

Introduction
Structural biology has played a key role in allowing us to under-
stand cellular function at the molecular level. For proteins, the
sequence-structure-function paradigm has proved to be an invalu-
able framework through which mechanistic hypotheses are devel-
oped, proposed, and tested through speciﬁc mutational changes
[1, 2]. The importance of being able to develop well-poised
hypotheses that are explicitly testable through mutagenesis cannot
be overstated and underlies much of our understanding of mecha-
nistic biology [3–5]. More recently, the development of saturation
mutagenesis approaches has provided further insight, offering a
window into the general principles underlying the complex rela-
tionship between sequence, structure, function, and evolution [6–
10].

Structure-guided mutational studies and the subsequent inter-
pretation of mutagenesis data are readily applicable to proteins with
a well-deﬁned native state. However, around 30% of eukaryotic
proteomes exists as intrinsically disordered proteins and protein
regions (IDRs) [11–13]. IDRs do not fold into a single well-
deﬁned conformation (or, more accurately, a collection of structur-
ally similar conformations), but instead are best represented as a
conformationally heterogeneous ensemble of states. Despite their
lack of structure in the conventional sense, IDRs play a wide range
of critical roles in cellular function, from transcriptional regulation
to desiccation tolerance [13–17]. The abundance of mutations
within IDRs identiﬁed across a wide range of diseases, from neuro-
degenerative conditions to many different cancers, suggests that
dysregulation through mutation can have substantial phenotypic
consequences [18]. Taken together, it has become increasingly
clear that many IDRs are crucial for cellular function, yet in the
absence of structural models, elucidating the mechanistic under-
pinnings of how IDRs drive cellular function and phenotype
remains challenging.
Given that mutations to IDRs can have an impact on protein
function, mutational studies are—in principle—an appropriate
route toward exploring sequence-to-function relationships in
IDRs. However, IDRs are in general more tolerant to mutations
than folded proteins [19–23]. A consequence of this robustness is
that a randomly generated mutant may not necessarily offer any real
insight into function. This robustness to sequence changes is
reﬂected in the observation that IDR sequences are frequently
“less well conserved” than folded domains [19, 24]. Such an obser-
vation couches conservation with respect to speciﬁc amino acid
sequence and presumes a tight coupling between sequence and
function. While this expectation holds reasonably true for intrinsi-
cally folded domains, for IDRs the sequence-to-function relation-
ship is inherently less precise, in part because IDRs are not
constrained by the need to acquire a speciﬁc native structure.
Consequently, while the speciﬁc amino acid sequence may be less
conserved, this says nothing about the extent of functional conser-
vation. Nevertheless, this raises a challenge: we wish to alter the
normal function of an IDR, yet predicting how normal function
might be disrupted through mutation is often unclear.
One approach to uncover functionally relevant mutations is to
perform a biophysical dissection of how mutations alter the confor-
mational behavior and dynamics of an IDR [17, 20, 21, 25–
29]. When possible, such an approach is conceptually attractive: it
provides a direct route to uncover sequence-to-ensemble relation-
ships, which in turn can be mechanistically interpreted to under-
stand how an IDR mediate function [23, 25, 30–32]. These types
of mutational studies can be viewed as analogous to making muta-
tions that disrupt speciﬁc structural features in folded proteins.

Garrett M. Ginell and Alex S. Holehouse

Unfortunately, many IDRs are challenging to purify and work with
in vitro, which may make biophysical characterization impractical.
Furthermore, even when biophysical analysis is tractable, it is often
time-consuming, expensive, and technically challenging. As a
result, a small number of randomly selected mutants may not
necessarily reveal key insights, leading us again to the same issue;
how do we identify the most useful mutations to make?
One approach is to leverage bioinformatics tools that can help
identify distinct sequence motifs or features that may be informa-
tive if perturbed. One set of bioinformatics tools—knowledge-
based tools—take advantage of the fact that naturally occurring
protein sequences do not exist in a vacuum, and there are trends,
patterns, and behaviors we can identify from larger datasets (e.g.,
whole proteomes) that allow us to uncover speciﬁc types of con-
served features. These features can then be identiﬁed in a new
sequence of interest to help dissect the sequence-to-function rela-
tionship. Many commonly used bioinformatic databases (e.g.,
PFAM [33]) are predicated on this approach, and knowledge-
based tools have formed the backbone of bioinformatic analysis
of folded domains due to sequence conservation. A second set of
bioinformatics tools—physics-based tools—utilize the physico-
chemical properties of amino acids to identify features and trends
based on the inherent chemistry encoded into an amino acid
sequence. For IDRs this is of particular importance as the confor-
mational biases of an IDR are determined by the chemistry of the
underlying sequence, and in particular the location, sign, and pat-
terning of charged residues plays a major role [30, 32, 34–39].
Hypotheses derived from either physics-based sequence analy-
sis or knowledge-based sequence analysis can be tested through
targeted mutations of speciﬁc features in the context of a relevant
readout (be it biophysical or functional). Given our growing under-
standing
of
sequence-to-ensemble
relationships
and
of
the
sequence determinants of biophysical behavior, moving beyond a
“chop and watch” mentality—i.e., arbitrary truncation of IDRs—is
critical to better understand the interplay between sequence and
function [30–32].
In this chapter we provide guidance on how to perform
physics-based sequence analysis using the CIDER and localCIDER
analysis tools [40]. The remainder of this chapter is organized as
follows. We ﬁrst describe how to run analysis using CIDER and
localCIDER and how to interpret the most commonly used para-
meters. We then discuss limitations of CIDER-/localCIDER-based
analysis, including providing additional types of sequence-based
analysis which may be useful.
Sequence Analysis of IDRs
105

2
Materials
Sequence analysis can be performed either using the online CIDER
webserver or by downloading the localCIDER software package.
1. To perform sequence analysis, the sequence of a protein of
interest is required. This sequence should be represented
using the single-letter representation for amino acids.
2. The CIDER webserver can be accessed at http://pappulab.
wustl.edu/CIDER/.
3. The localCIDER software package can be downloaded from
the Python Package Index (PyPI) using the pip package
manager:
pip install localcider
This will download and install the latest version of localCI-

Methods
3.1
Using the CIDER
Webserver
1. Go to http://pappulab.wustl.edu/CIDER/analysis/.
2. Paste the sequence of interest into the sequence upload text
box. A single sequence can be provided, or multiple sequences
in FASTA format can be used instead (see Note 1).
3. Press the “Upload sequence(s)” button. The CIDER webser-
ver will then analyze the sequences based on their amino acid
composition and patterning. Analysis is performed as a server-
side process, placing a minimal computational burden on the
user. From this analysis a set of parameters are calculated for
each sequence, as shown in Fig. 1. These parameters can be
used to compare different sequences with one another and
provide global descriptors of different sequence features asso-
ciated with each IDR. In addition, the sequence is positioned
on a visual classiﬁer known as the diagram of states, where
position is based on the fraction of positively and negatively
charged residues (Fig. 2; see description later) [37]. In addi-
tion, a colorized version of the sequence is generated (Fig. 3,
top) in which colors are physicochemically deﬁned (black ¼ ali-
phatic, green ¼ polar, red ¼ acidic, blue ¼ basic, purple ¼ pro-
line, yellow ¼ aromatic).

4. If a single sequence is provided, the CIDER webserver will also
generate several downloadable ﬁgures that describe the linear
density of certain parameters along the sequence (Fig. 3). Spe-
ciﬁcally, the linear signed (net charge per residue) and unsigned
(fraction of charged residues) charge density is computed, as is
the linear hydrophobicity. This analysis can be useful for

identifying local regions that are substantially enriched or
depleted in charged or hydrophobic residues.
5. If multiple sequences are provided, then all the sequences are
placed together on a single diagram of states. However, the
linear density analysis is not performed.
6. The set of parameters determined from the CIDER package
can then be used as a ﬁrst source of inspiration to uncover
sequence-dependent signatures that may be important for
IDR function. These parameters include the sequence length,
the fraction of charged residues (FCR), the net charge per
residue (NCPR), the charge patterning (as quantiﬁed by κ),
the net hydropathy, the fraction of disorder-promoting resi-
dues, and the position on the diagram of states. An extensive
discussion on the meaning, interpretation, and implications of
these parameters is described in depth in Subheading 3.3.

Using
the localCIDER
Software Package
localCIDER is a Python software package that operates in an
object-oriented fashion, providing the user with a simple interface
through which a wide variety of sequence parameters can be com-
puted. To interact with the localCIDER package, the user must
generate a SequenceParameters object that is initialized with a given
amino acid sequence of interest (see code example below). Once
initialized, sequence-analysis methods can be called using standard
Python object notation. A complete list of the various analysis
functions available can be found via the online documentation
(https://pappulab.github.io/localCIDER/) but include functions
to calculate the overall charge density (.get_FCR()), charge pattern-
ing (.get_kappa()), local charge density (.get_linear_FCR()),
and many more. The code below provides a simple example in which
the fraction of charged residues is calculated and printed for an
example sequence:
import localcider
from localcider.sequenceParameters import SequenceParameters
SeqOb
=
SequenceParameters("DAEFRHDSGYEVHASPDPAPSDPAPSDPPADS

fcr_value = SeqOb.get_FCR()

Sequence
Parameters Calculated
by CIDER
Sequence analysis with CIDER provides a simple and unambiguous
way to compute a range of sequence parameters. However, to
generate testable hypotheses using these parameters relies on our
ability to understand and interpret them correctly. The remaining
part of this chapter is focused on describing several of these para-
meters, providing some general intuition as to how they should be
treated, their limitations, and introducing additional types of anal-
ysis that may be complementary.
To help guide this intuition, we have calculated the distribution
of many of the parameters discussed across all IDRs in the human
proteome. IDRs were identiﬁed using the MobiDB-lite metapre-
dictor, with a threshold of three or more predictors identifying a
region as an IDR. We also employed a minimum length cutoff of
30 residues. This method for identifying IDRs has been used
previously [29]. The goal of providing these distributions is to
help provide a quantitative reference for what one might expect
for a “random” IDR—i.e., “Is my IDR unusual or not?” This is a
somewhat qualitative and subjective question, but nevertheless if
one can identify sequence properties that make an IDR “unusual,”
this is often a good place to start with respect to developing a
possible sequence-to-ensemble-to-function hypothesis.
Sequence Analysis of IDRs
109

3.3.1
Fraction of Charged
Residues
The fraction of charged residues (FCR) deﬁnes the fraction of
amino acids that are expected to be charged at neutral pH, assum-
ing model compound pKa values (see Note 2). FCR is deﬁned as:
FCR ¼ f þ þ f 
where f+ and f reﬂect the fraction of positively charged amino acids
(arginine and lysine) and negatively charged amino acids (aspartic
acid and glutamic acid), respectively. Figure 4 shows the distribu-
tion for the FCR of IDRs within the human proteome. We would
generally consider an FCR above 0.3 to reﬂect a relatively highly
charged IDR and above 0.4 a very highly charged IDR. Similarly, a
sequence within an FCR of less than 0.1 would be highly depleted
in charged residues. Rather than strict values, these thresholds can
be taken as a rule of thumb and can help provide an initial overall
assessment of the relative charge content of an IDR.
The sequence-average FCR can be uninformative or even mis-
leading. A sequence could have two highly charged motifs with a
charge depleted intervening region, giving rise to a fairly “average”
overall FCR despite containing local regions of both high and low
charge. With this in mind, a vectorial representation (i.e., linear
FCR) can be much more useful for identifying locally charged
regions. When a single sequence is analyzed, CIDER automatically
performs this analysis, and a linear FCR proﬁle can be downloaded
as a .png ﬁgure. However, if multiple sequences are provided, this
analysis is not performed. The CIDER webserver generates the
linear FCR proﬁle using a sliding window of ﬁve residues, although
the size of this window can be customized in the localCIDER
package. Varying the size of the sliding window may help identify
different types of features (see Note 3).
3.3.2
Net Charge per
Residue
The net charge per residue (NCPR) is similar to the FCR but takes
into account the neutralizing effect of positively and negatively
charged residues, providing a summary of the net charge. NCPR
is deﬁned as:
NCPR ¼ f þ  f 
Figure 5 shows the distribution of the NCPR for all IDRs in the
human proteome. It is worth noting that there is a relatively strong
bias against sequences with a substantial net charge, with 70% of
IDRs in the human proteome falling within a window of 0.1 to
+0.1. This provides another useful rule of thumb regarding how to
interpret the NCPR of an IDR—if the value falls outside of 0.1 to
+0.1 range, this may imply that the NCPR is a parameter of bio-
physical or functional interest.
Much like FCR, the linear NCPR may be much more informa-
tive than the sequence-average NCPR, and like FCR, CIDER will
automatically generate a linear NCPR proﬁle for single-sequence
110
Garrett M. Ginell and Alex S. Holehouse

analysis. Why are both NCPR and FCR needed? A perfectly sym-
metrical polyampholytic sequence could have a high FCR, yet the
NCPR would be zero. Alternatively, two sequences could have
identical FCR proﬁles, yet show very different NCPR proﬁles.
These two parameters provide complementary information, but in
both cases the insight and conclusions drawn will be centered on
local charge density. This is a particularly important type of
sequence feature for IDRs, given a number of studies that have
highlighted how charge content can act as a key determinant of
biophysical behavior [23, 30, 34–36, 38, 42].
3.3.3
Kappa (κ)
The parameter kappa (κ) quantiﬁes the extent of charge mixing—
how well segregated are the positively and negatively charged resi-
dues across the sequence [37]. κ is a normalized parameter between
0 and 1; for a given sequence if κ is close to zero, this means the
charged residues are as evenly distributed as possible, while if the
value is close to 1, it means they are highly segregated (see Note 4).

Much has been written regarding the deﬁnition of κ, and an exten-
sive discussion on the relevant statistical behaviors is included in the
supplementary information of the original CIDER paper, so we will
avoid repeating that discussion here [37, 40]. Instead, we will
provide some practical comments on the interpretation and usage
of κ.
κ inherently depends on the NCPR and FCR—it is most infor-
mative for polyampholytic (net neutral) sequences with a high
overall FCR and becomes less informative as one or both types of
charged residues are depleted. Because of this, comparing κ values
between sequences with substantially different composition can be
highly misleading. Furthermore, for sequences with particularly
low or high NCPR values (i.e., NCPR < 0.15 or NCPR
>0.15), extremely high (κ > 0.4) or low (κ < 0.05) κ values may
be obtained which, due to the substantial charge imbalance, may
lack any major signiﬁcance. As a general rule of thumb, for poly-
ampholytes with an FCR > 0.3, a κ above 0.25 is generally quite
high, while a κ below 0.12 is quite low.
κ provides a quantitative measure of the extent of charge mix-
ing. As a result, it provides insight into both charge-mediated chain
compaction (intramolecular contacts) and also regarding putative
regions that may drive intermolecular interactions via charge

patches. With this in mind, κ is most informative for sequences with
an FCR of above 0.25 and an NCPR between 0.1 and +0.1. This
range encompasses ~30% of IDRs in the human proteome. In
particular, special attention should be given to polyampholytic
sequences with an FCR beyond 0.4, where charge patterning is
expected to have a major impact on the conformational behavior of
polyampholytes.
An important question that is frequently raised for two
sequences of similar composition is how different should two κ
values be to say the patterning is substantially different. This is a
challenging question, in no small part because other sequence
features in addition to charge patterning can have a substantial
impact on the biophysical behavior (and so in turn also function)
of an IDR. For other systems, a difference in κ of around 0.05 has
been sufﬁcient in some—but not all—studies to engender a change
in chain compaction [21, 25, 37, 43]. Whether or not this has a
functional impact is an orthogonal question and one that can be
tested (see Note 5).
3.3.4
Fraction
Hydropathy and Fraction
Disorder-Promoting
Residues
The sequence-average hydropathy and the sequence-average frac-
tion of disorder-promoting residues can be thought of as two
complementary parameters that provide some insight into the like-
lihood that the sequence engages in hydrophobic-mediated
interactions.
The fraction of disorder-promoting residues comes from an
analysis that identiﬁed sets of residues that are overrepresented in
IDRs (so-called disorder-promoting residues) [44]. For the com-
plete set of human IDRs, ~70% of IDRs contain a fraction of
disorder-promoting residues of 0.80 (0.06) (Fig. 6). For IDRs
that are depleted for these types of residues, one may expect local
binding sites or folding-upon-binding phenomenon to occur due
to the presence of “order-promoting” residues [45–47].
The hydropathy value calculated by CIDER uses the Kyte-
Doolittle hydrophobicity scale, a widely used amino-acid-speciﬁc
hydrophobicity scale [48]. By this analysis ~70% of IDRs from the
human proteome have a sequence-average hydropathy score of
3.5  0.45 (Fig. 7) [48]. Protein–protein interactions are often
mediated by hydrophobic residues, a feature that holds true for
many binding motifs in IDRs [14, 49, 50]. With this in mind,
enrichment of hydrophobic residues in an IDR may indicate an
increased likelihood for binding, although this is a relatively crude
metric for assessing the functional role of an IDR. As one might
expect, linear hydropathy analysis can also aid in the identiﬁcation
of putative binding sites. However, we emphasize that CIDER and
localCIDER are not well poised to robustly identify binding motifs,
and many additional software tools have been developed for this
explicit purpose [50–53].

3.3.5
Diagram of States
The diagram of states was developed by Das and Pappu and helps
provide a visual classiﬁcation of the charge properties of disordered
sequences [37]. The diagram places sequence in a two-dimensional
space deﬁned by the fraction of positively charged residues ( f+, x-
axis) and the fraction of negatively charged residues ( f, y-axis)
(Fig. 2). This space is divided into ﬁve possible regions. For
sequences in R3, R4, and R5, the charge content and charge
patterning is likely to have a substantial impact on the conforma-
tional behavior of the sequence, while for sequences in R1 and R2,
other types of residues may be more inﬂuential (such as aromatic,
hydrophobic, or proline residues).
It was originally proposed that IDRs depleted in charged resi-
dues (those in R1) may be highly compact or even molten-globule-
like, a sentiment echoed in the subsequent CIDER paper
[37, 40]. While some sequences that lie in R1 may behave in this
way, over the last few years, many results from multiple labs have
demonstrated many examples of R1-sequences and are not substan-
tially compact [27, 54–58]. This reﬂects, at least in part, the com-
plex interplay between heteropolymeric sequences, distinct types of
amino acids, and non-charge-mediated forms of favorable protein–
solvent interactions. However, there are also examples of sequences
that do fall within this region (or in R2) that are more compact
[23, 38, 59–64], exemplifying the complexity of biological

sequence-to-ensemble relationships. Importantly, the regional clas-
siﬁcation of an IDR on the diagram of states should not be taken as
providing “proof” of any kind of biophysical behavior, but instead
should motivate the types of sequence features that may be of
interest for further examination.
As a ﬁnal but important point, the boundaries between the
different regions on the diagram of states should not be taken as
hard thresholds. The subdivision of the f+/f plane requires speciﬁc
lines, but these lines are not meant to provide strict boundaries for
which radically different behavior is expected immediately either
side of a dividing line.
3.3.6
The localCIDER
Software Package
We have focused here on analysis that can be performed using the
CIDER webserver. However, the same analysis (and much more)
can be performed on a proteome-wide scale using the localCIDER
package. The CIDER webserver is deliberately capped at ten
sequences per run—if a user has many more sequences than this,
localCIDER may be a much more effective option. In addition to
the analyses described above, localCIDER provides tools for a wide
variety of additional analytical approaches including other types of
patterning (e.g., Ω), the application of reduced alphabets, analysis
of sequence complexity, and various other sequence features (see

3.3.7
Example: A Case
Study on p27100–198
In the interest of providing a pedagogical experience for the reader,
we have chosen to present a case study, using the sequence analysis
of the C-terminal IDR from p27 (CDKN1B) as our example. We
chose this IDR for two reasons; it has been extensively character-
ized biophysically by Das et al. both computationally and experi-
mentally, and as a stand-alone sequence, it provides tangible
examples of several of the features discussed in this chapter [25].
A CIDER analysis of p27100–198 reveals an FCR of 0.28, which
is on the higher side (Fig. 8). In contrast, the NCPR is exactly 0.0,
demonstrating that the p27 C-terminal IDR is a perfectly symmet-
rical polyampholyte. Such a combination of near-zero NCPR and
relatively high FCR suggests that charge patterning may play a role
in determining the overall conformational behavior. Indeed, the κ
value associated with the C-terminal IDR of p27 is 0.303, a rela-
tively high value, suggesting that charge shufﬂe mutants might have
a substantial impact on the conformational preferences of the
p27-IDR. In keeping with this hypothesis, mutants were designed
and tested computationally and experimentally, revealing a well-
deﬁned dependence on the global dimensions with respect to κ
[25]. Interestingly, despite the fact that charge patterning provides
rheostatic control over the global dimensions, the functional read-
out (phosphorylation efﬁciency) shows a more complex and
non-monotonic relationship with charge patterning. Such a result
highlights the inherent challenges in relating sequence to function
in IDRs, in which despite uncovering a predictive biophysical
model for conformational behavior, this description is insufﬁcient
to fully explain the biologically relevant functional readout. In the
case of p27, an auxiliary interaction motif was then identiﬁed by
considering the linear charge density, providing mechanistic insight
into the observed functional behavior.
3.3.8
Limitations
of CIDER Sequence
Analysis
As with any tool or analysis protocol, there exist a number of
important limitations associated with CIDER/localCIDER analy-
sis. Recognizing those limitations is critical for interpreting the
underlying analysis and for drawing general conclusions.
An important limitation, discussed in Note 2, is the assump-
tion of model compound pKas, an assumption which recent work
has called into question [65].
Another general limitation is the assumption of additivity with
respect to physicochemical properties. This assumption is not with-
out reason—seminal work from Tanford, Record, Bolen, and
others has robustly established the general validity of an additive
model for protein-solvent interaction in heteropolymers [32, 66–
116
Garrett M. Ginell and Alex S. Holehouse

72]. Nevertheless, emergent chain-chain interactions in IDRs may
inﬂuence local hydrophobicity, charge, and hydrogen-bonding
potential in a nonadditive manner. With this in mind, the types of
analysis provided by CIDER and localCIDER are inherently lim-
ited to a linear (one-dimensional) representation. We anticipate
that new methods that move toward higher-order analysis will
provide new types of complementary insight.
Finally, an important albeit relatively speciﬁc limitation arises
with respect to charge (κ), charge and proline (Ω), or arbitrary types
of patterning computed through κ-like parameters [27, 37, 40,
63]. These parameters lose coherence and meaning as sequence
compositions becomes highly asymmetric with respect to the resi-
dues found in one of the patterning groups (see Note 7). From a
biological standpoint, this is of limited practical concern. In gen-
eral, for a sequence in which a patterning parameter yields a value
greater than 1 is also well beyond the limit in which that parameter
would have any real meaning due to the sequence composition.
However, in the context of sequence design, this can introduce
sharp discontinuities and non-monotonic behavior in terms of
patterning parameters with respect to composition. For a more
extended discussion on this, we recommend the supplementary
information associated with the original CIDER paper [40].
3.3.9
Additional
Approaches/Principles
for the Analysis
of Disordered Protein
Sequences
The sequence analysis performed through CIDER and localCI-
DER provides a means to elucidate speciﬁc compositional attri-
butes within an amino acid sequence. This analysis considers the
standard 20-amino-acid alphabet but is inherently limited to con-
sider features that can be uncovered using this “encoding” scheme.
Furthermore, CIDER and localCIDER take a physics-based
approach to sequence analysis, an approach distinct to many well-
known types of bioinformatics tools which are implicitly or explic-
itly knowledge-based. Physics-based and knowledge-based tools
offer complementary approaches for understanding the sequence
determinants of biophysical behavior and function in IDRs. With

117

this in mind, we will brieﬂy outline additional knowledge-based
approaches that provide information of direct relevance to the types
of analysis that CIDER and localCIDER can offer.
A crucial set of tools for physics-based approaches are those
that allow the accurate and efﬁcient prediction of IDRs from
sequence data alone (i.e., disorder predictors). Disorder predictors
are typically trained using experimental data to allow them to
predict regions of local disorder. A large number of distinct pre-
dictors have been developed over the years, with metapredictors
taking a central role for proteome-wide prediction more recently
[73–78]. Unlike stand-alone disorder predictors, metapredictors
compute disorder proﬁles using several different stand-alone pre-
dictors and provide a consensus analysis. While powerful, metapre-
dictors often do not allow a user to supply their own arbitrary
sequence as they typically pre-calculate consensus parameters on a
whole-proteome scale. As well as providing information on predic-
tions, the most recent incarnation of the metapredictor MobiDB
(MobiDB 3.0) provides a wealth of additional information from a
number of curated databases, offering users a wide range of useful
information for naturally occurring sequences [78]. If de novo
disorder predictions are needed, we have found that MobiDB-lite
provides a convenient command-line tool that can be integrated
into larger bioinformatics pipelines [79]. Similarly, IUPred remains
a convenient, fast, and powerful stand-alone predictor [53, 77]. In
addition to predictors, various databases exist that categorize exper-
imentally
veriﬁed
IDRs,
the
most
extensive
of
which
is
DisProt [80].
Posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTMs) provide a means to
dynamically regulate the chemical identity of an amino acid
sequence, substantially expanding the standard 20-residue alpha-
bet. Given the emphasis placed in this chapter on the role of
charged residues, the importance of PTMs should be clear. Phos-
phorylation can add negative charge, acetylation can remove posi-
tive charge, and methylation can modify the chemical nature of a
charged sidechains [28, 81–83]. The integration of sequence anal-
ysis with extant PTM data represents an important aspect not
explicitly covered by CIDER and localCIDER, although the devel-
opment of bioinformatics pipelines that facilitate this type of analy-
sis is straightforward. The interplay among different PTMs and
their collective impact on function (and structure propensity) is
also critical and represents an aspect of IDR regulation that likely
plays an important role in many contexts [84].
Short linear motifs (SLiMs), also known as eukaryotic linear
motifs (ELMs), have been the subject of extensive discussion and
analysis, and their importance in dictating biological function is
undeniable [50, 85, 86]. An open challenge in the ﬁeld is the
accurate de novo prediction of SLiMs, an issue well motivated by
118
Garrett M. Ginell and Alex S. Holehouse

the fact that two identical pseudo-SLiMs found in different pro-
teins will not necessarily share equivalent binding properties, hint-
ing at a broader context-based regulation [87, 88]. Various tools
and databases for identifying SLiMs have been developed over the
years, and these may offer complementary insight to CIDER-based
analysis when available [51, 89].
Finally, new approaches to describe and classify IDRs are
needed to develop our understanding of how speciﬁc types of
disordered domains may mediate function. Approaches that com-
bine physics-based and knowledge-based informatics offer an
opportunity to overcome the limitations associated with each class
of methods individually, although much work remains to be
done here.
An ultimate goal is to construct generalized discovery pipelines,
in which sequence analysis reveals an initial hypothesis, this hypoth-
esis can be tested through a combination of computational and
in vitro experiments, and the functional relevance of the underlying
behavior is ﬁnally tested in cells. While such a pipeline represents
the ideal scenario, recent developments over the last ﬁve years have
made substantial progress in allowing speciﬁc, information-rich
mutations to be identiﬁed [14, 21, 23, 25, 29, 30, 90]. We antici-
pate that as new approaches for sequence analysis emerge while
high-throughput experiments become more tractable, the rate at
which novel discoveries in the context IDR-mediated function will
further increase.

Notes
1. The CIDER webserver will remove nonstandard characters
from the sequence (i.e., spaces, numbers) so sequences can be
copied-and-pasted directly from UniProt. The CIDER webser-
ver is not a disorder predictor, and the underlying assumption is
that the sequences provided have already been predicted/
demonstrated to be disordered. The webserver allows for up
to ten sequences to be analyzed simultaneously.
2. Among the most important limitations is the assumption of
model compound pKa values in calculating charge-related
information. In the context of IDRs and unfolded proteins,
ﬂuctuations in the local chemical environment can have a sig-
niﬁcant impact on the pKa values of charged residues [91–
93]. New methods that can dynamically estimate the pKa values
of titratable groups for biophysical ensembles will play a key
role in further developing tools for sequence analysis. A related
limitation is that for charge-based analysis, CIDER assumes
histidine to be a neutral residue. The model compound pKa
of the histidine sidechain is 6.8, meaning that if we assume the

intracellular pH to be around 7.1, the majority of histidine
should, in theory, be deprotonated and neutral. However,
this both assumes a uniform pH and unmodiﬁed pKa values,
both of which are unlikely to be universally valid assumptions.
We also do not consider the N- and C-termini of polypeptides
as contributing to the charge status of an IDR, in part because
IDRs are often analyzed as locally excised regions taken from a
larger protein, in which case the “termini” are an artiﬁcial
modiﬁcation formed due to excision. In addition, the termini
are by deﬁnition not within the main chain, and as such their
impact on the overall conformational behavior is less signiﬁcant
than if they were embedded far from the ends.
3. The default sliding window used for linear sequence analysis is
ﬁve residues. This value was chosen as it is approximately the
blob size for polypeptides [37]. However, within localCIDER,
changing the window size is simple and can reveal sequence
features that emerge over longer-length scales. For example,
increasing the window size to 10 can uncover regions with a
global net charge that would be “invisible” with a window size
of 5. However, at least in our experience, at a window size
beyond 20 and 30 residues, local sequence features are largely
“smeared” out due to local averaging.
4. A detailed mathematical description of how to calculate κ is
provided in both the original paper in which the parameter is
deﬁned and in the CIDER paper (notably see the supplemen-
tary information) [37, 40]. With this in mind, we will avoid
repetition, but instead provide a more general and intuitive
description of how κ is calculated. κ provides a measure of
how similar the overall NCPR is compared to the local NCPR
along the primary sequence. Speciﬁcally, in calculating κ the
overall charge asymmetry (σ) for the entire sequence is calcu-
lated ﬁrst, then the charge asymmetry for each ﬁve to
six-residue blob (σi) is calculated, and the average deviation
between the overall charge asymmetry and the local charge
asymmetry is determined (δ). This provides an un-normalized
measure of the extent to which the local charge density deviates
from the global charge density. To normalize, a new sequence
with the same composition but the most well-mixed possible
sequence patterning is generated, and the δ for this sequence is
calculated (δmax). This value acts as a composition-speciﬁc nor-
malization factor such that κ ¼ δ/δmax.
5. In the Notch transcriptional circuit, using sequence design to
titrate κ for the Notch IDR from 0.15 to 0.74 (wild-type
κ ¼ 0.31) yields close to the maximum possible change in the
global chain dimensions as well as major shifts in transcriptional
activation [21]. However, the transcriptional change does not
perfectly correlate with global dimensions, implying
an
120

interplay between several different factors. In work by Nott
et al., charge patterning for a polyampholytic IDR was shown
to inﬂuence liquid–liquid phase separation, a result that was
further generalized in elegant work by Lin and Chan [94, 95].
6. A reduced alphabet refers to taking the standard 20 amino acids
and grouping certain residues together based on some selec-
tion criteria. How these groups are decided depends on the
question of interest but typically will reﬂect some feature that
unites different residue types. For example, a common type of
reduced alphabet is to combine polar (Gln, Asn, Gly, Ther, Ser,
His, Cys), hydrophobic (Ile, Leu, Val, Met, Ala, Tyr, Trp, Phe),
charged (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg), and then proline as its own
group. Sequence complexity reﬂects the number of different
amino acid types contained within a sequence (or local
sequence region). The most common methods approach this
question from an information-theory perspective, asking how
many bits of information are needed to encode a sequence of
characters (amino acids) [96].
7. In principle κ and patterning parameters that are derivatives of κ
should always exist in the limits of 0–1. However, for sequences
with a composition that is highly depleted in one or more of the
residue groups, a value greater than 1 can be obtained. For
example, when calculated κ a sequence of 24 Glu, 24 Asp, and
2 Arg and 2 Lys (and no other residues) is highly depleted for
positively charged residues and, depending on the patterning,
could yield a κ value greater than 1. The main takeaway from
such a result would be that (a) the sequences are highly
segregated but (b) global charge patterning is likely not a key
determinant of function or conformational behavior, although
local charge density may be important and can be accessed via
the linear NCRP and FCR analysis.

Abstract
Nowadays, it is well established that many proteins or regions under physiological conditions lack a ﬁxed
three-dimensional structure and are intrinsically disordered. MobiDB is the main repository of protein
disorder and mobility annotations, combining different data sources to provide an exhaustive overview of
intrinsic disorder. MobiDB includes curated annotations from other databases, indirect disorder evidence
from structural data, and disorder predictions from protein sequences. It provides an easy-to-use web server
to visualize and explore disorder information. This chapter describes the data available in MobiDB,
emphasizing how to use and access the intrinsic disorder data. MobiDB is available at URL http://
mobidb.bio.unipd.it.

Introduction
The characterization of proteins and/or regions lacking a static
tertiary structure under physiological conditions (intrinsically dis-
ordered proteins [IDPs] or intrinsically disordered regions [IDRs])
deﬁes the classical structure-function paradigm. Nowadays, IDPs
and IDRs are well characterized and proven to participate in many
molecular and biological processes like DNA or RNA binding,
transcription, translation, and cell-cycle regulation and often in
pathologies
associated
with
misfolding
and
aggregation
[1, 2]. Moreover, 40% of the residues in higher eukaryotic pro-
teomes are predicted to be part of IDPs/IDRs [3, 4]. IDRs are
generally unable to form a stable hydrophobic core and a structured
domain due to the lack of bulky hydrophobic amino acids
[5, 6]. Therefore, IDRs tend to be surface exposed and to interact
with other molecules [7].

During the last decades, the understanding of the functional
role of IDPs/IDRs has advanced rapidly, with the discovery of new
mechanisms [1]. In this sense, a key ﬁnding was the identiﬁcation of
intrinsically disordered domains (IDDs), short linear motifs
(SLIMs), and preformed structural elements (PSE), which partici-
pate in many interactions and provide new functions [8–11]. Addi-
tionally, advances in the experimental detection of intrinsically
disordered regions have had a big impact on structural biology
[12, 13]. Missing electron densities from X-ray diffraction and
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments, solution techni-
ques as NMR spectroscopy [14, 15], and single-molecule ﬂuores-
cence [16] provide complementary information to help the study
of IDPs/IDRs.
MobiDB has been one of the major contributors providing
disorder consensus predictions and annotations for all proteins
available in UniProt, moving forward the ﬁeld since its ﬁrst release
in 2012 [17]. MobiDB beneﬁciates from the DisProt database as
the reference repository of manually curated IDRs [18]. DisProt
represents the gold standard for the development of intrinsically
disorder predictors, which are fundamental for MobiDB automatic
annotation. Ever since other curated databases focused on disorder
started to appear, such as Intrinsically Disordered proteins with
Extensive Annotations and Literature (IDEAL) [19], Disordered
Binding Site (DIBS) [10], Mutual Folding Induced by Binding
(MFIB) [20], Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource [9], and
FuzDB [21], MobiDB has integrated their information. However,
despite the large interest in the ﬁeld and availability of dedicated
resources, the relationship between (un)structure and function of
IDRs is still poorly understood, with only a few widely studied
exceptions like α-synuclein, tau, p53, and E1A proteins [7].
This chapter describes how to explore the world of intrinsically
disordered proteins through the MobiDB database, with the aim to
provide a practical guide for managing and processing the
contained information, explaining the different levels of informa-
tion conﬁdence, and to promote best practices to use and interpret
disorder predictions.

Materials
The MobiDB database can be found at URL http://mobidb.bio.
unipd.it. The home page (Fig. 1) shows general information about
the integrated resources, database version, and citation. Addition-
ally, the initial page has two text boxes to search proteins in the
database by using the following criteria: (1) UniProt, UniParc, and
UniRef accession codes (e.g., for “Microtubule-associated protein
tau,” P10636, UPI0000EE80B7 and UniRef100_P10636, respec-
tively), (2) reference genome accession (e.g., UP000005640 for
128
Alexander Miguel Monzon et al.

Homo sapiens), (3) NCBI taxon ID (e.g., 10,090 for Mus muscu-
lus), and (4) text search using UniProt-style queries (e.g., “human
AND antigen” for all entries containing both terms). More infor-
mation about how to search in the database can be found by
pressing the question marks on the home page.
When a search produces more than one protein as a result, the
database shows a table listing all retrieved proteins, indicating by
default the following columns: UniProt ID, organism, length, gene
name, protein name, origin dataset, and MobiDB-lite disorder
content. Moreover, some examples can be accessed by directly
clicking on their names below the central text box at the
home page.

Discovering
Protein Intrinsic
Disorder Using MobiDB
3.0
At the time of writing, MobiDB 3.0 [22] is the most up-to-date
version of MobiDB. Since its creation in 2012 [17] and ﬁrst major
renewal in 2014 [23], MobiDB has become a central resource for
large-scale protein intrinsic disorder and mobility annotations.
Fig. 1 The MobiDB home page has two search boxes to look for proteins in the database by different criteria.
Additionally, this page shows the database version, news, and the external resources which have been
integrated in the database

MobiDB comprises different types of disorder annotations and
different quality levels of disorder evidence. The information is
organized in three type of annotations: intrinsically disordered
regions (IDRs), linear interacting peptides (LIPs), and dynamic
structure/secondary structure populations. While it is at this
point obvious what intrinsic disorder is, it may not be so straight-
forward to understand the concept of LIPs and secondary structure
populations. LIPs are structural fragments that undergo folding
upon binding by interacting with other molecules while preserving
an elongated structure. Dynamic structure, instead, refers to the
propensity of a residue to assume a speciﬁc secondary structure
conformation, or the abundance of a speciﬁc conformation in a
population of molecules in solution. The second deﬁnition is
adopted when this information is derived from nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) secondary chemical shifts. The three different
types of annotations are further classiﬁed depending on the quality
of the source of information they come from. High-quality data are
imported from manually curated external databases. Intermediate-
quality annotations are derived from experimental data such as
X-ray diffraction, NMR, and NMR chemical shifts. Disorder pre-
dictions are provided by different computational methods and
represent the lowest quality and conﬁdence, even though they
have by far the largest coverage by including all UniProt proteins.
In order to provide the most reliable disorder annotation for each
protein, MobiDB combines all its data sources into a consensus
annotation, prioritizing curated and indirect pieces of evidence over
predictions.
The web server provides a user-friendly interface which allows
to easily explore disorder annotations for a given protein. A fully
dynamic feature viewer manages the visualization of disorder
regions and allows the generation of high-quality images for publi-
cation. When available, MobiDB annotation is also projected onto
a protein structure and shown in a 3D viewer. Additionally, the web
server offers programmatic access through RESTful services (see
Note 1).
3.1.1
Curated Data
High-quality
annotations
in
MobiDB
come
from
external
resources which provide manually curated evidence. Intrinsically
disordered regions are extracted from three databases, DisProt
[18], FuzDB [21], and UniProt [24]. In addition, Pfam [25] and
Gene3D [26] annotations are integrated to show complementary
information on folded (not disordered) domains.
DisProt [18] is the largest database which covers manually
curated ID annotations [27]. Records in DisProt are evidence-
centric, and quality tags are added to an IDR when the annotation
is ambiguous, for example, if an experiment was performed under
extremely nonphysiological conditions (AMBEXP label) or an
engineered sequence has been used (AMBSEQ label) (see Note 2)
130
Alexander Miguel Monzon et al.

[18]. MobiDB only contains DisProt annotations without ambigu-
ity tags. In the latest version of MobiDB, DisProt disordered
regions are propagated by homology, exploiting GeneTree align-
ments [28] with a similarity constraint of 80%. To ensure alignment
signiﬁcance, only regions with at least ten residues are propagated.
This procedure increases the IDR annotations from 800 to about
10,000 proteins.
A signiﬁcant fraction of disordered regions fold upon binding.
In MobiDB they are provided by the following databases:
(1) IDEAL [19], where these regions are called ProS; (2) Database
of Disordered Binding Sites (DIBS) [10]; (3) Mutual Folding
Induced by Binding (MFIB) [20]; and (4) ELM [9]. DIBS contains
disordered regions which fold upon binding with a globular part-
ner, whereas MFIB contains only entries where both the interactors
are disordered. IDEAL provides a collection of manually curated
IDPs/IDRs, including functional annotations as protein binding
regions and posttranslational modiﬁcations. ELM is the main
resource focused on the detection and annotation of eukaryotic
linear motifs.
3.1.2
Derived Data
Indirect experimental data sources provide annotations from X-ray
experiments, NMR three-dimensional models, and NMR chemical
shift data. The annotation from X-ray and NMR structures is
derived by processing the entire Protein Data Bank (PDB) with
the Mobi 2.0 software [29]. Chemical shift data, available from the
Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) database, [30]
are processed by an internal pipeline. Indirect disorder information
is derived from PDB in three different ways by considering (1) miss-
ing, (2) high temperature, and (3) mobile residues. Missing resi-
dues are those for which the detected electron density is not sharp
enough to model the corresponding structure. This happens when
the residues are not aligned in the different unit cells of the crystal,
i.e., are not ﬁxed. In MobiDB, they are detected simply by compar-
ing the sequence used in the experiment, i.e., PDB SEQRES, with
the resolved residues, i.e., those with an ATOM ﬁeld in the PDB
ﬁle. High temperature residues are those with high normalized
B-factors in X-ray and cryo-EM structures (see Note 3). Mobile
residues are assigned from NMR structure by superimposing all
models in the PDB ﬁle and calculating the distance between equiv-
alent Cα atoms. Positions which change signiﬁcantly across differ-
ent models can be interpreted as mobile/disordered residues (see
Note 4) [31]. LIPs are also derived from the PDB structures by
measuring the local inter/intra-chain contact ratio in protein
complexes. Since LIP regions are preserving a linear structure
even when interacting with another protein, they are particularly
prone to form only inter-chain contacts with the partner rather
than intra-chain contacts. Contacts are obtained with the RING
Exploring MobiDB
131

[32] software, which generates the residue interaction network of
each structure (see Note 5).
NMR spectroscopy provides valuable information about pro-
tein dynamics in solution. In particular, it provides quantitative
information on structural ﬂuctuations and different conformational
populations [33]. Chemical shifts are useful to quantify these ﬂuc-
tuations at wide timescale ranges, providing a statistical view of
secondary structure elements in different molecular populations
[33]. Chemical shift data from BMRB [30] provide the basis to
calculate secondary structure populations. In MobiDB, secondary
structure populations and backbone ﬂexibility are calculated with
the δ2D [34] and Random Coil Index (RCI) [35] software from
two-dimensional spectra (see Note 6). In order to obtain accurate
mappings, secondary structure populations are calculated only for
those residues where chemical shifts are available for at least three
different atom types [34]. MobiDB also informs about the experi-
mental conditions like presence of binding partners, lipids, pH,
etc., since they have a strong impact on the biological function of
the protein [33]. All this information can be explored through the
feature viewer (see later). When an entry has multiple tracks of
chemical shift data associated, a consensus is provided on the top.
Additionally, the feature viewer can be expanded, and, by putting
the mouse over a chemical shift annotation, it is possible to see
experimental conditions and the title of the corresponding BMRB
entry in a tooltip.
Lastly, MobiDB includes indirect information about the con-
formational diversity in globular regions extracted from CoDNaS
database [36]. CoDNaS estimates the degree of conformational
diversity of a particular protein by redundant structures of the
same sequence (conformers) by a structural superposition.
3.1.3
Predicted Data
MobiDB provides disorder predictions for all UniProt entries using
the following predictors: DisEMBL [37], ESpritz [38], GlobPlot
[39], IUPred [40], Jronn [41], and VSL2b [42]. Each predictor
provides a binary classiﬁcation for each residue (ordered or disor-
dered) which is shown in two different colors on the feature viewer.
A consensus disorder prediction is shown at the top and is gener-
ated using all outputs of the abovementioned software (see next
section for more information). Complementary to disorder predic-
tions, MobiDB integrates other tools such as DynaMine [43],
ANCHOR [44], and FeSS [45].
Since protein dynamics is closely related with protein disorder,
DynaMine [43] is a fast and accurate predictor of backbone dynam-
ics using only sequence information. DynaMine provides a score
from zero to one for each amino acid, being one for complete order
(stable/rigid conformation) and zero for highly dynamic (multiple
conformations/disorder) (see Note 7). ANCHOR [44] is a method
132
Alexander Miguel Monzon et al.

for predicting disordered binding regions using only sequence
information. In order to predict regions capable of undergoing a
disorder-to-order transition upon binding, ANCHOR combines
three key properties to perform predictions: (1) ensuring that a
given residue is part of a long disordered region to ﬁlter out
globular domains, (2) that a residue is not able to form enough
favorable contacts with other residues sequentially close in the
isolated state, and (3) the ability of a given residue to form sufﬁcient
favorable interactions with globular proteins upon binding. To
predict these properties, this method is based on the pairwise
energy
estimation
approach
used
in
IUPred,
a
disorder
predictor [40].
This
method
provides
LIP
annotations
for
all
protein
sequences in the database. Finally, FeSS is part of the FELLS
method [45] which predicts secondary structure propensity in
three states (helix, sheet, coil) based on the same single-sequence
neural network architecture as ESpritz [38]. FeSS prediction can be
interpreted in analogy to the secondary structure population
obtained
by
δ2D
from
chemical
shifts.
In
addition,
two
low-complexity predictors, SEG [46] and Pﬁlt [47], are used to
highlight regions with poor complexity which are particularly
abundant in disordered proteins. These methods analyze the
sequence amino acid composition to ﬁnd compositionally biased
regions.
3.1.4
Consensus Data
One of the key and exclusive features of MobiDB is the consensus
generated from different annotation sources. For disorder predic-
tions, two consensus types are generated, MobiDB-lite and “sim-
ple.” The MobiDB-lite consensus [48] provides highly speciﬁc
predictions (low false-positive rate) of long disordered regions
(at least 20 residues long) (see Subheading 3.2.3). To deﬁne a
residue as disordered, at least ﬁve out of eight predictors have to
agree with the prediction. This consensus is shown on the feature
viewer in two representations, a continuous line showing the frac-
tion of methods voting disorder and a discrete view showing disor-
dered regions, calculated based on a post-processing on the
agreement among predictions. MobiDB-lite provides an additional
characterization of the predicted regions related to their functional
role. Different types of disordered regions are classiﬁed according
to the fraction of charged residues and net charge [49]: weak
polyampholytes (D_WC), negative polyelectrolytes (D_NPE), pos-
itive polyelectrolytes (D_PPE), and polyampholytes (D_PA). This
information is shown when the mouse is placed over a region in the
MobiDB-lite track. The “simple” consensus is not shown on the
web interface but is available in the JSON ﬁle, which contains the
entire information stored in the database for a given protein and is
available for download. This type of consensus is less conservative
Exploring MobiDB
133

than MobiDB-lite and provides regions of different length without
any restriction and post-processing. Disorder is assigned based on
an agreement of at least one out of eight votes.
For indirect annotation sources (PDB and BMRB), a consensus
is additionally generated for each different aspect: missing, mobile,
and high temperature residues and LIPs. The consensus combines
information from different chains in three categories: structure,
conﬂict and disorder for disorder-related annotations or LIPs, and
conﬂict and non-LIP for LIPs-related annotations. To classify a
residue as structured or disordered, 90% of the available evidence
(e.g., missing residues regions in PDB chains) needs to agree.
Between these two classiﬁcations, a residue is classiﬁed as in “con-
ﬂict.” A comprehensive consensus of indirect annotations is shown
on the feature viewer and is generated by merging the different
consensuses of each source (missing residues, mobile and high
temperature). In this case, when a single component disagrees,
the ﬁnal classiﬁcation is conﬂict/ambiguous.
Two different consensuses are also shown for the curated
annotation, one for disorder and one for LIPs. The consensus in
this case is generated by merging all regions without checking the
agreement. However, if a Gene3D structured domain is available,
overlapping residues appear in conﬂict. Finally, an overall consensus
is generated considering curated and indirect sources and MobiDB-
lite prediction, prioritizing curated and indirect data in analogy to
previous versions of MobiDB [23].
3.2
Applications
3.2.1
Working Case:
Beta-Catenin
Beta-catenin (or catenin beta-1) is a component of the cadherin
protein complex in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway [50–
52]. This protein has a dual function acting in the regulation and
coordination
of
gene
transcription
and
cell–cell
adhesion
[53, 54]. The structured core of the protein is composed of several
armadillo repeats which fold in a typically rigid domain [55]. The
N- and C-terminal regions bordering the armadillo repeats seem to
be disordered in solution, playing a central role in beta-catenin
function [56]. In MobiDB, this protein can be found using the
UniProt identiﬁer P35222. The MobiDB home page has two
search boxes (one in the middle and another on the top-right
corner) where the user can write the UniProt, UniRef, UniParc,
Proteome, or taxonomy ID to ﬁnd a protein (Fig. 1). After writing
the UniProt ID and pressing the search button, the protein entry
page appears, showing general information about this protein
(gene, name, organism, localization, taxonomy, among others)
and an overview of the annotation in the feature viewer (Fig. 2).
From the feature viewer in the entry page, two disordered regions
at the C- and N-termini, covering about 30% of the residues, are
visualized in the full consensus track. Looking at the curated data,
these two regions are annotated by DisProt predicted (transfer by
homology) and are almost perfectly separated by a folded domain
134
Alexander Miguel Monzon et al.

annotated by Gene3D (Fig. 3). These disordered regions have been
annotated by homology from the mouse beta-catenin (see Subhead-
ing 3.1.1). In addition to disorder, some LIPs, provided by ELM,
DIBS, and IDEAL databases, are concentrated at the protein ends.
For example, a conserved N-terminal SLIM is known from the
literature to bind an E3 ubiquitin ligase when phosphorylated
[57]. The ELM database [9] provides further details about the
functional implications of the MOD_GSK3_1 (phosphorylation
motif) and DEG_SCF_TRCP1_1 (degron motif) sites in beta-
catenin, and DIBS [10] identiﬁes a disordered binding site. In the
Fig. 2 The protein entry page contains all annotations for a given protein in MobiDB. On the top, it shows
general information such as disorder content (%), protein name, localization, and length, among others. The
star next to the UniProt ID indicates the degree of evidence that this protein has: (1) a fully colored star is
manually curated evidence, (2) a half-colored star is indirect evidence, and (3) an uncolored star means only
predictions. At the bottom, this page displays the feature viewer where all the annotations are shown. The
feature viewer has ﬁve sections depending on which annotation the user wants to visualize. Additionally, the
viewer allows zooming in and out on speciﬁc regions, to download a high-quality image, to see the protein
sequence, and to open the 3D viewer (only in the indirect section). Red, gray, and blue bars indicate
disordered, ambiguous, and ordered regions, respectively
Exploring MobiDB
135

indirect annotation section (derived data), MobiDB shows infor-
mation for LIPs and missing and high temperature residues. Miss-
ing residue data agrees with curated sources, as the N-terminus is
completely disordered in one structure (PDB code 2Z6H, chain
A). The C-terminus is completely removed when generating crys-
tals for X-ray experiments; therefore it is not available in the
SEQRES and not detected in the missing residues track. Addition-
ally, based on the structural information, some LIPs are derived and
in agreement with the SLIMs annotated in ELM. MobiDB-lite also
predicts two IDRs at the C- and N-termini, meaning that the
majority of other predictors also agree. In addition, ANCHOR
[44] predicts binding regions around ELM and DIBS motifs, over-
lapping with IDRs identiﬁed by the majority of annotation sources.
3.2.2
Disorder Flavors
A series of very different phenomena have been deﬁned under the
same name of intrinsic disorder (ID). Various approaches have been
adopted to classify different types of ID [1]. The simplest feature to
consider is region length. Short and long IDRs are substantially
different [58, 59] both in terms of function [60] and evolution
[61]. Another feature is the sequence conservation [62] which has
been used to distinguish conserved IDRs (constrained disorder)
and non-conserved sequences which instead only preserve the dis-
order content (ﬂexible disorder). Sequence composition is another
way to classify disorder, as it clearly inﬂuences the physical behavior
of the protein [63]. At least three different disorder ﬂavors, which
differ
in
amino
acid
composition,
sequence
locations,
and
biological function, were identiﬁed by an automatic sequence clas-
siﬁcation and disorder prediction [64]. A more recent classiﬁcation

Alexander Miguel Monzon et al.

considers the fraction of charged residues (FCR) as a simple way to
distinguish between extended, coil-like, and more compact, molten
globule like IDRs [49]. Different predictors are biased to capture
different ID ﬂavors, and their limited agreement makes ID investi-
gation a complex issue [65]. MobiDB-lite produces a consensus
prediction from many different predictors and classiﬁes predicted
regions following an improved version of the classiﬁcation pro-
posed in [49]. In conclusion, MobiDB provides the most complete
picture on different ID ﬂavors covering the whole protein universe
as deﬁned by UniProt [66] and captures different aspects of disor-
der both at the structural and functional levels.
3.2.3
MobiDB-Lite Could
Help to Identify Order–
Disorder Transitions
MobiDB-lite predictions are conservative but help to detect disor-
der/order transitions. MobiDB-lite predictions also include differ-
ent ﬂavors of disorder regions (see Subheading 3.2.2). Due to
limited experimental data, most of the MobiDB entries contain
only predicted information. MobiDB-lite was designed to provide
highly speciﬁc annotations, meaning that this algorithm is very
conservative and, if a region is annotated as disordered, the user
can be highly conﬁdent that this predicted region is disordered at
physiological conditions when unbound [48]. One limitation of
this method is that it cannot capture functional ID regions shorter
than 20 residues and/or which undergo disorder-to-order transi-
tions. To underline this behavior, we will focus on two real case
examples. A short, folded region bordered by predicted disorder
regions could indicate a potential disorder-to-order transition
[67]. This behavior can be noticed in the prediction of 4E binding
protein one (4EBP1, UniProt identiﬁer Q13541). 4EBP1 is a
repressor protein which controls eIF4E activity [68]. The short,
folded region bordered by disordered regions is predicted as
ordered by MobiDB-lite from residues 49 to 63. However, two
predictors, ESpritz-DisProt and VSL2b, identify this region as
disordered. ANCHOR [44] also predicts a disordered binding
region from residues 38 to 66. From the predicted data, we can
observe a potential LIP, which undergoes a disorder-to-order tran-
sition upon binding to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E). This observation has been proven by NMR studies, where
4EBP1 is completely disordered on its own [69], but undergoes
disorder-to-order transition [70] during binding to and inhibition
of eIF4E (Fig. 4). A similar phenomenon can be observed for p53
(UniProt identiﬁer P04637) from residues 320 to 356, which con-
stitutes the C-terminal domain consisting of a tetramerization
domain. MobiDB-lite predicts it as structured, but this region is
in DisProt annotated as disordered and can also undergo disorder-
to-order transition [71] during interaction.

Notes
1. Many bioinformatics resources have both a graphical user inter-
face (GUI) and an application programming interface (API).
MobiDB supports API accessibility via RESTful (REpresenta-
tional State Transfer) web services [22]. In this way, all
MobiDB data are accessible through custom software clients
via HTTP URLs. These services are useful for performing
complex bioinformatics analysis or to import MobiDB data
into third-party resources through standard HTTP requests.
Fig. 4 Disorder-to-order transition in 4EBP1. The MobiDB-lite disorder consensus prediction is shown at the
top with the predictors used to produce the consensus. At the bottom it is possible to see a fragment of the
4EBP1 structure (PDB code: 1WKW) from residues 47 to 66 bound to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E.
This region (colored in red) can undergo disorder to order when interacting with eIF4E to form a small h-helix.

For example, the DisProt database uses the MobiDB APIs to
list which PDB structures are available for a given protein [18].
2. It is hard to interpret unambiguously ID content from some
IDP experiments. The annotation interface of DisProt allows
the curators to report ambiguous information for each region
evidence. The “AMBEXP” tag is used to report ambiguous
experimental evidence, for example, when the experiment was
performed under extreme conditions, low-resolution struc-
tures, and unclear information about disorder position inside
the sequence. The “AMBSEQ” tag indicates when the experi-
ment is carried out on non-native sequence, i.e., engineered or
fragment, ambiguous literature evidence, among others.
3. Residues are ﬂagged as high B-factor when they have B-factors
above
the
theoretical
B-factor
(Wilson
B)
for
the
corresponding resolution increased by 25%, e.g., the Wilson
B factor for a structure with a resolution between 1.25 and
1.50 A˚ is 13.50 A˚ 2.
4. The formula SD ¼ 1/((1 + (d/d0)2) is used to compute and
scale the distances between the same Cαs in all superimposi-
tions, where d is the distance between two Cαs and d0 is a
normalization factor [31]. Average and standard deviation of
the scaled distances are computed. The program computes the
φ and ψ angles standard deviation for all the amino acids in all
the models. These are used to assign mobility to neighboring
residues to those assigned as mobile according to SD average
and its standard deviation. The parameter d0 is set to 4 A˚ . SD,
its standard deviation, and φ and ψ angles standard deviation
thresholds are set to 0.85, 0.09, and 20 and 20, respectively.
These thresholds have been optimized to maximize the agree-
ment with disorder deﬁnitions on 19 NMR structure targets
evaluated in CASP8 [72].
5. Residue interaction networks (RINs) are a way of representing
protein structures where nodes are residues and arcs are the
physicochemical interactions among them. The RING software
[32] allows the identiﬁcation of covalent and non-covalent
bonds in protein structures, including hydrogen bonds, salt
bridges, disulﬁde bonds, van der Waals and π-cation interac-
tions, and π–π stacking. The software calculates intra- and inter-
chain contacts, even considering ligand and solvent atoms.
6. The δ2D method is able to translate a set of chemical shifts into
probabilities
of
occupation
of
secondary
structure
(SS) elements [34]. This approach is based on a generalization
of another method which can deﬁne the random coil chemical
shifts from the amino acid sequence of a protein [73]. The
method uses four sequence-based SS predictors to obtain the
Exploring MobiDB
139

ideal chemical shifts for h-helix, ®-sheet, and polyproline II
(PPII). These predictions are considered as the chemical shifts
that would be measured for a given sequence in a state with a
100% population of a particular SS [34]. Then, δ2D combines
these predictions and compares the results with the experimen-
tal chemical shifts to extract the most probable SS populations.
The RCI method was developed by ﬁtting backbone chemical
shift curated data to an extensive set of protein MD simulations
and is able to detect motions in the range of picoseconds to
nanoseconds [35].
7. DynaMine is based on a linear regression approach to predict
protein ﬂexibility directly from sequence information. Dyna-
Mine uses the chemical shifts of 2015 proteins to generate a
curated dataset which contains per-residue information about
fast protein backbone movements. This dataset is used to ana-
lyze statistically and quantitatively the backbone dynamics
properties for each amino acid, allowing identiﬁcation of
those amino acids with a tendency to promote order-to-disor-
der transitions.

An Easy Protocol for Evolutionary Analysis of Intrinsically
Disordered Proteins
Janelle Nunez-Castilla and Jessica Siltberg-Liberles
Abstract
We present an easy protocol for evolutionary analysis of proteins, with an emphasis on studying the
evolutionary dynamics of disordered regions. Using the p53 protein family as an example, we provide a
guide for ﬁnding homologous sequences in a database and reﬁning a dataset before constructing the
evolutionary context by building a phylogenetic tree. We show how a multiple sequence alignment and
phylogeny for a protein family can be further partitioned into smaller datasets in order to investigate the
changes in disorder content across the phylogeny. Based on the evolutionary context, we also investigate
site-speciﬁc conservation of disorder. Last, we address how to evaluate the evolutionary dynamics of
disorder-to-order transitions.

Introduction
Protein families consist of homologous protein sequences that have
evolved from a common ancestor. These homologous sequences
are related by speciation (orthologs) or by gene duplication (para-
logs). Sequences evolve, primarily, by amino acid substitutions, but
also through insertions and deletions (indels). Typically, orthologs
tend to be more similar to each other in sequence substitution
patterns than they are to paralogs, such that orthologs form mono-
phyletic clades [1] (Fig. 1a). The primary reason for the increased
rate of sequence divergence for paralogs is relaxed selective pressure
caused by the immediate functional redundancy that follows a gene
duplication event. The most common scenario after a gene dupli-
cation event is for one copy to become a pseudogene. Retention of
multiple paralogs is often due to divergence in function or

Fig. 1 Examples of evolutionary contexts. (a) The ﬁrst evolutionary context is illustrated by a ﬁctional
phylogenetic tree. The phylogeny has the protein name and the species it is from at the tips. All sequences
called protein_A are found under node A , and this means that this is a monophyletic clade. We call this Clade
A (blue). Similarly, all sequences called protein_B are found under node B. We call this Clade B (red). The
proteins in Clade A are orthologs to each other. Orthologs are related by speciation (nodes marked S) and often
have a highly similar function. The proteins in Clade A are paralogs to the proteins in Clade B. Paralogs are
related by gene duplication (nodes marked GD) and tend to diverge to some extent in function or dosage.
Through functional divergence, the sequences in Clade A and the sequences in Clade B often display clade-
speciﬁc patterns of amino acid substitutions that can be used to form distinct clades for the paralogous
sequences as seen in this ﬁctional example. To analyze this phylogeny, we may, e.g., compare Clade A to
Clade B. This tree is rooted by outgroup based on the single copy in fruit ﬂy. If the phylogeny lacks a clear
outgroup, the tree can be rooted at midpoint. The second evolutionary context (b) illustrates the concept of a
multiple sequence alignment site. When making a multiple sequence alignment, we aim to put the
corresponding residue from different sequences into the same site, indicating that these are related by
ancestry. Thus, alignment sites are homologous sites. Sites that have experienced indel events are shown as
gaps in the alignment because a homologous residue cannot be identiﬁed. In the example, multiple sequence
alignment site 9 has a conserved G that corresponds to residue position 7 in sequence 2; residue position 8 in
sequences 1, 3, and 5; and residue position 9 in sequence 4 in the unaligned sequences. Multiple sequence
alignment site 10 has a mixture of L and I that corresponds to residue position 8 in sequence 2; residue
position 9 in sequences 1, 3, and 5; and residue position 10 in sequence 4 in the unaligned sequences. A site
in a multiple sequence alignment is often referred to as an alignment site, a homologous site, or, simply, a site

differential expression levels to maintain dosage [1]. When paralogs
diverge in function, the corresponding homologous sites in two
different paralogs often experience different selective pressures
(Fig. 1b). Different selective pressures derive from different site-
speciﬁc contributions to function for the two paralogs. Conse-
quently, not all sites in a protein family accumulate amino acid
substitutions at the same rate, and while there are many reasons
for this phenomena [2], for the purpose of this protocol, we will
focus on intrinsic disorder. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)
have been found to tolerate high sequence substitution rates [3]
but often maintain function as long as the disordered property is
conserved [4]. However, disordered sites that also have secondary
structure have been found to be less prone to accumulate amino
acid substitutions [5, 6]. These sites are likely of critical functional
importance and may be able to form transient or interaction-
dependent secondary structure. Further, indels of one or more
amino acids tend to occur in disordered regions [7]. Altogether,
this implies that some disordered proteins may be evolving very
rapidly, and consequently, ﬁnding homologous sequences and
aligning them accurately becomes a challenge. If there are too few
homologous sequences and if the alignment is of low quality, the
evolutionary analysis can be misleading. This easy protocol is not
recommended
for
such
cases
or
for
highly
repetitive
low-complexity sequences. The main purpose of this protocol is
to study the majority of proteins that contain a mixture of ordered
and disordered regions. To provide an evolutionary context,
homologous proteins (related by ancestry) will be studied as a
protein family that contains a phylogenetic tree that describes
how the sequences are related based on the amino acids at different
sites in their multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and a statistical
model of evolution [8]. Based on these protein families, the evolu-
tionary analysis can focus on comparing different parts of the
phylogeny or MSA and on the evolutionary conservation per align-
ment site (Fig. 1b). This protocol is written with the experimental
molecular biologist in mind and for a small-scale study of one
protein family at a time although it can easily be scaled up to a
large-scale study.

family for evolutionary analysis, it is important to ﬁrst use a set of
different search strategies against different databases to get an idea
of the origin of the protein family and, based on the objective of the
study, which taxa to include in the study (see Note 1). For a given

protein sequence (the query), start by determining which taxa or
domains of life or phyla contain homologs of the protein. For this
purpose, we recommend Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) where you can choose between different databases such as
the nr database, the refseq_protein database, and the landmark
database (see Note 2). We will start our exploration of which taxa
contain homologs of the query using the landmark and refseq_pro-
tein databases. In our example, we will use p53 from human (NCBI
accession code: NP_000537.3):
1. Perform a BLAST search using the Blastp algorithm on the
NCBI
server
(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
using
NP_000537.3 as query. Specify the Model organism (land-
mark) database. In May 2019, the search returns 75 hits. The
taxonomy report indicates that most hits have been found in
the three vertebrates, but there are three hits in one of the
invertebrates, and there is one hit in one bacteria (Fig. 3a).
Further, if we look at the ﬁrst three hits in the main report, it
shows three hits from Homo sapiens (Fig. 3b). The ﬁrst hit is
our query, and it has 100% query coverage and 100% sequence
identity. The second hit has a query coverage of 90% and 100%
sequence identity. The third hit has a query coverage of 86%
and 97.65% sequence identity. These are all good hits in the
sense that query coverage and sequence identity are high and
the E-value (the chance of observing this hit at random in the
given database) is low (see Note 3). If we look at the bottom
three, we note that the query coverage and sequence identity
are lower and the E-values are higher for all three hits. Depend-
ing on the purpose of the study, we have to decide what
minimum query coverage, minimum sequence identity, and
maximum E-value are acceptable to include the BLAST hits
as homologs in our dataset. It is typically better to be more
inclusive for starters, and in this case, we will include the third
hit from the bottom, but not the two thereafter due to their
high E-values. The second to the last hit is for the sole bacteria
in the original hit list; excluding this hit means that we did not
ﬁnd a homolog in bacteria after all. The very last hit is from
Danio rerio, one of the vertebrates, and even if it is excluded,
there are 13 other sequences from this species left (Fig. 3a).
The default setting for BLAST is to show the ﬁrst 100 hits
and to list these by E-value. It is therefore beneﬁcial that our
BLAST search led us to exclude the two last hits, because that
means that all hits in this database were found. Had all our hits
had a query coverage of 100%, a sequence identity of 90%, and
an E-value of 0.0, we would need to change the default setting
for how many hits are returned and rerun the BLAST search.
We would have encountered such a scenario if we had chosen
the refseq_protein database (see Note 4).
152
Janelle Nunez-Castilla and Jessica Siltberg-Liberles

2. Our BLAST search against the Model organism database
resulted in 38 hits in Homo sapiens, 19 hits in Mus musculus,
13 hits in Danio rerio, and 3 hits in Drosophila melanogaster.
The multiple hits in each species indicate that there may be
alternative splice forms (aka isoforms) or multiple homologous
genes in each species (paralogs), or perhaps a combination of
isoforms and paralogs (see Note 5). If we select all sequences,
except the last two that we above decided to exclude, and click
on GenPept, our 73 hits are shown in the main Protein database
in NCBI (Fig. 4a). If we change the database shown to Gene,
Fig. 3 Initial BLAST results. (a) The Blastp search with the query (NP_000537.3) against the Model organism
database results in 75 hits. Most sequences are from vertebrates, but three sequences are from Drosophila
melanogaster and one is from Streptococcus. (b) The top hits show that the search identiﬁed the query as the
best hit. Importantly, the bottom three hits (c) show that the default setting of 100 sequences is enough to
identify all sequences of interest because the two last hits have very poor E-values. The second to last
sequence is from Streptococcus. It has a very short query coverage of 9% and will be excluded. The last
sequence has higher query coverage but lower sequence identity to the query. Although these numbers are
rather similar to the third to last hit, the last hit is much longer than the query, and it will be excluded
Protein Family Analysis of Intrinsic Disorder

Fig. 4 Selecting the longest isoform. (a) GenPept shows all 73 hits. Under Find related data, selecting Gene (b)
shows the 10 genes these proteins are from. By selecting one gene at a time (c) and returning to the
refseq_protein database, the protein isoforms from the same genes can be identiﬁed (d) so that the longest
isoform can be chosen

we can see that the 73 proteins come from 10 genes, 3 genes
per vertebrate and 1 gene from Drosophila melanogaster
(Fig. 4b). This conﬁrms that a combination of isoforms and
paralogs explains why there were so many hits. When isoforms
have been identiﬁed, caution must be taken to only include one
isoform per gene in order to not bias the phylogeny (Fig. 4c
and d). However, determining which isoform to include is not
always trivial. Some studies choose to include the longest iso-
form, and others rely on other metrics. We will return to this
topic below.
3. Run another Blastp search with the same query against the
refseq_protein database. Given the size of this database, it is
necessary to increase the number of hits from 100 (under
Algorithm parameters at the bottom of the page, change the
Max Target Sequences to the desired number). Increasing it to
5000 will display all >2600 hits for our starting query in this
database. Most hits are from vertebrates, but some seem to be
from invertebrates. Rerunning the same Blastp search while
excluding vertebrates yields about 400 sequences. Excluding
metazoan yields less than 10 hits, and most hits are in single-
cell eukaryotes. These hits have rather low query coverage, but
several have the same Pfam domains as p53, and they have been
documented as p53 homologs before (see Note 6) [9–11].
3.2
Using BLAST
to Generate a Dataset
After our initial exploration of the taxonomic distribution of p53,
we selected 23 species against which to perform our BLAST search.
Of our selected species, 21 were metazoans and 2 were choano-
ﬂagellates. The metazoans can be further broken down into
13 chordates (11 vertebrates), 1 placazoan, 1 poriferan, 1 cnidarian,
1 echinoderm, and 4 arthropods. We used p53 from Homo sapiens
(NP_000537.3) as our query and chose to BLAST against the
refseq_protein database. To specify our 23 organisms, we added
in each taxa individually under the Organism option for the Search
Set and took note of the actual taxid number for each taxa. Lastly,
we increased the max target sequences to 250.
3.2.1
Isoform Selection
Before we can begin selecting which isoforms we want to include in
our dataset, we need to check if there are any sequences that we
want to exclude right away based on query coverage, sequence
identity, and E-value. For our BLAST results, the highest E-value
was 2e-07, which is still relatively low. Therefore, no sequences
were excluded based on E-value. While some hits had lower query
coverage (21–35%), these were not immediately excluded as we
wanted our initial dataset to be as inclusive as possible and the E-
values were still acceptable (see Note 3). Similarly, we did not
exclude sequences on the basis of low sequence identity as that
would have removed many of the invertebrate sequences.
Protein Family Analysis of Intrinsic Disorder
155

We will begin to form our dataset ﬁrst by selecting all hits and
then removing (by deselecting) the isoforms that we are no longer
interested in, using predeﬁned criteria to guide isoform selection
(see Note 7). To select the best isoform per gene, it is ﬁrst impor-
tant to determine how many genes are present for a given organism
in our results. To do this, we select All sequences and view the
GenPept page, as described above. If any sequences were excluded
due to poor query coverage, sequence identity, or E-value, we
would not select All but instead be sure to only select the sequences
that are still potential candidates for our dataset. Once at the
GenPept page, we can ﬁnd the related Gene database information
for our hits, where we can see the number of genes that correspond
to each species (Fig. 4). Once we know how many and which genes
are present within a given species, we can go back to the GenPept
page in order to more easily see the length of the isoforms so that
the longest can be selected as the representative for each gene. The
other isoforms in the results can then be deselected. Additionally,
we caution against only relying on the sequence names and not
taking into account gene ID information (see Note 8). As you
construct your dataset, we recommend systematically going
through one species at a time as you decide which sequences to
include and exclude from your dataset. It is important to exercise
care and patience during this process to minimize human error and
avoid the accidental inclusion of the incorrect or undesired isoform.
Once we only have the sequences of interest selected, we can
download the sequences in FASTA format by clicking Download
and selecting FASTA (complete sequence) (see Note 9).
3.2.2
Renaming Headers
Now that we have generated our initial dataset, we recommend
renaming the sequence headers in the FASTA ﬁle before moving on
to any downstream analyses. The new headers should be relatively
short while remaining informative and devoid of any other special
characters. We recommend maintaining the unique sequence acces-
sion number and adding a unique species abbreviation in the short-
ened headers. Using unique species abbreviations in the headers
will simplify the downstream tree analysis. Based on the taxids for
the taxa used during the Blastp search, a species tree can be built
using either NCBI’s Common Tree (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Taxonomy/CommonTree/wwwcmt.cgi) or the NCBI tax-
onomy module (from ETE [12, 13]) for making a species tree
based on NCBI taxids. The NCBI taxonomy module provides
increased resolution of species relationships and was used here
(see supplementary material for the script commontree.py). We
then manually added our species abbreviations used in our headers
after the taxonomic name for each species (Fig. 5).

3.3
Making
a High-Quality Multiple
Sequence Alignment
When homologous sequences have been identiﬁed, these sequences
must be aligned. Proteins evolve by amino acid substitutions and by
insertions and deletions (indels). The purpose of creating a multiple
sequence alignment is to place homologous residues from the
different sequences in the same site and to add gaps as needed to
account for indels as accurately as possible, although gapped
regions are difﬁcult to align [14]. If the sequence composition is
changed in the dataset either by adding or removing a sequence or
by, e.g., truncating a sequence, the multiple sequence alignment
must be redone. The amino acid identities at homologous sites
across the multiple sequence alignment can be used to infer a
protein family phylogeny that displays how the sequences in the
Fig. 5 Taxonomic selection. Species tree of the species included in the study. The species abbreviation used in
tree ﬁgures is shown within parentheses. The placement of taxonomic groups used in the study (vertebrates,
metazoan, and choanoﬂagellates) is emphasized. Throughout this protocol, we refer to non-vertebrates as all
species not included in the vertebrate set and invertebrates as all species not included in the vertebrate and
choanoﬂagellate sets. The species tree was generated based on the organisms’ taxids from NCBI with Python
using the “NCBI taxonomy module” in ETE [12, 13]. See supplementary material for the script commontree.py

dataset are related to each other. There are many algorithms for
making multiple sequence alignments, e.g., Muscle [15, 16],
PRANK [17], T-Coffee [18], and MAFFT [19, 20] (see Note 10).
3.3.1
Multiple Sequence
Alignment Construction
We will build a multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT from
the MAFFT webserver for our initial dataset with the renamed
headers:
1. Upload the FASTA ﬁle with the initial dataset to the MAFFT
webserver https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/.
2. Alignment strategy can be automatic (default), where the pro-
gram chooses the best alignment strategy depending on the
data. You can also select the alignment strategy yourself. Here,
we recommend L-INS-i as it has been shown to be more
accurate than other methods [21, 22].
3. Submit job.
4. After the program has ﬁnished, click View to see the alignment.
You have the option to launch an MSAviewer in your current
window or a new window.
5. To save a FASTA ﬁle with your alignment, click Export and
select Export alignment (FASTA).
3.3.2
Multiple Sequence
Alignment Visualization
1. Open the alignment viewer Jalview [23]. Jalview can be down-
loaded from here http://www.jalview.org/Download.
2. Establish min–max lengths.
Oftentimes
datasets
need
to
be
reﬁned
to
remove
sequences
that
may
affect
downstream
analyses.
These
sequences are easier to identify in the context of the multiple
sequence alignment. Thus, it is recommended to establish
min–max sequence length limits to remove sequences that
negatively affect the quality of the dataset. Depending on the
biological question you are trying to answer, you may also
choose to remove sequences that have very large indel regions
(whether large insertions or deletions). Typically, lots of gaps in
the alignment reduces its quality, which can in turn reduce the
quality of the phylogeny that is reconstructed based on that
alignment. From viewing the alignment of the initial dataset, it
was observed that some sequences are quite a bit shorter than
other sequences. To reduce the number of gaps in the align-
ment, four sequences that were shorter than 196 residues (half
the length of human p53) were removed (see Note 11).
3. Remove sequences that are too long or too short according to
your set criteria.
To remove a “bad” sequence in Jalview, select the sequence
you want to remove, right click, and hover over Selection and
Edit, and then click Cut. In all cases when sequences are
158
Janelle Nunez-Castilla and Jessica Siltberg-Liberles

removed from the initial dataset, the methodology must
include speciﬁc details for how sequence removal was deter-
mined so that the work can be reproduced (if you intend to
publish it).
4. Save the edited FASTA ﬁle.
We want to export the remaining sequences for a reﬁned
dataset. First, click Tools, select Preferences, click Output, and
deselect all checked boxes under File Output. The default
setting in Jalview adds a start-end range to the end of the
header when exporting a ﬁle by outputting to a textbox.
Changing this setting will allow us to maintain our headers
without any additional information. Then, we want to remove
all of the gaps by selecting Edit and clicking Remove All Gaps.
To save a FASTA ﬁle of your cleaned dataset, select File (next to
Edit), hover over Output to Textbox, choose FASTA format,
and save the ﬁle. We can now realign our sequences and iterate
the procedure as needed.
5. Realign the edited FASTA ﬁle by repeating steps 1–4 of this
section. The resulting alignment will from here on be referred
to as dataset 1: MSA_ALL_PROTEIN.
6. Reinspect the new alignment. In MSA_ALL_PROTEIN, large
indels were still present, and therefore, additional partitions of
the dataset may be of interest. In this case, two additional
approaches were taken:
(a)
We identiﬁed the Pfam domains for the human p53
sequence that was our query for the BLAST search that
generated the initial dataset (see Note 6). A second dataset
was constructed based on the region that corresponded to
the p53 DNA-binding domain based on Pfam domain
prediction [24, 25] of the query sequence. This dataset
was based on the p53 DNA-binding domain boundaries
(as predicted by Pfam) 10 residues. This dataset can be
created from the ﬁrst multiple sequence alignment by
selecting the entire column for the site 10 residues past
the most C-terminal residue in the p53 DNA-binding
domain for the query sequence in Jalview and executing
the command remove right. Thereafter, the column for the
site 10 residues before the most N-terminal residue in the
domain was selected, and the command remove left was
executed (see Note 12). The resulting shorter sequences
were extracted from Jalview, and a new MAFFT alignment
was constructed as described above. The resulting align-
ment will from here on be referred to as dataset 2:
MSA_ALL_DOMAIN.
(b)
We
excluded
all
non-vertebrate
sequences
from
MSA_ALL_PROTEIN. This third dataset was con-
structed by extracting only the vertebrate sequences
Protein Family Analysis of Intrinsic Disorder
159

from MSA_ALL_PROTEIN in Jalview and building a
new MAFFT alignment as described above. The resulting
alignment will from here on be referred to as dataset 3:
MSA_VERTEBRATE_PROTEIN. For an overview of
the three dataset partitions, see Fig. 6.
3.4
Building
a Phylogenetic Tree
To perform an evolutionary analysis, we need to reconstruct the
phylogenetic tree for the sequences in the dataset. The phyloge-
netic tree for a protein family aims to reﬂect its evolutionary history,
although it may not always exactly follow the expected species tree,
especially if the sequences have low or excessive divergence. How-
ever, the phylogeny often tends to at least group orthologous
sequences (sequences related by speciation) in the same clade and
paralogous sequences (sequences related by gene duplication) in
different clades.
The current state of the art for phylogenetic reconstruction
includes maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches [8]. As
probabilistic model-based methods, these approaches need an
appropriate model of evolution that describes how amino acids
are substituted in order to infer phylogenies with statistical cer-
tainty. The model of evolution is determined through model test-
ing, a necessary step before building a phylogenetic tree. PhyML is
a phylogenetic reconstruction software that is an example of a
maximum likelihood approach [26]. It is quick and can be run
Fig. 6 Sequence datasets. Multiple sequence alignment of the full-length sequences showing amino acid
residues (colored blocks) and gaps (gray lines) generated by TreeView from the ETE Toolkit (http://etetoolkit.
org/treeview/). This alignment will be referred to as MSA_ALL_PROTEIN. The red dashed lines correspond to
the p53 DNA-binding domain in all sequences. The black dashed lines correspond to the vertebrate sequences

using the command line or on a webserver (http://www.atgc-
montpellier.fr/phyml/).The
webserver
performs
automatic
model selection [27]. MrBayes is an example of a Bayesian
approach [28]. It typically takes longer than PhyML and needs to
be run on the command line. MrBayes can use a mixed-model
approach instead of model testing.
3.4.1
Phylogenetic
Reconstruction
1. For this easy protocol, we will use PhyML as an example.
PhyML requires a multiple sequence alignment ﬁle in phylip
format (see Note 13). The standard phylip format poses strict
restrictions on sequence headers, limiting their length to only
10 characters. Often, this can create difﬁculties for researchers
as creating informative and unique headers with a 10-character
limit can be challenging. A relaxed phylip format allows preser-
vation of the original header name by relaxing the 10-character
limit. To this end, we will use SeaView (http://doua.prabi.fr/
software/seaview) [22] to convert our multiple sequence
alignments to phylip format while maintaining the desired
headers. Seaview has a default limit of 30 characters for headers.
If this is still too restrictive for your data, you can increase this
limit. To do so, click Props and select Customize. Where phylip
names width is indicated, write in your desired header length
and then hit Apply. You can then save your multiple sequence
alignment in the relaxed phylip format by selecting File, click-
ing Save as, and choosing ∗.phy as the ﬁle extension.
2. To build the phylogeny, upload the phylip ﬁle to the PhyML
webserver. Our sequence data is based on amino acids, so the
data type needs to be changed to reﬂect this. However, every-
thing else will be left as default settings. Although we will not
modify anything else as we want PhyML to select the model for
us, it is good to note that we can set our own model parameters
using the PhyML webserver. It should be noted that the
PhyML default for evaluating branch supports across the phy-
logeny is a fast likelihood-based method (SH-like support)
[26]. Although we use the default SH-like support for all
trees in this protocol, we recommend changing the setting
from SH-like support to performing 100 bootstraps or more
when the datasets have been completely ﬁnalized unless the
datasets are very large.
3. When the reconstruction is completed, the PhyML results are
emailed in a conveniently packed zip ﬁle. The zip ﬁle contains
information about the best model of evolution from the model
test and statistics about the tree building session. Importantly,
it contains the tree ﬁle in Newick tree format.
Protein Family Analysis of Intrinsic Disorder
161

3.4.2
Tree Visualization
To open the Newick tree ﬁle and to view the tree, we will use
FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ﬁgtree/). As the tree
is opened, FigTree provides the option to rename the values asso-
ciated with the nodes or branches. Here, these values reﬂect the
SH-like branch supports calculated by PhyML [26]. The sequence
names in the phylogenetic tree are called leaves or tips:
1. Root the tree—either by outgroup or by midpoint rooting:
(a)
To root by outgroup, there must be an outgroup
sequence or an outgroup clade included in the dataset.
For instance, if the tree contains orthologs from mammals
and chicken, the sequence from chicken can be used as an
outgroup. To root by outgroup in FigTree, select the
branch leading to the leaf for chicken by clicking on the
leaf name, and then click reroot. To use an entire outgroup
clade to root the tree, select the branch leading to that
clade followed by reroot.
(b)
If there is no clear outgroup, you can root your tree by
midpoint. When you root by midpoint, the root is placed
in the middle of the longest path between the most distant
leaves in your tree. To root by midpoint in FigTree, go to
Tree and Midpoint Root.
2. Arrange in decreasing node order. In FigTree, go to Tree and
Decreasing Node Order.
3. Show branch support either by number or symbol under Node
label or Node shape, respectively. If shape is used, remember to
add a Legend that explains what the colors and/or size of the
shape mean.
4. Adjust font size of all text to make it easily readable.
5. Decorate the tree for easy analysis: color clades and leaves as
desired.
In our example, we rooted the tree for MSA_ALL_PRO-
TEIN by its choanoﬂagellate outgroup and arranged it in
decreasing node order. SH-like supports are displayed as node
shapes. The tree built on MSA_ALL_DOMAIN was rooted by
midpoint because the sequences from choanoﬂagellates did not
form a monophyletic group. Similarly, the tree built on MSA_-
VERTEBRATE_PROTEIN that does not have an outgroup
sequence was rooted by midpoint root. Choanoﬂagellate
sequence names were colored green, non-vertebrates were col-
ored blue, and vertebrate names were colored gray. The
branches for three vertebrate clades representing p53, p63,
and p73 that formed after gene duplications were colored
pink, red, and blue, respectively, while the non-vertebrate
branches were colored black.
162
Janelle Nunez-Castilla and Jessica Siltberg-Liberles

3.4.3
Tree Analysis
The tree for MSA_ALL_PROTEIN (Fig. 7) is in rather good
agreement with the species tree (Fig. 5). The largest discrepancy
is seen for the cnidarian anemone Nematostella vectensis (NEMVE)
that has three homologs in this phylogeny. These three copies are
likely the result of gene duplication. One of these paralogs is close
Fig. 7 Phylogenetic tree of the full-length sequences. Choanoﬂagellate, invertebrate, and vertebrate sequence
names at the tips are shown in green, blue, and gray, respectively. The vertebrate clade has three separate
subclades: p53 (pink), p73 (blue), and p63 (red). The ﬁlled circle at each node represents SH-like support
colored according to legend (blue is highly supported; red is not supported). The tree was rooted with the
monophyletic choanoﬂagellate clade (that includes all choanoﬂagellate sequences) as outgroup, shown in
decreasing node order and visualized with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ﬁgtree/)

to where it should be based on the species tree; the other two are in
a
clade
with
the
sea
urchin,
Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus
(STRPU), and lancelet, Branchiostoma ﬂoridae (BRAFL), forming
the closest sister clade to vertebrates. To elucidate the evolutionary
history
of
these
sequences
within
invertebrates,
additional
sequences would need to be added. The vertebrate sequences
form a monophyletic clade. The p73 clade is in agreement with
the species tree. The p53 clade is missing sequences from opossum,
Monodelphis domestica (MONDO), and platypus, Ornithorhynchus
anatinus (ORNAN), that are not included in the dataset, and the
sequence from anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis (ANOCA), forms
the outgroup of the clade. It should also be noted that the longer
branches in the p53 clade mean that these sequences are evolving
more rapidly than the sequences in the p73 and p63 clades. The
p63 clade has poor resolution due to its sequences being extremely
conserved. From the SH-like branch support values, we note that
most of the early branches are well supported, while some of the
more recent branches are not. Overall, we judge that these trees are
of acceptable quality for this study, but that may not always be the
case (see Note 14). Sometimes, the initial tree analysis will point us
toward problems in the dataset suggesting that the dataset can be
reﬁned so that the multiple sequence alignment is improved and,
ultimately, a better tree can be built. This can be time-consuming
but can be limited if the dataset is carefully selected from the
beginning of the study.
3.5
Predicting
Disorder
To perform an evolutionary analysis of intrinsic disorder, we need
to predict intrinsic disorder propensity for all sequences in our three
datasets (see Note 15). There are many different predictors avail-
able that are typically based on either a scoring function or a
machine learning approach that utilizes an evolutionary sequence
proﬁle to predict intrinsic disorder based on sequence data alone
(for review, see [29]). In this protocol, we will perform an evolu-
tionary analysis of intrinsic disorder, and it is therefore preferable to
choose a predictor that does not assume that intrinsic disorder is
evolutionarily conserved. Thus, we chose IUPred, a predictor that
infers intrinsic disorder based on a scoring function and not evolu-
tionary proﬁles. For each residue in a protein sequence, the scoring
function for IUPred aims to estimate a pseudo-energy based on the
interaction potential of one residue with its neighboring residues in
the linear sequence context. It is assumed that residues in globular,
foldable protein regions are able to form contacts and that residues
that do not form such contacts have a propensity toward intrinsic
disorder [30, 31]. IUPred-long (the default) is a widely used
predictor with an accuracy in the range of 62–85% [32]. The
IUPred webserver has recently been updated to IUPred2A with
only minor bug ﬁxes to the original IUPred predictor [33], so we
assume that IUPred2A has similar accuracy.
164
Janelle Nunez-Castilla and Jessica Siltberg-Liberles

3.5.1
Intrinsic Disorder
Prediction
The IUPred2A webserver (https://iupred2a.elte.hu/) allows us to
submit an input ﬁle with the unaligned sequences in our datasets.
We simply uploaded the input ﬁle, provided an email address, kept
the default settings, and submitted the job.
It is important that the sequences in the input ﬁle are
unaligned. If gaps are included, IUPred will attempt to generate a
prediction for the gap characters, which is inaccurate. For our
example, we removed all gaps from the three datasets used to
build trees and ran these through IUPred2A. For the second
dataset that has only the part of the sequences that correspond to
the p53 DNA-binding domain, it should be noted that since
IUPred uses a windowing approach, performing the predictions
on partial sequences may slightly alter the results. An alternative
way is to run the prediction on the entire sequence and to only
include the disorder propensities for the residues that are part of the
domain when calculating the percentage of disorder. In this easy
protocol, for dataset 3, disorder is predicted only on the part of the
sequence that corresponds to the p53 DNA-binding domain.
For each residue in the protein, IUPred returns a value between
0 and 1 that reﬂects the disorder propensity for that residue.
IUPred does not automatically calculate the percentage of disorder
for a given sequence. To determine the percentage of disorder in
our sequences, we need to decide which cutoff to use. IUPred was
developed to have a cutoff ¼ 0.5, where residues with disorder
propensities of 0.5 or greater were classiﬁed as unstructured or
intrinsically disordered and residues with disorder propensities
below 0.5 were classiﬁed as ordered. It has been shown that the
accuracy of IUPred may be improved if the cutoff ¼ 0.4 [34].
To parse the output ﬁles from IUPred2A, we used a custom
Python script, iupred_parser.py (see supplementary material for this
chapter). This script maps the predictions from IUPred2A onto the
multiple sequence alignment to generate two matrices: one of
continuous values (0–1) and one of binary values (0 ¼ order,
1 ¼ disorder). The binary values are determined by a user-provided
cutoff value. The binary matrix facilitates the easy analysis of disor-
der conservation at a site in, e.g., Excel. The script also generates
two FASTA ﬁles based on the binary predictions mapped onto the
multiple sequence alignment: one with values 0 and 1 and another
with values K (order) and E (disorder). The latter allows for visuali-
zation of the binary disorder predictions using TreeView from the
ETE Toolkit (http://etetoolkit.org/treeview/; Fig. 8). Finally, the
script provides the percent disorder of each sequence based on the
user-provided cutoff value. We ran the iupred_parser.py script using
a cutoff of 0.4 on the IUPred2A output ﬁles for all three datasets.

Evolutionary
Dynamics of Intrinsic
Disorder
Based on the phylogenies and IUPred2A predictions, different
hypotheses can be tested. In our example, we ﬁrst tested if there
was more disorder in vertebrates than in non-vertebrates for the
entire p53 protein and for only the p53 DNA-binding domain, and
we also compared the amount of disorder in the different vertebrate
clades. To this end, we used Excel on the output ﬁle from iupred_-
parser.py to divide the percentages of disorder into the partitions of
our choice, vertebrates vs non-vertebrates (datasets 1 and 2) and
the p53, p63, and p73 clades (dataset 3). Next, we used Python to
visualize the data for the different partitions as boxplots (Fig. 9)
and Mann-Whitney U tests to test for signiﬁcance (Table 3) (see
Note 16). It must be noted that by simply comparing the distribu-
tion of percent disorder for different partitions, the phylogenetic
structure within the partitions is ignored. The comparisons of
disorder percentage per partition show that there is signiﬁcantly
more disorder in vertebrate p53 proteins than in non-vertebrates,
and the same holds for the p53 DNA-binding domain only. On the
protein level, for the three paralogous vertebrate clades, only the
comparison between p63 and p73 is signiﬁcant, but on the p53
DNA-binding domain level, all comparisons are signiﬁcant.

protein (a) or per p53 DNA binding domain (b) for the non-vertebrate sequences
(non-v) and the vertebrate sequences (v). For the vertebrate sequences, percent
disorder for each paralogous clade (p53, p63, and p73) are shown per protein
(a) and per domain (b). The median percent disorder per dataset is shown in
yellow. This ﬁgure was generated with Matplotlib in Python
Protein Family Analysis of Intrinsic Disorder
167

Next, we used Excel and the matrix output ﬁle (from the
iupred_parser.py script) with the disorder predictions as binary
states to calculate the % disorder per alignment site across the p53
DNA-binding domain since this part of the alignment has fewer
gaps. Disorder percentage was calculated for each alignment site:
Disorder %
ð
Þ ¼
Number of residues predicted to be disordered
Total number of residues þ Gaps


 100
Disorder percentage can also be calculated ignoring gaps. In
that case, otherwise fully gapped sites with one insertion that is
disordered would appear to be 100% conserved in disorder, but this
is misleading. Alternatively, sites with gaps can be excluded from
the analysis. The advantage of excluding gapped sites is that these
tend to be less well aligned [14]. If removing gapped sites, it is
necessary to not remove these regions until after the predictions
have been completed since the IUPred predictions depend on the
sequence context. As we here chose to focus on dataset 2, we
divided the percentages for the sequences in this dataset into a
non-vertebrate partition and into the three vertebrate partitions
based on the three paralogous clades p53, p63, and p73, as shown
in Fig. 6. For each partition, we calculated the site-speciﬁc conser-
vation of intrinsic disorder as shown above. Intrinsic disorder
appears almost completely conserved at most sites for the p63 and
p73 clades but is incrementally less conserved for the p53 clade and
for the non-vertebrates (Fig. 10). However, all four partitions have

Reﬂections
and Future Directions
The protocol presented aims to get the reader ready to start
performing their own evolutionary analysis of intrinsic disorder
across protein families. This easy protocol emphasizes the necessity
of carefully selecting the sequences to be included in the analysis. It
is often beneﬁcial to partition the data in different ways as this
allows for different questions to be asked and answered. Here, we
relied on the information in the multiple sequence alignment and
its corresponding phylogeny to partition the data. Partitions can
also be based on other factors, but if so, it is recommended to also

consider the actual phylogenetic context. This is supposed to be an
easy protocol, and we have tried to make it such. It should be noted
that the analysis above is just the tip of the iceberg of what can be
done. To ignore the complete phylogenetic structure is a simpliﬁ-
cation and not formally correct. Instead, phylogenetic independent
contrast can be used to study how traits like disorder percentage
evolve over a phylogeny [35]. We and others have started to inves-
tigate the site-speciﬁc transition rate between disorder and order on
evolutionary time scales [9, 36–39], and similar analyses can be
performed with phylogenies and output ﬁles from the iupred_par-
ser.py script generated here. It is known that disordered regions can
become structured in response to a change in their environment,
such as a pH decrease, phosphorylation, or binding to another
biomolecule [40], and non-conserved disorder between homolo-
gous sequences will likely affect how they respond to such changes
by
modifying
the
disorder/order
transition
in
real
time
[41]. Therefore, detecting non-conserved disorder can help in
detecting functional divergence [41]. Work that addresses these
questions in silico followed by experimental veriﬁcation will provide
valuable insights to our understanding of how intrinsic disorder in
proteins evolves.

Notes
1. When building a protein family for an unfamiliar protein, our
preference is to gather information about the taxonomic distri-
bution of the protein using NCBI’s BLAST servers and data-
bases. Depending on the question that we are trying to explore,
we may then choose to limit the taxa that we are working with
to only a certain taxonomic grouping (e.g., vertebrates only),
or we may choose to select a few representative species that
encompass the full taxonomic distribution in which our protein
was found, as in the example we discuss.
2. The nr database is the largest database, and although nr stands
for nonredundant, there is a lot of redundancy on the actual
amino acid sequence level in this database. The refseq_protein
database contains better annotated sequences for entire pro-
teomes, and the protein sequences are linked to their
corresponding nucleotide sequences. In March 2019, refseq_-
protein had proteomes from 88,816 species. The landmark
database contains the proteomes from 27 model organisms in
the refseq_protein database. The model organisms consist of
13 bacterial species, 2 archaeal species, and 12 eukaryotes. The
eukaryotes can be further broken down to two plant species,
two yeast species, one amoebozoan, one euglenozoan, one
alveolate, and ﬁve metazoan (two invertebrates and three
170
Janelle Nunez-Castilla and Jessica Siltberg-Liberles

vertebrates). Other protein databases include the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) [42] that contains the protein sequences from the
structures in the PDB and Swiss-Prot/Uniprot [43] that con-
tains manually annotated proteins. These two protein databases
often contain valuable functional information but do not
attempt to contain entire proteomes.
3. A good BLAST hit would have high query coverage, high
sequence identity, and low E-value. However, what to consider
good depends on the objective of your study. E-values depend
on additional factors such as the length of your query and the
size of the database. As sequence databases continue to grow,
additional BLAST hits will result. For additional information
on how to use BLAST properly, please see the Help tab on the
NCBI BLAST server.
4. To decide on which strategy to use for a particular protein, you
need to explore the distribution of its sequence space by using
different BLAST databases or the literature. Some proteins are
ubiquitous to the tree of life, while others are lineage speciﬁc.
Some proteins have many paralogs while others have none.
Some proteins are very long, while others are short. Some
proteins are highly conserved, while others are rapidly evolving.
Depending on your objective, you need to decide which data-
base and which species to include in your study. There are
additional settings that can be modiﬁed in BLAST, and the
speciﬁc information for each is available by a click on its
question mark.
5. Regardless of the database used (Model organism or refseq_-
protein), isoforms will need to be dealt with. A more experi-
enced
bioinformatician,
once
they
have
chosen
their
representative species, may elect to create a custom local
BLAST database using the canonical reference proteomes
from Uniprot [44]. The canonical reference proteomes contain
the canonical isoform for each protein and solve the problem of
which isoform to include. Further, it allows one to compose
their own “Model organism database” based on their needs.
For the purposes of this protocol, however, we will be using
NCBI’s BLAST webservers and databases and will discuss how
we can handle the issue of isoforms when constructing our
dataset.
6. Pfam can assist you in determining which regions of your
protein are important for speciﬁc functions, such as DNA
binding, oligomerization, or catalytic function. Based on
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), it attempts to predict
where in your sequence certain regions correspond to a speciﬁc
protein family (sequence-based evolutionary units) or protein
domain (globular structural units). Pfam families and domains
Protein Family Analysis of Intrinsic Disorder
171

make up 97.2% of this database; for additional classiﬁcations,
see [45]. Pfam protein families do not necessarily cover the full
length of the sequence, and these are slightly different than the
protein families covered in this protocol where all homologous
proteins are considered to be a protein family. The presence of
the same Pfam family or domain in two highly divergent pro-
tein sequences indicates homology (albeit remote homology).
Further, combining the functional annotation from Pfam with
our protein families broadens the scope of our study. We can
study the evolution not only of the full-length proteins but also
of speciﬁc Pfam domains (or Pfam family regions).
7. When selecting which isoform to include in the dataset, we
generally chose the longest protein coded by a particular gene.
On occasion, you may encounter two isoforms that are the
same length. In that event, we recommend making a selection
based on which isoform has the lower E-value. If the E-values
are the same, then we recommend basing the decision on which
isoform has the higher query coverage and/or percent
sequence identity. However, there may be moments when
exceptions to these guidelines may be made. In the case of
p53 for Equus caballus, the two longest isoforms are the same
length, XP_023573921.1 and NP_001189334.1. Both had an
E-value of 0.0 and both had 100% query coverage. They dif-
fered in percent sequence identity to the query, with the former
hit having 82.74% sequence identity and the latter having
82.49% identity. Based on the proposed guidelines for selecting
which isoform to include in the dataset, we would have selected
the hit with the higher percent sequence identity. We chose to
select the experimentally veriﬁed isoform (NP_001189334.1)
over the predicted isoform (XP_023573921.1). Another
exception arose when selecting the representative p73 isoform
for Mus musculus. Here, the longest isoform was a predicted
protein (XP_006538783.2), while an experimentally veriﬁed
protein (NP_035772.3) was the second longest isoform. Both
hits had identical query coverage and percent sequence identity
and nearly identical E-values (5e-84 and 3e-84, respectively).
As with the p53 from Equus caballus, we chose to include the
experimentally veriﬁed isoform as opposed to the predicted
isoform. While this manual curation of the dataset is beneﬁcial
for individual small-scale studies, it is not feasible for large-scale
studies. In all cases, the actual sequence accession numbers for
the ﬁnal sequence sets must be recorded.
8. For instance, Anolis carolinensis has four genes belonging to
the p53 protein family due to a gene duplication in the gene
that codes for p63. If we were selecting the sequences for our
dataset based only on their annotations and the assumption
172
Janelle Nunez-Castilla and Jessica Siltberg-Liberles

that each species has one copy of each paralog, we would
erroneously exclude one of the p63 proteins from our dataset.
9. FASTA format is a text-based way to represent sequence data
using single-letter codes for amino acids or nucleotides. A “>”
symbol distinguishes the sequence identiﬁer (can also be
referred to as a sequence header) from the other lines that
contain actual sequence information. FASTA ﬁles may contain
aligned or unaligned sequences.
Ex.
>SEQUENCE_1
MADTTA-AGLIFYKL
>SEQUENCE_2
MADTT--AGILFYKL
>SEQUENCE_3
MAETTA-AGIIFY-L
>SEQUENCE_4
MAESTAAAGLLFY-L
>SEQUENCE_5
MAESTA-AGLIFY-L
10. There are numerous algorithms for making multiple sequence
alignments. Many of these algorithms are found on the tool
page for multiple sequence alignment from the European Bio-
informatics
Institute
(EBI,
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
msa/). These are also implemented in the alignment viewer
Jalview (http://www.jalview.org/) and can be found under
Web Service, followed by Alignment.
11. When reﬁning the dataset using min–max sequence length
cutoffs, the goal is to remove sequences that are clear outliers
in the dataset based on their length. Sequences with signiﬁcant
length variations introduce more gaps to the alignment which
can affect the quality of the phylogeny that is built based on
that alignment. There is no perfect formula for deciding what
the min–max values should be; it should be decided based on
the goal of the study. For instance, if the goal is to have a
dataset composed of sequences with similar domain composi-
tion that can be easily aligned, the sequences should be kept
more similar in length. When in doubt, we recommend initially
not removing any sequences and using the original multiple
sequence alignment to build a phylogeny. The multiple
sequence alignment and phylogeny can then be inspected in
tandem to better inform whether some sequences are out of
place (compared to the species tree, for example) and ought to
be removed. Reﬁning the dataset is an iterative process. The
researcher can start reﬁning with more generous (i.e., more
inclusive) cutoffs, realigning the remaining sequences after
removing outlier sequences, building the phylogeny, and
Protein Family Analysis of Intrinsic Disorder
173

again determining if more sequences need removal in order to
ensure best quality.
12. The Pfam domain boundaries for the p53 DNA-binding
domain of the human p53 protein were used in order to create
the partitioned dataset based containing only the p53
DNA-binding domain. While this domain across sequences is
expected to be about the same length, we chose to include 10
residues beyond the human domain boundaries in order to be
more inclusive in the event of minor deviation in domain
length across sequences. An alternative approach that requires
a bit more effort would be to cut out the portion of each
sequence that corresponds to the predicted domain boundaries
for that sequence based on Pfam predictions. However, for
simplicity or larger datasets, the approach used here is
adequate.
13. Phylip format is a text-based ﬁle that stores a multiple sequence
alignment (it is not used for unaligned sequences) for proteins
or nucleic acids using single-letter codes. At the top of a phylip
ﬁle, there are two numbers separated by one or more spaces:
the ﬁrst indicates how many sequences are in the alignment,
and the second indicates the length of the alignment. The
headers and alignment follow the ﬁrst line. On the left of the
ﬁle, the sequence headers can be found. In a strict phylip ﬁle,
which tends to be the standard, the header cannot exceed
10 characters. A relaxed phylip ﬁle does not impose length
restrictions on the header. Following the header and on the
same line, the sequence begins, split into groups of 10 charac-
ters separated by a space. Because the entire sequence cannot ﬁt
on one line, all sequences in the alignment continue in the
same order on a separate block as necessary to write out the full
sequence.
Ex.
5 15
SEQUENCE_1 MADTTA-AGL IFYKL
SEQUENCE_2 MADTT--AGI LFYKL
SEQUENCE_3 MAETTA-AGI IFY-L
SEQUENCE_4 MAESTAAAGL LFY-L
SEQUENCE_5 MAESTA-AGL IFY-L
14. If we wanted to sort out more of the evolutionary events in
invertebrates, we could add a few more species, make a new
alignment, and rebuild the tree. Or, we could try to ﬁnd the
missing sequences from opossum, Monodelphis domestica
(MONDO),
and
platypus,
Ornithorhynchus
anatinus
(ORNAN), in a different database, add these to the dataset,
realign, and rebuild the tree.

15. If experimental data is available on which residues in all
sequences in our datasets are intrinsically disordered and
which are ordered, that can be used instead, but that is rarely
the case.
16. To perform tests of signiﬁcance, we used Python 2 with Spyder
in Anaconda2, but we recommend the reader to use their
preferred statistics package such as R or SPSS. To compare
the amount of disorder for two datasets (data1 and data2)
using Spyder, see supplementary material.

Expression and Puriﬁcation of an Intrinsically Disordered
Protein
Karamjeet K. Singh and Steffen P. Graether
Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) describe a group of proteins that do not have a regular tertiary
structure and typically have very little ordered secondary structure. Despite not following the biochemical
dogma of “structure determines function” and “function determines structure,” IDPs have been identiﬁed
as having numerous biological functions. We describe here the steps to express and purify the intrinsically
disordered stress response protein, Late embryogenesis abundant protein 3-2 from Arabidopsis thaliana
(AtLEA 3-2), with 15N and 13C isotopes in E. coli, although the protocol can be adapted for any IDP with
or without isotopic labeling. The atlea 3-2 gene has been cloned into the pET-SUMO vector that in
addition to the SUMO portion encodes an N-terminal hexahistidine sequence (His-tag). This vector allows
for the SUMO-AtLEA 3-2 fusion protein to be puriﬁed using Ni-afﬁnity chromatography and, through the
use of ubiquitin-like-speciﬁc protease 1 (Ulp1, a SUMO protease), results in an AtLEA 3-2 with a native
N-terminus. We also describe the expression and puriﬁcation of Ulp1 itself.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a relatively recently
identiﬁed phenomenon, broadly described as a group of proteins
that contain very little deﬁned 3D structure yet still have important
biological functions [1, 2]. Over 20 years of research have shown
that IDPs have many roles, including transcription [3], cell cycle
control [4], and protection from stress damage [5, 6]. It is esti-
mated that ~20% of proteins encoded by eukaryotic genomes are
disordered [7], yet many IDPs have not been studied in detail [8],
making them attractive targets for characterization. With this inter-
est also comes a need to be able to produce relatively large quan-
tities of protein (milligram scale) for structural studies. While
eukaryotic expression systems have been used to produce recombi-
nant proteins [9, 10], the prokaryotic E. coli system is by far the

most popular, due to its relatively low cost and ease of use
[11]. Though many aspects of IDP puriﬁcation will be similar and
even identical to ordered proteins, this chapter notes some of the
key differences.
We describe here a protocol for the production of an isotopi-
cally labeled, fully disordered protein for detailed NMR experi-
ments using an E. coli recombinant expression system [12]. The
protocol uses a plant stress protein that is studied in our laboratory
as an example, the late embryogenesis abundant 3-2 protein from
Arabidopsis thaliana (AtLEA 3-2, AT3G53770.1). The protein is
fused with a His-tagged SUMO domain that is used as part of the
puriﬁcation process and results in a mature AtLEA 3-2 with a
completely native N-terminal sequence after cleavage using the
protease ubiquitin-like-speciﬁc protease 1 (Ulp1) [13]. Ulp1
recognizes the structure of the SUMO domain rather than just a
cleavage site, allowing for precise removal of this domain, leaving
no residues from a recognition sequence that may interfere with the
residual structure of an IDP or its function.
Because of their inability to crystallize, X-ray crystallography is
not typically used to characterize the structure of highly disordered
proteins. Therefore, characterization of IDPs, such as AtLEA 3-2,
is performed using various biophysical techniques (Fourier-
transform infrared spectroscopy, ﬂuorescence resonance energy
transfer, and circular dichroism [14]), but residue-speciﬁc informa-
tion without mutation or modiﬁcation can only be obtained by
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and in cell, NMR
promises characterization of IDPs in a near-native environment
[15]. Another beneﬁt of NMR is that it is not an “all or nothing”
technique, with intermediate NMR experiments still providing
relevant structural information (e.g., amounts of residual structure,
levels of disorder, and identifying residues involved in ligand
binding).
The protocol presented here pertains to the production of
AtLEA 3-2 in M9 minimal media with 13C-glucose and 15NH4Cl
isotopes for detailed analysis of dynamics and residual structure by
NMR but can be easily adapted to other IDPs and/or for growth in
rich, unlabeled media for other biophysical experiments.

Materials
For buffers and solutions, use water with a resistivity of at least
18.2 MΩ cm, whereas for larger-volume bacterial media prepara-
tions, distilled water can be used. For chemicals, use reagent grade
or higher. Prepare and store all solutions and buffers at 4 C unless
stated otherwise. Bacterial media should be sterilized the day before
use. Sterilization of rich media can be performed using an auto-
clave; sterilization of solutions and minimal media can be
182

performed using a sterile vacuum ﬁlter unit for volumes 100 mL
and a sterile syringe ﬁlter for volumes <100 mL before dispensing
into a sterile container. Disposal of solutions and spent media must
follow
all
local
waste
and

regulations.
IDPs are especially sensitive to proteases, so all protein puriﬁ-
cation steps need to be performed at 4 C either through refrigera-
tion or by keeping samples on ice, unless stated otherwise.

Methods
3.1
Protein
Expression
1. It is assumed that the AtLEA 3-2 gene has already been sub-
cloned into a plasmid to create pET-SUMO-AtLEA 3-2, which
itself has been transformed into competent E. coli BL21(DE3)
cells.
2. Grow the transformed bacteria overnight in a small volume
(5 mL) of LB media with 50 μg/mL kanamycin (5 μL of
stock) at 37 C with shaking at 250 rpm.
3. Transfer 500 μL of the overnight growth per 500 mL of LB
media containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin (500 μL of stock). The
total amount of media used will depend on the amount of
protein required and the protein yield per liter media (see
Note 5).
4. Grow the large-volume media at 37 C until an optical density
at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.8 is achieved.
5. Collect the cells in the LB media by centrifugation (6000  g
for 15 min), and decant the supernatant (i.e., the media).
6. Prepare the labeled M9 media. Add kanamycin to a ﬁnal con-
centration of 50 μg/mL (1 mL per liter of M9 media). Preheat
to 37 C. Immediately before use, add 10 mL of 20% (w/v)
U-13C-glucose per liter of M9 media.
7. Resuspend the cells in the isotope-labeled M9 media. The cells
can be resuspended in ½ or ¼ the volume of M9 media relative
to the LB media to enhance expression efﬁciency [16].
186
Karamjeet K. Singh and Steffen P. Graether

8. Return the cells to the shaker-incubator, and allow the cells to
grow for 1 h at 37 C with 250 rpm shaking to clear unlabeled
metabolites.
9. Induce expression of SUMO-AtLEA 3-2 with IPTG at a ﬁnal
concentration of 0.4 mM. Add 1 mL 0.4 M IPTG per liter of
media. Let expression continue for 16–18 h at 37 C (see
Note 6).
10. Collect cells by centrifugation (6000  g for 15 min) and
decant the supernatant (i.e., the media). At this point, the
cells can be frozen at 20 C and stored.
3.2
Cell Lysis
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of Ni-afﬁnity Binding Buffer
per liter of original LB media in the presence of protease
inhibitor cocktail. We typically use ½ of a tablet of cOmplete™
EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail for 20–30 mL of resus-
pended pellet.
2. Lyse cells by pulse sonication for a total of 5 min, with sonica-
tion on for 30 s and off for 20 s, and power level 7 on a tip
sonicator. Maintain cells on ice throughout the process to
prevent sample heating (see Note 7).
3. Remove cellular debris, unlysed cells, and insoluble proteins by
centrifugation at 48,000  g for 20 min.
4. Decant the supernatant and ﬁlter using a 0.2 μm Whatman™
GD/X syringe ﬁlter or equivalent. Ideally, the cellular superna-
tant should be puriﬁed immediately to separate AtLEA 3-2
protein from bacterial proteases but can be stored overnight
at 4 C if necessary.
3.3
Puriﬁcation
Step 1
1. Prepare the 5 mL Ni-afﬁnity column by washing it with ﬁve
column volumes (CV) of Ni-afﬁnity Binding Buffer. Load the
cellular supernatant onto the column.
2. Wash the column with ﬁve CV of Ni-afﬁnity Binding Buffer or
until the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) returns to baseline.
3. Elute the His6-SUMO-AtLEA 3-2 protein using a linear gradi-
ent of 10 CV between the Ni-afﬁnity Binding Buffer and
Ni-afﬁnity Elution Buffer from 0% to 100% Ni-afﬁnity Elution
Buffer at a ﬂowrate of 2.5 mL/min over 20 min. Monitor A280
to detect elution of the proteins (see Note 8). Collect 1 mL
samples in a fraction collector.
4. Determine which fractions contain the SUMO-AtLEA 3-2
protein by running individual fractions on a Tris-tricine poly-
acrylamide gel using electrophoresis (PAGE) (see Note 9).
5. Prepare the HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column or equivalent by
running one CV of water, followed by one CV of Digestion
Buffer through the column.
Producing Recombinant IDPs
187

6. Desalt the pooled fractions of SUMO-AtLEA 3-2 (load
10 mL sample per run) with the HiPrep 26/10 Desalting
column using the Digestion Buffer as the pumping solution.
Collect the eluted protein in a 50 mL conical tube as a single
fraction. The typical elution volume is 15 mL.
7. Determine the concentration of the AtLEA 3-2. Measure the
A280 of the eluted sample spectrophotometrically (see Note
10). Use the Digestion Buffer as the spectrophotometric
blank. Calculate the protein concentration using the A280 and
the mass concentration extinction coefﬁcient (see Note 11).
8. Adjust the buffer in the SUMO-AtLEA 3-2 sample to contain a
ﬁnal concentration of 10% (v/v) glycerol and 2 mM DTT
(30 μL of 1 M DTT per 15 mL of sample).
9. To obtain nearly complete cleavage (>99%) of SUMO-AtLEA
3-2, add Ulp1 (a SUMO protease) in an enzyme/protein
(w/w) ratio of 1:500. Perform the digestion reaction at
30 C for 1 h before moving to 4 C overnight.
3.4
Puriﬁcation
Step 2
1. Repeat steps 1–4 in Subheading 3.3 to separate cleaved AtLEA
3-2 protein from the His-tagged SUMO domain, uncleaved
SUMO-AtLEA 3-2 protein, and any E. coli proteins that bound
during the ﬁrst puriﬁcation. The cleaved AtLEA 3-2 will be in
the column ﬂowthrough and wash fractions.
2. Collect the ﬂowthrough, and wash as 1 mL fractions and the
elution samples into a 50 mL conical tube using a fraction
collector.
3. Assess which fractions contain AtLEA 3-2 by using a Tris-
tricine PAGE (see Note 9). Pool the fractions.
4. To desalt and remove small contaminants that may not be
visible by PAGE, perform reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC.
5. Add TFA to the sample (0.651 μL/mL sample). Prepare an
analytical-scale C4 or C18 RP-HPLC column as directed by
the manufacturer.
6. Set the ﬂowrate to 1 mL/min, and wash the RP-HPLC column
with two CV of HPLC Buffer B, followed by two CV of HPLC
Buffer A for baseline equilibration.
7. Inject the sample, and elute the protein using a buffer gradient
of 0–100% HPLC Buffer B over 1 h. Monitor A280 to detect
elution of the protein (see Note 8). Collect 1 mL fractions in
glass tubes.
8. Determine which fractions contain the AtLEA 3-2 protein by
running samples using Tris-tricine PAGE. Pool fractions in a

9. To remove the TFA and acetonitrile and prepare the protein for
long-term storage, lyophilization can be used. If lyophilization
is damaging to the protein, then alternative approaches are
needed to remove these compounds [17].

250 rpm.
4. Grow the large-volume media until an OD600 of 1 is reached
(approximately 3–4 h) before transferring the media to a

Let the cells incubate for 3 h.
6. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 6000  g for 30 min.
7. Resuspend the cells in 15 mL of Ulp1 Cell Resuspension

Making
a Tris-Tricine Polya-
crylamide Gel
1. Prepare the separating gel by adding 3.89 mL water, 5 mL
Tricine Gel Buffer, 4.5 mL 40% acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/
bis) (see Note 12), and 2.0 g glycerol in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer
ﬂask. Add 50 μL APS and 15 μL TEMED, and cast gel within a
gel cassette (10 cm  10 cm  2 mm). Allow space for the
stacking layer, and gently overlay the unpolymerized gel solu-
tion with water-saturated isobutanol.
2. Once the separating layer has polymerized, pour off the layer of
isobutanol and rinse the top of the gel with water. Remove
water using a paper towel touched to the edge of the
separating gel.
3. Prepare the stacking layer by adding 3.89 mL water, 1.5 mL
Tricine Gel Buffer, and 0.81 mL acrylamide in a 50 mL beaker.
Add 50 μL APS and 25 μL TEMED. Add the solution to the
top of the separating gel. Gently insert a 10-well comb imme-
diately, taking care not to introduce air bubbles.
4. If gels are not to be used that day, wrap in water-soaked paper
towels, and store at 4 C for up to 5 days.
3.7
Tris-Tricine
Polyacrylamide Gel
Electrophoresis
1. Take a 10 μL aliquot of the sample and add 10 μL of 2 Tris-
Loading Buffer.
2. Heat the samples at 90 C for 10 min.
3. Set up the electrophoresis chamber by locking in the gels
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Add Cathode
Buffer to the upper buffer chamber (negative electrode) and
Anode Buffer to the lower buffer chamber (positive electrode).
4. Load 20 μL of each sample in the wells of the gel.
5. Run the gel at 75 V for 15 min to allow the sample to enter the
separating gel, then 150 V for 1 h. In cases where a higher
resolution of the gel bands is required, lower the second volt-
age to 120 V.

6. Following electrophoresis, pry the gel plates open with a plastic
spatula. The gel will remain on one of the glass plates. Rinse the
gel gently with water, and transfer to a clean plastic container.
7. Add Stain Solution until the gel is submerged. Let the gel sit in
stain for 30 min with gentle shaking.
8. Remove Stain Solution and add Destain Solution until the gel
is submerged. Let the gel sit in destain for 1–2 h with gentle

Notes
1. For cloned genes containing rare codons, E. coli strains such as
Rosetta (DE3) may be a more appropriate choice. In some
cases, the expressed IDPs are insoluble and may end up in
inclusion bodies, and other vectors with different tags may be
needed [12].
2. Bafﬂed ﬂasks ensure that bacteria are sufﬁciently aerated. An
alternative to purchasing bafﬂed ﬂasks is to use Erlenmeyer
ﬂasks and have them modiﬁed by a glass-blowing shop.
3. The amount of glucose for optimal protein expression should
be ﬁrst determined using unlabeled glucose. In cases where
only 15N labeling is required, the amount of glucose added to
the media can be doubled to 4 g glucose per liter M9.
4. To avoid potential degradation from heating and sample loss
during the autoclave process, it is advised to sterilize glucose
using a syringe ﬁlter.
5. Several of the growth and expression parameters (induction cell
density, induction temperature, induction time, IPTG concen-
tration, glucose concentration) may need to be optimized for
other IDP expression systems. For test cultures to optimize
expression, 50 mL of media in 250 mL shaker ﬂasks are recom-
mended, since in our experience 5 mL of media in test tubes
does not faithfully reproduce the aeration conditions and bulk
volume in a shaker ﬂask.
6. Most IDPs will have optimal expression levels 3–4 h after
induction.
7. If the protein is completely disordered or the tag does not
encode a structured domain, an alternative approach is to boil
cells for 20 min to lyse them and cause E. coli host proteins to
aggregate [18, 19].
8. IDPs not containing tryptophan or tyrosine residues will not
absorb appreciably at 280 nm. Alternatively, absorbance at
214 nm can be monitored to detect the peptide bond, but
nonprotein organic molecules will also contribute to the
absorbance.
9. Tris-tricine gels are better for separating proteins <40 kDa in
size. For larger proteins, a Laemmli gel system can be
used [20].
10. A ~10-fold dilution may be needed to bring the sample into the
linear range of the spectrophotometer.
11. The molar extinction coefﬁcient can be estimated using the
protein sequence and an online tool (e.g., ExPASy Prot-
Param—https://web.expasy.org/protparam/)
and
then
192

converted to the mass concentration extinction coefﬁcient by
dividing by the molecular weight of the protein.
12. Unpolymerized acrylamide is a neurotoxin and should only be
handled while wearing appropriate protective gear. Care
should be taken with polymerized acrylamide, since the unpo-
lymerized form may still be present in small amounts.
13. The large hydrodynamic radius and unusual amino acid com-
position of IDPs often cause them to migrate at an unexpected
molecular weight (MW). Usually, this apparent MW is much
larger than its chemical MW. Likewise, the unusual amino acid
composition may result in weaker straining. We found that for
some IDPs, leaving the gel in water overnight results in darker
bands.

Production of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
for Biophysical Studies: Tips and Tricks

and Katrine Bugge
Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have no single, ﬁxed tertiary structure, yet they take on many vital
functions in biology. In recent years, considerable effort has been put into the structural characterization of
their conformational ensembles, to understand the link between the transient, short- and long-range
organizations of IDPs and their functions. Such biophysical studies require substantial amounts of pure
protein, representing a major bottleneck in the studies of IDPs. However, the unique physicochemical
properties resulting from their compositional bias may be exploited for simple yet effective puriﬁcation
strategies. In this chapter, we provide tips and tricks for IDP production and describe the most important
analyses to carry out before bringing an IDP of interest to the laboratory. We outline four puriﬁcation
protocols utilizing the unique properties of IDPs as well as some commonly encountered challenges and
pitfalls.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a class of proteins that
are functional without having a single, well-deﬁned tertiary struc-
ture [1]. They take on a heterogeneous ensemble of dynamically
interconverting conformations [2] and may even remain disordered
in
complexes
or
fold
upon
binding
to
different
degrees
[3, 4]. Genome-wide analyses have predicted that protein disorder
is highly prevalent with 33% of eukaryotic proteins having disor-
dered regions longer than 30 residues [5]. This abundance of
disorder may be explained by disordered regions possessing a

functional advantage, which is selected for through evolution.
These advantages include engaging in multivalent interactions,
enrichment in posttranslational modiﬁcation sites, and a capability
of rapidly sampling an ensemble of conformational states [6]. This
is in accordance with the central role of IDPs in cell cycle control,
gene regulation, and signaling pathways, where their dynamic
nature allows them to interact with multiple partners for tight
regulation [7, 8].
Although IDPs do not have ﬁxed tertiary structures, they are
not adequately described as simple statistical coil chains equally
populating all possible conformations. On the contrary, it has
become clear that IDPs display varying degrees of compaction
and exhibit transient, short- and long-range structural organiza-
tions [4]. To describe the structural ensembles of these functionally
versatile proteins, rigorous biophysical characterization is necessary,
for which substantial amounts of highly pure protein are often
needed. Furthermore, one of the most powerful techniques for
characterizing the dynamic properties of IDPs is NMR spectros-
copy [9–11], which most often requires isotope labeling of the
target in E. coli. Expression and isotope labeling in yeast or using
cell-free systems may be advantageous in some cases, e.g., for
expressing proteins with posttranslational modiﬁcations [12] or
toxic proteins [13], but poses a different set of challenges. As for
folded proteins, some IDPs can be puriﬁed using standard puriﬁca-
tion methods such as afﬁnity-tag-based techniques and size-
exclusion chromatography. However, the unique properties of
IDPs and their low endogenous expression in E. coli [5] may be
exploited for simple yet effective puriﬁcation strategies. At the same
time, these properties pose speciﬁc challenges that need to be taken
into consideration. Here, we point out potential pitfalls speciﬁc for
IDPs and outline puriﬁcation protocols of special interest.
1.1
Considerations
to Keep in Mind Before
Going to the
Laboratory
As is often the case, frustrations and wasted time in the laboratory
can be avoided by careful consideration and design of your experi-
ments—this is also the case in the production of IDPs. Hence, it is
recommended to start by analyzing the primary structure of the
IDP of interest and take careful note of what you ﬁnd in your design
and experimental setup. Deduction of the overall physicochemical
properties inferable from the primary structure may be of great
value for designing an efﬁcient puriﬁcation protocol as well as
preventing potential pitfalls. Some of the most essential considera-
tions based on sequence properties are described below.
1.1.1
Length of Primary
Structure
As previously mentioned, NMR spectroscopy is an extremely pow-
erful technique for structural and dynamical analyses of IDPs.
However, due to their narrow peak dispersion, it may be advanta-
geous to divide the sequence of long IDPs into fragments of less
than ~150 residues with a 5–20 residue overlap. Optimally, the
196
Christian Parsbæk Pedersen et al.

fragments should be designed to prevent disruption of structural
elements, binding sites, and domains. If there is no prior knowledge
of these features, sequence analysis by various web prediction tools
is recommended. For example, intrinsically disordered (ID) regions
can be localized using one of the many disorder predictors [14],
while ID domains can be identiﬁed using IDDomainSpotter [15],
and the position of transient helical elements can be predicted
using, e.g., AGADIR [16]. Additionally, short linear motifs
(SLiMs) and molecular recognition features (MoRFs) can be
inferred from sequence conservation analysis or predicted using
the eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) resource [17] and MoRFpred
[18], respectively.
1.1.2
Amino Acid
Composition
Having decided on the stretch of residues making up each con-
struct, one should take a closer look at the details of the amino acid
composition. Relative to folded proteins, IDPs are signiﬁcantly
depleted in the order-promoting hydrophobic and aromatic resi-
dues (F, Y, W, I, L, V, and C), which typically constitute the
hydrophobic core of globular proteins. On the other hand, they
are signiﬁcantly enriched in disorder-promoting residues, which are
typically charged and polar (Q, G, S, K, R, E, and P) [14, 15]. The
speciﬁc physicochemical properties resulting from this characteris-
tic amino acid composition may readily be utilized for tailored
puriﬁcation
protocols
but
importantly
also
impose
speciﬁc
considerations for construct design.
First, due to the low content of aromatic residues, the molar
extinction coefﬁcient at 280 nm is typically very low or even absent.
This can make protein concentration determination difﬁcult, which
often leads to the concentration of IDPs being misestimated to an
extent that considerably perturbs the results of biophysical charac-
terizations [19]. Alternatively, one can measure the concentration
using a refractometer [11], colorimetric assays (e.g., BCA assay
[20]), or the absorbance at 205 nm [21] or 214 nm [22]. However,
the compositional bias of IDPs also affects binding of the dyes used
for many colorimetric assays, with, for example, Bradford assays
underestimating
IDP
concentrations
by
63%
on
average
[19]. Another solution is introduction of aromatic residues in the
sequence, which nonetheless requires careful consideration (e.g.,
secondary structure predictions) and additional experiments to rule
out perturbations. Another particular amino acid to be aware of is
cysteine. When present in the sequence, it is often necessary to
work under reducing conditions throughout the puriﬁcation. If
this is incompatible with subsequent biophysical techniques or
labeling procedures, these may be substituted with, for example,
serines. Lastly, before ﬁnalizing the construct, it should also be
considered that the speciﬁc amino acid composition of IDPs often
results in a high degree of rare codons. These include codons for
Production of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
197

arginine (AGG, AGA, CGG, CGA) and proline (CCC) in E. coli,
which may compromise high expression yields [23]. To circumvent
this, codon optimization of the DNA sequence can be useful, and
since many DNA synthesis companies include codon optimization
in their services, it is also a fast-forward optimization step (see Note
1). Alternatively, commercially available E. coli strains with higher
expression of rare tRNAs, such as CodonPlus or Rosetta strains,
may be useful (see Note 2).
1.1.3
Preventing
Unwanted Degradation
In the design of expression and puriﬁcation protocols for IDPs, it
should be taken into consideration that they are highly susceptible
to degradation by proteases due to their disordered nature. To
reduce protease degradation during initial puriﬁcation steps, com-
mercially available protease inhibitor cocktails, phenylmethylsulfo-
nyl ﬂuoride (PMSF), and/or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) can be added to the sample. Furthermore, working at
low temperatures also contributes to the reduction of protease
activity. Alternatively, since IDPs do not need refolding following
denaturation, another strategy is unfolding endogenous proteases
by adding chemical denaturants such as urea or guanidine during
lysis or the initial puriﬁcation steps. Finally, if designing a puriﬁca-
tion strategy employing cleavage with a speciﬁc protease, remember
to check the sequence for protease recognition motifs as well as
secondary sites.
In the following sections, we will provide detailed descriptions
of puriﬁcation protocols that have been used as advantageous steps
in puriﬁcation strategies of speciﬁc IDPs.

IDPs, while charged and hydrophilic residues are generally over-
represented. As will be described in this section, these features can
be exploited to develop puriﬁcation strategies for IDPs.
3.1.1
Puriﬁcation by Heat
Treatment
The hydrophobic core of folded proteins is held together by
numerous intramolecular interactions between its constituent resi-
dues, sequestered away from the polar solvent. When this state is
perturbed by, for example, heating the protein, the hydrophobic
patches buried inside the protein become exposed and may engage
in detrimental inter- and intramolecular contacts, leading to aggre-
gation [24–26]. IDPs on the other hand often remain in solution
upon heating as a result of their high content of charged and polar
residues; hence, selective heat denaturation has been demonstrated
to be a valuable crude puriﬁcation strategy for IDPs [27, 28]. Fur-
thermore, if the protein of interest is prone to degradation post-cell
lysis, it can be advantageous to combine lysis and heat denaturation
in one step to denature endogenous proteases [26].
The effectiveness of a heat treatment step has been exempliﬁed
in the puriﬁcation of the ID region from the A. thaliana transcrip-
tion factor ANAC046, termed ANAC046C. This 18 kDa domain
was expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal 6xHis-SUMO

and

ANAC046C was further puriﬁed by immobilized metal afﬁnity
chromatography, isoelectric precipitation (as described in Subhead-
ing 3.1.2), and a ﬁnal size-exclusion chromatography step (Fig. 1a).
The following protocol for the puriﬁcation of IDPs by heat dena-
turation is rooted in the example of ANAC046C. The reader is
therefore advised to take the necessary precautions before proceed-
ing with the heat treatment of protein samples (see Notes 5 and 6)
and tailor the protocol as much as possible to the protein in
question:
1. Turn on the heating block and set the temperature to 72 C (see
Note 6).

a spin ﬁlter (6). The cleaved ANAC046C is then subjected to isoelectric precipitation, forming a white pellet (7),
which is resuspended (8) and applied onto a size-exclusion chromatography column (9). (b) SDS-PAGE of the

2. Aliquot the sample containing the protein of interest in Eppen-
dorf tubes.
3. Place the aliquots on the heating block for 30 min.
4. Incubate the heat-treated samples on ice for 10 min.
5. Centrifuge the samples for 10 min at 20,000  g (at 4 C) to
pellet the precipitated proteins.
6. Collect the supernatant and pellet and analyze both by
SDS-PAGE (see Notes 7 and 8 and the example in Fig. 1b).
7. If the protein of interest is in the supernatant, proceed with this
to the next puriﬁcation step.
3.1.2
Isoelectric
Precipitation
In this subsection, a somewhat unusual puriﬁcation strategy for
IDPs is described. This method relies on the selective precipitation
of IDPs with TFA. As stated, IDPs tend to have high net charges
and low mean hydrophobicity. Consequently, IDPs with a similar
net charge will generally experience electrostatic repulsion under
physiological conditions, while hydrophobic interactions (if any)
are unable to counteract this effect [29, 30]. On the other hand, at
their isoelectric point (pI), the net charge of proteins is zero, and
the electrostatic interactions exhibited by proteins with similar
physicochemical properties cease to have a considerable effect.
Under such circumstances, hydrophobic interactions become
more favorable, and the likelihood of protein precipitation increases
[31]. Isoelectric precipitation is usually not employed to precipitate
the target protein, but it can in some cases turn out to be a useful
puriﬁcation trick for IDPs, as will be described here using the
previously introduced ANAC046C as an example.
With a predicted pI of 4.7, the (untagged) ANAC046C imme-
diately precipitates when mixed with the strong acid TFA. The
protein can effectively be recovered from the precipitate, demon-
strating the applicability of this puriﬁcation method for acidic as
well as for basic IDPs [32]. In this speciﬁc case, the result of this
step is the elimination of folded contaminant proteins and, more
importantly, a signiﬁcant decrease in the amount of presumed
ANAC046C truncates in the sample (Fig. 1c). The latter may be
the consequence of the truncated proteins having different physi-
cochemical properties than the full-length protein. In essence,
isoelectric precipitation of IDPs with a low (or high) pI can be a
fruitful puriﬁcation step when ﬁne-tuned to the target protein (see
Notes 9 and 10). Here, we present a general protocol for this
purpose:
1. 990 μL aliquots of a protein sample (see Note 9) are distributed
in Eppendorf tubes.
2. Add 10 μL 100% (v/v) TFA to achieve a ﬁnal acid concentra-
tion of 1% (v/v).

3. Invert the samples several times (e.g., six times) before incuba-
tion on ice for 30 min.
4. Centrifuge the samples for 15 min at 20,000  g (at 4 C) to
pellet the target of interest.
5. Carefully separate the supernatant from the precipitate, and
resuspend the pellet in 990 μL resuspension buffer. The pre-
cipitated protein should get redissolved relatively quickly by
pipetting up and down several times, provided that the resus-
pension buffer is optimal for the protein in question (see Note
10).
6. Centrifuge the samples for 15 min at 20,000  g (at 4 C) and
collect the supernatant.
7. Optional: Repeat steps 2–6 for a second precipitation round to
increase the purity of the sample.
8. Evaluate pellet and supernatant by SDS-PAGE (see Notes 7
and 8 and example in Fig. 1c).
9. Carry out a buffer-exchange step to remove traces of TFA,
either by dialyzing the sample or by applying it onto a size-
exclusion chromatography column (see Note 11).
3.2
Chroma-
tography-Based
Approaches
Several chromatography-based approaches have proven highly efﬁ-
cient and useful for puriﬁcation of IDPs. Ion-exchange and
reversed-phase chromatography are particularly well suited. These
techniques take advantage of either the extreme pI or the lack of a
folded structure and have proven efﬁcient in solving some of the
more speciﬁc challenges when purifying IDPs, such as the presence
of degradation products.
3.2.1
Ion-Exchange
Chromatography
One typical characteristic of IDPs is a high net charge, making them
ideal candidates for puriﬁcation by ion-exchange chromatography.
The principle behind ion-exchange chromatography is the interac-
tion of proteins with the oppositely charged resin, thereby separat-
ing the proteins based on charge. To selectively elute bound
proteins, the interaction between the protein and the column
material is typically perturbed by a salt or pH gradient. An
ion-exchange puriﬁcation step can be applied early in the puriﬁca-
tion procedure to capture and separate the protein of interest from
most of the proteins present in the lysate as in the puriﬁcation
protocols
of
the
disordered
proteins
amyloid-β
[33]
and
α-synuclein [34]. Depending on the purity of the sample before
ion-exchange chromatography, be aware of the selectivity, resolu-
tion, and purposes of the different ion-exchange columns. Typi-
cally, columns such as HiTrap Q FF and SP FF are ideal for
capturing the protein from the cleared lysate, while columns such
as Mono Q and Mono S are better suited for high-resolution
polishing steps due to the smaller bead size of the resin.
202
Christian Parsbæk Pedersen et al.

In the protocol presented here, the disordered steroid receptor
coactivator-3 (ACTR) is puriﬁed using a HiTrap Q FF anion-
exchange column in the ﬁrst step of puriﬁcation followed by a
reversed-phase chromatography step. The theoretical pI of ACTR
is 4.2, making this puriﬁcation step extremely effective. ACTR is
co-expressed with its ligand NCBD to increase its lifetime in E. coli
(see Note 2). To make sure the two proteins are separated, 6 M urea
is added to the buffers; however, this condition may not be neces-
sary for puriﬁcation of all IDPs:
1. Equilibrate the HiTrap Q FF column using two column
volumes of buffer A.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 20,000  g for 10 min to remove any
precipitated protein.
3. Apply the sample to the column.
4. Wash the column using ﬁve column volumes of buffer A.
5. Elute using a linear gradient from 0% to 40% buffer B over ﬁve
column volumes (see Fig. 2a).
6. Analyze fractions by SDS-PAGE, and pool the fractions con-
taining the protein of interest (see Notes 7, 8, and 12).
3.2.2
Reversed-Phase
Chromatography
Like ion-exchange chromatography, reversed-phase chromatogra-
phy is an extremely useful technique for puriﬁcation of IDPs and
has, for example, been used in the two-step puriﬁcations of p27
[35] and Sml1 [36]. The main advantage of the technique is its
ability to separate proteins with highly similar properties, for exam-
ple, allowing separation of an IDP from its degradation products,
based on their hydrophobicity. Since this technique often requires
low pH, globular proteins may acid denature and need to be
refolded after puriﬁcation. Reversed-phase chromatography can
therefore be problematic for globular proteins but is useful when
purifying IDPs. In this chromatographic technique, the stationary
phase is nonpolar, while the mobile phase is more polar. Polar
buffers, such as aqueous buffers, are used as binding buffers,
while more nonpolar buffers are used as elution buffers. Further-
more, the pH of the sample and buffer is often lowered using TFA
as an ion-pairing reagent to increase resolution.
In the protocol presented here, reversed-phase chromatogra-
phy is used as the last step in the puriﬁcation of the disordered
intracellular domain of the growth hormone receptor (GHR-ICD).
Prior to this step, the GST-tagged protein was puriﬁed using a GST
column, followed by thrombin cleavage to release the tag.
Reversed-phase chromatography was used to remove not only the
GST-tag but also secondary degradation products from the cleav-
age, which were not removable by any other method tested. In this
particular protocol, a C18 stationary phase was used to increase
retention of the relatively hydrophilic protein. However, as this is a

typical IDP property, this column may be relevant to use in most
IDP puriﬁcations:
1. Add TFA to the sample to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1% (v/v).
2. Centrifuge the sample at 20,000  g for 10 min to remove
precipitated protein before applying the sample to the column
equilibrated in two column volumes of buffer A.
3. Since the main impurities elute very close to the protein of
interest, this protein is eluted over three steps of linear gradi-
ents from 0% to 50% buffer B over four column volumes,
50–70% over three column volumes, and 70–100% over three
column volumes (see Fig. 2b). If the elution proﬁle is not
known, one can start by eluting protein using a linear gradient
from 0% to 100% elution buffer over ten column volumes.

4. Analyze fractions by SDS-PAGE and pool the fractions con-
taining the protein of interest.
5. To evaporate organic substances, freeze-dry the pooled frac-
tions once or twice (see Note 13), and resuspend the protein in
a buffer of choice.

Notes
1. While codon optimization is advantageous for increasing the
translation rate, this may at the same time compromise correct
folding of, e.g., a folded puriﬁcation tag [37]. Thus, if the
construct includes any folded elements, be aware that the
presence of rare codons may actually be beneﬁcial for correct
folding.
2. If the expression of the IDP results in a low yield, it may be
advantageous to include an expression tag such as SUMO to
the construct [38]. Not only does this tag increase solubility,
but its speciﬁc protease recognizes the tertiary structure of the
whole domain and not just a small linear sequence, which
decreases the risk of unspeciﬁc cleavage. Other methods
include co-expression of the IDP with an interaction partner
to decrease proteolysis [39] or changing E. coli expression
strains to, for example, C43(DE3) if the IDP is toxic for the
host cell [40] or Rosetta™(DE3) for increased expression of
constructs with rare codons.
3. Be aware that since urea is hygroscopic, the ﬁnal urea concen-
tration may be considerably different than expected. Therefore,
one can calculate the ﬁnal molarity of urea in the buffer from
the difference in the refractive index of the buffer with and
without urea. An online tool (http://sosnick.uchicago.edu/
gdmcl.html) is available for this purpose.
4. Acetonitrile is ﬂammable, volatile, and toxic, and safety sheets
should always be consulted before you start working with this
chemical. Methanol (MeOH) is a widely applied alternative to
acetonitrile, being cheaper and less toxic [41]. Nonetheless,
MeOH is considered hazardous, and if possible, ethanol
(EtOH) is a safer alternative, being less toxic, having lower
vapor
pressure,
and
being
more
easily
biodegradable
[41]. However, both MeOH and EtOH have a higher UV
cutoff than acetonitrile (205 nm and 210 nm, respectively,
versus 190 nm) and higher viscosities (EtOH higher than
MeOH) in water mixtures, generating higher back pressures
on the columns [41].

5. IDPs are generally expected to be heat stable. It is, however,
advised to make a small-scale test heat denaturation of the
protein before initiating a large-scale puriﬁcation step.
6. As noted by Kalthoff and others [25–27], heating a protein
sample might chemically alter amino acid residues in the pro-
tein, such as deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues
[42]. This reaction is temperature-dependent and may be mini-
mized by carrying out the procedure at a lower temperature
[43] such as 72 C, rather than boiling the sample. A sample
quality check is highly recommended after a heat treatment
step (see Note 7).
7. Always check the identity and purity of the protein ideally by a
combination of SDS-PAGE (crude purity and identity), mass
spectrometry
(identity),
reversed-phase
chromatography
(purity), and/or NMR spectroscopy (identity and purity).
Native PAGE, isoelectric focusing (IEF) gels, or NMR spec-
troscopy may reveal the presence of chemical modiﬁcations
such as deamidation.
8. It is commonly known that IDPs show anomalous mobility on
SDS-PAGEs due to the reduced binding of SDS compared to
globular proteins [44]. Since globular proteins are used in
standard molecular weight markers, the apparent molecular
mass of IDPs will often be larger than the molecular mass
calculated from the sequence or determined by other techni-
ques such as mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the unusual
amino acid composition of IDPs often results in weaker Coo-
massie staining than for most globular proteins. If the IDP is
prone to diffusion during staining, one may ﬁxate the protein
by incubating the gel in 10% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 30 min
and washing ﬁve times with MQ prior to the normal staining
procedure.
9. To increase the efﬁciency of the isoelectric precipitation proce-
dure, start by an initial screen of the optimal protein concen-
tration to use (here, 300 μM ANAC046C) and the lowest
percentage of TFA at which maximum target protein precipita-
tion is achieved. However, this acid may not be suitable for all
IDPs as it can, in some cases, cleave the protein of interest [45].
10. It is of paramount importance to test the reversibility of the
precipitation step before adding TFA to the whole protein
batch. To this end, designing an optimal resuspension buffer
is a critical step. Several characteristics should be taken into
account, such as the pH of the buffer, salt concentration, the
presence of solubilizing agents [46], and the temperature at
which the procedure is carried out. For example, changing the
pH of the resuspension buffer for ANAC046C from 7.0 to 8.0
had a considerable effect on the solubility of the protein.
206
Christian Parsbæk Pedersen et al.

Additionally, keeping the buffer salt-free also facilitated the
solubilization process.
11. The larger hydrodynamic radius of IDPs [1] results in a
decreased retention volume on a size-exclusion column com-
pared to globular proteins of similar molecular weight. Hence,
a column with a separation range optimized for a higher molec-
ular weight may therefore be advantageous to use.
12. If the protein of interest is present in the ﬂowthrough from
ion-exchange chromatography, be aware that this may be due
to binding to oppositely charged proteins or DNA. The pres-
ence of DNA in the sample may be detected by the ratio
between UV absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm, which sug-
gests presence of DNA if it exceeds 0.57 [47]. If DNA is
binding to your protein, a heparin column, which separates
proteins based on DNA-binding properties and charge, is
recommended.
13. Trace amounts of TFA may still be present in the sample after
freeze-drying. Therefore, it is recommended to freeze-dry the
sample more than once and to check the pH after resuspension
in the buffer of choice. Similarly, be aware that only volatile
buffer components evaporate when freeze-drying, which
means that nonvolatile buffer components, such as NaCl,
may be concentrated upon resuspension, and hence should
be removed by buffer exchange.

Recombinant Production of Monomeric Isotope-Enriched
Aggregation-Prone Peptides: Polyglutamine Tracts
and Beyond
Albert Escobedo, Giulio Chiesa, and Xavier Salvatella
Abstract
High solvent exposure of certain sequences located in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) may eventu-
ally lead to aggregation, as is the case for some low-complexity regions (LCRs) and short linear motifs
(SLiMs). In particular, polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts are LCRs of variable length highly enriched in
glutamine residues. They are common in transcription factors, and their length can have an impact on
transcriptional activity. In nine proteins, polyQ tract expansions beyond speciﬁc thresholds cause nine
neurodegenerative diseases, and aggregates formed by the protein harboring the polyQ tract can be
detected in affected individuals. A structural characterization of polyQ proteins in their monomeric form
is key to understand how their expansion can affect their aggregation propensity. In this regard, nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can provide high-resolution structural information. Here, we
present a protocol to prepare monomeric samples of isotope-enriched short helical polyQ peptides based on
the sequence of the androgen receptor (AR) suitable for NMR characterization and suggest different ways
to adapt it for the production and monomerization of other relatively short IDR sequences and SLiMs.

Introduction
Aggregates of proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions
(IDRs) have been linked to several neurodegenerative proteinopa-
thies such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Huntington’s disease. As a result of the
lack of a tertiary fold, sequences with propensity to oligomerize
(including regions of low sequence complexity (LCRs)) and/or
mediating protein-protein interactions such as short linear motifs
(SLiMs) are highly solvent-exposed. The biophysical characteriza-
tion of such sequence segments and the interactions they are
involved in is therefore crucial to understand their role in disease.

Polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts are aggregation-prone LCRs
located in IDRs of over 150 human proteins, most of them
involved in transcriptional regulation. Even though their biological
function is still unclear, they tend to be positioned after sequence
regions with a tendency to fold into coiled coils and have been
proposed to participate in protein-protein interactions through
their ability to propagate helicity [1, 2]. Moreover, recent evidence
has shown that polyQ tracts may play a key role in liquid-liquid
phase separation (LLPS) of certain proteins and physiologically
relevant peptides, such as Huntingtin exon 1 [3, 4] or Whi3 [5].
Aggregates of polyQ tract-containing proteins have been found
in patients of nine human neurodegenerative diseases, with a differ-
ent protein associated to each particular disease [6]. In all cases, the
number of Gln residues in the tract is higher than that found in the
average population, surpassing a threshold that is unique for each
disease. Taking the androgen receptor (AR) as an example, whereas
the average number of Gln residues in its polyQ tract is 20–21,
individuals whose AR polyQ tract has 37 or more Gln residues are
likely to develop spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, also known
as Kennedy’s disease) [7, 8]. In the particular case of AR, which is
frequently mutated in prostate cancer, the onset age and severity of
the disease correlate with polyQ tract length [9, 10]. The aggrega-
tion mechanisms and conformational/associational changes corre-
lated with polyQ expansion that trigger them have in the last
decades been a matter of intense debate and research. They involve
the formation of oligomers and, potentially, condensates that prog-
ress into aggregates of ﬁbrillar nature [3, 4, 11, 12].
Access to information on the biophysical and structural deter-
minants of the polyQ aggregation process relies on our ability to
generate monomeric samples. In kinetic measurements of aggrega-
tion, only samples that are monomeric at time zero yield accurate
reproducible results [13]. While valuable structural insights have
been reported based on single-molecule Fo¨rster resonance energy
transfer (FRET) [12] and circular dichroism (CD) studies, nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is uniquely suited for
providing detailed and accurate measurements of the subtle
changes that appear to differentiate functional and disease-prone
polyQ protein variants at the molecular level. However, the intrin-
sic low chemical shift dispersion found in IDRs combined with the
highly repetitive nature of polyQ tracts often leads to signal overlap,
thus posing substantial difﬁculties in the use of NMR for polyQ
tract investigations.
Different strategies have been applied to overcome such chal-
lenge, including the use of higher spectral dimensionality, carbon-
detected experiments [13, 14], and the conception of a site-speciﬁc
labeling strategy [15], as well as the use of short yet aggregating
polyQ peptides [16]. In the case of the polyQ tract of AR, we
reported that its N-terminal ﬂanking region induces high helicity
212
Albert Escobedo et al.

that is propagated along the tract with decreasing efﬁciency. The
slight changes in the chemical microenvironment of every Gln
residue yield sufﬁciently resolved NMR resonances for detailed
studies [13]. In order to further reduce signal overlap and gain
higher information detail, we designed shorter peptides that mimic
this helix-nucleating effect and revealed that side-chain to main-
chain hydrogen bonds from glutamine at relative position i to the
residue at relative position i—4 are a unique structural feature
stabilizing the polyQ helical fold [17].
Similar to the case of other relatively short, exposed, and
aggregation-prone sequences such as some SLiMs and other
LCRs, the recombinant production of isotope-enriched polyQ
tract peptides suitable for NMR characterization is often hampered
by protease degradation together with low production yields and
solubility. Here, we present our protocol to generate uniformly
isotope-enriched samples of AR polyQ tract peptides in a mono-
meric state. Production relies on the recombinant expression of a
His6-Sumo-Qn fusion construct that is enzymatically processed to
yield the isolated polyQ (Qn) peptides. This enables the generation
of high amounts of peptides without any undesired amino acid
addition. Samples are disaggregated and monomerized prior to
data acquisition using a strategy combining elements of the proto-
cols developed at the Linse [18] and Wetzel [19, 20] labs. We
provide insights on how to adapt our method to the production
of similar peptides and proteins, including relatively short IDR
fragments (20–50 residues) as well as SLiMs.

Methods
3.1
Transformation
of E. coli Competent
Cells
1. Thaw an aliquot of Rosetta(DE3)pLysS E. coli competent cells
on ice (see Note 3). Add 50 to 100 ng of the His6-Sumo-Qn
pDEST17 vector dissolved in nuclease-free water or miniprep
elution buffer (up to 10% v/v). Solution homogenization and
tube transfer (if needed) require gentle pipetting to avoid cell
damage. Do not vortex.
2. Let the mixture stand on ice for 20 min to allow DNA adsorp-
tion on the cell surface. Perform a heat shock using a preheated
thermoblock at 42 C for 45 s. Exceed neither temperature nor
time to avoid cell damage. Immediately after the heat shock,
put your tubes on ice for 2 min.
3. Add 300 μL of antibiotic-free SOC medium (see Note 5).
Remember to open the medium stock container under sterile
conditions to avoid contamination. Grow the cells for 1 h at
37 C in a thermoblock with 600 rpm agitation. This will
prevent cell sedimentation while being gentle enough to
avoid cell damage.
4. Under
sterile
conditions,
plate
the
cells
on
antibiotic-
supplemented (ampicillin and chloramphenicol) LB agar (see
Note 6). Pipette your transformed culture on the center of the
plate, and then use a sterile spreader to homogeneously expand
it across the surface. Let the plate stand lid open until the liquid
layer dries out (typically 20 min). Incubate it upside down
overnight at 37 C.
3.2
Expression
of the His6-Sumo-Qn
Fusion Construct
in Isotope-Enriched
Minimal Medium
1. Grow a saturated pre-culture to seed the expression culture (see
Note 7). Prepare 50 mL of antibiotic-supplemented LB per
liter of expression culture to be grown (see Note 8). Fill the
Erlenmeyer conical ﬂasks up to 1/5th of their capacity for
optimal growth. Using a sterilized pipette tip, carefully wipe
one single colony from your transformation LB agar plate, and
dispense it in the freshly prepared LB medium. Grow the
pre-culture overnight at 37 C with 220 rpm agitation.
2. Prepare fresh M9 minimal medium for the expression culture
on the same day it is going to be grown (see Note 9). Mix the
components listed in Table 3 to prepare 1 L of M9 medium (see
Notes 10 and 11).
3. Divide the pre-culture in 50 mL Falcon tubes, and centrifuge
them at 3000  g for 20 min at 4 C or room temperature.
Discard the pre-culture supernatant. Gently resuspend each
pre-culture pellet in 1 L of M9 minimal medium using a soft
Pasteur pipette. Avoid harsh pipetting to prevent cell damage.
218
Albert Escobedo et al.

4. Grow the culture in M9 medium at 37 C with 220 rpm
agitation until the OD600 reaches approximately 0.4 Au. Set
the incubator at 25 C, and grow the cultures until OD600
reaches 0.6–0.8 Au. Induce expression by adding IPTG to a
ﬁnal concentration of 0.25 mM (see Note 12) from a 1 M stock
solution. Grow the induced cultures overnight.
5. Centrifuge the culture at 3000  g for 20 min. Discard the
supernatant. Resuspend the pellet from a 1 L culture in 20 mL
of lysis buffer supplemented with 0.25 mL PIC and 0.25 mL
PMSF. Transfer to a 50 mL Falcon tube (up to two resus-
pended pellets can be pooled together). If puriﬁcation is to
be performed at a later time, ﬂash-freeze in liquid N2 and store
at 80 C.
3.3
Puriﬁcation
of the Isolated Qn
Peptides
1. If required, thaw your stored pellet suspensions. Add 25 μL of
DNAse I (5 mg/mL) per L of culture to be puriﬁed and
lysozyme to a ﬁnal concentration of 1.5 mg/mL to the resus-
pended pellet. Keep your tubes on ice.
2. Lyse cells with ultrasounds (see Note 13) keeping your tubes in
an ice bucket. Set the sonicator in pulse mode and a total time
of 15 min. Set equally long “on” pulses and “off” cooling
periods (e.g., 15 s “on,” 15 s “off”). Actual sonication “on”
time will be 7.5 min. Set amplitude no higher than 30% to
prevent excessive heating. Let the sample to cool down, and
repeat this step for higher lysis efﬁciency.
3. Transfer the sample to 50 mL centrifuge tubes. Weight equili-
brate and centrifuge at 4 C, 40,000  g for 20 min. Aided by a
syringe, ﬁlter the supernatant using a disk ﬁlter with 0.45 μm
pore size.

4. Perform an IMAC puriﬁcation step on the ﬁltered supernatant
using an FPLC system equipped with a pre-packed immobi-
lized nickel column (Fig. 2a). Filter and vacuum degas 0.75 L
of lysis buffer, 0.25 L of DNA washout buffer, and 0.5 L of
elution buffer using disposable ﬁlters with 0.45 μm pore size
mounted on bottles containing magnetic stirrers. Set the
method as detailed in Table 4. Collect the elution step in
10 mL fractions.
5. Check elution fractions by SDS-PAGE, and pool those con-
taining the His6-Sumo-Qn fusion protein (Fig. 2a).
6. Prepare 4 L of lysis buffer in a 5 L beaker and cool it to 4 C.
Hydrate a piece of dialysis membrane with a 3.5 kDa MW
cutoff in ultrapure water. Equilibrate the membrane in the
pre-chilled buffer for 5 min after sealing it on one extreme
using a ﬂoating dialysis clip. Load the membrane with the
sample (maximum 50 mL per dialysis bag; if required, load
additional bags). Dialyze with gentle magnetic stirring for
3–16 h (see Note 14).
7. Transfer the protein solution to a 50 mL Falcon tube. Collect a
sample for SDS-PAGE analysis before protease digestion. Add
Ulp1 (Sumo protease) to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.05 mg/mL,
and keep the sample with gentle agitation at 4 C for at least
1 h.
8. Check digestion by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2b). AR Qn peptides are
not visible after staining, so digestion is monitored by a shift of
the band corresponding to the His6-Sumo-Qn fusion to a lower
MW band corresponding to the His6-Sumo tag. If digestion is

incomplete, add Sumo protease up to 0.1 mg/mL and allow an
additional hour at 4 C.
9. Once digestion is complete, perform an IMAC step on an
FPLC system equipped with a pre-packed immobilized nickel
column to separate the Qn peptides, which will not bind to the
column, from the His6-Sumo tag (Fig. 2b). Set method details
as in Table 4, skipping the DNA washout step and the
subsequent column wash. Collect the ﬂowthrough containing
unbound peptide during sample load as well as the subsequent
wash steps in 25 mL fractions.
10. Pour 4 L of ultrapure water in a 5 L beaker and cool to 4 C.
Aside, wash a dialysis membrane with a 0.5–1 kDa Mw cutoff
in ultrapure water. Equilibrate the membrane in pre-chilled
water and load it with sample (maximum 25 mL per dialysis
bag). Dialyze with gentle magnetic stirring for 3–16 h (see
Note 14). Repeat this step at least twice to guarantee optimal
salt removal.
11. Once dialysis is complete, the integrity and labeling yields of
the sample can be assessed by UPLC-MS (Fig. 3). Transfer
30 μL of the sample to an appropriate vial. Set an UPLC
gradient of 0–100% mobile phase B in 3 min. Set MS method
to positive mode with mass detection in the 500–3000 Da
range. Usually ions with three, four, and ﬁve charges are readily
detected.
12. Transfer the samples to 50 mL Falcon tubes. Make 10–20
holes in the tube lid using a needle, ﬂash freeze in liquid N2,
and lyophilize. Change the lid and keep the lyophilized powder
at 80 C until the day before your NMR or CD experiments
are planned.

Purity Polishing
and Monomerization
of the Qn Peptides
1. Equilibrate a Superdex™30 Increase 10/300 GL column (see
Note 4) mounted on an FPLC system at 4 C. Wash out
column storage buffer with 2 CV (column volumes) of ultra-
pure water. Equilibrate the column with 2 CV of H2O 0.1%
TFA (see Note 15).
2. Prepare 25 mL of fresh 6 M guanidine thiocyanate in ultrapure
water (see Subheading 2.2, step 17 and Note 16).
3. Dissolve the lyophilized Qn peptide in 400 μL of 6 M guani-
dine thiocyanate (see Notes 17 and 18). Transfer the solution
to a 1.5 mL tube, and agitate it for 3–16 h (see Note 19) in a
thermoblock at room temperature with 1250 rpm agitation.
4. After disaggregation, add 100 μL of H2O 0.1% TFA to the
400 μL of peptide solution to dilute the guanidine thiocyanate
concentration prior to injection to an FPLC system. Centrifuge
the sample for 5 min at maximum speed in a tabletop 1.5 mL
tube centrifuge.
5. Load the sample on an FPLC system at 4 C to run a size-
exclusion chromatography (SEC) polishing step (Fig. 2c) on a
Superdex™30 Increase 10/300 GL column or similar (see
Note 14). Set an isocratic run using H2O 0.1% TFA as a mobile
phase (see Note 20). A peak will elute at the column’s void
volume (around 7.5–8 mL) containing impurities and aggre-
gated Qn peptide. Monomeric peptide will elute between
10.5 mL (AR Q25) and 13.5 mL (AR Q4) depending on size.
Collect 0.25 mL fractions using a 96 deep well plate
accordingly.
6. Keeping the sample on ice, take the four central fractions
corresponding to the monomeric peak (Fig. 2c), and pool
them in two separate polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes
(500 μL of sample in each tube). Centrifuge them at 4 C in
a tabletop ultracentrifuge for 3 h at 386,000  g (see Note 21).
7. Gently take out the tubes from the rotor using a pair of twee-
zers. Pipetting just on the surface of the solution, transfer the
top half volume (250 μL) of each centrifuge tube to a 1.5 mL
tube. Keep samples on ice.
8. Add 55 μL of 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer and pH 7.4 to
the 500 μL sample (see Note 22). Adjust the pH to its ﬁnal
value (7.4 for AR Qn peptides) using freshly prepared NaOH
1 M and HCl 1 M solutions (see Note 23). Keep sample on ice
during pH adjustment, and use a thin pH electrode for mea-
surement. Volume additions are in the range of 0.5–2 μL. Use a
micropipette to mix after each volume addition. Spin sample
down with short centrifuge pulses.
9. Measure sample concentration. If no aromatic residues absorb-
ing at 280 nm are present in the construct, use a calibrated C18
Isotope-Enriched Monomeric Aggregation-Prone Peptides
223

analytical column mounted on a HPLC system with ultraviolet
(UV) absorbance set at 220 nm for accurate quantiﬁcation (see
Note 24). Otherwise, measure absorbance at 280 nm using a
nanodrop or a UV spectrophotometer, and obtain sample con-
centration applying the Beer-Lambert law (see Note 25).
10. In case disaggregation efﬁciency has not been tested before for
a particular peptide, assess the oligomeric state of the sample
(see Note 26).
3.5
Sample
Preparation for NMR
Measurements
1. Keeping the sample on ice, add 10% (v/v) pre-chilled D2O to
the sample (i.e., 40 μL D2O to 360 μL of Qn peptide in 20 mM
sodium phosphate, 0.1% TFA pH 7.4). Add DSS to a ﬁnal
concentration of 10 μM from the 4 mM stock solution (1 μL
in a 400 μL sample) kept at 20 C. Using a micropipette,
homogenize the sample and spin it down with a short centri-
fuge pulse.
2. Transfer the sample to a pre-chilled NMR tube (3 mm tube for
180 μL samples; Shigemi tube for 400 μL samples; 5 mm tube
for 550 μL samples) using a long glass Pasteur pipette.
3. Cool the NMR probe to 5 C. Before inserting the NMR tube
in the spinner, wipe away water with a piece of paper. Adjust
tube height and insert it in the NMR spectrometer.
4. Run the NMR experiments of choice (see Note 27).

Notes
1. Similar to other available tags such as the His6 tag, maltose-
binding protein (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), or
thioredoxin, His6-Sumo promotes expression in E. coli, pro-
tects the target Qn peptide from protease-mediated degrada-
tion, enhances solubility, and facilitates puriﬁcation. However,
because the Sumo protease Ulp1 recognizes the tertiary fold of
Sumo rather than a cleavage sequence, an advantage of His6-
Sumo over other options is the fact that it can be cleaved off
leaving no additions of unwanted amino acids in the target
peptide.
2. The addition of Lys (K) residues at the N- and C-termini helps
solubilizing the highly aggregation-prone polyQ sequence, and
the effects that this may have on helicity need to be taken into
account [21]. Other charged amino acids such as Glu (E) can
be used as well, with differential effects in solubility and helicity
enhancement.
3. While this is subject to further optimization, alternative E. coli
expression strains such as BL21 (DE3) might be used.
224
Albert Escobedo et al.

4. Similar, lower-resolution results can be obtained with the
older—and discontinued—version of this column Superdex
Peptide 10/300 GL. An alternative is the Superdex 30 Increase
3.2/300.
5. SOC medium is the preferred option at this step to maximize
the recovery of cells before plating. Other media including
standard ones such as Lysogeny Broth (LB), Terriﬁc Broth
(TB), or Super Optimal Broth (SOB) might be used as well
although this may result in lower transformation yields.
6. Antibiotic-supplemented LB agar plates should be freshly
prepared from stocks shortly before usage. If plates are
prepared for usage at a later time, seal them with Paraﬁlm® to
avoid drying, and keep them at 4 C to prevent contamination.
Do not use plates older than 2 weeks. To prepare plates, melt
your sterilized medium stock (25 g/L LB agar in water) in a
microwave. Let the solution cool to about 30 C. Take 20 mL
per plate to be prepared, and add the antibiotics to their ﬁnal
concentrations (see Subheading 2.1, step 6). Mix thoroughly,
pour to a petri plate, and let it solidify lid open to avoid
condensation.
7. The level of isotope labeling of the target recombinant protein
is above 90% in most cases when using an LB-based pre-culture
to grow cultures in minimal media. This meets the require-
ments for most routine NMR experiments. For higher isotope
labeling yields—especially if highly efﬁcient perdeuteration is
required—grow your pre-cultures in labeled minimal medium
(components detailed in Table 3). Prepare 50 mL of minimal
medium pre-culture per liter of expression culture to be grown.
Take 1 mL of LB-based saturated pre-culture per each 50 mL
to be inoculated. Spin cells down (3000  g, 20 min), discard
the LB supernatant, and resuspend them in the minimal
medium. Grow the new pre-culture to saturation overnight at
37 C. Repeat this step once again for improved results.
8. At completion, this protocol yields isotope-labeled AR Qn
peptides NMR-ready 600 μL samples in the 70–130 μM con-
centration range for every 2 L of expression culture grown.
9. If samples of recombinant protein are to be obtained without
NMR active isotope labeling (i.e., at isotope natural abun-
dance), the expression culture might be grown in M9 minimal
medium with 12C-glucose and 14N-NH4Cl as sole carbon and
nitrogen sources, respectively, or in standard E. coli growth
media such as LB or TB. Alternatively, relatively short (40-
mer) sequences can be obtained by standard solid-phase pep-
tide synthesis (SPPS).
Isotope-Enriched Monomeric Aggregation-Prone Peptides

10. The culture volume should not exceed 1/5th of the container
ﬂask’s volume. This ensures enough culture aeration, which
results in optimal expression levels.
11. Always open your stock solutions under sterile conditions. If
they appear turbid or have any suspended material, prepare
fresh stocks. Always dilute the CaCl2 in water before the M9
salts to avoid precipitation of calcium phosphate salts that form
at high concentrations. Alternative minimal media such as
MOPS might be used at your convenience, and formulations
can be found elsewhere. Production yields might beneﬁt from
the use of commercial, optimized isotope-labeled rich media.
12. Temperature, IPTG concentration, and expression time are the
three parameters to be optimized that have an inﬂuence on
expression levels and solubility of the target protein. Small-
scale expression and solubility trials should be conducted in
non-isotopically labeled minimal medium prior to production.
Temperature values tested often are in the 16–37 C range,
while IPTG is often tested between 0.05 and 0.5 mM. In both
cases, lower values beneﬁt solubility often at the expense of
expression yields. Short expression times (3–4 h) are preferred
in case target degradation is observed. If that is not the case,
overnight expression is used to maximize yields. In case the
desired yields/solubility are not obtained, construct bound-
aries and/or fusion tag should be revisited. Alternatively, in
some cases, the target protein can be recovered from inclusion
bodies by dissolving them in a solution containing a protein-
denaturing chaotropic salt at high concentration (6 M guani-
dine hydrochloride or 8 M urea) followed by equilibration/
refolding in native buffer.
13. Alternative lysis methods such as pressure-based ones can be
used. If a cooled cell homogenizer is used, avoid isopropanol-
dissolved PMSF or highly concentrated detergents (i.e., Tween
20 at concentrations higher than 0.2%) to avoid excessive
foaming.
14. Complete dialysis equilibration requires at least 3 h. This step
might proceed overnight. Longer periods may result in sample
degradation and/or aggregation.
15. H2O, 0.1% TFA, is the mobile phase yielding highest resolu-
tion and optimal peak symmetry in ﬁnal polishing steps. The
acidic pH 3 helps at both levels, and TFA acts as a counterion
contributing to keeping polyQ peptides monomeric.
16. 6 M Guanidine thiocyanate solutions are stable only for a few
days. After that, salt may crystalize or oxidize yielding a yellow-
ish tonality. For best results, prepare a fresh solution right
before every experiment.
226
Albert Escobedo et al.

17. Buffer salts are usually left in the lyophilized material, as the
dialysis against H2O in Subheading 3.3, step 10 is not
completely efﬁcient. Thus, it is not possible to quantify the
amount of sample to be dissolved by weight. Concentration of
the sample is avoided along the protocol as it generates con-
centration gradients that enhance the intrinsic aggregation
tendency of polyQ tracts. Sufﬁcient amounts of lyophilized
material need to be dissolved to yield samples that are concen-
trated enough for NMR experiments (25–200 μM) after the
polishing and monomerization protocol, with no possibility to
increase sample concentration. Typically, the lyophilized mate-
rial obtained from the puriﬁcation of 2 L of cell culture in
minimal medium yields isotope-labeled AR Qn samples in the
70–130 μM concentration range.
18. In case salt leftovers do not dissolve in 400 μL of 6 M guanidine
thiocyanate, centrifuge them down and transfer the superna-
tant to a 1.5 mL tube.
19. Complete monomerization is achieved after 3 h. For timing
convenience with the following steps, it can be performed
overnight (about 16 h) without major gain or drawbacks.
20. The guanidine thiocyanate injected with the sample elutes after
1 CV of mobile phase has passed through the column. Strong
destabilization of the UV baseline is observed at all wave-
lengths in the middle ultraviolet range. For baseline stabiliza-
tion and to guarantee complete removal of the chaotropic salt,
run H2O for six additional CVs. Wash column with two CV
ultrapure water and two CV 20% ethanol in water (v/v) for
storage.
21. Based on the protocol developed by the Wetzel group at the
University of Pittsburgh [19, 20], this ultracentrifugation step
has
been
optimized
to
remove
potential
aggregation-
nucleating oligomers from the monomeric sample. For pep-
tides in the size range presented here (1.8–4.5 kDa), this step
has been optimized to 3 h as it provides an optimal trade-off
between oligomer removal and monomer loss. For constructs
with higher molecular weight, shorter times need to be opti-
mized. To do that, test increasing ultracentrifugation time
points (1–3 h) on your sample, and take the half top volume
as explained in Subheading 3.4, step 7. Measure the amount of
protein left as explained in Subheading 3.4, step 9, and assess
oligomeric state as explained in Note 26. After a certain ultra-
centrifugation time, monomer loss largely exceeds oligomer
removal. Select the optimal condition yielding the highest
oligomer removal with minimal monomer loss.
Isotope-Enriched Monomeric Aggregation-Prone Peptides

22. This will yield a sample containing 20 mM sodium phosphate
buffer and pH 7.4. For higher reproducibility, keep a stock of
the 10 buffer aliquoted and frozen at 20 C.
23. As 1 M NaOH solutions tend to crystallize over time, addition
of microcrystals to the sample may interfere with subsequent
measurements. To avoid that, always use freshly dissolved 1 M
NaOH for sample pH adjustment.
24. For reversed-phase (RP) HPLC column calibration and sample
quantiﬁcation, use a 0–100% mobile phase B gradient. Inject at
least ﬁve peptide samples of increasing concentration (previ-
ously determined by amino acid analysis). Integrate the area
below the peak and ﬁt data to a calibration curve by linear
regression.
25. Beer-Lambert law correlates absorbance with concentration as
follows:
A280 ¼ ε280 M1cm1


c M
ð
Þl cm
ð
Þ
where A280 is the absorbance at 280 nm, ε280 is the extinction
coefﬁcient of the protein at 280 nm, c is the protein concentra-
tion, and l is the cuvette path length. For a given protein
sequence, ε280 can be estimated using computational tools
such
as
ExPASy
ProtParam
(https://web.expasy.org/pro
tparam/). For higher accuracy, ε280 can be experimentally
obtained applying the Beer-Lambert conversion to samples of
known concentration (as determined by amino acid analysis).
26. For samples with molecular weight in the range of the AR Qn
peptides (1.8–4.5 kDa), size-exclusion chromatography cou-
pled to multiple-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) provides
the most accurate and reliable measurements. Samples are
loaded in a Superdex™30 Increase 10/300 GL column or
similar equilibrated in sodium phosphate 20 mM buffer 0.1%
TFA at pH 7.4. Scattering signal is measured by a multiple-
angle detector and integrated to yield the molecular weight of
the specie(s) present in solution. Alternatively, analytical ultra-
centrifugation can be used in samples with molecular weight
above 7.5 kDa, yielding equally conclusive results. Dynamic
light-scattering measurements provide a lower resolution yet
valuable assessment of sample homogeneity that can be mod-
eled to identify oligomeric species in solution. NMR concen-
tration titrations are also used to identify the presence of small
oligomers and/or aggregates. For small oligomers, different
chemical shifts are expected for the monomeric and the oligo-
meric species, which result in chemical shift perturbations in
case the latter are present. In contrast, the slow tumbling of
aggregates results in signal broadening beyond the detection
limit. This can be monitored as a progressive intensity loss in
228
Albert Escobedo et al.

the peaks corresponding to the monomeric species as the pop-
ulation of aggregates grows. NMR relaxation and chemical
exchange saturation transfer (CEST) experiments can be used
to ﬁnely identify low populations of oligomers in the
sample [16].
27. A wide variety of multidimensional NMR experiments can be
acquired on uniformly isotope-labeled samples depending on
the information that is required [22, 23]. An initial, fast assess-
ment of the stability and folding of the peptide/protein is
commonly obtained through the acquisition of 1H-15N 2D
correlation experiments such as the HSQC, which require
15N isotope enrichment. Low
1H dispersion with signals
gathering in the 8–8.5 ppm range is typical of intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs), such as those where polyQ tracts
are commonly found. Backbone resonance assignment is essen-
tial to obtain more detailed information on a per-residue basis
and is informative of secondary structure content. Experiments
meant for that require labeling in both 13C and 15N and
include the HNCO/HNcaCO, the HNCA/HNcoCA [24],
and the HNCACB/HNcoCACB pairs of 3D experiments
[25]. In the case of IDRs, where resolution in the 1H dimen-
sion is limited resulting in signal overlap, strategies have been
developed based on higher-dimensionality experiments [14] as
well as on the direct detection of 13C [26] and, more recently,
15N [27] that despite their lower sensitivity provide otherwise
unachievable gains in resolution. Side-chain
1H resonance
assignment together with structural restraints can be achieved
through the 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC
3D spectra [28] or alternatively through the HccoNH 3D
experiment [29], whereas 13C resonances can be assigned
using the HCCH-TOCSY, the 13C-edited NOESY HSQC,
and the CCcoNH experiments [30]. Further structural
restraints can be obtained through the measurement of residual
dipolar couplings (RDCs) [31] as well as using paramagnetic
tags [32]. Backbone and side-chain dynamics and ﬂexibility can
be assessed through the measurement of NMR relaxation
observables [33].

Cell-Free Protein Synthesis of Small Intrinsically Disordered
Proteins for NMR Spectroscopy
Linne´a Isaksson and Anders Pedersen
Abstract
Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) is an established method to produce recombinant proteins and has been
used in a wide variety of applications. The use of CFPS has almost from the onset been favorably linked to
the production of isotopically labelled proteins for NMR spectroscopy as the resulting labelling of the
produced protein is deﬁned by the chosen amino acids during reaction setup. Here we describe how to set
up production and isotopic labelling of small intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) for NMR spectroscopy
applications using an E. coli-based CFPS system in batch mode.
Key words Cell-free synthesis, IDP, Isotope labelling, S12 extract, CFPS, GFP

Introduction
Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) encompasses the reconstitution
of transcription and translation in a test tube, using either puriﬁed
macromolecular components or extracts of cells to provide the
ribozyme and enzyme machineries needed. The versatility of
CFPS is such that it has been used in a wide variety of applications,
ranging from, e.g., analytical-scale production of very complex
systems [1], screening soluble expression of membrane proteins
[2], elaborate isotope labelling for spectroscopy [3, 4] to
manufacturing scale of therapeutic proteins [5], and being
employed as an educational tool [6].
NMR is the most powerful and suitable technique for investi-
gating intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Although the pro-
ton chemical shift dispersion of IDPs is generally poor, the slower
relaxation rates often allow acquisition of spectra with narrow lines
even for large proteins. In vivo, regions of low complexity and
disorder of overexpressed recombinant proteins are often prone
to proteolytic degradation, which may decrease the yields or even
prohibit protein expression. Since CFPS is an open system, not

constrained by any membranes, the possibility to add protease
inhibitors and use a relatively short expression time both contri-
butes to limiting any proteolytic susceptibility. In a bioinformatics
study of 3066 human proteins expressed in an E. coli-based CFPS
system, several properties of IDPs correlated positively with the
success of protein expression [7]. The proportion of high-yield
expression and solubility was directly correlated with the content
of disorder. Also, higher content of charged amino acids, a charac-
teristic feature of IDPs, was associated with increased soluble pro-
tein expression. In contrast, increase in disorder has also been
observed to be negatively correlated with overall expression
yield [8].
CFPS offers several advantages for the production of isotope-
labelled proteins for NMR spectroscopy analysis. Since it is only the
target protein that is produced, the amino acids are used very
efﬁciently, and isotopic scrambling is kept at a minimum due to
lower metabolic activity in the extract compared to living cells.
Selective labelling is achieved by simply replacing the amino acid
(s) of interest with labelled ones. Site-speciﬁc incorporation of
unnatural amino acids is also possible with CFPS either by employ-
ing the same amber stop codon suppression as with in vivo expres-
sion, where the orthogonal suppressor tRNA and tRNA-aminoacyl
synthetase are supplied as additives [9] or co-expressed [10], or by
adding a suppressor tRNA carrying a chemically ligated labelled
amino acid [4].
Here we describe the setup and use of an E. coli S12 lysate-
based CFPS system in batch mode for production of IDPs for
NMR spectroscopic studies. Figure 1a outlines the necessary com-
ponents of the described CFPS system.

2.4
CFPS Reagents
1. 10 mL 5 low-molecular-weight mix (5LMW): Weigh
49.4 mg 15N-ammonium hydroxide and 1.559 g D-glutamic
acid in a 15 mL tube. Prepare 250 mL 1 M Hepes-KOH
pH 7.5 and 50 mL 5 M KOH, and add 2.625 mL and
2.3 mL, respectively, to the 15 mL tube. Dissolve the reagents.
Weigh and add to the solution: 30.3 mg ATP, 20.9 mg GTP,
21.1 mg CTP, 23.4 mg UTP, 10.53 mg cAMP, 2.045 g folinic
acid, 13 mg DTT, 1.032 g creatine phosphate, 8.75 mg E. coli
total tRNA. Dissolve completely by vortexing. Add 20 μL of
RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (40 U/mL) and 1 tablet of cOm-
plete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. Wash a pH elec-
trode with ElectroZap and then RNase-free water. Proceed by
adjusting the pH of the LMW mix to 7.0 using acetic acid. Use
as little acid as possible as excess acetate affects CFPS yields
negatively.
2. T7 RNA polymerase: Prepare T7 RNA polymerase as described
in Davanloo et al. using the pAR1219 expression vector [12]. A
His-tagged version with cleavable tag or similarly tagged con-
structs can also be used. Mix the puriﬁed polymerase with equal
amounts of sterile glycerol (87% v/v), and store at 20 C.
Final concentration should be  5 mg/mL.
3. Expression plasmid: Preferably of high copy number type,
encompassing the relevant sequence under T7 promoter con-
trol and incorporating a His-tag for puriﬁcation and detection
purposes (see Note 1).

creatine kinase in water. Do not vortex! Aliquot the kinase in
50 μL fractions and store at 20 C until use.
5. Amino acids: Prepare 10 mL 84 mM stock solutions for each
amino acid in 60 mM HEPES-KOH and pH 7.5 (use the
buffer stock solution prepared in Subheading 2.4, item 1).
For NMR sample production, use the relevant isotope-labelled
amino acids (see Note 2). Add 400 μL and 800 μL of 0.5 M
DTT to methionine and cysteine, respectively. To tryptophan,

acid solutions thoroughly until completely dissolved. Add
1 mL of each amino acid in a 50 mL tube. Mix thoroughly,
and aliquot in 1 mL fractions. Store at 20 C.

Methods
3.1
Extract
Cultivation
1. On day 1, start two 5 mL precultures of BL21(DE3)-Rosetta
2 in 2xYT media, prepared in Subheading 2.2, item 1, by
picking two of the colonies on the LB agar plate prepared in
Subheading 2.2, item 9. Use 30 mg/mL chloramphenicol and
incubate overnight at 37 C and 200 rpm.
2. On day 2, inoculate 400 μL of the BL21(DE3)-Rosetta 2 pre-
cultures to 4  100 mL 2xYT medium including 30 mg/mL
chloramphenicol in the morning. Incubate at 37
C and
200 rpm. Calibrate the pH meter in the fermentor before in
situ sterilization. Sterilize the fermentor with the 2xYTP
media, prepared in Subheading 2.2, item 2. After sterilization,
let the fermentor stabilize at 37 C. Add the sterile glucose
from Subheading 2.2, item 3 and the additional components
prepared in Subheading 2.2, items 4, 5, and 7. Fill up the
fermentor with sterile water to 20 L. Take out a reference
sample for later optical density (OD600) measurement. Con-
nect the NaOH adjustment stock prepared in Subheading 2.2,
item 8, and check pH of the media before adding the precul-
tures, 4  100 mL. Use a stirring setting of 600 rpm with an
airﬂow of 4 L/min. Turn off the stirring when adding the
BL21(DE3)-Rosetta 2. Control the pH at 7.0 during the
cultivation to counter the pH drop during the exponential
growth phase. Make sure that the pO2 value does not drop;
in the case this happens, adjust stirring speed and/or airﬂow
accordingly. Measure OD600 at regular intervals on 4x diluted
growth medium manually if there is no way of monitoring in
real time. When the undiluted OD600 reaches 3.5–4, harvest
the cells. Turn the fermentor cooling system on during harvest,
and keep the cells on ice at all time (see Note 4). Pre-weigh
centrifuge tubes. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 4000  g
for 15 min. Collect the pellet. Resuspend the cells with 3 L
extract buffer including 2-mercaptoethanol, prepared in Sub-
heading 2.3, item 1. Centrifuge again at the same speed and
duration. Collect the pellet and resuspend with 10 mL extract
buffer/8 g wet cells. Flash-freeze the cells in 40 mL aliquots
with liquid N2 and store at 80 C. See Fig. 1b top panel for a
ﬂowchart of extract cultivation.

3.2
Extract
Preparation
Thaw the cells overnight on ice at 4 C. Add DTT to a ﬁnal
concentration of 1 mM and 1 cOmplete EDTA-free to the
thawed cells. Break the cells with a single passage through a French
press at an aperture pressure of 24,000 psi. It is important that no
clumps are left in the cell suspension before lysis. Centrifuge the
lysate for 10 min at 4 C at 12,000  g (see Note 5), i.e., generating
an S12 lysate. Incubate the supernatant in tubes at 37 C and
150 rpm for 30 min to remove endogenous mRNA. Prepare 6 L
1 extract buffer from the stock in Subheading 2.2, item 1. Use a
1:40 ratio of extract/buffer, and dialyze the extract in 6–8 kDa
MWCO dialysis tubing for 1–2 h at 4 C. Change the buffer and
dialyze overnight. Flash-freeze 0.5 or 1 mL aliquots in cryo vials in
liquid N2, and store at 80 C. See Fig. 1b middle panel for a
ﬂowchart outlining the S12 extract preparation.
3.3
Plasmid
Preparation
1. Amplify and prepare expression vector in a midi or maxi scale
according to kit manufacturer protocol (see Note 6).
2. Use UV spectroscopy to determine the concentration of the
ﬁnal plasmid preparation which should be 0.5 μg/μL and
with an absorbance ratio A260/A280 of 1.8 to ensure as
high plasmid purity as possible.
3.4
CFPS Reaction
Setup
1. Thaw extract, 5xLMW, plasmid DNA, creatine kinase, and
amino acids by placing on ice 1 h before reaction setup.
2. For a 200 μL CFPS reaction, mix the components listed in
Table 1 in the stated order in an RNase-free 1.5 mL tube,
microtiter plate, or any other batch format. Place on thermo-
mixer, and shake at 800 rpm for 2 h at 30 C (see Notes 7 and 8).
3.5
Extract Activity
Test and Mg2+
Optimization
It is well-known that the concentration of Mg2+ is important for
high-yield expression, so this parameter is always optimized for
each cell extract prepared. In our experience, the optimal concen-
tration for S12 extract is around 12  2 mM. The ﬂuorescence
readout from GFPcyc3/EGFP expression can be used to test the
extract and to optimize the Mg2+ concentration:
1. Set up replicates of 200 μL GFPcyc3 reactions according to
Table 1 with varying Mg2+ concentration between 0 and
20 mM.
2. Start the cell-free reactions at 30 C and 800 rpm for 2 h on a
thermomixer.
3. Spin down the reactions at 20,000  g for 10 min. Transfer
160 μL of the supernatant to a microtiter plate for ﬂuorescence
measurement. Incubate the plate for a few hours or overnight
at 4 C. Use a plate reader in ﬂuorescence mode with the same
ﬁlter settings as in Subheading 2.1, item 4, and plot the ﬂuo-

extract corresponds to the condition where GFP ﬂuorescence is
at a maximum (Fig. 2).
3.6
Expression
Assessment
Different methods can be used to assess if the IDP was successfully
produced in the cell-free protein synthesis system, as outlined
below:
1. Fluorescence measurement. If the sample of interest is ﬂuores-
cent, the intensity of this can be measured with a plate reader.
For example, GFPcyc3/EGFP-tagged constructs can be used
for general protocol optimization (as for extract testing in
Subheading 3.5).
2. Western blot. Make SDS-PAGE samples from the total reaction
mixture after the 2 h incubation on the thermomixer. This
corresponds to the total (T) sample. Spin down the reactions
(20,000  g, 10 min), and take an equivalent soluble (S) sample
from the supernatant. Perform an SDS-PAGE and an ensuing
Western blot, using a primary antibody that detects His-tagged
proteins. By comparing the intensity of the T and the S sample,
the solubility of the protein can be qualitatively assessed
(Fig. 3a). Similarly, see Fig. 3b for an example Western blot of
CFPS reaction soluble fractions of six small human IDPs.
3. SDS-PAGE. Purify the sample using Ni-NTA afﬁnity chroma-
tography (see Note 9). This can be done in a small scale using a
gravity-ﬂow method with disposable columns. If the construct
is made with an N-terminal His-tag followed by a TEV protease
cleavage site, a reverse Ni-NTA puriﬁcation can be performed
to increase purity by cleaving off the His-tag from the puriﬁed
protein
using
recombinant
His-tagged
TEV
protease,
prepared, e.g., as in van den Berg et al. [13]. The tagged
TEV protease and uncleaved expressed protein will bind to
the column, allowing the cleaved protein to be collected in
the ﬂowthrough. After electrophoretic separation, stain with
Coomassie Brilliant Blue or similar protein stain, and assess the
results of the IDP expression (Fig. 3c).
4. 15N-HSQC. After the cell-free reaction using 15N-labelled
amino acids, heat-treat the IDP expression reaction at 90 C
for 10 min. Care should be taken if the CFPS-produced IDP
contains folded domains in which case the heat-denaturing
approach is unsuitable. Spin down the sample at 20,000  g
for 10 min, and collect the supernatant. Perform a buffer
exchange using small desalting columns to a suitable NMR
buffer (e.g., 25 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 10%
D2O, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 6.9). Set up a short 15N-HSQC
(e.g., a “hsqcetfpf3gsi2”; four scans; 256 increments; sweep
widths of 14 and 25 ppm in the direct and indirect dimensions,

respectively; and a relaxation delay of 1 s for a total experimen-
tal time of 20 min) to assess the expression results of the IDP,
count the number of observed versus expected amide reso-
nances, and check the intensity distribution (Fig. 3d). Also,
see Note 10 and Fig. 1b bottom panel for a ﬂowchart outlining
the above described expression assessment.

Notes
1. In our experience, low-to-medium copy number vectors such
as the pET or pJexpress are less suitable for CFPS since the
CFPS yields are generally lower than for, e.g., pIVEX2.3d/
2.4d, pEXP5NT/CT, and similar vectors, and the amount of
puriﬁed plasmid needed for large-scale reactions can be labori-
ous to prepare for routine NMR sample production.
2. Selective labelling can be achieved by mixing labelled and
unlabelled amino acids to the CFPS reaction.
3. DTT is added to cysteine and methionine to avoid oxidation
during preparation and storage at 20 C. The solubilities of
tyrosine and tryptophan are such that they need to be prepared
at basic and acidic conditions, respectively.
4. Harvest cells as quickly as possible with as rapid cooling as
possible. Harvesting through 7 m stainless steel tubing folded
into a double coil immersed in ice water and with fermentor
cooling on, passage changes cell suspension temperature from
37 C to below l0 C, essentially stopping further growth.
5. We have chosen to use S12 extract (originally described in
[14]) instead of the more widely used S30, simply because
the CFPS yields in our hands were far better [15]. When
expressing membrane proteins or lipid-binding proteins, S30
is a better choice as the S12 extract retains a lot of lipids and
thus is not a clear solution.
6. Although plasmid miniprep kits generally give quantitatively
enough material for screening expression of a given construct,
the quality of the preparation is lower compared to the midi
scale and above. Whether this is due to residual RNase A left in
the eluate or for some other reason, we do not know at present.
7. This is a suitable volume for screening reactions. NMR sample
reactions are typically in the 10–20 mL range. In terms of
suitable expression temperature, this can be screened, but usu-
ally 30 C is a reasonable setting for most constructs.

Structural Analyses of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
by Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering
Amin Sagar, Dmitri Svergun, and Pau Bernado´
Abstract
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a low-resolution method for the structural characterization of
biological macromolecules in solution. Information about the overall structural features provided by
SAXS is highly complementary to X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
and cryo-electron microscopy, which are high-resolution methods. SAXS not only provides the shape,
oligomeric state, and quaternary structure of folded proteins and protein complexes but also allows for
quantitative analysis of ﬂexible biomolecules. In this chapter, the most relevant SAXS procedures for
structural characterization of ﬂexible macromolecules, including intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs),
are presented. The sample requirements for SAXS experiments on protein solutions and the sequence of
steps in data collection and processing are described. The use of the advanced data analysis tools to
quantitatively characterize ﬂexible proteins is presented in detail. Typical experimental issues and potential
problems encountered during SAXS data measurements and analyses are discussed.

Introduction
Small-angle X-ray scattering of X-rays (SAXS) is a method for
structural and dynamic analysis of biological macromolecules in
solution [1]. Over the last decades, major advances in sample
preparation, instrumentation, and computational strategies have
led to exciting developments in the application of SAXS to struc-
tural biology including globular proteins, macromolecular com-
plexes, and ﬂexible systems such as intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs) [2–8].
In a SAXS experiment, samples containing macromolecules in
solution are exposed to an X-ray beam, and the scattered intensity is
recorded by a detector as a function of the scattering angle. Dilute
protein solutions provide an isotropic scattering intensity I that
depends on the modulus of the momentum transfer q (q ¼ 4πsin

(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the angle between the incident and scattered
beam and λ is the wavelength of the beam). The solvent scattering is
subtracted, and the background corrected intensity is presented as a
radially averaged one-dimensional curve I(q). Importantly, for
dilute monodisperse solutions of identical randomly oriented par-
ticles, the SAXS curve is proportional to the scattering of a single
particle averaged over all orientations.
Several structural parameters can be directly obtained from a
SAXS curve providing information about the size, molecular
weight, oligomeric state, and overall shape of the particles in solu-
tion. For folded proteins or macromolecular complexes with rigid
structures that do not have large conformational ﬂuctuations,
low-resolution three-dimensional models can be determined from
the scattering data using ab initio reconstruction approaches
[9, 10]. If high-resolution structures and/or homology models of
some protein fragments are available, their relative position can be
reﬁned by rigid-body approaches [3, 8, 11, 12], using SAXS data as
a constraint. Moreover, SAXS is routinely employed for the valida-
tion of structural models, identiﬁcation of oligomeric states, and
the estimation of molar fractions of the species present in mixtures
[13, 14].
SAXS has also been actively used for ﬂexible systems including
solutions of IDPs. However, in the past, the analysis was often
restricted to the determination of simple averaged structural para-
meters [15]. More recently, novel possibilities in the study of
structurally ﬂuctuating proteins have been developed, paving the
way for the advanced structural and dynamic characterization in
terms of conformational ensembles [16]. These studies have
provided novel information that has been proven as fundamental
to understand crucial biological processes (see, for instance, Ref.
[17–21]). The study of ﬂexible macromolecules by SAXS has
emerged as one of the most prominent applications of the tech-
nique [22–26]. In the present chapter, the experimental and meth-
odological peculiarities of the use of SAXS for disordered proteins
are presented. We describe the experimental procedures and the
analysis techniques including the traditional methods providing
overall parameters along with the advanced approaches to charac-
terize the systems in terms of ensembles and distributions of struc-
tural parameters.

Methods
SAXS can probe structure on an extremely broad range of macro-
molecular sizes, ranging from peptides and small proteins (a few
kDa) to large macromolecular complexes and viral particles (several
hundred MDa). For biomacromolecules, SAXS data are recorded in
solution under near native conditions, and the effect of changes in
sample environment (pH, temperature, ionic strength, concentra-
tion, ligands, etc.) can be easily monitored. Importantly, protein
solutions must be well prepared, thoroughly puriﬁed, and biophy-
sically characterized before performing SAXS experiments [5, 31].
In general, a complete SAXS study requires a few (typically 1–2)
mg of a highly pure protein that remains monodisperse in solution
when concentrated. The sample concentration must be determined
as precisely as possible; an accuracy better than 10% is required to
appropriately normalize the scattering data and thus to estimate the
effective molecular mass and the oligomerization state of the solute
(see Note 4).
Two main measurement modes are available at modern SAXS
stations: batch mode and size-exclusion chromatography coupled
to SAXS (SEC-SAXS). While batch mode is the traditional measur-
ing strategy, the SEC-SAXS mode [32–35] is becoming increas-
ingly popular, and most of synchrotron SAXS beamlines offer this
possibility. Both measuring modes present different requirements,
and choosing between them will depend on the speciﬁc character-
istics of the sample. In the following sections, these requirements
will be succinctly described with the aim of helping the reader to
choose the most appropriate one according to the system under
study.

3.1
SAXS
Measurements
in Batch Mode
In the batch mode, samples are directly injected to the measure-
ment cell or capillary. On synchrotrons, SAXS experiments are very
fast, and the data is typically collected within seconds (see Note 5);
on laboratory X-ray sources, minutes or hours are required. It is
recommended to measure a series of scattering curves (from 3 to 5)
at varying concentrations to be able to extrapolate to the condition
of “inﬁnite dilution.” In batch mode, all species present in the
sample contribute to the recorded scattering proﬁle. Consequently,
this mode is more stringent in terms of sample purity and mono-
dispersity. Note that if the sample contains aggregates, severe arti-
facts will be present in the very small-angle portion of the scattering
curve, making its interpretation difﬁcult or even impossible in
structural terms (Fig. 1) (see Notes 6 and 7). Protein solutions
are usually centrifuged prior to the measurements for ~5 min at
~15,000  g to remove large aggregates, and the supernatant is
taken for the measurements (this procedure is especially useful for
the samples stored at 80 C that are thawed prior to the SAXS
experiments).
In the batch mode, each measurement of the macromolecular
solution typically requires two measurements of the corresponding
buffer, before and after the sample (see Notes 8 and 9). Note that
typically, all SAXS measurements during the given experimental
session are performed in the same measuring cell/capillary to
ensure that the background scattering remains unchanged allowing
for reliable buffer subtraction. The sample capillary is cleaned and
reﬁlled after each measurement. In the past, the cleaning and ﬁlling
procedure was done manually; nowadays, liquid-handling robots
are available at most synchrotrons and home-source machines to
facilitate the automatic data collection [36, 37]. The user ﬁlls in a
tray with the samples and corresponding buffers (~50 μl each) and

then speciﬁes the sequence of measurements for robotic loading of
the samples and monitors the progress.
The measurements of the SAXS data are usually performed at
temperatures between at 5 and 10 C to reduce the possible radia-
tion damage effects. However, SAXS stations normally allow for
controlled measurement of the temperature series in a broader
range. Temperature-dependent measurements can be useful to
study, e.g., thermodynamic properties of disordered proteins [38].
3.2
Size-Exclusion
Chromatography
Coupled to SAXS
(SEC-SAXS)
SEC-SAXS is a powerful tool to study samples that are prone to
aggregation or exist in an equilibrium of oligomerization states
[31–35]. SEC removes the aggregates just prior to the SAXS data
collection and separates various oligomerized species resolved by
the column. It is also straightforward to obtain well-matching
buffer scattering proﬁles by collecting SAXS data before and after
the peak(s) of the protein. On the other hand, there also exist
speciﬁc problems of SEC-SAXS. First, as the protein is diluted
during SEC, injected samples must have sufﬁcient concentrations.
Second, the data collection times become much longer as one SEC
run may take between 15 and 120 min, depending on the size of
the column and the ﬂow rate required [31]. Third, as the SAXS data
are collected throughout the SEC run, the total exposure time of
the specimen becomes much longer, increasing the chances of
radiation damage. This problem is aggravated as the ﬂow rates are
slower along the walls of the capillary and the radiation-damaged
material may get deposited on the walls. Between subsequent
SEC-SAXS runs, the capillary should be thoroughly cleaned to
remove any deposited aggregates. A typical cleaning cycle involves
washing with the cleaning solution (2% Hellmanex III, 10% etha-
nol, and 88% distilled water), rinsing with water, and drying with
air. The materials for cleaning are available at the synchrotrons, and
users are not required to arrange for these.
Generally, for SEC-SAXS, the protein is concentrated to
5–15 mg/ml, centrifuged at high speed, or ﬁltered through a
0.2 μM ﬁlter to remove debris and large aggregates. The column
is equilibrated with sufﬁcient volume (2–8 column volumes) of
ﬁltered
buffer.
On
high-brilliance
synchrotrons,
typically,
50–100 μl of sample is injected into the column, and a ﬂow rate
of 0.25–0.50 ml/min is maintained. Recently, SEC-SAXS has also
been conducted on an in-house SAXS setup where the ﬂow rate was
set to 0.5 ml/min during the SEC run but was reduced to 0.1 ml/
min during the elution of the protein to collect enough frames for
acceptable counting statistics [39].
3.3
Primary Data
Analysis
A number of freely available programs can be used for initial data
processing and analysis. This includes the ATSAS suite of programs
[27], SCATTER (http://bioisis.net/scatter), BioXTAS RAW [28],
and US-SOMO [29, 30].
SAXS Analysis of IDPs
253

The processing of SAXS data collected in batch mode is rela-
tively straightforward. The data is radially averaged and buffer
subtracted to typically generate three-column ASCII ﬁles in the
format q (momentum transfer), I(q) (intensity), and σ(q) (standard
deviation of intensity). All synchrotrons as well as in-house SAXS
systems are equipped with programs/scripts to perform these basic
operations. Checks for radiation damage are also included in the
programs that detect any signiﬁcant change in intensity proﬁles
between different frames.
For SEC-SAXS, more sophisticated and involved approaches
are required. A single SEC-SAXS experiment can output hundreds
to thousands of frames from which those corresponding to the
buffer and the sample need to be identiﬁed. A number of programs,
e.g., CHROMIXS [40] (available in ATSAS suite), SCATTTER,
BioXTAS RAW, and US-SOMO, allow for intuitive visualization
and user-friendly processing of the SEC-SAXS data. In our experi-
ence, a plot of average intensity vs. frame number is the most
intuitive way to select the buffer and sample frames. A region
where the average intensity is low and ﬂat is selected as buffer,
and the tip of the peak is chosen to represent the sample frames
(Fig. 2). The selected frames can be compared to ensure that they
are statistically similar [34, 41] (see Note 10). The Rg should then
be calculated for the selected sample frames after buffer subtrac-
tion. Ideally, the values of Rg should be very similar for all the
sample frames. A gradual decrease in Rg over the peak may indicate
insufﬁcient resolution of the components (Fig. 2). In such scenar-
ios, a part of the peak, which has a stable Rg, may be selected. An
alternative is to deconvolute the set of curves from the peak using
approaches available in US-SOMO or BioXTAS.

for two samples along with calculated Rgs (red dots). The frames selected for sample and buffer and

more species

Amin Sagar et al.

The buffer-subtracted SAXS curves obtained from either mode
(batch or SEC-SAXS) can be analyzed for the presence of
concentration-dependent effects and estimate the overall size/
shape parameters and extent of ﬂexibility using ATSAS suite, BioX-
TAS, or SCATTER, as explained in the following sections.
3.3.1
Checking
for Concentration-
Dependent Effects
The concentration-dependent effects such as aggregation, interpar-
ticle interactions, and oligomerization can be studied by estimating
the intensity at zero angle (I(0)), MW, and Rg at different concen-
trations. I(0) only depends on the MW and concentration of the
solute. Therefore, if the concentrations are available, the apparent
MW of the sample can be calculated. This can be done by either
using a protein standard with known molecular weight, e.g., lyso-
zyme and albumin, using Eq. (1) or transforming data into abso-
lute units using the scattering of water and Eq. (2):

here, MWp and MWst are the molecular weights of the sample (the
protein) and the standard with their corresponding I(0)s and their
concentrations denoted as I(0)p and I(0)st and cp and cst, respec-
tively. In Eq. (2), NA, Δρ, and ν denote Avogadro’s number, the
contrast, and partial speciﬁc volume of the protein, respectively (see
Note 11). Guinier analysis can be used to determine Rg as well as I
(0) by extrapolation with Eq. (3) (Fig. 3) (see Note 12):

In the ATSAS suite of programs, it can be done with the
PrimusQT program using the Radius of Gyration option in Analy-
sis tab. The same can be done in BioXTAS RAW using Manipula-
tion/Tools/Guinier Fit or in SCATTER using Analysis/G. An
increase in the values of concentration normalized I(0), MW, or
Rg indicates concentration-dependent aggregation, oligomeriza-
tion, or attractive interparticle interactions, while a decrease in
these parameters points to repulsive interparticle interactions.
3.3.2
Initial Estimates
of Flexibility
A number of initial analyses can provide an insight into the degree
of ﬂexibility of the proteins being studied. The Kratky plot (I
(q)  q2 versus q) is an excellent tool to qualitatively estimate the
degree of conformational disorder in a protein [15]. Globular pro-
teins display a bell-shaped curve with a clear peak, while ﬂexible
proteins display a plateau at high angles. The proteins having both
globular and ﬂexible parts can show a mixture of peak and plateau
or a peak that slowly decays depending on the proportion of
globular and ﬂexible parts [42]. The Kratky plot can be obtained
by changing the representation in PrimusQT (Plot/Kratky) and
BioXTAS RAW (right-click on plot/Kratky) or by using the Kratky
option in SCATTER (Analysis/kratky) (Fig. 4a).
The Kratky plot can be made semiquantitative by normalizing
it for protein size and molecular weight by plotting (qRg)2I
(q) vs. qRg [23]. In this dimensionless Kratky plot, all globular

proteins would have a maximum value of 1.104 at a qRg value of
1.73 (Fig. 4b). Highly ﬂexible proteins, however, have a plateau
between 1.5 and 2.0, and partially disordered proteins show an
intermediate proﬁle. Normalized Kratky plots can be obtained in
BioXTAS RAW by using Tools/Normalized Kratky Plots or in
SCATTER using Analysis/Normalized Kratky (Fig. 1c).
Another important tool to estimate the degree of compactness
of an IDP is the Flory relationship:
Rg ¼ R0N ν
ð4Þ
where N is the number of residues in the polymer chain; the
constant R0 depends on several factors, in particular on the persis-
tence length; and ν is an exponential scaling factor. For an
excluded-volume polymer, Flory estimated ν to be approximately
3/5, and more accurate estimates established a value of 0.588
[43]. A compilation of Rg values measured for 26 chemically dena-
tured proteins found a ν value of 0.598  0.028 and a R0 value of
1.927  0.27 [44]. Finally, simulated data based on a random coil
model for IDPs established R0 and ν to be 2.54  0.01 and
0.522  0.01, respectively [45]. Comparison of the experimental
Rg values with those derived from the parametrizations (Rg
RC)
provides an overall idea about the compaction level of IDPs in
solution. While Rg < Rg
RC indicates that the protein is more
compact than a random coil, Rg > Rg
RC suggests that the IDP is
more extended than a random coil. It can also be useful to derive
Flory’s exponent from the slope of the normalized Kratky plot at
high q range using a molecular
form-factor-based method
[46]. This service can be accessed online at http://sosnick.
uchicago.edu/SAXSonIDPs (Fig. 4c).
3.3.3
Pair-Wise Distance
Distribution Function
The pair-wise distance distribution function, P(r), is the histogram
of the distances between all the possible pairs of electrons within a
molecule. The P(r) is generally obtained with an indirect Fourier
transform of the intensity proﬁles using the assumptions that P(r) is
zero at r ¼ 0 and r ¼ Dmax, where Dmax is the maximum linear
dimension of the particle [47]. The P(r) can provide insight into
the shape of the protein and being a real-space representation, a
more intuitive view of the data. The P(r) is generally expected to
land smoothly in a concave fashion on the X-axis (Fig. 5). It should
be noted here that it might be difﬁcult to choose a single correct
Dmax. This is particularly true for IDPs, and an initial indication
might be taken from the Rg value derived from a Guinier analysis
(see Note 13). In PrimusQT, the P(r) distribution can be obtained
by using Distance Distribution button in the Analysis tab. The
lower and upper limits of the range can then be adjusted to exclude
the points showing an upward curve in the low-q region and highly
noisy part in the high-q region.
SAXS Analysis of IDPs
257

3.4
Ensemble
Optimization Method
for the Analysis
of SAXS Proﬁles
IDPs or proteins hosting large intrinsically disordered regions
(IDRs) adopt an astronomical number of conformations in solu-
tion. In the timescales used for SAXS data acquisition, the time-
averaged SAXS intensity is equivalent to an ensemble-averaged
intensity. Therefore, ﬂexible systems can be described in a more
suitable manner if they are considered as ensembles of conforma-
tions. The following section describes the analysis of SAXS data
obtained on highly ﬂexible proteins using ensemble optimization
method (EOM) [48, 49], which is a part of ATSAS suite of pro-
grams. Similar analyses can be done with other programs, e.g.,
minimal ensemble search (MES) [50], basis-set supported SAXS
(BSS-SAXS) [20], or ensemble reﬁnement of SAXS (EROS)
[21]. However, EOM is a more widely used program, and that is
why we describe it in more detail below. The EOM approach
consists of three steps:
1. Generation of a large ensemble of conformers representing the
conformational space sampled by the protein in solution (see
Notes 14 and 15).
2. Selection of a sub-ensemble of conformers that collectively
describes the SAXS data.
3. Description of the structural properties of the selected ensem-
ble including size and ﬂexibility.
In EOM, the program RanCh (Random Chain) handles the
ﬁrst step, i.e., generation of an ensemble, while the program
GAJOE (Genetic Algorithm Judging Optimization of Ensembles)
handles the latter two steps. These two programs can be run
automatically by using the program EOM or can be called upon
individually. The following section describes the usage of the
program EOM.

3.4.1
Generation of an
Ensemble of Conformations
1. The program can be started by issuing the command eom from
a terminal.
2. The interactive prompt allows deﬁning the core symmetry,
overall symmetry, and the percentage of symmetric structures
(see Note 16).
3. The ensembles can be generated with three levels of compact-
ness called compact chain, native, and random coil, in decreas-
ing order of compactness. Random coil uses a Cα dihedral
angle distribution consistent with chemically denaturated pro-
teins, while native uses a Cα dihedral angle distribution consis-
tent with disordered proteins. On average, random coil models
will be more extended than those deﬁned as native-like. The
compact option not only uses a Cα dihedral angle distribution
consistent with disordered proteins but also forces the gener-
ated structures to be more compact.
4. In case of IDPs with no globular domains, the program can be
executed by providing the sequence information in the form of
a one-letter code text ﬁle and a three-column SAXS intensity
proﬁle having momentum transfer (q), scattering intensity (I
(q)), and the associated experimental error or standard devia-
tion (σ(q)). Multiple SAXS curves (e.g., from deletion mutants)
can also be given to the program to be simultaneously ﬁtted by
the algorithm.
5. In case of proteins with globular domains with available struc-
tures/models and disordered regions, the number of globular
domains must be speciﬁed, and the structure(s) of the globular
domains can be supplied in the form of pdb ﬁles. In this case,
the ensemble would consist of the supplied structures of
domains in various orientations joined by the generated lin-
kers/unstructured regions. If these globular domains are
expected to obey a symmetry, the latter can be speciﬁed in the
core symmetry. In most cases, the overall symmetry is absent as
the full-length disordered portions are not expected to be
symmetric.
6. All or some of the supplied structures can be ﬁxed at their
original positions, i.e., the positions in the input pdb ﬁles, to
avoid generation of biologically nonsensical models.
7. If the distances between certain residues are known, they can be
fed into the program in the form of a contact ﬁle to constrain
these distances in the generated structures. An online tool can
be used to help in writing the contact conditions ﬁle (https://
www.embl-hamburg.de/biosaxs/atsas-online/contacts.php).
8. A large number of models should be generated in order to
adequately sample the different sizes and shapes adopted by the
biomolecule in solution to be then subjected to selection by the
SAXS Analysis of IDPs
259

genetic algorithm in the next step. Ten thousand models are
generally sufﬁcient for most systems (see Note 15).
9. After execution, RanCh produces the following output ﬁles:
(a)
junX.eom: This ﬁle contains the theoretical intensity pro-
ﬁles of all the generated models. X stands for the preﬁx of
the generated pdb ﬁles that can be speciﬁed during the
execution of the program.
(b)
RanchX.log: This log ﬁle contains all the parameters used
for running RanCh.
(c)
Size_listX.txt: This ﬁle contains the values of Rg and Dmax
for all the conformations generated by RanCh.
3.4.2
Selection of a
Sub-ensemble
of Conformations that
Describes the SAXS Data
1. The generated ensemble is then fed to GAJOE to select a
sub-ensemble that best describes the measured SAXS data.
The program tries to ﬁnd a set of N conformations whose
average theoretical SAXS proﬁle (Eq. (5))
I q

The size of the sub-ensemble can either be set to a ﬁxed
number or be optimized during the minimization procedure.
While minimizing the number of conformations to describe
the data is a useful approach for proteins/complexes adopting a
few well-deﬁned conformations, this restriction may not be
optimal for describing the behavior of IDPs, and setting the
ensemble size to a ﬁxed, relatively large number between
20 and 50 is recommended (see Note 17).
2. The output ﬁles generated after the execution of GAJOE con-
tain the information about the parameters used for running the
program and quantitative description of the structural proper-
ties of the ensemble. For each experimental curve, a numbered
folder with the name curve_m is generated, where m is the
number in the order in which the curves were supplied. A brief
description of the output ﬁles is as follows:
(a)
GA00n/curve_m/logFile_00n_m.log: A log ﬁle containing
the parameters used to run the genetic algorithm.

the same format as (c) but presents the excluded volumes
instead of Rg.

Statistics_ﬂexibility.svg: This scalable vector graphics (svg)
ﬁle has the values of Rﬂex, Rσ, and standard mathematical
descriptors of distributions: standard deviation, average
absolute deviation, kurtosis, skewness, and geometric
average. Standard deviation is a measure of the variation
of the distribution from the average. Average absolute
deviation is the average of the absolute deviation from
the average value. For normal distributions, it is expected
to be ~0.8 times the standard deviation. Kurtosis and
skewness measure the “peakedness” and asymmetry of
the
probability
distribution,
respectively.
Geometric
mean is a measure of the central tendency, deﬁned as the
nth root of the product of n numbers. The meaning of the
metrics Rﬂex and Rsigma is described later in more detail.
(h)
GA00n/curve_m/pdbs: This folder contains the structures
of the conformations comprising the best-ﬁtting sub-en-
semble in PDB format.
3. It is a good practice to perform several EOM runs with an
increasing number of conformations in the sub-ensemble
(Fig. 6). Rg and Dmax distributions derived from this analysis
should stay similar, indicating that the information about the
overall size and shape of the protein in solution is captured by
the approach. Note that when using reduced number of con-
formations in the sub-ensemble, more spiky distributions may
be obtained.

3.4.3
Quantitative
Estimation of Flexibility
of the Ensemble
1. The comparison of the Rg/Dmax/Volume distributions of the
selected sub-ensembles with those of the initial pools provides
important insights into the size and ﬂexibility of the biomole-
cule (see Notes 18 and 19). The width of the distribution
indicates the size variability of the selected structures and is
therefore indicative of ﬂexibility. In other words, molecules
that are more ﬂexible give rise to broader distributions. The
position of the peak of the distribution conveys the size of the
sub-ensemble relative to the pool of randomly generated struc-
tures. For example, a shift of the peak position toward smaller
Rgs indicates that the molecule adopts more compact confor-
mations than the randomly generated structures and vice-versa.
The presence of multiple peaks indicates coexistence of multi-
ple conformational/associational states (see the example of
Ref. [51]).
2. EOM also outputs two metrics called Rﬂex and Rσ in order to
quantitatively compare the distributions of the selected
sub-ensemble to the total pool. Rﬂex is a measure of the infor-
mation content of the distribution. Narrower distributions
generally have more information than wider distributions.
EOM expresses Rﬂex in the form of a percentage ranging
from 0% (no ﬂexibility, single rigid structure) to 100%
(as much ﬂexibility as in the total pool). The second metric,
Rσ, illustrates the variance of the selected sub-ensemble with
respect to the total pool. Rσ approaches 1.0 when the selected
ensemble is almost as ﬂexible as the total pool. EOM solutions
are acceptable when Rﬂex of the selected sub-ensemble is smal-
ler than that of the pool and Rσ < 1.0 indicating a more
compact set of conformations than the pool or Rﬂex of the
selected sub-ensemble is more than that of the pool and
Fig. 6 EOM results using different sub-ensemble size. The distribution of (a Rg and b) Dmax for EOM analysis of
Unique domain of Src kinase with ﬁxed number of conformations in the sub-ensemble ranging from 5 to 50. It
can be seen that the distributions are spikier with a small number of conformation and become smoother with
increasing the number of conformations. However, increasing the number of conformations in the ensemble
does not give rise to any artifacts like artiﬁcial bimodality (or multimodality). The gray area represents the
distributions of the pool
262
Amin Sagar et al.

Rσ > 1.0 indicating a highly ﬂexible set of conformations.
However, a combination of signiﬁcantly smaller Rﬂex of the
sub-ensemble compared to the pool and Rσ > 1 makes a
warning sign and rather points to poor data quality.

Notes
1. The sample volume required for a single measurement in the
older generation synchrotrons and in-house instruments is
about 50 μl. In modern, high-brilliance synchrotrons, the sam-
ple requirement is reduced to ~20 μl, and it can be further
reduced to sub-μl range with the introduction of microﬂuidic
devices.
2. The buffer composition must exactly match the composition of
the sample: even small differences in the chemical composition
between the buffer and the sample may lead to severe artifacts
after background subtraction. Our preferred option is to use
the last dialysis buffer for the background measurements.
Phosphate buffers should be avoided in favor of TRIS,
MOPS, or MES, which scavenge the free radicals formed due
to radiation. Addition of 3–5% glycerol and/or 1–2 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT) is further recommended to limit the radi-
ation damage.
3. Columns with smaller void volume can save beam time but can
sometimes compromise on the resolution. The choice of the
column should be based on the purpose of the experiment and
the size of the protein/complex. SEC runs should be done
prior to the allocated beam time to conﬁrm that the column
provides the desired resolution.
4. The concentration needs to be determined precisely to have an
accurate estimate of the molecular weight. The Bradford assays
are generally not accurate enough for this purpose, and spec-
trophotometric methods (absorbance at 280 nm) are more
suitable. Refractrometers can be used for proteins lacking aro-
matic amino acids (a situation common for many IDPs) [52].
5. High-brilliance synchrotrons enable fast measurements but can
also induce radiation damage in the samples, which can be a
major obstacle in collecting good-quality SAXS data. Radiation
damage refers to the irreversible aggregation, unfolding, or
fragmentation of the proteins induced by high energy and
ﬂux of the X-ray beam striking the sample. The process is
initiated by the photolysis of water leading to generation of
free hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals which quickly react
with the backbone and side chains of proteins [53–55]. This
problem is partially addressed at the synchrotrons by collecting
SAXS Analysis of IDPs
263

data under continuous ﬂow. Suitable solvent additives can
further reduce the radiation damage. A detailed study of the
use of additives for reducing radiation damage in SAXS experi-
ments can be found in Ref. [55]. If, for some reason, such
additives cannot be used, increasing the ﬂow rate might be
helpful.
6. It is crucial to collect SAXS data at different protein concentra-
tions to ascertain the absence of any concentration-dependent
effects. Typically, 3–5 concentrations are studied. If the protein
is prone to aggregation, it is strongly advised to bring the
sample to the synchrotron at low concentration and concen-
trate on site. After concentrating, the sample should be centri-
fuged, concentration remeasured, and SAXS data collected as
soon as possible to minimize the presence of aggregates.
7. The sample to be studied with SAXS must be highly pure and
monodisperse. The contaminants of higher molecular weight
are especially undesirable because the scattering signal is pro-
portional to the square of molecular weight. Therefore, even
small quantities of high-molecular-weight contaminants can
dominate
the
scattering.
Purity
can
be
assessed
by
SDS-PAGE, and contamination by nucleic acids can usually
be detected by checking the ratio of absorbance at 280 and
260 nm. However, SDS-PAGE is not suitable to identify the
presence of aggregates and other techniques; e.g., native
PAGE, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifuga-
tion must be used. SEC can be employed to both check for and
remove the aggregated protein. A non-aggregated sample col-
lected from the SEC should be rerun on the column after
concentration (if required), to check if it stays in the
non-aggregated form. In case of proteins, where aggregation
is detected after concentrating the non-aggregated fraction,
the use of SEC-SAXS mode is highly recommended.
8. It is extremely important to have an accurate scattering proﬁle
from the buffer for subtraction. The over- or underestimation
of the contribution from the buffer can lead to artifacts in the
analyses. The best practice is to dialyze the concentrated pro-
tein against the appropriate buffer and use the dialysate as blank
for the buffer subtraction. Generally, the scattering data on the
buffer is collected before and after each sample.
9. The buffer composition should be chosen to yield close-to-
ideal solutions minimizing the interactions between the protein
molecules, unless otherwise is desired. The concentration of
salts should be kept to the minimum required for the solubility
of the protein. The presence of salts/additives in the buffer
decreases the contrast between the protein and the buffer and
can negatively impact the data quality. Typically, NaCl
264
Amin Sagar et al.

concentrations more than 0.5 M and glycerol more than 10%
should be avoided. Crowding agents like polyethylene glycol
(PEG) can be used if the purpose is to study the effect of
molecular crowding which can be of relevance to systems
with IDPs. SAXS studies in the presence of PEG have been
conducted to understand the effect of crowding on the confor-
mation of RNA helicase elF4A [56], RNA (a bacterial group I
ribozyme) [57], and complex of DNA polymerase (gp5) with
its processivity factor (trx) and helicase-primase (gp4D) com-
plex along with DNA [58].
10. The pairwise CorMap can be used to assess the similarity of the
frames selected as buffer and sample [41]. For a set of similar
frames, the CorMap will show a random pattern without any
speciﬁc features. However, if the frames are different, the pair-
wise CorMap would show patches with positive and negative
correlations. Pairwise CorMap analysis can be performed by
opening the frames selected in CHROMIXS in Primus (ﬁle/
open selected frames in Primus) and using the Data Compari-
son option in Primus (Processing/Data Comparison). The
p-value can then be used to determine if the frames are signiﬁ-
cantly different.
11. The partial speciﬁc volume of the protein, ν, can be calculated
experimentally by densitometry or estimated on the basis of the
sequence using the program SEDNTERP (http://bitcwiki.sr.
unh.edu/index.php/Main_Page). The contrast can be calcu-
lated using the relation Δρ ¼ (ρprot  ρsolvν)ro, where ρprot is
the number of electrons per mass of dry protein and ρsolv is the
number of electrons per volume of the solvent.
12. The Guinier approximation is considered to be valid for a
momentum transfer range of q < 1.3  Rg for well-folded
proteins. This range can lead to smaller Rgs for IDPs, and a
smaller range of s < 1.1  Rg has been suggested [59]. A
fourth-order correction to the Guinier approximation has
also been suggested to have better estimates of Rg for IDPs
and increase the range to ~q < 1.5  Rg [60].
13. A relatively small population of highly extended conformations
may lead to an underestimation of Dmax for IDPs as derived
from the primary analysis of the SAXS data [42, 61].
14. All methods ensuring exhaustive sampling of the conforma-
tional space can be used to generate the initial pool of con-
formations,
e.g.,
long
timescale
or
enhanced
sampling
molecular
dynamics
(MD)
simulations,
kinematics-based
methods (RRT programs from IMP (http://salilab.org/imp/
download.html)), coil database building strategies [62–64],
dihedral angle sampling (SASSIE [65]), and Monte Carlo
methods. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are often
SAXS Analysis of IDPs
265

considered a less suitable way to generate ensembles due to
limited exploration of the conformational space and inaccuracy
of the force ﬁelds. However, recent improvements in the hard-
ware and force ﬁelds make MD-based strategies also appropri-
ate for the generation of IDP ensembles [66].
15. In our experience, 10,000 models generated by RanCh sufﬁce
to have an adequate sampling of the overall descriptors of the
molecule like Rg and Dmax in almost all situations. This is
adequate to describe the SAXS data, which is inherently low
resolution. Certainly, the sampling is not sufﬁcient at an atomic
level as IDPs can adopt an astronomically large number of
conformations that cannot be exhaustively sampled by any of
the methods.
16. The ﬁrst prompt while running EOM asks the user for the core
symmetry. The supported symmetries are p1 to p19 (from no
symmetry to 19-fold), p22, p32, p42. . ., p122, and p222. The
second prompt asks for the overall symmetry of the particle.
The acceptable answers are S (for generating only symmetric
structures), A (for generating structures which have the speci-
ﬁed core symmetric but no symmetry for the rest of the parti-
cle), and M (for a mixture of symmetric and asymmetric
particles). If [M]ix is selected for overall symmetry, then the
next prompt asks for the percentage of symmetric structures in
the pool, where entering a value of 50, for example, will lead of
a pool with 50% each of symmetric and asymmetric structures.
17. While running GAJOE, we ﬁx the number of conformations in
the sub-ensemble by setting both maximum and minimum
number of conformations per ensemble to the same ﬁxed
value (e.g., 20) and not allowing curve repetition.
18. It might be noted that the repeated cycles of EOM can con-
verge to different individual conformations, which is expected
given the low resolution of SAXS data. However, the distribu-
tion of the overall shape and size parameters (Rg and Dmax) of
the sub-ensembles selected by EOM should be similar.
19. The results of EOM should be interpreted with care. The
selected conformations should not be treated as the actual
conformations adopted by an IDP in the solution. Instead,
the distributions of the low-resolution parameters of the
selected ensemble such as Rg and Dmax should be considered
as the structural description of the conformations adopted by
the protein in solution.

Chapter 13
Determining Rg of IDPs from SAXS Data
Ellen Rieloff and Marie Skepo¨
Abstract
There is a great interest within the research community to understand the structure–function relationship
for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs); however, the heterogeneous distribution of conformations that
IDPs can adopt limits the applicability of conventional structural biology methods. Here, scattering
techniques, such as small-angle X-ray scattering, can contribute. In this chapter, we will describe how to
make a model-free determination of the radius of gyration by using two different approaches, the Guinier
analysis and the pair distance distribution function. The ATSAS package (Franke et al., J Appl Crystallogr
50:1212–1225, 2017) has been used for the evaluation, and throughout the chapter, different examples
will be given to illustrate the discussed phenomena, as well as the pros and cons of using the different
approaches.

Introduction
In contrast to well-folded proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs) sample a broad ensemble of rapidly interconverting con-
formations. This intrinsic ﬂexibility can make it complicated to
study IDPs and intrinsically disordered regions using traditional
biophysical techniques. In recent years, small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) has emerged among the methods that are useful for char-
acterizing IDPs, since it gives information about the interatomic
distances within a biomolecule. The radius of gyration (Rg) is the
root-mean-square distance between the different atoms of the IDP
and its center of mass and gives information about the average
degree of expansion (see Eq. (1), as well as the schematic illustration
in Fig. 1).

In Eq. (1), n is equal to the number of atoms, whereas ri and rcm
correspond to the coordinates of the atoms and the center of mass
of the molecule, respectively. When determined in SAXS analysis,
Rg corresponds to the root-mean-square of the distance of all
electrons from the center of mass of the protein, when the back-
ground electrons, i.e., the electrons in the buffer, have been
subtracted.
Rg is a useful quantity to monitor when studying how the
system is affected by varying the solvent conditions, as well as the
sequences of IDPs [1–4]. If the sample of interest is polydisperse,
then a more in-depth understanding can be obtained by monitor-
ing Rg while using SAXS in combination with high-performance
liquid chromatography [5]. In this chapter, we assume that the
reader has already collected SAXS data and completed the initial
processing of the scattering intensity, I(q). The magnitude of the
scattering vector, q, is deﬁned as q ¼ 4πsinθ/λ, from the scattering
angle, 2θ, and the wavelength, λ.
There are many different methods available for determining Rg
from SAXS. Here, two different approaches will be described:
(1) the Guinier approximation [6] and (2) the pair distance distri-
bution function, P(r). The former states that for very small scatter-
ing angles, the scattering intensity depends only on two parameters,
I(0) and Rg:
IðqÞ ¼ Ið0Þexp

where I(0) is the forward scattering (the scattering intensity extra-
polated to q ¼ 0). In practice, this means that the scattering

square of the distance of the different atoms from the center of mass. The black

intensity plotted as lnI(q) versus q2 should be a linear function for a
particle of any shape, where the slope holds information about Rg.
The validity of the Guinier method can be characterized by the
product qmaxRg, where qmax is the largest value of q used in the
linear regression. As a rule of thumb, for folded proteins, it is
known that the approximation is valid up to qmaxRg  1.3 [7, 8],
whereas when applied to IDPs, the corresponding number is
qmaxRg  1.1 [9], or even as small as qmaxRg < 0.8 [10]. Attractive
interactions between the IDPs, and nonspeciﬁc aggregates, result in
an overestimation of Rg, whereas repulsive interactions between the
proteins (see Note 1) give rise to the opposite. The second
approach uses the pair distance distribution function, which in
real space is a histogram of the distances, r, between all possible
pairs of electrons within the protein. The scattering pattern, I(q), is
a Fourier transform of its P(r) function, and vice versa:

ð Þ ¼ r2

ð3Þ
By deﬁnition, P(r) equals zero at P(0), is nonnegative, termi-
nates smoothly at the maximum dimension Dmax, and is zero for
r > Dmax. The P(r) function can be assessed from the experimental
scattering data using indirect Fourier transformation [11, 12], and
Rg can be determined from the P(r) using the following equation:
R2

The P(r) distribution often gives a more reliable estimate over
the Guinier approximation. This is more pronounced for IDPs
[13], since the full scattering pattern is taken into consideration.
A caveat is that the more extended the protein is, the greater is the
requirement for experimental data to be collected at smaller angles,
i.e., closer to the primary beam.
The two approaches discussed above will be described in detail
in Subheading 3 (step-by-step procedure), before showing exam-
ples of how they can be applied in the ATSAS package [14]. For a
comment on the notations and units used in this chapter and in the
ATSAS package, see Note 2.

Materials
The SAXS data used for the examples in this chapter have all been
collected at BM29 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radia-
tion Facility (ESRF), in Grenoble, France. SAXS data for the disor-
dered small protein, Histatin 5, has been applied in the examples
except for Figs. 3 and 7, where data from measurements of the

ation of the data. Installation packages for Windows, Linux, and

Methods
The Guinier analysis allows model-free determination of Rg from
scattering data in the limit of very small scattering angles. The

shows the linear relation between lnI(q) and q2, where, when lnI(q)
is plotted against q2, lnI(0) corresponds to the intercept and
R2
g=3 to the slope, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Since the maximum
usable q-value can vary between different IDPs, it is of importance
to try different values (see Note 3) and gain experience. The
approximation is only valid if the region is linear and nonlinearity
in the lowest q-region signalizes interparticle interactions. Hence, a
Guinier plot serves as an important check of protein–protein inter-
action. An upturn at low q indicates interparticle attraction, i.e.,
presence of aggregates, while a downturn indicates interparticle
repulsion, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The general steps of performing

3.2
Determination
of Rg of Histatin 5 by
the Guinier Approach
Using PRIMUS
1. Open the scattering data using PRIMUS. Switch to the “Anal-
ysis” tab and press “Radius of Gyration.” This launches a new
window, showing the data plotted as ln(I) versus q2 in the
low-q regime, as well as the corresponding residuals. Additional
information shown is I(0) and Rg with error estimates (see
Note 4), the qRg limits, and the data range given in data
point indices.
2. Automatically, the program runs AUTORG, a routine for Rg
determination; hence, the values stated correspond to this
automatic procedure. A description of the automatic procedure
is found in the ATSAS manual. The result of AUTORG for
Histatin 5 is given in the left-hand panel of Fig. 4.
3. For a manual adjustment of Rg, the q-range can be changed to
ﬁnd the best linear ﬁt. If there is curvature in the residuals, i.e.,
nonlinear behavior, the range should be reduced, from both
directions if necessary. Start by adjusting the left limit to
exclude any largely deviating points. Continue with reducing
the right limit until qRg < 1.1 or more if the residuals are still
showing nonlinear behavior. The goal is for the residuals to be
evenly distributed around zero. The result of manually ﬁtting
the data of Histatin 5 is shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 4.

Determination of Rg
275

In contrast to the Guinier approximation, which only uses the
low-q region, determination of Rg from P(r) relies on more or less
the entire collected SAXS spectrum. The pair distance distribution
function is the real space transformation of the intensity curve and
can be obtained by the indirect Fourier transform method [11, 12]
that is implemented, for example, in GNOM in the ATSAS package
and in the Web application BayesApp (http://www.bayesapp.org).
Other software also includes methods for obtaining the P(r), for
example, SasView (http://www.sasview.org) and ScA˚ tter (available
at www.bioisis.net). From P(r) and the maximum dimension of the
protein, Dmax, Rg can be calculated according to Eq. (4) and is
usually given as an output from the software used. In Subheading
3.3, the steps in determining Rg by the pair distance distribution
function are shown for Histatin 5 in PRIMUS. Other programs
require different procedures (see Note 5).
3.3
Determination
of the Pair Distance
Distribution Function
in PRIMUS
1. Open the scattering data in PRIMUS. Switch to the “Analysis”
tab and press “Distance Distribution.” This opens a new win-
dow with two panels, initially showing the result from AUTO-
GNOM, the automatic calculation of P(r). The right panel
shows the distance distribution, while the left panel shows the

back-transformed intensity from the distance distribution
together with the experimental scattering data. Each adjust-
ment in the graphical interface will call the program GNOM,
and the result will be presented. For IDPs, manual modiﬁca-
tion is normally necessary since the automatic process often
gives a too abrupt decrease to zero at large r, as exempliﬁed in
Fig. 5a. The goal is to ﬁnd a P(r) that smoothly increases from
r ¼ 0 and terminates smoothly at the maximum dimension. A
typical P(r) of an IDP has an extended tail due to its ability to
form a variety of conformations, where the tail corresponds to
an almost fully stretched out protein. This is in contrary to
globular proteins, which show a rather symmetric bell-shaped
curve due to its less ﬂexible and more compact conformation.
2. If the scattering in the high-q region is overly noisy, that part
can be excluded by reducing the range.
3. Unclick “rmax ¼ 0,” which will release the restrain that P(r)
should be zero at the maximum pair distance, Dmax. This gives
the P(r) shown in Fig. 5b, illustrating the need of a larger Dmax.
4. Increase Dmax until the P(r) smoothly approaches zero at larger
r; see Fig. 5c. If that does not occur, the scattering data might
be affected by interparticle interference (see Note 6) or suffer
from poor buffer matching (see Note 7). Click “rmax ¼ 0” again
to ensure complete decrease to zero.
5. To check the quality of the solution, try to increase Dmax even
further. Ideally, I(0) and Rg should be stable, and the P(r)
should be zero beyond Dmax found in step 4. In addition, the
back-transformed intensity should ﬁt the experimental scatter-
ing curve.
6. Repeat the process with a different range on the input data. If
the result is approximately the same, this indicates a good
solution and quality of your data set.
It is good practice to compare the results from the Guinier
analysis and the P(r), but without letting one approach inﬂuence
the ﬁtting of the other, and thereby check for self-consistency of the
scattering data. Ideally, the results from the two methods should
agree. The limitations of the methods are further described (see
Note 8).

Notes
1. High protein concentrations of highly charged IDPs will give
rise to repulsion detectable in the SAXS data even at high ionic
strength (150 mM). Therefore, to obtain reliable estimates of
Rg, lower protein concentrations should be used, and the effect
of protein concentration should be checked by performing
measurements in a concentration series.
Determination of Rg
277

2. Instead of q, the ATSAS package uses s as the notation for the
magnitude of the scattering vector, although the deﬁnitions are
identical. Usually the measured SAXS data is given with the
unit nm1 for q; however, it can easily be converted to A˚ 1, as

has been done with the data in this chapter. It is important to
notice that the units of the output from PRIMUS depend on
the units of the input; hence, if q is given in A˚ 1, the calculated
Rg is given in A˚ , whereas if q is given in nm1, the Rg is given in
nm. The same applies to the unit of length in the pair distance
distribution function.
3. The determined Rg is dependent on the q-range used, as illu-
strated for Histatin 5 in Fig. 6. The Guinier analysis has been
shown to systematically underestimate Rg of IDPs for a ﬁtting
range limited by qmaxRg  1.3; hence, it is important to use a
qmaxRg  1.1. The suitable range depends on both the protein
sequence and the solvent conditions, and as a rule of thumb,
the larger the deviations are from a sphere, the smaller ﬁtting
range can be used. Notice that for small peptides such as
Histatin 5, more data points can be used than for a larger
protein; hence, for longer IDPs, the uncertainty can be large
when reducing the ﬁtting range. If a larger qmax is required,
there are alternative methods available for IDPs, such as the
Debye function or the extended Guinier analysis. The Debye
function [18]:
IðqÞ=Ið0Þ ¼
2
ðqRgÞ4 ½expððqRgÞ2Þ  1 þ ðqRgÞ2,
ð6Þ
is an analytical expression for the form factor of a Gaussian
chain. It has been shown to be applicable to disordered and
denatured proteins in the qRg  3 range [19], at least if their
behavior is close to that of a Gaussian chain. If the IDP in
question has a larger deviation from Gaussian chain behavior, a
restricted range of qRg < 1.4 can be more suitable [13].
The Gaussian chain behavior is characterized by a Flory
exponent of 0.5, and recently, Zheng and Best showed that the

deviation from the Guinier approximation is related to the
Flory exponent. They developed an extension of the Guinier
approximation by including an extra higher-order term, depen-
dent on the Flory exponent, υ [20]:

By introducing a dependence between Rg and ν based on a
self-avoiding walk, there are only two free parameters in the
ﬁtting. The dependence is described by the following equation:

The term γ  1.1615 [21], the prefactor b  0.55 nm for
proteins [22], and N is the number of peptide bonds in the
chain. This extended Guinier analysis was shown to be applica-
ble up to qmaxRg  2 [20].
4. The AUTORG process performs Guinier analysis on multiple
intervals within the suitable Guinier range, before selecting the
best ﬁt. The presented error, however, takes into account both
the error in the best ﬁt and the error of other possible intervals
and thereby accounts for systematic errors in Rg to a certain
extent. When the Guinier ﬁt is manually adjusted, the error is
determined only based on the ﬁt in the selected range and, as a
consequence, becomes underestimated. For more information,
please see the article by Svergun et al. [23].
5. A guide on how to use ScA˚ tter to determine the P(r) distribu-
tion can be found at www.bioisis.net. The Web application
BayesApp does not require any other input than the data ﬁle
and has in the authors’ experience worked well for IDPs.
6. Interparticle interference in the P(r) can be visible in the large
r-region, i.e., low-q region. In the case of repulsive interactions,
P(r) decreases below zero as shown in Fig. 7a, which can lead
to an underestimated Dmax if determined to where P(r) crosses
r ¼ 0. In the case of aggregation, P(r) will instead have pro-
blems reaching r ¼ 0, which is shown as a long tail that never
reaches zero or, alternatively, as a bump at the end instead of a
smooth decline—see Fig. 7b. In both cases, the data is of
insufﬁcient quality and, hence, should not be used.
7. As stated, poor buffer subtraction can give a bump in the P(r),
similarly to the presence of aggregates in the sample. Buffer
mismatching in the low-q region also inﬂuences the Guinier
analysis, and hence, for an accurate determination of Rg, it is
important to ensure a good matching of the buffer. General

measurements and how to check the buffer matching can be
found in, for example, the following references [24–26].
8. The Guinier analysis is performed only in the low-q regime,
compared to the P(r) approach which uses more or less the full
scattering curve. Thus, the Guinier analysis is more susceptible
to experimental noise, which gives rise to larger uncertainties in
the determined Rg. In addition (see also Note 3), the Guinier
analysis is also known to underestimate the Rg if qmax is too
large; hence, the P(r) approach can be considered as more
reliable. However, the reproducibility of the Guinier analysis
is usually better, since it is an easier method to use. Especially if
extensive manual adjustment is made to P(r), the result can
vary between users. Therefore, the authors recommend pre-
senting the results from both methods, especially since agree-
ment signalizes consistency of the data.

Obtaining Hydrodynamic Radii of Intrinsically Disordered
Protein Ensembles by Pulsed Field Gradient NMR
Measurements
Sarah Leeb and Jens Danielsson
Abstract
In the disordered state, a protein exhibits a high degree of structural freedom, in both space and time. For
an ensemble of disordered or unfolded proteins, this means that the ensemble comprises a high diversity of
structures, ranging from compact collapsed states to fully extended polypeptide chains. In addition, each
chain is highly dynamic and undergoes conformational changes and local dynamics on both fast and slow
timescales. The size properties of disordered proteins are thus best described as ensemble averages. A
straightforward measure of the size is the hydrodynamic radius, RH, of the ensemble. Since the disordered
state is conformationally ﬂuid, the observed RH does not refer to a particular shape or fold. Instead, it
should be interpreted as a measure for the average compaction of the structural ensemble. In addition to
characterizing the disordered ensemble itself, RH can be used to, with good precision, monitor changes in
the ensemble size properties upon functional interactions of the disordered protein, e.g., dimerization,
ligand binding, and folding pathways. Here, we present a step-by-step protocol for diffusion measurements
using pulsed ﬁeld gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR) spectroscopy. We describe how to
calibrate the magnetic ﬁeld gradient and offer different schemes for sample preparation. Finally, we describe
how to obtain RH directly from the diffusion coefﬁcient as well as from using an internal standard as a
reference.

Introduction
The disordered protein ensemble—whether it is the unfolded state
of an otherwise folded protein, intrinsically disordered proteins, or
artiﬁcially denatured proteins—is a generically heterogeneous,
highly dynamic entity. Typically, the physical properties of such an
ensemble of structures have to be deﬁned as ensemble averages or
time averages, since snapshots of a single highly dynamic protein
chain lack physical relevance (Fig. 1) [1–4]. The size of the disor-
dered ensemble, i.e., how it extends in space, can be described

using classical polymer statistical physics, where the individual
amino acids are treated as mean ﬁeld monomers, with limited
speciﬁc properties. Using this formalism, the end-to-end distance
and radii of gyration (Rg) for unfolded polypeptides under various
conditions can be estimated [5, 6], and the size can be shown to
obey simple power laws of the length of the protein. For example,
Rg ¼ α0M α1, where M can be the molecular mass of the protein [7]
or the number of residues [8, 9], α0 is a pre-factor depending
mainly on the monomer size and persistence length [8], and, ﬁnally,
α1 is the exponent reporting on the extendedness (or compaction)
of the chain ensemble [5, 10, 8]. The exponent α1 is dependent on
the interaction between the solvent and the monomers in the
polypeptide and ranges from α1  0.3 for a compact folded state
to α1 ¼ 0.59 for an extended state in a good solvent [3, 7–9]. For
the unfolded or disordered state of proteins, α1 typically ranges
from 0.4 to 0.59 depending on the sequence composition [11] and
the solvent [3, 8].
The radius of gyration is linked to the hydrodynamic radius
(RH) in a nontrivial way. For the folded, globular state, they scale
linearly, RH ¼ κRg, where κ relates to the hydration layer [12]. In
contrast, no simple link exists for the unfolded or disordered state,
but empirical relationships between Rg and RH have been sug-
gested [13, 14]. The hydrodynamic radius is, in turn, directly
Fig. 1 The disordered ensemble. The size of a folded and an unfolded protein can be related to its
hydrodynamic radius, RH. For the folded state in (a), the structural ensemble is very homogeneous and yields
a narrow distribution of hydrodynmic radii, shown as the blue distribution in (c). The hydrodynamic size of the
disordered state (b) is on the other hand much more heterogeneous and less intuitively deﬁned. The orange
circles in (c) correspond to the radius of a sphere that diffuses with the same speed as the unfolded
poypeptide that it encloses. The heterogeneous ensemble of structures results in a wide size distribution
for the disordered ensemble shown in (c). PFG NMR determination of the hydrodynamic radius from the
diffusion coefﬁcient does not give information on the width of the distribution but merely reports on the
ensemble average, i.e., the peak of the distribution (indicated by black arrows)

linked to how the disordered ensemble diffuses in a solvent, and
translational diffusion measurements have been widely applied
when it comes to the biophysical characterization of proteins as it
can be used to estimate the hydrodynamic (or Stokes) radius of,
e.g., a disordered protein ensemble [15, 16]. Relating the hydro-
dynamic radius to the translational diffusion coefﬁcient (Dt) is
based on that a particle undergoing Brownian motion in a solvent
will be exposed to opposing frictional forces ( f ) [17], depending
on solvent microscopic viscosity (η) as well as the size and shape of
the particle. In case of disordered proteins, the ensemble is a
distribution of both sizes and shapes that will result in ensemble-
averaged (or time-averaged) diffusion behavior (Fig. 1). Transla-
tional diffusion can be quantiﬁed by the mean square displacement
per time unit, hz2i ¼ 6DtΔt, where the Stokes-Einstein equation
relates Dt to RH [17]:
Dt ¼ kBT
f
¼
kBT
6πηRH
ð1Þ
where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. For
the disordered ensemble, the bulk hydrodynamic radius is the
ensemble average of the distribution of sizes and shapes and corre-
sponds to the radius of a sphere that diffuses at the measured rate
through a solvent of viscosity η. The shape dependence becomes
particularly apparent, when comparing the hydrodynamic radii of a
folded and unfolded version of the same protein. Despite having
the exact same mass, their hydrodynamic radii will differ substan-
tially due to the unfolded chain being much more extended
(Fig. 1).
Direct determination of translational diffusion is nowadays
routinely performed using pulsed ﬁeld gradient NMR (PFG
NMR)
spectroscopy,
a
method
developed
already
in
the
mid-1960s by Stejskal and Tanner [18]. The method relies on a
simple spin-echo but with a position-dependent phase labeling
within the echo. In short, the method can be described as follows:
After transferring the magnetization to the xy-plane, the spins of a
molecule are given a position-dependent phase label by applying a
magnetic ﬁeld gradient (Fig. 2). In this way, the total magnetic ﬁeld
strength that individual spins are exposed to will vary depending on
their position in the sample, and as a consequence, their coherence
and the resulting magnetization are lost. For a gradient along the z-
axis, the phase shift ϕ ¼ γgz, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, g is
the gradient strength, and z is the spin position in z-direction in the
detection volume. Immediately applying a gradient of reverse
amplitude but same strength would then refocus the spin coher-
ence with minimal signal loss (Fig. 2) and a total phase given by
Δϕ ¼ γgz + γ(g)z ¼ 0. In diffusion measurements, however, a time
delay is introduced between the two opposing gradient pulses,
Translational Diffusion of IDPs
287

allowing the molecule (and therefore the spins) to move in space.
When the refocusing gradient pulse is applied, the positions of the
spins are changed due to Brownian motions, and the coherence is
not fully refocused, which is manifested as a loss of signal (Fig. 2).
The total phase shift is then Δϕ ¼ γgz1 + γ(g)z2 6¼ 0, if z1 6¼ z2.
Hence, the more rapidly the signal decays as a function of delay
Fig. 2 Determining the diffusion coefﬁcient by NMR. Schematic overview of the PFG NMR experiment for
determination of the diffusion coefﬁcient, Dt. In the top panel, the simpliﬁed pulse sequence is shown,
including the basic necessary elements. The black rectangles are hard pulses, with a narrow rectangle
corresponding to a 90 and the wider rectangle to a 180 pulse, and the gray half oblates correspond to the
gradient pulses with an arbitrary shape with length δ, separated by the diffusion delay Δ. In the scheme, all
chemical shift defocusing has been omitted, and only phase shifts from the gradients are included. Any
chemical shift defocusing will be refocused at the end of the echo where the FID is recorded. The second lane
shows the effect on a non-diffusing spin, which in block a, directly after a 90 pulse is in the xy-plane,
perpendicular to the static magnetic ﬁeld. In block b, the gradient pulse gives the spin a position-dependent
phase shift, ϕ. In block c, the 180 pulse has inverted the phase, which effectively alters the sign of the phase
shift to ϕ. In block c, the spin experiences the exact same gradient pulse again, as the position in the z-
direction is unchanged. As a result, the same phase label is given, and since –ϕ + ϕ ¼ 0, it is
perfectly refocused. In the case of free diffusion during the delay Δ, shown in the third lane, the spins change
place between blocks b and d resulting in a non-perfect refocusing. Assuming free diffusion, the average
change in position, Δz, is given by the diffusion coefﬁcient and the diffusion delay, Δz

time, the faster the nuclear spins have been displaced in the sample.
The loss of NMR signal (S) is related to Dt by the Stejskal-Tanner
equation [18]:

where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, g the gradient strength (g ¼ δB/
δz), δ is the gradient pulse length, and Δ0 is the generalized diffusion
delay, depending on the pulse sequence and gradient pulse shape
[19]. From Eq. (2), one can see that alternatively to varying the
diffusion delay between the two opposing gradient pulses, the
strength or length of the gradient pulses can be incrementally
increased while keeping the delay time constant. Since stronger
gradients or longer gradient pulses enhance the sensitivity towards
local displacement, the result will be the same: the faster a molecule
diffuses, the more rapidly its signal decays. Using variable gradient
strengths is often the preferred method, since it is free from com-
plicating relaxation effects due to varying delay times [20, 21]. Nev-
ertheless, if anomalous diffusion is studied, e.g., diffusion studies in
complex environments, the diffusion delay should be used as the
variable [22–24].
Determination of the translational diffusion coefﬁcient of an
unfolded protein ensemble can give information on the general
dimensional features, such as the compaction or extendedness of
the ensemble [7, 8, 10]. The scaling exponent can therefore be
used to, e.g., categorize the ensemble in terms of its solvent inter-
actions. However, more importantly, small, induced changes in the
ensemble size can accurately be determined by PFG NMR,
enabling more complex characterizations of the ensemble, where
modulations of its size are involved. For example, the response on
compaction due to alterations in sequence can be quantiﬁed with
good precision, enabling the characterization of preferred intramo-
lecular long-range contacts [10, 11]. The hydrodynamic radius is
also a sensitive reporter on weak intermolecular interactions and
can be used to, e.g., elucidate if a protein in solution is predomi-
nantly found in a monomeric or oligomeric state. By studying the
concentration dependence of Dt, very weak self-interactions can be
detected and quantiﬁed [25]. In fact, any process that involves
changes in particle size can be monitored. For instance, titrating a
ligand into the sample and tracking the change in protein or ligand
diffusion coefﬁcient as the bound species becomes increasingly
populated allow the determination of the dissociation constant for
the binding reaction [26]. This method allows for quantiﬁcation
also of very weak interactions, i.e., Kd in the mM range. In some
cases, even small conformational transformations of a disordered
ensemble upon changing the solvent conditions or adding a ligand
can be observed, provided that this leads to a change in the
Translational Diffusion of IDPs
289

ensemble shape and/or size distribution and the ligand is of negli-
gible size [27].
This protocol describes how to determine the hydrodynamic
radius on an unfolded ensemble using PFG NMR translational
diffusion measurements. We describe sample handling, gradient
calibration, diffusion measurements, and simple ﬁrst-order analysis.

Materials
In general, there are no speciﬁc requirements for NMR PFG diffu-
sion measurements, which differ from those required for a general
NMR sample. In this section, we deﬁne the materials and solutions
necessary for preparing a typical sample for high-precision measure-
ments of translational diffusion of a disordered protein ensemble.
The conditions can be changed and optimized in terms of solvent,
pH, ionic strength (within the range tolerated by the hardware),
buffer, and protein concentration.
2.1
Instruments
1. NMR spectrometer and probe equipped with a z-gradient
(preferably > 50 G/cm).
2. Vacuum chamber (for lyophilization).
3. Thermometer that can be inserted into NMR spectrometer.
(If not available, use deuterated methanol sample for tempera-
ture calibration.)
4. Tabletop centrifuge that can reach up to 17,000  g.
2.2
Materials
and Solutions
All solutions should be prepared in deionized water (resistivity
ρ  18.2 MΩ cm at 25 C) if not speciﬁed otherwise.
1. NMR tubes that are optimized for the ﬁeld strength of the
spectrometer that is to be used. In the following protocol, we
will in general be referring to round-bottomed tubes of ; 5 mm
that require a minimum sample volume of 500 μL (see Notes 1
and 2).
2. Eppendorf tubes, 1.5 mL.
3. Paraﬁlm (for lyophilization).
4. Syringe needle, ; ~ 1 mm (for lyophilization).
5. D2O, ﬁltered, 99.8% deuterated.
6. Buffer stock solutions: Depending on the pH of interest for the
measurements, different buffering substances can be used.
Typically used buffers in NMR samples are 2-(N-morpholino)
ethanesulfonic acid (MES) and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-
1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), but phosphate or acetate buf-
fers are not uncommon either. Technically, NMR spectroscopy
does not set any restrictions on the type of buffer that can be
290

used. Recommended stock concentrations are 200–500 mM
(see Note 3).
7. Internal standard stock solutions: 10 mM α-cyclodextrin in
D2O, 40 mM DSS in D2O or H2O, or 1,4-dioxane, anhydrous,
99.8%. Any of those could be used.
8. Sample for gradient calibration: 1 mM α-cyclodextrin in D2O
(see Note 4).
9. Sample for temperature calibration: 500 μL of methanol-d4,
99.8% deuterated, sealed under atmospheric pressure (only if
no thermometer is available).
10. Protein sample for diffusion measurement: The general
requirements on protein NMR samples apply, i.e., relatively
high protein concentration (~100 μM in case of cryoprobe
and ~300 μM for a non-cryogenically cooled probe), low
ionic strength (<400 mM), and 3–10% of D2O to lock the
signal.

Software
1. Software that allows the processing of NMR data such as
TopSpin and NMRPipe.
2. Any software that allows the integration over spectral regions
and creation of data plots and curve ﬁtting, i.e., TopSpin,
MATLAB, NMRPipe, Sparky, and Kaleidagraph i.a.

Methods
3.1
Gradient
Calibration
Modern NMR spectrometers are equipped with fairly stable gradi-
ent ﬁeld generators reducing the need for routinely calibrating the
gradient strength before each experiment [28]. However, we do
recommend to perform this step before each round of measure-
ments, since it helps calling attention to defective hardware, partic-
ularly with regard to gradient pulse generation and temperature
control (see Note 5).
The Stejskal-Tanner equation (Eq. (2)) is valid under the
assumption that the gradient ﬁeld is linear, i.e., g ¼ δB/δz ¼ con-
stant. However, a perfectly linear gradient ﬁeld is not trivial to
achieve. If high-precision diffusion measurements are required,
the nonlinearity can be accounted for, by introducing a distribution
of gradient strengths [29]. However, normally, the gain in accuracy
is within the experimental error for slowly diffusing proteins, and
the main advantage comes from the gradient calibration [29].
1. Transfer the gradient calibration sample (see Subheading 2.2)
into a suitable NMR tube (see Notes 1, 2, and 6).
2. Calibrate the temperature of the spectrometer either with a
thermometer or a deuterated methanol standard sample [30].
Translational Diffusion of IDPs
291

3. Insert the sample into the spectrometer. To reduce tempera-
ture gradients and subsequent convective motion in the sample
[31], it is important to let the sample equilibrate to the tem-
perature in the spectrometer. Any temperature ﬂuctuations
upon sample insertion should have completely ceased, before
starting the measurement. Furthermore, to guarantee that the
temperature is truly homogenous in the sample, we recom-
mend waiting an additional minimum of 10 min after any
observable temperature ﬂuctuations have vanished.
4. Set up the spectrometer by tuning, matching, and shimming
the magnetic ﬁeld and thoroughly calibrating the proton pulse
length.
5. Load a pulse program for diffusion measurements that uses a
stimulated echo, storing the magnetization along the z-axis
during the diffusion delay. Although half of the signal is lost
due to coherence selections in this kind of pulse sequence, it
ultimately allows the use of longer diffusion delays. This is
because the longitudinal relaxation time T1 is much longer
than the transverse relaxation time T2 for large molecules
such as proteins, and therefore, the loss of signal due to relaxa-
tion during long diffusion delays is reduced [32]. In addition,
we recommend using a pulse sequence that includes a “longi-
tudinal-eddy-current delay” LED element as well as bipolar
gradient pulses (Fig. 3). Both of these features deal with the
eradication of artifacts introduced by eddy currents in the
probe hardware that occur when applying gradient pulses.
Signal from residual protonated water can be suppressed with
a saturation pulse at the beginning of the pulse sequence, also
known as “pre-saturation” [20].
6. The actual gradient strength in the gradient pulses are altered
by changing a pre-factor of the gradient coil-dependent gradi-
ent ﬁeld, and in Bruker spectrometers, this is simply a percent-
age of the full gradient strength, g0, and in Varian, it is related
to the current in the gradient coil. Set the gradient pre-factor
(ζ) to, e.g., 2% and increment the strength linearly in at least
16 steps to a ﬁnal value of, e.g., 98% of the maximum gradient
ﬁeld strength. Each diffusion experiment is thus a series of 1D
experiments with incremented increase in gradient pulse
strength, ζg0, ζ ∈[0 : 1], resulting in an NMR signal attenua-
tion according to Eq. (2) (Fig. 3). Optimize the diffusion delay
Δ or the gradient pulse length δ so that the signals give optimal
signal decay proﬁles (Fig. 3) (see Note 6).
7. Integrate over the signal peaks and plot the intensities as a
function of gradient strength pre-factor ζ, i.e., S(ζ). Subse-
quently, ﬁt the intensity proﬁle to the Stejskal-Tanner equation
modiﬁed for bipolar gradient pulses:

where Dt is the known diffusion coefﬁcient of α-cyclodextrin, γ
is the gyromagnetic ratio of the studied nuclei, δ is the length of
the gradient pulse, and Δ and τ deﬁne the diffusion delay for this
particular pulse sequence [20] (Fig. 3). The variable ζ is the
pulse shape corrected factor of the sole ﬁtting parameter gcal,
which corresponds to the actual gradient strength. Since the
hydrodynamic radius of α-cyclodextrin is known to be 7.5 A˚
[26], the Dt can be calculated using Eq. (1), and we can accu-
rately determine the absolute value of the gradient strength. It is

protocol is shown in (a). The black rectangles are hard pulses, narrow ractangles are 90 pulses, and wider
ones correspond to 180 pulses. The gray half oblates are gradient pulses with amplitude g and duration δ/2,
and Δ is the diffusion delay. Here, bipolar gradient pulses are used to reduce eddy currents in the probe
hardware caused by the gradient pulses. Increasing the gradient strength results in signal loss as shown in (b).
Plotting the intensity vs. gradient strength yields an archetypical gaussian attenuation and can be ﬁtted to
Eq. (3), as shown in red in (c). Using a too short diffusion delay Δ or a too long gradient pulse length δ results in
an incomplete attenuation reducing the accuracy of the obtained Dt indicated by gray circles. Similarly, a too
long Δ or a too long gradient pulse length δ results in most of the data points merely recording the noise, while
only a few can be used to determine Dt (blue circles). In contrast, if Δ and δ are chosen optimally, the signal
decay proﬁle will resemble the one presented with red circles

advisable to repeat this measurement three times to obtain good
statistics for the gradient strength gcal. Nota bene (NB), when
calculating the expected Dt of α-cyclodextrin at any given tem-
perature the temperature dependence of the solvent viscosity,
should be taken into account. Estimates on the temperature
dependence on H2O/D2O mixture viscosities can be found in,
e.g., Ref. 7, 33, 34.
8. Similar to using a molecule like α-cyclodextrin as reference, the
HDO signal in the sample can be used to calibrate the gradient
strength [29]. Follow the same protocol as above, but set the
carrier frequency off-water resonance to avoid signal shape
distortions. Optimize the diffusion delay, which should be
reduced accounting for the faster HDO diffusion (Fig. 3) (see
Note 7). Furthermore, the T1 time is relatively long for HDO,
and consequently, a longer inter-scan delay is highly recom-
mended (3–4 s at room temperature). The gradient strength is
obtained by ﬁtting the attenuation data to Eq. (3), using the
literature value for HDO diffusion in D2O at 25
C,
Dt ¼ 1.90  1010 m2 s1.
9. If a nonlinear gradient is to be accounted for, Eq. (3) should be
replaced by the following:

where ρ(gcal) is the distribution function of gradient strengths
over the sample. In the simplest case, where the gcal values are
assumed to be linearly distributed between two extremes, gmin
cal
and gmax
cal , the integral in Eq. (4) can be solved explicitly, and the
signal attenuation should be ﬁtted as follows [29]:

3.2
Sample
Preparation
PFG NMR diffusion measurements are relatively sensitive experi-
ments, and there are no particular requirements on the sample,
apart from the general requirements on protein NMR samples (see
Subheading 2.2). Nonetheless, it is crucial for accurate determina-
tion of a diffusion coefﬁcient that the baseline of the individual
spectra is not distorted. Distortions can happen if the concentration
of a protonated component in the sample by far exceeds the con-
centration of the protein (i.e., more than two orders of magnitude).
Another source for distortions is insufﬁcient water suppression.
This can, however, be easily remedied by replacing H2O with
deuterated (“heavy”) water. To remove or reduce the water content
of a sample, two different approaches can be used: lyophilization or
the sample dilution approach. Although lyophilization almost
entirely removes the water in the sample and therefore is preferable,
some proteins are sensitive to this treatment and might undergo
irreversible aggregation or other permanent alterations during the
freeze-drying process [35, 36]. In these cases, diluting a highly
concentrated protein stock solution with D2O can provide a gentler
alternative.
3.2.1
Lyophilization
1. Prepare an Eppendorf tube for lyophilization by making 3 to
5 small holes into the tube lid with a syringe needle. Make sure
that none of the pricked-out plastic has fallen into the tube.
2. Prepare a sample by pipetting the volumes of your stock solu-
tions (protein, buffer, salt, or other additives) corresponding to
the desired NMR sample into the Eppendorf tube prepared in
step 1 and spin down the contents so that they are at the
bottom of the tube. To protect the sample from being con-
taminated in the next steps, a small strip of paraﬁlm can be used
to cover the lid.
3. Flash-freeze the tube with the sample in liquid nitrogen. Alter-
natively, if the protein is known to tolerate slow freezing, the
sample can simply be put in 80 C.
4. Once frozen, remove the paraﬁlm cover from the lid, allowing
water to escape from the perforations in the lid, and quickly
transfer the tube into a vacuum chamber. Depending on the
water content of the sample and the degree of vacuum, the
sublimation process can take from 30 min to several hours.
5. After the water has fully evaporated, spin down the contents of
the tube in a tabletop centrifuge for 10 min at 17,000  g.
6. Resuspend the freeze-dried powder in D2O to an end volume
of 500 μL.
7. To test if your protein of interest is suitable for lyophilization,
run a 1D-1H spectrum before and after the procedure and
check for obvious spectral differences between the two spectra.
Translational Diffusion of IDPs
295

Alternatively, and if available, a 1H15N-HSQC can be run on a
15N-isotope-enriched sample before and after the lyophiliza-
tion process to further validate the protein’s physical intactness.
3.2.2
Sample Dilution
1. Prepare the stock solutions for your protein, buffer, and other
additives at concentrations high enough, so that the total
volume does not exceed 20% of the ﬁnal volume, when added
in the appropriate amounts to your sample. In other words, if
the non-deuterated water content is kept lower than 20% of the
total sample volume, water suppression is typically good
enough to not cause any disturbing baseline distortions, also
when relatively close to the water frequency (see Note 8).
2. Fill up your sample to 500 μL with D2O. The viscosity of the
sample can be estimated as the weighted average of the H2O
and D2O viscosities [7, 37].
3. Spin down sample in a tabletop centrifuge for 5 s at 17,000  g
to collect all the liquid at the bottom of the tube and transfer to
an NMR tube.
3.3
Diffusion
Measurement
and Hydrodynamic
Radius Determination
The diffusion coefﬁcient of an unfolded ensemble can either be
determined directly as an absolute value or relative to an internal
standard, with known Dt. The advantage of the latter is that small
changes in viscosity due to high protein concentrations or high
concentrations of other components in the sample will be directly
accounted for, given that the reference molecule is inert and does
not form any complexes with the components in the sample. Tran-
sient or long-lived interactions between the internal standard and
the protein of interest (or other components added to the sample)
would lead to slower diffusion rates and thus an overestimation of
the protein’s hydrodynamic radius. α-cyclodextrin has proven inert
to interactions under conditions that we have tested so far. How-
ever, using a second internal standard, like the small inert molecules
dioxane or DSS, is advisable [9, 14, 37], again, given that the small
molecule does not interact [16]. Using two internal standards of
different sizes could also prove valuable when determining Dt in
more complex environments, as any discrepancy could indicate
anomalous diffusion [24, 23].
3.3.1
Absolute Diffusion
Constant
1. Prepare your sample in the conditions of your choice.
2. Perform steps 2–7 in Subheading 3.1, and optimize the diffu-
sion delay so that the signal is fully attenuated at ζ  80%,
assuring a full attenuation curve (Fig. 3) (see Note 7).
3. Integrate over a signal region that originates from the protein
and that does not overlap with buffer signals or any other
added component. Integrate over the exact same regions in
all spectra that were recorded with increasing gradient
296
Sarah Leeb and Jens Danielsson

strength. It is usually easy to distinguish between the protein
signal and various sources of signal. However, if there are many
proton-carrying components present in the sample, we recom-
mend running an NMR spectrum without protein ﬁrst to be
able to reliably distinguish between different sources of signal
(see Note 9).
Typically, the best spectral region for protein signal inten-
sity determination in a 1H spectrum lies between 0.5 and
2.5 ppm, where methyl and methylene protons resonate. Pro-
teins carry a large amount of this type of protons, and thus, the
signal intensity will be naturally quite high in this region
(Fig. 4). Furthermore, they do not exchange with protons
from the solvent, which would lead to a convolution of the
diffusion rates for both water and protein. For this very reason,
amide protons in the spectral region between 6.5 and 9.5 ppm,
for instance, are a poor choice for the determination of Dt
(Fig. 4).
4. Plot the integrals, or intensities, as a function of gradient
strength, i.e., S(ζ), and ﬁt the data to the same equation that
was used for the gradient calibration, e.g., Eq. (3) or Eq. (5),
this time however with a ﬁxed value for the calibrated gradient
strength (gcal) and with the single ﬁtting parameter Dt.
5. The hydrodynamic radius RH can be calculated from the diffu-
sion coefﬁcient Dt, the Boltzmann constant kB, the tempera-
ture T, and the sample viscosity η with the help of the Stokes-
Einstein relation (Eq. (1)).
3.3.2
Internal Standard
1. Add 50 μL from the α-cyclodextrin stock and 0.04% (v/v)
1,4-dioxane as internal standards to your sample (see Notes
10 and 11).
2. Perform steps 2–7 in Subheading 3.1.
3. Integrate over signal regions that originate from the internal
standards and that do not overlap with signals coming from
either the protein, the buffer, or other components. Integrate
over the exact same regions in all the other spectra that were
recorded with increasing gradient strength.
4. Plot the integrals as a function of incremental increase of ζ, and
ﬁt the data to the same equation that was used for the gradient
calibration, this time with an arbitrary gradient strength (garb)
and with the single ﬁtting parameter f
Dt.
5. Do the same for signal regions that originate from the protein
and that do not overlap with signals from the buffer, the
internal standard, or the other components. For tips regarding
the best choice of spectral regions, read Subheading 3.3.1,
step 3.

6. Repeat the ﬁtting procedure for these integrals as explained in
step 4.

following relation:

Notes
1. If ﬂat-bottomed Shigemi tubes or tubes of another diameter
are used, the sample volume has to be adjusted accordingly.
2. Generally, there are no particular requirements on the tubes for
diffusion measurements, but it should be kept in mind that
tubes of higher quality increase the sensitivity of the measure-
ments and allow the use of lower protein concentrations.
3. Upon dilution of a highly concentrated buffer stock, the pH of
the end solution might change. We therefore recommend to

measurements of a disordered protein ensemble. The 1D spectrum shows the
unfolded state of SOD1barrel [38], and the amide region is highlighted with the red
box. As the amide protons under physiological conditions undergo exchange with
water protons on a timescale typically faster than the diffusion delay, Dt derived
from this region will be the weighted average of water and protein diffusion. In
contrast, the methyl and methylene groups, in the green box, provide an
excellent alternative for Dt determination, given that they do not overlap with
any nonprotein signals
298
Sarah Leeb and Jens Danielsson

always check the pH of the ﬁnal protein sample before starting
the measurements.
4. To save time, we suggest preparing a standard sample contain-
ing 1 mM α-cyclodextrin in D2O, which is kept in the fridge.
α-Cyclodextrin is a very stable component and can be kept for
months in this way.
5. Knowing the precise gradient strength that is applied during
the experiments is crucial for the accurate determination of
absolute diffusion coefﬁcients (see Subheading 3.3.1). In con-
trast, if the hydrodynamic radius is determined relative to an
internal standard, knowledge of the gradient strength is not a
prerequisite. As both internal standard and protein are sub-
jected to the same gradient strength during the experiment,
this parameter will eventually cancel out when calculating the
hydrodynamic radius (see Subheading 3.3.2). If however the
gradient is calibrated, the internal standard can be used instead
to get an estimate about the viscosity in different sample con-
ditions, given that the internal standard is completely inert of
interactions with the diffusing molecule.
6. Any component with a well-determined diffusion constant at a
particular temperature can be used for the calibration of the
gradient pulse. In addition, the component should be large
compared to water, since molecules of a size similar to water
behave differently regarding translational diffusion.
7. To ensure that each data point contains an optimal amount of
information, the diffusion delay between the dispersing and
refocusing gradient pulses has to be chosen carefully. Too
short, the intensity loss due to translational diffusion is not
captured; too long, most of the data points will merely make up
the baseline (Fig. 3). Values between 50 and 200 ms for the
diffusion delay are common for small organic molecules such as
α-cyclodextrin and macromolecules such as proteins. Alterna-
tively, the gradient pulse length δ can be changed. However,
since gradient pulses usually aren’t perfectly linear along the z-
axis, a larger error is introduced if very long gradient pulse
lengths are chosen. Typical values range from 2.5 to 5 ms.
8. If the sample contains many different components added from
stock solutions that are kept in H2O and the protein is sensitive
to lyophilization, the components can be lyophilized separately
ﬁrst. After lyophilization, the freeze-dried components are
resolubilized in D2O, and the protein is added in the desired
amount.
9. A highly pure protein sample is critical for the correct determi-
nation of diffusion parameters. Signals from protein impurities
in the sample are difﬁcult to separate from the target signal and
will therefore likely bias the obtained diffusion rates.
Translational Diffusion of IDPs
299

10. Any component that is chemically inert and whose hydrody-
namic radius and diffusion constant have been well-determined
for the temperature of interest can be used as an internal
standard.
11. If anomalous diffusion is examined, the use of internal stan-
dards both signiﬁcantly larger than and similar in size to the
solvent molecules could be beneﬁcial.

Disorder is vital for the biological function of many proteins. The huge diversity found in disorder
composition and amplitude reﬂects the complexity and pluripotency of intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs). The ﬁrst step toward a better understanding of IDPs is a quantitative and position-speciﬁc
experimental characterization, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has emerged as the
method of ﬁrst choice. Here, we describe how to quantitatively assess the local balance between order and
disorder in proteins by utilizing the Chemical shift Z-score for assessing Order/Disorder (CheZOD Z-
score). This order/disorder metric is computed from the difference between experimentally determined
NMR chemical shifts and computed random coil reference values. We explain in detail how CheZOD Z-
scores are calculated fast and easily, either by using a python executable or by data submission to a server.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a broad and highly
prevalent class of proteins that break with the classical structure-
function paradigm in not forming a single folded 3D structure
[1, 2]. Rather, IDPs are characterized by an ensemble of different
conformations with no or very little secondary and/or tertiary
structure. Owing to this structural plasticity, IDPs can serve hub
and switch roles in various biological processes, such as regulation
and signaling [3, 4]. IDPs are also implicated in the etiology of
major diseases [5, 6], attracting an additional and growing interest
over the past decades. IDPs can be characterized experimentally
with biophysical techniques used for characterizing protein struc-
ture. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is now
ﬁrmly established as the gold standard for the quantitative and
position-speciﬁc assessment of disorder in proteins.

NMR chemical shifts have come to be the primary source of
information as they are highly sensitive to local structure, can be
measured easily and with great precision, and can be derived rou-
tinely using recently developed approaches [7–10]. Due to the
dynamic nature of IDPs, their measured chemical shifts will be a
statistical average over the sampled local conformations. By deﬁni-
tion, the structural ensemble of an IDP is dictated by the local
amino acid sequence only, and consequently, the chemical shifts
are characteristic for a given primary structure. These “random coil
chemical shifts” (RCCSs) have subsequently been modeled from
aggregate data for IDPs and can be predicted straightforwardly
from consideration of the nearest amino acid neighbors in the
sequence [11, 12]. Here, we focus on the POTENCI [11] method,
which derives the RCCS (δref below) from the neighbor, next-
nearest neighbor, temperature, and pH corrections as:

ð
Þ þ εpH ai, ai1, aiþ1, pH
ð

ð1Þ
here, δRC0(ai) is the reference RCCS for residue type, ai, at position
i. The sum consists of a linear correction factor for the nearest
and next-nearest amino acid neighbors, Δk, and correlated correc-
tions (second-order effects) for the combination of a certain amino
acid type at the center and another at the nearest/next-nearest
neighbor position, χk. The reference state for the ﬁrst two terms
is T ¼ 298 K and pH 7. Deviations in temperature and pH are
accounted for by a linear temperature coefﬁcient, βi [13], and a
correction εpH to account for the pH dependence of chemical shifts
for titratable amino acid side chains and their neighbors, as
described before [11, 14, 15].
The secondary chemical shift (SCS, δsec, Eq. 2, below) is the
signed chemical shift deviation from RCCS:
δsec ¼ δobs  δref
ð2Þ
where δobs is the observed chemical shifts and δref is the RCCS.
SCSs in ordered proteins span a wide range and are one to two
orders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic chemical shift varia-
tion that has been observed for disordered residues. Therefore,
SCSs can be used to unambiguously identify and sensitively quan-
tify the formation of small populations of local structure and con-
formational
propensities
[8,
16–20].
SCSs
have
different
magnitudes for different nuclei, n, and hence, it is convenient to
analyze a standardized weighted CSC (wSCS, Δn, Eq. 3 below):
Δn ¼ δsec n

where σ(n) is a scaling factor for the SCS representing the standard
deviation among disordered residues for nuclei, n, (and 1/σ(n) can

be considered as a statistical weight). Large absolute values,
|Δn| > 3, can be considered as statistical evidence for local order.
A combined consideration of all available backbone chemical
shifts provides a better evidence of local order (and disorder)
[17, 20]. Therefore, we introduced the Chemical shift Z-score for
assessing Order/Disorder (the CheZOD Z-score [21], also
referred to herein as the Z-score) based on statistical analysis of
wSCSs. First, the summed weighted chi-square deviation from
RCCS is calculated from assigned chemical shifts for particular
residue and its nearest neighbors:
χ2 ið Þ ¼

j¼i1, i, iþ1
min Δjn, 4


ð4Þ
where Δjn is the wSCS for residue j, and the number is truncated to
four since a value around three is sufﬁcient to be considered statis-
tical evidence of structure. Secondly, χ2 is transformed to an
approximately normal distributed number, L, by sums of fractional
powers of χ2 [22].
L ¼ ρ1=6  1

ð5Þ
where N is the number of assigned chemical shifts for the amino
acid triplet. Finally, the CheZOD Z-score (Z) is deﬁned by con-
verting L to a standard normal distributed number by correcting
with the known mean and standard deviation for L [22].

CheZOD Z-scores were found to be consistent with other
procedures for assessing disorder, such as missing density in X-ray

and

(MD) trajectories, but were proven to be more precise and accurate
[23]. Z-scores were subsequently applied to set a new standard for
benchmarking the performance of computational methods for pre-
dicting disorder. The CheZOD Z-score is a quantitative statistical
descriptor for how much a set of experimentally determined chem-
ical shifts deviate from RCCSs. By the nature of their deﬁnition
(Eqs. 4–6), Z-scores follow a standard normal distribution with
unit variance for completely disordered residues. Therefore, Z ¼ 3
can be regarded as a threshold above which chemical shifts identify
the population of ordered conformations (e.g., helix formation).
When applied to structured segments of proteins, Z-scores span a
large range, with a maximum of Z ¼ 16.15. To investigate the
magnitudes and sequence patterns of protein order and disorder,
Z-scores were calculated for all the residues of 117 proteins that
were allegedly disordered based on the title or keywords provided
by the authors [21]. Through inspection of the Z-score proﬁles

along the protein sequences, a complex picture emerged, revealing
a great diversity in disorder. On the one hand, proteins that are
mostly disordered were frequently found to have a small number of
structured regions comprised of varying numbers of residues and
with diverse fractional populations of order. Conversely, proteins
that are mostly structured often have ﬂexible termini or loop
regions with variable size and ﬂexibility (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 21).
This ﬁnding mirrors the broad repertoire of IDPs with levels of
disorder coding for different biological functions, ranging from
completely ﬂexible through partially disordered with interaction
hot spots to structured domains joined by ﬂexible linkers
[24]. The Z-scores for a large collection of proteins were observed
to follow a clearly bimodal distribution (see Fig. 3 in Ref. 21),
reﬂecting that residues typically classify either as mostly disordered
or as mostly ordered. Residues corresponding to being semi-
disordered, roughly deﬁned as falling in the region 3 < Z < 8,
were found to be less common than disordered (Z < 3) or ordered
residues (Z > 8) in the protein collection investigated.

Materials
The following chapters describe the application of two software
tools for quantitively assessing disorder and order in proteins
from assigned chemical shifts. The ﬁrst software to be discussed,
POTENCI [11], predicts RCCS reference values from amino acid
sequence. The other software, CheZOD, calculates CheZOD Z-
scores of disorder for proteins from assigned chemical shifts.
POTENCI is implicitly included in the implementation of Che-
ZOD. It is assumed that sequence-speciﬁc chemical shift assign-
ments have already been obtained [25, 26] (see also Subheading 1).
POTENCI and CheZOD are both available as Web server applica-
tions and as stand-alone command-line interface python scripts
and, depending on which approach is chosen, there are different
requirements. Following the online server application bypasses the
need for installing python and further dependencies, which is prac-
tical if only a few protein sequences are to be evaluated. Alterna-
tively, calculation via the command-line interface provides more
freedom and is convenient for running multiple calculations.
Python and some scientiﬁc python packages are required for run-
ning the applications locally (see below).

2. The protein sequence is entered as one-letter amino acid code.
Any nonstandard amino acids will be skipped, while sequence
numbering is retained. A minimum length of 5 residues is
required (see Note 1).
3. The sample conditions: pH, temperature, and ionic strength
must be speciﬁed (see Subheading 3.1).

CheZOD converts the deviations of the observed chemical shifts
from RCCSs to a measure of local protein disorder. Here, the
RCCSs are computed by POTENCI. CheZOD can be run for
both a local data set or for a published data set from Biological
Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) database using the identiﬁer
(BMRB ID).

2. In case the target is a published BMRB entry, only the
corresponding entry ID is required.
3. Alternatively, prepare a data ﬁle in NMR-STAR format (v2.1)
with assigned chemical shifts, amino acid sequence, and exper-
imental conditions (see Note 3). Published NMR-STAR ﬁles
can also be downloaded by ftp (see Note 4).

Methods
This section provides instructions for running CheZOD and
POTENCI programs on a server (Subheadings 3.1 and 3.3) or as
command-line interface stand-alone python scripts (Subheadings
3.2 and 3.4). A description of how to interpret the Z-scores in
terms of local disorder and order in proteins is provided (Subhead-
ing 3.5).
3.1
Computation
of RCCS Reference
Values Using a Web
Application
RCCSs will be calculated using POTENCI [11] by server Web
application.
1. Get to the POTENCI application (see Subheading 2.1, item 1).
2. Enter your protein sequence in the text box using one-letter
amino acid code as described in Subheading 2.1, item 2 (see
Note 1).
3. Specify sample pH in the corresponding input ﬁeld (default is
7.0). pH can strongly affect RCCSs for the titratable amino
acids (Asp, Glu, Cys, Tyr, His, Lys, and Arg) and their nearest
neighbors, and POTENCI will adjust RCCSs accordingly (for
the effects of pH on amino acid chemical shifts, the interested
reader is referred to the work of Kjærgaard et al. [13] and
Platzer et al. [14]). The exact implementation of pH correction
is explained under point 5 below.
4. Specify sample temperature (in K; default value is 298 K).
Temperature inﬂuences the RCCSs for all nuclei and 1HN
chemical shifts in particular (see Note 5). For a systematic
investigation of the effects on small peptides, see, for example,
Kjærgaard et al. [13].
5. Specify sample ionic strength (in Molar; default is 0.1). The
ionic strength has an effect on the estimated pKa values of the
side chains of the protein, which in turn affects the average
protonation state of each side chain in the protein sequence.
308
Jakob T. Nielsen and Frans A. A. Mulder

The latter is computed by the program pepKalc by Tamiola
et al. [15]. Given the average protonation state together with
the limiting RCCSs for the titratable amino acids at low pH
(protonated) and high pH (deprotonated), POTENCI com-
putes the most accurate RCCS values at any pH.
6. Click the “Submit” button.
7. Output RCCSs are returned to the user as a text ﬁle in ShiftY
format (space separated, see http://shifty.wishartlab.com/
help.html) (see Notes 1 and 6). This output ﬁle contains the
sequence entered by the user in the ﬁrst line, followed by a table
with residue number, amino acid type, and RCCSs for 15N,
13C0, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 1HN, 1Hα, and 1Hβ, respectively (see Note
7). In addition, the input parameters and the results of the
computation are returned in a text box below the submission
button, from where these can be copied.
3.2
Computation
of RCCS Reference
Values Using
a Command-Line
Python Script
1. Run the POTENCI application (potenci1_3.py below) with
python on the command line:
>>>
python_exe
potenci1_3.py
seqstring
pH
temperature
io-
nic_strength [pkacsvfile] > logfile
2. “python_exe” is alias for C:\Users\username\.edm\envs
\edm\python.exe on Windows,
.edm/envs/edm/bin/
python
on
linux,
and
/usr/bin/python
on
Mac
OS. Python version must be python 2 (validated to work with
python2.7).
3. The command-line argument, seqstring, speciﬁes the amino
acid sequence as in Subheading 3.1, step 2. The arguments,
pH, temperature, and ionic_strength (see Subheading 3.1,
steps 3–5) must be provided in that speciﬁc order, assuming
the units as deﬁned in Subheading 3.1 (see Note 8).
4. pKa values for amino acids with titratable side chains can be
optionally provided in a csv-type ﬁle (don’t use square brackets
around ﬁle name). As default, this is not required, and pKa
values are computed using the pepKalc [15] approach, which is
integrated in the POTENCI python code. Providing pKa
values bypasses the pepKalc computation and speeds up com-
putation considerably.
5. Output RCCSs are generated as described in Subheading 3.1,
step 7. Note that pKa predictions (see Note 9) are stored locally
as a text ﬁle, and this ﬁle is reloaded if the sequence, tempera-
ture, and ionic strength are the same as in a previous run. As
pH-dependent protonation states are now precomputed,
RCCSs can now be generated much faster for any pH value
for the same protein sequence under otherwise identical con-
ditions (see Note 10).

3.3
Computation
of CheZOD Z-Scores
Using a Web
Application
CheZOD can be run for both a local data set or for a published data
set from the BMRB database using the identiﬁer (BMRB ID).
CheZOD output is returned by email. See details below.
1. Go to the CheZOD Web server application address (Subhead-
ing 2.3, item 1).
2. Enter your email in the speciﬁed box.
3. You may run CheZOD for a published BMRB ID or provide
a local NMR-STAR ﬁle (version 2.1). In the ﬁrst case, choose
as job ID a valid BMRB ID (this is the number of a BMRB
entry, e.g., 16340 corresponds to the assigned chemical
shifts of Calbindin D9k). The data will then be downloaded
automatically from the BMRB ftp site for the speciﬁed entry
(see Note 11).
4. Alternatively, when uploading an NMR-STAR ﬁle from your
computer, choose any convenient identiﬁer (such as the name
of your protein) as job ID.
5. In the latter case, an NMR-STAR ﬁle (v2.1) with assigned
chemical shifts and experimental conditions (see Note 3) must
be uploaded (“Choose File” button) or pasted into the “NMR-
STAR data” text window. Published NMR-STAR ﬁles can be
downloaded by ftp as well (see Note 4).
6. Click the “Submit” button.
7. SCSs are returned by email to a text ﬁle with name “shiftjobid.
txt” where jobid is your speciﬁed job ID. One single SCS,
corresponding to a single atom, is speciﬁed on each line.
The following columns are speciﬁed: residue number (see
Note 12), residue type (one letter), atom type, assigned chem-
ical shift, pentapeptide sequence used by POTENCI (Eq. 1)
(see Note 13), and SCS. At the bottom of this ﬁle, chemical
shift offset corrections derived by POTENCI are provided (see
Note 14).
8. The output ﬁle, “zscoresjobid.txt,” is returned by email
with CheZOD Z-scores [21]. The output has the following
columns: residue name, residue number (see Note 12), and
Z-score.
9. A plot (see Fig. 1 below as an example) containing two aligned
panels with weighted SCSs (top panel) (see Note 15) and one
with the Z-scores (bottom) is sent by email to the user in pdf
format.
3.4
Computation
of CheZOD Z-Scores
from a Command-Line
Interface Python Script
The CheZOD python command-line script uses the same type of
input as the Web application.
1. Input parameters needed for POTENCI (within CheZOD) as
well as assigned chemical shifts must be provided in an
NMR-STAR 2.1 formatted ﬁle (see Note 3) via BMRB ID or

local ﬁle as described above (Subheading 2.3, item 3). In case a
published BMRB entry is the target, the NMR-STAR ﬁle will
be fetched automatically, which is accomplished through wget
(Linux) or curl (Windows/Mac) remote access protocols. If
you experience problems with this part of the code (not
exhaustively tested on all possible platforms), we recommend
downloading the ﬁle manually.
2. Run CheZOD with python 2 from command using the bmr
bid (see Subheading 3.2, step 1):
>>> python_exe chezod1_0.py bmrbid [-p] > logfile &
“-p” is default for producing plots, and “-n” implies skipping
plotting
3. Output RCCSs and pKa values are generated by POTENCI
within CheZOD with format and names as described above
(Subheading 3.1, step 7 and Subheading 3.2, step 5).
4. Output text ﬁles are generated as described above (Subheading
3.3, steps 7 and 8) with SCSs (“shiftsbmrbid.txt”) and Z-scores
(“zscoresbmrbid.txt”) (see Note 10).
5. A plot is produced as described above (Subheading 3.3, step 9)
containing both SCSs and Z-scores as shown in Fig. 1. It is
possible to interactively zoom, adjust range, and save the plot
in different ﬁle formats using the plot window menu.
3.5
Interpretation
of the CheZOD
Z-Scores
The Z-scores computed in Subheadings 3.3 or 3.4 can be inter-
preted in terms of local disorder and order. Brief guidelines on how
to interpret Z-scores and SCSs are provided below (see also Sub-
heading 1). Examples of SCSs and CheZOD Z-scores proﬁles are
provided in the literature [21] and in a commented example
(Fig. 1).
1. Z-scores below three indicate complete disorder; variation
observed is primarily a consequence of the ﬁnite accuracy of
the POTENCI and pepKalc models, the number of assigned
chemical shifts, and the precision in the measurement of the
chemical shifts (see Note 16).
2. Observations of 3 < Z < 8 correspond to intermediate and
pliant local order. This can, for example, be (1) formation of a
fractional population of helical conformations apparent from
positive SCSs for 13C0 and 13Cα and negative SCS for 1Hα,
13Cβ, 15N, and, to a smaller extent, 1HN; (2) extended back-
bone conformation, for example, due to strong charge repul-
sion or β-strand formation (this is accompanied by opposite
trends in SCSs compared to helix formation) [27]; and (3) very
ﬂexible loop or linker between two ordered segments with no
systematic trend in SCSs.
312
Jakob T. Nielsen and Frans A. A. Mulder

3. Z > 8 (up to a maximum value of 16.15) are observed for more
ordered residues. Flexible loops with partly restricted motion
have values at the lower end of this scale, whereas the higher
end corresponds to completely ordered secondary structure
elements as well as rigid turns or other noncanonical structure
(see Note 17). α-Helices and β-sheets give rise to highly sys-
tematic trends in SCSs as described above.
4. A comparison of Z-scores and SCSs for a full-protein sequence
gives a complete picture of local disorder and order. As an
example, Fig. 1 shows CheZOD Z-score proﬁles for two
domains of the protein TDP-43 (transactive response DNA
binding protein 43 kDa) [28]. In panel (a), the RNA recogni-
tion motif 1 (RRM1, bmrbid 18765, residues 96-186 with
N-terminal His-tag) [29] is shown, and in (b), the low com-
plexity C-terminal domain (CTD), which contains the amyloi-
dogenic core region (bmrbid 26823, residues 268–414)
[29]. The CheZOD Z-score proﬁle for the RRM1 domain
(Fig. 1a) reveals that this domain is structured as seen by high
Z-scores, which are mostly above Z ¼ 12 and a large variation in
SCSs. Low Z-scores (Z < 3) at both ends of the sequence
indicate disordered termini for this domain (the N-terminal
has an added His-tag, for which chemical shifts are not avail-
able). Medium Z-scores (8 < Z < 10) detect a ﬂexible loop
centered at residue 55. The CheZOD Z-score proﬁle for the
CTD (Fig. 1b) shows that this domain is almost totally disor-
dered, as judged by very low Z-scores (Z < 3). Notwithstand-
ing this overall disordered nature, the middle segment, residues
55–70, shows variation in the SCSs and displays Z-scores in the
intermediate range (3 < Z < 11), indicating partial ordering.
Population of helical structure for this segment is evinced by
the systematic patterns in the SCSs (as described in Subheading
3.5, item 2). A close inspection of the SCSs to the right of the
abovementioned segment reveals similar systematic trends in
the signs of the SCSs albeit with a much lower amplitude,
suggesting a small propensity for the population (less than
10%) of helix-like structure also for residues 73–76.

Notes
1. Any nonstandard amino acids will be skipped, while sequence
numbering is retained. A minimum length of ﬁve residues is
required. RCCSs are not provided for the terminal amino acids
due to lack of appropriate correction factors. Currently, phos-
phorylation, N-terminal acetylation, and other modiﬁcations
are not handled, although these may become available in the
future.

and for Pro 1HN.
8. An example command line is:
>>> python2.7 potenci1_3.py MADCATMAN 7.0 293 0.2 > log.txt
9. Output pKa values is a csv-type ﬁle with columns: Site, pKa
value, pKa shift, Hill coefﬁcient, as speciﬁed by pepKalc [15].
10. There is additional data in the logﬁle, which is undocumented
and not essential for the use of POTENCI or CheZOD. It was
mostly used for debugging and various stats.
11. CheZOD Z-scores are calculated based on assigned chemical
shifts for the triplet (residues i  1, i, and i + 1). The Z-scores
can be calculated for any number of assigned chemical shifts
(Eqs. 4–6), and in particular also in cases with missing
314

assignments for center residue i. In case there are no assigned
chemical shifts for the full triplet, Z-scores cannot be calculated
and will be skipped for these residues in the output ﬁle.
12. Residues are numbered using _Residue_seq_code ﬁeld in bmrb
ﬁle. Numbers in _Residue_author_seq_code are ignored.
13. One-letter codes, “n” and “c,” denote N and C-termini,
respectively.
14. Sometimes, the chemical shift reference can be misset, which
can have dramatic impact as systematic bias in wSCSs (e.g.,
for all 1H or 13C shifts) and thereby systematically higher
Z-scores. To address this issue, offset corrections are derived
automatically within POTENCI using a statistic information-
theoretic approach as described in detail in the POTENCI
paper [21, 30, 31]. SCSs should have these values subtracted
ﬁrst if plotted manually from the shifts ﬁle.
15. wSCSs in the plot are offset-corrected (see Note 14) and
weighted in order to scale with the natural variation among
disordered residues by dividing unscaled SCS (Eq. 3) with
0.1846, 0.1982, 0.1544, 0.4722, 0.0608, 0.02621, and
0.02154 ppm for 13C0, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 15N, 1HN, 1Hα, and 1Hβ,
respectively [21]. The numbers were estimated using the stan-
dard deviation within the POTENCI training set.
16. The accuracy of POTENCI for the wSCSs is 1.0 by deﬁnition
(Eqs. 3–6). Chemical shifts measured with lower accuracy can
lead to larger scatter in wSCSs. In particular, if proton chemical
shifts are derived from measurements in the indirect dimension
with an insufﬁcient number of increments, the measurement
errors can be signiﬁcantly larger than 1.0 for the corresponding
wSCSs.
17. CheZOD Z-scores depend on the number of assigned chemical
shifts for each tripeptide (maximum 21). Z-scores are strin-
gently the statistical signiﬁcance for being completely disor-
dered. At an average weighted absolute SCS (awaSCS) around
unity, the Z-score is close to 0 regardless of the number of
assigned chemical shifts. Furthermore, the threshold, Z ¼ 3, is
well deﬁned even with the availability of fewer chemical shifts as
well (e.g., with exclusively the amide 15N and 1HN). In con-
trast, at the highest end of the scale, Z-scores scale largely
linearly with the number of chemical shifts. For example, the
maximum value of Z ¼ 16.15 is obtained when all seven
chemical shifts are available for all residues in the tripeptide
and the awaSCS >4 (cutoff corresponding to four standard
deviations from RCCS) for all atoms. The related value for the
corresponding scenario with only three available assigned
chemical shifts per residue is Z ¼ 10.63. This means that larger
values of Z-scores must be interpreted with greater caution if

fewer assigned chemical shifts are available and segments of
disorder must be judged relative to the maximum Z-scores of
the proﬁle.

Determination of pKa Values in Intrinsically Disordered
Proteins
Brandon Payliss and Anthony Mittermaier
Abstract
Electrostatic interactions in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs) can strongly
inﬂuence their conformational sampling. Side chain pKa values provide information on the electrostatic
interaction energies of individual side chains and are required to accurately determine the molecular net
charge and charge distribution. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the premier method
for measuring side chain pKa values as it can detect the ionization states of individual side chains in an IDP
or IDR simultaneously. In this section, we outline the use of NMR spectroscopy to determine side chain-
speciﬁc pKas for each of the nine aspartates, ﬁve glutamates, and one histidine contained in a highly acidic
35-residue intrinsically disordered peptide.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs) lack
persistent secondary and tertiary structure, making them inherently
dynamic and ﬂexible molecules that can populate diverse ensembles
of conformations. There is considerable evidence that the confor-
mational sampling preferences exhibited by IDP ensembles can
impact their biological functions [1–3]. Thus, there is much inter-
est in understanding how the amino acid sequence and posttransla-
tional
modiﬁcations
of
IDPs
govern
their
conformational
ensembles. One particularly important factor is electrostatic attrac-
tion and repulsion between charged amino acid side chains. The
number of positively charged basic side chains and negatively
charged acidic side chains and their distribution in the amino acid
sequence have been linked to both the effective radius and the
shape of IDP conformational ensembles [4, 5]. Intriguingly, some
common posttranslational modiﬁcations, for example, phosphory-
lation and acetylation, alter the local (as well as overall) charge and

could thereby modulate long-range conformational sampling and
biological function [6–9]. Thus, methods to evaluate electrostatic
interaction energies on a per-residue basis are of great interest.
A simple and powerful way to probe side chain electrostatic
interactions is to measure residue-speciﬁc ionization constants.
These are typically expressed in terms of pKa,
pK a ¼  log 10 K a
f
g
ð1Þ
where Ka is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the
acidic proton
K a ¼ H3Oþ
½
 A
½

AH
½

ð2Þ
AH and A are the protonated and deprotonated forms of an
acidic side chain (Asp, Glu, and the carboxyl terminus), and H3O+
is the hydronium ion. For basic residues (His, Arg, Lys, and the
amino terminus), Ka is deﬁned according to
K a ¼ H3Oþ
½
 B
½ 
BHþ
½

ð3Þ
where BH+ and B are the protonated and deprotonated forms.
Larger vs. smaller values of pKa correspond to tighter vs. weaker
afﬁnity of the side chain for the acidic protons. A simple way to
conceptualize the meaning of a pKa value is to recall that it corre-
sponds to the pH at which the side chain is 50% protonated, where
pH ¼  log 10
H3Oþ
½

f
g
ð4Þ
pKa values are informative on side chain electrostatic interac-
tions, since a favorable electrostatic attraction between a negatively
charged acidic group and a positively charged basic group will tend
to increase the tendency of the acidic group to deprotonate
(decrease its pKa) and decrease the tendency of the basic group to
deprotonate (increase its pKa). Conversely, unfavorable electro-
static repulsion between like charges will tend to decrease the
tendency of acidic groups to deprotonate (increased pKa) and
increase the tendency of basic groups to deprotonate (decreased
pKa). It should be noted that in folded globular proteins, burial of
an ionizable side chain in the protein interior can lead to the same
pattern
of
up/downshifted
pKas
for
acidic/basic
residues
[10, 11], although this is unlikely to be as prevalent for IDPs,
which do not have closely packed hydrophobic cores. Furthermore,
the magnitudes of the pKa shifts can be used to calculate quantita-
tively the overall electrostatic interaction energies [9]. pKa values
have been measured for all standard amino acids in the context of
short model peptides [12] to serve as reference values in these
calculations.

The premier method for determining residue-speciﬁc pKa
values in proteins is solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy, as this technique allows one to visualize unique sig-
nals originating from each ionizable residue of a protein simulta-
neously. The frequencies (chemical shifts) of the nuclei close to the
site of ionization are sensitive to the ionization state. In general,
proton association and dissociation is fast on the NMR chemical
shift timescale, meaning that peaks in an NMR spectrum gradually
shift from locations corresponding to the protonated state to loca-
tions corresponding to the deprotonated state as the pH is raised.
The fraction of ionization at a given pH is simply the fraction of the
total shift in peak position exhibited in spectra collected at that
pH. pKa measurements of Arg, Lys, and His can typically be per-
formed with two-dimensional
1H/13C heteronuclear, single-
quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra [12]. Directly attached pro-
ton/carbon pairs give rise to peaks which appear at the 1H chemical
shift in the directly detected dimension and at the 13C chemical
shift in the indirect dimension. Suitable 1H/13C spin pairs include
1Hε1/13Cε1 for His, 1Hε/13Cε for Lys, and 1Hδ/13Cδ for Arg
[13, 14]. For Asp and Glu residues, Tollinger et al. have developed
a 2D NMR experiment in which peaks appear at the side chain
carboxyl 13C chemical shift in the indirect dimension and at the
chemical shift of the amide 1H of the following residue in the direct
dimension [15]. A series of chemical shifts are measured as the pH
is titrated across the ionization transition regions of the residues of
interest and are then ﬁtted to a modiﬁed Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation (see Subheading 3.4.2, step 4) to yield pKa values on a
per-residue basis. Note that this equation also yields a phenomeno-
logical Hill coefﬁcient for each residue, which accounts for
pH-dependent changes in the electrostatic environment of the
residue throughout the titration [16].
In this chapter, we describe the bacterial expression and puriﬁ-
cation of an IDR studied in our lab, the 35-residue disordered
C-terminal tail from yeast γ-tubulin (γCT). NMR protein studies
typically require isotopic enrichment with 13C and/or 15N, and this
is most easily accomplished by heterologous expression in E. coli
grown in minimal media. The γCT is produced as a cleavable
SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modiﬁer) fusion, which enhances
protein solubility and yield during bacterial expression, and there-
fore represents a good example of producing IDPs for NMR analy-
sis. This is followed by sections detailing the NMR spectroscopy
protocol and titration data analysis. For the γCT, this approach
yields the side chain pKas of nine Asp, ﬁve Glu, and one His residue.
Despite the large proportion of negatively charged residues (40%
Asp and Glu) and blocks of charged residues (e.g., D14, D15, E16
and E23, E24, D25), we were nevertheless able to unambiguously
determine
the
pKa
for
each
side
chain.
In

methodology outlined here could be readily applied to other IDPs
of varying sequence composition and charge distribution in order
to measure the side chain-speciﬁc pKas of Asp, Glu, and His
residues.

incubator for 1 h (225 rpm, 37 C).
7. Induce protein expression by adding 200 μmol of IPTG to each

later, add another 200 μmol of IPTG. Allow expression to
continue for 2–3 h after the last IPTG addition (see Note 3).
8. Harvest cells by centrifugation (4000  g, 4 C, 15 min).
Discard the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 15 mL
of Lysis Buffer. Pool resuspensions into a single 50 mL Falcon
tube. Centrifuge (4000  g, 4 C, 20 min) and discard the
supernatant. Flash freeze the pellet in liquid nitrogen allowing
at least 5 min of contact time. Store the pellet at 80 C.
3.2
Cell Lysis and
Protein Puriﬁcation
1. Perform cell lysis in a cold room using a modiﬁed procedure of
a previously established method [17]. Precool a coffee grinder
by pulsing two to three pellets of dry ice. Remove the cell pellet
from storage at 80 C. Wrap the cell pellet in paper towel, and
use a hammer to break the pellet into 1–2 cm3 pieces (see
Note 4). Quickly transfer the broken pellet into the precooled
coffee grinder, along with one to two pellets of dry ice. Pulse
intermittently, for a few seconds at a time, until a ﬁne snow is
formed. Transfer the contents into a 150 mL beaker, and ﬁll
with 50 mL Lysis Buffer (see Note 5). Mix thoroughly with a
spatula, and allow the mixture to stand for 5 min to allow for
complete sublimation of dry ice.
2. Clear the cell lysate by ultracentrifugation (35,000  g, 4 C,
1 h).
3. On an FPLC instrument, prepare a 1 mL HisTrap™HP col-
umn according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and equili-
brate with 5 column volumes (CV) of Lysis Buffer. Perform a
linear gradient elution (10 CV) until 100% of Ni-NTA Elution
Buffer is achieved. Screen for fractions containing 6xHis-
SUMO-IDP by SDS-PAGE (see Note 6). Pool desired frac-
tions, and concentrate using a 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal
concentrator to a ﬁnal volume of 2 mL.
4. Using an FPLC, prepare a HiLoad™16/600 Superdex 75 pg
SEC column by equilibrating the column in 2 CV of ultrapure
water followed by 2 CV of SEC buffer. Load the semi-puriﬁed
6xHis-SUMO-IDP concentrate into a 2 mL loop. Inject
500 μL and elute with 1.5 CV, repeating for a total of four
injections.
5. Load the semi-puriﬁed 6xHis-SUMO-IDP concentrate into a
2 mL loop. Apply 450 μL of the loop contents onto the
column, and elute with 1.5 CV of SEC buffer, repeating for a
total of ﬁve loops, where the ﬁfth injection volume is set to
2 mL. Screen for 6xHis-SUMO-IDP in the SEC fractions using
SDS-PAGE. Pool selected fractions, and concentrate to a vol-
ume of 750 μL using a 3 kDa MWCO Amicon® Ultra-15
concentrator.

6. Cleave the IDP from the 6xHis-SUMO by addition of
50–100 units of Ulp1 protease. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was
added to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 mM before incubating the
mixture overnight at 4 C on a nutating mixer.
7. Pass the solution over 250 μL bed volume of Ni-NTA resin
pre-equilibrated with SEC buffer, collecting the ﬂow-through
which contains the cleaved IDP (see Note 7). Depending on
the ﬁnal volume, add the appropriate volumes of 0.05 M
EDTA and 0.05 M NaN3 stock solutions to give a ﬁnal con-
centration of 50 μM EDTA and 50 μM NaN3 (see Note 8).

Spectroscopy
3.3.1
Sample
Preparation
1. Prepare the IDP sample for NMR by adding D2O to a ﬁnal
concentration of 5–10% in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Measure the pH of the solution using a small volume pH
electrode with a 3 mm diameter probe (see Note 9).
2. Centrifuge the NMR sample (12,000  g, 25 C, 5 min) prior
to addition to an NMR tube using a 203 mm Pasteur pipette
(see Note 10).
3. Perform standard tuning, shimming, and 1H, 13C, and 15N
pulse width calibrations on an NMR spectrometer set to an
appropriate temperature (in our case 24 C). For all NMR
experiments, use a recycle delay of 1.2 s.
3.3.2
1H-15N
Heteronuclear Single
Quantum Correlation
(HSQC) Spectra for Protein
Backbone Assignment
1. Acquire a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (see Note 11). In principle,
this experiment contains signals from all HN pairs in the pro-
tein. The majority of peaks in this spectrum may be assigned to
speciﬁc residues according to the protein sequence using a set
of 3D experiments (see Note 12). An example of an assigned
1H-15N HSQC for the γCT is shown in Fig. 1.
2. Remove the NMR sample from the NMR tube using the same
203

Pasteur
pipette,
and
place
into
a
1.5
mL
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Adjust the pH of the NMR sample to 8.5 using 1 μL addi-
tions of 0.5 M NaOH (see Note 13). Mix thoroughly using a
P200 pipette, allowing 1–2 min before recording the ﬁnal pH
measurement.
3.3.3
Aromatic 1H-13C
HSQC Spectra for
Measuring his pKas
1. Acquire an aromatic
1H-13C HSQC spectrum [18] (see
Note 14). This experiment will detect aromatic 13Cs bonded
to at least one 1H atom. An example of an assigned aromatic
1H-13C HSQC for the γCT is shown in Fig. 2. The peak of
interest is the Cε1/Hε1 pair of the His side chain.
2. The pH of the NMR sample can be reduced by increments of
0.15–0.3 using 1 μL additions of 0.5 M HCl.
3. Acquire 1H-13C HSQC spectra over a pH range of 8.5–4.5
(see Note 15).

HNCACB [27] and CBCA(CO)NH [28] experiments, as reported previously [9]. The
four resonances that appear in the top right corner of the spectrum correspond to
the Q4 and N17 side chains
Fig. 2 Assigned aromatic 1H-13C HSQC from the γCT (pH 7.2). Note that the Cδ1,
Cδ2, Cε1, and Cε2 aromatic carbons of Y7 are also visible in this region and that
the Cδ2 resonance of H32 has a negative peak (green) while the remaining peaks
in the spectra are positive (blue)

3.3.4
2D 13COi/1HNi+1
Spectra for Measuring Asp
and Glu pKas
1. This experiment requires the pulse sequence described by Tol-
linger et al. [15], whereby the resulting 2D spectra contain
peaks for each Asp and Glu side chain (see Note 16). An
example of the resulting 2D spectrum for the γCT is shown
in Fig. 3. Note that the 13CO chemical shifts of Gln and Asn
side chains are also detected in this experiment.
2. Adjust the pH in increments of 0.15–0.3, and collect spectra
over a pH range of 7.2–2.4 (see Note 17).
3. Acquire 1H-15N HSQC spectra in parallel for each pH adjust-
ment. This information is used for assignment and tracking the
Asp and Glu 13CO peaks throughout the titration.

Annotating NMR Spectra
1. Perform standard data processing using NMRPipe [19]. For
spectral processing tutorials, see https://spin.niddk.nih.gov/

using a standard script, adjusting the zero-order phasing in
each dimension as necessary.

2. Various software is available for analysis of spectra and peak
picking, such as NMRDraw, CcpNmr [20], or NMRFAM-
SPARKY [21]. For this method, download and install CcpNmr
version 2.4 from https://ccpn.ac.uk/v2-software/software/
analysis.
3. Create a home directory for storing the NMR spectra. Create
subdirectories for storing the three types of spectra collected.
4. Copy and paste the processed NMR spectra (.ft2 ﬁles) into the
appropriate subdirectories, ensuring they are renamed to
include the ﬁnal pH recorded before collecting the spectra.
5. Within the home directory, open CcpNmr. Import all spectra
from a given experiment. For example, import all of the aro-
matic
1H-13C HSQCs and save as a project ﬁle titled
“aromatic_hsqcs.”
6. On the menu bar, select Peak > Peak Finding.
7. Add peaks corresponding to the Cε1 of His for each 1H-13C
HSQC collected at different pHs (see Note 18).
8. Select all Cε1 peaks by clicking the mouse and dragging over
the peaks. On the menu bar, select Peak > Selected Peaks. This
table will show various information about the selected peaks.
Right-click on the table, and export the “Spectrum” and “Posi-
tion F2” columns into a tab-separated (.txt) ﬁle (see Note 19).
Name the ﬁle aromatic_hsqc_peaks.txt.
9. A similar methodology can be used to track peak movement in
the 1H-15N HSQC, followed by the 13COi/1HNi+1 spectra (see
Note 20). Note that overlapping Asp or Glu peaks may resolve
throughout the titration. For example, E23 and E16 from the
γCT overlap completely until pH is reduced to 4.9 (Fig. 4).
3.4.2
Model Fitting and
pKa Determination Using
MATLAB
1. After all peaks have been assigned and peak lists generated, the
data can be imported and analyzed in MATLAB [22]. Using
the 1H-13C HSQC data as an example, a simple script for
importing this data is as follows:
His_shifts = importdata(’aromatic_hsqc_peaks.txt’);
His = His_shifts.data;
x = His(:,1);
y = His(:,2);
pKa values in IDPs
329

2. Save and execute the script within the directory containing the
peak lists. Inspect the x and y variables under the Workspace tab
to ensure the data have been imported correctly.
3. Under the Apps tab, select the Curve Fitting Toolbox, and select
the x and y variables under the X data and Y data tabs, respec-
tively. A scatter plot of the 13CO chemical shift vs. pH should
appear.
4. Use the drop-down menu to enter a custom equation accord-
ing to the following:
δobs ¼ δoffset þ Δδ
10n pHpK a
ð
Þ
1 þ 10n pHpK a
ð
Þ
ð5Þ
where n is the Hill coefﬁcient, δobs is the observed chemical
shift, δoffset is the chemical shift of the nucleus in its protonated
state, and Δδ is the change in the chemical shift over the course
of the titration (see Note 21).

D10 resonance over a pH range of 7.2–2.3 in steps of 0.15–0.3 for a total of 13 data points. Panel (b) E23
and E16 resonances overlap at pH 5.9 but are resolved when the pH is reduced to <4.5

5. Examine the scatter plot to discern reasonable estimates for
δoffset and Δδ. Model ﬁtting can usually be accomplished by
providing initial guesses for these two parameters only (see
Note 22). Input these estimates into the Fit Options tab
under the StartPoint column. The MATLAB Curve Fitting
application layout and successful model ﬁtting to the titration
of H32 in the γCT are shown in Fig. 5.
6. Inspect the 95% conﬁdence bounds returned for each ﬁtted
parameter, as well as the goodness of ﬁt statistics to evaluate the
quality of model ﬁtting (see Note 23).

Notes
1. This step is only necessary if the expression plasmid has an
ampicillin selection marker.
2. Using this method, every 1 L of M9 Minimal Media requires
4 L of culture grown in LB. Use a 2.8 L Fernbach ﬂask if
available, which can hold 1 L of M9 Minimal Media.

3. Here, we describe a modiﬁed version of an existing protocol
originally described by Marley et al., where the authors report
95% and 90% incorporation of
13C and
15N, respectively
[23]. Various factors during expression can impact incorpora-
tion efﬁciency, which can be determined using mass spectrom-
etry [24]. If incorporation efﬁciency of 13C is low or is not
predominantly uniform, this will lead to low signal-to-noise in
13C spectra and may require inadequately long acquisition
times. To improve 13C incorporation efﬁciency, it is possible
to modify the expression protocol according to Hoopes et al.
[25] where we suggest the following: Inoculate a 3 mL LB
+amp starter culture using a single colony, and grow for 5 h
(37 C, 225 rpm). Use 0.5 mL to inoculate 50 mL of M9
Minimal Media containing 13C6 D-glucose and 15NH4Cl, and
grow overnight (28 C, 225 rpm, <16 h). Transfer the entire
contents to a 1 L M9 Minimal Media culture where expression
can be induced with IPTG at an OD600 0.7–1.0. The disad-
vantage to this approach is that it often leads to roughly half of
the protein yield compared to the expression protocol we
recommend.
4. Remove the cell pellet from storage at 80 C, and place two
sheets of paper towel on a sturdy, level surface. Remove the cap
from the 50 mL Falcon tube, and stand on top of the paper
towel. Warm the back of the tube for a few seconds with gloved
hands, and gently hammer the back end of the tube. This will
often dislodge the pellet from the tube without the need to
break the plastic.
5. Add additional Lysis Buffer as necessary to reduce the viscosity
and balance the sample prior to ultracentrifugation.
6. Highly acidic IDPs may result in a higher apparent molecular
weight than expected. In the case of the γCT, the 6xHis-
SUMO-γCT runs with an apparent molecular weight of
25 kDa (expected: 21 kDa) due to electrostatic repulsion
of the SDS.
7. For quality assurance, run the ﬂow-through containing the
puriﬁed IDP on an SDS-PAGE gel. If Ulp1 or cleaved 6xHis-
SUMO persists in the ﬂow-through, a second pass over fresh
Ni-NTA resin can be performed to achieve higher IDP purity.
In our case, a concentrated γCT sample could be visualized on a
gel after running a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and performing the
following staining protocol: After running the gel, treat with a
gel ﬁxative (10% v/v acetic acid, 40% v/v methanol) for at least
1 h, followed by overnight staining using colloidal Coomassie
G-250 according to Neuhoff et al. [26] The γCT co-migrates
with the dye front, so application of the gel ﬁxative was per-
formed to remove the bromophenol blue in order to see the
stained γCT.

8. EDTA and NaN3 are added to the NMR sample as antimicro-
bial and bacteriostatic preservatives, respectively.
9. Perform a 3-point calibration (pH 4, 7, 10) on the pH meter
prior to use.
10. For all pH manipulations, use the same pH meter, NMR tube,
Pasteur pipette, and microcentrifuge tube for transfers and pH
adjustment. In the case of the γCT, we prepared 600 μL of
1 mM γCT in NMR buffer with 10% D2O and placed the
sample in a 5 mm NMR tube. Alternatively, the titration can
be performed in a 3 mm NMR tube using 180 μL of a 0.5 to
1 mM IDP solution.
11. The following acquisition parameters can be used for the indi-
rect dimension: Center position of 117.8 ppm and spectral
width of 24 ppm. Set the number of complex points to 1024:
H(F2)/128:N(F1). The acquisition time should be approxi-
mately 24 min.
12. Assignment of the 1H-15N HSQC often requires a set of 3D
NMR experiments. Some of the common 3D NMR experi-
ments used for assignments include HNCACB [27], CBCA
(CO)NH [28], HNCO [29], HNCA [29], and HN(CA)CO.
[30] The strategy in selecting 3D experiments for assignment
depends on the sequence of the IDP. In the case of the γCT, we
assigned the 1H-15N HSQC (Fig. 1) using HNCACB and
CBCA(CO)NH experiments only. For more information
about assignment theory and the variety of experiments avail-
able, see the following Ref. 31, 32
13. If 180 μL of a 0.5 to 1 mM IDP solution is used in a 3 mm
tube, pH adjustments should be performed with 0.15 M HCl
or NaOH instead of 0.5 M for better control of pH
adjustments.
14. Record the aromatic region by setting the spectral width of the
indirect dimension to 15 ppm, centered at 125.5 ppm. The
number of complex points that can be used are 512:H(F2)/40:
C(F1). The acquisition time should be approximately 14 min.
Use a constant-time 1H-13C HSQC experiment with a time
T ¼ 1/JCC, where JCC is the carbon–carbon coupling constant,
typically set to 16 ms. After phasing the spectra, this gives
opposing signs to the peaks corresponding to the Cε1 and
Cδ2 carbons in the His side chain. The reporter nucleus of
interest for titrating His side chains is Cε1, as this site is highly
sensitive to the protonation state of the His side chain, and
gives larger chemical shift changes relative to the Cδ2.
15. For the γCT, we adjusted the pH to 8.8, which provided a
sufﬁciently deprotonated baseline for accurate pKa determina-
tion of H32. Our measured pKa of 7.2 for H32 corresponds
to a population of 98% deprotonated at a pH ¼ 8.8. For
pKa values in IDPs
333

highest accuracy in determining the pKa, adjust the pH to a
value corresponding to 95% deprotonation for a given His
within an IDP. This ultimately depends on the pKa, but a
reasonable starting point for titrating His side chains is a pH
of 8.5. Note that collection of 1H-13C HSQC spectra at a
pH > 8.5 may be necessary if the pKa of a given His side chain
is >7.2, in which case we recommend including 10 mM borate
in the NMR buffer.
16. A detailed description regarding experimental setup on a Var-
ian spectrometer can be found at http://daffy.uah.edu/res
ources/pKa_experiment.pdf, and the pulse sequence can be
obtained from Dr. Lewis Kay’s research group at http://
pound.med.utoronto.ca. The pulse sequence is more formally
known as hbgcbgccbgcaconnh_mt__v2_500.c [15]. For this
experiment, use a center position of 179 ppm and a spectral
width of 12 ppm for the indirect (13CO) dimension. Set the
number of complex points to 512:H(F2)/128:C(F1). The
acquisition time should be approximately 1.5 h per spectra.
17. Under our experimental conditions, the total change in ionic
strength was 50 mM after all pH manipulations, which
includes adjustment to pH 8.8 with 0.5 M NaOH, followed
by reduction to pH 2.5 using 0.5 M HCl, where the initial and
ﬁnal ionic strengths are 135 mM and 185 mM, respectively.
The total change in ionic strength can be calculated using the
known concentrations and volumes added for HCl and NaOH.
The pKa of an ionizable side chain is highly sensitive to its local
environment, and the impact of ionic strength on site-speciﬁc
pKas will ultimately depend on the IDP and experimental con-
ditions. We also caution the reader that tuning the NMR probe
may be difﬁcult when the ionic strength is >200 mM in a 5 mm
NMR tube. If pKa values at ionic strengths >200 mM are
desired, use 3 mm NMR tubes.
18. On the menu bar, open Peak > Peak Finding. Select the
Region Peak tab, and set reasonable boundaries for each
dimension before selecting Find Peaks! Repeat this process
for each spectrum by changing the selection from the Peak
List drop-down menu.
19. Modify the .txt ﬁle such that the ﬁrst column contains the pH
and the second column contains the corresponding 13CO
chemical shift data.
20. In order to assign Asp and Glu peaks from the 13COi/1HNi+1
experiment, it may be necessary to perform 3D experiments to
assign 1H-15N HSQC resonances unambiguously; accurate
assignment of 1H-15N HSQC peaks is necessary in order to
track Asp or Glu peaks in the 13COi/1HNi+1 spectra.

21. This Henderson-Hasselbalch equation has been modiﬁed to
contain the Hill coefﬁcient n. δobs is the observed chemical
shift, δoffset is the chemical shift of the nucleus in its protonated
state, and Δδ is the change in the chemical shift over the course
of the titration. In MATLAB, the custom equation may be
entered
as
“a+(b.∗10.^(n∗(c-x)))./(1+10.^(n∗(c-
x))),” where a, b, n, and c variables are δoffset, Δδ, n, and
pKa, respectively.
22. If model ﬁtting is unsuccessful, inspect the scatter plot to
provide an estimate of the pKa by determining the pH of the
midpoint. Provide this value as an initial guess.
23. The prediction bounds of the model can be represented gra-
phically by selecting Tools > Prediction Bounds > 95%. The
smaller the distance between the prediction bounds and the
model ﬁt, the better the model ﬁtting. Pay speciﬁc attention to
the conﬁdence bounds for each ﬁtted parameter, especially for
the pKa. Evaluate the distance between the upper (U) and
lower (L) 95% conﬁdence bounds; a reasonable ﬁt would
return a U–L < 0.2 for the pKa.

Paris-DE´COR: A Protocol for the Determination of Fast
Protein Backbone Amide Hydrogen Exchange Rates
Rupashree Dass and Frans A. A. Mulder
Abstract
Determining hydrogen exchange kinetics in proteins can shed light on their structure and dynamics.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an important analytical technique to determine
exchange rates. In this chapter, we describe a new method (Paris-DE´ COR) to determine fast protein
amide backbone hydrogen exchange rates in the range 10 to 104 s1. Measuring fast exchange rates is
particularly important for the study of intrinsically disordered proteins, where there is very little protection
from exchange to the solvent by the formation of persistent structure. We provide a protocol to set up the
experiment as well as MATLAB scripts for numerical simulation that is needed to determine the exchange
rates.

Introduction
Backbone amide hydrogen exchange rates of peptides and proteins
can provide information about hydrogen bonding, secondary
structure, conformational dynamics, and stability. The formation
of structure reduces amide hydrogen exchange rates relative to
those observed in their solvent-exposed reference state. The reduc-
tion relative to these intrinsic rates constitutes an important means
to determine the relative stability to partial unfolding in folded
proteins and emerges as a means to determine the extent of struc-
ture formation in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a widely
used analytical tool to measure hydrogen exchange rates, and a
number of methods have been developed to determine exchange
kinetics that are applicable to different timescales. In this chapter,
we give a step-by-step guide for determining exchange rates using
the newly developed Paris-DE´ COR [1] approach, which is suited

for measuring very rapid hydrogen exchange in the approximate
range 10–10,000 s1. The measurement of such very fast exchange
rates has not been developed hitherto but has become of interest
with the increased number of studies dealing with IDPs.
The Paris-DE´ COR method is based on previous work by
Skrynnikov and Ernst [2] and Pelupessy and co-workers [3]. The
ﬁrst authors developed the conceptual framework for measuring
the rate of hydrogen exchange via the spin-lattice relaxation rate of
two spin order terms such as 2NzHz for an amide backbone pair.
They rigorously showed that exchange events with solvent lead to a
decorrelation of the involved spin operators (hence reference to
DECOR), which then manifests itself as an additional exponential
loss rate that equals the kinetic rate for exchange with solvent.
Building on this approach, the Paris group of Pelupessy and
co-workers [3] demonstrated that the exchange rate can be more
conveniently measured though decorrelation of antiphase opera-
tors. In their ingenious approach, different admixtures of Ny and
2NxHz
are
produced
by
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill
[4,
5]
(CPMG) echo trains applied to the 15N channel. In contrast to
Ny, the antiphase operator 2NxHz is subject to decorrelation by
exchange events, such that exchange leads to pulse-spacing-depen-
dent signal loss (detected in the experiment by reduced peak inten-
sities). In addition, a reference experiment is performed in which
high-power composite pulse 1H decoupling is applied, such that
the generation of antiphase operators is strongly suppressed. In
practice, a pulse sequence is chosen that produces an in-phase
coherence Ny which is then subjected to a constant time period
during which a variable number of 15N CPMG pulses are applied.
Subsequently, the magnetization is transferred to a suitable
non-labile nucleus for detection. Amide proton detection is not
possible as this exchanges too fast to be observed. So far, we have
successfully implemented the Paris-DE´ COR approach in 2D H
(CACO)N and 2D CON experiments. Peak intensities of the spec-
tra obtained with different numbers of 15N CPMG pulses are then
divided by the intensity measured in the reference experiment.
In the analysis, exchange rates are obtained through a numeri-
cal ﬁtting procedure. Brieﬂy, expected peak intensities are com-
puted by evolution of a subset of density operators during the
constant time period. A best ﬁt between experimental and com-
puted intensity ratios at all CPMG spacings is then obtained
through simplex minimization of the error target function. In this
way, fast protein backbone amide exchange rates are determined for
each residue separately, as the computation uses the RF ﬁeld
strengths and offsets, as explained in the literature [3].

Materials
1. A sample of uniformly [15N/13C]-labelled protein (see Note 1)
in Tris buffer pH 9.0 (see Note 2), without added D2O (see
Note 3).
2. For the combined purpose of chemical shift referencing, and to
provide a lock signal, a capillary containing 50 mM DSS
(4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid) in D2O is used
(see Note 3).
3. NMR instrument. High-ﬁeld Bruker NMR spectrometer
equipped for triple resonance experiments, operating at
500 MHz or higher. For experiments that use 1H detection, a
standard probe head. For experiments that require 13C detec-
tion, a cryogenically cooled probe head, ideally of the type
designed for 13C reception.
3
Methods
3.1
Data Acquisition
1. The protocol explained below is applicable for Bruker spectro-
meters. To set up a general NMR experiment, one may refer to
Bruker TopSpin manuals and additionally consult Chapter 4 of
the book Structural Biology: Practical NMR Applications by
Quincy Teng [6]. It is assumed that all steps are taken that are
normally needed to record triple resonance experiments.
2. Pulse sequence and parameter sets are available from http://
www.protein-nmr.org. These are straightforward modiﬁcations
of Bruker library experiments and are “prosol” compatible for
automatic calculation of pulse widths (see Note 4).
3. Use the “getprosol” command to set the correct pulse lengths
for all pulses on 1H, 13C, and 15N channels.
4. Set the parameter d25 to equal the length of the total CPMG
period on the 15N channel. Typically, we employ 20 ms (see
Note 5).
5. Evaluate relevant parameters (suggestions in square brackets)
like d1 [1s], dummy scans [4], and number of scans [multiple
of 8] (see Note 6).
6. Select appropriate carrier offsets, spectral widths, and number
of data points for direct and indirect time domains (see Note 7).
7. Run experiments without 1H decoupling (spectra “A”) by
ensuring that zgoptns is undeﬁned (i.e., ﬁeld left blank). The
loop counter l4 deﬁnes the number of 180 pulses during the
CPMG period and should be an even number to maximize the
well-known self-compensatory effects of the CPMG sequence
with respect to off-resonance artifacts. Acquire several 1D
Paris-DE´ COR
339

datasets (e.g., by running a single increment) for different
values of l4. We recommend running at least four experiments
(l4 ¼ 2, 4, 8, 16). Due to the ﬁnite 15N 180 pulse width, the
maximum number of pulses will depend on power handling of
the probe and the length of d25. A use of 16 is often adequate
as only very little antiphase is being developed and so very little
attenuation is obtained.
8. Acquire a reference spectrum (spectrum “B”) with zgoptns
equal to “–DLABEL_REF” and the maximum value for l4 to
be used. This will ensure 1H decoupling is applied during
CPMG. Ensure that the 1H decoupling RF ﬁeld is strong
(>4 kHz; see Note 8).
9. Execute the series of 2D experiments (one reference and a
series of experiments with different values of l4) each with
otherwise identical settings. Having a large number of
dummy scans (to the equivalent of 3 min) ensures that sample
temperature is stable when data is being acquired. A full series
of experiments is generally obtained within 24 h.
3.2
Data Processing
1. For processing of the acquired spectra, one may use the Top-
Spin processing software available on Bruker spectrometers or
NMRPipe [7] available from https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/
nmrpipe/install.html.
2. Depending on the pulse sequence to be used, it is assumed that
corresponding H(CACO)N or CON spectra have already been
assigned (see Note 9). It is typically most convenient to identify
all the peaks in the reference spectrum (with 1H decoupling) as
this spectrum is expected to display maximal intensity. Assign-
ments can then be transferred to the spectra obtained with
different number of 180 pulses.
3.3
Determination
of Hydrogen Exchange
Rates by Numerical
Fitting
Rate determination by the Paris-DE´ COR method is implemented
in the computational suite MATLAB (Fig. 1) [8]. Follow the
following steps:
1. Download all the .m scripts from https://github.com/protein-
nmr or through links provided at http://www.protein-nmr.
org. It is important that all the .m ﬁles are located in the same
folder on your computer.
2. Input parameters such as peak heights/intensities, noise levels,
and experimental parameters such as length of the CPMG
period, no. of CPMG 180 pulses, RF ﬁeld strength of the
hard 1H 90 pulse (expressed in Hz), and the magnitude of
the1JNH coupling constant (93 Hz) should be entered in
“input_script.m.” Follow the formatting deﬁnitions provided
in the example ﬁle from the github distribution.
340
Rupashree Dass and Frans A. A. Mulder

3. Start MATLAB. Locate and run “input_script.m.” The output
is saved on the workspace as a matrix “k,” containing the
exchange rate for each amide hydrogen (see Note 10).
4. The uncertainty in the determined rates is obtained by running
“input_script.m” after removal of the out-commenting charac-
ter % at the start of line 28 of the script. A Monte Carlo
procedure is now invoked, which generates synthetic data
based on the input uncertainties provided by the user (see
Note 11). The total time this analysis takes depends on the
number of iterations deﬁned by the parameter “nmc.”
4
Notes
1. The quality of the data further depends on familiar parameters,
such as the protein concentration and the intrinsic sensitivity of
the pulse sequence employed. For IDPs, measured with a
cryogenically cooled probe head, we typically use 200 μM for
NMR experiments that utilize 1H observation and 1 mM for
those with 13C observation. 0.01% NaN3 is included to pre-
serve the protein sample for a longer time. The total volume of
the sample is typically 600 μL, when using standard 5 mm
NMR tubes.
2. The Paris-DE´ COR approach is most sensitive to hydrogen
exchange rates in the regime 100–1000 s1. Where possible,
Fig. 1 Variation in intensity ratio A/B with the number of CPMG pulses as obtained experimentally (blue points)
and by ﬁtting the density operator (points connected by green line). Error bars produced by synthetic data
generated by the Monte Carlo procedure are shown in red. Exchange rates in units s1 (in this example, for
residues Phe4 and Gln24 of human α-synuclein) are indicated at the top of each panel
Paris-DE´ COR
341

the pH of the sample can be adjusted to increase the accuracy of
the method. For example, protein backbone amide rates at
room temperature (298 K) will fall in the above-quoted range
when the pH of the solution is around 9.
3. A 50 mM solution can be placed in a capillary of the type
commonly employed to determine the melting temperature
of solids. The capillary should be free of air bubbles and is
then sealed over a ﬂame. The capillary is subsequently put in
the NMR tube containing the protein solution, which ensures
it is concentrically located, such that shimming and referencing
procedures are not adversely affected. Through this procedure,
the protein solution itself does not contain D2O, which will
otherwise complicate the analysis [3].
4. “Prosol” compatibility ensures that the command “getprosol”
can be used in order to compute any shaped and low-power
pulses (e.g., for decoupling) once the high-power 90 pulses
are available.
5. Longer values will cause stronger attenuation due to exchange
but adversely affect signal-to-noise.
6. This choice will depend on the concentration of the protein
and instrument/probe sensitivity and should be tested once for
the reference experiment (which has the highest intrinsic
sensitivity).
7. Typical carrier positions are in the middle of the respective 15N
and 13C’ chemical shift ranges. As Pro residues are of no
interest here, these are best placed around 117 ppm and
176 ppm, respectively. Aliasing may occur when spectral
width of the indirect dimension is chosen narrower than all
contributing resonances, in order to achieve high resolution,
which is typically done. Note that in this scenario, Pro signals
(which appear around 136 ppm) may be aliased in the 15N
dimension and may overlap with peaks of interest. Should this
occur, then the spectral width can be adjusted slightly until no
further overlap is present. To identify all Pro signals, run the
CON spectrum once with a 15N spectral width of 80 ppm. Side
chain Arg 13Cζ/15Nε correlations can be identiﬁed in the same
way (these occur at 168 ppm for 13Cζ and 86 ppm for 15Nε)
and are also accessible by our approach.
For the spectra shown in Fig. 2, acquired at 950 MHz, we
used 1024 (total) points for 13C’ and 512 for 15N. The spectral
widths were 7878 Hz (13C’) and 3561 Hz (15N). The carrier
frequencies were 176.4 ppm (13C’) and 123.3 ppm (15N).
8. The B1 ﬁeld strength expressed in Hz equals 1/4∗pw90,
where pw90 is the pulse width of the decoupling ﬁeld.
9. We typically use triple resonance experiments and the assign-
ment software Sparky [9].

10. In order to save time and produce valid output, the script only
analyzes peaks for which the signal-to-noise ratio is larger than
ﬁve. The output generated is a per-residue exchange rate,
uncertainty interval for the exchange rate, and a plot showing
the experimental A/B values and best-ﬁt computed A/B
values, as shown in Fig. 1.
11. Random noise is added to the intensities of each peak, which
follows a normal distribution based on the experimental uncer-
tainty. For every Monte Carlo iteration, the ﬁtting procedure is
done with this synthetic data. After many iterations, one has an
increasingly good estimate of the uncertainty in the ﬁtting
procedure [10]. We typically use 200 iterations.

Predicting Conformational Properties of Intrinsically
Disordered Proteins from Sequence
Kiersten M. Ruff
Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can adopt a range of conformations from globules to swollen coils.
This large range of conformational preferences for different IDPs raises the question of how conformational
preferences are encoded by sequence. Global compositional features of a sequence such as the fraction of
charged residues and the net charge per residue engender certain conformational biases. However, more
speciﬁc sequence features such as the patterning of oppositely charged residues, expansion driving residues,
or residues that can undergo posttranslational modiﬁcations can also inﬂuence the conformational ensem-
bles of an IDP. Here, we outline how to calculate important global compositional features and patterning
metrics that can be used to classify IDPs into different conformational classes and predict relative changes in
conformation for sequences with the same amino acid composition. Although increased effort has been
devoted to determining conformational properties of IDPs in recent years, quantitative predictions of
conformation directly from sequence remain difﬁcult and often inaccurate. Thus, if quantitative predictions
of conformational properties are desired, then sequence-speciﬁc simulations must be performed.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered
regions (IDRs) have been implicated in a diverse set of cellular
functions [1–5]. Here, we will use the term IDRs to account for
both disordered regions within a larger protein or a protein that is
completely disordered. IDRs are deﬁned as sequences that fail to
adopt a stable fold autonomously at physiological conditions.
However, this does not imply all IDRs are nondescript random
coils [6, 7]. Instead, as with the diverse set of functions they
perform, IDRs also adopt a diverse set of conformational properties
and biases as compared to folded and chemically denatured proteins
(Fig. 1) [8–12]. The observed conformational diversity among
IDRs raises two important questions: (1) How are conformational

properties encoded in sequence? (2) Can we predict conforma-
tional properties directly from sequence without the aid of simula-
tion or experiment?
Two sequence features are particularly important to consider
for determining conformational biases from sequence. The ﬁrst is
global amino acid composition. This feature refers to parameters
that can be calculated without taking the order of the residues into
account, for example, the fraction of positively charged residues
( f+), the fraction of negatively charged residues ( f), and the
fraction of charged residues (FCR) within a sequence. The second
feature is sequence patterning. In this case, the actual ordering of
residues is important for encoding conformational biases. One
example is the patterning of oppositely charged residues.
In terms of global amino acid composition, IDRs are generally
distinct from folded proteins. Speciﬁcally, IDRs are deﬁcient in
hydrophobic residues but are enriched in polar and charged

for IDRs listed in Table 2 (circles), folded proteins (yellow squares), and chemically denatured proteins (yellow

IDRs are colored by the region they fall into in the diagram of states: Region 1, blue; Region 2, lime green;

and dashed lines refer to the ﬁts of Rh ¼ R0Nν from Marsh and Forman-Kay [12] for folded and chemically
denatured proteins, respectively. Whereas folded and chemically denatured proteins follow a power law
relationship closely, IDRs show a divergence from a simple relationship. For a given sequence length, IDRs
span a whole range of Rh values and can be as compact as folded proteins, as well as more expanded than

residues [13]. However, IDRs can be further divided into compo-
sitional subclasses, and these subclasses have inherent conforma-
tional preferences [10, 14, 15].
The balance between chain–chain and chain–solvent interac-
tions dictates an IDR’s conformational preferences [14, 16]. IDRs
that prefer chain–chain interactions will adopt compact/globular
conformations on average. In contrast, conformations will be
expanded/coil-like on average for IDRs where chain–solvent inter-
actions dominate. When chain–chain and chain–solvent interac-
tions are perfectly counterbalanced, the conformational ensemble
of an IDR is maximally heterogeneous and akin to a Flory Random
Coil (FRC) [17, 18].
Synthesis of results from experiments and simulations for
archetypal IDRs led to the creation of the diagram of states
(Fig. 2) [10, 14, 15]. This synthesis classiﬁes IDRs into four
different compositional subclasses based on the fraction of posi-
tively charged residues ( f+) and the fraction of negatively
charged residues ( f) within each sequence. Here, f+ and f can
be combined to yield two main measures: (1) the fraction of
charged residues, FCR ¼ f+ + f, and (2) the net charge per
residue, NCPR ¼ f+  f. Assuming physiologically relevant con-
ditions (pH ~ 7, temperature ~ 37 C, etc.), ﬁxed charge state, low
hydrophobicity, and low proline content (<15%) (see Note 1), the
four compositional subclasses and the conformational predictions
associated with each are described below:
1.1
R1: FCR < 0.25
and |NCPR| < 0.25;
Globules and Tadpoles
Region 1 (R1) consists of IDRs that are deﬁcient in charge. Exam-
ples include polar tracts, such as polyglycine and polyglutamine
tracts, found in proteins correlated with at least ten neurodegener-
ative diseases [19]. Given the charge deﬁciency, these sequences
generally prefer chain-chain interactions and tend to adopt compact
conformational ensembles, sometimes referred to as globules [8, 9,
20]. However, the compact nature of the ensembles does not imply
that only a small subset of conformations is sampled, akin to folded
proteins. On the contrary, ensembles that adopt compact confor-
mations can be equally or even more heterogeneous as compared to
ensembles that sample more traditional coil-like states [21]. Here,
heterogeneity refers to the degree of dissimilarity of individual
conformations within the ensemble.
1.2
R2: 0.25 
FCR  0.35
and |NCPR|  0.35;
Range from Globules
to Coils Depending
on Context
Region 2 (R2) consists of IDRs that can generally be classiﬁed as
intermediate polyampholytes with intermediate FCR values and
roughly equal number of positively and negatively charged residues
( f+  f). Examples include the C-terminal IDR of the human cell
cycle regulating protein p27 [22] and the C-terminal IDR of the
B. subtilis cell division protein FtsZ [23]. The intermediate FCR
values in this region make it so that neither charged nor uncharged
residues dominate the conformational preferences. This implies
Predicting Conformational Properties from Sequence
349

that these sequences cannot be easily classiﬁed by conformation due
to composition alone. Instead, additional sequence features, such as
sequence patterning, will dictate the conformational preferences of
these sequences.
1.3
R3: FCR > 0.35
and |NCPR|  0.35;
Charge Patterning
Dictates Compaction
from Coil to Hairpin
Region 3 (R3) consists of IDRs that are strong polyampholytes. An
example includes the IDR within the human PQBP-1 protein
which is involved in splicing and transcriptional regulation
[15, 24, 25]. Given the high fraction of charged residues in these
sequences, the patterning of oppositely charged residues is impor-
tant for the conformational preferences of these sequences. The
details of charge patterning will be discussed later (Subheading
3.3). Generally, well-mixed sequences adopt more expanded con-
formations,
whereas
segregated
sequences
form
hairpin-like
stretches due to blocks of oppositely charged residues interacting
with each other [15]. However, this expansion versus compaction is
relative and dependent on composition.

Coils
and Semiﬂexible Rods
Region 4 (R4) consists of IDRs that are strong polyelectrolytes—
sequences that have a bias for one type of charge over another.
Examples include protamines which are arginine-rich proteins that
are important for DNA stabilization during spermatogenesis
[10,
26]
and
a
linker
histone
chaperone
prothymosin-α
[11, 27]. This combination of bias for one type of charge, as well
as high FCR, implies these sequences often adopt expanded con-
formations as a result of repulsive interactions between like charges
and the preference for charged residues to be solvated [28]. Thus,
as sequences in this region become stronger polyelectrolytes, chain-
solvent interactions increase, and they transition from coils to
semiﬂexible rods [10].
Below, we describe a protocol to extract global amino acid
composition features, such as FCR and |NCPR|, and thus the
region of the diagram of states, as well as how to qualitatively
predict the conformational properties of an IDR(s) (Subheading
3.1). However, as described above, conformational preferences of
IDRs that fall in R2 and R3 cannot be determined by amino acid
composition alone. Instead, sequence patterning will mediate con-
formational preferences. However, current sequence patterning
metrics that have been utilized for IDRs can only make predictions
on relative changes in conformation for sequences with the same
amino acid composition. Therefore, there does not exist a step-by-
step protocol for predicting conformational properties for an indi-
vidual IDR that falls into R2 or R3 on the diagram of states. Given
this, the remaining Methods sections of this chapter will not be
written as protocols but instead highlight what conformational
properties can and cannot be predicted given a certain set of
sequence features, as well as how these sequence features are calcu-
lated. These subsections will be divided into the following topics:
classifying experimentally determined IDRs within the diagram of
states (Subheading 3.2), extracting conformational information
from charge patterning (Subheading 3.3), extracting conforma-
tional information from other sequence patterns (Subheading
3.4), applying patterning metrics to understand the effects of phos-
phorylation on conformation (Subheading 3.5), extracting quanti-
tative conformational information from sequence (Subheading
3.6), and the future of predicting conformation from sequence
(Subheading 3.7).

IDR Sequence(s)
The sequence analyses described in this chapter should only be
performed on an IDR, and the remaining sections assume the
reader has already identiﬁed the IDR(s) from the protein(s) of
interest. An IDR can make up a portion of the protein or be the
entire protein. An IDR(s) within a protein of interest can be

identiﬁed using experimental data, the protein disorder database
DisProt (http://www.disprot.org/), or various disorder prediction
algorithms. How to predict disorder from a protein of interest has
been described in detail in a previous protocol [29], and the accu-
racy of different predictors has recently been assessed [30]. How-
ever, below is a non-comprehensive list of online tools that make
predictive identiﬁcations of disordered regions or identify experi-
mentally determined IDRs given a sequence or UniProt protein
identiﬁer [31].
1. IUPred2A (https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot) utilizes IUPred2
[32, 33] and ANCHOR2 [34, 35] to make predictive identi-
ﬁcations of disordered regions and disordered binding regions,
respectively, for one or a set of sequences. A stand-alone version
of the program package can also be downloaded for high-
throughput predictions.
2. PONDR (http://www.pondr.com/) makes predictive identiﬁ-
cations of disordered regions for single sequences with the
choice of one or multiple algorithms trained using different
types of experimental data and disordered regions [36–43].
3. MobiDB (http://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/) predicts disorder for
any sequence with a UniProt identiﬁer [44]. More speciﬁcally,
MobiDB-lite combines eight different prediction algorithms to
derive a consensus prediction for long IDRs. The program can
also be downloaded for large-scale analyses.
4. Experimentally determined IDRs can be extracted from the
DisProt database (http://www.disprot.org/) [45]. The Browse
feature allows users to search for a protein of interest using the
protein’s name, UniProt identiﬁer, or sequence. Additionally,
the entire set of IDR sequences can be extracted for analysis
(Subheading 3.2).
If the user plans on examining more than one IDR sequence,
then the IDR sequences should be saved in FASTA format. For a
single IDR sequence, FASTA or plain text format will generally
work best.

1. Go to http://pappulab.wustl.edu/CIDER/analysis/.

rich (see Note 1). A charge patterning parameter, κ, is also
listed. The details of this parameter will be discussed below
(Subheading 3.3). The output page also plots each sequence on

by the user.
5. The diagram of states region can be used to predict qualitative
conformational properties from global amino acid composition
(Fig. 3). If the IDR resides in R1 and its fraction of proline
residues is less than 15%, its length is less than 100 residues, and
its FCR is less than 0.2, then the sequence is likely globally
compact compared to an FRC. If the IDR resides in R1 and its
fraction of proline residues is greater than or equal to 15% or its
length is greater than or equal to 100 residues or its FCR is
greater than or equal to 0.2, then a qualitative prediction
cannot be made for this sequence. This is because high proline
fraction and long sequence lengths can lead to more extended
conformations than predicted from FCR and |NCPR| alone (see
Notes 1 and 2). Additionally, the FCR boundary between R1
and R2 is ad hoc, and thus as sequences approach an FCR of
0.25, the accuracy of predictions is reduced. As explained in
Subheading 1, if the IDR resides in R2 or R3, then its confor-
mational properties cannot be predicted by global amino acid
conformation alone. Instead, sequence patterning will dictate
its conformational preferences. However, there are several pro-
blems with using sequence patterning to predict conforma-
tional properties. First, there are many types of sequence
patterns that can be considered for IDRs (Subheadings 3.3
and 3.4), and the interplay between these patterns has not
been well studied. Additionally, sequence patterning can only
yield predictions on relative global compaction/expansion
when comparing sequences with the same global amino acid
composition (i.e., same FCR and |NCPR|). Thus, there is
currently no way to predict global conformational properties
compared to an FRC of a single IDR that resides in R2 or R3.
However, Subheadings 3.3 and 3.4 will describe how to calcu-
late patterning metrics for IDRs and what one can and cannot
predict in terms of conformation from these features. If the
IDR resides in R4, then the sequence is likely to be globally
expanded as compared to an FRC.
6. If users wish to analyze the sequence properties of a large
number of IDRs, then the software package localCIDER can
be
downloaded
from
http://pappulab.github.io/
localCIDER/ [46]. localCIDER is a Python package that can
extract the same sequence features as CIDER. localCIDER
takes in a sequence as a string or a ﬁle in which a single IDR
sequence is listed in FASTA format. Thus, if multiple IDR
sequences are to be examined, then each sequence will need
its own FASTA ﬁle. Furthermore, localCIDER gives the user
access to calculations of additional sequence features that are
not part of the CIDER Web server, including more local
354
Kiersten M. Ruff

sequence properties, as well as user-deﬁned parameters such as
patterning of a user-deﬁned set of residues (Subheading 3.4.2).
The set of functions of localCIDER are divided into six main
categories: single-value sequence analysis functions (including
FCR, NCPR), position-speciﬁc sequence analysis functions,
phosphorylation functions, sequence permutation functions,
plotting functions, and additional miscellaneous functions.
More detailed descriptions of the features of localCIDER are
beyond the scope of this chapter but can be found at http://
pappulab.github.io/localCIDER/.
However,
speciﬁc
sequence features that can be extracted from localCIDER and
provide conformational predictions have been discussed (FCR,
NCPR) and will be further discussed below (κ, Ω).
7. After localCIDER is downloaded and installed, the following
code can be utilized to run a localCIDER function (i.e., get_-
phase_plot_region()) using Python:

Classifying
Experimentally
Determined IDRs
within the Diagram
of States
DisProt is a database of experimentally determined IDRs (http://
www.disprot.org/) [45]. Users who want to use DisProt for statis-
tical analyses of IDRs must be aware of several caveats. First, for a
single DisProt entry, the same IDR (identiﬁed with the term Disor-
der by the Structural state branch of the Disorder Ontology) will be
listed multiple times if this IDR has been characterized using dif-
ferent experimental techniques (Ex: DP00005) or in different
papers (Ex: DP00007). Second, within a DisProt entry, identiﬁed
IDRs may be a subset of (Ex: DP00008) or overlap in linear
sequence space with (Ex: DP00018) other IDRs listed. Third,
some regions listed in the Structural state branch are actually
ordered regions (Ex: DP00549). Thus, if the user downloads the
DisProt data using either the FASTA or TSV format with the Name
space Structural state and the Fields Regions, then the ﬁle will
contain sequences of all the regions listed in the branch Structural
state, which includes all of the caveats listed above. To circumvent
these
caveats,
DisProt
has
added
a
consensus
ﬁeld
which
Predicting Conformational Properties from Sequence
355

merges subset and overlapping regions and classiﬁes each combined
region as a function region (F), order state (S), disorder state (D),
transition (T), or transition with interaction (I). Thus, for statistical
analyses of IDRs, users should extract the sequences that corre-
spond to the consensus disorder state regions (IDRs) for each
DisProt entry.
If users want to analyze all consensus IDRs in DisProt, then the
following steps can be taken:
1. Go to http://www.disprot.org/.
2. Select Download at the top of the page.
3. Download the database in JSON format.
4. Use Python to extract the sequences of all consensus IDRs
from the downloaded JSON ﬁle as follows.
5. Optional:
remove
identical
sequences
that
come
from
orthologs.
As of March 19, 2019, DisProt contains 1236 unique IDRs.
We restricted our analysis to IDRs of length longer than 15 amino
acid residues given that short sequences are inappropriate to classify
in the diagram of states. This is due to the fact that the conforma-
tions of short sequences are dominated by entropic effects and thus
should all behave relatively similarly regardless of composition
[48]. With this length ﬁlter, the database was reduced to
356
Kiersten M. Ruff

879 sequences with 40% of sequences falling in R1, 35% of
sequences in R2, 22% of sequences in R3, and 3% of sequences in
R4 (Fig. 2). This classiﬁcation implies that the conformations of at
least 57% of known IDRs (regions R2 and R3) cannot be predicted
by composition alone. This percent is likely even higher given that
the R1 and R2 boundary is ad hoc and the R2 boundary may be
more appropriately moved to a lower FCR value (FCR  0.2),
especially as sequences become longer (see Note 2). Overall, for a
large portion of IDRs, examining global compositional properties
alone does not yield speciﬁc predictions about conformation, and
thus other sequence features must be examined.
Conformational preferences are also dictated by sequence pat-
terning, particularly for IDRs that fall in R2 and R3 of the diagram
of states. As sequences increase in FCR, the patterning of oppositely
charged residues has an increased impact on conformational pre-
ferences. However, other features such as the patterning of expan-
sion driving residues, aromatic residues, or posttranslational
modiﬁcations may also control conformational preferences, partic-
ularly for sequences in R2 where the FCR is lower. In the next two
sections, we outline the patterning metrics utilized for IDRs.
3.3
Extracting
Conformational
Information from
Charge Patterning
Patterning of oppositely charged residues has thus far been the
most well-studied patterning feature of IDRs. Charge patterning
has been shown to modulate the conformations of sequences from
R2 and R3 both computationally and experimentally [15, 22, 49–
52]. There are two main metrics that have been introduced to
quantify charge patterning in an IDR sequence: (1) κ introduced
by Das and Pappu and (2) sequence charge decoration (SCD)
introduced by Sawle and Ghosh [15, 50].

For each sliding window, nw, the per window charge asymme-
try, σi, is calculated. Then, δseq is the mean squared deviation of
charge asymmetry per window compared to the overall/global
charge asymmetry. To bound κ between zero and one, each
sequence is normalized by the most charge segregated sequence
that can be realized given the amino acid composition (δmax) (see
Note 3). κ is calculated for two window lengths (ﬁve and six), and
Predicting Conformational Properties from Sequence

then the ﬁnal κ is the average of the two values. Thus, as κ increases
from zero to one, oppositely charged residues become more
segregated for a given composition.
κ can be calculated for a single sequence or a set of sequences
using
the
Web

CIDER
(http://pappulab.wustl.edu/
CIDER/analysis/) or the get_kappa() function in localCIDER
(http://pappulab.github.io/localCIDER/) [46].

here, N is the number of residues, and qm and qn are the charges of
residues m and n, respectively. SCD can be calculated using the
get_SCD() function in localCIDER (http://pappulab.github.io/
localCIDER/) [46].
3.3.3
Comparing κ
and SCD
For a given amino acid composition, κ and SCD are generally highly
correlated. Figure 4a shows the correlation between κ and SCD for
three representative IDRs and their κ permutants that have been
studied in the literature [15, 22, 49]. As κ goes from zero to one
(i.e.,
oppositely
charged
residues
become
more
demixed/
segregated), SCD becomes more negative. The R2 values for the
individual IDR correlations are shown in Fig. 4b. If the R2 is
calculated over all sequences shown in Fig. 4a, then the correlation
between κ and SCD decreases (R2 ¼ 0.63). This is because it is
inappropriate to compare κ across different amino acid compo-
sitions. By deﬁnition, κ is calculated by normalizing to the most
segregated sequence with the given composition. This deﬁnition
implies that a κ of 0.2 will not have the same meaning for two
sequences if the FCR and |NCPR| of the two sequences are
different.
3.3.4
How Do κ and SCD
Correlate
with Conformational
Properties?
It has been shown both computationally and experimentally that,
for a given amino acid composition, the demixing of oppositely
charged residues leads to a conformational compaction as κ goes to
one and SCD becomes more negative (Fig. 4c and d) [15, 22, 49–
52]. Simulations have shown that the compaction is due to a
preference of hairpin-like architectures in which blocks of oppo-
sitely charged residues hinge the chain in order to interact
[15]. Quantitatively, this compaction can be realized by quantifying
the sequence length-normalized radius of gyration, Rg/√N, where
N is the sequence length and Rg is given by:
Rg ¼

here, ri is the position vector of atom i and n is the number of
atoms. By dividing by √N, sequences of different lengths can be
directly compared. Figure 4 depicts how Rg/√N varies as a func-
tion of κ (Fig. 4c) and SCD (Fig. 4d) for simulations of three
representative IDR amino acid compositions [15, 22, 49]. Each
IDR generally shows a decrease in Rg/√N as κ increases or SCD
decreases. However, for different amino acid compositions, the
same κ or SCD value can correspond to vastly different degrees of
compaction given by Rg/√N (Fig. 4c and d). This implies that
both κ and SCD can yield information on the relative compactness
for a given amino acid composition but cannot, alone, quantita-
tively predict the degree of compaction across different amino acid

compositions. In other words, two sequences with the same κ or
SCD but different amino acid compositions cannot be assumed to
have the same average conformational properties, such as Rg/√N.
3.3.5
Weaknesses of κ
As mentioned above, one weakness of κ is that it is inappropriate to
compare κ values across different amino acid compositions. Addi-
tionally, because κ is calculated by using sliding windows, long-
range effects are ignored. For example, Table 1 shows three
sequences with κ ¼ 1, yet the spacing between the oppositely
charged blocks varies. The distance between oppositely charged
blocks is likely to affect the degree of compaction these sequences
prefer. However, κ cannot distinguish between these three
sequences since κ only considers the charge asymmetry within
windows of ﬁve and six residues.
3.3.6
Weaknesses
of SCD
Unlike κ, SCD explicitly accounts for long-range interactions.
However, SCD has its own set of biases. Figure 5a shows each
unique DisProt sequence of length greater than 15 on the diagram
of states. Here, each sequence is colored by its SCD value.
Sequences with |NCPR| ~ 0 generally show low SCD values (blue

colors), whereas sequences with |NCPR| > 0.35 generally show
large SCD values (reddish colors). Intermediate |NCPR| values
show varied SCD values. Plotting SCD versus |NCPR| shows that
the relationship between SCD and |NCPR| at these intermediate |
NCPR| values is length dependent (Fig. 5b). Long sequences can
have positive SCD values at |NCPR| < 0.1, whereas shorter
sequences generally need |NCPR| > 0.15 to reach these same
SCD values. The dependence of SCD on |NCPR| and length is
expected given how SCD is deﬁned (Subheading 3.3.2). However,
recognizing the intrinsic biases of SCD is important if this metric is
to be used to quantitatively predict conformational properties
(Subheading 3.6.2). Additionally, given the dependency of SCD
on both composition and length, there is not a one-to-one correla-
tion between SCD and conformational properties. Thus, like κ, it
appears to be inappropriate to compare SCD across different amino
acid compositions.
3.4
Extracting
Conformational
Information from Other
Sequence Patterns
3.4.1
Patterning
of Expansion Driving
Residues
Other sequence patterns besides the pattern of oppositely charged
residues can also inﬂuence conformational preferences. Martin et al.
observed that the unphosphorylated sequence of the Ash1 IDR
(FCR ¼ 0.2, NCPR ¼ +0.18, fraction of proline residues ¼ 0.14)
has a uniform distribution of proline and charged residues across
the sequence [53]. This led them to assess how the mixing of
proline and charged residues (Pro, Lys, Arg, Glu, Asp) versus all
other residues correlated with the compaction of Ash1 based on
scrambled sequences. They termed this mixing parameter Ω, where
Ω is analogous to κ except for the patterning asymmetry parameter,
σ, now deﬁned as:
σ ¼
f þ==P  f others

2
f þ==P þ f others


here, f+//P is the fraction of charged and proline residues, and
fothers is the fraction of all other amino acids (i.e., fothers ¼ 1  f+//
P). Ω can be calculated using the get_Omega() function in localCI-
DER (http://pappulab.github.io/localCIDER/).
The unphosphorylated Ash1 IDR sequence yields Ω ¼ 0.1.
Martin et al. then shufﬂed the positions of the prolines and charged
residues and found that Rg decreased as Ω increased from zero to
one (Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient ¼ 0.81). These results sug-
gest that the patterning of expansion driving residues (prolines and
charged residues) can lead to sequence-encoded conformational
preferences. Speciﬁcally, uniform mixing of expansion driving resi-
dues can lead to a preference for expanded conformations.
Predicting Conformational Properties from Sequence
361

3.4.2
General Patterning
A general patterning parameter, ΩX, can also be deployed to quan-
tify the distribution of a single residue or a set of residues, named
set X. In this case, the patterning asymmetry parameter, σ, is now
deﬁned as:
σ ¼
f X  f others
ð
Þ2
f X þ f others
ð
Þ
here, fX is the fraction of residues in set X, and fothers is the fraction
of all other amino acids (i.e., fothers ¼ 1  fX).
ΩX can be calculated using the get_kappa_X(grp1) function in
localCIDER
(http://pappulab.github.io/localCIDER/),
where
grp1 is the list of residues in set X. For example, if one wants to
calculate the patterning of aromatic residues within a sequence,
then grp1 ¼ [‘W’,‘Y’,‘F’]. However, given how δmax is calculated
within localCIDER, it is only appropriate to calculate ΩX if the
global fX is greater than 0.1 (see Note 4).

Applying
Patterning Metrics

the Effects

on Conformation
Both Ω and SCD have been used as metrics to understand the
effects of phosphorylation on conformational preferences. Martin
et al. found that Ω maintained a similar value upon phosphorylation
of the Ash1 IDR (unphosphorylated ¼ 0.10; phosphorylated
¼ 0.13) [53]. The low Ω values for both unphosphorylated and
phosphorylated Ash1 IDR were used to help explain the invariance
in global dimensions (Rg) measured for both sequences. Addition-
ally, SCD has been used to identify phosphorylation sites that can
induce maximal change in protein conformation [54]. The assump-
tion is that a large change in SCD following minimal phosphoryla-
tion (introduction of phosphomimetic(s) in the sequence) indicates
that those phosphosites are likely to lead to large changes in the
conformational properties of the sequence. Thus, by comparing
speciﬁc phosphosites, or sets of phosphosites, across a protein
using SCD, predictions can be made as to which site(s) will have
the largest effect on changing conformation. However, examina-
tion of a larger set of phosphorylated sequences will be needed to
determine how general both these ﬁndings are.

Extracting
Quantitative
Conformational
Information from
Sequence
The above sequence features only yield qualitative conformational
information for a given sequence. However, one may want to
predict quantitative conformational properties from sequence with-
out the aid of additional simulations or experiments. The following
two subsections highlight efforts to quantitatively predict confor-
mational properties of IDRs directly from sequence. Although
some strides have been made to uncover sequence features that
correlate with deviations from coil-like behavior, the results from
these efforts show that a general framework to quantitatively pre-
dict IDR conformation from sequence is still lacking. This implies
additional studies will be needed to uncover how conformational
properties are encoded in sequence.

3.6.1
Extracting Rh from
Sequence
As can be observed from Fig. 1, a single unifying relationship
between Rh and chain length alone is not observed for IDRs.
Thus, Marsh et al. tried to determine what sequence features lead
to deviations from a simple power law relationship for IDRs
[12]. They found that the fraction of proline residues, the net
charge of the sequence, and whether or not the sequence had a
ﬂanking polyhistidine tag had the greatest inﬂuence on the com-
paction of an IDR, given the features they tested. Given these
results, the scaling relationship between Rh and chain length was
adjusted to include terms that accounted for these sequence fea-
tures. Although this method generally improves the prediction of
Rh over using chain length alone for the IDRs examined, the mean
percent error for the IDRs in Table 2 is still 15% (Fig. 6). This
implies that this method does not account for the full set of
sequence features needed to accurately describe the size of an IDR.
Tomasso et al. used a similar strategy to Marsh et al. to predict
Rh from sequence but instead adjusted the scaling relationship to
include the average polyproline II (PPII) propensity of the sequence
[55]. Figure 6 shows the measured versus predicted Rh values for
the IDRs from Table 2 using this method. The Tomasso et al.
method shows a similar mean percent error (18%) as compared to
the Marsh et al. method. Additionally, Tomasso et al. found that the
average PPII propensity alone could not recover the experimental
Rh values for all 22 IDRs they studied. Importantly, it was observed
that charge–charge interactions also inﬂuence the degree of com-
paction of an IDR.
3.6.2
Comparing
Conformation
to a Reference Coil: Chain
Expansion Parameter
Whereas the previous efforts focused on global amino acid compo-
sition features, Ghosh and colleagues developed a theory to predict
IDR compaction compared to an FRC as a function of sequence
charge patterning, three-body repulsion, and excluded volume
interactions [50, 54]. As a result, the chain expansion parameter,
x, can be predicted for each sequence and is deﬁned as:
x ¼
R2
E
R2
E,FRC
here, R2
E corresponds to the end-to-end distance of the given
sequence, and R2
E,FRC corresponds to the end-to-end distance of
the reference FRC of the same length. Thus, x quantiﬁes the degree
of compaction/expansion of a chain compared to an FRC of the
same length.
Additionally, x can be determined from experimentally deter-
mined Rg values using the following approximation (assum-
ming IDRs follow uniform FRC scaling which may not always be
an appropriate assumption [6, 7]):

here, N is the sequence length, b is the bond length, and l is the
Kuhn length [7, 17, 18, 50]. The bond length, or average distance
between two Cα atoms, is generally taken to be 3.8 A˚ [11]. Fitting
R2
E,FRC from FRC simulations for the 409 disordered linkers from
Harmon et al., we ﬁnd l ¼ 10.3 A˚ [56]. With these parameters in
hand, we can calculate x for known IDRs using the Rg values
determined
from
small-angle
X-ray
scattering
experiments
(Table 3).
Figure 7 compares these x values to the predicted x values using
the theory of Ghosh and colleagues. Here, each marker corre-
sponds to a single sequence, colored by the |NCPR| for that
sequence. Figure 7 shows that |NCPR| is not generally predictive
of whether a sequence will be collapsed or expanded experimen-
tally, whereas the prediction of x by theory is highly biased by |
NCPR|. Speciﬁcally, theory suggests that any sequence with a low |
NCPR| will be predicted to be collapsed, any sequence with a high |
NCPR| will be predicted to be expanded, and there exists some
variability in conformation in the intermediate |NCPR| range.
Given that |NCPR| is not highly correlated with conformational
preferences determined experimentally, these results suggest that
this theory is still missing important sequence features that dictate
the conformational preferences of IDRs.

Predicting Conformational Properties from Sequence

3.7
The Future
of Predicting
Conformation from
Sequence
At this juncture, IDR conformations cannot be quantitatively
predicted from sequence [12, 54, 55, 57]. Instead, simulations
and/or experiments are necessary to extract conformational prop-
erties of a given IDR. Thus, the question becomes: How can we
improve upon the current prediction methods to quantitatively
predict IDR conformational properties? A one size ﬁts all theory/
model is unlikely to capture the wide diversity of IDR sequences. As
computers and algorithms get faster, one potential route is to
simulate many sequences, on the order of 100s–1000s, in a partic-
ular composition/sequence region and use machine learning tech-
niques to uncover the relationship between sequence features and
conformation. These regions will likely have to evolve past the

patterning, length, and proline content.
Until such a method can be implemented, the best way to
determine conformational properties of a given IDR without
doing experiments is to run simulations. Over the recent years,
atomistic simulation methods to study IDRs have improved in
both efﬁciency and accuracy, making medium throughput studies
of IDRs accessible [58–61]. Additionally, IDR-speciﬁc coarse-

grained methods have been developed which further enhance the
throughput of determining conformational properties for many
IDRs [57, 62, 63]. However, one still needs to be aware of force
ﬁeld-speciﬁc biases, including over-compaction of conformational
preferences observed for many explicit solvent force ﬁelds and the
assumptions utilized by coarse-grained models when using simula-
tions to predict conformation (see Note 5) [64].
A recent study performed coarse-grained simulations on IDRs
that were previously studied using small-angle X-ray scattering
[62]. It was observed that even when compositionally similar
IDRs have comparable ensemble-averaged conformational proper-
ties, such as length-normalized Rg, the underlying ensembles can
be drastically different. These results suggest that even if a method
to quantitatively predict ensemble-averaged conformational prop-
erties, such as Rg, Rh, or x, from sequence is developed, important
conformational information may still be missing. For instance, two
sequences may have similar ensemble-averaged conformational
properties but have different underlying conformational features
that modulate the function of the sequence. These conformational
features, such as conformational heterogeneity and sequence-
speciﬁc contacts, will be more difﬁcult to predict directly from
sequence. Thus, simulations and/or experiments may still need to
be conducted in order to connect conformational properties to
function.

Notes
1. A high fraction of proline residues (≳15%) can promote more
expanded conformations than may be expected by just consid-
ering FCR and |NCPR|. For one, proline is highly soluble and
thus prefers to be solvated [28]. Additionally, proline can pro-
mote stiffness in conformations due to its own structural
restrictions [65]. Thus, the boundaries of the diagrams of states
may be different for IDRs with high-proline content.
2. Length can also inﬂuence conformational properties of IDRs.
To show this, <Rg/√N> was calculated for the 409 IDR
linkers simulated by Harmon et al. as a function of sequence
length and diagram of states region [56]. Figure 8 shows that
the average length-normalized Rg generally increases in each
region as the sequence becomes longer. These results imply
that longer sequences may tend to be more expanded even if
they have the same compositional properties as shorter
sequences.
3. δmax can only truly be identiﬁed by enumerating all sequence
combinations; however, this is often infeasible. Thus, CIDER/
localCIDER use computational tricks to identify the δmax of an
Predicting Conformational Properties from Sequence
381

IDR and bypass this enumeration given that for certain
sequence compositions, there are known patterns that yield
δmax. (1) If the sequence only consists of positively and nega-
tively charged residues and |NCPR| ≲0.7, then calculating
δmax is trivial and is given by grouping all the positively charged
residues together and then adding the negatively charged resi-
dues to the end of the sequence. (2) If the sequence only
consists of positively and negatively charged residues and |
NCPR| ≳0.7, then the charged group with the smaller num-
ber of residues is grouped together and moved along the
sequence to determine δmax. (3) If the number of neutral
residues is greater than or equal to 18, then the δmax sequence
takes the form neublock-posblock-neublock-negblock-neublock.
Here, neublock denotes a string of at least six consecutive
neutral residues, posblock is a string of all the positively charged
residues in the sequence, and negblock is a string of all the
negatively charged residues in the sequence. This type of
splitting of the neutral residues is necessary given that κ is
calculated using window lengths of ﬁve and six. (4) If the

number of neutral residues is less than 18, then the same
pattern is used, but δ is calculated for all the different length
combinations of the neutral blocks. Then, δmax is taken to be
the maximum of these δ values.
4. As mentioned in Note 3, CIDER/localCIDER use computa-
tional tricks to determine the δmax of an IDR. However, these
tricks can fail if fX is small. For small fX, δmax is calculated using
trick 2 from Note 3. However, if fX < 0.1, then the δmax of the
sequence may actually involve separating the X residues into
multiple blocks rather than placing them together in a single X
block. Because such a scenario is not included in the tricks to
calculate δmax, this can lead to κ values that are greater than one.
Additionally,

5. Previously explicit solvent force ﬁelds have been observed to
produce globally over-compact conformations, as well as overly
stable secondary structure, for IDRs compared to experimental
results [61, 66, 67]. However, recent adjustments have been
made to many of these force ﬁelds in order to promote chain–
solvent interactions in IDRs [61, 64]. Although these adjust-
ments generally lead to better agreement with experimental
results for IDRs, they also often lead to destabilization of
folded proteins [61, 64]. Overall, these results suggest that
care must be taken for the choice of force ﬁeld and water
model when running explicit solvent simulations of IDRs in
order to extract accurate conformational properties. Some of
the problems with explicit solvent models can be resolved by
using implicit solvent models for studying IDR conformational
ensembles. The ABSINTH implicit solvent model has an estab-
lished track record for producing experimentally consistent
conformational ensembles [10, 22, 49, 53]. Additionally,
recent improvements to the ABSINTH model have been
deployed in order to correct for inaccuracies in descriptions
of local conformational equilibria [59]. Given this and that the
ABSINTH model reduces the computational expense of simu-
lations compared to explicit solvent models, the ABSINTH
implicit solvent model and force ﬁeld paradigm should allow
for medium throughput predictions of IDR conformational
ensembles. Coarse-grained simulations can further reduce the
computational costs of extracting conformational properties of
IDRs. However, the accuracy of predictions from these models
depends on what length scale the IDR is represented by, what
interactions are included, and how these interactions are para-
meterized. Thus, when running coarse-grained simulations,
the user should be aware of these choices and how such choices
may affect the results.

Enhanced Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Intrinsically
Disordered Proteins
Matteo Masetti, Mattia Bernetti, and Andrea Cavalli
Abstract
Molecular dynamics simulations represent a powerful tool to gain insights into structural and dynamical
features of biomolecular systems. Nevertheless, their recognized limitation in terms of achievable timescales
becomes particularly severe when dealing with slow processes. In such cases, the employment of enhanced
sampling methods, which allow accelerating the characterization of rare events in a timeframe consistent
with conventional computational resources, results as crucial. In particular, such advanced techniques have
proven highly valuable in the context of protein folding and, speciﬁcally, to explore the conformational
ensemble spanned by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Here, we describe how to set up molecular
dynamics simulations with one of these enhanced sampling approaches (namely, Parallel Tempering
Metadynamics in the Well-Tempered Ensemble) using the NTAIL peptide as a test case.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) represent a signiﬁcant por-
tion of the proteome lacking dominant secondary and tertiary
structures under native conditions [1]. It has been estimated that
25–30% of eukaryotic proteins are mostly disordered, and about a
half of the human proteome contains long disordered sequences
(>30% residues) [2, 3]. These include the so-called intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs), which represent unstructured portions
within well-folded proteins and between well-folded domains.
Among transcription factors and signaling proteins, the percentage
of long disordered regions increases up to 70%, underscoring the
relevance of IDPs (or IDRs) in both physiological and pathological
conditions [2, 3]. The intrinsic ﬂexibility coupled with high con-
formational heterogeneity leads to multiple functional advantages
for IDPs/IDRs that cannot be achieved by conventionally ordered

structures [4]. Indeed, while a dominant folded structure is neces-
sary to accomplish catalysis, transport, and other functions strictly
dependent on well-deﬁned three-dimensional features [5, 6],
intrinsic disorder can be exploited to bind speciﬁcally, but tran-
siently, biomolecular counterparts [7]. Owing to their ability to
easily interconvert among distinct conformations, IDPs also excel
in the recognition of several structurally unrelated partners, often
exploiting disorder-to-order transitions upon binding [7]. This
adaptability is reﬂected by the fact that IDPs are often found at
“hubs” (central nodes with many partner) of large protein–protein
interaction networks, being involved in key processes of cell biology
like signaling and regulation of transcription and translation [8]. In
this context, IDPs complement the functional role of ordered
proteins, and it has been suggested they provide an evolutionarily
successful strategy to achieve complex functions while economizing
on the size of the genome [3, 9]. Unfortunately, this complexity is
mirrored by the seriousness of diseases associated with IDPs mis-
regulation. Point mutations, exposure to toxins, and alterations in
post-translational modiﬁcation of these proteins can easily lead to
misfolding and in turn to aggregation and/or ﬁbril formation
[10]. It is therefore not surprising that many complex pathologies
like cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, just to name a few, are
related to aberrant IDP functionality [2, 10]. From this standpoint,
IDPs have recently emerged as potential drug targets, even though
their intrinsic ﬂexibility and the lack of well-deﬁned pockets and/or
protein surfaces pose serious challenges for conventional drug dis-
covery endeavors [11, 12].
IDPs have long been neglected by the scientiﬁc community due
to the bias toward folded structures affecting the available methods
for structure determination. Indeed, well-established experimental
techniques like X-ray crystallography are ill-suited to characterize
the highly dynamic and heterogeneous ensemble of conformations
covered by IDPs. Conversely, NMR spectroscopy, small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS), and ﬂuorescence Fo¨rster resonance energy
transfer (FRET) are currently emerging as leading experimental
techniques to tackle the problem of structural characterization of
IDPs [3]. Describing the structure of proteins in terms of an
ensemble is, however, not a trivial task, and all these methods rely
on a pool of structures obtained by computational means
[7, 13]. Two distinct approaches can be followed to this aim:
selecting a limited number of structures from large conformational
libraries and generating them through the physically motivated
sampling provided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
[7, 13].
Provided a reliable force ﬁeld able to capture the relevant
interactions at a molecular level, MD simulations are in principle
able to generate the Boltzmann-weighted ensemble of structures
by solving Newton’s equations of motion [14, 15]. Two main
392

challenges exist for MD simulations in the ﬁeld of IDPs. First and
foremost, classical mechanics force ﬁelds have mostly been devel-
oped to treat structured proteins. When subsequently employed to
model IDPs conformational ensembles, they revealed unable to
stabilize more extended states, as typically observed in experiments
on disordered proteins, while instead favoring the collapse into
more compact structures [16–18]. In part, this is related to the
limitation in computational power which has not allowed, until
very recently, to observe folding and unfolding events through
MD simulations and hence to spot inaccuracies of parameteriza-
tion. This aspect will not be further covered in this chapter. Here,
we only mention that the development of accurate force ﬁelds to
treat IDPs is an active area of research, and several efforts have been
undertaken to validate and correct them from known deﬁciencies
[19–26]. The second issue arising when simulating IDPs is related
to the abovementioned limitation of sampling. Indeed, huge
computational power would be required to exhaustively explore
all the relevant states visited by these proteins. A viable option is to
employ so-called enhanced sampling methods. These are sampling
schemes speciﬁcally designed to speed up the exploration of phase
space and to statistically characterize main free energy minima and
associated barriers in the regime of limited computational resources
[27, 28].
Typically, two classes of enhanced sampling methods can be
considered: those that rely on the notion of collective variables
(CVs) and those that do not (often referred to as “tempering
methods”) [27]. CVs represent (linear or nonlinear) combination
of the atomic positions (q(x), where x is the system’s conﬁguration)
that can be used to describe the rare event one wishes to accelerate,
for example, the sampling of the conformational space of an IDP,
with the help of external biases. In particular, metadynamics is one
such CV-based enhanced sampling methods where the exploration
of the phase space is boosted by adding to the potential energy of
the system (the force ﬁeld) Gaussian-shaped potentials deposited at
even time intervals in the CV space (VG(q(x),t)). An added value of
metadynamics is that, when suitable convergence conditions are
met, the history-dependent bias also provides an unbiased estimate
of the underlying free energy surface [29, 30]. It is important to
note that the choice of CVs is of critical importance for the efﬁ-
ciency and convergence not only of metadynamics but of all
CV-based free energy calculation techniques. Several variants of
metadynamics have been developed during the years. Here, we
focus on the broadly employed well-tempered declination (WTMe-
taD), which often provides a better convergence behavior over the
original method [30]. The theory of WTMetaD has been recently
reviewed in excellent papers [31, 32], including an interesting
application presented in a chapter of this book series [33], and
will not be further covered here. Instead of relying on CVs,

tempering methods enhance the exploration of phase space taking
advantage of more convenient statistical ensembles [27]. This is
usually (but not necessarily) accomplished by running in parallel
several replicas of the system at different temperatures (Parallel
Tempering, PT, or Replica Exchange MD, REMD) [34] or using
scaled potential energy functions (Hamiltonian REMD [35] and
variants) [36, 37]. At even time intervals, exchanges between repli-
cas are attempted according to a simple Metropolis Monte Carlo
scheme:

where V(x) is the potential energy associated with conﬁgurations xi
and xj of the system at temperatures Ti and Tj, respectively. As a
consequence, low-temperature replicas are enriched in conﬁgura-
tions sampled at high temperature, ensuring an efﬁcient crossing of
energy barriers [27].
CV-based and tempering methods can be considered as con-
ceptually distinct enhanced sampling methods that can be conve-
niently combined in order to take advantage of individual beneﬁts
and overcome limitations. For example, metadynamics can be very
effective in reconstructing the free energy surface for rare events
once proper CVs can be identiﬁed through chemical intuition or
careful analysis of previous simulations. Unfortunately, this is not
always possible, and in real case scenarios, choosing adequate CVs
can be rather difﬁcult. Indeed, during a typical setup procedure, the
user ﬁrst performs trial simulations using CVs that are expected to
reasonably describe the relevant event under investigation. Subse-
quently, by monitoring the system behavior during such prelimi-
nary runs, the quality of the choice is assessed, as these initial CVs
can result unsuitable or insufﬁcient to guide the system toward a
wide exploration of the conﬁgurational space. Thus, the analysis of
such trial runs can suggest the use of more suitable CVs, if not even
inspire the deﬁnition on new ones. When suboptimal CVs are
employed, hysteresis effects and convergence problems in the
reconstruction of the free energy are expected. Tempering methods
do not suffer from the need to deﬁne CVs, even though boosting
all degrees of freedoms at once (or a large part of them) can lead to
less efﬁcient exploration of the event one wishes to observe, and
convergence of equilibrium populations can require very long sim-
ulation time. In the context of protein folding, metadynamics has
long been successfully combined with PT/REMD (PTMetaD)
[38], as the latter method provides an unspeciﬁc acceleration of
all the orthogonal degrees of freedom not explicitly accounted for

by the chosen CVs. As a consequence, the convergence on the
reconstructed free energy is highly improved. The exchange proba-
bility now must take into account the bias potential released in each
replica [38]:

A caveat in this combined approach is related to the perfor-
mance of PT/REMD. In fact, for the method to be efﬁcient,
neighboring replicas must be close enough in the temperature
space to allow a high acceptance ratio in the Metropolis Monte
Carlo moves. This requirement is met whenever a sufﬁcient overlap
between energy distributions is obtained. Unfortunately, potential
energy ﬂuctuations scale inversely with the number of degrees of
freedom of the investigates system (ΔE /
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
p
) [35]. That is, in
order to cover a certain temperature range, a signiﬁcant amount of
replicas is typically required. This, in turn, translates to high
computational costs to carry out efﬁcient PT/REMD simulations,
strongly limiting the use of this enhanced sampling technique to
small systems. However, this practical issue can be attenuated by
taking
advance
of
the
Well-Tempered
Ensemble
(WTE)
[39]. Within the WTE formalism, the potential energy of the
system is employed as a CV running a conventional WTMetaD
simulation. It has been shown that this procedure has the effect of
enhancing the ﬂuctuations of the potential energy while preserving
the average value of the unbiased ensemble. Moreover, when com-
bined with a PT/REMD Scheme (PT-WTE), the larger energy
ﬂuctuations (to an extent determined by the applied bias factor)
allow covering a given temperature range with a signiﬁcantly smal-
ler number of replicas [39]. This approach, complemented with
WTMetaD, where the bias is also applied over conventional CVs, is
usually referred to as Parallel Tempering Metadynamics in the Well-
Tempered Ensemble, or PTMetaD-WTE [40]. In this case, the
exchange probability of the underlying PT/REMD scheme is for-
mally the same as for PTMetaD, with the only exception that the
bias on the potential energy as a CV enters in the exchange
probability too.
In this chapter, following a recently published article [41], we
will use PTMetaD-WTE to explore the relevant states of the well-
known IDP represented by the C-terminal domain, NTAIL (com-
prising amino acid residues 443–524) of the Sendai virus nucleo-
protein [42]. Moreover, we will focus our attention to residues
472–497 since the central portion of the peptide (amino acid
residues 476–492) has revealed a relatively high helical propensity,
giving rise to differently folded states. In particular, H1 (residues
479–484), H2 (476–488), and H3 (478–492) are prevailing states

with an estimated helix population of 36%, 28%, and 11%, respec-
tively, with the remaining 25% being unfolded (or random coil, RC;
see Fig. 1) [43]. Notwithstanding the usefulness of PTMetaD-WTE
in characterizing complex molecular systems, as witnessed by the
rich literature exploiting this method [44–49], we stress that several
other effective enhanced sampling approaches can be envisioned to
study IDPs [50–52].

Software
As already mentioned in the previous paragraph, several enhanced
sampling methods can be exploited to explore the conformational
ensemble of IDPs. For each technique, different setup choices can
lead to different combinations of software and scripting tools. In
particular, the protocol that we suggest can be reproduced with the
programs reported below, but other valid choices can be made.
Moreover, for each software, the speciﬁc version that we employed
to carry out the calculations is reported. The reader must bear in
mind that different program versions can lead to slightly different
results and that the provided input ﬁles are not necessarily sup-
ported by newer software versions. We refer to the documentation
of each program for installation instructions and general informa-
tion. A schematic representation of the whole workﬂow followed to
carry out the simulations is provided to the reader in Fig. 2.

Methods
3.1
Preparation
of the Molecular
System
In the original article, the PTMetaD-WTE simulation was per-
formed starting from a representative structure of the H1 state of
the NTAIL peptide (see Fig. 1) [41]. Since it is not publicly available
yet, we will start building the peptide from its primary structure.
1. The Amber suite of programs provides an excellent starting
point for any biomolecular simulation. Here, we will exploit
the functionalities of the tleap module of Amber to build the
molecular system from scratch (see Note 1). The peptide, with
the acetyl (ACE) and N-methylamide (NME) capping groups
to ensure the neutralized N- and C-terminus, respectively, can
be easily obtained as follows (see Note 2):
(a)
foo ¼ sequence {ACE ASN ASP GLU . . . SER ALA THR NME}
(b)
writepdb foo pept.pdb
(c)
quit
The so obtained ﬁle pept.pdb will be the input for the
subsequent setup of the molecular system actually employed
for simulations (see Note 3).
2. Having obtained a starting structure for NTAIL, the following
step is to generate the initial conﬁguration of the whole molec-
ular system including explicit water molecules and ions and the
corresponding topology required by GROMACS. First of all,
we need to choose an appropriate force ﬁeld for our simula-
tions. We choose the ff99SB∗[58] modiﬁcation of the Amber
ff99SB [59] force ﬁeld combined with the ff99SB-ILDN cor-
rections [60]. This force ﬁeld is not present in the GROMACS
distribution and must be downloaded from the “User Contri-
bution” section of the website (http://www.gromacs.org/
Downloads/User_contributions/Force_ﬁelds).
From
the
very practical perspective, to allow the software reading such
external force ﬁeld, the newly downloaded directory contain-
ing all the parameter ﬁles should be placed either in the same
directory where constructing the initial conﬁguration of the
system or, more generally and when possible due to potential
restrictions in administration privileges, in the share/gromacs/
top path (i.e., where all the other native force ﬁelds that come
398
Matteo Masetti et al.

with the software are located) inside the GROMACS installa-
tion directory. We can now build the topology for the peptide
with the pdb2gmx tool of GROMACS:
(a)
pdb2gmx -ignh -f pept.pdb -o ntail.gro -p ntail.
top
Right after having interactively speciﬁed the force ﬁeld, the
water model to employ will also be asked for by pdb2gmx. For
our system, as a reasonable compromise between accuracy of
the simulations and computational cost, we chose the TIP3P
water model, which was already employed in previous works in
the context of IDPs producing satisfactory results (see Note 4).
3. The next step is to specify the shape and size of the simulation
box containing the solvated peptide. We will use a cubic box
with a side length determined by the diameter of the system
plus a buffer of 18 A˚ in each direction (see Note 5). Then, we
will solvate the empty volume of the simulation box with water
molecules. To do so, we will use sequentially the editconf and
genbox tools:
(a)
editconf -f ntail.gro -o ntail-box.gro -bt cubic
-d 1.8 --c
(b)
genbox -cp ntail-box.gro -cs spc216.gro -p ntail.
top -o ntail-wat_only.gro
4. We then use the tool genion to add the counterions to the
system (see Note 6). In particular, genion replaces water mole-
cules with the type of ions speciﬁed by the user (see Note 7). It
requires a run input ﬁle (ions.tpr ﬁle) obtained through the
GROMACS preprocessor grompp (see the GROMACS manual
for further information):
(a)
grompp
-f
ions.mdp
-c
ntail-wat_only.gro
-p
ntail.top -o ions.tpr
(b)
genion -s ions.tpr -o ntail-wat_ions.gro -neutral
-p ntail.top -pname NA -nname CL
The whole system can now be visualized with VMD (see
Fig. 3).

1. In the following steps, we will report all the relevant details to
equilibrate the replicas, to perform the preliminary PT-WTE
simulation, and, ﬁnally, to carry out the actual production run
of PTMetaD-WTE. Since there might be clashes between the
atoms of the newly prepared systems, it is advisable to perform
an energy minimization before starting the MD phases. A run
consisting of 5000 steps of steepest descent is in general
enough to remove all the possible bad contacts.
2. We now need to thermalize the system at different temperature
values for the subsequent PT-WTE run. In particular, we will
use eight replicas (replica index, 0–7) with temperatures
T0 ¼ 298.00, T1 ¼ 310.80, T2 ¼ 324.15, T3 ¼ 338.07,
T4 ¼ 352.60, T5 ¼ 367.73, T6 ¼ 383.53, and T7 ¼ 400.00 K
(see Note 8). All replicas must be independently equilibrated at
the target temperature (T0–7) in the canonical ensemble (also
known as NVT ensemble, i.e., the statistical ensemble charac-
terized by constant number of particles, N, constant volume, V,
and constant temperature, T) (see Note 9).
Fig. 3 Starting from a pdb structure (folded region highlighted in blue, unfolded
ones in white), the system is prepared for the MD simulations by specifying a
simulation box of appropriate size (blue edges), ﬁlling it with solvent molecules,
and adding a proper number of ions (yellow spheres)
400

3. If we were to run a PT/REMD simulation with the eight
replicas as prepared in the previous step, we would then obtain
a very low acceptance ratio due to the poor overlap between
energy distributions. Therefore, we will now enhance the
energy ﬂuctuations of each replica performing a WTMetaD
simulation using the potential energy as a CV (WTE). More-
over, we combine WTE with the PT/REMD formalism to
allow conﬁgurational exchanges (PT-WTE). To do so, we
need to prepare, for each replica:
(a)
a GROMACS input ﬁle: prod_nvt_${i}.mdp
(b)
a PLUMED input ﬁle: plumed.dat.${i} (see Note 10)
where the ${i} ﬂag stands for the index of the ith replica
(0, 1, . . ., 7). These ﬁles will be identical except for the nominal
temperature speciﬁed.
4. Within the PLUMED input ﬁle, all the relevant instructions for
the program to carry out the PT-WTE simulation must be
deﬁned. To this end, the METAD action tells PLUMED to
activate
a
metadynamics
simulation
using
“ene”
as
CV. Actually, “ene” is a label that we use to specify the
ENERGY collective variable. We use a frequency for Gaussian
deposition of 250 steps, a Gaussian height of 2.5 kJ/mol, and a
width of 500 kJ/mol units (values speciﬁed for the PACE,
HEIGHT, and SIGMA keywords, respectively). The Gaussian
bias,
for
each
replica,
will
be
saved
in
a
ﬁle
named
“HILLS_PTWTE.${i}.” In WTE, the energy ﬂuctuations will
be enhanced by a factor equal to the square root of the bias
factor. Here, we set the BIASFACTOR to 50, which corre-
sponds approximately to seven times larger ﬂuctuations com-
pared to those experienced in the canonical ensemble. The ﬁnal
PLUMED input ﬁle will look like:
ene: ENERGY
wte:
METAD
ARG=ene
PACE=250
HEIGHT=2.5
SIGMA=500.0
FILE=-
HILLS_PTWTE BIASFACTOR=50.0 TEMP=${i}
PRINT ARG=ene,wte.bias STRIDE=50 FILE=COLVAR
ENDPLUMED
As it might be noticed, the METAD action is also asso-
ciated with a label (“wte”), which is used as an argument (ARG
keyword) by the PRINT directive. In particular, here we ask
PLUMED to print in a ﬁle named “COLVAR.${i}” (FILE
keyword) the values of the “ene” CV and the total bias experi-
enced by the system (“wte.bias”) with a frequency of 50 MD
steps.
5. The PT-WTE simulation can be ﬁnally started with the usual
mdrun
tool
of
GROMACS-4.6.7
like
in
conventional
Enhanced Sampling of IDPs
401

PT/REMD runs. The only caveat, here, is to activate the
PLUMED plug-in with the dedicated ﬂag –plumed. The num-
ber of replicas and the frequency of exchange attempts (each
100 steps) are controlled by the GROMACS native ﬂags –multi
and –replex, respectively:
mdrun –s ntail.tpr –plumed plumed.dat –multi 8 –replex 100
6. The enhanced ﬂuctuations of the PT-WTE run can be moni-
tored by taking advantage of the Gnuplot plotting tool, with
the following command line:
pl “COLVAR.${i}” u 1:2 w l
Repeating the same command for all the COLVAR ﬁles,
one should get a plot similar to Fig. 4. The aim of this proce-
dure is the achievement of an improved overlap between the
potential
energies
of
neighboring
replicas,
so
that
the
exchanges can occur. As such, it is sufﬁcient to extend the
PT-WTE run until such condition is fulﬁlled. For instance, as
shown in Fig. 4, for our system, a simulation time of 5 ns was
adequate to observe a substantial increase in the overlap and
thus record exchanges between the neighboring replicas.
7. The bias deposited in the previous steps will be instrumental to
ensure a good acceptance ratio in the subsequent PTMetaD-
WTE. Similarly to step 4, we now need to prepare a new set of
GROMACS and PLUMED input ﬁles for each replica differing
Fig. 4 Time series of the energy ﬂuctuations at increasing (from purple to black) reference temperatures.
Taking advantage of the WTE, the overlap between adjacent replicas becomes substantially improved by
increasing the temperature
402
Matteo Masetti et al.

only in the value of the nominal temperature. In this case,
however, we need to instruct PLUMED to read the previously
released bias (saved in the “HILLS_PTWTE.${i}”) as a con-
stant bias. To this aim, we will use the RESTART keyword and
a fake deposition frequency of 999,999,999 in the “wte”--
labeled metadynamics. This will trick PLUMED to read the
bias, but due to the unreasonably low frequency of deposition,
it will actually not have the chance to modify it. Moreover, in
the same input ﬁle, we also need to specify that we will perform
WTMetaD (label: “metad”) as a function of the CV that we
decide to explicitly bias (this second bias will be saved in a ﬁle
called “HILLS_PTMetaDWTE.${i}”).
8. Since the folded states of NTAIL involve the formation of
α-helix structures, we use the ALPHARMSD collective variable
to describe the helicity content of the peptide [66]. As a second
degree of freedom, we use the radius of gyration (GYRA-
TION), which is a general purpose CV suited to describe the
degree of compactness of a polypeptide sequence [67]. These
CVs will be labeled as “a” and “g,” respectively, within the
PLUMED input ﬁle, and to make them functional, we need to
specify several other parameters controlled by speciﬁc keywords
as reported in the Web manual. Here, we will only focus on the
most important ones. Concerning the ALPHARMSD variable,
we need to tell PLUMED which residues of the protein we
wish to check for the helicity content. This feature is controlled
by the RESIDUES keyword. In our case, the content of
formed α-helix must be evaluated on the whole sequence, so
we will use “all” as the value of the keyword, meaning that all
residues will be considered for this action. This requires
instructing PLUMED with the peptide topology, and this is
in turn controlled by the MOLINFO action, which is fed with a
reference PDB that we supply as an input (speciﬁed via the
STRUCTURE keyword). Conversely, the atoms employed to
evaluate the GYRATION CV are reported in a comma-
separated list as an argument of the ATOMS keyword (in this
case, the PDB index of the 26 Cα atoms of the peptide). Finally,
the WHOLEMOLECULES action is mandatory if we want
PLUMED to reconstruct the chains involved in the speciﬁc CV
(with the keyword ENTITY0 ¼ 1–427) when using MD
engines like GROMACS that break up the molecules when
crossing the sides of the simulation box.
9. WTMetaD is then performed using a Gaussian deposition
frequency of 500 steps, a Gaussian height of 0.4184 kJ/mol,
a bias factor of 15 units, and using a Gaussian width of 0.15 and
0.025 nm in the space of “a” and “g,” respectively. The whole
PTMetaD-WTE input ﬁle should look as follows:

10. We can ﬁnally launch the PTMetaD-WTE simulation with a
command similar to the one used in step 7. The effectiveness of
the bias provided by the previous WTE run can be assessed
checking the diffusion of the replicas across the temperature
ladder (see Fig. 5) and eventually computing the roundtrip time.
The journey of each replica in the temperature space can be
followed by employing the demux.pl script included in GRO-
MACS. Speciﬁcally, by providing the MD simulation log ﬁle,
produced by the GROMACS tool mdrun, with the command:
demux.pl md0.log
Fig. 5 Diffusion of replica 0 in the temperature space. As the plot shows, the initial conﬁguration, from which
the simulation was started at the lowest temperature, roamed freely across the different temperatures
considered. The ﬁrst 50 ns of the PTMetaD-WTE simulation are displayed
404
Matteo Masetti et al.

The replica_temp.xvg ﬁle is generated. In replica_temp.
xvg, each replica is represented by a column, where the differ-
ent indices, in ascending order starting from zero, are
employed to designate the different temperatures visited (see
Note 11). In principle, the simulation should be extended
until a converged free energy surface as a function of the two
CVs is obtained (the utility sum_hills coming with the
PLUMED package can be used to this aim) (see Note 12).
Based on our experience, the previous setup requires at least
300 ns (per replica) of sampling to explore the whole CV
space. Then, the simulation can be further extended to reduce
the statistical error depending on the availability of computa-
tional resources.

Notes
1. In the vast majority of the non-IDP applications, the system is
generated starting from available PDB structures. This is
mostly the case when the simulations are devoted to disentan-
gling the behavior of complex globular proteins found in their
speciﬁc native states. As such, reliable structures from which to
initiate the simulations become a strong requirement. Indeed,
if not already determined by experiments, reconstructing such
complex structural organization from scratch would not be a
trivial task. Conversely, when the initial conformation is not
relevant, it is reasonable to build a linear polymer directly from
the sequence of amino acids. This is for instance true when,
over fractions of the simulation timescales, the solute nature
would allow for substantial and frequent conformational rear-
rangements or the employed sampling technique would pro-
mote the exploration of farther regions of the conformational
space. In such cases, a convenient solution to construct the
linear peptide chain is the usage of the aforementioned com-
mands within the tleap module of Amber.
2. The tleap module of Amber requires a force ﬁeld library to be
loaded. Since the force ﬁeld that we will use for simulations will
be chosen in the following steps exploiting GROMACS tools,
the force ﬁeld loaded by tleap is in this case entirely irrelevant.
Thus, prior to specifying the desired amino acid sequence, tleap
needs to be ﬁrst instructed, for instance, with the following
command:
source leaprc.protein.ff14SB
3. tleap will build the peptide in a fully linear conformation. On
the one hand, this is an optimal choice if one is interested in
Enhanced Sampling of IDPs
405

benchmarking the enhanced sampling method. On the other
hand, a 26-residue long sequence in a linear conformation will
lead to huge simulation boxes when explicit solvent will be
added (see also Note 5). Therefore, depending on the available
computational resources, it might be convenient to manually
bend the peptide operating on the phi/psi backbone angles.
This can be easily done with the Molefacture module of VMD.
Another possibility would be running a quick implicit solvent
simulation with the Amber MD code to obtain a more compact
conformation of the peptide (see, e.g., the tutorial: http://
ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial3/).
4. As we already mentioned in the Introduction, the force ﬁeld
used in this chapter is not speciﬁcally designed for IDPs. Nota-
bly, the inaccuracies of standard force ﬁelds in modeling disor-
dered states are increasingly being recognized as related to poor
representation of protein-water interactions. Thus, improve-
ments in this respect have been recently pursued [20, 26,
68]. For instance, corrections on the water dispersion interac-
tions [20] or a scaling of the Lennard-Jones well depth
between the water oxygen and all the protein atoms [26]
have been shown to produce results in better agreement with
experimental observations. Therefore, depending on the pur-
pose of the calculations, more reliable force ﬁelds can be
employed. However, notice that this can easily translate into a
substantial increase in the computational burden involved, as
these choices would often correspond to employing more
computationally demanding water models.
5. The shape and size of the system come from a careful compro-
mise with the available computational resources. In general, the
simulation box should be large enough to avoid the solute in
the unit cell to interact with the solute images of the periodic
array. In the case of folded structures, setting the box basing on
the diameter of the protein (largest distance between solutes’
atoms) is a wise option. When using cubic boxes, this choice
leads to a large number of solvent molecules at the edges of the
box which are unnecessarily making the simulations more
demanding. For this reason, other shapes of the box can be
envisioned,
like
a
triclinic,
rhombic
dodecahedron,
or
truncated octahedron system. When the purpose of the simu-
lation is to study folding/unfolding events like in our case, one
should also consider an extra buffer to allow the peptide to
adopt sufﬁciently extended conformations. Starting from the
H1 state of NTAIL, this condition was reasonably met with a
buffer of 18 A˚ from the solute and the side of the box (see
Fig. 3).

6. The force ﬁeld parameters used to treat the counterions is a
critical and often overlooked choice of simulations. We suggest
using a recent reparameterization of the most common ions
consistent with the Amber family of force ﬁelds provided by
Joung and Cheatham [69]. These can be easily added to the
ffnonbonded.itp ﬁle of the GROMACS port of the Amber
force ﬁelds.
7. Apparently, there is no agreement in the literature regarding
IDPs on the number of ions that should be added to the
system. Here, we simply add the number of ions required to
neutralize
the
net
total
charge,
but
concentrations
of
100–150 mM for at least sodium and chloride should be
considered when one is interested in better mimicking physio-
logical conditions. More generally, when interested in compar-
ing the outcomes from simulations with experimental data
produced under particular ionic conditions, as similar as possi-
ble conditions should be reproduced in the system setup for the
simulations.
8. When running PT/REMD simulations, one must choose the
temperature range to be spanned, the number of replicas, and
the nominal temperature value assigned to each replica. As a
rule of thumb, the highest temperature must be high enough
to efﬁciently cross the expected potential energy barriers
encountered along the process one wishes to observe. In this
speciﬁc case, we use PT/REMD to improve the efﬁciency of
WTMetaD sampling; therefore, 400 K as the highest tempera-
ture should be enough. This assumption should be addressed
in retrospect by checking the diffusion of the system in the
conﬁguration space in the tens of nanoseconds timescales, for
example. In conventional PT/REMD, the spanned tempera-
ture range is also related to the number of replicas that can be
run in parallel according to the available computational
resources. As already mentioned in the Introduction, replicas
must be close enough in the temperature space to allow efﬁ-
cient exchanges, and this requirement is met only if a good
overlap in potential energy distributions is observed between
adjacent replicas. Assuming a constant heat capacity for the
system along the spanned temperature range, another useful
rule of thumb to make optimal use of resources is to distribute
replicas according to a geometric progression [70]:
T i ¼ T min T max
T min

 i1
N1
9. The replicas can be equilibrated in parallel (i.e., independently
of each other) or, more conveniently, in a subsequent manner.
That is, the equilibrated system at the Ti temperature will serve
Enhanced Sampling of IDPs
407

as starting conﬁguration for both the ith replica of the follow-
ing PT/REMD simulation and for the equilibration of the next
replica in the temperature ladder (T(i + 1)).

11. The script demux.pl that comes with the GROMACS software
outputs two ﬁles: replica_temp.xvg and replica_index.xvg. The
latter can be employed in conjunction with the trjcat tool of
GROMACS to reconstruct the continuous trajectory of each
replica, that is, the trajectory of each initial conﬁguration in its
journey across the temperature space. This is achieved via:
trjcat -f traj_comp?.xtc -demux replica_index.xvg
In principle, if proper diffusion is achieved, each system
should display the same behavior and thus equally explore the
CV space. As a practical note in this respect, in those cases when
the simulation is produced as a series of sequential runs, all the
log ﬁles must be merged into a single md0.log ﬁle before
feeding demux.pl with it. The same reasoning holds for the
trajectories given to trjcat as an input along with replica_index.
xvg (i.e., for each replica, all the trajectory fractions should be
merged into a single one).
12. By enhancing the potential energy ﬂuctuations, the WTE
ensemble distorts the canonical distribution of states. Thus, if
an accurate reconstruction of free energy is needed, this effect
has to be taken into account during a reweighting procedure
[72]. As such, the bias gathered from the two metadynamics,
namely, the one employing the potential energy as a CV
(PT-WTE step) and the one using the more typical deﬁnition
of CVs while keeping static the bias deposited on the potential
energy (PTMetaD-WTE step), needs to be ﬁrst computed.
While the metad.bias of the latter can be easily retrieved via
the driver utility of PLUMED, this is not the case for the bias
on the potential energy, as it implies computing such energy at
each trajectory frame. In this case, the -rerun ﬂag of the GRO-
MACS mdrun tool must be used to read the simulation trajec-
tory and obtain the required metad.bias. Thus, the weight of
each trajectory frame becomes the sum of the two biases com-
puted, and this can be used to build a histogram and in turn
retrieve the free energy. Alternatively, the reweighting step can
be avoided following the smart work-around proposed by
Sutto and Gervasio [47]. Accordingly, a “white” replica at

the temperature of interest is added to the PTMetaD-WTE
simulation. Such a replica does not hold any constant energy
bias, but it will nonetheless efﬁciently exchange with the neigh-
boring replicas, thanks to their enhanced ﬂuctuations provided
by the WTE ensemble. Thus, the free energy along the chosen
CVs can be directly reconstructed from the white replica with-
out the need of any reweighting procedure.

Computational Protocol for Determining Conformational
Ensembles of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
Robert B. Best
Abstract
In modelling experimental measurements from intrinsically disordered proteins, it is essential to account for
the very broad distribution of structures which they populate. A natural method for doing this is via
computer simulations, particularly those that generate a reasonably accurate initial molecular ensemble. In
this chapter, I present a reweighting approach that may be used to determine a conformational ensemble by
combining experimental information with molecular simulations. The advantages and difﬁculties associated
with this approach are brieﬂy discussed.

Introduction
Determining the structures of intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs) is important because it often contains clues to their function
[1]. In contrast to the situation for folded macromolecules, the
structures of IDPs cannot be described as small ﬂuctuations about a
single structure. We know this because in general it is not possible
to ﬁt measurements from IDPs to a single structure model, and in
fact single molecule experiments such as single-molecule Fo¨rster
resonance energy transfer (smFRET) demonstrate that the distri-
butions of pair distances within IDPs are extremely broad, consis-
tent with a disordered polymer chain [2, 3]. Therefore, it is
essential to explicitly consider such diversity when constructing
models to describe experimental data, which is usually ensemble
averaged or averaged over some timescale. For example, one can
determine an initial ensemble from a molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation with a reasonable force ﬁeld, which may be accurate but
still does not reproduce experimental data within error. Experimen-
tal data may then be used to reweight the simulation ensemble

[4]. Confounding such a solution is that the number of relevant
structural observables which can be measured is usually much
smaller than in the case of folded proteins, while the conforma-
tional space populated is vastly larger. Thus, the structure determi-
nation problem is highly underdetermined, and this must be
addressed in any such method. A second issue which is less prob-
lematic in conventional single structure determination is that of
sampling—any simulation must be run long enough to generate a
sufﬁciently representative ensemble of the disordered state.
In this chapter, I describe one method for determining struc-
tural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins. In this
approach, which is possibly the simplest to implement, a simulation
of the unfolded protein is run and subsequently reweighted to
match experimental data. Alternative methods, which are techni-
cally more demanding, are (1) using experimental data as a bias in
running simulations, so as to ensure agreement with experiment
[5], or (2) training a minimalist coarse-grained model to match
experiment [6–8]. Using the biased simulations is advantageous
when the structures sampled by the original simulation are too
dissimilar from those populated in reality, such that it is not possible
to do reweighting. However, this is usually due to deﬁciencies in
the simulation force ﬁeld, which can often be overcome by using a
better force ﬁeld. Biased runs also require the use of a large-enough
ensemble (each member corresponding to a parallel process in the
reﬁnement) to capture the true diversity of the disordered state,
which is obviously challenging for IDPs. Training a coarse-grained
model is much more application speciﬁc and usually requires some
speciﬁc physical insights into the system before starting. For these
reasons, we have focused on the reweighting approach in this
chapter, which is the most general and straightforwardly applicable
method.

Materials
2.1
Force Field
Molecular simulations of biomolecules are run with an energy
function known as a force ﬁeld, which is a simpliﬁed model that
approximates the true potential energy surface. Any method of
ensemble generation will beneﬁt from an accurate force ﬁeld. For
example, in the case of reweighting, an accurate initial model will
allow more of the initial ensemble to be used, resulting in a higher-
quality ﬁnal ensemble. The subject of good force ﬁelds for IDPs has
been reviewed several times recently, and the interested reader is
referred to one of those articles for a more detailed discussion of
this topic [9, 10]. For simulations using explicit solvent, some
examples of reasonable force ﬁelds are Amber ff03ws [11], Amber
99sbws [11], Amber 99SB-disp [12], and CHARMM 36 m [13]
(using the version with the scaled water model described in the
414
Robert B. Best

supporting information of that work). However, running a simula-
tion of an IDP with explicit water requires to use a very large
simulation cell (see below). Therefore, an alternative may be to
use a good implicit solvent model. Although the models may be
somewhat less accurate, this can be corrected to some extent by the
experimental input. The simulations are generally simpler to set up
and run and can be run with a tiny fraction of the resources needed
for explicit solvent. In this case, there are fewer candidate force
ﬁelds which are suitable for IDPs, the best being the ABSINTH
implicit solvent model [14] or alternatively EEF1 [15, 16]. If using
other implicit solvent models such as most Generalized Born mod-
els [17], the simulations will have to be run at a very high tempera-
ture (e.g., 600–800 K) to avoid the over-collapsed structures
typically favored by these models [16].
2.2
Simulation
Software
For a simple reweighting procedure, the choice of simulation code
to run the initial simulations is very ﬂexible, the only requirement
being that it implements the force ﬁeld model desired. The open-
source simulation codes GROMACS [18] and openMM [19] both
implement a variety of force ﬁelds, and the latter has a very efﬁcient
implantation on graphics processing units (GPUs). The ABSINTH
force ﬁeld mentioned above is only currently implemented in the
CAMPARI Monte Carlo code [20].
For implementing experimental biases in simulations (if that
method is used), the requirements are more demanding, as the
code must implement ensemble-averaged restraints. One of the
more actively developed codes for implementing such restraints is
PLUMED [21], which can be used as a plug-in for several MD
codes but has the most complete functionality in conjunction with
GROMACS.
2.3
Experimental
Data
A wide variety of experimental data are suitable for reweighting or
biasing ensembles of IDPs, which have been recently reviewed
[22]. The only requirement is that it should be possible to write
the instantaneous experimental observable as a function of the
protein coordinates. Examples of suitable data include scalar cou-
plings, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), paramagnetic relaxation
enhancements
(PREs)
from
NMR,
FRET efﬁciencies
from
smFRET, and scattering functions from small-angle and/or wide-
angle X-ray scattering. Experimental observables which depend on
the history in the simulation, such as NMR NOE buildup rates,
photon correlation functions from smFRET, or intermediate scat-
tering functions from neutron scattering or light scattering, would
not be straightforward to include. This is because there is no
practical way to reweight simulations to reproduce time-dependent
data that is also correct.

3.1.1
Generation of Initial
Ensemble
1. Ensembles drawn from protein data bank (PDB) statistics. The
simplest way to generate an initial ensemble of protein struc-
tures is to reconstruct coordinates by drawing from a statistical
database of dihedral angles for backbone and side chains from
the protein data bank (PDB) while at the same time respecting
excluded volume (i.e., atoms are not allowed to overlap with
each other). Usually, only loop or coil regions from the PDB
would be used to construct the databases, as their conforma-
tional propensities should be most similar to those of IDPs.
Such models are generally very cheap to run, and the best
known is the ﬂexible meccano algorithm [23]. This type of
model can be a good initial guess if there is evidence already
that the protein is largely unstructured and relatively expanded.
If there is some compaction (e.g., suggested by SAXS) or
evidence of local, cooperatively formed secondary structure
such as helices or hairpins (e.g., from NMR chemical shifts or
scalar couplings), then statistical ensembles may be less appro-
priate: it is relatively unlikely to obtain more compact struc-
tures or signiﬁcant population of secondary structure from
such algorithms.
2. Ensembles from MD/Monte Carlo simulations. An alternative to
drawing from PDB statistics is to sample structures according
to a force ﬁeld energy. This of course requires running an initial
molecular simulation of the intrinsically disordered protein.
For this purpose, either MD or Monte Carlo (MC) sampling
may be used, depending on what is more convenient in the
simulation package being used. Although this seems fairly
straightforward, a number of factors need to be considered to
obtain the best results:
(a)
Choice of initial structure. Every simulation needs to be
started from an initial set of coordinates. Unlike the case
for folded proteins, there is not any initial choice with
special signiﬁcance. One method to generate initial struc-
tures is via excluded volume methods such as ﬂexible
meccano [23], referred to above. Alternatively, one can
generate trial initial structures by running simulations
starting from an extended state in vacuum at a high tem-
perature (e.g., 500 K). The protein will of course quickly
collapse, and so initial states of varying degrees of collapse
can be chosen to run the simulations (care should be taken
that no proline residues have isomerized in this initial
high-temperature run; see Note 1). Good initial structures
would be those with dimensions close to those expected
for an excluded volume chain. For example, for a protein
416
Robert B. Best

with N residues, an empirical relation gives the radius of
gyration (Rg) as:
Rg ¼ R0N ν
ð1Þ
with R0 ¼ 0.1927 nm and ν ¼ 0.598 [24]. It is generally
better to use structures which are too expanded than too
collapsed, as the latter are more likely to be long-lived
kinetic traps. In addition, it is always a good idea to run
several simulations starting from somewhat different ini-
tial structures (e.g., slightly more expanded/collapsed). If

reweighting) are very similar, this suggests that the simu-
lation sampling may have been sufﬁcient; if they are dif-
ferent, then it is certainly not sufﬁcient!
(b)
Sampling method. Because of the lack of structure in most
IDPs, it may sufﬁce to run a very long, unbiased simula-
tion (e.g., 1–10 ms if using MD), as there should not be
long-lived kinetic traps. On the other hand, even the
formation and breaking of local structure such as helices
and hairpins can occur on a microsecond timescale, so it
may be desirable to enhance sampling in some way in
initial ensemble generation. One method may be to run
replica exchange MD (or MC) [25]. The standard tem-
perature replica exchange MD (T-REMD) [26], which
accelerates the crossing of high-energy barriers, should
work well for implicit solvent models. However, for the
large system sizes needed to run IDPs with explicit solvent
(at least IDPs longer than 30–40 residues), it will not scale
well; in that case, replica exchange with solute tempering
(REST or REST-2) [27], or replica exchange between
different protein-water interaction strengths [28], may
offer more scalable alternatives. The choice of optimal
parameters for running such simulations is slightly outside
the scope of this protocol but is already covered very well
in the literature [29]. Replica exchange methods have an
additional advantage in that they generate a number of
different ensembles (e.g., at different temperatures for
T-REMD). This is useful because one can then choose
for reweighting the ensemble which is initially closest to
experiment (i.e., that for which the computed observables
are closes to the experimental values), thus minimizing the
required perturbation to match experiment (see further
discussion below). (For information on the typical ensem-
ble sizes, see Note 2.)
(c)
“Convergence.” Having run the simulation with the cho-
sen force ﬁeld and sampling method, it is necessary to
check whether the sampling is sufﬁcient to generate an
Ensemble Models for IDPs

initial ensemble which is representative of the equilibrium
ensemble in that force ﬁeld. The most common way of
checking this is via the “convergence” of properties in two
simulations initiated from different initial conditions
toward common values [30–32]. Note that having such
a converged ensemble isn’t strictly necessary if one is
doing reweighting, since all that is required is a “reason-
able” initial guess, and the experimental weighting can
help to correct imperfections in both the force ﬁeld and
the sampling. However, obtaining converged ensemble
properties is a helpful indicator because it generally sug-
gests that the simulations are not stuck in a limited set of
nearby local minima but are broadly exploring the allowed
conformational space (see Note 3).
3.1.2
Reweighting
Scheme
Reweighting an initial ensemble to match an experimental observ-
able is a simply stated problem. For each structure i, saved from the
simulation, one independently chooses a weight wi to minimize the
difference between the actual experimental ensemble-averaged data
points hakiexpt and the corresponding ensemble-averaged data com-
puted from the reweighted simulation, hakisim (here, the kth obser-
vation ak could be a J-coupling, RDC, FRET efﬁciency, etc.). That
is, one seeks to minimize χ2 deﬁned as
χ2 ¼
X
k
ak
h
isim  ak
h
iexpt

2
σ2
k,sim þ σ2
k,expt
ð2Þ
here, the errors of the simulation and experiment, σ2
k,sim and σ2
k,expt,
respectively, are used to determine the relative importance of each
data point in the ﬁt (see Note 4). The observables are computed
from the simulation as a simple weighted average:
ak
h
isim ¼
X

ð
Þ=

ð3Þ
in which wi is the weight of frame i with coordinates xi and
computed observable ak(xi), and the sum runs over the frames.
3.1.3
Avoiding Overﬁtting
An obvious question that arises from the above description of
reweighting is how unique the set of chosen weights is. For exam-
ple, if there are 10,000 structures in the initial ensemble and maybe
10–100 experimental data points, one can easily imagine that it is
possible to ﬁnd many sets of weights which could match experi-
ment; that is, the problem is very underdetermined. Therefore,
some additional assumptions are needed to prevent this degeneracy
of solutions. One possible procedure one could imagine is to select
a “minimal ensemble”; that is, choose only the smallest number of
structures that are sufﬁcient to ﬁt the data, but no more. However,
this does not really solve the overﬁtting problem, because it is quite
418
Robert B. Best

possible (indeed likely) that there are many such minimal ensembles
which ﬁt the data but otherwise have quite different properties. The
real problem is that the number of degrees of freedom in the true
ensemble will always be vastly larger than the number of experi-
mental data points that can be supplied, and so it is necessary to rely
somewhat on the distribution of structures obtained in the initial
ensemble. Most reweighting procedures that are now in use try to
match the experimental data while minimally perturbing the origi-
nal ensemble. An example of what is meant by this is shown in
Fig. 1, in which two reweighting solutions are obtained to match an
experimental observable. In the ﬁrst (Fig 1a), essentially only struc-
tures x for which a(x) is very close to haiexpt are chosen; thus, the
average haisim necessarily matches the experiment. In the second
(Fig. 1b), a much broader distribution of structures is chosen which
adheres more closely to the original simulation, but for which the
average haiexpt nonetheless matches haisim. Intuitively, we know
that haisim is likely to come from a broad distribution, and so
extreme solutions such as that in Fig. 1a are unlikely. More likely
is the more modest perturbation shown in Fig. 1b. This is often
expressed in terms of the principle of minimum information or
maximum entropy; that is, we want to maximize the entropy of
the resulting distribution. A practical procedure for achieving this is
to add an entropy “prior” based on the Shannon entropy of the
weights, deﬁned as:
S
wi
f
g
ð
Þ ¼
X
iwi ln wi
ð4Þ
This entropy has the largest possible value when all the weights
are equal; that is, the distribution is identical to the original unper-
turbed ensemble. Thus, maximizing the entropy of the weights
keeps the reweighted ensemble close to the original. The entropy
can be directly incorporated in the scoring function used for choos-
ing the weights as [4]:
G
wi
f
g
ð
Þ ¼ χ2
wi
f
g
ð
Þ  θS
wi
f
g
ð
Þ
ð5Þ
where the parameter θ controls the strength of the entropy prior.
The choice of θ is critical: if it is too small, the prior will have no
effect; the experimental data might be matched perfectly, but the
ensemble distribution could deviate greatly from the original simu-
lation. As θ is increased, the distribution should match the simula-
tion
increasingly
well,
but
without
necessarily
making
the
agreement with experiment much worse (since it is still possible
to ﬁt the data in other ways). Finally, if θ is made too large, the
similarity to the simulation will be too strong, and it will no longer
be possible to ﬁt the data. The ideal θ is the largest one where it is
still possible to ﬁt the experimental data (see Note 5 for choice of θ).
Fig. 2 shows an illustration of this for a simple example of ﬁtting
some smFRET data obtained on the protein R17 [33].

simplest procedure for doing this is by selecting only those conformations
which have q very close to the observable (magenta curve, Ppert(q)). A more
likely (and minimally perturbing) reweighting is shown in (b), in which only the
side peak in the original distribution at high q is eliminated. In (c), we illustrate
the problem of trying to match experimental data which lies far from the
probable region in the original distribution—as a result, only a few extreme
outliers are chosen, which is clearly unlikely to be representative of the true
experimental ensemble. This can be avoided by generating a higher-quality
initial ensemble (e.g., with a better simulation force ﬁeld)

3.1.4
How to Actually
Find the Optimal Weights?
So far, the reweighting process has been discussed in a fairly abstract
manner on the assumption that we know how to search for the
optimal weight set {wi}. One approach to ﬁnding them would be to
use a gradient-based optimization, but the simplest method may be
an MC search in weight space. Such a search also has the capability
to escape local minima in parameter space, should they exist. Brieﬂy,
the algorithm is as follows:
1. Calculate the experimental observables for each frame in the
simulation (i.e., ak(xi)).
2. Set the initial weights wi ¼ 1 for all weights.
3. Make a trial move by perturbing a weight for one frame. Many
trial moves are possible, for example, picking at random one
frame i and trying wi, trial ¼ wi exp [R], where R is a random
number drawn from a uniform distribution in the interval
[1,1].
4. Accept or reject the move using the Metropolis MC acceptance
criterion and the scoring function G({wi}). That is, if
ΔG ¼ G
w1, . . . wi1, wi,trial, wiþ1, . . . wN




 G
w1, . . . wi1, wi, wiþ1, . . . wN
f
g
ð
Þ
< 0,
then the move is accepted and the wi is updated to wi, trial.
If ΔG  0, then a random number R is drawn from a
uniform distribution on the interval [0,1]. If R < exp [ΔG],
then the move is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected and the
current wi is retained.
5. After each move, go back to step 3, try another move, and
continue until the speciﬁed number of moves is completed or
until G({wi}) converges to a stable value.
This MC weight optimization needs to be performed at a
number of values of θ (see Note 5) in order to optimize both the
choice of θ and the set of weights {wi}. In this way, it should be
possible to ﬁnd the least perturbing set of weights. An example of
this is shown in Fig. 2.
3.1.5
Assessing the Final
Weights
Finding a set of weights which ﬁts the data is not sufﬁcient, even if a
maximum entropy prior is used to keep them as uniform as possi-
ble. For example, if only the very tail of the simulated ensemble is in
any way compatible with experiment, the only solution which can
ﬁt the data will have non-negligible weights only for a very small
number of structures. This could be the case, for example, if the
protein was highly collapsed in the original simulation, but in fact
the experimental data suggest it is quite expanded. Then the only
way to match experiment would be for the weights to pick out the
tiny minority of structures in the original ensemble which are more
Ensemble Models for IDPs
421

expanded (see Fig. 1c). Clearly, such an ensemble is unlikely to be
representative of the true distribution sampled in experiment.
There are a couple of possible checks for this outcome:

efﬁciencies for R17 for three different pairs of labelled residues (three different
colors), as a function of urea concentration [33, 36]. Transfer efﬁciencies
decrease as the urea concentration increases, suggesting an expansion of the
unfolded state. (b) Different reweightings are performed in order to match
experiment at each denaturant concentration (i.e., matching data for all FRET
pairs simultaneously), with varying strength of the entropy prior. The ensemble
with the maximum entropy before χ2 diverges is chosen in each case (indicated
by a red arrow in the case of the 7.06 M ensemble (cyan curve)). The mean (c)
end-end distance R and (d) radius of gyration Rg indeed increase with denaturant

1. Plotting distributions of properties of the reweighted ensem-
ble, for example, distributions of pair distances, radius of gyra-
tion, Rg, etc. These distributions should be smooth and not
have sharp spikes, which typically happens when too much
weight is assigned to only a few structures.
2. Computing the size of the partition function for the weights,
that is,
Z w ¼
X
iwi= min

ð6Þ
where min[{wi}] is the smallest weight. As is well known for
partition functions with vanishing zero-point energy, Zw effec-
tively counts the number of states which have signiﬁcant weight
in the ensemble. Ideally, Zw should be a signiﬁcant fraction
(at least 10–20%) of the total frames in the original simulation.
3.2
Validating
and Using
the Reweighted
Ensemble
Once the optimal set of weights {wi} have been determined, these,
in conjunction with the set of structures {xi}, constitute the
reweighted ensemble and can be used for further calculations,
such as computing other observables not used in the reweighting
procedure:
ea
h isim ¼
X
iwiea xi
ð
Þ=
X
iwi
ð7Þ
This allows us to predict the values of observables that have not
yet been measured or, more commonly, to calculate the values of
observables that have been kept aside and not used in ﬁtting
weights. While this practice may seem superﬁcially similar to the
use of Rfree in X-ray crystallography, the meaning is somewhat
different in the context of IDP ensembles. Finding the structure
which minimizes the deviation from the experimental diffraction
intensities in X-ray crystallography is usually an overdetermined
problem; that is, not all the data are needed, and therefore, it is
expected that if a small fraction are left out from the ﬁtting, they
should be accurately predicted by the model; the use of Rfree is
mainly to test whether adding additional degrees of freedom to the
model (e.g., anisotropic B-factors) is really improving the model or
instead leading to overﬁtting.
In contrast, for IDP ensembles, the problem of determining an
ensemble is essentially always going to be underdetermined by the
experimental data, and we have already discussed how a maximum
entropy prior can be used to solve the problem of overﬁtting.
Therefore, testing the effect of additional data or different data
on the resulting ensemble is not so much testing for overﬁtting,
as much as whether the new experimental data contain additional
information. If adding further data does not change the result, then
the new data are redundant. Thus, in comparing smFRET and
SAXS experiments, where the experimental data are expected to
yield similar information on global dimensions of the protein, it was
Ensemble Models for IDPs
423

found that generating ensembles using SAXS (from unlabeled pro-
tein) yielded similar results to FRET data from a protein labelled
with a hydrophilic dye pair, conﬁrming that the two experiments
were yielding similar information as expected [33].
However, it must be noted that inconsistency between ensem-
bles generated from different data sets does not necessarily mean
that the data sets are themselves inconsistent. An obvious example
would be using NMR J-couplings or SAXS scattering functions to
reweight. Since the information content of these two experiments is
respectively extremely local versus global information, the minimal
bias to the simulation to match each experiment could well yield
different ensembles. This does not mean that either ensemble is
“wrong,” rather that they each contain different information, and
using both data sets together would yield a still better ensemble.

Notes
1. To check for cis prolines in initial structures: The ω-dihedral
angle between the proline and the preceding residue, that is,
the dihedral Cα-C-N-Cα, needs to be calculated. If |ω| < 90∘,
then the proline is cis; otherwise, it is trans (usually, it will be
close to 0∘if cis and close to 180∘if trans). Usually, prolines will
be predominantly trans in IDPs, although the exact population
does depend on sequence context and posttranslational mod-
iﬁcations [34]. There are a number of commonly available
programs that can compute these torsion angles, including
the
MDAnalysis
python
package
[35]
(http://www.
mdanalysis.org) or the programs dang or dangle from the
Richardson group (http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu).
2. Initial ensemble sizes (before reweighting): There is no hard
and fast rule about how many structures are needed, but typi-
cally ensemble sizes starting with 104 structures may be
adequate. Having a larger ensemble helps when a stronger
reweighting is required to match experiment, as it allows a
larger number of statistically independent coordinate sets to
contribute to the average.
3. Properties to check for converged sampling: A good global
property to check for IDPs is the radius of gyration Rg, which
can be easily computed by most MD codes as well as the
MDAnalysis tool mentioned in Note 1. In addition, it makes
sense to focus on properties which are directly related to the
speciﬁc
experimental
observables
that
will
be
used
for
reweighting, for example, pair distances in the case of FRET
or NMR PREs or dihedral angles in the case of NMR scalar
couplings. In each case, the aim is that the averages (and dis-
tributions) of such properties should be similar when they are
424
Robert B. Best

computed from simulations starting from different initial con-
ditions. Because such averages often take some time to reach
their equilibrium value, it can be good to plot them as a
function of time (possibly with a running average over a given
time window to smooth ﬂuctuations) in order to determine
which portion of the simulation can be considered “equili-
brated” and used for reweighting and to compute averages.
4. Error estimation from simulation and experiment: The errors
σ2
k,sim and σ2
k,expt are required to compute the deviation from
experiment as measured by χ2. The experimental errors are
meant to be standard errors (i.e., the expected standard devia-
tion of the result if the same experiment were to be repeated
many times). Ideally, this would be determined individually for
each observable, but otherwise an estimate of the typical error
could be used. For the simulations, there are two sources of
error. The ﬁrst is statistical error from the simulation owing to
the fact that the averages are computed from a ﬁnite amount of
sampling. The most common way of estimating this is via block
averaging. To compute this, ﬁrst determine which part of the
simulation can be considered “equilibrated” (see Note 4).
Divide this part of the simulation into a number N of equal-
sized blocks in time; usually, between 10 and 30 blocks is a
good number. Compute the average observable ai for each
block i as the weighted average of a over that block (using the
current weights in the reweighting procedure). The statistical
error

for
the
observable
a
is
then

=N . A second source of error for
simulations is the uncertainty associated with computing the
experimental observable from the simulation, σ2
pred, since the
methods used to compute these observables are often empiri-
cal, approximate methods. Prime examples are the prediction
of chemical shifts or scalar couplings. Generally, it is possible to
obtain some estimate of the prediction error from the original
publication (e.g., for shift predictor or Karplus equation). At
the least, the RMS deviation between ﬁt and data is usually
reported, which is an underestimate of the true prediction error
but a reasonable starting point. Since the statistical and predic-
tion error are independent, they can be added to give the
overall

for
each
observable

5. How to choose the optimal θ in Eq. 5: There is no rule for a
typical value of the parameter θ which is optimal to use in
reweighting—it will depend on the system, the initial ensem-
ble, and the experimental data used. The best way to choose it
is to determine ensembles by reweighting with different values
of θ. As seen in Fig. 2b, increasing θ (and hence the entropy of
Ensemble Models for IDPs
425

the weights) initially results in little change of χ2. Although all
of these solutions would match experiment, most of them
would be overﬁtting. At some point, however, χ2 will increase
sharply because θ is too large and the ﬁt to the data is not good
anymore. The optimal θ is the smallest one before this increase
occurs, thus obtaining the maximum entropy solution while
still ﬁtting to the data. Note also that choosing the ensemble
based on the value χ2 itself is generally not as robust as the
procedure described here. Although χ2 should be approxi-
mately equal to the number of observables in an ideal world,
in reality its value is affected by the accuracy of the error
estimates, as well as correlations between the errors in different
observables.

Abstract
The level of compaction of an intrinsically disordered protein may affect both its physical and biological
properties, and can be probed via different types of biophysical experiments. Small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) probe the radius of gyration (Rg) whereas pulsed-ﬁeld-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
diffusion, ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering experiments can be used to
determine the hydrodynamic radius (Rh). Here we show how to calculate Rg and Rh from a computationally
generated conformational ensemble of an intrinsically disordered protein. We further describe how to use a
Bayesian/Maximum Entropy procedure to integrate data from SAXS and NMR diffusion experiments, so
as to derive conformational ensembles in agreement with those experiments.

Introduction
In contrast to natively folded proteins, intrinsically disordered pro-
teins (IDPs) generally lack well-deﬁned three-dimensional struc-
tures. Consequently, they explore a large number of distinct
conformations, and their conformational properties are thus best
described in statistical terms. One useful and informative way of
representing this large conformational ensemble is through a dis-
tribution of the radius of gyration (Rg) of the IDP. The ensemble
average hRgi gives a rough measure of how compact a protein is and
may, for example, be compared to the values for other proteins of
similar lengths.
For a given conﬁguration of a protein, the Rg may be calculated
as the mass-weighted root mean distance to the center of mass:

where mi is the mass of atom i and ri is the position of atom i with

Experimentally, one may obtain an estimate of the ensemble-
averaged value of the Rg of a protein by a Guinier analysis of small-
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) proﬁles [1] or using various extended
models of the scattering data [2, 3]. For the sake of simplicity, we
will loosely refer to the experimental value as Rg, omitting the
bracket notation and only use brackets for explicitly averaging
computed values. Here, we note also that Rg calculated using
Eq. 1 is not directly comparable to that obtained from analyses of
SAXS data due to contributions to the scattering data from the
solvent layer around the disordered protein [4, 5].
Similarly, but via different physical principles, the hydrody-
namic radius of a protein also reports on the overall expansion of
a protein. The hydrodynamic radius (Rh), also called the Stokes
radius, is deﬁned as the radius of a theoretical hard sphere that
would have the same translational diffusion coefﬁcient as the con-
sidered particle. The translational diffusion coefﬁcient (Dt) of a
protein may in turn be determined, e.g., by pulsed-ﬁeld gradient
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion experiments, ﬂuores-
cence correlation spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering mea-
surements, and is related to Rh through the Stokes–Einstein
equation [6]:
Dt ¼ kBT
6πηRh
ð2Þ
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and η is
the viscosity of the solvent.
Because both Rg and Rh probe the compaction of a disordered
protein, and because they may contain complementary information
about the distribution of states [7], there have been several studies
on the relationship between the Rg and Rh for disordered proteins
and polymers [7–10].
One such approach uses hydrodynamic modelling of protein
conformations [11–13] to relate protein structure to Rh [7, 10]. In
line with theoretical expectations, the authors found that the ratio
Rg/Rh depends substantially on the compaction of the protein
chain, so that compact states have ratios  0.8 and expanded con-
formations have ratios between 1.2 and 1.6. Because the relative
level of compaction of the chain, when quantiﬁed by Rg, also
depends on the chain length, the ratio Rg/Rh also depends on
the number of residues of the protein (N). Recently, these two
effects were combined into a single, physically motivated and

ð3Þ
In addition to Rg and N (number of residues of the protein chain),
the equation contains three parameters that were ﬁtted to maxi-
mize agreement between the model and hydrodynamic calcula-
tions
(α1 ¼ (0.216  0.001)
Å,
α2 ¼ (4.06  0.02)
Å,
and
α3 ¼ (0.821  0.002) Å). As discussed further below, since confor-
mational averaging acts on the diffusion properties, the ensemble-
averaged value that should be compared to an experimentally
measured Rh will not in general be the same as the linear average
over the values of each conformation (hRhi). Also, note that the
equation was parameterized using Rg values calculated from the Cα
coordinates only. Values of Rg calculated in this way are generally
very close to those calculated from all protein atoms, but this
parameterization makes it possible to use the approach to calculate
Rh also for coarse-grained Cα-only models.
Here we provide a step-by-step protocol to calculate Rg—and
subsequently Rh using Eq. 3—from a computationally generated
conformational ensemble of an IDP. Together with calculations of
SAXS data from simulations it is possible to compare the simula-
tions to measurements of compaction. In cases where the com-
puted and experimental quantities are not in perfect agreement,
one may go one step further and reﬁne the computational ensemble
using the experimental data. We thus also demonstrate how to
reﬁne the ensembles by integrating experimental SAXS and Rh
measurements, and thereby generate conformational ensembles
that both take into account the physical principles encoded in the
simulations as well as information from experiments. In addition to
the motivation and description provided in this paper we also make
available a Jupyter (Python) notebook with guided examples for
performing analysis and generating many of the ﬁgures discussed
here. We do, however, not provide instructions for how to generate
conformational ensembles, and the reader is expected to have a
basic understanding of the Python programming language to use
the examples presented.

Methods

Generating
Ensembles
We have chosen the 92 amino acid residues long protein Sic1 as an
example for our calculations, as this protein has been studied exten-
sively by both SAXS and various NMR methods [15, 17]. We used
Campari [19] and Flexible-Meccano [18] to generate two confor-
mational ensembles of Sic1 in its unphosphorylated state. In the
ensemble we generated using Campari (Ensemble 1) we used
Monte Carlo sampling with the ABSINTH v3.2 implicit solvent
model [24] and a temperature of 298 K. The Sic1 protein was
contained in a spherical simulation cell with a radius of 150 Å and
an ion concentration of 140 mM, matching the experimental
condition [15]. For the Flexible-Meccano ensemble (Ensemble 2)
we generated conformations sampling random coil conﬁgurations
as described [18]. As Flexible-Meccano only generates a model of
the protein backbone, we used PULCHRA [20] with default set-
tings to add side chains to these structures and generated Ensemble
2. These side chain coordinates are necessary when we calculate
SAXS data from the conformational ensembles. In total we gener-
ated 32,000 structures for Ensemble 1 and 10,000 structures for
Ensemble 2.

Calculating Rg
and Rh from
Ensembles
Many simulation and protein analysis software packages have the
option of calculating the Rg of the protein. In this example we will
use readily available and open source software. For calculating the
Rg of the conformations we use MDTraj, a Python module for
protein analysis [23]. Below we provide Python code demonstrat-
ing how to load the ensemble and calculate Rg for each structure,
and then calculate Rh for each structure using Eq. 3. In the example
we have collected all conformations of the ensemble in a trajectory
ﬁle (here Ensemble1.trr). Depending on the ﬁle format of the
trajectory ﬁle, one may also need a coordinate ﬁle (structure.
pdb) or a topology ﬁle. Once these ﬁles are loaded, MDTraj is then
used to calculate Rg for each structure in the ensemble, which in
turn is converted into Rh using Eq. 3.
Python Code for Calculating Rg and Rh:
Computing, Analyzing, and Comparing the Radius of Gyration and. . .
433

Once Rg and Rh have been calculated for each structure, these
can be used to generate histograms of Rg (Fig. 1a) and Rh (Fig. 1b),
and the average Rh and the average Rg can be calculated as for
comparison to experimental values. Here we calculate the average
Rh (see Note 1) and the average Rg (see Note 2) as:
hRhitrans ¼  ln ðh exp ðR1
h ÞiÞ
1
ð4Þ
hRgitrans ¼ hR2
gi
1=2
ð5Þ
Here, we have introduced the notation hRhitrans and hRgitrans to
represent averages via transformations that are aimed to represent
the averaging that occurs in the experiments (see Notes 1 and 2 for
further discussion). We also show the (linearly) calculated averages
of Rh and Rg in the plots (Fig. 1) though as explained below, a
better comparison to the experimental data requires calculations of
SAXS intensities from the conformational ensemble (see Note 3).
As described above the ratio Rg/Rh depends substantially on
the compaction of the protein chain, so that compact states have
ratios  0.8 and expanded conformations have ratios between 1.2
and 1.6 [14]. For a protein of 92 residues, the switch-over point
where the Rg/Rh ¼ 1 lies at conformations with Rg  27 Å (see
Note 4). Thus, conformations with Rg < 27 Å have Rh > Rg
whereas conformations with Rg > 27 Å have Rh < Rg. In this way,
the distribution of Rh is “pushed” towards the middle and has less
density in the tails compared to the distribution of Rg (Fig. 1).

two ensembles that we generated of Sic1. Here, Ensemble 1 (red) was generated using Campari and
Ensemble 2 (blue) was generated using Flexible-Meccano as described in the main text. (a) Solid vertical
lines represent the ensemble average Rg (hRgitrans; see Note 2 for the deﬁnition) of Ensemble 1 (red) and
Ensemble 2 (blue). (b) Solid vertical lines represent the ensemble average Rh (hRhitrans) calculated using Eq. 3
and as discussed in Note 1 from Ensemble 1 (red) and Ensemble 2(blue). The experimental values of Rg and Rh
are shown in black. The error of the distribution and averages of Rg and Rh (shown as shaded areas) were
estimated by block averaging using ﬁve blocks
434
Mustapha Carab Ahmed et al.

The distributions of Rg (Fig. 1a) and Rh (Fig. 1b) from Ensem-
ble 1 and Ensemble 2 and the resulting averages can also be
compared to the experimental values from SAXS and NMR
[15, 17]. These results reveal two different scenarios for the two
ensembles. First, hRhitrans calculated from Ensemble 1 (Campari) is
in good agreement with the experimentally determined value of Rh
(Fig. 1b). At the same time, the calculated value of hRgitrans is
substantially lower than the average Rg value estimated from
SAXS experiments (Fig. 1a). Second, for Ensemble 2 (Flexible-
Meccano) we observe the opposite scenario, where the calculated
hRgitrans is close to the value estimated by SAXS (Fig. 1a), and the
calculated hRhitrans is substantially greater than the experimental
value (Fig. 1b).
Disagreement between experiment and simulation is often
indicative of problems with the molecular force ﬁelds or sampling
[25], though differences may also arise from problems in, e.g., the
model used to calculate experimental data from structural ensem-
bles [5, 26]. While it is possible to improve molecular force ﬁelds
directly against experimental data [27], we below describe how one
can reﬁne a speciﬁc ensemble against one or more sets of experi-
mental measurements.
3.3
A Bayesian/
Maximum Entropy
Approach
Above we have analyzed two ensembles and used Eq. 3 to estimate
Rh which in turn could be averaged and compared to NMR diffu-
sion experiments. We also calculated Rg from the protein coordi-
nates, though as noted this value is not directly comparable to the
experimental measurements due to solvation effects [5]. Neverthe-
less, the results suggested discrepancies between experiments and
simulations.
Although there have been continued improvements in meth-
ods and force ﬁelds for sampling the conformational landscape of
IDPs, it is still not uncommon that simulations are not in perfect
agreement with experiments. In such cases, it is possible to bias the
simulation to construct an ensemble that is in better agreement
than the unbiased ensemble [22, 28–32].
We here use such a method to construct two new ensembles by
reweighting the Campari and Flexible-Meccano ensembles with the
experimental data, thus obtaining ensembles that are in better
overall agreement with the SAXS and NMR diffusion experiments.
Speciﬁcally, we use experimental SAXS data [15] and NMR diffu-
sion measurements of Rh [17], and use our recently described
Bayesian/Maximum Entropy (BME) protocol to reweight the con-
formational ensembles [22]. We focus solely on the technical details
of the approach rather than the biological relevance. Also, we
exemplify using two experimental measures of compaction, but
the approach is more generally applicable (see Note 5).

Brieﬂy described, BME is based on a combined Bayesian/Maxi-
mum Entropy framework and enables one to reﬁne a simulation
using multiple sources of (potentially noisy) data. The purpose of
the reweighting is to derive a new set of weights for each conﬁgura-
tion in a previously generated ensemble so that the reweighted
ensemble satisﬁes two criteria: (1) it matches the experimental data
better than the original ensemble and (2) it achieves this improved
agreement by a minimal perturbation of the original ensemble. For
additional details see Bottaro et al. [22] and references therein. In
the current examples, both Ensemble 1 and 2 were generated as
unbiased ensembles and so the initial weights of all structures are
uniform (w0
j ¼ 1=n ), where n is the number of structures in the
ensemble.
The reweighting approach described above may in practice be
achieved by updating the weights, wj, of each conﬁguration in the
input
ensemble
by
minimizing
a
function
(the
negative
log-likelihood) [22, 28]:
Lðw1 . . . wnÞ ¼ 1
2 χ2ðw1 . . . wnÞ  θSrelðw1 . . . wnÞ:
ð6Þ
Here, the χ2 quantiﬁes the agreement between the experimental
data and the corresponding values calculated from the reweigh-
ted ensemble. The second term contains the relative entropy,
Srel, which measures the deviation between the original ensemble
and
the
reweighted
ensemble
Srel ¼ Pn

.
The
temperature-like parameter θ tunes the balance between ﬁtting
the data accurately (low χ2) and not deviating too much from the
prior (low Srel). In practice, we determine this hyperparameter by
evaluating the compromise between balancing the two terms in L
[22, 28] (see Note 6). When more than one set of experimental data
is included in BME, the deviations between calculated and experi-
mental values are summed in a global χ2 function which is the sum
of a χ2 function for each set of data.
In practice, it turns out that a different—and in some cases
more efﬁcient—approach is to minimize L using the method of
Lagrange multipliers, and this is the approach we take here [22, 28,
33] using the BME code, which is freely available at https://github.
com/KULL-Centre/BME.
3.4
Calculating SAXS
Data from Ensembles
The ﬁrst step in the reweighting protocol is to collect the necessary
data and structure it correctly for input in BME. We ﬁrst calculate
the SAXS intensity proﬁles by ﬁtting to the experimental curve
for each structure of the two ensembles using Pepsi-SAXS [21].
Pepsi-SAXS has free parameters for the solvation layer that are
calculated for each ﬁt. To decrease the risk of overﬁtting, we used
436

a two-step procedure. First, we ﬁtted the parameters to each struc-
ture. Second, we calculated the averages of the resulting ﬁtted
values of the solvation parameters and re-ran Pepsi-SAXS with
these parameters ﬁxed to those averages. Alternative methods for
calculating SAXS from conformational ensembles exist [4] and may
also be used (see Notes 7 and 8).
We then structure the input ﬁles as shown below for the SAXS
data. The experimental SAXS input ﬁle is structured such that it
contains the following three columns: the momentum transfer (q),
intensity (I(q)), and the error (σI(q)) (as shown below). Each of
these three columns are m rows long, where m is the number of
experimental data points. The input ﬁle for the calculated values
contains n rows (number of structure in the ensemble), and m + 1
columns. The ﬁrst column is for labeling the individual structure/
frame from the ensemble. Further details for how to structure the
input ﬁles for other data can be found in the original description of
BME and in the online examples [22].

Reweighting Sic1
Ensembles Against
SAXS and NMR
Diffusion Experiments
We used the methods described above to determine a reweighted
ensemble of Sic1 that takes into account both the prior information
encoded in the initial ensemble (from Campari or Flexible-
Meccano) as well as the experimental measurements of compaction
from NMR diffusion and SAXS.
Before reweighting was applied, Ensemble 1 appears too com-
pact when judged by agreement with the Rg-value extracted from
the SAXS data, but is in good agreement with the NMR diffusion
data (Fig. 1). In contrast, Ensemble 2 is in good agreement with
the SAXS-derived Rg, but appears too expanded when compared to
the NMR diffusion measurements (Fig. 1). The goal was therefore
to examine whether one could construct an ensemble that provides
a useful compromise between the two data sets. We note here that
the NMR diffusion data were recorded at 278 K [17], whereas the
SAXS data were obtained at room temperature [15], though we
only expect a modest change in compaction in this temperature
range [34, 35]. We note also that our goal is not to discuss in detail
the conformational ensemble of Sic1, but rather to showcase how
one may combine different measures of compaction.
We reweighted the two ensembles against the NMR and SAXS
data and compared to the unweighted ensembles (Fig. 2). The ﬁrst
step is to choose the temperature-like hyperparameter, θ, that sets
the balance between ﬁtting the data and not deviating too much
from the input ensemble. The latter may be quantiﬁed by
438
Mustapha Carab Ahmed et al.

Fig. 2 Constructing ensembles to improve agreement with experiments. We
used BME reweighting with SAXS and Rh data for Ensemble 1 (a, c, e, g) and
Ensemble 2 (b, d, f, h). We label the Rh data as I(Rh) as we here use intensity-
based averaging of the measurements (see Note 1). (a, b) We plot Neff (the
effective number of frames left after reweighting) vs. χ2 when the scaling
parameter θ is varied (top axis). The left axes show χ2
red for each of the two
experiments, whereas the right axis shows the total χ2 that is the sum of the two
(non-reduced) χ2 values (see Note 8). For further analyses we chose θ ¼ 100
(Ensemble 1) and θ ¼ 7 (Ensemble 2). (c–f) We show the distribution of Rg (c, d)
Computing, Analyzing, and Comparing the Radius of Gyration and. . .

calculating the fraction of the frames in the input ensemble,
N eff ¼ exp ðSrelÞ , that effectively contributes to the calculated
ensemble averages after reweighting. Thus, Neff ¼ 1 corresponds
to the initial unweighted ensemble and a low value of Neff indicates
that only a small fraction of the original ensemble has been selected
to improve agreement with experiments. We scanned values of θ
and calculated the agreement with both the SAXS and NMR diffu-
sion data at each value of θ and for each of the two ensembles
(Fig. 2a, b). Note that we here plot a reduced χ2 (χ2
red) for each of
the two experiments individually but that the optimization acts to
reduce the sum of the two non-reduced χ2-values. Here we deﬁne
χ2
red as χ2
red ¼ m1χ2, where m is the number of data points. Since
there is 179 points in the SAXS measurements, this sum contains a
large contribution from the SAXS data (see Note 8). In our analyses
here, we chose θ ¼ 100 for Ensemble 1 and θ ¼ 7 for Ensemble
2, though in practical applications it would be advised to examine
the results of other choices (see Note 6).
The effect of reweighting can be seen both on the distribution
of Rg (Fig. 2c, d) and Rh (Fig. 2e, f). The more compact Ensemble
1 is shifted to include more expanded structures, bringing hRgitrans
substantially closer to the value estimated from the SAXS data,
while only increasing the calculated Rh value  15% above the
experimental value. Similarly, the more expanded Ensemble 2 is
shifted to give greater weight to more compact conﬁgurations,
bringing the calculated Rh closer to experiment while only shifting
the hRgitrans down by 13%.
While it is convenient to examine the distribution of Rg before
and after reweighting, the actual reweighting is done against the
SAXS data and not the estimated Rg. As explained above, the
solvent layer around the protein also contributes to the SAXS
measurements, and there may be 5–10% difference in the Rg
calculated from the protein coordinates and the value estimated
by SAXS [5]. We thus also show the agreement between the experi-
mental and calculated SAXS curves (Fig. 2g, h). It is clear that the
reweighted SAXS curves are substantially closer to the experimental
data, though there still remains some discrepancy in the low-q
range for Ensemble 1.

Summary
We have shown here how it is possible to calculate Rh from a
conformational ensemble using Eq. 3 and compare to experimental
data obtained, e.g., from NMR diffusion measurements. Such
measurements provide an alternative view of the compaction to
that obtained, e.g., from SAXS experiments, and indeed it has
previously been shown that simultaneous reﬁnement against Rh
and Rg can provide insight into the shape of the distribution of
Rg [7].
We chose the protein Sic1 for exemplifying our analyses since
the level of expansion has been measured for this protein using
both SAXS and NMR diffusion measurements. Since the data were
recorded at slightly different conditions and temperatures, we do
not aim to make strong conclusions about the conformational
ensemble of Sic1 and have used it here mostly to showcase the
methods for analyses.
We generated two ensembles and show that one is in relatively
good agreement with the NMR diffusion data whereas the other is
in better agreement with the SAXS data. At this moment the origins
of these differences are unclear. Variation in experimental condi-
tions such as temperature may affect both Rg and Rh [35]. Also, it is
possible that our approach for calculating Rh is not always sufﬁ-
ciently accurate since it is inherently limited to the accuracy achiev-
able by hydrodynamic modelling [14], and an important question
for future research is whether we can provide better models to link
conformation
and
calculated
values
of
Rh.
Finally,
despite
continued improvement in methods for calculating SAXS data
from ensembles [4] there are still potential sources of error from,
e.g., solvation effects [5]. Nevertheless, we note that by reweight-
ing the ensembles against both sets of experiments it is possible to
construct an ensemble that provides a reasonable balance between
the two. As more proteins are studied by both NMR and SAXS it
should be possible to test and improve our relationship between Rg
and Rh, thus enabling further insight into the rules that govern
compaction of IDPs.

Notes
1. When calculating averages over ensembles, in particular for
broad ensembles such as for IDPs, it is important to take the
correct form of averaging into account. The best way to calcu-
late averages over experimental quantities will depend both on
the type of experiment and often also, e.g., on the time scales
for conformational averaging. Throughout this paper we make
the assumption that averages can be calculated as time-
independent averages over the conformational ensemble. In
the case of measurements of the hydrodynamic radius, Rh, we
have explored two different types of averaging. In case the

1. Here we have introduced the notation
hRhitrans to represent that the averaging takes place on a trans-
formed value (in this case proportional to R1
h ). When Rh is
measured by pulsed-ﬁeld gradient NMR diffusion measure-
ments [36] the NMR signal intensity, I, is proportional to
exp R1
h


and it may therefore be more appropriate to use
this function to perform the averaging over this functional
form, as shown in Eq. 4. It is this intensity-based averaging
that we use here, though in practice we have found it to give
essentially the same result as using hR1
h i
1.
2. Similar to the issue of averaging Rh discussed in Note 1 above,
we use Eq. 5 when calculating averages over the radius of
gyration. This kind of averaging mimics the averaging in the
low-q regime of SAXS curves. Note, however, that hRgitrans
calculated in this way should not directly be compared to
experimental values of Rg since the latter includes solvation
effects. While solvation also affects the hydrodynamic radius,
effects of solvation are implicitly absorbed into the transforma-
tion in Eq. 3.
3. Notes 1 and 2 discuss the transformations that are relevant for
comparing calculated and experimental quantities. We note,
however, that during the reweighting protocol and when one
makes quantitative comparisons between experiments and
computation it is in general better to compare to the direct
experimental quantities. In the case of SAXS experiments we
thus judge agreement and perform reweighting against the
experimentally measured intensities. In the case of the Rh
measured for Sic1 by NMR diffusion experiments, we trans-
form the experimental value of Rh (and its error), as well as the
values calculated for each structure using the function I /
exp ðR1
h Þ, as described in our associated Jupyter notebook.
We note that in the future it might be more appropriate to
perform such ﬁtting directly against the measured intensities as
a function of the gradient strength.
4. The level of compaction as quantiﬁed by the value of Rg at
which Rg ¼ Rh (R0
g) can be estimated by rearranging Eq. 3 to
obtain: R0
g ¼ α1
1 ð1  α3ÞðN 0:60  N 0:33Þ þ ðα2  N 0:33Þ. For
a protein with N ¼ 92 one obtains Rg
0 ¼ 27Å.
5. We have here described approaches to reﬁne ensembles against
SAXS and NMR diffusion measurements. The BME method
has also been used for IDPs with NMR chemical shifts [37],
and may also readily be applied to SANS data, NOEs, scalar
couplings, or other measurements that can be calculated as
averages over conﬁgurational ensembles.

6. Currently, the value of the hyperparameter θ (which sets the
balance between information from the data and the force ﬁeld)
is set manually. In certain cases it may be possible to set it via a
cross-validation approach [37] or it may be integrated out as a
Bayesian “nuisance parameter” [28].
7. We have here used Pepsi-SAXS to calculate X-ray scattering
curves from a conformational ensemble due to its ease of use
and the relatively high computational efﬁciency. The latter is
particularly important for large conformational ensembles. We
note, however, that several other methods exist and suggest
users in particular to keep solvent effects in mind when calcu-
lating and interpreting SAXS data [4, 5]. In the Jupyter note-
book available online we provide a script that performs a
two-pass run of Pepsi-SAXS to ﬁnd a reasonable value of
solvent-related parameters in the calculations.
8. When plotting χ2
red in Fig. 2, we calculate it by normalizing
χ2 by the number of experimental data points: χ2
red ¼ m1χ2.
We note that this is an approximation because the number of
degrees of freedom can be smaller because different parameters
are ﬁtted such as parameters involved in calculating the SAXS
curves. Also, in the case of reweighting, the weights themselves
may be considered as free parameters. Thus, we note that the
reweighting does not involve this normalization, and that the
χ2
red is only shown in Fig. 2 to give the reader an impression of
the level of agreement. We also note that when ﬁtting the Rh
the resulting sum in χ2 only contains a single term. Finally, we
note that we here simply combine the χ2 from the SAXS and
NMR diffusion experiments by adding up the two individual
χ2 terms. In the current implementation, BME does not enable
automatic balancing of independent experiments and instead
sets this balance by the error estimates of the individual experi-
ments. We note, however, that while the SAXS data for Sic1
contains 179 individual data points, the amount of information
in SAXS experiments typically corresponds to a smaller number
of parameters [38] and a more careful balance between the
information in the SAXS and NMR diffusion experiments
should take such effects into account [39].

Binding Thermodynamics to Intrinsically Disordered Protein
Domains
Arne Scho¨n and Ernesto Freire
Abstract
Many proteins are intrinsically disordered or contain one or more disordered domains. These domains can
participate in binding interactions with other proteins or small ligands. Binding to intrinsically disordered
protein domains requires the folding or structuring of those regions such that they can establish well-
deﬁned stoichiometric interactions. Since, in such a situation binding is coupled to folding, the energetics of
those two events is reﬂected in the measured binding thermodynamics. In this protocol, we illustrate the
thermodynamic differences between binding coupled to folding and binding independent of folding for the
same protein. As an example, we use the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 that contains structured as
well as disordered domains. In the experiments presented, the binding of gp120 to molecules that bind to
disordered regions and trigger structuring (CD4 or MAb 17b) and to molecules that bind to structured
regions and do not induce conformational structuring (MAb b12) is discussed.

Introduction
1.1
Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry
Isothermal titration calorimetry, ITC, is a technique in which the
heat associated with binding is measured while one reactant
contained in a syringe is stepwise added to the other in the calori-
metric reaction cell. While several techniques are available for bind-
ing studies, only ITC has the advantage of providing the energetic
contributions to the binding reaction. ITC provides directly the
association constant and the enthalpy change associated with a
binding reaction. The Gibbs energy of binding, ΔG, and the
entropy change, ΔS, are calculated from the afﬁnity and enthalpy
change. While a single value of ΔG determines the binding afﬁnity,
different combinations of ΔH and ΔS values can deﬁne the same
ΔG. Since ΔH and ΔS originate from different types of interactions,
their knowledge provides critical information to understand the
nature of a binding reaction, the redesigning of ligand molecules

[1–5], as well as speciﬁc applications such as the discovery and
optimization of drug candidates [6–14].
The enthalpy and entropy contributions to the Gibbs energy
can be visualized in the thermodynamic signature [7, 15, 16] as
shown in Fig. 1. Intrinsic ligand/macromolecule interactions as
well as coupled reactions contribute to the thermodynamic signa-
ture. Among the most common coupled reactions is the presence of
protonation or deprotonation associated with binding. The pres-
ence of protonation/deprotonation can be assessed by performing
the binding reaction in buffers with different enthalpies of proton-
ation [17–19]. Among the intrinsic ligand/macromolecule inter-
actions, two major terms contribute to the enthalpy change, and
also two major terms contribute to the entropy change. They are
indicated in Fig. 1 using lighter colors. The formation of hydrogen
bonds and van der Waals interactions upon binding contribute
favorably to the binding enthalpy. Conversely, the burial of polar
groups that do not participate in hydrogen bonding contributes
unfavorably to the binding enthalpy due to the positive enthalpy of
polar desolvation [20]. The desolvation of nonpolar and polar
Fig. 1 The thermodynamic signature allows a rapid visual representation of the enthalpy (green) and entropy
(red) contributions to the Gibbs energy (blue). In this ﬁgure, light colors have been used to illustrate the sign of
the main contribution to the overall energetics. In this ﬁgure, the magnitudes are arbitrary and use only for
illustration purposes

groups contributes favorably to the binding entropy [20]. On the
other hand, structuring, including folding of disordered protein
regions, contributes unfavorably to the binding entropy as it
reduces the conformational degrees of freedom.
The binding of ligands to intrinsically disordered proteins or to
intrinsically disordered protein domains is coupled to the folding of
those regions, and consequently, the binding thermodynamics
reﬂects this phenomenon. Folding is coupled to a favorable enthal-
pic component due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and van
der Waals interactions within the previously disordered domain and
an unfavorable entropic component arising from the decrease in
conformational degrees of freedom associated with the refolding or
structuring process.
As an example of ligand binding to a protein containing disor-
dered domains, we selected the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein
gp120 for the experiments presented in this protocol. gp120 med-
iates the ﬁrst step in HIV infection [21, 22]. Prior to binding,
gp120 contains signiﬁcant regions which are intrinsically disor-
dered and become structured upon binding to the human CD4
receptor or to certain antibodies [23–25]. The conformational
structuring coupled to binding is reﬂected in the binding thermo-
dynamics measured by ITC. In the experiments presented here, the
binding of gp120 to molecules that bind to disordered regions and
trigger structuring (CD4 or MAb 17b) and to molecules that bind
to structured regions and do not induce conformational structur-
ing (MAb b12) is discussed.

A single ITC experiment (Fig. 2) performed at one tempera-

enthalpy, ΔH; and the entropy change, ΔS [2, 26]. Additionally,
ITC also determines the stoichiometry of the reaction.

ITC Results
for gp120
b12 is an antibody that binds to the CD4 binding region of gp120
and does not induce a conformational structuring [27]. The bind-
ing of b12 to gp120 is shown in the left panel of Fig. 3. The
thermodynamic signatures for the respective binding reactions are
shown below each ITC experiment. The binding is characterized by
a ΔG of ¼ 10.4 kcal/mol and favorable binding enthalpy
(ΔH ¼ 7.8 kcal/mol) and entropy (TΔS ¼ 2.6 kcal/mol).
The magnitude of these values is characteristic of protein/protein
interactions in which the binding energetics is primarily deﬁned by
the interactions occurring at the interacting surfaces, for example,

The situation is completely different when binding is coupled
to folding. In this case, in addition to the resulting interface inter-
actions, the energetics of structuring is also included in the
measured thermodynamics. This is the case when the soluble
form of the human cell surface receptor CD4 (sCD4) or the anti-
body 17b binds to gp120 [24, 25, 33]. The ITC experiments for
sCD4 and MAb 17b binding to gp120 are shown in the center and
right panels of Fig. 3, respectively. The thermodynamic signatures
are shown below the ITC experiments. The binding thermodynam-
ics of both sCD4 and 17b are characterized by similar ΔG values

Fig. 3 Calorimetric titrations of gp120 with MAb b12 (left panel), sCD4 (middle panel), and MAb 17b (right
panel). The thermodynamic signatures for the respective binding reactions are shown below each ITC
experiment. Binding of sCD4 and 17b to gp120 is associated with the unusually large favorable enthalpy
and unfavorable entropy changes observed when binding is coupled to large conformational structuring. The
thermodynamic signature is completely different for MAb b12 which binds to gp120 without inducing any
conformational structuring. In the titration with sCD4, 2.0 μM gp120 in the calorimetric cell was titrated with
26.7 μM sCD4. In the experiments with the two antibodies, the cell was ﬁlled with gp120 at a concentration of
2.5 μM, and injections were made of either MAb 17b or b12 at 15.0 and 19.2 μM, respectively. Note that the
concentrations of antigen binding sites are used for the antibodies b12 and 17b (twice the antibody
concentration)

(11.7 and 11.5 kcal/mol) but very large favorable binding
enthalpies (39.0 and 28.7 kcal/mol) and, most importantly,
extremely large unfavorable entropy contributions (27.3 and
17.2 kcal/mol). The much larger favorable enthalpies arise from
the formation of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interaction
upon refolding, while the extremely large unfavorable entropies
indicate that the entropy loss associated with the reduced number
of degrees of freedom predominates over any entropy gains due to
desolvation (Fig. 1). It must be noted that folding of disordered
domains is not only observed when two proteins bind. Small mole-
cules are also able to trigger the structuring of disordered domains
as also demonstrated for gp120 [11, 13, 14, 34].
1.4
Determination
of the Change in Heat
Capacity Associated
with Binding
ITC experiments performed at different temperatures allow the
determination of the change in heat capacity, ΔCp, associated with
binding. ΔCp is deﬁned as the temperature derivative of the
enthalpy at constant pressure according to Eq. 4:
ΔCp ¼
∂ΔH
∂T


p
ð4Þ
and is simply obtained from a plot of the enthalpy change as a
function of temperature. The change in heat capacity depends
mainly on how much of the solvent-exposed surface area becomes
buried upon binding [18, 35, 36]. Burial of hydrophobic residues
with the concomitant release of hydration water is associated with a
decrease in heat capacity, and the ΔCp associated with the binding
event is consequently negative. Figure 4 shows plots of the enthalpy
as a function of temperature for the binding of MAb b12, sCD4,
and MAb17b to gp120. The resulting values are 0.4, 1.3, and
1.8 kcal/(K  mol). As expected, the heat capacity changes for
the systems coupled to structuring (CD4 and 17b) are about three-
to fourfold larger as folding causes the burial of a signiﬁcantly larger
number of hydrophobic groups.
1.5
Experimental
Design
In order to accurately determine not only the enthalpy change (and
stoichiometry) but also the afﬁnity of binding, it is necessary to
choose the concentrations of the reactants correctly. The best guide
is to estimate a range for the expected afﬁnity and select a concen-
tration of the protein in the cell, [M]T, such that the parameter
c ¼ Ka  [M]T ¼ [M]T/Kd is between 1 and 1000 depending on
the actual binding afﬁnity [5]. As a general rule, the concentration
of the ligand [L]T in the syringe should typically be 10- to 20-fold
higher than [M]T. If the concentration [M]T is lower than Kd, the
c-value will be too low (c < 1), and the degree of binding will be
small throughout the titration without reaching complete satura-
tion. If the c-value is too high (c > 1000), all of the ligand is
consumed in each injection until the protein in the cell is saturated
454

and the equilibrium is not reﬂected in any gradual change of the
heats during the course of the experiment. This happens if the
binding is very tight and the reactant concentrations are several
orders of magnitude higher than the Kd for the reaction. The best
ITC experiments are obtained for c-values of 10–100. See also refs.
[3, 37] for a discussion and illustration of the effects of the c-value
on the shape of the titration curves.

Fig. 4 Plots of the enthalpy change as a function of temperature for the gp120
binding of sCD4 and the monoclonal antibodies 17b and b12. The enthalpy
values were determined in ITC experiments performed at 15, 25, and 37 C.
Each slope represents the heat capacity change upon binding, ΔCp. ΔCp is
negative in the three cases, which mainly reﬂects the release of ordered
hydration water coupled to the association process. Binding of MAb b12 is
associated with the smallest ΔCp because the dehydration is associated
primarily with the binding interface. The conformational structuring associated
with 17b and, especially, sCD4 binding involves a large number of residues that
become buried away from the aqueous phase which is reﬂected in the much
larger negative values for ΔCp

Isothermal
Titration Calorimeter
The titration calorimeter used in the experiments described below
is a VP-ITC from MicroCal/Malvern Instruments (Northampton,
MA, USA). A syringe also serving as a stirrer delivers the ligand to
the cell with preset intervals. The VP-ITC has a cell for the sample
and a matching reference cell both kept at constant temperature. A
feedback power supplied to the sample cell keeps the temperature
difference between the two cells close to zero. The feedback loop is
active from the beginning of the experiment in response to a
constant opposing reference power which slightly offsets the tem-
perature of the reference cell. As a result, any heat released or
absorbed during an injection is compensated by the power supplied
to the sample cell. The feedback power is directly proportional to
the thermal power, dQ/dt, and serves as the recorded output
signal. A VP-ITC has a cell volume of ~1.4 mL, but instruments
having smaller volumes down to 200 μL are available from the same
or other manufacturers. It is important to point out that although
the low-volume instruments currently on the market have higher
sensitivity than the VP-ITC, the sensitivity per unit volume is lower.
In order to achieve the same high-quality data using the
low-volume instruments, it is therefore necessary to increase the
concentrations of the reactants two- to threefold as mentioned in
the notes to the following section.
2.3
Experimental
Systems
The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120, contains intrinsically
disordered domains and was selected as the target protein in the
ITC experiments. The soluble form of the human cell surface
receptor, sCD4, was chosen as one of the ligands as it induces a
large-scale conformational structuring in gp120 upon binding
[24, 25]. The two monoclonal antibodies 17b and b12 bind to
gp120 with and without inducing any conformational structuring,
respectively [33], and were also selected for the experiments.
1. gp120 used for the studies presented here is of the HIV-1
subtype B isolate YU2. YU2 gp120 has 470 residues and is
heavily glycosylated with a molecular weight of 100–120 kDa
depending on the degree of glycosylation. The molecular
456
Arne Scho¨ n and Ernesto Freire

weight in the absence of glycans is 53.4 kDa, which is the value
used in the conversion of the concentration from gram to mole
basis. YU2 gp120 was expressed in 293F cells and puriﬁed as
previously described [38]. The puriﬁed gp120 was stored as
20–40 μM aliquots in PBS at 80 C.
2. sCD4 is the soluble form of the human CD4 receptor. The
construct of sCD4 used here is the four-domain sCD4
(MW 45.2 kDa) and was puriﬁed as described elsewhere
[39]. sCD4 was stored frozen as aliquots of 50–100 μM in
PBS at 80 C. Identical results will be obtained with the
two-domain construct of sCD4 (MW 20.3 kDa).
3. MAb 17b is a monoclonal antibody which binds to a site that
overlaps the coreceptor binding site in gp120 [23]. The 17b
antibody (MW 150 kDa) has two equivalent antigen binding
sites for gp120. MAb 17b was obtained from Strategic BioSo-
lutions (Newark, DE, USA).
4. MAb b12 (MW 150 kDa) is a monoclonal antibody with two
equivalent sites which bind to an epitope in gp120 that overlap
the binding site for CD4 [27]. MAb was kindly provided by
J. Sodroski (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical
School, Boston, MA, USA).

Methods
3.1
Sample
Preparation
All reagents must be dialyzed against the exact same buffer, and the
dialysate is preferably used for further dilutions of the reagents. The
use of matching buffers will minimize the heat of dilution of the
buffer components.
1. gp120: Dialyze 1 mL of gp120 at 5 μM or higher overnight
using a dialysis cassette at 4 C against two buffer changes of
1 L PBS, pH 7.4, with stirring. Determine the concentration of
gp120 after dialysis from the absorbance at 280 nm using an
extinction coefﬁcient of 79,000/M/cm. The concentration
will be lower after dialysis but should not have dropped below
2 μM. Too diluted sample solution must be concentrated using
a centrifugal ﬁlter.
2. sCD4: Dialyze 1 mL of sCD4 at a concentration of 40–50 μM
against two buffer changes of 1 L PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 C with
stirring. The concentration after the dialysis should not be
lower than 30 μM. Too diluted protein solution must be con-
centrated using a centrifugal ﬁlter. At the end of the dialysis,
dilute an aliquot of the sample ﬁvefold and measure the con-
centration at 280 nm using an extinction coefﬁcient of
59,845/M/cm. For the measurements, prepare sCD4, and
dilute if necessary, at a concentration of 25–30 μM.
ITC on Disordered Proteins
457

3. MAbs 17b and b12: Dialyze 1 mL of each antibody at a
concentration of 20–25 μM against two buffer changes of 1 L
PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 C with stirring. At the end of the dialysis,
dilute aliquots of the proteins ﬁvefold and measure the concen-
tration at 280 nm. The extinction coefﬁcients for MAbs 17b
and b12 are 144,830 (see Note 1) and 218,420/M/cm,
respectively. The concentration after the dialysis should not
be lower than 15 μM. Too diluted antibody solutions must
be concentrated using a centrifugal ﬁlter. Note that the actual
concentration of binding sites will be twice the antibody
concentration.
3.2
Experimental
Procedure
Results from ITC experiments are normally reported at 25 C, but
as a complete thermodynamic characterization of the interactions
requires the determination of the change in heat capacity of bind-
ing, measurements are also performed at other temperatures, here
at 15 and 35 C. The following procedure applies directly to a
VP-ITC (MicroCal/Malvern Instruments, Northampton, MA,
USA) (see Note 2).
1. Make sure the calorimetric cell is clean. For cleaning, ﬁll the cell
with 0.5 M NaOH for 5–10 min followed by thorough rinsing
with water.
2. Set the temperature of the instrument (15, 25, or 35 C) (see
Note 3).
3. Prepare 2.2 mL of 2 μM gp120 by dilution of the dialyzed
stock solution with identically prepared PBS. Measure the exact
concentration from the absorbance reading of the undiluted
solution at 280 nm in triplicate measurements.
4. Prepare 500 μL of sCD4 at 30 μM and 500 μL of either of the
two antibodies at 15 μM (30 μM binding sites) in PBS. Prepare
the ligand solutions in test tubes having adequate diameter to
allow efﬁcient mixing (e.g., 12 mm). Prior to ﬁlling the syringe,
transfer the solutions to 6  50 mm test tubes.
5. Cover the solutions with perforated Para ﬁlm, and place under
vacuum using a water aspirator or vacuum pump for 15 min to
prevent the formation of gas bubbles during the calorimetric
experiment. For the experiment at 15 C, place the degassed
gp120 solution on ice for a couple of minutes prior to ﬁlling
the syringe.
6. Fill the reference cell of the calorimeter with water or buffer.
Rinse the sample cell with buffer. Then, slowly inject gp120
solution into the sample cell without introducing air bubbles.
Any air bubbles can easily be removed while ﬁlling the cell by
forcefully injecting the last 100–200 μL. Remove any excess
sample from the top of the cell. Save the remaining solution for
concentration determination.

7. Fill the 250 μL injection syringe with the ligand solution. The
injector syringe should be ﬁlled without introducing air bub-
bles, although a minor gap just below the plunger can be
difﬁcult to avoid. Rinse the syringe tip with water, and remove
any excess water with a paper tissue without touching the exit
pore of the tip. Keep the remainder of the ligand solution for
concentration determination (see Note 4).
8. Insert the injection syringe into the calorimetric cell and, if the
instrument was equilibrated at a lower temperature, change the
thermostat setting to the experimental temperature.
9. Using the software for the ITC, set the instrumental run para-
meters: the number of injections (28), temperature (15, 25, or
35 C), reference power (10 μcal/s), initial delay (60 s), stirring
speed (350 rpm), ﬁle name (∗.itc), feedback mode (high),
injection volume (2 μL for the ﬁrst injection and 10 μL for
the remaining 27 injections), spacing between injections
(300 s), and ﬁlter (3 s) (see Notes 5–7). The concentrations
of the solutions in the cell and syringe can be entered before or
after the experiment (during the analysis).
10. Start the experiment by clicking Start in the ITC software, and
allow the instrument to equilibrate while stirring. Initiate the
injections from the software when a stable baseline has been
established.
11. After the experiment has been completed, clean the syringe and
calorimeter cell thoroughly. For cleaning of the syringe, thor-
ough rinsing with water followed by drying using an aspirator
is normally adequate. A quick rinse with ethanol, methanol, or
acetone will speed up the time for drying. If more thorough
cleaning is required, leave the syringe with 2% Contrad, Hell-
manex, or similar laboratory detergent solution for 60 min
prior to rinsing with large amounts of water.
3.3
Analysis
of the Data
The upper panel of Fig. 2 shows the output signal, dQ/dt, as a
function of time for a typical titration experiment. The heat asso-
ciated with each injection corresponds to the area obtained by
integration of each of the progressively decreasing peaks until satu-
ration is achieved. The areas for the small peaks of similar size at the
end of the experiment correspond to the heat associated with
dilution and a small mechanical effect and need to be subtracted
prior to the analysis of the data. The heat, Qi, corresponding to the
area under each peak is given by Eq. 5:
Q i ¼ V cell  ΔH  Δ L
½ b,i
ð5Þ
where Vcell is the volume of the calorimetric cell, and Δ[L]b,i is the
increase in the concentration of bound ligand after the ith injec-
tion. For a single-site binding model, Eq. 5 can be written as:

ð6Þ
where [L]i and [L]i1 are the concentrations of free ligand upon
injection i and i  1. Because only the total and not the free ligand
concentrations are known, Eq. 6 must be rewritten in terms of total
concentrations. For further details regarding the solution to this
and more complex equations used in the analysis of the data, see, for
example, refs. [1, 5].
The lower panel of Fig. 1 shows the integrated heat as a
function of the molar concentration ratio together with the result
from nonlinear regression of the data. The software provided by the
manufacturer of the ITC instrument allows both integration of the
areas and nonlinear regression of the data.
3.4
Estimation
of the Degree
of Conformational
Structuring
Since in many situations, especially those involving monoclonal
antibodies and disordered proteins, high-resolution crystallo-
graphic or NMR structures are not available, a structure-based
analysis is not possible. This is especially true for the protein that
contains disordered domains prior to binding. Nevertheless, it has
been possible for us to establish empirical correlations between
experimentally determined ΔCp values for the folding of globular
proteins and the number of residues, Nres, that undergo folding
[40]:
ΔCp ¼ 0:014  N res
kcal
K  mol
ð7Þ
Application of Eq. 7 to the experimental data indicates that for
17b (ΔCp ¼ 1.3 kcal/(K  mol)) and sCD4 (ΔCp ¼ 1.8 kcal/
(K  mol)), the equivalent of 93–129 residues become structured.
If we assume that the ΔCp for b12 is representative for the binding
interface of a monoclonal antibody, then the ΔCp values expected
for folding only for 17b and sCD4 would be 0.9 and 1.4 kcal/
(K  mol), respectively, corresponding to 64 and 100 folding
residues, respectively.

Notes
1. The extinction coefﬁcient for MAb 17b of 144,830/M/cm
was experimentally determined in our laboratory and differs
signiﬁcantly from the value calculated from the sequence
(206,130/M/cm).
2. For the low-volume instrument ITC200 or similar, use two- or
threefold higher concentrations of the reactants.
3. For an experimental temperature below 25 C, equilibration of
the instrument to a temperature one degree below the experi-
mental temperature is usually recommended as this prevents
460
Arne Scho¨ n and Ernesto Freire

overheating while the sample cell is ﬁlled with the sample
solution.
4. Automated ﬁlling of the injector syringe is an option for several
newer ITC systems.
5. The stirring speed can be much higher or lower depending on
the ITC system and is recommended by the manufacturer. We
typically use 300–350 rpm.
6. High feedback gives the fastest response time and the largest
signal-to-noise ratio and is consequently the preferred choice
for most ITC experiments. Low feedback is chosen when the
association process is so slow that fast feedback will increase the
noise only.
7. The spacing between the injections must be sufﬁcient to allow
the signal to return to its baseline.

Analysis of Multivalent IDP Interactions: Stoichiometry,
Afﬁnity, and Local Concentration Effect Measurements
Samuel Sparks, Ryo Hayama, Michael P. Rout, and David Cowburn
Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titration and isothermal titration calorimetry can be combined to
provide an assessment of how multivalent intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) interactions can involve
enthalpy–entropy balance. Here, we describe the underlying technical details and additional methods, such
as dynamic light scattering analysis, needed to assess these reactions. We apply this to a central interaction
involving the disordered regions of phe–gly nucleoporins (FG-Nups) that contain multiple phenylalani-
ne–glycine repeats which are of particular interest, as their interactions with nuclear transport factors
(NTRs) underlie the paradoxically rapid yet also highly selective transport of macromolecules mediated
by the nuclear pore complex (NPC). These analyses revealed that a combination of low per-FG motif
afﬁnity and the enthalpy–entropy balance prevents high-avidity interaction between FG-Nups and NTRs
while the large number of FG motifs promotes frequent FG–NTR contacts, resulting in enhanced
selectivity.

Introduction
Many cellular processes involve complex, multivalent interactions
rather than apparently single “lock-and-key” recognition events
[1–9]. It is widely recognized that multivalency (i.e., the presence
of multiple interaction motifs on a ligand, possibly complemented
by multiple interaction sites on a target) can lead to substantial
increases in afﬁnity via “avidity” in antibody recognition [10],
signal transduction, and formation of biomolecular condensates
[11–12]. Many such interactions form stable, long-lived com-
plexes. In contrast, some intrinsically disordered systems possess
multivalent interactions yet maintain rapid exchange [13]. At one
extreme of the spectrum of fuzzy, dynamic interactions are those of
the lining of the inner portion of the nuclear pore complex (NPC)
where

structure [14] and provide a barrier to cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic
exchange of materials other than that facilitated by speciﬁc nuclear
transport receptors (NTRs). The FG-Nups have regular repeat
sequence motifs [15] directly implying multivalent interactions,
so an obvious question is how avidity is avoided in order to provide
fast transit times in the few milliseconds for large cargoes and their
NTRs [16]. A general answer involving the modest afﬁnity between
FG-Nups and NTRs balanced by the entropic cost of restriction on
the intrinsic disorder of the chains has been suggested [17]. This
involves a modest afﬁnity between FG-Nups and NTRs, which is
offset by the entropic cost of restriction on the intrinsic disorder of
the chains, such that optimally the energies of binding and barrier
are balanced and a macromolecule neither accumulates at nor is
excluded from the NPC but passes rapidly and speciﬁcally. Conﬁr-
mation requires assessment of the thermodynamic properties of
FG-Nup/NTR complexes. In this chapter, we describe the techni-
cal details of how the balance of multivalent afﬁnities of interactions
from a repeated motif and the entropic disorder of connecting
linkers can be done, following a shorter description of results,
previously published [18].
To address this, several complex issues needed to be resolved.
1. The most direct assessment of thermodynamic properties of an
interaction is the measurement of reaction enthalpy by isother-
mal titration calorimetry (ITC). However, care needs to be
taken as the relatively weak (~millimolar) afﬁnities of individual
sites are recognized as being at the limit of ITC sensitivity [19],
compromising the precision of measurement. Thus, studying
low-afﬁnity interactions requires substantial amounts of mate-
rial (see Note 1). Other, less direct, methods may be more
precise but lack accuracy (see Note 2).
2. The stoichiometry of the reactions of intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs) with targets is potentially complicated by the
large number of microstates associated with the intrinsic disor-
der of the linkers between the motifs (FGs for FG nucleopor-
ins), and the possible range of timescales associated with
interconversions among states, interacting and noninteracting
with the NTR. Can a simple association/dissociation be
ascribed to the interaction? Some independent validation of
molecular stoichiometry is of signiﬁcant beneﬁt (see Note 3).
3. The effect of multivalency needs to be probed by varying the
number and position of the interaction motifs with comparable
controls.
In the current protocol, we use FG-repeat proteins from yeast
NSP1 based on similar sequence lengths and negative controls by
substitution of the sequence “FSFG” with “SSSG” (Fig. 1). The
direct effect of multiple motifs is then addressed by variation of the
464

number of FSFG motifs with standard adjacent linker separations
(upper left, Fig. 1). The role of linker length is probed by increased
separation of the active FSFG motifs (upper right, Fig. 1). These
variants are then titrated with an NTR, the protein NFT2, which is
the principal carrier for Ran GDP required for NPC transport
function. ITC provides a direct measure of enthalpy (nΔH) related
directly to the equilibrium constant. Using nuclear magnetic reso-
nance (NMR) spectroscopy, we obtain complementary information
with greater precision related to the equilibrium constant. This is
complemented by investigation of the stoichiometry of the com-
plexes by dynamic light scattering (DLS).

3.1
Protein
Production
1. The various sequences of Fig. 1 discussed in 1 were constructed
as follows. FSFG6 (identiﬁed in Fig. 1) and SSSG6 [20] DNA
constructs codon-optimized for bacterial expression were
synthesized. Gene fragments from the synthesized plasmids
were ligated into either pET21b or pET24a vectors. The
FSFG12 plasmid was constructed by inserting a restriction-
digested FSFG6 plasmid fragment into a SpeI-digested FSFG6
plasmid. All the other FSFG variants were created by site-
directed mutagenesis from those two parent constructs for
FSFG6 and SSSG6. For NTF2, the genomic sequence from
S. cerevisiae was used. All the proteins in this study are tagged
with hexa-histidine on the C-termini, and their primary
sequences are listed in the supplemental material p.S-7 of
[18]. Samples are prepared and puriﬁed by standard methods
[21–22], including stable isotope labeling. For FG constructs,
[U-15N] labeling was used. For NTF2, [U-2H,15N] was used in
order to obtain sufﬁciently slow transverse relaxation for NMR
studies. Proteins were dissolved, dialyzed, and concentrated in
Buffer A to typical stock concentration ranges of 0.2–2 mM
(ligand FG constructs) and 6 mM for NTF2 for ITC NMR
and DLS. Prior to use, diluted or undiluted solutions were
centrifuged (~ 20,000  g, 10 min) and ultra-ﬁltered. The
protein concentrations of the ﬁltered samples are measured by
bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) [23] and diluted accordingly to
the desired concentration with ﬁltered and degassed dialysate.
3.2
NMR Titration
for Afﬁnity
Measurement
1. NMR chemical shift data is analyzed using NMRPipe [24] and
CCPNMR Analysis [25]. Titration experiments were per-
formed in Buffer A using a ﬁxed concentration of FG construct
15N-labeled (range 20–120 μM) sample and by preparation of
separate samples for each titration point, typically ten in total
(see Note 4). These conditions do not uniformly result in
saturation but are appropriate for this system (see Note 3). An
example of the spectrum is shown in Fig. 2.

2. Chemical shifts for both the FSFG residues and all the assigned
NTF2 residues were extracted from each titration point, and
the chemical shift perturbations (CSP) were calculated as CSP,

, where Δδ15N and Δδ1H
are 15N and 1H chemical shift changes with respect to the
free state. The CSPs were treated as a function of titrant con-
centration and ﬁt to a standard equation [26].

where Δδmax is the change in chemical shift at saturation, P0 is

tion. Global ﬁtting was performed with the above equation to
derive KDs. An example of the chemical shift changes of resi-
dues Fsfg, fSfg, fsFg, fsfG and their corresponding ﬁts is shown
in Fig. 2b.

1. For each ITC experiment, separate stock solutions of FSFGx
(identiﬁed in Fig. 1 upper) and NTF2 under go two rounds of

2. All the ITC experiments may be conducted on a MicroCal
Auto-iTC200 (see Notes 1 and 5). FSFG constructs are placed
in the cell, and NTF2 is titrated in from the syringe in all the
experiments. Each experiment consists of three runs: FSFGx
against NTF2, Buffer A against NTF2, and FSFGx against
Buffer A (Fig. 3a). To obtain the normalized heat for FSFGx-
NTF2 interaction, data from “Buffer against NTF2” and
“FSFGx against Buffer” runs are subtracted from the “FSFGx
against NTF2” run (Fig. 3b). The titration protocol involves
either 19 (19  2 μL), 16 (10  2 μL followed by 6  3 μL), or
15 (15  2.5 μL) titration points following a 0.4 μL ﬁrst
injection, which is removed from the analysis. The choice of
injection schemes does not affect the gross result, though
injections with larger volumes generally improve signal-to-
noise ratio toward the end of the titration [19]. Typical cell
concentration of FSFGx are in the range 0.3–2.11 mM, while
the syringe titrant NTF2 is 3.8–6.2 mM. These values are

4. The n value is rounded to integer one (FSFG1-FSFG6) or two
for (FSGS12) (see Subheading 3.3). For the binding reactions
with very low afﬁnity and low enthalpy (i.e., FSFG1–FSFG3, |
nΔH| < 5 kcal/M), n and ΔH could not be determined
independently by ITC, though their product (n∗ΔH) was
observable as previously reported for other low-afﬁnity systems
[19, 27]. KDs could be reliably extracted from those reactions
as evidenced by their agreement with NMR measurements,
conﬁrming the accuracy of the ITC experiment and its ﬁtting
procedure. However, since we cannot reliably determine n and
ΔH independently for FSFG1-FSFG3, only KDs and n∗ΔHs
(total enthalpy of the entire molecule) are reported for those
constructs (Table S1 in ref. [18]), and n values are derived
separately using DLS for others. Of course, in the case of
more complex reactions than nL + R ¼ (nLR), there will be
complexity of interpretation common to such issues [28].
5. Enthalpy–entropy compensation curve are constructed by plot-
ting TΔS against ΔH for constructs with increasing valency.
3.4
Determination
of Stoichiometry
1. The formed complexes are characterized by dynamic light scat-
tering (DLS). Experiments can ve run in a 384-well plate
format with independent samples in triplicate. For each sample,
ten acquisitions of 5 s are acquired on triplicate samples (see
Note 6).
2. The protein complexes formed for ITC or NMR titrations
are directly used.
3. The resulting intensity-weighted regularized autocorrelation
data, a decay curve resulting from Brownian motion of the
complexes, is averaged over the triplicate data set, and the
average radius of hydration calculated (Fig. 4).
4. Apparent radii of hydration are interpreted as consistent with
1:1 complexes for all ~12 kDa FG mimics and 1:2 for FSFG12/
NTF2; that is, two NTF2 dimers interact with one FSFG12.
3.5
Estimation
of Local Concentration
Effect
1. The local concentration effect can be measured by observation
of the change in Kd with variation of the linker length between
motifs. In the FG-Nup application, this was done by changing
the distance between two FSFG motifs in the natural sequence
ITC and NMR for IDP Ligand Interactions
469

with SSSG substitutions (Fig. 1, upper right). This results in
additional separation equivalent to the insertion of 1, 2, 3, and
4 linked segments separating FSFG motifs.
2. To estimate and to illustrate the change in local motif concen-
tration as a function of FSFG motif–motif distance, we calcu-
late [FSFG]local for our designed FSFG2 constructs (Fig. 1,
upper right) based on polymer theory. Here, we deﬁne the
[FSFG]local as the concentration of FSFG motifs within a prob-
ing volume deﬁned by the spacer length, L. We assumed that
the spacer between the two FSFG motifs behaves as a random
coil polymer consistent with experimental [21] and simulation
[29] results. The calculated local concentration is based on a
three-dimensional random ﬂight model which is equivalent to
an ideal chain undergoing random walks (rather than self-
avoiding random walks) [30].

to those in the presence of increasing NTF2 concentrations. For the sample at 1:1 molar ratio, the intensity plot
is derived from a mixture of free and 1:1 FSFG6:NTF2 molecular stoichiometry. No further increase in the peak
position is observed at higher NTF2 concentrations. (c) Intensity-weighted DLS comparing the free FSFG12
sample to those in the presence of increasing NTF2 concentrations. The positions of the peaks in the presence
of NTF2 are consistent with a shift from ~1:1 to ~ 2:1 NTF2:FSFG12 molecular stoichiometry at higher NTF2
concentrations. (d) Table reporting the radius of hydration, Rh, and the percentage by mass of the peak. In the
case of FSFG12, two separate peaks could be resolved at 1:5 molar ratio with NTF2, where the smaller of the
two likely represents the free protein component. Each measurement represents data averaged from
independent samples in triplicate

where NA is Avogadro’s number and <r2> the square distance
(dm2) between the ends of the spacer given by a2n where a is
the intersegment distance in A˚ and n the number of segments.
Using the distance distribution between adjacent FSFG motifs
obtained from our previous simulation [29] as L ¼ <r2> 1/
2  <r> ¼ 33.0 A˚ for adjacent FSFG repeats (n ¼ 15), we
calculate a to be 8.5 A˚ (see Note 7). For each construct in the
bivalent, differentially spaced, FSFG2 series, we calculate
<r2>1/2 by multiplying a as above and calculating the range
of [FSFG]local concentrations as above.
3. The [FSFG]local calculated above is simply the concentration of
FSFG motifs that are within the explorable space of the target
protein. The local concentration effect inﬂuences the overall
binding reaction by either promoting formation of divalently
interacting species (two interaction patches on NTF2 bound by
two FSFG motifs on a molecule of dual-site NTR) or inducing
a rebinding effect [31]. Simulation of this process [29] sug-
gests the latter option.
4. Based on the calculations for the variant with dual motifs
above, we can calculate [FSFG]local for the FSFG3–FSFG12
variants following the model proposed by Gargano et al.
[32]. For the case here, we are dealing with a linear polymer
and increased local concentration predominantly from vicinal
motifs. As intuitively expected, the local concentration effect
then increases modestly as the number of motifs increases.
Other cases may differ with changes in interaction energy,
n and a. However, the plateauing observed as a function of
motif number (Fig. 5) is contrary to a simple local concentra-
tion prediction suggesting that a more detailed theory includ-
ing at least the additions of chain self-avoidance and of
excluded volume effect [30] is needed to account quantita-
tively for experiment.
3.6
Combining
Results from
the Different Analyses
As shown in Fig. 5a, there is excellent agreement between dissocia-
tion constants measured by the two different methods, strongly
supporting the hypothesis that the time-averaged microstates for
this interaction, central to the nuclear pore complex’s function, are
represented by simple chemical equilibria. The combination of
methods has two signiﬁcant features: (1) the agreement provides
a clear underpinning for thermodynamic analysis from ITC to the
NMR data that are generally more precise and (2) the ITC provides
a direct analysis of enthalpy and entropy as in Fig. 5b not readily
available by other methods.

Notes
1. ITC instruments may have cells of different sizes. Larger cells
will provide larger heat changes for more precise measure-
ments, but at the cost of signiﬁcant amounts of material
required. In any broad survey study, the number of constructs
to test may be large: For example, ref. 18 involved 14 different
FG constructs, with each titration requiring two controls as
well as repetitions (n ¼ 3). Thus, the balance between produc-
tion scale of materials and precision of measurement will
require careful examination. The system used a MicroCal
Auto-iTC200 with 200 μL of titrand in the cell. Note also
that automated systems operating with sample trays will use
signiﬁcantly more material (~400 μL in our case) because of
plumbing dead volumes.
2. When using ITC, the resulting heat is directly measuring the
heat of reaction so that the thermodynamic quantity associated
with the equilibrium is obtained without any other consider-
ation. For other methods, there is typically an assumption that
the measurable (e.g., chemical shift perturbation, or relaxation
property for NMR, intensities of absorption or ﬂuorescence for
optical methods) is a direct measure of concentrations of
reagents and products. This may be a limited approximation
for several reasons. (1) The theoretical underpinning of the
measurable/concentration dependence may be incorrect, for

[33]. (2) The equilibrium may contain microstates, and the
measurable detects a subset, not reﬂective of the overall reac-
tion. (3) The use of derivative tags (e.g., for ﬂuorescence) may
directly affect the equilibrium by providing additional interac-
tions not present in the native case (e.g. [34]).
3. The conventional analysis of equilibria would rely on observa-
tion of saturation at the stoichiometric equivalence point.
However, millimolar range afﬁnities frequently preclude direct
observation of saturation because of limitations of solubility.
Contemporary statistical ﬁtting methods [35] will provide rea-
sonable estimates of stoichiometry (and its signiﬁcance level)
from curvature of titrations without observation of saturation.
In the case of FG-Nup/NTRs interaction and similarly non-
standard cases, the possibility of separate microstates [36] leads
to the need for an independent estimate of stoichiometry from
DLS (Subheading 3.3).
4. In general, a signiﬁcant quantity of surveying conditions may
be needed to establish a range of conditions for observing
NMR spectral changes during titration (see Note 2). Consid-
erations will include sufﬁciently acidic pH such that solvent

(typically,

ties [33], typically R2.
5. It is good practice to use the manufacturer’s calibration proce-
dure before extensive work to ensure that the operator can
obtain reproducible results. Of many issues, variations of
room temperature, dust contamination of solutions, and gas
bubbles in the titrant syringe are common. The titration pro-
tocol for these low c value systems is not as critical as those for
high-afﬁnity systems. In brief, the c value is the ratio of the
titrand (receptor) concentration to the dissociation constant.
Turnbull et al. [19] set out the conditions for using low values
of c as “(1) a sufﬁcient portion of the binding isotherm is used
for analysis, (2) the binding stoichiometry is known, (3) the
concentrations of both ligand and receptor” conditions met in
the study here.
6. To minimize contaminants, samples for DLS should be centri-
fuged immediately before pipetting into the sample tray. It is
recommended that the sample tray be centrifuged brieﬂy prior
to the run to remove interference from air bubbles.
7. We chose to use a constant value of a for simplicity, although
the value for FSFG-(linker)-FSFG is obviously slightly shorter
than the equivalent one-half of FSFG-(linker)-SSSG-(linker)-
FSFG.

NMR Lineshape Analysis of Intrinsically Disordered Protein
Interactions
Christopher A. Waudby and John Christodoulou
Abstract
Interactions of intrinsically disordered proteins are central to their cellular functions, and solution-state
NMR spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for characterizing both structural and mechanistic aspects of
such interactions. Here we focus on the analysis of IDP interactions using NMR titration measurements.
Changes in resonance lineshapes in two-dimensional NMR spectra upon titration with a ligand contain rich
information on structural changes in the protein and the thermodynamics and kinetics of the interaction, as
well as on the microscopic association mechanism. Here we present protocols for the optimal design of
titration experiments, data acquisition, and data analysis by two-dimensional lineshape ﬁtting using the
TITAN software package.

Introduction
Protein interactions are central to their function, whether that be
enzymatic, structural, or regulatory. Regulatory proteins or protein
domains are particularly prevalent in higher-order organisms, and
order-disorder transitions can play important roles in interactions
of these proteins [1]. Indeed, intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs) or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)—i.e., polypeptide
sequences lacking any stable tertiary structure—have been labelled
“interaction specialists” due to their ability to recognize many
factors and integrate multiple signals with tuneable afﬁnity and
speciﬁcity [1, 2]. IDRs are abundant within signalling proteins
and oncogenes [3], as well as within viral proteomes [4–6], while
other IDPs and IDRs are implicated in a number of severe neuro-
degenerative disorders due to their propensity to misfold and
aggregate because of their lack of stable structure [7, 8].
The dynamic nature of IDPs and IDRs poses a challenge to
most structural biology techniques, but this is an area in which

solution-state NMR spectroscopy excels. From the identiﬁcation of
disordered regions and the characterization of their residual sec-
ondary and tertiary structure, both in vitro and within living cells
[9–12], the study of posttranslational modiﬁcations [13, 14], the
structural and dynamical characterization of interactions [6, 15–
19], to the analysis of phase separation and aggregation [20, 21],
NMR spectroscopy has played a key role in the ﬁeld.
This chapter will focus on the application of NMR lineshape
analysis, to characterize interactions of IDPs and IDRs with small
molecules or other macromolecules. However, the protocol we
provide is equally applicable to interactions of folded protein
domains and indeed to interactions of folded domains with IDPs
and IDRs.
NMR spectra are sensitive to chemical exchange (i.e., dynamic
molecular equilibria) across a wide range of timescales. Chemical
exchange between two states can be characterized by the exchange
rate, kex, which is the sum of the forward and backward reaction
rates. For a simple two-state binding reaction in which a protein, P,
is observed to form a complex, PL, in the presence of ligand, L:

The appearance of an NMR resonance depends on the frequency
difference between free and bound states, Δω, relative to the
exchange rate (Fig. 1). If exchange is fast (kex  Δω), then a single
resonance will be observed with a population-weighted average
chemical shift, while if exchange is slow (kex  Δω), then two
signals will be observed at the chemical shifts of the free and
bound states, weighted according to the bound population. If the
exchange rate is comparable to the frequency difference, a condi-
tion termed “intermediate exchange,” then extensive line broaden-
ing is observed. As different residues will have different chemical
shift differences between their free and bound states, depending on
changes in structure or chemical environment of the bound state, a
range of fast/intermediate/slow exchange regimes are likely to be
sampled across the polypeptide sequence. Note also that the free
ligand concentration can only increase as ligand is added, and
therefore according to Eq. 2, higher ligand concentrations will be
associated with more rapid chemical exchange.

Christopher A. Waudby and John Christodoulou

The dependence of the observed NMR spectrum on the kinet-
ics of the exchange process as well as the thermodynamics (the
bound population) and structure (chemical shift differences and
linewidths) is the essential reason why NMR spectroscopy provides
a powerful tool to characterize molecular equilibria and binding
reactions. The evolution of magnetization in an exchanging system
may also be manipulated with rf ﬁelds and pulses, which has given
rise to a range of methods such as exchange spectroscopy (EXSY)
[22–24], CPMG or R1ρ relaxation dispersion [25–29], and chemi-
cal/dark-state exchange saturation transfer (CEST and DEST)
[20, 30, 31], which may be used to characterize dynamic equilibria
even within single samples [32]. However, in systems where titra-
tions can be performed, i.e., where the concentration of one or
more components can be altered to modulate the equilibrium,
NMR titrations using standard 2D correlation experiments provide
a powerful approach to the analysis of exchange that is often simpler
and more intuitive to analyze than the methods described above.
In the extreme fast exchange limit, which is typically associated
with very weak interactions, NMR titration data can be analyzed in
terms of chemical shift perturbations alone, which provide a
straightforward report of the binding process [33, 34]. In general
however, analyses based on a naı¨ve assumption of fast exchange risk
the introduction of systematic errors [35]. A better alternative is the
use of NMR lineshape analysis (also referred to as “dynamic
NMR”) to ﬁt observed spectra to numerical solutions of the
Bloch-McConnell or Liouville-von Neumann equations that gov-
ern the evolution of magnetization vectors or density operators in
the presence of chemical exchange [36, 37].

2D Lineshape Analysis of IDP Interactions
479

NMR lineshape analysis was originally developed and applied to
one-dimensional NMR spectra [37], but the analysis of proteins
and other macromolecules, which contain on the order of 103 1H
resonances, clearly requires multidimensional spectroscopy to
resolve individual spin systems. Early approaches to lineshape anal-
ysis of two-dimensional spectra, which we term “pseudo-two-
dimensional lineshape analysis,” were based on the extraction or
integration of cross sections through resonances or across rectan-
gular regions, to which traditional one-dimensional lineshape anal-
ysis could be applied [38, 39]. However, not only is this approach
limited by the need to avoid overlapping resonances—a particularly
common problem in crowded spectra of IDPs—but additional
uncertainty is introduced by the need to normalize the area under
each cross peak, which may by highly broadened by chemical
exchange. Lastly, because the pseudo-two-dimensional approach
does not accurately consider the evolution of magnetization
through the full pulse sequence, we have also shown that this
approach can introduce systematic errors by neglecting differential
relaxation in the slow-intermediate exchange regime [40] and
phase distortions and cross peaks arising from chemical exchange
during mixing and chemical shift evolution periods [41].
To resolve these problems, we recently developed a true
two-dimensional lineshape analysis approach and introduced a soft-
ware package, TITAN, to carry out the ﬁtting procedure [40]. The
method is based on the use of a “virtual spectrometer” to propagate
an initial density operator through the entire experimental pulse
sequence [42], to generate a two-dimensional interferogram which
can be processed in an identical manner to the experimental data.
This approach eliminates the systematic errors described above;
obviates the requirement to normalize individual resonances or
spectra, provided that sample concentrations and acquisition para-
meters are fully speciﬁed; and can readily ﬁt overlapping resonances,
which is of particular value for IDPs. The analysis has since been
applied to a range of systems [43–46].
Here, we present a protocol for the acquisition and analysis of
NMR titration data to characterize an IDP interaction with a ligand
(which may be a small molecule or another macromolecule) using
two-dimensional lineshape analysis. We begin with a discussion of
the experimental setup and optimal titration protocols and then
present a step-by-step description of data analysis using the TITAN
software package. While we highlight some points of particular
relevance to IDPs, we note that the protocol is also applicable to
other macromolecular systems.

Materials
2.1
NMR
Spectrometer
NMR titration experiments may be acquired at any magnetic ﬁeld
strength. However, due to the limited chemical shift dispersion
associated with IDPs, it is recommended that NMR spectrometers
operating with a 1H Larmor frequency of 800 MHz (18.8 T) or
greater are used for titration measurements. NMR spectrometers
equipped with cryogenic probes will also provide greater experi-
mental sensitivity and allow titrations to be completed more rapidly.
Automation facilities, if available, may be used to acquire a com-
plete series of pre-prepared titration samples, albeit at the cost of
additional protein and ligand.
2.2
NMR Tubes
In our experience, regular 5 mm tubes are most convenient for
carrying out NMR titrations, requiring a sample volume of 550 μL.
The most crucial requirement in performing a titration is that the
sample volume is accurately controlled, and for this reason, we do
not recommend the use of Shigemi tubes as inserting and removing
the plunger results in uncontrollable sample loss. However, if
material is limited, then 400 μL may be used in a 5 mm Shigemi
tube without inserting the plunger. Alternatively, if a series of
independent samples is being prepared (e.g., due to the inability
to prepare a high-concentration stock of titrant), then the use of
3 mm tubes, which require a sample volume of 170 μL, may
provide a useful reduction in the total amount of sample required
(at the cost of increased acquisition times to compensate for the
reduction in experimental sensitivity).
2.3
NMR Samples
1. The protein to be observed should be prepared with uniform
15N labelling, according to standard expression protocols [47–
49]. Although resonance assignments are not strictly necessary
for the analysis of titration data, they greatly assist the interpre-
tation of the results, and therefore if assignments are not
already available, it is recommended to prepare a second sample
with 13C/15N labelling in order to carry out a backbone
assignment according to standard methods [50, 51].
2. Where possible, protein samples should be prepared in a buffer
with a strong buffering capacity to avoid pH changes during
addition of ligand. Be aware of the risk of protein degradation
or aggregation, particularly for IDPs: if necessary, EDTA or
protease inhibitors should be added, or the protein concentra-
tion reduced, in order to maintain sample integrity across the
titration series. As only chemical shift changes are required for
the analysis of titration data, rather than absolute values of
chemical shifts, we recommend that the chemical shift refer-
ence DSS [52] is not included during titration experiments as
in a number of cases it may interact with the protein being
2D Lineshape Analysis of IDP Interactions
481

observed, potentially causing systematic errors in the results
[53, 54]. Instead, referencing via the lock frequency has in our
experience been found to provide acceptable stability.
3. A high-concentration ligand stock (ca. 5–20 the maximum
ﬁnal ligand concentration, as discussed below) should be
prepared in an identical buffer to the protein to avoid changes
to solution conditions (especially pH) occurring during the
titration. Where the molecular weight of the ligand is sufﬁ-
ciently high, co-dialysis may be helpful, particularly if the IDP
contains pH-sensitive histidine residues. Optionally, the ligand
stock may be prepared in the presence of the 15N-labelled
protein, to avoid dilution during the titration, but this is not
essential as dilution can also be taken into account during the
TITAN analysis. If, for solubility reasons, the ligand is dissolved
in DMSO, d6-DMSO is preferred to avoid strong background
signals from the solvent, and a control experiment should be
performed to verify that DMSO, at the maximum concentra-
tion used during the titration, does not perturb the spectrum
of the protein being observed.

Software

2. TITAN (v. 1.6) software for two-dimensional lineshape analysis
is available from https://www.nmr-titan.com [40]. TITAN
requires OS X or Linux to run as a stand-alone application, or
it can be run in a scripted manner within MATLAB (version
R2016b is currently ofﬁcially supported).

Data Acquisition
3.1
Sample
Concentrations
1. Protein and ligand concentrations must be chosen with some
care to ensure accurate results can be obtained from the titra-
tion measurement. The protein concentration should not be
more than an order of magnitude higher than the Kd, and
optimal results are obtained when the protein concentration
is comparable to the Kd. The ﬁnal ligand concentration should
be sufﬁcient to fully saturate the binding: the greater of at least
three times the Kd or two equivalents relative to the protein
concentration. If even an approximate value of the Kd is
unknown (e.g., from measurements on a related or similar
system), an initial titration may be required to obtain an esti-
mate, to be followed up with a more detailed characterization
using optimized sample concentrations.
2. Approximately 8–12 titration points should be acquired (see
Note 1). The majority of ligand concentrations should be in
482
Christopher A. Waudby and John Christodoulou

the range of 0–1.5 equivalents of protein, unless the protein
concentration is much less than the Kd, in which case sufﬁ-
ciently high ligand concentrations should be used in order to
saturate the binding (up to ca. 5  Kd). It is often helpful for
ligand concentrations to be spaced nonlinearly, e.g., in qua-
dratic increments: 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.6, 0.85, 1.15, 1.5, and
1.9 equivalents.
3. Protein and ligand stock concentrations should be determined
as accurately as possible [56]. Centrifuge protein stocks at
ca. 16,000 rpm (20,000  g) for 30 min to remove precipitate
or aggregates prior to measurement of concentration. This is
most readily done via UV absorbance measurements (although
as IDPs often contain few aromatic residues, alternative meth-
ods may on occasion need to be employed [57, 58]). Ensure
that the stock concentration or dilution thereof has an absor-
bance that can be measured with high accuracy, i.e., in the
range 0.2–0.6 units. If the ligand stock concentration cannot
also be measured spectrophotometrically, ensure that a sufﬁ-
ciently large mass of sample (at least 10 mg) is weighed to avoid
errors from the limited precision of the analytical balance.
Volumetric glassware or calibrated pipettes should be used for
liquid handling; graduated cylinders and plasticware such as
serological pipettes and falcon tubes do not provide sufﬁcient
accuracy.
4. Protein concentrations of at least 10 μM are required (on mo-
dern spectrometers equipped with cryogenic probes), although
such low concentrations may necessitate acquisition times of
several hours for each spectrum. Higher protein concentra-
tions, around 50–100 μM, will generally allow sufﬁciently
high signal-to-noise ratios to be obtained in less than an hour.
5. A ligand stock should be prepared with a concentration
ca. 5–20 that of the ﬁnal desired concentration, to minimize
dilution of the sample (see Note 2).
3.2
Experimental
Setup
1. The sample temperature has a strong effect on the quality of
2D NMR spectra and should be optimized before carrying out
a titration. Due to the line broadening effect of amide hydro-
gen exchange with the solvent, which is particularly signiﬁcant
for disordered, solvent-exposed residues, the highest-quality
1H,15N correlation spectra can generally be obtained for
IDPs at lower temperatures, e.g., 278–283 K. This contrasts
with typical folded proteins, for which higher temperatures
result in more rapid rotational diffusion and hence sharper
resonances (see Note 3).
2. Two-dimensional lineshape analysis proceeds by using a “vir-
tual spectrometer” to calculate the evolution of magnetization
2D Lineshape Analysis of IDP Interactions
483

through the same pulse sequence that was used to acquire the
experimental data. It is therefore important to acquire data
with a pulse sequence that is implemented within TITAN. At
the time of writing, HSQC and HMQC experiments are fully
implemented, but due to the more complex spin dynamics
involved in magnetization transfer steps, TROSY, sensitivity-
enhanced HSQC, and in-phase HSQC experiments are not
compatible and therefore are not recommended (see Note 4).
Our preferred
1H,15N correlation experiments are the
SOFAST-HMQC [59, 60] and the HSQC (speciﬁcally, the
FHSQC variant [61]). The SOFAST-HMQC provides excel-
lent experimental sensitivity with short acquisition times and
good resolution in t1 as the amide selective 1H refocusing pulse
also refocuses the 3JHNHA scalar coupling. However, transverse
relaxation and chemical exchange broadening are generally
more severe in the indirect dimension of HMQC experiments
compared to the HSQC, and therefore in some cases, the
HSQC
may
provide
more
useful
or
complementary
information.
Whichever experiment is selected, it is important that good
solvent suppression and ﬂat baselines are obtained, without the
need to apply ﬁrst-order phase correction in direct or indirect
dimensions (with the exception of 90/180 phase correction
for an initial half-dwell delay). Remarkably, this is not always
the case for standard library sequences. Bruker format pulse
programs are therefore provided with the TITAN download
(v. 1.6 onward) for SOFAST-HMQC and HSQC experiments
that we have found provide suitable high-quality data. Note
that a Reburp rather than an r-Snob refocusing pulse is recom-
mended in the SOFAST-HMQC experiment [60]. Short relax-
ation
delays
should
be
avoided
in
SOFAST-HMQC
experiments used for two-dimensional lineshape analysis (e.g.,
d1 must be longer than ca. 300 ms), to ensure that resonance
intensities are not strongly weighted by longitudinal relaxation,
which may vary between free and bound states.
3. Record a preliminary experiment with a wide sweep width, in
order to optimize the sweep width and offset. Acquisition
times in the direct and indirect dimensions are a balance
between obtaining sufﬁcient resolution and avoiding an exces-
sive number of points that may result in slow lineshape ﬁtting.
As a rough guide, we suggest acquisition times of 100 ms in the
direct dimension and 30–50 ms in the indirect dimension.
Folded peaks may also be ﬁtted in TITAN, and this may be
used to reduce the sweep width and hence the number of
points to be sampled.

3.3
Performing
the NMR Titration
1. Record a 1D 1H spectrum of the unbound protein sample, as a
reference, and an appropriate 2D experiment selected and set
up as detailed above.
2. Remove the sample from the spectrometer, and add the
required amount of ligand stock solution to the sample. Care
should be taken while doing this so material is not lost due to
adhesion to glass pipettes, Shigemi plungers, etc. Our recom-
mended approach is that the sample should not be removed
from the NMR tube, but instead the appropriate volume of
ligand stock should be added to the top of the tube, which is
recapped and closed with paraﬁlm and then inverted several
times to ensure complete mixing. A hand centrifuge can be
used to return the sample to the bottom of the tube, and with
careful handling, we ﬁnd that bubbles can generally be avoided
(which otherwise would greatly reduce the quality of the spec-
trum). Alternatively, the ligand may be delivered into the sam-
ple and mixed using a narrow metal spatula.
3. Reinsert the sample into the spectrometer, and after allowing
time for the temperature to re-equilibrate, lock, shim, and
recalibrate the 1H 90 pulse length (this is particularly impor-
tant if the ligand is dissolved in DMSO rather than in the NMR
buffer).
4. Record a new pair of 1D and 2D spectra, and repeat from step
2 until the titration is complete. Note that for analysis in
TITAN, it is essential that acquisition parameters such as the
spectrum widths or offsets are not changed between experi-
ments. The number of scans and receiver gain may however be
varied between points as required to obtain high-quality
spectra.
5. Alternatively, if a series of samples have instead been prepared
(e.g., because a high-concentration ligand stock could not be
prepared), these may be run sequentially in automation mode.
As a quality control measure, in this situation, we also recom-
mend acquiring 1D 1H spectra for each sample.
3.4
Data Analysis
3.4.1
Analysis of 1D 1H
Spectra
1D
1H spectra acquired across the titration series should be
inspected for unexpected changes in protein intensity or linewidth,
which may indicate aggregation or degradation. If a buffer was used
containing non-exchangeable protons (e.g., Tris, HEPES, acetate),
their chemical shifts may be used to verify that the sample pH
remained constant throughout the titration.
3.4.2
Processing
2D spectra should be processed in NMRPipe, using linear predic-
tion and exponential window functions. The strengths of the win-
dow functions should be chosen as a compromise between
eliminating truncation artifacts (“sinc wiggles”) and optimizing
2D Lineshape Analysis of IDP Interactions
485

sensitivity and minimizing overlap between adjacent signals. To
accelerate analysis in TITAN, it is helpful to extract only the 1H
chemical shift range containing signals to be analyzed, e.g.,
between 7 and 10 ppm (or less in the case of IDPs). No extraction
should be applied in the indirect dimension.
All spectra must be processed in an identical manner. To facili-
tate this, once ﬁd.com and nmrproc.com processing scripts have
been prepared for one spectrum, an automated script may be used
to process the remaining spectra, adapted from the example below:

Two-Dimensional
Lineshape Analysis
1. Launch TITAN, either via the pre-compiled binary installation
or within MATLAB using the command “TITAN” (having
added the TITAN directory to the path as described in the
documentation). The main interface is shown in Fig. 2 and
provides a directed path through the analysis procedure.
2. “Select binding model. . .” will launch a dialog to specify the
microscopic association mechanism to which experimental data
will be ﬁtted (Fig. 3). A number of binding models are avail-
able, describing a variety of situations. Some common models
are summarized in Table 1.
3. “Set up titration points and select data. . .” will open a dialog to
import experimental titration data (Fig. 4a) (see Note 5). For
convenience, this data may be copied and pasted from an Excel
spreadsheet, the format of which is shown in Fig. 4b. Depend-
ing on the binding model selected, protein and ligand concen-
trations must be speciﬁed for each titration point (corrected for
sample dilution), as well as the number of scans (ns) and
receiver gain (rg) used for each experiment. The experimental
data should be in the form of NMRPipe format (.ft2) ﬁles
generated by the processing steps above. Noise levels will be
calculated automatically for each experiment, based on maxi-

distribution, excluding intense regions associated with peaks.
These can be manually overwritten if necessary. Note that
accurate noise levels are critical for correct weighting of resi-
duals across multiple spectra.
4. Select the pulse sequence used for data acquisition (“Set up
pulse program. . .”). Several pulse sequences are available for
analysis within TITAN, of which HSQC and HMQC are the
most common experiments. It is important that the pulse
sequence is correctly speciﬁed as this will strongly affect the
results, as chemical exchange can have different effects on line-
shapes in the indirect dimension of HSQC and HMQC experi-
ments [40], as well as during coherence transfer periods [41].
Having selected an experiment type, further acquisition
and processing parameters must be speciﬁed (Fig. 5). These
parameters include the spectrometer frequency, frequency off-
sets, spectrum widths, the number of points in each dimension
(after zero ﬁlling and linear prediction, if applied), and the
exponential line broadening applied during processing. These
parameters should all be correctly parsed from the input
NMRPipe format data, except two that must be speciﬁed man-
ually: the 1JIS heteronuclear scalar coupling between the spins
being observed (ca. 92 Hz for amide spin systems) and the
value of the 3JHNHA scalar coupling that is active during the
ﬁnal acquisition step. For fully protonated amide spin systems,
the approximate value of 6.5 Hz has been sufﬁcient for all cases
the author has examined to date. However, if the protein being
observed is perdeuterated, then the 3JHNHA coupling should be
set to zero at this point (see Note 6).

Some experiments, such as the HSQC, will prompt for
further details on delays within the particular pulse sequence
employed, which are required to correctly propagate chemical
exchange through gradient selection delays and zz ﬁlters. If the
HSQC sequence provided is used, then the default parameters
will be correct.
5. Open the spin system editor (“Set up/edit spins and select
ROIs. . .”). This interface is used to select residues and regions
of the experimental spectra that are used for analysis. Spin
systems are a key concept within TITAN: each spin system
represents a single residue and, for every state speciﬁed by the
binding model (e.g., free and bound states), carries informa-
tion on direct and indirect chemical shifts (dI, dS) and line-
widths (R2I, R2S) (see Note 7). Optionally, spin systems can be
labelled with an assignment; otherwise a default numbered
label is created. For each spectrum, a spin system is associated

arrow keys. Left click in this panel to mark out a polygon
deﬁning the boundary of the ROI; a right click or the space
bar will add a ﬁnal point and close the boundary. This process is
then repeated for the remaining spectra. Distinct ROIs can be
deﬁned for each spectrum or alternatively the previous ROI
copied using the “c” key (see Note 8 for a discussion of the
optimal shapes of ROIs).
Once ROIs have been selected for all spectra, initial esti-
mates of peak positions are selected for all states in the binding
model (e.g., free and bound) by clicking at the appropriate
position in the left hand panel. By default, linewidths of all
states are set to 20 s1, which generally provides an acceptable
starting point for ﬁtting (see Note 7).
Where resonances of multiple residues overlap, there is no
restriction on ROIs also overlapping. However, these spin
systems should then be associated together into a “spin
group,” by assigning an arbitrary label (e.g., “group 1,”
“group 2”) to the relevant spin systems within the upper
panel of the spin system editor dialog (Fig. 7).
6. Having created a series of spin systems and associated ROIs,
before closing the spin system editor, select the parameters that
should be used for ﬁtting using the lower half of the dialog
(Fig. 7b). Two-dimensional lineshape analysis involves the ﬁt-
ting of many parameters, and so it is often helpful to carry out
the ﬁtting in two stages: ﬁrstly, to ﬁt only the free-state chemi-
cal shifts and linewidths using the ﬁrst (unbound) spectrum
only and then to ﬁx these chemical shifts and ﬁt the remaining
parameters, together with model parameters such as the disso-
ciation constant Kd and the dissociation rate, koff, using the
complete dataset.
7. Depending on the binding model selected above, a number of
model parameters must be speciﬁed, which represent thermo-
dynamic equilibrium and kinetic rate constants, such as Kd and
koff values. These can be edited by selecting “Set up/edit model
parameters. . . .” If initially only the ﬁrst spectrum is being used
for ﬁtting unbound chemical shifts, as described above, then
ﬁtting of model parameters should be turned off in this dialog
(Fig. 8).
8. After following the preparatory steps above, the “Fit!” com-
mand will now be enabled. Fitting will overwrite parameter
values, and so it is recommended to save the session before
proceeding. Upon proceeding, a dialog will prompt to select
spectra to be used in the ﬁtting process (e.g., the ﬁrst spectrum
only for the initial optimization of unbound peak positions).
While the ﬁtting process is running, a plot of the chi-square
residuals is displayed to show the progress of the optimization
algorithm, and on completion a list of the ﬁtted parameters will
2D Lineshape Analysis of IDP Interactions

be displayed in a new window. Parameter labels are of the form
“ASSIGNMENT_QUANTITY_MODEL STATE.” Note that
the reported error comes from the estimated covariance matrix,
and the use of bootstrap resampling methods (below) is recom-
mended for more robust estimates.
9. At this stage, the ﬁtting process may be repeated as indicated in
the workﬂow in the main window (Fig. 2), after adjusting the
ﬁxed and free parameters as required.

10. Once ﬁtting is complete, a variety of plots are available to assess
the quality of the ﬁt. Overlaid contour plots of observed and
ﬁtted spectra are a straightforward way to compare the good-
ness of ﬁt (Fig. 9a), but deviations in peak intensities – which
may be a signature of a more complex binding mechanism—are
not always obvious in such plots. Therefore, it is also useful to
examine interactive overlays of 3D waterfall plots, which may
give better insights into signal-to-noise levels and whether
intensities are being ﬁtted accurately (Fig. 9b). All plots may
be saved as publication quality vector graphics (eps format)
using the toolbar. Lastly, ﬁtted (simulated) spectra may be
exported into NMRPipe format for visualization and analysis
with other software packages such as CCPN Analysis or Sparky
[62, 63].
11. Finally, once the ﬁtting has been completed, the option to run
a bootstrap error analysis will be enabled. This will repeat the
previous ﬁtting step, with the same starting parameters as used
previously, using a series of spectra generated through resam-
pling of residuals from the best-ﬁt spectrum [40]. The user is
prompted for the number of bootstrap replicas to generate and
ﬁt; at least 50 are recommended to obtain reliable estimates of
parameter uncertainties.
Once complete, a summary report is generated containing
the mean and standard error of the ﬁtted parameters. The ﬁt
results from individual bootstrap replicas can also be tabulated,
but this information is perhaps more usefully displayed in the
form of the parameter covariance matrix (Fig. 10).
Parameters of interest should be inspected for strong cor-
relations that may point to weaknesses or hidden uncertainties
in the ﬁtting procedure. For example, for a spin system in fast
exchange, it may be difﬁcult to differentiate between a rela-
tively high-afﬁnity interaction with a small chemical shift dif-
ference between free and bound states and a lower-afﬁnity

interaction with a larger chemical shift difference, particularly if
the available titration data did not reach saturation. In this
situation, a strong correlation would therefore be expected
between the ﬁtted Kd and the ﬁtted chemical shift of the
bound state. In general, however, an analysis of multiple spin
systems results in a greatly improved covariance structure. This
points to the importance of globally ﬁtting multiple spin sys-
tems exhibiting fast, intermediate, and slow chemical exchange
or, where this is not possible, to ensuring that sufﬁcient ligand
is added to weak binding systems in fast chemical exchange so
that they reach saturation and an accurate estimate of the
bound state chemical shift can be determined.
12. The point at which a ﬁt result is regarded as “acceptable” is
ultimately subjective. A typical ROI contains ~500 points,
resulting in ~105 observations ﬁtted to ~102 parameters
(given 20 ROIs ﬁtted across 10 spectra), and given the com-
plexity of this simulation and ﬁtting process, it is difﬁcult to
devise a simple and robust measure of the goodness of ﬁt.
Instead, we recommend that the user consider the following
criteria in reaching a decision:
(a)
Fitted spectra should accurately reproduce the observed
experimental data. This should be assessed using both
contour and 3D plots, as discussed above (Fig. 9).

(b)
Selected ROIs should cover the full range of chemical
shift differences and chemical exchange regimes observed.
(c)
Sufﬁcient ROIs should have been selected such that the
inclusion of additional ROIs does not alter the ﬁtting
result (see Note 9).
(d)
Fitted parameters should have physically reasonable values
and not reached their minimum or maximum limits.
Where extreme values occur, this indicates that a parame-
ter is not being effectively constrained by the experimental
data, and its value should be interpreted with caution.
(e)
If a complex binding model is being ﬁtted, the user should
verify that a comparable quality of ﬁt cannot be obtained
using a simpler model (i.e., the principle of parsimony).

Notes
1. These guidelines are based on a simple 1:1 association reaction,
P + L Ð PL. The identiﬁcation and analysis of more complex
binding mechanisms may beneﬁt from a greater number of
points or, for example, varying the protein concentration in
addition to that of the ligand.
2. If a high-concentration ligand stock cannot be prepared (e.g.,
due to limited solubility or aggregation), then a lower-
concentration ligand stock may be prepared in the presence of
the protein, to avoid sensitivity loss due to dilution. Alterna-
tively, a series of individual titration samples should be
prepared, either directly (using 3 mm NMR tubes for efﬁ-
ciency) or from serial dilutions of two samples prepared with-
out ligand and with the maximum ligand concentration
required. However, we note that in all these cases the total
amount of 15N-labelled protein that is required is increased.
3. Experiments based on direct 13C detection, e.g., CON and
CACO, have been developed that provide well-resolved reso-
nances for disordered states under physiological conditions
[64, 65], albeit with decreased sensitivity, and titrations have
indeed been carried out using such methods [66]. However,
these
experiments
are
not
currently
implemented
for
two-dimensional lineshape analysis within TITAN and there-
fore will not be discussed further here.
4. To the extent that relaxation or chemical exchange during
magnetization transfer steps can be neglected, other experi-
ments such as transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy
(TROSY) and sensitivity-enhanced HSQCs may still be ana-
lyzed as if acquired with a regular HSQC pulse sequence, but
498
Christopher A. Waudby and John Christodoulou

the user should be aware of the additional assumptions
involved in such an analysis.
5. For illustrative purposes, data shown in this article use the
FBPNbox example provided in the TITAN download.
6. Perdeuteration of proteins (the substitution of all non-labile
protons for deuterons, by expression in D2O and d7-glucose) is
most commonly associated with high molecular weight and
slowly tumbling systems, of approximately 30 kDa and above,
and is usually applied in combination with TROSY experi-
ments. IDPs and IDRs experience rapid rotational diffusion
and therefore do not usually beneﬁt from the application of
TROSY experiments. Nevertheless, it has been reported that
perdeuteration can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of IDP
spectra, by eliminating the 3JHNHA scalar coupling that other-
wise increases 1H linewidths by 6–12 Hz [67].
7. Linewidths in TITAN are denoted R2I and R2S, in the direct
and indirect dimension, respectively. However, these values do
not represent exact relaxation rates, but instead reﬂect approxi-
mate combinations of in-phase and anti-phase relaxation rates,
as well as deviations from the constant 3JHNHA scalar coupling
imposed on all residues (deﬁned in the pulse program setup,
Fig. 5). Therefore, in practical terms, it is not particularly
helpful to set initial values for these parameters based on exper-
imental relaxation measurements, and we recommend that
caution should be exercised in any detailed interpretation of
ﬁtted values.
8. Our recommendations for the optimal shape and selection of
ROIs are illustrated in Fig. 11. ROIs should extend approxi-
mately two to three linewidths from the center of resonances,
in order
that linewidths may be accurately determined
(Fig. 11a). We also recommend that all ROIs for a given residue
should cover the full region of the spectrum in which its
resonances are observed (Fig. 11b), because the absence of
resonances in such empty regions may in fact represent addi-
tional experimental restraints. However, overly large ROIs
should be avoided (Fig. 11c), as these will only result in
increased noise, slower ﬁtting calculations, and potentially
inadvertent overlaps with adjacent resonances. Conversely,
tightly cropped ROIs (Fig. 11d) will reduce the accuracy of
ﬁtted linewidths and should be avoided.
9. As ﬁtting within TITAN overwrites previous results and rede-
ﬁnes the starting point for subsequent ﬁts, there is a risk of
becoming trapped in a local minimum when appending new
spin systems and ROIs to an existing ﬁt. We therefore recom-
mend saving TITAN sessions before performing ﬁts and
2D Lineshape Analysis of IDP Interactions
499

reloading these sessions before deﬁning and ﬁtting additional
spin systems.
10. Dimers are represented within TITAN using two separate spin
states, i.e., the equilibrium 2M Ð D is represented internally as
2M Ð D1 + D2. This allows for the possibility that the dimer
might be asymmetric [68]. To perform calculations for a sym-
metric dimer, the chemical shifts and linewidths of the states
D1 and D2 should be linked. This can be done by associating
the parameters to a number of available shared variables using
the lower panel of the spin system editor (Fig. 12).

Fig. 11 Optimal selection of ROIs. (a) Recommended setup: ROIs extend approximately two to three linewidths
from the center of resonances and contain the entire region of the spectrum within which resonances are
observed across the titration. Note that ROIs are identical for all spectra; hence only a single boundary can be
observed. (b) Not recommended: individual ROIs do not encircle the entire region within which resonances are
observed across the titration. (c) Not recommended: too large a selection, resulting in slow ﬁtting, increased
noise, and overlap with an adjacent residue. (d) Not recommended: too tight a selection, limiting accuracy
when ﬁtting linewidths

Measuring Effective Concentrations Enforced
by Intrinsically Disordered Linkers
Charlotte S. Sørensen and Magnus Kjaergaard
Abstract
Intrinsically disordered linkers control avidity, auto-inhibition, catalysis, and liquid-liquid phase separation
in multidomain proteins. Linkers enforce effective concentrations that directly affect the kinetics and
equilibrium positions of intramolecular reactions. Mechanistic understanding of the role of linkers thus
requires measurements of the effective concentrations in supramolecular complexes. Here, we describe an
experimental protocol for measuring the effective concentrations enforced by a linker using a competition
assay. The experiment uses a FRET biosensor that is titrated by a competitor peptide. The assay is designed
for parallel analysis of several constructs in a ﬂuorescent plate reader and has been used to study hundreds of
synthetic disordered linkers.
Key words Effective concentration, Intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), Linker, Fluorescent bio-
sensor, Polymer physics

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered linkers are common in multidomain pro-
teins, where they provide adaptable connections between domains.
By joining domains of different functions, linkers give multidomain
proteins functional properties that are not merely the sum of their
parts. Linkers allow biochemical reactions such as binding and
catalysis to occur within a single physical connected unit, and they
are thus mechanistically similar to intramolecular reactions. Cru-
cially, such intra-complex reactions are not concentration depen-
dent but instead depend on the connections between the
interacting domains. The kinetics and equilibria of intramolecular
reactions are governed by effective concentrations that are often
orders of magnitude above the total concentration [1, 2]. Effective
concentrations play an important role in, e.g., avidity of multivalent
interactions [1, 3], enzyme-targeting [4], auto-inhibition [5], or
liquid-liquid phase separation [6]. To understand the functions of

linkers quantitatively, it is thus necessary to understand how the
properties of the linker determine the effective concentration.
Effective concentrations are easy to measure in principle but
difﬁcult in practice. Effective concentrations are therefore typically
estimated based on theoretical descriptions of homopolymers
[2, 7–9]. Intrinsically disordered linker are, however, not homo-
polymers, and their properties depend strongly on the speciﬁc
sequence of the linker [10]. To understand how linkers ﬁne-tune
biochemical equilibria, there is thus no surrogate for experimental
measurements of the effective concentration. Effective concentra-
tions can be measured in competition experiments, where increas-
ing concentrations of free ligand displace a tethered interaction
[11]. When the free and tethered ligands are identical, the halfway
point of the displacement occurs when the concentration of the free
ligand corresponds to the effective concentration of the tethered
ligand. However, displacement of an intramolecular interaction
rarely gives rise to an observable signal, and full displacement
occurs at concentration above the solubility of most proteins.
Until recently, experimental determination of effective concentra-
tions was thus limited to organic model systems, where ﬂuorescent
competing ligands were available [11].
Effective concentrations are often independent of what is being
linked and is mainly a property of the linker [1, 12]. This suggests
that the effective concentration enforced by a given linker can be
measured in a convenient model system and then extrapolated back
to its natural surroundings. We recently developed a biosensor to
facilitate measurement of the effective concentration (Fig. 1a)
[10]. The biosensor consists of two interaction domains that form
antiparallel heterodimeric coiled coil (Fig. 1b) [13]. The two
domains are connected by a linker that enforces an effective con-
centration, which is what will be measured. Furthermore, the bio-
sensor contains two ﬂuorescent protein domains that can undergo
Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) [14]. The FRET efﬁ-
ciency drops when the intramolecular interaction is outcompeted
by a free peptide (Fig. 2a). The biosensor contains two puriﬁcation
tags, which allow for puriﬁcation by standard methods regardless of
the linker sequence. Compared to the wild-type complex, the
interaction pair in the biosensor has a mutation that lowers the
Kd by 30-fold (Fig. 2b). This allows the wild-type competitor to
outcompete the interaction at 30-fold lower concentrations and
thus allows measurement of effective concentrations in the milli-
molar range. The system is designed for parallel analysis of many
linkers and enabled us to probe how the linker sequence properties
determine its compaction and thus the ensuing effective concentra-
tions (Fig. 2c, d). Direct measurement of effective concentrations
can thus also be used to probe the relationship between sequence
and structure in intrinsically disordered proteins [10].

Fig. 1 Overview of the biosensor used to measure effective concentrations. (a)
The biosensor gene is embedded in a standard E. coli expression vector and
contains a FRET pair and two interacting domains (MBD2 and p66α) connected
by a variable linker. The biosensor contains a mutant MBD2 domain (∗) with
weaker binding to p66α to allow free wild-type competitor to compete more
efﬁciently. For convenience the construct contains several unique restriction
sites to allow future modiﬁcation. (b) The interaction pair forms an antiparallel
dimeric coiled coil, which is ideal as it places the N-termini of one domain in
close proximity to the C-terminus of the other. (c) The protein can be puriﬁed
using the two afﬁnity tags. Internal cleavage in mRuby3 results in proteolytic
fragments at lower molecular weight that do not disrupt the measurement.

Fig. 2 Measurement of effective concentrations. (a) The biosensor is constructed to allow binding between
MBD2 and p66α, which brings the ﬂuorescent proteins close together, and allow FRET. Free MBD2 peptide
can displace the intramolecular ligand at sufﬁciently high peptide concentration resulting in decreased FRET.
The fusion protein contains a mutation in the MBD2 domain that weakens the interaction with p66α and allows
wild-type MBD2 peptide to compete more efﬁciently. (b) A correction factor corresponding to the difference in

Methods
3.1
Cloning of Linker
Sequence into
Reporter Plasmid
The DNA sequence corresponding to the linker that will be ana-
lyzed has to be cloned into reporter construct between the unique
NheI and KpnI sites. We ﬁnd that the constructs are most cost-
efﬁciently produced by commercial DNA synthesis companies, and
the linker can typically be delivered directly in the reporter vector.
The vector can be made available directly at GenScript upon
request. Alternatively, the constructs can be prepared by standard
DNA ligation cloning techniques [16].
3.2
Expression
and Puriﬁcation
of Fluorescent
Biosensor
3.2.1
Biosensor
Expression
1. Transform the biosensor plasmid into chemically competent
bacteria: Add 1 μL DNA stock to 50 μL chemically competent
E. coli BL21(DE3). Incubate on ice for 15 min. Heat shock for
45 s at 42 C using a water bath. Incubate the cells on ice for
5 min. Add 250 μL LB medium, and allow the cells to recover
for 1 h at 37 C in a shaking incubator. Add 100 μL of the cell
suspension to an LB ampicillin agar plate and spread with a
sterile Drigalski spatula. Incubate the plates upside down over
night at 37 C.
2. Starter culture: Pick a colony from each plate using an inocula-
tion loop, and transfer it to 5 mL LB with ampicillin. The cells
should be cultured in a disposable tube with a loose-ﬁtting lid
allowing oxygenation. Incubate for 6 h at 37 C in the shaking
incubator at 120 rpm.
3. Add 50 mL ZYM-5052 with ampicillin to the bafﬂed ﬂask.
Start the culture by addition of 1 mL starter culture. Incubate
in cultures while shaking at 120 rpm in a shaking incubator at
37 C for 2–3 h before reducing the temperature to 18 C.

Charlotte S. Sørensen and Magnus Kjaergaard

Typical shaking incubators allow up to 24 cultures to be
expressed in parallel. Expression at higher temperatures can
lead to insoluble protein. The cultures should be incubated
until they have changed color to a bright orange, which usually
occurs after 48–72 h (see Note 5).
4. Transfer the growth medium to a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and
harvest by centrifugation (15 min, 6000  g). Discard the
supernatant. Puriﬁcation can be started immediately, or the
bacterial pellets can be ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at 20 C for later puriﬁcation.
3.2.2
Generation
of Lysate
1. We typically process eight constructs in parallel as this matches
the capacity of our centrifuge. Add 90 μL of each of the
lysozyme and DNase stocks to 45 mL B-PER bacterial protein
extraction reagent. Add 45 μL of each of the stocks of pepsta-
tin, chymostatin, and leupeptin (see Note 6).
2. Dissolve each bacterial pellet in 5 mL bacterial protein extrac-
tion reagent using a disposable pipette. Incubate for 15 min at
room temperature. Use the remaining lysing solution to bal-
ance the tubes.
3. Centrifugate the lysate for 15 min at 14,000  g. Filter the
supernatant through paper ﬁlter and funnel. At this point, the
lysate can be ﬂash frozen and stored at 20 C for later
puriﬁcation.
3.2.3
Biosensor
Puriﬁcation by Ni-Afﬁnity
Chromatography
1. Pierce a small hole in the cap of a 50 mL centrifuge tube, such
that the hole snugly ﬁts the tip of the gravity ﬂow column.
Insert column into the hole. This system allows adjustment of
the ﬂow rate via the lid of the centrifuge tube (see Note 7).
2. Add 2 mL Ni-Sepharose slurry for a ﬁnal column volume of
1 mL. Wash the column with 7 mL MQ water and equilibrate
using 7 mL of Ni-binding buffer.
3. Load the lysate onto the column. If the lysate has been frozen,
it should be ﬁltered again. Ensure a ﬂow rate of about 1 mL/
min by adjusting the tightness of the centrifuge tube lid. The
column should become bright red.
4. Wash the column with 7 mL Ni-binding buffer. If the column
is still brightly colored, the ﬂow-through and wash can be
discarded.
5. Elute the fusion protein by addition of 5 mL Ni-elution buffer.
Collect the eluate for further puriﬁcation.
6. Clean the Ni-Sepharose column with 10 mL Ni-elution buffer
or until all color has disappeared. Wash with 7 mL of MQ water
and subsequently 10 mL of 20% ethanol. Store column at 4 C
Measuring Effective Concentrations Enforced by Intrinsically Disordered Linkers
511

with 20% ethanol solution on top. The column can be reused
but should be discarded when the ﬂow rate starts to decrease.
3.2.4
Biosensor
Puriﬁcation by Strep-Tag
Afﬁnity Chromatography
1. Mount the Strep-Tactin-XT column in a 50 mL centrifuge
column as described in Subheading 3.2.3, step 1. Equilibrate
the column with 5 mL Strep-Tactin binding buffer.
2. Load half of the eluate from the Ni-afﬁnity column onto the
Strep-Tactin column. Wash with 5 mL Strep-Tactin binding
buffer (see Note 8).
3. Elute proteins with 5 mL Strep-Tactin elution buffer. Collect
only the most concentrated part of the eluate, which is usually
between an elution volume of 0.5 and 2.5 mL.
4. Wash the Strep-Tactin column with 5 mL MQ water, followed
by 5 mL of 0.5 M NaOH to wash out the bound biotin.
Equilibrate with 10 mL Strep-Tactin binding buffer (or until
the ﬂow-through has pH 8,) and store at 4 C.
5. Analyze the puriﬁed protein by SDS-PAGE to ensure purity.
The fusion protein preparation invariably contains proteolytic
cleavage fragments at lower molecular weight due to proteo-
lytic sensitivity of mRuby3 [10] (Fig. 1c). The fragments
remain tightly bound and cannot be easily removed. The inter-
nal cleavages do not affect the subsequent assay.
6. Add the puriﬁed fusion protein to a dialysis tube with a cutoff
of 12–14 kDa. Dialyze against 5 L TBS at 4 C. Close the tube
with a sealing clip and a knot at either end. The sealing clips
allow the different tubes to be labelled. After 4 h, move the
dialysis tubes to a 5 L of fresh TBS buffer and dialyze
overnight.
7. Measure protein concentration spectrophotometrically. For
linkers without aromatics the ε(280 nm) ¼ 52,000 M1cm1.
For linker with aromatic residues, the linkers’ contribution to ε
can be estimated using ProtParam web server hosted at www.
expasy.org [17]. We typically get a yield of around 2 mL of
20 μM protein.
8. Flash freeze the dialyzed eluate and store in freezer for analysis.
Avoid extensive freeze-thaw cycles.
3.3
Expression
and Puriﬁcation
of MBD2 Peptide
The titration experiments require high concentration of the MBD2
peptide. To get enough protein, we usually prepare 6 L of bacterial
culture at the time.
1. Transform chemically competent E. coli BL21(DE3), and make
7 mL starter culture as described in Subheading 3.2.1, steps 1
and 2.
512
Charlotte S. Sørensen and Magnus Kjaergaard

2. Prepare six 5 L bafﬂed ﬂasks with 1 L ZYM-5052 auto-induc-
tion medium in each. Add the starter culture to each, and
incubate in a shaking incubator for 24 h at 37 C (see Note 9).
3. Harvest cells by centrifugation (6000  g, 15 min). Dispose of
the supernatant. At this stage, the cells can be ﬂash frozen and
stored for later puriﬁcation.
4. Dissolve cells in 25 mL Ni-washing buffer per liter of culture
medium. Resuspend to avoid major cell clumps by shaking.
Distribute the cell suspension to 15 mL centrifuge tubes.
5. Incubate the cell suspension for 25 min at 80 C using the
thermoshaker, while shaking at 400 rpm, before rapidly cool-
ing the cell suspension on ice. This will lyse the cells, precipitate
most folded proteins including proteases [18], but leave the
intrinsically disordered MBD2 peptide in solution.
6. Centrifuge cell suspension at 14,000  g for 15 min. Save
supernatant and discard the pellet.
7. Prepare two gravity ﬂow columns with 3 mL Ni-Sepharose,
corresponding to 6 mL slurry. Wash with 15 mL MQ H2O,
and equilibrate in 15 mL Ni-binding buffer (see Note 10).
8. Filter the lysate using the ﬁlter paper and funnel, and load lysate
corresponding to 3 L of growth media per column. Wash the
column with 15 mL 20 mM imidazole buffer. Control the ﬂow
rate as in Subheading 3.2.2, step 1.
9. Elute the peptide with 15 mL of Ni-elution buffer with ﬁrst
40 mM imidazole and then 60, 80, 100, 200, and 500 mM,
where the eluate is collected separately. Run samples on an
SDS-PAGE, and pool fractions with a single protein lane with
an apparent molecular weight of ~10 kDa. Usually the 40 mM
elution will have impurities, whereas the 500 mM elution does
not contain protein.
10. Clean the column with 15 mL of 500 mM imidazole. Wash
with 15 mL of MQ water followed by 20 mL of 20% ethanol.
Store the column at 4 C with 5 mL of 20% ethanol solution
on top.
11. Load the pooled eluate into an appropriate length of dialysis
tubing (MWCO ¼ 3.5 kDa). Dialyze for 4 h against 5 L of TBS
buffer at 4 C. Transfer the dialysis tubing to 5 L of fresh TBS
buffer and dialyze overnight. This is the last stage at which the
MBD2 can be frozen although ideally freezing should be
avoided.
12. Prepare centrifugal ﬁlter by ﬁlling it with 15 mL TBS and
spinning it for 10 min at 3000  g at 4 C. Discard the TBS.
13. Add 15 mL of the dialysate to the centrifugal ﬁlter by spinning
at 3000  g at 4 C. Remove the ﬂow-through, and measure
Measuring Effective Concentrations Enforced by Intrinsically Disordered Linkers
513

the A280 nm using a spectrophotometer. Top centrifugal ﬁlter
up to 15 mL with dialysate. Repeat the procedure until all
dialysate has been added. Concentrate the remaining MBD2
solution until an A280 nm of ~3.5 is achieved corresponding to a
peptide concentration of 2350 μM (ε280nm ¼ 1490 M1cm1)
(see Note 11).
14. Transfer the sample to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and centrifuge
at 14,000  g for 10 min to remove aggregates. Measure
A280 nm ﬁve times, and use the average to calculate the protein
concentration. Store protein on ice until use and do not freeze
at this point.
3.4
Competition
Titration
1. Prepare at least 200 μL master mix of each of the biosensor
proteins to be measured with a ﬁnal concentration of 0.55 μM
biosensor and 5.5 mg/L BSA. Distribute equal portions of the
master mix equal to 8 wells spanning a column in a 96-well
plate to allow pipetting by a multipipette (Fig. 3a).
2. Estimate the volume of competitor peptide needed at each
concentration: 3 repeats of 9 μL each result in 27 μL per
biosensor
variant.
Add
10%
extra
to
be
safe:
V ¼ 30 μL  Nvariants.
3. Add 2  Vof peptide stock solution to a corner well of the deep
well plate. Add V μL TBS to all other well in two adjacent
columns (wells 2–16 in Fig. 3b). Make a twofold dilution by
transferring V μL from well 1 to well 2 following the pattern
indicated in Fig. 3b. Mix by pipetting up and down ﬁve times.
Continue by transferring from well 2 to 3 and so on until
reaching well 16. Remove V μL from well 16 and discard to
maintain identical volumes.
4. Use an 8-well pipette to transfer 2 μL biosensor master mix to
each well in a column on the 384-well plate (Fig. 3a). Ensure
that the droplet stays in the well by depositing them against the
wall of the well. Use three identical columns of each variant to
obtain triplicates. Continue for each biosensor variant and note
the order of samples.
5. Transfer 9 μL from each well in the deep well plate using a
multipipette. The two columns in the 96-well plate should be
interleaved into a single column in the 384-well plate in two
pipetting operations (Fig. 3b). Mix the sample by carefully
pipetting up and down ﬁve times.
6. Equilibrate the ﬂuorescence plate reader to 30 C (see Note
12).
7. Inspect the wells visually before ﬂuorescence measurement.
The samples should sit at the bottom of the well. Use an
excitation wavelength of 500 nm with a bandwidth of 15 nm.
For emission wavelengths, 535 and 600 nm are used for the
514
Charlotte S. Sørensen and Magnus Kjaergaard

donor and acceptor, respectively, with a 25 nm bandwidth
for both.
8. Record ﬂuorescence emission for each well. We use 5 ﬂashes of
1 s excitation per well.
9. Before ﬁnishing the experimental work, calculate the apparent
FRET efﬁciency as described below. Identify large outliers,
which are typically due to bubbles. Prepare a fresh sample of
these and remeasure.
3.5
Data Analysis
The analysis capabilities and output of ﬂuorescence instruments
vary, so we will describe a generic approach for determining the
effective concentration using generic software.
1. Export the ﬂuorescence emission intensities for both donor
and acceptor as comma-separated values. Import the data into
a data-handling program of your choice such as MATLAB or
Excel. Generate a column of x-values corresponding to the
MBD2 concentration.
2. Calculate the apparent FRET efﬁciency for each measurement
from Eq. 1:
E ¼
I A
I A þ I D
ð1Þ
where ID and IA are the ﬂuorescence emission from the donor
and acceptor, respectively (see Note 13).
3. For each dataset, perform nonlinear ﬁtting to Eq. 2:
1. Prepare dilution series in 
deepwell plate
2. Prepare biosensor master-mix

variants, the samples are most easily handled using multiwell plates. For each biosensor variant, the master
mix is distributed across a row in a 96-well plate for pipetting by an 8-well multipipette. For the titration series,
a twofold dilution series is prepared of the competitor in the deep well plate in the pattern shown in (b). This
allows the titration to be transferred to the 384-well plate in order using two interleaved pipetting steps per

P ¼ 0.1 μM (ﬁxed).

Notes
1. In many cases, trace metals can be left out as the bacteria will
get the metals they need from the yeast extract. However, the
metal content in such extracts can vary.
2. There are less expensive non-commercial alternatives; however
most of these involve longer lysing times.
3. This product should ideally not be replaced. We have tried
several centrifugal concentrators, and this was the only type
capable of reaching sufﬁciently high concentrations.
4. The buffers can be prepared by making buffer stocks with 0 and
500
mM
imidazole
and
mixing
the
intermediate
concentrations.
5. Small volumes of bacterial culture are easier to handle in paral-
lel, and we ﬁnd that 50 mL culture produces ample protein for
determination of effective concentrations.
6. The cells could also be lysed by physical methods such as a
sonicator. However, the chemical lysis protocol allows proces-
sing of many constructs in parallel.
7. Similar or better puriﬁcation could be achieved using FPLC-
based protocols; however the gravity ﬂow afﬁnity puriﬁcation
allows for puriﬁcation of many variants in parallel.
8. The Strep-Tactin column has less capacity than the Ni column,
so there may still be some colored protein in the ﬂow-through.
If the column is not brightly colored after the wash, it has lost
capacity and should be discarded.

9. To achieve the high concentration needed in the competitive
titration, it is important to use at least 6 L of bacterial culture.
10. To achieve pure protein in a single chromatographic step, it is
important to saturate the column entirely with MBD2. A larger
bed volume will result in less pure protein.
11. Concentrated MBD2 may get a gel-like appearance when
stored on ice. The protein can be dissolved by heating to
50 C and repeating Subheading 3.3, step 14.
12. We use 30 C because this is the lowest stable temperature in a
plate reader without active cooling. For other plate readers,
this may be different.
13. These values should not be interpreted in terms of distances as
there is considerable direct excitation of the acceptor ﬂuoro-
phore during the donor excitation.

Abstract
Unlike for structured proteins, the study of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) requires selection of ad
hoc assays and strategies to characterize their dynamic structure and function. Late embryogenesis abun-
dant (LEA) proteins are important plant IDPs closely related to water-deﬁcit stress response. Diverse
hypothetical functions have been proposed for LEA proteins, such as membrane stabilizers during cold
stress, oxidative regulators acting as ion metal binding molecules, and protein protectants during dehydra-
tion and cold/freezing conditions. Here we present two detailed protocols to characterize IDPs with
potential protein/enzyme protection activity under partial dehydration and freeze-thaw treatments.

Introduction
Data reported during the last decade have provided convincing
evidence that there are proteins with high structural ﬂexibility and
instability, currently known as intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs). This set of proteins are not only fully functional but also
display more than one biological activity and have been identiﬁed in
all the living organisms where they have been searched [1]. Struc-
tural disorder is also found in deﬁned sections of ordered proteins,
designated as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). One of the
distinctive properties of IDPs and IDRs is their amino acid compo-
sition and distribution, with a high representation of charged and
polar amino acid residues and low fraction of hydrophobic ones

[2]. Numerous functions have been attributed to these proteins,
many of them related to signaling processes, in some cases acting as
hubs in protein interaction networks [3]. They may recognize
multiple partners given their structural ﬂexibility, allowing them
to present different structures depending on posttranslational
modiﬁcations [4] and/or on the characteristics of the cellular
milieu [5]. IDP versatility extends even further because they have
also been implicated in the liquid-liquid phase separation phenom-
enon
and
formation
of
proteinaceous
membrane-less
organelles [6].
IDPs involved in different processes have also been identiﬁed in
plants [7]. Among the best characterized plant IDPs are those
proteins highly accumulated during late embryogenesis, a stage
where orthodox seeds undergo dehydration, a required condition
to resume plant development upon germination. These proteins,
termed late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, also accumu-
late in response to all those conditions where water availability is
reduced in plant cells (dehydration, salinity, low temperatures) [8]
and some of them in response to other adverse conditions such as
oxidative stress [9] or high temperatures [10, 11]. LEA-like pro-
teins have also been described in some bacteria genera [12] and in
other eukaryotic organisms, interestingly, in those showing anhy-
drobiotic characteristics [13, 14]. Proteins with similar physico-
chemical properties to those showed by IDPs and LEA proteins,
and whose accumulation also responds to water-deﬁcit conditions
but with no sequence similarity to LEA proteins, were also
described in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms; these were
designated as hydrophilins [15]. Even though the in vivo function
of LEA proteins and other hydrophilins is still unclear, the estab-
lishment of partial dehydration and freeze-thaw in vitro assays has
revealed a protective action of different LEA proteins, and some
hydrophilins, on enzyme activities sensitive to these water-deﬁcit
conditions [16–21].
The in vitro assays to determine a protective activity of a protein
under water-deﬁcit conditions require the use of reporter proteins,
whose activity/structure shows to be sensitive to the treatments
imposed by the assays. The reporter proteins used hitherto in this
kind of assays are lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alcohol dehydro-
genase (ADH) [22], malate dehydrogenase (MDH) [16], citrate
synthase (CS) [23], rhodanese, fumarase [24], and catalase [25],
with LDH being the most commonly used.
Here, we present two detailed protocols to establish optimal
experimental conditions to implement freeze-thaw and partial
dehydration experiments using LDH and ADH as reporter proteins
to determine protective activity of IDPs (LEA proteins and other
hydrophilins). We are aware of other dehydration methods
reported to evaluate the protective activity of hydrophilins

[23, 26]; however, in this work, we present those that we consider
more effective.
The methodology of these protocols is divided in three major
procedures: (1) the master mix preparation, where important vari-
ables should be considered to correctly perform the experiments,
(2) the low water availability treatment, and (3) determination of
the activity of the reporter proteins.

Material
Prepare all solutions with sterile distilled water and analytical grade
reagents. Use gloves during all procedures. Treatment buffers can
be prepared at room temperature and stored at 4 C. Protein
solutions must be freshly prepared and kept on ice. The assay
cannot be paused once started because the reporter protein might
lose activity.

Methods
3.1
Master Mix
Preparation
1. Mix 7 μL of LDH 100 or ADH 100 solution with 7 μL of
protectant 100 solution, where the working molar ratio is
1:1. For a different molar ratio, for example, 1:10, 70 μL of
protectant 100 solution should be used. Fill up to 700 μL
with LDH or ADH treatment buffer (see Notes 2 and 3).
2. Prepare one master mix for each variable to be tested, i.e.,
different protectants or molar ratios (see Notes 4 and 5).
3.2
Low Water
Availability Assay:
Freeze-Thaw
Treatment
1. Vortex each master mix for 2–3 s. Aliquot 100 μL of each
master mix in six microfuge tubes of 1.5 mL. Three of the six
tubes will be subjected to the freeze-thaw treatment, while the
rest will remain on ice during the experiment as control.
522
David F. Rendo´ n-Luna et al.

2. The freeze-thaw treatment consists in placing the tubes in
liquid N2 for 1 min and then thawing them in a thermoblock
at 25 C for 5 min (see Note 6).
3. Repeat step 2 as many times as required for the complete
deactivation of the reporter proteins (see Note 7).
3.3
Low Water
Availability Assay:
Dehydration Treatment
1. Register the weight (WT) of each empty 1.5 mL microfuge
tube needed for the experiment.
2. Vortex the prepared master mix for 2–3 s. Distribute the master
mix in six weighed microfuge tubes, 75 μL per tube.
3. Register the weight of each of the six tubes containing master
mix (WT + MM), and calculate the weight of the master mix
solution added (WMM) as follows:
wMM ¼ wTþMM  wT
4. If the WMM is different to 75 μg, adjust the volume to 75 μL
with master mix solution.
5. Register again the weight of each tube (WFT).
6. Three of the six tubes will be subjected to partial dehydration,
while the rest will remain on ice during the experiment as
control samples.
7. The partial dehydration treatment consists in subjecting the
samples to progressive water loss using a vacuum concentrator
at approximately 65 kPa (see Note 8).
8. Continue with the dehydration procedure (see Note 9), moni-
toring the weight of sample tubes (Wx) until the desired per-
centage of water loss (%WL) is reached (see Note 10):
%wL ¼ wx  100
ð
Þ
wFT
9. When the desired %WL is reached, calculate and add the volume
of H2O needed to recover the initial weight of 75 μg.
10. Keep all tubes (including controls) on ice, and proceed to
measurement of the enzymatic activity.
3.4
Measurement
of LDH or ADH Activity:
Spectrophotometer
Setting
1. Adjust the UV spectrophotometer at 340 nM to detect
NADH consumption (see Notes 11 and 12). For LDH, deter-
mine absorbance for 45 s, whereas for ADH extend the mea-
surement up to 2 min. The NADH consumption time can be
adjusted as it depends on the amount of enzyme used in each
reaction.

Measurement
of LDH or ADH Activity:
Enzyme Activity
Quantiﬁcation
This section describes the determination of LDH and ADH activ-
ities. Use the appropriate reaction buffer.
1. Use 600 μL of buffer without NADH in the quartz cuvette to
blank the spectrophotometer.
2. Pour 600 μL of LDH (see Note 13) or ADH reaction buffer
into
the
clean
quartz
cuvette,
and
place
it
in
the
spectrophotometer.
3. For LDH or ADH activity determinations, take 15 μL of one of
the master mix aliquots. Then, mix quickly and thoroughly
with the reaction buffer in the cuvette, and immediately begin
the absorbance measurements (see Note 14).
4. Register the slope in the linear range of the curve (absorbance
over time). For LDH the activity corresponds to a negative
slope, because it represents the consumption of NADH,
whereas ADH activity leads to NADH production resulting
in a positive slope (Fig. 1a, b).
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with all samples (see Note 15).
6. The mean value for the slopes determined for all untreated
samples will be considered as 100% enzyme activity. The
mean values of the slopes for treated samples can then be
compared to the 100% of enzyme activity (Fig. 2).

Notes
1. Before performing any assays, the integrity and purity of the
IDPs of interest should be veriﬁed. Special care should be taken
in the determination of protein concentration, particularly in
the case of IDPs. Various observations indicate that the protein
quantiﬁcation assays commonly used (Bradford method or
absorbance at 280 nm) may lead to serious errors in the calcu-
lation of IDP concentration with critical implications in data
interpretation [27, 28]. In agreement with Contreras-Martos
et al. [29], the ninhydrin method or the Qubit™protein assay
seems to be the most reliable quantiﬁcation method for many
IDPs. We strongly recommend referring to Contreras-Martos
et al. [29] for details.
2. The magnitude of IDP protective activity depends on the
reporter/protectant molar ratio. To obtain reliable data, the
determination of the protection capacity of a protein should
include at least ﬁve different molar ratios, between 1:1 and
1:20. Also, it should be considered that LDH and ADH activ-
ities start to decrease once they are diluted in the reaction
buffer. To slow this drop of activity, all procedures must be
carried out on ice, unless otherwise indicated. Reliable LDH
Determining the Protective Activity of IDPs
525

activity is measured at 25 C; if necessary, place the reaction
buffer in a water bath to maintain this temperature.
3. We estimated 0.25 μM as the optimal concentration of reporter
protein. This ﬁnal concentration of protein avoids protection
due to molecular crowding and allows an optimal enzymatic
activity determination. The amount of pyruvic acid and NADH
for LDH reaction buffer, and of ethanol and NAD for ADH
reaction buffer, used in these protocols, are optimal for the
determinations of the corresponding enzyme activities.
4. Positive and negative controls should be used in these assays.
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is a good protein stabilizer;
therefore, it can be used as a positive control of protection.
Lysozyme and RNAse A are globular and small proteins
(14.4 kDa and 13.7 kDa, respectively) that can be used as
negative controls because they do not show a protective effect
in these assays.
5. To facilitate sample handling, we recommend preparing up to
four master mixes per experiment.
6. To avoid treatment variation between samples, freeze and thaw
all the tubes at the same time.
7. We have found that seven cycles are enough for complete
inactivation of LDH, while 12 cycles are required to inactivate
ADH. It is also possible to determine reporter protein aggre-
gation, which is detected even after two freeze-thaw cycles,
measuring absorbance by light scattering at 320 or 340 nm.
8. Although, during the vacuum-dry treatment, most of the times
the temperature in the concentrator chamber keeps quite stable
at room temperature (25 C), to avoid a risky increase that
could lead to heat denaturation of your protein samples, moni-
tor the temperature by assembling a thermometer inside the
chamber. If you notice a temperature rise, cool down the
chamber by placing a sealed bag with iced water on the top.
9. Care should be taken when dehydration is close to 80% because
at this point the water loss rate increases. Avoid complete
dryness because the enzyme will be fully inactivated regardless
of the presence of protectant protein.
10. The percentage of dehydration is scored as the weight loss due
to water evaporation in each tube.
11. We follow the consumption of NADH due to the reduction of
pyruvic acid to lactate catalyzed by LDH.
Pyruvicacid þ NADH $
LDH Lacticacid þ NADþ
12. We follow the production of NADH due to the oxidation of
ethanol to acetaldehyde catalyzed by ADH.

13. The amount of NADH used in the LDH reaction buffer is
enough to have an initial A340  0.8  0.1. After blanking with
buffer without NADH, read the absorbance of LDH reaction
buffer alone. If the measurement of initial A340 is different
from 0.8  0.1, prepare fresh LDH reaction buffer.
14. LDH consumes the NADH present in the LDH reaction
buffer in approximately 1 min, so it is important to add the
aliquot sample, mix, and read the absorbance as quickly as
possible.
15. Even though samples remain on ice all the time, loss of activity
is unavoidable. To compensate the error in measurements
during the protocol, determine enzymatic activity of control
samples without treatment at the beginning, during, and at the
end of the procedure.

Screening Intrinsically Disordered Regions for Short Linear
Binding Motifs
Muhammad Ali, Leandro Simonetti, and Ylva Ivarsson
Abstract
The intrinsically disordered regions of the proteome are enriched in short linear motifs (SLiMs) that serve as
binding sites for peptide binding proteins. These interactions are often of low-to-mid micromolar afﬁnities
and are challenging to screen for experimentally. However, a range of dedicated methods have been
developed recently, which open for screening of SLiM-based interactions on large scale. A variant of
phage display, termed proteomic peptide phage display (ProP-PD), has proven particularly useful for the
purpose. Here, we describe a complete high-throughput ProP-PD protocol for screening intrinsically
disordered regions for SLiMs. The protocol requires some basic bioinformatics skills for the design of the
library and for data analysis but can be performed in a standard biochemistry lab. The protocol starts from
the construction of a library, followed by the high-throughput expression and puriﬁcation of bait proteins,
the phage selection, and the analysis of the binding-enriched phage pools using next-generation sequenc-
ing. As the protocol generates rather large data sets, we also emphasize the importance of data management
and storage.

Introduction
Short linear motifs (SLiMs) are compact binding interfaces that are
crucial for cell function. SLiMs are typically found within stretches
of 3–12 amino acids, of which 3–4 amino acids serve as the main
determinants of binding, although ﬂanking regions contribute to
afﬁnity and speciﬁcity [1]. They are commonly found in intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs), which represent more than 30% of the
human proteome. SLiMs are bound by specialized domains, of
more than 150 families [2]. Among the most abundant and most
studied SLiM-binding domains in the human proteome are PDZ
domains [3], SH3 domains [4], and WW domains [5]. SLiMs are
also bound by enzymes such as kinases [6], phosphatases [7, 8], and
E3 ligases [9]. SLiM-based interactions promote complex assembly

and determine cellular protein localization and modiﬁcation state
and protein stability. The ELM database, which is the most com-
prehensive, manually curated database of SLiM-based interactions,
holds over 3000 instances of motif-based interactions [10]. How-
ever, the instances compiled in the ELM database represent only a
fraction of the SLiMs expected to hide in the proteome [11]. An
underlying reason for this is that SLiM-based interactions often are
of low-to-mid micromolar afﬁnities, which make them well suited
to fulﬁll their cellular functions but inherently difﬁcult to capture
experimentally. Their limited footprints also make them difﬁcult to
predict accurately using bioinformatics.
Various approaches such as peptide arrays and combinatorial
peptide phage display have been used to characterize the SLiM-
binding preferences of speciﬁc domains or domain families [12–
14]. One of the approaches that has emerged for charting SLiM-
based interactions is proteomic peptide phage display [15–
17]. ProP-PD is a variant of phage display where peptides to be
displayed are designed based on the IDRs of a proteome of interest.
The method combines bioinformatics, custom oligonucleotide
library synthesis, peptide phage display, and next-generation
sequencing (NGS) (Fig. 1). In our proof-of-concept study, we
generated two ProP-PD libraries, one that displays the C-terminal
regions of the human proteome and one displaying C-terminal
peptides of viral proteomes [17]. More recently we generated a
“human disorderome” library, designed to display hexadecameric
peptides that tile all the IDRs of the human proteome [16]. This
library has, for example, been used to uncover the SLiM-based
interactions of scaffold proteins (e.g., PDZ domains [17, 18])
and phosphatases (e.g., calcineurin [19] and PP2A [7])). Following
a similar strategy, the binding speciﬁcity of the Cdc14 phosphatase
was recently elucidated using a yeast “disorderome” phage library
[20]. We have further shown that the approach can be tuned to
uncover phospho-regulation of SLiM-based interactions [21]. An
added strength of the method is that it is scalable. As for combina-
torial peptide phage display [13, 22], selections can be performed
in 96-well format, which paired with NGS opens for screening of
SLiM-based interactions on large scale. ProP-PD selections provide
data sets of binding peptides that can be used for generating con-
sensus binding motifs. By matching the peptides to the library
designs, ProP-PD further provides information on the identities
of the host proteins of the peptides and suggests interactions of
potential biological relevance. The approach is thus a valuable
complement to other methods for interactome analysis.
In this chapter, we describe a protocol for ProP-PD library
construction, high-throughput (HTP) protein expression and puri-
ﬁcation, HTP phage display selections, and NGS analysis. As the
experiment provides relatively large data sets, we also provide gen-
eral guidelines for data analysis and storage.

the selection through phage pool ELISA, and how to analyze the content of binding-enriched phage pools
through NGS. We ﬁnally elaborate on how to manage and store the results

Methods
3.1
Phage Library
Construction
The ﬁrst step in ProP-PD is to design an oligonucleotide library
based on a proteome of interest and to obtain a custom-designed
oligonucleotide library from a commercial provider (Fig. 1). The
library design depends on the research question, which is beyond
the scope of this protocol. We have, for example, designed a phage
library that displays IDRs of the human proteome using hexadeca-
meric peptides that overlap by seven amino acids [16] and a
C-terminal (nonameric peptides) ProP-PD library that displays all
the C-termini of the proteome that holds known or predicted
phospho-sites [21]. For those interested, our published library
designs can be obtained upon request. As part of the design pro-
cess, constant ﬂanking regions are added to all oligonucleotides in
the library (Figs. 1 and 2). They are used for library construction
534
Muhammad Ali et al.

and later for PCR ampliﬁcation for sequencing purposes. The
obtained oligonucleotide library is genetically fused to the major
coat protein P8 of the ﬁlamentous M13 phage using a modiﬁed
version of Kunkel mutagenesis [23]. Following this protocol, a
phagemid is transformed into E. coli CJ236 cells that lack functional
dUTPase and uracil-N-glycosylase. The phagemid-containing bac-
teria are infected with M13K07 helper phage, which leads to the
packing of single-stranded phagemid DNA (ssDNA), with uracil
incorporated instead of thymine, into phage particles that are
secreted into the medium. The dU-ssDNA is puriﬁed from the
medium and used as template for synthesis of heteroduplex,
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) using the PCR-ampliﬁed and
phosphorylated oligonucleotide library. The dsDNA library is
then electroporated into E. coli SS320 cells preinfected with M13
K07. The bacteria are grown overnight, which leads to the produc-
tion and ampliﬁcation of the phage library that can then be har-
vested, as detailed below.
Fig. 2 Generation of a ProP-PD library. A custom oligonucleotide library is
designed based on the IDRs of a proteome of interest. Constant regions
ﬂanking the sequences of interest are introduced; these regions are used for
cloning and as primer target for ampliﬁcation. The design is synthesized by a
company and later ampliﬁed and used to create a phagemid library, which is
electroporated into E. coli (preinfected with M13K07 helper phage) that produces
and ampliﬁes the phage library

3.1.1
Puriﬁcation
of du-ssDNA
The following is a modiﬁed version of QIAprep Spin M13 kit
protocol for puriﬁcation of dU-ssDNA based on a previously
described protocol [24]. The resulting ssDNA should be sufﬁcient
for the construction of a number of ProP-PD libraries of average
size (10,000–1 million sequences).
1. Transform an appropriate phagemid vector into E. coli CJ236,
and grow overnight on LB plate containing 100 μg/mL carbe-
nicillin at 37 C.
2. The following day, inoculate a single colony into 1 mL 2YT
media supplemented with M13K07 helper phage (1011 pfu/
mL), and grow for 2 h at 37 C and 200 rpm shaking. Use
100 μg/mL carbenicillin to maintain the phagemid and 25 μg/
mL chloramphenicol to maintain F0 episome (see Note 1).
3. Add 30 μg/mL kanamycin to select for bacteria infected with
M13K07 helper phage, and allow the culture to grow for 6 h at
37 C with 200 rpm shaking.
4. Transfer the culture into 30 mL of 2xYT supplemented with
100
μg/mL
carbenicillin,
30
μg/mL
kanamycin,
and
0.025 μg/mL uridine. Incubate at 37 C, shaking 200 rpm
for 20 h.
5. Pellet the bacteria by centrifugation at 10,000  g and 4 C for
20 min. Transfer the phage-containing supernatant to a fresh
50 mL tube with conical bottom.
6. To precipitate the phages, add 7.5 mL of PEG/NaCl to the
phage-containing supernatant, and incubate 5 min on ice.
7. Centrifuge for 20 min at 12,000  g to pellet the phage.
8. Remove the supernatant and spin for 2 min at 4000  g.
Aspirate the residual supernatant.
9. Resuspend the phage pellet in 0.5 mL PBS. Transfer the solu-
tion to a fresh 1.5 mL tube. Clear the solution from insoluble
debris by centrifugation at 15,000  g for 5 min. Transfer the
supernatant to a clean tube.
10. To lyse the phages, add 700 μL MP (Qiagen), mix by pipetting,
and incubate 2 min at RT.
11. Transfer the lysed phage solution to a QIAprep spin column in
a fresh tube, and centrifuge at 6000  g for 30 s. The phage
DNA will be bound to the column matrix. Discard the ﬂow-
through.
12. Add 700 μL of MLB buffer to the column and spin it at
6000  g for 1 min. Discard ﬂow-through. Repeat this step
once more.
13. Finally, wash the DNA by adding 700 μL of PE buffer to
column, and spin it at 6000  g for 1 min. Centrifuge again
at 15,000  g for 1 min to get rid of residual buffer from the
column.
536

14. To elute the dU-ssDNA, place the clean column in a fresh
1.5 mL tube, add 100 μL of EB buffer from the QIAquick
PCR puriﬁcation kit to the column, incubate for 5 min at room
temperature, and then centrifuge at 15,000  g for 2 min.
15. Conﬁrm the quality of ssDNA by 1% (w/v) agarose gel elec-
trophoresis using 1 TBE buffer and GelRed dye (see Note 2).
16. Quantify the DNA by absorbance at 260 nm using a
NanoDrop.
3.1.2
PCR Ampliﬁcation
of the Custom-Designed
Oligonucleotide Pool
and dsDNA Quantiﬁcation
A custom-designed oligonucleotide library encoding the desired
peptide sequences can be obtained from a commercial provider
(Fig. 2). The oligonucleotide pool is typically PCR ampliﬁed before
being used for phage library construction as described below.
1. Prepare eight 50 μL PCR reactions each containing 0.5 μM of
forward and reverse primers complementary to the constant
regions of the ordered oligonucleotide library (Fig. 2), 80 ng of
ssDNA template, and 25 μL of Phusion high-ﬁdelity PCR
master mix.
2. Use a thermocycler with this proﬁle: denaturation at 98 C for
10 s, annealing at 56 C for 15 s and ampliﬁcation at 72 C for
10 s. Repeat 18 times (see Note 3).
3. Verify the product by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis using a
50 bp ladder.
4. Pool four of the reactions and purify them using QIAquick
nucleotide removal kit. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions
but elute using 30 μL of elution buffer. This will remove excess
salts and enzymes.
5. Quantify the amount of PCR product in duplicate using
Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit following the manufac-
turer’s guidelines:
(a)
Dilute the PicoGreen dye 1:400 in TE buffer.
(b)
Prepare the lambda DNA standard by serial diluting it two
times in a range of 100 ng/μL to 1.56 ng/μL. Use TE
buffer for this purpose.
(c)
Mix 1 μL of DNA standard from each dilution with 25 μL
of dye. Also mix 1 μL of 10 diluted PCR-ampliﬁed
sample with 25 μL of dye. Include a no-DNA control.
(d)
Incubate for 5 min at room temperature, and read the
samples ﬂuorescence using a qPCR machine. Excitation,
480 nm; emission, 520 nm.
(e)
Generate a standard curve based on the readings of the
lambda DNA, and calculate the concentration of the PCR
product based on the linear ﬁt of the standard.

library, it is phosphorylated, annealed to ssDNA, and converted
into a ccc-dsDNA (covalently closed circular-dsDNA) library
(Fig. 2). The remaining PCR primers from the ampliﬁcation step
are removed directly before phosphorylation by treating the sample
with Exonuclease I.
1. Enzymatically
remove
the
PCR
primers
from
0.6
μg
PCR-ampliﬁed oligonucleotide library using 10 units of Exo-
nuclease I at 37 C for 1 h followed by heat inactivation at
80 C for 15 min. Flash cool on ice and use directly for the
next step.
2. To phosphorylate, add 2 μL of 10 mM ATP, 1 μL 100 mM
DTT, and 2 μL of 10 TM buffer. Add 10 units of T4 polynu-
cleotide kinase and H2O to a ﬁnal volume of 20 μL. Incubate
for 1 h at 37 C.
3. For annealing to the template ssDNA, add the phosphorylated
library to 10 μg of dU-ssDNA and 25 μL of 10 TM buffer,
and adjust the reaction volume to 250 μL using H2O. Incubate
at 90 C for 3 min, 50 C for 3 min, and 20 C for 5 min.
4. Finally, add 10 μL of 10 mM ATP, 10 μL of 10 mM dNTP mix,
15 μL 100 mM DTT, 30 Weiss units of T4 DNA ligase, and
30 units of T7 DNA polymerase to the annealed mixture, and
incubate at 20 C for maximum of 16 h.
5. Heat inactivate the enzymes at 70 C for 15 min, and digest the
wild-type template with 10 units FastDigest SmaI for 1 h at
37 C (see Note 4).
6. To purify the product, add 1 mL of QG buffer, and load it to
two QIA quick spin columns. Centrifuge at 16,000  g for
1 min and discard the ﬂow-through. Add 750 μL of PE buffer
to each column. Spin it at 13,000 rpm for 1 min followed by a
brief spin to remove residual buffer. Elute the DNA using
35 μL of ultrapure H2O.
7. To analyze the conversion of ssDNA to ccc-dsDNA, compare
the starting template to the product by analyzing them
through gel electrophoresis (1% agarose gel, 45 min, 80 mA)
stained with GelRed. Most, if not all, starting template should
have been converted to product. The dsDNA library can be
frozen or used directly for electroporation.

Electroporation
and Propagation of Phage
Library
Once the ccc-dsDNA library is ready, it is electroporated into highly
electro-competent E. coli SS320 cells preinfected with M13KO7
(Fig. 2), prepared as described elsewhere [24, 25]. The E. coli
SS320 strain is used because of its very high transformation
efﬁciency.
1. Thaw the supercompetent cells on ice. Mix them gently with
the DNA, and transfer the mixture to an ice-cold electrode
cuvette.
2. Electroporate using the following settings: 200 Ω, 1.8 kV, and
25 μF.
3. Recover the cells immediately using 37 C pre-warmed 1 mL
SOC medium, and add them to 23 mL pre-warmed SOC
medium. Wash again using 1 mL SOC medium to recover
the rest.
4. Let the bacteria recover by incubating at 37 C for 30 min
under 200 rpm shaking.
5. After exactly 30 min, titrate the number of electroporated
bacteria by making serial dilutions of bacteria and spotting
them on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/mL carbenicillin
as selection marker. Incubate at 37 C overnight.
6. Transfer the incubated culture to 500 mL 2xYT media supple-
mented with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin and 30 μg/mL kanamy-
cin. Incubate overnight at 37 C.
7. Count the number of bacterial colonies from the titration in
step 5. Calculate how many electroporated bacteria in total
(i.e., in the total of 25 mL of medium) that survived the growth
in the presence of carbenicillin and thus were successfully
transformed with the phagemid (see Note 5). The transforma-
tion efﬁciency provides an upper limit of the library diversity.
For a ProP-PD library, we aim for 100–1000 times more
transformants than the size of the library design to ensure a
good coverage of the library design in the physically generated
phage library.
8. Pellet the bacteria from step 6 by centrifugation at 8500  g
and 4 C for 10 min.
9. Add the supernatant to a fresh tube containing 1/5 PEG/-
NaCl of the ﬁnal volume. Incubate on ice for 5 min.
10. Precipitate phages by centrifugation at 16,000  g and 4 C for
20 min (see Note 6).
11. Dissolve the phage pellet in 20 mL of PBS containing 0.05%
Tween-20 and 0.2% BSA.
12. Remove insoluble matter by centrifugation at 27,000  g for
20 min. Transfer to a fresh tube and repeat if the solution is still
turbid.
Screening the Intrinsically DIsordered Regions

13. Measure OD268 for the dissolved phages to estimate the phage
concentration (see Note 7).
14. To estimate the phage concentration more accurately, serially
dilute the phages, and add them to log-phase E. coli OmniMax
cells. Incubate for 30 min at 37 C for infection, and plate them
on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/mL carbenicillin as selec-
tion marker (see Note 5).
15. The phage library can be saved at 80 C for long-term storage
after addition of 10% glycerol. The library can be used directly
or reampliﬁed before use as described elsewhere [26].
3.2
High-Throughput
Expression
and Puriﬁcation of Bait
Proteins
The ProP-PD protocol described here is for high-throughput selec-
tions, which can be performed for hundreds of proteins in parallel
(Fig.
3).
Bait
proteins
can
be
puriﬁed
following
regular
low-throughput protocols and then arrayed before the experiment
or be expressed and puriﬁed following the 96-well format HTP
protocol outlined here. About 100 μg of protein is needed for one
full selection (without replicates), which can be puriﬁed from as
little as 2–4 mL of bacterial cultures, although we recommend to
perform replicate selections. Typically, we use His-MBP or
His-GST tagged bait proteins, expressed from the pETM-33 or
pETM-41 vectors as well as His-MBP and His-GST alone as con-
trols. The HTP protein expression and puriﬁcation protocol is a
modiﬁed version of the protocol described by Huang and
Sidhu [22].
3.2.1
Protein Expression
1. Transform the vectors (pETM-33 or pETM-41) encoding the
bait proteins into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and plate them on
LB agar plates containing 30 μg/mL kanamycin. Incubate at
37 C overnight.
2. The following day, refresh the growth of bacteria by inoculat-
ing them in 300 μL 2YT media 96-well in a mini tube system
(or in a 96-deep-well plate) supplemented with 30 μg/mL
kanamycin. Incubate at 37 C with 200 rpm shaking for 16 h.
3. Prepare two 96-deep-well plates by adding 1.2 mL autoindu-
cing MagicMedia containing 30 μg/mL kanamycin. Inoculate
each well with 10 μL of overnight culture (see Note 8).
4. Let the bacteria grow for 6 h at 37 C with 200 rpm shaking.
Lower the temperature to 25 C and let the protein expression
proceed for 20 h.
5. Pool the cultures of each protein from both plates together,
and collect pellet of bacteria by centrifuging at 2000  g for
20 min.
6. At this stage, bacterial pellets can be stored at 80 C.

3.2.2
Protein Puriﬁcation
1. Thaw the pellets on ice, and resuspend them by adding 250 μL
of resuspension buffer to each well and gently pipetting up and
down. It is recommended to save 5 μL of suspension in a
96-well PCR plate in 25 C to allow for conﬁrmation of the
identity of the expressed proteins through sequencing if
needed (see Note 9).
2. To lyse cells, add 750 μL of lysis buffer into the suspension; mix
and incubate it for 45 min on 4 C with gentle shaking.
3. To separate the debris, centrifuge plates at 2500  g for 30 min
and 4 C. Save 10 μL of lysates to allow for analysis of expres-
sion levels.
4. Transfer approximately 850 μL of the lysates into 25 μm
membrane-ﬁlter bottom plates containing 100 μL of resus-
pended Ni Sepharose. The lower end of the plate is sealed
using three layers of paraﬁlm, and the top is sealed using
adhesive aluminum foil (see Note 10).
5. Let the proteins bind for 2 h at 4 C and with gentle shaking.

BL21(DE3). The transformed bacteria are arrayed in the plate. Proteins are expressed in 96-well format and
puriﬁed using suitable resin in 96-well ﬁlter bottom plates and a vacuum manifold and eluted in a nonbinding
plate

6. Fit the ﬁlter plate into a plate vacuum manifold, and remove
lysate by applying vacuum for few seconds.
7. Wash the beads three times each by adding 1 mL of washing
buffer and applying vacuum.
8. To elute the bound proteins, seal the bottom of the plate, add
200 μL elution buffer, mix and incubate for 5 min at RT. Elute
proteins into nonbinding 96-well plate using the vacuum
manifold.
9. Analyze the purity of the proteins using SDS-PAGE, and quan-
tify the amount of each protein using Bradford assay.
10. Use the proteins directly as baits for phage selections (pre-
ferred), or add 10–15% glycerol, and store them at 80 C
until further use.
3.3
HTP ProP-PD
Selection and Pooled
Phage ELISA
The ProP-PD protocol described here is based on the lower-
throughput protocol described in our original method paper [16]
and a HTP phage display protocol described elsewhere [22]. We
recommend to perform replicate selections where the bait proteins
are arrayed according to different layouts. To avoid that phages are
selected based on nonspeciﬁc binding to the plate or to the
MBP/GST tags, phage pools are ﬁrst incubated with immobilized
negative controls (GST, MBP, or similar) before being transferred
to the bait proteins. The ﬁnal day of selection (day 4), we typically
immobilize proteins for phage pool ELISA, which is then per-
formed the following day. Phage pool ELISA is a way to evaluate
the outcome of the selection (described in Subheading 3.3.2).
Typically,
the
enrichment
of
binding
phage
saturates
after
3–4 days of selection, which means that the full protocol can be
performed in a week.
3.3.1
Phage Display
Selection
Day 0:
1. Coat the plates with bait proteins and negative controls by
adding 10–20 μg of proteins in 100 μL of PBS to a 96-well
MaxiSorp plate. Cover the plates with adhesive plastic sealing,
and incubate overnight at 4 C with shaking (see Note 11).
2. Inoculate a freshly streaked single colony of E. coli OmniMax
from a LB agar plate (tetracycline) in 5 mL 2YT medium
supplemented with 10 μg/mL tetracycline. Incubate overnight
at 37 C with 200 rpm shaking. This bacterial culture is then
used to start novel cultures throughout the selection days.
Day 1:
3. Remove the protein solutions from the MaxiSorp plates. Block
the wells by adding 200 μL of blocking solution to each well,
and incubate for 1 h at 4 C under gentle agitation.
542
Muhammad Ali et al.

4. Inoculate 15 μL of the overnight culture of E. coli OmniMax
into three separate 50 mL tubes containing 15 mL 2YT sup-
plemented with 30 μg/mL kanamycin, 100 μg/mL carbenicil-
lin, or 10 μg/mL tetracycline. Incubate at 37 C with 200 rpm
shaking (see Note 12).
5. To prepare the phage library for selection, dilute the appropri-
ate volume of the phage library 20 times with PBS, and add
PEG/NaCl to 1/5 of the ﬁnal volume (see Note 13). Incubate
on ice for 10 min, and precipitate the phages by centrifuging
for 10 min at 14,000  g. Remove the supernatant and spin the
tube again for 2 min at 2000  g. Aspirate the residual super-
natant. Resuspend the phage pellet in appropriate volume of
PT buffer.
6. After 1 h, remove the blocking solution from the preselection
wells.
7. Add 100 μL phage library to each preselection well. Incubate
for 1 h at 4 C while shaking. Nonspeciﬁc phages will bind to
the controls, and they are thus removed at this step.
8. Remove the blocking solution from the bait protein-coated
wells, and wash them four times with 200 μL PBST buffer.
Transfer the phage library from the control wells to the bait
wells. Allow the phages to bind for 2 h at 4 C while shaking
(see Note 14).
9. After the incubation, remove unbound phages, and wash the
wells four times with PBST buffer.
10. To elute the bound phages, add 100 μL of the log-phase E. coli
OmniMax culture to each well. Cover the plate with gas per-
meable sealing, and incubate at 37 C for 30 min under agita-
tion (see Note 15).
11. During this incubation, a titer can be made of the phage library
used as in-phage by serially diluting the library in 2YT media
and then adding 5 μL of it to 45 μL of log-phase E. coli
OmniMax. Allow the phage to infect the bacteria for 30 min
at 37 C and then spot 5 μL from each dilution onto LB agar
plate supplemented with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin. Incubate
plates overnight at 37 C, and then count colonies to calculate
the “in-phage” number the following day (see Note 5).
12. After the 30 min elution, withdraw 5 μL of the bacterial
solution for titer of the number of eluted phage (out-phage).
Add 10 μL M13KO7 helper phages (1011 pfu/mL) to each
well. Incubate the plates again for 45 min at 37 C.
13. During this incubation, execute the out-phage titration using
2YT, and plate them on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/
mL carbenicillin to calculate the “out-phage” numbers the
following day.
Screening the Intrinsically DIsordered Regions
543

14. After 45 min of incubation, transfer the growing bacteria
cultures into 1 mL 2YT media supplemented with 30 μg/mL
kanamycin, 100 μg/mL carbenicillin, and 0.3 mM IPTG, and
incubate at 37 C overnight with 200 rpm shaking.
Day 2–4:
Repeat the phage selection for 4 days. The protocol is same as
for day 1 but using harvested out-phage from the previous day
instead of the phage library.
15. To harvest the phages from the previous day of selection,
pellet the bacteria by centrifugation at 2000  g for 25 min.
Aspirate carefully 800 μL of phage supernatant from each
well, and transfer it to a fresh 96-deep-well plate. Heat inacti-
vate remaining bacteria at 65 C for 20 min. Let the plate cool
down by placing it on ice for 5–10 min. Readjust the pH by
addition of 88 μL 10 PBS. Use 100 μL of the out-phage as
in-phage for the next day of selection.
16. Withdraw 100 μL of out-phage from each well and place into
a 96-well PCR plate. Store in 20 C freezer.
3.3.2
Phage Pool ELISA
(Day 5)
Phage pool ELISA is used to determine if phage selection against a
particular protein has been successful, i.e., the ratio of bait protein
ELISA signal to that of control has increased over the days of
selection. We recommend to perform the ELISA directly after the
ﬁnished phage display experiment and to start the experiment day
4 of the phage display experiment.
1. Immobilize 5–10 μg of bait and control proteins in 100 μL of
PBS per well per selection day. Importantly, immobilize the
negative control (GST/MBP) on the same plate as the bait
protein to ensure that the signals are comparable. Incubate at
4 C with shaking for 16 h.
2. Remove the protein solution, and block wells by adding 200 μL
blocking solution to each well. Incubate for 1 h at 4 C with
shaking.
3. Remove the blocking solution, and wash each well four times
using 200 μL PBST buffer.
4. After washing, add 100 μL ampliﬁed out-phage from each day
of selection to the bait and control wells. Incubate for 2 h at
4 C while shaking.
5. Remove the phage solution, and wash unbound phage particles
using ﬁve times 200 μL PBST buffer.
6. Add 100 μL anti-M13 HRP-conjugate antibody diluted 5000
times in blocking solution. Incubate for 30 min at RT.
544
Muhammad Ali et al.

7. Wash away unbound antibody using four times 200 μL PBST.
Wash one last time using 200 μL of PBS. Make sure to remove
all the liquid by tapping the plate on a paper.
8. To develop, add 100 μL mixed TMB substrate to each well, and
develop until blue color occurs (see Note 16).
9. Stop the reaction with 100 μL of 0.6 M H2SO4. This will turn
the blue color into yellow.
10. Record absorbance of each well at 450 nm. Calculate the ratio
between the A450 measured for the bait protein and that of the
negative control. A ratio of more than 2 is indicative of a
successful selection.
3.4
Preparing
Samples for NGS
Phage pools from successful selections are used as templates for the
generation of amplicons for analysis through NGS using Illumina
MiSeq.
3.4.1
Barcoding
and Ampliﬁcation
The ﬁrst step is to amplify the DNA region encoding the peptides
displayed on the P8 protein. The NGS-grade primers used for the
ampliﬁcation should be designed to contain Illumina adapters and
unique barcodes (short oligonucleotide sequences). We use a bar-
coding strategy previously outlined by McLaughlin and Sidhu [25],
but NGS facilities can typically provide advices on how to design
barcodes and adaptors. The steps recommended for the ampliﬁca-
tion and barcoding are outlined below.
1. Array sequencing primers in a 96-well PCR plate to match the
number of phage pools to be sequenced from the high-
throughput selection. Ensure that each pool will get a unique
combination of barcodes so that they can be identiﬁed after
sequencing.
2. Mix 0.5 μM of each primer, 2.5 μL phage pool, and H2O to a
volume of 12.5 μL. Add 12.5 μL of Phusion HF master mix,
and put the mixture directly into a preheated thermocycler
(98 C).
3. Denature the phage particles at 98 C for 3 min. Then amplify
the peptide-coding region for 20 cycle of (a) denaturation at
98 C for 10 s, (b) annealing at 68 C for 10 s, and (c) ampliﬁ-
cation at 72 C for 12 s. Add a ﬁnal extension step at 72 C for
5 min.
4. Directly after ﬁnishing the program, remove the PCR plate,
withdraw 1 μL of the reaction for analysis through agarose gel
electrophoresis, and put the plate at 20 C.
5. Analyze the ampliﬁed products using 2% agarose gel electro-
phoresis to verify the correct size of the generated amplicons.
Screening the Intrinsically DIsordered Regions

3.4.2
Normalization,
Pooling, and Cleaning
of Ampliﬁed Products
After the peptide-coding regions of the binding enriched phage
pools for each bait protein have been PCR ampliﬁed and barcoded,
the resulting amplicons are pooled together into a library for
sequencing. We pool in the order of 500 amplicons into 1 library
for MiSeq NGS analysis. Since there can be biases during the
ampliﬁcation of the templates from different phage pools, it is
recommended to normalize the amplicons before pooling. The
protocol detailed below uses Mag-Bind magnetic beads for the
normalization, but there are other products that would work
equally well.
Normalization of Samples
1. Draw 20 μL of magnetic bead slurry and 20 μL of PCR product
from each well, and combine them into a 96-well PCR plate.
Mix gently by pipetting 15–20 times.
2. Incubate at RT for 5 min.
3. Place the plate on magnetic stand, and wait until solution
becomes clear of any beads.
4. Aspirate the supernatant, and wash the beads by adding 200 μL
of 70% ethanol on the pellet, while the plate remains on mag-
netic stand.
5. Aspirate the ethanol and repeat two more times.
6. Remove the 96-well plate from the magnetic stand, and let air
dry until the bead pellets crack (10–20 min).
7. Elute the bound DNA. Carefully add 12.5 μL of EB buffer
QIAquick PCR puriﬁcation kit to each magnetic bead pellet,
and gently pipette up and down until the pellets have dissolved.
Put the 96-well PCR plate on the magnetic stand.
Pooling and Cleaning
1. Pool 10 μL of eluate from each well of the 96-well plate into an
1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Clear the solution of any beads left
using the magnetic stand, and transfer the solution to a fresh
1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
2. Use QIAquick PCR puriﬁcation kit to concentrate 50% of the
amplicon pool by following the manufacturer’s guidelines.
Store the rest as a backup. Elute in 50 μL of EB buffer from
the QIAquick PCR puriﬁcation kit.
3. The PCR ampliﬁcation of the peptide-coding region can result
in some nonspeciﬁc products of different lengths. We therefore
purify the desired products using agarose gel electrophoreses.
For this purpose, electrophorese the pooled amplicons along-
side a 50 bp ladder using a 2% agarose gel. Carefully excise the
right-sized band. Use the QIAquick gel extraction kit protocol
with the following modiﬁcations to purify the pooled ampli-
cons from the gel: do not heat up the gel in QG buffer or
546
Muhammad Ali et al.

vortex the sample as part of dissolving the gel slice as this can
result in degradation of small DNA fragments.
4. Elute the product in 30 μL of TE buffer.
5. Quantify the dsDNA concentration using PicoGreen, as
described in Subheading 3.1.2.
6. Provide the requested amount and documentation to the NGS
facility.
3.5
NGS Data
Handling
Depending on the length of the designed library oligonucleotides,
sequencing can be done as single reads or read pairs. With our
aforementioned design [16], a 1  150 bases read length is sufﬁ-
cient to account for the length of the library oligonucleotide plus
the constant regions and barcodes. After NGS, sequences will be
matched to the library design to identify the selected ligands. Given
the complexity and amount of data generated by high-throughput
ProP-PD, a data management plan is advised. Collecting all experi-
mental information, consistent ﬁle naming, and anticipating a long-
term storing solution for raw data ﬁles are key points in such a plan.
3.5.1
NGS Data
Demultiplexing
and Cleanup
The
MiSeq
NGS
analysis
returns
18–22
million
reads
corresponding to all the pooled (multiplexed) samples. Depending
on the NGS service used, reads can be delivered in different ﬁle
formats, either as a single ﬁle containing all the reads or as multiple
already demultiplexed ﬁles. In our case, we request the information
as a single .fastq.gz compressed ﬁle, which we then clean up and
demultiplex into separated .fasta ﬁles, one for each of the 500–600
reactions, by using in-house developed python scripts (Fig. 4).
Brieﬂy, we discard reads with low average quality scores (20)
and reads for which the barcodes cannot be unambiguously deter-
mined (allowing a maximum of 1 mismatch per barcode); this
accounts for ~1% and ~30% and of the reads, respectively. After
demultiplexing the reads, we trim the adapter and barcode
sequences and count the number of times each oligonucleotide
was found. Finally, oligonucleotides are translated to amino acid
sequences, and peptides are matched to the library design. Peptides
with unexpected lengths or sequences are discarded. In the end,
~50% of the initial NGS reads are preserved.
3.5.2
Data Analysis
and Storage
The generated information for each bait protein is compiled in a
table, including which peptides were identiﬁed, the counts of each
peptide, and what protein they belong to. NGS results vary
depending on the bait, the library, the selection day, etc. On aver-
age for one bait protein and one selection, approximately 500 dif-
ferent unique peptides are retrieved, with NGS counts from 1 up to
10,000. The low-count peptides are generally background noise,
while the true binders are found among the enriched peptides
(unique peptides with high counts, see Fig. 4). Successful selections
Screening the Intrinsically DIsordered Regions
547

Fig. 4 (a) Overview of data analysis and processing. Illumina MiSeq analysis of binding-enriched phage pools
returns about 18 million sequences. The summary table of barcodes and templates used, together with
barcode information, is used to demultiplex the data. The information is translated into peptide sequences and
matched against the library design, resulting in annotated peptides. Replicate selections are combined for
analysis of the reproducibility of the selections. Throughout the process, care should be taken to archive the
raw data for longer-term storage, while making sure that the processed data can be accessed easily for
further analysis. (b) Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data processing. The raw sequencing data is provided
by the NGS service as a .fastq.gz compressed ﬁle. Each sequence in this ﬁle format comprises four lines: a
name (orange), the sequence (green, with the barcode and constant regions in purple), a line with extra
information that starts with a “+” sign, and the per-base quality scores for the sequence (light blue). Raw data
548
Muhammad Ali et al.

are identiﬁed by the presence of highly enriched binding peptides
that are found in the replicate selections. Common features like the
presence of motifs among the enriched peptides can then be iden-
tiﬁed using tools such as MEME [27]. When using relatively small
libraries (e.g., 100,000 sequences), the reproducibility in terms of
enriched sequences is expected to be high (see Note 17).
The importance of data preservation, both for reanalysis and
future sharing and publication, makes it important to develop a
data management plan. This is especially true considering the
amount of data generated by NGS. A data structure with unambig-
uous ﬁle naming should be established. We recommend to archive
the raw NGS .fastq.gz ﬁles for long-term storage together with
tables containing all experimental information (bait protein, phage
library, phage ELISA results, and barcodes used for each selection),
while the .fasta and other table ﬁles can be kept in a regular ﬁle-
sharing system for fast and easy accession (Fig. 4a).

Notes
1. Start with few colonies as some of them might not be able to
grow. Carbenicillin is recommended as an alternative to ampi-
cillin as it allows less satellite colonies to grow.
2. A single well-deﬁned DNA band is usually visible with chances
of
higher
faint
bands
representing
possible
secondary
structures.
3. If the enzyme, like Phusion, has high processing and proof-
reading qualities, hot start will make sure that it does not
degrade the single-stranded oligonucleotide library used as
template. The numbers of cycles are kept low to avoid introdu-
cing PCR bias.

Fig. 4 (continued) is processed (sequences are demultiplexed, removing those with low average quality and
trimming their barcodes and constant regions) and turned into .fasta ﬁles. Afterward, a table is built by
translating the DNA sequences into amino acids and determining their peptide counts. Finally, each peptide is

and the different replica results are combined (Rep_1 to 3 in the ﬁgure) for comparison. This schematic
illustrates one possible way of processing NGS data. (c) Hundreds of unique peptides are typically found for

4. Follow the guidelines of the commercial provider to adjust the
amount and time used for the restriction. Typically, less than
20% wild-type template will be left after Kunkel reaction. The
step can be omitted.
5. Make a cell titer, for example, by serially diluting 5 μL of cells
into 45 μL of media for 12 dilutions, and then spot 5 μL out of
each dilution on LB agar plate containing corresponding resis-
tance marker. Grow overnight at 37 C. Next day, count colo-
nies from a dilution where they are visibly well separated. Back
calculate the total number of cells by multiplying colony count
with dilution factor.
6. Respin the precipitate for 2 min to remove the residual super-
natant completely, and pipette it out carefully.
7. Assume that OD268 ¼ 1 is equivalent to 5  1012 phage
particles/mL.
8. For most proteins, 1 mL expression media is enough, but
3–4 mL media can be used if needed. Express them in multiple
plates.
9. During HTP processing of proteins, samples can be mixed up
at any stage of expression or puriﬁcation. In case of doubt, the
saved bacterial cultures can be used to conﬁrm the identity of
the expressed protein. Other potential quality measures could
include MS analysis of the puriﬁed bait proteins.
10. Before adding lysates, check if ﬁlters are ok by applying vac-
uum. After adding lysates, seal the whole assembly together
using rubber bands or similar.
11. If performing duplicate selections, it is recommended to
change the way the proteins are arrayed.
12. The culture with kanamycin is used to check for helper phage
preinfection, while the culture with carbenicillin is used for
library phage control. There should be no growth in these
two tubes.
13. Each bait protein should be exposed to 1000 times more phage
particles than the size of library design.
14. Make sure the bacteria are growing and will reach the log phase
when the 2 h incubation is over. If you ﬁnd that the culture is
overgrown, dilute it down to OD600 of 0.3, and allow it to
regrow to an OD600 of 0.8.
15. Before eluting, streak some of the E. coli OmniMax culture
onto LB agar plates supplemented with carbenicillin, kanamy-
cin, and tetracycline to check for cross-contamination.
16. Shake the plate while developing. It can take from a few sec-
onds up to 10 min. Do not overdevelop the color, as the

dynamic range is limited and this will falsely decrease the ratio
between the bait and the negative control.
17. If the reproducibility is low, it might indicate that selections
have been cross-contaminated or that there has been a mix up
of barcodes. It is then recommended to repeat the selection in
duplicate.

Probing IDP Interactions with Membranes by Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
Diana Acosta, Tapojyoti Das, and David Eliezer
Abstract
The microtubule-associated protein tau has been extensively studied as a culprit in Alzheimer’s disease and
other neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. Challenges in structurally deﬁning tau protein
emerge from its disordered nature, which makes it difﬁcult to crystallize, and hinder efforts to interpret tau
protein’s true function. The complexity of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) necessitates a multiface-
ted approach to study their interactions including multiple spectroscopic methods that can report on local
protein environment and structure at individual residue positions. We and others have shown that in
addition to binding to microtubules, tau binds to lipid membranes. Tau-membrane interactions may be
relevant both to normal tau function and to tau aggregation and pathology. Here we describe the use of
ﬂuorescence spectroscopy as a probe of protein-membrane interactions to determine whether there is an
interaction, which residues participate, and the extent/nature of the interface between the protein and the
membrane. We provide a protocol for how the membrane interactions of tau protein, as an example, can be
probed by ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, including details of how the samples should be prepared and guide-
lines on how to interpret the results.

Introduction
1.1
Tau: An
Intrinsically
Disordered Protein
Physiologically, tau function has been deﬁned by its ability to bind,
stabilize, and promote formation of microtubules [1–3]. Patholog-
ically, tau is capable of forming ﬁbrillar aggregates that are depos-
ited within neuroﬁbrillary tangles and are correlated with cognitive
decline [2, 4]. Tau is composed of an amino-terminal domain
(N-terminus), a microtubule-binding domain (MBD), and a
carboxy-terminal domain (C-terminus). The microtubule-binding
domain consists of four imperfect tandem repeats, 31–32 residue in
length. Full-length human tau (Htau40) is the longest tau isoform,
while smaller tau isoforms are derived by alternative splicing of two

N-terminal inserts (generating 0–2 N tau) and of the microtubule-
binding domain’s second repeat region (generating 3R or 4R tau),
resulting in isoforms ranging in length from 352 to 441 amino acid
residues.
1.2
Tau-Membrane
Interactions
Evidence suggests that tau’s N-terminal domain associates with the
plasma membrane, which is important for establishing cell polarity
during neuronal development [5]. The tau MBD also binds to
membranes directly [6–9], via formation of short amphipathic heli-
ces in tau’s repeat regions. These helices appear to promote the
formation of oligomeric tau/lipid complexes [6, 10]. Thus,
tau-membrane interactions can regulate tau structure, function,
and toxicity. The MBD has been extensively studied due to its afﬁnity
for microtubules (MTs) but also because it contains two 6-residue
segments, PHF6 (306–311) and PHF6∗(275–280), which can
nucleate tau aggregation [11–13]. Formation of helical structure
within the MBD when bound to membranes [7] or heterodimeric
tubulin [14] suggests that structural disorder-to-order transitions in
speciﬁc tau regions may mediate tau physiological interactions. Here
we describe the use of lipid vesicles in combination with ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy to study tau-membrane interactions.
1.3
Application
of Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
for Probing
Tau-Membrane
Interactions
Fluorescence spectroscopy can be a relatively simple and efﬁcient
optical technique for probing membrane interactions of IDPs. The
ﬂuorescence of many ﬂuorophores, such as acrylodan and trypto-
phan, is sensitive to their local environment and undergoes a blue
shift in a hydrophobic setting such as the interior of a lipid bilayer.
This property is useful to probe membrane interactions of individ-
ual residues of an IDP. Recently, ﬂuorescence approaches have been
used to probe the interactions of tau with tubulin [14], and we have
used it as described below to probe tau-membrane interactions.
Additional techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) can also be used to
study proteins bound to lipid vesicles. ESR requires introduction
of spin labels containing unpaired electrons into protein samples,
which is typically accomplished using cysteine chemistry. It can be
used both to probe the environment of individual spin labels placed
at different positions within a protein and for measurements of
inter-residue distances for proteins containing two (or more) spin
labels [15]. While we have used ESR to study tau-membrane inter-
actions [7], the methods and protocols involved are beyond the
scope of this current chapter. Solution-state NMR spectroscopy
requires isotopically labeled protein to resolve structural features
of protein in solution. NMR has been used to provide insight into
the effects of membrane interactions on structural characteristics of
tau such as secondary structure formation. We describe our proto-
cols for the use of NMR to probe how disordered proteins bind to
lipid membranes in a subsequent chapter.

Protein Expression
and Puriﬁcation
3.1.1
1 L Growth
of Unlabeled Tau Protein
1. Combine 10 μL (OD600 ~ 0.4) of fresh BL21/DE3 cells with
1 μL (10–40 ng/μL) of designated plasmid (e.g., coding for
TK16) for transformation. Mix well, and place cells on ice for
5 min. Heat shock cells at 42 C on a block heater for 45 s, and
place on ice immediately for 2 min. Plate cells on LB-amp agar
plates with Amp (50 mg/mL), and incubate at 37
C
overnight.
2. The following day, pick 1 colony, and grow in 4 mL LB media
with 4 μL of Amp stock for 3 h in a shaker set at 37 C (see Note
4).
3. Add 500 μL of Amp stock to 1 L LB media. Use the 4 mL
culture to inoculate 100 mL of LB media with Amp, and
incubate in a shaker at 37 C overnight.
4. Use the 100 mL overnight culture to inoculate the remaining
900 mL of LB media with Amp, and incubate in a shaker set at
37 C for 4 h. Monitor growth closely by measuring OD600
using
a
UV-Vis
spectrophotometer
every
hour.
When
OD600 ¼ 0.6 (~1 h after inoculation), induce overexpression
by adding 1 mL of 0.8 M IPTG to 1 L growth for ﬁnal
concentration of 0.8 mM IPTG, and continue to monitor.
Once growth stagnates (~3 h after induction with IPTG) and
OD600 is between 1.2 and 1.8, centrifuge the 1 L culture at
10,000  g for 15 min at 4 C (see Notes 5 and 6). Discard the
supernatant, and collect the cell pellet, and store at 20 C
until use for puriﬁcation.

1. Thaw bacterial pellet at room temperature and resuspend in
50 mL Lysis buffer.
2. Lyse the cells by sonicating for 12 min on ice (6 min  2,
stirring in between) until the solution becomes less opaque.

3. Centrifuge the sonicated pellet for 1 h at 40,000 rpm in a
Beckman ultracentrifuge using a Ti 50.2 rotor (approx.
145,000g).
4. Collect the supernatant, and dialyze once against 1 L FPLC
dialysis buffer with a 3.5 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane; leave
overnight.
5. The following day, purify the supernatant by cation-exchange
chromatography and a NaCl gradient. Equilibrate a HiPrep FF
16/10 CM Sepharose™column with two column volumes

Site-Directed
Mutagenesis
Site-speciﬁc mutations are required for acrylodan and tryptophan
experiments and are introduced by a site-directed mutagenesis kit,
as directed by the manufacturer. For acrylodan ﬂuorescence, single
cysteine mutations should be introduced to sites being probed for
membrane interaction (see Note 8). For tryptophan ﬂuorescence,
site-directed mutagenesis will be needed to introduce tryptophan
mutations at speciﬁc sites of tau. Full-length tau contains no native
tryptophan mutations. After cysteine and tryptophan mutant con-
structs have been conﬁrmed by sequencing, the resulting plasmid
can be used for growth and puriﬁcation of tau as described above.
3.2
SUV Lipid Vesicle
Preparation
Lipid vesicles can be composed of varying lipid mixtures. For the
experimental techniques described below, we have used POPC/
POPS SUV lipid vesicles at a 1:1 molar ratio. The user is free to use
a lipid composition that best suits their experimental needs. Prepa-
ration of our SUV lipid vesicles is as follows:
1. From stock solutions in chloroform, POPC and POPS lipid
volumes are combined in a 16  100 mm borosilicate glass
tube based on a molar ratio of POPC/POPS ¼ 1:1 (see Note
9). For our ﬂuorescence assays, typical volumes of 1–2 mL
are made.
2. Dry the lipid mixture by ﬂowing an inert gas over it (N2 or Ar)
for 10–15 min.
3. Dry the lipid ﬁlm further using a vacuum concentrator for
1–2 h.
4. Resuspend the dried lipid ﬁlm in the designated buffer (acry-
lodan buffer or tryptophan buffer), and vortex until the lipid
ﬁlm has been completely resuspended. The lipid ﬁlm is
completely resuspended if there is no residue remaining on
the glass surface and the solution has become a milky
suspension.
5. Measure the pH of the suspension and adjust it to the experi-
mental conditions if necessary.
6. Sonicate the lipid solution in a bath sonicator until clear
(~10–30 min). It is advisable to put the tube at appropriate
depth (top of solution should be below the sonicator water
level) and at an appropriate position (at an antinode in the
standing waves produced by the bath sonicator) (see Note
10). This sonication method typically yields SUVs that are
30–50 nm in diameter.

7. Ultracentrifuge the clariﬁed lipids at 60,000 rpm for 1 h. We
use
a
Sorvall
RC-M120
EX
ultracentrifuge
using
a
S120AT2–0182 rotor (approx. 150,000  g) at 4 C to remove
any remaining multilamellar or larger vesicles.
8. Carefully remove and store the supernatant as the ﬁnal lipid
sample used for experiments, and discard the pellet. Lipid
concentration can be veriﬁed afterward by phosphate assays
[16], and lipid size distribution can be quantiﬁed by dynamic
light scattering or directly visualized and measured by electron
microscopy (see Note 11).
3.3
Acrylodan
Fluorescence
For both acrylodan ﬂuorescence and tryptophan ﬂuorescence, the
procedures below are being described for one tau mutant (one
residue position). The procedures should be repeated for each tau
mutant being probed if multiple residue-speciﬁc interactions are
being studied across regions of tau. If set up correctly, a single
96-well plate can hold up to 24 mutants (including appropriate
blanks), allowing 24 residues to be probed for membrane interac-
tions at one time (Fig. 1).
1. Resuspend the protein in puriﬁcation buffer at a concentration
of 600 μM and a volume of 1.3 mL, and leave at room temper-
ature for 15–30 min.
2. Filter through a 100 kDa centrifugal spin column at 4000 rpm
on a benchtop centrifuge at 4 C for 15 min or until completely
run through.
3. Equilibrate the PD-10 column with labeling buffer for 5 CVs.
4. Buffer exchange the protein into labeling buffer in the follow-
ing way: add ~1.3 mL of sample to the PD-10 column in two
parts of 650 μL. Add 600 μL of labeling buffer twice to the
PD-10 column. Add 750 μL of labeling buffer twice, and collect
protein from elution. Add 500 μL of labeling buffer six times.
5. Add 10 μL of 50 mM acrylodan eight times (total 80 μL) to the
protein in labeling buffer gradually, while inverting the tube
several times to mix well in between each addition, and cover
sample in foil.
6. Place the sample in rotator for 4 h.
7. To remove residual acrylodan, spin down the sample for 5 min
at 14,000 rpm (18,000  g). We use a Beckman Microfuge
18 centrifuge.
8. Equilibrate a new PD-10 column with phosphate buffer for
5 CVs.
9. Buffer exchange labeled protein into phosphate buffer in the
following way: add 1.5 mL of sample to the PD-10 column in
two parts of 750 μL. Add 1 mL of phosphate buffer. Add
750 μL of phosphate buffer twice, and collect acrylodan-labeled
protein from elution. Add 500 μL of phosphate buffer six times.

Diana Acosta et al.

10. Make ~1:1500 (protein/lipid) molar ratio samples. For our
samples we typically use 20 μM of protein with 30 mM SUV
lipids.
11. Use phosphate buffer as a blank for free-state protein samples.
By subtracting the blank spectrum from spectra of protein-
containing samples, any ﬂuorescence or noise signal from the
buffer in the free-state protein sample will be removed, leaving
only the protein ﬂuorescence signal. A lipid sample containing
10 mM liposome in buffer without protein should be used as a
blank for bound-state protein samples to subtract any noise
signal emerging from lipid or buffer, leaving only the protein
ﬂuorescence signal.
12. Use a plate reader with excitation set to 390 nm: cutoff,
420 nm, and emission, 400–600 nm. Scan bound-state and
free-state protein as well as controls.
13. Export data to text ﬁle.
3.4
Tryptophan
Fluorescence
Unlike acrylodan ﬂuorescence, tryptophan ﬂuorescence does not
require extra labeling procedures. Instead, after site-directed muta-
genesis has successfully introduced tryptophan at speciﬁc sites,
tryptophan emission at 300–450 nm can be probed upon excitation
at 295 nm.
1. Make ~1:1500 (protein/lipid) molar ratio samples. For our
experiments we typically use 20 μM tau protein and 30 mM
POPC/POPS SUV lipids.

2. Use buffer as a blank for free-state protein samples. A lipid

used as a blank for bound-state protein samples.
3. Use a plate reader with excitation set to 295 nm: cutoff, none,

3.5
Data Analysis
The following data processing and evaluation can be used for both
acrylodan ﬂuorescence and tryptophan ﬂuorescence.
1. Data from the plate reader software can be imported into any
data processing platform (e.g., Microsoft Excel). Fluorescence
emission spectra from 300 to 450 nm (RFU vs. λ (nm)) should
show a peak around 355 nm for Trp-labeled free-state samples
and around 520 nm for acrylodan-labeled free-state samples.
Samples in the presence of lipid vesicles may show a shift in the
peak maximum toward lower wavelengths, reﬂecting insertion
of the ﬂuorophore into the membrane. Figure 2a, b shows
representative data for two tau TK16 Trp mutants.
2. The difference in maximum emission wavelength (Δλmax) for
free-state vs. bound-state is calculated. Δλmax results from a
change in the environment of the ﬂuorophore. Small values
of Δλmax indicate small differences in ﬂuorophore environment
in the presence of lipids, suggesting no membrane interaction
or insertion at this position. Larger values suggest membrane
interaction or insertion (see Note 12).
3. If
repeated
for
multiple
successive
residues,
a
plot
of
Δλmax vs. residue position can be constructed. Any periodicity
observed in such a plot may reﬂect a periodicity in the environ-
ment of successive residues in the targeted protein segment,
which may reﬂect, for example, the underlying periodicity of
secondary structure elements. For example, a periodicity of 3.6
would be consistent with an α-helix secondary structure. A
periodic function (Δλmax(n) ¼ a + b 
cos (2πn/N + c),
where N is the periodicity, a is the vertical shift, b is the
amplitude, and c is the horizontal shift of standard periodic
functions) can be ﬁt to the data in order to estimate the
periodicity across a given region, as shown in Fig. 2c.

Notes
1. Old LB-amp plates (stored for longer than 2 weeks, sealed, at
4 C) will lose their ampicillin efﬁciency over time. Therefore,
for plates being used for mutagenesis, it is best to use fresh
plates to avoid satellites colonies.
564
Diana Acosta et al.

2. Although we use an automated FPLC system, a manual gradi-
ent can be generated with a gradient former and used in line
with a weak cation-exchange column. However, all elutions
must be checked for protein with SDS-PAGE before pooling
elution samples for dialysis and HPLC.
3. Plate settings on the plate reader software should be carefully
matched to the plate the reader will be using. For our experi-
ments we use standard 96-well black polystyrene plates with ﬂat
bottoms and lids (Nunc™F96 MicroWell™).
4. After 3 h, 4 mL culture should no longer be a clear or transpar-
ent solution. A cloudy culture should be used to inoculate the
100 mL overnight culture. If the cultures are clear, leave the
culture in the incubator for longer (up to 5 h).
5. If expression remains low (OD600 less than 1.0) for 1 L growth
after 3 h (post-induction with IPTG), the growth should be
discarded. As an alternative, before inducing the 1 L growth
with IPTG, the incubator temperature should be set to a lower
temperature (18 C or 20 C), and then the growth can be
incubated in a shaker overnight.

6. If OD600 is decreasing during monitoring of growths, the
culture should be discarded and restarted with a new colony.
7. After washing the FPLC column with two CVs of FPLC
buffer A, all detector signals should be plateaued and stable.
If the detector signal features spikes or is drifting, buffer should
be passed through the column.
8. It is important to note that there are two native cysteines in
full-length tau (Htau40). Therefore, in addition to introducing
cysteine mutations at sites of interest, the native cysteines C291
and C322 should be changed (typically to alanine) to avoid
confounding results for residue-speciﬁc interactions.
9. The shape and size of tube used for sonicating lipid vesicles are
important for optimizing sonication efﬁciency. For example,
we speciﬁcally use 16  100 mm borosilicate glass tubes and
have found that using tubes with smaller diameters can lead to
longer sonication times and heterogeneous sonication. This is
due to the fact that the sonication power distribution is non-
uniform in a bath sonicator. So, for every sonicator used, one
should determine the right size of tube for optimal sonication
efﬁciency.
10. In our hands, lipid solutions become clear after sonication for
10–30 min. However, if lipids require longer sonication time,
then lipids should be allowed to cool on ice before continuing
sonication. Overheating of lipids should be avoided as this
leads to degradation.
11. Phospholipids get oxidized over time. So, it is important to use
fresh stocks of lipids to prepare vesicles and store the stock
properly sealed at 20 C. Lipid stocks lasts up to 6 months
stored in a glass container with a Teﬂon cap that is additionally
sealed with paraﬁlm and stored at 20 C.
12. It is important to keep in mind that introducing acrylodan or
tryptophan at any position may inﬂuence the protein structure
and interactions. Stabilization of transient secondary structures
in IDPs may constrain a labeled site to behave in a similar way
to the unmodiﬁed protein, but this is not guaranteed and must
be considered.

Protocol for Investigating the Interactions Between
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins and Membranes
by Neutron Reﬂectometry
Alessandra Luchini and Lise Arleth
Abstract
Several intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exhibit high afﬁnity for lipid membranes. Among the
different biophysical methods to probe protein-lipid interaction, neutron reﬂectometry (NR) can provide
direct and structural detailed information on the location of the IDP with respect to the membrane.
Supported lipid bilayers are commonly used as cell membrane models in such experiments. NR measure-
ments can be collected on the supported lipid bilayer before and after the interaction with the IDP to
characterize whether the protein molecules are mainly located on the membrane surface (interaction with
the lipid headgroups), are penetrating into the hydrophobic region of the membrane (interaction with the
lipid acyl chains), or are not interacting at all with the membrane. The lipid composition of the supported
lipid bilayer can easily be tuned; hence the NR experiments can be designed to investigate selective
IDP-lipid interactions.
This chapter will describe the fundamental steps for performing an NR experiment and the subsequent
data analysis aimed at characterizing IDP-lipid bilayer interactions. The speciﬁc case of an intrinsically
disordered region (IDR) from the membrane protein Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) will be used as
an example, but the same protocol can be easily adapted to other IDPs.

Introduction
Lipid membranes are relevant partners of interaction for intrinsi-
cally disordered proteins (IDPs) [1–3]. The biological impact of
such interactions is still poorly understood and will be built on a
detailed structural description of the location of the IDPs with
respect to the membrane [4]. In particular, a desirable information
is determining if the IDP molecules are interacting with the lipid
headgroups or if they can penetrate into the hydrophobic region of
the membrane and eventually cross it [5]. Besides locating the
interacting protein molecules, characterizing the effect of the IDP

on the overall membrane structure is an additional relevant infor-
mation for a full characterization of the system.
Among the different biophysical methods available to study
protein-lipid interactions, neutron reﬂection at solid/liquid inter-
face
offers
several
advantages
[6].
Neutron
reﬂectometry
(NR) allows for structural investigation of thin ﬁlms deposited on
a solid substrate in an aqueous environment with a few A˚ resolu-
tions. NR is a nondestructive technique, which can provide infor-
mation on both the composition and the thickness of the deposited
sample [7].
During an NR experiment aimed at investigating protein-lipid
interactions, supported lipid bilayers are commonly used as models
for cell membranes [8–10]. A supported lipid bilayer is composed
of a planar lipid bilayer in the proximity of a solid substrate such as a
silicon crystal. Supported lipid bilayers can be prepared with tun-
able lipid composition and have been widely exploited to investi-
gate lipid interactions with proteins or peptides by means of
different surface-sensitive techniques such as NR, quartz crystal
microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and ellipso-
metry [11–14]. Because neutrons are sensitive to the isotopic com-
position of the sample [15], NR can provide a detailed description
of both the hydrophilic (lipid headgroups) and hydrophobic (lipid
acyl chains) regions of the lipid bilayer in terms of their thickness
and solvation. Furthermore, as lipid and proteins can be distin-
guished during a neutron scattering experiment, this makes NR
the ideal technique for probing the interaction between IDPs and
supported lipid bilayers. NR can indeed provide the desired infor-
mation on the protein location in relation to the bilayer and at the
same time the overall membrane structure [5, 16]. Such informa-
tion is contained in the scattering length density proﬁle, ρ(z), which
is the main output of the NR data analysis. The scattering length
density quantiﬁes the interaction between the neutrons and the
different types of nuclei in the sample. In the case of NR, ρ(z)
provides the distribution of the different molecules in the sample
in the direction perpendicular to the substrate surface, z [6].
In this chapter, we describe how NR can be used to investigate
the interaction between an IDP and a lipid bilayer composed by
1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-glycero-phosphocholine (POPC). The chosen
IDP is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that is part of the
large intracellular domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform
1 [17, 18]. NHE1 is an ubiquitous membrane protein responsible
for the regulation of cellular pH and volume [19]. The IDR con-
stitutes the lipid interaction domain (LID) of NHE1 and is named
NHE1-LID in the following sections. The main goals of the NR
experiment are to (1) reveal the presence of an interaction between
the NHE1-LID and the POPC-supported lipid bilayer; (2) locate
the NHE1-LID molecules with respect to the membrane, i.e., if
they interact with the phospholipid headgroup or penetrate into
570

the hydrophobic region of the membrane; and (3) evaluate the
impact of the NHE1-LID-lipid interaction on the overall mem-
brane structure.
This chapter will focus on the relevant practical aspects of an
NR experiment aimed at the investigation of the interaction
between an IDP, i.e., NHE1-LID, and a supported lipid bilayer.
A detailed description of the NR technique and instrumentation
can be found elsewhere [7, 15, 20–22]. Although the speciﬁc case
of NHE1-LID will be used here for the method discussion, the
same experimental protocol can be easily adapted to other IDPs and
supported lipid bilayers with different lipid composition.

Methods
Sample preparation was performed at room temperature, while the
NR measurements were performed at 25 C. Injections of the
solutions in the NR solid/liquid cell [24] were performed either

by manual syringe injection or by using an HPLC pump. In partic-
ular, samples were injected manually with a syringe, while the
buffers or the ultrapure water used after sample deposition was
injected using the HPLC pump with a ﬂow rate of 2 mL/min.
Since the injected sample volume (~2 mL) is considerably smaller
than the injected buffer or ultrapure water volume (~20 mL), a
manual syringe injection is recommended for the sample, while the
HPLC pump can be used for the solvents. The experimental data
showed here were collected on the SURF reﬂectometer at the ISIS
Neutron and Muon Source in Didcot, UK.

NR Cell
and Substrate
Cleaning
1. Clean all the NR cell components that will be in contact with
the sample, e.g., O-ring and the sample injection tubes, with
2% Hellmanex solution (see Note 2) followed by extensive
rinsing with ultrapure water and ethanol (Fig. 1).
2. Prepare a diluted piranha solution for cleaning the silicon
substrate (see Note 3). The piranha solution, even in its diluted
form, is highly corrosive; hence take the relevant safety precau-
tions during preparation and handling. Immerse the silicon
substrate in the piranha solution at 80 C. After 15 min,
remove the substrate and rinse its surface extensively with
ultrapure water. Store the substrate under water to avoid con-
tamination of the cleaned surface.
3. Assemble the NR solid/liquid cell as reported in Fig. 1b and ﬁll
the cell with D2O. Collect a ﬁrst set of NR data for the sub-
strate in contact with D2O, and subsequently inject 20 mL of
H2O before collecting another dataset. The main purpose of
the NR measurements of the substrate in contact with D2O
and H2O is to characterize the silicon oxide layer, which is
present on the surface of the substrate, and to assess the overall
substrate quality (i.e., surface roughness). Silicon oxide spon-
taneously grows on the surface of silicon crystals exposed to air,
and it is characterized by a sufﬁciently different scattering
lengthdensitycomparedtopuresilicon(i.e.,ρ¼3.46∙106A˚ 2
and ρ ¼ 2.07 ∙106 A˚ 2, respectively). The difference in ρ
between the two components gives rise to a reﬂectivity signal.
3.2
POPC Vesicle
Suspension
The POPC-supported bilayer was prepared by vesicle fusion
[25]. Hence, the ﬁrst step to produce the POPC bilayer is prepar-
ing a vesicle suspension. Different protocols can be used for the
preparation of a vesicle suspension [26]. Here, the one based on the
redispersion and sonication of a POPC ﬁlm was used. As described
in Subheading 3.3, the vesicle size and lamellarity were controlled
by sonication with a tip sonicator. This later favors the formation of
small unilamellar vesicles (SUV).

1. Weigh 2 mg of POPC powder in a glass vial, and dissolve the
lipid with 0.25 mL of chloroform (see Note 4).
2. Dry the POPC chloroform suspension with a nitrogen ﬂow and
subsequently under vacuum, until a lipid ﬁlm is produced on
the bottom of the glass vial. If prepared in advance, the ﬁlm can
be stored at 80 C.
3. Resuspend the lipid ﬁlm with 2 mL h-buffer. Use a bath
sonicator for 30 min to ensure a homogeneous lipid suspen-
sion. The sample will contain POPC vesicles of variable sizes
and lamellarity and will appear turbid.
3.3
Formation
of the Supported Lipid
Bilayer
1. Sonicate the POPC vesicle suspension with a tip sonicator right
before injection into the NR cell (see Note 5). Typically, 5-min
sonication is sufﬁcient and the suspension will appear clearer.
The sonication of the solution will produce SUVs with a larger
tendency to adsorb and fuse on the hydrophilic substrate sur-
face than multilamellar vesicles.
2. Inject 2 mL of the POPC suspension into the NR cell. The
injection can be performed both manually with a syringe and
(if available) through a syringe pump, which will enable a
constant ﬂow rate (typically 0.5–1 mL/min) during sample
injection.

3. Wait 20–30 min to let the POPC vesicles adsorb on the silicon
substrate. Vesicle adsorption and rupture is a process that
might require several tens of minutes [27]. It is important to
incubate the substrate with the vesicles for a sufﬁciently long
time (~30 min) to obtain a high surface coverage. Other
surface-sensitive techniques such as QCM-D can be used to
evaluate the incubation time [28].
4. Inject ultrapure water into the cell to induce an osmotic shock
to favor vesicle rupture and the formation of the supported
lipid bilayer. Ten minutes of ultrapure water injection is typi-
cally sufﬁcient.
5. Reintroduce the buffer in the cell before data collection. The
strongest signal is produced when the lipid membrane is in
contact with d-buffer [29] (see Note 6). Hence, inject 20 mL
of d-buffer to guarantee an efﬁcient isotope exchange.
6. Collect the NR data in at least three different contrasts:
d-buffer
(ρ

smw-buffer
(ρ ¼ 2.07 ∙106 A˚ 2), and h-buffer (ρ ¼ 0.56 ∙106 A˚ 2)
(see Note 7). Use the HLPC pump for buffer injection. Typi-
cally, 20 mL of buffer is sufﬁcient to ensure a proper contrast
exchange. The collected experimental NR data in the case of
the POPC lipid bilayer are shown in Fig. 2a.

Interaction
Between NHE1-LID
and the POPC Lipid
Bilayer
1. Replace the buffer with ultrapure water prior to the injection of
the NHE1-LID solution. The NHE1-LID is particularly sen-
sitive to the presence of salt in the solution; hence to avoid
unwanted protein precipitation, ultrapure water is introduced
in the NR cell with the supported lipid bilayer prior to the
protein injection (see Note 8). 10-min injection of ultrapure
water is suitable for this purpose. Use the HLPC pump for the
water injection. Other protein buffers may apply to other pro-
tein systems.
2. Inject 2 mL of NHE1-LID solution. As for the POPC vesicle
suspension, the NHE1-LID solution can either be manually
injected with a syringe or a syringe pump can be used
(0.5–1 mL/min ﬂow rate).
3. Wait 30 min to let the NHE1-LID molecules interact with the
lipid membrane (see Note 9).
4. Remove the protein excess by injecting 10 mL ultrapure water
(see Note 10). Because of potential aggregation of the NHE1-
LID in the presence of salt, it is recommended to perform this
operation with ultrapure water; this will help avoiding unde-
sired protein aggregation and precipitation in the NR cell. As in
step 1, other buffers may apply to other systems.
5. Collect the NR data in at least the three different buffers –
d-buffer, smw-buffer, and h-buffer (see Note 6). Use the
HLPC pump for the injection of 20 mL of buffer. The col-
lected experimental data in the case of NHE1-LID are reported
in Fig. 3a.
3.5
Data Analysis
NR data analysis involves the comparison of a theoretical model for
the sample structure to the collected experimental data. The theo-
retical model contains a deﬁned number of parameters, which are
varied in order to maximize the agreement between the theoretical
NR curve and the experimental data. An NR theoretical model is
typically based on either the Parratt formalism or the optical matrix
method, and they both require dividing the sample in layers with
different composition [30]. A total of four parameters are assigned
to each layer in the model, i.e., thickness (t), scattering length
density (ρ), solvent volume fraction (ϕs), and surface roughness
(r). Here, we will provide some of the fundamental steps for sche-
matically representing the sample into a stack of layers in the speciﬁc
case a supported lipid bilayer interacting with an IDP. This repre-
sentation of the sample can be used to build a theoretical model for
the NR data analysis using one of several software programs avail-
able for NR data analysis (www.reﬂectometry.net). From the opti-
mization of the model parameters listed above to the experimental
data, the scattering length density proﬁle (ρ(z)) can be calculated
(Figs. 2b and 3b). ρ(z) will contain the information on the average
IDP-Membrane Interaction by Neutron Reﬂectometry
575

distribution of the molecules composing the sample in the direction
normal to the substrate surface. All the available software programs
for NR data analysis provide the calculation of ρ(z) from the ﬁt of
the designed theoretical model to the experimental data.
1. Start by analyzing the data collected on the bare silicon sub-
strate. The silicon oxide layer present on the substrate surface is
not expected to change upon injection of the vesicles and
formation of the lipid bilayer. Keep the structural parameters
for the silicon oxide layer ﬁxed during the next steps of data
analysis to reduce the number of free parameters in the model.
In this case, the parameters for the silicon oxide layer were
t ¼ (10  1) A˚ ; ρ ¼ (3.46 ∙106) A˚ 2; ϕs ¼ (0.20  0.05);
r ¼ (3  1) A˚ .
2. Use three different layers to describe the supported lipid
bilayer: two layers for the inner and outer lipid headgroups
and one intermediate layer for the lipid acyl chains. Include in
the model also the silicon oxide layer, and ﬁx its structural
parameters to the ones obtained from 1. In this speciﬁc case
since the bilayer is composed only by POPC molecules, it is
possible to calculate the scattering length density for both the
lipid headgroup and acyl chains from their chemical composi-
tion and the molecular volumes reported in the literature [31]
(ρ ¼ 1.86 ∙106 A˚ 2 and ρ ¼ 0.29 ∙106 A˚ 2, respectively).
The structural parameters obtained for the characterized

POPC bilayer are reported in Table 1 and are in good agree-
ment with previous results [32]. If the data analysis shows that
the inner and outer headgroup layers converge to the same
parameter values, constrain these two layers to have the same
structural parameters during further reﬁnement of the ﬁtting
curves to minimize the number of free parameters. The scat-
tering length density proﬁle calculated for the POPC lipid
bilayer is reported in Fig. 2b.

3. With the structural information on the pure lipid bilayer
obtained in step 2, proceed with the analysis of the data col-
lected after the addition of the IDP, in this case NHE-LID.
Compare the data collected with and without the protein.
Visual inspection of the data trend can sometimes help design-
ing a model for the data analysis. If the data trend for the curves
collected with and without the protein is identical, no interac-
tion occurred between the bilayer and the IDP. Build different
theoretical models based on reasonable hypothesis for the
IDP-bilayer interaction. The following different scenarios can
be considered in the case of NHE1-LID: (1) the protein mole-
cules interact with the lipid headgroups and are hence mainly
located on the membrane surface; (2) the protein molecules
penetrate in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer but are still
mainly located in the outer leaﬂet; (3) the protein molecules are
able to cross the membrane and are hence found both in the
hydrophobic region of the outer and inner leaﬂet. Figure 4
shows a schematic representation of the above-described
potential locations of and IDP interacting with a lipid mem-
brane using the NHE1-LID as an example (see Note 11).
Compare the different theoretical models to the experimental
data, and identify the one better reproducing the data. In the
case of the NHE1-LID, model b produced the best agreement
with the experimental data. According to this hypothesis, the
model for the NR data analysis should consider ﬁve different
layers to describe the sample structure (i.e., layer 1, inner lipid
Fig. 4 Schematic representation of the different hypothesis for the NHE-LID interaction with the POPC bilayer.
(a) the protein molecules interact with the lipid headgroups and are hence mainly located on the membrane
surface; (b) the protein molecules penetrate in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer but are still mainly located
in the outer leaﬂet; (c) the protein molecules are able to cross the membrane and are hence found both in the
hydrophobic region of the outer and inner leaﬂet. Dashed lines are used to mark the different interfaces which
are used to build the NR theoretical model

headgroups; layer 2, inner acyl chain region; layer3, outer acyl
chain region+NHE1-LID; layer4, outer headgroup layer +
NHE1-LID; layer5, NHE1-LID outside the bilayer) and the
additional layer to describe the silicon oxide on the substrate
surface (six layers in total). The protein volume fraction in layer
3 and 5 can be constrained to represent the same number of
protein molecules, as in this speciﬁc case, if the protein mole-
cules are hypothesized to be only partially inserted in the lipid
bilayer (see Note 12).
4. Optimize the structural parameters of the best model for
obtaining an accurate description of the sample structure (see
Note 13). The optimized structural parameters obtained for
the NHE1-LID interacting with the POPC lipid bilayer are
reported in Table 1. In this case, we found that the NHE1-LID
molecules partially penetrated the POPC bilayer without sub-
stantially affecting the overall membrane structure. The total
membrane thickness and the structural parameters for the lipid
headgroup layers remained almost unaffected if compared to
the POPC bilayer before the protein injection. The scattering
length proﬁle calculated for the NHE1-LID interacting with
the POPC-supported lipid bilayer is reported in Fig. 3b.

Notes
1. Neutrons interact differently with the two hydrogen isotopes,
protium and deuterium [33]. As a consequence, D2O and H2O
have very different scattering length densities (6.35 ∙106 A˚ 2
and 0.56 ∙106 A˚ 2, respectively). Measurements with the
sample or the bare substrate in contact with D2O are charac-
terized by a lower background (one of the main sources of
background is the incoherent scattering form the protium
nuclei) and exhibit a critical edge [15] at low q. Hence, it is
desirable to start the experiment with the ﬁrst measurement in
D2O, as the signal from the sample will be stronger and it will
be easier to evaluate whether it is correctly aligned in the
instrument (sample misalignment might affect both the critical
edge shape and position, and it might produce R < 1 before
the critical edge).
2. Alternative detergent solutions can be used as well.
3. The main goal of the substrate cleaning step is to ensure that all
the unwanted organic molecules are removed from the sub-
strate surface and that the surface is indeed hydrophilic. This is
a very important step, since having a hydrophilic surface is a
fundamental requirement for the subsequent formation of the
supported lipid bilayer. Milder approaches for cleaning the
substrate surface involve sonication of the silicon crystal in
IDP-Membrane Interaction by Neutron Reﬂectometry
579

organic solvents, i.e., sequentially chloroform, acetone, and
ethanol, followed by surface treatment with a UV ozone lamp
or a plasma cleaner (20 min and 3 min, respectively). If the
substrate is cleaned with the piranha solution well in advance of
the beginning of the experiment (e.g., 1 or 2 days before), it is
recommendable to use the UV ozone lamp or the plasma
cleaner treatment before assembling the NR cell. This further
treatment will restore the surface hydrophilicity that the sub-
strate might have lost if not used right after the cleaning with
the piranha solution.
4. Alternatively, methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol can be used
as well.
5. POPC vesicles tend to rearrange over time from SUV to multi-
lamellar vesicles. Hence, while the POPC suspension can be
prepared a few days in advance of the NR experiment, it is
recommendable to perform the tip sonication right before
injecting the solution in the NR cell. This will favor the vesicle
fusion process and allow for the formation of a supported lipid
bilayer with a better surface coverage.
6. A quick visual inspection of the collected NR curves after the
deposition of the lipids can provide qualitative information on
the successful formation of the supported lipid bilayer on the
substrate surface. In particular in the d-buffer contrast, the
presence of lipids on the substrate surface should produce a
higher reﬂectivity signal than the substrate alone. One of the
main reasons for the failure of the supported lipid bilayer
formation is that the substrate surface is not sufﬁciently hydro-
philic. In that case, it is recommended to unmount the NR cell
and start over from the substrate cleaning (Subheading 3.1).
7. NR data analysis involves the comparison of a theoretical model
for the sample structure to the collected experimental data. The
theoretical model contains a deﬁned number of parameters,
which are varied in order to maximize the agreement between
the theoretical NR curve and the experimental data. In the case
of a single NR curve, multiple combinations of parameter
values can produce a reasonable ﬁtting curve. Hence to make
the ﬁtting procedure converge to a unique set of parameter
values, NR curves for the same sample, but in different contrast
situations, i.e., in contact with buffers prepared with different
D2O and H2O ratios, are collected and simultaneously ana-
lyzed. The different D2O and H2O content in the buffer will
produce a different contrast (difference in the scattering length
density of the sample compared to the buffer), and thus the NR
curves will show a different data trend although they corre-
spond to the same sample structure. Three different contrasts
are typically sufﬁcient to obtain a reliable data analysis [34].

8. The aggregation in the presence of salt is a peculiar characteris-
tic of NHE1-LID, which required the protein to be injected in
the cell containing the lipid bilayer as a solution in ultrapure
water. Other IDPs can have a different behavior and be stable in
buffer solutions. In these cases, there is no need of introducing
ultrapure water before injecting the protein solution.
9. The interaction between IDPs and a lipid membrane can take a
variable amount of time to occur depending on the afﬁnity of
the protein for the speciﬁc lipid species present in the mem-
brane. Before performing the NR experiment, other lab
surface-sensitive techniques, such as quartz crystal microbal-
ance with dissipation monitoring [35] (QCM-D) or surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) [36], can be used to deﬁne the
optimal incubation time required for the IDP molecules to
interact with the lipid membrane. This incubation time might
be extremely variable from one IDP to another and according
to the membrane lipid composition.
10. Because of the need of different contrasts for NR data analysis,
the sample investigated by NR must be stable under buffer
ﬂushing through the cell. Indeed, the main assumption during
the simultaneous analysis of NR curves in different contrast
situations is that the structure of the sample remains unaffected
by replacing one contrast with another. For this reason, the
protein excess is removed from the cell, and only the IDP
molecules that are stably adsorbed on the lipid membrane
(stably adsorbed means that will not be removed during buffer
ﬂushing through the cell) will be detected. In practice, IDP
molecules that are in solution or IDP molecules that are weakly
adsorbed on the membrane surface (the abovenamed protein
excess) will be removed during a ﬁrst water or buffer injection
step. After collecting a ﬁrst NR curve for the IDP adsorbed on
the membrane (preferably in D2O or d-buffer), it is recom-
mendable to repeat the water/buffer injection and collect
another NR curve in the same contrast as the ﬁrst one to
make sure that the sample is indeed not affected by further
protein removal. Lab techniques such as QCM-D and SPR can
again provide useful preliminary information on the sample
stability under water/buffer ﬂushing.
11. Figure 4 shows three extreme situations for the interaction
between an IDP and a lipid membrane. Other intermediate
scenarios in which the protein is only partially penetrating into
the outer and inner leaﬂet could also be considered. However,
these would involve building a more complex model contain-
ing a larger number of layers than the ones reported here and
hence also a larger number of parameters to be optimized.

12. By considering that a single NHE1-LID molecule is partially
inserted among the lipid acyl chain in the outer membrane
leaﬂet and partially outside the membrane and exposed to the
solvent, the scattering length density of the outer acyl chain
layer (ρouter acyl chain) can be expressed according to Eq. 1:
ρouter acyl chain ¼ ϕNHE1LID,3ρNHE1LID
þ 1  ϕNHE1LID,3


ρouter acyl chain
ð1Þ
where ϕNHE1  LID, 3 is the NHE1-LID volume fraction in the
outer acyl chain layer (layer 3 in Fig. 4b). Calculation of the
NHE1-LIDscatteringlengthdensity(ρd-buffer¼3.15∙106A˚ 2;
ρsmw-buffer ¼ 2.41 ∙106 A˚ 2; ρh-buffer ¼ 1.87 ∙106 A˚ 2)
shows that in particular in the h-buffer the protein has a
scattering length density very close to the lipid headgroups
(i.e., 1.86 ∙106 A˚ 2); hence a similar expression compared
to the one reported in Eq. 1 cannot be used for the lipid
headgroup layers, i.e., the neutrons are not capable of distin-
guishing the NHE1-LID molecules from the lipid headgroups.
On the other hand, a very high contrast is present between
the NHE1-LID and the lipid acyl chain or the NHE1-LID and
buffer. Hence, information on the amount of the IDP inter-
acting with the membrane can be obtained only by the scatter-
ing length density value associated to layers 3 and 5 of Fig. 4b.
By implementing Eq. 2 in the model for the NR data analysis,
the number of NHE1-LID molecules present outside the
bilayer and inside the bilayer was constrained to be the same.
ϕNHE1LID,3 ¼ V NHE1LID,3 t3
V NHE1LID,5t5 ϕNHE1LID,5
ð2Þ
In Eq. 2 VNHE1  LID, 3 and VNHE1  LID, 5 are, respec-
tively, the protein volume in layer 3 and 5, and t3 and t5 are the
thickness of layer 3 and 5, while ϕNHE1  LID, 5 is the NHE1-
LID volume fraction in the layer outside the lipid bilayer.
VNHE1  LID, 3 and VNHE1  LID, 5 were calculated by consid-
ering the protein total volume (8169 A˚ 3 as calculated from the
protein sequence) and by introducing in the model an addi-
tional parameter ( f ) quantifying the fraction of the protein
molecular volume inside and outside the membrane.
A ﬁrst optimization of the model parameters to the experi-
mental data showed that parameters for the two headgroup
layers converged to similar values. For this reason, the theoret-
ical curves reported in Fig. 3a were obtained by constraining
these two layers to have the same structure. This gave a consid-
erable reduction of the number of free parameters in the
model.
13. In Fig. 3b the NHE1-LID interacting with the membrane is
represented as a red area. This is because in principle the
582
Alessandra Luchini and Lise Arleth

interaction between an IDP and a lipid bilayer can affect the
protein secondary structure and an IDP can potentially
become structured upon interacting with the lipids. However,
NR cannot directly detect the protein secondary structure. For
this reason, the NHE1-LID structure was not represented in
Fig. 3b.

Interactions of IDPs with Membranes Using Dark-State
Exchange NMR Spectroscopy
Tapojyoti Das, Diana Acosta, and David Eliezer
Abstract
Membrane interactions of proteins play a role in essential cellular processes in both physiological and disease
states. The structural ﬂexibility of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) allows for interactions with
multiple partners, including membranes. However, determining conformational states of IDPs when
interacting with membranes can be challenging. Here we describe the use of nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), including dark-state exchange saturation transfer (DEST), to probe IDP-membrane interactions in
order to determine whether there is an interaction, which residues participate, and the extent/nature of the
interaction between the protein and the membrane. Using α-synuclein and tau as typical examples, we
provide protocols for how the membrane interactions of IDPs can be probed, including details of how the
samples should be prepared and guidelines on how to interpret the results.

Introduction
1.1
Application
of NMR for Probing
IDP-Membrane
Interactions
NMR spectroscopy has provided insights into the effects of mem-
brane interactions on structural characteristics of IDPs such as
secondary structure formation. Solution-state NMR is highly
dependent on the tumbling rate of biomolecules. Slower tumbling
caused by the presence of large structures like lipid small unilamellar
vesicles (SUVs, 30–40 nm in diameter) can result in broad, unde-
tectable NMR signals. For this reason, detergent micelles (4–5 nm
in diameter) [1] are often used to analyze membrane-bound con-
formation of IDPs using solution-state NMR [2]. However, solu-
tion NMR can still be useful in studying the interactions of IDPs
with large objects like lipid vesicles, because sites that are not
associated with the vesicle surface remain highly ﬂexible, and give
rise to detectable NMR signals [3]. These signals can be used to
determine the free fraction of protein at a residue-resolved level by

Fig. 1 Principle of dark-state excitation saturation transfer (DEST). (a) Dark-state excitation: Selective
saturation of the vesicle-bound state of a protein can be achieved by a saturation pulse away from the
resonance frequency. Saturation in NMR terminology means the net magnetization is zero in all three
dimensions. Hence, a saturated nucleus does not produce any detectable NMR signal. The red and cyan
lines represent the free-state and vesicle-bound-state peaks, with linewidths of 100 Hz and 5000 Hz,
respectively. The pink-shaded region represents the saturation pulse bandwidth (400 Hz). The plot on the
right is scaled up from the region indicated by a dashed cyan box in the left plot to show the relative area under
the curves within the saturation bandwidth, which represents the saturation efﬁciency at that particular offset.
(b) Saturation transfer by a slow exchange process: The exchange process is governed by an on-rate (kon) that
causes an increase in the transverse relaxation rate in the vesicle-bound sample (ΔR2). The vesicle-bound
state is saturated by the saturation pulse. When the saturated molecules come off the vesicles (saturation
transfer) with an off-rate koff, they mix with the free-state molecules and cause a proportionate decrease in
the NMR signal. By saturating the system at different offsets and using a saturation pulse of different
bandwidths, a DEST proﬁle is determined experimentally. To extract kinetic rate constants, appropriate
kinetic model parameters are ﬁt computationally so that the theoretical DEST proﬁle matches the experimental
DEST proﬁle

comparing signal intensities with those from a matched sample
without vesicles [4].
In addition, while resonances of vesicle-bound residues are
broadened beyond direct detection, the broad signal of the
bound-state fraction can be selectively saturated using a narrow-
bandwidth saturation pulse far away from the free-state resonance
frequency (Fig. 1). When this saturated bound state exchanges with
the free state, the signal from the free state decreases consequently.
This technique is called dark-state excitation saturation transfer
(DEST) and, in combination with T2 relaxation experiments, is a
powerful method to probe the kinetics of exchange processes
occurring at timescales ranging from approximately 10 ms to 1 s
[5]. In these types of spectra, it is possible to uncover which
residues are interacting with the membrane, to determine the
appropriate kinetic model for the system, and to extract the kinetic
rates of such interactions.
As an aside, we note that in contrast with NMR, electron spin
resonance (ESR) can be used to directly observe proteins bound to
either lipid vesicles or SDS micelles without concerns regarding
signal loss. ESR has been used extensively for structural studies of
membrane-bound IDPs such as α-synuclein [6–8]. ESR requires
introduction of spin labels containing unpaired electrons into pro-
tein samples, which is typically accomplished using cysteine chem-
istry. It can be used both to probe the environment of individual
spin labels placed at different positions within a protein and for
measurements of inter-residue distances for proteins containing
two (or more) spin labels [9]. While we have used ESR to study
protein-membrane interactions [6, 7, 10], the methods and proto-
cols involved in this complementary approach are beyond the scope
of this current chapter.
1.2
Membrane
Interactions
of Intrinsically
Disordered Proteins
Membrane interactions of IDPs contribute to physiological pro-
cesses that maintain essential cellular functions. For example, axo-
nal localization of the microtubule-associated protein tau is
thought to be mediated by membrane binding and essential for
neurite polarity [11, 12]. Tau-lipid interactions can perturb its
association with microtubules [13] and alter tau’s conformation
[10, 13] in a way that could contribute to tau’s pathological aggre-
gation into paired helical ﬁlaments (PHFs) [2, 14, 15]. Additionally,
α-synuclein has been implicated in modulation of membrane-
related processes, including neurotransmitter release [16]. Interac-
tions

α-synuclein [17], as observed with NMR [3], electron spin reso-
nance [6, 7], and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy [18]. Although we use
tau and α-synuclein as examples for the following procedures,
NMR techniques can be applied to other IDPs for the study of
protein-membrane interactions [4].

Sample Preparation
1. Gently resuspend the lyophilized protein in NMR buffer to
prepare stock solution of 200 μM (see Note 2).
2. Filter the protein sample through a 100 kDa cutoff spin ﬁlter to
remove any large aggregates.
3. For lipid vesicle binding studies, make a sample of 50–100 μM
protein with an appropriate concentration of lipid small uni-
lamellar vesicles (SUVs) (we generally use 1 mM, see Subhead-
ing 3.1.4 for a discussion of how to select the lipid
concentration). It is desirable to keep the protein concentra-
tions equal for different protein variants as the free- and bound-
state populations will vary with total protein concentration.
Since SUV properties from different batches can vary, it is
also advisable to use the same batch of lipid vesicles for different
conditions when possible.
4. Make a matched free-state (lipid-free) sample with the same
concentration of protein by mixing an equal volume of protein
stock solution with NMR buffer not containing SUVs.

3.1.2
NMR Spectrometer
Setup
For comparison, all NMR spectra (control and experimental)
should be collected on the same instrument and under identical
conditions and parameters. For our experiments, we use a Bruker
AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic
triple-resonance probe. The initial steps are the same for every
NMR experiment and constitute setting the temperature, locking
the magnetic ﬁeld, tuning and matching, shimming the magnet,
and determining 90 high-power pulse widths for every measured
nucleus. In general, 1H pulse width is determined experimentally,
while those of the 15N and 13C nuclei can be determined by looking
up a calibration table that is dependent on the probehead and
sample solvent (the so-called prosol table). When further accuracy
is required, e.g., in 15N relaxation experiments, 90 pulse widths for
15N and 13C can also be determined experimentally (see Note 3).
The following are standard steps for setting up a spectrometer.
For speciﬁc commands we refer the reader to standard NMR
manuals.
1. Adjust the temperature by 5 C at a time to reach the target
temperature before inserting the sample into the instrument
(see Note 4).
2. Load your sample in the shuttle, and adjust the sample height
using the depth gauge to an appropriate depth.
3. Adjust the lock ﬁeld and phase to center the lock signal. Once
centered, turn the lock on and check that the lock signal is
stable.
4. Open a new dataset for your current sample.
5. Tune and match the 1H and 15N channels for the sample.
Typically, commands that provide automatic adjustments are
sufﬁcient for proper tuning and matching; however manual
adjustments are recommended for greater accuracy.
6. Shim the spectrometer coils to optimize a homogeneous signal
throughout your sample.
7. Manually calibrate the 1H 90 hard pulse length (see Note 5).
8. (Optional) Calibrate 15N 90 hard pulse length (see Note 6).
9. Calibrate the shaped pulses for each experiment (see Note 7).
3.1.3
1H-15N HSQC
Experimental Run
and Setup
For our experiments, 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra are collected at
10 C (α-synuclein) or 30 C (tau) with 512 complex points in the
1H dimension, 128 complex points in the 15N dimension, a spectral
IDP-Membrane by NMR
589

width of 13 ppm in the 1H dimension and 26 ppm in the 15N
dimension, and an offset of 4.7 ppm in the 1H dimension and
119 ppm in the 15N dimension. However, adjustments of spectral
window, number of data points, and number of scans are often
needed and will be described below.
1. Prepare the sample, insert it in the magnet, and set up spec-
trometer as described above.
2. Open your dataset and set the experiment. We use a modiﬁed
version of an experiment available in Bruker TopSpin catalogue
(hsqcetfpf3gpsi). For convenience, an experiment with para-
meters can be copied from an existing dataset to the working
folder using the command “edc”.
3. Set up an appropriate spectral window to avoid folded or
aliased resonances. Start by setting a little wider spectral
width, collect a test spectrum, and narrow down optimally to
avoid folded or aliased peaks (see Note 8).
4. Set up an appropriate number of data points to obtain the
desired resolution. Typical total data points are 1024 or 2048
for the proton dimension and 160 to 320 for the nitrogen
dimension.
5. Set up an appropriate number of scans to achieve an optimal
signal to noise ratio (S/N). Typically, 4–32 scans are sufﬁcient
for our experiments (see Note 9).
6. Look up the prosol table (execute getprosol) to calculate the
shaped pulses from the calibrated hard pulses (see Note 7).
7. Determine the optimal receiver gain (rg) by executing “rga.”
Setting a lower receiver gain than the autocalibrated value is
generally recommended to avoid receiver overload. A cali-
brated receiver gain value that is too low (<100) usually indi-
cates improper water suppression or otherwise spurious signal
that needs to be taken care of. On the other extreme, if the
calibrated receiver gain is too high (>1000), we generally set it
to 512.
8. Check the estimated duration of the experiment by typing
“expt.”
9. Once all parameters have been set, run the experiment by
entering “zg.”
3.1.4
15N-T2 Relaxation
Experimental Setup
For DEST and T2 relaxation experiments, a low concentration of
SUV is needed so that around 5% of the sample is in the bound
state. This concentration can be determined from vesicle titration
experiments (see Note 10). We have achieved good results with
100 μM protein and 1 mM total lipids, but this depends on the
afﬁnity between the IDP and the membrane. To prevent lipid
oxidation causing time-dependent changes in the spectra during
acquisition, we have achieved good results by topping the sample
590
Tapojyoti Das et al.

with an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon before capping the
NMR tube (see Notes 11–13).
T2 relaxation measurements are typically performed for both
the 5% bound-state and the matched free-state samples. For T2
relaxation experiments, also known as transverse or spin-spin relax-
ation experiments, we use an interleaved version of 15N Carr-Pur-
cell-Meiboom-Gill
(CPMG)
experiment
(hsqct2etf3gpsi3d,
Bruker TopSpin). This is essentially a pseudo-3D experiment com-
posed of a set of interleaved 2D 1H-15N experiments with a variable
relaxation delay. This relaxation delay is changed by varying the
number of CPMG units in the pulse program before acquisition. Of
note, the 15N 90 pulse width has to be determined precisely for
this experiment (see Note 6). Once the initial steps of setting up any
NMR experiment have been completed, the general guidelines are
as follows:
1. General parameters: We generally use 1024 total points
(512 complex points) in the direct dimension and 160–320
total points (80–160 complex points) in the indirect dimen-
sion, which is enough to resolve most peaks for tau fragments
and for α-synuclein. The number of scans is chosen so that the
weakest peaks can still be distinguished at the maximum relax-
ation delay; 16–32 scans are ideal for our experiments.
2. Shaped pulse calibration: There is a proton 90 shaped pulse in
the pulse program for water suppression, and the pulse power
(attenuation in dB) is calibrated by calculating the area under
the curve in the shaped pulse tool or simply by executing
“getprosol” (see Note 7).
3. Relaxation delays: The relaxation delays are multiples of a block
of 16,180 pulses that constitute a single CPMG unit (Fig. 2),
the duration of which can be found in the “d31” parameter
during the ﬁtting. The multiplier array is read from a separate
“vclist” ﬁle in the experiment folder. The number of elements
in the “vclist” array and the maximum relaxation delay are
chosen so that an exponential decay model can be ﬁtted to
the intensity series and can be calibrated from a test experiment
that measures the decay of an 1D spectrum with increasing
relaxation delay (see Note 14). One delay point is collected in
triplicate to enable estimation of the experimental error. More-
over, the multiplier array for the relaxation delay is scrambled,
and the delay between pulses (D1) is optimally increased to
prevent sample temperature changes during the acquisition. A
typical CPMG unit duration in the 700 MHz spectrometer is
16.32 ms, and the multiplier array is {0, 18, 12, 2, 3, 10, 6, 8,
1, 14, 6, 4, 6}, implying that the maximum relaxation duration
is 16.32 ms  18 ¼ 293.76 ms, and the data point at
16.32 ms  6 ¼ 97.92 ms is collected in triplicate. Finally, it
IDP-Membrane by NMR

is essential to set both the number of points in the third
dimension and the parameter NBL (size of buffer that stores
ﬁds before writing to disk) to the number of relaxation delays
used in the experiment.
3.1.5
15N-DEST
Experimental Setup
15N-DEST experiments are recorded for the 5% bound-state sam-
ple only. We use the pulse sequence developed by Fawzi et al. [20],
which is essentially a series of interleaved 2D experiments using
saturation at various offsets from the center of the 15N dimension.
The pulse sequence for Bruker AVANCE spectrometers (Fig. 3) is
freely available from the Marius Clore lab website (see Note 1).
Some parameters in the DEST pulse sequence, particularly those
related to the saturation pulse, are hard-coded in the pulse pro-
gram, and a general familiarity with Bruker pulse programming
language is recommended. Here we enumerate the general steps
of setting up a 15N-DEST experiment.
1. General parameters: Accurate calibration of 15N 90 pulse
length at high power is essential for 15N-DEST experiment.
The number of points for each 2D plane and the number of
scans are guided by similar principles as in 15N-T2 (see Sub-
heading 3.1.4). The number of points in the second dimension
is the product of that of an individual experiment and the
number of 2D spectra needed (Fig. 3).

Fig. 2 T2 relaxation experiment. In a 15N-CPMG-T2 relaxation experiment,
multiple CPMG units are used in tandem to model the exponential relaxation
decay as indicated by the loss of signal with increasing delay. The narrow and
wide bars represent 90 and 180 pulses, respectively. τ represents a unit delay
time in between pulses. In a typical 15N-CPMG-T2 experiment, each CPMG block
consists of 16 such 180 pulses spaced by a constant delay. The number of such
blocks are varied using “vclist” array to achieve a series of delay times
592
Tapojyoti Das et al.

2. Saturation pulses: Selective saturation of 15N nuclei at a narrow
bandwidth is achieved by a long and weak RF pulse. At least
two different saturation bandwidths are recommended for
accuracy of model ﬁtting, as detailed later. For a 700 MHz
spectrometer, typical bandwidths can be 400 and 175 Hz. The
pulse power of the saturation pulse is calculated as follows: ﬁrst,
the time constant (τ) corresponding to a bandwidth (νbw) is
calculated as τ ¼
1
4νbw . Next, the pulse power difference in dB
(ΔdB) is determined as ΔdB ¼ 20  log 10
τ
τref, where τref refers
to the 15N reference 90 pulse width. Finally, the saturation
pulse power in dB (dBsat) corresponding to each saturation
bandwidth is calculated as dBsat ¼ dBref + ΔdB, where dBref
refers to the absolute power level (in dB) of the reference 90
pulse.
3. Saturation offsets: The 15N saturation pulse is applied at vari-
ous offsets from the 15N carrier frequency. Typically, we use
23 offsets at each power level with a range of 30 kHz on either
side of the carrier frequency and with more points toward the
center to capture the dip in signal as the saturation approaches
the carrier frequency, plus one reference offset at zero power.
Fig. 3 15N-DEST pulse sequence showing the nested loops in the pulse program (adapted with permission
from Fawzi et al.) [20]. The innermost loop is the mixing time for saturation, when a continuous-wave
saturation pulse is applied at the 15N channel, default 900 ms. The next loop is for different offsets and is set
using the parameter l8. Then comes the loop for phase cycling. The outermost loop (l3) is the number of
complex points in the indirect dimension for each 2D experiment. Since the whole experiment is an interleaved
2D experiment, the number of total points in the second dimension equals l8  2  l3. For every experiment,
the power levels are calibrated for the following pulses: ϕ7 (shaped 180 pulse IBURP2), ϕ8 (shaped 90 SINC
pulse), and CW-ϕ4 (continuous-wave saturation pulse on 15N dimension for desired bandwidth). The power
levels for CW-ϕ4 for different offsets are hard-coded in the pulse program, while every other parameter can be
entered in the acquisition parameter tab in Bruker TopSpin software
IDP-Membrane by NMR
593

The saturation power level-saturation offset tuples are hard-
coded into the pulse program and edited for every experiment.
4. Shaped pulses: The pulse program contains two shaped pulses
on the 1H channel, ϕ7 and ϕ8 (Fig. 3), the pulse powers of
which need to be calculated by integrating the shaped pulse
over the duration and comparing it to a reference as in the case
of the saturation pulse. This can be done easily using the shaped
pulse tool in Bruker TopSpin.

Data Analysis
3.2.1
NMR Signal
Processing
NMR data is acquired in the time domain and must be Fourier
transformed into the frequency domain. As an example, we will
discuss using NMRPipe [21] for the conversion of raw NMR data
using a Unix C shell. All of the following commands should be
executed within the appropriate ﬁle/directory in which the raw
NMR dataset resides.
1. bruker ↲
This opens a graphical user interface (GUI) in which one
should read parameters from the raw NMR Bruker dataset,
adjust temperature and conversion type as needed, save the
processing script (fid.com), and execute the script. Conse-
quently, a .fid ﬁle will be created in the dataset folder, indi-
cating that the raw NMR data is now in NMRPipe format.
2. nmrDraw ↲
This opens NMRDraw GUI in which one can visualize and
transform the time-domain data into the frequency domain.
Afterward, proper phasing is done for the frequency-domain
peaks and is performed by turning phasing on and adjusting the
zeroth order (p0) and the ﬁrst order (p1) phasing values until
all peaks are positive and “upright.”
3. Macro edit (shortcut m)
A basic 2D processing script with the adjusted p0 and p1
phasing parameters, determined as described above, should be
executed. An example of a 2D processing script is included
below with sections to be ﬁlled in by the user in bold.

3.2.2
NMR Spectral Peak
Picking
NMRViewJ is used to provide an example of how to pick peaks
(resonances), assign peaks, and measure peak intensity. As an alter-
nate, the user can use CcpNmr Analysis, Sparky, or any other NMR
data visualization program, which have their own user instructions.
1. Peak resonances can be picked for assignment manually by
setting the cursor to “PeakAdd” and manually clicking peaks,
or automatically in the “PeakPick” tab within Attributes. With
NMRViewJ, the picked peaks can be edited throughout the
picking and assignment process.
2. Peak assignments should be previously available. If there is no
previous assignment or peak list, triple-resonance experiments
are typically required to provide the information required for
obtaining resonance assignments. For our experiments, picking
peaks or labeling residues were based on our published assign-
ments of tau fragments or full-length human tau [2, 22, 23].
3. Peak intensity can be quantiﬁed by NMRViewJ with “Get
Intensities” within Peak > Integrate after peaks have been
picked (properties like peak volume can be obtained in a similar
way).
3.2.3
NMR Data Analysis
and Interpretation: 1H-15N
HSQC Intensity Ratios
1. Intensity ratios (I/I0) of every selected peak are calculated
(Fig. 4). I0 represents the peak intensity of resonances when
all of the protein is in a free state, and I represents the peak
intensity of free-state resonances when the protein is in the
presence of lipid vesicles (free protein fraction).
IDP-Membrane by NMR
595

2. Intensity ratios less than 1 indicate a loss of signal in the
presence of lipid membranes. Therefore, residues exhibiting
such effects are likely to be interacting with the membrane
surface. For each residue, the observed peak intensity reﬂects
the population of protein for which that residue is not bound
to the membrane, while the “missing” intensity reﬂects the
bound, and therefore invisible, population.
3.2.4
NMR Data Analysis
and Interpretation: 15N-T2
Relaxation
It is important to ﬁrst overlay the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the
free-state and bound-state samples to ensure no chemical shift
differences are present and to ensure slow exchange on the NMR
timescale and that only dark-state exchange will be analyzed. We
use a custom NMRPipe conversion and processing macro based on
the script available on the Marius Clore lab website (see Note 1) for
both the T2 relaxation and DEST experiments. The steps involved
are as follows (Fig. 5):
1. Copy the provided folders containing all scripts for analysis
(“dataproc” for T2 relaxation and “destproc” for DEST) in
their
respective
data
folders
containing
Bruker
experiment data.
2. The pseudo-3D data is split into individual 2D datasets using
the provided script “sep_ﬁd.com,” which are processed iden-
tically using a loop within NMRPipe (edit the provided
“nmrproc.com” ﬁle).

resonance A and D, but not for resonance B or C. The intensity of each resonance for free state (green) and
bound state (red) can be extracted with an NMR data analysis software like NMRViewJ. These differences in
intensity can then be plotted as intensity ratios as shown in (b), where ratios ~1.0 show little to no binding and
smaller ratios (here shown as <0.5) indicate higher binding

(b) The experimental, simulated, and difference spectra are carefully inspected to determine whether
lineshape ﬁtting is optimal. If a region of poor ﬁt is identiﬁed (indicated by high signal in the difference
spectrum), the peaks in that region are reinspected for positioning and/or clustering errors (see text)

3. Peak picking and assignment are done on the reference experi-
ment with CcpNmr Analysis v2 by standard methods (see Note
15). Alternatively, one can also use NMRDraw peak picking
and assignment. In that case, save the peak list as “spec.Asstab,”
and skip directly to lineshape ﬁtting (step 6).
4. The CcpNmr peak list is exported to NMRDraw format (menu
options Other > Format Converter > Export > NMRDraw).
Save the peak list as “spec.Asstab.”
5. Next, peak clusters are deﬁned on the CcpNmr Analysis
exported ﬁle that need to be ﬁtted together to a simulated
lineshape. This is achieved by a custom script written in R (see
Note 16).
6. The acquired spectrum is ﬁtted to simulated lineshapes using
the autoﬁt.tcl routine in NMRPipe, and the intensities are
extracted across the 2D datasets.
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
cat spec.Asstab | grep -v None > spec_noNone.Asstab
autoFit.tcl -series -dX 0.0 -dY 0.0 -inTab spec_noNone.Asstab
-specName ft/test%03d.ft2
7. A simulated spectrum (sim) and difference spectrum (dif) will
be generated (Fig. 5b). Observe the difference spectrum care-
fully, and edit the cluster IDs iteratively as needed using
NMRDraw peak editing tool (show peaks as CLUSTID, edit)
to achieve a good ﬁt between the simulated and the experimen-
tal spectra.
8. Upon peak ﬁtting, a peak list ﬁle “axt.tab” is generated that
contains the relative intensity values for each peak as compared
to the ﬁrst spectrum in the series, which is usually the reference
spectrum. This ﬁle is cleaned with the following script:
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
cat axt.tab | grep -v None > nlin.filtered.tab
9. To extract relaxation rate constants, the relative intensities (I/
I0, I0 representing the corresponding peak intensities at zero
relaxation delay) are ﬁt to an exponential decay function, from
which R2 values are extracted, along with error estimates at
each residue. NMRPipe has a model ﬁtting routine that can ﬁt
experimental data to an exponential model.
modelExp.tcl nlin.filtered.tab nlin.spec.list 0.0
598
Tapojyoti Das et al.

The model ﬁtting data are plotted with the following
command:
/usr/bin/gnuplot gnu/∗
The R2 values with the uncertainties for each residue are
formatted and exported with the following routine:
./summary.tcl -in nlin.filtered.tab | ./formatR2out.pl | sort
-n > R2.txt
10. Once the R2 values for free state and bound state are calcu-
lated with identical steps, ﬁnally, the difference in R2 values
(ΔR2) between free state and bound state is calculated for
each residue.
./calc_deltaR2.pl R2bound.txt R2free.txt > deltaR2.txt
3.2.5
NMR Data Analysis
and Interpretation:
15N-DEST
The interleaved 2D datasets are split into individual 2D datasets,
each assigned to a speciﬁc 15N saturation pulse power and fre-
quency. Similar to the relaxation analysis above, each experiment
is processed identically with NMRPipe using a custom script (steps
1–8 identical as above Subheading 3.2.4), with the major exception
that the residue-speciﬁc DEST proﬁle (I/I0, I0 refers to the peak
intensity at zero saturation power) is extracted as a text ﬁle for
subsequent model ﬁtting using a custom MATLAB script DESTﬁt,
also available on the Marius Clore lab website (see Note 1)
[5, 20]. We developed a custom routine to extract the DEST proﬁle
data from NMRDraw peak list ﬁle and format it properly for
subsequent DESTﬁt routine (see Note 17). The DEST proﬁle
refers to the attenuation due to DEST as a function of saturation
offset for each selected residue position.
Subsequent model ﬁtting by DESTﬁt program (written in
MATLAB) involves choosing a kinetic model (Fig. 6) and observ-
ing the ﬁt of the data to their theoretical estimates based on the
solution of the McConnell equations (Fig. 7) [5, 24]. The DESTﬁt
program takes in some per-residue parameters (R1, deltaR2,
R2_app in bound-state sample, DEST proﬁle) and some global
parameters depending on the ﬁtted model (kapp
on , fraction in light
state) and tries to optimize some local parameters (residue-speciﬁc
dark-state R2) and some global parameters (koff), by ﬁtting the
theoretical ΔR2 and simulated DEST proﬁle to the experimental
data.
For a detailed discussion on the kinetic model ﬁtting and
necessary scripts for analysis of DEST data, we refer readers to the
published work from the developer of this technique [5, 20].

involves a free state and a vesicle-bound state, whereas a three-state model (b)
considers an additional tethered state where the protein is not completely bound
to the vesicle. The corresponding kinetic rate constants are indicated in the
diagram. For the purpose of ﬁtting DEST data, the simplest two-state model is
tried ﬁrst followed by three-state and more complicated models

residue 113 is located in the C-terminal domain which does not bind to lipid membranes. Due to increased
lipid-bound dark-state fraction of the N-terminal residues, they are progressively saturated by a narrow-
bandwidth pulse further away from the resonance frequency, resulting in progressive attenuation in the signal

2. Note that we ﬁnd that the NMR buffer works well for both
α-synuclein and tau, but other proteins may require optimiza-
tion of the buffer for both protein solubility and NMR
compatibility.
3. The approximate 15N 90 pulse width can be doubled in an
1D version of 1H-15N HSQC pulse program and calibrated to
extinguish the amide signal, from which the true 15N 90 pulse
width can be calculated precisely.
4. The temperature of the sample may differ from the tempera-
ture displayed on data acquisition software (e.g., TopSpin). To
accurately determine the temperature of the sample, calibration
curves are kept on ﬁle that are generated based on temperature-
dependent chemical shifts of deuterated methanol. It is recom-
mended to the user to set the experimental temperature based
on such a calibration curve for the actual sample temperature, if
one is available.
5. In order to calibrate 1H 90 hard pulse length, we use a proton
1D experiment. Initially we use a small duration pulse (typically
1 μs) to tip the magnetization a little. We set the receiver gain
“rg” to 1 and run the experiment with a single scan (ns ¼ 1)
and Fourier transform “ft” and adjust the phase of the resulting

Fig. 7 (continued) as one moves closer to the resonance frequency. Fit to kinetic models using the DESTﬁt
program are also plotted (dashed line, two-state model; solid line, three-state model, cf. Fig. 6). (b) Difference

spectrum “apk” to make it upright and symmetric. Then we set
the pulse length to four times the expected 90 pulse length
(to make a full 360 rotation of the magnetization vector, this
can be estimated from similar samples or using the automated
routine “pulsecal” on Bruker TopSpin), acquire the spectrum,
Fourier transform and phase correct “fp,” and observe the
result. Then we iteratively adjust the pulse length to extinguish
the signal (equal amount of positive and negative values). This
is the calibrated 360 pulse length, a quarter of which is the
calibrated 90 pulse length for proton.
6. As a rough estimate, the prosol table can be read with just the
1H-calibrated 90 hard pulse length to estimate the 15N 90
hard pulse length in any experiment. In order to manually
calibrate the 15N hard pulse length (recommended for relaxa-
tion experiments), we set up an 1D version of 1H-15N HSQC
and double the 15N hard pulse length and calibrate it to extin-
guish the signal. This value is calibrated 15N 180 hard pulse
length, half of which is the calibrated 15N 90 hard pulse
length.
7. For every experiment, to accurately calibrate the shaped pulses,
we look up the “prosol” table using the following command:
getprosol <nucleus 1> <90
pulse length of nucleus 1> <90
pulse attenuation in dB for nucleus 1> (optional) <nucleus 2>
<90 pulse length of nucleus 2> <90 pulse attenuation in dB
for
nucleus
2>
etc.
e.g.,
getprosol
1H
9.25
-8.4
15N
25.5
-24.56
8. To set up an optimal spectral window in the indirect dimen-
sion, we generally start with a wider spectral width (e.g.,
40 ppm) to encompass the entire spectrum. Then we collect a
test spectrum with a few scans (e.g., ns ¼ 4 or 8) and then
narrow down by setting the center position and spectral width
optimally to avoid any folded or aliased peaks.
9. For each FID, a designated number of scans (repeats of experi-
ments at each point) are averaged. It is important to note here
that the S/N scales as a square root of the number of scans, i.e.,
for a twofold increase in signal to noise, four times the number
of scans are required but linearly to the sample concentration.
Therefore, acquisition time would increase dramatically for
small improvements in resolution. Hence, to achieve a good
spectrum within a reasonable experimental time, it is advisable
to use a higher sample concentration as long as it does not
aggregate or is deemed unsuitable for the experimental
question.

10. Vesicle titration experiments can help the user gauge the appro-
priate lipid/protein molar ratio to use for DEST/T2 relaxation
samples. Brieﬂy, a series of samples containing lipids and
15N-labeled protein at molar ratios of 10:1, 50:1, 100:1, and
200:1 should be prepared. A brief 1H-15N HSQC NMR spec-
trum should be collected for each sample (e.g., 512 complex
points in the 1H dimension, 128 complex points in the 15N
dimension). Intensity ratios should be calculated for each sam-
ple, from which the sample with the majority of intensity ratios
around 0.75–1.0 should be selected as the appropriate molar
ratio to use for DEST/T2 relaxation experiments.
11. It is best to use freshly prepared vesicles, but vesicle prepara-
tions can be stored for several days up to a week if covered with
an inert gas and sealed to prevent oxidation.
12. Phospholipids get oxidized over time. So, it is important to use
fresh stocks of lipids to prepare vesicles and store the stock
properly sealed at 20 C.
13. Lipid-containing NMR samples get oxidized as well. This oxi-
dation can cause time-dependent changes in the NMR spectra.
Typically, the changes are reﬂected as the oxidation gets trans-
ferred to methionines [25]. This can be partially prevented by
ﬂowing an inert gas (N2 or Ar) through the NMR tube before
capping and sealing with parafﬁn ﬁlm, allowing NMR experi-
ments to run over longer duration.
14. To set up a test experiment to measure a 1D relaxation series,
we set the number of points in the indirect dimension to one
and acquire the spectrum with a limited number of scans
(usually 8 to 16). The resultant spectrum can be processed
with the command “ft2” to visualize the relaxation decay of
the 1D spectrum. It has to be noted though that this relaxation
series serves as a general estimate and may not fully capture the
relaxation timescale of individual residues, which can vary sig-
niﬁcantly. The maximum relaxation delay in the experiment is
limited by the probehead speciﬁcations, since the simultaneous
decoupling pulse on 1H channel puts stress on the probehead
and also tends to increase the temperature of the sample. So it
is generally recommended to keep it below 250–300 ms.
15. We deviate from the suggested protocol by Fawzi et al., where
NMRDraw was used for peak picking and assignment since
using NMRDraw for peak picking and assignment is less intui-
tive and it is difﬁcult to transfer peak assignments from an
existing peak list.

Determination of Binding Kinetics of Intrinsically
Disordered Proteins by Surface Plasmon Resonance
Julie M. Leth and Michael Ploug
Abstract
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is an important and convenient method for measuring kinetic rate
constants of given molecular interactions, equilibrium binding constants at steady state, or determinations
of binding stoichiometry. In its traditional setup, SPR requires that one binding partner is tightly immo-
bilized on the surface of a sensor chip either by direct chemical coupling to the surface-coated carbox-
ymethylated dextran matrix or by non-covalent capture to a high-afﬁnity binding partner that is covalently
linked to the surface. The latter design of the sensor surface is highly advantageous compared to the direct
chemical coupling as this setup ensures a homogeneous and speciﬁc orientation of the immobilized binding
partner. This chapter provides guidelines for the design of capturing systems that generally provide high-
end kinetic data suitable for determination of binding rate constants. This principle will be illustrated by the
binding of synthetic peptides derived from an intrinsically disordered region of the endothelial
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) to captured
monoclonal antibodies.

Introduction
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is an optical biosensing technol-
ogy that monitors protein-protein interactions as they occur in real
time. This particular feature is an important hallmark of this tech-
nology, which enables the determination of association (kon) and
dissociation (koff) rate constants. Measurements by this system
monitor the changes in the refractive index of the solvent that
occur near the sensor surface when the binding partner in solution
(the analyte) binds its partner protein immobilized on the sensor
surface (the ligand).
The physics employed in SPR technology entails conditions
with total internal reﬂection of polarized light at a prism-gold
interface. At a certain angle of incident light, incoming photons

interact with the oscillating electrons of the dielectric gold-ﬂuid
interface, which produces the phenomenon of surface plasmon
resonance, including an evanescent ﬁeld that propagates approxi-
mately 300 nm into the dextran matrix of the sensor chip. Overall,
this conﬁguration produces a drop in the reﬂected light intensity at
a certain angle (the SPR angle), which reports on the refractive
index just above the gold surface. Protein interactions are moni-
tored by changes in the SPR angle (deﬁned as resonance units,
RU). As the changes in accumulated mass on the sensor surface–
due to progressive protein binding—are directly proportional to
changes in refractive index, it is possible to calculate the surface
density of the bound protein at a given time (1 RU equals 1 pg/
mm2 of protein). This relationship also enables the calculation of
binding stoichiometry [1, 2].
The ﬁrst step in SPR is to immobilize the ligand on the sensor
chip surface. In general, the sensor surface contains a negatively
charged hydrogel comprised of a 100 nm thick carboxymethylated
dextran matrix, which is optimally positioned relative to the
strength of the evanescent ﬁeld sensing the changes in the refractive
index. The negatively charged carboxylates in the matrix serve a
dual purpose in the covalent coupling of the ligand. They (1) focus
the ligand in the hydrogel by electrostatic pre-concentration (using
low salt buffers with 3.5 < pH < pI of ligand) and (2) enable the
chemical derivatization with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)/1-
ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride
(EDC), which generates reactive NHS esters that are optimally
suited for gentle covalent couplings of proteins via their primary
amines. One obvious caveat of this strategy is that it provides a
random surface coupling orientation of the ligand, which depends
on the surface distribution and pKa of its α- and ε-amino groups.
This lack of uniform orientation inexorably introduces undesirable
heterogeneity in the subsequent binding kinetics of the injected
analyte. The surface density of immobilized ligand should be
prepared with a view to the subsequent binding mode, i.e., for
nonequilibrium kinetic analyses, it should be as low as the signal-
to-noise ratio of the SPR instrument permits to minimize con-
founding effect of mass transport limitations. This is less critical
for steady-state analyses providing information on equilibrium dis-
sociation constants (KD) only.
To generate a binding curve for the interaction under study, a
given soluble analyte is injected over the sensor surface in different
concentrations using as high ﬂow rates as possible, typically 50 μL/
min. The binding events are depicted in a sensorgram with distinct
association and dissociation phases (Figs. 1 and 2). During the
association phase, the analyte interacts reversible with the ligand,
and the progressive increase in RU reﬂects the net-binding ﬂux
(von  voff). During the dissociation phase—initiated by shifting
to buffer injection—a monoexponential decay of the formed
612
Julie M. Leth and Michael Ploug

complex occurs as the dissociated analyte is removed immediately
by the buffer ﬂow preventing rebinding. As the concentration of
analyte ideally is constant during the association phase, the kinetic
rate constants (kon and koff) can be derived from these curves using
nonlinear regression ﬁtting to a pseudo-1-order reaction for a
simple bimolecular interaction. When kon and koff are determined,
the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) can be calculated
(KD ¼ koff/kon). At the end of each kinetic cycle, the sensor chip
is regenerated enabling a new kinetic binding cycle to be
performed.
In the following sections, we will provide detailed protocols for
running SPR experiments using synthetic peptides representing the
N-terminal acidic and intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of
GPIHBP1 as surrogate molecules for intrinsically disordered pro-
teins. GPIHBP1 is essential for intravascular triglyceride hydrolysis
providing vital fuel for oxidative lipid metabolism in cardiac and
Fig. 1 Sensorgrams from a single cycle protocol for non-steady-state binding kinetics illustrating the basic
principle in this protocol (Subheading 3.2.1). Panel a shows the ﬂow cell-referenced data demonstrating the
capture of approximately 520 RU of the ligand (RF4 mAb ~ 3.5 fmol/mm2) on a CM5 sensor chip with
immobilized RAM. The slow dissociation rate provides a stable baseline for the single cycle injections
(reﬂected by the inserted horizontal dotted line). Subsequently, ﬁve consecutive injections of twofold serial
dilutions of analyte (green curve) or buffer (black curve) provide the raw data for generating double buffer-
referenced binding curves of the analyte (shown in panel b). Regeneration in the end of the single cycles
re-establishes the baseline corresponding to unoccupied RAM. The different steps in the single cycle protocol
are illustrated by the cartoon representations. (b) The double blank-referenced sensorgrams for binding of
GPIHBPI1–45 (green), GPIHBPI27–44 (blue), and GPIHBP127–44/R33M (purple) are shown. Five consecutive
injections of twofold dilutions (1–16 nM) of the respective analytes are shown. A longer dissociation phase
following that last injection is used for calculating koff. The differences in response between the longer peptide
GPIHBPI1–45 (green) and the shorter peptide GPIHBPI27–44 (blue) display how RU is directly proportional to
mass (1 RU equals 1 pg/mm2). The peptide GPIHBP127–44/R33M shows no response (i.e., R33 is a hot spot for
binding)

skeletal myocytes [3]. Its N-terminal acidic IDR drives the fast
complex formation with LPL via electrostatic steering and is also
essential for stabilizing its inherently unstable ligand, the lipopro-
tein lipase [4, 5]. A similar SPR approach was recently employed to
study the binding kinetics of disordered peptides derived from a
variety of partners for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) [6].
In this protocol, we used a Biacore T200™(GE Healthcare),
but equivalent instruments from other vendors, such as a Pro-
teOn™XPR36 (Bio-Rad), Octet RED384 (ForteBio), and the
SPR imaging tool of IBIS MX96 (Wasatch Microﬂuidics) may
also be used.

In this step, RAM antibodies are covalently coupled to the CM5
sensor chip surface. For the immobilization, you can choose to
specify the contact time and ﬂow rate or aim for a predeﬁned

immobilization level of your capture protein. By aiming for a
certain immobilization level, the system will automatically ﬁnd
conditions that will ensure that the deﬁned level of immobilization
is reached. To accomplish this, the rate of pre-concentration (i.e.,
electrostatic attraction of proteins by the anionic dextran surface) is
tested by injecting 10 μL of ligand solution at a ﬂow rate of 5 μL/
min over an inactivated sensor surface followed by a wash with
50 mM NaOH to regenerate and clean the surface and a
subsequent EDC/NHS activation step. Based on the rate of bind-
ing, the program will initiate a sequence of ligand injections until
the deﬁned level of immobilization is reached. The following pro-
tocol describes the immobilization of RAM aiming at a deﬁned
level of immobilization:
1. Prior to immobilization, run a Desorb and Sanitize step with a
maintenance chip docked (see Note 6).
2. Attach 1 L of running buffer to inlet tube A.
3. Select Tools in the toolbar and select Prime to ﬂush the system
with running buffer.
4. Dock a new CM5 chip at least a couple of hours before immo-
bilization, preferably the day before: Open Tools, and select
Eject Chip to undock the maintenance chip and Insert Chip to
dock a new CM5 chip (see Note 7).
5. Set up program for immobilization: Go to File and Open/New
Wizard Template. Select Immobilization and click New. Select a
set of ﬂow cells (either FC1 and FC2 or FC3 and FC4) in which
the capturing antibody (RAM) will be immobilized in both (see
Note 8). Choose Amine as coupling method, and aim for
immobilization level; set, for instance, target level to 10,000
RU (see Note 9), and set wash solution to 50 mM NaOH.
6. Thaw one aliquot of EDC, NHS, and ethylenediamine,
respectively.
7. Dilute the RAM antibody to 30 μg/mL in immobilization
buffer in the volume speciﬁed in the Wizard Template (see
below) (see Note 10).
8. Click Next to set temperature and prepare the rack with the
required coupling reagents: Add the stated volume of EDC,
NHS, NaOH, ethylenediamine, and diluted antibody solution
to suitable-sized vials (e.g., 0.8 mL vials) (see Note 11).
9. Insert rack and run the immobilization program.
3.2
Experimental
Measurements
In this step, we will ﬁrst capture the ligand by injecting it over the
immobilized RAM. Second, twofold or threefold dilution series of
the analyte is injected to determine the binding kinetics. If the
amount of analyte is not a limiting factor, choose as high ﬂow
rates as possible to minimize confounding effects from mass

transport limitations. Injection of analyte can be performed in two
different formats: i) multi-cycle protocols use a single injection of
each analyte concentration followed by a dissociation phase and
regeneration step in the end of each cycle or ii) single cycle proto-
cols injecting ﬁve different analyte concentrations followed by a
short dissociation phase but without intervening regeneration. The
last analyte injection (highest concentration) is followed by a long
dissociation phase and ﬁnally a regeneration step. The clear advan-
tage of the single cycle protocol is that no regeneration is required
between injections of the analyte dilution series and hence the
immobilized ligand does not suffer from repetitive exposures of
regeneration conditions.
In the ﬁrst protocol, we will describe a single cycle setup
measuring the binding kinetics of a high-afﬁnity interaction. Each
cycle will contain a capture step followed by ﬁve consecutive injec-
tions of twofold serial dilutions of analyte (or buffer) and ﬁnally a
regeneration step.
The second protocol describes a single cycle setup measuring
the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) at steady-state binding.
Due to the fast dissociation rate of this interaction, regeneration
between the serial injections is not required. Thus, only one capture
step is required followed by all analyte injections and ﬁnally a single
regeneration cycle.

Notes
1. The CM5 sensor chip is the most commonly used chip. How-
ever the high density of negatively charged carboxylates on the
dextran matrix may cause nonspeciﬁc binding if your analytes
are highly basic proteins/peptides with a large net positive
charge at the pH where the analysis is conducted. Alternatively,
use a CM4 chip with a lower degree of carboxylation or even a
CM1 chip with no dextran matrix and the carboxylate tethered
directly on the plain gold surface. The drawback of this strategy
is a lower immobilization yield, which may be suboptimal for
measuring binding to small peptides due to the low signal-to-
noise ratio.
2. Alternatively, HBS-EP can be purchased as 10 stock solu-
tions. To prepare 1 L running buffer, 100 mL 10 HBS-EP
is diluted with 900 mL Milli-Q water. We do not degas our
buffers because the Biacore instrument applied includes a
degasser. If this is not the case, you may degas your buffer to
eliminate dissolved air. Having surfactant, here Surfactant P20,
in your buffer can reduce nonspeciﬁc adsorption of protein. In
addition, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) can also be
added to the buffer to reduce nonspeciﬁc binding. The buffers
should always be freshly prepared and never used when older
than 3–4 days. 0.05% (w/v) NaN3 may also be added to avoid
bacterial growth in the buffer.
3. Excess reactive NHS esters on the sensor chip are inactivated by
large access of a small nucleophile reagent. Generally, the sen-
sor chip surface is inactivated with 70 μL 1 M ethanolamine
hydrochloride-NaOH pH 8.5 resulting in neutral modiﬁcation
of the reacted carboxyl groups. Nonetheless, ethylenediamine
can be used to inactivate the excess active NHS esters, which
introduces a positive charge of the derivatized carboxyl groups,
hence providing a more balanced overall charge of the sur-
face—now being a composite of the original negatively charged
carboxyl groups and the positively charged modiﬁcations by
ethylenediamine. This can be advantageous when working with
charged analytes in order to minimize nonspeciﬁc ionic inter-
actions with the surface. This is particularly important if the
analyte is an IDP having a high propensity of anionic or cationic
stretches.
4. If only one binding partner is intrinsically disordered, this
protein should preferably be used as analyte to avoid any con-
formational selection in the capture step. Alternatively, if both
binding partners contain disordered regions, one protein can
be modiﬁed with a tag, e.g., a His-tag can be positioned in one
Time is the Key—Kinetic Assessment of IDP Binding
623

of the termini and be used as capture epitope for an immobi-
lized anti-His tag antibody [6].
5. Vials and microplates should be sealed to prevent sample
evaporation.
6. This maintenance step is run to ensure a clean ﬂow path. The
Desorb tool will remove adsorbed protein from the autosampler
and the IFC, and the Sanitize tool will remove contaminating
microorganisms. Select Tools in the toolbar, and open More
Tools, and choose the maintenance tool Desorb and Sanitize.
The procedure will require two desorb solutions: 0.5% (w/v)
sodium dodecyl sulfate and 50 mM glycine-NaOH pH 9.5,
respectively, as well as a BIAdisinfectant solution (sodium
hypochlorite) (GE Healthcare). It is important to avoid having
a coupled CM5 chip docked during this procedure because the
procedure will destroy the sensor chip surface, so remember to
dock a maintenance chip or an old worn-out CM5 sensor chip.
7. The sensor chip is stored at 4 C and thus requires some time to
reach the temperature of the system and needs to be ﬂushed
extensively with buffer to remove any additives prior to ligand
immobilization.
8. When immobilizing a capturing layer for your ligand, you need
to prepare the surface of your reference ﬂow cell in the same
way as your active ﬂow cell meaning the same settings should
be applied for both active and reference ﬂow cell. This should
provide
the
best
reference
subtraction
when
analyzing
your data.
9. The exact immobilization level is not so critical when having a
capture layer as the amount of captured ligand can be adjusted
in the binding analysis setup. According to the mouse antibody
capture kit (GE Healthcare), an immobilization level of
9000–14,000 RU is suggested. Nevertheless, the mass of
both your ligand and analyte should be taken into consider-
ation to ensure sufﬁcient response of the analyte in the kinetic
analysis (see Note 15).
10. The protein to be immobilized should ﬁrst be diluted in immo-
bilization buffer just prior to the run as the pH of the buffer
may not be well tolerated by the protein. Make sure that the
protein is stable and functional under these conditions. Low
ionic strength and low pH can be detrimental to certain pro-
teins leading to inactivation and/or aggregation. If the optimal
pH for pre-concentration of the protein at the sensor surface is
not known, a pH scouting experiment can be run before
immobilization.
11. Ethanolamine is generally used to inactivate excess NHS esters
and is the solution stated in the Wizard Template for amine
coupling. The amine method can be altered by selecting
624
Julie M. Leth and Michael Ploug

Costume Methods in the immobilization setup window, i.e., to
change the inactivation solution to ethylenediamine.
12. It is important that your protein samples are as pure as possible.
Contaminating proteins or other components can potentially
cause heterogeneity by interacting with the ligand/analyte or
by nonspeciﬁc binding to the sensor surface. Low-afﬁnity bind-
ing interactions are often more prone to these caveats due to
the requirement of higher analyte concentrations. Moreover, it
is important to characterize and avoid multimerization of the
proteins as such heterogeneous samples will give rise to com-
plex binding proﬁles, which depend on the size and the risk of
introducing certain degrees of multivalency/avidity in the
binding reaction of the multimers.
13. Determination of the exact analyte concentration is particularly
important as the association rate depends on the analyte con-
centration. Therefore, if proteins are stored frozen, their con-
centration should be determined after centrifugation of the
thawed samples. If the IDPs lack tryptophan and tyrosine
residues causing a low absorbance at 280 nm, the protein
concentrations can be determined by absorbance at 214 nm
using calculated molar extinction coefﬁcients [8].
14. It can be a good idea to include at least one startup cycle to
ensure the system is stable and the baseline is not drifting.
15. The ligand is more homogeneously orientated when applying a
capturing step instead of directly immobilizing the ligand, and
this will provide a higher quality of the sensorgrams due to
reduction in ligand heterogeneity. For optimal binding kinetics
at non-steady state, high levels of immobilized ligands should
be avoided as this introduces mass transport limitations (i.e.,
when analyte diffusion from the bulk solution to the surface is
much slower than the binding rate of analyte to the ligand). In
general, the maximum response from the analyte, Rmax, should
be as low as possible, preferable <20 RU, but this depends on
the mass of the analyte. The theoretical amount of ligand that
needs to be captured (in RU) to yield a given Rmax for the
subsequent analyte binding can be estimated if the molecular
mass of both ligand and the analyte and the stoichiometry are
known:
Capture level RU
ð
Þ ¼ Rmax  MWCaptured ligand
MWAnalyte

1
stoichiometry
16. For kinetic measurements, the ﬂow rate needs to be as high as
possible to reduce mass transfer limitations. For equilibrium
binding measurements, mass transfer is not an issue and the
ﬂow rate can be lowered to, e.g., 20 μL/min to save protein.
For non-steady-state kinetic measurements, the dissociation
Time is the Key—Kinetic Assessment of IDP Binding
625

time has to be long enough to provide enough curvature for
the ﬁt. In general, the dissociation curve should decrease at
least 5% to yield a reliable ﬁt of the dissociation phase. For
equilibrium binding measurements of weak interactions, the
dissociation time is less relevant.
17. If possible, run several cycles with buffer injections. The buffer
curves can be averaged, which provides a better reference for
buffer subtraction.
18. The analyte concentrations should preferably be between 0.1
and 10∗KD.
19. Prepare samples with the same buffer solution that is used as
running buffer on the Biacore instrument to minimize differ-
ences in the bulk refractive index upon sample injection.
20. The Method Builder itself adds a dead volume to each vial to
avoid insufﬁcient volumes. To be certain that there is enough
sample volume, we generally recommend to add approximately
10 μL excess of what the program suggests.
21. Air bubbles in the sample will give rise to spikes on the sensor-
gram and should be avoided. Make sure that no bubbles are
trapped at the bottom of the tube upon sample loading.
Remove any bubbles by giving the tubes a quick spin in a
benchtop centrifuge or ﬂick the vials.
22. A lower ﬂow rate during capture injection either reduces sam-
ple consumption or allows longer contact times resulting in
higher capture levels.
23. Check if the sensorgram reaches the same baseline as before
ligand injection to ensure removal of all ligand and analyte (see
Fig. 1a). Compare the level of captured ligand between two
sequentially run cycles to evaluate if the capture capacity of the
immobilized binding partner (in this case RAM) decreases as a
consequence of repeated regeneration. The supplier recom-
mends the use of 10 mM glycine-HCl pH 1.7 to regenerate
immobilized RAM, but the optimal regeneration conditions
are likely variable between different capturing principles and
need to be tested each time.
24. The sensorgrams should always be processed by double refer-
encing. First, the signal from the reference ﬂow cell is sub-
tracted to remove contributions from bulk refractive index and
potential nonspeciﬁc binding to the sensor chip surfaces. Sec-
ond, the buffer cycle is subtracted to compensate for any drift
in the system. Using the average from several buffer blanks may
yield a more reliable and consistent reference subtraction.
25. In most cases, the 1:1 binding model should be used. Other
models can be selected such as heterogeneous ligand or two-state
reaction; however, it is often preferred to apply the most simple
626
Julie M. Leth and Michael Ploug

model and instead optimize the experimental settings, e.g., to
avoid ligand heterogeneity.
26. The association phase should have at least some curvature
before the end of the analyte injection. Linear association
curves (constant velocity) are signs of a pronounced mass
transport limitation, and this needs to be corrected (either by
changing the setup with lower levels of captured ligand or by
implementing
mass
transport
limitation
in
the
ﬁtting
algorithm).
27. The report point should ideally be positioned where the
response is constant (i.e., only at steady-state binding). Low
response signal can cause some noise on the sensorgrams (see
Fig. 3b), and one should choose a broader time window for
averaging the signal.

ommend the website www.SPRpages.nl. The site contains a

mental setup, data ﬁtting, etc.

Measuring and Analyzing Binding Kinetics of Coupled
Folding and Binding Reactions Under Pseudo-First-Order
Conditions

Abstract
Many intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) adopt a well-deﬁned structure upon binding to their interac-
tion partners. Kinetic characterization is a requirement for the investigation of the dynamics and mechan-
isms of these folding-upon-binding reactions. Here a protocol is described for the investigation of binding
kinetics of bimolecular binding and folding reactions of IDPs to their ligand partner under pseudo-ﬁrst-
order conditions using stopped-ﬂow mixing and ﬂuorescence detection.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (IDPs) are
characterized by being largely unstructured in their free form; i.e.,
they constitute a large disordered conformational ensemble. Upon
binding to a ligand (e.g., a protein partner, ions, or a DNA mole-
cule), many IDPs are found to adopt a well-deﬁned structure. IDPs
and their associated coupled folding and binding reactions have
been identiﬁed as important in a number of eukaryotic regulatory
and signaling processes, although the fundamental advantage of
intrinsic disorder in cellular processes is still not fully understood
[1–3]. Kinetic characterization of the reactions is needed to address
issues of whether the ligand deﬁnes the fold of the IDP or if it
merely provides the necessary stability for the structure already
deﬁned by the polypeptide chain in the ensemble of the IDP.
Through a combination of kinetic experiments, mutagenesis, and
equilibrium measurements, it is possible to identify which parts of
the IDP that are recognized by the binding partner and to identify
the nature of the rate limiting transition state(s) involved [4–8].

Hereby, the dynamics and mechanisms of coupled folding and
binding can be addressed.
Two extreme reaction mechanisms for coupled folding and
binding reactions have been described: conformational selection
and folding after binding (Fig. 1). In conformational selection,
the folded conformation (N) of the IDP ensemble is selectively
bound to the partner (L), hereby pulling the equilibrium toward
the folded state. In contrast, in the mechanism of folding after
binding, the unstructured IDP (U) associates with the partner
(L) and adapts its fold in the complex (NL). The two mechanisms
are not mutually exclusive, as ﬂux through both pathways may
occur for the same reaction (parallel pathways) [9]. In addition, a
combination of the mechanisms where a part of an IDP with higher
propensity for secondary structure is selectively recognized by the
binding partner followed by folding after binding of the rest of the
Fig. 1 Thermodynamic box of a coupled folding and binding reaction of
U + L ⇌NL showing the two extreme routes. The folding equilibrium of IDPs
is shifted toward the unstructured state (U) (kf/ku < 1). Folding upon binding of
an IDP to a molecular partner (L) may follow one of two extreme mechanisms or
a combination of both, where the dominant route will depend on the reaction
conditions (the ﬂux through the pathways are modulated by the concentrations of
the reactants) [9, 10]. In the conformational selection mechanism, the folded
conformer is selectively bound to the ligand, hereby pulling the equilibrium of the
free IDP toward N. In the folding after binding mechanism, the unstructured
states of the IDP are bound to the ligand and folding takes place in the complex
with the ligand. For many IDPs, the dominant route appears to be folding after
binding [7, 16, 29]
630
Kristine Steen Jensen

IDP is also possible (serial coupling of the pathways schematized in
Fig. 1) [10].
This protocol describes how binding kinetics of coupled folding
and binding reactions can be investigated using stopped-ﬂow mixing
of reactants and optical detection of binding-complex formation.
Other rapid mixing techniques (e.g., continuous ﬂow or quench
ﬂow) or equilibrium perturbation methods (including temperature
or pressure jump and nuclear magnetic resonance–enhanced relaxa-
tion dispersion) may as well be applied to probe the kinetics.
Bimolecular association kinetics depends on the concentration
of both reactants (second-order reactions), but by keeping one
reactant in large excess over the other, pseudo-ﬁrst-order condi-
tions can be obtained. Hereby, reaction conditions are chosen such
that the concentration of the reactant in excess can be regarded as
constant over the full reaction time (Fig. 2). Under pseudo-ﬁrst-
order conditions, the reaction equation reduces to take the form of
U⇌X⇌NL
where X corresponds to the folded free state, N, in a conforma-
tional selection model and to the UL state in the folding-after-
binding model (Fig. 1). This will, in theory, result in biphasic
exponential kinetics as described by the function:
F ¼ A1  ekobs,1t þ A2  ekobs,2t þ F t!1
ð1Þ
where F is the signal, A1 and A2 are the amplitudes of the kinetic
phases, kobs,1 and kobs,2 are the observable rate constants, t is the
time, and Ft ! 1 is the signal at equilibrium. However, in many
cases of coupled folding and binding reactions, single exponential
kinetics is observed [4, 7, 11]. The result will depend on whether all
processes can be resolved in the given experiment or on whether
the intermediates are populated to a signiﬁcant degree during the
reaction [4, 12, 13]. In fact, coupled folding and binding reactions
following a conformational selection model will show single expo-
nential kinetics as the intermediate (N) is never signiﬁcantly popu-
lated since it is far less stable than the unstructured state (U) and the
folded state N is binding to the ligand (L) upon mixing. In addi-
tion, all steps may not give rise to a signal change; i.e., some steps
are spectroscopically silent. Even when only one kinetic phase is
observable in the experiment, the apparent rate constant, kobs, may
still show non-linearity with respect to the ligand concentration in
excess, which is indicative of more than one reaction step (Fig. 2c)
[4, 12]. In general, the observable rate constant(s) will both report
on both reaction steps (see Note 1) unless the kinetics of the two
steps differ by several orders of magnitude.
Analytical solutions to the rate equations for conformational
selection and folding-after-binding exist and may be used for ﬁtting
[14]. However, in many cases it can be an advantage to reduce the
Pseudo First Order Coupled Folding and Binding Kinetics
631

model complexity (see Note 2) (Fig. 2c). Alternatively, numerical
integration may be applied to solve the differential rate equations.
Simulation of the different mechanisms and their effect on the
observed kinetics is a valuable tool in the experimental design.

extrapolation from this experiment and better determined from a displacement experiment as described under
Subheading 3.5. (c) A plot of the observable rate constant(s) obtained under pseudo-ﬁrst-order with
[L]0  [U]0 against [L]0 can, both in the case of conformational selection and in folding after binding, give
an initial linear dependence of kobs on [L]0. The relation between the microscopic rate constants and the initial
slope is dependent on the reaction mechanism. Initial slopes are listed in blue in the ﬁgure. For ku  kon[L],
then kobs will approach kf in the mechanism of conformational selection. The shown equations are based on
the following assumptions (see Note 2): Conformational selection: NL is stable, koff  kon therefore koff ¼ 0,
pseudo-ﬁrst-order: [L]0  [U]0, d[L]/dt ¼ 0 and steady-state conditions for N are fulﬁlled for IDPs with
(kf  ku), d[N]/dt ¼ 0. Folding after binding: NL is stable, ku  kf therefore ku ¼ 0, pseudo-ﬁrst-order:
[L]0  [U]0, d[L]/dt ¼ 0 and steady state for UL, d[UL]/dt ¼ 0. When UL gets populated, the dependence on
[L] will no longer be linear [4, 12]
632
Kristine Steen Jensen

It can be difﬁcult to distinguish between the different reaction
mechanisms as both conformational selection and folding after
binding may result in single exponential kinetics, hyperbolic depen-
dence of kobs against [L]0, and also, within a narrow concentration
range, an apparent linear dependency of kobs with concentration
[L]0 (Fig. 2c) [4, 12, 14]. For coupled folding and binding reac-
tions, there are some assumptions that may be made which lead to
reduction of complexity (Fig. 2c). Therefore, in the design of
experiments, it is essential to critically evaluate the system; e.g., is
folding expected to be faster than dissociation? This is likely to be
the case if the IDP is small and the binding complex is stable
[4, 15]. On the other hand, if the IDP is large, folding can be
expected to be slower and most likely not a two-state process.
There are some clear features that, if observed, will identify one
mechanism to be dominating over the other. First, if kobs is
observed to decrease with increasing [L]0 and the associated signal
amplitude is found to increase with increasing [L]0, it is a charac-
teristic sign of a conformational selection mechanism [12, 14]. This
situation will only occur in a mechanism of conformational selec-
tion if association is fast compared to folding. Examples of this
behavior for IDPs are rare [16]. Secondly, only the folding after
binding mechanism can be symmetric with [U]0 and [L]0 under
pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions; i.e., if experiments are performed
ﬁrst with L in excess and then repeated with U in excess and
found to give similar results of kobs, then the reaction is following
a folding-after-binding mechanism [4, 14, 17]. Thirdly, the
folding-after-binding mechanism is the only one that can yield kon
directly from the slope of the pseudo-ﬁrst-order plot (Fig. 2c) (see
Note 2) [4]. This is observed when folding of the IDP in the
complex with L is much faster than the dissociation of U from the
complex [7, 17]. In contrast, in the conformational selection model
with ku  kon[L], the initial slope in the pseudo-ﬁrst-order plot is
kon  kf
ku, and usually for IDPs K f ¼ kf
ku  0:01, leading to a shal-
lower slope than the value of kon (Fig. 2c) (see Note 2). Therefore,
the gradient of the pseudo-ﬁrst-order plot may give hints on the
binding mechanism. If it is in the order of 107 M1s1 or higher, it
is unlikely to follow a conformational selection model, as the limit
for bi-molecular rate constants for site-speciﬁc diffusion-controlled
reactions is 109 M1s1. However, electrostatic steering may accel-
erate association leading to elevated association rate constants
[18]. Therefore, the experiments should be repeated under high
ionic strength conditions to screen any favorable electrostatic inter-
actions [17]. If the observed gradient, close to the diffusion limit,
in the pseudo-ﬁrst-order plot is insensitive to high ionic strength, a
mechanism of folding after binding is likely dominant.
As with any experiment, choosing the reaction conditions will
be a compromise between ideal settings and practical accessible

conditions, especially in terms of accessible concentrations and
choice of spectroscopic probes. In the protocol below, general
guidelines and suggestions are listed. However, each molecular
system will require individual assessment in order to optimize the
reaction conditions.
The following protocol is written for stopped-ﬂow experiments
of a reaction of the overall type U + L ⇌NL. Association kinetic
experiments are described under pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions with
initial concentrations of [L]0  [U]0 and with ﬂuorescence detec-
tion using an intrinsic probe. The experiments may equally well be
performed with [U]0  [L]0. In fact, applying both concentration
regimes may provide valuable information on the reaction mecha-
nism, as described above. Although for IDPs

following a conformational selection mechanism, it will require
very high concentrations of U to obtain pseudo-ﬁrst-order condi-
tions with N, and it is therefore recommendable to start with an
excess of the ligand if the binding mechanism is unknown. Simi-
larly, conjugated external ﬂuorescence probes such as ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) or Alexa-Fluor™dyes [6, 13] or other
detection modes (e.g., absorbance, CD, ﬂuorescence anisotropy,
or X-rays) can equally well replace the intrinsic ﬂuorophores and
ﬂuorescence detection in this protocol.
In investigations of the biological role of intrinsic disorder of
proteins, it is essential to identify the mechanism of coupled folding
and binding. When the described protocol has been applied to
determine the rate constants of association and dissociation, the
procedure can be used to extend the investigation to identify the
role of, e.g., electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and residual
secondary structure of the IDP by addition of salts and solvent
additives or through mutagenesis [6–8, 13, 19]. In addition, the
described experiments can be applied to characterize the nature of
the involved transition state(s) though phi-value analysis by com-
parison of the effect of mutations on the binding kinetics and
equilibrium [20–22].

Materials
2.1
Chemicals
and Reactants
All chemicals should be of spectroscopic grade, and care should be
taken to highly purify the IDP and ligand partner. Fluorescence
detection is very sensitive, which allows probing of small signal
changes upon binding and folding, but also puts high requirements
on the sample purity. Note that some plastic tubes may contribute
with ﬂuorescent contaminants. Therefore, glass beakers and sample
tubes should be used when possible.

The amounts of IDP and ligand needed for the experi-
ments will depend on the reaction studied as ﬂuorescence
signal changes, reaction kinetics, and complex stability all
determine the optimal reactant concentrations. Thus, it is difﬁ-
cult to list amounts of reactants and the given numbers are only
stated to give a rough indication of sample quantities. In gen-
eral, volumes of 2–10 mL of each reactant in a μM concentra-
tion range is needed.
Association kinetics:

Mw ¼ 3000, Kd ¼ 1 μM.
5. Puriﬁed ligand: if it is a macromolecule, then preferably lyo-
philized: Amount: ~25 mg for Mw ¼ 15 kDa, Kd ¼ 1 μM.
Note: the amounts needed will also depend on the associated
ﬂuorescent signal change.
Dissociation kinetics by displacement:
6. Puriﬁed IDP (preferable lyophilized): Amount: ~2 mg for
Mw ¼ 3000, Kd ¼ 1 μM.

20–100 mg for Mw ¼ 3000, Kd ¼ 1 μM. If less material is

from one mixing experiment with one high concentration of
competing ligand; see Subheading 3.5.

Method
3.1
Equilibrium
Measurements
Initial equilibrium measurements of the spectroscopic properties of
the reactants and product(s) should be made. The signal change
(if any) associated with complex formation should be identiﬁed.
This is done by recording of the individual ﬂuorescence emission
spectra of the reactants and of a combination of the two at the same
concentrations as in the free samples. Comparison of the product of
the individual spectra and the combined spectrum will reveal any
ﬂuorescence change as a result of complex formation. In this way,
ideal excitation and emission wavelengths can be picked and the
concentration range of reactants determined. Knowledge of the
binding constant (Kd) is important in choosing the reaction con-
ditions, as concentrations should be chosen to obtain a signiﬁcant
build-up of complex in order to obtain a signal change. In the text
below, the concentration of U and L (marked “X”) will depend on
the reaction to be studied.
1. Prepare 1 mL samples of X μM U and X μM L in a suitable
buffer system (see Note 3). The concentration, X, should be
chosen higher than Kd in order to get a signiﬁcant equilibrium
636

concentration of the complex (NL). Multiple concentrations
may be tested, based on the knowledge of the equilibrium
constant (Kd) and the ﬂuorescence properties (see Note 4).
Suggestion: For Kd around 1 μM, start by testing with a con-
centration, X, in the range of 2.5–10 μM.
2. Prepare a 1 mL sample of X μM U + X μM L. Leave the sample
to equilibrate for 10–30 min at the temperature chosen for the
later kinetic experiments. If an external ﬂuorescence probe is
conjugated to the sample (U or L), protect the sample from
light to avoid photobleaching of the ﬂuorophore.
3. Select an appropriate excitation wavelength (e.g., 275 nm for
tyrosine and 280 nm for tryptophan) and record the emission
spectra of all three samples. Multiple excitation wavelengths
may be tested by an excitation scan. Typically, an excitation
wavelength near the absorption maximum should be applied to
get maximum sensitivity in the experiments. However, since
the Stokes shift of tyrosine in proteins (the difference between
maximum of excitation and emission) might be small, an exci-
tation wavelength slightly shorter than the maximum might be
chosen for the stopped-ﬂow experiment (e.g. 270 nm) [23].
4. Compare the emission spectra and calculate the difference
spectrum between the sum of the individual spectra of L and
U and the spectrum of the combined sample of L + U, which
has equilibrated to form NL. Hereby the optimal conditions
for the stopped-ﬂow experiment can be identiﬁed.
5. If complex formation is only associated with a minor signal
change, tryptophan residue(s) or an external probe should be
incorporated; see references [13, 23] for further information on
the use of external ﬂuorescence probes. Acceptable signal
change will depend on the noise level of the experiment, the
reaction kinetics, and the dead time of the stopped-ﬂow instru-
ment (see Note 5). Fast reactions need to be associated with a
larger signal change than slower reactions to be resolved. As the
rate of the bimolecular reaction will depend on the concentra-
tions of reactants, it will, in many cases, not be possible just to
increase the concentrations if the reaction is associated with a
subtle signal change.
3.2
Instrument Setup
for Stopped-Flow
Mixing Experiments
When setting up, consult the manual of your speciﬁc instrument.
The points below are general guidelines. The outline of a stopped-
ﬂow instrument is illustrated in Fig. 3.
1. Mount the right drive syringes. Recommendation is to start
with a 1:1 (volume:volume) mixing of the two reactants
(2.5 mL syringes). Make sure that they are tightly sealed.
2. Mount the correct ram for the chosen syringes.
3. Mount the stop syringe (typical 1 mL).
Pseudo First Order Coupled Folding and Binding Kinetics
637

4. Adjust the sample volume to be mixed in each measurement.
Suggestion: for a 20 μL observation chamber, use minimum
40 μL of each reactant, better 60 μL (i.e., 120 μL drive vol-
ume). This is to minimize artifacts from aged solution and from
back diffusion from the observation chamber into the mixer.
5. Set the excitation slits on the monochromator. Consult the
manual and inspect the observed signals for artifacts.
6. Place a suitable cut-off ﬁlter in front of the detector. This will
ﬁlter out scattered light. Suggestion: 295 nm for tyrosine
(ex. 270 nm) and 320 nm for tryptophan (ex. 280 nm). The
emission wavelength of tryptophan residues is very sensitive to
the molecular environment and the solvent conditions. Choos-
ing a relatively short wavelength cut-off ﬁlter insures that the
tryptophan emission is detected.
7. Turn on the lamp. If a Xenon-arc-lamp is used, it needs to heat
up to provide a stable signal. Let it heat up for around 30 min
before start.
8. Turn on the electronics and the computer.
9. Turn on the external water bath if temperature control is
applied.

Fig. 3 Schematic representation of a stopped-ﬂow instrument. The two solutions each containing one of the
reactants are ﬁlled into the drive syringes through the outer syringes. The pistons of the drive syringes are
moved rapidly for a ﬁxed distance deﬁned by the stop-syringe by applying a certain pressure to the system.
Hereby the solutions are rapidly mixed. When the ﬂow is stopped, the reaction can be observed by optical
spectroscopy (here illustrated for ﬂuorescence). When the next transient is recorded, the old solution from the
observation chamber is pushed into the stop syringe. The dead time of the instrument is the time interval from
mixing (start of the reaction, t ¼ 0) and until the reaction can be observed. The dead time is dependent on the
setup and on the reactant solutions, and preferentially it should be as small as possible, often in the order of
1.0–2.5 ms

10. If mixing is driven by gas, turn on the gas supply and adjust the
pressure according to the chosen syringes (consult the instru-
ment manual).
11. Fill the outer syringes with degassed water and mount them on
the instrument. Hint: Reduce the risk of introducing air bub-
bles by ﬁlling the top inlet with solution before mounting the
outer syringe.
12. Fill the drive syringes with water (see Note 6).
13. Fill the reaction tubing and cell with water. This can be done
manually to ﬂush with a larger volume of water or automatic.
14. The procedure (steps 11–13) is repeated for the other drive
syringe.
15. Make multiple automatic mixings and inspect that the system is
not leaking (see Note 7).
16. Fill the water bath around the drive syringes and let the tem-
perature equilibrate.
3.3
Sample
Preparations
for Stopped-Flow
Mixing Experiments
1. Start by preparing stock solutions of the reactants by dissolving
the lyophilized protein in the reaction buffer; see the individual
protocols for association and dissociation kinetics experiments
below (Subheading 3.4, step 1 and Subheading 3.5, step 1).
2. Filter the solutions through 0.22 μm ﬁlters. Rinse the ﬁlters
with buffer before use, to remove any additives from the man-
ufacturer. After ﬁltrating the sample, rinse the syringe and ﬁlter
with small amounts of buffer to recover as much as possible of
the samples. In the end, air may be pressed through the ﬁlter to
empty it from sample, but take care not to create too much
protein foam and hereby protein denaturation.
3. Determine the concentration by absorbance (when possible,
otherwise alternative strategies must be employed to determine
the protein concentrations (see Note 8)). Carefully inspect the
full UV-absorbance spectrum (240–360 nm) to evaluate sam-
ple integrity. Especially, look for any light scattering from
aggregates; typically this will result in a shoulder on the tyro-
sine/tryptophan absorbance spectrum.
4. Check the pH of the stock solutions. If necessary, adjust the pH
with small amounts of acid/base and remeasure the concentra-
tion(s). Note, it should not be necessary to adjust the
pH. Drifts in pH indicate that the buffer capacity is either too
low or that the samples are not pure. Dialysis against the chosen
buffer instead of titration with acid/base will, in most cases, be
a better strategy although it is more time-consuming.

5. Degas the reactant samples, buffer (~100 mL), and water
(~100 mL) e.g. by placing a stirring bar in each sample and
placing them under vacuum in a vacuum desiccator on top of
the magnetic stirrer. Degas for ~20 min or until no air bubbles
are visible.
3.4
Association
Kinetics Under
Pseudo-First-Order
Conditions
Multiple traces at each concentration of [L]0 should be recorded to
reduce noise and to be able to identify traces with mixing artifacts
(see Note 9).
1. Prepare 15 mL of [U]0 around 5 μM and 5 mL of
[L]0 ¼ 200 μM for a system with Kd around 1 μM as described
under Subheading 3.3. However, concentrations should be
picked based on the equilibrium measurements and the signal
changes associated with the speciﬁc reaction.
2. Prepare a dilution series of the reactant in excess (L). Minimum
5 different concentrations where the lowest concentration is
10 times higher than the concentration of the other reactant
(U). Prepare at least 2.5 mL, better 3 mL, of each of the L
solutions and minimum 10 mL of the U solution, better
15 mL. The amount of sample necessary will depend on the
signal change associated with complex formation and the kinet-
ics. When a very small signal change is observed, multiple
kinetic traces need to be averaged to improve the signal to
noise ratio (see Note 9). Suggestion: 5/2.5 μM U and
50/25, 75/37.5, 100/50, 150/75, and 200/100 μM L
(syringe/reaction concentration) for Kd ¼ 1 μM (see Note 10).
3. Replace the water in both drive syringes with buffer. This is
done by ﬁrst washing the drive syringes with buffer three times
by ﬁlling and emptying with buffer before the ﬁnal ﬁlling.
4. Mix up and down a few times (between the drive syringes and
outer syringes) to make sure any remaining solution of the
drive syringes is mixed with the new buffer solution and let
the buffer sample equilibrate to the temperature of the water
bath around the drive syringes.
5. Fill the reaction tubing and cell with buffer.
6. Now the software should be set for the desired measurements
(consult the manual). For ﬂuorescent measurements, pick the
excitation wavelength (suggestion: 270 nm for tyrosine and
280 nm for tryptophan). Adjust the voltage of the photomul-
tiplier (use the auto-level option and note the voltage). Select a
long recording time (e.g., 10 s or longer) and set the number of
data points. Preferably distribute the data points with a loga-
rithmic distribution to get enough data points in the beginning
of the kinetic traces (Figs. 2 and 4).
640
Kristine Steen Jensen

7. Record several traces and inspect them before averaging. The
traces should be constant with time and stable (if not, see Note
11). Multiple traces can be averaged to increase the signal to
noise.
8. Select one drive syringe for L and one for U. Note that the tube
lengths from the two drive syringes to the observation chamber
might be different. Pick the shortest tube length for the reac-
tant in excess as this will save material.
9. When applying the reactant solutions, ﬁrst empty the inner
syringe for buffer by pressing it out to the outer syringe and
then ﬁll the drive syringe with a little amount of sample solu-
tion to wash the inlet of the drive syringe.
10. Start by ﬁlling U into one drive syringe as described for buffer
and water. Make sure to wash the drive syringe with solution
before the ﬁnal ﬁlling. If possible, ﬁll all reactant of a given
concentration into the outer syringe and mix up and down
several times when ﬁlling the drive syringe. This ensures a
uniform mixing of reactant solution with any remaining solu-
tion of the previous step and will ensure a constant concentra-
tion of reactant over all measurements. Let the sample
equilibrate to the temperature of the water bath around the
drive syringes.
11. Fill the reaction tubing and cell with U. Observe that the
ﬂuorescence signal gets constant with time.
12. Adjust the photomultiplier voltage and note the voltage.
Fig. 4 Data collection. The two plots compare the transient of a bi-exponential
reaction with a fast phase (kobs,1 ¼ 550 s1) and a slow phase (kobs,2 ¼ 55 s1)
associated with a signal amplitude, A2, of 0.3 times the amplitude, A1, of the fast
phase, when the data points are distributed linearly (top) or with a logarithmic
time base (bottom). The time scales are identical in the two panels. Collecting
more data points in the beginning (log time base distribution) ensures that fast
reactions or reactions involving multiple processes on different time scales can
be characterized in the same transient. A dashed vertical line indicates the dead
time of 1.5 ms. A large part of the signal amplitude of fast reactions may be lost
within the dead time. Hereby the observable signal change ΔFobs, will be much
lower than the signal amplitude (A1 + A2)
Pseudo First Order Coupled Folding and Binding Kinetics
641

13. Record traces mixing U with buffer. The traces should be
constant with time (see Note 11).
14. Empty the drive syringe with buffer and replace it with L. Start
with the lowest concentration of L. Let the sample equilibrate
to the temperature of the water bath around the drive syringes.
15. Fill L in the tubing and in the observation chamber. Follow the
signal until constant traces are obtained.
16. Record the ﬁrst trace of mixing L and U and adjust the photo-
multiplier voltage again. Ideally this value should be kept for all
concentrations of L allowing the signal amplitudes to be com-
pared. It may turn out that it needs to be adjusted at the
highest concentrations of L. If so, make a note and start at a
lower voltage next time the experiments are performed.
Continue with step 17 of the protocol to determine the
optimal reaction time and distribution of data points when the
reaction is studied for the ﬁrst time. Otherwise continue from
step 20.
17. Keep the long recording time (>10 s).
18. Record several traces of mixing L with U and take the average
to improve the signal to noise ratio (see Note 9).
19. Fit Eq. 1 to the kinetic traces to ﬁnd the optimal reaction time
and distribution of data points (see Note 12). Identify how
many phases (exponentials) that are necessary to describe the
data. It is critical to evaluate the ﬁtting residuals to identify any
systematic errors pointing to more kinetic phases. A phase is
best described if the recording time is minimum ﬁve times the
time constant, τ (e.g., for kobs ¼ 25 s1 and τ ¼ kobs
1 ¼ 0.04 s,
choose a recording time of approx. 200 ms). If several kinetic
phases are observed, distribution of the data points on a
logarithmic-time base will insure enough data points on the
short timescale (Fig. 4).
20. In the software, set the optimal timescale and distribution of
data point to best describe the reaction(s).
21. Acquire multiple kinetic traces for every concentration of L (see
Note 9).
22. Replace L with the next concentration of the series and repeat
steps 20–21. Make sure to save any unused reactant solution in
a clean beaker (see Note 13). Always start with the lowest
concentration and measure the concentration series in order
of increasing concentration. Hereby, minor contamination of
the solution with the previous solution will lead to the lowest
perturbation of concentration (see Note 13).
23. When all combinations of [L]0 and [U]0 are measured, replace
U with buffer. Make sure to clean at least three times with
buffer before ﬁlling. Let the samples equilibrate to the temper-
ature of the water bath around the drive syringes.
642
Kristine Steen Jensen

24. Record traces of L mixing with buffer. These should be con-
stant with time (see Note 11).
25. At the end of the experiment ﬁrst clean everything with water,
then with 70% ethanol. Use the ﬂuorescence signal to evaluate
that the tubing and reaction chamber is clean.
26. Fit Eq.1 to the data (see Notes 12 and 14).
27. Plot the determined kobs values as function of [L]0 and ﬁt an
appropriate model to the data to determine the microscopic
rate constants as discussed in the introduction (Fig. 2, see
Note 2).
28. A complementary strategy is global ﬁtting of the data acquired
at different concentrations either to the analytical solutions of
the rate equations [14] or by directly ﬁtting to the differential
equations of the proposed reaction models by numerical
integration [12].
3.5
Dissociation
Kinetics by
Displacement Under
Pseudo-First-Order
Conditions
Dissociation kinetics is best measured by a displacement reaction
when stopped-ﬂow mixing is applied, as it is difﬁcult in these
experiments to dilute enough to reach a regime where kobs is
dominated by koff [12]. For this purpose, a competing reactant,
U* or L*, should be mixed with the pre-formed complex, NL. The
simpliﬁed reaction scheme, where the UL and U*L complexes are
not populated, is given by:
NL⇌U þ L þ U∗⇌N∗L
It is important that formation of the displacement complex
(N*L) is associated with a different total signal change than the
formation of the NL complex. This can be achieved by mutagenesis
(e.g., substitute tryptophan with tyrosine or vice versa and detect
tryptophan ﬂuorescence in the experiment) or if external probes are
used by displacement with the non-labelled IDP. Notably, when an
IDP follows a folding-after-binding mechanism upon association
with a ligand, dissociation of the formed complex will follow a
conformational selection type of mechanism where the IDP unfolds
before it dissociates from the low-populated UL intermediate
[4, 24]. Therefore, the determined koff from the displacement will
be an apparent koff value, unless the mechanism of dissociation from
the NL complex to a good approximation is a 2-state reaction. By
keeping U* in large excess over L, pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions for
the displacement reaction is maintained. Hereby, conditions where
the effective dissociation of the NL complex is rate limiting can be
reached.
1. Prepare a sample of the NL complex. If a U-analogue (U*) is
used to dissociate the NL complex, use tenfold excess of U over
L when forming the NL complex, and [U] > Kd. E.g., prepare
12.5 mL of 5 μM L + 50 μM U for Kd ¼ 1 μM, and let the
Pseudo First Order Coupled Folding and Binding Kinetics
643

sample equilibrate to form the NL complex. If instead an
L-analogue (L*) is used, L should be in excess over U in the
reaction. This insures that the free concentration of the reac-
tant binding to the displacement reactant is very low at the
beginning of the experiment. The sample should be ﬁltrated
through a 0.22 μm ﬁlter and degassed before the measure-
ments, as described in Subheading 3.3.
2. Prepare, e.g., ﬁve solutions with different concentrations of U*
(or L*) (see Note 15). Preferably three of the concentrations
should be so high that the displacement binding reaction will
not be rate limiting in the experiment (see Note 15). In princi-
ple, the apparent dissociation rate constant may be determined
from just one reaction with large excess of U* (or L*), but it
will be difﬁcult to know if the chosen concentration of displace-
ment reactant is high enough. Therefore, it is better to measure
at several different concentrations of displacement reactant and
then ﬁt Eq. 2 to the data (see step 9). All samples should be
ﬁltrated through a 0.22 μm ﬁlter and degassed before the
measurements.
3. Set up the instrument similarly to the procedure described in
Subheading 3.3, but if dictated by the reaction kinetics and
the accessible concentrations use drive syringes resulting in mix-
ing volume ratios of 1:10 instead of 1:1 (see Note 16).
4. Fill buffer into both drive syringes as described in Subheading
3.4, steps 1–6.
Fig. 5 Dissociation kinetics by displacement. (a) Synthetic data for mixing of preformed NL (4.8/2.4 μM), L 0.2/
0.1 μM, and U 45/22.5 μM (in one drive syringe) with U* (200/100, 400/200, 800/400, 2000/1000, 3200/
1600, 4000/2000 μM) (in the other drive syringe) with kon ¼ 1  106 M1s1, koff,apparent ¼ 1 s1,
kon* ¼ 1  106 M1s1, and koff,apparent* ¼ 10 s1. In this example Kd ¼ 1 μM for the NL complex and
Kd* ¼ 10 μM for N*L complex. (b) kobs as function of the concentration of displacement reactant U*. When the
rate constant for dissociation of the N*L complex is higher than the rate constant for dissociation of the NL
complex, kobs will decrease with increasing concentration of the displacement reactant, [U*]0 (Eq. 2)
644
Kristine Steen Jensen

5. Fill the NL solution into one drive syringe.
6. Fill the U* (or L*) solution into the other drive syringe. Start
with the lowest concentration of U*.
7. Record several traces at each concentration of U∗and take the
average of the traces.
8. Fit an appropriate exponential function to the data (Eq. 1).
When dissociation follows a two-step mechanism, the kinetics
will be bi-exponential, but one phase might only be resolved in
the experiment (single-exponential kinetics are observed).
9. Plot kobs values as a function of [U*]. Equation 2 describes
how the observed rate constant depends on the concentration
of displacement reactant under pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions
with [U*]  [L] and under the assumption of steady state of
[L] (e.g. d[L]/dt ¼ 0) [25]:
kobs ¼ koff,apparent

The observed rate constant, kobs, will reach a limiting value
corresponding to the dissociation rate constant, koff,apparent,
when dissociation of the NL complex becomes rate limiting
in the displacement reaction at high [U*] (Fig. 5). The observ-
able rate constant, kobs, at lower [U*]0, where dissociation of
the NL complex is not rate limiting, may either be lower or
higher than koff,apparent [12, 26]. This depends on whether the
N*L complex dissociates slower or faster than the NL complex
as the y-axis intercept corresponds to koff,apparent*.

Notes
1. If two kinetic phases are observed, both will hold information
about the two steps of the 3-state reaction. The same is the case
if just one phase is observable. This means that the system is
underdetermined, i.e., having the observable rate constants
alone does not provide sufﬁcient information to determine
the four microscopic rate constants. For that, it should be
determined how kobs varies with reactant concentration and
interpretation

3. When selecting an appropriate buffer system for the desired
reaction, care should be taken to pick a buffer that does not
absorb or is not ﬂuorescent at the wavelength used for detec-
tion in the kinetic experiment.

4. High concentration of the ﬂuorophore may lead to signiﬁcant
absorbance or scattering of the excitation light and of the
emitted light. This leads to a decrease in signal intensity called
the inner ﬁlter effect [23]. The higher the concentration the
more pronounced is the effect. To minimize inner ﬁlter effects,
it is recommendable to choose as short a light path as possible
with the given observation chamber.
5. The dead time of a stopped-ﬂow instrument is the time
between initiation of the reaction and the ﬁrst reliable measure-
ment of signal amplitude (Figs. 2a and 4). The dead time
should be determined under similar conditions used for the
experiment, the ﬁrst time a system is investigated. That is, with
the same mixing setup (volumes and pressure), tubing length,
observation cell, and temperature. The dead time may be
determined by studying a well-characterized bimolecular reac-
tion under pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions, e.g., following the
absorbance
change
associated
with
the
reduction
of
2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) with ascorbic acid)
[27]. Only data points acquired at time points longer than
the dead time should be included in the analysis.
6. Filling of drive syringes is best done by slowly pressing the
solution in by pressing on the piston of the outer syringe and
simultaneously gently moving down the piston of the drive
syringe with the other hand. Let the solution rest inside the
drive syringe for a minute to let any air bobbles ﬂoat to the top.
Then press out any air by rapidly moving the piston of the drive
syringe and at the same time support the outer syringe with the
other hand. This procedure may be repeated until all air is
removed. Fill the drive syringes and make sure the pistons are
at the same height and in contact with the ram.
7. If the system leaks from the drive syringes, remove the pistons
and gently but ﬁrmly tap the Teﬂon packing against the table
top. This will widen the diameter slightly. Alternatively replace
the pistons. It is a good idea to test the system with water to see
if it is tight and to keep all connections dry to localize a
potential leak before ﬁlling the water-bath around the observa-
tion chamber and drive syringes etc. The test is done by mixing
and keeping the drive pressure for ~1 s while observing that the
signal and the drive pistons are stable. Note that this test should
be repeated after changing the temperature. Especially low
temperatures may lead to leakage. The system should be tight
before samples are ﬁlled into the drive syringes.
8. Alternative methods for determination of protein concentra-
tion, when the protein does not contain an UV-absorbing
probe (Tryptophan, Tyrosine, or artiﬁcial conjugated), include
quantitative amino acid determination (most accurate) and
Pseudo First Order Coupled Folding and Binding Kinetics
647

UV-absorbance at 205 nm (peptide bond) and some colori-
metric assays, e.g., Biuret or Bradford, might also be applicable
depending on the length of the peptide [28].
9. Suggestion: somewhere between 10 and 20 traces. Higher
numbers of traces will only result in a small improvement.
The number will depend on the signal to noise ratio, which
again will depend on the probe(s), the signal change upon
reaction, the rate of reaction, and hereby the observable change
in signal (Figs. 2a and 4). For very fast reactions, there will be a
large amplitude loss during the dead time of the instrument
(Fig. 4). This means that at the higher reactant concentrations,
more curves are needed to obtain the same signal to noise ratio
as at lower [L]0 [12].
10. Keep track of the reactant concentrations. This is best done by
noting both the concentration in the drive syringe and in the
reaction chamber in the laboratory journal (e.g., with 1:1
(volume: volume) mixing of reagents: [L]0 ¼ 100/50 μM
and [U]0 ¼ 5/2.5 μM).
11. If deviation from a constant signal upon mixing one solution
with itself (e.g. water with water) is observed, the reason
should be uncovered. It may arise from air bubbles in the
observation chamber or in the tubing. Another possibility
when the samples are mixed with buffer is photobleaching
especially when conjugated external probes are used. Oligo-
merization or aggregation of the IDP (or the ligand) may also
lead to a time dependence of the signal upon mixing with
buffer as oligomers dissociates.
12. Note that the observed phases might be positive or negative.
Start with just one phase by setting A2 and kobs,2 to zero in
Eq. 1, unless it is clearly evident that multiple phases are
present. Inspect the ﬁtting residuals to identify any systematic
deviations, as this is indicative of additional phases. It might be
necessary to include a linear term (c t). This may either
originate from a very slow exponential phase or from photo-
bleaching (see Note 14). It is important to cut the recorded
data so only data points recorded after the dead-time of the
instrument is included (see Note 5).
13. Save the remaining reactant solution (U or L) in a clean tube
when removing it from the drive syringes. The concentration
of this solution should be determined by absorbance at 280 nm
in a spectrophotometer. This will give an exact measure of the
concentration in the reaction and hereby quantify any dilution
caused by ﬁlling into the drive syringes.
14. Discrimination between a slow kinetic phase and photobleach-
ing can be made by comparison of kinetic traces recorded with
the shutter open (normal procedure) to kinetic traces recorded
648
Kristine Steen Jensen

with the shutter closed for a while during the reaction. The
observed phase is due to photobleaching if the signal change is
not observed when the reaction is left in the dark for the main
part of the reaction period.
15. If the displacement reactant (U* or L*) is not ﬂuorescent, the
concentration of the stock solution will be more difﬁcult to
determine (see Note 8). However, this is in principle not a
problem as long as high enough concentrations are chosen to
obtain identical kobs at, e.g., three different concentration of
[U*]0 or [L*]0 as this value will correspond to koff,apparent
(Fig. 5).
16. If possible with the given molecular system, it is better to keep
a 1:1 mixing volume ratio as mixing artifacts are less likely.
However, when kon* is low, there is need for high concentra-
tions of U*, in order to obtain conditions where koff, the
dissociation rate constant from the NL complex, is rate limiting
in the displacement reaction. This may dictate a 1:10 mixing
volume ratio to avoid self-association or aggregation of U* in
the drive syringe.

Understanding Binding-Induced Folding
by Temperature Jump

and Stefano Gianni
Abstract
Temperature jump is a powerful technique for the characterization of fast kinetics and can be readily
employed to understand both binding and folding reactions. Here we summarize brieﬂy a temperature-
jump prototypical experiment between an intrinsically disordered protein and its physiological partner. The
model used is the NTAIL domain from Measles virus Nucleoprotein and its natural ligand, the globular PXD
domain from Measles virus Phosphoprotein. We recapitulate how to set up the experiment and how to
analyze data in order to extract the kinetic parameters of the reaction.

Introduction
Fast relaxation techniques are based on the principle that, by rapidly
perturbing a physical parameter of a system at equilibrium, like
temperature or pressure [1, 2], it is possible to monitor the kinetics
of the relaxation process of the system without changing its chemi-
cal composition. In the temperature-jump methodology, a rapid
heating of a solution is achieved by a high-voltage discharge
through an observation cell. The increase in temperature typically
perturbs the equilibrium of the system, and the relaxation to a new
equilibrium may be thus observed. In comparison to mixing tech-
niques, such as the stopped-ﬂow, a temperature-jump apparatus
possesses much shorter dead times, being able to resolve kinetics
of reactions occurring in the μs time range (versus 1–2 ms dead
time of stopped-ﬂow). This characteristic makes temperature-jump
methodology particularly useful to resolve very rapid reaction
kinetics.
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) represent a large class
of proteins that lack a deﬁned three-dimensional structure when

(s) [3]. Binding reactions involving IDPs often show fast associa-
tion and dissociation rate constants [4, 5], making temperature-
jump technique a suitable method to resolve IDP binding kinetics
[6–9].
Here we recapitulate an experimental protocol of a typical
temperature-jump binding experiment followed by ﬂuorescence
emission. We exemplify this methodology by using a previously
characterized interaction [7], the binding-induced folding mecha-
nism of an IDP, the Measles Virus NTAIL protein, to its natural
ligand, the globular XD domain of the Phosphoprotein P (PXD).
PXD is a globular protein composed of three α-helices while NTAIL is
a long IDP that contains a short sequence called a Molecular
Recognition Element (MoRE) [10], which undergoes a disorder-
to-order transition upon binding with PXD. The interaction
between these two proteins leads to the formation of a small
α-helix in NTAIL ﬂanked by long disordered tails on the N- and
C-terminal sides [6, 10].

Materials
All the buffers must be prepared with ultrapure water, and all the
reagents must be of analytical grade. There are no constraints on
the chemical nature of the buffer, nor on the pH, as long as the
proteins used in the experiments are known to be stable at the
chosen conditions. For experiments based on intrinsic tryptophan
ﬂuorescence change upon binding, N-Acetyl-L-tryptophanamide
(NATA) can be dissolved in the same buffer and used for calibration
and control experiments. To ensure the conductivity of electricity
of the solution, in order to obtain an efﬁcient jump of temperature
during the experiments, it is critical that the ionic strength of the
buffer used is at least 100 mM.

Methods
To exemplify how to set up a temperature-jump binding experi-
ment and acquire and analyze data, we will consider a typical
binding experiment of a protein system that we have studied exten-
sively in the past, the PXD-NTAIL protein complex from Measles
virus (MeV). We will show the protocol of a binding kinetic experi-
ment performed with a PTJ-64 capacitor-discharge T-jump appa-
ratus (TgK Scientiﬁc) in which PXD was the protein kept at constant
concentration (2 μM) while varying the concentration of NTAIL,
which was in excess (from 4 to 40 μM). The software used to
acquire and analyze kinetic data is Kinetic Studio (TgK Scientiﬁc).

3.1
Protein Samples
Preparation
1. Prepare two protein stock solutions of approximately 10 ml of
volume, the ﬁrst one with the PXD protein that will be kept at
constant concentration (2 μM) during the entire binding
experiment, and the second one containing a mixture of PXD-
NTAIL, with PXD at the concentration of 2 μM and NTAIL at the
highest concentration that is planned to be explored during the
experiment (40 μM).
2. Start the experiment from the highest concentration of NTAIL
and then use the two stock solutions to obtain the desired ﬁnal
concentration of NTAIL. Sample volume should be at least 3 ml.
3. Once the sample is prepared, transfer the solution into a
5–10 ml disposable plastic syringe.
4. To reduce the probability of formation of air bubbles in the
mixing chamber of the T-jump apparatus, it is recommended to
use degassed buffers to prepare protein stock solutions (see
Note 1).
5. The observation cell (Fig. 1) is accessible through two Luer
connectors. Before performing the ﬁrst jump, the cell should
be found ﬁlled with ultrapure water and with both the con-
nectors occupied by water-containing syringes. Remove the
water by taking out one of the syringes and gently pulling the
plunger of the other. Once all the liquid is removed from the
cell, insert the sample-containing syringe in one of the connec-
tors and gently push the sample, until the solution starts to
drop from the other syringe connector. At this point, to avoid
any pressure stress on the delicate structure of the cell, it is
recommended to connect a second syringe at the other connec-
tor and to pull the plunger simultaneously to the sample
pushing.
After the injection of the sample, the instrument optics have to
be set up.
3.2
Setup
of the Instrument
Optics
1. Set monochromator to the desired excitation wavelength.
2. Place the appropriate cut-off or bandpass ﬁlter in the optical
system coupled to the photodetector, to select the desired
ﬂuorescence spectrum to be collected (see Note 2).
3. Slowly increase the voltage of the photomultiplier unit, until a
change in the ﬂuorescence signal can be appreciated on the live
monitor. Set the voltage to a level corresponding to 50–60% of
the full scale. It is important to check that the ﬂuorescence
signal on the monitor is steady. Changes in the ﬂuorescence
signal over minutes may be due to protein photolysis/degra-
dation, reduction of lamp stability, and lack of efﬁciency in
temperature control of the observation cell.

Once the optics of the system are set, it is possible to turn on
the discharge unit of the instrument and perform temperature
jumps.
3.3
Setup
of Discharge Unit
The discharge unit provides the high voltage electricity that let the
temperature of the sample jump instantaneously. A manual knob on
the front panel of the unit gives the possibility to change the voltage
of the current and, consequently, the temperature jump (see Note
3). We suggest setting up a discharge of 12 kV that in ideal con-
ductivity conditions (ionic strength of the solution ~100 mM)
corresponds in an increase of the temperature of the sample of
~9 C.

Temperature-Jump
Experiment: Data
Acquisition
and Analysis
In kinetic experiments, it is fundamental to choose an appropriate
time window in which the kinetic trace will be recorded. In fact,
acquisition time has to be long enough for the reaction to allow
relaxation to the new equilibrium, letting the experimentalist prop-
erly analyze the kinetic trace describing the reaction. To do so, if the
protein system has never been analyzed through kinetic experi-
ments, the ﬁrst jumps are performed in order to deﬁne the proper
acquisition time of traces for the speciﬁc protein.
Tryptophan ﬂuorescence decreases as the temperature of the
solution in which it is dissolved increases, with different responses

depending on the buffer chemical composition [11]. When the
experiment is based on monitoring tryptophan ﬂuorescence change
upon binding, an additional control step is recommended—mea-
suring the ﬂuorescence intensity change of N-acetyl-L-tryptophan
amide (NATA) as the jump is triggered. By setting up a pre-trigger
acquisition time, the instrument measures and records the ﬂuores-
cence emitted by the sample before the jump occurs. A 20–100 ms
acquisition of temperature jump of a NATA solution (at the con-
centration of 10–20 μM) should return a trace with an initial
decrease of ﬂuorescence occurring in 100–200 μs, in which ampli-
tude is proportional to the degrees of the jump, followed by a
linear, steady emission of ﬂuorescence.

T-Jump Experiments in IDP
655

1. Open the Control Panel to set up the software and prepare it to
acquire traces.
2. At ﬁrst, it is recommended to perform a single jump to check
that the instrument is correctly set up and no air bubbles are
present in the observation cell. Usually when this happens,
artifacts such as unexpected peaks of ﬂuorescence emission
are recorded. To remove bubbles from the observation cell, it
is possible to gently push a little amount of the sample from one
of the syringes. If this operation does not solve the problem, it
is recommended to completely remove the sample from the
observation cell and repeat the manual degassing process.
3. When 2–3 single jumps return reproducible kinetic traces,
sequential jumps should be set up in the Control Panel of the
software. It is recommended to perform, at least, ten sequential
jumps (Fig. 2a) to be subsequently averaged. The time between
one jump and the following has to be set to let the sample in the
observation cell cool down and reach the chosen starting
Fig. 3 The analysis control panel gives the user the chance to calculate kinetic parameters by ﬁtting the
average trace obtained with different equations. In the case of a single exponential reaction, at this point of the
ﬁtting process, the software estimates three kinetic parameters: A that corresponds to the amplitude of the
trace, C, the ﬁnal ﬂuorescence value, and R that represents the observed rate constant of the reaction. It is
possible to change the time range of the trace to be analyzed in order to improve quality of the ﬁtting process

temperature (45–60 s). All the traces have to be checked to be
consistent and reproducible.
4. Extract the average by selecting the average trace on the left
panel (Fig. 2a) and then clicking on the Tools ! Extract menu
(Fig. 2b).

where A is the amplitude of the trace (the difference between
the initial and ﬁnal ﬂuorescence signal), kobs is the observed rate
constant of the reaction, t is time in seconds, and c is the ﬁnal
ﬂuorescence signal. At ﬁrst, the curve analysis program returns
estimations of these kinetic parameters (Fig. 3).
The software allows changing the time range of the ﬁtting
curve to improve the quality of the ﬁt, and, in particular, to exclude
from the ﬁtting process the decrease in ﬂuorescence of tryptophan
due to the temperature jump (100–200 μs). By clicking “Fit and
Close,” the program calculates the kinetic parameters (Fig. 4).

of the syringes while gently pulling the sample solution with
the other. Repeat the experiment at different concentrations of
NTAIL.

Analysis of kobs
Dependence
in Pseudo-First-Order
Binding Experiments
A simple two-state binding mechanism between two species A and
B can be summarized by the equation
A þ B⇄AB
where AB represents the complex of the two species. In this sce-
nario, if pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions are always satisﬁed during
the binding experiment, i.e., one of the two reactant has to be in
large excess (at least ﬁve times the concentration) compared to the
other, the observed rate constants kobs measured at different con-
centrations of the specie in excess will follow a linear dependence
(Fig. 5a) that can be described by the following equation:
kobs ¼ kon B
½  þ koff
where B is the ligand in excess, kon represents the microscopic
association rate constant, corresponding to the slope of the linear
function, and koff, extrapolated as y-axis intercept, the microscopic
dissociation rate constant (for a brief discussion about direct calcu-
lation of koff see Note 4). In some cases, however, a complexity may
arise from the analysis of the dependence of kobs, which can deviate
from linearity and can be described by a hyperbolic equation,
suggesting the presence of an additional step limiting the bimolec-
ular

reaction
at

(as exempliﬁed in Fig. 5b).
In the case of an IDP binding-induced folding reaction that
follows a folding after binding mechanism, the limiting step may be

concentrations. This type of deviation from linearity suggests the presence of additional step(s) limiting the

ascribed to the folding reaction of the IDP, and kobs dependence on
the concentration of B can be described by the following equation:
kobs ¼ kon∙kf∙B

½  þ kf þ koff
where kf is the folding rate constant of the IDP. Comprehensive
detailed analysis and discussion of this complex scenario can be
found in [7] (see Note 5).

Notes
1. Formation of air bubbles in the observation cell represents the
principal cause of artifacts in T-jump experiments, conse-
quently making impossible acquisition of data. Degassing the
solution used in the experiment is a highly recommended step
in order to reduce cavitation events. In case the user is unable
to properly degas solutions, experience suggests that degassing
the sample directly in the syringe may be sufﬁcient to reduce
the formation of bubbles. This procedure can be readily
achieved by manually closing the hole at the top and very
carefully pulling the plunger at the same time. Our warning
to the user is to pay extreme attention while performing this
manual procedure, to avoid the sample to come out from the
syringe.
2. The choice of ﬁlters in ﬂuorescence experiments is critical to
select the desired wavelength that has to be followed during the
reaction. A valuable strategy that can be carried out for a wise
ﬁlter selection is to perform measurements with a spectroﬂuo-
rometer of the tryptophan ﬂuorescence in absence and pres-
ence of the ligand. The analysis of the spectra obtained will
suggest to the user the wavelength that can be excluded in
order to obtain a kinetic trace with a good signal-to-noise
ratio. In the case of PXD-NTAIL study presented in this chapter,
we followed intrinsic tryptophan ﬂuorescence change of PXD
upon binding with NTAIL and a 320 nm cut-off ﬁlter was used
to exclude wavelengths below 320 nm. However, in some
cases, experiments with unmodiﬁed ligands do not return any
ﬂuorescence change upon binding, demanding the design of
ﬂuorescently labeled variants of the protein. For example, the
addition of a dansyl-chloride at the N- or C-terminal of the
protein is a widely used strategy, since this molecule quenches
tryptophan ﬂuorescence and emits a ﬂuorescent signal in the
visible spectrum (>400 nm). In this case, by using a band pass
ﬁlter the user will be able to follow the quenching of the
tryptophan signal provided by the dansyl-chloride, or the

659

ﬂuorescence emission of dansyl-chloride with a 435 or 475 nm
cut-off ﬁlters.
3. Low voltage discharges correspond to low temperature jumps,
leading to a poor signal-to-noise ratio, while a too high voltage
may give high margin of error in the calculation of the size of
the jump and increases the probability of formation of air
bubbles in the optical cell.
4. Microscopic dissociation rate constant koff can be, in theory,
extrapolated as the y-axis intercept value of kobs dependence, at
0 ligand concentration. However indirect measurements of koff
often result in high experimental error, so that a different
approach is required to improve the quality of this kinetic
parameter. A typical methodology to calculate dissociation
rate constants is kinetic displacement experiment, in which a
preincubated protein complex is challenged with an excess of a
competing reactant. This strategy, which demands the complex
and the competitor to be separated in a pre-equilibrium condi-
tion, cannot be carried out with a temperature-jump apparatus,
but requires a rapid mixing technique, such as stopped-ﬂow.
5. Understanding the order of events is crucial for the characteri-
zation of IDPs binding induced folding reactions. A typical
kinetic test to distinguish between induced ﬁt and conforma-
tional selection mechanisms consist in performing binding
experiments in pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions in respect of the
two different ligands. Details about this experimental strategy
can be found in [12].

Determining Binding Kinetics of Intrinsically Disordered
Proteins by NMR Spectroscopy

Abstract
The unique structural ﬂexibility of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is central to their diverse
functions in cellular processes. Protein–protein interactions involving IDPs are frequently transient and
dynamic in nature. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an especially powerful tool for
characterizing the structural propensities, dynamics, and interactions of IDPs. Here we describe applica-
tions of the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion experiment in combination with
NMR titrations to characterize the kinetics and mechanisms of interactions between intrinsically disordered
proteins and their targets. We illustrate the method with reference to interactions between the activation
domain of the human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-1) basic leucine zipper protein (HBZ) and its
cellular binding partner, the KIX domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP.

Introduction
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful
technique for dissecting protein molecular dynamics over a wide
range of timescales at atomic resolution, allowing both global and
local analysis of molecular interactions. NMR is uniquely suited for
the characterization of the conformational ensembles and dynamics
of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), providing novel insights
into their structural propensities and the kinetics and mechanisms
of their interactions with binding partners. IDPs play a central
functional role in the cell, participating in numerous protein–pro-
tein interaction networks that control a diverse array of cellular
signaling and regulatory pathways [1]. The functional versatility
of IDPs arises from their conformational ﬂexibility not only in their
free forms but also during interactions with their cellular targets,
the timescale of which commonly falls into the microsecond-
millisecond range [2, 3]. Our understanding of protein dynamics

in the interactions of IDPs has beneﬁted greatly from a variety of
NMR experiments, including relaxation-compensated R2 relaxa-
tion dispersion [4], rotating-frame relaxation (R1ρ) [5], and satu-
ration
transfer
experiments
[6,
7].
These
experiments
are
particularly informative in revealing sparsely populated excited
states that are invisible to conventional detection methods [8]. In
particular, the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) R2 relaxation
dispersion experiment enables quantiﬁcation of exchange processes
that occur on a microsecond-millisecond timescale, providing novel
information on the structure of weakly populated “excited” states
[9], protein folding/unfolding events [10, 11], the mechanisms of
enzyme catalysis [12, 13], and the kinetics and mechanisms of
protein–protein interactions [3, 14].
R2
relaxation
dispersion
experiments
provide
important
insights into the kinetics and mechanism by which an IDP binds
to its target. At any given IDP:target stoichiometry, analysis of the
dispersion proﬁles yields the populations of the different states
involved in the interaction, the exchange rate (kex), and the chemi-
cal shift differences (Δω) between states. By performing relaxation
dispersion experiments in the settings of a titration, a detailed
description of the binding process can be obtained. The kinetics
and mechanism of interaction can be derived by ﬁtting a series of
relaxation dispersion experiments collected at different protein:
ligand ratios to various binding models. In this chapter, we will
focus on the experimental implementation of backbone
15N
CPMG relaxation dispersion titration experiments and describe
our approach to ﬁtting CPMG titration data using the software
package GLOVE [15]. To illustrate this approach, we describe how
CPMG data are used to analyze the interactions between the KIX
domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP and the intrinsically
disordered activation domain of the viral transcription factor HBZ
(Human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-1) basic leucine zip-
per protein) to determine binding kinetics and mechanism with
residue-speciﬁc information.
1.1
Theoretical
Descriptions
of Chemical Exchange
The dynamic process of chemical exchange exposes a nucleus to
different chemical environments, resulting in distinct resonance
frequencies for the different states involved in the exchange pro-
cess. Consider the simplest model of chemical exchange, two-state
exchange:
A ⇄
kBA
kAB B
ð1Þ
where kAB and kBA are the forward and reverse rates of reaction
between states A and B. The overall exchange rate between A
and B, kex, is denoted kex ¼ kAB + kBA. The chemical shift difference
between states is denoted Δω ¼ j ωA  ωBj. The populations of
664
Ke Yang et al.

states A and B in the system, pA and pB, can be calculated using
pA ¼
kBA
kABþkBA and pB ¼
kAB
kABþkBA.
The timescale of exchange in NMR spectroscopy is usually
deﬁned by comparing the exchange rate kex and the chemical shift
difference Δω between states. Exchange processes on different
timescales have different effects on the lineshape of peaks in the
NMR spectrum. In the fast exchange regime, where kex  |Δω|, the
NMR resonance of a two-state exchanging system appears at an
intermediate chemical shift that is weighted by the population of
states A and B. When kex  |Δω| the exchange falls into the slow
regime, where NMR resonances of both states A and B are directly
observable at their distinct chemical shifts and the peak intensity of
A and B reﬂects their populations, pA and pB, assuming that the
relaxation rates in both states are the same (R0
2A ¼ R0
2B). In the
intermediate exchange regime, where kex  |Δω|, the NMR reso-
nances are broadened due to an increase in the transverse relaxation
rate caused by exchange. The effect of exchange on the appearance
of the NMR spectrum depends on the exchange kinetics, as illu-
strated in standard textbooks and many reviews [16].
1.2
Relaxation-
Compensated CPMG
Dispersion Experi-
ments for Studying
Chemical Exchange
As mentioned above, exchange at a rate comparable to the chemical
shift differences between states causes line broadening in NMR
spectra. When the exchange involves interconversion between a
major and a minor populated state, exchange broadening and low
population often make the minor state invisible to conventional
NMR methods. The relaxation-compensated CPMG experiment
developed by Loria et al. [4] allows measurements of exchange rates
between 200 to 2000 s1, a frequency range where many protein
conformational ﬂuctuations and ligand binding processes occur.
The CPMG experiment utilizes a series of spin-echo pulses
(τCP  π  τCP, where τCP is a delay before and after the π pulse)
to refocus magnetization. In the presence of exchange, the magne-
tization cannot be fully refocused, leading to broadening of the
NMR signal, as illustrated elsewhere [16]. The effective transverse
relaxation rate Reff
2 can be experimentally determined by comparing
peak intensities of spectra collected with CPMG pulse train, I(τCP),
and a reference spectrum where τCP is set to zero, I0:

where TCPMG is the length of the CPMG pulse train.
The effective line-broadening can be quantiﬁed as a function of
the pulsing frequency of the refocusing pulses. Modulation of the
refocusing pulsing frequencies in a CPMG pulse train allows decon-
volution of the observed Reff

and relaxation due to chemical or conformational exchange, Rex

It is thus possible to obtain information on binding kinetics
from the ﬁts using this modiﬁed Carver and Richards equation. As
can be seen from the equation, for a system where [P]0 and [L]0 are
given, the on-rate kon and the concentration of free protein [P] are
in one term [P]kon. It is possible, however, to deconvolute [P] and
kon by performing a CPMG titration experiment with varying [P]0.
More complicated interaction mechanisms involving three-
state binding models have been discussed in detail in the literature
[3, 14, 15, 19] (see Note 1 for ways to construct user-deﬁned
binding models in the software package GLOVE).

time or increase signal to noise.

Methods
When using relaxation dispersion to determine the kinetics of
binding of an IDP (ligand) to a target protein, it is preferable to
isotope label the IDP to avoid potential complications in data
analysis (see Note 3). Assignments of the IDP (ligand) resonances
are required for data interpretation. Backbone amide assignments
are typically made using standard triple resonance experiments with
15N, 13C-labeled protein.
3.1
Sample
Preparation
Lyophilized proteins are resuspended in NMR buffer, buffer-
exchanged, and concentrated to prepare protein stocks. To ensure
that NMR samples for data acquisition at two ﬁelds are identical, it
is advisable to prepare 1 mL of NMR sample and split it into two
500 μL samples for simultaneous data acquisition on the two
spectrometers (see Note 4).
At least four samples with different protein:ligand concentra-
tion ratios are required for the analysis of binding kinetics using
relaxation dispersion experiments. To ensure that the ligand con-
centration remains constant and only the protein concentration
varies, samples of the beginning point and the end point of the
titration, i.e., the lowest and highest concentration ratios, are
668

prepared. After the acquisition of CPMG dispersion data, the sam-
ples are mixed in different ratios to make intermediate points of the
titration. The pH value of each sample should be checked to ensure
a constant pH across all samples. To obtain the representative
dispersion proﬁles shown in the ﬁgures, samples were prepared
with KIX:15N HBZ (protein:ligand) concentration ratios of
0.010:1, 0.015:1, 0.020:1, and 0.025:1.
3.2
Identiﬁcation
of the Appropriate
Stoichiometric Range
for the CPMG Titration
Experiment
The general idea is to identify a range of protein:ligand concentra-
tion ratios where high-quality dispersion data can be obtained. For
instance, severe line broadening in spectra could indicate exchange
on the microsecond to millisecond timescale but might impair data
quality due to low peak intensity. It is possible to simulate the
correlation between R2
eff and the concentration ratio of protein
and ligand with reasonable estimates of the on- and off-rates, kon
and koff, and the dissociation constant of the protein-ligand inter-
action, KD [23, 24]. For a system for which prior knowledge of
binding kinetics and dynamics is lacking, it is advisable to perform
test experiments that include HSQC titrations on the protein-
ligand interaction of interest, as well as CPMG experiments on
the protein in both the free and the fully bound states. The analysis
of the lineshape and peak intensity in the HSQC titration and the
CPMG dispersion proﬁles at different protein-ligand ratios should
provide a useful guide in the experimental design and optimization
of the concentration ratios at which CPMG titrations data are
collected. It is desirable, however, to start the titration from an
experimental condition where there is no dispersion in the free
ligand to avoid complication in data analysis. When there is disper-
sion in the free ligand, even if one observes increased dispersion in
the bound state that is dependent on the protein:ligand concentra-
tion ratio, data analysis may be complicated. The dispersion data, in
this case, reﬂect a complex multi-state process: the intrinsic
exchange process in the ligand of interest plus another process
with different kinetics from the exchange caused by protein inter-
actions. Deconvolution of this multi-state process is very compli-
cated. One cannot simply subtract the dispersion proﬁle of the free
ligand because the binding event may alter the intrinsic exchange
process in the target ligand. Here, we discuss three possible scenar-
ios and corresponding experimental strategies (assuming that the
IDP (ligand) is the labeled species here; see Notes 3 and 5):
3.2.1
The HSQC
Spectrum of the IDP Is
Well-Resolved in Both
the Free and Bound Form
No dispersion is observed for the free IDP (ligand), but visible
dispersion is observed when it is fully bound to the target protein.
This indicates that motions in the free IDP are likely too fast to be
detected by CPMG, while the bound IDP shows exchange in the
μs–ms timescale, suggesting that the interaction might have both
relatively slow on- and off-rates. In this case, consider performing a
titration at concentration ratios around the stoichiometry of the
Binding Kinetics of IDPs
669

fully bound complex [3, 14] (e.g., for a 1:1 protein:ligand complex
where the IDP ligand is the labeled species, collect CPMG titration
data at [protein]:[ligand] ¼ 0.90:1, 0.95:1, 1.00:1, 1.05:1, etc.).
3.2.2
The HSQC
Spectrum of the IDP Is
Well-Resolved in Both
the Free and Bound Form
No dispersion is observed for the free IDP nor when it is fully
bound, indicating that the interaction might have a very fast on-rate
and slow off-rate. Sub-stoichiometric protein concentrations can be
considered in this case [24]. A full HSQC titration can be per-
formed and peak intensities extracted from the HSQC experiments
to identify protein:ligand ratios where an increased R2
eff is
observed.
3.2.3
The HSQC
Spectrum of the IDP Is
Well-Resolved in the Free
Form, but Severe
Line-Broadening Is
Observed
in the Bound Form
In this case, CPMG titrations at very low, sub-stoichiometric pro-
tein concentrations are recommended (e.g. [protein]:[ligand] ¼
0.05:1, 0.10:1, 0.15:1, etc.) (see Note 6).

3.4.1
Initial Data
Processing
The goal of initial data processing is to convert the pseudo 3D
CPMG experiment to a set of 2D spectra from which the peak
intensities can be determined. Depending on the acquisition mode
of the experiment, it might be necessary to split the pseudo 3D data
ﬁle into multiple 2D data ﬁles. In our experiments, each 2D plane is
processed using the NMRPipe [21] software. It is advisable to go
through every 2D spectrum at this stage to ensure that the spectra
are well-phased (see Note 7), that the positions of peaks do no shift
between spectra, and that the spectra are free of artifacts that might
interfere with the determination of peak intensity.
3.4.2
Extract Peak
Intensities Using pkﬁt or
fudaFIT
pkﬁt [15] and FuDA [25] are programs that integrate peak inten-
sities from 2D spectra. pkﬁt is included in the GLOVE software
package, and FuDA can be downloaded from the website of the
Hansen lab (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/hansen-lab/fuda/).
pkﬁt collects peak intensity based on peak position speciﬁed in
the peak list ﬁle. An input ﬁle for pkﬁt contains the strength of
magnetic ﬁeld in MHz at which the experiments are acquired, box
size (1  1, 3  3 or 5  5 grid points centered on the peak top),
the name of a peak list ﬁle, position tolerance in Hz in two dimen-
sions (typically 12 Hz), and TCPMG (s) and 1/τCP (s1) for each 2D
plane in nmrView format. An output ﬁle of pkﬁt contains magnetic
ﬁeld strength, peak position, and peak intensity information, which
can be subsequently reformatted by the program chop in GLOVE to

generate an intensity ﬁle for the program cpmg2glove. In GLOVE,
it is more convenient to run a shell script named pkﬁti to sequen-
tially run pkﬁt and chop with the command below:
pkfiti –i input_filename –o output_filename -v
Alternatively, the program FuDA can be used to determine peak
intensities from the 2D planes. FuDA ﬁts peaks in a spectrum to pure
Gaussian or Lorentzian lineshapes (or a mixture of the two) and
extracts peak intensities from the ﬁtted peaks. Additional informa-
tion and documentation on the usage of FuDA can be found on the
Hansen lab website (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/hansen-lab/fuda/).
3.4.3
Convert Peak
Intensity to Reff
2 Using
cpmg2glove
cpmg2glove converts peak intensity information from the intensity
ﬁles generated by pkﬁt or FuDA to Reff
2
that can be used by
GLOVE to calculate exchange parameters. A binding model and
parameters of global ﬁtting need to be declared in the input ﬁle for
cpmg2glove, which will be discussed in further detail in the sections
to follow. The output ﬁle from cpmg2glove is named glove.in by
default, containing the Reff
2
values for each 1/τCP (s1) used by
GLOVE for ﬁtting of CPMG data as well as the ﬁtting model,
ﬁtting method, error estimation methods, data plotting instruc-
tions, and global parameters that can be personalized by the user by
modifying the glove.in ﬁle.
3.4.4
Fitting of Titration
Points at Each
Concentration Ratio
After initial processing and generating intensity ﬁles from each
CPMG experiment in the titration series, we recommend ﬁtting
each titration point to a basic two-state Carver and Richards equa-
tion (model named RICHARDS in GLOVE) to examine the
exchange proﬁles of the labeled ligand and identify clusters of
exchanging residues that share similar exchange behavior. In this
step, we perform individual ﬁts where a separate set of exchange
parameters (kex, pB, and Δω) are calculated for each residue that
undergoes exchange.
An example of input ﬁle for cpmg2glove using model
RICHARDS for individual ﬁtting of each residue is given below:
temp1="301"
model="RICHARDS"
global=
cpmg2glove -t $model $global \
-ise ./Int_field_1 $temp1 0 [percentile error] \
-ise ./Int_field_2 $temp1 0 [percentile error] \
where the ﬂag –ise represents temperature (K, value denoted in
temp1), spin (0 for 15N), and percentile error (%, can vary based on
the ﬁeld strength and sensitivity of the spectrometer) set by the user
672
Ke Yang et al.

(see Note 8). Int_ﬁeld_1 and Int_ﬁeld_2 are intensity ﬁles from the
same sample collected at two spectrometer frequencies.
Fitting methods in GLOVE include GRID (grid search of
global parameters in the parameter space that yields the best ﬁt
for both the global and local parameters), RANDOM (randomly
choose initial values from parameter space for minimization),
MCMIN (Monte Carlo-minimization using the current best ﬁt as
initial values), ONE (separated, alternative single-point minimiza-
tion of local and global parameters from the lower limit of the range
of parameters), and ONEEX (simultaneous single-point minimiza-
tion of both local and global parameters from the initial values of
parameters) that can be executed in any order and combination.
For the purpose of this step, we ﬁnd that a combination of RAN-
DOM (50 iterations) + 3  MCMIN (50 iterations each, with scale
of 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 sequentially) typically yields good ﬁts
within minutes (see Notes 9 and 10). In addition to user-speciﬁed
ﬁtting methods, GLOVE applies an initial ﬁtting method (named
INIT) that utilizes the user-deﬁned parameter values or the lower
limit of parameter ranges to calculate a global minimum. After
specifying ﬁtting methods in the glove.in ﬁle, GLOVE is executed
by command:
glove –vv –i glove.in –o glove.out -xmgr
that calculates the ﬁts with the option of reporting the reduced
χ2 values in real time during the ﬁtting process, storing the results
after each round of calculation (-vv, an extended verbose mode),
and writing out Grace ﬁles for plotting data (-xmgr). After success-
fully running an individual ﬁt, dispersion proﬁles can be plotted for
each residue using the software mplot as shown in Fig. 2. Detailed
inspection of the individually ﬁtted parameters (kex, pB, and Δω)
helps identify residues that can be clustered for global ﬁtting of
data. In this example, we chose residues 21, 23, 25, and 31 as a
cluster for global ﬁtting (see Note 11).
3.4.5
Fitting of a Titration
Series to the Binding Model
of Choice
Binding models incorporated in GLOVE include a two-state bind-
ing model and two distinct three-state binding models (see Notes 1
and 12). Here we focus on the use of the two-state binding model,
named CPMG_BIND2C or BIND2C, depending on the version of
GLOVE. CPMG_BIND2C uses the aforementioned modiﬁed

error (%). The ﬂag –ﬁlt ﬁlters out residues except for the ones
speciﬁed after it; in this case only residues X1, X2, X3, and X4 are
included in the cluster. Here kon, koff, and pB are set as global
parameters that are applied to all residues in the cluster. Initial
values, ranges of global parameters, and grid sizes for parameter
search can be deﬁned in the glove.in ﬁle, as well as whether each
parameter is set as ﬁxed or variable. Fits using model BIND2C were
initially carried out on each residue to ﬁnd a reasonable initial value
for the global parameters. Global ﬁts of all residues in the cluster are
carried out multiple times using different initial parameter values
and ﬁtting strategies to obtain the best ﬁt (with the smallest
reduced χ2). Fitting errors of global ﬁts are estimated by Monte
Carlo methods (see Note 13). Fitted curves are plotted using
mplot. Representative dispersion curves for the KIX:HBZ interac-
tion are shown in Fig. 4.
For quality control, ﬁtted results are compared to experimental
data derived from other biophysical methods. For example, the
calculated KD of the KIX:HBZ interaction is close to the KD
measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and the calcu-
lated chemical shift difference |Δῶ| (in ppm) values correlate with
the equilibrium chemical shift differences |Δδ| between the free and
the bound form of HBZ, indicating that the minor-populated state

detected in the CPMG experiment represents the bound form of
HBZ (see Note 14). Fits of the dispersion data to several binding
models should be tested. In the example of Fig. 4, only BIND2C
gave reasonable ﬁts, indicating that the interaction between KIX
and HBZ possibly follows a two-state mechanism or a mechanism
where there is conformational selection with fast pre-equilibrium
conformational exchange [14].

To construct customized three-state binding models where

parameters
in
these
pathways
to
0.
For
instance,
in
BIND3C_2F1B (Fig. 5a), when kon1 and koff1 are set to zero,
the model becomes a conformational selection model, where P
interacts with a weakly populated, “excited” state conforma-
tion L∗[14]. Similarly, in BIND3C_1F2B, when kon1 and koff1
(or kon2 and koff2) are set to zero, the model becomes an
induced-ﬁt model, where conformational change occurs after
binding.
When the three-state models are used, it is usually not easy
to obtain good ﬁts, especially when only a small data set is used
[26]. A global ﬁt of dispersion curves derived from many peaks
may improve the accuracy of ﬁtting. The following stepwise
ﬁtting procedure may also solve the problem [14]. First, local
ﬁts for each residue are performed to search for the best ﬁt by a
GRID search. Then, the median of the rate constants obtained
for all residues is calculated and is used as an initial value for the
Fig. 5 Schematic representation of three-state binding models. (a) Three-state binding model where there are
two free forms and one bound state. L and L∗(colored in blue) represent two exchanging forms of the free
ligand. The protein-ligand complex is shown as [P:L] (colored in pink). k12 and k21 are rate constants of the
forward and reverse reaction between the two free forms of ligand. ΔωF1F2 represents the chemical shift
difference between the two free forms. ΔωF1B is the chemical shift difference between the bound and the
most highly populated form of the free ligand (L). (b) Three-state binding model where there is one free form
(L, blue) and two bound forms (P:L∗and P:L, pink). k12 and k21 are rate constants for the exchange between
the two bound forms. ΔωFB1 and ΔωFB2 are the chemical shift differences between the free form and the two
bound forms

subsequent global ﬁt. In the global ﬁt, a GRID search around
the medians of local ﬁts is performed. If the full global ﬁt gives a
reasonable ﬁt, a subglobal ﬁt, in which some residues are clus-
tered, is performed using the results of the full global ﬁt as
initial parameter values. For quality control, the following
conditions should also be checked: the population of the
major form at equilibrium (usually the bound form or free
form) is larger than that of other forms, and the bound form
is more structured than other forms.
2. The use of a cryo-probe is recommended, especially when
severe line-broadening is observed.
3. Isotopic labeling of the IDP (ligand) is recommended for 1)
better data quality, 2) potentially less complication caused by
inter-domain motions in bigger proteins, and 3) easier data
processing and interpretation. If the primary purpose of the
experiment is to obtain binding kinetics, labeling either the
target protein or ligand should in principle yield comparable
results. However, the presence of μs-ms time scale exchange
processes that cause relaxation dispersion of target protein
resonances in the free state will greatly complicate data analysis.
In such cases, the dispersion proﬁles of the complex may reﬂect
intrinsic target protein exchange kinetics plus kinetics of the
binding event, which will be difﬁcult to deconvolute. In con-
trast, it is unlikely that a highly ﬂexible IDP will exhibit relaxa-
tion dispersion in the free state, thus simplifying the analysis of
the dispersion proﬁles.
4. Accurate measurement of protein and ligand concentrations is
important for obtaining accurate binding parameters. How-
ever, if protein or ligand concentration is not accurately
measured (e.g., when dithiothreitol is present in UV absorp-
tion measurement), correction for protein or ligand concentra-
tion is possible during GLOVE ﬁtting. In model BIND2C,
BIND3C_1F2B and BIND3C_2F1B, parameters A0 and B0
represent the total concentrations of protein and ligand,
respectively. Setting one of them as a variable enables correc-
tion for the concentration. If a corrected concentration
obtained by a ﬁt deviates more than two-fold from the original
value, the ﬁtting model may not be appropriate. Note that
ﬁtting may be unstable, if both A0 and B0 are set as
variables [14].
5. R2 relaxation dispersion is not observed when chemical
exchange does not occur on a microsecond-millisecond time-
scale. However, changing experimental conditions, such as pH,
temperature, and salt concentration of the sample solution,
may affect binding/dissociation kinetics, leading to observa-
tion of R2 relaxation dispersion. Chemical exchange on a faster
678
Ke Yang et al.

microsecond timescale may be measured by R1ρ relaxation
dispersion experiments [27, 28].
6. The presence of an excess of the IDP ligand relative to the
protein target might result in multiple ligand molecules bind-
ing to a single target molecule. HSQC titrations can resolve
this possibility.
7. Proper phasing of the 2D planes is crucial for obtaining accu-
rate peak intensities. It is tempting to use the same phasing
parameters for all CPMG experiments collected on the same
instrument; however, it is advisable to phase the HSQC spectra
at each titration point independently to make sure the peak
intensity is not biased due to the spectra being out of phase.
8. Precise estimation of experimental errors is necessary for
obtaining reasonable reduced χ2 values. If experimental errors
are not manually given, cpmg2glove automatically estimates
experimental errors, when multiple measurements are per-
formed with the same 1/τCP value (e.g., the vdlist of 3.3
shows that duplicate measurements are performed with a
1/τCP of 0, 100, 200 and 2000). Data points with a low
signal-to-noise ratio (a default cut-off value is 2.5) and with
negative intensity are removed when glove.in is created.
9. Model ONEEX is time-consuming and therefore not recom-
mended at early stages of parameter search and optimization.
10. Non-linear least-squares ﬁtting requires good estimates of ini-
tial values. If the ﬁtting using RANDOM and MCMIN does
not give a good ﬁt, we recommend using GRID to perform
many ﬁtting runs from various initial parameter values.
11. Empirical criteria for identifying residues that share collective
behavior, i.e., have the same kex and pB, have been discussed
[3, 12, 29]. Generally, the criterion used to determine whether
a given residue belongs within a cluster is that χ2
cluster/χ2
individ-
ual 	 2, where χ2
individual is the χ2 value for an independent ﬁt of
the dispersion proﬁle for that residue and χ2
cluster is the χ2 value
when ﬁtted to a common value of kex and pB applied to all
residues in the cluster.
12. Choice of binding model: We recommend starting with the
simplest binding model unless there is strong evidence suggest-
ing that a more complex model is appropriate.
13. In GLOVE, standard deviations of ﬁtting parameters are calcu-
lated using the covariance matrix method by default. The
Monte Carlo method gives more reliable error estimates, but
it requires a number of (e.g., 100 times more) calculations.
14. When there is more than one state from which the equilibrium
chemical shift differences can be calculated, the state that gives
the best correlation between |Δω| and |Δδ| is most likely the
minor populated state.

Determination of Protein Phase Diagrams by Centrifugation
Nicole M. Milkovic and Tanja Mittag
Abstract
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) underlies the formation of biomolecular condensates, i.e.,
membrane-less compartments in cells that carry out functions related to RNA metabolism, stress adapta-
tion, transport, or signaling. Examples of such biomolecular condensates are the nucleolus, nuclear
speckles, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) bodies and paraspeckles in the nucleus, and stress granules
and P bodies in the cytoplasm. Other structures in cells that are not typically viewed as bona ﬁde compart-
ments also seem to be formed via LLPS as recently elucidated, including heterochromatin, super-enhancers,
and membrane receptor clusters. Key protein and/or RNA components of these biomolecular condensates
form a scaffold via LLPS. Other constituents incorporate into this scaffold as clients. To understand the
sequence features and interactions that mediate biomolecular condensate formation in cells, it is useful to
quantify phase separation of pure components in vitro. Microscopy and turbidity measurements can be used
to determine the concentration of a protein above which it phase separates, the so-called saturation
concentration. Here, we describe experiments for the determination of full coexistence lines of phase-
separating proteins by centrifugation. Coexistence lines are reconstructed from coexisting light and dense
phase concentrations of the protein, and we present them as so-called phase diagrams. Phase diagrams allow
the quantitative comparison of phase separation for proteins and their mutants under different conditions.
They are thus important for our nuanced understanding of the driving forces underlying liquid-liquid phase
separation in vitro. Such results have direct applicability for understanding phase separation-driven com-
partmentalization of cells.

Introduction
Cells use extensive compartmentalization to segregate competing
reactions into different compartments. In addition to typical
membrane-encapsulated (often also called membrane-bound)
organelles, cells contain membrane-less organelles. A decade ago,
groundbreaking work by Brangwynne et al. showed that P granules
[1] and nucleoli [2], two examples of membrane-less organelles,
behaved like liquid droplets coexisting with the cytoplasm or nucle-
oplasm in live cells. They proposed that the coexisting phases must

be formed by LLPS and suggested the process as a general mecha-
nism for the formation of membrane-less organelles, igniting a new
ﬁeld of study that has enabled insight into the biophysical driving
forces of cellular compartmentalization. Multiple lines of evidence
now support the model that LLPS plays a critical role in the
formation of membrane-less organelles, e.g., the ability of key
constituents to undergo LLPS at close to physiological conditions
in vitro [3–8], the fact that biomolecular condensates in cells grow
like dense phases over time [3, 9] and that phase diagrams can be
mapped in cells [10]. LLPS is a process in which macromolecules
spontaneously condense into a dense liquid phase, often observed
as liquid droplets [11, 12]. Membrane-less organelles are also called
biomolecular condensates because they form via condensation of
proteins and/or nucleic acids into dense liquid droplets [13]. In
vitro, the dense phase and the leftover dilute phase are coexisting,
immiscible phases. They are characterized by relative depletion of
macromolecules in the dilute phase and high concentration and
viscosity in the dense phase, respectively.
LLPS of proteins is mediated via multivalent interactions,
which can occur between two different protein species or between
multiple copies of a single protein species [14, 15]. Polar intrinsi-
cally disordered regions (IDRs) with low sequence complexity are
typical constituents of biomolecular condensates and can undergo
LLPS via homotypic interactions at physiological conditions and
concentrations. For example, the IDRs of stress granule proteins
FUS [16, 17], hnRNPA1 [4, 8], and TDP-43 [18] are sufﬁcient for
mediating phase separation in vitro. This also holds true for IDRs of
germ granule protein DDX4 [3] and P granule protein LAF-1
[6]. While the methods we describe here are of general validity,
they have mostly been used to characterize phase separation of
single protein species that undergo LLPS via homotypic interac-
tions, e.g., IDRs [3, 6, 19].
Various methods have been developed for characterizing the
driving force of proteins to undergo phase separation, e.g., micros-
copy or light scattering approaches for determining the saturation
concentration, csat, of proteins, i.e., the concentration above which
they ﬁrst form a dense phase [20]. Additional reviews are available
that detail puriﬁcation protocols for disordered proteins and how to
biophysically characterize structural features and material proper-
ties of condensed states [20–23]. Here, we describe a method for
the quantitative characterization of protein phase diagrams by cen-
trifugation. The goal is to enable the quantitative determination of
the light and dense phase concentrations for a phase-separating
protein in equilibrium; these concentrations can be plotted as
pairs of concentrations against temperature or another variable,
e.g., salt concentration, pH, the concentration of a second protein,
or another binding partner. With these data, the left and right arms
of a phase diagram can be reconstructed (Fig. 1). Before starting to
686
Nicole M. Milkovic and Tanja Mittag

map the phase diagram for the protein of interest, it should be
established that the protein undergoes LLPS, which is typically a
reversible process (Fig. 2), as opposed to irreversible aggregation.

Materials
Prepare all solutions with ultrapure deionized water that has a
resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 C and sterilize by ﬁltration with
0.22 μm pore-size ﬁlters. Prepare and store all solutions at room
temperature. All reducing agents are added freshly to working stock
solutions to assure correct concentrations and optimal stability of
the reductant in question (see Note 1). The following outlined
protocol is for the RNA-binding protein hnRNPA1, whose phase
separation is driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions
[4], though notes have been included to aid in generalizing this
method to other systems. The protein is in the one-phase regime in
a high salt storage buffer, and lowering the salt concentration by
dilution with a salt-free buffer is used to induce phase separation.

Fig. 1 Schematic of a phase diagram with an upper critical solution temperature
(UCST). The coexistence line separates the 1- and 2-phase regimes in a phase
diagram. At any given condition in the 2-phase regime, two coexisting and
immiscible phases are present, i.e., dense protein droplets (of concentration
cdense) surrounded by a light, protein-poor phase (of concentration clight). At
higher total protein concentration, light phase droplets are surrounded by dense
phase. Beyond the critical point, the protein forms a single phase and cannot
undergo LLPS. If LLPS can occur at temperatures below the critical point, the
phase transition has a UCST, as shown here. If phase separation occurs at
temperatures above the critical point, the protein has a lower critical solution
temperature (LCST)

2. ADDITIVE: Concentrated stocks of salt, crowding agent,
buffer to change pH, concentrated secondary protein stock,
etc., depending on the investigation. To determine the phase
diagram of hnRNPA1 as a function of NaCl concentration, we
use a 5 M sodium chloride (NaCl) stock solution (50 mL), and
this will be carried forward in the method (see Note 5).
3. 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (molecular weight 154.24 g/mol.

a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Add 9.5 mL water, for a total volume
of 10 mL ﬁnal buffer (see Table 1 for buffer preparation).
2. Storage Buffer: This is the buffer your protein is stored in. For
example, hnRNPA1 is stored in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5,
300 mM NaCl, with reductant. Add 500 μL of the 1 M
BUFFER stock solution to a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Add

the table below as an example. Please note that the salt/addi-
tive concentrations will vary for each protein, and additional
buffers should be made for those systems.
4. Concentrated protein of interest in storage buffer (see Notes 4

Methods
This protocol assumes that you know the conditions under which
the protein of interest undergoes LLPS; i.e., you know whether
your protein requires certain concentrations of salts, a binding
partner, nucleic acids, and/or macromolecular crowding to stimu-
late phase separation, and at which conditions it is in the one-phase
regime. We recommend that you verify the appearance of droplets
via microscopy.
This protocol is based on previously published reports from the
Brangwynne [6], Mittag [4, 24], and Forman-Kay [19] labora-
tories, and the approach is illustrated in Fig. 3. The protocol we
describe here uses temperature- and additive-dependent phase sep-
aration, sedimentation of the dense phase, and measurement of the
co-existing light and dense phase concentrations via UV-light
absorption. The results are used to construct a phase diagram.
The examples we illustrate will be for mapping a phase diagram
for one salt concentration at six different temperatures.
3.1
Equipment Setup
1. Label all 0.5 mL clear PCR tubes. It is useful to color-code the
tubes with cryo dot labels based on salt concentration or tem-
perature. For one salt concentration at six temperatures and
three replicates per condition, you will need 36 tubes. This is
for three replicates/tubes per condition, and another three
tubes to collect supernatants for subsequent light phase con-
centration measurements (i.e., a minimum of 6 tubes per sam-
ple condition). Additional tubes will be necessary if measuring
dense phase concentrations.
2. Turn on the heating block(s) equipped with a 24  0.5 mL
accessory block. Fill the tube chambers with water (see Note 7).
Set temperature(s) and let block equilibrate. The digital read-
out display will read “OK” when the temperature is stable.
Set the desired temperature on the centrifuge. (Note: this
temperature should be identical to the temperature the heating
block has been set to.) Make sure there is nothing in your
centrifuge rotor, close any rotor lids, shut the main door, and
let the temperature equilibrate while the centrifuge spins
empty.

3.2
Sample
Preparation
For a schematic illustrating the sample preparation, please see
Fig. 3.
1. Calculate how much protein will be needed for measurements
at all temperatures and salt concentrations. Each sample has a
total volume of 12 μL. To generate a phase diagram for 1 salt
concentration and 6 temperatures, i.e., 3 replicates per condi-
tion, 6 conditions total, and 30 μL excess that can be lost due
to ﬁltering, you will need (12 μL  3 replicates  6 condi-
tions) + 30 μL excess ¼ 236 μL total protein volume. The
starting concentration of your protein stock does not matter,
per se, because a typical property of LLPS is that the light phase
concentration is constant, even at increasing total protein con-
centrations; only the relative volume fractions of light and
dense phases change. To be able to induce and quantify phase
separation, you need a protein concentration above csat.
Whether you are close or far away from the coexistence line,
all of your data will converge on the coexistence line (Fig. 4, see
Note 8).
2. Mix the protein with the storage buffer ﬁrst to adjust the
protein concentration if desired. Then dilute with the salt-free
buffer to induce phase separation (see Note 9, Fig. 3a).
3. Filter the phase-separated protein using a 1 mL syringe
equipped with a 0.22 μm ﬁlter (4 mm diameter) into a clean
0.5 mL PCR tube (see Note 10).
4. Aliquot 12 μL each of the ﬁltered protein solution into clean,
labeled 0.5 mL PCR tubes. Repeat until all tubes are ﬁlled for
that condition (Fig. 3b).
5. Once samples are aliquoted into the labeled tubes, place tubes
into the equilibrated heat blocks set to appropriate tempera-
tures, e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 C. Incubate samples for
~20 min; keep the incubation time consistent between samples.
Meanwhile, equilibrate the temperature of the centrifuge (see
Note 11).
3.3
Data Collection
Determining light and dense phase concentrations works similarly,
with few differences. The differences will be highlighted in the two
subsections below.
3.3.1
Collection of Light
Phase Concentration Data
1. Quickly remove tubes from heating block, dry the tubes so
excess water does not unbalance the rotor, brieﬂy and gently
vortex the tubes, and place into the temperature-equilibrated
centrifuge. Close the inner lid, close the door, and immediately
start spinning for 5 min at max speed (~21,000  g) (see
Note 12, Fig. 3c).
2. When the centrifugation is done, leave the sample tubes in the
centrifuge. Remove one tube at a time, immediately remove
692
Nicole M. Milkovic and Tanja Mittag

7 μL of the light phase, and place into a new, clean 0.5 mL PCR
tube (see Note 13, Fig. 3c).
3. Dilute the light phase at least twofold with a matched buffer
(see Note 14, Fig. 3c). If measuring a phase diagram at
150 mM NaCl, be sure you use an identical buffer containing
150 mM NaCl to dilute your sample at this step (see Note 14).
4. Determine absorbance at 280 nm (A280) of the diluted sample
spectrophotometrically. Rinse pedestal of the spectrophotome-
ter with water from a squirt bottle, dry with a Kimwipe. Deter-
mine the absorbance of the appropriate buffer for subtraction
of the signal, measure absorbance of your samples, and wash
the pedestal with water in between subsequent measurements.
Read the absorbance of each sample multiple times (e.g., mini-
mum three times), to ensure the readings are within <0.03 of
each other (i.e., the accuracy of the instrument) (Fig. 3c).
Reject data points if variation is too large.
3.3.2
Collection of Dense
Phase Concentration Data
1. To generate enough dense phase for easy and accurate pipet-
ting, start with a substantially larger sample volume and higher
protein concentration. E.g., to generate 5 μL of dense phase,
which may have a concentration of 10–30 mM or even higher,

you may need to start with ~200 μL of 1 mM starting concen-
tration. The higher the starting concentration the better, as
long as the protein is well behaved, because a smaller fraction of
protein will go toward making up the light phase. Otherwise,
follow steps 1 and 2 in the above sub-section (Subheading
3.3.1).
2. Remove the supernatant, in several steps if necessary, from the
sample to leave pure dense phase behind. Use a positive dis-
placement pipette to carefully remove a known volume (e.g.,
1 μL) of the dense phase, and place into a 0.5 mL PCR tube
containing a deﬁned volume (e.g., 99 μL) of a matched buffer
containing 6 M GuHCl (see Note 13, Fig. 3c). Choose dilution
volumes for dense phases to be at least 100-fold (see Note 14,
Fig. 3c).
3. Determine A280 spectrophotometrically as mentioned above.
3.4
Data Processing
1. Tabulate the experimental A280 values using your favorite
graphing software (e.g., MATLAB, SigmaPlot, Origin, or
Microsoft® Excel).
2. Convert the absorbance readings into concentrations via Beer-
Lambert law using the molar extinction coefﬁcient of the pro-
tein. Account for the dilutions made in step 3 of the previous
section.

, where A is absorbance at

version), and l is the pathlength (cm).
3. Calculate the variation between your calculated concentrations
as the standard deviation. See Subheading 3.5.2 for the equa-
tion and worked example. (Note: Microscoft ® Excel, and
other graphing software allow for an automated calculation of
a variety of functions.)
4. Plot the light and dense phase protein concentrations on the
x-axis and temperature of additive concentration on the y-axis;
connect light and dense phase concentrations via tie lines. The
data points together reconstruct the coexistence line. Add
error bars.
5. The data can be ﬁt to various models, e.g., to a scaling relation
for binary demixing from
renormalization-group theory
[25–27] or to Flory Huggins-type theory for polymer phase
separation [3].

First-Time Mapping of a
Phase Diagram
1. Because csat for phase separation is unknown, a sample with a
relatively high protein concentration is used.
2. Since phase separation at 150 mM NaCl is measured, a twofold
dilution is required to adjust the NaCl concentration from
300 to 150 mM.

To make any dilution, use the following formula where c is
concentration and V is volume.

3. Mix 118 μL of 2.5 mM hnRNPA1 with 118 μL of a matched
buffer containing no salt (in this case, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5,
5 mM DTT). [hnRNPA1]ﬁnal is now 1.25 mM.
4. The resulting sample is turbid due to dense droplets refracting
the light.
5. Filter the sample, make the necessary aliquots, and continue
with the procedure outlined above.
Subsequent Data
Collections
The data generated for one replicate is shown in Fig. 5. At 30 C,
the hnRNPA1 light phase concentration at 150 mM NaCl is
~300 μM. In the example above, the ﬁnal hnRNPA1 concentration
was 1.25 mM, which is ~4 times more than we need for the assay.
Disordered proteins can be tricky to purify, so rather than con-
stantly depleting the protein stock, we will use it smartly. Here, we
show how to estimate a practically useful starting concentration.
1. A twofold dilution is required to adjust the NaCl concentration
from 300 to 150 mM. Just as we calculated above, we need
118 μL of protein and 118 μL of buffer to dilute the salt to
150 mM.

2. Rather than using 118 μL of the stock protein, we will dilute it
to a concentration just above the initial value of csat to still
obtain phase separation (i.e., we need to pick a concentration
anywhere to the right of the initial coexistence line). For sim-
plicity, we will use 500 μM.
(a)
REMINDER! This is what we want our ﬁnal protein
concentration to be, after all necessary dilutions. There-
fore, we need to consider our ﬁnal twofold dilution to
bring the salt concentration down from 300 to 150 mM.
This means we will need twice as much protein for the ﬁrst
dilution (500 μM  2 ¼ 1000 μM).
(b)
If we were diluting the salt to 100 mM, this would be a
threefold dilution from the current buffer, and we would
need three times as much protein (or 1.5 mM).

experiment is not high enough ([hnRNPA1]input < [hnRNPA1]light phase), then a vertical stack of data points
appears above a certain temperature (orange dots from 20 to 30 C). The experimental series represented by
blue dots used a high enough total input protein concentration. Note: csat obtained from light phase
measurements is being used to highlight this point. For both sets of data, hnRNPA1 is in the same buffer

3. Therefore, to make a practical hnRNPA1 sample, we would do
the following:
(a)
Add 47.2 μL of 2.5 mM hnRNPA1 into a tube.
(b)
Add 70.8 μL of storage buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5,
300 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT). Pipet to mix to the follow-
ing concentrations; [hnRNPA1]current ¼ 1 mM, [NaCl]-
current ¼ 300 mM; Volumecurrent ¼ 118 μL.

Add 118 μL of salt-less buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5,
5 mM DTT). Pipet to mix to reach the ﬁnal concentra-
tions [hnRNPA1]ﬁnal ¼ 0.5 mM, [NaCl]ﬁnal ¼ 150 mM;
Volumeﬁnal ¼ 236 μL.
4. The resulting sample is turbid due to dense droplets refracting

5. Filter the sample, make the necessary aliquots, and continue
with the procedure outlined above.

After centrifuging the samples, removing 7 μL of the light phase,
diluting it by some factor, and collecting A280 readings, it is time to

Notes
1. Reductants must be weighed and added to the working stock
of buffers immediately before use due to their limited stability.
Working stocks and reductant should be made fresh for each
experiment.
2. You could use a water bath or a PCR machine instead of a heat
block. If a PCR machine is used, do not set up a temperature
gradient, as the gradient calculator on a PCR machine only lists
estimated values in between the two extreme temperatures.
3. Although this particular model of centrifuge is rated from 10
to 40 C, the temperature stability is unreliable over 35 C. If
you need a centrifuge that can reliably equilibrate at higher
temperatures, there are some on the market (e.g., Sigma
2-16KHL, rated to 60 C.) We have found them to take longer
time to equilibrate to a set temperature (in some cases >1 h)
and the data generated at higher temperatures had higher
errors, probably due to heat escaping from the centrifuge
during the removal of light phase and partial re-equilibration
at lower temperatures.

4. Various protein buffers (such as Tris, HEPES, MES, etc.) are
empirically chosen based on their ability to buffer a solution at a
speciﬁc pH. Tris should be avoided due to its temperature-
dependent pH variability.
5. Other additives that mediate phase separation can be prepared,
such as a 50% w/v Ficoll-70 solution to vary macromolecular
crowding, or binding partners to increase multivalency.
6. It is important that the concentration of the protein solution is
as high as reasonably achievable, or at least well above csat. The
protein should be stable and not phase separated at the highest
concentration achieved in storage buffer.
7. Having multiple heat blocks is beneﬁcial because you can col-
lect data under multiple conditions (varying salt and tempera-
ture) simultaneously. Filling each of the wells in the heat block
accessories with water is necessary to conduct temperature
evenly across the sample as it equilibrates.
8. The ﬁrst time you measure the coexistence line, a high protein
concentration is useful to determine where the line is. Once
you know csat approximately, you can adjust the starting protein
concentration.
9. The order of sample dilution can be critical, especially if the
ability of the protein to phase separate is modulated by temper-
ature. If phase separation were induced ﬁrst before further
dilution, dense droplets would be the result. Then diluting
the protein concentration with an appropriate buffer would
require an unknown amount of time for the dense and light
phases to re-equilibrate.
10. Filtering removes nuclei for aggregation and should be done
on the phase-separated sample immediately before aliquoting.
Importantly, ﬁltering will not remove phase separation perma-
nently; while droplets will be broken up by the pores, they
reform upon exit. If you know your system forms droplets
(based on microscopy, for example), and the sample is no
longer turbid after ﬁltering, the sample may be interacting
with the ﬁlter’s membrane. Be sure to select a ﬁlter that is
compatible with protein ﬁltration.
11. Centrifuges only remain at the set temperature when they are
in use (i.e., spinning). Therefore, it is important that the cen-
trifuge stops spinning the moment you want to use it. If not,
the temperature is likely not going to be stable over the course
of your spin. Once the run is done, the centrifuge will not hold
the temperature for long. It is important to use a centrifuge
that will tell you when the temperature changes (i.e., Eppen-
dorf’s 5424R) once the run is started. If this is the case, save
Phase Diagrams by Centrifugation
699

your samples by immediately stopping the spin, and return the
tubes to their temperature-equilibrated heating block. Stand-
ing by, re-equilibrate the temperature of the centrifuge and
repeat.
12. Other groups spin for less time (<15 s at 10,000  g) or lower
speed (~3 h at 600  g) [6, 19]. We have found that spinning
more than 5 min at maximum speed does not change the values
obtained for the light phase concentration.
13. For a temperature-dependent phase-separating protein, it is
important to leave your sample tubes in the temperature-
equilibrated rotor while you remove the light phase from the
current tube. The data you are obtaining is for a sample whose
dense and light phases are in equilibrium. For example,
hnRNPA1 phase separates more readily at lower temperatures.
If the sample tube is removed from the rotor, it is at room
temperature (~20–23 C) where hnRNPA1 is less prone to
phase separation. This will result in protein re-equilibrating
between the light and dense phases, introducing an error into
the light phase measurements. Leaving the sample tubes in the
rotor reduces this error during the time needed to ﬁnish
pipetting.
14. It is important to dilute the sample enough so the concentra-
tion of the diluted light and dense phases is too dilute to phase
separate at room temperature. We recommend dilution of at
least dense phase samples in buffered 6 M guanidinium hydro-
chloride to prevent samples from phase separating and improv-
ing the accuracy of concentration measurements [19, 28].

In Vitro Transition Temperature Measurement
of Phase-Separating Proteins by Microscopy
Jack Holland, Michael D. Crabtree, and Timothy J. Nott
Abstract
Intracellular compartmentalization through liquid-liquid phase separation is an emerging organizing
principle of cell biology. These compartments, such as the nucleolus and stress granules, are collectively
known as membraneless organelles or biomolecular condensates. In vitro studies of many protein compo-
nents of biomolecular condensates, such as the intrinsically disordered regions of Ddx4, FUS, and Laf-1
proteins, have revealed much about the driving forces of the phase separation process. A common approach
is to investigate how the temperature at which a protein solution forms condensates—the transition
temperature—responds to changes in the solution composition. We describe a method to measure the
in vitro transition temperature of a sub-10 μL sample of a phase-separating solution using transmitted light
microscopy. Through monitoring changes in transition temperature with solution conditions, this approach
allows the impact of additional biomolecules and additives to be quantitatively assessed and permits the
construction of phase diagrams.

Introduction
In recent years, it has become clear that a range of proteins undergo
liquid-liquid phase separation to form biomolecular condensates
both in vitro [1–6] and in vivo [1, 6–11]. In vitro phase separation
typically appears as a stark change in the turbidity of a sample,
caused by the formation of micrometer-sized protein-rich conden-
sates. The phase separation process is triggered by a change in
environmental conditions or solution composition; changes in pro-
tein concentration, pH, and ionic strength have all been shown to
effect condensate formation [1, 4, 12–14]. The stability of these
condensates can be ascertained by measuring the temperature at
which
phase
separation
occurs—the
transition
temperature
[6, 15]. The general procedure is to plot the transition temperature

as a function of protein concentration, generating a phase diagram,
as illustrated in Fig. 1. From this, it is possible to apply Flory-
Huggins theory [16], extracting a value for the mean-ﬁeld interac-
tion parameter that governs the phase separation. We have previ-
ously performed this for biomolecular condensates formed from
the intrinsically disordered tail of RNA helicase Ddx4, Ddx4N
[1]. By plotting phase diagrams at different NaCl concentrations,
we were able to show that the interaction parameter was sensitive to
ionic strength. Therefore, this indicated that Ddx4N condensates
were stabilized primarily by electrostatic interactions between
charged residues.
Here, we describe the utilization of the change in sample
turbidity associated with phase separation to measure the transition
temperature using differential interference contrast (DIC) micros-
copy (see Note 1). The method outlined was developed primarily
using recombinantly expressed and puriﬁed Ddx4N, a 236 amino
acid disordered region found at the N-terminus of Ddx4 protein.
For substances with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST),
such as Ddx4N, phase separation occurs as the temperature is
decreased. The protocol detailed here applies directly to proteins
with a UCST but, with a few modiﬁcations is equally applicable to
proteins with a lower critical solution temperature (see Note 2).
Fig. 1 Sketch of a typical phase diagram for a protein with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST). As
the temperature of a sample prepared at starting concentration and temperature, (c,T1), is decreased, phase
separation occurs as the temperature passes through Tp, the transition temperature. Varying the protein
concentration and recording transition temperatures allow a phase diagram to be plotted. The red dots
illustrate the type of data this method produces, and their relation to the phase diagram. (Inset) Typical phase
diagram for a protein with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST)

Jack Holland et al.

Typical phase diagrams of proteins with a LCST and a UCST are
illustrated in Fig. 1.
We generate a phase-separating solution of Ddx4N by diluting
the protein solution 1:1 with a low ionic strength solution (e.g.,
water) at high temperature. Owing to the dependency of the
Ddx4N transition temperature on ionic strength [1], this generates
a solution that will phase separate within the temperature range
investigated (10–50 C). We use DIC microscopy to take grayscale
images of the phase-separating protein solution. Images are
recorded as a temperature-controlled microscope stage is used to
slowly decrease the temperature of the sample. From these images,
the standard deviation in pixel intensity, extracted using ImageJ
[17], is used as a proxy for turbidity. We have made a Python 2.7
script available, which analyzes the pixel intensity standard devia-
tion as a function of temperature and outputs the transition tem-
perature. This method will be useful for the investigation of the
nature of the interactions contributing to the phase separation of a
given protein.

Materials
2.1
Proteins
and Buffers
Phase-separating protein should be stored in a buffer that maintains
the solution as a single phase at temperatures above 0 C. Owing to
the dependency of the Ddx4N transition temperature on ionic
strength, we use a 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl, 5 mM tris
(2-carboxyethyl)phoshpine (TCEP), pH 8.0 buffer to store
Ddx4N. For extended storage, the protein should be snap frozen
using liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C. The diluent (see Note
3) of choice should be prepared in advance and ﬁltered with a
0.22 μm ﬁlter. Here, we use deionized water with a resistivity of
18.2 MΩ cm for dilution.

Microscope
and Thermal Stage
Setup
Setting up the microscope and temperature-controlled stage
should be done prior to setting up samples.
1. Fill the 2 L Duran bottle with deionized water.
2. Set up the Linkam PE120 stage by connecting the stage to the
water in the Duran bottle, via the Peristaltic pump P-1 as in
Fig. 2, using silicone rubber tubing.
3. Place the Linkam PE120 stage onto the microscope stage, as in
Fig. 2. Using the Peristaltic pump P-1, ﬂow water through the
thermal stage with the pump set to 10 at 10. Once the system
is full of deionized water (and completely purged of air), hold
the thermal stage to 50 C.
3.2
Sample
Preparation
The sample preparation steps involving the glass coverslips should
be carried out in as clean an environment as possible (see Note 6).
1. To prepare the sample for phase separation, remove an aliquot
of Ddx4N from cryogenic storage (or otherwise) and place in a
rack at room temperature. The protein solution should not be
agitated or warmed up through any external means.
2. Both the Ddx4N solution and the dilution solution should be
heated up to 50 C on the thermomixer for 3 min (see Note 7).
706
Jack Holland et al.

3. Combine 4.7 μL Ddx4N (350 μM in storage buffer) with
4.7 μL diluent in a new thin-walled PCR tube. Mix via pipet-
ting and keep at 50 C on the thermomixer.
4. Using scissors, trim each corner off the imaging spacer so the
spacer ﬁts entirely within the diameter of the siliconized glass
coverslips, as seen in Fig. 3.
5. Attach the imaging spacer to a siliconized glass coverslip by
using tweezers to peel off the opaque layer. Then press the
adhesive transparent layer against the coverslip.
6. Using a black marker, make a dot on the coverslip outside of
the imaging spacer, as shown in Fig. 3.
7. Peel off the top layer from the imaging spacer, revealing the
second adhesive layer, and place the coverslip onto the 50 C
heating block in the thermomixer (leave the lid off the thermo-
mixer if it has one).
8. Pipette 9.1 μL diluted phase-separating protein solution (see
Note 8) onto the area in the center of the imaging spacer on
the coverslip, as in Fig. 3. Wait for any visible air bubbles to pop
(see Note 9).

as a heat sink and should be kept at room temperature. We typically use an Olympus BX43 microscope with a

should be carried out with the bottom coverslip kept at 50 C by placing it on a heating block. The top coverslip
should also be preheated to 50 C, before being brought into contact with the phase-separating solution

9. Take a second glass coverslip and use the green marker to make
a dot near the edge.
10. With the green dot facing downward, carefully place the sec-
ond coverslip on top of the coverslip carrying the phase separ-
ating solution, as in Fig. 3, ensuring the two dots overlap, not
overlay, when looked down on from above.
11. Seal the sample by applying light pressure onto the top cover-
slip with a pipette tip, pressing down along the region above
the imaging spacer (see Note 10).
3.3
Data Collection
1. Place the sample onto the temperature-controlled microscope
stage (preheated to 50 C).
2. Focus the microscope on the black dot on the bottom coverslip
and then on the green dot on the top coverslip. Find the focal
plane in the center of the sample by focusing half way between
the black and green dots (see Fig. 4).
3. Bring the phase-separating solution into the ﬁeld of view.
4. Set up the temperature ramp, beginning with 2 min at 50 C,
affording a baseline measurement of turbidity, followed by a
2 C/min ramp down to 10 C, illustrated in Fig. 5 (see
Note 11).
5. Set
the
image

settings,
recording
an
image
(1280  960 pixels) every 10 s throughout the temperature
ramp. We adjust the microscope LED brightness so that an
exposure time of 20 ms yields a gray image (see Fig. 6).
6. Commence the temperature ramp and image capture simulta-
neously. Phase separation via nucleation and growth will mani-
fest as the appearance of small droplets (see Note 12).
3.4
Analysis
1. Import the image series into ImageJ.
2. Add ﬁve equally sized regions of interest (see Note 13) cover-
ing, in total, around 20% of the image, as in Fig. 6.
3. Open “set measurements” and select only “standard deviation”
and set “decimal places (0–9)” to 3.
4. Select all ROIs in the ROI manager and click “multi-measure.”
This will display a spreadsheet of data that should then be saved
as a .csv ﬁle.
5. Replace the second column of the data (Label) with frame-by-
frame temperature values. For times greater than 2 min, T
(t) ¼ 50  2/60  t, where t has units of seconds and repre-
sents the capture time of each frame.
6. Remove the ﬁrst row (column headers) from the spreadsheet.
The columns should now contain frame number, temperature,
ROI1 standard deviation, ROI2 standard deviation, ROI3

Notes
1. DIC microscopy results in greater changes in pixel intensity
standard deviation (turbidity) upon phase separation than
using brightﬁeld microscopy. However, the method can be
equivalently
implemented
using
other
transmitted
light
microscopy techniques such as brightﬁeld, darkﬁeld, and
phase contrast.
2. Proteins with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST)
[18] undergo liquid-liquid phase separation as the temperature
is increased (see Fig. 1 (inset)). To probe this phenomenon with
the method detailed here, prepare your phase-separating solu-
tion at a low temperature (at 10 C, instead of 50 C, for
example). The temperature ramp should be set to record a
baseline measurement at a low temperature, followed by a
constant increase in temperature. The relevant adjustments
required for “get_transition_temperature.py” are included in
Fig. 6 Selecting ﬁve regions of interest (ROI). The regions of interest selected should be of equal size and

the script ﬁle as comments. Once these adjustments have been
made, the method is identical.
3. Phase separation can be controlled by altering the solution
composition and temperature. This is the role of the diluent.
For Ddx4N, we dilute the protein in storage buffer 1:1 with a
solution of low ionic strength, halving both the salt and protein
concentration. This brings the solution composition to a point
where phase separation can occur at experimentally accessible
temperatures. Many phase-separating proteins are driven to

temperature ramp. The transition temperature (36.2  0.6 C) is reported as the mean of the ﬁrst
temperatures at which the difference in standard deviation in pixel intensity (from the baseline) of each ROI
rises above the threshold value, here set to 10, with the uncertainty corresponding to the standard deviation of
these temperatures. Each letter indicates the point at which each corresponding image was taken

phase separate by, like Ddx4N, electrostatic interactions
between charged residues [13, 19]. If altering the ionic
strength does not result in a phase-separating solution, we
recommend
further
concentrating

starting
protein
solution.
4. For Ddx4N we have found that with siliconized glass coverslips,
the phase separation occurs primarily in the center of the sam-
ple, away from the liquid–glass interface. It may be that your
protein sticks to the siliconized glass coverslips, or preferen-
tially nucleates condensates on the siliconized surface. If this is
the case, we recommend using coverslips with an alternative/
lack of coating.
5. The Linkam PE120 is a Peltier-controlled thermal stage that is
easily mounted onto the table of many upright microscopes.
Temperature control is achieved through the Linkam T95
controller, which interfaces between the PE120 thermal stage
and a computer through proprietary software. This particular
model allows samples to be held in the range 20 C to 120 C
with an accuracy of 0.1 C, making it ideal for transition
temperature measurements.
6. Samples are prepared ideally in a dust-free environment. The
contamination of samples by large particulates has been seen to
affect phase separation, often acting as droplet nucleation sites.
7. It is important to prepare the phase-separating solution above a
temperature at which it phase separates. If your solution turns
cloudy upon combining the diluent with the protein solution,
you can try preparing the solution at a higher temperature. You
may also wish to generate protein sample at a lower
concentration.
8. It has been found that 9.1 μL of sample is enough to generate
bubble-free samples for the 9 mm internal diameter 0.12 mm
thick imaging spacer setup we use. Therefore, we overcompen-
sate by 0.3 μL when preparing the phase-separating solution.
9. We often ﬁnd that one or two large air bubbles are generated
during the pipetting of the sample onto the coverslip. Waiting
for a short period of time, 5–10 s allows the air bubbles to pop.
Be careful not to wait much longer. As the sample is maintained
at 50 C and exposed to the air, the solution will evaporate.
10. The difﬁculty of this step is noted. Common difﬁculties faced
by the inexperienced are: signiﬁcant leakage of the sample, the
generation of many air bubbles, and cracking of the coverslip
glass. We recommend practicing the sample set up with water
before commencing experiments with more precious samples.
11. The rate of the temperature ramp should be reduced until there

temperature. Beyond this point, there is no gain from a slower
temperature ramp. For Ddx4N, we have found that a tempera-
ture ramp of 2 C/min is optimal, minimizing the effect of
kinetics on the measurement, whilst also minimizing the dura-
tion of the temperature ramp. This is because the transition
temperature
is
a
thermodynamic
measurement—a
slow
enough temperature ramp allows the system to exist at thermal
equilibrium. A fast temperature ramp often results in an under-
estimate of the transition temperature, as there has not been
enough time for the kinetics of phase separation to proceed
before the temperature is altered.
12. You may also see the generation of an extended pattern struc-
ture. This is phase separation by spinodal decomposition
[20]. If no phase separation was observed during the tempera-
ture ramp, then the protein concentration should be raised.
Thus far, phase separating intrinsically disordered proteins have
shown saturation concentrations under ambient conditions in
the 106–104 M range. It is also possible that your protein
concentration is too high, but this is expected only for mM
concentrations of protein. If this is the case, try reducing your
protein concentration.
13. To add the required regions of interest (ROIs), open the ROI
manager and draw a circular region of interest (shift + click and
drag) and then click “add” on the ROI manager. Add another,
evenly sized ROI, by clicking on the original ROI’s label in the
ROI manager, highlighting it, and clicking add. Another ROI
label should appear in the ROI manager, and a new ROI will be
overlaid on top of the old ROI. Now highlight the new ROI
label in the ROI manager. It should now be possible to drag
the new ROI overlaid on the old ROI to a new position. Once
the new ROI is in its desired position, click “update” on the
ROI manager. Repeat this process until there are ﬁve evenly
sized ROIs on your image. All ROIs can be visualized by
ticking the “show all” box on the ROI manager, as in Fig. 5.
14. The ﬁrst argument of the “get_transition_temperature.py”
python script, “pre”, refers to the number of frames for
which the temperature was held constant at the start of the
temperature ramp. The script takes the mean of the standard
deviation for each ROI across these frames, calculating a base-
line standard deviation. The second argument, “std_num,”
refers to the number of standard deviations away from the
baseline beyond which a solution is deemed to have phase
separated, typically we use a value of 10 for “std_num.”

Walking Along a Protein Phase Diagram to Determine
Coexistence Points by Static Light Scattering

Abstract
The physical process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), where the drive to minimize global free
energy causes a solution to demix into dense and light phases, plays many important roles in biology. It is
implicated in the formation of so-called “membraneless organelles” such as nucleoli, nuclear speckles,
promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies, P bodies, and stress granules along with the formation of biomo-
lecular condensates involved in transcription, signaling, and transport. Quantitative studies of LLPS in vivo
are complicated by the out-of-equilibrium, multicomponent cellular environment. While in vitro experi-
ments with puriﬁed biomolecules are inherently an oversimpliﬁcation of the cellular milieu, they allow
probing of the rich physical chemistry underlying phase separation. Critically, with the application of
suitable models, the thermodynamics of equilibrium LLPS can inform on the nature of the intermolecular
interactions that mediate it. These same interactions are likely to exist in out-of-equilibrium condensates
within living cells. Phase diagrams map the coexistence points between dense and light phases and
quantitatively describe LLPS by mapping the local minima of free energy versus biomolecule concentration.
Here, we describe a light scattering method that allows one to measure coexistence points around a high-
temperature critical region using sample volumes as low as 10 μl.

Introduction
Many proteins and nucleic acids can undergo a phenomenon called
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), in which molecules sponta-
neously coalesce into protein- and/or nucleic acid–rich dense
phases in response to changes in conditions that impact solubility.
In enthalpically driven phase transitions, this density discontinuity
can be driven through the formation of a network of weak multiva-
lent interactions [1, 2]. These weak multivalent interactions, with
fast on- and off-rates, give rise to the dynamic, liquid-like properties
of the resulting assemblies. The role of LLPS in the formation of
particular membraneless organelles (MLOs) has been proposed

previously, but was ﬁrst experimentally demonstrated by Brang-
wynne et al.; the authors showed that P granules and nucleoli
exhibited properties of liquids [1, 3] such as the ability to drip,
fuse, and wet surfaces. Since then, extensive evidence has not only
highlighted that LLPS is involved in the formation of MLOs, but
that it also plays roles in a multitude of cellular processes such as
formation of transcription complexes and heterochromatin [4–7].
An interesting observation is that proteins containing intrinsi-
cally disordered low-complexity domains (LCDs), i.e., domains
with a low sequence complexity, are enriched in membraneless
organelles [8]. In vitro, several examples including the germ gran-
ule protein DDX4, the germ granule protein LAF-1, and stress
granule proteins FUS, hnRNPA1, and TDP-43 [9–13] phase sepa-
rate as simple two-component protein-solvent systems. LCDs can
contribute to multivalency via linking folded modular interaction
domains such as SH3 domains in Nck via proline-rich motifs in the
protein N-WASP [2, 4]. Additionally, multivalency can be directly
patterned into the LCD sequence as speciﬁc amino acids or short
linear
motifs
that
interact
homotypically
with
each
other
[9, 14]. Interactions between these biomolecules can be modeled
by adapting the “stickers-and-spacers” framework suggested by
Semenov and Rubinstein [15] and adapted by Harmon and
Pappu [16], where the protein domains or motifs are the stickers
while the intrinsically disordered linkers are the spacers [17]. Phase
diagrams are the currency of materials science due to the fact that
they report on the thermodynamics of the underlying interactions
driving the phase transition. Phase diagrams map the coexistence
points between dense and light phases, which are characterized by
local minima of free energy versus biomolecule concentration and a
variable such as temperature, pH, or ionic strength (Fig. 1). The
resulting data can be ﬁt to theoretical models to extract thermody-
namic parameters such as the critical temperature, the free energy of
mixing, and the χ parameter that describes two-body interactions.
These parameters provide insight into the nature of the interactions
involved [18, 19].
A prerequisite to ﬁtting theoretical models to phase diagrams is
to determine with as many points as possible the shape of the curve.
This requires determining the temperature dependence of the con-
centration of the dilute and the dense phases and the critical point,
i.e., the critical concentration and temperature (Fig. 1). The left
arm of the phase diagram signiﬁes the protein concentration within
the dilute phase, while the right arm signiﬁes the protein concen-
tration in the dense phase. Points are often determined using a
combination of different methods such as sedimenting the dense
phase and measuring the concentrations via the UV absorbance of
the light and dense phases spectrophotometrically [10, 18, 20–22]
and using ﬂuorescence intensity or ﬂuorescence correlation spec-
troscopy (FCS) to measure concentrations using the amplitude of
716

the autocorrelation function [19]. A common method to deter-
mine points along the coexistence line is to measure the cloud point
at a known protein concentration as the temperature is changed
[23, 24]. Historically, the cloud point could be measured by a
careful observer monitoring by eye at what temperature a solution
became “cloudy.” The “cloudiness” indicates the presence of mac-
romolecular condensates resulting from crossing a phase boundary.
This turbidity is due to dense protein droplets strongly scattering
light and can thus be detected (with arguably greater accuracy than
by eye) spectroscopically. This increase in turbidity is often detected
by absorbance readings at 340 nm to 600 nm, or by an increase in
the static light scattering (SLS) intensity [14, 23].
Here we describe a method that was used to determine points
on the phase diagram around the critical point of the hnRNPA1
LCD, which is close to 60 C [25]. hnRNPA1 is a protein found in
stress granules that contains two folded RNA-binding domains and
a disordered LCD. A mutation within the LCD has been implicated
in neurodegenerative disease [26]. The LCD is required for the
full-length protein to undergo LLPS in the absence of RNA, but
the LCD can phase separate in the absence of the RNA-binding

Fig. 1 A cartoon representation of a phase diagram for a protein with an upper
critical solution temperature (UCST). Proteins with a UCST cannot undergo phase
separation at a temperature higher than this critical point. The black curve is
known as the coexistence line, and it indicates the boundary between the
one-phase and two-phase regimes. To the left of the coexistence line from the
critical point, the protein is in the dilute one-phase regime. Once the left arm of
the coexistence curve is crossed (i.e., at the saturation concentration), droplets
ﬁrst appear and two phases, light and dense, are present. At this point the
solution turns turbid or cloudy due to the scattering of light by the droplets and
thus is also known as the cloud point. As the concentration is increased from left
to right through the two-phase regime, the fraction of light phase decreases
while the fraction of dense phase increases. However, the concentration of
protein in the light phase and the dense phases remains constant, and its
determination allows the construction of the left and right arms of the phase
diagram, respectively. Once the right arm of the coexistence curve is crossed,
only a single dense phase is present

domains [12]. The protein exhibits upper critical solution temper-
ature behavior (UCST); i.e., the driving force for phase behavior
weakens with increasing temperature and the protein solution does
not phase separate above the critical temperature (Fig. 1).
The light and dense phase concentrations of the LCD can be
determined by sedimentation and spectrophotometric measure-
ments as described by Milkovic and Mittag [21]. With this method,
coexistence concentrations below and up to room temperature are
easily accessible. However, the critical point is well above room
temperature, leaving a large part of the coexistence line undeter-
mined and data essential to ﬁtting analytical and empirical models
missing. To overcome this limitation, we devised cloud point mea-
surements in the vicinity of the critical point (Figs. 2 and 3). These
measurements demand high protein concentrations, and we will lay
out below how to generate the necessary samples.

dense phase. The phase-separated sample is then centrifuged to obtain a light
phase with a protein concentration indicated by the blue circle and a dense
phase concentration indicated by the green circle. In Step 2, some of the light
phase is removed in order to generate a more concentrated protein solution
needed to access points around the critical point; this is equivalent to moving
horizontally to the right within the two-phase regime. In Step 3, the sample is
heated into the one-phase regime, mixed by gentle tapping and then added to a
temperature-equilibrated light scattering cuvette. Step 4 represents the
temperature ramp with which the sample is gradually cooled. Phase
separation occurs at the cloud point which is indicated by the orange circle
(see also Fig. 3 for additional cloud points). The pink line is known as the tie line
and all conditions on this line result in two phases with ﬁxed light phase and
dense phase concentrations. Only the volume fractions of the phases vary
relative to each other. Note that this method only applies to systems that
undergo reversible phase separation (i.e., the sample is heated into the
one-phase regime after being previously phase-separated; fast gelation of the
liquid dense phase may interfere with the procedure)

The phase behavior of the hnRNPA1 LCD is salt-dependent;
i.e., the protein remains diffuse in the absence of excess NaCl
(Fig. 2). NaCl is added to initiate phase separation, and the result-
ing dense phase is pelleted using centrifugation. Note that LLPS
must be reversible for this protocol; a good indication is a transpar-
ent, liquid pellet formed from fully coalesced droplets. Reversibility
of LLPS should be tested via scattering measurements. After sedi-
mentation of the dense phase, part of the light phase is removed,
and the remaining light and dense phases are heated into the
one-phase regime and mixed thoroughly to give rise to a highly
concentrated sample in the one-phase regime. This yields a solution
with a high enough protein concentration needed to access regions
near the critical point. The sample is added to a preheated cuvette,
and the static light scattering intensity is monitored as the temper-
ature is reduced until the phase boundary between the one-phase
and two-phase regimes is crossed. A sudden increase in light scat-
tering intensity indicates the formation of large species, which in
this case are droplets. This should be veriﬁed microscopically.
In the case of the hnRNPA1 LCD, we purify the protein under
denaturing conditions and store it in 4 M GndHCl at 4 C; this
strategy leads to favorable yields, prevents proteolytic degradation,
and results in soluble and monomeric protein during extended

Fig. 3 A schematic of the method. Beginning on the top left, phase separation is induced by adding NaCl and
the sample in the two-phase regime is incubated at a low temperature for at least 20 min (Fig. 2, Step 1). The
droplets are sedimented at the same temperature, and a large fraction of the light phase (40–80%) is removed
in order to generate a more concentrated protein solution (Fig. 2, Step 2). The sample is then heated up into
the one phase regime above the critical point and mixed thoroughly (Fig. 2, Step 3). The heated sample is
added to a pre-heated cuvette and light scattering instrument, and the temperature is gradually reduced
(Fig. 2, Step 4). The static light scattering intensity increases sharply upon phase separation (bottom right
graph). The temperature with the steepest increase in scattering intensity, the inﬂection point of the curve, is
taken to be the cloud point. The cloud point temperature is then plotted at the protein concentration of the
sample that was analyzed. Multiple such experiments are performed to deﬁne the coexistence line close to the
critical point of the phase diagram

storage periods. It is therefore necessary to exchange the protein
into a native buffer without denaturant prior to performing the
experiments. This protocol is applicable to other phase separating
proteins, including those with folded domains, although certain
modiﬁcations may be necessary. For example, denaturants and high
temperature can disrupt folded regions of proteins irreversibly,
altering their physical and chemical properties including their
phase separation behavior. Strategies to generate the necessary
high protein concentrations will therefore depend on the system
being studied.
It must be emphasized that this protocol applies to systems for
which phase separation is reversible with respect to temperature.
This is the case because the sample is ﬁrst heated from the
two-phase regime into the one-phase regime, but the cloud point
is determined when the sample is subsequently cooled back into the
two-phase regime (Fig. 2). The method described here allows the
measurement of a sufﬁcient number of cloud points along the phase
diagram in order to ﬁt theoretical models from polymer physics that
provide insight into the sequence-speciﬁc driving forces for LLPS.

Methods
This protocol assumes that the conditions under which the protein
of interest undergoes LLPS are known; i.e., whether the protein
requires certain concentrations of salts, a binding partner, nucleic
acids, and/or macromolecular crowding to induce LLPS, and
under which conditions the protein is in the one-phase regime.
We recommend that the presence of droplets is veriﬁed by
microscopy.
Here, we describe a procedure to exchange the hnRNPA1 LCD
sample from denaturing into native conditions; this is done in a
two-step process to avoid aggregation. The native buffer conditions
without excess salt result in the sample being in the one-phase
regime. Then, phase separation is induced, and cloud points deter-
mined subsequently.
3.1
Buffer Exchange
for Protein That Is
Under Denaturing
Conditions
1. Use 0.5 ml of 1 mM protein in denaturant solution, e.g., 4 M
GndHCl.
2. Mix 3.5 ml 1 M MES into the sample to reach a 1:8 dilution of
the denaturant concentration (see Note 4).
3. Add the 4 ml sample to a 4 ml Amicon centrifugal ﬁlter, and
spin at ~20,000  g until the sample is concentrated to
~0.5 ml. Stop every 15 min to mix the sample via gentle
pipetting (see Note 5).
4. Add another 3.5 ml of 1 M MES pH 5.5, mix, and reconcen-
trate as in Step 2.
5. Filter the sample through a 4 mm 0.22 μm syringe ﬁlter.
6. Dialyze the 0.5 ml sample overnight against 1 L 20 mM
HEPES pH 7.0.
7. Remove the sample and measure the absorbance at 280 nm
using the dialysis buffer as a blank and calculate the protein
concentration.
3.2
Preparation
of the Light Scattering
Instrument
1. Turn on the DynaPro NanoStar DLS.
2. Estimate the critical point and set the sample chamber to a
temperature above this. For the LCD, which has a critical
temperature of ~60 C, we begin the ramp at 70 C and
decrease the temperature continuously at a rate of 0.3–1 C/
min (see Note 6).
3. Thoroughly clean the 1 μl quartz cuvette. The cuvette may be
stored in 2% Hellmanex solution (Hellma Analytics) to prevent
protein deposits. Wash the cuvette extensively with water, then
with 70–100% ethanol. Dry with canned air (see Note 7).
722
Ivan Peran et al.

4. Place the thoroughly cleaned cuvette inside the sample com-
partment and allow it to reach 70 C or any other chosen
temperature that is above the estimated critical point (see
Note 8).
5. Turn on the connected PC and go to the Dynamics (version 7)
software, or the software speciﬁc to the instrument being used.
6. Go to “File” and choose “New” to begin a new experiment.
7. Ensure that the static light scattering detector is turned on. To
see the signal on the display, hit the TAB to scroll over to the
ﬁrst drop menu “Set Scale,” hit enter, then select “Static Light
Scattering.” A plot of the static light scattering intensity, in
volts, as a function of time will be displayed.
8. Go to the ﬁrst icon in the new experiment window to connect
the software to the instrument. Once connected, a green light
will appear.
9. On the left menu under parameters, go to Fixed. For “Collec-
tion type,” choose “Event Schedule.”
10. On the left menu go to “Event schedule.” Prepare the event
schedule as shown in Table 1 (see Note 9).
3.3
Sample
Preparation for Light
Scattering
The sample volume should be determined by the desired volume
plus the volume loss due to ﬁltering. A sample volume of ~ 100 μl is
useful; however, other volume sizes are possible and depend on the
total sample concentration, the light-phase and the dense-phase
concentrations, and the size of the light scattering cuvette.
1. Pipette 95 μl of the sample into a clean 0.5 ml centrifuge tube.
2. Add 5 μl of high salt buffer and mix gently so that the ﬁnal
NaCl concentration is 150 mM. The sample will become turbid
as a result of phase separation.
3. Filter the phase-separated protein using a 1 ml syringe
equipped with a 0.22 μm ﬁlter (4 mm diameter) into a clean
0.5 ml tube in order to remove any aggregates that may have
formed along with the phase-separated droplets.
4. Pre-equilibrate a microcentrifuge to the temperature at which
the sample will be incubated in the following step, e.g., 4 C
(see Note 10).
5. Incubate the sample in the heating block at 4 C (or another
chosen temperature under
which the protein is phase-
separated) for at least 20 min.
6. Spin the sample in the temperature-equilibrated microcentri-
fuge at ~20,000  g for 10 min to sediment the dense phase;
then remove a desired amount of light phase (between 25 and
75 μl). Keep this sample to determine the protein concentra-
tion at a later time (see Note 11).

7. Heat the remaining sample to a temperature at which the
protein is in the one-phase regime. Mix the sample thoroughly
but gently by tapping or pipetting up and down.
8. Take 2 μl of the mixed protein solution in the one-phase regime
using a regular or positive displacement pipette and dilute it
into 4 M GndHCl buffer to measure the absorbance at 280 nm
at a later time and determine the protein concentration (see
Note 12).
9. Take the sample and incubate it in a heating block next to the
light scattering instrument at 70 C.
3.4

2. Begin the temperature ramp (decreasing the temperature for a
protein with a UCST transition).
3. After observing an increase in scattering along with the
pre-transition and post-transition baselines, the method can
be stopped (see Note 14).

Data Analysis

perature, preferably in csv format.
2. Plot the data in any graphing software and determine the
tangent with the greatest slope. The temperature is taken as
the cloud point (see Note 15).

Notes
1. The buffer should be prepared so as to avoid undesirable phase
separation during the exchange process, especially when other
processes such as aggregation may occur. The LCD of
hnRNPA1 has a low driving force for phase separation in the
absence of salt, and care is taken to avoid the introduction of
salt into the buffer.
2. The method requires pipetting of a highly concentrated pro-
tein solution; in the case of the hnRNPA1 LCD the concentra-
tion is 5–10 mM. Such solutions can be viscous and difﬁcult to
pipette using a regular air displacement pipettor. Positive dis-
placement pipettes have been designed for accurate pipetting of
viscous or volatile liquids.
3. Right angle static scattering measurements can be approxi-
mated by monitoring the amount of transmitted light in a
UV-vis spectrophotometer, e.g., at 600 nm. We chose to use
light scattering due to its superior sensitivity and small sample
volume requirement, i.e., 10 μl of sample as opposed to 100 μl
required for typical temperature-dependent UV absorbance
readings.
4. The protein under study will be exchanged from its storage
buffer into a buffer that is desired for the experiment. The
method of exchange will depend on the particular protein. An
example is provided for the hnRNPA1 LCD. This protein is
aggregation-prone, and the protocol has been optimized to
prevent aggregation. If the protein sample is directly diluted
from denaturant into HEPES buffer without the intermediate
step of going through 1 M MES, the resulting sample aggre-
gates. The protocol needs to be optimized for other proteins.
5. Centrifugation often results in a concentration gradient within
the protein solution, with a higher concentration of protein
found close to the ﬁlter. To avoid problems with aggregation,
Determining Coexistence Points by Static Light Scattering
725

we recommend stopping centrifugation every 15 min and mix-
ing the sample so that the protein remains relatively homoge-
nously distributed throughout the sample.
6. The ramp should be started at 5–10 C above the estimated
cloud point in order to observe a pre-transition baseline. Avoid
leaving the sample at a high temperature and concentration for
an extended period of time. The ramp rate is a compromise; it
should be as slow as possible to be close to equilibrium, and as
fast as necessary to avoid prolonged high sample temperatures.
We use ramp rates of 0.3–1 C/min.
7. The cuvette should be thoroughly cleaned with water, rinsed
with ethanol or acetone, and dried with canned air. Care should
be taken to avoid getting dust particles into the cuvette that can
affect detector readings and seed aggregate formation.
8. The sample cuvette should be heated to the temperature at
which the ramp will be started to avoid immediate phase
separation.
9. The laser power is set as low as possible to prevent signal
saturation from strong scattering upon droplet formation.
The temperature ramp rate can be calculated using the ramp
rate calculator. The optimum rate is determined based on the
initial and ﬁnal temperatures, the change in temperature during
which a single point is measured, and the acquisition time and
the number of acquisitions at each temperature. We choose the
“don’t wait” option (speciﬁc to the Wyatt DynaPro NanoStar)
when setting the ﬁnal temperature. This option allows a
smooth and continuous temperature ramp without stopping
at a certain temperature during data collection. The average
value of the temperatures during which a single data point is
acquired is reported.
10. If the concentration of sample being analyzed is determined by
conservation of mass (see Note 12), then the concentration of
the light phase must be determined using absorbance. In this
case, the temperature should be chosen so that the protein
undergoes LLPS, but that the concentration of protein in the
light phase is high enough for the absorbance to be measured
(which will depend on the extinction coefﬁcient), after dilution
into denaturant. If no Tyr or Trp residues are present, then
concentration can be determined using colorimetric protein
assays such as the Bradford method or via absorbance at a
wavelength for which the extinction coefﬁcient can be
determined [27].
11. When removing a small amount of light phase to measure its
absorbance at a later time, it is best to dilute it into a denaturant
solution to avoid problems with solubility that may arise
over time.
726
Ivan Peran et al.

12. The concentration of the sample can alternatively be deter-
mined using the principle of conservation of mass if pipetting
error is a worry. This is done using the volume and concentra-
tion of the starting sample (in which phase separation is
induced) and the volume and concentration of the light
phase that is removed. This allows determination of the total
number of moles in the starting volume, the number of moles
removed, and therefore the number of moles and volume
remaining. For more accurate values, the mass of the solution
can be measured on an analytical balance and converted into a
volume assuming a density of 1 g/ml. This method also allows
for cross-checking with absorbance readings as the values
determined by both methods should be identical within error.
13. The sample should be uniformly mixed and in the one-phase
regime before being added to the cuvette.
14. If light scattering is too intense and the detector on the instru-
ment cannot be attenuated, the signal will saturate before
reaching a post-transition baseline as shown in the example in
Fig. 4a. Additionally, droplets may sink to the bottom of the
cuvette over time, which can result in a decrease in scattering
intensity within the post-transition region (Fig. 4b). In our
case, accurate cloud point readings were still possible due to the
sharp transition around the cloud point (see Subheading 3.5).
The importance of using an imaging method to conﬁrm that
the increase in light scattering is a result of droplet formation is
stressed, given that the formation of other higher order com-
plexes may result in similar signals.
15. We designate the temperature with the steepest change in light
scattering signal (the inﬂection point) as the cloud point rather
than the point at which scattering ﬁrst increases (Figs. 3 and 4).
The initial scattering increase may indicate the formation of
higher order species prior to droplet formation. However,
phase separation is a highly (formally inﬁnitely) cooperative
process, and the inﬂection point is therefore the better choice
as the coexistence point. One should also be aware of the
greater error in deﬁning the cloud point when shallow transi-
tions are followed by signal saturation (i.e., the transition
occurs over a wider temperature range and can result in errors
of several C). If the transition is sharp, the error in tempera-
ture will usually be within 1 C, even if the midpoint of the
transition is obscured by signal saturation. The presence of
thermal hysteresis may introduce error in the deﬁned cloud
point temperature and should be taken into account when mul-
tiple cycles of cooling and heating are performed [28].

Fig. 4 Determination of cloud points from example light scattering data. The temperature at which the
scattering intensity shows the largest slope is taken as cloud point. (a) The largest slope is linear across four
data points and the midpoint of this linear region is used as the cloud point. The light scattering detector
voltage saturates below 57 C, and the post-transition baseline cannot be seen. Due to the relatively steep
transition region, the error in determining the cloud point is not expected to be large. The two dashed lines are
only 0.6 C different from the observable transition. (b) Example raw scattering data showing a continuous
decrease in scattering intensity in the post-transition region. This can occur if droplets sink to the bottom of
the cuvette out of the light path over time. An example of how the cloud point temperature is extracted in this
case is shown. The points over which the intensity begins to decrease due to the settling of droplets are not
used in the analysis. In this case, the largest slope is seen between the last two usable points and the cloud
point is taken as midway between these points

Expression and Puriﬁcation of Intrinsically Disordered Aβ
Peptide and Setup of Reproducible Aggregation Kinetics
Experiment
Sara Linse
Abstract
High purity and sequence homogeneity of intrinsically disordered proteins are prerequisites for reproduc-
ible studies of the kinetics and equilibrium of their self-assembly reactions. Starting from the pure state
enables quantitative studies of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the process to understand its molecular
determinants. Here we outline detailed protocols for recombinant expression and puriﬁcation of ultra-pure
amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in sequence homogeneous form, which allows for the setup of reproducible kinetic
self-assembly experiments.

Introduction
The self-assembly of the intrinsically disordered amyloid β peptide
(Aβ) into ﬁbrillary and oligomeric aggregates is an extensively
studied process due to its connection with Alzheimer’s disease
[1–3]. The preferred route toward obtaining Aβ peptide material
for quantitative studies is recombinant expression relying on the
very high coupling ﬁdelity of the ribosome (see Note 1). The
methods we outline here can be used to obtain ultra-pure
(99.99%) peptide in monomeric state. This chapter outlines the
protocols for expression and puriﬁcation of Aβ peptide as is, i.e.,
with no tags except the starting methionine residue, which are an
optimization of the protocols from 2009 [4]. Aβ peptides are
intrinsically disordered as they are released by proteolysis from the
amyloid precursor protein by the action of secretase enzymes and
exist as several length variants. The peptides produced in this work
are referred to as Aβ(M1–42) and Aβ(M1–40). We also outline
procedures that can be used to purify these peptides and to set up

reproducible aggregation experiments, which we and others have
used in the past to approach the equilibrium [5] and kinetics [6] of
the Aβ self-assembly reaction. Starting from the pure state enables
quantitative information to be derived on the role of intrinsic and
extrinsic factors in the self-assembly process to understand its
molecular determinants [7]. Previous examples of intrinsic factors
studied are point mutations [7, 8] and sequence length variations
[9–12]. Previous examples of extrinsic factors are pH [7], tempera-
ture [13], salts of metal ions [14–16], inhibitors, and other high
and low Mw substances [17–26]. This chapter focuses on the
experimental procedures for the production of ultra-pure Aβ pep-
tide and acquisition of reproducible data, whereas the kinetic anal-
ysis, i.e., ﬁtting of kinetic models to the data, has been outlined in
detail in other texts [27–29].

1. Autoclave LB medium (see Subheading 2.1): 6  50 mL in six
250 mL bafﬂed ﬂasks. LB at enough volume for the expression
cultures, 500 mL per 2500 mL bafﬂed ﬂask (see Note 21).
2. Pick six well-isolated small colonies (Fig. 1) from an LB agar
plate (see Subheading 2.1). Use autoclaved pipette tip, tooth-
pick, or similar. The tip touching each colony is dipped into a
separate 250 mL bafﬂed ﬂask containing 50 mL LB with
appropriate antibiotics (see Note 22).
3. Shake the ﬂasks at 125 rpm (see Note 14), 37 C overnight
(ON).
4. Also overnight, pre-warm under quiescent condition the
(un-touched) LB medium for the day cultures to 37 C.
5. Next morning, add appropriate antibiotics (see Notes 3 and 7)
from stocks. Start shaking at 125 rpm (see Note 14), 37 C (see
Note 23).
6. Using individual autoclaved pipette tips, add 4 mL ON culture
to each 500 mL day culture. This is done under continuous
shaking of both ON and day culture ﬂasks at 125 rpm (see Note
14), 37 C (see Note 23).
7. Repeat steps 8–10 of Subheading 3.4.
8. Harvest the cells 3.5–4 h after IPTG addition by centrifugation
for 10 min at 6000  g.
9. Discard supernatant. Move the cell pellets to 50 mL Falcon
tubes (see Note 30). Rinse centrifuge tubes with water, pour
into the Falcon tube, and quickly shake up the pellet (5–10 s).
Immediately freeze. Store the cells at 20 or 80 C until
puriﬁcation.

The same protocol as above can be performed using urea to dissolve

Aggregation-Prone Aβ
Variants (A2V, E22G,
etc.)
For more aggregation-prone, more hydrophobic, and more surface
active (i.e., with a tendency to accumulate at interfaces) variants of
Aβ, the above protocol (Subheading 3.7) may need to be modiﬁed
at the following steps.
1. Wash

2. Perform stepwise elution using 4–12 aliquots of 50 mL U1Na.
Save small samples of each fraction for electrophoresis.
3.9
Modiﬁed
Protocol for Aβ
Variants
with a Different Net
Charge (D7N, E22G,
E22K, etc.)
For Aβ variants with a different net charge, the above protocol
(Subheading 3.6) may need to be modiﬁed at the following steps.
1. If the net charge is closer to zero, it may be necessary to
perform all wash steps without added NaCl to limit losses. If
the net charge is more negative, it may be possible to perform
all wash steps using slightly higher NaCl concentration to
improve purity.
2. If the net charge is closer to zero, it may be possible to elute the
peptide with less than 50 mM NaCl to improve purity. If the
net charge is more negative, more than 50 mM NaCl may be
required to elute the peptide.
3.10
Preparation
of Samples for Kinetics
Experiments
1. An aliquot of puriﬁed and lyophilized Aβ(M1–42) monomer is
dissolved in 1 mL Gu6 (Aβ(M1–42)), whereas for Aβ(M1–40),
the same buffer but with pH ¼ 8.0 can be used.
2. Monomer is isolated by gel ﬁltration on a Superdex 75 column
in PE8 (Aβ(M1–42)) or PE7 (Aβ(M1–40)), or relevant
experimental buffer for the intended study depending on
which question is addressed (see Notes 47 and 48). The center
of the monomer peak is collected in low-binding tubes on
ice, see Fig. 5. The peptide concentration is determined
from the absorbance of the integrated peak area using
ε280 ¼ 1440 l mol1 cm1 or using quantitative amino acid
analysis after acid hydrolysis.

as a monomer and as a higher MW band on SDS PAGE

3. If necessary, dilute the monomer with buffer to the highest
peptide concentration (typically in the range 5–20 μM for Aβ
(M1–42) or 50–200 μM for Aβ(M1–40)) appropriate for the
particular combination of intrinsic (sequence) and extrinsic
(solution composition) variables to be studied.
4. Add ThT from a concentrated stock (see Notes 49 and 50).
The ﬁnal concentration has to be in a range that provides a
linear response of the ﬂuorescence intensity versus ﬁbril mass
concentration (see Note 49). Supplement buffer with the same
ThT concentration as in the monomer solution.
5. Dilute monomer (+ThT) with buffer (+ThT) to prepare a series
of samples for the kinetic experiments with logarithmic spacing
of peptide concentrations (e.g., with each concentration 20%
lower than the one above) (see Note 51).
6. Pipette each sample into three-six wells (the number of
wells depending on availability of solution and the number of
concentrations)

polystyrene with a clear bottom and PEG coating100 μL per

Kinetic
Experiment by ThT
Fluorescence
1. Immediately after pipetting, place the 96-well plate in a plate
reader, preheated to the temperature of the study (e.g., 37 C,
or as desired depending on research question).
2. Record the ThT ﬂuorescence through the bottom of the plate
every 60 s (or as appropriate for the study) with excitation at
440 nm and emission at 480 nm (using ﬁlters or monochro-
mators, see Notes 52 and 53).
3. Various kinetic models are ﬁtted to the ﬂuorescence with an
aim to ﬁnd the minimal model that can globally ﬁt all data. To
do this, we refer to Amyloﬁt interface [28, 29]. Examples of
good and less good data with ﬁts are shown in Fig. 6.
3.12
Kinetics
Experiments
with Pre-formed Seeds
1. Prepare monomer solution in experimental buffer (NE8 or as
decided for the particular study) as in steps 1–4 of Subheading
3.10. A suitable concentration for making seeds is in the range
3–10 μM monomer.
2. Pipette into 2–4 wells of a 96-well PEGylated plate and moni-
tor ThT ﬂuorescence to follow the aggregation in the plate
reader.
3. Collect the seed ﬁbrils by pipetting the entire solutions in the
wells directly after reaching the ﬁnal plateau in ThT ﬂuores-
cence into low-binding tubes.
4. Dilute the seeds with experimental buffer to two times the
desired ﬁnal seed concentrations (the ﬁnal seed concentration
could be anywhere from 0.001% to 100% in monomer equiva-
lents depending on the purpose of the study).

data points of a model that included primary nucleation of monomers, elongation of ﬁbrils by monomer
addition, and secondary nucleation of monomers on the ﬁbril surface [6]

5. Pipette 50 μL of each 2 seed solution into 3–6 wells of a
96-well PEGylated plate. Pipette 50 μL of experimental buffer
(see step 1) into 3–6 wells to provide none-seeded reference.
6. Prepare fresh monomer solution as in steps 1–4 of Subheading
3.10. Dilute with experimental buffer (see step 1) to two times
the desired ﬁnal monomer concentration and supplement with
optimal ThT concentration (see Notes 49 and 50).
7. Using a multi-channel pipette, add 50 μL of each 2 monomer
solution to all wells with buffer or 2 seed.
8. Immediately place the 96-well plate in a plate reader, preheated
to the temperature of the study (e.g., 37 C).
9. Record the ThT ﬂuorescence through the bottom of the plate
every 30 or 60 s (or as appropriate for the study) with excita-
tion at 440 nm and emission at 480 nm (using ﬁlters or
monochromators). Examples of good data are shown in Fig. 7.

Notes
Most of the notes below are self-evident; however, we include notes
for all aspects where we have seen investigators fail in the past.
1. Early investigations employed synthetic peptide, but due to the
length (40 or 42 residues), a signiﬁcant fraction of the material
may consist of erroneous sequences that deteriorate the aggre-
gation kinetics and equilibrium in unwanted and unpredictable
ways with large batch-to-batch variation. For example, even at
99% coupling ﬁdelity at each step (0.9942 ¼ 0.65), mis-coupled
and thereby erroneous sequences will make up 35% of the
peptide sample. In addition, there may be a low frequency of
racemates at several positions. These multiple variants are simi-
lar to Aβ1–42 and very difﬁcult to remove by chromatographic
methods. Due to the spread over a vast number of sequences
(there may be 41 different Aβ41, and 1640 different Aβ40) and
racemates, there may not be any distinct impurity peaks in mass
spectra. Recombinant expression and puriﬁcation of Aβ peptide
avoids these problems as the level of mis-coupling at the ribo-
some is much lower than during chemical synthesis, and the
obtained product is enantiopure.
2. If the strain is BL21(DE3)pLysS Star, use 30 mg/L ﬁnal
concentration of chloramphenicol in plates and liquid cultures
for making competent cells. If the strain is T7 express (C2566,
ER2566), there should be no antibiotics in plates and liquid
cultures for making competent cells. Other strains may need
other antibiotics. Add antibiotics to the LB/agar solution after
cooling to 55 C.
3. Ampicillin is prepared as a 1000 stock at 50 mg/mL in
autoclaved water or LB, and chloramphenicol is prepared as a
1000 stock at 30 mg/mL in 95% ethanol. Add to the LB or
LB/agar solution after cooling to 55 C, as they are more
stable as powders than in solution.
4. This is best performed in a sterile hood or similar.
5. This is sufﬁcient for several cultures if kept sterile or
re-autoclaved before each use.
Aβ Puriﬁcation and Aggregation Kinetics
747

6. Some ON express medium recipes use ZY (tryptone, yeast),
but for Aβ peptides, expression is higher when using medium
LB (tryptone, yeast, NaCl).
7. For PetSac or Pet3a with Aβ(M1–42) gene and BL21(DE3)
pLysS Star cells, use 50 mg/L ampicillin and 30 mg/L chlor-
amphenicol in LB plates and all liquid cultures. For PetSac or
Pet3a with Aβ(M1–40) gene and T7 Express cells (also called
ER2566 or C2566), use 50 mg/L ampicillin in LB plates and
all liquid cultures. Other strains and plasmids may need other
antibiotics.
8. We use the Lund tap water, which is rich in minerals. If you live
in a country where chemicals are added to the tap water to limit
bacterial growth, you need to use deionized water and com-
pensate by adding the missing minerals.
9. This is the main carbon source and can be used with isotope
enrichment if the goal is to produce isotope-labeled Aβ pep-
tide. Since 13C-labelled glucose is expensive, it is common to
decrease to 200 g/L in the stock, or 2 g/L ﬁnal concentration.
It is also possible to use 13C glycerol as a carbon source.
Depending on which (if not all) positions are 13C-labeled in
glucose or glycerol, the label will end up in different deﬁned
positions in the amino acids in the produced protein.
10. This is the main nitrogen source and can be used with isotope
enrichment (15N) if the goal is to produce isotope-labeled Aβ
peptide.
11. Water may evaporate during autoclaving, so it is advised to
always autoclave pure water to be able to reconstitute back to
ca. 1000 mL total after mixing all ingredients.
12. DEAE cellulose is chosen because it has low capacity, to limit
risk of aggregation on the resin, and because it can be used with
fast ﬂow. It may be purchased dry and need to be conditioned
before use. Follow the instructions by the manufacturer.
13. GuHCl is acidic and the pH needs to be adjusted with NaOH
after dissolving in phosphate buffer. Higher pH serves to
increase solubility of Aβ. How much higher pH compared to
the running buffer can be tolerated without compromising the
pH of the eluted monomer depends on the buffer strength.
14. We use 125 rpm (r1) on our orbital shaker incubators with an
orbit diameter of 2.5 cm (d1). If your shaker has another orbit
diameter of d2, your shaking speed (r2) needs to be adjusted to
give the same oxygen transfer rate according to r2 ¼ r1 √(d1/
d2).
15. You want to have the tubes for freezing the cells pre-cooled to
near 80 C. You also need to ensure that the tubes are sterile
until adding the cells. A procedure that meets both these
748
Sara Linse

requirements is the use of solid Eppendorf-tube blocks that are
placed in the 80 C freezer overnight. Shortly before needing
the tubes, place the frozen blocks in the sterile hood and ﬁll
with the sterile tubes with lids open so that cells can be added
quickly when they are ready. The box for closed and ready
tubes should be kept in dry ice. After closing the tube lids,
move them to the box in the dry ice and then transfer the box
to the 80 C freezer.
16. Time and temperature are important factors affecting the qual-
ity of the competent cells; continue with the next step immedi-
ately after spin is ﬁnished to limit cell lysis. Keep the timing at
all steps.
17. Time and temperature are important factors. Keep the tubes in
wet ice during the entire step.
18. For Aβ(M1–42), we use E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS Star.
For Aβ(M1–40), we use E. coli strain T7 Express (also called
C2566 or ER2566). These strains give very high and repro-
ducible expression levels for Aβ(M1–42) and Aβ(M1–40),
respectively. Additional strains may work as well; we have, for
example, tested BL21 Gold with excellent results for Aβ
(M1–40).
19. Autoclaved glass beads are excellent for efﬁcient spreading of
the cells over the plate.
20. Aβ(M1–42) wild-type expresses ca. threefold higher in auto-
induction medium compared to LB medium with IPTG induc-
tion and expresses equally well in M9 minimal medium as in LB
medium; however, the amount of E. coli contaminants is lowest
in minimal medium. For mutants or sequence length variants,
the optimal growth medium needs to be found. For some
mutants, a pH variation may lead to higher yield. Aβ(M1–40)
wild-type expresses to ca. tenfold higher yields in auto-
induction medium compared to LB medium with IPTG induc-
tion, which in turn gives ca. tenfold higher yield than M9
minimal medium with IPTG induction. We therefore do not
recommend M9 medium for the expression of Aβ(M1–40)
wild-type. For each mutant or sequence length variant, the
optimal medium needs to be found. For some mutants, a pH
variation may lead to higher yield.
21. More than 500 mL medium per 2.5 L ﬂask will deteriorate
aeration and decrease the yield of expressed peptide signiﬁ-
cantly. Optimal aeration is achieved in our setup with orbital
shaking between 120 and 130 rpm (Fig. 2). More medium per
ﬂask
will
deteriorate
aeration
and
decrease
the
yield
signiﬁcantly.
22. It is important to pick the smallest well-isolated colonies. These
are the ones most likely to be highly expressing. Use several
Aβ Puriﬁcation and Aggregation Kinetics
749

colonies in individual overnight cultures; this limits the losses
in case one outlier low-level expresser would accidentally be
included. Do not add bacteria from more than one colony in
each ﬂask; a low-level expressing clone will tend to grow faster
and take over the culture at the expense of the more highly
expressing clones that grow more slowly.
23. It is important to always keep the cultures shaking to increase
oxygen supply. Always pipette from a continuously shaking day
culture to a continuously shaking ﬂask with overnight culture
medium. Some shaker incubators may need to be adapted to
allow for this. For example, if the shaker is constructed to stop
when you open it, you need to cut a hole in the lid and use a
Plexi-glass sheet to cover the hole to allow for opening without
stopping the shaking.
24. It is important to transfer from as many day cultures as possible
to different overnight cultures. Thereby you minimize the
damage caused if you by accident picked one poorly expressing
colony at step 3 of Subheading 3.3. It is important to transfer
from only one-day culture to each overnight culture. Thereby
you maximize the chance of getting high expression. Mixing
material from several colonies must be absolutely avoided; this
would hamper expression since low-expressing cells grow faster
than highly expressing ones and take over the culture if allowed
to co-exist.
25. Expression is induced after the bacteria have consumed most of
the glucose and start consuming lactose. No IPTG is needed in
this type of cultures.
26. For SDS PAGE with Aβ peptides, we use 10–20% polyacryl-
amide gels (and Tris/Tricine running buffer (100 mM Tris,
100 mM Tricine, 0.1% SDS). It is also possible to analyze Aβ
peptides using agarose gel electrophoresis (1% gel in, for exam-
ple, 50 mM HEPES buffer with 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.5 [30]).
27. It is more important to proceed to harvest. Electrophoresis can
be run after the cell pellets have entered the freezer.
28. Do not centrifuge for too long (use maximum the suggested
time). Decant the medium and collect the cells immediately
after the rotor has stopped. These cells break easily.
29. Oxygen supply is one of the main factors affecting the yield.
Always keep each ﬂask shaking as long as possible; always keep
on shaking while ﬁlling other centrifuge tubes or while centri-
fuging if not all culture can ﬁt in one centrifuge.
30. It is advised to store pellet in the same batch size as your
puriﬁcation capacity. That is, if you have grown 12 L culture,
but can only process cell pellet from 4 L at a time, store pellet as
three identical aliquots.

31. Some protocols include a middle culture, but we have found
equally good yield with this simpliﬁed protocol.
32. Additional samples may be taken at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 h (or more)
after IPTG addition to monitor the development of Aβ
(M1–42) expression. In our setup, the optimal harvest time is
found between 5 and 6 h after IPTG addition.
33. Some Aβ peptides may express best in LB; therefore, we also
include this protocol. For each mutant or sequence length
variant, the optimal medium needs to be found. For some
mutants, a pH variation of the medium may lead to higher
yield.
34. This is the classical [4] recipe for pellet from 4.5 L culture with
some modiﬁcations. Depending on the capacity of available
equipment, the protocol can be scaled to any volume as long
as the total time for steps 1–17 is maximum 3 h (the shorter
the better).
35. Time and temperature are the most important factors that
affect the yield and purity. Keep all solutions on ice and proceed
through steps 1–17 with no interruptions.
36. Different growth media give different amounts of cells. This
amount of buffer may work well for cells from 1 to 2 L ON
express medium or cells from 4–8 L M9 medium.
37. The total time to disrupt cells may vary between equipment
and batches. In general, BL21(DE3)pLysS Star are very easy to
break. Other strains may require longer sonication. Over-
sonication will dissolve the inclusion bodies, leading to loss of
Aβ. A small amount of DNAse can be added during this ﬁrst
sonication step to reduce viscosity.
38. The solution pH affects the stability of the inclusion bodies. We
recommend using pH 7.5 during sonication when the goal is
to isolate the inclusion bodies and using higher pH later when
the goal is to dissolve the inclusion bodies and purify the
monomer.
39. The goal here is to quickly re-disperse and wash the inclusion
bodies. Over-sonication will dissolve the inclusion bodies,
leading to loss of Aβ.
40. Ion exchange is performed on a funnel rather than in a column
to avoid concentrating the peptide during gradient elution on a
column. However, since we use isocratic elution, it is also
possible to pack the resin in a column after the ﬁrst portion
of buffer with 50 mM NaCl has been added and slowly pump
through ice-cold buffer with 50 mM NaCl and collect the
eluates in containers standing in the ice box. These can be
collected, small sample for electrophoresis removed, and lyo-
philized one by one while waiting for more fractions to elute.

41. Shell freezing in glass bulbs is done with the sample comprising
maximum 20% of ﬂask volume, e.g., 200 mL in a 1 L glass
bulb, by rotating the ﬂask in acetone with dry ice (do this in a
fume hood) as cooling bath.
42. Using a larger column, e.g., 3.4  200 cm or 5  60 cm, it is
possible to load larger amounts of the GuHCl-dissolved lyo-
philized ion exchange fractions.
43. Ammonium acetate is used here because it is a volatile buffer,
meaning it facilitates dissolution of the peptide in a smaller
volume at the next step. It is also possible to use sodium
phosphate buffer or other buffer of choice.
44. It is possible to keep the eluates from the second SEC in an ice
box for a few hours, to allow the material from several second
SEC runs to be combined to obtain a larger number of identi-
cal aliquots. The aliquot size depends on the intended use. If
the next step will be monomer isolation for aggregation kinet-
ics, it may be convenient to have aliquots of 40 nmol lyophi-
lized in low-binding Ep-tubes or Falcon tubes.
45. The peptide is considered pure when no other protein bands
are seen on a silver-stained SDS PAGE gel, the correct and
unique peptide mass is seen by mass spectrometry, and no
contaminating substances are seen by 1H NMR. For mechanis-
tic studies, all these conditions should be met after the ﬁnal
round of monomer isolation for the kinetic experiment.
46. Use very high-quality urea (we used AnalaR Normapur® ACS
from VWR) and dissolve just prior to use to avoid carbamoyla-
tion of Aβ lysine side-chains.
47. This ﬁnal gel ﬁltration step removes traces of pre-existent
aggregates and exchanges the buffer to the one used in the
ﬁbril formation experiments. However, the pH and ionic
strength of the running buffer affects the yield. For experi-
ments at lower pH or higher salt, it is advisable to adjust those
parameters after the monomer has been collected.
48. The losses on each chromatographic step is ca 50%; however,
reducing the number of steps to increase the yield will com-
promise quality and distort the obtained kinetics.
49. If the intension is to use ThT ﬂuorescence for the kinetic
experiment, add ThT from a concentrated stock (made in
water, ﬁltrated through 0.2 μm ﬁlter, concentration deter-
mined by absorbance of diluted sample). The ThT concentra-
tion needs to be optimized for each particular case to a range
where its signal is proportional to the aggregate mass concen-
tration. This can be done by conducting aggregation experi-
ments at multiple Aβ and ThT concentrations and plotting the
ﬁnal plateau value of ThT ﬂuorescence versus total Aβ concen-
tration for each ThT concentration.

50. It is of course possible to use exactly the same protocol without
any dye for other detection modes (light scattering, intrinsic
ﬂuorescence, etc.) or with alternative dyes such as 8-Anilino-
naphthalene-1-sulfonic
acid
(ANS),
1,4-bis(3-carboxy-4-
hydroxyphenylethenyl)-benzene (X-34), oligothiophenes, etc.
The concentration of each dye needs to be optimized to ﬁnd
the range of dye concentrations that give linear response of
ﬂuorescence intensity versus ﬁbril mass concentration in the
intended study range. Lower concentration means insufﬁcient
ThT concentration to give reliable shape of the curves at the
end of the reaction, and higher concentrations will suffer from
quenching of the ﬂuorescence due to micelle formation of
excess free ThT.
51. Logarithmic spacing of peptide concentrations (e.g., with each
concentration 20% lower than the one above) provides the
most stringent distinction between models because chemical
reactions are governed by activities (proportional to the loga-
rithm of the concentration). Typically, 8–24 different concen-
trations are prepared. If hand pipetting is used, this gives best
accuracy if a single pipette is used, and it is recommended to
practice pipetting with water at a balance until the maximum
error is 1% or less. We achieve better accuracy using a tailor-
made dilution robot that can prepare dilution series in 96-well
plates with nL precision [30].
52. Quiescent conditions are recommended for mechanistic study,
but shaking may be used as one means to apply a perturbation
with predictable changes to the mechanism.
53. The whole setup needs to be repeated at least twice for each
combination of intrinsic (sequence) and extrinsic (solution
composition) variables.

Measuring Interactions Between Tau and Aggregation
Inducers with Single-Molecule Fo¨rster Resonance Energy
Transfer
Sanjula P. Wickramasinghe and Elizabeth Rhoades
Abstract
Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and other
neurodegenerative disorders. Here we describe the application of single-molecule Fo¨rster resonance energy
transfer (smFRET) for the characterization of the interactions between tau and polyphosphate, an intracel-
lular polymer that accelerates tau aggregation. We describe the design of tau constructs, puriﬁcation and
ﬂuorescent labeling of tau, and details of acquisition and analysis of smFRET data. The protocols provided
here outline an approach that may be applied to the study of other intrinsically disordered proteins and their
binding partners.

Introduction
It is estimated that >40% of the mammalian proteome can be
classiﬁed as being entirely intrinsically disordered or containing
disordered domains [1]. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)
are generally enriched in charged and polar residues, with relatively
low fractions of hydrophobic residues, and do not form stable
secondary or tertiary structures in isolation [2]. Despite their lack
of stable structure, IDPs are involved in a variety of cellular func-
tions, including signaling pathways [3] and membraneless orga-
nelles [4], as well as being implicated in a number of diseases
[5]. Single-molecule Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET)
is a powerful approach for characterizing heterogenous conforma-
tional states of IDPs. FRET is the non-radiative transfer of energy
via a dipole-dipole mechanism from a donor ﬂuorophore to an
acceptor ﬂuorophore [6]. The efﬁciency of transfer, ETeff, is
strongly dependent on the distance between the ﬂuorophores

[7]. When both ﬂuorophores are placed on the same protein, it
serves as a useful probe of conformational changes as a function of
measurement conditions. Intramolecular smFRET has been used
to gain insight into unfolded states of globular proteins [8], the role
of disorder in allosteric regulation [9], conformational states of
disordered proteins involved in phase separation [10], and high
afﬁnity interactions of disordered proteins in complexes [11].
Tau is an intrinsically disordered microtubule-associated pro-
tein that is implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases
collectively known as tauopathies [12]. While ﬁbrillar aggregates of
tau are the hallmark of these diseases, the molecular mechanisms
relevant to the initiation of tau aggregation are not well under-
stood. Tau does not aggregate readily in vitro, and as such, aggre-
gation is often studied in the presence of anionic molecules such as
heparin, arachidonic acid, or polyphosphate [13–16]. The low
protein concentrations (~pM) used in diffusion-based smFRET
measurements
disfavor
aggregation,
making
intramolecular
smFRET particularly useful for characterizing domain-speciﬁc con-
formational changes relevant to tau aggregation in the monomer
protein.

3.3
Design of Tau
Constructs for smFRET
Measurements
Tau has four main functional domains (Fig. 3): the N-terminal
domain (NTD: with inserts N1 and N2), the proline rich region
(PRR), the microtubule binding region (MTBR: with three or four
conserved repeat sequences, R1, R2, R3 and R4), and the
C-terminal domain (CTD). Tau is found as six naturally occurring
isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of the two N-terminal
inserts (0 N, 1 N and 2 N) and the second repeat, R2, of the MTBR
(3R vs. 4R).
Because IDPs like tau often exhibit domain-speciﬁc, non-coop-
erative behavior, a single set of labeling sites may not be sufﬁcient to
capture all relevant conformational changes [13, 17, 22]. To
address this challenge, our strategy is to label the protein at multiple
sets of independent and overlapping sites. This allows us to probe
tau domains within the context of the full-length protein. To
illustrate, in the full-length protein we place labels at positions
spanning the MTBR as well as spanning the PRR-MTBR (Fig. 3)
to determine the relationship between the two domains. We may
also probe the properties of these domains in isolation in order to
understand the impact of ﬂanking regions on their properties, e.g.,
a fragment consisting only of the MTBR or of the PRR-MTBR
(Fig. 3) [18].
3.3.1
Introduction
of Cysteines for Labeling
1. Unless they are to be used for labeling, native cysteines at
residues 291 and 322 in the tau isoforms containing all four
repeats are mutated to serine using site-directed mutagenesis.
2. Pairs of cysteines residues are introduced by site-directed muta-
genesis to span the different domains of interest (see Notes 5
and 6). To illustrate, we mutated residues Q244 and E372
(Fig. 3) to cysteines to incorporate ﬂuorophores, which allow
for probing the MTBR.

3.3.2
Creation of Tau
Isoforms and Fragments
1. To investigate the behavior of the isolated domains, fragments
are cloned from the full-length tau plasmid.
2. For both isoforms and fragments, the construct plasmids are
made by deleting the necessary nucleotides from the full-length
plasmid.
3.4
Tau Expression
and Puriﬁcation
1. Transform tau into BL21 cells. Add ~50–100 ng of plasmid to
50 μL of cells and incubate on ice for 30 min. Heat shock the
cells at 42 C for 45 s and incubate on ice for 2 min. Add
450 μL of LB media and incubate at 37 C for 1 h. Pipette
~100 μL onto a LB/agar/ampicillin plates and spread evenly
with sterile spreader. Incubate plates overnight at 37 C.
2. Select a single colony for inoculation of a 5 mL starter culture
(LB supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin ﬁnal concentra-
tion added just prior to growth). Incubate the starter culture
overnight and then add it to a larger volume of LB supplemen-
ted with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. The volume of the LB cultures
for protein expression varies; typically, 1 L is used for full-
length constructs, while 0.5 L is used for fragments.
3. Incubate the large volume LB culture for ~4 h at 37 C with
shaking to reach OD ¼ 0.4–0.6 at 600 nm. Add IPTG to a ﬁnal
concentration of 1 mM to induce protein expression. Let the
culture continue to grow with shaking either 4 h at 37 C or
overnight at 16 C (see Note 7).
4. Pellet the cells and resuspend the pellet in 30 mL Lysis Buffer
per 1 L of LB. Lysed cells can be stored at 80 C until needed.
5. Thaw the sample and sonicate on ice for 100 s with a 1 s pulse
followed by 2 s of rest at a maximum power of ~35 W.
6. Centrifuge the cells at 20,000  g for 30 min at 4 C. Discard
the pellet.
7. Filter the supernatant with a 0.22 μm ﬁlter to remove any
residual cell debris. For full-length tau, all of the following
steps should be carried out at 4 C unless otherwise stated to
minimize degradation of the protein (see Note 8).
8. Remove excess buffer from the nickel afﬁnity column resin, and
mix with ﬁltered supernatant in a 50 mL conical tube. Incubate
for 45–60 min with gentle mixing.
9. Pour the resin into a 10 mL volume column, and allow it to
settle and drain excess solution; wash the column with 5 mL
additional Buffer A.
10. Step-elute the protein in ~15 mL Buffer B, collecting all
15 mL.
11. Concentrate the 15 mL sample to ~2 mL and buffer exchange
into Buffer A (~30 mL buffer total) using an Amicon
SmFRET of Tau-Polyphosphate
761

centrifugal ﬁlter unit with the appropriate cut off (10 kDa for
full-length and 3 kDa for fragments) to reduce the imidazole
concentration (see Note 9).
12. To cleave the His-tag, add DTT to a ﬁnal concentration of
1 mM, followed by ~1 mg/mL TEV protease. Incubate over-
night at 4 C or for 3–4 h at room temperature with gentle
shaking.
13. Remove DTT by buffer exchange with a total volume ~30 mL
into Buffer A using an Amicon ﬁlter unit.
14. As in step 8, incubate with the nickel afﬁnity column material
equilibrated in Buffer A for 45–60 min with gentle shaking.
15. Pour the resin into the column and collect the column ﬂow-
through, which will contain the cleaved tau; uncleaved tau,
cleaved His-tag, and TEV protease will all be retained on the
column beads. Rinse the conical tube with an additional ~5 mL
buffer. Add this to the column bed and collect with original
ﬂow-through.
16. Concentrate the protein sample to ~1 mL and buffer exchange
into Buffer C with a total volume of ~30 mL using an Amicon
ﬁlter unit (see Note 10).
17. Remove all remaining contaminants by passing the protein
over a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 size exclusion column.
18. Detect and analyze the purity of the protein through
SDS-PAGE of the fractions collected from the size exclusion
column (see Note 11).
19. Concentrate the protein to ~2 mL, and buffer exchange the
pure protein into FRET buffer with a total volume of ~30 mL.
Either label the protein immediately (Subheading 3.5) or ali-
quot it and ﬂash freeze in liquid nitrogen for storage at 80 C
(see Note 12).
20. Determine the yield of the protein by absorbance at 280 nm
(see Notes 13 and 14).
3.5
Labeling Tau
for smFRET
Measurements
1. Starting with the protein from step 19 of Subheading 3.4, add
DTT to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM at room temperature
and incubate for ~30 min.
2. Add ~10 mL Labeling Buffer and then concentrate the sample
in an Amicon ﬁlter unit to a ﬁnal volume of ~500 μL. The tau
concentration should be around 100 μM (see Note 15).
3. Transfer the protein to a small, clean glass vial (2 mL vial with a
ﬂat bottom); and add the donor dye, Alexa Fluor 488 malei-
mide, at a 2:1 protein:dye ratio. Cover with aluminum foil to
protect the sample from light, and incubate for 1 h at room
temperature with stirring.

4. Add the acceptor dye, Alexa Fluor 594 maleimide, to 5 molar
excess of the protein, cover with foil, and move to 4 C. Con-
tinue incubation with stirring overnight.
5. Remove the GdnHCl and some of the unreacted dye by buffer
exchange with ~15 mL FRET Buffer using an Amicon ﬁlter
unit. Concentrate the sample to 500 μL.
6. Remove any remaining unreacted dye by passing the solution
over two coupled HiTrap Desalting Columns equilibrated with
FRET buffer. Coupling the desating columns results in better
separation of the labeled protein from unreacted dye. Labeled
tau elutes between 2.5 and 3 mL.
7. Flash freeze ~30 μL aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at
80 C. (see Notes 16 through 20).
3.6
Preparation
of Coverslips
1. Measurements are made in Nunc Lab-Tek eight-well cham-
bered borosilicate coverslips.
2. Dilute the PEG-PLL in Millipore water. We generally use a
1:40 dilution of the preparation described in Subheading 3.1.
3. Treat the coverslips for 1 min in a plasma cleaner on high.
4. Immediately add 300 μL of the diluted PEG-PLL into each
well, and let incubate overnight at room temperature.
5. The following morning, rinse the coverslips 8–10 times with
Millipore water.
6. Fill the chambers with water and incubate for ~3 h to over-
night. Chambers should be stored ﬁlled with water until they
are needed for measurements. (see Notes 21 and 22).
7. Replace the water in one well with 200–250 μL of the appro-
priate sample for measurements, leaving remaining wells ﬁlled
with water until needed for measurement.

Checking
Alignment by
Measuring Diffusion
Times of Fluorescent
Standards
Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can be used to mea-
sure the diffusion time of ﬂuorescently labeled molecules [19]. The
diffusion time is very sensitive to the instrument settings, including
alignment of the lasers, ﬁbers/pinholes, and ﬁlter. As such, mea-
suring the diffusion time of a well-characterized ﬂuorescent sample
on a daily basis is a robust means of ensuring that the instrument is
aligned and all components are functioning. We use Alexa
488 hydrazide and eGFP at 20 nM as reference ﬂuorophores for
this purpose (see Note 23). The 50 μm aperture optical ﬁbers are
used to couple the ﬂuorescence emission to the avalanche photo
diode detectors for FCS measurements (Fig. 1).
1. Adjust the laser power to 5 μW just prior to entering the
microscope.

2. Collect ten measurements of 10 s each of the reference ﬂuores-
cence standards. The autocorrelation curves are generated by
the digital correlator.
3. Average the ten autocorrelation curves and ﬁt the average
curve, G(τ), to Eq. 1 which describes diffusion in three-
dimensions of a single ﬂuorescent species:
G τð Þ ¼ 1

where N is the average number of molecules in the focal
volume, s is the ratio of radial to axial dimensions of the focused
laser, τ is the time axis, and τD is the translational diffusion time
of the ﬂuorescent molecule.
4. The ﬁt parameters N and τD and the counts-per-molecule (total
intensity signal of the sample divided by N) should fall within
the standard deviation of the over-time values of these
parameters.
3.8
Calibrate
Instrument
with smFRET
Standards
Following alignment, smFRET positive controls that span a range
of ETeff values are measured to ensure day-to-day reproducibility of
smFRET measurements. We use ﬂuorescently labeled double-
stranded DNA (Subheadings 2.1.2 and 3.2). The 100 μm aperture
optical ﬁbers are used to couple the ﬂuorescence emission to the
avalanche photo diode detectors for all smFRET measurements.
1. Adjust the laser power to 30 μW prior to entering the
microscope.
2. Dilute the smFRET standard to ~30 pM in 250 μL of FRET
buffer.
3. Collect a 10 min (1 ms bin size) intensity trace.
4. From this trace, calculate ETeff values, plot as a histogram, and
ﬁt as described below in Subheading 3.10. For any given day,
the peak ETeff value from ﬁtting the histogram should fall
within the standard deviation of the over-time peak ETeff
values.
3.9
SmFRET
Measurements of Tau
1. Collect a 1 min intensity trace (1 ms bin size) of the buffer. This
serves as a measure of the background intensity for the sample.
Under ideal circumstances, analysis of this trace as described
below (Subheading 3.10) should show that no FRET events
were recorded (Fig. 2).
2. Add ~25–50 pM labeled tau to the measurement well. This is
on the order of two 1000 dilutions of the thawed tau aliquots
from Subheading 3.5.
3. Mix by pipetting 3–4 times.
764
Sanjula P. Wickramasinghe and Elizabeth Rhoades

4. Collect a 1 min intensity trace (1 ms bins size). Analyze the
trace as described in Subheading 3.8. We typically expect
100–300 FRET events per minute. Even after only 1 min,
analysis should show two peaks in the ETeff histogram:
(a) one that has an average ETeff ¼ 0, corresponding to events
from protein with two donor ﬂuorophores or a donor ﬂuoro-
phore and an inactive acceptor ﬂuorophore; and (b) a second
peak that corresponds to tau with an active donor and active
acceptor.
5. If the analyzed data looks as described in step 4, collect a time
trace of 30–60 min (Fig. 2) (see Notes 24 and 25).
Fig. 2 Examples of photon traces of 1 min background (a) and protein (b) measurements with 1 ms time binds.
Data are shown with the donor photon counts (green) stacked on top of the acceptor photon counts (red) so
that the total photon counts per 1 ms time bin can be read from the plot. The dashed lines indicate the intensity
threshold for a burst, 30 photons in the sum of the donor and acceptor channels, to qualify as a FRET event.
The intensity traces are analyzed, and the ETeff values are plotted as histograms after 1 (c), 10 (d), and 60 (e)
minutes of data collection. The number of events in each histogram is indicated

3.10
Analysis
of smFRET Data
1. As described in Subheading 3.9, intensity traces are collected in
1 ms time bins. Apply a minimum photon-per-event threshold
to discriminate between signal and noise [20]. This can be
done empirically, by increasing the threshold value until no
events are detected in the background measurements (Sub-
heading 3.9, step 1). Alternatively, it can be done by compar-
ing the number of events obtained from photon traces of buffer
in the absence and presence of tau over a range of threshold
values, selecting a threshold value that gives the highest ratio of
protein:buffer events [20]. For our measurements, we sum the
photons in the donor and acceptor channels before applying a
threshold. For the measurement conditions described here, we
typically use a threshold between 30 and 50 photons/bin; all
bins with fewer than the threshold number of photons are
removed from the data set for further analysis.
2. Using the ﬁltered data set, the ETeff for each time-bin is calcu-
lated as:
ETeff ¼
I a  Ba
ð
Þ  β I d  Bd
ð
Þ
I a  Ba
ð
Þ  β I d  Bd
ð
Þ
ð
Þ þ γ
I d  Bd
ð
Þ þ β I d  Bd
ð
Þ
ð

ð2Þ
where Ia and Id are the intensities in the acceptor and donor
channels, respectively; Ba and Bd are the average background
intensities of the acceptor and donor channels, respectively,
measured in Subheading 3.9, step 1; β is the bleed-through
of donor ﬂuorescence into the acceptor channel and γ corrects
for the difference in quantum yields of the ﬂuorophores and
quantum efﬁciencies of the detectors. (see Notes 26 and 27).
3. Plot the resultant ETeff values as a histogram. As described in
step 4 of Subheading 3.9, histograms will always consist of two
peaks, one corresponding to the ETeff ¼ 0 peak and the other
corresponding to tau labeled with both a donor and an accep-
tor. Fit the histograms with a sum of two Gaussian distributions
to determine the peak ETeff values and the widths using Eq. 3.

SmFRET
Measurements
with polyP or Other
Aggregation Inducers
1. Dilute polyP to 250 μM to 1 mM in Phosphate Buffer and add
the appropriate volume to a measurement well (see Note 28).
2. Measure a 1 min intensity trace of the polyP solution. Analyze
this trace as described above in Subheading 3.10 using a
threshold determined for buffer in the absence of polyP as a
766
Sanjula P. Wickramasinghe and Elizabeth Rhoades

starting point. Ideally, this analysis should not yield any events
that exceed the threshold (see Note 29).
3. Add labeled tau, pipette 3–4 times to mix and repeat steps 4–5
from Subheading 3.9.
4. Depending on the goal of the experiments, it may be desirable
to carry out measurements over a range of polyP concentra-
tions. Often, we make comparative measurements between tau
isoforms or for different labeling positions under “saturating”
conditions, meaning that adding more polyP does not cause
additional changes to the ETeff histograms (Fig. 4). The con-
centration of polyP that results in “saturation” may differ for
different chain lengths of polyP, for different tau isoforms or
fragments or even for labeling positions reporting on different
tau domains. These measurements may result in an additional
peak in the histogram plots. As described above, in addition to
the ETeff ¼ 0 and tau in buffer peaks, there will be a peak due to
tau with polyP bound (Fig. 3 and 4). If this is the case, an
additional Gaussian distribution should be included in the
ﬁtting protocol (see Note 30).
5. Similar measurements can be carried out with other aggrega-
tion inducers such as heparin [13], RNA or lipid vesicles or
with any binding partner.

Notes
1. Recombinant eGFP is also available commercially from various
suppliers.
2. We have used polyP provided by Prof. U. Jakob (University of
Michigan) through Dr. T Shiba (RegeneTiss, Japan). Comme-
rical sources are available (Kerafast).
3. The average chain lengths are determined through polyP gel
electrophoresis based on the negative staining method of Smith
and Morrissey [21]. The polyP concentration can be deter-
mined using a Toluidine blue assay against a phosphorous
standard curve.
4. We order ﬂuorescently labeled ssDNA from IDT. An example
sequence for our 10mer standard is as shown here:
30-CGG ATC TCG G-Alexa 488-50.
30-CCG AGA TCC G-Alexa 594-50.
The ﬂuorophore can be placed at either the 30 or the 50
end, so long as the complimentary strand has the label at the
same end.

5. Site-directed mutagenesis can be carried out by Overlap Exten-
sion PCR or whole plasmid, single-round PCR [23]. We use
QuikChange Site-Directed mutagenesis kits, which employ the
second method of mutagenesis.

MTBR (g). (Figure adapted with permission from [17])

6. A smFRET measurement of the protein alone should result in a
single (other than the ETeff ¼ 0 peak), shot-noise limited peak
in the ETeff histogram. Signiﬁcant broadening or deviation
from the expected peak position may mean that one or both
of the ﬂuorophores is interacting non-randomly with the pro-
tein. In this case, different labeling positions or ﬂuorophores
should be evaluated.
7. Tau fragments (i.e., the MTBR or PRR) are generally expressed
at 37 C for 4 h, while the full-length protein is expressed
overnight at 16 C. Full-length tau can be grown at 37 C
with a decrease in the ﬁnal yield due to increased protein
degradation.
8. Tau fragments express at a higher yield and are less prone to
degradation than the full-length constructs. If desired, puriﬁ-
cation of the fragments may be carried out at room tempera-
ture without a signiﬁcant loss of yield or purity.
9. To maximize the yield of the protein, rinse the membranes of
the Amicon concentrators, collecting the rinse buffer, follow-
ing use. This removes some of the protein that has adsorbed to
the membranes.
10. Tau can precipitate if the sample is concentrated too much at
this stage, so care should be taken to not concentrate the
sample to the point of precipitation. Typically, we aim for a
volume of ~1 mL, although this varies depending on the yield
of the puriﬁcation.
11. As is true for many IDPs, tau runs at a larger molecular weight
band on SDS-PAGE gels than its actual molecular weight. For
example, the MTBR construct, which is 176 residues long and
has a molecular weight ¼ 18.4 kDa, runs at ~25 kDa on a
4–12% acrylamide gel.
12. Repeated freeze-thawing tau may compromise its integrity and
is therefore not recommended. Aliquot the protein in conve-
nient volumes for a single set of planned experiments.

Fig. 4 (continued) shrinks, concurrent with the appearance of a higher ETeff
peak from tau with polyP bound. These plots illustrate the challenges of
accurately measuring low ETeff events arising from donor-acceptor labeled
protein from the artifactual ETeff ¼ 0 peak. The area under the peaks was
used to calculate an apparent KD  0.4 μM. The data for the histograms marked
with an asterisk were acquired in PIE-FRET (see Note 30) to eliminate the
ETeff ¼ 0 peak. The red lines are the Gaussian ﬁts for each peak (see
Subheading 3.10, step 3). (Figure adapted with permission from [17])
770
Sanjula P. Wickramasinghe and Elizabeth Rhoades

be calculated using ProtParam or any similar protein sequence
tools. For IDPs lacking any aromatic residues, we have found
that a Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay works well for quantiﬁcation.
14. Our yield at this stage is approximately 2–5 mg of tau per
0.5–1 L growth.
15. While a higher concentration of tau (~100 μM as recom-
mended above) generally results in a higher labeling efﬁciency,
concentrations as low as ~40 μM have been used successfully.
16. Labeling as described here does not allow for site-speciﬁc
conjugation of the donor and acceptor ﬂuorophores to the
cysteines. More precisely, labeled proteins will be a mix of
donor at site A, acceptor at site B; donor at site B, acceptor at
site A; donor at sites A and B; acceptor at sites A and B. If site-
speciﬁc conjugation of the ﬂuorophores is desired, then a
combination of a cysteine and an unnatural amino acid provide
orthogonal chemical reactivities that can achieve this [24].
17. Pairs of donor-acceptor dye are chosen to best cover the
expected distance between the two probes or to match the
requirements of the instrument, i.e., available laser excitation
wavelengths. Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 have a theoretical
Ro ¼ 60 A˚ ; however, the actual R0 is dependent upon the
quantum yield and emission of the donor ﬂuorophore. There-
fore, R0 may be sensitive to the labeling positions, solution
conditions, etc., and should be experimentally determined for
each labeled protein construct if accurate distance calculations
are desired [25].
18. Because tau adsorbs to the walls of the microcentrifuge tubes
used for storage, maintaining the protein at a high concentra-
tion during storage and until use minimizes loss. We generally
avoid diluting the protein below ~1–2 μM prior to addition to
the measurement chambers.
19. The labeled protein should be subjected to a functional assay to
ensure that the labels do not signiﬁcantly perturb its properties.
For tau, aggregation of the labeled protein measured by light
scattering [26], Thioﬂavin T ﬂuorescence [27] or anisotropy of
the acceptor ﬂuorophore [28] and compared to unlabeled
protein under the same conditions is a reasonable proxy for a
functional assay.
20. Mass spectrometry is a useful approach for ensuring that a
majority of the protein samples have two ﬂuorophores
conjugated.
21. Coverslips may be stored ﬁlled with water for approximately
one week. Some tau variants are more likely to adsorb to the
Nunc chamber surfaces than other.
SmFRET of Tau-Polyphosphate
771

22. Inhomogeneities in the PEG-PLL coating of the coverslips can
result in inconsistent measurements or ETeff histograms that
do not show evidence of distinct populations or loss of signal
due to protein adsorption or precipitation. There may be well-
to-well variability of the PEG-PLL coating and in some cases
simply making a fresh sample in a new well will resolve issues.
Alternatively, unlabeled tau can be used to passivate the sample
chambers before the addition of labeled tau and/or polyP.
However, this may complicate measurements where precise
protein concentrations are required.
23. Any bright ﬂuorophore that ﬁts a single-component diffusion
equation (Eq. 1) that can be excited by the donor ﬂuorophore
laser can be used as an alignment standard for FCS. A few
examples include other Alexa Fluor dyes and rhodamine 6 G.
24. The number of events of the measurement should be moni-
tored as a function of time. If there is signiﬁcant loss of events,
this usually reﬂects precipitation of the protein or adsorption to
the sample chamber. A slight decrease in the number of events
over time may be expected, especially for samples containing
binding partners. A loss of ~20% is not problematic, if analysis
of events collected early in the run and those collected later in
the run yield comparable results. A measurement should be
aborted if peaks are not distinguishable and the histogrammed
data appears relatively featureless from ETeff ¼ 0–1.
25. In assessing our data, we often compare peak ETeff values
obtained by ﬁtting the histograms as described here. However,
if one wishes to calculate distances based on the peak ETeff
values, there are a number of polymer models appropriate for
IDPs that may be solved numerically for this purpose [29].
26. β corrects for ﬂuorescence from the donor ﬂuorophore that is
detected by the acceptor photodiode. We typically determine
this on a daily basis. Use a 20 nM solution of Alexa Fluor
488 hydrazide; collect a 60 s intensity trace in both the donor
and acceptor detectors. Calculate β as
β ¼
I a
I a þ I d
ð4Þ
where Ia ¼ intensity of acceptor channel and Id ¼ intensity of
donor channel. For our instrument, typical values of β vary
between 6% and 8% of the sum of intensities from both chan-
nels. However, β remains fairly stable for a system that does not
undergo major realignments.
27. γ accounts for differences in the quantum yields of the donor
and the acceptor ﬂuorophores, the use of bandpass ﬁlters that
772
Sanjula P. Wickramasinghe and Elizabeth Rhoades

select only a portion of emitted photons and differences in the
quantum efﬁciencies of the detectors:
γ ¼ naϕa
ndϕd
ð5Þ
where na and nd are the detection efﬁciency of the acceptor and
donor detectors, respectively, and øa and ød are the quantum
yield of acceptor and donor ﬂuorophores, respectively [30]. We
typically determine γ every 3–4 months. To do so, make stock
concentrations of Alexa Fluor 488 hydrazide and Alexa Fluor
594 hydrazide with equal absorbances at the wavelength of
donor excitation (488 nm for our example). Make serial dilu-
tions of each dye solution. Dilute the initial solutions equally—
the acceptor sample will be much more concentrated than the
donor sample, as its ﬂuorescence when excited at the donor
wavelength is much less. Measure ﬂuorescence intensities of
the dyes on the smFRET instrument using low laser power, as
these solutions are much higher concentration (μM) than those
used for smFRET. Plot of the intensities of the Alexa 594 ﬂuo-
rescence on the y-axis versus the Alexa 488 ﬂuorescence on the
x axis. The slope of a straight line ﬁt to this data is γ. Values of γ
will be dependent upon the exact components of the instru-
ment; on our systems, typical values of γ are from 1 to 1.4.
28. PolyP samples should only be subjected to a few freeze-thaw
cycles. Therefore it is useful to have many aliquots of polyP at
concentrations convenient for only one or two sets of
measurements.
29. Some binding partners increase the background signal over
buffer and a higher threshold may be required.
30. For labeling positions, which give rise to low peak ETeff values
(<0.2), it may not be possible to distinguish events arising
from donor-acceptor labeled protein from the ETeff ¼ 0 peak
using an instrument as described here (Fig. 4). Alternating
laser excitation (ALEX) [31, 32] or pulsed interleaving excita-
tion (PIE) [33] uses a second laser to directly excite the accep-
tor ﬂuorophore. Measurements are made with switching
between the donor and acceptor excitation lasers and correlat-
ing the detected photons with the appropriate excitation pulse.
This allows for discrimination of true low ETeff events from
donor-acceptor labeled protein (which will have a signal when
directly excited by the acceptor laser) and ETeff ¼ 0 events from
donor-only labeled protein (which will not have a signal when
excited by the acceptor laser).

Detection of Multisite Phosphorylation of Intrinsically
Disordered Proteins Using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE
Mihkel O¨ rd and Mart Loog
Abstract
Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE is a method that enables electrophoretic separation of proteins based on their
phosphorylation status. With Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE, it is possible to discriminate between different
phosphoforms of proteins based on their phosphorylation level and the number of phosphorylated sites,
and to determine the stoichiometry of different phosphorylation products. Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE is
useful for analyzing disordered proteins with multiple phosphorylation sites and can be used for any of
the downstream applications used in combination with conventional SDS-PAGE, for example, Western
blotting and mass-spectrometry. To obtain the best results with Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE, however, it is
often necessary to optimize the gel composition. Depending on the molecular weight and number of
phosphoryl groups added to the protein, different gel composition or running conditions should be used.
Here, we provide protocols for Mn2+- and Zn2+-Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE and give examples of how
disordered proteins with different characteristics behave in gels with various Phos-tag concentrations.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) or entirely intrinsically dis-
ordered proteins (IDPs) have recently emerged as key players of
signaling networks and regulatory pathways [1]. The ﬂexible nature
of IDPs enables accessibility to various enzymes, and therefore, the
majority of post-translational modiﬁcations take place in disordered
regions [2, 3]. Protein phosphorylation is a reversible modiﬁcation
that occurs in over 30% of eukaryotic proteins and has been shown
to affect their activity, stability, subcellular localization, and inter-
actions
[4].

importance in many cellular processes, there is a need for widely
usable methods to analyze phosphorylation states.
IDPs
often
contain
multiple
phosphorylated
clusters
[5, 6]. One of the model phosphorylation targets is budding yeast
Sic1, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) substrate. In late G1 phase,
Sic1 is phosphorylated by G1/S-CDK, priming it for full phos-
phorylation on 6-8 sites by S-CDK [7]. Sic1 phosphorylation was
shown to occur in an ordered N-to-C-terminal manner, terminat-
ing in the phosphorylation of the di-phosphodegrons [7, 8]. In
order to understand how IDPs function as signal-processing hubs,
new methods that enabled quantitative analysis of phosphorylation
were required.
SDS-PAGE enables separation of proteins based on their
molecular weight [9]. A phosphate group attached to a protein
can disrupt the binding of SDS to the protein and can lead to slower
electrophoretic mobility of the phosphoprotein compared to its
nonphosphorylated counterpart [10]. This has enabled detection
of phosphorylation shifts using SDS-PAGE, and has been widely
used for studying phospho regulation. This approach, however, has
strong limitations. The effect of phosphorylation on the electro-
phoretic mobility of the protein depends on the protein context
around the phosphorylation site and, therefore, many phosphory-
lation events do not lead to a decrease in mobility. The second
widely used tool, the use of phosphorylation-speciﬁc antibodies,
enables one to detect site-speciﬁc modiﬁcations and has worked
well for the detection of phosphotyrosine; however, the speciﬁcity
of anti-phosphoserine/threonine antibodies is often problematic
[10]. Additionally, mass-spectrometry is a powerful method for
studying phosphorylation (see Valk et al in the same issue), but
the standard approaches usually enable one to detect phosphoryla-
tion sites and do not include information about the stoichiometry
of different sites [11].
A phosphate-afﬁnity electrophoresis method developed in the
group of Prof. Koike (Hiroshima University) often provides a way
to overcome these limitations [12]. Phos-tag is a phosphate-
binding molecule that can be co-polymerized in acrylamide gels.
During electrophoresis, Phos-tag in complex with either Mn2+ or
Zn2+ ions binds selectively to phosphates, thereby decreasing the
mobility of phosphorylated proteins and enabling their separation
based on phosphorylation status (Fig. 1). While being a powerful
method, Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE often requires optimization of
acrylamide, Phos-tag concentrations, and the running conditions
to ﬁnd a suitable protocol for each protein.
Phos-tag can be used with either Mn2+ or Zn2+ ions. Mn2+-
Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE is based on the conventional Laemmli
buffer system and is therefore very easily adaptable to any lab that
uses SDS-PAGE. Zn2+-Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE uses a neutral pH
Bis-Tris buffer system and has been shown to have improved separa-
tion of some phosphoproteins compared to the Mn2+ system [13].

In this chapter, we provide protocols for studying multisite
phosphorylation of IDPs using Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE. We give
examples of how changing Phos-tag concentration in the gel affects
the separation of phospho forms in proteins that differ in size and
the number of phosphorylation sites.

Fig. 1 Principle of Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE. Phos-tag is an acrylamide pendant that copolymerizes with
acrylamide. The Phos-tag compound binds two Zn2+ or Mn2+ ions that selectively capture phosphorylated
serines, threonines, and tyrosines. In Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE, the electrophoretic mobility of phosphorylated
proteins will be decreased due to their binding to Phos-tag. This leads to separation of proteins based on their
phosphorylation status, thereby enabling one to discriminate different phosphorylated forms based on the
number of phosphates added to the protein, and also in some cases based on the site of phosphorylation

temperature for 10 min and the reactions were stopped by
adding 3 sample buffer, diluting it to 1 concentration.
500–2000 ng of substrate protein was loaded on the gel.
3.2
Preparing
Phos-tagTM
SDS-PAGE Gels
Mn2+-Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE gels can be stored for up to 24 h at
4 C in the dark. Zn2+-Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE gels are stable for at
least 3 months at 4 C in the dark due to the neutral gel buffer.
1. Assemble the gel cassette according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (see Note 11).
2. Prepare the resolving gel mixture according to Table 1 for
Mn2+ and Table 2 for Zn2+ (see Notes 12 and 13). To obtain
the best results, the acrylamide and Phos-tag concentrations in
the gel should be optimized for each protein (see Note 14 and
Figs. 2 and 3).
3. Inject the resolving gel to the gel cassette, leaving space for the
stacking gel. Gently cover the gel with water or isobutanol and
allow the acrylamide to polymerize for 30 min (see Note 15).
4. Prepare the stacking gel mixture (see Note 12).
For Mn2+-based gels, mix 1.4 mL water, 0.33 mL 30%
acrylamide solution (29:1), 0.25 mL 1 M Tris–HCl solution,
pH 6.8, 20 μL 10% SDS, 2 μL TEMED, and ﬁnally 20 μL
10% APS.
For Zn2+-based gels, mix 1.19 mL water, 0.33 mL 30%
acrylamide solution (29:1), 0.5 mL 1.4M Bis–Tris–HCl solu-
tion, pH 6.8, 2 μL TEMED, and ﬁnally 10 μL 10% APS.

Fig. 2 The effect of Phos-tag concentration on the separation and migration of
phosphorylated proteins. Six S. cerevisiae Cdk1 kinase substrates were phos-
phorylated, the reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer, and
the samples were loaded onto either conventional SDS-PAGE gel or different
Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE gels, containing 8% acrylamide and either 100 μM,
50 μM, or 25 μM Phos-tag. The proteins were of different molecular weights
(MW), ranging from 26 to 109 kDa, and contained different number of phosphor-
ylation sites. The electrophoresis of Mn2+-Phos-tag gels was performed at
15 mA/gel for 2 h and 15 min (the dye reached the end of the gel at 1 h and
45 min) and Zn2+-Phos-tag gels were run for 3 h (the dye reached the bottom of
the gel at 2 h and 25 min). 32P autoradiographs of the gels are shown. It is
possible to observe that a higher Phos-tag concentration leads to efﬁcient
separation of non-phosphorylated forms from the phosphoforms; however,
lowering the Phos-tag concentration can be necessary to improve the resolution
of phosphoproteins that are phosphorylated at multiple sites

Fig. 3 Decoding the multisite phosphorylation pattern. Phosphorylation of S. cerevisiae Sic1(1–215) by Cdk1
was analyzed using Mn2+-Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE. To uncover the identity of the bands in the gel, Sic1 mutants
containing different single phosphorylation sites or combinations of sites were analyzed. (a) Scheme showing
the phosphorylation sites in Sic1 N-terminus. (b, c) Phosphorylated proteins were studied using an Mn2+-
Phos-tag gel with 10% acrylamide and 100 μM Phos-tag. (b) The gel stained with Coomassie G-250. The ﬁrst
lane on the left shows unphosphorylated wild-type (WT) substrate. (c) 32P autoradiograph of the same gel.
With the WT protein, at least ten different phosphoforms can be seen. To identify the different species, we
analyzed the phosphorylation of mutated proteins that contained only select sites. The WT protein contains
eight phosphorylation sites, while in the other proteins all phosphorylation sites except the ones indicated on
top of the gel were mutated to alanines. It can be seen that phosphorylation of T5, T33, and S76 leads to
different electrophoretic mobility. Therefore, it is possible to detect the stoichiometry of different singly
phosphorylated forms from the multisite phosphorylation pattern of the WT protein. This, on the other hand,
makes it harder to interpret the pattern seen on the Phos-tag gel. Next, by adding back further phosphorylation
sites, one can determine the identities of the phosphoforms in the multisite phosphorylation pattern

4. Perform the electrophoresis at 15 mA per gel at least until the
bromophenol blue reaches the bottom of the gel. The electro-
phoresis duration depends on the target protein and the gel
concentration used (see Note 19).
5. After electrophoresis, open the gel plates. The gel will remain
on one of the plates; rinse the gel with water and proceed to the
post-electrophoresis method.

Post-
electrophoresis
Methods
Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE can be used in combination with any of the
downstream applications as conventional SDS-PAGE (e.g., Coo-
massie staining, Western Blotting, 2D electrophoresis, mass-
spectrometrical analysis).
3.4.1
Coomassie
Staining
1. Following electrophoresis, soak the gel in ﬁxation solution for
15 min with gentle agitation.
2. Stain the gel using Colloidal Coomassie G-250 staining solu-
tion for at least 1 h with gentle agitation.
3. Wash the gel with water until the background is sufﬁciently
clear.
3.4.2
Western Blotting
1. Following electrophoresis, wash the gel with running buffer
with added 10 mM EDTA or transfer buffer with added
10 mM EDTA with gentle agitation for 1–3 times for 10 min
each (see Note 20).
2. Soak the gel in running buffer or transfer buffer without EDTA
for 10 min with gentle agitation.
3. Carry out Western Blotting as conventional SDS-PAGE. For a
detailed protocol about Phos-tag SDS-PAGE Western Blot-
ting, see Ref. 14.
3.4.3
Autoradiography
1. Following electrophoresis, stain the gel with Coomassie G-250
as in Subheading 3.3, step 1.
2. Moisten three layers of cellulose ﬁlter paper with water, place
the gel on the paper, and cover with cellophane plastic wrap.
3. Place the gel covered with ﬁlter paper and plastic wrap in a gel
dryer. Turn on the heating and vacuum and dry the gel.

4. Insert the dried gel to a cassette and expose to a storage
phosphor screen. Sufﬁcient exposure time is around 1–24 h.
5. Detect the autoradiography signals using phosphoimager.

Notes
1. Light catalyzes the conversion of acrylamide to acrylic acid and
ammonia, so one must protect the acrylamide solution from
light by wrapping the bottle with aluminum foil. Ready-to-use
acrylamide solutions can also be used and should be stable at
4 C in the dark for at least a year.
2. Water at the bottom of the cylinder helps dissolve the Tris.
3. If necessary, the SDS solution can be heated to 68 C to
dissolve the SDS. Store the solution at room temperature as
SDS can precipitate at 4 C.
4. Methanol helps dissolve the Phos-tag. An aqueous Phos-tag
solution can also be prepared, but meticulous mixing is
required to ensure complete dissolution of Phos-tag. Also, a
ready-to-use Phos-tag solution is available (Wako Chemicals).
5. Use MnCl2, but not other manganese salts, for the Mn2+
solution. Use of other salts or impure water can lead to oxida-
tion and formation of brown MnO(OH), which will lead to
loss of Mn2+ function.
6. For best results, prepare the 10% APS solution just before use.
7. Prepare the ZnCl2 solution just before use. ZnCl2 is deliques-
cent and, therefore, should be protected from moisture in air. If
precipitates can be seen, please ﬁlter the solution. Also, 10 mM
Zn(NO3)2 can be used instead of ZnCl2.
8. Incorporation of [γ-32P]-ATP to the substrate proteins in an
in vitro kinase assay enables very sensitive and precise detection
of phosphorylation using autoradiography. However, use of
[γ-32P]-ATP is not necessary when the proteins in the gel are
detected by Coomassie staining or Western blotting. 32P is a
radioactive isotope and, therefore, work with [γ-32P]-ATP should
be performed only in a specialized laboratory. Always work
behind a plexiglass shield, wear protective clothing and spectacles,
and minimize the time handling samples with [γ-32P]-ATP.
9. The exact details in this protocol were prepared for a Hoefer
SE260 electrophoresis system where 10 cm  10.5 cm  1 mm
gels are used. For example, in this system, the resolving gel
solution volume is 5 mL and the stacking gel 2 mL. However,
the protocol can be adapted to any other electrophoresis system
by changing the solution volumes and electrophoresis conditions.
10. Sic1, Fin1, and Cdc6 were phosphorylated with Clb5-Cdk1,
while Mob1, Bud3, and Bni1 were phosphorylated with Clb2-
Phos-Tag SDS-PAGE of IDPs
789

Cdk1. Sic1, Fin1, and Cdc6 were fused to 6His tag, whereas
Mob1, Bud3, and Bni1 were GST fusions. For Sic1, Bud3, and
Bni1, truncated proteins were used (Sic1(1-215), Bud3(1222-
1636), Bni1(1215-1953)).
11. It is advisable to use a notched alumina ceramic backplate
instead of a glass plate because the ceramic plate transfers
heat more rapidly. Excessive gel temperature during electro-
phoresis can lead to smearing of bands.
12. Many SDS-PAGE protocols suggest degassing the gel solution
prior to the addition of ammonium persulfate. While this is not
requisite for polymerization, it leads to quicker and more
uniform polymerization and can be necessary to achieve repro-
ducibility of the gels in some cases. Acrylamide is polymerized
via free radical polymerization that is started by the radical
initiator ammonium persulfate and the catalyst TEMED. Oxy-
gen is a free-radical quencher and will inhibit acrylamide poly-
merization, therefore it is advised to degas the gel solution to
remove oxygen.
13. After the addition of ammonium persulfate and TEMED to the
resolving gel solution, mix the solution gently without produc-
ing bubbles and inject into the gel cassette. The acrylamide will
polymerize in about 5–15 min.
14. The optimal gel composition depends mainly on the molecular
weight of the protein and the number of phosphates attached
to the protein. In general, the optimal acrylamide concentra-
tion for proteins that are less than 20 kDa is 10%, less than
60 kDa is 8%, and above 60 kDa is 6%. Next, the concentration
of Phos-tag acrylamide should be optimized. Run gels with
different Phos-tag concentrations (e.g., 20, 50, and 100 μM)
and select the concentration that provides the highest separa-
tion between the different phospho forms. A higher Phos-tag
concentration
leads
to
higher
separation
between
the
non-phosphorylated protein and the phospho protein. How-
ever, if the sample contains differentially phosphorylated forms
of the protein, a high Phos-tag concentration can lead to
different highly phosphorylated forms being indistinguishable,
because a high Phos-tag concentration also reduces the degree
of migration (see Fig. 2 for examples). Therefore, the number
of phosphorylated sites is also an important determinant in
selecting the Phos-tag concentration. High Phos-tag concen-
tration
(100
μM)
results
in
high
separation
of
the
non-phosphorylated form and proteins containing few phos-
phorylated sites. Low Phos-tag concentration (25 μM), how-
ever, can increase separation of highly multiphosphorylated
forms (see Figs. 2 and 3). In case of complex samples such as
cell lysates, lower Phos-tag concentrations ranging from 10 to
25 μM should be used. For examples of how proteins with
different molecular weights behave in various Phos-tagTM
790

SDS-PAGE conditions, see Fig. 2. For phosphorylation analysis
of large proteins (around and over 200 kDa), see Kinoshita
et al. [10].
15. Covering the resolving gel with water or isobutanol protects the
gel from oxygen, which inhibits acrylamide polymerization.
16. EDTA, inorganic salts, and surfactants can lead to the distor-
tion of bands in Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE. In case of problems,
the proteins in the sample should be precipitated using TCA
and re-dissolved in sample buffer. Also, if there are chelating
agents in the buffer, 1 mM MnCl2 or ZnCl2 can be added to
the sample. Empty lanes should be avoided; load 1 sample
buffer to the empty lanes. Additionally, increasing the poly-
merization time or optimizing APS and TEMED concentra-
tion in the gel can improve electrophoresis quality.
17. Incubation at 95 C can lead to chemical changes in the proteins,
especially deamidation of asparagine residues, which can lead to
changes in electrophoretic mobility. Deamidation is dependent
on the protein context, for example, Asn-Gly sequences, present
in many IDPs, are prone to deamidation. Lowering the tempera-
ture to 72 C reduces the rate of deamidation.
18. Use of molecular weight markers is not recommended because
pre-stained markers can cause distortions and the molecular
weight estimations can be inaccurate. As a reference, a recom-
binant puriﬁed protein or a dephosphorylated sample should
be used. It is also advisable to run the samples on conventional
SDS-PAGE gels and compare with the results obtained with
Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE to determine if the bands detected
with Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE are due to phosphorylation or
occur due to other reasons (e.g., degradation or impurities).
19. Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE decreases the migration velocity of
both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins, there-
fore, longer electrophoresis times should be used compared to
conventional SDS-PAGE.
20. Phos-tag decreases the transferring efﬁciency of phosphory-
lated proteins. To improve the transfer, it is necessary to wash
the Mn2+ or Zn2+ from the gel by soaking in transfer buffer
with an additional 10 mM EDTA. The transfer can be per-
formed either by semi-dry or wet-tank method; however,
higher transfer efﬁciency has been seen with the wet-tank
transfer [15]. Transfer buffer can be 50 mM Tris, 2.9 g/L
glycine, 0.37 g/L SDS, 20% (v/v) methanol.

Multiple Site-Speciﬁc Phosphorylation of IDPs Monitored
by NMR

Abstract
In line with their high accessibility, disordered proteins are exquisite targets of kinases. Eukaryotic organ-
isms use the so-called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or intrinsically disordered regions of proteins
(IDRs) as molecular switches carrying intracellular information tuned by reversible phosphorylation
schemes. Solvent-exposed serines and threonines are abundant in IDPs, and, consistently, kinases often
modify disordered regions of proteins at multiple sites. In this context, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy provides quantitative, residue-speciﬁc information that permits mapping of phosphosites and
monitoring of their individual kinetics. Hence, NMR monitoring emerges as an in vitro approach,
complementary to mass-spectrometry or immuno-blotting, to characterize IDP phosphorylation compre-
hensively. Here, we describe in detail generic protocols for carrying out NMR monitoring of IDP phos-
phorylation, and we provide a number of practical insights that improve handiness and reproducibility of
this method.

Introduction
Living organisms use post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) as a
convenient mechanism to transmit information in a fast and revers-
ible fashion. PTMs can provoke changes in protein conformation or
create/abolish binding sites, therefore regulating the activity of
proteins. In eukaryotes, serine/threonine phosphorylation repre-
sents about 60% of the detected PTMs [1, 2]. Intrinsically disor-
dered regions (IDRs) of proteins carry ~60% of the ~200,000
phosphosites found in the 13,000 human phosphoproteins [3, 4],
in line with their importance in cell signaling [5]. Interestingly,
phosphosites tend to cluster: about half of them are at a distance
of
four

phosphoproteins have six phosphosites or more [7]. This generates
potential crosstalks, collective effects, and improved robustness of
signaling [5, 8–10]. A large number of detected phosphorylation
sites may also reveal loose speciﬁcities that result from the promis-
cuous access of kinases to IDP residues [11]: a majority of the
detected phosphosites in cultured cells shows a fractional occu-
pancy of 25% or less, the functional role of such events being
unclear [7, 12].
The most popular methods to detect phosphorylation are
mass-spectrometry (MS) and western-blotting because of their
ability to detect phosphosites in biological material with high sen-
sitivity. However, multiple neighboring phosphorylation sites ham-
per immuno-recognition and prevent standard peptide isolation/
enrichment/ionization/identiﬁcation steps in the course of MS
analysis, although technical advances have been achieved in this
ﬁeld [13]. Degenerate motifs are also problematic in western-
blotting because they hinder site-speciﬁc immuno-recognition.
Finally, improving phosphoproteome coverage is a perpetual battle:
even though novel buffers, enrichment methods, chromatography,
and digestion protocols progressively enhance sampling depth
[14, 15], accessible data from immunoblots and MS can probably
not provide a comprehensive view of the PTM schemes established
on your protein of interest.
NMR spectroscopy is a complementary method because of its
intrinsic ability to provide quantitative, residue-speciﬁc information
on IDPs in solution [16]. Using the “NMR isotope-ﬁlter,”
15N-labeled proteins are the only observable species in the presence
of natural abundance 14N-containing material, which makes it
possible to monitor phosphorylation reactions of a 15N-labeled
IDP in vitro and in cell extracts [17, 18]. For example, it has been
instrumental in solving complex phosphorylation cascades on
PTEN [19], or to elucidate the respective kinetics and roles of
degenerate Erk phosphosites on Elk1 [20].
NMR
spectroscopy
provides
residue-speciﬁc
information
because nuclei resonance frequencies depend on their chemical
environment. Upon phosphorylation, the chemical environment
changes in the vicinity of the phosphorylated residues, provoking
new chemical shifts for residues neighboring the phosphosites. We
illustrate it here with the example of a BRCA2 fragment
(aa48–218), phosphorylated at S193 and T207, which generates
large chemical shift perturbations for S193 and T207, but also weak
but discernable NMR signal displacements of their neighboring
residues D189, S195, L198, A199, T203, and V211 (Fig. 1a)
[16, 21]. Hence, by recording time series of NMR spectra during
the phosphorylation reactions, we can obtain time-resolved quan-
tiﬁcation or reaction advancement at every phosphosite: new cross-
peaks
appear
while
some
peaks
progressively
disappear,
corresponding to phosphorylated and non-modiﬁed populations,

Fig. 1 NMR analysis of BRCA2(aa48–218) phosphorylation by Plk1 ([BRCA2] ¼ 50 μM, [Plk1] ¼ 200 nM,
spectra recorded at 700 MHz). (a) Overlay of 1H-15N 2D HSQC spectra recorded at 283 K before (reference,
black) and after the phosphorylation reaction (tﬁnal, red). Arrows highlight NMR chemical shift perturbations
upon phosphorylation. The two phosphosites S193 and T207 crosspeaks show large perturbation; their
neighbor residues D189, S193, S195 and L198, T203 and V211 also shift and can be used as phosphorylation
reporters. Measuring the crosspeak intensities of the non-modiﬁed species (called later “non-phosphopeaks”)
in the two 283 K spectra provides Iﬁnal/Iref ratios, which later permit normalization of the phosphorylation build-
up curves. (b) Depiction of three time-points in the time series of 2D 1H-15N SOFAST-HMQC spectra recorded
at 298 K during the reaction (grey spectra). We superimposed them on the reference spectrum at t¼0 (black

respectively (Fig. 1b). More complex situations can emerge when
close residues are concomitantly phosphorylated: two neighboring
sites S1 and S2 (separated by ~4–6 amino acids or less) will generate
a set of four peaks upon phosphorylation, corresponding to S1–S2,
pS1–S2, S1–pS2, and pS1–pS2, where pS1–S2 and S1–pS2 peaks
may increase and later decrease (see for example [19, 22, 23]).
In the past years, we have successfully monitored phosphoryla-
tion reactions using NMR on a large variety of IDPs and kinases.
Here, we provide a generic protocol integrating a sum of technical
solutions focusing on sample preparation, control of the reaction
conditions, and instrument parameters for generating reliable data.
We also provide some explanations for the rationale and warnings
to avoid misinterpretation (see Note 1). We illustrate the protocol
with results obtained on a BRCA2 fragment (aa48–218) phos-
phorylated by Plk1.

Materials
2.1
Stock Solutions
Preparation
and Storage
Prepare all solutions using milli-Q water (resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm
at 25 C). Buffers, reagents stocks, and proteins can be kept at
20 C for months, but fresh dithiothreitol (DTT) or tris(2-car-
boxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) should be added to the samples
before performing experiments. DTT half-life in solution is indeed
about 1 day at pH ~ 7 and even decreases in presence of metal ions
[24], so buffers containing DTT should not be stored. Other
reducing agents may be used with proﬁt but also with careful
attention (see Note 2).
We describe standard buffers using Hepes at 50 mM, pH 7.0.
Any good buffering molecule in this range of pH would also be
acceptable, for example, phosphate, PIPES, and MOPS, whose
pKas also have low temperature coefﬁcients (see Note 3).

Fig. 1 (continued) A199 crosspeaks (orange) report on S193 phosphorylation, while T207 (magenta) and V211
(blue) crosspeaks report on T207 phosphorylation. The non-phosphoT207 peak partially overlaps with other
resonances, and is thus a reporter of poor quality. (c) Treatment of peak intensities from raw data, to
normalized intensities and interpretation in %phosphorylation. The value Intt¼0 of a non-phosphopeak is
obtained from the tangent at t¼0 of a non-phosphopeak evolution curve, and can then be used for normalizing
this evolution. Build-up curves of phosphopeaks are normalized by intensity ratios measured at 283 K Iﬁnal/Iref
(see Subheading 3.5). To make the graphs clearer, we show only A199 crosspeaks evolution as a reporter of
S193 phosphorylation; S193, S195 and L198 crosspeaks can also be used, see (a). Similarly, T203 cross-
peaks can be used as reporters of T207 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation build-up curves are preferably
obtained from non-phosphopeaks decay analysis. They can be normalized easily using the reference
intensities at 0% phosphorylation; at the opposite, because a phosphorylation reaction rarely goes to
completion, the reference intensities of phosphopeaks at 100% phosphorylation can be difﬁcult to determine

9. 15N-labeled IDP stock solution at a concentration greater than
or equal to 200–250 μM is stored at 80 C. Aliquoting
prevents eventual aggregation that often appears upon multiple
freeze-thaw cycles.
10. Kinase stock solution: active kinase is obtained either commer-
cially or produced in-house. Prepare low-volume aliquots on
ice (2–10 μL, providing a phosphate transfer activity in the
range of 50–500 pmol/min) and ﬂash-freeze them before
storage at 80 C. Aliquoting preserves kinase activity which
may be lost upon freeze-thaw cycles, and will thus favor experi-
mental reproducibility. Addition of 20% glycerol promotes
activity conservation.

1. High-ﬁeld NMR spectrometer (larger or equal to 600 MHz)
equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe.
2. A 1H-15N SOFAST-HMQC pulse sequence program. This can
be found in most of the standard pulse sequence libraries. Be
careful with the default pulses used in libraries: the central
band-selective 180 pulse should be an REBURP and not an
r-SNOB to get maximal S/N, as shown by Schanda et al.
[25]. Set interscan delays to ~100 ms and use a high number
of dummy scans (>64). Set offset frequencies of shaped pulses
to 8.5 ppm and use large pulse lengths (>2.4 ms) to avoid
saturation of water protons magnetization. Because of fast
amide-water proton exchange in IDPs, water protons represent
a magnetization reservoir enhancing the apparent amide inter-
scan T1-recovery [26]. For this reason, great S/N enhance-
ment is obtained for IDPs using long shaped pulses at ﬁelds
higher than 600–700 MHz, since amide and water proton
frequencies become distant enough.

4. NMR tubes. These can be 3 or 5 mm diameter regular tubes,
which must be ﬁlled with minimal volumes of 150 or 475 μL,
respectively. In standard phosphorylation buffer conditions,
5 mm tubes offer about twice S/N than 3 mm tubes. Using
3 or 5 mm diameter Shigemi tubes optimizes sample efﬁciency
by reducing sample volumes to 90 or 270 μL, respectively.
4 mm Shigemi tubes (efﬁcient volume: 180 μL) also exist.

Methods
The following protocol describes a generic strategy to monitor IDP
phosphorylation using NMR spectroscopy. This requires the prior
production and puriﬁcation of the protein of interest uniformly 15N
or 15N/13C labeled. Such labeling is usually obtained by recombi-
nant protein expression in bacteria (see Note 4). Bacterial expres-
sion is preferred for this protocol because it generates recombinant,
non-phosphorylated proteins in most cases (see Note 5). We will
not detail the corresponding tasks, but we must stress a few points
that should be considered with great care for later success in phos-
phorylation characterization. The IDP of interest can be puriﬁed
using standard strategies adapted to the presence or absence of
afﬁnity tags. First, to avoid any artifactual inﬂuence of such tags,
their cleavage and removal is generally preferred before executing
PTMs’ kinetics experiments. Second, because of their high accessi-
bility, IDP’s cysteines are prone to establish non-native disulﬁde
bonds in vitro. The complete reduction of cysteine thiols at every
step of the puriﬁcation is mandatory (see Note 2). Third, IDPs’
susceptibility to proteolysis must be addressed by adding protease
inhibitors in lysis buffer and after every puriﬁcation step.
The protocol starts with the last preparation steps of the IDP
sample, then describes a method to optimize the phosphorylation
conditions, and later a method to assign the NMR spectra in the
phosphorylation conditions. The two ﬁnal subsections detail the
NMR data acquisition and analysis. We have introduced two possi-
ble methods to record NMR spectra, either by a continuous read-
out of a single sample during the phosphorylation reaction
(Subheading 3.4.1 NMR continuous readout) or by successive
measurements of aliquots quenched at various time points (Sub-
heading 3.4.2 The “Quenched reaction” approach). The ﬁrst
approach is more convenient in many aspects, but it provides too
weak S/N for a number of IDPs (see Note 6). All other paragraphs
are common to all IDPs.
3.1
Preparation
of the IDP Stock
We start the protocol with the last preparation step of the IDP,
which consists of an SEC. This permits (1) to polish the protein
puriﬁcation, and (2) to transfer the IDP into the exact salt and
buffer conditions used for the phosphorylation reaction.
1. Equilibrate the SEC column with two column-volumes of
SEC-B, previously ﬁltered on a 0.22 μm pore-size membrane.
IDP Phosphorylation Monitored by NMR

Using an FPLC system at 4 C will lower the risks of IDP
proteolysis.
2. Concentrate the puriﬁed IDP to a ﬁnal volume of 2 mL in the
presence of 2 mM DTT and PIs (ﬁnal concentration 1), using
concentrators with centrifugation steps at 10 C (4000  g for
swinging buckets, 5000  g for ﬁxed angle rotors).
3. Add DTT to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM DTT to the
concentrated sample and incubate it for 30 min at RT to ensure
that all thiols are reduced.
4. Centrifuge the sample for 5 min at 16,000  g and 4 C to
remove aggregates and inject the supernatant on the equili-
brated SEC column.
5. Run the SEC with parameters recommended by manufacturers
and check the purity of the eluted fractions by SDS-PAGE.
6. Pool the fractions of interest, supplement them with 2 mM
DTT (ﬁnal concentration) and PIs (ﬁnal concentration 1),
and concentrate the protein to 250 μM by centrifugation at
10 C (4000  g for swinging buckets, 5000  g for ﬁxed angle
rotors).
7. Flash freeze the sample in liquid nitrogen and store it at
80 C.
3.2
Optimization
of Phosphorylation
Conditions
For every IDP:kinase pair, phosphorylation kinetics can be ﬁrst
evaluated by SDS-PAGE in order to identify the appropriate con-
centration of kinase and, eventually, the best buffer conditions. This
relies on the fact that phosphorylated amino acids tend to slow
down protein migration during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). SDS-binding
to phosphoproteins is thought to be weaker, which provokes
decreased electrophoretic mobility [27]. However, this effect can
be negligible for proteins carrying large excess (~15 or more) of
negative charges due to a biased composition between Glu/Asp
and Arg/Lys; this situation calls for directly moving on to NMR
monitoring. Here, we describe the procedure for the SDS-PAGE
evaluation of phosphorylation efﬁciency.
1. Thaw the IDP sample, and prepare three samples of 25 μL
containing the IDP at 25 μM in Phos-B.
2. Calculate the amount of kinase to add. As a ﬁrst estimation, this
quantity should correspond to a theoretical capacity to phos-
phorylate all predicted phosphosites in 1 h, with no consider-
ation for the Km.
Commercial kinase activity has normally been evaluated,
and this information is often presented in nmol/min of phos-
phate transfer per mg of kinase (together with the kinase
concentration). The quantity of kinase to use is thus obtained
using the equation:
800
Manon Julien et al.

M kinase ¼ N sites‐predicted  CIDP  V reaction= Kinactivity  treaction


With Nsites-predicted the number of phosphorylation sites
predicted from the known kinase consensus site (see Note 7),
CIDP is the IDP concentration in molar, Vreaction the reaction
volume in liters, Kinactivity the activity of the kinase in mol/-
min/mg, and treaction the incubation time in minutes. Mkinase is
thus in mg.
Hence, our rough evaluation gives Mkinase ¼ Nsites-predicted
 1011/Kinactivity, which often translates into volumes lower
than 1 μL of kinase stock solution. Prepare a diluted kinase
stock to make it convenient to pipet.
For in-house produced kinase, whose activity has not yet
been characterized, (1) if the kinase is activated (phosphory-
lated or in complex with activators), use Mkinase ~ 10 ng (kinase:
IDP molar ratio of 1:2500); (2) if the kinase is not activated,
use Mkinase ~ 100 ng (kinase:IDP molar ratio of 1:250).
For phosphorylation of IDP by cell extract, see Note 8.
3. Spike Vkinase ¼ Mkinase  [kinase], 3  Vkinase and 9  Vkinase in
the three pre-phospho mixes prepared in step 1. Incubate at
298 K.
4. Take 4 μL of the samples at 0 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, and
2 h, mix them to 4 μL of 2 Laemmli buffer and heat them
immediately for 5 min at 95 C.
5. Load the samples on a polyacrylamide gel.
6. Run the SDS-PAGE, stain with Coomassie Blue or any other
better suited staining method. Pick the kinase concentration
that will permit to distinguish phosphorylation events using

the typical phosphorylation shifts provoked by successive phosphorylation
events. Although it is no fully characterized, it appears that SDS binds less to
phosphoproteins, which slows down electrophoretic migration [27]. Peptides
carrying a high net negative charge (~15 or more) do not shift as well upon
phosphorylation (15% polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie blue, lane X
shows a default in gel loading)

the NMR time resolution, that is, 15–30 min per time point
over 3–5 h (most kinases lose their activity after a few hours at
25 C).
7. Buffer conditions can also be evaluated. To this purpose, pre-
pare stock solutions of the various conditions to test. One may
test a range of pH values (pH 7–7.5–8) and of salt concentra-
tions (50–100–150 mM NaCl). Repeat steps 1–6. If the reac-
tion is much faster at high pH, adopting the “quenched
reaction approach” may be the method of choice to monitor
phosphorylation by NMR. However, if the activity of your
kinase is acceptable at pH 7.0, we recommend running the
phosphorylation reaction at this pH. For most kinases, pH 7
corresponds to an acceptable compromise between kinase
activity and decent quality of IDPs’ NMR spectra.
3.3
Assignment
of NMR Spectra
in the Conditions Used
for Phosphorylation
Reactions
To extract residue-speciﬁc information, assignment of the IDP’s
NMR spectra is a prerequisite. While phosphorylation reactions will
typically be executed at 298 K and pH ~7, assignment is usually
performed at conditions favorable for NMR analysis of IDPs, that
is, low temperature (~283 K) and pH (~6.5), which decrease
water/amide
proton
exchange
and
consequently
maximize
S/N. We will not detail this primary assignment strategy relying
on the use of 3-dimensional spectra establishing connections
between spins of backbone nuclei (the most useful ones in the
case of IDPs being HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, and (H)N
(CA)NH).
We describe below the next step that aims at inferring the
1H-15N crosspeaks assignment in the conditions used for phos-
phorylation. It relies on a temperature and pH gradient from the
assignment conditions to the phosphorylation conditions, using
DSS as an internal reference. 2D 1H-15N HSQC or SOFAST-
HMQC pulse sequences can be used. SOFAST-HMQC will be
better suited at higher pH and temperature because of its higher
S/N efﬁciency.
1. Record a 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the IDP at ~100 μM
in the pH (pHassign) and temperature (Tassign) conditions used
for prior assignment.
2. Record 2D 1H-15N HSQC or SOFAST-HMQC spectra at the
intermediate temperature (298 K – Tassign)/2 and at 298 K.
3. DSS-reference your spectra in both 1H and 15N dimensions
(or apply a 10.5 ppb/K shift if you center the water signal at
4.7 ppm). Then, apply a temperature correction of 7.5 ppb/
K in the proton dimension and 6.5 ppb/K in the nitrogen
dimension—do no forget that γ(15N) is negative. This will
account for the average temperature shifts of random coil
amino acids [28] and make tracking of peaks easier.
802
Manon Julien et al.

4. Assign crosspeaks at 298 K by tracing lines through every set of
three resonances across the temperature range (see Fig. 3).
5. Apply the same logic for shifting pH progressively from
pHassign to pHphosphorylation. Record 2D 1H-15N HSQC or
SOFAST-HMQC spectra at 3 pH values, DSS-reference your
spectra (or apply a 20 ppb/pH unit correction if you center the
water peak at 4.7 ppm). In the range of the pH values consid-
ered here, that is, pH ~6.5–7.5, crosspeak frequencies should
not shift signiﬁcantly except histidine residues and their close
neighbors.

at the same contour level. A number of crosspeaks fade away at higher
temperature. This is typical of IDPs NMR spectra. The spectra were acquired
at pH 7.0 and 700 MHz

3.4
Phosphorylation
Monitoring by NMR
A number of IDPs provide poor S/N at pH 7 or higher due to their
high content in hydrophilic amino acids that show fast water:amide
proton exchange (Gly, His, Lys, Arg, Ser, Thr). Continuous read-
out at 298 K can thus be greatly hampered by the absence of reliable
reporter crosspeaks. In such situations, it may be more adapted to
perform the phosphorylation reaction on the bench, to remove
aliquots and quench the reaction at regular intervals, and to record
NMR spectra of these aliquots later. This “quenched reactions”
strategy has an advantage: low pH and large NMR acquisition times
can be used to enhance S/N and resolution. However, the limited
number of time points can hinder the robust ﬁtting and interpreta-
tion of phosphorylation kinetics.
In the following, we describe protocols for the continuous
readout NMR approach (Subheading 3.4.1) and for the discontin-
uous “quench reaction” approach (Subheading 3.4.2). To choose
between these two strategies, you must evaluate the quality of the
2D 1H-15N SOFAST-HMQC spectra recorded at pHphosphorylation
and 298 K (see Subheading 3.3). If a number of reporter crosspeaks
provide S/N ratios above 10, the continuous readout is probably
feasible. S/N will depend of course on the IDP concentration and
the tube diameter/volume.
3.4.1
Phosphorylation
Monitoring Using
Continuous NMR Readout
1. Deﬁne the ﬁnal volume of your sample. This ranges from 90 to
475 μL depending on the NMR tube you want to use (see
Subheading 2.3, item 4). Pipetting losses are difﬁcult to
avoid, so start with initial volumes 10–20% higher than the
measured ones.
2. Calculate the amount of kinase to add according to Subheading
3.2, that is, the amount leading to measurable levels of phos-
phorylation within 2–5 h. The reaction should not be too fast
because the NMR timeframe is in the order of magnitude of
15–30 min in the described phosphorylation conditions. If you
skipped Subheading 3.2 and did not test the kinase activity, you
may try an IDP concentration of 50 μM, and a kinase:IDP
molar ratio of 1:2500 for an activated kinase, or 1:250 for a
non-activated kinase.
3. Prepare the pre-phospho mix containing the IDP at 50 μM in
Phos-B, supplemented with 3% D2O and 50 μM DSS. Check
the pH at room temperature using a micro-pH meter and
adjust it to 7.0 if necessary.
4. Transfer the pre-phospho mix into the NMR tube, insert the
tube in an appropriate spinner and then into the NMR spec-
trometer equilibrated at 283 K.
5. Tune and match the 1H circuit of the probehead, lock the
HOD signal, and shim the sample tube. Determine the 1H
90 pulse.
804
Manon Julien et al.

6. Record 283 K reference 1D 1H spectra and 2D 1H-15N 2D
SOFAST-HMQC spectra using an FID resolution of ~15 Hz in
both 1H and 15N dimensions. This step is recommended to
check the quality of your sample (pH control, ATP/ADP con-
centrations, IDP degradation) and serves to measure IDP ref-
erence peak intensities. The acquisition time of the 2D
spectrum should be between 30 min and 2 h. Ideally, the
S/N of peaks of interest should be 20:1 or more for an accurate
quantiﬁcation of later phosphorylation advancement.
7. Equilibrate the spectrometer sample temperature at 298 K and
re-perform wobbling, shimming, and pulse calibration.
8. Record a 298 K reference 1D 1H-spectrum, record two 2D
1H-15N SOFAST-HMQC reference spectra using FID resolu-
tions of 15 Hz in 1H dimension, and (a) 15 Hz and (b) 30 Hz
in 15N dimension. The ﬁnal acquisition times of the 2D spectra
should be about 15 or 30 min. Evaluate the quality of these
spectra, try different apodization functions, and pick the para-
meters that provide the best compromise between resolution
and S/N. These will be used for time-resolved NMR monitor-
ing of the phosphorylation reaction.
9. Extract the sample from the tube and add the kinase in quan-
tities deﬁned in Subheading 3.4.1, step 2. Mix well by pipet-
ting and load the phosphorylation sample into the same
NMR tube.
10. Insert the sample in the magnet, wait for 1 min for temperature
equilibration, lock, and shim. Tuning, matching, and pulse
calibration should not change after the addition of the kinase,
unless the kinase stock is very diluted in a very peculiar buffer.
11. Record a 1D 1H-spectrum at 298 K and, then, a series of
1H-15N 2D SOFAST-HMQC spectra over 4–12 h, using the
parameters deﬁned in Subheading 3.4, step 8.
12. At the end of the series, shim again and record a 1D 1H
spectrum to evaluate the ADP/ATP ratio (see Note 9).
13. Take back the sample from the tube. At this stage, phosphory-
lation should not progress signiﬁcantly because of the progres-
sive loss of kinase activity. In the case of a heat-resistant IDP, to
deﬁnitely stop any enzymatic activity, boil the sample at 90 C
for 5 min, centrifuge 5 min at 16,000  g, and recover the
supernatant. Avoid boiling IDPs containing Asn-Gly motifs
that may suffer from deamidation. You can alternatively spike
EDTA or CyDTA at a ﬁnal concentration of 15 mM to chelate
Mg2+ ions, which will not prevent potential interactions
between the IDP and the kinase and their consequences on
IDPs NMR peak intensities.

14. Measure pH and adjust it to the initial value if necessary. ATP,
DTT, and PI hydrolysis usually acidify the solution.
15. Fill the NMR tube with the pH-readjusted sample. Insert it in
the magnet, set the sample temperature to 283 K, tune/match,
lock, and shim. Record 1D 1H spectrum and a 2D SOFAST-
HMQC spectra at 283 K using the same parameters than in
Subheading 3.4, step 6. These spectra constitute the endpoint
references.
3.4.2
Phosphorylation
Monitoring Using Quenched
Reactions
1. Quenching can be performed using heat inactivation or urea
denaturation. Verify that the studied IDP is resistant to 5 min
heating at 90 C. Test it on an aliquot at the concentration and
in the buffer conditions used for the phosphorylation reaction.
After 5 min, centrifuge 5 min at 16,000  g, separate the
supernatant and the eventual aggregated material and analyze
it using SDS-PAGE and NMR. Pay particular attention to the
NMR crosspeaks of Asn and Gln, whose decreased intensities
may reveal deamidation occurring upon heating.
2. If your protein is not heat resistant, you can quench the phos-
phorylation reaction by adding phosphorylation reaction
buffer supplemented with 10 M urea buffer to the aliquots.
The ﬁnal urea concentration should be over 4 M. This will
require a novel NMR assignment at the ﬁnal urea concentra-
tion, which can be performed using a urea gradient with the
same logic than for temperature in Subheading 3.3. Record-
ing 2D 1H-15N SOFAST-HMQC experiments of IDPs in urea
at pH 7 and 283 K provides high quality spectra: IDPs do not
adopt any “molten globule” behaviors in these conditions, and
urea slows down water-amide proton exchange; hence, favor-
able relaxation effects generate spectra exploitable for residue-
speciﬁc analysis.
3. Deﬁne the experimental time points (i.e., the number of
quenched aliquots) you want to have, and the ﬁnal volume
and
concentration
of
the
measured
samples.
The
corresponding aliquots can be diluted after being quenched.
Such dilution permits a better control of the later pH
adjustment.
4. Calculate the amount of kinase to add according to Subheading
3.2 and the time frame you choose. If you skipped Subheading
3.2 and did not test the kinase activity, you may try an IDP
concentration of 50 μM, a total reaction time of 5 h, and a
kinase:IDP molar ratio of 1:2500 for an activated kinase, or
1:250 for a non-activated kinase.
5. Prepare the pre-phospho mix containing the IDP at 50 μM in
Phos-B supplemented with 3% D2O and 50 μM DSS. Check
806
Manon Julien et al.

the pH at room temperature using a micro-pH meter and
adjust it to pHphosphorylation if necessary.
6. Remove an aliquot and heat it 5 min at 90 C or dilute it in a
urea buffer, according to Subheading 3.4.2 step 1. Then, ﬂash-
freeze the samples and keep them at 80 C.
7. Add the kinase in quantities deﬁned in Subheading 3.4.2 step
4. Mix well and place it at 298 K in a dry bath.
8. Remove aliquots at the deﬁned time points, and heat them
5 min at 90 C or dilute them in a urea buffer. Then, ﬂash-
freeze the samples and keep them at 80 C.
9. After thawing the samples, centrifuge the samples 5 min at
16,000  g if you heated them. Take the supernatant and
complete with the volume of phosphorylation buffer PhosB
to reach the ﬁnal volume that will be measured by NMR.
10. Adjust the pH to 6.5. Flash freeze the aliquots that you will not
measure in the next hours; keep the other ones on ice.
11. Transfer the sample into the NMR tube, insert the tube in an
appropriate spinner and then into the NMR spectrometer
equilibrated at 283 K.
12. Tune and match the 1H circuit of the probehead, lock the
HOD signal, and shim the sample tube. Determine the 1H
90 pulse.
13. Record 283 K spectra of every aliquot: a 1D 1H-spectrum and a
1H-15N 2D SOFAST-HMQC spectrum using an FID resolu-
tion of ~15 Hz in both 1H and 15N dimensions. 1D 1H-spectra
are useful to compare the eventual differences of IDP concen-
tration in the aliquots. They should thus be recorded with a
high S/N. They also permit to check the pH and the
ATP/ADP concentrations. The acquisition time of the 2D
spectrum should be between 30 min and 2 h. Ideally, the
S/N of peaks of interest should be 20:1 or more for an accurate
quantiﬁcation of the phosphorylation advancement.
3.5
Analysis
of NMR Data
Although a novel assignment of the phosphorylated IDP spectra is
not always necessary (see Note 10), it can be very useful in the case
where too many phosphosites generate a large number of spectral
changes. We will not detail the assignment method relying on the
prior phosphorylation of a 13C-15N labeled IDP and the use of
3-dimensional pulse sequences to establish sequential connections
(see Subheading 3.3). A single 3D HNCACB spectrum is often
sufﬁcient to assign the phosphorylated population. We will not
elaborate extensively on curve ﬁtting: because of the progressive
kinase loss of activity, the potential IDP degradation, or the com-
petition between phosphosites, ﬁtting models may often become
too complicate to provide consistent ﬁtted values. In most cases, it

is safer to only consider the order of phosphorylation events and
their initial rates. Crosspeaks whose intensities vary during the
phosphorylation reaction reveal phosphorylation advancement,
and will be called “reporters.” In the following, we describe how
to monitor and quantify the reaction advancement in a residue-
speciﬁc fashion. We will name “non-phosphopeaks” all crosspeaks
found in the reference spectra before phosphorylation, and “phos-
phopeaks” those appearing in spectra upon phosphorylation.
1. Fourier transform the spectra recorded at 283 K before and
after the phosphorylation reaction (see Subheading 3.4.1 steps
6 and 15 or Subheading 3.4.2 step 13) using Topspin or any
equivalent NMR-data processing software. Process these data
with an adapted apodization function, and perform baseline
corrections if necessary. The 2D SOFAST-HMQC pulse
sequence often generates distorted baselines in the 15N-dimen-
sion, which alters absolute peak intensities.
2. Load these 2D 283 K-spectra in an NMR data analysis software
(i.e., Ccpnmr or Sparky). Measure intensities of every isolated
peak in the reference spectrum (Iref) and after the phosphory-
lation reaction (Iﬁnal).
3. Identify the peaks that faded. Because the corresponding resi-
dues are either phosphorylated or close to phosphorylated
residues, these peaks permit identiﬁcation of the residues or
the segments where phosphorylation reactions occurred. The
intensity ratios Iﬁnal/Iref of these peaks reveal the ﬁnal degrees
of advancement of these reactions.
4. If you used the “continuous readout approach,” Fourier trans-
form the spectra recorded at 298 K during the phosphorylation
reaction and apply baseline corrections if necessary (see Sub-
heading 3.5, step 1). Load these 298 K-spectra in an NMR
data analysis software.
5. Measure intensities of every isolated peak in every spectrum,
including novel peaks appearing upon phosphorylation. Pay
attention to eventual peak displacements due to pH shifts in
the time series (see Note 11).
6. Plot the evolution curves of every peak using a plot/ﬁt software
(Kaleidagraph, Prism, Gnuplot, ...). If you used the “continu-
ous readout approach,” set the time of the ﬁrst spectrum
to (tset-up + tacq-spectrum/2), and the later time points to
(tset-up + tacq-spectrum  (n  1/2)). tset-up should be about
5 min. Decay of connected non-phosphopeaks, either of phos-
phosites or of neighboring residues, should show similar
trends.
7. Pay attention to the fact that a given residue can sense more
than one phosphorylation reaction, and the decay of its
808
Manon Julien et al.

non-phosphopeak may report on more than one phosphoryla-
tion event in its vicinity. Such a situation can be recognized by
the appearance of more phosphopeaks than there were
non-phosphopeaks.
8. After identifying non-phosphopeaks that report the same phos-
phorylation reaction, add their individual peak intensities at
every timepoint (Fig. 1c). This will increase the S/N of the
phosphorylation build-up curves. For every phosphorylation
site, evaluate the total intensity It¼0 at time ¼ 0 according to
the initial slopes of the decay curves. Plot the phosphorylation
build-up curve %phospho(t) ¼ 1  I(t)/It¼0.
9. You
may
try
to
assign
the
phosphopeaks.
The
peaks
corresponding to phosphorylated residues should shift down-
ﬁeld according to the published reference chemical shifts; the
neighboring residues should show weaker peak displacements
and remain close to the non-phosphopeaks. In both cases, peak
intensities of phospho- and non-phospho-populations evolve
in a complementary fashion.
10. If no reliable non-phosphopeak reporter can be isolated in the
298 K-spectra, plot the intensities of the assigned phospho-
peaks. Evaluate their intensity Iendpoint at the end of the time
series, according to the last 298 K-spectra (Fig. 1c). Normalize
their build-up curve according to the ratio Iﬁnal/Iref of
non-phosphopeaks measured at 283 K.
11. You can also add build-up curves from related phosphopeak
and non-phosphopeaks to increase S/N. Perform it before
intensity normalization and normalize the ﬁnal build-up
curves. Depending on the shape of the build-up curves, there
are four possible scenarios:
12. If the curve looks like a mono-exponential (Fig. 4a), ﬁt it using
%phospho(t) ¼ %phosphot ¼ 1(1  exp( Rphos  t)).
13. If the initial IDP concentration is above the Km of a phospho-
site, the corresponding decay curve may look more linear than
exponential (Fig. 4b); in this case, ﬁt it using %phospho(t) ¼ %
phosphot¼1(1  (ln(1 + (eK  1)  exp(Rphos  t)))/K),
with K ¼ [IDP]/Km.
14. If the curve has an S shape, it may reveal a conditional phos-
phosite P2 that requires a prior phosphorylation of a
neighboring site P1 (Fig. 4c), which may be ﬁtted using
%phosphoP2(t)

 RphosP2  exp(RphosP1  t)]/[RphosP1  RphosP2]. In
such situation, a set of two P1 phosphopeaks should appear,
corresponding to P1-noP2 and P1-P2. You can ﬁt %phos-
phoP1-noP2(t)
¼
RphosP1/[RphosP1

15. An S shape can also reveal the late phosphorylation of a poor Km,
slow phosphosite Pslow after the early phosphorylation of a
faster site, Pfast (Fig. 4d). This situation does not provoke
necessarily the apparition of multiple peaks like in 14. Such

much attention to the individual values obtained upon ﬁtting,
but consider only the initial rates calculated from ﬁtted para-
meters (see Note 12).

Notes
1. The lowest IDP concentration to obtain sufﬁcient S/N is
about 12.5 μM in most cases. Phosphorylation monitoring by
NMR is, however, often performed at much higher concentra-
tions in the literature, sometimes at several hundreds of micro-
molar. Importantly, at high IDP concentrations, kinases are
likely to steadily phosphorylate non-speciﬁc sites with very
high Km. NMR concentrations may thus generate questionable
results if this aspect is neglected. Kms of kinases for their
cognate targets span a wide range of values, from 1 to
100 μM, while kcat values can vary between 0.01 and 100 s1
(we did not ﬁnd an article providing statistics; these are num-
bers based on long-term experience; you can try https://www.
brenda-enzymes.org/). We highly recommend to measure
kinetics at a given concentration and at either half or twice
this concentration. The measured initial rates (in mol/s) will
reveal whether the used concentrations are below or above the
Km of every detected phosphosite, and whether some sites
emerge only because of high concentrations. There are three
possibilities: (a) if the molar phosphorylation rate is propor-
tional to the substrate concentration, we are well below the
phosphosite Km, which may be odd at concentrations above
100 μM, for example; (b) if it is the same at both concentra-
tions, we are an order of magnitude above the Km, which may
call for running the phosphorylation reaction at lower concen-
tration; (c) intermediate situations mean that we are at a con-
centration in the order of magnitude of the Km. Of course, it is
ideally preferable to determine kcat and Km more precisely by
measuring initial rates at multiple concentrations following the
Michaelis-Menten approach.
2. Cysteine reduction can usually be obtained by supplementing
the lysis buffer with 10 mM DTT (ﬁnal concentration), and by
spiking 5 mM DTT (ﬁnal concentration) in protein samples
after every puriﬁcation step. Avoid β-mercaptoethanol: it is a
poor reducing agent and it easily forms mixed disulﬁdes with
cysteines. TCEP is advantageous in many regards, but its noto-
rious stability is affected by the presence of phosphate and
EGTA [24, 31], it requires pH adjustment after solubilization,
and it may cleave progressively the protein backbone near
cysteines [32].
3. IDPs are generally very well expressed in E. coli strains opti-
mized for protein production. Bacteria are grown in minimum
media containing 15NH4Cl and 13C-glucose as sole sources
of nitrogen and carbon, respectively. Recipes can be found
at https://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/protein_

expression/ecoli/n15/ or in [29]. IDPs can sometimes be
obtained in inclusion bodies: in such situation, they can be
ﬁrst puriﬁed in urea using a Histidine tag, before being trans-
ferred in a non-denaturant buffer using SEC.
4. High buffering capacity is important because ATP and DTT
hydrolysis release protons and can provoke deleterious pH
variations. A careful control of the pH is indeed essential to
generate NMR data of high quality: crosspeak intensities of
IDPs amide functions can vary up to ~10% for a pH shift of
0.1 at pH 7 and 298 K (This is due to the pH-dependency of
water/amide proton exchange [37], hence to the residence
time of the detected amide protons). Because we calculate
phospho and non-phospho populations based on NMR cross-
peak intensities, pH variations can thus bias this quantiﬁcation.
5. Recombinant expression in insect or mammalian cells may
produce prephosphorylated protein samples. This may be
detected using the Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Gel
Stain kit, Phos-Tag SDS-PAGE [30], Mass Spectrometry, or
Western blot with an antibody directed against phosphoSer/
Thr. It can also be detected using 2D 1H-15N NMR spectros-
copy, given the recognizable chemical shifts adopted by phos-
phoSer/Thr residues [16, 21]. Tyrosine phosphorylation can
be nailed using 1H-13C NMR spectroscopy because of the Cε
chemical shifts perturbation [21]. If prephosphorylation is
ascertained, a phosphatase treatment may be carried out during
the puriﬁcation.
6. Adding 10% glycerol to the reaction mix often improves S/N
and decreases the pH-dependency of NMR crosspeak intensi-
ties. It provokes chemical shift perturbations, which may be
large enough to force a supplementary assignment step. This
can be carried out similarly to what has been described for
temperature-dependent assignment in Subheading 3.3.
7. Kinases achieve substrate speciﬁcity in many ways [33]. Several
servers exist predicting phosphorylation sites and their asso-
ciated kinases. They rely mostly on kinase consensus site analy-
sis, reported detection, and existing annotation or interaction
networks in databases [34, 35]. An extensive list of methods is
available in [36]. A simple consensus site analysis can be
obtained using http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/.
Lists of detected phosphorylation sites are available on
https://www.phosphosite.org/.
8. Monitoring IDP phosphorylation in cell extracts is a challeng-
ing task. Which cell line? Which lysis conditions? In exponential
growth phase, or after cell-cycle arrest and at which stage?
Whole cell extract or separation of speciﬁc cell compartment?
These parameters will generate very different extracts with
812
Manon Julien et al.

highly variable phosphorylation activities. For this reason, we
thought it was difﬁcult to provide a generic protocol, and we
prefer to refer to guidelines published previously [17]. Produc-
ing active extracts requires fast manipulation of the cellular
material. Lysis buffers should of course be non-denaturing
and contain large concentrations of protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. ATP hydrolysis is usually intense because of the
combined activity of several cellular kinases. Extract concentra-
tion should be high (1–10 mg/mL). The experimental time-
frame is usually about 1 h, although it can be difﬁcult to
establish: early phosphorylation can be rapidly compensated
by dephosphorylation activity of cellular phosphatases, which
often take over anyway after ATP exhaustion. We ﬁnally warn
the reader that interpretation of phosphorylation kinetics in
cell extracts should be cautious: native cellular organization
and colocalization is essential in cell signaling, and is lost in
cell extracts; the IDP of interest may interact with enzymes that
it would not meet in a real cell, and kinase or phosphatase
activity regulation may quickly degenerate.
9. Kinases afﬁnity for ATP is in the range of 10–100 μM, and up
to the millimolar range in a minority of cases [38]. Afﬁnity for
ADP is in the same range and very well correlated to that of
ATP [38]. Hence, a large excess of ATP is recommended for
monitoring phosphorylation reactions in vitro to avoid strong
inhibition by growing concentrations of ADP. Moreover, we
observed in most cases that kinases hydrolyze more ATP mole-
cules than they transfer phosphate moieties to their substrate.
We recommend to measure 1D 1H spectra before and after the
reaction to evaluate the ratio ATP/ADP (Fig. 5), which may
help in interpreting the progressive loss of kinase activity.
10. The most prominent chemical shift changes occur for phos-
phorylated residues. Their crosspeaks show strong downﬁeld-
shifts in 1H-15N 2D spectra upon phosphorylation: due to a
hydrogen bond between the new side-chain phosphate and the
backbone amide function, their
1H resonances move to
8.5–9.5 ppm, which is out of the regular spectral window
(7.5–8.5 ppm) for disordered peptides [16, 21]. However,
the corresponding peaks move upﬁeld when pH acidiﬁes, and
their absolute intensities are also pH dependent. In surprising
cases, crosspeaks in this “phospho-region” of 8.5–9.5 ppm can
reveal a H-bond between the side-chain phosphate of a phos-
phorylated
residue
and
the
amide
proton
of
a
non-phosphorylated residue [39]. 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical
shifts provide unambiguous information on the nature of
these 1H-15N crosspeaks (phosphoSer/Thr, or neighboring
non-modiﬁed residue establishing a H-bond with a phos-
phate). Recording a 3D HNCACB spectrum is thus often of
IDP Phosphorylation Monitored by NMR
813

good help in the analysis of the NMR data, which requires a
13C/15N-labeled IDP.
11. Because phosphoSer and phosphoThr have pKa values of about
6 and 6.5, respectively [21, 40], their protonation state varies
with the potential pH evolution during the phosphorylation
reaction, as evoked in Note 3. This provokes chemical shift
perturbations of the phosphorylated residues and of their
neighbors. Hence, it is important to verify that intensities are
measured at the peak centers in every spectrum.
12. Complex mechanisms emerging from multiple phosphoryla-
tion sites can take place. Assigning all peaks when multiple
neighbor phosphosites evolve concomitantly can be tedious.
Fitting evolution curves in such situations, or in the case of
large Km differences between phosphosites, is always possible.
Equations that can be used to ﬁt complex phosphorylation
schemes have been described extensively earlier [17]. However,
the ﬁtted parameters should be used cautiously: little differ-
ences in the range of the S/N (and thus inside the error bars)

for a couple of early points can provoke large differences in the
ﬁtted values; moreover, the progressive loss of kinase activity
during the hours-long reaction is very difﬁcult to evaluate.
Hence, we argue that one should limit the interpretation of
the recorded kinetics to (a) the ranking between phosphoryla-
tion sites and (b) the initial rates of phosphorylation.

Detection of Multisite Phosphorylation of Intrinsically
Disordered Proteins Using Quantitative Mass-Spectrometry
Ervin Valk, Artemi Maljavin, and Mart Loog
Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within proteins have
attracted considerable attention in recent years. Several important biological signaling mechanisms includ-
ing protein-protein interactions and post-translational modiﬁcations can be easily mediated by IDPs and
IDRs due to their ﬂexible structure. These regions can encode linear sequences that are indispensable in
cell-signaling networks and circuits. For example, the linear multisite phosphorylation networks encoded in
disordered protein sequences play a key role in cell-cycle regulation where the phosphorylation of proteins
controls the orchestration of all major mechanisms. While elucidating a systems-level understanding of this
process and other multisite phosphorylation processes, we extensively used mass-spectrometry and found it
to be an ideal tool to identify, characterize, and quantify phosphorylation dynamics within IDPs. Here, we
describe a quantitative proteomics method, together with a detailed protocol to analyze dynamic multisite
phosphorylation processes within IDPs using an in vitro protein phosphorylation assay with “light”
gamma-16O ATP and “heavy” gamma-18O ATP, combined with liquid chromatography
mass
spectrometry.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are proteins that lack a
folded three-dimensional structure. Additionally, structured pro-
teins with stable secondary structures may also contain disordered
sequences—known as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)
[1]. The disorder makes these regions more accessible for binding
pockets of structured domains in signaling proteins and modifying
enzymes. This property makes them important mediators of pro-
tein-protein
interactions,
and
also
ideal

translational modiﬁcations. IDPs and IDRs are typically rich in
phosphorylation sites and docking motives, which, in combination
with the conformational ﬂexibility, offer many opportunities to
mediate information ﬂow through eukaryotic protein-protein
interaction networks [2]. For eukaryotic signaling, high speciﬁcity
with modest afﬁnity is required for precise signal transduction.
IDPs and IDRs can make these interactions possible with a smaller
number of amino acids than structured proteins, which require a
much larger surface for the same task [3].
One of the most studied model systems of multisite phosphor-
ylation in IDPs is the regulation of cell-cycle progression by cyclin/
cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes in eukaryotes. At differ-
ent phases of the cell cycle, the Cdks associate with speciﬁc cyclins
and so orchestrate cellular events via multisite phosphorylation of
disordered regions in CDK targets or entirely disordered cell-cycle
regulators [4, 5]. These targets contain intricate linear patterns of
multiple phosphorylation sites and cyclin docking motives. Com-
bining those elements and different cyclins, Cdks can phosphory-
late targets with high temporal order and precision at different cell-
cycle phases [6, 7].
To understand how these complex interactions integrate and
transfer phosphorylation signals, both in terms of speciﬁcity and
temporal dynamics, it was necessary to identify the phosphorylation
sites on individual substrates and quantitatively describe the kinetics
of these processes. This is especially important when studying IDPs
and IDRs where multisite phosphorylation and binding motifs
synergistically deﬁne the signaling response [8]. Developments in
mass spectrometry have revolutionized the ﬁeld by providing fast,
precise, quantitative, and sensitive identiﬁcation of phosphoryla-
tion sites. Mapping of phosphorylation sites includes protein diges-
tion with a deﬁned protease to produce peptides that will be
subsequently analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry and computer
algorithms to identify peptides and information about the position
of the phosphorylation site within the peptide [9]. To follow phos-
phorylation dynamics, one requires quantitative MS data. The most
widely known quantitative methods involve the use of stable isotope
tags (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture
[SILAC], Isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute Quantiﬁcation
[iTRAQ], and Tandem Mass Tags [TMTs]) and provide relative
quantiﬁcation. Peptides that differ only with respect to the isotopic
composition, elute together in the liquid chromatography, enter
the mass spectrometer at the same time and have identical ioniza-
tion efﬁciencies. The distinct masses of differentially labeled pep-
tides can therefore be observed simultaneously in the mass
spectrometer. To obtain the best mapping results, one should com-
bine data obtained from mass spectrometry and site-directed muta-
genesis applied in kinase assays and cell biology approaches [10].
In this chapter, we describe an in vitro stable isotope labeling
approach (Fig. 1) that can be used to analyze the multisite

phosphorylation dynamics of disordered proteins. The method
uses “light ATP” and “heavy ATP” in kinase assays and enables
one to separate, analyze, and quantify phosphopeptides using a 1:1
isotope-labeled mixture of kinase assays [11]. This method is
non-radioactive and samples can be safely handled without the
special precautions required when working with gamma-32P ATP.

and the second with gamma-18O-ATP (Fig. 2).
2. For 20 μL of kinase reaction: pipette 2 μL of 10 kinase buffer,
add the required amount of water, and add 0.5 μL of gam-
ma-16O-ATP or 0.5 μL of gamma-18O-ATP, respectively, add
the cyclin-Cdk1-Cks1 kinase complex (ﬁnal concentration

5 μM).
3. Prepare control reactions as described above and supplement
with 1 μCi gamma-32P-ATP (work behind plexiglass shield).
4. Incubate the kinase reactions and stop them at the appropriate
time (see Note 10) by adding 6 protein loading buffer (ﬁnal
concentration around 1).
3.2
SDS
Polyacrylamide Gel
Electrophoresis
1. Assemble the gel sandwich and place a comb into it. Mark a
place on the glass plate about 1 cm below the teeth of the
comb. This marks the level to which the separating gel is
poured.
2. The resolving gel is prepared by adding 2 mL of water, 1.70 mL
of 30% (w/v) acrylamide, 1.30 mL of resolving buffer, 50 μL of
SDS, 50 μL of ammonium persulfate, and 2 μL of TEMED into
a 15 mL conical tube followed by gentle mixing to avoid air
bubbles (see Note 11).
3. Remove the comb from the gel sandwich. Using a pipette, pour
the solution to the mark and immediately overlay with water or
water-saturated n-butanol.
4. Allow the gel to polymerize for 45–60 min. The gel is poly-
merized once you see a line form between the water and the
resolving gel. Pour off the overlay solution and rinse the top of
the gel with water.
5. Dry the area above the separating gel with ﬁlter paper before
pouring the stacking gel.
6. The stacking gel is prepared by adding 1.40 mL of water,
330 μL of 30% (w/v) acrylamide, 250 μL of stacking buffer,
20 μL of SDS, 50 μL of ammonium persulfate, and 2 μL of

Fig. 2 Quantitative analysis of phosphorylation sites in Sld2. (a) Sld2 contains 11 Cdk1 phosphorylation sites
(ﬁve optimal and six suboptimal). For cell cycle progression, Thr84 is essential and it is shown that
phosphorylation of the site is required for proper Dbp11 binding and DNA replication. The phosphorylation
of other sites increases the ability of Cdk1 to phosphorylate T84 [16]. To prevent premature DNA replication,
site T84 has to be speciﬁcally phosphorylated by the Clb5/Cdk1 complex but not by the G1-phase cyclin/Cdk1
complex (Cln2/Cdk1). (b) In vitro kinase assay with gamma-32P-ATP between Sld2 and Cln2/Cdk1 or Clb5/
Cdk1 indicates that Sld2 protein is highly speciﬁc substrate for S-phase cyclin/Cdk1 complex (Clb5/Cdk1).
Unfortunately, this highly sensitive method does not provide information about stoichiometry of the phosphor-
ylation of individual sites. (c) gamma-16O-ATP and gamma-18O-ATP were used in kinase assays for
quantitative phosphorylation site analysis in Sld2. Sld2 was phosphorylated by Cln2/Cdk1 and Clb5/Cdk1 in
a parallel kinase reaction which was stopped at speciﬁc time points and mixed in ratio of 1:1. Control reactions
were supplemented with gamma-32P-ATP and analyzed by autoradiography. Samples were separated on
SDS-PAGE and Sld2 bands were digested in-gel with trypsin. Peptides were puriﬁed on C18 StageTips and
analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The relative abundance of “light” and “heavy” peptide peaks were used for
quantiﬁcation

9. Remove the comb by pulling it straight up slowly and gently.
Rinse the wells completely with water.
10. Assemble the electrophoresis apparatus, load the samples, and
run the gel at 15 mA (two gels run at 30 mA) in 1 SDS-PAGE
running buffer. NB! Run radioactive samples on separate gel
behind plexiglass shield and follow all the regulations for the
use of radioactivity.
3.3
Coomassie Blue
G-250 Staining
1. Following electrophoresis, carefully remove the gel from the
glass plates and incubate the well-covered gel with the ﬁxation
solution while agitating on an orbital shaker for 20–30 min (see
Note 12).
2. Rinse the gel brieﬂy with water and incubate the well-covered
gel with the staining solution while agitating on an orbital
shaker for 1 h to overnight (see Note 13).
3. Remove the staining solution and brieﬂy rinse the gel with
water. De-stain the gel with water by shaking for 1–2 h and
changing the water 4–5 times.
3.4
Autoradiography
1. After electrophoresis, stain the gel as in Subheading 3.3.
2. Moisten four layers of ﬁlter paper with water, place the gel on
the paper, and cover with cellophane plastic wrap.
3. Place the ﬁlter paper, gel, and cellophane plastic wrap into gel
dryer. Turn on the heating (up to 80 C) and vacuum. Dry the
gel for 60 min.
4. Insert the dried gel to a cassette and expose to a storage
phosphor screen. Sufﬁcient exposure time is around 1–24 h.
5. Detect the autoradiography signals using phosphoimager.
3.5
In-Gel Digestion
of Proteins
1. Rinse the entire gel with water for a few hours and then lay it on
a glass or plastic tray (see Note 14).
2. Excise the protein bands of interest with a clean scalpel. Cut the
excised bands into cubes (ca. 1  1 mm) and place these gel
pieces into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf Protein LoBind tube. Spin
down on a bench-top microcentrifuge (see Note 15).
3. Add 100–150 μL of 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile:100 mM ammonium
bicarbonate and incubate on a shaker for 30 min to de-stain the
gel pieces (see Note 16).
4. Add 500–1000 μL of acetonitrile and incubate until the gel
pieces become white and stick together. Spin the gel pieces
down and remove all liquid.
5. Add 30–50 μL of the DTT solution to completely cover gel
pieces. Incubate for 30 min at 56 C. Chill down the tubes to
room temperature.
826
Ervin Valk et al.

6. Add 500–1000 μL of acetonitrile, incubate for 10 min, and
remove all liquid.
7. Add 30–50 μL of iodoacetamide solution and incubate for
20 min in the dark.
8. Add 500–1000 μL of acetonitrile, incubate for 10 min, and
remove all liquid (see Note 17).
9. Add trypsin to cover the dry gel pieces (50 μL typically) and
leave the gel pieces on ice. After 30 min, if the gel pieces are not
covered, add more trypsin and leave the gel pieces on ice for
another 90 min (see Note 18).
10. If gel pieces are not covered, add more ammonium bicarbonate
buffer to cover the gel pieces completely and incubate at 37 C
overnight.
11. Put the samples into an ultrasonic water bath for 10 min at
35 W power.
12. Add 100–200 μL of extraction buffer and incubate for 15 min
at 37 C on a shaker.
13. Collect the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf Protein
LoBind tube (see Note 19) and reduce the volume in the
SpeedVac to about 25% of the starting volume to remove
acetonitrile.
14. Add 1/10 of 5% (v/v) TFA and purify the peptides on a
StageTip.
3.6
Sample Clean-Up
on StageTips
1. For a StageTip adaptor, take a 1.5 or 2.0 mL centrifuge tube
with lid. Use a pair of scissors or tweezers to make a hole in the
middle of the lid. The size of the hole depends on the type of
pipette tips.
2. Pipette 20 μL of methanol into the StageTip and centrifuge
at 300  g for 20–60 s on a bench-top microcentrifuge (see
Note 20).
3. Add 20 μL of Buffer B and centrifuge at 300  g for 20–60 s.
It is best to leave ~1 μL of buffer on top of the C18 disk to
avoid it drying out (see Note 21).
4. Add 20 μL of Buffer A and centrifuge at 300  g for 20–60 s.
The tips are now conditioned and ready for sample binding.
5. Dilute your sample in 300 μL of Buffer A and load into the
StageTip and centrifuge at 300  g until all of the sample has
left the tip. Remove all of the liquid from the adapters to avoid
contamination (see Note 22).
6. Add 20–100 μL of Buffer A and centrifuge at 300  g for
20–60 s (see Note 23).
7. Elute the peptides into a 0.5 mL Eppendorf Protein LoBind
tube by adding 10–20 μL of elution buffer twice, each time

LC-MS/MS
Analyses
Peptides were separated by reversed-phase chromatography using
an Agilent 1200 series nano-ﬂow system connected to LTQ Orbi-
trap classic mass-spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray
ion source. C18-StageTip puriﬁed peptides were loaded on a fused
silica emitter (75 μm  150 mm). The injection volume was 5 μL
and the ﬂow rate for peptide separation 200 nL/min. The mobile
phase consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water (A) and 0.1%
(v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (B). A linear gradient from 2% of B
to 40% of B in 30 min was used after loading sample in 2% B at
ﬂowrate 700 nL/min for 20 min. Eluted peptides were sprayed
directly into an LTQ Orbitrap classic mass-spectrometer operated
at a spray voltage of 2.4 kV. The MS scan range was m/z 300–1800
measured in the Orbitrap and top ﬁve precursor ions were selected
for subsequent MS/MS scan in the ion trap (CID normalized
collision energy 35). In case the neutral loss corresponding to
phosphate group (neutral loss mass list 24.49423, 32.65897,
48.98845) was detected, the consequent MultiStageActivation
(MSA) fragmentation procedure of precursor ion was conducted.
Two lock-masses (m/z 445.120025 and 519.138820) were used
for the LTQ-Orbitrap classic to obtain constant mass-accuracy
during the gradient analysis.

ﬁles using MassMatrix File Conversion Tools v3.9. .mgf ﬁles were
searched with the Mascot 2.5.1 search engine against a FASTA
database containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sld2 protein sequence
and common contaminant proteins, such as trypsin and keratins.
Search parameters were 7 ppm for precursor mass tolerance, 0.6 Da
for ion-trap MS/MS mass tolerance, trypsin/P speciﬁcity allowing
for up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine
was set as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation, and the oxidation of the methio-
nines and the phosphorylation of serine, threonine were set as
variable modiﬁcations. For quantiﬁcation, precursor ions were
extracted manually form corresponding .RAW ﬁles based on Mas-
cot search and the intensities (the peaks heights) of “light” and
“heavy” precursor ions at the same retention time were compared
(Fig. 3, Table 1).

Notes
1. A 10 kinase assay buffer is suitable for several protein kinases.
Some other cofactors may be needed and the pH of the buffer
should be adjusted according to the need of the kinase.
2. The regulations for the use of radioactivity have to be followed.
Work should be performed only in a specialized laboratory. Use
a plexiglass shield, gloves, and safety spectacles. Minimize the
time you handle radioactive samples.
3. Acrylamide needs to be handled using best laboratory practice
because it is a neurotoxin. Dissolve using magnetic stirrer and,
if needed, heat the solution to 37 C to improve the solubility
of the chemicals within this mixture.
4. Use a magnetic stirrer for dissolving and pH adjustment.
5. SDS can precipitate at low temperatures. If this occurs, incu-
bate the solution at 37 C until the SDS is resolubilized.
6. Use fresh or a relatively fresh stock of ammonium persulfate.
This solution should not be used after a couple of weeks at
4 C.
7. According to Eppendorf, Protein LoBind tubes have a hydro-
philic surface designed for use in protein research or sensitive
proteomics to ensures optimal recovery of sample.
8. The lyophilized trypsin can be re-dissolved in 1 mM HCl,
aliquot and stored at 20 C. Use only sequencing-grade
trypsin. After thawing the aliquot, mix it with 100 mM ammo-
nium bicarbonate buffer to make a 10 ng/μL stock solution.
9. For a detailed discussion on how to make the StageTips, see
Ref. [13].
10. It is necessary to determine the linear range of the reaction.
Use a ﬁxed enzyme concentration and ﬁxed substrate concen-
tration (in a large excess of enzyme) and follow the formation
of product. The goal is to ﬁnd a reaction time during which
product accumulation is linear.
11. Oxygen inhibits polymerization.
12. Methanol, acetic acid, and water solution remove SDS from
the gel and prevent dispersion of the proteins. An acidic envi-
ronment enhances interaction with the dye.

Fig. 3 (continued) green and an asterisk indicates the presence of a phosphorylation site. (b) The mass-
spectrum analysis of peptide samples from kinase reactions. Peptides with the same sequence labeled with
“light” or “heavy” isotope are chemically identical. So, the retention time of differentially labeled peptides is
the same and they elute from LC column and enter into mass-spectrometry together. In a full scan we can
observe them as duplets where “light” and “heavy” peptide are separated by their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio.
The peaks heights represent relative abundance and can be used for quantiﬁcation

By combining in vitro kinase assays and LC-MS/MS analysis we mapped four different Cdk1 sites in Sld2. Three sites (S100, S128, and S138) were phosphorylated by both Cln2/
Cdk1 and Clb5/Cdk1 complexes. These results conﬁrm the earlier knowledge from the in vitro kinase assay that the protein Sld2 is a speciﬁc substrate for Clb5. The relative
abundance (the precursor ions peaks heights) of “light” peptides was higher than “heavy” peptides, but a more important ﬁnding is that site T84, which plays essential role in the
initiation of DNA replication and cell cycle progression, was only phosphorylated by Clb5. From the last kinase assay time point we were able to detect a tiny amount of peptide
where site T84 was phosphorylated by the Cln2/Cdk1 complex

13. Stain provides a marginal background so you can observe
bands that appear during the staining. First, stronger bands
appear after 10–20 min. For 100% staining, overnight incuba-
tion is required.
14. There are many variations of in-gel digestion protocols that can
be useful for speciﬁc purposes. The following protocol is a
modiﬁed version of the protocol published by Shevchenko
et al. [14].
15. Avoid very small pieces because they can clog the pipette tips.
Larger gel pieces affect the efﬁciency of protease digestion.
Take
care
to
prevent
common
contaminants
in
mass-
spectrometry. Use good laboratory practice, wear non-latex
gloves, work under the hood, and visually check tubes and
pipette tips for contaminating particles. While it is almost
impossible to have no biological contamination at all, it is
actually quite easy to keep it low. Keller et al. have published
a very useful paper on common contaminants in mass-
spectrometry [15].
16. For large gel slices, use enough liquid to cover it completely
and then a little bit more.
17. In this step, samples can be stored at 20 C for a few weeks.
18. The procedure is usually carried out with trypsin but other
enzymes such as LysC, ArgC, AspN, or GluC can also be
used. Although gel pieces do not absorb any more buffer
after ca. 30 min, the extended incubation time is required
because of the slow diffusion of the protease into the gel
matrix. Speeding up this step will decrease the digestion
efﬁciency.
19. Keep the extracted gel pieces. If the digestion fails, you can
repeat the digestion or use another protease.
20. The actual time is highly dependent on the number of C18
disks used, the back-pressure of the StageTip. This means that
the time needs to be established every time for a new batch
of tips.
21. Within 1–2 min, the tips won’t dry out even when no residual
liquid is left on top of the disk.
22. It is critical to have the sample at the same pH as Buffer A for
efﬁcient binding.
23. This step washes off salts and other non-retained contaminants
from the sample. StageTips from this step can be stored at
20 C and peptides can be eluted later.
24. The ﬁnal volume should be <50% of water content, that is,
<2 μL in case peptides were eluted twice with 10 μL of Elution
buffer.

Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play important roles in the regulation of cellular function and in
disease, and thus they represent an important group of therapeutic targets. Yet, members of this “disorder-
ome” have not yet been successfully targeted by drugs, primarily because traditional design principles
cannot be applied to their highly dynamic, heterogeneous structural states. Binders developed against IDPs
so far suffer from very weak binding and inability to act in a cellular context. Here, we describe a possible
generic method for the targeting of IDPs via covalent modiﬁcation, which could entail speciﬁc and strong
binding and inhibitory potential, making such “warheads” reasonable starting points of drug-development
efforts. We demonstrate this principle by addressing the cysteine-speciﬁc covalent modiﬁcation of calpas-
tatin, the IDP inhibitor of the calcium-dependent cysteine protease calpain. We describe the protocol for
monitoring the covalent modiﬁcation of the inhibitor, measuring the Ki of its inhibition and comparing it
to the Kd of its interaction with the enzyme. Our premise is that the underlying principles can be easily
adapted to screen for molecules targeting other, disease-related, IDPs in the future.

Introduction
Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) lack a well-
deﬁned 3D structure; rather they exist and function as an ensemble
of rapidly interconverting conformations [1, 2]. Due to this struc-
tural state/characteristic, they cannot fulﬁl enzymatic functions and
bind small molecules weakly; rather they play roles in signaling and
regulation often by binding to a structured partner in an induced
folding process [3]. Structural disorder is particularly prevalent in
higher organisms [4] and is often implicated in diseases such as
cancer and neurodegeneration [5]. Therefore, IDPs represent

important therapeutic targets [6, 7]. Yet, members of this “disor-
derome” have not yet been successfully targeted by drugs, primarily
because traditional design principles are hampered by their highly
dynamic, heterogeneous structural state. In the literature, about
half a dozen IDPs have so far been targeted by drug-like molecules,
developed either against their folded binding partner (e.g., nutlins
inhibiting the partner of p53, Hdm2 [8]), or directly against the
IDP itself (e.g., SJ403 inhibiting p27 [9] or IIA4B20 inhibiting
c-Myc [7]).
Although the hit rate of discovering IDP binders is reasonably
high, only a few molecules, such as YK-4-279 targeting EWS-FLI1
[10], have so far reached clinical phase, primarily because binding
to their disordered target is generally very weak and non-speciﬁc. A
“rational” attempt based on in silico docking to the structural
ensemble of α-synuclein, an IDP implicated in Parkinson’s disease,
also only yielded a high-μM inhibitor [11]. The serendipitously
discovered molecule EPI-001, targeting the androgen receptor
(AR), is the ﬁrst indication that covalent drugs may bring the
long-awaited breakthrough in targeting IDPs/IDRs [12].
Despite concerns of side-effects (e.g., hepatotoxicity), many
successful drugs on the market, such as aspirin, penicillin, and
other
top-selling
drugs,
covalently
modify
their
targets
[13, 14]. These molecules derive superior binding strength from
irreversible binding to their (folded) protein partners. Recently, it
has been demonstrated that high-resolution structural information
on target-hit complexes can guide the rational design of such highly
effective targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) [13], such as EGF
receptor
(EGFR)
antagonists
dacomitinib
and
afatinib
[15, 16]. Because covalency can signiﬁcantly increase the efﬁciency
and speciﬁcity of drugs against folded targets [17], we expected it
to also boost the efﬁciency of small-molecule binders of IDPs, as
indicated by the noted success of EPI-001 acting on AR
[12]. Here, we describe in detail the ﬁrst steps toward the rational
implementation of this principle by outlining the effects of covalent
modiﬁcation on the inhibitory activity of calpastatin, the IDP
inhibitor of the calcium-dependent cysteine protease calpain [18].
As calpain is a validated drug target, targeting calpastatin repre-
sents a good test case, being a highly speciﬁc IDP inhibitor of the
enzyme of clearly deﬁned activity and function [18], with the
structure of their complex known [19]. Calpastatin has a few key
cysteines located near its binding motifs, which creates a system in
which covalent modiﬁcation is expected to have a signiﬁcant func-
tional effect. In this protocol, we describe four steps of characteriz-
ing this effect in detail, by (1) monitoring the modiﬁcation of
calpastatin by several covalent modiﬁers (warheads) [20, 21] by
5,50-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid [DTNB] reaction and mass-
spectrometry, (2) analyzing the inﬂuence of modiﬁcation on the
structural properties of calpastatin by circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopy,

modiﬁcation on the Ki of its calpain inhibition, and (4) measuring
the effect of calpastatin modiﬁcation on the Kd of calpain-
calpastatin interaction by bio-layer interferometry (BLI). The bind-
ing study by BLI is not presented here as it can be done by various
published methods, instead only the resulting Kd is reported. The
details of these steps are speciﬁc to the calpain-calpastatin system,
but they can also be viewed as part of a generic and easily adaptable
protocol for targeting the functionality of other disease-associated
IDPs by optimizing other warheads [21] and quantitating their
functional effects.

Methods
3.1
Characterization
of Warheads
1. Probes are to be selected from an electrophilic fragment library
[21] for the cysteine-speciﬁc modiﬁcation of calpastatin
(Table 1). We chose eight compounds to present diverse war-
heads, such as acrylamide (compound 1, cf. Table 1), acrylni-
trile (2), maleimide (3, 4, 5), hydrazone (6), chloroacetamide
(K148, 7), and bromoacetophenone (BTF25, 8).
2. The type of modiﬁcation of the warheads should be diverse:
here haloketone derivatives 7 and 8 react with thiols in nucleo-
philic substitution, while the others (1–6) have C¼C or C¼N
double bonds in conjugated nucleophilic addition (Michael-
addition in the case of C¼C bonds) [25].
3. Test the thiol reactivity of the compounds in a surrogate GSH
(glutathione)-based kinetic assay [21, 26] and their aqueous
stability in parallel measurements [21]. Note that the com-
pounds represent a wide reactivity range: the maleimides 3–5
and bromoacetophenone 8 reacted instantaneously with GSH,
while chloroacetamide 7 and acrylamide 1 showed t1/2 of 5.8 h
and 4.2 h, respectively. The reactivity of hydrazone 6 was the
lowest (t1/2 ¼ 35.7 h). Notably, the GSH adduct could be
detected in MS by all of the tested compounds. It is also
important to check the stability of adducts (see Note 5).
4. Compounds 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 are commercially available or were in
stock, while probes 1, 4, 5 are synthesized as described below.
The probes should be stored in solid form or in 20 mM DMSO
stock solution at 20 C.
5. NMR samples are prepared as 10 mg/mL-concentration solu-
tions in a volume of 500 uL deuterated solvent (DMSO/
D2O), by vortexing for 2 min if necessary. The NMR tubes
were standard 5 mm NMR tubes. CDCl3 contained 0.03%
tetramethylsilane (TMS).
6. Record
1H NMR spectra of the warheads individually in
DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 solution at RT (in our case, on a Varian
Covalent Targeting of IDPs
841

Unity Inova 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz), with the deute-
rium signal of the solvent as the lock and tetramethylsilane
(TMS) as the internal chemical shift standard. Chemical shifts
(δ) and coupling constants (J) are in ppm and Hz, respectively.
7. Run high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) cou-
pled with MS (HPLC-MS) measurements to check the purity
of the compounds. Elute samples with a gradient of eluent A
and eluent B. The ﬂow rate should be set to 1 mL/min, with an
initial condition of 0% eluent B, followed by a linear gradient to
100% eluent B by 1 min, then retaining 100% B eluent from
1 to 3.5 min; and returning from 3.5 to 4.5 min back to initial
conditions with 5% eluent B, to be retained to 5 min. Keep
column temperature at RT, and inject 10 μL sample. Assess the
purity of compounds by HPLC with UV detection at 215 nm
(see Note 6).
8. Check reactivity of the compounds with glutathione. To do
this, add 250 μL 500 μM solution of the fragment (in PBS
buffer pH 7.4, 10% acetonitrile, and 200 μM indoprofen as
internal standard) to 10 mM glutathione solution (dissolved in
PBS buffer, 250 μL) in 1:1 ratio, bringing the ﬁnal concentra-
tions to: 250 μM fragment, 100 μM indoprofen, 5 mM gluta-
thione, and 5% acetonitrile.
9. Analyze the progress of the reaction by HPLC-MS after 0, 1,
2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 h time intervals. In a similar setup, also
monitor degradation kinetics by preparing the samples as in
step 1, but by applying pure PBS buffer instead of the glutathi-
one solution. In this experiment, the ﬁnal concentration of the
mixture should be 250 μM fragment, 100 μM indoprofen, and
5% acetonitrile.
10. Determine the AUC (area under the curve) values by integrat-
ing the HPLC spectra corrected by internal standard. Apply the
AUC values of the fragments for ordinary least squares (OLS)
linear regression (see Note 7).
3.2
Covalent
Modiﬁcation
of Calpastatin
3.2.1
Modiﬁcation
Reaction
The cysteine residue in the target protein is modiﬁed in vitro using
different warheads, which show high selectivity on certain condi-
tions toward cysteine residues. The warheads are dissolved in 100%
DMSO to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 mM (see Note 8).
1. Add 5 mM DTT to the protein (to 120 μL, 0.32 mM protein
concentration) in reducing buffer) and incubate at RT for 1 h
to make sure that the cysteine is in the active reduced form.
2. Desalt the samples into buffer A using Zeba spin columns
(0.5 mL) to remove excess DTT and ensure the right condi-
tions for the modiﬁcation (see Note 9).
842
Hung Huy Nguyen et al.

3. Divide the sample into three equal volumes (38 μL) and add
2 μL of 100 mM warhead (see Note 10). The concentration of
the warhead should be ﬁvefold higher than the concentration
of TCEP (1 mM) in the modiﬁcation buffer. Run the reaction
for 1 h at RT (see Note 11).
4. Remove excess warhead by desalting the reaction mixtures into
any desired buffer according to the subsequent experiments
using Zeba spin columns (0.5 mL).
3.2.2
Following
Modiﬁcation by DTNB
The reactivity of the warheads is measured using DTNB. In princi-
ple, DTNB reacts with a free sulfhydryl group to form a mixed
disulﬁde molecule and releases 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (TNB),
which absorbs light at 412 nm.
1. Prepare the reaction mixtures of the protein and compound in
Eppendorf tubes as described in Subheading 3.2.1 (the total
volume of the reaction in this case will vary [see Note 12]). The
ﬁnal concentration of the protein can be varied from 100 to
200 μM; the concentration of the compounds should be
adjusted accordingly.
2. At certain time points (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 20 h
in our case), 10 μL of the above reaction mixtures should be
mixed with DTNB to a ﬁnal concentration of 200 μM in a
96-well plate set up with a total volume of 200 μL. The ﬁnal
concentration of the protein and compound are diluted
20 times in this reaction. The reaction with DTNB is allowed
to develop for 10 min at RT before absorbance at 412 nm is
measured using a plate reader (see Note 12).
3. The auto-oxidation of the unmodiﬁed protein (reaction with
DTNB without the addition of compound) should also be
monitored with the above protocol (see Note 13).
4. Plot the absorbance value of the samples as a function of time
(Fig. 1).
5. Depending on the chemical properties of the compound, one
should consider including a control reaction between the com-
pound and TNB: 10 μM of free cysteine is mixed with 200 μM
of DNTB in a total volume of 200 μL. The reaction is incu-
bated for 10 min at RT. The compound is added to the reaction
mixture to a ﬁnal concentration similar to that mentioned
above (step 2, Subheading 3.2.1). The absorbance at 412 nm
is measured in function of time for 10 min (see Note 14).
3.2.3
Following Protein
Modiﬁcation by MS
To further characterize the modiﬁcation, perform MS analysis both
of the product after modiﬁcation as well as applying protease diges-
tion with MS/MS analysis to determine the speciﬁcity of the modi-
ﬁcation for the cysteine residue.
Covalent Targeting of IDPs
843

Mass Determination
of Proteins
1. Solubilize the protein solutions in 0.5% TFA.
2. Desalt the samples on ZipTip C18 and elute in 5 μL 50%
acetonitrile/1% formic acid (v/v).
3. Load the samples into a nanoﬂow capillary.
4. Acquire the electron spray ionization (ESI) mass spectra on a
Q-TOF mass-spectrometer operating in the positive ion mode,
equipped with a Z-spray nanoelectrospray source using a Mas-
sLynx 4.1 system.
5. Record the spectra in the V mode and represent the combina-
tion of 1 s scans.
6. Determine the molecular mass of the proteins after processing
of the spectra using the software MaxEnt1 (see Note 15).
Protein Sequence Analysis
1. Digest the protein samples overnight at 37 C in 20 mM
phosphate buffer pH 7.8 in the presence of sequencing grade
Endoproteinase Glu-C (protein/enzyme mass ratio 25:1).
2. Desalt the samples on ZipTip C18 and elute in 5 μL 50%
acetonitrile/1% formic acid (v/v).
3. Load into the nanoﬂow capillary.
4. Acquire ESI mass spectra as described above.
5. Analyze the peptides by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).
6. Process the MS/MS data by the maximum entropy data
enhancement program MaxEnt 3. The amino acid sequences
were semi-automatically deduced using the peptide sequencing
program PepSeq (Micromass/Waters).

assay (absorbance at 412 nm). K79 (compound 6), K72 (2), K117 (3), K148 (4),
K147 (1) are warheads described in Table 1, unmodiﬁed is the control sample
without the addition of warhead to monitor the auto-oxidation process

3.2.4
Identiﬁcation
of the Modiﬁcation by
SDS-PAGE
Depending on the nature of the modiﬁcation, the success of modi-
ﬁcation can be monitored and visualized by its shift in electropho-
retic mobility on SDS-PAGE.
1. 5 μL of the protein sample (modiﬁed, or unmodiﬁed as con-
trol) is mixed with 10 μL protein loading dye (no DTT) (see
Note 13).
2. The mixture is heated for 5 min at 95 C.
3. 5 μL of the heated sample is loaded into the well of a 12%
acrylamide discontinuous gel, pre-assembled in an electropho-
resis chamber ﬁlled with Tris-glycine running buffer.
4. Run electrophoresis for 40 min at 200 V, and stain with PAGE-
Blue.
3.3
CD Spectroscopy
To monitor the change in the secondary structure upon modiﬁca-
tion, the far-UV CD spectrum of the protein, in this case calpasta-
tin, should be recorded.
1. Prepare 200 μL of calpastatin at the ﬁnal concentration of
13 μM in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5.
2. Pipette 200 μL of each sample into a high-quality quartz
cuvette of 1 mm path-length.
3. Far-UV CD spectra should be recorded from 260 nm to
195 nm, at a scanning speed of 20 nm/min, a response time
of 2 s and a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm. The ﬁnal CD spectrum
is the result of ﬁve accumulated scans.
4. Record a spectrum of the buffer containing the compound at
similar concentration and in the same buffer and using the same
settings, and subtract this from the CD spectrum of calpastatin.
5. Convert the observed signal (S) to mean residue ellipticity
([θ]MRW) by the equation:
θ½ MRW ¼ S  MRW
10  C  L
where S is the observed CD signal (degrees), MRW is the mean
residue weight and equal protein molecular weight divided by
the number of residues, C is protein concentration in mg/mL,
L is the cuvette path-length in cm.
6. Plot the ([θ]MRW (degrees cm2/dmol) as a function of wave-
length λ (nm) (Fig. 2).
3.4
Inhibition Assay
To monitor the effect of covalent modiﬁcation of the inhibitor, the
proteolytic activity of calpain needs to be monitored by using the
ﬂuorogenic
substrate
N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC.
The
ﬂuorescence signal should be monitored at an emission wavelength
Covalent Targeting of IDPs
845

of 460 nm after excitation at 380 nm in a plate reader. Enzyme
kinetics should be recorded at 30 C for 1 min (e.g., every 10 s).
The initial signal is auto-scaled to 2000 relative ﬂuorescence units
in accordance with the well where the highest signal is expected, to
avoid signals exceeding the detection limit (100,000).
3.4.1
Determination
of Michaelis-Menten
Constant (Km)
1. Prepare a series of substrate (S) concentration from 0 to
200 μM in buffer B. The total volume is 700 μL.
2. Dispense 200 μL of each concentration solution into three
columns in a 96-well plate (for a guide to distribute solutions,
cf. Table 2).
3. Add 100 nM of enzyme as a ﬁnal step to the wells of the ﬁrst
column using multiple channel pipettes (see Note 16).

4. Record the kinetic data using the plate reader, and repeat the
steps for the second and third columns to generate experimen-
tal triplicates.
3.4.2
Inhibition Assay:
Determination of Inhibitory
Constant (Ki)
Key to characterizing the effect of the covalent modiﬁcation of the
inhibitor is to quantitate inhibition. To do this, enzyme activity is
monitored in the presence of various inhibitor concentrations, at a
typical enzyme (calpain) concentration of 90 nM, substrate con-
centration of 50 μM, and using an inhibitor concentration range
determined individually, based on screening experiments (see Note
17). These enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor concentrations are
speciﬁc for this system. The protocol and recommendation below
are somewhat restricted to a competitive tight binding inhibition,
as exempliﬁed by the calpain-calpastatin system (i.e., it is not repre-
sentative of all different enzyme-inhibition types).
1. Perform screening experiments to determine the correct range
of inhibitor concentration. If one deﬁnes the fractional activity
of enzyme ( f ) as equal to v0/vi where v0, vi are the initial
velocity at 0 and i inhibitor concentration, respectively, then a
good concentration range should cover an f value from 0 to
1. Murphy (2004) deﬁnes three regions in the concentration-
response curve (Fig. 3), and recommends that few data points
are required in region A and C (two for each is enough),
whereas more points in the region B are required for accurate
Ki determination [27].
2. Prepare a series of inhibitor concentrations, premixed with
enzyme at a ﬁnal concentration of 90 nM in buffer B with a
total volume of 700 μL.
Fig. 3 Theoretical curve of the analysis of enzyme inhibition. Demonstration of
three regions deﬁned by Murphy (2014) [27] from a concentration-response
curve of residual enzyme activity as a function of inhibitor concentration (I).
Theory suggests that the more points are measured in region B, the more
accurately Ki is determined. In principle, it is sufﬁcient to determine only two
data points within regions A and C
Covalent Targeting of IDPs
847

3. Continue the assay as described in Subheading 3.2.1. Note that
in this assay, substrate at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 μM is added
last (see Note 18).
3.4.3
Data Analysis
Data analysis could be done using different analysis software; in our
case, GraphPad Prism 7.0 software was used.
1. Make the scatter plot of the ﬂuorescence signal as a function of
time (data 1).
2. Perform linear regression of data 1. The determined slope is the
initial velocity (vi).
3. Plot the initial velocity as a function of substrate concentration
(data 2).
4. To determine Km in μM, perform a non-linear least squares ﬁt
of the data 2 using the Michaelis-Menten equation below:
v ¼ vmax  S
S þ K m
where v is the initial velocity, vmax is the maximum velocity, and
S is the substrate concentration in μM.
5. To determine Ki, plot the initial velocity as a function of
inhibitor concentration (data 3) and perform a non-linear
least squares ﬁt of graph 3 using Morrison quadratic equation:

to ﬁx the E to the nominal concentration, but be aware that this
value might not always reﬂect the concentration of the active
enzyme. To measure accurately the concentration of active
enzyme, one could do the inhibitor titration assay at a ﬁxed
concentration of enzyme, where E/Ki  200 [28]. Assess the
quality of the ﬁt by (a) visually looking at how far the ﬁtted
curve deviates from the data points, (b) the R2 value should be
above 0.9, and most importantly (c) the physical meaning of
the ﬁtted E value (see Note 18). If these criteria are not met, do
the ﬁtting again while letting E ﬂoat. Carefully evaluate the
ﬁtted E value, because this ﬁtting method can lead to a physi-
cally meaningless enzyme concentration and hence inaccurately
estimate Ki. Kuzmic [29] demonstrates that it is acceptable if
848
Hung Huy Nguyen et al.

the ﬁtted E is within an order of magnitude compared to the
nominal one (this is only applied to the condition in which
Ki  E). If Ki 	 E, then E is leveled out and has very little effect
on Ki determination (see Note 17). The effect of the modiﬁca-
tion by one of the compounds is demonstrated in Fig. 4.
3.5
Conclusions and
Recommendations
Covalent modiﬁcation of calpastatin reduces its inhibitory potential
with certain electrophiles, whereas the comparison of the effect on
Ki versus the Kd (determined separately, cf. [24, 30]) of enzyme-
inhibitor interaction may provide interesting insights into details of
this mechanism (Table 3). Whereas both show an increase (weak-
ening) upon modiﬁcation, Kd values are larger than Ki values. This
is indicative of the difference between a kinetic parameter (Ki) and
an equilibrium parameter (Kd), and probably also points to alloste-
ric communication within the structure of the active enzyme
(Ki) vs. its inactive mutant (because Kd has been determined by a
mutant enzyme that has no catalytic activity). Importantly, Table 3
only reports those compounds that have high reactivity and speci-
ﬁcity against thiol groups (based on MS data). For hCSD1, com-
pounds that show no effect on the binding afﬁnity are not tested
further for the inhibition potency. The calpain-calpastatin case
should be taken as an illustrative example of how to potentially
target many other IDPs: whereas details of the method are speciﬁc
to the given system, they can be easily adapted to any other
IDP-partner systems. On the other hand, the speciﬁc calpain-
calpastatin system, as described, can be used to screen further
electrophilic warheads for their effect on IDPs.
Fig. 4 Inﬂuence of chemical modiﬁcation on the inhibition potency of calpastatin. Each point represents the
mean value of the enzyme activity (%) at different inhibitor concentrations (as on the theoretical curve, Fig. 3),
whilst error bars are the standard deviation of the mean. The concentration-response curves are ﬁtted with the
Morrison quadratic equation (cf. Subheading 3.4.3), while letting E ﬂoat. The error bars from the unmodiﬁed
protein cannot be seen because of low standard deviation in comparison to the size of the data points. Ki of the
modiﬁed protein (hCSD1 PL123A, right panel) is increased almost threefold compared to the unmodiﬁed
protein (hCSD1, left panel)

5. Check for stability of the electrophilic adducts (cf. [21]), as it
may be important for interpreting their effect. Of the eight
probes tested (Table 1), three of the most reactive ones (4, 5, 8)
degrade in buffer in less than 1 h, while maleimide 3 has higher
stability. The degradation of compounds 1, 6, and 7 was not
signiﬁcant even after 72 h.

6. We should insist on high purity of compounds; in our case, all
tested compounds were >95% pure.
7. For computing the half-life of the compounds, we recommend
to use a programmed Excel (Visual Basic for Applications)
application. The data should be expressed as means of duplicate
determinations, to reach standard deviations within 10% of the
given values.
8. Long-term storage of the warhead stocks can be achieved at
20 C in LightSafe micro centrifuge tubes.
9. As the warheads are reactive to thiol groups, any excess of DTT
should be removed before adding the warhead to the sample.
During modiﬁcation, TCEP must be used to ensure the
reduced state of the cysteine residue. TCEP reacts with the
warheads signiﬁcantly slower than DTT. Because the chemical
selectivity of the different warheads depends on pH, its value
should be chosen wisely. In our case, a pH of 7.1–7.4 was
chosen because the maleimides are more reactive toward a
free sulfhydryl than to an amine.
10. If the warhead is very hydrophobic, the amount of DMSO can
be increased to enhance its solubility. Typically, DMSO up to
about 5% does not denature IDPs, and should be removed at
the end of the modiﬁcation reaction to ensure no interference
with subsequent experiments.
11. Based on our experience, 1 h at RT gave sufﬁcient and selective
modiﬁcation result for one cysteine residue using highly reac-
tive maleimides compounds. However, it might need to be
optimized using the DNTB assay for other compounds as
well as for different targets.
12. The volume of the reaction mixture is equal to the number of
time points to be taken for the DTNB assay, multiplied by the
volume of each sample. In our case, it must be higher or equal
to 110 μL (11  10 μL). Because the protein is diluted
20 times in the DTNB assay compared to the modiﬁcation
reaction, it is recommended that the initial concentration
should be high enough to ensure a ﬁnal concentration of the
protein in DTNB assay at or above 10 μM. At such values, a
good absorbance reading at 412 nm is guaranteed.
13. Depending on the number of Cys residues in the protein and
their chemical environment, the effect of oxidation may be
different. One should consider performing the modiﬁcation
reaction in anaerobic condition.
14. The reactivity of the compound against TNB should always be
tested to avoid misinterpretation of data.

15. The MaxEnt1 algorithm is used to produce true molecular
mass spectra from multiply-charged electrospray spectra. Start-
ing from the m/z raw data, a ﬁrst analysis or survey is made
over a deliberately chosen wide molecular mass range in order
to localize the mass range or ranges for a second deﬁnitive
analysis. Once the approximate masses of the components
have been found from the survey, the second deﬁnitive run is
made over a narrower output mass range (or ranges) using a
ﬁner mass scale (0.1 Da/channel), in order to obtain fully
accurate molecular mass values.
16. The multi-channel pipette allows for a parallel distribution of
samples. After adding the substrate to the enzyme, mix the
wells three times using the same pipette while avoiding gen-
erating air bubbles as they interfere with the ﬂuorescence read-
out. Proceed immediately to the reading step as calpain has fast
kinetic activity.
17. The ﬁnal concentration of enzyme in the assay should be kept
as low as possible, to allow for an accurate estimation of Ki,
because the elbow region of the concentration-response curve
is diminished and become linear if E/Ki is too high (Fig. 3).
Based on Murphy’s simulation data, it is recommended to have
the E/Ki ratio between 1 and 100. The substrate concentra-
tion should also be kept as low as possible as the apparent Ki
will approach the real Ki as S/Km approaches 0. Be aware that
sometimes it is not possible to lower the concentration due to
the sensitivity of the assay and/or the solubility of the sub-
strate. Because the substrate is dissolved in DMSO, it is better
to make a stock with a high concentration to avoid high con-
centrations of DMSO in the ﬁnal assay (should not be higher
than 5%).
18. In our experience, the ﬁtted E varies depending on the potency
of the inhibitor, provided that a similar nominal E is used in the
assays with different inhibitors. For example, the nominal
E used in our experiments is 100 nM; however, the ﬁtted
E for hCSD1 and hCSD1 PL123A are 120 and 250 nM,
respectively. This is acceptable since these values are within an
order of magnitude compared the nominal one. One should
carefully evaluate not only the physical meaning of the ﬁtted
E but also the ﬁtted Ki, based on the concentration-response
curve. It is also very useful to look at the 95% conﬁdence
interval (CI) of the Ki value when comparing the potency of
different inhibitors, because inhibitors might have different Ki
values but similar CI ranges. The Morrison method above is
perfectly relevant to determine the Ki for a non-tightly binding
inhibition, where Ki 	 E.

Abstract
At the foundation of many cellular processes as well as a large number of diseases is the (mis)folding of
important intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Despite tremendous scientiﬁc efforts, the factors driving
their structural changes within the cellular context remain poorly understood. In-cell NMR spectroscopy
enables investigation of IDPs directly in the living eukaryotic cell enabling investigation of its intermolecu-
lar interactions and ensuing modiﬁcations at an unprecedented atomic resolution. In the following
protocol, we describe how to prepare in-cell NMR samples of IDPs within eukaryotic cells and how to
measure these in-cell NMR samples of an IDP in its natural environment, the living mammalian cell.
Furthermore, we outline a procedure to assess the intracellular recombinant protein concentration of the
studied IDP based on in-cell NMR methods. We use α-synuclein as a model protein, but the presented
approach is highly modular and therefore should be easily adapted and altered to the desired needs for the
studies of different IDPs.

Introduction
Despite their lack of tertiary structure, intrinsically disordered pro-
teins (IDPs) are comprising a highly abundant class of functionally
important proteins in the eukaryotic proteome [1]. These proteins
perform a central role in the regulation of signaling pathways like
transcription and translation and they are involved in neuronal
synapse regulation [2] or axonal transport [3]. Commonly, their
function/dysfunction as well as binding to other proteins is
connected with posttranslational modiﬁcations [1, 4–7]. The
amount of IDPs in the cell needs to be highly regulated to ensure
precise signaling [1, 8]. Mutations or changes in their respective
cellular abundance are often directly connected with cellular dys-
function and disease [9, 10].
Based on the recent advancements in in-cell NMR spectros-
copy, initially performed in bacterial cells or oocytes [11, 12],

crucial questions underlying the (mis)folding of IDPs can now be
addressed at an unprecedented detail within its cellular context, the
living eukaryotic cells [13, 14]. In-cell NMR offers the unique
opportunity to study IDPs within a relevant biological context at
atomic resolution, making it highly complementary to established
cell biology methods [14].
Currently, for performing in-cell NMR experiments, two dif-
ferent approaches are used. Banci and coworkers overexpress their
target protein isotope labeled directly in the eukaryotic cells [13],
whereas Selenko and coworkers introduce recombinantly expressed
and puriﬁed protein via electroporation into eukaryotic cells
[14]. We have recently adapted the approach pioneered by the
Selenko lab, because it enables us to use more relevant protein
concentrations in the eukaryotic cells and is in general a more
open system allowing the use of protein modiﬁcations as well as
special labeling schemes suited to the respective scientiﬁc question.
In the following, we outline in detail a step-by-step protocol for
measuring in-cell NMR spectra in mammalian HEK-293 cells,
which can be adapted easily to a wide range of different cell lines
and a variety of isotopically labeled proteins. The approach is exem-
pliﬁed by uniformly labeled [U-15N]-α-synuclein (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1 Workﬂow for measuring in-cell NMR spectra in mammalian cells by electroporating recombinantly
expressed proteins. The protein of interest is expressed in E. coli or another host in an isotopically labeled
manner of choice [2H/15N/13C] and subsequently puriﬁed by chromatography following the respective puriﬁ-
cation procedure. To introduce the puriﬁed protein into the living mammalian cell, a protein stock solution is
mixed with the cells and electroporated. After a recovery period, to ensure that the mammalian cells are still
vital, the cell suspension is transferred directly to an NMR tube. The in-cell NMR sample is put into an NMR
spectrometer for the actual measurements. Subsequently, the resulting spectra are analyzed

Methods
3.1
Expression and
Puriﬁcation of Labeled
Proteins in Escherichia
coli
In order to be able to perform in-cell NMR measurements, the
protein under investigation needs to be expressed and puriﬁed in an
isotopically labeled form. The most common case is 15N-labeling,
but dependent on the system studied also 13C, 2H, or amino-acid-
speciﬁc labeling (e.g., by using 13C-D-Glucose and/or D2O) is
possible. For obtaining [U-15N] labeled protein, we grow the
expression cells (E. coli BL21(λ DE3)) in M9 minimal media,
supplemented with trace elements (solution Q), vitamins (vitamin
mix), and (15NH4)Cl as the sole nitrogen source [15].
To purify the proteins to sufﬁcient purity for NMR measure-
ments (e.g., >95% pure), we normally employ a combination of
afﬁnity, ion-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography, but the
exact puriﬁcation steps and parameters depend on the protein
under study (see Note 1). In the case of α-synuclein, we based our
expression and subsequent puriﬁcation strategy on established
methods [16, 17].
3.2
Preparation of
HEK-293 Cells for
Electroporation
The cell line used for the in-cell NMR-experiments is based on
human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, which are adherent cells
(adhere to the surface of the culture dish), relatively robust, easy to
culture with a very good growth rate (they are doubling in number
860

approximately every day), and low-cost media requirements. The
stepwise procedure of the preparation of the HEK-293 cells for
setting up in-cell NMR experiments is depicted in Fig. 2. Depend-
ing on the desired eukaryotic cells, the outlined protocol can be
adapted to the needs of different mammalian cell lines by, for
example, adding the required media ingredients and/or extending
the growth time according to their speciﬁc requirements.
1. Remove the cryo-vials of the frozen eukaryotic cells from the
liquid nitrogen storage and immediately place them into a
37 C water bath. Quickly thaw the cells (usually less than a
minute) by gently swirling the vial within the 37 C water bath
until just a tiny amount of ice is left. This ensures gentle
thawing and reduces the number of dead cells (see Notes
2 and 3).
2. Transfer the vial into the laminar hood. Mammalian cells
should be handled only under a laminar hood to prevent con-
tamination with fungi and bacteria. Before opening, wipe the
vial with 70% ethanol (see Notes 4 and 5).
3. Transfer 1 mL of prewarmed DMEM-complete-medium drop-
wise into a centrifuge tube (e.g., 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube).
4. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 200  g for 5 min at 20 C,
aseptically decant the supernatant without disturbing the cell
pellet.
5. Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 12 mL DMEM complete
medium and transfer them into a 100 mm culture dish (see
Note 6).
Fig. 2 Cell-culture work ﬂow. In the growth phase the cell viability is regularly monitored by an automated cell
counter and the cells are grown until they reach the desired conﬂuency. In order to obtain the desired number
of cells, the culture is split and grown on more culture dishes. At the stage when sufﬁcient cells are available,
the cells are transferred to the electroporator and mixed with recombinant isotopically labeled protein. After
electroporation, the cells are replated and allowed to recover for 5 h. Finally, the cells are detached and
subsequently transferred to an NMR tube for the measurements

6. On the next day, check if the cells are attached and check the
state of the culture by using a microscope. Healthy HEK-293
cells do not swim in the medium, they look nicely mono-
layered, and no cell clumps should be observed (see Note 7).
7. After 2 days, remove and discard the DMEM complete
medium (see Note 8).
8. Brieﬂy rinse the cells with sterile prewarmed 1 DPBS.
9. Add 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution (diluted from
0.25% stock solution) and evenly coat the surface with cells.
Incubate for 1–2 min. Gently shake the dish with the cells to
speed up the process of detaching the cells. You will observe the
ﬁlm of mammalian cells detached from the dish surface.
10. If necessary, use a microscope to check that the cells have
detached and that the cell clumps have completely dispersed.
11. Stop trypsinization by the addition of 10 mL of DMEM com-
plete medium.
12. Transfer the cell suspension to a conical tube. Take 8 μL cell
suspension and mix it with 2 μL Trypan Blue solution. Add
these 10 μL directly to the slide holder and put it into the cell
counter (see Note 9). Determine the total cell number and
percent viability with a cell counter. Modern cell counters are
able to directly provide these numbers automatically.
13. Pellet the cells at 300  g for 3 min at 20 C.
14. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in DMEM
complete medium.
15. Seed the new ﬂask at appropriate cell density for the size of the
ﬂask. For example, for 75 cm2 ﬂasks, use approximately
1  106 cells per ﬂask.
16. Place the ﬂasks in 5% CO2, 37 C incubator, and subculture for
another 2–3 days.
17. After 2–3 days (when the cells reached 70–90% con-
ﬂuency ! percentage of the dish area covered by the cells),
remove and discard the culture medium.
18. Brieﬂy rinse cells with sterile prewarmed 1 DPBS.
19. Add 4 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution and evenly coat the
surface with cells. Incubate for 1–2 min. Gently shake the dish
with the cells to speed up the process.
You will see the ﬁlm detached from the dish surface; if
necessary, check under the microscope.
20. Stop trypsinization by adding 10 mL of DMEM complete
medium.

21. Transfer the cell suspension to a conical tube. Determine the
total cell number and percent viability with an automatic cell
counter.
22. Pellet the cells at 300  g for 3 min at 20 C.
23. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 5 mL DMEM
complete medium.
24. Seed the new ﬂask at appropriate cell density for the size of the
ﬂask.
25. Split and passage the cells (! splitting the amount of eukary-
otic cells and passage them to fresh culture ﬂasks for growing a
larger number of cells) at 70–90% conﬂuency and not more
than 6–12 passages prior to the NMR experiment [14]. For a
single NMR experiment, you need around (10–30)  106
cells [14].
3.3
In-Cell NMR-
Sample Preparation
1. Thaw the desired protein if frozen, or use freshly prepared
isotopically labeled protein.
2. Spin it at 20,000  g for 30 min at 4 C and sterile ﬁlter the
supernatant (0.2 μm syringe ﬁlters).
3. Determine the protein concentration spectrophotometrically
by ultraviolet (UV) absorption measurements, either standard
absorbance at 280 nm or in case that the target protein lacks
tryptophan and tyrosine residues directly on the peptide bond
at 205 nm [18]. Alternatively, other methods like a standard
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) or Bradford assay are also possible.
Protein working
concentration should
be
approximately
1–1.5 mM. In case the desired protein cannot be concentrated
to these amounts, the larger corresponding volume can be
compensated by performing the electroporation (see later)
several times and subsequently concentrate the mammalian
cells by resuspending them in fewer microliters of buffer within
the ﬁnal NMR-sample preparation.
4. Once you reach a sufﬁcient number of HEK-293 cells (see step
25 in Subheading 3.2), detach the cells from the culture ﬂasks
with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (see steps 19–23 in Subheading
3.2).
5. Wash the cells once with PBS and determine the number of the
cells with a cell counter.
6. Pellet the cells at 300  g for 3 min at 20 C.
7. Mix the recombinant protein with freshly prepared EPB at a
1:1 ratio.
8. Resuspend the HEK-293 cells in protein-containing EPB to a
ﬁnal concentration of 40  106 cells per mL.
9. Incubate the mixture for 5 min at room temperature.

10. Transfer 100 μL aliquots (4  106 cells) into 2 mm cuvettes
and electroporate using the pulse set-up for HEK-293 cells
from the pulse program. Cells are pulsed twice with gentle
mixing in between the individual pulses (see Note 10).
11. Add 0.3 mL of prewarmed DMEM complete medium and
return the cells to a Falcon tube.
12. Wash the cells twice with prewarmed DMEM complete
medium.
13. Aliquots of 20  106 cells are added to the 140 mm petridishes
containing 15 mL prewarmed DMEM complete medium.
14. Return the cells to the incubator and allow them to recover for
about 5 h.
15. Monitor the morphology and viability by phase-contrast
microscopy. The cells should not change the shape (see Note
11) and should be attached to the dish surface and not ﬂoating
in the medium.
16. Once cells recover their adherent morphologies, wash the
dishes three times with 15 mL prewarmed PBS buffer.
17. Add 4 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution and evenly coat the
surface with cells. Incubate till the cells deattach.
18. Wash the cells once with prewarmed DMEM complete
medium and twice with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 5% D2O.
19. Centrifuge at 150  g for 5 min at 25 C.
20. For the NMR experiments, resuspend the cells in 250–500 μL
Leibovitz’s L-15 medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and
10% D2O (see Note 12).
21. For NMR measurements, a total of 250–300 μL are added to a
low-volume 5 mm Shigemi tube. To reduce the required
volumes, other tubes such as 3 mm Shigemi tubes or micro-
bottom tubes that need only to be ﬁlled with about 50 μL
sample can also be used.
3.4
NMR
Measurements
For the NMR experiments, the usage of NMR spectrometers with
600 MHz or higher equipped with cryogenically cooled resonance
probes is recommended to optimize signal to noise. Furthermore,
the usage of fast-experimental methods like the SOFAST or BEST
experiments is advantageous [19, 20]. Even though the standard
experiment used to study interaction is a [15N,1H]-HSQC/
HMQC reporting on the protein backbone amide resonances,
which is described later, for investigations involving IDPs, the
[13C,15N]-CON [21] experiments reporting on the backbone car-
bonyl resonances prove to be more sensitive and are becoming
more popular in combination with fast-pulsing techniques [22].

1. Prepare the NMR sample in a 5 mm Shigemi tube without a
plunger. Measure the height of the settled cells within the tube,
which is needed for subsequent intracellular concentration
determination (see Note 13).
2. Put the sample in the magnet. Due to the enhanced exchange
of
the
amide
protons
under
physiologically
conditions
(pH
7.4),
the
measurements
of
IDPs
with
standard
[15N,1H]-HSQC/HMQC experiments are generally per-
formed at lower temperatures like 10 C. In case this option
is not possible for a desired experimental set-up, the [13C,15N]-
CON [21] experiments, which do not include exchangeable
protons and are therefore not effected by the enhanced
exchange, would be a viable alternative option.
3. Check the tuning of the probe head and shim the magnet using
the standard procedures implemented in Bruker instruments
(the “atmm” and “topshim” routines).
4. Calibrate the
1H 90 hard pulse length and adjust the
corresponding 1H power levels accordingly.
5. We most commonly perform SOFAST-HMQC experiments
that use a band-selective excitation of the amide protons, and
the center and the band width used have to be selected. For
α-synuclein the excitation is centered at 8.5 ppm and a band-
width of 1 ppm is used to excite all the amide protons. These
parameters have to be adjusted eventually to the speciﬁc pro-
tein under study (see Note 14).
6. Select the number of scans and the interscan delay between the
individual scans. Normally we use an interscan delay of 200 ms
and measure for 64 scans with 64 complex points in the indirect
dimension amounting to about 80 min of measurement time
(see Note 15).
7. To estimate the concentration of proteins within the in-cell
NMR sample, the ﬁrst one-dimensional (1D) trace of the
SOFAST-HSQC
is
compared
to
the
respective
protein
measured in buffer solution at known concentrations (Fig. 3).
8. For the reference curve in buffer solution, different concentra-
tions in the range of the desired concentration should be
measured under the exact same conditions (buffer, tempera-
ture, experimental parameters) as the subsequent in-cell NMR
spectra. The region of the amide signals is integrated with
standard NMR software (e.g., Topspin, Bruker Biospin,
F€allanden, Switzerland) and plotted against the known concen-
trations. ! In order to be able to determine the concentration
and also obtain analyzable in-cell NMR spectra a signal-to-
noise ratio of at least 20:1 should be aimed for (see Note 16).
Recording In-Cell NMR Spectra

9. The in-cell NMR sample is measured under the same condi-
tions as the reference spectra and the intensity of the amide
region is compared to the reference spectra. ! The amide
region is integrated in the same way as for the reference spectra
and the effective concentration (Seff) of the isotopically labeled
in-cell protein is estimated. Please note that this method gives

spectra to determine the concentration of α-synuclein in HEK-293 cells. The
reference concentrations in PBS buffer are indicated (grey). Based on the signal
intensity, the concentration of the in-cell sample (effective concentration) was
estimated to about 6 μM. To ensure that the obtained signal is from intracellular
α-synuclein, the cells were pelleted after the measurement and the supernatant
(black) was remeasured, indicating no cell leakage, as observed by the absence
of NMR signal

you an estimate of 10% of the protein concentration within
your in-cell NMR sample and does not directly report on the
intracellular concentration (see Note 17).
10. To determine the intracellular [protein]cell concentration, we
use a formula derived by the Selenko lab [14]. On the basis of
the different average R2 (1H) relaxation rates, the authors
derived a correction factor of 1.45 to compensate for the signal
loss in-cell compared to buffer for the case of α-synuclein
[14]. Further parameters needed are the number of cells
(Ncell), which is determined from the total number of used
cells (Ntotal) within the receiver coil (in millimeters) volume of
the NMR spectrometer: Ncell ¼ Ntotal/hpellet  18, where hpellet
is the height of the cell pellet in millimeters. In the case of the
example depicted in Fig. 3, Ncell equals 25  106 cells. The
other parameter needed for the calculation is the individual cell
volume (Vcell), which can be derived from the estimated cellu-
lar diameter provided by an automatic cell counter. In case of
HEK-293 cells, the cellular diameter is determined to be
13.3

7.1
μm,
resulting
in
a
cellular
volume
of
1.23  0.2 pL assuming a spherical shape. Using the following
formula
α‐synuclein
½
cell ¼ Seff  F corr=N cell=V cell
and inserting the numbers result in an intracellular concentra-
tion of 28 μM (see Note 18).
11. To ensure that the signal you obtain is from protein within the
mammalian cells and not in the surrounding buffer solution,
the cells are pelleted after the NMR measurements are ﬁnished,
and the supernatant buffer is remeasured in a similar way as the
concentration reference.
12. In order to ensure that the measurements were performed on
healthy mammalian cells, determine the total cell number and
percent viability with a cell counter again after ﬁnishing the
NMR experiments. In our hands, we observed for HEK-293
cells a viability of about 85–90% at this stage.
13. Once the presented work ﬂow for the in-cell measurements is
set up, it can be directly combined with standard cell biology
techniques for up- or downregulation of target proteins to
study the effects on IDPs within the cellular context or the
effects of different variants of the electroporated proteins (e.g.,
different post translational modiﬁcations (PTMs)) can be
addressed.

Notes
1. Normally, the expression and puriﬁcation protocols do not
need to be adapted for the expression of isotopically labeled
protein. In some cases, a slower growth is observed in M9
minimal media that can be compensated by extending the
expression time for example.
2. When working with mammalian cells you need patience, focus,
and time. Book enough time for your work in a laminar ﬂow
hood and always use proper antiseptic technique when
handling mammalian cells. Do not forget to wipe all the dishes
with ethanol and clean the bench before and after you.
3. The freezing medium of the mammalian cells may become
yellow after thawing. This does not affect the quality of the
HEK-293 cells and we did not observe any differences in
growth and viability.
4. When using culture ﬂasks without gas-permeable caps, loosen
the caps before placing them in the incubator to allow for
proper gas exchange.
5. The thawing procedure is stressful for the cells, so work quickly
and have prewarmed all media and all equipment/chemicals/
dishes ready.
6. Cells should be maintained at 70–90% conﬂuency in a tissue
culture incubator. This typically requires passaging the culture
twice a week.
7. To disperse “clumpy cells,” it is recommended to gently pipet
the trypsinized cells in DMEM complete medium before trans-
ferring them to a new ﬂask.
8. The mammalian cells should be routinely tested for myco-
plasma contaminations [23, 24].
9. Quick handling is required, as Trypan blue is toxic for the cells,
viable cells will also be stained within a time frame of 5–30 min.
10. Leibovitz’s L-15 medium is buffered by phosphates and free
base amino acids and is designed for the cell growth in envi-
ronment without CO2 equilibration. We observed a slightly
increased viability for the subsequent NMR measurements by
using this medium.
11. Each type of eukaryotic cells has their characteristic morphol-
ogy. If the cells are dying, they look swollen and/or disformed
and they do not attach to the surface.
12. Depending on the mammalian cells used, the electroporation
conditions (e.g., power and length of the electroporation
pulse) might need to be adjusted and optimized. Most modern
electroporators have already different programs for a large
868
Irena Matecˇ ko-Burmann and Bjo¨ rn M. Burmann

diversity of cell lines implemented, and it is advisable to start
from these parameters. Further optimization might be needed
and is normally based on the percentage of healthy cells after
the recovery period as well as the resulting cellular concentra-
tion of the protein of choice.
13. It is recommended to use a height of the settled samples of at
least 18 mm, which equals the size of the receiver coil of the
NMR magnets, in order to be able to measure artifact-free
high-quality NMR spectra.
14. When using the fast-pulsing techniques like SOFAST, the min-
imum repetition time has to be carefully assessed as too short
interscan delays could lead to heating of the sample or could
even harm the spectrometer hardware [19].
15. Because of the increase in duty cycle (amount of radio fre-
quency power applied to the sample) of the SOFAST experi-
ments, the resolution in the indirect (15N) dimension is limited
to 64 complex points in order to prevent sample heating.
16. To obtain reliable results for the concentration determination,
it is recommended to measure the reference curve under simi-
lar conditions as the in-cell NMR spectra to avoid effects like
different molecular tumbling due to viscosity changes, for
example, induced by lower temperatures.
17. As the in-cell NMR sample contains both mammalian cells and
buffer, Seff is only reporting on the protein concentration
within the whole sample. Therefore, the intracellular concen-
tration of the target protein is higher than Seff.
18. Although Selenko and coworkers based the correction factor
Fcorr on the differences in relaxation properties of α-synuclein
in buffer versus intracellular α-synuclein, the authors observed
a very good correlation of the obtained value with standard
concentration measurements by Western blotting [14]. As this
correction factor is expected to be protein dependent and
therefore needs to be determined for each protein, it is recom-
mended to determine it once via Western blotting for an in-cell
NMR sample in case the relaxation-rate based approach is not
possible.

In-Cell NMR of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
in Mammalian Cells

Abstract
In-cell NMR enables structural insights at atomic resolution of proteins in their natural environment. To
date, very few methods have been developed to study proteins by in-cell NMR in mammalian systems. Here
we describe a detailed protocol to conduct in-cell NMR on the intrinsically disordered protein of alpha-
Synuclein (αSyn) in mammalian cells. This chapter includes a simpliﬁed expression and puriﬁcation protocol
of recombinant αSyn and its delivery into mammalian cells. The chapter also describes how to assess the cell
leakage that might occur to the cells, the setup of the instrument, and how to perform basic analyses with
the obtained NMR data.

Introduction
In the last decade, an enormous effort was made to better under-
stand how biological macromolecules behave in their native cellular
environment. Because of the unique advantage of providing struc-
tural insights into atomic resolution, nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is emerging as a powerful method to study
the contribution of both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasm
to the structure, dynamics, and function of proteins [1, 2].
To date, a limited number of protocols have been developed to
study proteins in mammalian cells by solution state NMR (see Note
1) [3]. They can be classiﬁed into two major groups according to
the source of the “NMR visible” protein, which can be either
expressed by the same cells that are subjected to the NMR deter-
minations, or provided externally to the cells by electroporation,
cell-penetrating peptides, or pore-forming toxins.
Endogenous expression of the isotopically labelled protein has
been proven to be a reliable method to gain atomic resolution
insights into the structural changes that proteins undergo inside

mammalian cells [2]. For instance, this method has been applied to
study
the
maturation
of
the
human
superoxide
dismutase
1 (SOD1) [4], among others. The method relies on the transient
or stable transfection into mammalian cells of an expression vector
(DNA plasmid) containing the gene encoding the protein of inter-
est. Cells are normally grown in standard culture media containing
10% fetal bovine serum, and in order to label the protein of interest
with the desired isotope(s), after transfection, the media is switched
to media containing the isotopically labelled amino acids and pre-
cursors. The main advantage of this method is that the biosynthesis
of the protein under study is carried out by the same mammalian
cells subjected to analyses and therefore the protein contains all the
modiﬁcations occurring in the intracellular milieu. The main disad-
vantage is increased background of the NMR signals due to the
synthesis of unrelated proteins, metabolites, and other biomole-
cules in cells grown in culture media containing the isotopes. These
unrelated molecules are also visible in NMR experiments making
identiﬁcation
of
the
resonances
of
the
protein
of
interest
challenging.
An alternative to this method consists in obtaining the NMR
visible protein from an external source that is then introduced into
mammalian cells. For instance, the protein under study can be
produced synthetically or expressed and puriﬁed in heterologous
systems such as bacteria, yeast, or insect cells. The exogenously
produced protein is then introduced into mammalian cells by elec-
troporation [5], cell-penetrating peptides [6], or pore-forming
toxins [7]. The main advantage of this method is a reduced back-
ground of the NMR signals and the possibility of monitoring
structural changes occurring on proteins lacking any modiﬁcation
or eventually modiﬁed in a speciﬁc manner according to the aim of
the experiment [8]. The main disadvantage of this method is that
the protein under study is produced and puriﬁed from an external
source, which might compromise the biochemical and structural
integrity of the molecule.
In a typical in-cell NMR experiment, cells are collected into an
NMR tube, which is then inserted into the spectrometer where the
measurements are carried out. Within the NMR tube, the cells are
gently packed by gravity-assisted decantation or by a slow centrifu-
gation step prior to the NMR measurements. During the NMR
experiments, cells might be devoid of a constant nutrient supply,
which restricts them to short measurements and temperatures not
permissive for cell proliferation such as 10 C. For longer experi-
ments or for experiments carried out at 37 C, a system aimed to
provide nutrients to the cells needs to be implemented in order to
minimize cellular stress and eventually necrosis [9, 10].
αSyn is a relatively small protein (i.e., 140 amino acid residues)
that in solution lacks a deﬁned three-dimensional (3D) structure, a
structural

[11]. αSyn is N-terminally acetylated in mammalian cells [12], and
this posttranslational modiﬁcation modulates αSyn lipid binding,
aggregation, oligomerization, and helical propensity [13–15]. Dur-
ing the last decade, a considerable amount of work has been con-
ducted to understand the precise structural landscape and dynamics
that human αSyn adopts in its natural environment (within a
human cell) [5]. αSyn is a major genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s
disease and related neurodegenerative disorders, and its structural
corruption and aggregation into amyloid oligomers and ﬁbrils are
believed to play causative roles in disease pathogenesis and progres-
sion [16, 17].
Here we describe the entire protocol to carry out in-cell NMR
on αSyn. To do so, we provide a simpliﬁed protocol for the rapid
isolation of a recombinant 15N-labelled N-terminally acetylated
αSyn suitable for in-cell NMR studies. As shown later (Fig. 1),
the protein obtained with this protocol contains few contaminants
and copurifying proteins. However, the amount and quality of the
αSyn produced with this method are suitable for in-cell NMR
experiments and an excellent signal-to-noise ratio is obtained. Sev-
eral protocols to purify recombinant αSyn to ultrapure levels have
been published elsewhere [18–20], and we strongly advise a pro-
found and comprehensive reading of those methods. Based on our
experience, using ultrapure αSyn for in-cell NMR experiments

improves the signal-to-noise ratio and therefore some structural
properties of this protein are enhanced. However, in-cell NMR
can be successfully carried out with the αSyn obtained with this
simpliﬁed protocol making this method ideal to guide researchers
in their ﬁrst in-cell NMR experiments. Based on our experience
with other IDP, this protocol can be also used to carry out in-cell
NMR on other IDP that can be puriﬁed following the same steps
described in this chapter for αSyn.
The protocol contains three major parts: (1) expression in
bacteria and rapid puriﬁcation of recombinant N15-labelled
N-terminally acetylated αSyn, (2) introduction of the obtained
recombinant αSyn into mammalian cells by electroporation and
preparation of the electroporated cells for the NMR determina-
tions, and (3) NMR measurements and data analyses. We also
include the assessment of cell leakage to conﬁrm that the obtained
NMR signals originate from proteins located inside the cells.

90–95% should be reached after 3–4 days.
3.2.2
αSyn Delivery by
Electroporation
1. Resuspend the lyophilized αSyn in 101 μL of sterile PBS. For
initial experiments, 10–20 mg of lyophilized αSyn is recom-
mended (see Note 13).
2. The protein is highly concentrated at this point but remains in
solution. Transfer 1 μL of protein solution to an Eppendorf
tube and add 300 μL of PBS. Add 15 μL of D2O and store it at
4 C. This sample will be analyzed by NMR immediately after
the in-cell NMR experiment and will be used as a reference
(αSyn in buffer).
3. Add 300 μL of electroporation buffer to the remaining 100 μL
of protein solution (see Note 14).
4. Split the 400 μL of protein solution into four equal fractions of
100 μL each. Use Eppendorf tubes for the fractions. Keep
them at RT.
5. The starting cell biomass required for electroporation equals to
four 15 cm culture dish at 90–95% of cell conﬂuence (around
1  107 cells). Take one 15 cm dish, and using an inverted
microscope (objectives 10 and 4), conﬁrm that the cells
look healthy by looking at the cell morphology and adherence
to the dish as they are indicative of cellular stress. Never use
cells with abnormal morphology. Wash the cells twice with
prewarmed sterile PBS.

9. Resuspend the cell suspension by pipetting up and down ten
times. Assist cell resuspension by passing the cells through a
sterile tube with a cell strainer snap cap (nylon-mesh ﬁlters with
around 150–300 μm pore size). Alternatively, the clumps of
cells can be disaggregated by passing the cell suspension
through a yellow tip of a P200 μL pipette (see Note 15).
10. Count the viable cells using the trypan blue exclusion test of
cell viability. Cell viability should be 85–95% and around
2.5  106 viable cells should have been harvested (see Note
16).
11. Transfer the 14 mL of cell suspension into one 15 mL
conical tube.
12. Repeat steps 5–11 with the remaining three culture dishes.
13. Centrifuge for 3 min at 300  g. Four cell pellets of around
180–200 μL should be obtained (Fig. 2a).
14. Discard the supernatant.
15. Cut the tip (3–5 mm) of a yellow tip of a P200 μL pipette to
increase the size of the oriﬁce (which should be now of
~1.5–2 mm of diameter) (see Note 14). Take 100 μL of protein
solution (contained in one Eppendorf tube) and add it to one
cell pellet (see the very important Note 17). Cell suspension
should be now ~300 μL.
16. Transfer 100 μL of the cell suspension into one electroporation
cuvette. Repeat it using two additional cuvettes. You should
have now three electroporation cuvettes containing 100 μL of
cells each.
17. Place the cuvette in the electroporator device (see Note 18).
Fig. 2 The number of cells is critical to increase the sensitivity of in-cell NMR experiments. (a) Four 90–95%
conﬂuent 15 cm plates of HEK-293 cells are harvested and centrifuged in 15 mL conical tubes. The image

18. Apply one pulse of electroporation to the cell suspension (see
Note 19).
19. Remove the cuvette from the electroporator and let it stand on
the bench for 1 min.
20. Repeat steps 18–20 with the two remaining cuvettes contain-
ing cells and protein.
21. After a ﬁrst electric pulse has been applied to all three cuvettes,
apply a second electric pulse to the three cuvettes by repeating
steps 17–19.
22. In order to remove the noninternalized αSyn, the cells must be
washed three times with DMEM. In a 50 mL conical tube, add
40 mL of prewarmed DMEM supplemented with 10% of FBS.
23. Gently transfer the electroporated cells from the three cuvettes
into the same 50 mL conical tube containing 40 mL of DMEM
using a Pasteur pipette.
24. Repeat steps 15–23 with the three remaining protein solutions
(100 μL each) and cell pellets.
25. Centrifuge for 3 min at 300  g at RT.
26. Discard the supernatant.
27. Add 40 mL of prewarmed DMEM supplemented with 10% of
FBS to the cell pellet and gently resuspend the cells by pipet-
ting up and down.
28. Repeat steps 25–27.
29. Centrifuge for 3 min at 300  g.
30. Add 10 mL of prewarmed DMEM supplemented with 10% of
FBS to the cell pellet and gently resuspend the cells by pipet-
ting up and down.
31. Transfer 5 mL of the cell suspension into two 15 cm culture
dishes containing 20 mL of prewarmed DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS.
32. Incubate at 37 C and 5% CO2 for 2–6 h. After this short
incubation, healthy cells attach to the plastic dish. Cell attach-
ment is indicative of cell integrity and viability. An attachment
of 95–99% of the cells is expected.
3.3
Cell Collection
and NMR
3.3.1
Cell Collection
1. The number of cells required for in-cell NMR should be such
that ~2 cm of the longitudinal axis of the NMR tube is ﬁlled
with gently compacted cells. This is the length of the active coil
of the spectrometer (see Note 20).
2. Take the two 15 cm culture dishes containing the electropo-
rated cells and look at the cells under the microscope. It is
important to check cell morphology and size of electroporated
cells. The morphology of electroporated HEK293 cells is
884

rounded, and the size is smaller than nonelectroporated cells.
Wash the cells twice with 10 mL of prewarmed sterile PBS.
3. Add 4 mL of prewarmed trypsin EDTA 0.05% solution to
each dish.
4. Incubate at 37 C and 5% CO2 for 2 min.
5. Add 10 mL of prewarmed DMEM supplemented with 10% of
FBS to the cells to each dish.
6. Resuspend the cell suspension by pipetting up and down ten
times.
7. Count the viable cells using the trypan blue exclusion test of
cell viability. Cell viability should be 90–95% and around
9  106 viable cells should be obtained.
8. Transfer the 28 mL (two dishes with 14 mL each) of cell
suspension into one 50 mL conical tube.
9. Centrifuge for 3 min at 300  g. A cell pellet of around
250–350 μL should be obtained (Fig. 2b).

times.
14. Centrifuge for 3 min at 300  g.
15. Discard the supernatant.
16. Add 200 μL of PBS and resuspend the cells gently.
17. Transfer the cell suspension into a NMR tube using a thin glass
pipette.
18. Centrifuge the NMR tube at 250  g for 2 min (see Note 22).
A cell pellet spanning ~2 cm along the longitudinal axis of the
tube should be obtained (Fig. 2c).
19. Discard the supernatant.
20. Insert the NMR tube plunger.
21. Seal the NMR tube and plunger with paraﬁlm and label the
tube indicating the experimental conditions.
3.3.2
Setting Up
the Spectrometer and NMR
Measurements (See Note
23)
1. Open a 1D 1H data set within the software TopSpin of the
NMR Bruker instrument by reading the Bruker parameter set
“zgpr” using the “readpar” command.
2. For in-cell NMR of αSyn, we use a temperature of 10 C
(283 K). In the Bruker TopSpin software, open the tempera-
ture control panel by typing the command “edte” and in the
dialog box “set” type a temperature of 283 K. Wait 5 min for
the spectrometer to stabilize (see Note 24).

3. Insert the NMR tube into the spinner, place it in such a way
that the sample is equally distributed through the NMR active
part of the tube using the Plexiglas device available from the
manufacturer, and insert it in the spectrometer by pressing the
“Lift ON–OFF” command before the tube is placed and
after this.
4. Automatically lock the sample: open the window to visualize
the lock signal by typing “lockdisp,” then type lock and select
in the solvents table “90% H2O and 10% D2O.”
5. Automatic tuning and matching: type “atma.” Further ﬁne-
tuning can be achieved with manual adjustment after typing
“atmm.” Make sure that the 15N channel is also tuned and
matched, if not type “edasp” and put 15N as the second channel
(f2).
6. Shimming: to visualize the shimming window type “topshim
gui.” Then type “topshim shigemi” as we are using Shigemi
NMR tubes. Check the initial and ﬁnal standard deviation, and
there should be a substantial improvement of the linear behav-
ior of the graph along the z-axis (of the sample). A good shim
can indirectly be probed by a good water suppression in the 1D
1H experiment that follows.
7. To set the 1H 90 hard pulse length, check the power attenua-
tion value in dB (pl1 in the parameter ﬁled opening upon
typing “ased”) and take the same value as used usually by
others. Similar, take a similar power for the water saturation
as in other experiments (“pl9”). Type “ns 1” (the number of
scans), followed by “rg 32” (receiver gain), followed by p1
1 (to set the pulse to 1 μs). Run an experiment by typing
“zg,” followed by “ft” to transform the spectrum and “apk”
for automatic phase correction (the phase correction can be
performed also manually).
Next, use a p1 value, which should be about four times of
the expected 90 hard pulse. Please be aware that this may
differ from spectrometer to spectrometer and is strongly
dependent on the salt content of your sample. Since the salt
content of the in-cell NMR sample is expected to be relatively
high, the pulse is longer than usual (a 90 hard pulse in the
order of 12–18 μs is to be expected). Thus, type “p1 60” is
followed by “zg” and “fp.” If the signal is positive, your pulse is
too long, and if the signal is negative, your pulse is too short.
Iteratively adjust the p1 value to minimize the signal as much as
possible. This is the 360 pulse length. A quarter of this is the
90 pulse length (denoted hpw90i at the power level in dB
hpoweri). If your protein/buffer signals are too weak to be
recorded, the 90 hard pulse must be determined through the
water frequency looking for a minimal free induction decay
(FID) for the 360 pulse. Note down the value.

8. The so fast 2D [15N,1H]-HMQC experiment is the choice for
the in-cell NMR experiment because only the electroporated
protein contains 15N. This experiment measures in a correlated
fashion both the 15N and 1H chemical shifts of every 15N–1H
moiety. Since these chemical shifts are sensitive to the structural
environment, the [15N,1H]-HMQC spectrum is regarded the
ﬁngerprint
of
a
protein’s
conformation.
Of
course,
a
15N-labelled sample is required (see earlier). This experiment
is available in the Bruker TopSpin catalog (see Note 25). Type
“rpar SF” and read the Bruker standard parameter set
SFHMQCF36PPH. The powers of the soft pulses used for
1H need to be adjusted by writing “getprosol 1H hpw90i
hpower in dBi” by using the values determined in 6 (e.g.,
“getprosol 1H 12-6” because the 90 hard pulse determined
in 6 is 12 μs at a power level of—6 dB). For the 15N pulse and
15N decoupling use values from other experiments or/and the
pulse list that should be available to you or the ones they got
adjusted by the command “getprosol.” Important for the
in-cell NMR experiments are the following: (a) interscan
delay d1 ¼ 0.3 s (by writing “d1 0.3 s”) and (b) 15N decou-
pling should be using a GARP sequence with a decoupling
pulse of 300–400 μs and accordingly set the decoupling
power. The number of data points along the 1H dimension
should be 1024–2048 real points, while along the 15N dimen-
sion 64–128 data points are recommended. The receiver gain
(“rg”) should be at least 64. The signal is rather low; thus, the
experimental length should be in the order of 2–4 h. Set the
number of scans accordingly with typical values 64 or 128 by
writing “ns 64” or “ns 128,” respectively. Measure a series of
4–8 experiments with a maximal measurement time of less than
24 h by using the “multizg” command, for example. You may
add up the spectra afterwards.
3.3.3
Spectrum
Visualization Basic Data
Analysis
1. After the NMR measurement is ﬁnished, a second experiment
must
be
carried
out
using
the
1
μL
of
recombinant
15N-labelled-αSyn dissolved in 300 μL of PBS (see step 1
from Subheading 3.2.2). Transfer the 317 μL of protein solu-
tion into a NMR Shigemi tube and follow the steps described
in Subheading 3.3.2.
2. After this experiment is ﬁnished in the TopSpin software, run
the command “xfb.”
3. Do phase correction.
4. Adjust the Fourier transformation, window function and line
broadening. Type “edp” window functions with Sin2 and an
SSB (Sine bell shift) of 2 or Exp window functions with 25 Hz
are recommended.

5. Carefully compare both spectra, the one obtained from the
cells electroporated with the N15-labelled αSyn with the one
obtained with the same protein in buffer.
6. In healthy cells, certain αSyn resonances should show decreased
intensity compared to the one obtained with the protein in
buffer. For instance, a quick visualization of this phenomenon
can be obtained by looking at the resonances of leucine 8 and
glycine 7, which are substantially less intense in the intracellular
αSyn compared to the protein in buffer (Fig. 3).
7. Carry out analyses on peak intensity and chemical shift differ-
ence using Sparky (see Note 26). Read carefully the manual of
the software Sparky to get familiar with the software.
3.3.4
Determination
of Cell Leakage
1. Since the integrity of the cell membrane could be compromised
during the NMR determinations (e.g., some cells could
undergo necrosis), it is highly recommendable to carry out a
test experiment to conﬁrm that the signal obtained in the
in-cell NMR experiments was originated from the intracellular
isotopically labelled protein. Immediately after the in-cell
NMR experiment is ﬁnished, centrifuge the NMR tube con-
taining the cells at 250  g for 2 min.

2. Transfer the conditioned media that locates at the top of the
cell pellet into an Eppendorf tube using a thin glass pipette (see
Note 27).
3. Add 280 μL of PBS and 15 μL of D2O to the recovered
conditioned media.
4. Run a new NMR experiment with this sample. Ideally the
experiment should be very similar to the one used in the
in-cell NMR measurements as it should reﬂect the contribution
of an externalized αSyn to the obtained spectra (see Note 28).
5. Check that no signals of αSyn are obtained with this sample.

Notes
1. Throughout this chapter, we refer to “in-cell NMR” as the
NMR measurements of isotopically labelled proteins expressed
or delivered into mammalian cells.
2. It is known that approximately 20% of human αSyn expressed
in E. coli is mistranslated and a cysteine in incorporated at
position 136 instead of a tyrosine [21]. This can be avoided
by using a TAC to TAT mutated codon 136. Sequence your
plasmid to check this.
3. This plasmid encodes the ﬁssion yeast NatB (N-terminal acet-
yltransferase B) complex and the genes that confer resistance to
chloramphenicol for positive selection in bacteria.
4. To clean used bottles: wash with a strong domestic detergent
or liquid soap (such as dish washer detergent), rinse the bottles
with extensive water till no traces of detergent are visible, wash
with ethanol 70% three times, rinse with MilliQ water.
5. Use 40 mL to resuspend each bacterial pellet. Avoid the for-
mation of bubbles while resuspending.
6. αSyn is released from the bacterial periplasm at this point.
7. Protein solution can be stored overnight at 4 C.
8. While most proteins precipitate, αSyn remains in solution at
this point.
9. Protein solution can be stored overnight at 4 C.
10. Note that percentage is NOT a measure of concentration here.
Instead, it refers to the level of AS saturation. Around 20 g of
AS is needed per 100 mL of solution.
11. While some proteins do, αSyn does not precipitate at 35% of AS
saturation.
12. Cells must be manipulated and grown under strict sterile con-
ditions. Reagents must be cell culture grade and cell manipula-
tions must be carried out inside a BSL2 biological safety

cabinet. Before adding to the cells, all liquid reagents (media,
trypsin, PBS, etc.) must be prewarmed to 37 C to avoid
uncontrolled temperature changes that can affect the cells.
13. The amount of lyophilized protein will be substantially reduced
once the operator gets familiar with the protocol and sensitivity
of the NMR measurements.
14. The electroporation buffer needs to be experimentally assayed
as it varies depending on the electroporation device used.
Likewise, the electroporation method (e.g., electroporation
using cuvette or using pipette tip chamber) has a strong inﬂu-
ence in the composition of the buffer. We used an electropora-
tor from AMAXA (model: AMAXA IIb), and a commercially
available buffer (Cell Line Nucleofector Kit R from Lonza).
But multiple buffers, including PBS for electroporation using
the pipette tip chamber method, can be also used.
15. A “yellow pipette tip” is the plastic tip that normally ﬁts most
P200 μL pipette. It actually does not matter which tip is used as
long as it has an oriﬁce of around 0.5–1 mm of diameter and no
less nor more. Passing the cells through smaller tips generates
cellular stress and mechanical cell damage, while clumps of cells
are not disaggregated properly when the cell suspension is
passed through bigger tips such as the light blue of P1000 μL
pipettes. To disaggregate these clumps, attach a yellow tip to
the end of a 10 mL plastic serological pipette. Cells are col-
lected into the serological pipette by applying vacuum and then
released (up-down pipetting). Do this procedure only once, as
it is stressful for the cells.
16. The trypan blue exclusion test is a method to quickly assay cell
viability. It is based on the fact that live cells have intact cell
membranes and the trypan blue dye is not absorbed when
added to the cells. In contrast to healthy cells, dying cells are
colored. The quantiﬁcation of the live-cells/death-cells ratio
can be carried out indistinctly either by counting the uncolored
and blue cells under the light microscope or by an automatic
cell counter.
17. It is extremely important to add the protein solution slowly to
the cells. It can be done by mixing the cells with the tip of the
pipette (i.e., following circular movements) while the protein
solution is released slowly. In this way, the cells get in contact
with the protein solution homogenously avoiding local high
concentrations.
18. We used an electroporator AMAXA IIb, set with the program
Q1.
19. The electric parameters for an efﬁcient electroporation need to
be experimentally determined in initial “set-up” experiments.
It can be done by electroporating nonlabelled recombinant
890
Juan A. Gerez et al.

αSyn into mammalian cells using different shapes, lengths, and
voltages of the electric pulse required for electroporation. After
electroporation, the cells are replated and kept in culture for
2–4 h, and then harvested to quantify the amount of αSyn
delivered into the cells by Western blot. We have successfully
tested several programs of the AMAXA IIb electroporator and
selected Q1 for our in-cell NMR experiments using HEK-293
cells.
20. If a Shigemi NMR tube of a diameter of 5 mm endowed with a
compact bottom of magnetic susceptibility matched glass of
~0.8 cm is used, the starting cell biomass required for the ﬁnal
in-cell NMR experiment can be obtained from two 15 cm
culture dishes at 90–95% of cell conﬂuence. This amount of
electroporated cells warrants that ~2 cm of this tube will be
ﬁlled with gently compacted cells.
21. In most in-cell NMR experiments, we normally use less than
10% of D2O to lock the signal. This is due to the fact that
adding hypotonic solutions such as D2O at such concentration
could potentially damage the cells irreversibly.
22. If a swing-out rotor is used, caution has to be taken as the tube
can break at this point due to the rotor leaning. To avoid this,
the angle of the rotor’s tube containers should be ﬁxed and
kept horizontal.
23. This protocol applies for Bruker instruments and software
(TopSpin,
Bruker,
https://www.bruker.com/service/sup
port-upgrades/software-downloads/nmr.html).
24. Make sure that the temperature was calibrated before starting
the experiment as the temperature can be off by several
degrees. For temperature calibration, use the protocol of the
instrument’s manufacturer (Bruker in our case).
25. We do not recommend to use a [15N,1H]-HSQC experiment
because it is much less sensitive due to the absence of longitu-
dinal relaxation enhancement.
26. Data analysis can be performed with alternative informatics
tools for NMR such as CcpNnm Analysis or CARA.
27. The amount of conditioned media recovered from the NMR
tube should be around 20–30 μL. If substantially more
conditioned media is recovered, caution must be taken as it
might indicate that a considerable amount of cells underwent
necrosis. Review your protocol carefully to minimize cellular
stress and therefore avoid cell death during the NMR
measurements.
28. Alternatively, an experiment with 5 scans can be carried out
to further conﬁrm absence of extracellular αSyn in the recov-
ered media.

Analyzing IDPs in Interactomes
Vladimir N. Uversky
Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs) are commonly found in all proteomes analyzed
so far. These proteins/regions are subject to numerous posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTMs) and
alternative splicing, are involved in a wide range of cellular functions, and often facilitate protein-protein
interactions (PPIs). Some of these proteins contain molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are
IDRs that bind to partner proteins and undergo disorder-to-order transitions. Although many IDPs/IDRs
can fold upon binding, a large fraction of these proteins are known to maintain signiﬁcant amounts of
disorder in their bound states. Being well-recognized interaction specialists, IDPs/IDRs can participate in
one-to-many and many-to-one interactions, where one IDP/IDR binds to multiple partners potentially
gaining very different structures in the bound state, or where multiple unrelated IDPs/IDRs bind to one
partner. As a result, IDPs frequently serve as hubs (i.e., proteins with many links) in complex PPI networks.
The goal of this chapter is to describe computational and bioinformatics tools that can be used to look at the
disorder status of proteins within a given PPI network and also to gain some knowledge on the disorder-
based functionality of the members of this network. To this end, description is provided for some of the use
of UniProt and DisProt databases, several databases generating PPI networks (BioGRID, IntAct, DIP,
MINT, HPRD, APID, KEGG, and STRING), Composition proﬁler, some tools for the per-residue
disorder predictions (PONDR® VLXT, PONDR® VL3, PONDR® VSL2, PONDR-FIT, and IUPred),
binary disorder classiﬁers CH-plot and CDF-plot and their combined CH-CDF analysis, web-based tools
for the visualization of disorder distribution in a query protein (D2P2 and MobiDB), as well as some tools
for evaluation disorder-based functionality of proteins (ANCHOR, MoRFpred, DEPP, and ModPred).

Introduction
The fact that disordered proteins might have important biological
functions is gaining broad acceptance by the scientiﬁc community
[1–7]. For more than a hundred years, researchers delved into
protein function from the perspectives of the classical protein
sequence-structure-function paradigm, with the “lock-and-key”
model being used as a mechanistic model explaining the origin of

protein functionality as a result of speciﬁc folding of a unique amino
acid sequence into a unique, highly structured state [8]. However,
such “gene–unique amino acid sequence–unique 3D structure–
unique function” consideration is expanded now to the “gene–
proteoforms (multiple sequences generated by alternative splicing,
alternative transcription initiation, mRNA editing, mutations, post-
translational modiﬁcations [PTMs])–conformational ensemble–
functional spectrum” model [9–11]. The discovery of intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs), in which bioinfor-
matics played a key role, has signiﬁcantly broadened the under-
standing
of
protein
functionality
and
revealed
a
new
and
unexpected role of dynamics, plasticity, and ﬂexibility in protein
function.
The existence of IDPs or hybrid proteins containing ordered
domains and IDRs cannot be ignored anymore, since such proteins
are highly abundant in nature, being commonly found in pro-
teomes of all kingdoms of life and in all viral proteomes analyzed
so far [1–7]. Furthermore, the vast majority of entries in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) contain IDRs [12]. In short, IDPs/
IDRs are biologically active proteins/regions that fail to form
speciﬁc three-dimensional structures and exist as highly dynamic
structural ensembles, either at the secondary or at the tertiary
structure level [4, 5, 13–18]. IDPs/IDRs may exist in collapsed
(where the intrinsic disorder is present in a molten globular form)
and extended forms (where intrinsic disorder is present in a form of
random coil or pre-molten globule) [4, 17, 19]. Furthermore,
proteins might also contain regions of semi-disorder; that is, frag-
ments that have ~50% predicted probability to be disordered or
ordered and that are shown to play key roles in protein aggregation
and participate in protein-protein interactions (PPIs), being able to
undergo binding-induced folding [20]. IDPs/IDRs (and proteins
in general) are characterized by a very complex and heterogeneous
spatiotemporal structural organization. Here, one can ﬁnd foldons
(independent foldable units of a protein), inducible foldons (disor-
dered regions that can fold at least in part due to the interaction
with binding partners), morphing inducible foldons (disordered
regions that can differently fold at interaction with different bind-
ing partners), non-foldons (non-foldable protein regions), semi-
foldons (regions that are always in a semi-folded form), and unfol-
dons (ordered regions that have to undergo an order-to-disorder
transition to become functional) [9, 21–23]. This structural orga-
nization represents an intricate mosaic-like “anatomy” of IDPs/
IDRs, which deﬁnes unique molecular “physiology” of these pro-
teins, where differently (dis)ordered structural elements might have
well-deﬁned and speciﬁc functions [11]. Thereby, they are deﬁning
a possibility of a protein molecule to be multifunctional and be
involved in interaction with, regulation of, and be controlled by
multiple structurally unrelated partners.

Since functionality and structural features of both ordered and
disordered proteins are somehow encoded in their amino acid
sequences, one can assume that codes used by ordered proteins
and domains are different from codes utilized by IDPs/IDRs. In
fact, based on the comparison of the amino acid sequences of
IDPs/IDRs with those of ordered proteins and domains it was
concluded that depending on their abundance in ordered and
disordered proteins and domains, the amino acids can be grouped
into order-promoting (C, F, I, L, F, N, V, W, Y), disorder-
promoting (A, E, G, K, P, Q, R, S) and ambiguous (D, H, M, T);
that is, residues found at equal propensity in ordered and disor-
dered regions/proteins [4, 24–27]. Furthermore, the existence of
speciﬁc biases in the IDP/IDR sequences was conﬁrmed by the
consideration of the higher-order patterns in amino acid sequence
space and via the analysis of the space of various physicochemical
properties [28]. Based on the detectable and recognizable sequence
features of IDPs/IDRs a multitude of IDP/IDR predictors was
developed, which are commonly used in the research of many
laboratories to provide important information on the abundance
of intrinsic disorder in various proteomes and also to generate
speciﬁc “disorder proﬁles” of query proteins showing distribution
of the intrinsic disorder predisposition within their sequences (see
[29–35] for recent reviews on various computational tools for
evaluating propensity of a given protein for intrinsic disorder).
Furthermore, specialized computational tools were designed to
search for regions with potential disorder-based functionality. In
fact, several such tools aiming at ﬁnding short regions (known as
molecular recognition features [MoRFs]) that undergo disorder-
to-order transitions on binding to their targets were developed
[36–44] based on the observations that short order-prone regions
embedded within the longer IDRs might correspond to binding
sites that fold upon complex formation [36, 45]. IDRs that are
likely to fold upon interacting with a globular binding partner can
be identiﬁed by ANCHOR [46, 47]. Recent comprehensive
surveys of MoRF predictors and methods for the ﬁnding of poten-
tial short protein-binding linear motifs, disordered protein-binding
regions, and semi-disordered regions revealed that modern MoRF
predictors
accurately
ﬁnd
experimentally
annotated
MoRFs
[48, 49]. Protein segments potentially interacting with speciﬁc
partners or acting as sites subjected to different PTMs can be
identiﬁed by tools searching for Short Linear Motif (SLiM) or
Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) [50]. Another approach is given
by DisoRDPbind, which is a computational method for high-
throughput prediction of multiple functions of disordered regions
that can be used to predict the RNA-, DNA-, and protein-binding
residues located in IDPs/IDRs in the input protein sequences
[51, 52]. Since sites of many enzyme-catalyzed PTMs (e.g., phos-
phorylation [53], acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination
Intrinsic Disorder in Protein Interactomes
897

[54]), are commonly located within the IDRs, the computational
tools for ﬁnding such PTM sites were developed. Examples of these
tools are given by DisPhos (disorder-enhanced phosphorylation
predictor [DEPP]) [53], a tool for prediction of S-palmitoylation
sites [55] and a uniﬁed sequence-based predictor of 23 types of
PTM sites [54].
For their functions, all proteins are involved in various interac-
tions (i.e., speciﬁc physical contacts that have functional conse-
quences). Binding partners for a given protein range from
substrates and cofactors, to other proteins, peptides, nucleic acids,
polysaccharides, various small molecules, lipids, etc. Often, protein
function is controlled and regulated by such interactions, and
cellular functionality of proteins is traditionally described as speciﬁc
pathways representing a series of events based on communication
between molecules that result, for example, in biosynthesis of
speciﬁc products. An alternative way of understanding the com-
plexity of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is given by mapping
them into speciﬁc PPI networks or interactomes. Interactomes are
more complex than canonical biochemical pathways and include
massive complementary information that reveals a multitude of
links (or interactions) of each of the protein included in a given
network. Such PPI networks represent an important means for the
visualization of the peculiarities of protein-to-protein communica-
tion and the illustration of the complexity of the molecular relation-
ships in a living cell [56]. Therefore, representing multitude of
cellular PPIs in a form of speciﬁc PPI networks opens a gateway
into systems biology, helping in better understanding of the inte-
gration of biochemical and biophysical characteristics of proteins
into biological systems [57].
Interactomes are PPI networks with complex topologies, where
proteins are depicted as nodes (or vertices) and PPIs are shown as
links or connections (or edges) between these nodes. Cellular PPI
networks are typical examples of “scale-free” or “small-world” net-
works [58], with the distribution of the connectivity of nodes (also
known as degree, which is the number of adjacent links for a given
node) following a power law [59]. In such networks, some nodes
(ends) are connected only to one other node, and most nodes have
just a few links. However, networks also contain several highly
connected nodes (hubs), the degrees of which greatly exceed the
network average degree value, which typically is in a range between
2 and 8 [58, 60, 61] (see Note 1 for the discussion of the hub
deﬁnition). Based on timing of their action within PPI networks,
hubs can be classiﬁed as “party hubs” (i.e., hubs that have multiple,
simultaneous interactions and thereby act as scaffolds enabling the
assembly of functional modules) or “date hubs” (i.e., hubs engaged
in multiple sequential interactions [62] and thereby connecting
biological modules to each other [63]). Irrespective of the timing
of their action, hubs are engaged in a multitude of interactions with
898
Vladimir N. Uversky

multiple partners, often utilizing “one-to-many” interaction mode.
Such binding promiscuity is determined by the utilization of pro-
tein intrinsic disorder by at least one side of the hub-partners
system, where a disordered hub binds ordered partners, or ordered
hub interacts with disordered partners, or hub and its partners are
all intrinsically disordered [64–66].
This chapter represents an update of the previously published
protocols for predicting disorder in a protein of interest [67]. It
provides a guideline on how to analyze disorder status and
disorder-based functionality of the members of a PPI network.
Currently, numerous computational tools are available for predic-
tion of both the intrinsic disorder propensity of a protein of interest
and for ﬁnding at least some of its disorder-based functions. Tech-
niques described here are techniques of “convenience” and “habit”
that are routinely used in my laboratory for the analysis of protein
intrinsic disorder. Therefore, by no means, selection of these tools
reﬂects their superiority over many other computational tools that
can be utilized for the analysis of intrinsic disorder.

13. PONDR® VLXT predictor is described in Romero et al. [24]
and is available from http://www.pondr.com/ and from
http://www.disprot.org/metapredictor.php.
PONDR®
VLXT is composed of three neural networks, two for the
termini of the sequence and one for internal region. The ﬁnal
output is an average over
the outputs of three aforemen-
tioned neural networks. The inputs of the neural networks
are residue composition-related quantities [24]. Being one of
the ﬁrst disorder predictors, PONDR® VLXT is characterized
by high sensitivity to local sequence peculiarities associated
with disorder-based interaction sites [4]. Although it is not
the most accurate predictor, it is useful for predicting MoRFs,
which are short disordered regions able to fold at interaction
with binding partners.
14. PONDR® VL3 is described in Peng et al. [82] and is available
from http://www.pondr.com/ and from http://www.disprot.
org/metapredictor.php. This predictor employs majority-
voting over several neural networks, which also take sequence
composition,
complexity,
and
entropy
as
the
inputs
[82]. PONDR® VL3 is better for proteins that are 100%
disordered and for long IDRs.
15. PONDR® VSL2 is described in Obradovic et al. [83] and
Peng et al. [84] and is available from http://www.pondr.
com/ and from http://www.disprot.org/metapredictor.php.
Its training set is 1335 nonredundant protein sequences, con-
taining 230 long disordered regions with 25,958 residues,
983 short disordered regions with 9632 residues, and
354,169 ordered residues [83, 84]. PONDR® VSL2 is built
up on support vector machine with sequence composition,
Intrinsic Disorder in Protein Interactomes
901

evolution information, and predicted secondary structure as
the inputs [83, 84]. This predictor is statistically better for
proteins containing both structure and disorder. For a long
time, PONDR® VSL2 was one of the more accurate stand-
alone disorder predictors [82, 85, 86].
16. The metapredictor PONDR-FIT is described in Xue et al.
[87]
and
is
available
from
http://www.disprot.org/
metapredictor.php. PONDR-FIT combines six individual pre-
dictors
(PONDR®
VLXT
[24],
PONDR®
VSL2
[82],
PONDR® VL3 [84], FoldIndex [88], IUPred [89], TopIDP
[90]). It is moderately more accurate than each of the compo-
nent predictors [87]. Being statistically not different from
PONDR® VL3 for fully disordered and fully structured pro-
teins, this metapredictor is slightly better (1 standard devia-
tion) than PONDR® VSL2 when both structure and disorder
are present.
17. IUPred is available from http://iupred2a.elte.hu. This predic-
tor is described in Dosztanyi et al. [89] and Meszaros et al.
[91]. IUPred represents a tool for predicting IDRs from amino
acid sequences by estimating their total pairwise inter-residue
interaction energy, based on the assumption that disordered
sequences do not fold due to their inability to form sufﬁcient
stabilizing inter-residue interactions [89, 91]. This tool can
predict short or long IDR based on the built-in optimized
parameter sets [89, 91].
18. Charge-hydropathy (CH)-plot predictor is available from
http://www.pondr.com/. The basic algorithm of this binary
classiﬁer is described in Uversky et al. [15]. For a query protein,
CH-plot represents a dependence of its absolute, mean net
charge—excluding histidine—on the mean Kyte-Doolittle-
scaled hydropathy [92]. The hydropathy measure is scaled
between 0 and 1. The results of this analysis show that
extended IDPs are speciﬁcally localized within a unique region
of CH phase space, where ordered proteins and IDPs can be
separated by a linear boundary.
19. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis is another
binary disorder classiﬁer available from http://www.pondr.
com/. This predictor is described in Dunker et al. [93] and
Oldﬁeld et al. [94]. In this analysis, data for a query protein are
shown in a form of a CDF curve that summarizes the
per-residue predictions by plotting PONDR scores against
their cumulative frequency, which allows ordered and disor-
dered proteins to be distinguished based on the distribution of
prediction scores. According to the CDF analysis, fully disor-
dered proteins have very low percentage of residues with low
predicted disorder scores, as the majority of their residues
902
Vladimir N. Uversky

possess high predicted disorder scores. On the contrary, the
majority of residues in ordered proteins are predicted to have
low disorder scores. Hence, theoretically, all the fully disor-
dered proteins should stay at the lower right corner of the
CDF-plot, whereas all the fully ordered proteins should be
located at the upper left corner of this plot [93, 94].
20. Database
of
Disordered
Protein
Predictions
(D2P2)
is
described in Oates et al. [95] and is available from http://
d2p2.pro/. D2P2 represents information on pre-computed
disorder predictions for 10,429,761 proteins from 1765 com-
pleted genomes from 1256 distinct species. Here, disorder is
predicted using nine disorder predictors (PONDR® VLXT,
PONDR® VSL2b, PrDOS, PV2, ESpritz-DisProt, Espritz-
XRay,
Espritz-NMR,
IUPred-Long,
and
IUPred-Short).
D2P2-generated proﬁle also includes SCOP domain predic-
tions from SUPERFAMILY predictor, as well as positions of
the ANCHOR-identiﬁed potential disorder-based binding
regions (see below) and various PTM sites [95].
21. A database of intrinsically disordered and mobile proteins,
MobiDB, is described in Di Domenico et al. [96] and Potenza
et al. [97] and is available from http://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/
and via the related link at UniProt (http://web.expasy.org/
docs/swiss-prot_guideline.html). MobiDB provides disorder
predictions for all UniProt entries using the following disorder
predictors: DisEMBL-465, DisEMBL-HL, ESpritz-DisProt,
Espritz-XRay, Espritz-NMR, GlobPlot, IUPred, Jronn, and
PONDR® VSL2b).
22. ANCHOR and associated with it disorder predictor IUPred
are available from http://iupred2a.elte.hu. ANCHOR is
described in Dosztanyi et al. [46, 47]. This tool relies on the
pairwise energy estimation approach representing the basis of
IUPred (see above). Disordered binding regions are identiﬁed
as segments located within IDR, that cannot form enough
favorable intra-chain interactions to fold independently, and
that are likely to gain stabilizing energy by interacting with a
globular protein partner [46, 47].
23. MoRFpred is described in Disfani et al. [39] and is available
from
http://biomine-ws.ece.ualberta.ca/MoRFpred/index.
html. MoRFpred predicts the presence of MoRFs in a sequence
based on the sequence-based features that provide information
on evolutionary proﬁles, selected physiochemical properties of
amino acids, predicted disorder, solvent accessibility, and B-
factors [39].

24. DisPhos predictor also known as disorder-enhanced phos-
phorylation predictor (DEPP) is described in Iakoucheva
et al. [53] and is available from http://www.pondr.com/.
DEPP was trained on over 1500 experimentally conﬁrmed
protein phosphorylation sites. It uses disorder information to
discriminate between phosphorylation and nonphosphoryla-
tion sites. The accuracy of DEPP reaches 76.0  0.3%,
81.3  0.3%, and 83.3  0.3% for serine, threonine, and
tyrosine, respectively [53].
25. ModPred is available from www.modpred.org and is described
in Pejaver et al. [54]. It is a uniﬁed sequence-based predictor of
23 types of PTM sites that was trained on 278,703 experimen-
tally validated sites. These sites were found in 54,484 proteins
from 3219 species. ModPred uses observations that proteins
statistically enriched in multiple types of PTM sites show high
prevalence of intrinsic disorder and that protein sites modiﬁed
by more than one type of PTM, referred to as shared PTM
sites, show even stronger preferences toward IDRs than their
single-PTM counterparts [54].

the MINT/UniProt ID of a query protein. This will bring you
to the MINT page containing information related to the query
protein.
3. The default view at the MINT database is the Evidence List,
where all the information related to the PPIs of a query protein
is assembled in a table form showing names of interacting
Genes A and B, Interaction Type, Detection Methods, and
corresponding PubMed publication. For each interacting pair,
additional information such as biological and experimental
(bait or prey) roles of a query protein and its interactor, anno-
tation of interactions, interactor type, stoichiometry for a query
protein and its interactor, can be viewed by hitting the “+”
button in the Details column.
4. MINT-based PPI network can be viewed by hitting the “Inter-
action Network” link. The view of this network can be
changed using different layouts available for the corresponding
drop-down menu (compact, moderate, or relaxed). The type of
layout is obviously dependent on the size of the retrieved PPI
network, where relaxed layout will be more suitable for rela-
tively small networks, and large networks are better seen using
compact layout. This network can be saved or exported using
the corresponding links located at the top panel of the plot.
3.2.6
Using HPRD
to Retrieve a PPI Network
for a Query Protein
1. Access HPRD using the http://www.hprd.org/ link.
2. From a menu of available actions (left side), select Query link
and type in Protein Name into the corresponding window.
Before hitting the “Search” button, you can also add other
information on this page, such as accession number (in RefSeq,
Genbank, OMIM, SwissProt, or Entrez gene databases),
HPRD Identiﬁer, Gene Symbol, Chromosome Locus, Molec-
ular Class (can be selected with provided list), Cellular Com-
ponent (can be selected with provided list), Domain Name (can
be selected with provided list), Motif (can be selected with
provided list), Expression (can be selected with provided list),
Length of Protein Sequence, Molecular Weight, and Diseases.
This will bring you to the results page. The default view here is
SUMMARY, showing some general data such as HPRD ID,
Gene Symbol, Molecular Weight, Gene Map Locus, Cellular
Localization, Expression. This page also contains a wide range
of information related to the query protein, which can be
accessed by hitting the corresponding links (e.g., ALTERNA-
TIVE NAMES, DISEASES, PTMs & SUBSTRATES,
INTERACTIONS).
3. PPI information can be retrieved using the INTERACTIONS
link. If the protein has several known isoforms, isoform-related
information can be also retrieved by using GO TO window in
the upper right corner.

Using KEGG
to Search for PPI Networks
(or Pathways) Associated
with a Query Protein
1. Access KEGG database using the https://www.genome.jp/
kegg/ link.
2. Type in Protein Name into the corresponding window and
then hit “Search” button. On the next page, look for the
KEGG ID (e.g., K04528) corresponding to the desired protein
within the KEGG ORTHOLOGY section (which is a set of
manually deﬁned orthologous groups corresponding to the
nodes of the KEGG pathway maps or the nodes of the
BRITE functional hierarchies) and hit it. On the result page,
you will ﬁnd information related to the query protein. On the
right-hand top corner of this page, you will see “All links” box.
Look for the KEGG PATHWAY link there and use it to go to a
page containing a list of pathways associated with your query
protein. Select a pathway you are interested in, which will give
you an access to an interactive map (see Fig. 2).
3.2.8
Using STRING
to Search for PPI Network
of a Query Protein
1. Start with the UniProtKB entry page corresponding to the
protein of interest (see Subheading 3.1). On this entry page,
look for a blue bar containing link to Interaction and hit
this link.
2. Look
for
the
“Protein-protein
interaction
databases”
header, ﬁnd “STRING,” and hit blue number corresponding
to the MINT/UniProt ID of a query protein. This will bring
you to the MINT page containing information related to the
query protein. You can also access STRING databases directly
using the https://string-db.org/ link.
3. Default view on this page is a PPI network centered at the
query protein (which is shown as a red colored node) contain-
ing ten differently colored nodes from the ﬁrst shell interactors
(see Note 7) with several links at the bottom. Please note that
nodes of the ﬁrst shell are colored arbitrarily. Proteins with
known structure are shown as ﬁlled nodes (a small structural
image is inserted in the corresponding node), whereas empty
nodes correspond to proteins with unknown structure. The
active Legend button is used as default. It provides detailed
description of the resulting network, providing information on
the presentation peculiarities of modes (see above) and edges
(such as color of known or predicted PPIs), and a list of pre-
dicted functional partners. Your protein might contain more
than ten interactors (see Note 7). To extend the network, you
should use Settings button, where you can change the mean-
ing of the network edges (selecting between evidence-based,
conﬁdence-based, and molecular action), as well as change the
used sources of information on active interactions, conﬁdence
levels (default: medium conﬁdence [0.400]), and maximal
number of interactors to show (default: ﬁrst shell: no more
than ten interactors; second shell: none). The use of the highest

conﬁdence of 0.900 is recommended as this will give you the
most reliable data (see Note 8). It can be selected from the
drop-down menu within the minimum required interaction
score section. To include the maximal number of interactors
from the ﬁrst shell, in the max number of interactors to show
section, in the “ﬁrst shell” subsection, select custom value
from the drop-down menu and type in 500 (which is the
maximal number of interactors in STRING) in the “max inter-
actors” subsection. Hit the UPDATE button in the top right
corner.
The
resulting
network
will
contain
nodes
corresponding to the interactors deﬁned with highest conﬁ-
dence of 0.900. This network can be analyzed using the Anal-
ysis button and exported in different forms (as a graphic ﬁle in
different formats or as various text/table ﬁle) using the
Exports button. The STRING-generated network can be fur-
ther extended by including interactors from the second shell.
3.2.9
Using APID
to Search for PPI Network
of a Query Protein
1. Access APID using the http://apid.dep.usal.es/ link.
2. Select Search: ONE PROTEIN option from a menu of avail-
able actions located at the top of the page.
3. Type in Protein Name into the corresponding window and
then hit “Search” button. Please note that UniProt Name
(e.g., “SYUA_HUMAN”), UniProt ID (e.g., “P37840”), or
ENTREZ Gene Symbol (e.g., “SNCA”) should be used here.
At this page, you can also select an organism from the drop-
down menu in the Select Organism button. Next page will
give you a list of potential targets. Select the one you are
interested in. For this target protein, you can select one of
the three options of the visualization of results (Interactions,
Raw curated Events, or Network [see Note 9]). These
options are available from the Display RESULTS actions
located at the top of the page. When Network option is
selected, a new page will open showing the resulting PPI
network for a query protein. Similar to other network data-
bases, APID provides a possibility to change the Network
layouts. The user can choose between Grid (represents a
network in a form of grid), Circle (places all the nodes on the
circle), Concentric (positions nodes in concentric circles,
where nodes with low degrees are placed on the outermost
sphere and nodes with high degrees are placed on the inner-
most sphere), Arbor (an active layout that groups proteins by
their connectivity), and Cose layouts. Large PPI network is
better visualized using Grid layout, whereas Circle and Con-
centric layouts are more suitable for small networks. Arbor is a
useful layout mode that can reveal protein complexes within
PPI networks. On this page with the visualization web-tool,
one can also ﬁnd options for ﬁltering resulting PPI network

based on the amount of experimental evidence, coloring pro-
teins of interest in the network, manual rearrangement of the
nodes, network expansion, as well as several export options.
Working with the APID-generated PPI network is rather intui-
tive. APID provides very informative HELP page accessible
using About APID button in the top panel of the visualization
web-tool.
3.2.10
Advantages
and Limitations
of the Different Network
Tools
It is clear that all the network tools presented here have advantages
and limitations. Although UniProtKB is a place to go for everyone
interested in various information related to a query protein,
although one can ﬁnd a list of binary interactions for a query
protein there, and although UniProtKB provides links to other
network tools, the major limitation of this database is the lack of
means for generating an actual PPI map. Furthermore, data pre-
sented in this subsection of the Interaction section of UniProtKB
are limited to a quality-ﬁltered subset of binary interactions auto-
matically derived from the IntAct database. However, one can
expect that the data reported here on binary interactions are rather
reliable (they are based on the experimentally validated interactions
from IntAct). Although other tools discussed in this section (Bio-
GRID, IntAct, DIP, MINT, and HPRD) are primary databases of
molecular interactions and are therefore carefully curated, and
although they can represent PPIs as PPI networks with various
layouts, the content of these databases is rather limited. This
means that information on the less studied query proteins could
be absent in these databases. Since APID represents the merged
PPI information from BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, IntAct, and MINT,
it covers more PPIs than each of these individual primary databases.
However, one might experience problems accessing APID from the
nonpersonal accounts. Furthermore, the graphic output of this
platform is rather simple. The advantage of KEGG is the depth of
its coverage of PPIs and the hierarchal organization of this data-
base, which contains multiple pathway maps associated with various
physiological and pathological processes. The major limitation of
KEGG is assumed association of a query protein with one or several
predeﬁned and manually drawn pathway maps. Obviously, if a
query protein is not included into such maps, its PPI-related infor-
mation will not be available at KEGG. Finally, because the PPI
networks generated by STRING are visually very appealing, and
because this database contains information on both experimentally
validated and predicted PPIs, the use of this platform is highly
recommended.
3.3
Generating PPIs
for a Set of Query
Proteins
Sections below provide two protocols for building a PPI network
for a set of several query proteins.

Vladimir N. Uversky

3.3.1
Using STRING
to Generate a PPI Network
for a Set of Query Proteins
1. https://string-db.org/cgi/input.pl?sessionId¼dHsc24Opgpr
o&input_page_show_search¼onlink can be used to access the
search page of STRING platform, where “Multiple proteins”
option should be selected from the menu located on the left
side of a page. Place the list of names in the corresponding
window and hit the “SEARCH” button at the bottom of the
screen. Several next screens will ask for additional information.
Carefully analyze their content and make necessary decisions
(see Note 10). Progression between these pages is driven by
hitting the “CONTINUE” button. The default network for a
set of query proteins includes only these query proteins. This
can be changed using multiple options available at the Settings
bar. These options are similar to those described in Subheading
3.2.8. The only difference here with the Settings for a single
protein is the presence of “none/query proteins only” option
within the “ﬁrst shell” subsection of the max number of
interactors to show section. Figure 3 shows a STRING-
generated network for several proteins, which, according to
UniProt, are involved in interaction with human α-synuclein.
In addition to the corresponding query proteins this network
includes nodes from the ﬁrst shell.
3.3.2
Using APID
to Generate a PPI Network
for a Set of Query Proteins
1. Access APID database using the http://apid.dep.usal.es/ link.
2. Select Search: LIST OF PROTEINS option from a menu of
available actions located at the top of the page.
3. In the provided List of proteins (one per line): window, type
in protein names and then hit “Search” button. Please note
that UniProt Name (e.g., “SYUA_HUMAN”), UniProt ID
(e.g., “P37840”), or ENTREZ Gene Symbol (e.g., “SNCA”)
should be used here. At this page, you can also select an
organism from the drop-down menu in the Select Organism
button. Next page will give you a list of proteins. Select all the
proteins from your query set and use Build NETWORK with
selected proteins button. A new page will open showing the
resulting PPI network for a set of query proteins. The available
network layouts include Grid, Circle, Concentric, Arbor, and
Cose. The user can modify the resulting PPI network for a set
of query proteins using options similar to those described in
Subheading 3.2.9. Figure 4 represents an APID-generated PPI
network for the same proteins as in Subheading 3.3.1.

and functional information related to a protein of interest.
Although numerous predictors of intrinsic disorder are currently
available, this chapter will focus on utilization of PONDR® tools
and two databases, D2P2 and MobiDB, as they cover a wide range
of potential applications of intrinsic disorder concept for structural

and functional analysis of proteins. Obviously, this analysis could
have been carried out with many other disorder predictors.
Since analysis of PPI networks potentially involves gathering
information on large datasets, it is recommended to conduct
corresponding analyses at two levels: (1) looking at the overall
disorder status of all the members of network; and (2) focusing
on more detailed characterization of several selected proteins (these
could be query proteins, most disordered interactors, and/or hubs;
see Note 1).
3.4.1
Looking
at the Global Disorder
Status of All the Members
of a PPI Network Protein
Analysis of Protein Amino
Acid Composition: Applying
Compositional Proﬁler Tool
to Obtain Fractional Amino
Acid Composition of a
Query Protein
IDPs and IDRs show low content of order-promoting residues
(C, W, V, F, Y, L, I, and M) and high content of disorder-
promoting residues (Q, S, P, E, K, G, and A [4, 24, 98]). Therefore,
the overall disorder status in a protein or a group of proteins can
be evaluated by a simple analysis of their amino acid composition
biases
using
the
fractional
difference
in
amino
acid
approach [4]. Here, the fractional difference is calculated as
( f(r) – forder(r))/forder(r), where r ∈{A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L,
M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y}, f(r) is the frequency of residue r in a
given protein set, and forder(r) is the frequency of residue r in the
reference set of globular proteins, and plotted for each amino acid.
The plotting is done using the Composition proﬁler [69]. In the
resulting graph, negative bars correspond to amino acids that are
underrepresented in a given protein (or a protein dataset) in com-
parison with the set of ordered proteins, whereas positive bars
reﬂect the relative increase in the particular amino acid content in
a query protein (or a set of query proteins). Step-by-step protocol
for the use of the Composition proﬁler is given below.

α-synuclein (SYUA_HUMAN), such as SNCAP-2_HUMAN, ABL1-2_HUMAN, SC6A3_HUMAN, GSK3B_HUMAN,
HD_HUMAN, TAU-8_HUMAN, 1433F_HUMAN, ABL1-1_HUMAN, LRRK2_HUMAN, SYN1_HUMAN, COX3_HU-

1. Retrieve sequence information for all the proteins using Uni-
Prot, as described in Subheading 3.1.
2. Start the Composition proﬁler by typing http://www.cproﬁler.
org/ in the Internet browser and hit Run Proﬁler link located
at the top right corner of the front page.
3. Paste sequences of your proteins in the Query Sample window
located on the left side of the window. In the Background
Sample window (also located on the left side of the window),
chose Dataset and select PDB select 25 from the drop-down
list. Find Output Options on the right side of the window,
chose Ordering, and select Flexibility (Vihinen) from the
drop-down list. Click Draw Proﬁle link located in a gray bar
at the bottom of the Output Options section. The resulting
page will contain a plot showing the fractional amino acid
composition of a query protein and a table listing statistical
parameters of this analysis.
4. If numerical values instead of plot are needed, step 3 should be
modiﬁed as follows. Paste the sequences of your protein into
the Query Sample window located on the left side of the
window. In the Background Sample window (also located
on the left side of the window), chose Dataset and select
PDB select 25 from the drop-down list. Find Output Options
on the right side of the window and chose Output format,
where TXT (raw data) should be selected from the drop-
down list. Then, chose Ordering and select Flexibility (Vihi-
nen) from the drop-down list. Click Draw Proﬁle link located
in a gray bar at the bottom of the Output Options section. The
resulting page will now contain raw data in tabulated form,
where ﬁrst column represents single character residue name,
second column shows calculated values of the fractional differ-
ence, and the third column gives errors.
5. To obtain compositional proﬁle of typical IDPs (which is a
recommended step in order to get reference plot), step 3
should be modiﬁed as follows. In the Query Sample window
located on the left side of the window, chose Dataset and select
DisProt 3.4 from the drop-down list. In the Background Sam-
ple window (also located on the left side of the window), chose
Dataset and select PDB select 25 from the drop-down list. Find
Output Options on the right side of the window, chose Order-
ing, and select Flexibility (Vihinen) from the drop-down list.
Click Draw Proﬁle link located in a gray bar at the bottom of
the Output Options section. The resulting page will contain a
plot showing the fractional amino acid composition of typical
disordered proteins and a table listing statistical parameters of
this analysis.

6. If numerical values are needed instead of a plot, step 5 should
be modiﬁed as follows. In the Query Sample window located
on the left side of the window, chose Dataset and select Dis-
Prot 3.4 from the drop-down list. In the Background Sample
window (also located on the left side of the window), chose
Dataset and select PDB select 25 from the drop-down list. Find
Output Options on the right side of the window and chose
Output format, where TXT (raw data) should be selected
from the drop-down list. Then, chose Ordering and select
Flexibility (Vihinen) from the drop-down list. Click Draw
Proﬁle link located in a gray bar at the bottom of the Output
Options section. The resulting page will now contain raw data
in tabulated form, where ﬁrst column represents single charac-
ter residue name, second column shows calculated values of the
fractional difference, and the third column gives errors.
7. To plot the compositional proﬁle of query proteins in compar-
ison with the corresponding proﬁle of typical IDPs, use numer-
ical data from steps 4 and 6. Although the order of residues
you retrieved from Compositional proﬁler follows the Vihi-
nen’s ﬂexibility scale (ref), for better visual representation resi-
dues should be ranged as follows: C, W, I, Y, F, L, H, V, N,
M, R, T, D, G, A, K, Q, S, E, and P; i.e., from the most order-
promoting at the left to the most disorder-promoting at the
right (see Fig. 5).
Using CH-Plot and CDF
Binary Predictors
and a Combined CH-CDF
Approach
The overall disorder status in a given protein can be evaluated by
binary predictors; i.e., tools that classify a query protein as mostly
ordered or mostly disordered. These binary predictors are the
CH-plot [94, 99] and the CDF-plot [31, 94, 100]. Ultimately,
the results from the two binary predictors yielded can be combined
to conduct a CH-CDF analysis; see below [100–102].
The two binary predictors differ such that the CH-plot is a
linear classiﬁer that only assesses two parameters of a sequence, such
as charge and hydropathy, whereas the CDF-plot is a nonlinear
classiﬁer
that
assesses
the
PONDR
score
yielded
by
the
per-residue disorder predictor. The CH-plot output allows for
possible discrimination between proteins that contain extended
disorder, which include native coils and native pre-molten globules,
and those that present compact structural components, which
include
native
molten
globules
and
ordered
proteins.
The
CDF-plot analysis makes use of its PONDR-based per-residue
disorder assessment to appropriately distinguish mostly ordered
proteins from mostly disordered proteins and proteins that show
a mixture of disordered and ordered segments. When the two
binary predictors, CH-plot and CDF-plot, are combined, the
corresponding CH-CDF plot can be used for discrimination of
proteins
with
extended
disorder

pre-molten globules) from proteins with mixed topological features
or native molten globules as well as from mostly ordered proteins.
1. Go to the ofﬁcial PONDR® site by typing http://www.pondr.
com/ in the Internet browser. Locate and click PREDICT
DISORDER link at the top left corner of the major PONDR
page. This will bring you to the PONDR® working page.
2. While
on
the
PONDR®

page,
select
boxes
corresponding to PONDR VLXT and the desired binary Pre-
dictors (CDF and Charge-Hydropathy; see Note 11). When
the Charge-Hydropathy box is marked, two new boxes (From:

the space provided (optional). Enter NCBI Accession Code or
Protein Sequence (FASTA format or sequence only) in the
Fig. 5 Fractional difference in the amino acid composition between the proteins associated with different
forms of programmed cell death (apoptosis, orange bars; autophagy, dark yellow bars; and necroptosis, dark
green bars) and a set of ordered/structured proteins calculated for each amino acid residue (compositional
proﬁles). The fractional difference was evaluated as (Cx  Corder)/Corder, where Cx is the content of a given
amino acid in a query set, and Corder is the corresponding content in the dataset of fully ordered proteins.
Composition proﬁle of typical IDPs from the DisProt database is shown for comparison (black bars). Positive
bars correspond to residues found more abundantly in proteins related to the programmed cell death, whereas
negative bars show residues in which proteins associated with the programmed cell death are depleted.
Amino acid types are ranked according to their increasing disorder-promoting potential [117]. This plot is
based on data published in Peng et al. [118]. Data for this proﬁle were generated using Composition proﬁler

Raw Output at the Output Options section. Clicking Submit
Query will bring you to the PONDR® results page.
3. CDF analysis. Second plot at the PONDR® data page repre-
sents the results of CDF analysis (see Fig. 6a as an example).
Remember that the CDF analysis summarizes the per-residue
disorder predictions by plotting PONDR scores against their
cumulative frequency, which allows ordered and disordered
proteins to be distinguished based on the distribution of the
corresponding prediction scores [93, 94]. In this case, the
binary ordered-disordered classiﬁcation of a whole protein is
based on the positioning of the corresponding CDF curve
(green curve at the screen) relative to the boundary line
(thick black line with seven boundary points; see Note 12).
Here, if the curve is located below the majority of the boundary
points, then entire protein is predicted to be mostly disordered,
whereas if the CDF curve is above the majority of the boundary
points, then the analyzed protein is mostly ordered. Raw data
to reproduce this plot (results for your protein and boundary)
are in the CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION
(CDF) OUTPUT section. For each protein in your dataset,
you need to calculate the CDF distance, ΔCDF, which is a
mean distance between the corresponding CDF-plot and a
boundary
that
can
be
calculated
as

at a point “i” (with X ¼ 0.60, 0.65, 070, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, and
0.90; see Note 13, for example, calculations).
4. CH-plot analysis. The last ﬁgure at the PONDR® results page
shows the CH-plot [15]. This plot utilizes observation that
compact and highly disordered proteins plotted in the
CH-space can be separated from each other, with proteins
located above this boundary being IDPs (red circles) while
proteins located below the boundary line being compact
(blue squares [see Fig. 6b as an example], see Note 12 for
explanation of boundary line). The query protein is marked as
a large green diamond. If this diamond is found above the
boundary, then the protein is disordered, and if it is below
the boundary, then the protein is compact. Raw data to build
this plot (results for your protein, boundary, as well as coordi-
nates of sets of natively unfolded and ordered proteins) are in
the CHARGE-HYDROPATHY OUTPUT section. For
each protein in your dataset, you need to calculate the CH
distance, ΔCH, which is a vertical distance between the point
of a protein within the CH-plot and a boundary separating

Fig. 6 Evaluating overall disorder status of human α-synuclein (UniProt ID: P37840) using binary disorder
classiﬁers, CDF-plot (a) and CH-plot (b). In CDF-plot, green line represents CDF curve calculated for a query
protein based on the outputs of the per-residue disorder predictor, PONDR® VLXT. Boundary separating
ordered proteins and IDPs is shown by a black thick line with seven points. Since the CDF curves of ordered
proteins are located at the upper left corner of this plot, and the CDF curves of IDPs are positioned at the lower
right corner of this plot, and since the majority of the α-synuclein CDF curve are located below CDF boundary,
this query protein is expected to be disordered as a whole. In CH-plot, positions of a set of extended IDPs and a
set of ordered proteins are shown by red circles and blue squares, respectively, whereas position of a query
protein is shown by a green diamond. Since α-synuclein is located below boundary, it is expected be compact

compact and disordered proteins. In other words, this is a
difference between the protein’s mean net charge hMNCiprotein
and a mean net charge of the boundary, hMNCiboundary, at the
mean hydropathy of a protein hHiprotein. According to [94],
disorder-order boundary in CH phase space is deﬁned as:
<MNC>boundary ¼ 2:743 <H>boundary  1:109
where hHiboundary and hMNCiboundary represent the boundary
mean hydrophobicity and mean net charge values, respectively.
Here, hHiboundary is the boundary mean hydrophobicity value,
below which a polypeptide chain with a given mean net charge
hMNCi will most probably be intrinsically disordered [15].
Therefore, ΔCH can be calculated as follows (see Note 14 for
example calculation):
ΔCH ¼ <MNC>protein  <MNC>boundary ¼ <MNC>protein
 2.743  <H>protein + 1.109.
5. CH-CDF plot. Use ΔCH and ΔCDF data from steps 3 and
4 above to generate a ΔCH vs. ΔCDF graph. In the resulting
CH-CDF plot, the Y values correspond to the distance of a
given protein from the corresponding boundary separating
extended and compact proteins in CH-plot (ΔCH), whereas
the X values correspond to the outputs of the corresponding
CDF analysis in the form of a distance of the protein CDF
curve from the CDF boundary separating ordered proteins and
IDPs (ΔCDF). The combination of the outputs of these two
binary predictors results in a CH-CDF plot containing four
distinct quadrants deﬁning the CH-CDF phase space. The
quadrants deﬁne the following classiﬁcations of proteins: Q1,
proteins predicted to be ordered by both binary predictors;
Q2, proteins determined to be ordered/compact by CH, but
disordered by CDF (I.E., putative native “molten globules,”
MG or hybrid proteins); Q3, proteins predicted to be disor-
dered by both methods; Q4, proteins predicted to be disor-
dered by CH-plot, but ordered by CDF. CH-CDF plot should
be analyzed to evaluate the fraction of proteins in each quad-
rant (See Fig. 7)
Using Per-residue
Predictors
Per-residue disorder predictors can also be used for the global
analysis of the overall disorder status in a set of query proteins.
Intrinsic Disorder in Protein Interactomes
921

One of the accepted approaches represent classiﬁcation of proteins
based on their predicted percent of intrinsically disordered residues
(PPIDR) values (i.e., percent of residues with disorder scores
exceeding the accepted threshold values, typically 0.5), where pro-
teins are considered as highly ordered, moderately disordered, and
highly disordered, if they are characterized by the PPIDR <10%,
10% PPIDR <30%, and PPIDR 30%, respectively [103].
1. Go to the DisProt site by typing http://original.disprot.org/
in the Internet browser. Locate and click Disorder Predictors
link at left side of the major DisProt page. This will bring you to
the page containing a table with several disorder predictors.
Locate and click Internal pointer to the PONDR-FIT meta-
predictor and other PONDR methods link (which is the second
line in the table). This will bring you to the Predict Disorder
working page (you can also access it by typing http://original.

Fig. 7 CH-CDF analysis of the human proteins related to programmed cell death
(apoptosis, pink circles; autophagy, cyan circles; and necroptosis, green circles).
Here, the coordinates of each point were calculated as a distance of the
corresponding protein in the CH-plot from the boundary (Y-coordinate) and an
average distance of the respective CDF curve from the CDF boundary (X-
coordinate). The four quadrants correspond to the following predictions: Q1,
proteins predicted to be disordered by CH-plots, but ordered by CDFs; Q2,
ordered proteins; Q3, proteins predicted to be disordered by CDFs, but
compact by CH-plots (i.e., putative molten globules or mixed proteins); Q4,
proteins predicted to be disordered by both methods (i.e., proteins with
extended disorder). The values shown next to the quadrant name denote the
corresponding color-coded fractions of chains from each of the three types of
PCD-related proteins. This plot is based on data published in Peng et al. [118]

in
the
corresponding box. At this page, several sequence formats are
allowed, including FASTA, EMBL, and plain sequence format.
These formats are described at the bottom of the page. Click-
ing Submit will bring you to the results page.
3. It is recommended to keep the content of the entire results
page. A ﬁgure can be used as illustration. Raw output values can
be found in links VSL2 DATA, VL3 DATA, VLXT DATA,
and PONDR-FIT DATA located in the Files used to produce
this plot section. Note that raw PONDR-FIT data contain
both disorder scores (third column) and errors in disorder
evaluation (fourth column; see Note 15), whereas the raw
PONDR® VSL2 in addition to the disorder score includes
annotation of a given residue as ordered (O) or intrinsically
disordered (D) shown in the fourth column.
4. Go to the IUPred site by typing https://iupred2a.elte.hu/ in
the Internet browser. Locate Protein Sequence window and
enter either the SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL identiﬁer or acces-
sion number or paste in the amino acid sequence. Select
IUPred2 long disorder (default, see Note 16) in Prediction
type and click Submit button at the bottom of the screen. This
will bring you to the page with the results of IUPred analysis.
Find and click Download text button, which brings to the
tabulated results. Here, in addition to the IUPred results of
the evaluation of the presence in a query protein of long IDRs
(column 3), results of ANCHOR analysis are shown (column
4, see below).
5. Repeat the procedures described in step 3, but instead of
IUPred 2 long disorder (default) use IUPred 2 short disorder
in Prediction type (see Note 16). Completing this step will give
information on the presence in a query protein of short IDRs.
6. Using numerical outputs from steps 3–5 for series of PONDR
and IUPred predictors, calculate predictor-speciﬁc PPIDR
values for all query proteins (see Note 17). The corresponding
results can be used to make two-dimensional or three-
dimensional plots showing correlations between the outputs
of different predictors. It is recommended to use the outputs of
at least one PONDR algorithm and at least one IUPred pro-
gram in these analyses. These correlation plots can be used to
evaluate the content of highly ordered, moderately disordered,
and highly disordered proteins in a query dataset, Fig. 8.

Functionality in a Set
of Selected Members
of the Analyzed PPI
Network
Detailed protocols for the evaluation of the peculiarities of disorder
distribution and disorder-based functionality in a query protein
were described in Uversky [67]. Therefore, sections below repro-
duce those protocols.
1. Entering information to the PONDR® site and retrieving results
of disorder prediction.
(a)
Go to the ofﬁcial PONDR® site by typing http://www.
pondr.com/ in the Internet browser. Locate and click
PREDICT DISORDER link at the top left corner of
the major PONDR page. This will bring you to the
PONDR® working page.
(b)
While on the PONDR® working page, select boxes
corresponding
to
the
desired
Predictors
(VLXT,
VL3-BA, VSL2, CDF, and Charge-Hydropathy). When
Charge-Hydropathy box is marked, two new boxes
(From: and To:) will appear. Leave both empty. Put Pro-
tein name in the space provided (optional). Enter NCBI

spliceosomal proteins using the outputs of two different disorder prediction
tools. IUPred vs. PONDR-FIT plot represents the correlation between the
disorder content in query proteins evaluated by IUPred (y-axis) and by PONDR-
FIT (x-axis). Two arbitrary cut-offs for the levels of intrinsic disorder were used to
classify proteins as highly ordered (disorder score < 0.1), moderately disordered
(0.1  disorder score < 0.3), and highly disordered (disorder score  0.3).
Boundaries separating highly ordered and moderately disordered proteins and
moderately and highly disordered proteins are shown by dashed blue and red
lines, respectively. This plot is based on data published in Coelho Ribeiro Mde

sequence only) in the corresponding boxes. Scroll down
the page and check the box Raw Output at the Output
Options section. Clicking Submit Query will bring you to
the PONDR® results page.
(c)
It is recommended to keep the content of the entire
PONDR® results page. Figures can be used as illustra-
tions. Statistics section provides useful information on the
number of residues predicted to be disordered, overall
percent of disordered residues, number of disordered
regions, the length of the longest disordered region, and
the average prediction score. You will ﬁnd here a list of
regions predicted to be disordered. Raw output values can
be used to plot the results for several proteins on one
graph.
2. Retrieving results of disorder prediction from the DisProt.
(a)
Type http://original.disprot.org/ in the Internet browser
and access the site. Locate and click Disorder Predictors
link at left side of the major DisProt page. This will bring
you to the page containing a table with several disorder
predictors. Locate and click Internal pointer to the
PONDR-FIT meta-predictor and other PONDR meth-
ods link (which is the second line in the table). This will
bring you to the Predict Disorder working page (you can
also access it by typing http://original.disprot.org/
metapredictor.php in the Internet browser).
(b)
While on the Predict Disorder working page, select boxes
corresponding to the desired Predictors (VSL2B, VL3,
VLXT, PONDR-FIT [see Note 18 for brief description
of the major advantages of the different members of the
PONDR series of disorder predictors]). Enter Protein
Sequence in the corresponding box. At this page, several
sequence formats are allowed, including FASTA, EMBL,
and plain sequence format. These formats are described at
the bottom of the page. Clicking Submit will bring you to
the results page.
(c)
It is recommended to keep the content of the entire
results page. Figure can be used as illustration. Raw out-
put values can be found in links VSL2 DATA, VL3
DATA, VLXT DATA, and PONDR-FIT DATA located
in the Files used to produce this plot section. Note that
raw PONDR-FIT data contain both disorder scores (third
column) and errors in disorder evaluation (fourth col-
umn; see Note 15), whereas the raw PONDR® VSL2 in
addition to the disorder score includes annotation of a
given residue as ordered (O) or intrinsically disordered
(D) shown in the fourth column.

3. Retrieving results of disorder prediction from the IUPred.
(a)
Protocol for using IUPred to retrieve the disorder predic-
tion results for a query protein was described in section
“Using Per-residue Predictors”. Repeat steps 4 and
5 from that section for each protein in your query dataset.
Completing these steps will give information on the pres-
ence of short and long IDRs in a query set of proteins.
4. Understanding the results of the PONDR® and IUPred analyses.
(a)
Since different per-residue disorder predictors are sensi-
tive to different peculiarities of protein amino acid
sequences, it is highly recommended to generate global
disorder proﬁles (i.e., proﬁles containing results of
per-residue disorder evaluation by various algorithms
described in previous sections) for each query protein.
These proﬁles should include outputs of all the disorder
predictors used to characterize a given protein. Mean
disorder plot can be added here too (see Fig. 9).
(b)
PONDR® scores. The PONDR® results page starts with
the plot providing the distribution of PONDR® scores
over the amino acid sequence. You will have three color
lines there, red, blue, and pink, corresponding to the
results for the PONDR® VLXT, PONDR® VL3-BA,
and PONDR® VSL2 predictions, respectively. In the
plot generated by DisProt, the results of the PONDR®
VLXT, PONDR® VL3, PONDR® VSL2, and PONDR-
FIT predictions are shown as gray, red, blue, and green
lines, respectively. Scores above the threshold of 0.5 cor-
respond to the regions predicted to be disordered. Long
disordered regions (with >30 consecutive residues pre-
dicted to be disordered) are indicated as thick black lines.
Raw data of these analyses are at the end of the page in the
PREDICTOR VALUES section.
(c)
IUPred scores. The IUPred results page starts with the plot
providing the distribution of IUPred and ANCHOR
scores over the amino acid sequence shown by red and
blue colors, respectively. Scores above the threshold of 0.5
correspond to the regions predicted to be disordered
(IUPred) or to potential MoRF (ANCHOR).
(d)
Interpretation of PONDR® data is rather straightforward.
As pointed above, high PONDR® scores (above 0.5) for
all four predictors (PONDR® VLXT, PONDR® VL3-BA,
PONDR® VSL2, and PONDR-FIT) are characteristic of
regions with high propensity to be disordered. Some
peculiarities of the PONDR® VLXT curve might correlate
with
protein
functionality
(see
below).
PONDR®
VL3-BA usually provides very smooth output, as it was
926

Fig. 9 Illustrative example of disorder proﬁles generated for porin OmpF from
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (UniProt ID: A0A3G5J0N8), which is a mostly
ordered transmembrane protein (a) and human p53 (UniProt ID: P04637),
which is a hybrid protein containing an ordered domain and long IDRs (b).
Disorder proﬁles are generated by several commonly used per-residue
predictors of intrinsic disorder, such as PONDR® VLXT (black line), PONDR®
VSL2 (yellow line), PONDR® VL3 (green line), PONDR® FIT (red line),
IUPred_short (blue line), and IUPred_long (pink line). These computational
tools were selected because of their different sensitivity to different disorder-
related features. Bold dashed dark cyan line shows the mean disorder propensity
calculated by averaging disorder proﬁles of individual predictors. Light cyan
shadow around the mean disorder curve shows the error distribution. In these
analyses, the predicted intrinsic disorder scores above 0.5 are considered to
correspond to the disordered residues/regions, whereas residues and regions
with the disorder scores >0.2 are considered as ﬂexible

trained on long regions of disorder and its raw predictions
are averaged over an output window of length 31 to
obtain
the
ﬁnal
prediction
for
a
given
position
[82]. PONDR® VL3-BA is useful for the accurate predic-
tion of long disordered regions. PONDR® VSL2 is one of
the most accurate stand-alone predictor of intrinsic disor-
der in the PONDR® series [83, 84]. Finally, PONDR-FIT
is a metapredictor combining six individual predictors
(PONDR®
VLXT
[24],
PONDR®
VSL2
[82],
PONDR® VL3 [84], FoldIndex [88], IUPred [89],
TopIDP [90]), which is moderately more accurate than
each of the component predictors [87].
(e)
Interpretation of CDF- and CH-plot analyses is straight-
forward too. It has been pointed out that sometimes these
two analyses provide seemingly contradictory data, with
CDF analysis predicting a much higher frequency of dis-
order in sequence databases than CH-plot discrimination
[94, 101, 104]. The reasons for this discrepancy are out-
lined below (see Note 19). Differences in predictions by
these two classiﬁers were suggested to be physically inter-
pretable in terms of the degree of protein disorder. Pro-
teins predicted to be disordered by both CH-plot and
CDF (i.e., polypeptide chains with high net charge and
low hydrophobicity) are likely to be in the extended dis-
order class. Proteins predicted to be disordered by CDF,
but ordered by CH-plot, should have properties consis-
tent with a dynamic, collapsed chain and are likely to be in
the collapsed disorder class (i.e., molten globules), or be
hybrid proteins with comparable content of ordered
domains and IDRs. Rarely, proteins are predicted to be
disordered by the CH-plot, but ordered by the CDF
analysis. This may represent structured proteins with an
unusually high net charge; such proteins are likely to
exhibit salt-sensitive structures. Finally, proteins predicted
to be ordered by both algorithms are of course likely to be
in the well-structured class [94].

useful information on location of disordered and func-
tional regions and PTM sites by placing cursor over the
corresponding part of the plot. It is recommended to save
the resulting ﬁgure since it can be used as nice illustration.
As an illustration, Fig. 10 represents the D2P2 output for
human α-synuclein.
2. Using MobiDB.
(a)
Go to the ofﬁcial MobiDB site by typing http://mobidb.
bio.unipd.it/ in the Internet browser. Type in the Uni-
Prot ID of your protein in the UniProt Query line and
click Search link. This will bring you to the Search page.
Locate your protein in the List of Returned Results and
click the corresponding link containing UniProt ID of
your protein. This will bring you to the results section,
which contains a lot of information about the query
protein.

tional information generated for human α-synuclein (UniProt ID: P37840) by the
D2P2 database (http://d2p2.pro/) [95]. Here, the outputs of nine disorder pre-
dictors are shown as differently colored bars at the top part of the plot followed
by two bars showing predicted domains (Superfamilies and Pfams). Blue-and-
white bar in the middle of the plot shows the predicted disorder agreement
between nine predictors, with blue parts corresponding to disordered regions by
consensus. Yellow bar shows the location of the predicted disorder-based
binding sites (molecular recognition features, MoRFs), whereas colored circles
at the bottom of the plot show location of various PTMs. Here, phosphorylation,
acetylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation sites are shown by
red, yellow, orange, purple, and green circles, respectively

Alternatively, you can get an access to MobiDB directly
from the UniProt page corresponding to the protein of
interest. At the left-hand side of the corresponding Uni-
ProtKB entry page, look for a blue bar containing link to
Structure and click this link. In the section entitled Struc-
ture, locate MobiDB pointer and click Search link next to
it. This will bring you to the same results section as above.
(c)
The result page contains a lot of very useful information
about the query protein that includes structural informa-
tion with corresponding PDB IDs (if available), the results
of the multi-tool analysis of the disorder status of the
query protein, as well as some functional annotation.
Therefore, it is recommended to keep the content of the
entire results page.
3. Understanding outputs of D2P2 and MobiDB.
(a)
Interpretation of D2P2 data is rather straightforward. In a
visually attractive form, this database provides an access to
the pre-computed disorder predictions [95] using outputs
of PONDR® VLXT [24], two ﬂavors of IUPred [89],
PONDR® VSL2B [83, 84], PrDOS [105], three ﬂavors
of ESpritz [106], and PV2 [95]. The visual console of
D2P2 is further enhanced by providing information on the
curated sites of various PTMs and on the location of
predicted disorder-based potential binding sites. In the
corresponding plots, top nine colored bars represent loca-
tion of disordered regions predicted by different disorder
predictors (Espritz-D, Espritz-N, Espritz-X, IUPred-L,
IUPred-S,
PV2,
PrDOS,
PONDR®
VSL2b,
and
PONDR® VLXT; see keys for the corresponding color
codes). The next two lines with colored and numbered
bars show positions of predicted domains. Green-and-
white bar in the middle of the plot shows the predicted
disorder agreement between these nine predictors, with
green parts corresponding to disordered regions by con-
sensus. Yellow bar shows the location of the predicted
disorder-based binding site (MoRF region), whereas red,
yellow, orange, blue, and violet circles at the bottom of the
plots show locations of phosphorylation, acetylation, gly-
cosylation,
methylation,
and
ubuquitylation
sites,
respectively.
(b)
Interpretation of the MobiDB data is rather intuitive too.
The page starts with the general Sequence Annotations,
where locations of long disordered regions and structure/
disorder information from all available sources (e.g.,
structural data from the PDB in form of nuclear magnetic
resonance [NMR] and X-ray structures [if available], and
930
Vladimir N. Uversky

results of multi-tool disorder prediction) are shown. If
several NMR (or X-ray) structures are available for a
query protein, then data shown in this section will corre-
spond to the consensus of all NMR (or X-ray) data.
Numeric
disorder
scores
are
shown
next
to
the
corresponding lines. Next line shows location of Pfam
domains. This is followed by the Detailed Disorder
Annotations section, which contains multiple subsec-
tions showing results extracted from the individual PDB
entries in a form of distribution of ordered and disordered
regions. Consensus for all NMR or all X-ray structures is
also shown. Each line is ended with the corresponding
numeric score. MobiDB also generates consensus disorder
scores based on the outputs of ten disorder predictors,
such as ESpritz in its two ﬂavors [106], IUPred in its two
ﬂavors [89], DisEMBL in two of its ﬂavors [107], Glob-
Plot [108], PONDR® VSL2 [83, 84], and JRONN [109]
in addition to showing results of the individual predictors.
This is followed by the Protein-Protein Interactions
section that contains Known Structural Interactors
(from PDB) and Known Experimental and Database
Interactors (from STRING) subsections. Here known
and predicted binding partners are listed together with
their corresponding disorder scores. The page is con-
cluded with the Detailed Sequence Annotations section,
where the Consensus Table and the Prediction Table are
shown numerically and locations of disordered regions are
located.
3.4.4
Intrinsic
Disorder-Based Functional
Analyses
Many IDPs and IDRs are known to undergo at least partial
disorder-to-order transitions upon binding, which is crucial for
their functions in recognition, regulation, and signaling [4, 9, 14,
15, 22, 36, 37, 110–112]. Among these potential functional sites
are short order-prone motifs within long disordered regions that
are able to undergo disorder-to-order transition during the binding
to a speciﬁc partner. These motifs are known as Molecular Recog-
nition Feature (MoRF), and they can be identiﬁed computationally
[36, 38]. There are several recent articles evaluating performance of
commonly used computational tools for ﬁnding disorder-based
functional sites [48, 49], and the interested reader is strongly
encouraged to study these papers.
1. Predicting disorder-based binding sites by ANCHOR.
(a)
Go to the ofﬁcial ANCHOR site by typing http://anchor.
enzim.hu/ in the Internet browser. Type in the UniProt
ID of your protein in the Enter SWISS-PROT/
TrEMBL Identiﬁer or Accession Number line or
deposit sequence of your protein in Or Paste the

tion of Protein Binding Regions

The results page contains a self-explanatory plot with the
results of ANCHOR analysis, a table with localization of
predicted disorder-based binding regions, and numerical
raw data.
2. Predicting disorder-based binding sites by MoRFpred.
(a)
Go to the MoRFpred site by typing http://biomine-ws.
ece.ualberta.ca/ MoRFpred/ in the Internet browser.
Deposit sequence of your protein (in FASTA format) in
1. Enter protein sequence(s) window. Enter your e-mail
address in 2. Provide your e-mail address line and click
Run MoRFpred! link in the 3. Predict line. This will bring
you to the MoRFpred processing page, where the infor-
mation will be provided on your position in queue and also
a link will be given to the Results page. The results will be
displayed there once your request will be completed and
they will be stored on our server for at least 1 month.
Please save this address for your reference. Information on
the results will also be sent to your e-mail address.
3. Predicting potential phosphorylation sites using DisPhos.
It has been shown that intrinsic disorder prediction might help
increase the prediction accuracy of several protein PTM sites,
including protein phosphorylation [53], methylation [113],
and many other PTMs. A brief protocol below describes
DEPP (or DisPhos) that uses disorder information to improve
the discrimination between phosphorylation and nonpho-
sphorylation sites. Note, that this predictor uses disorder infor-
mation for predicting phosphorylation sites and does not use
motifs and kinase recognition sites. The retrieved prediction
score approximates the probability that the residue is phos-
phorylated. Only residues with a prediction score >0.5 are
considered to be phosphorylated. The step-by-step protocol
of DEPP analysis is presented below.
(a)
Go to the PONDR® working page and click the DEPP
Prediction button. This will bring you to the DEPP
working page. While on this page, type Protein name in
the space provided (optional) and enter NCBI Accession
Code or Protein Sequence (FASTA format or sequence
only) in the corresponding boxes. Scroll down the page
and check the box Raw Output at the Output Options
section. By clicking Submit Query button, you will be
forwarded to the DEPP results page.

(b)
The top of the DEP results page represents the plot
providing the distribution of DEPP scores over the
amino acid sequence. You will have three types of symbols
corresponding to the Thr (green triangles), Ser (blue
squares), and Tyr residues (red circles) predicted to be
phosphorylated. Only residues with DEPP scores >0.5
will be shown.
(c)
Raw data related to this analysis are at the end of the page
in the PREDICTOR VALUES section. The DEPP
NNP STATISTICS section provides useful information
on the number of phosphorylated Ser, Thr, and Tyr,
together with the total number of these residues in a
given protein and the relative phosphorylation efﬁciency.
Once again, we recommend you to keep the content of
the entire DEPP results page for future use.
4. Predicting potential sites of 23 different PTMs using ModPred.
A uniﬁed sequence-based predictor was developed to ﬁnd
23 types of PTM sites in a query protein [54]. This tool used
information on 278,703 experimentally validated PTM sites
grouped into 23 types (Acetylation, ADP-ribosylation, Amida-
tion, C-linked glycosylation, Carboxylation, Disulﬁde linkage,
Farnesylation, Geranylgeranylation, GPI-anchor amidation,
Hydroxylation, Methylation, Myristoylation, N-linked glyco-

Notes
1. While there is no established consensus in the literature on how
to deﬁne hub proteins, many studies deﬁne them as proteins
with larger degrees in the PPI networks, when compared to the
non-hub proteins. For instance, one of the early studies by
Han et al. [62] has deﬁned hubs as proteins with degrees >5,
Haynes et al. [64] decided to increase the cut-off to over
10, while Batada et al. [114] deﬁned hubs as the top 5% of
proteins with the highest degrees. In more recent studies,
Aragues et al. [115] have speciﬁed hubs as proteins with the
degrees >20, and Jin et al. [116] as the top 20% of proteins
with the highest degrees in a given network.
2. In Download N Published Interactions for This Protein
link at the BioGrid output page, N shows the number of
published interactions for the query protein.
3. If you are not sure which dataset format to choose, you can hit
BioGRID Download Format link to view the related docu-
mentation. Many questions can be answered using the HELP
button, where in addition to the frequently asked question, a
link is provided to the tutorial video.
4. In BioGRID, the appearance of the PPI network can be CON-
CENTRIC CIRCLES (default representation that shows PPI
network as circles within circles, with layers closest to the center
being more highly connected), or SINGLE CIRCLE (which is
a giant circle where nodes are placed entirely at random), or
GRID (which is a table-like layout of rows and columns with no
grouping of nodes), or ARBOR (which is a dynamic layout that
applies physical forces to repel and attract related nodes). In
these PPI networks, the node size is proportional to the num-
ber of edges to/from that node, whereas the thickness of edge
reﬂects the number of unique curated interactions supporting
the association. Meaning of the different colors of node/edge
can be found by selecting Graph Legend in the Help drop-
down menu from the menu bar above the network.
5. The PPI network layouts generated by IntAct can be force
directed (the nodes are positioned to have more or less equal
length of all the edges and to have as few crossing edges as
possible) or radial (the nodes are constrained to lie on a set of
concentric circles) or circle (the nodes are placed on a circle,
evenly spaced, and edges depicted as chords of the circle)
934
Vladimir N. Uversky

layouts in IntAct. One can choose a given layout from the
menu located on the left-hand side of the network. Selection
of a particular layout is determined by the complexity of the
generated PPI network. Please note that if a query protein is
involved in many binary interactions, building corresponding
PPI network in IntAct could take rather long time.
6. Size and location of the PPI network in IntAct can be manipu-
lated by a set of tools located within the zoom panel positioned
at the bottom left corner of Network visualization page. One
should adjust position and size of the generated PPI network to
better represent its peculiarities.
7. The actual number of STRING interactors of a query protein
can be larger than ten, and it can be deﬁned by the user.
Obviously, if your query protein interacts with less than ten
partners, then the number of shown nodes will be smaller.
8. There are several settings for presenting minimum required
interaction score, such as highest conﬁdence (0.900), high
conﬁdence (0.700), medium conﬁdence (0.400, which is set
as default), low conﬁdence (0.150), and custom value. Conﬁ-
dence level is computed by combining the probabilities from
the different evidence channels and corrected for the probabil-
ity of randomly observing an interaction. Please note that
interactions that have higher conﬁdence are more likely to be
true positives.
9. In APID, results of the PPI interaction analysis for a given
protein are given in the form of Interactions, Raw curated
Events, or Network. Selecting Interactions will give you a list
of annotated interactions for a query protein. You will ﬁnd
there information on UniProt name, UniProt ID, TaxID,
experimental evidence and methods (number of techniques
used to characterize a given binary PPI), number of publica-
tions reporting this binary interaction, presence or absence of a
three-dimensional structure for an interactor, and curation
events (name of the primary PPI database and number of
corresponding curation events; i.e., the number of times a
binary PPI between a query protein and its interactor was
reported in said primary database). You can further ﬁlter your
results by choosing different values for Minimal number of
experimental evidences, Minimal number of methods, Min-
imal number of publications, and Minimal number of cura-
tion events using the corresponding drug-on bars. Selecting
Raw curated Events will give you a table containing informa-
tion on UniProt names of binary interactors (ProteinA and
ProteinB), method type (binary or indirect), experimental
technique used for identiﬁcation of given binary PPI, publica-
tion where this PPI was described, and a database, where this
Intrinsic Disorder in Protein Interactomes
935

PPI was curated. Selecting Network will give you a PPI net-
work for a query protein.
10. In the multiprotein analysis of PPIs by STRING, after the list
of target proteins is added (one name per line) and a query
Organism is selected from the drop-down menu, next screen
provides a list of proteins in selected organism that appear to
match your input. Please review the list, then click CON-
TINUE to proceed. If a query organism is not selected on
the multiple proteins search page, STRING will ﬁnd a match by
auto-detect option (default). In this case, an additional page
will open that lists several organisms in STRING, which appear
to match your input. Please select one from the list below, then
click CONTINUE to proceed. This will bring you to the page
describing target proteins (see above). After clicking CON-
TINUE, you will proceed to the results page.
11. Although PONDR® VLXT outputs are not needed at this
stage, failure to select at least one per-residue predictor
(VLXT, VL3-BA, or VSL2) will generate an error message:
“Please choose at least one of the predictors. VLXT is selected
below by default.”
12. In addition to the CDF curve of a query protein, CDF-plot
includes the orderdisorder boundary that separates the CDF
curves of IDPs from the CDF curves of ordered proteins. The
combination of boundary points that provides the most accu-
rate classiﬁcation (and that shown in the plot as a thick black
line with seven points) was determined by examining all possi-
ble, multipoint boundaries made up of consecutive boundary
points. Examination of all possible combinations of consecu-
tive boundary points showed that seven boundary points
located in the 12th through 18th bin provided the optimal
separation of the ordered and disordered protein sets. The
estimated classiﬁcation accuracy of this boundary was 88%
overall with 87 and 90% of wholly disordered and wholly
ordered proteins correctly classiﬁed, respectively. The order-
disorder classiﬁcation is based on whether a CDF curve was
above or below a majority of boundary points. Similarly, the
CH-plot includes optimal boundary between the ordered and
disordered proteins in chargehydropathy space. This bound-
ary was calculated/determined using a linear discriminant
function, assuming normal distributions and equal covariance
matrices [94]. The classiﬁcation accuracy for CH-plot was 83%
overall, 76% for disordered proteins, and 91% for ordered
proteins.
13. In order to generate CH-CDF plot, ΔCDF values should be
calculated for query proteins. Example of such calculations is
provided below for human α-synuclein (UniProt ID: P37840).
In PONDR page (http://www.pondr.com/) with the results
936
Vladimir N. Uversky

of the disorder analysis, search for CUMULATIVE DISTRI-
BUTION FUNCTION (CDF) OUTPUT section. Here, the
CDF results are listed as X (PONDR score, in a form of ranges,
e.g., 0.00–0.05, 0.05–0.10) and Y (Cumulative fraction of
residues) pairs. You need to ﬁnd Y values corresponding to
the following X ranges 0.55–0.60, 0.60–0.65, 0.65–0.70,
0.70–0.75,
0.75–0.80,
0.80–0.85,
and
0.85–0.90.
The
corresponding Y values are 0.6929, 0.7071, 0.7143, 0.7214,
0.7500, 0.7929, and 0.8286. Next, you are looking for bound-
ary Y values corresponding to the X values of 0.60, 0.65. 0.70,
0.75, 0.80, 0.85, and 0.90. These Y values are 0.6948, 0.7323,
0.7736, 0.8141, 0.8538, 0.9051, and 0.9467. Then, for each
boundary X, you subtract boundary Y values from the
corresponding Y values of a query protein, add the resulting
differences, and divide the resulting sum by 7 (number of
boundary points):
ΔCDF ¼ ((0.6929  0.6948) + (0.7071  0.7323) + (0.7143
 0.7736) + (0.7214  0.8141) + (0.7500  0.8538) +
(0.9051  0.7929) + (0.9467  0.8286))/7 ¼ (0.0019
 0.0252  0.0593  0.0927  0.1038  0.1122 
0.1181)/7 ¼ (0.5132)/7 ¼ 0.0733.
Alternatively, these calculations can be simpliﬁed as
follows. First, the mean Y value for the boundary should be
calculated, with all the Y values of the boundary being summed
up and the resulting sum divided by 7:
(0.6948 + 0.7323 + 0.7736 + 0.8141 + 0.8538 + 0.9051 +
0.9467)/7 ¼ 7.7204/7 ¼ 0.8172.
Then, the mean Y value of the corresponding part of the
CDF-plot of a query protein is calculated. Here, all the
corresponding Y values of the CDF points of a query protein
should be summed up and the resulting sum divided by 7:
(0.6929 + 0.7071 + 0.7143 + 0.7214 + 0.7500 + 0.7929 +
0.8286)/7 ¼ 5.2072/7 ¼ 0.7439.
Finally, ΔCDF is calculated as a difference between the
mean Y value for query proteins and the mean Y values for
the boundary:
ΔCDF ¼ 0.7439–0.8172 ¼ 0.0733.
14. Example below represents ΔCH calculation for human α-synu-
clein (UniProt ID: P37840). In PONDR Page (http://www.
pondr.com/) with the results of the disorder analysis, look
for
CHARGE-HYDROPATHY
OUTPUT.
Here,
data
corresponding to a query protein read as follows: mean net
charge: 0.0643; hydropathy: 0.4552; boundary hydropathy ¼
0.4364. Therefore, for α-synuclein, hMNCiprotein ¼ 0.0643;
hHiprotein ¼ 0.4552; and hMNCiboundary ¼ 0.4364. To Get the
Intrinsic Disorder in Protein Interactomes
937

ΔCH value (which Is a vertical distance between the point
corresponding to a query protein and the order-disorder
boundary), the following equation is used
ΔCH ¼<MNC>protein <MNC>boundary ¼<MNC>protein
 2:743  <H>protein þ 1:109
which gives:
ΔCH ¼ 0:0643  2:743  0:4552 þ 1:109 ¼ 0:0753
15. Since PONDR-FIT is a metapredictor trained on the outputs
of six individual predictors (PONDR® VLXT [24], PONDR®
VSL2 [82], PONDR® VL3 [84], FoldIndex [88], IUPred
[89], TopIDP [90]), in addition to the per-residue disorder
scores PONDR-FIT provides information on the errors in
evaluation of these disorder scores. This is a rather unique
option that reﬂects some relative accuracy of the generated
disorder scores. Low errors indicate protein regions with
good agreement between the outputs of the component pre-
dictors, and large errors show regions where there is some
disagreement between the component predictors.
16. Depending on the type of disordered regions the user wants
to analyse, IUPred has two modes of disorder prediction that
can be chosen, short stretches of disorder (such as ﬂexible
loops or linkers, typically less than 30 consecutive residues),
long disordered regions (such as disordered domains, more
than 30 consecutive residues), or structured domains.
17. For a given protein, predicted percent of intrinsically disor-
dered residues (PPIDR) can be calculated from the outputs of
per-residue disorder predictors as a percent of residues located
above the disorder threshold (typically disorder score of 0.5).
Count the number of residues with disorder scores at least 0.5
(0.5), divide this number by the number of residues in
amino acid sequence, and multiple by 100.
18. As it follows from the description of PONDR predictors in
Subheading 2 (items 13–16), these algorithms have speciﬁc
advantages. For example, PONDR® VLXT is sensitive to local
sequence peculiarities. As a result, some features of the
PONDR® VLXTcurve might correlate with protein function-
ality. PONDR® VL3 is useful for the accurate prediction of
long disordered regions. PONDR® VSL2 is one of the most
accurate stand-alone predictors of intrinsic disorder in the
PONDR® series. The metapredictor PONDR-FIT is moder-
ately more accurate than each of the component predictors.
19. The difference in the disorder prediction by CDF analysis and
CH-plot likely results from the fact that the CH-plot is a
938
Vladimir N. Uversky

linear classiﬁer that takes into account only two parameters of
the particular sequence—charge and hydrophobicity [15]—
whereas the CDF analysis is dependent upon the output of
the PONDR® VLXT predictor, a nonlinear neural network
classiﬁer, which was trained to distinguish order and disorder
based on a signiﬁcantly larger feature space that explicitly
includes net charge and hydropathy [93, 94]. Therefore,
charge-hydropathy feature space can be considered as a subset
of PONDR® VLXT feature space. By deﬁnition, CH-plot
analysis is predisposed to discriminate proteins with substan-
tial amounts of extended disorder (random coils and
pre-molten globules) from proteins with globular conforma-
tions (molten globule-like and rigid well-structured proteins).
On the other hand, PONDR-based CDF analysis may dis-
criminate all types of disordered conformations, including
molten globules, pre-molten globules, and coils from ordered
proteins [94]. These differences are utilized in CH-CDF
analysis.
