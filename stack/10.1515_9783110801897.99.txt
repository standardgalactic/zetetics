The moonshine VOA and a tensor product of Ising models 
Masahiko 
Miyamoto 
Abstract. It is known that Va contains a copy of the tensor product Τ — <S>fljL(j, θ) 
of 48 Ising models. We determine the Γ-module structure of 
explicitly for some Τ. 
We also give a new proof of that the full automorphism group of V^ is finite. 
Section 1. Introduction 
The most interesting example of vertex operator algebra (VOA) is the moonshine module 
V1- = Σ ° 1 0 ν / . It has many interesting properties, but its structure and the automorphism 
group are very difficult to see, (see [FLM]). On the other hand, the simplest example is 
one of the minimal series of rational Virasoro VOA L Q , 0) with central charge 
It 
has only three inequivalent irreducible modules 
0), 
and 
where 
the first entry denotes the central charge and the second denotes the highest weights. Its 
fusion rules are: 
(1) 
( 0 ) is identity, 
(2) L(\ \)*L(\ 
\) = L(\ 0) 
(3) L ^ , 5) x 
ϊζ) = 
Ιό)' 
(4) 
x L ( I , ^ ) = L ( ± , 0 ) + L ( I , I ) . 
It is shown by Dong, Mason, and Zhu in [DMZ] that the moonshine VOA V^ contains 
48 mutually orthogonal conformal vectors el with the central charge \ such that the sum 
is the Virasoro element of V^. This means 
that V* contains a vertex operator subalgebra 
Τ = O ^ J L Q , O), which is the tensor product of 48 copies of L Q , O) and so we can 
see 
as a module of Τ. It is also proved by them that every irreducible module of a 
tensor product VOA is isomorphic to a tensor product of each irreducible modules of the 
corresponding factor VOA's. Namely, every irreducible Τ -module L can be expressed 
in the form L = ® J* j L , 
h'). 
Definition 1. We will call the above 48-tuple (h1,..., 
h4S) of highest weights "the high-
est weight row" of L. Since L ( j , 0 ) is rational and the highest weights of 
h') are 
limited, 
is a finite direct sum of such irreducible Γ-modules. Let hwr(7\ VT) denote 
the set of all highest weight rows of irreducible Γ-submodules of V2 with multiplicities. 
For an irreducible Γ-module W with a highest weight row h = (hl,..., 
A48), we assign 
a word h — (hl,..., 
h4S) by defining hl — 1 if hl = ^ and hl = 0 otherwise. We will 
call this word "a word of W of 
-positions" and denote it by h(W). Even if W is not 

100 
Μ. Miyamoto 
irreducible, we can use the same notation h(W) whenever all irreducible Γ-submodules 
of W have the same word. 
Our purpose in this paper is to determine hwr(T, V^) explicitly. It is proved by the 
author in [Ml] that if a vertex operator algebra V contains a rational conformal vector 
e with central charge 
that is, if V contains L (^, 0), then we have an automorphism 
τβ ofVOA V by defining the endomorphism ze on every (e)-submodule V by 
ί 1 
oni/ = L ( i , 0 ) o r L ( | , | ) 
T e : l - 1 
on tfS ! ( * . £ ) • 
So in the case of V", we have an elementary Abelian 2-group Ρ generated by mutually 
commutative 48 automorphisms {rei : i = 1,..., 48}. The fixed point set 
is a 
vertex operator subalgebra of 
and it is generated by all irreducible Γ-modules whose 
word of ^-positions is the zero word (048). The author showed that such a VOA is 
isomorphic to a code VOA MQ for some even binary linear code D of length 48, see 
[M3], We will call this code "the moonshine generator code" and denote it by MGC. 
We will explicitly construct MGC and its vertex operator algebra MMGC in Sec. 3. An 
advantage of MGC is that it contains a lot of Hamming codes and so we can apply the 
representation theory of Hamming code VOA, see [M3]. For any irreducible character 
χ of P, the eigenspace 
is a nontrivial irreducible 
-module and we have a decomposition 
ν = θχεΐΐΓ(Ρ)ν}, 
(see [DM]). Since every irreducible character χ of Ρ is given by a map 
χ 
I T e , 
( - l ) A ' x 
(Λ' χ 
= 0 , 1 ) , 
each character χ corresponds to a binary word hx = (h'x) and the component 
is 
generated by all irreducible Γ-submodules whose codewords of -j^-positions are hx. 
Set S = {hx : χ e Irr(/>)}. The results in [DM] and the fusion rules (1.1) imply that S 
is a binary linear code. One of our purposes is to show that S = MGC-1". 
In order to avoid the misleading, we have to note that there are probably many sets 
of unconjugate mutually orthogonal forty eight conformal vectors in V", but our choice 
of mutually orthogonal conformal vectors is some specific set, which is given by Miracle 
Octad Generator. We will explain it in Sec. 4. 
In Sec. 3, we will introduce Moonshine Generator Code MGC. In Sec. 4, we will 
investigate the structure of VOA Va of Leech lattice Λ. In Sec. 5, we will show a new 
proof of that AutiV0) is finite by using the fact that the Virasoro element is a sum of 
conformal vectors with central charge j. In Sec. 6, we will show the list the multiplicity 
of irreducible Γ-submodules.

Section 3. Moonshine generator code 
3.1 Definition of MGC. We will introduce a binary linear code "Moonshine Generator 
Code" MGC of length 48 in this section. It is generated by 3 colored blocks and 4 
orthogonal reflections. Let Zj8 be a 48-dimensional vector space over Z2 and Δ the 
set of 48 coordinates. Identify Z f as the set of 2 χ 2 χ 2 χ 2 χ 3-matrices. Divide 
Δ into three 2 χ 2 χ 2 χ 2-matrices and call them "Red", "Green", and "Blue" blocks 
and denote them by Rd, Gr, and Bl, respectively. Namely, we have a presentation 
Δ = {(±1,±1,±1, ±1, colors)}. Let Ui be the subset of Δ consisting of the elements 
whose ι -th entry is +1 for i = 1,..., 4 and call it the / -th upper space. For example, 
U2 = {(±1, +1, ±1, ±1, colors)}. 
Definition 2. For i, the reflection </>, denotes the permutation on Δ which changes the 
sign of i -th entry. We view φί as a linear map of Z^8. 
For each i = 1,... ,4, take any even subset a of /-th upper space t/,, take the 
image φι {a) of a and get the union aU φι {a). We often identify the subsets of Δ with 
the binary words. Collect all such unions and then MGC is defined as the binary linear 
code generated by them.

Definition 3. MGC = (a U φι (α) : a C £/,·, |α| even , ι = 1,..., 4). 
We note that if the intersection of MGC and one colored block is isomorphic to Reed-
Muller code R(2,4) which has minimum distance 4, (see [Mu], [Re]). It is easy to 
check the following: 
Lemma 3.1. MGC has dimension 41 and the minimal length 4. 
Proof. Clearly, MGC is an even linear code. Since the dimension of the set f-XZ") of 
all even words in Z^ is η — 1, the dimension of E(U\ ) is 23, that of E(U\ Π U2) is 11, 
that of E(Ui η U2 Π t/3) is 5, and that of E(U\ Π U2 Π f/3 η f/4) is 2. Let {at : i e I{}, 
{ßi : i e I2], 
{Vi : i e h} and {<5,· : ι € h) be bases of E(Ui), 
E(U\ Π U2), 
E(U\ nU2n 
t/3) and E(U\ Π U2 Π t/3 Π U4), respectively. It is easy to see that 
{</>!(«/,) UaA, φ2(βί) U ßi, 03 (Yj) u Yj, φΑ(βύ u h : h g Iu i ε I2, je 
/3, k e I4} 
is a linearly independent set. Totally, the dimension of MGC is greater than or equal to 
23 + 11 + 5 + 2 = 41. On the other hand, the orthogonal complement of MGC contains 
the three colored blocks and four upper spaces, which generate a subspace of dimension 7. 
Hence, we have dim MGC = 41. By the definition of MGC, for any 0 φ a e MGC 
and /, α Π t/,· and α Π (Δ — £/,·) are both even sets. If α Π (Δ — U<\) = 0, then a is 
generated by three reflections φι, φ2, φ?,. Repeating them, we can check that there is 
no word a e MGC with |a| = 2 . 
It is easy to see the following lemma. 
Lemma 3.2. The orthogonal complement MGC"1" of MGC has dimension 7 and it 
is spanned by U\, U2, Uj, U4 and three colored blocks Rd, Gr, Bl. In particular, if 
a € MGC±, then |a| = 0 , 16, 32, 48 or 24. The weight enumerator of MGC 
is 
x 4 8 + 3 * 3 y 6 + ΐ 2 ο * 2 ν 4 + 3 * 1 6 > > 3 2 + / 8 . 
We will show in the next section that MGC-1- coincides with the set of words of 
^-positions associated to the highest weight rows hwr(7\ V'J). 
In order to see a relation with the Golay code constructed by Miracle Octad Generator, 
it is useful to write MGC as a subspace of the set of 4 χ 12-matrices. Divide Z48 into 
three colored blocks "4 χ 4-matrices". We will introduce 4 axes Ω, (i = 1,... 
,4) 
for the reflections 0, (i = 1,..., 4) as follows. I here write only one block, but every 
colored block has the same axes.

The moonshine VOA and a tensor product of Ising models 
103 
Each axis divides 48 coordinates into 24 and 24. The 24 coordinate set containing the 
first coordinate is " i -th upper space" Uj. 
Remark 1. An important property of MGC is that it contains a lot of Hamming codes. 
For example, take i φ j and two points set β c £/,· Π Uj, then β ö φί(β) e MGC and 
for any even set a e β U φί(β), we have φ](a) U a e MGC. Hence, 
(ß U φί{β), a U 4>j(a): a e β U 0,(/3) even) 
isa [8, 4, 4]-Hamming subcode and βΌφι(β)Όφ](β)νΐφιφ](β) is a support of Hamming 
subcode. In particular, an intersection of an upper space and a colored block is a support 
of some Hamming subcode. 
Section 4. The structure of 
In this section, we will investigate the structure of VOA Va of Leech lattice Λ. Com-
paring to the moonshine VOA, it is not difficult to study its structure. 
Let (Va)0 be the fixed point set of Va by Θ, where θ is the automorphism of Va 
induced from the automorphism — 1 on Λ. V^ is the untwisted part of the moonshine 
VOA VK 
4.1. MOG. As we told at the end of the introduction, we will choose a specific set of 48 
mutually orthogonal conformal vectors in Va . Before that, we will explain the Miracle 
Octad Generator. As usual, F4 = {0,1, w, m>} denotes the finite field consisting of four 
elements with the relations 1 + w -I- w2 = 0 and w2 = w. 
The hexacode C(, is a 3-dimensional code of length 6 over F4 generated by the 
codewords 
(wwwwww), 
(wwwwww), 
(wwwwww), 
(wwwwww) 
Actually, the first three codewords generate Ce • 
We will define the Golay code C24 of length 24 as a subset of 4 χ 6 matrices as 
follows. 
First, for each element of F4, we define an odd interpretation and an even interpre-
tation. Although it is given as a 4 χ 1 column vector in [CS], we will write it by a 
row-vector here.

The codewords of C24 are defined from hexacodewords by either 
i) replacing each digit by an odd interpretation, in any way such that the top row becomes 
odd; or 
ii) replacing each digit by an even interpretation, in any way such that the top row 
becomes even.

we will see.

In V^, let Η be the set of all highest weight rows h = (A1, ...,/i 4 8) without i . 
We will see it as binary code by replacing hl = 5 by 1. The fusion rules and Lemma 3.1 
in [DMZ] implies that Η is closed by the sum, that is, Η is a linear code. We have the 
following proposition. 
Theorem 4.1. Η is isomorphic to MGC and (V^)/> = Mmgc· 
Proof. As we showed, α U 04(a) € Η for any even subset α C U4 = {1, 3, 5,..., 47}

We next study the codewords h of ^-positions of elements h = (hl) of hwr(7\ Vq). 
Theorem 4.2. The set of codewords of 
-positions of elements of hwr(7\ V^6) is equal 
to {U\, U2, f/3, Bl, Gr, Rd). 
Proof By the fusion rule of Ising models, we can ignore the action of (V®)p since the

Theorem 4.3. The set Β of codewords of 
-positions of elements of hwr(7\ Vc) is 
equal the orthogonal to (U\, U2, U3, U4, Bl, Gr, Rd). 
Proof. For any χ € Irr(P), since Mmgc and (VG)X are both inside of V", the 
vertex operators of all elements of Mmgc on ( ^ ) χ have all integer powers. Hence, 
by Proposition 5.3 in [M3], the words of (Vi)x 
of -^-positions are all orthogonal to 
MGC. Namely, it is contained in MGC"1 = (U{, U2, U3, U4, Bl, Gr, Rd). By the above 
theorem, Β contains (U1, U2, f/3, Bl, Gr, Rd). Since V] φ (VAf, 
Β should be greater 
than (i/i, U2, U2, Bl, Gr, Rd) and so Β = (Uu U2, U3, U4, Bl, Gr, Rd). 
Section 5. Automorphism group 
In this section, we will show a new way to prove that the full automorphism group V" is 
finite. This result is true in the more general situation, that is, we assume the following

(5) The Virasoro element is a sum of mutually orthogonal conformal vectors with central 
charge 
Under the above hypotheses, we have the following result. 
Theorem 5.1. Let e, f be two distinct conformal vectors with central charge 
that is, 
{e,e) = ( f , f ) = X - . 
Then we have 
( e , f ) < ± 
and so 
( e - f , e - f ) > i 
In particular, there are only finitely many conformal vectors with central charge j. 
Proof. By the product ab = a\b and the inner product (a,b) 1 = ajb, 
V2 becomes 
an algebra with an invariant bilinear form ( , ), which is called Griess algebra. Let 
Re φ Re1- be the decomposition of V2· For another conformal vector / , we have r € C 
and w G Re-1- such that 
f = re + w. 
Since (ew, e) = (w, e1) = (w, 1e) = 0, we have ew e Re-1. Moreover, we have 
Ire + 2w = If = f2 = {r22e + w2} + {(w2 - w2) + 2rew}, 
where w2
e denotes the first entry of w2 in the decomposition Re Θ Re-1-. Hence, we 
have r 2/2 + (e, w2) = (e, 2r2e + w2) = (e, f2) = {e, I f ) = <e, Ire) = r/2. 
Hence, {e,w2) = r(l — r)/2. On the other hand, we have 
\ = ( f , f ) = r2^ + 
(w,w), 
and so (w, w) = 
— r2). 
Moreover, since V\ = 0 and dim Vq = 1, if W is an 
irreducible (e) -module with (e) Π W = 0, then W c 
· Since W is isomorphic 
to L(\,h), 
W is generated by {v, enν ; η < 0} and so W Π V2 is contained in the 
highest weight space of W. Therefore, the eigenvalues of e on Re x are 0, 
or 
Hence, we have 
r/2 - r2/2 = (e, w2
e) = (e, w2) = (we, w) < ]-{w, w) = ^(1 - r2)

and so we have 3 r2 — Ar + 1 > 0 . This implies r > 1 or r < j . I f r > l , then it 
contradicts to (w,w) 
> 0. Hence we have r < | and so (e, / ) < j^. In particular, 
we have (e — /, e — f ) > ^ and so there are only finitely many conformal vectors with 
central charge \ since (V2 — {0})/(R — {0}) is a compact space.

Theorem 5.2. If V satisfies Hypotheses, then Aut(V) is finite. 
Proof. Clearly Aut(V) permutes all conformal vectors with central charge j. 
By 
Theorem 5.1, the number of conformal vectors with central charge j is finite and so a 
finite index subgroup G of Aut(V) fixes all conformal vectors. In particular, G fixes the 
set of coordinate conformal vectors point-wise so that G fixes all components of V into 
the direct sum of <g)L (^, hl). Since the Virasoro element is a sum of mutually orthogonal 
conformal vectors with central charge 5, V is a finite direct sum of <8>L(j, h'). Let 
g € G. 
Then g is an identity on Τ and acts as scalar multiples on 
j) and 
yg). Using the fusion rules of the Ising model, we can prove that g4 = 1. Then G 
is compact. Thus G is finite. 
Section 6. Multiplicity of irreducible Γ-modules 
Now we want to show the list of the multiplicity of irreducible 
0)-module Lh 
with highest weight row h = (hl). Let L be a Τ -submodule of V11 with word h, then h 
is in MGC1 by Theorem 4.3. In particular, the weight \h\ is 0, 16, 32, 48, or 24. Set 
K^ = {a e MGC : a c h}. The important thing is that K^ contains a direct sum E^ of 
Hamming codes such that Λ is a code of E^ with the maximum weight. For example, if 
|Λ| = 24, then K^ contains a direct product 
φ 
φ H% of 3 Hamming codes. By 
Corollary 5.2 in [M3], we have: 
Lemma 6.1. Let h = (hl) e hwr(7\ V") and let h denote the word of 
positions of 
h. Then the multiplicity of Τ -irreducible submodule with highest weight row h is 
21*1/2. 
By Lemma 6.1, the investigation in §4, and the fact that the sums ^ h' are integers, 
we have the following theorem. 
Main Theorem. If \h\ = 0 , then mult(/i) = 1. 
h € hwr(7\ V") ο h = -a : a e MGC. 
2 
Here we view a word a as in Z 4 8 and mult(/i) denotes the multplicity of irreducible 
Γ-module with highest weight row h. 
If \h\ = 24, then \K-h\ = 2 1 1 + 5 + 2 and so mult(Ä) = 26.

where r, = (0,..., 0, 1, 0,... 0) and i £ h. 
If \h\ = 16, then \K~h \ = 2 7 + 3 + 1 and so mult(Ä) = 23.
