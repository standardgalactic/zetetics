Mapping WordNet to Basic Formal Ontology  
using the KYOTO ontology	  
Summary	  
Background: Ontologies are 
used with natural language 
processing (NLP) tools to carry 
out ontology-related text 
manipulation tasks.  
These tasks require coupling 
lexico-semantic resources with 
ontologies, such as upper-level 
ontologies that are extended by 
domain-specific ontologies. 
Issue: No lexico-semantic 
resource available for the Basic 
Formal Ontology (BFO), widely 
used in the biomedical domain. 
Hypothesis:  A large portion of 
WordNet synsets, especially 
nouns and verbs, can be semi-
automatically mapped to BFO 
using simple mapping rules.  
Goal: Semi-automatically 
mapping WordNet 3.0 
to BFO 2.0.  
Outcome: A lexico-semantic 
resource that could be used in 
NLP tools.

Discussion	  2	  
Non-trivial mappings 
Issues: 
•  DOLCE and BFO categories don’t 
all align and their axioms may 
conflict. 
•  WordNet includes synsets that, in 
BFO terms, do not independently 
refer (e.g. positive.a.04).  
Solutions:  
•  Extend the coverage of the rules. 
•  Ignore the axiomatizations.  
Rationale:  
•  Work neither aimed at mapping 
DOLCE to BFO, nor at axiomatizing 
WordNet. 
•  Instead, answering the question: to 
what types of entities do WordNet 
synsets refer? 
•  Even a partial mapping should 
cover a large portion of WordNet, 
leaving a smaller subset of 
problematic cases.  
Challenge: Providing BFO-compliant 
interpretations of unmatched 
WordNet synsets.

Conclusion	  and	  future	  
work	  
Preliminary results:  
Encouraging, but more work is 
needed to see if the method scales 
to the full WordNet.  
Future work:  
•  Extending the evaluation set of 
medical synsets using hyponymy 
relations and other domain 
resources. 
•  Carrying out more thorough 
evaluations. 
•  Augmenting the mapping rules by 
exploiting other resources.

Evalua>on	  and	  preliminary	  results	  
• Manual evaluation on 106 
synsets marked ‘medicine’ in 
KYOTO. 
• All nouns and verbs were 
correctly categorized. 
• Incorrect mappings were  
mostly adjectives.

Indirect mapping 
Issue: WordNet is too large to be 
manually mapped to BFO.  
Possible solution: Mapping top 
levels of WordNet to BFO and 
propagating mappings 
downwards.  
Subsequent issues: 
•  WordNet fails to comply with 
basic ontological principles.  
•  Would only cover nouns and 
verbs. 
Solution: Use the KYOTO 
ontology, which also includes 
adjectives.
