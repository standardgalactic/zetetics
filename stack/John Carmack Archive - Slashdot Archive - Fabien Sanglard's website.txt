SGI Steps out of the Visual Workstation Mar-
ket - Nov 1999
1.2.1
Re:Changing Market
I am typing this on a loaded SGI 320.
When it debuted, it was a very good all around performar, and it had the
highest ﬁll rate of any intel based system.
Now, an Nvidia GeForce is just plain superior in almost every aspect.
Higher ﬁll rate, even in high res, 32 bit, trilinear modes. Faster, more
capable geometry acceleration.
Any remaining areas of SGI superiority are probably due to driver opti-
mization rather than hardware architecture. Nvidia hasn’t had much call
to optimize stippled lines, for instance.
The super-memory-system wasn’t all it was touted to be. It worked well
for sharing the load between the graphics and the cpu, but the cpu didn’t
actually see any better bandwidth than on a standard intel chipset. The
cpu write bandwidth was actually about 10% LOWER than a consumer
machine.
I have used a lot of intergraph and sgi machines, and the bottom line is
that the consumer hardware has just outpaced the workstation hardware
because they were on different growth curves. The workstations are bet-
ter than they have ever been, but the consumer systems are just orders of
magnitude better than they used to be.

When the article ﬁrst showed up, I thought ”It IS documented in the re-

the previous release didn’t make it into the latest release. Sigh. Our fuckup.
Apropriate quote: ”Never attribute to malice what can be explained by
incompetence”.
I remain unconvinced that we have done something morally offensive.
Yes, we could have (should have, meant to) included a notice that it was
going on in the EULA, but honestly, how many people carefully read and
consider every line of all the EULA’s they click through? How much of a
difference would that have made to people?

Data like that is helpfull in making good development decisions.
But this is just a driver string riding along with your game version. It just
seems silly, like requiring you to acknowledge before leaving your house
that someone might see you. I would rather have ﬁxed a bug somewhere.
I can see that it is a slipperly slope to be on, and I can easily project it to a

knowing the reletive distribution of different OpenGL implementations
is violating people’s rights.
The system was set up to allow us to notify people with a one-line mes-

fended even by that, but I consider that a positive service to the commu-

Including the renderer string was an afterthought to get some good un-

Nope. We are the copyright holder of all works, and we can release any

Completely aside from that, I think it is still unclear exactly where the
GPL wants the separation of code and content.
Few would argue that every document read by a GPL word processor
would be covered by the GPL, and most would place maps entered by
quake into that catagory, but things can quickly get murky.
Quake game mods are written in QC, but turned into data to be pro-
cessed by the main code. I think the spirit of the GPL would want that

every program loaded by a GPL operating system must be GPL, which is

Games - Quake GPL Release Causing Cheat-
ing - Dec 1999
1.6.1
Some more depth
First, the Quake architecture of (reletively) dumb clients conencted to
an authoritative server prevents the egregious cheating possible in some
games (”I say you are dead now!”, ”I say I have inﬁnite ammo!”).
For the most part, a cheating client can’t make their character do any-
thing that couldn’t happen as a result of normal game interaction.
The cheating clients/proxies focus on two main areas – giving the player
more information than they should have, and performing actions more
skillfully.
The ”more information” part can take a number of forms. A reletively
harmless one is adding timers for items and powerups. Good players
will track a lot of that in their heads, but a simple program can ”remind”
players of it.
Media cheating provides more information. Changing all the other player
skins to bright white and removing all the shadows from a level give play-
ers an advantage not within the spirit of the game. Some would say crank-
ing your screen brightness and gamma way up is one step on that path.
More advanced clients can make available information that is not nor-
mally visible at all. The server sends over all of the entities in the poten-
tially visible set, because the client can move around a fair amount be-
tween updates. This means that the client is often aware of the locations
of players that are around corners. A proxy can display this information
in a ”scanner window”. The server could be changed to only send over
clients actually visible, but that would result in lots of players blinking in
and out as you move around or turn rapidly.
The worst cheats are the aim bots. In addition to providing more infor-
mation, they override the player’s commands to aim and ﬁre with very
high accuracy. The player usually ”drives” around the level, and the pro-

gram aims and shoots for them. This is usually extremely devestating
and does ruin the game for most people.
There are many possible countermeasures.
There are server-side countermeasures that look for sequences of moves
that are likely to be bot-generated and not human-generated, but that is
an arms race that will end with skilled human players eventually getting
identiﬁed as subtle bots.
Media cheats can be protected by various checksums, as we do in Q3
with the sv pure option. This is only effective if the network protocol is
not compromised, because otherwise a proxy can tell the client that it’s
hacked media are actually ok.
If the network protocol is not known, then the extra-information cheats
generally can’t happen unless you can hack the client source.
Q3 performs various bits of encryption on the network protocol, but that
is only relying on security through obscurity, and a sufﬁciently patient
person with a disassembler can eventually backtrack what is happening.
If only they would ﬁnd something more usefull to spend their time on...
With an open source client, the network communication protocol is right
there in the open, so any encryption would be futile.
Any attempt at having the client verify itself isn’t going to work out, be-
cause a cheating client can just always tell you what you want to hear.
People have mentioned nettreck several times, but I don’t see how a com-
pletelty open source program can keep someone from just reporting what
it is supposed to for a while (perhapse using a ”real” copy to generate
whatever digests are asked for), then switching to new methods. Anyone
care to elaborate?
I think a reasonable plan is to modify QW so that to play in ”competi-
tion mode”, it would have to be launched by a separate closed-source
program that does all sorts of encryption and veriﬁcation of the environ-
ment. If it just veriﬁes the client, it would prevent the trivial modiﬁed
client scanners and aim bots. It could verify the media data to prevent
media information cheating. To prevent proxy information cheating and
aim bots, it would have to encrypt the entire data stream, not just the

connection process. That might have negative consequences on latency
unless the encrypter is somehow able to be in the same address space
as the veriﬁed client or scheduling can be tweaked enough to force task
switches right after sends.
In the end, it is just a matter of making it more difﬁcult for the cheaters.
If all it takes is editing and recompiling a ﬁle, lots of people will cheat.
This is indeed a disadvantage of open source games. If they have to
grovel over huge network dumps and disassemblies to hack a protocol,
a smaller number of cheats will be available.
Even if the programs were completely guaranteed secure (I havem’t been
convinced that is possible even in theory), an aim bot could be imple-
mented at the device driver level.
It would be a lot more work, but a program could be implemented that
intercepts the video driver, the mouse driver, and the keyboard driver,
and does bot calculations completely from that.
Kind of sucks, doesn’t it?

I think everyone can agree that it just isn’t possible to solve the problem
completely, you can only make it more difﬁcult, which is exactly what the
netrek solution is – release binaries without the exact source and make it
difﬁcult to decypher.

Re:Who says,,,
An Nvidia GeForce/quadro kicks the crap out of a $100k+ SGI reality en-
gine on just about any test you could devise.
The reality engine is quite a few years old, and its follow on, the inﬁnite
reality and IR2 still have some honest advantages. You can scale them
with enough raster boards so that they have more ﬁll rate, and they do
have some other important features like conﬁgurable multisample anti-
aliasing and 48 bit color.
Even now, lots of applications can be compiled on both platforms and
just run much better on WinNT+nvidia than on the best sgi platform
available. Having a 700mhz+ main processor helps, irrespective of the
graphics card.
Some people still have a knee-jerk reaction that claims that ”real appli-
cations” still run better on the high end hardware, and there are indeed
some examples, but the argument bears a whole lot of resemblence to
the ones put forth by the last defenders of ECL vector supercomputers.
Most people’s applications don’t show advantages on high end SGI hard-
ware.
The big issue is the pace of progress – SGI aimed for a new graphics family
every three years with a speed bump in between. The PC vendors aim for
a new generation every year with a speed bump at six months.

die. Supercomputers were always so COOL, but for most things, they just
aren’t so ”super” any more.
I have benchmarked several of my back end utilities on cray systems, and
one of them on the early tera machine (the early compiler exploded on
the others). None of the single processor runs were as fast as a pentium
III, and this was quite some time ago.
Understand that this was often branchy and recursive code running with
only 3D sized vectors, so it isn’t the sweet spot for traditional supercom-
puters. If I was doing nothing but multiplying 1k by 1k matricies of dou-
bles, even a ﬁve year old cray would kick the crap out of the latest athalon.
Unfortunately, none of my code looks like that.
I even spent some time thinking how I could restructure calculations into
a vectorizable form, which might make a cray J90 competative. I wanted
to buy a Cray! Of course, this was silly. It took less effort to make the code
SMP friendly, and the payoff was much larger.
We wound up with a 16 processor SGI origin-2000 system, which has
been easy to develop for and predictable in performance. We just re-
cently bought an 8 processor Xeon, which is actually faster than our old
16 processor SGI, but at exactly one tenth the price (the downside is that
it is maxed out, while the SGI still has tons of growth potential).
I program all heavy workloads in a parallel fashion now as a matter of
habit, but it is easy to overstate the beneﬁts of parallel systems.
The common lunux advocate position of ”beowulf makes supercomput-
ers obsolete” isn’t quite right. Even with code that is already written in
a parallel manner, there is a large difference between developing for a
shared memory system and a distributed cluster. Developing a compute
(and especially data) intensive program for a cluster rather sucks.
If there was a single processor system that was really four times as fast
as ”consumer” machines, even if it cost ﬁfty times as much, we would
buy it. Unfortunately, there isn’t. When the product release cycles are
favorable, Alpha systems may be twice as good as x86 systems, but not
much beyond that unless you are doing the 1k by 1k matrix type stuff.
It is often forgotten that the original Cray-1 was largely a success because

it was the fastest SCALAR processor of the time. The vectorization was
just a bonus. Now, vectorization is the only thing that gives them a reason
for existance.
The tera architecture is very interesting, but for scalar code, it is VERY,
VERY slow. I’m not sure if it will be competative with large processor
count SGI origin-2000 systems even after it matures. It gains ease of pro-
gramming from the lack of caches, but it gives away a lot of problem do-
mains where it is going to look stupidly slow.
If a supercomputer company could make a scalar processor that ran many
times faster than existing processors and had similar SMP capabilities,
it would probably be a success. Even if it cost a million dollars, ﬁlled a
room, and burned hundreds of kwatts.
The problem isn’t really that supercomputers are bad, its just that we are
so spoiled by how AMAZINGLY GOOD our cheap consumer hardware is.
I do still worry about the stifﬂing of innovation that comes from having
so few architectural directions for systems, but in the end, wall clock per-
formance is what really matters.

Ah, the Jaguar...
I actually dug up all my old jaguar development hardware to give to these
guys a year or two ago.
Unfortunately, it turned out that I had lost the C compiler that I had re-
targeted to the jaguar RISC engines, so DOOM was no longer buildable.
There is something noble about developing on a dead platform – it is
so completely for the joy of the development, without any commercial
motivation.

The quick recap on the jaguar:
The memory, bus, blitter and video processor were 64 bits wide, but the
processors (68k and two custom risc processors) were 32 bit.
The blitter could do basic texture mapping of horizontal and vertical spans,
but because there wasn’t any caching involved, every pixel caused two
ram page misses and only used 1/4 of the 64 bit bus. Two 64 bit buffers
would have easily trippled texture mapping performance. Unfortunate.
It could make better use of the 64 bit bus with Z buffered, shaded trian-
gles, but that didn’t make for compelling games.
It offered a usefull color space option that allowed you to do lighting ef-
fects based on a single channel, isntead of RGB.
The video compositing engine was the most innovative part of the con-
sole. All of the characters in Wolf3D were done with just the back end
scalar instead of blitting. Still, the experience with the limitations and
hard failure cases of that gave me good amunition to rail against mi-
crosoft’s (thankfully aborted) talisman project.
The little risc engined were decent processors. I was surprised that they
didn’t use off the shelf designs, but they basically worked ok. They had
some design hazards (write after write) that didn’t get ﬁxed, but the only
thing truly wrong with them was that they had scratchpad memory in-
stead of caches, and couldn’t execute code from main memory. I had
to chunk the DOOM renderer into nine sequentially loaded overlays to
get it working (with hindsight, I would have done it differently in about
three...).
The 68k was slow. This was the primary problem of the system. You op-
tions were either taking it easy, running everything on the 68k, and go-
ing slow, or sweating over lots of overlayed parallel asm chunks to make
something go fast on the risc processors.
That is why playstation kicked so much ass for development – it was pro-
grammed like a single serial processor with a single fast accelerator.
If the jaguar had dumped the 68k and offered a dynamic cache on the
risc processors and had a tiny bit of buffering on the blitter, it could have

put up a reasonable ﬁght against sony.
Now the LYNX, on the other hand, was very much The Right Thing from
a programming standpoint. A fast little processor (for its niche), a good
color bitmapped display, and a general purpose blitter.
Price and form factor weighed too heavily against it.

Re:Ah, the Jaguar...
Actually, I believe you’re referring to Carl Forhan of Songbird Productions
Heh, sorry... I just assumed all jaguar development was coming from a
single crazy group. :-)
Even if the memory controller hadn’t been broken, performance would
still have sucked really bad without a cache.
The jaguar was deﬁnately signiﬁcantly hampered by its technical ﬂaws,
which kept me from ever being too big of a jaguar booster. I was proud
of my work on Wolf and DOOM (more so than just about any of the other
console work Id has been involved in until just recently), but in the end,
the better consoles won the war.

I was only into the Apple II/IIGS during the Amiga’s strong times, so I

when I was young and the Amiga looked interesting, I couldn’t afford one.
When I had the means, I no longer had the desire.
I certainly don’t mean to imply that all Amiga users are fanatics, just that
the advocates that made it to my mailbox were less well mannered than
those for many other platforms. You are right, it did color my response.
So, to give you a somewhat better answer:
The Amiga’s success was in demonstrating the large beneﬁts of special-
ized graphics coprocessors for personal computers, and providing close
to a workstation like environment while the PC was still struggling with
segment registers in dos.
It wouldn’t have been obvious at the time, but the Amiga was basically
fated to go the way of a console generation, rather than evolve as the PC
or mac did.
The reliance on low level hardware knowledge and programming pro-
vided the obvious visual superiority, but also locked it in to a very un-
gracefull evolution.

Nvidia’s drivers will have strong points
I have been working on the utah-glx project for about nine months now.
I am proud of what we have accomplished, and I think it has been a good
example of a working open source project. Matrox and ATI have been
pleasantly surprised at how well things have worked out.
However, there are only a half dozen coders working part time on utah-
glx, and we are split among three active chipset trees. Nvidia has more
people than that working full time exclusively for their chips. We are
pretty good. So are they. We can work from specs. They can go interro-

their driver to be better than our drivers.
Nvidia is working to maintain a common source base between their win-
dows drivers and their linux drivers. Bugs tracked down by the order of
magnitude more windows users will be ﬁxed automatically in the linux
version.
DRI does not have all of its problems solved, and there are valid reasons
for them to not use it. They might change their mind later.
It should be remembered that some people want to do 3D graphics on
linux and don’t care about open source principles. Most of the people
coming from a technical workstation background just want a vendor to
deliver a tool to help them get their work done. I also suspect that most
game players will choose a faster driver, even if it is closed source.
The choice isn’t between making their driver open source or closed source.
They CAN’T open source it because of legal encumbrances on the code.
The choice is between doing a closed source driver with their existing
code, and doing a completely new driver. Not too many people get ex-
cited at the prospect of rewriting perfectly good code.
If you care about getting open source drivers, support Matrox, 3dfx, or
ATI. They have released specs to the community, and put out cash for PI
to develop and support DRI drivers.
If you just want good 3D, I think nvidia will satisfy you. As for not being
done yet, it hasn’t been that long since Xfree 4.0 shipped.

cards are really, really fast.
Yes, it is almost completely pointless.
The only reasonable argument for super high framerates is to do multi
frame composited motion blur, but it turns out that it isn’t all that im-
pressive.
I did a set of ofﬂine renderings of running Q3 at 1000 fps and blend-
ing down to 60 fps for display. Looked at individually, the screenshots
were AWESOME, with characters blurring through their animations and
gibs streaking off the screen, but when they were played at 60hz, nobody
could tell the difference even side by side.
Motion blur is more important at 24hz movie speeds, but at higher mon-
itor retrace rates it really doesn’t matter much.
There are some poster-child cases for it, like a spinning wagon wheel, but
for most aspects of a FPS, realistic motion blur isn’t noticable.
Exagerated motion blur (light sabers, etc) is a separate issue, and doesn’t
require ultra-high framerates.
There are still plenty of things we can usefully burn faster cpu’s on...

I was elated when Apple announced the original Open Source Darwin

After all that work, including pressing CD’s, it was met with a fairly re-
sounding silence.
The darwin mailing lists were dead. It sometimes seemed like there were
a grand total of a dozen people with darwin installed.
It was looking like this might go down as a large example of how going to
the trouble of Open Source doesn’t get you anything but hassle.
It didn’t help that darwin was basically unusable by itself, because all you
got was a single very slow text console with messed up key bindings. Not
exactly a happy development environment.
(most of the active development work is done in the usable environment
of OS-X server)
The general response that interested people gave as to why they weren’t
doing any development with darwin was that ”everything is going to change
in the next release” (the driver architecture was massively reworked).
Well, the new release is here now. There is still the problematic issue that
you can’t run ANY current gui on darwin 1.0. OS-X server and the devel-
oper seeds of OS-X client are both out of sync with the darwin codebase.
All the excuses won’t really go away until the next OS-X client release.
A couple months ago, I took on the porting of X windows to Darwin, so it
could actually be considered halfway usable by itself.
I released the patches to get X windows running under MacOS-X server,
which was basically the same core as the earlier darwin release.
I was then given the same excuse as other people – why bother porting to
the native darwin video and input drivers if everything is going to change
soon?
As of now, I am actively feeling guilty about not ﬁnishing it. Everything is
there for me now, I just need to ﬁnd the time.
I had been spending my weekends on either GLX or darwin X server work
after Q3 shipped, but my R&D ”research” has shifted to ”development”
faster than I expected, and the past few weekends have been monop-
olized by new engine work. I’ll get to it within the next month, but if

It may turn out that many of ESR’s arguments just don’t pan out for Apple,
as far as having outsiders improve the core codebase. Even so, releasing

You can’t just choose to rotate a drive platter 100 times faster. It may be
remotely possible to make a 50,000 rpm drive in the near term, but 100x
faster (and larger diameter) is WAY beyond the limits of known materials.
It could also double as a dandy KE tank killer or space launch system if it
could actually be built...
The limitation isn’t the ability to read the data off the platter, it is the

I speciﬁcally asked Steve Jobs about this last time I talked with him (sev-

Not that he isn’t allowed to change his mind about things...
I was pushing for including at least the command line compile/link tools
with every install, but NeXT had an established history of having the de-
velopment tools all on a separate CD, so it doesn’t look like that is going
to happen.

Re:I don’t get it
The real answer is just inertia from NeXT, but there are some true techni-
cal advantages to the mach base.
The mach interfaces for virtual memory and task communication have
more scope than the standard unix ones. I was rather surprised when
I found out that linux memory management is still basically based on
sbrk (although you can fake up virtual memory objects with mapped ﬁles
yourself).
There deﬁnately is some weirdness when you can have so many different
types of threads: mach threads/tasks, unix tasks (threads also?), AppKit
threads, and possibly some form of Carbon threads. They all come down
to mach primitives, but they aren’t interchangable.

The ”key generators” are all fakes. Some of them look like they work for

let you in again.
As far as we know, there are no real key generators. If there were, we
would have much more signiﬁcant support issues.
We certainly will drop the CD-in-the-drive-for-single-player check in a

Re:It’s Too Late For OpenGL
It is interesting watching the way the tides of public opinion ﬂow around
some technical issues.
Over the last year or two, it was amazing the amount of panic among
hardware companies that Sony caused with the PlayStation 2. Engineers
that really should have known better were walking around with a paniced
look, thinking ”my god, they are going to crush us, we need to rethink ev-
erything!”. It was disturbing to see PR effect technical people that much.
PS2 is unquestionably the most powerfull console, but it is a straightfor-
ward evolutionary step in power, not the ”unprecedented leap forward”
that it was billed (and perceived) as. People generally realize that now.
Microsoft seems to have captured much of the same sense of technical
inevitability with DX8.

DX8 is good. Microsoft has a long history of shipping an initially crappy
product (DX3), then aggressively improving it until it is competative or
superior to everything else. Many people underestimate the quality of
microsoft’s products by only forming opinions on early versions, and never
revising them.
The crucial advances of DX8 are the vertex and pixel shaders. I think that
the basic concepts are strong, and they will give real beneﬁts.
I expect that that functionality will be exposed through OpenGL exten-
sions by the time I need it.
For one thing, DX8 is modeled pretty closely on Nvidia’s hardware, and
Nvidia’s hardware is already fully exposed through their register com-
biner extension, even somewhat moreso than under DX.
The issue will be ﬁnding consensus between the other hardware vendors.
The upside is that not all hardware designs are exactly in line with DX8,
and some usefull and interesting features exist that DX8 doesn’t expose.
It is looking like several hardware vendors are making moves to expose
ALL of their functionality through OpenGL extensions to be available
when the product ships, rather than at the next DX cycle.
The other issue is still portability. I am 100% committed to delivering our
next title on linux and MacOSX (NOT MaxOS-9), in an effectively simul-
tanious timeframe. That would be more troublesome if I was gung-ho for
DX8.
I’m happy that microsoft is doing a better job, but I don’t feel that I will
be in a disadvantaged position continuing to work with OpenGL.

The X-Box should be able to keep up for a while, because you can usually
expect to get about twice the performance out of a ﬁxed platform as you
would when shooting for the broad PC space, just because you can code
much more speciﬁcally.

Science - Inventor Building Rocket In Back-
yard - Jun 2000
1.22.1
Aerodynamically unstable!
At ﬁrst I thought it was just bad reporting, with ”Most of the weight will
be behind, and gravity will keep the rocket pointed upward”, but seeing
the picture on his site backs that up.
Putting a big, ﬁn-looking cockpit ahead of the fuel tank mass is going to
make every breeze cause a heading change.
His site goes on with:
”What about guidance systems? The thrust will come out at the top of
the rocket. An early American pioneer Robert Goddard did the same
thing with his early test rockets. The rocket should ”hang down” from
the thrust like a pendulum”
That DOESN’T WORK.
It doesn’t matter if a rocket is being pulled or pushed, all that matters is
the relationship of the center of gravity to the center of pressure.
The reason why the intuitive ”hangs like a pendulum” doesn’t work out is
that gravity acts on a deﬂected pendulum in a direction out of line with
the pendulum string, while a rocket thrust will always be in line with the

body.
1.22.2
Re:What kind of unstable?
A pendulum has a pivot point, so when gravity tries to pull the center of
gravity towards the earth, the linear acceleration is converted to a rota-
tion torque around the pivot point, swinging the pendulum back down..
A rocket isn’t held by anything, so the force of gravity will only pull it
downwards, not cause any rotation. Gravity can’t cause a rotation (ig-
noring very large scale gravity gradient issues), only aerodynamic forces.
Any wind will cause a rotation based on the CG/CP relationship, which
will not be corrected by forward aerodynamic forces in this case because
CP is forward of CG.
The truth is that I used to think along the same lines as this theory, but I
built a couple models to test it, and they were complete failures.
After thinking about it for a while, I realized the difference between hang-
ing from a pivot and having a force along the body.
1.22.3
Re:What kind of unstable?
All forces acting on a body can be summed to a vector through the CG
and a rotation around it.
The thrust coming out at the nose or tail doesn’t matter, it will still act
through the CG.
—R ! ! ! ! CG !
With a rocket exhausting down from R, there will be both an upwards
acceleration and a clockwise rotation. That obviously won’t ﬂy straight.
—–R ! R ! ! ! CG !
With two rockets (or any symetric number), the rotational forces can-
cel out, leaving just a forward acceleration acting through CG. Again, no

matter where the forces are applied to a rigid body, they act through CG.
This rocket will ﬂy straight in an airless vaccuum, or in a perfect world
with non-moving air and EXACTLY balanced engine thrust.
When a body has a center of pressure that isn’t exactly at the center of
gravity (almost everything but symetric and uniform blocks of material),
a sideways gust of wind will cause a slight rotation of the rocket around
around CG.
—–R ! R ! !W ! CG !
If a wind force acts to the left at W, it will cause an acceleration to the
left through the CG and a counter-clockwise torque around CG. The ex-
istance of other forces on the same body have no effect whatsoever on
this. The rockets don’t thrust ”down” (which WOULD cause a corrective
force), they thrust ”along the rocket”.
A ”stable” rocket will have the CP behind the CG, which causes the much
larger forward aerodynamic forces to swing the rocket back towards it’s
direction of travel. That’s why there is a minimum stable launch speed
for unguided rockets – the forward aerodynamic forces have to be larger
than the sideways winds.
An ”unstable” rocket with CP ahead of CG will ﬂy straight as long as there
are no winds and it is pointed exactly in it’s direction of travel. As soon
as there is a slight rotation, the forward aerodynamic forces push it in
the same direction as the existing disturbance, reinforcing it into a rapid
spin.
Direction of travel determines the orientation of CG and CP. This rocket
will be stable when falling down, just not when ﬂying up.
Again, the pendulum is different because it is not a single rigid body. If
you didn’t hook a bendulum to anything, it would fall without any rota-
tion in an airless space, and would ﬂy with it’s CG (the ball) ahead of it’s
CP if thrown.

Games - John Carmack on the X-box Advi-
sory Board? - Jul 2000
1.23.1
Substantiated.
Geez, I don’t think this really rates a news story...
I put off an interviewer with questions about the X-Box by saying that I
was on the X-Box Advisory Board, and probably shouldn’t discuss speciﬁcs,
instead of just my usual ”sorry, too busy” reply.
Here is the longer answer:
At last years CGDC, Tim Sweeny and I had a meeting with Bill Gates about
the X-Box. It was not handled well.
For weeks ahead of time, I had been pressing for technical information so
I could have something useful to comment on at the meeting. A couple
days before the meeting, I ﬁnally got an email directing me to ”look at
this EETimes article, they are pretty close”. Yeah. Ok.
So, we just wound up just talking about generalities.
A while later, I was contacted about being on the formal advisory board,
with a promise that it wouldn’t be like that ”trophy meeting” at CGDC,
but would be making critiques of real documents.
I am on a lot of advisory boards, and they vary quite a bit in level of par-
ticipation.
3DFX’s advisory board meets every quarter, and we go over detailed tech-
nical things. Unfortunately, the very ﬁrst advisory board of over two years
ago discussed a part that still hasn’t shipped, so it is hard to say what the
impact is.
Apple’s gaming advisory board has met three times, and was moderately
productive.

a couple times a year privately, but I haven’t had a whole lot to complain
about or suggest to them since they got past the RIVA 128 (until the recent
push for 64 bit color)– they have been doing a great job.
All of the other companies just informally stop by everey once in a while
to discuss things.
I had made some suggestions to microsoft about DirectSound and Di-
rectInput in past years that were always at the wrong time to ever get
acted upon, so I don’t know what to expect from this board.
So far, microsoft seems to be sticking to the plan – I got a big fat binder of
stuff in today to look over before our meeting next week.
I’m all for the X-Box as a console platform. The graphics hardware is a lot
cooler than PS2, and there are a lot of other things going for it. I am still
uneasy about all the market protection issues that go with consoles, but
I tend to think that microsoft is a more open company than many of the
traditional console companies.
I want microsoft to make good products. Heck, I want everyone to make
good products. Even at the height of the D3D vs OpenGL antagonism, I
had always given them source drops of what I was working on, and free-
dom to use it for demonstrating new features.
I had hoped that they would use it as a real-world testbed for new fea-
tures, rather than just dreaming them up and making the industry follow
their plan without ever really testing things out.
In any case, talking with MS has no bearing on my development deci-
sions. I’m still using OpenGL, and we are still planning simultanious re-
leases for linux and MacOS-X. If things work out well with X-Box, that
may be added to the list.

1.24.1
Re:That wasn’t the carmack we know..
what happened to that? apart from it: can you imagine ID coding some-
thing in c++
First of all, the fact that none of our deployed games used OOP does not
mean that I don’t think there are beneﬁts to it. In the early days, there
were portability, performance, and bloat problems with it, so we never
chose to deploy with it. However, all of the tools for DOOM and Quake
were developed in Obejctive-C on NEXTSTEP. Q3 also came fairly close
to have a JVM instead of the QVM interpreter, but it didn’t quite ﬁt my
needs.
I’m still not a huge C++ fan, but anyone that will ﬂat out deny the beneﬁts
of OOP for some speciﬁc classes of problems like UI programming and
some game logic is bordering on being a luddite. I still don’t think it is
beneﬁcial everywhere, but, if anything, I think we are behind the curve
on making the transition.
Carmack basically said, that single-player games suck from a money/replayability
point of view
This was a balancing act in company morale and politics. My ﬁrst choice
for future projects would be to pursue the snowcrash-like extensible vir-
tual worlds, but most of the company wants to work on a game with a
story. We have three new hires coming on soon, so we are growing some-
what to support it.
In the same interview he said, that he doesn’t like integrated editors, and
will never do so.

argument (I went over this some in the talk):
Historically, we could make better games by using exotic and expensive

development hardware or software that differed signiﬁcantly from our
deployment platform.
While early games with integrated editors were hurting their 640k mem-
ory footprint and forcing developers to work with a 320 or 640 res screen
for tool development, we were using NeXT workstations with megapixel
displays for our tools.
Given the option of a good rendering technology that required a lot of
preprocessing, we bought ﬁrst a quad alpha, then a 16 way SGI to do the
processing.
Even when we moved the editor to WinNT, it used intergraph worksta-
tion graphics, while our deployment platform was mostly still software
rendered or possibly Voodoo based.
The key thing that changed (after that earlier speech) was that the opti-
mal development platform is now the same thing as the optimal deploy-
ment platform: x86 + nvidia.
That is important. The tools/editor/game HAD to be separate before.
Now, the question has to be looked at with a fresh view.
There was a lot of code that was present in nearly identical form in the
utils, editor, and game. Misc functions, image loading, model loading,
pk3 ﬁlesystem support, etc. It was one of my big goals to make all that

with the many thousands of lines of code that got removed, and the in-

the editor.
I do fret about code bloat issues, but I feel quite good about all of the

Alright. This is wierd. However, it’s a natural progression. If we have
ingame editing, most likely we won’t be using BSP trees anymore, or per-
haps we will turn culling off when we walk around. I think such a thing
could be handled as a mod in the game. It just makes more sense than
some win32 app that has completely different requirements than the game
itself
”In game editor” is probably being confused here somewhat. I am NOT
talking about running around in the game, moving brushes around as
you play. The editor is still a completely different user interface, with
multi-view outlined drawing in addition to a 3D view. It just happens to
live in the same executable as the game, and shares lots of code with it.

I think Loki did a fantastic job - they went above and beyond what was
required, pestering us (a good thing in this case) about the linux deliver-
ables, taking pre-orders, doing the tin box run, shipping CDs ﬁrst, then
boxes when available, etc.
There are a number of possible reasons why you might not have bought
the linux speciﬁc version:
You couldn’t ﬁnd the game in stores near you. This is going to remain a
problem for quite some time.
The game is available earlier for windows. Even with a simultaneous re-
lease, this is going to continue. Big publishers making large lot runs get
priority, and that is just life.
The game costs more for linux. This is probably also not going to change.
The wholesale prices are probably the same, but big stores severely dis-
count popular titles and advertise them to bring customers in. This won’t
happen with linux versions.
Conﬁguring 3D on linux is a signiﬁcant chore. I expect this will largely
be gone by the time we ship another game. As the DRI drivers mature
and XF4.0 becomes standard in distributions, people should start having
out-of-box 3D support.
The game runs slower in linux than under windows. While we did have
a couple benchmark victories on some cards, the general rule will still
stand: a high performance card on windows will probably have more
signiﬁcant effort expended on optimization than it will get from an open
source driver. Nvidia’s drivers may be the exception, because all of their
windows optimization work immediately applies to the linux version, but
it is valid for most of the mesa based drivers.
Trying to change this would probably have negative long-term conse-
quences. There are certainly coders in the open source community that
are every bit as good of optimizers as the driver writers at the card com-
panies, but I have always tried to restrain them from going gung-ho at
winning benchmarks against windows. Mesa is going to be with us ﬁve
years from now, and dodgy optimizations are going to make future work
a lot more difﬁcult.

Loki’s position is that the free availability of linux executables for down-
load to convert windows versions into linux versions was the primary fac-
tor. They have been recommending that we stop making full executables
available, and only do binary patches.
I hate binary patches, and I think that going down that road would be
making life more difﬁcult for the people playing our games.
That becomes the crucial question: How much inconvenience is it worth
to help nurture a new market? We tried a small bit of it with Q3 by not
making the linux executables available for a while. Is it worth even more?
The upside is that a visibly healthy independent market would bring more
titles to it.
The fallback position is to just have hybrid CD’s. I’m pretty sure we can
force our publishers to have a linux executable in an ”unsupported” di-
rectory. You would lose technical support, you wouldn’t get an install
program, and you wouldn’t have anyone that is really dedicated to the
issues of the product, but it would be there on day 1.

Page ﬂipping should not be supported.
All signs are pointing towards a future without page ﬂipping, so adding
the messy infrastructure for it now would be a mistake. Don’t let bench-
marking furor encourage a messy code architecture.
Points:
The beneﬁt of page ﬂipping is decreasing as more and more computation
is done per pixel to the back buffer.
In the old days of 2D scrollers, you might barely cover the screen with one
pass of writes, so page ﬂipping could double your speed over blitting.

On a typical modern 3D game that becomes ﬁll limited, under 25% of the
performance is in the blit, and often under 10% in scenes with signiﬁcant
overdraw.
In upcoming games that composite 20+ layers of textures, the cost of a
blit is down in the noise.
Blits add ﬂexibility. Anti-aliasing is better done through a blit operation
than with a deep front buffer. Other operations, like converting from a
64 bit work pixel to a 32 bit display pixel, or performing convolutions, are
also better done with blits.
Back buffers are more optimally arranged in tiled patterns, while front
buffers prefer linear scans.
Basically, our back buffers are starting to look less like raster
Page ﬂipping doesn’t apply to windowed rendering unless you butcher
the X server to render all 2D to multiple buffers and clip all 3D operations.
I consider that a bad thing. Making the full screen rendering more distant
from windowed rendering is also a bad thing.
Every implementation of page ﬂipping brings in a class of bugs, and ob-
fuscates several code paths. It’s not worth it.

Re:Vector quantization compression?
You have confused two different forms of compression.
S3TC is a modiﬁed form of block truncation coding (BTC), which involves
selecting two colors and generating two other colors by interpolation.
This is done with 4x4 blocks, giving very nearly 4 bits per pixel. This is
nice because it doesn’t require any additional tables.
Vector quantization is a general process where you try to take a large
set of number strings and pick some subset that can be used to aprox-
imate all of them reasonably. In the dreamcast’s case, you specify 256
2x2 blocks, so each pixel is represented by 2 bits, but you also have 2k
of codebook overhead. This works out pretty well for smaller textures,
but large textures often come out badly because there just aren’t enough
codebook entries to reasonably aproximate it.

Re:Portals ?
PVS was The Right Thing when level geometry counts were much lower.
With tens of thousands of polygons in a scene, creating a cluster tree di-
rectly from that becomes completely unrealistic from a space and time
perspective.
The options are to either do PVS with a simpliﬁed version of the world,
or ignore the geometry and just work with portal topology.
Unreal used a scan-line visibility algorithm, which crippled it’s ability to
have high poly counts or high framerates with hardware accelerators.
Tim Sweeny knows full well that the architecture is very wrong for mod-
ern systems, but many of the original decisions were based on earlier
software technologies. Unreal was supposed to be a ”killer app” for the
Pentium-200 MMX processor.
I have a lot of respect for Tim and Unreal, but the visibility algorithm in

Actually, even the original Verite V1000 could do 32 bit color rendering.

Rendition did a lot of things right, even on their very ﬁrst card. They had
all the blend modes and texture environments from the very beginning.
The only thing they didn’t have was per-pixel mip-mapping.
If they had delivered the V2xx series on time, they could have had a strong

Re:3Dfx vs nVidia vs The World
Reguardless, I won’t buy either. Why? Because they both claim OpenGL
support. Now, I don’t know about you folks, but seeing as I work in Au-

ATI doesn’t. #9 didn’t. Why? Most of them view software as the future.
All of the modern cards have full rasterization support for OpenGL, but I
guess you are refering to geometry acceleration.
The situation has changed since you last looked at it.
The Nvidia GeForce cards have an extremely capable geometry acceler-
ator, and they have the ability to fetch display lists either over AGP with
a large bandwidth savings due to vertex reuse, or store the display lists
completely in local memory to remove all vertex trafﬁc from the bus.
The issue with professional OpenGL support has mostly been the focus
of the driver writers, not the hardware. I think that Nvidia’s partnering
with ELSA to work on professional app certiﬁcation with the Nvidia hard-
ware was an extremely good move.

There are a few edges that the expensive professional boards still have
over the nvidia consumer cards, but not many:
You can get more total memory, like a 32mb framebuffer and 64mb tex-
ture memory conﬁguration. We will probably see workstation graphics
systems with up to a gig of memory within a year. Consumer cards will
offer 128mb next year, but the workstation cards can easily maintain an
advantage there.
This has a cost, though: large, expandable memory subsystems can’t be
clocked as high as the single-option, short trace layouts that nvidia does.
Even dual pipe workstation boards can’t match the memory bandwidth
of a GeForce2.
You generally get better high end DACs and shielding on workstation
boards. The upper end of the consumer boards will do the high num-
bers, but it just isn’t as clean of a signal.
Dual monitor has been supported much better on the workstation boards.
This is starting to become a feature on consumer boards, which is wel-
come.
The consumer cards are still skimping on itterator precision bits. Un-
der demanding conditions, like very large magnitude texcoord values
stretched a small increment across a large number of pixels, you can see
many consumer cards start getting fuzzy texel edges while the worksta-
tion cards still look rock solid.
Probably the most noticable case is in edge rasterization, where some
workstation cards are so good that you don’t usually notice T-Junction
cracks in your data, while the consumer cards have them stand out all
over the place.
Next years consumer cards should ﬁx that.
When the consumer cards ﬁrst started posting ﬁll rate numbers higher
than the professional boards, it was mostly a lie. They got impressive
numbers at 640x480 in 16 bit color, without blending, depth buffering,
and ﬁltering, but if you turned on 32 bit, depth, blend, trilinear, and ran
at high res, they could fall to 1/4 or less of the quoted value.

Today, there isn’t a single combination of rendering attributes that will let
a wildcat out-rasterize a GeForce2.
Wildcat was supposed to offer huge 8 and 16 way scalability that would
offset that, but it doesn’t look like it is coming any time soon.
The workstation vendors do stupid driver tricks to make CDRS go faster,
while consumer vendors do stupid driver tricks to make Q3 go faster.
We bought three generations of intergraph/intense3D products, but the
last generation (initial wildcat) was a mistake. We use nvidia boards for
both professional work and gaming now. I still think the professional
boards are a bit more stable, but they fell behind in other features, es-

It’s harder than it sounds
I have been meaning to write an article about my involvement with, and

coverage started getting me interested in the ﬁeld last year, and I wound
up putting $34k into funding two of the CATS prize entries (JPA and SO-
RAC). If one of them had won, they would have returned the funding
money, but it was basically done as philanthropy.
From the outside, or with cursory knowledge, it seems so damn simple,
and all the problems sound like they could have been prevented with a
little thought. It’s harder than it sounds. Feel free to help.
A lot of efforts came together in the last couple months, and none of them
have been successful. After the fact, it’s easy to toss off what should have
been done.
Ky Michaelson’s space shot got off better than most. It launched well, and
went through it’s full burn before losing a ﬁn at mach 4+. If it had held
together, it might have made it into space. Hindsight says he should have

should have hydrotested the casing.

ment by itself), and the electronics all seemed to work, but the launch
failed due to interference with the launch rail. Hindsight says they should
have done a test launch from the ground with the launcher hung from
scaffolding.
The SORAC team ran into some political and personal issues with the
Bureau of Land Management, resulting in them being banned from black
rock for a while, scrubbing their planned CATS launch. Being honest, it
would have been a rush job if they had launched in the scheduled slot,

but they still would have had a chance. Hindsight says they should have

JP Aerospace got fucked by the FAA. They have had licenses to try for
100km a couple times in the past, and they always turn everything in
more than six months in advance and check up on the process constantly.
Four days before they were heading to black rock, the FAA informed them
that there were problems with their application. Hindsight doesn’t say
anything. There was still a pretty good chance JPA would have had prob-
lems with their new launch structure because they missed their last AWAY
test run schedule, but they probably had the best shot.
Interorbital has a sea launch slot next week, but pushing for the last week
of the prize sounds like things probably aren’t quite ready to go.
The SORAC and JPA CATS rockets will still be launched when the proper
permits are all in line again (the government agencies have turned around),
so there is a decent chance that there will be an amateur rocket getting
into space come spring, but unfortunately there won’t be a payoff for
them now that the prize is expiring.

Our options from here are to move towards a hybrid CD and pay Loki for

initial version of D3D.
There is an intuitive notion that curved surfaces are ”better” than trian-
gles, because it takes lots of triangles to aproximate a curved surface.
In their most general form, they can be degenerated to perform the same
functions as triangles, just at a huge waste in speciﬁcation trafﬁc.
Unfortunately, there have been a long string of products that miss the
”most general form” part, and implement some form of patch surface
that requires textures to be aligned with the patch isoparms. This seems
to stem from a background in 2D graphics, where the natural progression
from sliding sprites around goes to scaling them, then rotating them,
then projecting them, then curving them.
3DO did it. Saturn did it. NV1 did it. Some people are probably working
on displacement mapping schemes right now that are making the same
mistake.
Without the ability to separate the texturing from the geometry, you can’t
clip any geometry in a general way (not even mentioning the fact that
clipping a curve along anything but an isoparm will raise it’s order), and
you either live with texel density varying wildly and degenerating to points,
or you have texture seams between every change in density. No ability to
rotate a texture on a surface, project a texture across multiple surfaces,
etc. You can’t replace the generality if a triangle with primitives like that.
Even aside from the theoretical issues, NV1 didn’t have any form of hid-
den surface removal, and the curve subdivision didn’t stitch, frustum clip
or do perspective. It was a gimmick, not a tool.
All water under the bridge now, of course. NV20 rocks. :-)

Re:Quadratic surfaces
My point was that with texturing tied directly to the patch orientation,
you can’t do exactly the thing that you describe.

Re:The clipper was a joke!
Coming back as a glider implies wings and landing gear, which wind up
massing more than vertical landing propellant.
Trying to do without wings on X-33 forced a sub-optimal tankage solu-
tion, which turned out to not work.
A VTVL isn’t expected to ”ﬂy” to a landing. It plummets at terminal ve-
locity (not as fast as you might expect, because it is mostly empty), only
ﬁring the engines a reletive few seconds before landing. The fuel required
is then only a few seconds of several G thrust for the EMPTY mass of the
vehicle.
A somewhat more valid argument against vertical landing is that doing
it efﬁciently requires computer control, and it is unlikely that a human

Re:VTOL problems
The throttle is manual, but attitude control is computer managed. The
joystick input gives a target angle, and the computer deals with rates and
pulses to try and get it there. Manual control of a differentially throttled
vehicle is extremely difﬁcult (the simulator allows you to try).
CG/CP is irrelevent for this vehicle, because it isn’t designed to go fast
enough that aerodynamics are a factor.
Four ﬁxed position engines can give full 3 axis control if you are tricky
about it. Opposite pairs of engines are canted a few degrees so that one
pair of engines gives a slight positive roll, and the other pair of engines
gives a slight negative roll. This does mean that there is a cross couple for
every pitch or yaw adjustment, but with an order of magnitude difference
between them, it is easy to correct out.

I consider myself fortunate that I am consciously aware of the process. I

there is an interesting synthesis, the transformation can usually be posed
as an analogy to some previous work.

the principle demonstrated by this over there added to allow it to give

He is sort of correct.
It is easier to get a high thrust to weight ratio out of solids, even though
they have a lower Isp and generally a lower total dV per stage.
To get more thrust out of a solid, you basically just need a bigger nozzle,
while to get more out of a conventional liquid engine, you need a bigger
nozzle, and bigger turbopumps, plumbing, and combustion chamber.
Not that I think solids on a manned vehicle are very sensible...

their $400k and four years.

Run the numbers.
With a 400 Isp engine, one percent of the vehicle landing mass can kill
40m/s of velocity. That is over 80 mph, which an efﬁcient VTVL vehicle
could expect to have as its terminal velocity.
A parachute masses more than 1% of its load.
There are lots of other factors that can push the decision either way, but
it is certainly within the realm of feasible engineering decision.

Performance beneﬁts
The standard lighting model in DOOM, with all features enabled, but no
custom shaders, takes ﬁve passes on a GF1/2 or Radeon, either two or
three passes on a GF3, and should be possible in a clear + single pass on
ATI’s new part.
It is still unclear how the total performance picture will look.
Lots of pixels are still rendered with no textures at all (stencil shadows),
or only a single texture (blended effects), so the pass advantage will only
show up on some subset of all the drawing.
If ATI doesn’t do as good of a job with the memory interface, or doesn’t
get the clock rate up as high as NVidia, they will still lose.

The pixel operations are a step more ﬂexible than Nvidia’s current op-

terms of generality.
Developers are just going to need to sweat out the diversity or go for a
least common denominator for the next couple years.
I fully expect the next generation engine after the current DOOM engine
will be targeted at the properly general purpose graphics processors that
I have been pushing towards over the last several years.
Hardware vendors are sort of reticent to give up being able to ”out fea-

Re:Question for Carmack
Taking things one step at a time is critical for success.
We have a pretty clear plan of attack to take us to X-Prize level vehicles.
There will be several intermediate vehicles to learn from along the way,
but I am pretty conﬁdent that we can do it, and that I can pay for it. The
regulatory approval is still uncertain. Things get much more question-
able after that.
The next step would be using the X-Prize vehicle as a booster for a upper
stage(s) that launch a microsat into orbit. That requires many times for
dV, and the regulatory environment, telemetry, and logistics become a
lot more challenging. This would get fairly expensive, because making a
reusable upper stage(s) is a whole new level of problem, and you just can’t
test a lot of the systems without going all the way. Even on a shoestring, it
could easily get to $100k for each attempt, after you factor everything in.
Realistically, it will take a lot of attempts to learn everything you need to
know. A lot of people will talk about how straightforward it is, but I have

a healthy respect for the challenges. Smart money probably wouldn’t bet
on any ”garage shop” getting to orbit, but it certainly isn’t impossible.
After that, you could either work towards reusable upper stages, or scale
everything up to the point you could try to orbit a passenger or a semi-
useful LEO satellite.
Sure, if all that works out, I would love to make a moon shot, but that
qualiﬁes as day-dreaming, not planning. The idea that Dennis Wingo
has ﬂoated recently about M class asteroids rich in platinum group met-
als possibly being able to have survived impact on the moon without va-
porizing under some conditions is Very Very Interesting.
The extent of my ”business planning” for the rockets is along the lines
of ”If you actually make something really, really cool, you will wind up
making money on it somehow”. Hopelessly naive? Possibly. We’ll see. I
hate being involved in business, so we would probably just partner with
some of the existing companies interested in suborbital rides or sound-
ing rocket business.
In the short term, watch for us getting a man off the ground in the up-
scaled lander frame within a couple months.
On topic: I think pretty highly of the DaVinci project, and I would say
they are deﬁnitely one of the leading contenders. Brian Feeney talks
about some technical issues on open mailing lists, which is a good sign.
My biggest concern for them would be that, from my experience with
JP Aerospace, getting two successful rockoon launches off within the 14
days required by the X-Prize is going to involve a good sized helping of
luck.

Aug 2001
1.53.1
The present and the future
I’m still developing everything with OpenGL, and I’m still targeting mac
and linux as well as windows, but I want to rationally address some points
in the API debate:
D3D is clunky, etc
Not really true anymore. MS made large strides with each release, and
DX8 can’t be called a lousy API anymore. One can argue various points,
but they are minor points. Anti-Microsoft forces have a bad habit of fo-
cusing on early problems, and not tracking the improvements that have
been made in current versions. My rant of ﬁve years ago doesn’t apply to
the world of today.
I do think that the world would be a slightly better place if Microsoft
had pulled an embrace-and-extend on OpenGL instead of developing a
brand new API that had to be rewritten a half dozen times, but its water
under the bridge now.
Open for more sales, etc
It has been pretty clearly demonstrated that the mac market is barely vi-
able and the linux market is not viable for game developers to pursue.
Linux ports will be done out of good will, not proﬁt motives. From an
economic standpoint, a developer is not making a bad call if they ignore
the existence of all platforms but windows.
DX8 Gives more features
Some people have an odd view that an API gives you features. Assuming
you don’t care about software emulation, hardware gives you features,

and an API exposes them. If you try to use vertex programs or bump
env map on a TNT, DX8 doesn’t magically make it work. DX8’s hardware
independence is also looking a bit silly now as they make point releases
to support ATI’s new hardware. They might as well say D3D-GF3 or D3D-
R200 instead of DX8 and DX8.1.
All of Nvidia’s new features have showed up as OpenGL extensions before
they show up as new D3D features.
Divergent extensions haven’t been a problem up until very recently. All
of the vendors tended to support all the extensions they could, and if
they had unique functionality, like register combiners, they made their
own extension. The current status of vertex programs does piss me off,
though. I really wish ATI would have just adopted Nvidia’s extension,
even if it meant not exposing every last bit of their hardware.
Abstraction in a high performance environment can be dangerous. If you
insist that all hardware behave the same, you prevent vendors from mak-
ing signiﬁcant improvements. If the spec for behavior comes from peo-
ple that aren’t hardware oriented, it can be a huge burden. D3D still suf-
fers somewhat due to this, with some semantics and odd features that
make hardware guys wince.
The Good News
We are rapidly approaching a real golden age for graphics programming.
Currently, cards and API’s are a complex mess of hundreds of states and
function calls, but the next two years will see the addition of the ﬁnal
primitive functionality needed to allow arbitrarily complex operations
with graceful performance degradation.
At that point, a higher level graphics API will ﬁnally make good sense.
There is debate over exactly what it is going to look like, but the model
will be like C. Just like any CPU can compile any C program (with vari-
ous levels of efﬁciency), any graphics card past this point will be able to
run any shader. Some hardware vendors are a bit concerned about this,
because bullet point features that you have that the other guy doesn’t are
a major marketing feature, but the direction is a technical inevitability.
They will just have to compete on price and performance. Oh, darn.

It’s a Turing machine point. Even if OpenGL 2.0 and DX10 don’t adopt the

Deus Ex made money. Daikatana lost an immense amount of money. We
followed the PC-Data sales numbers for a little while, and it was really,
really grim. It might have made a comback when it went to the bargain
bin, but even if it had turned into the best selling game of the year, it
wouldn’t have covered the sunk costs at Ion.
My view:
Ion storm failued due to lack of focus, which came from the top. They
had some great employees (we hired some of them!), but games don’t
get done without someone in a position of authority forcing everything
together. Romero’s primary mistake was believing that abstract creative
design was a primary, or even signiﬁcant, part of a successful game. The
”strategic creativity” in a game is less than 1% of the effort, and if you put
that on a pedestal, you will deephasise where all the real work needs to
be done.
I think Romero has a chance at a comeback with his current foray into
handheld games. I don’t think he ever lost the enthusiasm for games, but
if he can recapture the personal work ethic that he had early on, he can
probably still do some pretty cool things.

a company around.
The real value in design is the give and take during implementation and
testing. It isn’t the couple dozen decisions made at the start, it is the thou-
sands of little decisions made as the product is being brought to life, and
constantly modiﬁed as things evolve around it. If you took two game de-
signs, one good and one bad, and gave them to two development teams,
one good and one bad, the good dev team could make a good, fun prod-
uct out of a bad design, but the bad dev team could ruin the most clever
design. The focus should be on the development process, not the (initial)
design.
The games with 500 page design documents before any implementation
are also kidding themselves, because you can’t make all the detail deci-
sions without actually experiencing a lot of the interactions.
Putting creativity on a pedestal can also be an excuse for laziness. There
is a lot of cultural belief that creativity comes from inspiration, and can’t
be rushed. Not true. Inspiration is just your subconscious putting things
together, and that can be made into an active process with a little intro-
spection.
Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal,

A few corrections
A few corrections to the article:
”My own graphics technology”
is OpenGL.
”Mr. Carmack also plays computer games in the ofﬁce with his coworkers”
I played Q3 quite a bit, but not much since then. The team focus of Tea-
mArena and Wolfenstein just isn’t my favorite type of game.
”Polygon counts”
The Doom engine is not an ultra-high poly count engine, because it is
built around dynamic lighting and shadowing, but it is still a large step
up from our previous games. Typical scenes will have around 150,000
polygons, versus 10,000 for Q3. There will certainly be other games with
higher raw polygon counts, but that is really focusing on the trees, not the
forest (image quality). The large numbers that have occasionally been
tossed around are the polygon counts for the high detail characters that
are used in the generation of normal maps for the real time rendering.
Some characters are over 500,000 polygons in their original form.
”It looks like the type of game that is so thrilling to play that gamers will
do so over and over again, even though it lacks a narrative plot.”
Unlike everything we have done before, the new Doom actually DOES
have a real plot, and I think it is going to be presented well. I don’t really
expect most people to believe us at this point, but wait and see...
”The new Doom likely will require a no less powerful chip than the soon-
to-be-released Nvidia GeForce3”
It is designed for full impact on a GeForce-3, but it still runs on a GeForce-
1 or Radeon.

Re:It won’t be cheap
I am going to have to save the parent post, because it is such a perfect ex-

I couldn’t have said it better if I was trying to intentionally construct the
stereotype. This ties directly in to the quote I had in the article – ”rocket
science” has been mythologized out of all proportion to its true difﬁculty.
First, you are severely understating the achievements of the Wright broth-
ers. They had to invent almost everything from scratch, including much
of the theory, and there was no existence proof to show that it was pos-
sible at all. I’m really not an aviation buff, so I’m sure someone else can
recount the challenges better, but it is worth noting that at the time the
Wrights did their work, there was also a high proﬁle, government funded
effort underway headed by Samuel Langley. With the ”best minds in the
country” and government resources behind it, they still didn’t make the
breakthroughs.

I contend that building and ﬂying an X-Prize class vehicle (100 km subor-
bital, three passengers, reusable) today is a much less daunting task than
the original invention of the airplane.
We have existence proofs of what is being attempted. There is no ques-
tion that it is possible, because it has been demonstrated in many differ-
ent forms. The only question is how cheap it can be done.
There is a massive amount of information available. Today, anyone can
go read up on things that NOBODY knew back when they were building
the early rocket systems.
Obviously, computers and electronics are vastly better. Our current elec-
tronics box has all the necessary sensors and actuators for ﬂying a space-
ship, and it cost less than $15,000 to put together (yes, it runs linux).
It isn’t as blatant, but other manufacturing areas have also made great
progress. I had a batch of a dozen small motors made at a CNC job shop
for only $1000. Even counting everything that goes into them, the total
cost including valve is less than $300 each. These may well be better than
the peroxide thrusters used on the Mercury capsules. It was amusing to
hear the NASA pad manager tell stories about having to go bang on the
Mercury thrusters with a wrench to get them to stop sputtering. Don’t
think that all NASA hardware performs as designed.
Pressure vessels are signiﬁcantly improved. A common all-carbon-ﬁber
tank for natural gas vehicles has a better compressed volume to mass
ratio than anything that could be built in the sixties. Filament winding
can make large structures that are both stronger and cheaper than the
classic welded structures.
There are direct spinoffs from government rocketry development. To
drill the tiny, high aspect cooling passages for the Agena upper stage en-
gine, they had to invent brand new machining technologies. Today, you
can get the same techniques done at standard industrial job shops. As far
as expensive materials go, the Agena engine was made out of aluminum.
The general industrial infrastructure is also a heck of a lot better. I can
order damn near anything I need for our work from McMaster-Carr at
4:00 in the morning, and it shows up two days later.

NASA spent $50 million to set up the tracking and telemetry networks for
Mercury. You can get far, far better results today with a GPS and satellite
modem. There are billions of dollars of space based assets already at our
disposal.
I could go on for quite a while on why we would have an easier time today
just replicating the efforts of the past, but that is only part of the issue.
What we are aiming for in the near term is far smaller in scope than any
of the projects that the public normally associates with space. Even with
all the advantages of today, it would be absurd to think that we could put
together a space shuttle or a Saturn V. I hesitate to make analogies, but
we are effectively working on building little microprocessors instead of
big mainframes. 100 km straight up and down (that gives a 5G reentry,
which, while not for your grandmother, doesn’t take a superhero) is just
not all that hard.
Yes, there are lots of challenges to be met, and we will doubtless run into
all sorts of things that we haven’t even considered. We will solve them as
we go. People do hard things all the time, in many different ﬁelds. The
reason ”rocket science” looks so much harder is just lack of familiarity.
Because the existing way of doing things in space costs tens to hundreds
of millions of dollars a shot, there just isn’t an opportunity for radical ex-
perimentation. The optimization problem is slowly trending towards a
stable local minimum, with little chance of getting out to the global min-
imum. Imagine trying to develop software if you only got to compile and
run your app four times a year. Imagine how much that would slow down
progress, and what contortions you would go through if $100 million was
riding on each run.
Build fast. Test often. Stay ﬂexible. Mind the critical path.

We are currently using a Crossbow inertial unit with ﬁber optic gyros for
the fast attitude stabilization.
We have ﬂown GPS on a couple ﬂights, but the update rate is too slow
for active control. I do feel that in the longer term, carrier wave inter-
ferometry GPS sensors will offer the most cost effective attitude sensors,
but right now they are $15,000+ system. If I was doing this on a much
tighter budget, I would consider trying to build a fast updating CW GPS
system from available cheap GPS cores, but that is a project of signiﬁcant
complexity all by itself.

The estimate from day one was:
Year one: VTVL demonstratorYear two: manned rocket shipsYear three:
space shots
The VTVL demonstrator went faster than expected, and it looked like we
were going to lift a person off the ground before the end of the ﬁrst year.
We had a couple crashes and redesigns that set us back a bit, and we
were forced to make a major change in our catalyst packs to allow us to
get enough back-to-back ﬂights without changes before putting a person
on it, so we haven’t yet made that ”milestone bunny hop”.
However, while we were waiting for some things along that development
path, we wound up developing some other technologies that weren’t even
in the original plan – our recent work on biprop engines wasn’t really
scheduled until year three or later, and the rocket rotor work is looking
like it will allow some big improvements in our upcoming designs.
The current goal of record is to set some of the manned aviation 3000
meter time-to-climb records before the end of this year.

Other people have outlined the issues in detail in comments already, but
the crux is that, even with driver quality removed from the discussion

GF4 hardware is still faster than 8500 hardware on basically everything I
tested. The 8500 SHOULD have been faster on paper, but isn’t in real life.

Take with a grain of salt any comment from me that has been paraphrased,
but if it is an actual in-context quote from email, I try very hard to be pre-
cise in my statements. Read carefully.
1.61.2
High end hardware reasoning
We know for sure that we will be excluding some of the game buying pub-
lic with fairly stiff hardware requirements, but we still think it is the right
thing to do.
The requirement for GF1/Radeon 7500 as an absolute minimum is fun-
damental to the way the technology works, and was non-negotiable for
the advances that I wanted to make. At the very beginning of develop-
ment, I worked a bit on elaborate schemes to try and get some level of
compatibility with Voodoo / TNT / Rage128 class hardware, but it would
have looked like crap, and I decided it wasn’t worth it.
The comfortable minimum performance level on this class of hardware is
determined by what the artists and level designers produce. It would be
possible to carefully craft a DOOM engine game that ran at good speed
on an original SDR GF1, but it would cramp the artistic freedom of the
designers a lot as they worried more about performance than aesthetics
and gameplay.
Our ”full impact” platform from the beginning has been targeted at GF3/Xbox
level hardware. Slower hardware can disable features, and faster hard-
ware gets higher frame rates and rendering quality. Even at this target,
designers need to be more cognizant of performance than they were with
Q3, and we expect some licensee to take an even more aggressive perfor-
mance stance for games shipping in following years.
Games using the new engine will be on shelves FIVEYEARS (or more) af-
ter the initial design decisions were made. We had a couple licensees
make two generations of products with the Q3 engine, and we expect that
to hold true for DOOM as well. The hardware-only decision for Q3 was
controversial at the time, but I feel it clearly turned out to be correct. I

am conﬁdent the target for DOOM will also be seen as correct once there
is a little perspective on it.
Unrelated linux note: yes, there will almost certainly be a linux binary for

Realtime and ofﬂine rendering ARE converging
There are some colorful comments here about how studios will never-
ever-ever replace tools like renderman on render farms with hardware
accelerated rendering. These comments are wrong.
The current generation of cards do not have the necessary ﬂexibility, but
cards released before the end of the year will be able to do ﬂoating point
calculations, which is the last gating factor. Peercy’s (IMHO seminal) pa-
per showed that given dependent texture reads and ﬂoating point pixels,
you can implement renderman shaders on real time rendering hardware
by decomposing it into lots of passes. It may take hundreds of rendering
passes in some cases, meaning that it won’t be real time, but it can be
done, and will be vastly faster than doing it all in software. It doesn’t get
you absolutely every last picky detail, but most users will take a couple
orders of magnitude improvement in price performance and cycle time
over getting to specify, say, the exact ﬁlter kernel jitter points.
There will always be some market for the ﬁnest possible rendering, using
ray tracing, global illumination, etc in a software renderer. This is analo-
gous to the remaining market for vector supercomputers. For some ap-
plications, it is still the right thing if you can afford it. The bulk of the
frames will migrate to the cheaper platforms.
Note that this doesn’t mean that technical directors at the ﬁlm studios

will have to learn a new language – there will be translators that will go
from existing langauges. Instead of sending their RIB code to the ren-
derfarm, you will send it to a program that decomposes it for hardware
acceleration. They will return image ﬁles just like everyone is used to.
Multi chip and multi card solutions are also coming, meaning that you
will be able to ﬁt more frame rendering power in a single tower case than
Pixar’s entire rendering farm. Next year.
I had originally estimated that it would take a few years for the tools to
mature to the point that they would actually be used in production work,
but some companies have done some very smart things, and I expect that
production frames will be rendered on PC graphics cards before the end
of next year. It will be for TV ﬁrst, but it will show up in ﬁlm eventually.

Re:Exotic Fuels
AFAIK (we met at Space Access this year), Brian is not interested in ad-
vanced engine work. For his goals, simple monoprop peroxide is far and
away the most direct route.
For reference, while the theoretical Isp is usually listed around 155, we
typically only see 115 or so at sea level with less than 300 psi chamber
pressure.
hybrid (ie, plastic/nitrous oxide) propellants?
Peroxide makes a pretty good hybrid oxidizer, with better Isp and density-
Isp than nitrous based hybrids, plus it auto-ignites after decomposition.
Vec Isp may be as high as 275 with 90% peroxide, but sea level will be
down around 200-225, depending on chamber pressures. We ﬁred a cou-
ple peroxide / polyethylene hybrid grains last year, but we haven’t pur-
sued it much.

There is a very tantalizing possibility of using aluminum hydride as a hy-
brid graid with peroxide, giving a theoretical vacuum Isp of over 400 (!!!),
and it is non-toxic. We are probably going to look into this one of these
days.
buckyballs
Not much use. Buckytube composites may make for very mass efﬁcient
tanks and structures in the not too distant future.
multi-atomic nitrogen
If it can ever be produced affordably, a 600 Isp monoprop would sure be
nice. Easy to go boom, though.
ﬂuorine
Ick. Very toxic, very corrosive. Flourine / lithium hybrids can get over 500
Isp, but it would be very dangerous.
I feel that the best way to take advantage of exotic developments is to
build a fully functional vehicle with conventional materials, so if a won-

advantage of it.

disk. Our original parting deal was that we were going to continue doing
the Gamer’s Edge games for a while, basically for free, as penance. We
weren’t savvy enough to get anything binding down on paper, so even
when it was all wrapped up, there was room for twisting our arm a bit.
(another trivia bit – George Broussard at Apogee arranged to have Apogee
produce one of the Gamer’s Edge titles for us, so we could focus more on
Wolfenstein).
We ﬁnally arranged a technology transfer of the latest engine code for
free and clear severing of our ties. After they showed that just having the

back and ask for more, but by then we were able to just tell them to go

Originality, creativity, etc
I was fairly pleased with how that article turned out - when I ﬁrst heard
about it, I dreaded seeing a trivialized simpliﬁcation of the issues, but it
turned out as representative as you can be in that space.
However, I really dislike discussions of the attribution of techniques to a
particular programmer. Everything is derived from things before it, and
I make no claims of originality. I would say that one of my talents is the
ability to be aware of what sources are feeding into my work, and be able
to backtrack to them. Also, there are always lots of other possible answers
for any given problem that can be made to work. BSP vs sector list, Por-
tals vs PVS vs scan line occlusion, tilted constant Z rasterization vs block
subdivision vs background divides, etc. Looked at in the proper perspec-
tive, individual techniques just aren’t all that important. Sometimes it
sounds like ”Dude, he INVENTED needle nose pliers!!!”
Heck, I somewhat deride the very concept of originality. Creativity is just
synthesis without the introspection. Lots of people will catch on that
and start a rant about how Id games aren’t original, but they are missing
the point - it is possible to set out and develop something that will be

The best way to get answers is to just keep working the problem, recog-

Doom that Nvidia has on their website was a pretty good example of my
process. Don’t just wait for The Right Thing to strike you - try everything

Re:Rendering - two generations from done?
My comment speciﬁcally regards the ”shelf life” of a rendering engine. I
think that an upcoming game engine, either the next one or the one after
that, will have a notably longer usable life for content creation than we
have seen so far. Instead of having to learn new paradigms for content
creation every couple years, designers will be able to continue working
with common tools that evolve in a compatible way. Renderman is the
obvious example – lots of things have improved and evolved, but its fun-
damental deﬁnition is clearly the same that it was over a decade ago.
This is only loosly related to the realism of the graphics. I don’t think a de-
tailed world simulation that is indistinquishable from reality will be here
in the next decade, except for tightly controlled environments. You will
be able to have real-time ﬂythroughs that can qualify as indistinguish-
able, but given the ability to ”test reality” interactively, we have a lot far-
ther to go with simulation than with rendering.

Re:”Non-high-end-comp-owning geeks rejoice!”?
The X-Box GPU is more of a GF4 than a GF3, but a modern PC is generally
much higher end than an X-Box.
However, you can usually count on getting twice the performance out of
an absolutely ﬁxed platform if you put a little work into it. There are lots
of tradeoffs that need to balance between the different cards on a general
purpose platform – things that I don’t do with vertex programs because
it would make the older cards even slower, avoiding special casing that
would be too difﬁcult to test across all platforms (and driver revs), and
double buffering of vertex data to abstract across VAR and vertex objects,
for instance. We might cut the ”core tick” of Doom from 60hz to 30hz
on X-Box if we need the extra performance, because it has no chance of
holding 60hz, but the PC version will eventually scale to that with the
faster CPUs and graphics cards.
1.65.3
Re:different backends useless then?
The generic back end does not use vertex programs, or provide specu-
lar highlights, so the custom back ends provide both performance and
quality improvements.
There are some borderline cases that may or may not get custom cod-
ing – Radeon R100, Matrox Parhelia, and SiS Xabre are all currently using
the default path, but could beneﬁt from additional custom coding. I will
only consider that when they have absolutely rock solid quality on the
default path, and if it looks like they have enough performance head-
room to bother with the specular passes.
The NV20 back end has more work in it than any other, with two differ-
ent cases for the lighting interaction, but on the X-Box I would proba-
bly create additional special cases to optimize some of the other possible
permutations.

The RATIO of bandwidth to calculation speed is going to decrease. It is

the clock on external lines.
Bandwidth will continue to increase, but calculation will likely get faster

about the slashdot story). However, if anyone here does happen to have
a brother-in-law that is a VP at FMC or some such, a little nudge wouldn’t
hurt.
The full story:
Rocket grade peroxide is stabilizer free, and 85% - 100% concentrated, as
opposed to drug store peroxide at about 3% concentration. You can get
up to 70% peroxide reasonably easily, but the high concentration stuff is
a specialty item.
When we started our development work a bit over two years ago, we were
doing some concentration of the peroxide ourselves, which is ﬁne for
making small test batches, but you really don’t want to be making drums
of the stuff, or you wind up spending as much time messing with that as
you do building rockets.
We had some initial discussions with FMC about that time, but they weren’t
terribly encouraging. Shortly thereafter, we made contact with X-L Space
Systems, a small company that was producing 98% concentration perox-
ide and selling it reasonably to several small outﬁts, as well as NASA and
the USAF. I wound up buying a dozen or so drums from X-L, and every-
thing was going well.
The owner of X-L was having such a hard time getting the government to
pay their bills on time (he never had complaints about his small commer-
cial customers) that he ﬁnally decided it just wasn’t worth the headache,
and he closed the company down. I was in discussion with him to make
a large enough order to justify keeping production open, but we wouldn’t
need all that much peroxide for nearly eight months, so the storage logis-
tics were looking troublesome. In hindsight, I should have worked some-
thing out, even if it was expensive or difﬁcult.
About six months ago, we started contacting FMC again. The details
haven’t been very pleasant, largely because we keep thinking we are al-
most there, and it keeps not being the case. If they would just tell me
exactly what I have to buy to make them happy, I would gladly do it, but
they keep ﬁnding new things. That is the ”stringing us along” part. They
are mumbling again about lawyers and liability at the moment, which we
thought had been worked through previously.

We have also spoken to Degussa about production, but they won’t sell
in drums, only large storage tanks (they supposedly have some drums in
the US, but they are ”promised to” NASA, and they won’t sell them to us).
We could live with that, but we broke off contact with them a while ago
because FMC was sounding reasonable, but insisting that they be our
sole supplier.
This is one of the unfortunate tradeoffs in modern society – in the 70’s,
FMC would just ship drums of peroxide to the guys doing rocket powered
dragsters without any hassles (one of them sent me a scan of some of his
old shipping invoices). Today, fears of liability are larger than basic busi-
ness drives like making money with your product. I’m not a ”back in the

Re:Carmack is fragbait.
There is an interesting annecdote related to this.
At the world space congress last year, I was talking to Buzz Aldrin’s son,
who is head of acquisitions at Boeing. He really didn’t believe that cheap,
reusable launchers were possible (he thinks ”billions of dollars in devel-
opment”), but he said that if we win the X-Prize, demonstrating cheaper
launch for even suborbital lobs, Boeing would ”just buy us”.
From our short discussion, it was clear that we have quite different world
views, so I hesitate to read much into his statements one way or the other,
but it was a bit curious.

Re:Burt Rutan vs. John Carmack?
We have obviously been eagerly waiting for this unveiling. Nobody has
denied that Rutan is the odds-on favorite for the X-Prize, but I take a
positive thing away from this unveiling – I have always contended that
being an ”airplane guy” is going to hurt Rutan in the X-Prize, and this is
deﬁnitely a ”winged thing”. I would have been more concerned if it was
just a purely ballistic capsule being air launched. I have little doubt that
they will fairly rapidly have successful zoom climbs to somewhat above
100,000’, but it is far from the simplest design to go to 350,000’. It is cer-
tainly true that complex designs can be made to work with enough tal-
ent, experience, testing, and money, which Rutan has all of, but there is
plenty of room for things to screw up.
I don’t expect that they will make any ﬂights to 100km this year, but I can
certainly be proven wrong...
I am quite happy with our current design, and we are committed to fol-
lowing through irrespective of what Rutan does. Even if he makes it, we
have a different ecological niche in terms of vehicle capabilities – our en-
tire launch infrastructure can be towed by a light truck, and launched
from anywhere. If he does win the X-Prize before us, we will ditch the
monopropellant propulsion system and move to something more cost
effective (at the expense of more development time) for the long term.
We may be forced to do that anyway, if our peroxide situation doesn’t re-
solve itself.

To leap 50’ in the air, you must be going 56.6 ft/s when leaving the ground,
disregarding air resistance. Apogee will be in 1.77 seconds.
Assuming a linear acceleration, and a four foot period of acceleration
from crouching to leaving the ground with legs extended, the average
speed must be 28.3 ft/s over the four feet, for 0.14 seconds of accelera-
tion, or 404 ft/sˆ2. 12.6 G’s of acceleration isn’t at all unreasonable for
arm / leg contraction at light loads. You can make a > 50G acceleration
with a pitching motion of your arm.
12.6 G’s of acceleration for an 800 pound hulk is only 10080 pounds, di-
vided by two 24” long by 8” wide feet give a mere 26.25 psi force on the

but not deeply evil.
The signiﬁcant issue that clouds current ATI / Nvidia comparisons is frag-
ment shader precision. Nvidia can work at 12 bit integer, 16 bit ﬂoat, and
32 bit ﬂoat. ATI works only at 24 bit ﬂoat. There isn’t actually a mode
where they can be exactly compared. DX9 and ARB fragment program
assume 32 bit ﬂoat operation, and ATI just converts everything to 24 bit.
For just about any given set of operations, the Nvidia card operating at
16 bit ﬂoat will be faster than the ATI, while the Nvidia operating at 32
bit ﬂoat will be slower. When DOOM runs the NV30 speciﬁc fragment
shader, it is faster than the ATI, while if they both run the ARB2 shader,
the ATI is faster.
When the output goes to a normal 32 bit framebuffer, as all current tests
do, it is possible for Nvidia to analyze data ﬂow from textures, constants,
and attributes, and change many 32 bit operations to 16 or even 12 bit
operations with absolutely no loss of quality or functionality. This is com-
pletely acceptable, and will beneﬁt all applications, but will almost cer-
tainly induce hard to ﬁnd bugs in the shader compiler. You can really
go overboard with this – if you wanted every last possible precision sav-
ings, you would need to examine texture dimensions and track vertex
buffer data ranges for each shader binding. That would be a really poor
architectural decision, but benchmark pressure pushes vendors to such
lengths if they avoid outright cheating. If really aggressive compiler op-
timizations are implemented, I hope they include a hint or pragma for
”debug mode” that skips all the optimizations.

The OMS uses hydrazine / nitrogen tetroxide, which is way, WAY more

LOX / LH2 are cryogens, and contact with them will give you frostbite.
Hydrazine is carcinogenic and toxic, but nitrogen tetroxide is roughly as
poisonous as the best war gasses from WWI. Plus, it has very low surface
tension, so when it spills, it spreads extremely rapidly, which causes it to
vaporize even faster than the already high vapor pressure would indicate.

Re:No need for GPS
Based on the ﬁrst two responses to this post, you’d think people had never
heard of inertial navigation. With MEMS accelerometers it ought to be
pretty light, too.
Pure 3 axis inertial navigation with a strapdown inertial measuring re-
quires extreme precision. MEMS inertial units aren’t even in the right
ballpark. Mechanical stable platform inertial systems that actually ro-
tated inside the vehicles didn’t require awesomely accurate sensors, but
they are big, heavy, and not as reliable.
It is a useful programming exercise to write a simulation of a strapdown
inertial system and play with bias, noise, and nonlinearity errors (add
cross axis coupling and acceleration effects for micromachined gyros for
bonus points). Pick reasonable ranges and quantize to 12 bits, then in-
tegrate at 100 hz or so. You can start the simulation motionless, but in
a minute it will be cruising along at 60 mph in some random direction,
hundreds of feet from the start position. An hour later, it will be heading
for Mars.
The low end inertial systems that have been moderately soccessful are
done by removing gravity from the equation and just doing 2D naviga-
tion, and often using other sensors, like magnetometers instead of rate
gyros for heading, or odometer readings instead of double integrating
accelerometers. Double integration of interrelated noisy sensors with an
implicit 1G acceleration is really more demanding than it would initially
seem.
The only reason you wouldn’t want to use GPS in an ocean crossing is if
you are afraid a Bad Guy might be jamming the signals.

Peroxide rocket propellants
High concentration hydrogen peroxide all by itself makes a low perfor-
mance, but very convenient, rocket propellant. All hydrogen peroxide is
in solution with some amount of water, because even if you had 100%
peroxide, some of it would start decomposing to water (and oxygen) as
you stored it.
Drugstore peroxide is 3% concentration. If you pour it on a catalyst, like
silver or platinum, you will see bubbles forming in the solution (released
oxygen), and the liquid will get somewhat warmer due to the released
energy. Above roughly 70% concentration, the heat released is enough to
vaporize all the water content, so if you pass it through a good catalyst,
you will get all gas coming out the other side, and gas can be accelerated
through a rocket nozzle to produce thrust. At 70%, the gas is only just
above the boiling point of water, but as the concentration goes up, the
temperature goes up fast. 90% peroxide, the most common grade used
for propulsion, produces gas at about 1400 F temperature. Going all the
way to 98% peroxide, the highest concentration produced, gives a few
hundred degrees more temperature, but at a signiﬁcant price increase.
Higher temperature lets you use less propellant for a given amount of
thrust-time, because it maintains a given chamber pressure with a less

dense, but hotter, mixture (a simpliﬁcation).
”Real” rocket propellants have temperature several thousand degrees higher,
which does indeed increase performance, but the engines have to be
cooled, and you need to manage both a fuel and an oxidizer in some
form. One of our fundamental system trades is that it is better for an X-
Prize class vehicle to use a propellant that simpliﬁes vehicle engineering,
even if you have to use more of it.
We use 90% peroxide from a small specialty supplier for all of our ﬂight
vehicles, but they closed shop a while ago, and we haven’t been able to
come to terms with the only domestic supplier of 90% peroxide, FMC
chemical corp. Because of this, we have been working on alternate pro-
pellant schemes for a good part of this year, in parallel with building the
full size X-Prize vehicle. If we had been able to just buy 90% peroxide
like we buy all of our other industrial chemicals, we never would have
bothered with the research.
Just about every week, someone asks why we don’t concentrate it our-
selves. True, dozens of people have made a few gallons of high concen-
tration peroxide at various times, but there have only been two large scale
concentrators operated in the US outside of the ofﬁcial manufacturers -
Rotary Rocket had a concentrator, but it only went to 85% concentration,
and it didn’t do puriﬁcation, and Beal Aerospace had a large scale con-
centrator operational after the blew up their ﬁrst one. Sure, we could
ﬁgure out how to do it, but then we would be in the chemical plant busi-
ness instead of the rocket business, and that’s not what we want to do. I
am funding an operator in Houston to produce a few thousand pounds
of 90% for us, but he is six months behind schedule on delivery, which
proves my point about it not being as simple as people think.
The direction we have been pursuing is using a combination of 50% per-
oxide, which is readily available through distributors from multiple man-
ufacturers, and a small amount of miscible fuel (methanol in our current
work). 50% peroxide by itself doesn’t work as a rocket propellant, be-
cause you can’t boil all the water, which makes even decomposing most
of the peroxide difﬁcult. Adding a fuel and (the tricky part!) getting it to
burn with the released oxygen gives you the energy necessary to vaporize
the water and get everything up to a high temperature. Mixing fuels with

high concentration oxidizers usually makes a touchy and deadly explo-
sive (we have intentionally detonated a mix of 90% peroxide and alcohol
- Very Scary), but buffered with 50% water, and running off of stoiche-
metric mixture ratio, the risk is not very high. We have a study report
from the Department of Mines in the late 50’s investigating these trinary
mixtures, and our range could not be made to detonate after ﬁve blasting
cap trials, which suits us for safety. In contrast, the nitromethane used in
dragsters can detonate with a hammer blow, so we don’t think we are be-
ing absurdly risky.
This combination gives performance slightly better than 90% peroxide,
probably about equal to 98% peroxide when the inferior density is ac-
counted for. It is less corrosive than 90% peroxide, can’t have a thermal
runaway, and is several times cheaper.
We are still a little concerned about the formation of organic peroxide
compounds if the propellant was left stored for long periods, so we mix
right before use, and always burn off any leftovers.
We aren’t ”done” yet, but it was an important breakthrough for us.

Still, I’m only mildly concerned about the regulatory side of things. I
think it will work out. None of our work is held up by any of this, so
the worst case is that we have a vehicle built and tested repeatedly at
the 200,000 lb-sec waivered impulse limit, with no launch license to al-
low us to ﬁll the tank the rest of the way up. If that happens, THEN we get
peeved about the situation, but continue ﬂight testing with what we can.
Let me repeat: In no way have we been hampered by regulatory burden.
Yet. We have been VERY hampered by commercial companies being too
worried about liability exposure to work with us - peroxide companies,
ﬁlament winders, and parachute companies have all caused us signiﬁ-
cant problems.
The supply issue with 90% peroxide basically cost us almost the entire
year of ﬂight testing. We spent the last six months developing a pro-
pellant combination that could conveniently replace the 90% peroxide
based on widely available chemicals instead of the ultra-specialized propul-
sion grade. We are in the ﬁnal optimizing and scale up phase of that.
Instead of being irate about it, I try to look on the bright side - it is lots
cheaper, easer to handle, and even a bit higher performance.

worked so well on the subscale vehicle, and should be testing it this week-
end. If it works well, we will be repeating the boosted hop with the big

The ﬂight time is currently limited by federal law to 15 seconds of rocket
burn time. We have a waiver coming to extend that to 120 seconds, but
beyond that we will need a full launch license.
The signiﬁcance of all this is that the vehicles are intended to ﬂy up, come
back down and land right where they took off from, all without ablating,
expending, or seperating anything. It should be possible to have turn
around times under one hour even for quite large vehicles.

A variety of responses:
We don’t expect to win the X-Prize, both because Burt probably has it
in the bag, and we are behind schedule. We still plan on continuing
our development, because our designs are nearly an order of magnitude
cheaper to fabricate and operate than Space Ship One, and orders of
magnitude matter. If SS1 crashes on Monday, we will throw more time
and resources at an attempt, because there really is no other contender,
but it will be a long shot.
We could have ﬂown an unguided rocket to very high altitudes a long
time ago, but we have instead concentrated on control systems, which is
where the important work needs to be done. A team that was busy ﬂying
rockets to hundreds of thousands of feet altitude, then decided to add a
guidance and control system to their rockets would be in for many rude
surprises at high energy levels.
This isn’t immediately obvious, but an X-Prize class vehicle pretty much
requires an active control system (a trained pilot with appropriate con-
trols is also an active control system). A short burn time rocket, like the
recent CSXT 100 km shot, can live with just aerodynamic stabilization
(note that it also landed 20 miles away), but the G forces are far too high
for people. As the burn time lengthens with lower acceleration forces, the
vehicle will gravity turn away from vertical, making it almost impossible
to keep a 60 second burn time even accelerating upwards.
People that harp on about propellant speciﬁc impulse in the context of
suborbital rockets are like programmers that obsessively optimize a func-
tion that isn’t a hot spot. The goal of a rocket ship is not to deliver speciﬁc
impulse, it is to move a payload reliably and cost effectively. Isp can al-
ways be traded away for mass fraction, and quite often you can improve
operability or reliability by doing so. With our new vehicle designs using a
single engine and jet vanes instead of four differentially throttled engines
we are more likely to consider trading some engine and system complex-
ity for performance, but issues like the requirement for deep throttling
still make it a complex decision.

Re:This is what a rocket ship SHOULD look like....
I ﬁgure you need about four times as much fuel at liftoff for a vertical
rocket-borne landing as you would for a parachute- or wing-borne land-
ing.
No, not even remotely close.
You only need enough propellant to kill the terminal velocity of the ve-
hicle to land it safely. A vehicle that is stable reentering base ﬁrst has a
Cd right around 1.0, and any high performance rocket vehicle is going
to be coming in pretty light after it has burned most of the propellant.
The V2 impacted the ground still supersonic because it was aerodynam-
ically stable nose ﬁrst, so it maintained its 0.15 or so Cd on descent. A
reasonably stubby base ﬁrst reentry will have a terminal velocity of only
200 mph or so.
Killing that speed with a comfortable safety margin takes about 400 pounds
of propellant in our vehicle, compared to 8000 pounds of propellant burned
on ascent. A higher performance rocket engine could do it with propo-
tionately smaller amounts. A parachute / drogue / ejection system for
this weight vehicle is indeed lighter, coming in at about 100 pounds, but
that brings a number of disadvantages with it, like coming down tens of
miles away and still needing ﬁnal impact attenuation.
We wanted to use parachtues as a quick hack for the X-Prize, but the test

Long term, there is no question in our minds that powered landing is the
way to go. We just were given a pretty strong incentive to go there earlier
than we were planning.
1.81.4
Re:This is what a rocket ship SHOULD look like....
Actually, you underestimated this one.
Since the ”payload” of an X-Prize vehicle is three x 200 lb people, needing
400 pounds of landing propellant turns our 850 gallon tank vehicle from
a three person vehicle into a one person vehicle.
In the most negative light, you could say that powered landing (with a low
performance propellant like we use) takes away two thirds of our payload
capacity, but that is a poor metric to base decisions off of, because opera-
tional issues have historically been orders of magnitude more important
to cost effectiveness than propellant consumption.
We can get the 400 pounds back by either going to a carbon ﬁber tank
instead of a ﬁberglass tank (cost: $40k up front design fee, then $25k per
tank, compared to $9k for the ﬁberglass tank), or by upsizing everything
to a 1600 gallon ﬁberglass tank (cost: $17k for the tank plus more for big-
ger engine plumbing, catalysts, and nozzles).
Upsizing the tank is lower risk, because it only uses suppliers that we
already buy from, while the carbon ﬁber tank job would be custom from
ATK, and I have already had two other vendors back out on me for big
tank work. We already have a 1600 gallon ﬁberglass tank on hand.
Our mixed monoprop has a measured sea level Isp of 145, with normal
increases with altitude. Our big vehicles have a mass ratio of about ﬁve,
takes off with somewhat under one positive G of acceleration, and has
a somewhat regressive thrust proﬁle from partial blowdown pressuriza-
tion. That combination is sufﬁcient for suborbital ﬂights. A 200+ Isp
biprop can do it with a mass ratio of three, but the vehicle gets a lot more
complicated to build and operate.

I’m proud of it.
I am extremely proud of Doom 3. I think it is the best game we have
ever made, and it exceeded all of my expectations. That is a rather trite
phrase, but it is literally true – I had a good set of expectations for how
the game would turn out based on the technologies that it was built on,
and it wound up being just plain better than that.
We think a lot of people will like it.
I don’t follow gaming message boards, because, at its best, entertain-
ment is going to be a subjective thing that can’t win for everyone, while at
worst, a particular game just becomes a random symbol for petty tribal
behavior. This slashdot story is about as close as I want to go...
Amidst all the various Doom ports and expansions, we are starting up on
our next game. It will have a new rendering engine, which will be keeping
me busy for a while, but the only other thing we are saying for now is that
it won’t be a sequel to any of our previous work. We have a really solid
team that did a lot of maturing through Doom’s development, so I have
high hopes that it won’t be another four year odyssey.

I hated it, but it is a big industry, and there is a broad range of people
involved. Honestly, I’m almost certainly in the minority. One developer
that I was talking to backstage was very bullish about how important it
was to legitimize the industry with events like this, but I just don’t have
any empathy for what I perceive as ”Hollywood envy”.
Some award show issues are just a result of stupidity – I felt so bad watch-

threw out what they gave me to say about Will, and wrote something

I do feel that there is a rather fundamental mismatch with big awards
shows for game development, because game development isn’t a per-
forming art. You expect actors and musicians to show well, because that
is what they do. Why aren’t awards for authors the same glamorous events
that the movie / TV / music ones are? Game developers are much closer
to authors than actors.

with Wolfenstein-3D performance (the DoomRPG engine has some extra

native implementation, and benchmarks that focus on expression and
control operations will overestimate relative performance for applica-
tions that are array access heavy. Still, if a java app on that phone per-
formed like a P3-100mhz, it would be pretty impressive.
It is true that a good JIT (which the phones don’t have) can make java
code go nearly as fast as C/C++ code that is written in the same style. The
”in the same style” part is often overlooked – in lower level languages you
often have options for implementation with pointers and CPU tailoring
that would make the code look very different, but go signiﬁcantly faster.
I still generally like java, and maximizing performance is only important
in a rather limited subset of software engineering.

Games - Are Video Game Patents Next? -
Jun 2005
1.88.1
Parasites.
I’m proud that there is ”a relative dearth of patent applications for the
video game industry, especially considering how technology-dependent
the video game industry is, and given its size in terms of annual sales.”
Before issuing a condemnation, I try hard to think about it from their
point of view – the laws of the land set the rules of the game, and lawyers
are deeply confused at why some of us aren’t using all the tools that the
game gives us.
Patents are usually discussed in the context of someone ”stealing” an
idea from the long suffering lone inventor that devoted his life to creating
this one brilliant idea, blah blah blah.
But in the majority of cases in software, patents effect independent in-
vention. Get a dozen sharp programmers together, give them all a hard
problem to work on, and a bunch of them will come up with solutions
that would probably be patentable, and be similar enough that the ﬁrst
programmer to ﬁle the patent could sue the others for patent infringe-
ment.
Why should society reward that? What beneﬁt does it bring? It doesn’t
help bring more, better, or cheaper products to market. Those all come
from competition, not arbitrary monopolies. The programmer that ﬁled
the patent didn’t work any harder because a patent might be available,
solving the problem was his job and he had to do it anyway. Getting a
patent is uncorrelated to any positive attributes, and just serves to allow
either money or wasted effort to be extorted from generally unsuspecting
and innocent people or companies.
Yes, it is a legal tool that may help you against your competitors, but I’ll
have no part of it. Its basically mugging someone.

game performance
How much do you want to bet a bunch of those developers drop support for
PPC Macs far sooner than the aforementioned ”3-5 year” period and claim
that the games demand the ”performance” of the faster Intel machines. We
already saw that when Doom 3 was released for the Mac. It supported only
the very fastest Macs while leaving many other current and/or new Macs
out in the lurch.
Does he think we just sit around and say ”Lets just not support the rest of
these macs because we want to screw the user base!”
We work with Apple, ATI, and Nvidia to make everything run as well as
possible. Doom 3 had AltiVec code in it, and there were driver changes
to make things work better. The bottom line is that the compiler / cpu
/ system / graphics card combinations available for macs has just never
been as fast as the equivalent x86/windows systems. The performance
gap is not a myth or the result of malicious developers trying to make
your platform of choice look bad.
Yes, it is always possible to make an application faster, but expecting de-
velopers to work harder on the mac platform than on windows is not
reasonable. The xbox version of Doom required extensive effort in both
programming and content to get good performance, but it was justiﬁed
because of the market. In hindsight, we probably should have waited and
ported the xbox version of the game to the mac, which would have played
on a broader range of hardware. Of course, then we would have taken
criticism for only giving the mac community the ”crippled, cut down ver-
sion”.

Re:No problems here
All the quenching problems were with our mixed-monoprop scheme that
used low concentration (50%) peroxide mixed with a small amount of
methanol.
If you can get high concentration peroxide (85%+), there are no catalyst
quenching problems. We started out with 90% peroxide, and we would
still be using it (and would have saved a year of work...) if we had a willing
supplier. The original supplier we used went out of business, and the
remaining domestic supplier didn’t want to do business with us, even for
> $100,000 orders.
We did a number of peroxide / kerosene biprop tests back in August /
September 2002 before we ran out of high concentration peroxide.
We are pretty happy with liquid oxygen now, but if Bezos is sure that sup-
ply won’t be an issue, peroxide/kerosene is certainly not a bad choice.
The sole drawback I would note is that it will put a lower limit on his
operating expenses, and a LOX based system could potentially undercut
him, although that would only be an issue when ticket prices are getting
down towards $10k.

The various technologies that essentially rasterize arbitrary parts are what
excite the imagination, but I don’t expect any radical changes in society
any time soon from them. Stereolithography is pretty mature, and getting
arbitrary parts rasterized in plastic is fairly common today. However, in
99% of the cases, these are still used as models / proof of concept / R&D,
not actual manufacturing, because they are drastically more expensive
than, say, injection molding, and more mechanically limited. There are
a lot of technologies touted for rasterizing 3D metal parts, but I spent
some time recently trying to ﬁnd a place to fab modest sized rocket en-
gines, and none of the companies I spoke with were able to handle it for
various reasons.
I do expect this to become very exciting, but it is several years away. The
excitement won’t be about fabricating things that you currently buy (con-
ventional mass production will retain signiﬁcant cost beneﬁts), but al-
lowing low cost R&D. When you can send an arbitrary 3D CAD model
over the net to a company with a metal rapid prototyping machine (they
will remain expensive for quite some time) and get your part overnighted
to you in a couple days with no setup fees, you will be able to iterate de-
sign cycles twice a week at quite low expense. You can do this today with
plastic, and in some limited cases of small metal parts, but when you
can start doing it in signiﬁcant engineering materials that can be used in
functional prototype machines, lots of new opportunities will arise.

Re:Hmm
Personally, I think the Q3 code is pretty clean on the whole. It was a com-
mercial product done under time pressure, so it isn’t a polished gem, but
I consider it good.
Anyone working on the Q3 codebase today should just delete all the asm
code and use the C implementations. Making a commercial game with
fairly high end requirements go 10% faster is sometimes worth writing
some asm code, but years later when the frame rate pressure is essen-
tially gone, the asm code should just be dumped in the name of main-
tainability. All the comments in the world wouldn’t change this decision
a bit.
But there’s really little reason to use asm anymore, since the autovectoriza-
tion in gcc is very nice.
I was pretty much with you until that point. I fully agree that there is little
reason to use asm anymore (I haven’t written any in years – Jan Paul did
all the SIMD work for Doom 3). Knowledge of asm is good to allow you to
manipulate compiler output by changing your C++ code, but there isn’t
much call for writing it by hand.
However, autovectorization in gcc is a particularly bad argument against
writing asm code. Scalar compiler code is much, much closer to hand
codeed asm in performance than compiler generated SIMD code is. Op-
timized SIMD coding almost always requires signiﬁcant transformations
that compilers can’t really do on their own.
The argument about inline asm hurting compiler optimizations is only
true if you are trying to use short snippets of asm, which is generally a
bad idea. Asm code that doesn’t loop a lot isn’t likely to contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to your performance, with the exception of things like ftol re-
placements.

Re:John Carmack disagree’s with the article
As a follow up, some people aren’t realizing that it isn’t necessary to actu-
ally have a chemical reaction and form an organic peroxide molecule to
make an explosive. A solution of oxidizer and fuel can easily be a shock
sensitive explosive. This requires higher concentration peroxide than is
available off the shelf, but concentrating a modest amount is not very
challenging.
The feasibility of this really isn’t open for debate. There is no doubt that
you can reliably mix two liquids and produce a high explosive that can
be detonated with a sharp impact.
A quest for perfect safety from all conceivable threats is, of course, ridicu-
lous, but I’m sure there will be many more added security measures thrown
in as a result of this, to little real beneﬁt and much general annoyance.

Probably the CS degree.
Game programs have been somewhat useful for ﬁnding employees, but

A CS or EE degree will almost certainly serve you better throughout your
life than a game/media degree, but if getting into the industry immedi-
ately is your overriding concern, a game program will help with contacts
and opportunities.
Exceptional merit will eventually be noticed (perhaps not as quickly as
you would like, though), and a degree of any sort is not required if you
can conclusively demonstrate that you will contribute great value to a
company. However, many entry level positions are ﬁlled based on peo-
ple’s opinions about potential, and honest assessments from faculty that
work with lots of students does carry some weight.

I’m not sure where that quote came from – IdTech 5 as a whole is not a
clean sheet of paper design, there are some good sized chunks that have
clear heritage to Doom 3 / Q4 / ETQW. The rendering engine is certainly
from-scratch, but that is a rather small chunk of a complete engine today.
I was always somewhat hesitant about broad licensing because I feared
something exactly like this, where a developer thinks they see something
in an engine, but it doesn’t turn out the way they expected, and they sue.
It is possible that explicit promises were made and broken, but it is also
possible that the licensee just failed for the same reasons that most game
development project fail, and is looking for a scapegoat. Game develop-
ment is hard, engine license or no engine license.
During Doom 3’s development, our licensees had access to our source
control server, so there was never a question of them not having access
to what we are using. They would have been foolish to try to use daily
builds, but the option was available to them.

The iTunes distribution channel is really a more important aspect than

Give me a little credit here. I am not suggesting that everyone blindly

I assumed everyone understood that. What you might have missed is
that I’m not proposing a sparse voxel octree as some form of bounding
hierarchy to reduce intersection tests against triangles, I am proposing
that it REPLACE hierarchies of triangles or other primitives for some data
sets, and this brings about signiﬁcant improvements (data size) that you
wouldn’t have with even inﬁnitely fast conventional ray tracing. I’m also
not trying to say that this is some novel brainstorm of mine, but I have
some practical experience with the direction, and I think it has promise.
One of my major points is that this is all still theoretical. I don’t know
what is going to be the right architecture for next gen systems. Neither
do you, or Intel, Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo. If I had to place a
bet, it is that rasterization will still be dominant, but it is a Good Thing

pop out whatever data is stored there (probably some vector quantized

A pretty hot (both literally and ﬁguratively) bipropellant rocket could man-

However, an actual jet pack that used atmospheric oxygen could have an

Here, it really is a matter of technical development, since jet engines have
thrust to weight ratios too low to make it practical. There is movement
