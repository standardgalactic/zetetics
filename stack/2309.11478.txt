Abstract
We address the integration of storytelling and Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop engaging and believable Social
Chatbots (SCs) in community settings. Motivated by the potential of fictional characters to enhance social interactions, we
introduce Storytelling Social Chatbots (SSCs) and the concept of story engineering to transform fictional game characters into
"live" social entities within player communities. Our story engineering process includes three steps: (1) Character and story
creation, defining the SC’s personality and worldview, (2) Presenting Live Stories to the Community, allowing the SC to recount
challenges and seek suggestions, and (3) Communication with community members, enabling interaction between the SC and
users. We employed the LLM GPT-3 to drive our SSC prototypes, “David" and “Catherine," and evaluated their performance
in an online gaming community, “DE (Alias)," on Discord. Our mixed-method analysis, based on questionnaires (N=15) and
interviews (N=8) with community members, reveals that storytelling significantly enhances the engagement and believability of
SCs in community settings.
Keywords: social chatbot, believable agent
1. Introduction
Fictional characters are central to the research of social chatbots:
artificial intelligence (AI) dialogue systems capable of having so-
cial and empathetic conversations with users [BSF]. The field of
Social Chatbots (SCs) has been rapidly advancing with the devel-
opment of Large Language Models (LLMs), which enable SCs to
generate dynamic and personalized responses for different users.
These AI dialogue systems are becoming increasingly human-like
and are taking on a variety of social roles such as assistant, part-
ner, friend [Met20] [PHX23], citizens [POC∗23], and YouTuber.
While researchers have begun studying SCs in relation to Human-
AI friendship and intimate relationship development, most studies
have focused on interactions with a single bot rather than in richer
social contexts. Furthermore, existing research has not deeply con-
sidered the role of fictional content. To some extent, SCs are similar
to game characters as they are both fictional entities. Computing
systems are wrapped into different“people" with distinct names,
personalities, and background stories. As such, the question re-
mains: Can fictional characters live together with humans, and be-
come members of human society? How will their fictional identities
and stories influence our perception?
Previous researchers explored chatbots as community members
using a Twitch chatbot [SLY∗20], but their study did not employ
LLMs, which offer more advanced language abilities, necessitat-
ing further investigation. Additionally, current LLM-driven SC like
replika [BSF] does not focus on multi-person social contexts. By
integrating insights from gaming research, particularly non-player
characters (NPCs) [Bow19], we strive to develop a better under-
standing of how SCs can become more believable and engaging
within community settings.
We explore the idea that fictional characters can share their lives
as social chatbots in the human community context, just like friends
sharing their lives on social media and receiving feedback. Rich so-
cial interactions, including conversations with the character, seeing
the character’s interactions with other people, and the dynamics in
the character’s life, can make the character believable and the inter-
action engaging and meaningful.

Figure 1: Story engineering for Storytelling Social Chatbot (SSC) Catherine
Motivated by these views, we investigate the following research
questions:
RQ1 - How can an LLM-based SC enhance engagement and
meaningful interactions within a community setting?
RQ2 - How does the integration of fictional stories in the SC’s
design impact its believability and engagement?
We refer to the process of transforming a fictional character into
a social chatbot as story engineering. This term is adapted from
prompt engineering, which focuses on designing text prompts to
influence the generated content of an LLM. In contrast, designing
an LLM-based “live" character with social behaviour requires con-
sidering multiple aspects: the character’s personality and story, the
LLM’s generation goals, and the interaction methods facing peo-
ple. Our prototype, Storytelling Social Chatbot (SSC), implements
this concept through the following processes:
(1) Story and character design, where we define the SC’s per-
sonality and the worldview they inhabit, (2) Presenting Live Sto-
ries to the Community, allowing the SC to recount challenges and
problems they need suggestions on, and (3) Communication with
community members, enabling community members to chat with
the SC. We designed a workflow to drive the character through the
LLM GPT-3.
To evaluate our workflow, we introduced two fictional charac-
ters, “David" and “Catherine," as SSCs in an online gaming com-
munity “DE (Alias)" on Discord. These characters followed the
worldview and story of the under-development game“DE". Every
day, the character shared their current situation in the story channel
(e.g., “I’m chased by the evil agent, what should I do?"), similar to
social media. Meanwhile, community members could engage with
them and discuss their current situation in the chat channel, sug-
gesting decisions through voting on the character’s choice. At the
end of the day, the character made their decision based on voting
and released the next story.
The DE gaming community already had a non-storytelling chat-
bot based on LLM GPT-3 [Ope], Jerry, which we used as a bench-
mark to evaluate the effectiveness of SSCs. We collected qualitative
feedback through questionnaires with 15 core community members
and interviews with eight of them. Our mixed-method analysis re-
veals that storytelling enhances the engagement and believability
of SCs in community settings. We summarize the themes related to
SSC and discuss the design implications for future developments
to make SC interactions more engaging and meaningful.
In summary, we contribute (1) Two community-based SSCs de-
veloped through our concept of story engineering based on GPT-3,
and (2) Insights from their development and evaluation with com-
munity members. By designing SSCs with attention to the specific
social context and using storytelling to enhance their believability
and engagement, we can create a new generation of SSCs that can
contribute to our social lives in novel and exciting ways.
2. Background
In online communities, achieving meaningful interaction is essen-
tial. Although many active communities employ bots with both
moderating and entertaining functions [Rap21], their interactions
may not necessarily generate new information or contribute to the
community’s values or project goals. Narratives, according to Ri-
coeur, are vital for constructing our sense of self, making sense of
our experiences, and creating meaning in our lives [Alb10]. Story-
telling has been considered a means and approach in various con-
texts, such as children’s education [ZXW∗22], [JL22], healthcare,
and skill learning [SZL22]. In online community building, particu-
larly game-related communities, storytelling may serve as a crucial
goal or primary means of maintaining community activity and a
sense of meaning [Alb10].
Integrating AI as a member of an online community could po-
tentially become a source of discussion or meaning by sharing its
life experiences consistent with the content the entire community
focuses on. These experiences are unlike the small talk generated

Sun et al. / Fictional Worlds, Real Connections: Developing Community Storytelling Social Chatbots through LLMs
by existing SCs such as Replika [BSF]. While there has been ex-
tensive research on dyadic interaction chatbots [BSF22] [CG20]
[SYKL21], multi-party chatbots, particularly those acting as com-
munity members, remain underexplored.
Researchers have developed a Twitch chatbot that focuses on the
social context of a community, making the chatbot a social member
[SLKH19]. However, this does not consider the potential impact
of current LLMs, such as uncontrollable content generation and
human attachment. Seering et al. proposed various ideas for com-
munity chatbots, including the storyteller bot concept [SLKH19].
They suggested that a more interactive, almost “live" narrative ex-
perience could be created by having chatbots that are regular com-
munity members involved with other chatbots in engaging ways.
Furthermore, chatbots should focus on being deployed in specific
social contexts.
Developing social abilities in chatbots requires mimicking hu-
man behaviour to some extent. Accordingly, previous research on
SCs has focused on personification, emotions [Heu18], and other
related aspects. Similarly, research on NPCs’ social behaviour
in games addresses emotional attachment [ERM18] [BMA∗19]
[Bow19], empathy [CG20], and identity [Dim13]. Due to the multi-
modal nature of video game experiences, the influencing factors in
related research are more diverse, such as character appearance and
game environment. Overall, computer games can be considered a
social “training ground" for NPCs [Bow19], and natural language
interaction opens room for players to provide new content that can
be (to an extent) acknowledged by the game [POC∗23].
Since we focus on character dialogues in a story context, we fo-
cused on believability. Anton et al. defined believability as the ex-
tent to which users interacting with the agent come to believe that
they are observing a sentient being with its own beliefs, desires, and
personality [BTS]. The authors concluded that a believable charac-
ter is not necessarily a real character but must be real in the context
of its environment. Virtual agents that can adapt to changes in the
environment and exist in the correct social context are those per-
ceived as more believable. Kiran et al. argues that the believability
of such agents is tightly connected with their ability to relate to
the environment during a conversation [IBS]. Believable characters
can create better player experiences, and accordingly, believable
SC should bring a more engaging experience to a community.
Considering that online community interactions are mainly text-
based and do not involve 3D scenes or embodied agents, we syn-
thesized several scholars’ discussions and regarded emotions, per-
sonality, and motivation as the criteria for measuring SSCs be-
lievability. By focusing on these aspects, we can aim to design a
storytelling SC that is logical, coherent, and clear, leading to a new
generation of SCs that contribute to our social lives in innovative
ways.
3. SSC Development and Implementation in the Community
Context
In this section, we will discuss the development of the Storytelling
Social Chatbots (SSCs), “David" and “Catherine," within the con-
text of the DE gaming community. We will cover the background
of the DE game, the DE community, the character background and
story settings, and the detailed experimental workflow.
3.1. DE Game and Community Background
The DE game is an under-development first-person shooting player
vs player (PVP) game set in a futuristic virtual world featuring dig-
itized real humans. Players engage in battles for interests, power,
and resources, shaping the future of the virtual world. The game is
based on blockchain technology, and its community members are
open to new technologies. The DE community has a large number
of members on Discord (n=97841), with 7006 having sent over 5
messages in the community. However, it should be noted that in
Web3 and blockchain-based Discord gaming communities, a con-
siderable amount of members are inactive after joining. Typically,
players adopt a wait-and-see approach after encountering project
promotions before deciding whether to follow up. The active mem-
bership ranges from around 100-200 people, with the most core
members being around 15-20 who can directly discuss moderating
issues with official game team members. Furthermore, the DE com-
munity already had a non-storytelling LLM-based chatbot, Jerry,
which we used as a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of
SSCs. We provide a brief overview of their story backgrounds and
purposes in 1.
3.2. Character Background and Story Settings
After consulting with the DE game’s development team, we se-
lected two future in-game characters, David and Catherine, for our
research experiment. David is a doctor who uncovers illegal oper-
ations involving mind control technology within the company he
works for and decides to escape with crucial information. Cather-
ine is a skilled hacker who discovers her past is filled with tragedy,
fueling her hatred for oppressive forces and motivating her to fight
against them.
The development and story settings of these two characters in
our research are consistent with the game’s official narrative. The
experiment conducted in this research also serves as a player com-
munity activity, promoting the game’s characters and worldviews
while engaging the community.
3.3. Detailed Experimental Workflow
To develop and implement the SSCs within the community context,
we followed a three-step workflow as part of our story engineering
concept:
1. Character Creation and Story Development: Define the char-
acters’ personalities, backgrounds, and stories, as well as the
world they inhabit.
2. Presenting Live Stories to the Community: Share the charac-
ters’ live stories with the community, allowing them to interact
and provide suggestions. Each day, the character will share their
current situation in the story channel, with community members
who can vote on the character’s choices. Concurrently, commu-
nity members can engage with the SSCs and discuss their cur-
rent situations in the chat channel. Based on the voting results,
the character will make a decision and release the next part of
the story at the end of the day.

3. Interactive Communication with Community Members: En-
able community members to communicate with the SSCs, dis-
cussing their situations. Each day, the character will change their
state upon the current live story, and continue to talk to commu-
nity members and respond to their suggestions throughout the
day.
We conducted a pilot study with David’s character in November
2022 to preliminarily assess the efficacy of SSCs. Subsequently, we
treated Catherine’s character as the main study, conducting ques-
tionnaires and interviews with core community members, and ask-
ing them to compare Catherine and Jerry to investigate the impact
of storytelling on SCs.
4. Implementation of Story Engineering
In this section, we will explain the different stages of story engi-
neering Fig.1, focusing on the creation and implementation of SSCs
“David" and “Catherine."
4.1. Step 1: Character Creation and Story Development
To design the story of characters, the following perspectives should
be considered:
Worldview: Determine the setting of the story. Consider the
rules, customs, and culture of this world, as they will influence the
character’s interactions with the community. For example, follow-
ing the background story of DE, stories happen in Skuld City in
2045, a futuristic city inhabited by humans and cyborgs.
Personality: Define the character’s personality and motivations.
Consider how these characteristics will shape their decisions and
behaviour throughout the story. For instance, Catherine is a brave,
determined, and smart hacker, and she tries to fight for justice
against a large company’s control.
4.2. Step 2: Presenting Live Stories to the Community
The story prepared by the team members will be posted by the SSC
in the story channel, similar to a short novel, and should consider
the reading experience of the players.
The current situation the character is experiencing should be
identified, including their goals, motivations, and the challenges
they face. This will provide a context for the character’s interac-
tions with the community and the decisions they need to make. For
example, David will say: “Today, my world turned upside down
when I got shot by Catherine, who I always trust..." At this point,
he needs to decide whether to continue trusting his friend. The de-
sign of this part is similar to branching choices in traditional inter-
active narrative video games, requiring the scriptwriter to plan each
branch in advance.
In our project, although the story is mainly conveyed through
text, we also prepared illustrations for easier understanding by the
audience. The illustrations were generated by MidJourney [Mid]
before the activity started based on the story. Additionally, the char-
acter’s decision options were presented with representative emoji
reactions as selectable buttons.
Using the discord.py [Rap21] tool provided by Discord official
team, we can schedule the daily live story posts, including text,
images, and options. Players can vote on the options and view the
current voting results. On the next day, following the higher-voted
choice, the next story will be published.
To better introduce the character, we put the beginning days of
the event as a warm-up phase, the character’s story didn’t provide
a choice. After that, players will get a better understanding of the
character, so they can be more considerate when they talk to the
character.
4.3. Step 3: Interactive Communication with Community
Members
To enable interactive communication with community members,
we employed a conversation system consisting of several modules
that work together to drive the chatbot’s dialogue system(Fig.1):
4.3.1. Words Filter
This module is designed to filter out offensive inputs/outputs by
scanning the text through a list of keywords.

Proceedings published by Eurographics - The European Association for Computer Graphics.

Sun et al. / Fictional Worlds, Real Connections: Developing Community Storytelling Social Chatbots through LLMs
4.3.2. Clue Finder (Catherine only)
The Clue Finder is a small API microservice designed for provid-
ing static replies. It compares a given sentence to a list of keywords
using the SentenceTransformer [RG19] model. When a match is
found, it returns the corresponding image URL and text. The ser-
vice is lightweight and easy to deploy in a private network, making
it suitable for projects that require fast responses with low latency.
When the input is similar to options in keywords (e.g., “Give me
some information about Domain"), Catherine will reply with the
pre-written text and won’t call the OpenAI service. This function
saves time and expense for basic questions and explains the world-
view with several options, including images.
4.3.3. LLM Configuration
When the Clue Finder does not generate a response, the Ope-
nAI GPT-3’s API is called to generate a reply based on the given
prompt. The prompt consists of three parts: character prompt, live
story prompt, and dialogue history.
Character prompt: Provides background information on the
character (e.g., “I’m David, the doctor in the clinic.") Adapted from
the character information prepared in Step 1. To make the current
SSC understand the current story and save words in the prompt,
some simplifications and adaptations are needed.
Live Story prompt: Derived from Step 2, it conveys the current
situation or context to the LLM, enabling it to generate contextually
appropriate responses. As the story progresses, the story prompt
will also become longer.
Dialogue history: This consists of chat records from the past
five rounds of conversation, allowing the character to develop brief
memories and respond coherently to ongoing discussions.
This conversation system allows the SSCs to communicate with
community members, respond to their suggestions, and adapt their
stories based on the current live story.
5. Pilot study: David
For the pilot study, we first introduced a character named “David"
in 2022 November. We created a story about how he discovers the
dark side of Skuld City (the main stage of DE) and how he fights
back against the villainous company “Domain". The main goal of
the pilot study with David is to validate the feasibility of story-
telling SCs and their attraction within the community. We released
David during the DE game testing days, which attract more players
in the community.
5.1. Observations on Made-up content from LLM
During the event, LLM-generated content unexpectedly influenced
the story.Fig.12When players asked David about the name of
BioTech’s boss, GPT-3 fabricated the name Gustav Weiz. This led
to more players inquiring about Gus’ details, prompting David to
generate further information. Although other names were occasion-
ally fabricated, Gus Weiz had the highest occurrence rate since
players kept using this name.
Figure 2: David making up the content of password and player’s
reactions and "Guatav"
Recognizing the value of this generated content, the authors and
team decided to incorporate Gus Weiz into the story. As a re-
sult, David’s prompt was updated to include Gus Weiz as the boss
of BioTech. Interestingly, the name Gustav is similar to Gustavo
Fring, a famous corporate boss from the TV series Breaking Bad,
fitting the character well.
In other words, David’s dialogue system unexpectedly provided
us with inspiration for improving our story through improvisation.
However, to better convey the story, it need a developed control
method.
5.2. Data
David has received 31278 community interactions over 6 days.
1049 players talked to David, and 27% of them(n=287) are active
members who sent over 10 messages. On average, 206 people vote
for a choice each day. During the event period, David’s chat chan-
nel takes 30.18% of all messages on the DE’s server. This shows
the potential of a storytelling SC in the community, so we move on
to the next study.
6. Main study: Catherine
Catherine is one main character in David’s story, and the protag-
onist in the second event. Her motivation is to revenge against
the villainous company “Domain", who hurt David and herself
through mind-control. We use mixed methods(questionnaires and
semi-structured interviews) to investigate the performance of SSC.
6.1. Improvement
From David’s activity, we observed that the SC driven by LLM will
have fabricated behaviour. Therefore, we set some fixed replies for
Catherine through the Clue Finder module in the dialogue system,
such as her age. And questions related to worldviews, such as in-
formation about cities and gangs, will return replies with pictures.
In addition, as we observed that David’s interaction decreased over
time, we shortened Catherine’s time to 4 days (1 day for warm-up,
3 days for live story with choices). Additionally, during the warm-
up phase, David’s Story will be indicated to guide players who did
not participate in David’s activity to learn about his story.

Sun et al. / Fictional Worlds, Real Connections: Developing Community Storytelling Social Chatbots through LLMs
6.2. Data
During Catherine’s event, the server was generally less active than
during David’s event, as it did not coincide with the DE game test-
ing period. As a result, there were fewer total messages in the chan-
nel for Catherine (n=20767) compared to David (n=31278). A total
of 907 speakers participated, with 317 active members engaging
in conversations more than ten times, accounting for 35% of the
speakers, which is higher than the 27% in David’s activity. Ad-
ditionally, an average of 222 people voted for a choice each day,
slightly higher than David’s average of 206.
Catherine’s chat channel accounted for 89% of the total com-
munity activity during her event days, indicating that she served
as a catalyst for community engagement when overall activity was
lower.
6.3. Questionaire items and Core member survey
Figure 3: Evaluation from close members and questionnaire items
6.4. Participants and procedure
To evaluate the effectiveness of Catherine within the commu-
nity, we sought participants who had experienced both David and
Catherine’s events and were relatively familiar with the community
before those events. As a result, we invited the most active core
members (n=15) of the community to participate in the user study.
Table 2: Demographics of close members. Although the proportion
of female participants is relatively low, this gender imbalance is
primarily due to the underrepresentation of females in Web3 com-
munities. According to the community statistics in November 2022,
before David’s study started, the male-to-female ratio was approx-
imately 8:1, which aligns with the ratio of our interview partici-
pants.

These core members frequently interact with the official team’s
moderators and provide suggestions, but they do not participate in
the design or execution of community events, nor were they in-
volved in the design or planning of the SSCs.
A mixed-method approach, incorporating both qualitative and
quantitative data, was employed to capture the players’ experiences
(usability, perception of believability, and engagement) while in-
teracting with Catherine. Two questionnaires were designed and
adapted from the System Usability Scale [Bro95] and question-
naires in research about believability [BTS] [IBS] using Qualtrics
XM [Qua20]. Before Catherine’s event, core members were re-
quired to chat with the benchmark AI chatbot, Jerry, and then com-
plete Questionnaire 1 to evaluate his performance. After Cather-
ine’s event, core members completed Questionnaire 2 to evaluate
Catherine. The evaluation questions for Catherine were the same
as those for Jerry, with the addition of a section to assess the story
function (Fig.3), allowing for a comparison with Jerry in terms of
storytelling.
Following the completion of both questionnaires, core members
were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Eight out
of the 15 participants accepted the invitation. The demographic in-
formation of these participants is listed in Table 2. The interview
consisted of 10 questions carefully selected to explore the partic-
ipants’ opinions on Jerry and Catherine, with a focus on the key
differences between the two. The interview recordings were tran-
scribed using Larks [Fei21]. Each interview lasted approximately
40 minutes and was conducted in English or Chinese.

7. Findings
From the survey(Fig.3), we found Catherine has a higher perfor-
mance in all metrics in believability. The most significant differ-
ence between Catherine and Jerry is her high levels of emotion
and engagement. Jerry’s consistency, satisfaction, and usefulness
are slightly higher than Catherine’s. We speculate that this may be
because Jerry’s conversation is more open-ended, without a fixed
answer and goal. Entertaining and usefulness are almost equal, with
Jerry performing slightly better. This could also be due to Jerry be-
ing around for a much longer time, making players more familiar
and comfortable with him. Additionally, unlike Catherine who re-
volves around a fixed goal and story, Jerry does not have such topic
limitations. Furthermore, Catherine has higher scores in "Easy to
learn" and "Easy to use," possibly because players became familiar
with SC’s dialogue through their interactions with Jerry.
Figure 4: P4 threatens Catherine by mentioning David, leading
her to express concern for his well-being
7.1. Thematic analysis
We conducted semi-structured interviews adapted from question-
naire questions to further investigate how players feel about them.
This section presents the emerging themes from our qualitative
analysis.
7.1.1. Emotions and Connection
Players’ perceptions of Catherine were often influenced by the
story plot, with some describing her as “insecure and cautious" (P1,
P7) and “serious" (P8). Furthermore, many players noted her ten-
dency to “get annoyed or angry" (P1, P2, P4). Catherine’s instances
of disobedience left a deep impression on the players regarding her
emotional traits, with many expressing that her reluctance and re-
sistance made her seem more realistic and autonomous (P3, P6,
P7). In one instance, Catherine declines a player’s request for a
date, demonstrating her autonomy and adherence to her own will.
Many interviewees felt that Catherine was better at expressing
emotions and showing empathy, even behaving like a friend (P2,
P4). Catherine’s story and dialogues evoked empathy from players,
such as P1 who felt sympathy for her past experiences and cur-
rent efforts to help others. Catherine’s connections with other char-
acters, such as David, demonstrated her emotional response and
worry for him, making her appear more emotional (Fig.4).
Figure 5: Screenshot of Catherine discussing her decision with a
public member
7.1.2. Engagement and Story Progression
Players were motivated to interact with Catherine, likely attributed
to the changes in her responses. P3 compared engaging with
Catherine and David to "reading a book or playing an RPG game,"
with daily story updates fostering a sense of involvement (Fig.5).
P8 found this progression fun and intriguing, while P7 appreciated
Catherine’s ability to respond to clues and images.
As the story unfolded, participants like P1 felt increasingly con-
nected to Catherine, who appeared more human-like over time.
Catherine’s dialogues evolved from neutral, information-based re-
sponses to those reflecting her personal struggles and experiences.
P1 noticed this transition, comparing it to Jerry’s static nature.
7.1.3. As a community chatbot
As a community chatbot, Catherine has richer and more com-
plex social interactions compared to dyadic chatbots. Players found
Catherine’s role as a community chatbot contributed to more
diverse and engaging social interactions within the community,
fostering both direct and indirect connections among members.
Catherine’s association with the community increased her presence
and vitality.
Catherine also facilitated indirect connections within the com-
munity. Some players mentioned other members’ responses, such
as P8 referring to P4 receiving a different answer from Catherine

or P5 mentioning P2 being “scolded" by Catherine in the Chinese
channel. These interactions, which would not occur in one-on-one
apps like Replika, provided richer social experiences and prevented
Catherine from being an isolated character (as noted by P7).
7.1.4. Limitations
Catherine’s storytelling abilities were recognized by players, such
as P1, who found her suitable for understanding DE’s core story.
However, her limitations were influenced by the focused story
background and objectives, as well as her fixed responses and story
control.
Despite her strong storytelling skills and empathy, Catherine’s
fixed responses and story control led to repetition and conflicting
content in her answers. For instance, P1 mentioned her illogical
responses, while P8 observed contradictions in her words. Accord-
ingly, P3 suggested using generative responses even if there is a
risk of going off-topic.
7.2. Discussion
Below, we discuss the themes that emerged from our analysis and
how they showcase the extent to which the design successfully cre-
ated a story experience through the chatbot.
7.2.0.1. Balancing Openness and Consistency in AI-driven
Character Design
Catherine excelled in storytelling aspects,
creating a compelling narrative that captivated users and deep-
ened their emotional connection with her. Her dynamic evolution
throughout the story and the challenges she faced resonated with
the players, fostering a sense of involvement and empathy. How-
ever, it is essential to recognize and address her limitations, such
as her strict adherence to the narrative and fixed responses, which
can detract from the user experience. This suggests that AI charac-
ter design should consider avoiding fixed responses to enhance user
experience, and design management systems for AI-generated con-
tent. Recent research [POC∗23] demonstrates possibilities in this
topic.
7.2.0.2. Fostering Emotional Connections and Developing Dis-
tinct Personalities Catherine’s emotional and engagement scores
were significantly higher than Jerry’s, partly due to her unique story
background and character traits. This suggests that emphasizing
emotions and distinct personality traits in AI character design can
lead to higher engagement. Additionally, incorporating the char-
acter’s autonomy and disobedience can pique users’ curiosity and
enhance their perception of the character’s personality.
7.2.0.3. Expanding on Complex Social Interactions and Rela-
tionships
Our findings highlight the importance of complex so-
cial interactions and relationships in narrative-driven AI characters,
such as defiance, connections with other characters, demonstrating
growth, and serving as a community glue. Future research could
explore more theoretical and practical approaches to interactions
with narrative-driven AI characters, which can be applied not only
to chatbots but also to game characters.
8. Limitations and future works
This study, as a cross-sectional research, presents several limita-
tions that need to be acknowledged and addressed. The small num-
ber of participants in this study may limit the generalizability of
our findings. Further research with larger and more diverse sam-
ples is needed to confirm and expand upon our results. We also aim
to explore gender-balanced communities.
Each community has unique characteristics, such as different
stories, audience demographics, and platform-coordinated interac-
tion methods. Future research should aim to explore more sys-
tematic and adaptable approaches for community storytelling. As
LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 [Ope] continue to evolve, we plan
to develop a more flexible system for story generation and story-
to-prompt configurations that can be easily customized for diverse
community contexts.
This study took place in November 2022 and February 2023
when the ChatGPT API was not yet available. However, the logic
for designing chatbots based on LLM is generalisable. We believe
that with the evolution of LLM, SSCs will demonstrate improved
performance in the future. As technology advances, it will be cru-
cial to revisit and reassess our findings in light of new developments
in AI and chatbot capabilities.
9. Conclusion
Our study demonstrates the potential of storytelling in enhancing
engagement and believability of social chatbots within commu-
nity settings, such as the DE gaming community. By employing
a story engineering workflow, we created two storytelling chatbots,
Catherine and David, which fostered emotional connections and
improved user experiences.
Future research should balance and manage LLM’s generated
ability while emphasizing emotions, distinct personality traits, and
complex social interactions. As AI technology advances, we can
explore adaptable approaches for community storytelling, ulti-
mately paving the way for more engaging and meaningful social
chatbots across various contexts.

David’s storyline
The main story of DE happened in Skuld City, an artificially created city that once served as a refuge from natural disasters
but now also shelters people. Dominated by Domain, a company that controls the Sunburn (a fictional common disease in the
story) curing technology and its market, the city is filled with towering buildings, neon signs, holographic ads, and prosthetic
people. David, a former employee of the pharmacy Institute "BioTech" under Domain, discovers the company is involved in
illegal operations involving mind control technology. He decides to run away, stealing a chip containing this technology. David
is saved by Dan, a doctor in the clinic, and his daughter Catherine, who later turns out to be under mind control by Dan,
the institute’s leader. David and Catherine infiltrate the institute together, facing various challenges until Gus, the founder of
BioTech, captures Dan and shuts down the mind control project. David and Catherine return to a relatively peaceful life in the
clinic, and removed the mind-control chip in Catherine’s brain, but in exchange, Domain threatens David to keep the entire
incident a secret.
David’s story ending
In the original ending, Dan was only controlled by another faction within BioTech; however, Gus Weiz’s appearance gave
us more reasonable and dramatic details to add. As such we included a section describing how Gus appeared and had his
subordinates restrain Dan while warning the protagonist (David) not to reveal any secrets here. Any other details that did not
significantly contribute to advancing the main plot were left out of the prompt.

Catherine’s storyline
Catherine’s story followed David’s. After removing a mind control chip from her brain, Catherine gradually regained her
childhood memories and hacking abilities. Her difficult past, including the loss of her parents to gangs, fueled her hatred
for oppressive forces like Domain. Catherine joined the underground organization Scarlet to fight back against the powerful
corporation. However, Domain threatened her to join Scarlet, adding more challenges to her path. Catherine overcame obstacles
and saved David by hacking Domain’s security with help from her allies and the support from a mysterious non-human hacker
in Domain.
