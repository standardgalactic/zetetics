Introduction
Intelligence may be narrowly defined as the capacity to acquire
knowledge and understanding, and use it in different novel situations.
It is this ability, or capacity, which enables the individual to deal with
real situations and profit intellectually from sensory experience.
A test of intelligence is designed to formally study, under test
conditions, the success of an individual in adapting to a specific
situation.
There are a number of different methods which purport to measure
intelligence, the most famous of which is the IQ, or intelligence
quotient test. In the formation of such tests many psychologists treat
intelligence as a general ability operating as a common factor in a wide
variety of aptitudes.
Whilst many IQ tests measure a variety of different types of ability
such as verbal, mathematical, spatial and reasoning skills, there is now
a second school of thought in which it is believed that the earlier
definitions of intelligence may be too simplistic.
It is now becoming increasingly recognised that there are many
different types of intelligence and that a high measured IQ, although
desirable, is not the only key to success in life. Other characteristics,
such as outstanding artistic, creative or practical prowess, especially
if combined with personal characteristics such as ambition, good
temperament and compassion, could result in an outstanding level of
success despite a low measured IQ. It is because of this that in recent
years CQ (creative quotient) and EQ (emotional quotient), to name
just two examples, have come to be regarded as equally important as,
or even more important than, IQ measurement.
1

It should also be pointed out that having a high IQ does not mean
that one has a good memory. A good memory is yet another type of
intelligence, and could result in high academic success despite a low
measured IQ test score.
The object of this book is to identify different types of intelligence
and bring together tests for different aspects of intelligence into one
book, and provide an objective assessment of abilities in a number of
different disciplines.
This will, therefore, give readers the opportunity to identify their
own strengths and weaknesses and thus enable readers to build on
their strengths and work at improving their performance in areas of
weakness.
As well as the identifying of such strengths and weaknesses, the
tests and exercises in this book perform another important function,
that of using and exercising the brain.
Despite the enormous capacity of the brain, we only use on average
2% of our potential brainpower. There is, therefore, the potential for
each of us to expand our brainpower considerably.
It is important that we continually use our brain, for example, the
more we practise at tests of verbal aptitude, the more we increase our
ability to understand the meaning of words and use them effectively;
the more we practise at mathematics, the more confident we become
when working with numbers; and the more we practise our ability to
move our fingers and manipulate small objects, the more dextrous we
become at operations involving this type of aptitude.
Our brain is undoubtedly our greatest asset, yet, for most of us, it
is the part of the body we most take for granted.
Our brain needs exercise and care in the same way as other parts
of the body. We eat the right foods to keep our heart healthy, we
moisturise our skin to keep it from drying out and, just as gymnasts
strive to increase their performance at whatever level they are
competing, by means of punishing training schedules and refinement
of technique, there are exercises, or mental gymnastics, we can do
to increase the performance of our brain and enhance quickness of
thought.

Many people still have the outdated belief that there is little they
can do to improve the brain they are born with and that brain cells
continually degenerate with age, but in fact our brain cells continually
develop new and stronger connections and adult brains can grow new
cells, irrespective of age.
We should all be aware that we have the capacity to put our brain
to even more use and unleash many hitherto untapped creative talents
by continually exploring new avenues, experiences and learning
adventures. By continually exploiting our enormous brain potential,
we all have the ability to make more and stronger connections
between our nerve cells, with the result that not only our mental but
also our physical long-term well-being will improve.
Whilst the aim of the tests and exercises is therefore two-fold,
that of identifying individual strengths and weaknesses and that of
exercising the brain, they are at the same time, and equally importantly,
designed to provide fun and entertainment to those who take them.
Aspects of intelligence
Although it is difficult to define intelligence, indeed it appears to have
no formal definition, there is, nevertheless, at least one particularly
apposite definition: the capacity to learn and understand.
Scores from standardised intelligence tests (IQ scores) are often
used to define one’s intelligence level. It is, however, becoming
increasingly accepted that they do not reveal the complete picture and
only provide a snapshot of a person’s ability in the area under
examination, so that, for example, someone who has scored highly on
a verbal test can only be said to have a high verbal IQ and someone
who has scored highly on a mathematical test can only be said to have
a high numerical IQ. Obviously, therefore, the more different types
of disciplines that are tested and examined, the more accurately the
intelligence level of the individual can be assessed.
Whilst IQ testing is broadly based on the principle of a measurable
and genetically inherited intelligence that is cast in stone for every
individual and does not increase throughout adulthood, there is
Introduction

now another school of thought which believes there are many more
different types of intelligences, some of which could be as a result of
our upbringing and development and some of which could be the
result of a natural talent with which we are born.
The concept of general intelligence, or g, was devised in the early
twentieth century by the English psychologist Charles Spearman, who
established g as a measure of performance in a variety of tests.
Spearman’s research led him to the conclusion that the same people
who performed well in a variety of mental tasks tended to use a part of
the brain that he termed g. The g factor, therefore, laid the foundation
for the concept of a single intelligence, and the belief that this single,
and measurable, intelligence enables us to perform tasks of mental
ability.
Recent studies have to a certain extent reinforced Spearman’s theory,
and research has found that the lateral prefrontal cortex is the only area
of the brain where an increase in blood flow takes place when volunteers
tackle complicated puzzles.
Despite this, Spearman’s concept remains highly controversial and
is becoming increasingly challenged by those who claim that the concept
of a single overall intelligence is too simplistic.
At the same time, there is a body of research whose findings suggest
that our mental ability is not determined by biological inheritance, but
as the result of social factors such as education and upbringing.
Whilst IQ tests are, and will remain, helpful in predicting future
performance or potential in many areas, they do not provide us
with other information, such as the ability to connect with other
people emotionally or perform creative tasks that involve the use of
imagination.
Although most IQ testing only assesses what is termed ‘general
ability’ in three categories of intelligence, numerical, verbal and spatial
(abstract) reasoning, there are several other equally important and
valuable intelligences that need to be recognised and developed.
The theory of multiple intelligence (MI) advocates that the traditional
view of a single general intelligence, g, is too narrow and that humans
have multiple intelligences. By expanding our definition of intelligence
The Complete Book of Intelligence Tests

to include multiple intelligences, we can identify, appreciate and
nurture more of our strengths.
This is important, as it would be as rare for any one individual to
be endowed in all the different intelligences as it would for any one
individual not to possess some kind of talent. We all tend to be aware
of some of our abilities and limitations, for instance, some of us may
be great musicians but completely hopeless when it comes to fixing a
problem with our car; others may be championship-class chess players
but would never be able to smash a tennis ball into the opposing
player’s court; and others may possess great linguistic and mathematical
skills but feel completely at a loss trying to make small talk at social
gatherings. The fact is that no-one is talented in every domain and no-
one is completely incapable in every domain.
The originator of the theory of multiple intelligences, Howard
Gardner, a professor of education at Harvard University, defines
intelligence as the potential ability to process a certain sort of infor-
mation. The different types of intelligence are for the most part
independent of one another, and no type is more important than the
other.
In all, Gardner identifies seven different types of intelligence.
These can be summarized as follows:
1. Verbal=linguistic, e.g. lexical skills, formal speech, verbal debate,
creative writing.
2. Body=kinesthetic (movement), e.g. body language, physical gestures,
creative dance, physical exercise, drama.
3. Musical=rhythmic,
e.g.
music
performance,
singing,
musical
composition, rhythmic patterns.
4. Logic=mathematic, e.g. numerical aptitude, problem solving,
deciphering codes, abstract symbols and formulae.
5. Visual=spatial, e.g. patterns and designs, painting, drawing, active
imagination, sculpture, colour schemes.
6. Interpersonal (relationships with others),
e.g.
person-to-person
communication, empathy practices, group projects, collaboration
skills, receiving and giving feedback.

7. Intrapersonal (self-understanding and insight), e.g. thinking strategies,
emotional processing, knowing yourself, higher order reasoning,
focusing=concentration.
Although aspects of it are included in several of the above categories;
in addition to the above seven basic types of intelligence can be
added creativity, which has sometimes been referred to as ‘the eighth
intelligence’.
Additionally, if creativity is the eighth intelligence, then memory
must be the ninth, and both creativity and memory are explored and
tested in detail in Chapters 4 and 6, respectively.
Whilst Spearman concluded that people who performed well at
varying tasks tended to use the same part of the brain, g, Gardner
asserts that each of the above intelligences is located in one or more
particular areas of the brain. Some of the evidence for this belief is
provided by the study of people who have suffered brain damage,
either from strokes or other causes, and who may, for example, still be
able to sing words despite having lost the ability to use expressive
speech.
Although the jury may still be out on the debate as to whether the
g factor, as gauged by IQ tests, is just one single general intelligence,
or whether there are, as Gardner and others suggest, a set of
independent mental domains, it would appear to be coming increasingly
apparent that, as we learn more about the human brain and how
different parts of the brain appear to generate different intelligences,
the more compelling Gardner’s theory becomes.
The main lesson to be learned from this is that people can be
intelligent in many different ways. It is completely wrong to write off
or even put down someone who has scored badly in an IQ test which,
after all, has only provided us with one type of information about that
individual. All of us have the potential for achievement in some kind
of intelligence and we also possess the potential for improvement in
many other areas.
Although there are types of intelligence that cannot be tested in a
book, for example, aptitude at performing physical tasks or playing a

musical instrument, in the chapters that follow as many different
types of intelligence will be tested and explored as is feasible to do.
Intelligence quotient (IQ)
Intelligence quotient (IQ) is an age-related measure of intelligence
level and is described as 100 times the mental age. The word ‘quotient’
means the result of dividing one quantity by another, and a definition
of intelligence is mental ability or quickness of mind.
Such tests are based on the belief that every person possesses a single
general ability of mind. It is this which determines how efficiently each
of us deals with situations as they arise, and how we profit intellectually
from our experiences. This ability of mind varies in amount from person
to person, and is what intelligence (IQ tests) attempt to measure.
Generally such tests consist of a graded series of tasks, each of
which has been standardised with a large representative population of
individuals. Such a procedure establishes the average IQ as 100.
IQ tests are part of what is generally referred to as ‘psychometric
testing’. Such test content may be addressed to almost any aspect of
our intellectual or emotional make-up, including personality, attitude
and intelligence.
Psychometric tests are basically tools used for measuring the mind;
the word ‘metric’ means measure and the word ‘psycho’ means mind.
There are two types of psychometric test, which are usually used in
tandem. These are aptitude tests, which assess your abilities, and personality
questionnaires, which assess your character and personality.
In contrast to specific proficiencies, intelligence tests are standard
examinations devised to measure human intelligence as distinct from
attainments. There are several different types of intelligence test, for
example, Cattell, Stanford^Binet and Wechsler, each having its own
different scale of intelligence.
The Stanford^Binet is heavily weighted with questions involving
verbal abilities and is widely used in the United States of America, and
the Weschler scales consist of two separate verbal and performance
sub-scales, each with its own IQ rating.
Introduction

It is generally agreed by advocates of IQ testing that an
individual’s IQ rating is mainly hereditary and remains constant in
development to about the age of 13, after which it is shown to slow
down, and beyond the age of 18 little or no improvement is found. It
is further agreed that the most marked increase in a person’s IQ takes
place in early childhood, and theories are continually put forward
about different contributory factors, for example, it has been claimed
recently, following research in Japan, that the playing of computer
games by children, which involve a high degree of skill and agility of
mind, have resulted in higher IQ measurement.
IQ Tests are standardised after being given to many thousands of
people and an average IQ (100) established, a score above or below
this norm being used to establish the subject’s actual IQ rating.

Because beyond the age of 18 little or no improvement in a person’s
IQ rating is found, the method of calculating the IQ of a child is
different to the method used for an adult.
When measuring the IQ of a child, the subject will attempt an IQ
test which has been standardized with an average score recorded for
each age group. Thus, a child aged 10 years who scored the results
expected of a child of 12 would have an IQ of 120, calculated as
follows:
mental age (12)
chronological age (10)
 100 ¼ 120 IQ
However, adults have to be judged on an IQ test whose average
score is 100 and their results graded above and below this norm
according to known scores. A properly validated test would have to
The Complete Book of Intelligence Tests
8

be given to some 20,000 people and the results correlated before it
would reveal an accurate measurement of a person’s IQ.
Like most distributions found in nature, the distribution of IQ
takes the form of a fairly regular bell-curve (see diagram above). On
the Stanford^Binet scale, half the population fall between 90 and 110
IQ, half of them above 100 and half of them below; 25% score above
110; 11% above 120; 3% above 130 and 0.6% above 140. At the other
end of the scale the same kind of proportion occurs.
The earliest known attempts to rank people in terms of intelligence
date back to the Chinese Mandarin system, circa 500 B.C., when studying
the works of Confucius enabled successful candidates to enter the public
service. The top 1% of candidates were successful in progressing to the
next stage, where they would again be run off against each other, and
the procedure repeated yet again through a final layer of selection.
Thus, the chosen candidates were in the top 1% of the top 1% of the
top 1%.
The first attempt to measure scientifically the difference between
the mental abilities of individuals was made by Sir Francis Galton in
the nineteenth century, when he tried to show that the human mind
could be systematically mapped into different dimensions.
The first modern intelligence test was devised in 1905 by the
French psychologists Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon after they
were commissioned by the French government to construct tests that
would ensure no child be denied admittance to the Paris school system
without formal examination. The pair developed a 30-item test, which
included a wide range of different types of problems.
In 1916, the American psychologist Lewis Terman revised the
Binet^Simon scale to provide comparison standards for Americans
from age 3 to adulthood and the concept of the ratio of the mental age
to chronological age, multiplied by 100, was added. Terman devised the
term ‘intelligence quotient’ and developed the Stanford^Binet intelligence
test to measure IQ after joining the faculty of Stanford University as
professor of education. The Stanford^Binet test was further revised in
1937 and 1960 and remains today one of the most widely used of all
intelligence tests.
Introduction
9

In the mid-nineteenth century psychologists used information-
loaded tests to assess the intelligence of their clients. Later, psychologists
introduced the concept of mental speed when assessing performance.
Around 1930, Furneaux demonstrated that a relationship did exist
between power, meaning the absolute difficulty of a problem, and
speed, meaning the time a person required to solve it. By increasing
the difficulty by 30%, you double the time required to solve it, but a
60% increase will lengthen the time five-fold.
The first IQ testing on a mass scale was carried out by the US
army during the First World War. Personality tests or character tests
soon followed, but in the 1920s and 1930s studies began to define
more closely the general concept of intelligence. What emerged was
recognition of fluid and crystallised intelligence. Fluid intelligence was
measured by references to spatial items, such as diagrams, drawings or
pegs, and crystallised intelligence was measured through language and
number.
There are many different types of intelligence tests; however, a
typical IQ test might consist of three sections, each testing a different
ability, usually comprising verbal reasoning, numerical ability and
diagrammatic, or spatial, reasoning. In order to assess your overall
general ability, the questions in the test that follows are multi-discipline
and include a mix of verbal, numerical and diagrammatic questions,
as well as additional questions involving logical thought processes
together with a degree of lateral thinking.
While it is accepted that IQ is hereditary and remains constant
throughout life and, therefore, it is not possible to improve your
actual IQ, one weakness of this type of testing is that it is possible
to improve your performance on IQ tests by practising the many
different types of question, and learning to recognise the recurring
themes.
In subsequent chapters of this book, readers will have ample
opportunity to test themselves in different areas of brain activity and
to identify their strengths and weakness in specific areas of intelligence.
It must be emphasised that a person who is good at IQ tests is not
necessarily capable of excelling at academic tests, regardless of how
The Complete Book of Intelligence Tests
10

logical and quick-witted he=she is. Often motivation and dedication
are more important than a high measured IQ rating. To score highly
on an academic test requires the ability to concentrate on a single
subject, obtain an understanding of it, and revise solidly in order to
memorise facts prior to an examination. Often it is difficult for
someone with a high IQ to do this because of an overactive and
enquiring mind, which cannot direct itself on one subject for very
long and forever wishes to diversify. Such a person would have to
apply a high level of self-discipline in order to succeed at academic
tests but, if able to apply this self-discipline, would be likely to obtain
a high pass mark.
Because the test that follows has been newly compiled for this
book, it has not been standardised, so an actual IQ assessment cannot
be given. Nevertheless, a guide to assessing your performance is
provided in the Answers section.
A time limit of 90 minutes is allowed for completing all 40
questions. The correct answers are given at the end of the test, and
you should award yourself one point for each completely correct
answer. You should not exceed the time limit, otherwise your score
will be invalidated.
Where preferred, the use of a calculator is permitted on numerical
questions, except where indicated.

Specific aptitude
tests
In the somewhat complex area of psychometric testing, the
terminology and procedures involved are sometimes misunderstood
or misinterpreted.
The word ‘aptitude’ is often misused to mean ability or achievement,
and in the context of psychometric testing aptitude may be regarded
as just another way of referring to specific ability. There is, however,
a subtle technical difference between the three words ‘achievement’,
‘ability’ and ‘aptitude’, which can be distinguished as follows:
Achievement ^ what you have accomplished in the past.
Ability ^ what you are able to demonstrate in the present.
Aptitude ^ how quickly or easily you will be able to learn in the
future.
Psychometric tests can be broadly divided into two main categories:
1. Tests of maximum performance, such as ability or aptitude.
2. Tests of typical performance, such as personality or interest.
An ability test is designed to measure maximum performance and
potential in a number of areas. These abilities can be measured
separately, or combined to give an assessment of overall general
ability. Often tests are constructed so that they relate to a specific
job or skill and assess things such as perceptual speed or mechanical
reasoning.
Examples of ability tests are; general intelligence tests (IQ tests),
knowledge-based attainment tests and aptitude tests, which test the
ability to use knowledge.
25

Ability is a very general term which can be applied to many
different types of specific ability. There are, in fact, over 50 different
human abilities, although these fall within the following four main
categories:
1. Cognitive reasoning ^ verbal, numerical, abstract, perceptual, spatial,
mechanical. A very broad and general definition of the word
‘cognition’ is: knowing, perceiving and thinking. It is studied by
psychologists because it reveals the extent of a person’s ability to
think.
2. Psychomotor ^ eye and hand coordination.
3. Sensory ^ hearing, touch, sense, smell, sight.
4. Physical ^ stamina and strength.
There are nine different types of aptitude, which may be summarised
as follows:
1. General learning ^ learn and understand, reason and make judgements,
e.g. how well we achieve at school.
2. Verbal aptitude ^ general lexical skills; understanding words and
using them effectively.
3. Numerical aptitude ^ general mathematical skills; working with
numbers quickly and accurately.
4. Spatial aptitude ^ understanding geometric forms; the understanding
and identification of patterns and their meaning, e.g. understanding
how to construct a flat-pack piece of furniture from a set of
instructions.
5. Form perception ^ studying and perceiving details in objects and=or
graphic material. Making visual comparisons between shapes, e.g.
inspecting an object under a microscope in a laboratory; quality
inspection of goods in a factory.
6. Clerical perception ^ reading, analysing and obtaining details from
written data or tabulated material, e.g. proof reading, analysing
reports.
7. Motor coordination ^ eye and hand coordination. Making rapid
movement response quickly and accurately, e.g. actually being
The Complete Book of Intelligence Tests
26

able to assemble the flat pack piece of furniture once you have
understood how it should be done; being able to operate a
keyboard quickly and accurately; sporting skills.
8. Finger dexterity ^ manipulating small objects quickly and accurately,
e.g. playing a piano, sewing.
9. Manual dexterity ^ the skill of being able to work with your hands,
e.g. painting and decorating, building things, operating machinery.
In the case of most aptitude tests there is usually a set time limit
which must be strictly adhered to in order for the test to be valid, and
there is usually an average score which has been standardised in
comparison with a group of people who have taken the same test.
When taken under these conditions there may be up to five levels
of test performance expressed in percentage terms in comparison with
the average score established:
1. Top 10% of population ^ extremely high degree of aptitude.
2. Top one-third (excluding top 10%) ^ high degree of aptitude.
3. A score obtained by one-third of the population ^ average degree of
aptitude.
4. Lowest one-third ^ below average.
5. Lowest 10% ^ minimal aptitude.
The tests that follow are divided into three main sections: verbal
aptitude, numerical aptitude and technical aptitude. Several spatial
aptitude tests are included in subsequent chapters, specifically Chapter 3
(Logical reasoning) and Chapter 4 (Creativity).
Because they have been newly compiled for this book, the tests
have not been standardised in comparison to scores obtained by other
groups. Nevertheless there is a guide to assessing your performance at
the end of each test, and because the tests relate to specific aptitudes,
the results will give you the opportunity to identify your own particular
strengths and weaknesses.
Unless stated otherwise, you should award yourself one point for
each completely correct answer.
Specific aptitude tests
27

Section I ^ Verbal aptitude
Mastery of words is seen by many as having in one’s possession the
ability to produce order out of chaos and because of this it is argued
that command of vocabulary is seen as a true measure of intelligence,
with the result that verbal tests are widely used in IQ testing.
Verbal reasoning tests are designed to measure basic verbal ability
(the ability to understand and use words), and typically include
spelling, grammar, word meanings, completing sentences, synonyms
and antonyms.
The exercises that follow test basic verbal aptitude in a number of
separate areas including synonyms, antonyms, analogy, odd one out
and verbal comprehension. There are also two advanced tests, one of
which is multi-discipline and one which is anagram-based.
For each test a performance assessment is provided. There is also a
time limit specified for completing each test, which should not be
exceeded otherwise your score will be invalidated.

Section II ^ Numerical aptitude
We all require some numerical skills in our lives, whether it is to
calculate our weekly shopping bill or to budget how to use our monthly
income.
Numerical ability tests are designed to assess how well a person can
reason with numbers. Questions within these tests may involve either
straightforward mathematical calculation, or problems that require the
application of logical thought processes.
In the case of numerical problem solving, the actual mathematical
process involved may be quite basic; however, you are being assessed
on your ability to apply your basic mathematical knowledge in order
to correctly solve the problem as quickly as possible, and your ability
to deal with problems in a structured and analytical way.
Numerical questions are widely used in IQ testing and, as numbers
are international, numerical tests are regarded as being culture-fair or
culture-free, so that they are free of any particular cultural bias and no
advantage is derived by individuals of one culture relative to those of
another.
Individual tests include mental arithmetic, number sequences and
logical reasoning, all designed to test a person’s aptitude=ability at
mathematical calculation, identifying number patterns and the ability
to reason with numbers.
Test 2.11
Number sequence test
In a numerical sequence test it is necessary to identify a pattern that
is occurring in the sequence. The numbers in the sequence may be
progressing, or they may be decreasing, and in some cases they may be
both progressing and decreasing within the sequence. It is up to you
to determine why this is occurring and to either continue the sequence
or to provide a missing number within the sequence.
Fill in the missing number(s) indicated by the question mark(s) in
each question.

Test 2.12
Mental arithmetic
It is evident that mental arithmetic is not practised in today’s education
system to the extent that it was several years ago, when children would
learn their multiplication tables so well off by heart that they could
give the answer to sums such as 9 multiplied by 8 or 6 multiplied by 7
almost without thinking. Perhaps this is not completely surprising in
view of the widespread use of calculators and computers; nevertheless,
proficiency at mental arithmetic is a valuable asset to have at one’s
disposal and it is also an excellent way of exercising the brain.
The following is a mental arithmetic speed test of 30 questions,
which gradually increase in difficulty as the test progresses. You should
work quickly and calmly and try to think at all times of the quickest and
most efficient way of tackling the questions.
You have 45 minutes in which to solve the 30 questions.
The use of a calculator is not permitted in this test and only the
answer should be committed to paper, the object of the test being that
all the working out is done in your head.

Section III ^ Technical aptitude
With the explosion of information technology, technical aptitude testing
is becoming increasingly more important, as people with a higher
scientific and technical aptitude have the potential to master technology
much more effectively than someone with a lower technical aptitude.
Employing job candidates who have displayed a high level of technical
aptitude in technology-oriented jobs is, therefore, considerably more
cost-effective, in terms of both training and efficiency of performance,
in carrying out the job at the desired level.
As new technology continues to emerge and develop, it is
important to employers that they have the means at their disposal to
identify candidates who are able to learn these new technologies quickly
and are able to apply these skills in order to solve complex problems in
their jobs.

Logical reasoning
The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as ‘the science of
reasoning, proof, thinking or inference’.
In philosophy, logic (from the Greek logos, meaning word, speech
or reason) is a science that deals with the principles of valid reasoning
and argument. In this context, logic concerns only the reasoning
process and not necessarily the end result. Thus, incorrect conclusions
can be reached by so-called ‘faulty’ means if the original assumptions
are faulty. There are many kinds of logic, such as fuzzy logic and
constructive logic, which have different rules and different strengths
and weaknesses.
A further definition of ‘logical’ is analytical or deductive, and this
definition can be applied to someone who is capable of reasoning, or
using reason, in an orderly, cogent fashion.
It is this latter definition with which we are concerned in this
chapter and all the questions can be solved using this type of thinking
process. There is no specialised knowledge required in order to
solve them, just an ability to think clearly and analytically and follow
a common-sense reasoning process step by step through to its
conclusion.
Test 3.1
Pure logic
Test 1 consists of 10 questions of varying scope and difficulty. There
is no specialised knowledge of mathematics or vocabulary required
in order to solve these questions, just the ability to think clearly and
analytically.

correct missing square from a number of options. It is therefore
necessary to study the matrix to decide what pattern is occurring,
either by looking across each line and down each column, looking at
the array as a whole or looking at the relationship between different
squares within the array.
The test that follows consists of 10 questions which gradually
increase in difficulty as the test progresses, first starting with 2  2
arrays, then 3  3 arrays and finally 4  4 arrays. The tests also call for
a degree of creative thinking, in which you must apply your mind to
each set of diagrams in order to appreciate the patterns and sequences
that are occurring.

Creativity
In the creative state a man is taken out of himself. He lets down
as it were a bucket into his subconscious and draws up something
which is normally beyond his reach. He mixes this thing with
his normal experiences and out of the mixture he makes a work
of art.
E. M. Forster
The term ‘creativity’ refers to mental processes that lead to solutions,
ideas, concepts, artistic forms, theories or products that are unique or
novel. It has sometimes been referred to as ‘the eighth intelligence’.
In this chapter there will be an opportunity not only to explore your
creative talents and potential in general, but also the specific creative
thought processes of imagination, lateral thinking and problem solving.
As a result of work carried out in the 1960s by the American
neurologist Roger Wolcott Sperry (1913^1994), it became apparent
that the creative functions of human beings are controlled by the right-
hand hemisphere of the human brain. This is the side of the brain which
is under-used by the majority of people, as opposed to the thought
processes of the left-hand hemisphere, which is characterised by order,
sequence and logic; and is responsible for such functions as numerical
and verbal skills.
Sperry shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine
for his split-brain research, which serves as the basis for our current
understanding of cerebral specialisation in the human brain. From the
1960s his work with human patients proved to be of major significance
in the development of neurobiology and psychobiology. He published
84

his ground-breaking discovery of two separately functioning hemi-
spheres of the brain in 1968.
Thanks to people such as Sperry, in the second half of the twentieth
century we have become much more aware of the importance of the
human brain, its functioning and its relationship to our body; in fact
we have learned more about the brain in the past decade or so than in
all of the previous centuries, and one area in which we have obtained a
much greater understanding concerns the specialisation of the cerebral
hemispheres.
Throughout history it has been accepted that human beings are
all different in their own way; in other words, each one of us is an
individual with his=her own physical make-up, fingerprints, DNA,
facial features, character and personality. These characteristics have
always been analysed and categorised, but it was not until the mid-
twentieth century that it was realised that each one of us has two
sides to his=her brain, each of which have quite different functions and
characteristics.
In the 1960s, Roger Sperry, Michael Gazzanniga and Joseph
Bogan began a series of ground-breaking experiments that seemed to
indicate certain types of thinking were related to certain parts of the
brain.
Research, begun in the 1950s, had found that the cerebral cortex
has two halves, called hemispheres, which are almost identical. These
two brain hemispheres are connected by a bridge, or interface, of
millions of nerve fibres called the corpus callosum, which allows them
to communicate with each other. The left side of the brain connects to
the right side of the body, while the right side of the brain connects
to the left side.
In order to work to its full potential, each of these hemispheres
must be capable of analysing its own input first, only exchanging
information with the other half, by means of the interface, when a
considerable amount of processing has taken place.
Because both hemispheres are capable of working independently,
human beings are able to process two streams of information at once.
The brain then compares and integrates the information to obtain
Creativity
85

a broader and more in-depth understanding of the concept under
examination.
In the early 1960s, Sperry and his team showed by a series of
experiments, first using animals whose corpus callosum had been
severed, and then on human patients whose corpus callosum had
been severed in an attempt to cure epilepsy, that each of the two
hemispheres has developed specialised functions and has its own
private sensations, perceptions, ideas and thoughts, all separate from
the opposite hemisphere.
As their experiments continued, Sperry and his team were able to
reveal much more about how the two hemispheres were specialised
to perform different tasks. The left side of the brain is analytical and
functions in a sequential and logical fashion and is the side which
controls language, academic studies and rationality. The right side is
creative and intuitive and leads, for example, to the birth of ideas for
works of art and music.
The contrasting right- and left-hemisphere functions, sometimes
referred to as ‘laterality’, can be summarised as follows:

The meaning of the word ‘lateral’ is of or relating to the side, away
from the median axis. The term ‘laterality’ ^ or ‘sidedness’ ^ is used to
The Complete Book of Intelligence Tests
86

refer to any one of a number of preferences for one side of the body
to another. Probably the most common example of this, and one to
which we can all relate, is whether a person is left- or right-handed. In
recent years the term ‘laterality’ has come to be used very much to
characterise the asymmetry of the hemispheres of the brain with regard
to specific cognitive functions, as demonstrated by the list above.
While some individuals may be heavily weighted towards a
particular hemisphere, this does not mean they are predominant in
every one of that particular hemisphere’s skills, since no-one is entirely
left- or right-brained, e.g. while some individuals may have a strong
overall bias towards left-side brain dominance, it may be that they still
under-perform on, for instance numerical tests, and therefore need to
work at that particular skill.
There is also always going to be an overlap between certain brain
functions of opposing hemispheres, e.g. functions using logical processes
and lateral thinking processes, where one is a predominantly right-brain
function and the other is a predominantly left-brain function. However,
when logical processes are being used, the right brain does not switch off
and vice versa. On the contrary, both of these brain processes work much
more effectively when both sides of the brain are working together.
The importance to each of us of accessing both hemispheres of the
brain is considerable. In order to support the whole brain function,
logic and intuition, to give just two examples, are equally important.
Before the subconscious of the right-hand hemisphere can function, it
needs the fuel, or data, that has been fed into, collated and processed by
the left-hand hemisphere. One danger is the overburdening of the left-
hand hemisphere with too much data, and too quickly, to the extent that
the creative side of the brain is unable to function to its full potential.
On the other hand, lack of data fed into the left-hand hemisphere
could result in the creative side, or right hemisphere, ‘drying up’. It is
therefore desirable to strike the right balance between right and left
hemispheres in order for the brain to work to its full potential.
Because it is under-used, much creative talent in many people remains
untapped throughout life. Until we try, most of us never know what
we can actually achieve. We all have a creative side to our brain,
Creativity
87

therefore we should all have the potential to be creative. However,
because of the pressures of modern living and the need for specialisation
in order to develop a successful career, many of us never have the
time or opportunity, or indeed are never given the encouragement, to
explore our latent talents, even though most of us have sufficient
ammunition to realise this potential in the form of data which has been
fed into, collated and processed by the brain during our lifetime.
Like many other tasks, or pleasures, we never know what we
can achieve until we try. Having then tried, we instinctively know
whether we find it enjoyable or whether we have a talent or flair for it.
Then, if these signs are positive, we must persevere. By cultivating
new leisure activities and pursuing new pastimes, it is possible for each
of us to explore the potential and often vastly under-used parts of the
human brain.

Section I ^ Imagination
Imagination is more important than knowledge. For while
knowledge defines all we currently know and understand,
imagination points to all we might discover and create.
Albert Einstein
Imagination is the process of recombining memories of past
experiences and images into novel constructions. Thus, imagination is
both creative and constructive, it can be either wishful or realistic,
involve future plans, or be merely a mental review of the past.
Imagination, perception and memory are essentially similar mental
processes and can each be defined as follows:
Imagination ^ the conscious mental process of invoking ideas or
images of objects and events.
Perception ^ the conscious integration of sensory impressions of
external objects and events, including how we perceive others and
Creativity
91

how others perceive us. It also envelopes how we perceive the
world as a whole ^ the big picture ^ and how we perceive different
scenarios and situations that appear within the big picture.
Memory (the ‘ninth intelligence’) ^ the mental evocation of past
experiences.
One important aspect of perception is the ability to see more than
one point of view. If, for example, you look at the two drawings
below, at first glance what you see appears to be quite unambiguous:
However, if you continue to stare at each figure in turn, and keep
your attention on it focused, then the orientation suddenly shifts and
you find yourself looking at a quite different figure from what you
first imagined.
These two figures, therefore, illustrate the importance of perception.
Two different viewpoints appear ^ yet they are both correct. If anything,
this teaches us that we should endeavour to see both viewpoints, and
both sides of an argument.
Now look at the figure below. What do you see?
The Complete Book of Intelligence Tests
92

Most people will say that the figure is the letter E. If, however, they
look closely they will see that there is no letter E, just three sets of
lines. It is because our mind is conditioned to what it believes it wants
to see, i.e. the image of the most common letter of the alphabet, which
it has seen many thousands of times, that it completes the object for
you and makes you come to the conclusion that you perceive
something that in reality does not exist.
Now read the following paragraph:
I cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was
rdgnieg. The phaonmneal pweor of the hmuan mnid Aoccdrnig
to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in

bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but
the wrod as a wlohe.
Again, our mind has taken over. It knows from past experience what
it wants to see, and as a result the task of reading what, at first, appears
be a load of mumbo-jumbo is surprisingly easy.
The following tests are all designed to test your powers of
imagination and creativity.

Section II ^ Lateral thinking
The term ‘lateral thinking’ was originated by its creator and pioneer,
Dr Edward de Bono, and is a systematic way of approaching creative
thinking.
The word ‘lateral’ means of or relating to either side, away from
the median axis. Lateral thinking is a method of seeking to solve
problems by unique and different ways, by attempting to look at that
problem from many angles rather than searching for a direct head-on
solution.
It therefore involves the need to think outside the box and develop
a degree of creative, innovative thinking, which seeks to change our
natural and traditional perceptions, concepts and ideas. By developing
this type of thinking, we greatly increase our ability to solve problems
facing us that we could not otherwise solve.
To solve all the questions that appear in this section, it is necessary
to think laterally and creatively and to look for solutions that may not
seem apparent on first inspection.
Test 4.5
Lateral thinking test
This test consists of 10 puzzles, all designed to exercise powers of
lateral thinking and encourage creative thought in seeking out
sometimes unexpected solutions.
For those readers wishing to assess their performance against the
clock, there is a time limit of 90 minutes allowed for completing all 10
questions.
The Complete Book of Intelligence Tests
102

If, however, you prefer simply to dip into these questions at
random and attempt which ever one takes your fancy at the time, it
is suggested that, if you do not find a solution immediately, you do
not rush to look up the answer but instead return to the question
sometime later, as a puzzle that may baffle you at first may become
soluble when you take a fresh look. It is possible that your mind has
been subconsciously working on the problem and that the answer
which previously eluded you may suddenly become apparent.

Section III ^ Problem solving
In psychology, a ‘problem’ is defined as a situation in which some of
the components are already known and additional components must
then be ascertained or determined, and ‘problem solving’ is broadly all
the processes involved in the solution of that problem.
There are several problem-solving techniques which have been put
into practice over the years, such as brainstorming, critical path analysis
and SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats), which in
their own way have often proved successful.
In brainstorming techniques, for example, the object is for groups or
individuals to break away from conventional and habitual ways of
thinking and to generate fresh ideas, which can then be evaluated and
the most effective ways selected. Brainstorming is therefore a method
of searching for, and developing, creative solutions to a problem by

108

focusing on the problem and deliberately encouraging the participants
to come up with as many unusual and creative solutions as possible.
The French mathematicians Poincare¤ and Hadamard defined the
following four stages of creativity:
1. Preparation: The attempt to solve a problem by normal means.
2. Incubation: When you feel frustrated that the above methods have
not worked and as a result you move away to other things.
3. Illumination: Eureka!! The answer suddenly comes to you in a
flash via your subconscious.
4. Verification: Your reasoning powers take over as you analyse the
answer which has come to you and assess its feasibility.
Of course, there are other problems which can be solved by using
what is often referred to as ‘common sense’. Common sense is the
almost forgotten tenth type of intelligence, and can hold the key to
solving many real-life problems. Take, for instance, the following
scenario:
A motorist encounters a shepherd and his dog with a flock of
sheep travelling in the same direction on a narrow lane, and finds
there is no room to drive through. The shepherd regards the
motorist as a nuisance and wants rid of him, as the dog is
barking and the sheep are disturbed, and the motorist regards
the sheep as a nuisance because he cannot continue his journey.
How is the situation resolved amicably to the satisfaction of both
the motorist and the shepherd?
You may be forgiven for thinking there appears to be no easy way
of solving this problem. However, this need not be the case with
the application of a degree of common sense. Consider, therefore, the
following solution which was reached to the entire satisfaction of both
parties and with the very minimum of inconvenience:
The car stops and the shepherd and his dog drive the sheep
back along the lane for a few yards past the car. When all the

sheep and the dog are to the rear of the car, the way is then clear
for the motorist to continue his journey, and the shepherd is also
free to continue his journey unhindered.

Problem-solving exercises
The puzzles in this section are not timed and an assessment is not
provided. They are included purely as problem-solving exercises in
finding creative solutions.
As in the case of similar tests in this book, it is suggested that,
should you not find a solution immediately, you do not rush to look
up the answer but instead return to the question some time later;
perhaps even on several occasions.

piece of paper is written the word ‘death’ and on the other is

emperor’s wife, manages to whisper that both pieces of paper say
‘death’. Despite this, the gladiator still wins his freedom. How?

Emotional
Intelligence
Emotional intelligence, more commonly referred to as emotional
quotient (EQ), is the ability to be aware of, control and manage one’s
own emotions and those of other people. The two main aspects of EQ
are:
* Understanding yourself, your goals, aspirations, responses and
behaviour.
* Understanding others and their feelings.
The concept of emotional intelligence was developed in the mid-
1990s by Daniel Goldman, coming to prominence with his 1995
book Emotional Intelligence. The early emotional intelligence theory
was originally developed in the USA during the 1970s and 1980s by
the work and writings of Howard Gardner of Harvard University,
Peter Salovy (Yale) and John Mayer (New Hampshire).
The EQ concept argues that IQ, which has tended to be the
traditional measure of intelligence, is too narrow and that there are
wider areas of emotional intelligence, such as behavioural and character
elements, that help to dictate how successful we are. It is because of
this that emotional intelligence, in addition to aptitude testing, is now
an important part of recruitment interviewing and selection procedures.
Although scoring highly in an aptitude test may impress a
prospective employer, it does not reveal the full story, as it does not
automatically follow that the applicant will be suited to the position
for which they are applying. While they may be intellectually qualified
to do the actual job, it may be they do not actually enjoy many aspects
of the work involved or will not fit into a team, as a result of which
they would be very likely to under-perform.
114

To prevent such a mismatch occurring, personality profiling tests
are becoming increasingly common as part of the job interview process.
Such tests measure personality traits, e.g. how you relate to other
people; how you relate to emotions, both your own and those of your
colleagues; how you respond to stressful situations; or what motivates
you.
In general, the term ‘personality’ refers to the patterns of thought,
feeling and behaviour that are unique in every one of us, and these are
the characteristics that distinguish us from other people. Our personality
thus implies the predictability of how we are likely to act or react
under different circumstances, although in reality nothing is quite that
simple and our reactions to situations are never entirely predictable.
Goldman summarized the five EQ domains as:
1. Knowing your emotions.
2. Managing your emotions.
3. Motivating yourself.
4. Recognising and understanding other people’s emotions.
5. Managing relationships, i.e. managing the emotions of others.
It is now widely recognised that if someone is deemed intellectually
intelligent, it does not necessarily follow they are also emotionally
intelligent, and possessing a high IQ rating does not mean that success
will automatically follow.
Being intellectually brilliant does not mean that persons are able to
relate to other people socially, neither does it mean they are capable of
managing their own emotions or able to motivate themselves.
The following questionnaires are designed to test different aspects
of your personality. The procedure for completing each of these is to
answer the questions as truthfully and as realistically as possible; in
other words, be true to yourself at all times in order to obtain the most
accurate assessment.
There is no need to read through these tests first before attempting
them: just answer intuitively and without too much consideration.
There are no right or wrong answers and, although you should work
as quickly as possible, there is no set time limit.

Assessment
Total score 90–125
Your score indicates that you are of a somewhat overly anxious nature
who finds it very difficult to relax completely, and you are constantly
The Complete Book of Intelligence Tests
118

on your toes for any unforeseen event that may occur. You also have
the tendency to build many things up in your own mind out of all
proportion.
As this is in your nature and possibly the way by which you deal
with things and cope with pressure, it is nevertheless important to try
and adopt a more relaxed attitude to life, since anxiety does lead to
stress and stress is the cause of many serious health problems.
It is necessary sometimes for overly anxious people to make a
concerted effort to relax more, and one way of doing this may be by
cultivating new interests and by taking one step back and reflecting on
their life and its positive aspects.
In times of extreme anxiety, it may be necessary to try and
temporarily switch off completely from your daily routine and try to
relax and chill out completely for a few days by doing something you
really enjoy, whether it be lazing around the garden, listening to music,
having a few rounds of golf or spending quality time with friends and
family. This may well enable you to get things into perspective and
help you cultivate a more relaxed attitude to life.
It is also important to all of us, but especially overly anxious
people, that we are able to recognise any early warning signs that we
are pushing ourselves too far. Then we can try to do something about
it before it is too late.
Total score 65–89
You are in the fortunate position that although, like all people, you
find yourself stressed out to a certain degree from time to time, this
tends to be the exception rather than the rule. Anxiety for you is no
more of a problem than it is for the average person.
Generally you appear to be a well-balanced person who is able to
face up to problems as they arise and does not spend too much time
worrying about things that may never happen. You also appear to
have sufficient resolve to face up to any stressful situations that may
occur in the future.
You are able to recognise any early warning signs that you may be
pushing yourself too hard and, on these occasions, are able to do
Emotional Intelligence
119

something about this by switching off somewhat and slowing down a
little.
Total score less than 65
Whilst you do worry on occasions, as do all of us, you appear to have
a laid-back, relaxed attitude to life, with the result that high anxiety is
less of a problem for you than it is for the average person.
This attitude can have a calming influence, not just on yourself but
also on those around you.
One word of caution to having an almost totally relaxed attitude
to life is believing that problems will never occur. We all have to
face up to numerous problems in our lifetime. Often, if we are able to
anticipate such problems, we are able to minimise or even avoid them.
Consequently, on occasions, a degree of forward planning is desirable.
You should therefore have the ability to plan ahead and also build in a
leeway for the unexpected.
It is also worth bearing in mind that a certain amount of tension is
positive. People often respond to, and are encouraged by, challenges.

and 0 points for every (b).
40–50 points
Your score indicates that you are an extrovert who enjoys being the
centre of attention and cannot by any stretch of the imagination be
called a shrinking violet.
This generally means that you will not be lacking in outer confidence
and you will always appear to be trying to get the most out of life,
although it is possible that some people who give the impression of
Emotional Intelligence
125

being extroverts are acting in this way in order to cover up their
inner self-doubts and anxieties.
Although many people will admire your zest and energy, you
should nevertheless take care not to be too much of an extrovert to
the point that people find you excessively pushy, even to the extent
of being overbearing. Often someone with a bubbly personality will
achieve greater success and win more friends if that personality is
tempered with a degree of modesty and sensitivity towards others.
25–39 points
Your score indicates that you are no more of an extrovert or an
introvert than the average person.
Although you sometimes may wish that you could be as outgoing
as those who appear more extrovert than yourself, it may be that by
having the ability to show reserve, especially when it is appropriate,
you are probably regarded by other people as someone who they feel
relaxed about having in their company.
If, at times, you feel that you are a little shy and ‘backward at
coming forward’, it may be that you secretly admire the way people
who are more extrovert than you behave. It is, however, these people
who are in the minority and, in fact, you are probably regarded by
other people as a person who does possess a much more appealing
personality.
Less than 25 points
Although your score indicates that you are quite introverted, this
does not mean that you cannot be successful in life.
Many people are extremely modest and shy, but at the same time
have the ability to be high achievers in their own field, providing they
can recognise their own talents and gain an extra bit of self-confidence
to harness their potential.
Although you may prefer to keep your views to yourself, on those
occasions where you are bursting to express an opinion, or join in a
conversation, you may be afraid of doing so because you worry about
what people think, especially if there are a number of people present.

This may be indicative of a lack of confidence in how people will
react to you, even to the extent of a feeling of inferiority.
It may be that you do not lack the inner self-confidence and belief
in yourself, but are afraid of expressing this inner self in public. You
should, however, make a concerted effort to try and gain that extra
degree of self-confidence to harness your potential even more and try
not to be backward at coming forward.

Mr Micawber was Charles Dickens’ eternal optimist, always expecting
that something would turn up. Your score indicates that you are a
twenty-first century Mr Micawber.
This is a wonderful and enviable outlook on life to possess. You
have the ability somehow to look on the bright side whatever happens
and firmly believe that for every dark cloud a silver lining will appear,
and that for every bad event something positive will emerge.
Provided you do not become na«ve or complacent about life’s
sometimes harsh realities, you will remain largely cheerful and to a
great extent carefree, knowing that by adopting this attitude you can
get the best out of life, just as long as you are prepared to accept the
inevitable downs with the ups.
Total score 65–89
Life is to a great extent a roller coaster, it can be exciting and
stimulating, there are high points and there are low points.
Like the majority of people, you cannot be described as either a
pessimist or an optimist. Instead you are a realist, but you are hopeful
that the high points in life exceed the low points, which they usually
do, providing that we do not exaggerate the low points in our own
mind, to the exclusion of the high points.
Although you do not appear to be a pessimist, perhaps one lesson
to be learned from the eternal optimist is that pessimists, indeed
people in general, always seem to worry too much. It is a fact worth
The Complete Book of Intelligence Tests

bearing in mind that most of the things we worry about in life never
happen anyway, so that in the majority of cases we are worrying
unduly.
Total score less than 65
Although you might prefer to describe yourself as a realist, your
score does suggest that you have a predominantly pessimistic outlook
on life.
Unfortunately this does mean that you are probably perceived by
others as a somewhat negative person, and that you frequently suffer
from a degree of inner turmoil and loss of sleep.
This is possibly your own way of creating a defensive emotional
shield against the consequences of what the future may have in store.
Then, if the worst happens, you have prepared yourself for it, but if
things turn out better than you anticipated you will feel good ^ until
you start to prepare yourself for the next potential catastrophe.
In actual fact, such a pessimistic attitude does not make anything
better or worse in the end, and in some cases causes worry that can
lead to stress-related illness and make negative things happen which
would not otherwise occur.
One strategy to counteract an overriding pessimistic attitude is not
to make mountains out of molehills. Instead, try to concentrate on the
positive aspects of life and put negative thoughts to the back of your
mind.
Unfortunately this is not so easy to achieve, especially if it is not in
your nature to do this, but it is worth the effort as you will then start
to feel the benefits, both health-wise and by an improved outlook on
life in general.

Analysis
A definition of ‘self-confidence’ is assuredness and self-reliance in one’s
own abilities.
In order to achieve self-confidence, it is necessary that we take a
realistic view of ourselves. As a result of this, some individuals will
have total confidence in a certain aspect of their lives, such as sporting
prowess, but other aspects in which they do not feel so confident, such
as academic achievement. Self-confidence need not, therefore, apply to
all respects of a person’s lifestyle.
Being self-confident does not, therefore, mean being able to do
everything. It does mean, however, that when sometimes their aspirations
are not fulfilled, self-confident people continue to adopt a positive
attitude, make the best of their situation and keep a sense of reality.
By adopting this attitude, self-confident people have the ability, to
a great extent, to take control of their own lives, accept themselves for
what they are and stand up for their own rights and aspirations in
today’s sometimes intimidating world, but at the same time keep these
aspirations realistic.
Self-confident people very rarely feel unsure of themselves, and
preoccupied with negative self thoughts, or put themselves down.
Because of this they are rarely sad, depressed or lonely.
Emotional Intelligence
137

At the same time, because they do not feel the need to conform in
order to be accepted, self-confident people are not excessively dependent
on others to feel good about themselves. They are willing to risk the
disapproval of others because of the confidence they possess.
The following are some strategies that can be adopted, and worked
at, for developing a greater degree of self-confidence:
* Learn to self-evaluate and take charge of your own life. Do not
focus too much on the unrealistic aspirations or standards of others
such as parents. Instead, focus on how you feel about yourself, your
lifestyle and your own aspirations.
* Evaluate and emphasise your strengths by focusing on your
achievements and the talents you possess.
* Even if you fail, give yourself credit for trying. View any failure as
a learning experience and as a way of achieving personal growth.
Give yourself credit for everything you try to achieve.
* Do not be afraid of taking calculated risks. Regard risk taking as a
chance to grasp new opportunities.
* Never be afraid of change. It is inevitable, so welcome and
embrace it.
* There is no such thing as perfection, so accept yourself for what
you are. At the same time, balance this with the need to improve.
* Never try to please everyone at the same time. It simply is not
possible.

Total score 90–125
Your score indicates that you are a very caring person who is deeply
touched by the feelings of others and often affected and saddened by
news bulletins or personal experiences about the plight of others who
are suffering misfortunes and tragedy.
It may also mean that you are extremely tactful and diplomatic,
always making sure you go to great lengths not to hurt other people’s
feelings. As such you are a kind-hearted and caring person who will
go out of their way to help others. This does mean that you are liked
and respected by those who know you.
Emotional Intelligence
141

It does, however, also mean that you may possibly lack the inner
toughness and drive that is sometimes necessary to achieve a high
degree of success.
It may also mean that occasionally you could be taken advantage
of, especially if you find it very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to
say no.
Keywords: caring, sharing, soft-hearted, idealistic, romantic.
Total score 65–89
You appear to be a generally tender-hearted person who would never
wish to hurt other people’s feelings deliberately.
It may be, however, that there is the need to peel off one or two
layers before this soft centre is revealed.
The advantage of this is that you are still tough enough to pursue
your ambitions and goals while retaining the loving and caring side of
your personality.
In your dealings with other people you can be tactful, but
occasionally are unable to stop yourself from speaking a few home
truths or saying things you might regret later.
You are, however, in the fortunate position of usually knowing
when, and when not, things are better left unsaid, and usually your
good judgement in this respect will prove beneficial to the person to
whom you are directing your remarks.
Keywords: empathetic, concerned, considerate.
Total score less than 65
While your score does indicate a high degree of toughness, it may be
that deep beneath this apparent hard exterior there lies something of a
soft centre. With some people their apparently hard exterior is, in fact,
something of an act as they do not wish to be perceived as being soft
or displaying weakness.
Also, although you do not come over as a romantic or
sentimentalist, this does not stop you from having a long and lasting
relationship and secure family life, and it does not mean that people

142

who are able to accept you for what you are will not respect you and
admire your honesty.
It is, however, not just for yourself, but for those around you,
important to always keep in mind the feelings of others and to try to
empathise with them.
If you are able to empathise with others and maintain their respect,
you appear to have the qualities of inner toughness which is sometimes
necessary to achieve a great deal of success in your chosen career or
business venture.
Keywords: pragmatic, resilient, resolute.

Memory
Memory (the ‘ninth intelligence’) is the process of storing and
retrieving information in the brain. It is this process of memory that is
central to our learning and thinking.
Human beings are continually learning throughout their lifetime.
Only some of this massive volume information is selected and stored
in the brain, and is available for recall later when required. Learning is
the acquisition of new knowledge and memory is the retention of this
knowledge. The combination of learning and memory, therefore, is
the basis of all our knowledge and abilities. It is what enables us to
consider the past, exist in the present and plan for the future. Its
importance and power should not be underestimated.
Every part of our life relies to some extent on memory and is what
enables us to walk, study, relax, communicate and play; in fact whatever
function we perform, some sort of memory process is at work.
As previously discussed in earlier chapters of this book, there are
many different types of intelligence, and people who have outstanding
artistic, creative, sporting or practical prowess can all be highly
successful, or occasionally geniuses, in their specific field without
having a high measured IQ.
Having a good memory is yet another type of intelligence, and
could result in high academic success, due to the ability to memorise
facts, despite a lower than average IQ measurement.
While little is known about the physiology of memory storage in
the brain, what is known is that memory involves the association of
several brain systems working together. It is also accepted that the more
we use our memory, the better it becomes. It is, therefore, important
144

to stimulate the memory by using it to the utmost, learning new skills
and using memory-enhancing techniques.
The tests in this chapter are designed to test your powers of
memory and to assist you in improving your memory by developing
your powers of concentration and disciplining yourself to fix your
mind on the subject being studied.

1 Just as the hapless interviewer was half way through asking his
most involved and difficult question, the worst thing that could
have happened did, and all hell was let loose as Ben saw a cat
through the dining room window. Apart from almost barking the
house down and totally drowning out the second half of the
question, Ben shot across the dining room in a brown blur before
throwing himself against the kitchen door with a sickening crash.
2 We all have the potential to be creative, however, because of the
pressures of modern living and the need for specialization, many
of us never have the time or opportunity, or indeed are given the
encouragement, to explore our latent talents, even though most
of us have sufficient ammunition to realise this potential in the
form of data which has been fed into, collated and processed by
the brain over many years.
3 Learning is the acquisition of new knowledge, and memory is the
retention of this knowledge. The combination of learning and
memory, therefore, is the basis of all our knowledge and abilities
and is what enables us to consider the past, exist in the present
and plan for the future.

Chapter 4 ^ Creativity
Test 4.0
Creativity personality test
Assessment
Total score 90–125
This score indicates a high degree of creativity and means that the right,
creative, side of your brain appears to be extremely active.
People who are creative in nature are likely to have tried out many
different pursuits during their lifetime and will continue to do so in
the coming years, as they are never afraid of trying out something
new. It is even possible that you have already achieved some degree of
success and fulfilment within a creative environment, e.g. as a writer
or designer.
It is suggested that people who have achieved a high score on this
test, but who have not yet experimented with creative pursuits such
as painting, garden or interior design or music, should follow their
intuition and do so now, whatever their age, since they appear to have
the necessary qualities, which possibly have been lying dormant, to
achieve success and fulfilment in some sort of creative pursuit.
While it is difficult to be too creative, people who have scored
highly on this test should not overlook the importance of developing
their analytical and intellectual skills, as well as their creative talents.
Total score 65–89
This score indicates an average degree of creativity.
Although you may exhibit creative tendencies, a score at the lower
end of this group suggests it is possible you may have neither the
time nor the confidence to try out new creative pursuits. In order to
become more creative it may be necessary to develop more confidence
and be more relaxed about taking intellectual risks, such as sitting down
and doing some drawing or painting, or making a start on writing the
novel you always felt was inside you.
The Complete Book of Intelligence Tests
184

A score within the higher range of this group suggests that you
may have already achieved some degree of creative success, but that
you may also have major undeveloped talents waiting to surface and
be cultivated.
Generally, however, any score within this group does suggest you
are in the fortunate position of being able to balance your creative
tendencies with logical and analytically formed judgements in order to
turn many of your ideas into a single, realistic and workable concept.
Total score less than 65
Although this score indicates a lower than average degree of creative
talents there may be many reasons for this, e.g. while you may possess
a rich storehouse of ideas, it may be that you feel more comfortable
when guided by set principles and traditional conventions.
Although each one of us has the potential to be creative in some
way or other, it may be that, like many other people, you have not yet
explored your creative talents.
It is quite likely that your skill outlets have been channelled into
one particular area in order to develop a career, and as such you are a
specialist who has little time to explore other avenues.
Creativity and intellect are two quite separate brain functions and it
is thus entirely possible to be highly intellectual in some fields but not
creative, and vice versa. It is, however, possible to train yourself to
bring out latent creative talents if you have the time and inclination to
do so. By exploring new avenues and learning experiences it is possible
to broaden your horizons considerably, and possibly surprise yourself
by discovering you possess creative talents and aptitudes of which you
were previously unaware.

provided that it is not similar to any of the other sketches. For
