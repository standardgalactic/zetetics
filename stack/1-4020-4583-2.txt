My ﬁrst book, Language and Representation in Information Retrieval, was so well received
that to write a book that was an extension of its theories was a difﬁcult and time-consuming
process. I spent 10 years writing this book which extends the analysis of my ﬁrst book.
During that time I greatly appreciated individuals who read my manuscripts and gave
me their impression of what I had written. The most dedicated reader of my manuscripts
was John Klinkert from Seattle, Washington, who read each of several versions of this
manuscript, and sent me written collections of his comments. I’m currently a professor
at the University of Michigan. The Michigan faculty member who read early versions of
my book was Kevin Kerber. His comments were very supportive and helpful. In Chicago,
former University of Chicago professor, Donald Swanson read several versions of my
manuscript, and was supportive enough to invite me to his house to discuss what I had
written. I also found some of his own publications relevant to my analysis, so they are
cited and discussed in the ﬁnal manuscript.
One of the most supportive acts concerning my early manuscripts of this book was per-
formed by Hubert Dreyfus, professor of philosophy at the University of California at
Berkeley. He read an early version of my manuscript and then quoted several paragraphs
of it in his new book, On the Internet (Routledge, 2001). This is especially complementary
because Hubert Dreyfus is one of the premier philosophers who uses philosophy to ana-
lyze practical problems. His 1972 book What Computers Can’t Do was an analysis of the
potential of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and has proven to be an extremely accurate predictor
of the limitations of it. (It’s in its 3rd edition now, and has been renamed What Computers
(Still) Can’t Do, MIT Press) Overall, Dreyfus is the most inspiring modern philosopher
for my work in applying philosophy to the practical problems of information systems as I
did in this book.
Other individuals who read and responded to early manuscripts of this book were Richard
Boland, professor at Case Western University, M.E. Maron, professor emeritus of the
University of California, Berkeley, Brian O’Connor, professor at North Texas University,
Ron Day, professor at Wayne State University, and Eric Edderer, a professional librarian.

Part I: Introduction
“The more narrowly we examine language, the sharper becomes the conﬂict be-
tween it and our requirement. (For the crystalline purity of logic was, of course, not
a result of investigation; it was a requirement.) The conﬂict becomes intolerable;
the requirement is now in danger of becoming empty.—We have got onto slippery
ice where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal,
but also, just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want to walk; so we need
friction. Back to the rough ground!”1
—Ludwig Wittgenstein
This manuscript consists of four related parts: a brief overview of Wittgenstein’s phi-
losophy of language and its relevance to information systems; a detailed explanation of
Wittgenstein’s late philosophy of language and mind; an extended discussion of the rele-
vance of his philosophy to understanding some of the problems inherent in information
systems, especially those systems which rely on retrieval based on some representation
of the intellectual content of that information. And, fourthly, a series of detailed footnotes
which cite the sources of the numerous quotations and provide some discussion of the
related issues that the text inspires. The ﬁrst three of these parts can each be read by itself
with some proﬁt, although they are related and do form a conceptual whole. Still, the
reader who wants an overview of many of the arguments advanced herein, can get them
comparatively quickly from Part I, while the reader who wants to see, in some detail, the
exegesis of Wittgenstein’s late philosophy of language and mind would do well to read
Part II with some care. Of course, the central message of the manuscript is presented in
Part III, where the implications of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy for information systems,
especially information retrieval systems, are worked out in some detail, providing a deeper
discussion of the issues described in Part I. The only part which cannot be read by itself
is, of course, the footnotes, what I would call Part IV. Footnotes have an ambivalent status
in writing. Manuals of style insist that if the material is important enough to be included
in a manuscript it should be placed in the text and not in the footnotes; if it’s not important
enough to include in the text, it’s not important enough, with few exceptions, to be in the
footnotes either. Some individuals are even more pointed in their dislike of footnotes. John
Barrymore once said “A footnote in a book is like a knock on the door downstairs while
you are on your honeymoon.” Certainly footnotes can interrupt the ﬂow of the manuscript,
and long footnotes can take the reader far enough away from the discussion of the main
text that it may be difﬁcult to return to it. Yet, some texts demand the links and extended
discussion that footnotes provide, and this present text is one of them. In the ﬁrst place,
any detailed exegesis of Wittgenstein’s, admittedly difﬁcult, philosophy, requires citations
to identify the wide variety of sources of the frequent quotations and the related or alterna-
tive versions of cited passages. Wittgenstein’s philosophy, in particular, has generated an
enormous amount of critical analysis since his death half a century ago, and to ignore the
major points of this analysis would be unwise, so references have been made to discussions

or critiques of his work, especially those made by the premier Wittgenstein scholars, G.P.
Baker and P.M.S. Hacker, and Wittgenstein’s former student and professor of philosophy,
Norman Malcolm, who spent his career as professor of philosophy at Cornell University.2
Wittgenstein himself was not a systematic writer, developing many of the main themes of
his work in a sporadic fashion throughout his writings. This unsystematic development of
his work demands that the selections from his writings which are used here be carefully
cited so that the reader can see where, in the 15 volumes of his currently published writ-
ings, the exact quotations come from. Because Wittgenstein’s later philosophy is spread
out across so many individual works, it would be unreasonable to expect the reader to have
copies of all of Wittgenstein’s writings for reference. Consequently, I have made every
attempt to quote relevant passages as completely as possible, and, in some cases, to give
examples of the variations of the same statement in different parts of his writings. To this
end, the reader will not be required to have a library of all of Wittgenstein’s works cited
herein in order to follow the thread of this discussion.
Another reason for the large number of detailed footnotes is the nature of the subject
of this discussion—language. The subject of language is as broad and deep a topic as
there is. Language permeates almost every aspect of our lives, and the nature of meaning
resists concise or comprehensive explanation. Language, it can be argued, is part of the
very deﬁnition of what it means to be human, and any discussion of the nature of lan-
guage inevitably brings up myriad links to the cognitive, social and cultural dimensions
of mankind. One cannot write succinctly about the nature of language and meaning and
still hope to capture its depth and complexity. As Wittgenstein himself put it, “. . . words
have meaning only in the stream of life.”3 This is not the ﬁrst text on language to deal
with its complexity in this way, Noam Chomsky’s ﬁrst two, enormously inﬂuential, books
on language, Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1969) and Cartesian Linguistics (1966)
had similar styles.4 Both of these works brought out the complexity and depth of the
subject of language by providing detailed footnotes that greatly increased the length of
the texts themselves. Any serious discussion of language use and its related issues is,
fundamentally, an intellectual adventure. The footnotes in this text are meant to describe
the many directions and dimensions of this adventure. Certainly, if the pleasures of the
text are enough to make the reader regret the distraction of a footnote, then the best advice
is to keep reading and, in John Barrymore’s metaphor, simply refuse to answer the knock
at the door. As I pointed out above, the text in large part does stand by itself.
Why Language?—Why Philosophy?—Why Wittgenstein?
Making our way through Wittgenstein’s late philosophy of language and mind is a de-
manding journey, so it will be helpful to ﬁrst survey Wittgenstein’s intellectual landscape

to identify its major features and how they relate to the issues of information retrieval.
This will give our later analysis a clearer foundation. Wittgenstein wrote frequently of the
importance of the “ ¨Ubersicht,” or “Overview” of examples necessary to see how a word
is used (see the section in Part II “Five Red Apples” for a more detailed discussion of the
German word “ ¨Ubersicht”). This brief survey of some of his ideas and how they relate
to information systems provides a kind of “ ¨Ubersicht” of his philosophy of language and
will set the principal features of the intellectual landscape on which we will make our
explorations in Parts II and III.
First of all, why are the issues of language and meaning important to the study of in-
formation systems? Information systems are, of course, tools that are used to search for
information of various kinds: data, text, images, etc. Information searches themselves
inevitably require the searcher to ask for or describe the information he or she wants and
to match those descriptions with the descriptions of the information that is available: in
short, when we ask for or describe information we must mean something by these state-
ments. This places the requests for information as properly within the study of language
and meaning.5 Surely, requests for information, or descriptions of available information,
can be clear or ambiguous, precise or imprecise, just as statements in natural language
can. In short, understanding how requests for, and descriptions of, information work,
and, more importantly, how they can go wrong, is an issue of language, meaning and
understanding.
Why, then, is the focus of this discussion on philosophy? Certainly, the ﬁelds of linguistics
and literature, especially literary criticism, have much to tell us about language and mean-
ing. I would agree, and should I write another book I might be tempted to look to those
ﬁelds for enlightenment about meaning and language. But I’m turning to philosophy of
language ﬁrst for the principal reason that its main concern is with how we mean what
we say—how does language actually work? These are important issues in linguistics and
literary study, but they are not the central concerns of these ﬁelds. Since the problem of
meaning in language is the central concern of this discussion, its aims and focus most
closely parallel the aims and focus of the philosophy of language. Another reason why
the philosophy of language is particularly pertinent for the present discussion is that for
philosophy in general, and Wittgenstein in particular, there is no sharp boundary between
understanding language and cognition—how we understand language is closely coupled
with how we understand things in general. Not only language, but understanding is im-
portant for information systems, too, since information systems are often used to help us
understand things better. As we will see in Part III, information systems are part of what
I, following Clark,6 would call the “scaffolding” of our thought. I take the approach of
philosophy of language to be the fundamental examination of the issues of meaning, so if
there are any clear insights into our understanding of meaning, they will likely be found
here ﬁrst. This is why the philosophy of language is so important to our investigation.
Nevertheless, we must be selective about what we use from the philosophy of language.
Like any other intellectual discipline, the philosophy of language has its own speciﬁc

puzzles—what Thomas Kuhn called “exemplars”7—that preoccupy its practitioners. Some
of these are helpful in our investigation, and some are not. Looking at the conduct of the
philosophy of language in general, one can discern a number of courses its study has taken:
early work, primarily that of Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege, was concerned with the
relationship between language and the world. For them, language was primarily used to
make factual assertions about the world. The central question of this era was “What are
the truth conditions of a statement?” that is, “What is the relationship between meaning
and truth?” While these are important questions for the philosophy of language, and are
still prominent concerns of some present day work, the truth conditions of a statement
do not tell us much that would be important to the study of language and information. In
recognition of this, our discussion must be selective about what we use from the philosophy
of language, and very thorough about extracting the maximum beneﬁt from those aspects
of philosophy that are relevant to our present study. “Ockham’s Razor” is no less relevant
to our present study than it was to the 14th century philosopher William of Ockham in
his defense of Nominalism. Another obvious question must be, why is the philosophy of
Wittgenstein particularly important for this study; that is, why not just survey the pertinent
sections of the Philosophy of Language in general? There are many philosophers of lan-
guage, and many philosophical theories which have contributed to our understanding of
meaning in language. Why should we concentrate our efforts on Wittgenstein’s, admittedly
difﬁcult, philosophy of language? Surely there are other, easier, routes to furthering our
understanding of language and meaning. But Wittgenstein is unique among philosophers
in the following respect: early in his career he was the consummate logician, the intellec-
tual heir apparent to the pioneering logical work of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell.
Frege and Russell believed that ordinary language was not precise enough to represent
the complexity and subtleties of meaning that were becoming increasingly important for
analytic philosophy. Russell believed that the goal of analytic philosophy was to clarify
what we say about the world. Analytic philosophy should take its inspiration from what
Russell believed was the rigor of the scientiﬁc method. Since different branches of science
often needed their own representational systems to express factual scientiﬁc relationships
clearly, philosophy would need a similar rigorous representational system to make what
it could assert perfectly clear, or so Russell and Frege thought. What we needed, they
believed, was a logical language that could faithfully model these complexities and sub-
tleties of expression, and could be used to clarify whether statements of fact were true or
false—a language that could be used to bring out and make explicit the underlying logic
of language. Early in his career, Wittgenstein was sympathetic with this view of language,
believing, like Russell and Frege, that language could be made more precise through the
use of formal logic. In his introduction to Wittgenstein’s ﬁrst published work, Tracta-
tus Logico-Philosophicus, Russell describes Wittgenstein as being “concerned with the
conditions which would have to be fulﬁlled by a logically perfect language.”8 Russell goes
on to describe a logically perfect language as one which “has rules of syntax which prevent

nonsense, and has single symbols which always have a deﬁnite and unique meaning.”9 But
as Wittgenstein’s thought matured, he began to have serious misgivings about the ability of
logic to model or represent the complex and subtle statements of language. Not only was
logic inadequate to this task, he thought, ordinary language itself was, if used properly,
the best possible medium for linguistic expression, philosophical or otherwise. In short,
Wittgenstein’s thought evolved from a belief that problems of meaning in language could
be clariﬁed by logically analytical methods to a realization that many of the unclarities
of language were a result of removing statements from the context, practices and cir-
cumstances in which they were commonly used—what Wittgenstein called our “Forms
of Life.” What determined the truth or meaning of a statement was not some underlying
logic, but how the statement was used and what circumstances it was used in. Ambigui-
ties in language are clariﬁed, not by logical analysis, but by looking at how the words or
phrases in question are used in our daily activities and practices. Wittgenstein’s transition
in his view of language is important for the study of information systems for the follow-
ing reason: our current most widespread model of information systems is the computer
model, in particular, the “data model” of information. This has been a very successful and
robust model that has had a remarkably long history of implementation. Computers are,
in a fundamental sense, logical machines, so we might say that the current most popular
model for information systems is the logical model. This logical model, as we will show,
has worked well for providing access to the precise, highly determinate content of our data
bases—things like names, addresses, phone numbers, account balances, etc. But as more
and more of our information is becoming managed by computerized systems we ﬁnd that
we must provide access to less determinate information, like the “intellectual content”
of written text, images, and audio recordings—for example, searching for information
that analyzes the economic prospects of Central European countries, or information that
evaluates the impact of government regulation on small businesses. These kinds of access
are not as well served by the logical data model of information, as one can easily see
when trying to ﬁnd some speciﬁc subject matter (intellectual content) on the World Wide
Web using an Internet search engine.10 Current information systems are in some way, the
victims of the success of the more determinate data model of information. The logical/data
9Op.cit., p. x.
10I ﬁrst made this distinction between the more precise logical model of Data Retrieval and the less precise,
more problematic model of Document Retrieval in “The Data-Document Distinction in Information Retrieval.”
[Communications of the ACM, vol. 27:4, pp. 369–374, April 1984.]
Some readers will no doubt rejoin that they have no trouble ﬁnding the intellectual content they are seeking on
the WWW, and, in a certain sense, this is true—one can always ﬁnd something relevant to one’s search on the
web. The key issue here is not ﬁnding “something relevant,” but ﬁnding the best information for some purpose
available on the web. Swanson described some time ago what he called the “Fallacy of Abundance”:
A scientist who nowadays imagines either that he is keeping up with his ﬁeld or that he can later
ﬁnd in the library whatever may have escaped his notice when it was ﬁrst written is a victim of
what might be called the “fallacy of abundance.” The fact that so much can be found on any
subject creates an illusion that little remains hidden. Although library searches probably seem
more often than not to be successful simply because a relatively satisfying amount of material
is exhumed, such success may be illusory, since the requester cannot assess the quantity and
value of relevant information which he fails to discover. [D.R. Swanson. “Searching Natural
Language Text by Computer,” Science, vol. 132, pp. 1960–1104, 21 October 1960. Quotation
p. 1099.]

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
model of information has become the Procrustean Bed to which many information sys-
tems are forced to ﬁt.11 The effort to ﬁt language and information to the logical model
was justiﬁed because it was assumed that, as Russell and the early Wittgenstein believed,
there is an underlying logic of language that governed its correct usage—an underlying
logic which must be uncovered if we wanted to insure the clarity of expression. On this
view, information systems used to provide access to “intellectual content” are just sloppy
or imprecise versions of data retrieval systems. But it was one of Wittgenstein’s clearest
reassessments of his early philosophy when he said that “. . . the crystalline purity of logic
was, of course, not a result of investigation; it was a requirement”—that is, the logic that
Russell and Frege sought to uncover in their analysis of language, did not exist latently
in language waiting to be uncovered. The logic of language was something that was a
requirement for the analysis to begin with—it was something that was imposed on lan-
guage. Just as Wittgenstein began to have misgivings about the applicability of the logical
model, with its requirement for the strict determinacy of sense, to all aspects of language
and meaning, some, this author included, are now having misgivings about how applica-
ble the logical/data model of information is to the more complex and subtle problems of
access to less determinate information such as the “intellectual content” of written text,
images and audio recordings, a kind of access becoming increasingly widespread as more
and more of our information starts out in machine readable form. As Douglas van Kirk
put it:
Corporations everywhere are beginning to recognize that information is almost
always document-oriented. Because so many companies are in the information
business, it stands to reason that the most productive companies will be those that
manage documents effectively.
The reason why documents are so important to organizations is that they provide the
context that makes information more meaningful. Wittgenstein, the consummate logician,
came to see the limitations of logic when used to analyze language, and tried during the
remainder of his career to indicate what was rigorous and right about ordinary language.
Given that language does make sense, how does it do this without the armamentarium
of logic? Wittgenstein’s answer to this is both relevant to, and important for, access to
intellectual content. Ordinary language is good enough for our purposes:
It is wrong to say that in philosophy we consider an ideal language as opposed to
our ordinary one. For this makes it appear as though we thought we could improve
on ordinary language. But ordinary language is all right. Whenever we make up
“ideal languages” it is not in order to replace our ordinary language by them; but
This was a remarkably prescient insight for 40 years ago, at the very beginning of the explosive growth in
available information, and the electronic revolution in information storage and retrieval. Swanson could see this
affect of abundance even in the research libraries of that time. Those systems, of course, are dwarfed by the size
of today’s World Wide Web, with its billions of separately searchable and retrievable pages.
11One needs only to look at the advertisements of the largest data base management system manufacturer, Oracle,
to see this.
They advocate storing every kind of information, data, text, audio, images, video, on their systems, with no
indication that each of these information types might require vastly different access methods.

just to remove some trouble caused in someone’s mind by thinking that he has got
hold of the exact use of a common word.12 [BB p. 28]
On the one hand it is clear that every sentence in our language “is in order as
it is.” That is to say, we are not striving after an ideal, as if our ordinary vague
sentences had not yet got a quite unexceptionable sense, and a perfect language
awaited construction by us.—On the other hand it seems clear that where there
is sense there must be perfect order.—So there must be perfect order even in the
vaguest sentence. [PI § 98]
Wittgenstein is not saying that we are never misunderstood when we use ordinary language;
of course we are. Wittgenstein is just clarifying how we should identify and resolve
these misunderstandings. Instead of building a “logically perfect language” that would be
more precise than our day-to-day language, or using logical methods to analyze linguistic
mistakes, we must reorient our investigation: Instead of looking for an underlying logic
of language, we need to look at how language is actually used, for it’s not an underlying
logic that clariﬁes what we mean, it’s the context, activities and practices in which we use
language that provide the fundamental clariﬁcation of meaning we are looking for. This is
why Wittgenstein’s work is so relevant to the study of information systems. Formal logic
is useful for clarifying or solving a narrow range of problems and puzzles in language.
Russell’s,andtheearlyWittgenstein’s,mistakewastothinklogicwasapplicableforsolving
a wide variety of linguistic problems that went beyond this narrow range. Like formal logic,
the data model of information systems is an enormously successful model for the design
of a narrow range of information retrieval tasks—those systems which provide access
to highly determinate information (names, addresses, phone numbers, account balances,
etc.). The data/logical model of information is a less successful model for providing access
to the less determinate “intellectual content” of things like documents and images. The
data/logical model cannot always capture the subtleties of language necessary for the
retrieval of precise intellectual content on large information systems (again, searching
for speciﬁc intellectual content on the World Wide Web is a good example). And, like
language, there is no underlying logical model of information that we need to uncover—
the “crystalline purity of logic” for information systems, like language, is “not a result of
investigation; it [is] a requirement.” That is, for the data/logical model to be applicable to
all information systems, it is required that the information on the system be represented in
extremely precise or determinate ways. But this process will have the effect, not of making
better, “more precise” information systems, but, in the case of the search for “intellectual
content,” of making dysfunctional information systems—systems which are insensitive to
the subtleties of language that are required for highly speciﬁc access to intellectual content,
especially on large systems. As long as we believe that the precision of representation for
data retrieval is possible for all information systems, we will run the risk of building such
dysfunctional systems.
But recognizing the problems with the logical/data model of information is only part
of the problem. What is needed to replace the inadequacies of the logical/data model?

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Wittgenstein’s reassessment of the logical model of language, and his assessment of how
language really works, is, it is the thesis of this discussion, a good guide for how the
logical/data model of information systems must be changed or evolve if it is to provide
satisfactory access to less determinate information such as intellectual content. Most
philosophers of language have not been logicians, and those who had expertise in logic
were not logicians of the ﬁrst rank, as Wittgenstein was. This is why his reassessment of
the usefulness of the logical model of language carries so much weight, and is particularly
relevant to the present study. One of the central issues of language, for Wittgenstein,
was what he called the “determinacy of sense”—the precision by which meaning can
be deﬁned. As we will see, it reappears as a fundamental issue in information retrieval
too.
Surveying Wittgenstein’s Landscape
To begin our discussion, it will be useful to provide a brief overview of some of the major
themesofWittgenstein’sphilosophyoflanguageandmind,andtheirrelationtoinformation
retrieval systems. These major themes can be represented by carefully selected quotations
from his works.
1. . . . we don’t start from certain words, but from certain occasions or activities.
[LC p. 3]13
Language does not exist by itself in a static system of deﬁnitions and syntax, but is
intimately caught up in our activities and practices, what Wittgenstein called our “forms
of life.”14 These forms of life comprise what Wittgenstein referred to as the “common
behaviorofmankind.”15 Languageisnotsomuchacollectionof“meanings”butsomething
that can be used to do things—it is an essential part of our everyday activities and practices.
This makes meaning a largely collective notion: meaning emerges from the use of language
in the conduct of day-to-day activities and practices. Emergent phenomena occur when a
broad, higher level pattern emerges from the personal interactions of individual entities in
theabsenceofanycentralcontroller.Inlanguage,“meaning”emergesfromtheinteractions
of native speakers using language in their day-to-day activities.16 A dictionary deﬁnition

Press, Berkeley, 1972. Edited by C. Barrett. [Hereafter referred to as LC]
14“. . . the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.” [PI §23]
15“The common behavior of mankind is the system of reference by means of which we interpret an unknown
language” [PI §206]. This is the reason that, as Wittgenstein comments:
“If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.” [PI p. 223]
Even if the lion were to use the same vocabulary as we do, because his day-to-day activities are so different from
ours, he would use our words in strikingly different ways. He would also have no conception of the speciﬁc uses
of words which we consider commonplace (e.g., a lion would have no idea what a “pet” is because pets have no
role in its day-to-day activities, and what he would consider “food” would be strikingly different from our own
conception). If our speaking lion were to say he was “stepping out for lunch” we could be assured that he was
not going to a restaurant.
16Zipf asserted that the fundamental linguistic interaction which governs language use is the “competition”
between speakers and hearers, where the speaker is trying to express himself as economically as possible,

does not precede the use of an expression, but emerges from the day-to-day use of the
expression as a component in a particular activity or practice. As Wittgenstein put it,
“. . . words have meaning only in the stream of life” [RPPII §687]. There are no private
linguistic meanings or private languages—my sensations are, of course, personal and
cannot be felt by others, but while my pain may be personal, I can only talk about it using
the expressions commonly used to talk about pain.17
The idea of “emergence” is a relatively recent idea, but Wittgenstein seems to have antici-
pated some of the basic characteristics of this phenomenon. John Holland18 discusses how
the process of emergence can give the impression of something orderly and meaningful
arising out of “chaos” or “disorder.” Wittgenstein hinted at this possibility of order arising
from disorder:
No supposition seems to me more natural than that there is no process in the brain
correlated with associating or with thinking; so that it would be impossible to read
off thought-processes from brain-processes. I mean this: if I talk or write there
is, I assume, a system of impulses going out from my brain and correlated with
and the hearer is, himself, trying to exert as little effort as possible to understand him. The “competition”
occurs because the speaker tries to use as few words as possible, thus minimizing his effort, while the hearer is
simultaneously trying to get the speaker to use more words in order to simplify his efforts at understanding the
speaker. Zipf calls this the competition between speaker and hearer, or the competition between the forces of
“uniﬁcation” and “diversiﬁcation.” Optimal linguistic understanding occurs when the efforts of the speaker and
hearer reach a balance where the sum of their respective efforts is a minimum. It is from these local interactions
between speakers and hearers that meaning in language emerges. (for a more detailed presentation of Zipf’s
theory of language see the section “Implications of the ‘Language as City’ Metaphor” in Part II).
17Wittgenstein’s argument against private languages or meanings rests on two assertions: ﬁrst, private languages
can only be discussed or described using the ordinary public language which is available to us all. But if the
meaning of private language is expressible only through public language then it is not a private language at all,
but merely a somewhat different form of ordinary, public language. As Wittgenstein put it:
“What goes on within . . . has meaning only in the stream of life” [Last Writings on the Phi-
losophy of Psychology, vol. II, p. 30. Blackwell Publishers, Oxford, UK, 1992.]. [Hereafter
referred to as LWPP II]
Secondly, language requires exemplary uses of words as guides to meaningful usage. We do the same kind of
thing when we suggest that certain paintings are exemplars of a particular style. In art we can say that if you want
to look at an exemplar, or, good example, of impressionist painting look at Monet’s work. In language, similarly,
we can say that if you want to know when to use the word “charisma” think of John F. Kennedy at a presidential
press conference, or if you want to know how to use the word “compassion” think of Mother Teresa’s work with
the desperately poor—these are exemplary cases. But since the meanings of words in a private language would
be entirely personal, you would not be able to establish such exemplars—that is, since, in a private language,
a word can mean anything you want it to, there could be no examples which are better than others—in other
words, there could be no role for exemplars to play. Even if you could establish exemplars in a private language,
how would you know whether you were applying the exemplars correctly or not? The essential interplay between
speakers and hearers, by which we gauge the correctness of our usage, and from which correct usage emerges,
would be missing. There are no criteria for the establishment of exemplars in a private language, in fact there are
no coherent criteria for the correct usage of any words of a private language. Since the speaker and the hearer
are the same individual in a private language, there is no chance of there ever being a misunderstanding. Again,
for Zipf, meaningful language arises from the “balance” achieved by the competition of Speakers and Hearers,
yet in a private language there is no such interplay and no “balance” of usage, hence, there can be no private
linguistic meaning in the ordinary sense.

my spoken or written thoughts. But why should the system continue further in the
direction of the centre? Why should this order not proceed, so to speak, out of
chaos?19
Relevance to Information Systems: The underlying order of information systems, in
so far as they are linguistic systems, is not so much words and categories, but “occasions
and activities.” Yet often it is the relation to “occasions and activities” that is lost when
information is organized for retrieval, especially when it is placed on a computerized
retrieval system. Consider a simple example. Paper-based information has some obvious
disadvantages regarding storage and copying when compared to the same information in
electronic form. But paper-based information has one distinct advantage over electronic
information: since a paper document does not need delicate electronic equipment to
present it, it can be carried and used almost anywhere, from the ofﬁce, to the home, to a bus,
to a rainy construction site, etc. It is also easy to mark up, annotate or highlight paper, and
parts of it can be clipped out or xeroxed and distributed. Further, small accidents such as
dropping the paper or spilling coffee on it do not render it unreadable, though information
on a laptop computer could not stand such abuse. Consequently, paper-based information
can remain close to the activities that produce or use it, and these activities can provide
an interpretive context for that information. But when that information is computerized,
the very act of computerization may have the effect of removing the information from
the activity context that provides much of its meaning and interpretation.20
2. The best example of an expression with a very speciﬁc meaning is a passage in
a play.21
We learn our native language not so much by memorizing the deﬁnitions of words and
phrases, but by watching it being used, trying to use it ourselves, and having new expres-
sions or subtleties of meaning demonstrated to us by others. The best deﬁnition of a new
word or expression is not a dictionary deﬁnition, but a scene in a play. For Wittgenstein, de-
scriptions or demonstrations (e.g., plays) are better ways of conveying or clarifying mean-
ing than explanations (dictionary deﬁnitions). In fact, “stage setting” can be an essential
component of meaning even for a linguistic act as simple as giving something a name:
When one says “He gave a name to his sensation” one forgets that a great deal of
stage setting in the language is presupposed if the mere act on naming is to make
sense. [PI §257]
A dictionary deﬁnition is a kind of shorthand explanation, what Wittgenstein was later to
call a kind of “Language Game,” and typically can only help us if we already understand
the general role of the word in language. When we understand a new expression, what
we have is not the ability to recall its deﬁnition, but the ability to use the expression in

the appropriate circumstances and context. We may be able to use many words correctly
without being able to deﬁne them—Modern English, the language since Shakespeare,
existed until the18th century without dictionaries, and it was many more years before
dictionaries were widely available. Prior to the wide use of dictionaries, all language
learning had to be done through the personal interactions of native speakers in, or with
reference to, the relevant daily activities or circumstances. Yet these daily interactions,
unaided by dictionaries, produced the rich and nuanced language of Shakespeare’s plays
and a wealth of literature, essays, history and philosophy. If dictionaries were not widely
available until fairly recently, then, it seems that before that we had no central or “essential”
criteria for correct meaning or usage.22 But there is no evidence that the lack of dictionaries
caused any great confusion in communication: There are other criteria for correct usage,
criteria that are available to every native speaker, literate or not.
Suppose you came as an explorer into an unknown country with a language quite
strange to you. In what circumstances would you say that the people there gave
orders, understood them, obeyed them, rebelled against them, and so on?
The common behavior of mankind is the system of reference by means of which
we interpret an unknown language. [PI §206]
The criteria for correct usage come from our understanding of the “common behavior of
mankind.”23 (NB: It is important to note that Wittgenstein is not equating behavior and
meaning, only that behavior is the “system of reference” with which we can “interpret
an unknown language.” See Part II, sections “The Foundation of Language in Instinctive
Behavior” and “Why Wittgenstein is not a Behaviorist.”)
Relevance to Information Systems: Plays are fundamentally stories. So if the best ex-
ample of a word’s use is a scene in a play, then the fundamental structure of linguistic
meaning is the narrative.24 Insofar as language is used in information systems to repre-
sent or describe what is stored on the system, its meaning, too, may be more faithfully
22This lack of a set of “central criteria” for correct meaning comes out in Hilary Putnam’s notion of the “Division
of Linguistic Labor.” Putnam insists that the meaning of a word is not one thing that can be in any single person’s
possession, but is distributed among a variety of speakers who use the word in question for a variety of activities
and purposes. [Representation and Reality, p. 22ff. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1996.]
23The philosopher W.O. Quine wrote in his famous essay on “the indeterminacy of translation,” that if someone
speaking a language we did not understand, consistently uttered the word “gavagai” in the presence of a rabbit
we still could not be assured that “gavagai” actually meant “rabbit”—it could mean, he claimed, “undetached
parts of rabbits” or “rabbithood” [Word and Object, §12, p. 52. MIT Press, 1960]. Wittgenstein admitted
that language is extremely variable and we may have trouble understanding a language we don’t know. But
there is more of a common basis for mutual understanding than Quine would admit to. In so far as the ac-
tivities and practices are the same between two linguistic groups, there will be mutual understanding of their
respective languages (Quine makes no claim that the activities of the speakers are at all dissimilar). Differ-
ences of meaning are proportional to the differences in respective activities and practices. Since the practice
of pointing out and naming things like rabbits is common to virtually all linguistic groups, it is doubtful that
“gavagai,” when uttered in the presence of a rabbit scurrying by, would ever mean “undetached rabbit parts”
in any major languages. In short, the word “rabbit” and the practice of pointing things out, have roles in our
activities, but the description “undetached rabbit parts” does not (at least for activities other than philosophical
ones).
24Mark Turner takes the narrative to be even more basic. For him, the narrative is the fundamental structure of
not just language, but cognition itself. He distinguishes between the narrative and the parable. The parable is

12
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
interpreted in terms of a narrative. This ﬁts more closely with the idea that information
is most productively seen as part of an activity or practice—an activity or practice, like a
story or a play, can be described as a sequence of events over time.25
3. When I think in language, there aren’t “meanings” going through my mind in
addition to the verbal expressions: the language is itself the vehicle of thought.
[PI §329]
Language, that is, speech or writing, is not a product of thought, but a means by which
we think. This reversal of the usual way of looking at the relation between what we say
or write and what we think, is one of Wittgenstein’s most important insights. Language
gives us words, phrases and ways of expressing ourselves that serve as a set of implements
with which we carry out the activities of speaking, understanding others, and thinking.
In his primary later work, Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein’s discussion of the
nature of language is replete with metaphors of tools and implements (see Part II of this
manuscript: “Words are Like Tools and Language Use is Like Tool Use”).
If language is a vehicle of thought, then a number of important consequences follow. In
the ﬁrst place, the words and expressions that we have available in our language represent
a kind of limit not only for what we say, but, more importantly, for what we can think,
verbally. As the painter is limited by the kinds of paint she has, and the size and style of her
brushes, so too are we limited in our verbal thought by the kinds of words and expressions
we have available to us—the words and expressions we understand and know how to use.
Language is not a straitjacket, though, we can use common words and expressions in
new and creative ways, of course. But our verbal thoughts are quite clearly anchored in
our language, and though we may ﬁnd ways to express new ideas, what we say must be
grounded in the bedrock of our common tongue.
One of the ways in which we use familiar expressions to express new ideas is through
metaphors. When Wittgenstein tells us that much of our language use is like a “game” he
gives us a clearer sense of the intimacy, dynamics and complexity of language use than
he could by describing the detailed processes of expression without the analogy to games
[see the section “Language Games” in Part II]. Wittgenstein’s frequent use of metaphors
in his writings enabled him to stretch the boundaries of philosophical expression into the
new areas he wanted to discuss [see the section “Philosophy of Language and Metaphor”
in Part II].
Of course, we can also think with images and sound, and Wittgenstein was not denying
that this kind of thought occurs, too, but he was primarily concerned with the conduct of
philosophy, and philosophy must be written or spoken.

expression, and, as such, deﬁne the limits of our ability to think and express ourselves

verbally, then the words used to represent information must deﬁne the limits of our ability
to think about and to express our information needs.
4. Our craving for generality has another main source: our preoccupation with
the method of science. I mean the method of reducing the explanation of nat-
ural phenomena to the smallest possible number of primitive natural laws . . . .
Philosophers constantly see the method of science before their eyes, and are ir-
resistibly tempted to ask and answer questions in the way science does. This
tendency is the real source of metaphysics, and leads the philosopher into com-
plete darkness. I want to say that it can never be our job to reduce anything
to anything, or to explain anything. Philosophy really is “purely descriptive!”
[BB p. 18]
Although Wittgenstein made this statement against reduction in the Blue and Brown
Books, one of his earlier writings, his distrust of reduction was an attitude that he carried
withhimthroughtheremainderofhiswork.26 ForWittgenstein,wecannotreducelinguistic
meaning to anything more primitive than what we say and do. It is true that we ask for and
give deﬁnitions of individual words, but asking for and giving deﬁnitions is a particular
kind of language game, and we can only understand the deﬁnition of an individual word if
we already understand its general role in our language. Further, these individual deﬁnitions
of words are not the complete meanings of words, nor can they usually be put together to
arrive at the meaning of sentences or longer text—that is, the meaning of a sentence is not
always reducible to some aggregate of the meanings of the individual words it contains. If
we want to understand the meaning of a sentence we must look at how it is used—this is
the most basic level of analysis that we can do in language27 [This point will be presented
in more detail in a subsequent section discussing the Augustinean model of language.].
Relevance to Information Systems: Since we cannot generally reduce ordinary language
tomoreprimitivecomponentsofmeaningwithoutlosingsomeofthemeaningthatemerges
from its use, we should not expect that a statement that requests information of some kind
could be analyzed into more primitive components without some semantic deﬁcit, either.
Like language, if we want to understand the meaning of an information request we need
to look at how the expression is used, that is, to look at the background of the person
making the request, the purpose or rationale for his/her request, the activity that the request
serves, and the particular circumstances in which the request was made. Each of these
can have a bearing on determining what the request “means,” that is, what information
would prove useful to the inquirer. Wittgenstein was quite clear in his insistence that
26Strictly speaking, the Blue and Brown Books is not one of Wittgenstein’s “writings” in the sense that TLP and
PI are. It is actually a collection of class notes put together by some of his students in the late 1930’s as material
to accompany his seminars. Although they were not written entirely by Wittgenstein, they do reﬂect the issues he
was grappling with in his seminars, and the notes themselves were thoroughly vetted by Wittgenstein before being
distributed. Further, the ideas expressed in BB are entirely consistent with the issues that he worked on during
the remainder of his life. BB is often referred to as “Preliminary Studies for the Philosophical Investigations”
27Wittgenstein would have a particular disagreement with the kinds of reductive analysis of language that
Chomsky engaged in with his “Transformational Grammar.” Chomsky’s linking of the “surface structures” of
language with “deep structures” in the mind, commits two major mistakes on Wittgenstein’s analysis: ﬁrst, in
designating “deep structures” as the foundation of language it makes internal, unconscious mental phenomena
the determinant of meaning; and, second, it assumes that the expressions we use can be transformed, or reduced,
into more primitive units which form the “building blocks” of expression.

14
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
we can best express ourselves in ordinary language. This means that our best means
of articulating what we want from an information system is with our ordinary, everyday
language. When we “reduce” a searcher’s information request, stated in ordinary language,
to a set of search terms, some loss or distortion of the searcher’s meaning must inevitably
result.
5. Our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares,
of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and
this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight, regular streets and
uniform houses. [PI §18]
One of Wittgenstein’s most compelling metaphors is of language being like a city. We live
in our language in the same way that we live in our cities. We ﬁnd our way about our cities
by doing things, that is, by engaging in our day-to-day activities. It is through the conduct
of such day-to-day activities that we learn our way about a city, and it is through the conduct
of day-to-day activities that we learn our way about our language. It is also the case that
a large city offers many alternative routes for going from one place to another. Similarly,
language offers us many alternative ways to say the same thing. The city, no matter how
large, can also exist quite efﬁciently without any kind of central planner or controller. The
day-to-day local interactions within cities even as large as New York are sufﬁcient to keep
the whole functioning, and, although the city, at any time, contains only a limited supply
of essentials such as food, it never runs out, even during major disruptive events—snow
storms, labor strikes, power outages, etc. Likewise, language needs no central authority to
control usage, it needs only the day-to-day interactions of its native speakers to establish
and retain its meaning [See the section “Language as a City” in Part II for a more detailed
discussion of this metaphor.].
Relevance to Information Systems: The language of information systems is like a city,
too, in the following ways: like a city, it is constantly evolving and changing in response
to the activities that it serves; like a city, there is no need for central planning if the day-
to-day interactions of searchers can provide feedback about how language is used, that
is, if searchers can learn the correct usages of search terms from day-to-day searches on
the system. The meaning of search terms or descriptions of information emerges from the
day-to-day interactions of users.
6. But how many kinds of sentences are there? Say assertion, question, and
command?—There are countless kinds; countless different kinds of use of what we
call “symbols” “words,” “sentences.” And this multiplicity is not something ﬁxed,
given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say,
come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten.28 [PI §23]
28Wittgenstein’s quotation continues:
“Here the term ‘language-game’ is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part
of an activity, or of a form of life.
Review the multiplicity of language-games in the following examples, and in others:
Giving orders, and obeying them—
Describing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements—

Part I: Introduction
15
Language does not work in just one way. Wittgenstein begins PI with a quotation from
the medieval philosopher Augustine who believed that language worked in just one way:
words stood for “objects,” and language was taught by pointing to the objects that words
“stood for.” Subsequent theorists have assumed a more subtle version of Augustine’s view
holding that words stand for “ideas” (Locke) and that the meaning of a word must be
somehow “pointed out” or explained to the person who wants to understand it. But for
Wittgenstein, language is so diverse that there are uncountable different ways in which it
can be used—language works in different ways in different activities or practices. Expres-
sions can be used to “point things out,” but they can also be used ironically, sarcastically,
or metaphorically. Language is not used primarily to assert facts, as Frege, Russell and the
early Wittgenstein, in TLP, believed, but can be used to make a promise, tell a joke, order
someone to do something, to lie, to exaggerate, to collude, to elaborate, to tell a story,
declare war, or to do any of an uncountable number of things.29 Each of these uses involves
using words or expressions in different ways, and ﬁts in to the needs of many kinds of
activities or practices [Wittgenstein’s critique of the Augusintean view of language will
be presented in more detail in Part III].
Relevance to Information Systems: The words used in information systems to represent
information are not just a collection of “labels” that are somehow linked to information
content, like Augustine’s notion that words were names for objects. In information systems,
like language in general, language is not used in just one way. An index term can describe
the intellectual content of information, like a subject description, but it can also link the
information to activities or practices. It can be used to assert the quality of the information,
to link information to other related information, to describe how the information has been
used (as a contract, a directive, a declaration, etc.), or it can name various contextual
information such as the author(s) of the text, the date it was published, the source of the

29This assertion that language works in a multitude of ways runs counter to Searle’s theory of “speech acts.”
He takes issue speciﬁcally with Wittgenstein’s claim, in paragraph 23 of PI (see previous footnote) that there
are “countless different kinds” of “symbols, words, sentences” [J.R. Searle. Speech Acts, An Essay in the
Philosophy of Language. Cambridge University Press, NY, 1969]. But Searle’s speech acts are based on John
Austin’s “illocutionary acts,” and Austin is quite clear that there are many more kinds of illocutionary acts
than the few he names. Austin, like Wittgenstein, insisted on the great multiplicity of usage types—that is,
illocutionary verbs—in natural language, though he limited their number to between 1,000 and 10,000 [Austin.
How to Do Things With Words, p. 150, n. 1. Oxford, 1962.]. Searle, in contrast, limits the number of different
kinds of Speech Acts to fewer than ten.

text (a magazine, journal, book, etc.) or the type of document it is (published article, report,
minutes of a meeting, evaluation, white paper, regulation, etc.). The number of ways that
index terms can be used is similar to the number of ways that the information represented
by the terms can be used.
7. Many words . . . then don’t have a strict meaning. But this is not a defect. To think
it is would be like saying that the light of my reading lamp is no real light at all
because it has no sharp boundary. [BB p. 27]
One of the clearest breaks that Wittgenstein had with his “old way of thinking” in the
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (TLP) was over the “determinacy of sense.” The early
Wittgenstein, along with his mentors Frege and Russell, believed that for language to be
useful in philosophical analysis it must have a “strict determinacy of sense,” that is, each
word must have a precise, unambiguous “sense,” or meaning, that was independent of
context, and would hold for all its possible uses. In the Tractatus Wittgenstein was even
more insistent on the importance of the “determinacy of sense” in language—he felt that
“sense” in language had to be determinate for language to be possible at all:
The requirement that simple signs be possible is the requirement that sense be
determinate. [TLP §3.23]
This is a natural consequence of the belief that language was used primarily to assert
facts or make propositions. Facts are generally precise and unambiguous and stay this way
regardless of the context in which they appear. So, if language asserts facts, then it should
be as precise and unambiguous as the facts it represents. Ordinary language, of course, is
not like this, as Frege and Russell saw.30 Consequently, they believed, ordinary language
could not be used for the precise kinds of philosophical analysis—the clariﬁcation of
propositions, or statements of fact—that Frege and Russell wanted to systematize. This
was the reason for their insistence on constructing a language of philosophical analysis that
did not have the indeterminacy of ordinary language. The exemplar of the kind of language
they wanted was formal logic. In logic, as in other formal systems such as arithmetic, the
symbols do have a strict determinacy of sense—a logical or mathematical symbol, once
deﬁned, means the same thing regardless of what equation or “phrase” it is used in.
This is why logic was the model for the philosophical language Frege and Russell deemed
necessary for analysis. In his early work, Wittgenstein believed, too, that ordinary language
lacked the necessary strict determinacy of sense for philosophical analysis, but he differed
from Frege and Russell about how to mitigate this indeterminacy of language. In the TLP,
Wittgenstein argued that we didn’t need another language to do philosophy, we just needed
to be more careful about our use of ordinary language. In short, ordinary language clearly
makes sense most of the time, so it must have an underlying logical order. The ambiguity
of language is an illusion, Wittgenstein asserted, we just need to bring out this underlying
logical order, the strict determinacy of sense, of language. What Wittgenstein saw later was
that language did not get its determinacy from some underlying logical order. Like logic, its
“crystalline purity” was “not a result of investigation, it was a requirement.” Wittgenstein
grew to see that “Many words. . . then don’t have a strict meaning. But this is not a defect.”
30As Russell wrote in the his introduction to Wittgenstein’s TLP: “In practice, language is always more or less
vague, so that what we assert is never quite precise.” [TLP, p. x]

Part I: Introduction

(supra) Language can be as determinate as necessary. To see the indeterminacy as a defect
is to look at ordinary language as if it were a kind of formal calculus, which it is not.
We can make language very precise if we want, not by bringing out some kind of hidden
logical underpinning, but by looking at the context, circumstances and practices in which
language is used. In Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein takes a ﬁnal jab at Frege’s
insistence on a strict determinacy of sense in language:
Frege compares a concept to an area and says that an area with vague boundaries
cannot be called an area at all. This presumably means that we cannot do anything
with it.—But is it senseless to say: “Stand roughly there?” Suppose that I were
standing with someone in a city square and said that. As I say it I do not draw
any kind of boundary, but perhaps point with my hand—as if I were indicating a
particular spot. [PI §71]
Wittgenstein’s analogy between the meaning of words and the boundary of the light from
his reading lamp (supra) is particularly apropos. The determinacy of sense, or precision
of meaning, needs only to be as strict as is necessary for the task at hand—there is no
absolute level of determinacy to which all language aspires. In the same way, a light
doesn’t have a single standard of brightness, it only needs to be bright enough for the task
at hand. To decry the ambiguity of individual word meaning is to apply the requirements
of a particular Language Game, scientiﬁc discourse, for example, to all language. This, of
course, is exactly what Russell did, since he claimed that the purpose of philosophy was
to clarify scientiﬁc assertions about facts.
Relevance to Information Systems. As we will see in Part III, the “determinacy of sense”
is one of the central issues of Information Systems. In fact, we can line up different kinds of
information systems along a spectrum of their respective determinacies of representation.
At one extreme we have data base management systems which provide access to highly
determinate information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and account balances.
Such data items are unambiguous and stay pretty much the same regardless of the context
in which they appear. At the other end of the determinacy spectrum would be a document
retrieval system which provides access to the “intellectual content” of a large collection of
documents many of which deal with similar topics. Here, a retrieval request for a document
detailing the “reasons for the failure of the Marxist economic model” might be very hard
to make without retrieving too many or too few documents (imagine devising a search
query to do this for use with an Internet Search Engine). This issue of the determinacy of
sense in Information Systems will be central to the discussion of Part III.
8. We want to establish an order in our knowledge of the use of language: an order
with a particular end in view; one of many possible orders; not the order. [PI §132]
Although Wittgenstein was concerned with identifying errors in our use of language, his
goal was to correct philosophical mistakes that arose because of errors in language, not
to correct errors in ordinary usage or to create a separate, more precise, ideal language.
Although Wittgenstein felt that philosophers needed to be reminded of their “diseases
of thinking” which arise from the misuse of language, he believed that ordinary native
speakers of a language needed no such reminders.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Relevance to Information Systems: Similarly to ordinary language, the language of
representationininformationsystemsdoesnotaspire,intheoryorinpractice,tosomeideal
language.Aswithordinarylanguage,theprincipalcriterionofqualityforasearchlanguage
is whether or not its users, that is, searchers, can use it to ﬁnd what they want. It is also the
case that, like ordinary language, the language of information representation and searching
is not a ﬁxed entity, but changes insofar as the uses for the information that it provides
access to change. Further, just as Wittgenstein insisted that ordinary language usage is
the ﬁnal arbiter in questions of meaning, even philosophical meaning, ordinary language
usage will likewise be the ﬁnal arbiter in questions of meaning about search requests and
information representations. Speciﬁcally, ordinary language is the best medium for us to
express our information needs, and any subset of ordinary language that may be used as
an access language to an information system will be correspondingly less effective than
ordinary language for searching. This poses a particular problem in information systems,
namely, that if ordinary language is the best medium in which to express our information
requirements,thencomputerizedinformationsystems,withwhichwecannotinteractusing
our ordinary means of expression, will constrain our ability to express our information
requirements.31 It may mean also that the best content-retrieval systems, in general, are
thosewhichcanunderstandthesubtlemeaningsandnuancesofinformationrequestsstated
in ordinary language. At this point, only experienced search intermediaries can do this.
9. My method is not to sunder the hard from the soft, but to see the hardness of the
soft. [NB p. 44]
Ordinary language, and the practices and activities of which they are a part are our
primary references for meaning, even philosophical meaning. The “softness” of meaning
in ordinary language cannot be improved by the “hardness” of logic. We don’t need a
separate more determinate language to eliminate the indeterminacies in meaning, we just
need to be more careful about how we use language. Further, no such more determinate
language is possible since there can be no single comprehensive notion of the determinacy
of sense applicable to all uses of language in all contexts and circumstances.32 The
determinacy of sense is not a property of individual words, but a function of how those
words are used, and can be inﬂuenced by the context and circumstances in which they
are used or the backgrounds and experience of the participants. The same word can have
different levels of determinacy in different usages. More importantly, Wittgenstein saw
that when issues of meaning in language come up, as they did frequently in philosophy,
the ﬁnal arbiter of linguistic meaning is not philosophical analysis, but ordinary usage.33
In fact, many of the problems of analytic philosophy arose, Wittgenstein believed, because
31While there has been work in the ﬁelds of Computer Science and Artiﬁcial Intelligence to build natural-
language front ends to information systems (most commonly, to data base systems where the language, as we
have said, is more precise), none of these operates in a fully conversational mode that would be comparable to
the kind of semantically rich and complex conversation that an inquirer might have with a reference librarian in
a research library.
32The notion of the determinacy of sense and its problems is the focus of a major portion of PI beginning with
§65.
33“When I talk about language (words, sentences, etc.) I must speak the language of every day. Is this language
somehow too coarse and material for what we want to say? Then how is another one to be constructed?—And
how strange that we should be able to do anything at all with the one we have!” [PI §120]. Wittgenstein’s question
is, of course, rhetorical.

Part I: Introduction
19
philosophers forgot these quotidian constituents of linguistic meaning. Language that has
lost its connection to ordinary usage can indeed “bewitch” us.34 Language leads us into
some of these difﬁculties so frequently and predictably, that Wittgenstein called these
systematic errors “diseases of thinking.”35
In particular, Wittgenstein disagreed with Frege and Russell’s belief that, in general, logic
would form a better, more precise, foundation for linguistic expression—that language
somehow aspired to the “crytaline purity of logic.” Wittgenstein came to see that the
“rough ground”36 of ordinary language, as it is caught up in the “hurly-burly”37 of day-to-
day usage, gives us more precision in meaning than philosophers had previously thought
possible. This is not a despairing observation, in fact, Wittgenstein reminded his readers
that it is surprising how well ordinary language works:
We are under the illusion that what is peculiar, profound, essential, in our investi-
gation, resides in its trying to grasp the incomparable essence of language. That is,
the order existing between the concepts of proposition, word, proof, truth experi-
ence, and so on. This order is a super-order between—so to speak—super-concepts.
Whereas, of course, if the words “language,” “experience,” “world,” have a use, it
must be as humble a one as that of the words “table,” “lamp,” “door.”
On the one hand it is clear that every sentence in our language “is in order as
it is.” That is to say, we are not striving after an ideal, as if our ordinary vague
sentences had not yet got a quite unexceptionable sense, and a perfect language
awaited construction by us.—On the other hand it seems clear that where there
is sense there must be perfect order.—So there must be perfect order even in the
vaguest sentence. [PI §§97–98]
Relevance to Information Systems: The language of an information system is often
created by system designers as they build the system, in much the same way that logi-
cians such as Frege and Russell proposed constructing logical languages to be used in
philosophical analysis. Like them, system designers often despair that ordinary language
is not precise enough to be useful as a language for content searching, especially on large
text or image retrieval systems. But while the language of an information system may
be a subset of ordinary language, and its uses may differ, the system designer should not
overlook the fact that there may be more precision in ordinary language than he may at
ﬁrst think. In particular, there are often contextual aspects of language that can be used
to provide better access to available information. One of the great dangers of building
computerized information systems is that the computer seems to give us a precision in
34“Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.” [PI §109]
35“There is a kind of general disease of thinking which always looks for (and ﬁnds) what would be called a
mental state from which all our acts spring as from a reservoir.” [BB p. 143]
36“The more narrowly we examine language, the sharper becomes the conﬂict between it and our requirement.
(For the crystaline purity of logic was, of course, not a result of investigation; it was a requirement.) The conﬂict
becomes intolerable; the requirement is now in danger of becoming empty.—We have got onto slippery ice
where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are
unable to walk. We want to walk; so we need friction. Back to the rough ground!” [PI §107]
37“How could human behavior be described? Surely only by showing the action of a variety of humans, as they
are all mixed up together. Not what one person is doing now, but the whole hurly-burly, is the background against
which we see an action, and it determines our judgement, our concepts, and our reactions.” [RPP II §629]

20
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
access that is not possible in non-computerized systems. As Wittgenstein remarked about
logic, “the crystalline purity of logic was, of course, not a result of investigation; it was
a requirement.” Some of this belief that the precision of a computer confers an advan-
tage in searching is due to a confusion between physical access and intellectual access.
Physical access consists of the means by which a computer locates and retrieves informa-
tion whose precise address is known, while intellectual access consists of the means by
which certain information is determined to be what a particular inquirer will be satisﬁed
with, having submitted a speciﬁc query to the information system. Computers can give
us rapid, precise physical access, no matter how complex the search requirements are, as
long as they are decidable. But rapid, precise physical access does not always guarantee
rapid, precise intellectual access, because in some situations, such as with text or image
retrieval, the speciﬁc item(s) of information that will satisfy an inquirer often remain(s)
an open question during the search. Of course, in data retrieval, where the descriptions of
available information—addresses, phone numbers, account balances, etc.—are quite pre-
cise, then improvements in physical access can improve intellectual access. Where does
this misconception about precision in language come from? For Frege and Russell, formal
logic was the model for all language, leading them to believe that the precision of logical
propositions could be attained for any semantic meaning. In the same way, information
systems designers have often assumed that the precision of representation and retrieval of
a data retrieval system—one that provides access to, for example, names, addresses and
phone numbers—is attainable in text or image retrieval systems where the searchers are
looking for items with speciﬁc intellectual content. But it is clear that, as Wittgenstein
states, “. . . every sentence in our language ‘is in order as it is’ ” (supra). If there is no better
way to express ourselves than in ordinary language, then it is also evident that the farther
away from ordinary usage that we get, the less likely we are to express ourselves well.
Insofar as information systems employ means of expression different than our ordinary
means of expression, our ability to express our information needs will be impoverished.
Currently, the only “information system” that uses the full range of expression of our
ordinary language is another human being.
10. One of the most dangerous of ideas for a philosopher is, oddly enough, that we
think with our heads or in our heads.
The idea of thinking as a process in the head, in a completely enclosed space, gives
him something occult. [Z §§605–606]
Thinking and meaning are not entities that have simple “locations” in the way that the
anatomical parts of the brain have physical places. Our thinking is frequently assisted
by implements that exist outside of our skulls: Much information that we use does not
exist “in our heads” but in books, audio tapes, computer data bases, the notes we make to
ourselves and the people with whom we interact. In some instances, our ability to think
may require a calculator, a computer spread-sheet, or just pencil and paper. This sort of
augmentation of the human intellect has been called “scaffolding,” and will be discussed
in Part III.
If our thought processes must sometimes be assisted by implements and information
storage media that are external to our heads, then there can be no comprehensive

21
psychophysical parallelism. In other words, brain processes cannot always be complete
explanations of mental processes. As Wittgenstein put it:
No supposition seems to me more natural than that there is no process in the brain
correlated with associating or with thinking; so that it would be impossible to read
off thought-processes from brain-processes. [Z §608]
Hilary Putnam came to a similar conclusion in his “Twin Earth” thought-experiment. There
he claimed that “meaning” in language was not something that was entirely mental. As
he put it so succinctly, “Cut the pie any way you like, ‘meanings’ just ain’t in the head!”38
(The “Twin Earth” thought experiment is described in the text surrounding footnote 247,
infra)
Relevance to Information Systems: The idea that we think “in our heads” is misleading in
thefollowingsense:itimpliesthateverythingweneedinordertothinkiseitherinourheads
or potentially so. This can make us disregard how important the context that surrounds
us is, and how our circumstances and the implements we use to assist our thinking may
be essential to our thought processes—in short, the boundaries of “the mind” are broader
than the boundaries of the skull. The purely cognitive, context-free notion of the mind
where all thought takes place entirely within our heads may lead us to believe that, like our
own minds, everything that we need for retrieval, that is, for understanding the meaning
of information and its representations, can be put into the information system.39 We will
discuss this in more detail in Part II (“Psychophysical Parallelism”), in particular, the
claim of some epistemologists that we are a “brain in a vat” and “everything we need to
represent the world” can be in our heads. The “brain in a vat” metaphor leads us to think of
the mind as separate from its milieu, taking from it what it needs for understanding in the
form empirical data and abstractions. This can lead us to believe that everything we need
to search for or make sense of the information we search through can be contained within
the information system itself—that the context or circumstances in which the information
system exists or the background and intentions of the searchers and system designers
impart no additional meaning to, or interpretation of, the information which exists on the
system. This is a “disease of thinking” that Wittgenstein speciﬁcally argued against:
There is a kind of general disease of thinking which always looks for (and ﬁnds)
what would be called a mental state from which all our acts spring as from a
reservoir. [BB p. 143]

39This analogy is implicit in the model ﬁrst proposed by Hilary Putnam where the mind is related to the brain
in the way that a computer program is related to the hardware of a computer. This view came to be known
as “Functionalism.” As he described it, “The proper way to think of the brain is as a digital computer. Our
psychology is to be described as the software of this computer—its ‘functional organization.’ ” Putnam has come
to reject this view, as he discusses in his more recent work, Representation and Reality, in the chapter “Why
Functionalism Didn’t Work,” MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991. Interestingly, one of the reasons he now rejects
functionalism is the same conclusion he reached in his “Twin Earth” thought experiment, namely, that “meanings
ain’t ‘in the head’.” In other words, if our thoughts and their “meaning” cannot be understood without reference
to context and circumstances, then in general, thoughts cannot exist as independent, context-free entities. But the
very nature of a computer program is that it is context-free and, like an expression of formal logic, its “meaning”
is wholly self-contained. The mind lacks this kind of context-free closure.

22
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The view that the mind, or an information system, can hold everything which it needs to
represent, and thereby understand, the world is a view with which this manuscript will
explicitly take issue, starting with our discussion of “scaffolding,” in Part III.
11. Let’s not imagine the meaning as an occult connection the mind makes between
a word and a thing, and that this connection contains the whole usage of a word as
the seed might be said to contain the tree. [BB pp. 73–74]
Words don’t stand for objects, nor do they “have meanings” when “meaning” refers to
something separate and deﬁnite that a word is somehow linked to, and to which we must
refer when we want to understand the word in question. We do talk of the “meanings” of
words, but this is a kind of language game that should not be taken to grant the ontological
status of meanings as independent entities to which words and expressions are linked.
Wittgenstein is breaking away from two powerful traditions in the study of language:
First, by saying that words don’t have meanings to which they are somehow linked, he
breaks with the “referential” view of language, a tradition in the study of language that
reaches back at least to Aristotle.40 Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, Wittgenstein
also broke with the tradition of language study that insists that meaning is something
that is either deﬁnite, or aspires to a deﬁniteness that is a sine qua non of understanding.
Wittgenstein writes:
If a pattern of life is the basis for the use of a word then the word must contain
some amount of indeﬁniteness. The pattern of life, after all, is not one of exact
regularity.41 [LWPP I §211]
40Hilary Putnam spells out the intellectual antecedents of meaning and reference, and its persistence:
. . . Aristotle was the ﬁrst thinker to theorize in a systematic way about meaning and reference.
In De Interpretatione he laid out a scheme which has proved remarkably robust. According
to this scheme, when we understand a word or any other “sign,” we associate that word with a
“concept.” This concept determines what the word refers to. Two millenia later, one can ﬁnd
the same theory in John Stuart Mill’s Logic, and in the present century one ﬁnds variants of
this picture in the writings of Bertrand Russell, Gottlob Frege, Rudolph Carnap, and many
other important philosophers. [Representation and Reality, p. 19. MIT Press, 1991.]
Wittgenstein found a clear statement of this referential view of meaning in the writings of Augustine, and
spends much of the early part of his Philosophical Investigations presenting and criticizing it. We will cover
Wittgenstein’s explicit rejection of the Augustinian model of language in Part III.
41The idea that words must have precisely deﬁned meanings is a view that was central to Frege’s philosophy. As
we have discussed, this was a view that Wittgenstein was sympathetic to early in his work, and was apparent in
TLP. In PI he made quite clear that he no longer held this view:
“But is a blurred concept a concept at all?”—Is an indistinct photograph a picture of a person at all? Is it even
always an advantage to replace an indistinct picture by a sharp one? Isn’t the indistinct one often exactly what
we need?
Frege compares a concept to an area and says that an area with vague boundaries cannot be called an area at all.
This presumably means that we cannot do anything with it.—But is it senseless to say: “Stand roughly there?”
Suppose that I were standing with someone in a city square and said that. As I say it I do not draw any kind of
boundary, but perhaps point with my hand—as if I were indicating a particular spot. [PI §71]

Part I: Introduction
23
One of the cornerstones of the analytic philosophy of Frege, Russell and the early Wittgen-
stein was what they referred to as the “strict determinacy of sense.” The “sense” or meaning
of a word, they insisted, must be completely “determinate,” or unambiguous, in order to
be used in philosophical analysis. If the meanings of words were not completely deter-
minate, then statements using those words would be indeterminate, since they believed
that the meaning of a sentence was composed of the meanings of its words. Thus, any
philosophical analysis that used those statements would be intolerably uncertain. This
need for a strict determinacy of sense was what made logic and the scientiﬁc method so
appealing to Frege, Russell and the early Wittgenstein, and why they, in particular, Russell,
believed that the clarity and certainty of philosophical analysis could only be assured if
its language had the strict determinacy of sense that logic and science seemed to have.
Since they believed that ordinary language could never have the determinacy of sense
necessary for philosophical analysis, ordinary language could never be the language of
philosophy. The clarity of meaning necessary in language could only be brought out by
logical analysis. But the reassessment and ultimate rejection of this position is one of the
clearest breaks which Wittgenstein made with his early work—what he was to call his “old
way of thinking” [PI preface, p. ix]. The “strict determinacy of sense” that Frege, Russell
and early Wittgenstein believed necessary for philosophy was a false ideal. In the ﬁrst
place, precision in meaning is not a property of words but may vary in different circum-
stances. Some language uses don’t require an ideal precision of meaning: when I make
the statement that “The birds are eating all the raspberries that I planted.” the meaning
that I intend to convey by this statement is perfectly understandable even though the word
“birds” is not strictly determinate, in Frege’s sense, because it is not clear which, of the
thousands of species of birds, it refers to. There is no absolute standard of precision in
meaning. Furthermore, when clarity of expression is required, ordinary language can be
just as precise as formal logic can, it just gets its clarity in a different manner—not from
truth tables and rules like the “excluded middle,” as logic does, but from the context and
circumstances, what Wittgenstein would call “Language Games” and “Forms of Life,”
in which the statement was uttered. If meanings don’t have some separate, independent
existence, and the meanings of the words we use are, in many ways, indeﬁnite, how do
we manage to understand each other as well as we do? In many cases, the ambiguity of a
statement or a word is resolved by the context or circumstances in which it was uttered or
written—in fact, when we are in particular circumstances the ambiguity of a word simply
doesn’t come up: If I am with a friend at a baseball game and he remarks that “The pitcher
looks great!” I know he is not commenting on the aesthetic quality of a water container—
the ambiguity of the word “pitcher” simply doesn’t arise.42 Here, the word still conveys
what its speaker intended, in spite of its seeming ambiguity.
Relevance to Information Systems: If the indeﬁniteness of words or expressions is
resolved by a consideration of their context or circumstances of occurrence, then it is no
great intellectual leap to see that the indeﬁniteness of the language of representation and
42Part of the purpose of Wittgenstein’s admonition to not ask for the meaning of a word, but to ask for its use,
is to get us away from the ambiguity that often comes up when we ask for the meaning of a word. That is,
words can often seem ambiguous when we try to deﬁne them, but, and this is Wittgenstein’s key point, the same
words don’t seem ambiguous when we use them in our daily activities and practices. It is perfectly consistent
for someone to use a word correctly without being able to give a precise deﬁnition of it.

24
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
searching used by information systems might be resolved in a similar manner. This means
that information systems are not context free but are situated in an important and essential
way. They are inﬂuenced by the context and circumstances of their use, in particular, they
must be considered part of the common activities and practices in which they are used, and
an understanding of these activities and practices may be necessary for the full potential
of an information system to be exploited. We will pursue this in greater detail in Part III.
The determinacy of sense is one of the central issues of Information Systems. In fact, we
can line up different kinds of information systems along a spectrum of their respective
determinacy of representation. At one extreme we have data base management systems
which provide access to highly determinate information such as names, addresses, phone
numbers, credit limits and account balances. Such data items are unambiguous and stay
pretty much the same regardless of the context they appear in. At the other end of the
determinacy spectrum would be a document retrieval system which provides access to the
“intellectual content” of a large collection of documents many of which deal with similar
topics.43 Here, it might be very hard to come up with a formal retrieval request for a
document that retrieves neither too many nor too few documents (imagine formulating a
search query for use by an Internet Search Engine to retrieve documents discussing the
“impact of computer technology on modern management”). This issue of the determinacy
of sense in Information Systems will be central to the discussion of Part III.
12. For remember that in general we don’t use language according to strict rules—it
hasn’t been taught us by means of strict rules either. We, in our discussions on the
other hand, constantly compare language with a calculus proceeding according to
exact rules.
This is a very one-sided way of looking at language. In practice we very rarely use
language as such a calculus. For not only do we not think of the rules of usage—
of deﬁnitions, etc.—while using language, but when we are asked to give such
rules, in most cases we aren’t able to do so. We are unable clearly to circumscribe
the concepts we use; not because we don’t know their real deﬁnition, but because
there is no real “deﬁnition” to them. To suppose that there must be would be like
supposing that whenever children play with a ball they play a game according to
strict rules. [BB p. 25]
In a calculus the meanings of the words/symbols do not vary from context to context, and
their use is governed by the application of a strict, ﬁnite set of rules. Language is not like
this. The idea of language being like a calculus fails in at least two ways: (1) Meaning in
language is dependent on more than just the words and the placement of those words in a
sentence. The meaning of an expression can vary according to context, circumstances, tone
of voice, etc.44 Yet, clearly, this is not the case with the symbols of a calculus; these must
43Don Swanson has pointed out [personal communication] that searching for intellectual content on a document
collection of texts dealing with similar topics (what he called a “homogeneous” collection) is much more
demanding than searching for intellectual content on a document collection of texts dealing with many disparate
topics. An example of a topically homogeneous collection would be the articles on medical research included in
the Medline retrieval system. A topically heterogeneous collection might be a collection of newspaper articles
published in a major newspaper during a particular span of time.

mean the same thing in all contexts. (2) No set of rules can determine how an expression
could be used in all contexts and all circumstances since there are an indeﬁnitely large
number of possible circumstances and contexts, and the rules must not only specify how
the expression should be used, there must also be meta-rules which specify when the rules
of usage are applicable and when they are not. The rules would have to provide for new
or metaphorical uses of the expression, as well.
Relevance to Information Systems: Index and search terms do not have ﬁxed meanings
that are invariant from system to system. Most obviously, the extension of a particu-
lar index term—the information, for example, documents or images, which it actually
represents—will vary from system to system since different systems will often contain
different information. Even within one system the extension of index terms can vary over
time, as the coverage of the collection changes—when, for example, new information is
added, and previously stored information is removed. And, even when the same document
is assigned index terms by different experienced indexers, they often disagree in the terms
they select to represent the intellectual content.45
Computerized information systems are largely composed of complex assemblages of com-
puterprograms.Butifweconsiderthekindsofcomputerprogramsthataremostsuccessful,
they often have the properties of a calculus: they contain relatively context-free variables
that are governed by strict rules that can be precisely speciﬁed in a program. Computers, in
general, do not handle context well so any rules or meaning that are dependent on context
or circumstances outside of the computer will not be represented well on a computerized
system. So if information systems are dependent on language, and language is context-
dependent and not governed by strict rules, then there will often be something Procrustean
about computerizing the search processes of certain information systems—those that pro-
vide access to content. It means that when using the system to ﬁnd relatively context-free
information, such as news releases that mention certain proper names or dates, then a
computerized system may confer some advantages over a non-computerized one. But
when looking for information that has a particular “intellectual content” or meaning—for
example, “advice for investing in Central European service industries”—computerized
systems, by themselves, may lack the necessary ability to provide precise intellectual ac-
cess, especially if the amount of information searched through is large and comparatively
homogeneous, and the amount of relevant information is comparatively small.
Computers are, fundamentally, “logical machines” and the attempt to get them to handle
language in “meaningful” ways is similar to philosophers’ attempts to represent meaning in
language using formal logic. As we pointed out earlier, this was an effort that Wittgenstein
participated in early in his career, when he supported the work of Frege and Russell. But
he soon became disillusioned with this work, saying, in the Philosophical Investigations:
“John STOLE the money?” (i.e., I thought he earned the money but it turned out he stole it.)
“John stole the MONEY?” (i.e., he was supposed to steal the jewelry, but he stole the money instead.)
“JOHN stole the money?” (i.e., I thought Matt stole the money, but it turned out that John was the one who
stole it.)

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The more narrowly we examine actual language, the sharper becomes the conﬂict
between it and our requirement. (For the crystalline purity of logic was, of course,
not a result of investigation: it was a requirement.) [PI §107]
Here, Wittgenstein makes clear that the formal rigor—the “crystalline purity”—of logic
and, by inference, computers, is not the “result” of an “investigation” that uncovers some
underlying formal structure of language. The formal rigor is a “requirement” for doing
logic in the ﬁrst place. Similarly, computers don’t give us access to an underlying formal
semantic model of language, they require that language be transformed into a formal
model as a prerequisite for automation. Only the formal, context-free aspects of language,
such as the location and tabulation of word occurrences, will ﬁt this model. The more
complex semantic and pragmatic aspects of language will be difﬁcult to express in the
“crystalline purity” of logic and computers. Wittgenstein continues:
We see that what we call “sentence” and “language” has not the formal unity that
I imagined, but is the family of structures more or less related to one another.—
But what becomes of logic now? Its rigour seems to be giving way here.—But
in that case doesn’t logic altogether disappear?—For how can it lose its rigor? Of
course not by our bargaining any of its rigor out of it.—The preconceived idea of
crystalline purity can only be removed by turning our whole examination round.
(One might say: the axis of reference of our examination must be rotated, but about
the ﬁxed point of our real need.) [PI §108]
How should we turn “our whole examination round?” Wittgenstein expresses it best when
he says:
. . . we don’t start from certain words, but from certain occasions or activities.
[LC p. 3]
This could be interpreted to mean that reasonably large computerized information sys-
tems for accessing intellectual content are doomed to failure. This is not the case. When
computers work with relatively determinate, context-free information—names, addresses,
phone or social security numbers—like most data base management systems do, they can
be very precise and efﬁcient tools of retrieval. And when text retrieval systems are used
to retrieve documents that mention speciﬁc context-free words like proper names or dates
(e.g., when retrieving news articles about a speciﬁc person), they too can be extremely
precise and useful. Or, when the document collection to which they provide access is
comparatively small and the documents are all about different subjects, or the searchers
are not very demanding, retrieval can be frequently successful. But when someone wants
to retrieve text containing certain speciﬁc intellectual content from a large, homogeneous
document collection, and that content is not associated with a precise context-free repre-
sentation, such as a proper name or a speciﬁc date, then retrieval will be more problematic.
This is why the retrieval of information with a speciﬁc intellectual content has been called
an inherently “trial-and-error process.”46

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophy
of Language and Mind
“I am convinced, Yorick,” continued my father, half reading and half discoursing,
“that there is a northwest passage to the intellectual world; and that the soul of
man has shorter ways of going to work, in furnishing itself with knowledge and
instruction, than we generally take with it.”
—Lawrence Sterne, Tristram Shandy
Describing Wittgenstein’s philosophy is a daunting endeavor. His currently published
works span 15 volumes, only one of which, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus47 was
published in his lifetime. Of the rest, only Philosophical Investigations and The Blue
and Brown Books48 beneﬁted from any comprehensive editorial efforts by Wittgenstein
himself. The rest, from Zettel49 to, most recently, Last Writings on the Philosophy of
Psychology, v. II50 have been put together from Wittgenstein’s Nachlass, his literary es-
tate, by a number of individuals.51 These may not be the last publications coming from

to as PI]. NB The Blue and Brown Books proﬁted from Wittgenstein’s editing, but they were notes for the use
of his students and were not meant for publication. There is some indication that Wittgenstein considered the
Brown Book as the preliminary notes for a possible book, but it was never carried further than that. Much of
the Blue and Brown Books was revised and incorporated into PI. [The Blue and Brown Books. Harper, New
York, 1976]. Hereafter referred to as BB.

51“Wittgenstein bequeathed in his literary estate an unusually complex body of work, with no adequate indi-
cations as to which manuscripts should be published and how, nor indeed, with the exception of the Tractatus
Logico Philosophicus, any model for doing so. His instructions were limited to the following terms in his will:
2. I Appoint my friend Mr. R. Rhees of 96 Bryn Road Swansea to be the Executor of this
my Will and I hope that he will accept ﬁfty pounds for his personal expenses in discharging
this trust. 3. I Give to Mr. R. Rhees, Miss G.E.M. Anscombe and Professor G.H. von Wright
of Trinity College Cambridge all the copyright in all my unpublished writings and also the
manuscripts and typescripts thereof to dispose of as they think best but subject to any claim
by anybody else to the custody of the manuscripts and typescripts. I intend and desire that Mr.
Rhees Miss Anscombe and Professor von Wright shall publish as many of my unpublished
writings as they think ﬁt but I do not wish them to incur expenses in publication which they
do not expect to recoup out of royalties or other proﬁts”
[Ludwig Wittgenstein, Vienna Edition, p. 52, Introduction. Springer-Verlag, Wien, New York, 1993. Edited by
Michael Nedo.]
Although the books published after Wittgenstein’s death were put together from his Nachlass by his former
students, these selections have not been made without disagreement. A description of the major points of
27

his unpublished writings, either. But while most of the editors who have put together these
works were personal friends and students of Wittgenstein himself, future publications will
be unlikely to proﬁt from that advantage. Although Wittgenstein focused his philosophical
work on many speciﬁc themes, the published works themselves do not separate his writ-
ings into categories—Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics52 contains many
remarks on language as well as mathematics, Philosophical Investigations contains re-
marks on philosophy in addition to mathematics, logic and psychology, and Remarks on
the Philosophy of Psychology, v. II contains remarks on language as well as psychology.
Wittgenstein’s discussion of any given topic is spread throughout his writings, but not
collected or summarized in any one place. Successive paragraphs may deal with a speciﬁc
topic, but the topic is dropped in favor of another and picked up again, seemingly at ran-
dom, later in the work, or in another work. Certainly one of the reasons for this scattershot
approach to philosophy is that Wittgenstein was continually grappling with very deep
and elusive problems, problems that had deﬁed systematic solution by the best analytical
minds of the 20th century. So, many of his recorded comments were not solutions to these
problems, but the remnants of intellectual battles which he fought all his life (his published
writings go right up to a few days before he died, when he succumbed to a long illness).53
The careful reader may be reminded of Borges’ short story “The Garden of the Forking
Paths”54:
Ts’ui Pˆen . . . was Governor of Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel
with more characters than there are in the Hung Lou Mˆeng, and to create a maze
in which all men would lose themselves. He spent thirteen years on these oddly
assorted tasks before he was assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to
it and nobody ever found his labyrinth.
The answer comes later in the story:
At one time, Ts’ui Pˆen must have said; “I am going into seclusion to write a book,”
and at another, “I am retiring to construct a maze.” Everyone assumed these were
separate activities. No one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and
the same.
It is ironic that Wittgenstein himself uses the metaphor of the “labyrinth” to describe how
language often works:
contention appears in “The Wittgenstein Controversy” [The Atlantic Monthly, pp. 28–41, June 1997]. Michael
Nedo and the publisher Springer-Verlag have undertaken to publish the entire Nachlass of Wittgenstein—over
30,000 pages. This is the ﬁrst attempt to publish Wittgenstein’s entire work in the original order in which he left
it, thereby addressing one of the major points of contention: that the selections of Wittgenstein’s work that were
published after Philosophical Investigations were taken out of the original chronological order.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
29
Language is a labyrinth of paths. You approach from one side and know your way
about; you approach the same place from another side and no longer know your
way about. [PI §203]
To many of Wittgenstein’s readers, his books and the labyrinth of language are, like Ts’ui
Pˆen’s novel, “one and the same.” Philosophical Investigations contains not only remarks
on the labyrinth of language but it is itself an embodiment of language’s complexity.
Metaphors aside, the careful reading, not to mention the understanding, of Wittgenstein’s
thought requires unusual effort by the reader. Wittgenstein, it is clear, was aware of this
problem (from the preface of Philosophical Investigations):
The thoughts which I publish in what follows are the precipitate of philosophical
investigationswhichhaveoccupiedmeforthelastsixteenyears.Theyconcernmany
subjects . . . I have written down all these thoughts as remarks, short paragraphs,
of which there is sometimes a fairly long chain about the same subject, while I
sometimes make a sudden change, jumping from one topic to another.—It was my
intention at ﬁrst to bring all this together in a book whose form I pictured differently
at different times. But the essential thing was that the thoughts should proceed from
one subject to another in a natural order and without breaks.
After several unsuccessful attempts to weld my results together into such a whole,
I realized that I should never succeed. The best that I could write would never be
more than philosophical remarks; my thoughts were soon crippled if I tried to force
them on in any single direction against their natural inclination.—And this was, of
course, connected with the very nature of the investigation. For this compels us to
travel over a wide ﬁeld of thought criss-cross in every direction. The philosophical
remarks in this book are, as it were, a number of sketches of landscapes which were
made in the course of these long and involved journeyings. [PI pp. ix–x]
The philosopher John Searle provides a convincing explanation of this aspect of
Wittgenstein’s writings:
. . . you have the feeling when you take up one of [Wittgenstein’s] later works and
read it that it’s a bit like getting a kit for a model aeroplane [sic] with no instructions
as to how you are supposed to put all the pieces together. That also can be extremely
frustrating. Each of his later works is something of a do-it-yourself book.
Now why did he write like that?. . . I think he honestly and sincerely was struggling
to say something new and different, and he always had the feeling that he hadn’t
quite said what he really meant, that he was still struggling to ﬁnd a mode of
expression. And in his own mind, he never really succeeded. Finally, I think we
need to say for English-speaking readers that this style, though it looks strange to
Anglo-American eyes, is not so unusual in German. There is a tradition in German
philosophy of writing aphoristically. You ﬁnd it in Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and
Lichtenberg, to mention just a few.55

30
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Various keys to the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and Philosophical Investigations
have appeared in recent years,56 but the serious reader must, in the ﬁnal analysis, ﬁnd
his own way through Wittgenstein’s philosophical landscape. Like other difﬁcult and, at
ﬁrst ﬂush, seemingly jumbled intellectual works, such as Joyce’s Ulysses and Sterne’s
Tristram Shandy,57 there is an implicit methodology that guides Wittgenstein’s work,
and with understanding, can guide the reader too.58 It may be the case that Wittgenstein’s
foremost contribution to philosophy is not his critiques of philosophical views, or his
epistemology, but the method by which he achieves them—a method that is frequently
overlooked by his readers. While the subjects of his philosophical remarks in his later
writings seem to be, as we have said, random, the method by which he produces these
remarks remains consistent—though unstated—throughout his later writings. This, I think,
is the key to his statement (from the preface to PI):
I should not like my writing to spare other people the trouble of thinking. But, if
possible, to stimulate someone to thoughts of his own. [PI p. x]
Rather than explaining his methodology the way Western philosophers have done, tradi-
tionally, Wittgenstein, in these later works, shows us how to approach the various episte-
mological problems that confront us.59 The reader is like an apprentice looking over the

57A further irony is that one of Wittgenstein’s favorite books was Lawrence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy, a book
that has a similar seemingly fragmented structure as his own works. A contemporary of Wittgenstein recalled
his making the following statement: “Now a book I like greatly is Sterne’s Tristram Shandy. That is one of my
favorite books. You remember the incident where they are discussing infant prodigies, and after several have
mentioned examples, one of the company caps the lot by saying that he knew an infant who produced a work on
the day he was born. Whereupon Dr Slop replies that it should have been wiped up and nothing more said about
it. Now that you could say about a lot that is written today.” M.O’C. Drury. “Conversations with Wittgenstein,”
Recollections of Wittgenstein. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1984. Edited by R. Rhees.
58P.M.S. Hacker, one of the principal commentators on Wittgenstein’s work, made a similar observation:
. . . although the Investigations is written in brief and often apparently disconnected remarks,
although it frequently jumps from topic to topic without indicating the reasons for such
sudden transitions, and although it has seemed to many readers to be a philosophy that revels
in lack of systematicity, it is in fact . . . a highly systematic, integrated work, and anything but
a haphazard collection or aper¸cus. [Wittgenstein’s Place in Twentieth-Century Analytic
Philosophy, p. 97. Blackwell, Oxford, 1996.]
59There is some indication that Wittgenstein meant for his approach to philosophical problems to be a general
methodology to be used for the more common problems that trouble us:
Our concepts, judgements, reactions never appear in connection with just a single action, but
rather with the whole swirl of human actions. [LWPP II, p. 56]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind

shoulder of a master craftsman—a craftsman who refuses to explain his methods in any
detail but continually gives demonstrations of them.60 Wittgenstein’s writings are incom-
plete from a systematic point of view, they do not cover all the questions that might occur
to the average reader or philosopher and some of the questions he does raise he does not
answer at all. But if the reader “gets” the method that Wittgenstein demonstrates, then he
can apply it to the conceptual problems—philosophical or otherwise—that trouble him.
This was one of Wittgenstein’s goals. To rid the reader of the “diseases of thinking” that
prevent him from getting out of the intellectual dead ends in which he may ﬁnd himself.61
Since my goal in this work is to apply Wittgenstein’s later thought on language to the
problems of building and using computerized information systems—a topic Wittgenstein
obviously had nothing to say about—we must try to be clear about how this methodology
works. Because of this, I will spend some time discussing his methodology, but ﬁrst I
would like to lay the foundation for this by discussing the relation between language and
thought.62
Language and Thought
What must ﬁrst strike the reader of Wittgengstein’s later works is the apparent conﬂict be-
tween one of his goals, to cure us of our “diseases of thinking,” and his concentration on the
way we use and understand language. Traditional epistemology assumes that language is
a product of thought. As Locke wrote, “Words in their primary or immediate signiﬁcation,
stand for nothing but the ideas in the mind of him that uses them.”63 That is, we think, then
translate these thoughts into words or expressions. This, in fact, is the view Wittgenstein
held during his early work as presented in the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus. Since
We can take this to mean that even though Wittgenstein wrote about philosophical problems, he did not divorce
these problems from the broader context of human activities in which they are embedded. So a philosophical
remark has the potential to be a remark connected to the broader context of human life.
60H. Putnam comments on Wittgenstein’s method:
Mary Warnock once said that Sartre gave us not arguments or proofs but “a description so
clear and vivid that when I think of his description and ﬁt it to my own case, I cannot fail to see
its application.” It seems to me that this is a very good description of what Wittgenstein was
doing . . . over and over again in his work. [H. Putnam, p. 74.Renewing Philosophy. Harvard
University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1992.]
61For example:
There is a kind of general disease of thinking which always looks for (and ﬁnds) what would
be called a mental state from which all our acts spring as from a reservoir. [BB p. 143]
62I am well aware that by “explaining” how Wittgenstein’s methodology works I am guilty of taking a non-
Wittgesteinean approach. In my defense I would point out that Wittgenstein’s methodology is difﬁcult to grasp
if you must get it by just observing his work. Explaining it deprives the reader of this experience of discovery,
but provides him with a quicker grasp of its essentials. A “deep” understanding of Wittgenstein still requires
one to read his work in the original, and, to this end, in the following discussion I have tried to quote as many of
the relevant passages in his works as possible.

32
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
language is a product of thought by this view, it seems a difﬁcult task to examine language
and then infer how our thoughts produced these words. But, as Wittgenstein returned to
his philosophical work after World War I, he began to reassess and revise many of his early
views. Wittgenstein no longer believed that language—that is, what we say or write—was
a product of thought. He argued for a virtual Copernican reversal of this epistemological
relationship. Instead of language being a product of thought, he insisted that language is
“the vehicle of thought”—loosely, thought is a product of language:
When I think in language, there aren’t “meanings” going through my mind in
addition to the verbal expressions: the language is itself the vehicle of thought.64
[PI §329]
Or, stated somewhat differently:
Knowledge is not translated into words when it is expressed. The words are not a
translation of something else that was there before they were. [Z §191]
Obviously, not all our thought involves language, for we can surely “think about” music
or visual images without reference to language at all. The point Wittgenstein is making
is not that all thought uses language as a foundation, but that when we use language we
usually use it as a means for thinking, not as medium to translate thoughts that are already
completely formulated.65
Wittgenstein’s assertion is based, at least in part, on the observation that we frequently
speak without thinking beforehand—that is, we just speak. Since conscious thought does
not always precede speech (or writing) it follows that it is not a necessary precursor to
language use. But how is Wittgenstein to answer the objection that the reason we don’t
have to consciously think before we speak is that the prerequisite thought is unconscious
or tacit?
For Wittgenstein, we formulate our thoughts using the tools of language, in the same way
that we might say that an artist (e.g., a painter) formulates her images through the tools of
her trade—paints, brushes, canvases. The artist need not develop a mental image of what
64Max Black reports a comment by Wittgenstein:
. . . the anecdote of the girl who, on being told to “think before she spoke,” replied, “How
do I know what I think until I hear what I say?” Her situation is not unusual: one important
function of verbal expression is to reveal to the author what he thinks. He thinks in speaking
or writing: as Wittgenstein liked to say, one can think with pen as well as in one’s head. [The
Labyrinth of Language. Encyclopaedia Britannica, Frederick A. Praeger, New York, 1968.
Footnote, p. 86]
65This is not to say, either, that we never express our thoughts by means of language, for we do—think of
answering the question “What are you thinking?”
Wittgnstein makes a similar case for music:
Speech with and without thought is to be compared with the playing of a piece of music with
and without thought. [PI §341]
In other words, we don’t have to hum a tune to ourselves before we play it.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
33
she wants to paint in any detail before she paints—or even while she paints. She creates
the artistic image through the use of her artistic tools. It is even the case that painting or
drawing can help us to see things better—Wittgenstein comments:
How can one learn the truth by thinking? As one learns to see a face better if one
draws it. [Z §255]
The detailed artistic image is not necessarily prior to the artistic creation. Neither is it
necessarily an internal/mental event. Certainly, there may be artists who do begin with a
ﬁnal image of what they want to portray, but it is not necessary that they do so. Some
artists, I would imagine, are quite unaware of what the precise end product of a particular
project will be, and if they do start with a mental image, it is one that is subject to constant
revision in the course of the creative process. Further, what the artist can portray is limited
by the kinds of paints, brushes, etc. that are available to her, and the skill she has in utilizing
them. While the exceptional artist can transcend the art that has preceded her, she will not
be able to achieve certain effects that are beyond the capability of her artistic tools—for
example, she will not be able to paint in three dimensions since her canvas is limited to
two dimensions.
Like the painter, we must rely on the “tools” of our language for our ability to express
ourselves.66 While it is sometimes the case that we have a thought and express it in
words, it is not necessary that we ﬁrst have such an explicit thought. Our thinking takes
place through our use of language, and is constrained by language in the same way that
the artist’s tools and her ability to use them constrain what images she can create.67 If
language contains the tools and elements of thought, then the limits of our verbal thinking
are prescribed by the limitations of language—and these limitations can vary from speaker
to speaker (consider the language of an educated adult versus the language of an adult
trying to speak a foreign language that he does not know well). But Wittgenstein goes
even further than this. He claims that language—both the words and the formal structures
that determine how they are used—is not only the vehicle of thought, but often the source
of our “diseases of thinking.” So the causes and the evidence for our misunderstandings
are in language:
Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of
language. [PI §109]
66Wittgensein was not the only person to draw the analogy between words or language and tools, for example:
G.K. Zipf also saw words as tools of expression [Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort. Hafner,
NY, 1965 (Facsimile of the 1949 edition)]. The implementational views of language advocated by Zipf and
Wittgenstein are presented together in D.C. Blair’s Language and Representation in Information Retrieval,
pp. 139ff. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, 1990.
67While most of us take for granted our ability to think and express ourselves, one remarkable survivor of a
severe brain injury, was left without memories of the past, anticipation of the future or the ability to think in an
organized and sustained manner. He was able to recover his ability to think only by slowly and painfully learning
to write again. In fact, the writing itself was, for a time, the only way he could think:
This writing is my only way of thinking. If I shut these notebooks, give it up, I’ll be right
back in the desert, in that “Know-nothing” world of emptiness and amnesia. [A.R. Luria. The
Man with the Shattered World: The History of a Brain Wound, p. 86. Harvard University
Press, 1972.]

34
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
It is no great leap of the imagination to see that if we want to understand how we think, and,
especially, how we make mistakes in our thinking, we must examine language and how
we use it. By focusing his analysis on language, Wittgenstein keeps his efforts oriented
towards external phenomena available for us all to see and avoids the problems inherent
in examining inner mental phenomena.
Benjamin Lee Whorf
Wittgenstein’s insistence on the dependence of thought on language was a novel idea
in philosophical circles, but two linguists, Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, were
makingsimilarclaimsinthe1930’sandearly‘40’s.68 ThereisnoevidencethatWittgenstein
was aware of their work, nor were they aware of Wittgenstein’s, yet there are parallels
between their respective works. Sapir writes:
Human beings do not live in the objective world alone, nor alone in the world
of social activity as ordinarily understood, but are very much at the mercy of the
particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society.
It is quite an illusion to imagine that one adjusts to reality essentially without the
use of language and that language is merely an incidental means of solving speciﬁc
problems of communications or reﬂection. The fact of the matter is that the “real
world” is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group
. . . We see and hear and otherwise experience very largely as we do because the
language habits of our community predispose certain choices of interpretation.69
For Whorf, his discoveries about thought and language came in stages. He ﬁrst saw that
the meaning of various words could lead speakers into false views of reality:
[Whorf] I came in touch with an aspect of this problem before I had studied under
Dr. Sapir, and in a ﬁeld usually considered remote from linguistics. It was in the
course of my professional work for a ﬁre insurance company, in which I undertook
the task of analyzing many hundreds of reports of circumstances surrounding the
start of ﬁres, and in some cases, of explosions. My analysis was directed toward
purely physical conditions, such as defective wiring, presence or lack of air spaces
between metal ﬂues and woodwork, etc., and the results were presented in these
terms. Indeed it was undertaken with no thought that any other signiﬁcances would
or could be revealed. But in due course it became evident that not only a physical
situation qua physics, but the meaning of that situation to people, was sometimes
a factor, through the behavior of the people, in the start of the ﬁre. And this factor
of meaning was clearest when it was a LINGUISTIC MEANING, residing in the
name or the linguistic description commonly applied to the situation. Thus, around
a storage of what are called “gasoline drums,” behavior will tend to a certain type,
that is, great care will be exercised; while around a storage of what are called
“empty gasoline drums,” it will tend to be different—careless, with little repression
of smoking or of tossing cigarette stubs about. Yet the “empty” drums are perhaps
68The claims made by Sapir and Whorf are usually referred to as the “Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.” But it is clear
that their statements do not amount to a hypothesis in the traditional sense, that is, their views are not stated in the
form of a testable claim. For simplicity’s sake, I will refer to Sapir and Whorf’s claim as “Whorf’s Conjecture.”

the more dangerous, since they contain explosive vapor. Physically the situation
is hazardous, but the linguistic analysis according to regular analogy must employ
the “empty,” which inevitably suggests lack of hazard. The word “empty” is used
in two linguistic patterns: (1) as virtual synonym for “null and void, negative,
inert,” (2) applied in analysis of physical situations without regard to, e.g., vapor,
liquid vestiges, or stray rubbish, in the container. The situation is named in one
pattern (2) and the name is then “acted out” or “lived up to” in another (1), this
being a general formula for the linguistic conditioning of behavior into hazardous
forms.
In a wood distillation plant the metal stills were insulated with a composition
prepared from limestone and called at the plant “spun limestone.” No attempt was
made to protect this covering from excessive heat or the contact of ﬂame. After a
period of use, the ﬁre below one of the stills spread to the “limestone,” which to
everyone’s great surprise burned vigorously. Exposure to acetic acid fumes from
the still had converted part of the limestone (calcium carbonate) to calcium acetate.
This when heated in a ﬁre decomposes, forming inﬂammable acetone. Behavior
that tolerated ﬁre close to the covering was induced by use of the name “limestone,”
which because it ends in “-stone” implies noncombustability.70 [Whorf continues
with several more examples]
These incidents preﬁgured Whorf’s more remarkable claims about grammatical structure
and thought. An important role for language is the way it inﬂuences how reality is divided
up:
GRAMMATICAL PATTERNS AS INTERPRETATIONS OF EXPERIENCE
...
A category such as number (singular vs. plural) is an attempted interpretation of a
whole large order of experience, virtually of the world or of nature; it attempts to
say how experience is to be segmented, what experience is to be called “one” and
what “several.”71
Whorf shows that language does not necessarily mirror reality, in fact it can create im-
pressions of reality that do not exist:
In our language, that is SAE [Standard Average European72], plurality and cardinal
numbers are applied in two ways: to real plurals and imaginary plurals. Or more
exactly if less tersely: perceptible spatial aggregates and metaphorical aggregates.
We say “ten men” and also “ten days.” Ten men either are or could be objectively
perceived as ten, ten in one group perception—ten men on a street corner, for
instance. But “ten days” cannot be objectively experienced. We experience only
one day, today; the other nine (or even all ten) are something conjured up from
memory or imagination. If “ten days” be regarded as a group it must be as an

72Whorf: “Since, with respect to the traits compared, there is little difference between English, French, German,
or other European languages with the POSSIBLE (but doubtful) exception of Balto-Slavic and non-Indo-
European, I have lumped these languages into one group called SAE, or ‘Standard Average European’.” [Op.cit.,
p. 138]

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
“imaginary,” mentally constructed group. Whence comes this mental pattern? Just
as in the case of the ﬁre-causing errors, from the fact that our language confuses
the two different situations, has but one pattern for both. When we speak of “ten
steps forward, ten strokes on a bell,” or any similarly described cyclic sequence,
“times” of any sort, we are doing the same thing as with “days.” CYCLICITY
brings the response of imaginary plurals. But a likeness of cyclicity to aggregates
is not unmistakably given by experience prior to language, or it would be found in
all languages, and it is not.73
As Whorf began to study non-Indo-European languages (primarily, the Native American
language of the Hopi), he was able to see the relation between thought and language. This
relation was not limited to the connotations of words, like in his ﬁre insurance examples,
but was extended to the grammatical structure of language. Like Wittgenstein, Whorf
believed that the grammar of language inﬂuenced the structure of our thought (though, as
we will see, Wittgenstein’s notion of grammar, especially what he called “depth grammar,”
was different than Whorf’s). The reason why linguists had not seen this before according
to Whorf was that they had studied Indo-European languages primarily. The lexical and
grammatical structures of these languages are so similar that we are lead to the conclusion
that all languages work this way. As Whorf learned the languages of American Indians,
he saw that they were not just semantically and phonetically different from European
languages, but grammatically different, and that this grammatical difference inﬂuenced
how native Americans “saw,” or thought about, reality:
[Whorf]When linguists became able to examine critically and scientiﬁcally a large
number of languages of widely different patterns . . . It was found that the back-
ground linguistic system (in other words, the grammar) of each language is not
merely a reproducing instrument for voicing ideas but rather is itself the shaper of
ideas, the program and guide for the individual’s mental activity, for his analysis of
impressions, for his synthesis of his mental stock in trade. Formulation of ideas is
not an independent process, strictly rational in the old sense, but is part of a particu-
lar grammar, and differs, from slightly to greatly, between different grammars. We
dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages. The categories and
types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not ﬁnd there because
they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a
kaleidoscopic ﬂux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds—and
this means largely by the linguistic systems in our minds. We cut nature up, organize
it into concepts, and ascribe signiﬁcances as we do, largely because we are parties
to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that holds throughout our
speech community and is codiﬁed in the patterns of our language. The agreement
is, of course, an implicit and unstated one, BUT ITS TERMS ARE ABSOLUTELY
OBLIGATORY; we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the organization and
classiﬁcation of data which the agreement decrees.
This fact is very signiﬁcant for modern science, for it means that no individual
is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality but is constrained to certain
modes of interpretation even while he thinks himself most free.74

Whorf continues:
As I said in the April 1940 Review,75 segmentation of nature is an aspect of
grammar—one as yet little studied by grammarians. We cut up and organize the
spread and ﬂow of events as we do, largely because, through our mother tongue,
we are parties to an agreement to do so, not because nature itself is segmented in
exactly that way for all to see. Languages differ not only in how they build their
sentences but also in how they break down nature to secure the elements to put in
those sentences. This breakdown gives units of the lexicon. “Word” is not a very
good “word” for them; “lexeme” has been suggested, and “term” will do for the
present. By these more or less distinct terms we ascribe a semiﬁctitious isolation
to parts of experience. English terms, like “sky, hill, swamp,” persuade us to regard
some elusive aspect of nature’s endless variety as a distinct THING, almost like a
table or chair. Thus English and similar tongues lead us to think of the universe as
a collection of rather distinct objects and events corresponding to words. Indeed
this is the implicit picture of classical physics and astronomy—that the universe is
essentially a collection of detached objects of different sizes.
The examples used by older logicians in dealing with this point are usually un-
fortunately chosen. They tend to pick out tables and chairs and apples on tables
as test objects to demonstrate the object-like nature of reality and its one-to-one
correspondence with logic. Man’s artifacts and the agricultural products he severs
from living plants have a unique degree of isolation; we may expect that languages
will have fairly isolated terms for them. The real question is: What do different
languages do, not with these artiﬁcially isolated objects but with the ﬂowing face
of nature in its motion, color, and changing form; with clouds, beaches, and yonder
ﬂight of birds? For, as goes our segmentation of the face of nature, so goes our
physics of the Cosmos.
...
The Indo-European languages and many others give great prominence to a type
of sentence having two parts, each part built around a class of word—substantives
and verbs—which those languages treat differently in grammar. As I showed in the
April 1940 Review, this distinction is not drawn from nature; it is just a result of the
fact that every tongue must have some kind of structure, and those tongues have
made a go of exploiting this kind.76
Whorf even attributes some advances in science to the way scientists talk about their work:
The revolutionary changes that have occurred since 1890 in the world of science—
especially in physics but also in chemistry, biology, and the sciences of man—have
been due not so much to new facts as to new ways of thinking about facts. . . . I say
new ways of THINKING about facts, but a more nearly accurate statement would
say new ways of TALKING about facts . . . we must face the fact that science begins
and ends in talk.77

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Problems With Whorf’s Conjecture
The philosopher Max Black, although sympathetic with Whorf’s claims about the relation
between thought and language, observes, correctly, that Whorf had not proved his case.
After quoting Whorf, he makes the following comment:
Even in so crude a summary as the more detailed and more suggestive accounts
supplied by Whorf and other anthropologists, a sympathetic reader may darkly
discern unfamiliar ways of patterning the universe, remote from our own familiar
distinctions between past, present, and future, between “mental” and “physical”—
and the like. . . . And when we come to the supposed linguistic “reﬂections” of the
delineated“world-view,”thecourse of the argument becomes dubious indeed.. . . So
long as communication between members of radically different cultures remains as
crude as it is apt to be at best, the perception of patterns of thought embodied in the
formal structure of a language will remain a controversial and speculative exercise.
And even if some reliable procedures for conducting this kind of investigation were
to be evolved, it would be a further and a very difﬁcult step to argue from such
formal features to the existence of causal inﬂuence upon the thought habits of the
language users. (The existence of diverse philosophical systems, all expressed with
equal facility in such a language as English or German, must cast doubt upon the
possibility of a simple causal relation between grammar and thought.)78
Black does not completely reject Sapir and Whorf’s conjecture on the inﬂuence of language
on thought, but he does conclude that “ . . . the results remain inconclusive, if suggestive for
future scientiﬁc research.” But his comment, above, that “diverse philosophical systems
[can be] expressed with equal facility in such a language as English or German” does not
provide evidence against Whorf’s position. In the ﬁrst place, Whorf stated quite clearly that
one of the main reasons that we do not see the inﬂuence of grammar on thought is that our
basis for comparison is what he called the SAE (Standard Average European) languages,
which have very similar structures. Whorf would not be surprised that Black sees little
difference between expressions in English and German. Black’s second point, that “diverse
philosophical systems [can be] expressed with equal facility in such a language as English
or German” is not as clear cut as Black implies that it is. If it were, there would be no debate
about the translation of these works into various languages, yet there is. Texts in formal
logic may be translated from one SAE language to another without undue argument, but
there are signiﬁcant debates over the translations of many other European philosophers,
Heidegger or Merleau-Ponty, for example. One needs only read the discussions concerning
thetranslationofwhatWittgensteincalls“ ¨Ubersicht”toseethattherearepointswhereeven
English and German do not match up well.79 But is this difﬁculty in translation because
English speakers don’t have the concept that the Germans express by “ ¨Ubersicht?” That
is not as clear.
But Black’s point that Whorf and Sapir do not provide enough evidence to support their
conjecture is well taken. What we see in Whorf is a provocative insight and the beginnings

observing that neither Whorf nor Sapir had even proposed a testable hypothesis. (see p. 94, in the above work)

of his attempt to marshal data in its support. Unfortunately, Whorf died in 1941 at the age
of 44 while Sapir died in 1939 and their cause was taken up by only a few other linguists
or anthropologists. But these followers lacked Whorf’s and Sapir’s enthusiasm and focus
on the relation of language and thought.80
Although Whorf’s conjecture of linguistic relativity has been out of fashion for decades,
there has been a recent renewed interest in what he wrote. Ellis, extending Whorf’s conjec-
ture, has claimed that language’s primary purpose is not to act as a medium of communi-
cation, but to provide the structure or segmentation of reality that enables communication
to take place:
The essential and distinctive feature of language is not its ability to transmit infor-
mation . . . but a logically prior attribute, the process of analysis, evaluation, and
organization of experience which must have taken place before communication can
occur.81
Languagemustﬁrsthavehadsomethingtodowithwhatthereistocommunicateand
with what will be counted as communication. It is not just a means of transferring
information, it is also, and far more importantly, the locus of the process of deciding
what information is to be, and of instituting the kinds of information that will be
available for communication.82
Ellis’ statement recalls a similar statement from Wittgenstein:
[Philosophical problems] are, of course, not empirical problems; they are solved,
rather, by looking into the workings of our language, and that in such a way as to
make us recognize those workings: in despite of an urge to misunderstand them.
The problems are solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging what we
have always known. [PI §109]
Whorf followed his conception of the dependency of thought on language to its inevitable
conclusion. Namely, that we can study how we think, not by introspection or the reporting
of mental events, as psychologists and philosophers often do, but, like Wittgenstein, by
examining the structure and use of our language:
[Whorf]Actually, thinking is most mysterious, and by far the greatest light upon it
that we have is thrown by the study of language. This study shows that the forms
of a person’s thoughts are controlled by inexorable laws of pattern of which he
is unconscious. These patterns are the unperceived intricate systematizations of
his own language—shown readily enough by a candid comparison and contrast
with other languages, especially those of a different linguistic family. His thinking
itself is in a language—in English, in Sanskrit, in Chinese. [footnote: To anticipate
the text, “thinking in a language” does not necessarily have to use WORDS. An
uncultivated Choctow can as easily as the most skilled litterateur contrast the tenses
or the genders of two experiences, though he has never heard of any WORDS like
“tense” or “gender” for such contrasts. Much thinking never brings in words at

all, but manipulates whole paradigms, word-classes, and such grammatical orders
“behind” or “above” the focus of personal consciousness.] And every language is
a vast pattern-system, different from others, in which are culturally ordained the
forms and categories by which the personality not only communicates, but also
analyzes nature, notices or neglects types of relationship and phenomena, channels
his reasoning, and builds the house of his consciousness.83
Whorf brought out another important, but subtle, point that bears reiterating. That is,
the inﬂuence of language on our thought not only shapes our thought in language, but it
also shapes our non-linguistic thought—thought that deals with images or sound. In other
words, we formulate images of objects such as tables, chairs, the sky, marshes, musical
passages and other similar entities, at least in part, because our language breaks up our
reality this way. This is not to say, of course, that the structures of reality and language
are totally independent. Philosopher of Language John Searle describes this relationship
between language and reality:
I am not saying that language creates reality. Far from it. Rather, I am saying
that what counts as reality—what counts as a glass of water or a book or a table,
what counts as the same glass or a different book or two tables—is a matter of
the categories that we impose on the world; and those categories are for the most
part linguistic. And furthermore; when we experience the world we experience it
through linguistic categories that help to shape the experiences themselves. The
world doesn’t come to us already sliced up into objects and experiences: what
counts as an object is already a function of our system of representation, and how we
perceive the world in our experiences is inﬂuenced by that system of representation.
The mistake is to suppose that the application of language to the world consists of
attaching labels to objects that are, so to speak, self-identifying. On my view, the
world divides the way we divide it, and our main way of dividing things up is in
language. Our concept of reality is a matter of our linguistic categories.84
Wittgenstein demonstrates how language can shape the way we see reality in the following
example. He shows us a drawing of a triangle with the angles labeled A, B, and C, and the
sides labeled a, b, and c. Then he says:
See the triangle in such a way that c is the base and C the apex; and now, so that b
is the base and B the apex. [RPP I §23]
If we look at the triangle in each of these two ways, we have two distinct visual experiences.
Yet the visual data we perceive is the same in both instances. Here is a clear example of how
language can make us see the same thing two different ways. Note also, that only someone
with a basic understanding of the language of plane geometry can have this experience.
A monkey could see the same visual data that we do, but he would not be able to see it in
the two different ways that Wittgenstein wants us to—not because he doesn’t see it as well
as we do, but because he does not understand the language of geometry. Understanding
the language of geometry is the sine qua non of this perception. It is interesting to note

that Whorf did not have any formal schooling in linguistics or anthropology before he
gained his ﬁrst insights into the relation between language and thought (as a young man,
he attended MIT and majored in chemical engineering). His ﬁrst insights came as a
claims adjuster for the Hartford insurance company,85 and even as his stature grew with
his publications on language, he steadfastly refused academic appointments that were
offered to him, “. . . saying that his business situation afforded him a more comfortable
living and a freer opportunity to develop his intellectual interests in his own way.”86 This
would not have been a surprise to Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein believed that professional
philosophers were so thoroughly locked into the grammatical forms of their language,
that is, the way that they formulated their philosophical puzzles, that it was extraordinarily
difﬁcult for them to gain the objectivity necessary to see how language was affecting the
way they thought about, and eventually answered, these puzzles. By working as a claims
adjuster, Whorf was not encumbered by the points of view of professional linguists, and
was free to gain his own insights about language. What Whorf discovered by intuition,
Wittgenstein came to after a long and intense reexamination of his own early work; and
the fragmentary evidence that Whorf gathered to support his conjecture about linguistic
relativity paled in comparison to the myriad examples that Wittgenstein marshalled in
his attempt to show the relationship between language and thought. Part of the problem
with Whorf’s conjecture was that he required comparisons between European languages
(SAE) and obscure and difﬁcult languages such as Hopi or Navaho. Most readers did not
command the necessary familiarity of two such different languages, so the few examples
that Whorf gave to support his thesis had to be taken on faith by his readers. But there is
a further problem with Whorf’s work, although no one, to my knowledge, has articulated
this difﬁculty. That is, Whorf cannot reject the hypothesis that the reason why Hopi Indians
and their English speaking contemporaries think differently may not be only because their
respective grammars are different, but because the activities on which their languages
are based are so different. Those Native Americans who lived during Whorf’s lifetime
who maintained ﬂuency in their ancestral language, probably lived day-to-day lives that
were strikingly different than that lived by an English-speaker of European descent. This,
alone, might account for the differences in their respective languages, and their respective
thought patterns. The major objection to Whorf’s conjecture about the dependency of
thought on grammar and language is that no matter how differently Native American and
English speakers talked about everyday affairs, it was always possible for these differences
to be somehow articulated in English. For example, Clyde Kluckhohn, a contemporary of
Whorf’s who sympathized with his belief about the dependency of thought on language,
offered a number of examples of differences between English and Navaho:
85The Hartford Insurance Company must have been an interesting place to work; the Pulitzer prize-winning
poet, Wallace Stevens worked in their legal division during the same time, and eventually became a vice president.
One might venture that Hartford had, in Stevens and Whorf, a greater number of nationally inﬂuential scholars
than many colleges did.
86J. Carroll. Introduction to Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf,
p. 5. MIT Press, Cambridge, 1956. Whorf often took classes at nearby universities, but never considered pursuing
a higher degree. His most noticeable association was with the linguist Edward Sapir. He knew Sapir casually at
ﬁrst but began taking his classes and working more closely with him after Sapir accepted a faculty position at
Yale in 1931. Sapir encouraged Whorf’s work on Uto-Aztecan languages and introduced him to a native Hopi
speaker who lived nearby in New York City.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
When a Navaho says that he went somewhere he never fails to specify whether it
was afoot, astride a horse, by wagon, auto, train, or airplane. This is done partly
by using different verb stems which indicate whether the traveler moved under his
own steam or was transported, partly by naming the actual means. Thus, “he went
to town” would become:
kintahg´o´o ’´ı´ıy´a
He went to town afoot or in a nonspeciﬁc way.
kintahg´o´o bil ‘i’´ı´ıb´a´az
He went to town by wagon.
kintahg´o´o bil ‘o‘oot‘a ‘
He went to town by airplane.
kintahg´o´o bil ‘i‘´ı´ı‘´e´el
He went to town by boat.
kintahg´o´o bil ‘o‘ooldloozh
He went to town by horseback at a trot.
kintahg´o´o bil ‘o‘ooldghod
He went to town by horseback at a run
(or perhaps by car or train).
kintahg´o´o bil ‘i‘noolt´a´a‘
He went to town by horseback at a gallup.87
The problem with such examples, is that even though the expressions in Navaho seem
unusually detailed to English speakers, it is still possible to have English expressions
that convey the same meanings as the Navaho ones do. In fact, it is easy to imagine
circumstances where you would make these distinctions naturally. Consider:
“Bill went to town yesterday.”
“That’s a long way. How did he get there?”
“He went on horseback.”
“I didn’t know he could ride a horse.”
“He’s not good at it, he just rode at a trot.”
What is different between Navaho and English is not so much the grammar or the
“thoughts” that depend on them, but the circumstances in which such ﬁne distinctions
are made. Navahos make these distinctions routinely, while English speakers require a
more complex set of circumstances, but they can make them nevertheless. These are the
kinds of examples that Whorf, et alia, used to support their conjecture about the depen-
dence of thought on language, but it seems clear that, collectively, they are not really
convincing evidence.
What would be required to lend plausibility to Whorf’s conjecture? Well, at the very
least, there would have to be a situation where, given the same circumstances or stimuli,
an English-speaking person would consistently interpret the situation differently than a
Navaho would, and these differences would have to be attributable to their respective
languages. The difference in interpretation would be most noticeable if it resulted in
actions that showed a clear difference between the two. But the strongest support for
Whorf’s conjecture would be if a Navaho and an English speaker both saw the same
situation and stimuli, heard each other’s description of the situation, and disagreed in their
interpretations. That is, both speakers would be lead, by the grammar of their respective

languages, to not only disagree with each other, but to insist that the other is wrong.
Whorf’s examples do not give us these kinds of distinctions, but Wittgenstein’s do.88
Wittgenstein on Language and Thought
Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language had insights that were similar to Whorf’s but did
not have the failings that Whorf’s work had. Wittgenstein did not have to compare two
distinctly different languages to prove his point, he found ample evidence for his claims
about the dependence of thought on language entirely within his own language.89 And
these examples were so striking that they have been translated convincingly from German
into English. Whorf believed that the effect of linguistic relativity could occur only between
two languages of sufﬁciently different origins; Wittgenstein’s great insight was to show
that these formal differences could occur within the boundaries of a single language as
well. Where Whorf focused his analysis on different languages, Wittgenstein focused his
analysis on the processes within a single language—processes which he termed language
games. The effect that Whorf believed he saw between sufﬁciently different languages,
Wittgenstein saw between language games, in a single language; and while Whorf’s at-
tempts to ﬁnd support for his claims were largely ad hoc, Wittgenstein had a rigorous
method for uncovering these discrepancies of language use—what he came to call “dis-
eases of thinking.”
Whorf had an original and notable observation, but, as Black justiﬁably pointed out, the
facts that he marshalled in support of it were not sufﬁcient to conﬁrm his hypothesis. In fact,
the way that Whorf presented his supposition, as we have noted, is not a testable hypothesis
at all. Often this sort of conjecture appears in science with inadequate support and the
originator is pushed into a debate over the validity of the conjecture. Through this debate,
the conjecture is turned into testable hypotheses and various ways are devised to support or
reject it. It is then either supported or not. Unfortunately, Whorf died, comparatively young,
before this debate could be engaged, so his conjecture about the dependence of thought
on grammar and language was left with little for his supporters to pin their allegiance on.
The dependence of thought on language is central to Wittgenstein’s later philosophy. The
structure and grammar of language determine, or inﬂuence, the structure and course of
our thinking. Wittgenstein’s most famous example is:
88There has been at least one experiment that lends support to Whorf’s view of language and thought. In this
experiment, half the subjects were English speakers and half were native Tarahumara speakers (Tarahumara is
an Uto-Aztecan language found in Mexico). The point of difference under investigation concerned the fact that
Tarahumara speakers use the same word (siy´oname) for the colors blue and green. In the ﬁrst test, subjects were
given three color chips: one green, one blue and one, alternately, somewhat green or somewhat blue. The task
was to select the one color chip of the three that was the most different from the other two. English speakers
selected the correct color chip 29 out of 30 times, while the Tarahumara, with no linguistic means to distinguish
blue and green, selected the correct color chip only half the time: that is, no better than random. While this
experiment offers support for Whorf’s conjecture, it is difﬁcult to come up with such decisive demonstrations. In
other words, if Whorf’s view of language is taken to be valid, it is clear that it is probably a very small effect and
not as pervasive as he suggested. [P. Kay and W. Kempton. “What is the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis?,” American
Anthropologist, 86:1, pp. 65–79.]
89Although Wittgenstein’s native language was German, he lived most of his life in England and usually lectured
in English. His major philosophical works, other than The Blue and Brown Books were written in German and
translated into English by his former students and colleagues.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
What is the meaning of a word? [BB p. 1]
This sort of statement, according to Wittgenstein, gets us into serious conceptual trouble.90
Most obviously, the structure of the question leads us to expect a certain kind of answer.
The difﬁculty here is that the grammatical form of this question is similar to the form of
a set of more common questions. For example:
What is the length of a marathon?
What is the color of Alain’s car?
What is the height of Niagara Falls?
Each of these questions has a reasonably precise answer—a marathon is 26 miles and
385 yards long; Alain’s car is blue; Niagara Falls (on the Canadian side) is 167 feet high.
The question, “What is the meaning of a word?” looks like the three questions above.
This similarity is a similarity of what Wittgenstein called the “surface grammar” of the
questions. But this similarity disguises a very deep semantic difference between the ﬁrst
question and the following three. What is the consequence of this misperceived similarity?
The consequence is that when we ask the question “What is the meaning of a word?” we
expect the same kind of precise answer that we would get when we ask “What is the length
of a marathon?” This leads us to look for a precise entity or statement that would count
as a “meaning.” The grammar of the question about the meaning of a word compels us
to think that there is a precise answer to this question. When we don’t ﬁnd it easily, we
continue our search, believing that the precise answer we seek is somehow just out of our
reach, or that the answer is some sort of complex componential analysis of the meaning
such as that done in Eco’s work.91 Wittgenstein’s answer to this question is to rephrase it:
For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word
“meaning” it can be explained thus: the meaning of a word is its use in language.92
90As Wittgenstein continues:
The questions “What is length?,” “What is meaning?,” “What is the number one?” etc.,
produce in us a mental cramp. We feel that we can’t point to anything in reply to them and
yet ought to point to something. (We are up against one of the great sources of philosophical
bewilderment: a substantive makes us look for a thing that corresponds to it.) BB p. 1.

92PI §43. My translation of this passage differs from the published translation. The original translation is:
For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word “meaning” it
can be deﬁned thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.
What Anscombe, the translator of Philosophical Investigations, renders as “deﬁned” is the German word
“erkl¨aren.” But “erkl¨aren” is translated, more commonly, as “explained” rather than “deﬁned.” “Explain” is the
ﬁrst meaning given for “erkl¨aren” and “deﬁne” is the ninth meaning in The New Cassell’s German Dictionary
[Funk and Wagnells, New York, 1958]. Given Wittgenstein’s distrust of deﬁnitions, the Anscombe translation
seems somewhat misleading. It appears that Wittgenstein is “deﬁning” what “meaning” is, something that is
inconsistent with his philosophy of language. It fails on two counts: In the ﬁrst place, Wittgenstein speciﬁcally
argues that language does not work in only one way. “Deﬁning” meaning as “use” is basically saying that meaning
arises in only one way, through “use.” Further, Wittgenstein distrusts “deﬁnitions” in general. They give a false

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
45
Reading this formulation of the statement we do not expect a precise answer as we did
when we asked the ﬁrst question. In fact, it is no longer clear what would “count” as
the meaning of a word—and this is exactly what Wittgenstein wants. For Wittgenstein,
“meaning” is not a clearly describable entity, in fact, it is not an entity at all, as the form of
the original question leads us to believe. If we want to understand the meaning of a word,
there is no substitute for looking at its use; and to come to understand a word’s use we
must look, as John Wisdom, one of Wittgenstein’s students, stated, at “cases and cases.”93
And how do we know if we understand what the word “means?” We understand it if we
can use it and we get the appropriate response from those to whom we are speaking.
It is also the case that these three questions (supra) have a further implication: not only
do they all have clearly speciﬁable answers but they also have clear ways of determining
what the correct answers are. If we want to know the length of a marathon or the height
of Niagara Falls, we can look it up in an encyclopedia. If we want to know the color of
Alain’s car we simply look at it. There are clear criteria for correctness here. This is not
the case with the “meaning” of a word since the same word can have different meanings
in different contexts.
Another important problem with “asking for the meaning of a word” is that this formulation
of the question also implies that there is a clear stopping point in our search for the answer.
Again, this is the same conclusion that we arrive at with questions like, “What is the
length of a marathon?” When we answer this question (by ﬁnding out the precise length)
we know that our search for an answer has ended.94 Once you know that a marathon is
26 miles 385 yards, or that Alain’s car is blue, or that the height of Niagara Falls is 167
sense of precision that has no place in understanding how language works. I believe that translating “erkl¨aren”
as “explained” gives a rendering of this passage which is more faithful to Wittgenstein’s philosophy.
A further reason for translating “erkl¨aren” as “explain” is actually given by Anscombe herself. In the paragraph
following the one above, Anscombe translates the German:
Und die Bedeutung eines Namens erkl¨art man manchmal dadurch, daß man auf seinen Tr¨ager
zeigt.
as,
And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to its bearer.
Here, “erkl¨aren” is translated, more appropriately, I think, as “explained.”
93See quotation at footnote 177.
94One might argue that quantities such as length or height can never be accurately measured. We can measure
them with increasing precision, but there must be a point—perhaps at the molecular level, where our notion of
accuracy of measurement breaks down completely. But this is a red herring. When we talk about the length of a
marathon, the height of a waterfall or the color of a car, we are using these particular measurements in speciﬁc
language games that require no more accuracy than the use of these values in ordinary life requires. To say that
the measurement of the length of a marathon or the height of Niagara Falls must be calculated to the millionth
of a centimeter is to confuse language games. We do have language games which require as much accuracy
as possible—some scientiﬁc measurements may require all the accuracy we can muster. But our notion of the
“accuracy of measurement” varies from language game to language game and situation to situation. A tourist
looking at Niagara Falls and asking a guide how high it is would not need a measurement accurate to the millionth
of an inch. This is not because the tourist is sloppy or fuzzy-minded, but because there is nothing he can do with
such an accurate measurement—he does not participate in the activities for which such accurate measurements
are used . Wittgenstein talks about how “certainty” can vary from language game to language game:

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
feet, there is no more for you to do. One cannot then ask “But what else is the length of a
marathon?” etc. This is not the case with “What is the meaning of a word?” After someone
has answered the question “What is the meaning of this word?,” we can legitimately ask,
“But what else is the meaning of this word?,” or, perhaps more typically, “What other
meanings does this word have?” And we could get reasonable answers to such a question.
By being able to ask the follow-up question in the case of the meaning of a word, but not
have it appropriate in the other three cases shows what Wittgenstein would call a clear
grammatical difference between the ﬁrst question and the other three; and by showing
such a grammatical difference, by inference we have shown a difference in the way that
we think about such things. We can see that we think of marathons as having a precisely
measurable length, of cars having clearly speciﬁable colors, and of Niagara Falls having
a precisely measurable height. We can also see another difference between the “meaning
of a word” and the “length of a marathon”: the question about the “meaning” of a word is
not only imprecise, it is open-ended. When one proposes what the “meaning” of a word is,
it is usually the case that this meaning can be added to or modiﬁed because the complete
description of such a meaning can almost never be given. In fact, it is not clear at all what
a “complete description of meaning” would be.95 It is also the case that the “meaning” of a
word can change, often radically, over time (think of the word “watergate” before Nixon’s
time as president, and after he resigned). But the length of a marathon or the height of a
I can be as certain of someone else’s sensations as of any fact. But this does not make the
propositions “He is much depressed,” “25 × 25 = 625” and “I am sixty years old” into similar
instruments. The explanation suggests itself that the certainty is of a different kind.—This
seems to point to a psychological difference. But the difference is logical.
...
The kind of certainty is the kind of language-game. [PI p. 224]
In the same way, the degree of precision in measurement can vary from language game to language game; and,
as Wittgenstein emphasizes, this is not a psychological difference, although it seems that it is, but a logical or
grammatical difference.
Am I inexact when I do not give our distance from the sun to the nearest foot, or tell a joiner
the width of a table to the nearest thousandth of an inch?
No single ideal of exactness has been laid down; we do not know what we should be supposed
to imagine under this head—unless you yourself lay down what is to be so called. But you
will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to hit upon such a convention; at least any that satisﬁes you. [PI §88]
95The incompleteness of linguistic meaning was proposed before the turn of the century by C.S. Peirce. He talks
of the meaning of a “representation” which is somewhat broader than, but includes, language. Representations
can be any sign, linguistic or otherwise. A sign or representation, according to Peirce, is “something which stands
to somebody for something in some respect or capacity” [Philosophical Writings of Peirce. Dover, NY, 1955.
Edited by J. Buchler]. Peirce describes the unlimited nature of meaning and representation:
The meaning of a representation can be nothing but a representation. In fact it is nothing but
the representation itself conceived as stripped of irrelevant clothing. But this clothing never
can be completely stripped off: it is only changed for something more diaphanous. So there
is an inﬁnite regression here. Finally, the interpretant is nothing but another representation
to which the torch of truth is handed along; and as representation, it has its interpretation
again. Lo, another inﬁnite series. [C.S. Peirce, quoted by Eco. A Theory of Semiotics, p. 69.
Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN, 1976.]

water fall does not change in any appreciable way over time. Wittgenstein shows this, not
by conceptual analysis, but by a grammatical analysis. This can be done by juxtaposing
statements such as:
If you give me the meaning of a word, your answer will never be complete, and it
will change over time.
If you give me the height of Niagara Falls, your answer will never be complete,
and it will change over time.
Clearly, the ﬁrst statement is OK but the second one strikes us as decidedly odd, perhaps
even incorrect. This sort of grammatical analysis is central to Wittgenstein’s methodology
and consists of what he called the analysis of “depth grammar.”
Wittgenstein’s Methodology
I am not interested in constructing a building, so much as in having a perspicuous
view of the foundations of possible buildings.—Wittgenstein Culture and Value
The Analysis of Depth Grammar
There is an old joke that goes like this:
Two individuals are talking:
“The only people who live in Green Bay, Wisconsin are football players and
prostitutes.”
“My mother comes from Green Bay!!!!”
“Really? What position did she play?”
This, of course, is an example of what logicians call the “excluded middle.” A question
subject to the excluded middle affords only two options for its answer. There are, of course,
instances where such a binary choice is perfectly all right:
Do you want the light on or off?
But in the joke above it shows how the logical, that is, grammatical, form of a statement
can lead us ineluctably to only two alternatives, and, in cases like that of the joke, neither
alternative is correct. Here, in a very obvious way, we see that the grammatical structure
of a statement can lead to the humorous inference that the respondent’s mother plays
professional football. There are other similar quirks of language structure, many of them
emphasized through jokes.96 But what Wittgenstein found was that there were equally
decisive problems with the structure of language that lead us astray in far more subtle and
important ways. Unlike the excluded middle, these misleading expressions are harder to
96For example, the question, “When did you stop stealing?” (ﬁrst asked of Zeno by the Megarian philosopher
Alexius). Malcolm quotes Wittgenstein as saying, “ . . . a serious and good philosophical work could be written
that would consist entirely of jokes (without being facetious). Another time he said that a philosophical treatise
might contain nothing but questions (without answers). In his own writing he made wide use of both. To give an
example: ‘Why can’t a dog simulate pain? Is he too honest?’ ” N. Malcolm. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir,

detect. Consider the time-worn philosophical problem of “Theseus’ ship” as described by
Plutarch:
The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned [from the labyrinth in
Crete] had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of
Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in
new and stronger timber in their place, inasmuch that this ship became a standing
example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one
side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was
not the same.97
Even philosophers of the stature of David Hume have contributed their own analysis of
this problem:
A ship, of which a considerable part has been changed by frequent reparations, is
still considered as the same, nor does the difference of the materials hinder us from
ascribing an identity to it. The common end in which the parts conspire is the same
under all their variations, and affords an easy transition of the imagination from
one situation of the body to another.98
If a few planks of the ship are replaced, most individuals are willing to accept that the
ship is still Theseus’, but as you continue to replace the planks one by one, eventually,
in the limiting case, all of the planks will be replaced and the philosopher (even Hume, I
think) cannot convincingly assert that the identity of the ship is unchanged. If you agree
with Hume that it is still Theseus’ ship when “a considerable part has been changed,”
consider this variation of the problem: What if, instead of replacing each rotting plank
in the original ship, you began to build an entirely new separate ship, plank by plank
as the planks in the old ship rotted. It’s the same plank by plank replacement process as
before, but doing it separately from Theseus’ ship now, I think, makes one less willing to
say that we still have Theseus’ ship after “a considerable part has been changed.”99 The
question is not whether Hume, inter alia, are right or wrong here—cases can be made
for both sides. What is at issue for Wittgenstein is why anyone sees a puzzle here at all.

99This problem of incremental change that eventually produces a state change is similar to an even older puzzle,
the “paradox of the heap” (originally called “sorites,” the adjective form of the word soros, the Greek word for
“heap”): you begin with no sand to which you add a single grain of sand. When you have no sand you clearly do
not have a “heap” of sand, and if you add a single grain of sand, you still don’t have a heap. When one accepts
that the addition of a single grain of sand to anything that is not a heap does not produce a heap, then it becomes
impossible to create a heap no matter how many single grains of sand are added. A heap is created by a process
that, it is agreed, could not produce a heap. It’s reasoning is like:
If x is not a heap, then x+1 grains of sand is not a heap;
If x+1 is not a heap then (x+1)+1 is not a heap;
If x+2 is not a heap then (x+2)+1 is not a heap:
Eventually, you are confronted with the paradox, or contradiction, that:
If x+1,000,000 is not a heap then (x+1,000,000)+1 is not a heap.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
49
The philosopher sees a paradox of profound nature, but, to follow Wittgenstein’s analysis
of similar problems, what we have is not a profound puzzle, but merely a grammatical
confusion which results from taking the word “same” out of its ordinary usage. The error
is a grammatical error, in part, because no amount of empirical investigation can resolve
the issue—no amount of investigation of Theseus’ ship will tell you deﬁnitively whether
it is still his ship or not. The word “same” has no grammatical role in the language game
of comparing Theseus’ ship (with the replaced parts) to itself. “Same” does have a role in
the language game of comparing one ship with itself when there is some question of its
physical identity (e.g., “Is that the same ship that we sailed to Juneau in last year?”), but it
does not have a role in the game of comparing a ship with itself when its physical identity
is not an issue, such as our example of Theseus’ ship (i.e., we all know that the rotting ship
was originally Theseus’ ship). Here “same” does not have a legitimate role in comparing
Theseus’ ship with itself, that is, there are no criteria for usage here as there are in everyday
usage of the word “same.” Consider what the criteria would be for determining, in the
case of legitimate comparison, whether the ship you are considering is the same one that
you sailed to Juneau in last year. You might refer to the name of the ship and its home
port as printed on the bow or stern (knowing that ships are not permitted duplicate names
under international registry). Or, you might show a receipt you have showing that you
had purchased passage on the ship in question; or, you might show someone a picture of
yourself standing next to the ship in Juneau’s harbor; or, you might say, “Just ask my wife
and sons, they were with me on the trip”; or, if the name of the ship you are looking at is
different, you might ask the captain or the harbor master whether it had a different name
last year; etc., etc. None of these justiﬁcations would work with the puzzle of Theseus’
This paradox is attributed to Eubulides, a contemporary critic of Aristotle and member of the Megarian school of
philosophy. Megarian philosophy was most inﬂuenced by Socrates and the Eleatics. Eubulides’ most memorable
contribution to philosophy was a series of paradoxes: “Sorites” (supra), the paradox of the “Hooded Man” the
paradox of the “Bald Man,” and, most famously, the “Liar’s Paradox.” (A detailed presentation of the history of
sorites and its inﬂuence on modern philosophy is given by T. Williamson in his Vagueness, Routledge, London,
1994.)
These paradoxes have some similarities with Zeno’s earlier, but better known paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise,
where the ﬂeet Achilles must catch up to the slower tortoise who has started ahead of him in a race. According
to Zeno, Achilles can only catch the tortoise if he traverses half the distance between himself and the tortoise.
No traversal of half the distance between Achilles and the tortoise will result in Achilles catching the tortoise.
But the distance between Achilles and the tortoise no matter how short can always be halved. Thus there are an
inﬁnite number of distances Achilles must go before he can catch the tortoise. Hence, Achilles can never catch
the tortoise.
Wittgenstein would say that each of these paradoxes arises, as the paradox of Theseus’ ship, because of a
confusion of language usage. Interestingly, a recent activity has given rise to an activity/language game in which
a similar decision of identity must be made. This occurs in litigation dealing with software “piracy.” When a
computer program is “stolen,” what is usually taken is not the entire program, but critical parts of it. To confuse
the identity of the program further, the thief can change the names of variables and ﬁles used in the program and
may even change the order in which program modules appear physically in the source code. All of this makes
it increasingly difﬁcult for the plaintiff to argue convincingly that the defendant’s program was, in large part,
stolen from the plaintiff. What makes it even more difﬁcult is that for any two programs designed to do the same
thing, there will be parts that are the same or similar even when one is not copying the other. This does not
mean, however, that the issue of Theseus’ ship could be settled in court. The software piracy case is sufﬁciently
different in key ways from the question of Theseus’ ship. But it does show how a legitimate language game can
come into existence enabling us—here, forcing us—to make distinctions that we did not make before.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
ship, that is, it’s not an empirical problem.100 In another example, the convicted murderers
Leopold and Loeb carried this kind of reasoning to an extreme when, after serving some
time in prison they said that they should be released from jail since they were no longer
the same two individuals who had been tried and convicted before. Their reasoning was
that since their body’s cells were constantly replacing themselves, all of their cells had
been replaced since their conviction, hence they were no longer the same individuals who
were convicted. Wittgenstein would not have called their reasoning a biological mistake,
but a grammatical one. That is, it is not scientiﬁcally wrong, as far as I know, to say that an
individual’s cells can be replaced entirely in a given period of time. But it is incorrect to say
that, in ordinary circumstances, an individual’s identity is solely determined by the precise
set of cells that exist in his body at a speciﬁc point in time. Why is this the case? Well, it’s
easy to make up reasonable sentences that concern identity that have no reference to (and
no dependence on) cellular biology (e.g., “Was that Fred wearing the lampshade at the
party”). We don’t have a language game or form of life which relates personal identity and
human cellular structure (that is, cells are not criteria for personal identity), though it is
possible we may someday have such a usage—the FBI’s use of “DNA identiﬁcation” (the
identiﬁcation of criminals based on just a few of their body cells) comes close to dealing
with this notion, and is evidence of how such language games can evolve. The problem
of personal identity in everyday usage can be seen as a grammatical problem because the
form and structure of our language determine how we usually talk about personal identity;
and the way we talk about identity gives us a format for raising issues of identity (i.e., what
questions or statements are legitimate) and how to resolve these issues (i.e., which further
questions are legitimate and which are not). How do issues of personal identity come up?
They come up in the conversations—that is, the language games—we have. For example,
we can say, “John is the person who deposited the money,” or, “Mary was the winner of
the award”; but we cannot say, in normal circumstances, “Although I saw John go to the
bank, and everyone agreed that it was John, it was not he.”101 This is not an empirical
100Wittgenstein saw the relationship between humor and philosophy (vid. footnote 50). Perhaps the humorist,
like the philosopher, is similarly sensitive to these grammatical irregularities. Comedian George Carlin offers
his own variation on the puzzle of Theseus’ ship:
If a radio station changes its call letters, moves its studio across town, hires all new disk
jockeys, and changes the style of music it plays, but keeps the same frequency, is it still the
same radio station? Suppose they change only the music? On a given day, Flight 23 goes from
New York to Los Angeles. The following month, Flight 23 goes from New York to Los Angeles
again, but the crew is different, the passengers are different and it’s a completely different
airplane. How can both ﬂights be Flight 23? [Brain Droppings, pp. 43–44. Hyperion, NY,
1997.]
101Some might object that when I make a reference to John, I am implicitly also referring to a speciﬁc, biological
being; and when I refer to someone else, say, Tom, I am referring to someone who does not, indeed, cannot,
have the same cellular makeup as John does. But such an objection does not support the assertion that identity is
deﬁnitively cellularly based. In the case of Leopold and Loeb, their contention was that similarity at the cellular
level was the sole criterion for personal identity. To say that the person I knew as John this morning has most
of the same biological cells as the person whom I saw in the evening, is to say something that is, at best, only
trivially true. If I were to be asked whether the person whom I saw in the morning was John or not, saying that that
person and John had the same cells would be a decidedly odd answer. Further, it would not be the ﬁrst thing that
you would look for if you wanted to establish John’s identity. The Language Game of talking about someone’s
identity would not generally make references to identity at the cellular level, except, as was mentioned, in the

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
51
problem because no observation of John in these circumstances will resolve the issue.
By saying “I saw John go into the bank, but it was not he” the speaker has committed a
grammatical, or logical, error, not an empirical one. To be an empirical problem empirical
evidence must be decisive; empirical evidence is not necessary here because we do not
have to see John to know that the statement “I saw John go into the bank, but it was not
he” is false, or senseless. Likewise, there is no grammar or language game for talking
about the identity of something like Theseus’ ship when it changes incrementally. This, in
fact, was one of Wittgenstein’s complaints against philosophy, that it focused on puzzles
that were puzzles merely because they were based on an unusual or unconventional uses
of language. In short, Wittgenstein believed that many philosophical puzzles are really
grammatical puzzles disguised as conceptual or empirical puzzles. It is the unorthodox
use of language that gives the puzzle its mystery, not the conceptual problem it supposedly
represents. As he put it so succinctly,
philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday. [PI §38]
Until Wittgenstein’s work, there was no method for uncovering these kinds of problems, al-
though Ryle comes close to a systematic study of the pathology of expressions in his 1932
case of criminal DNA comparisons. But here the notion of a “person” is somewhat different than our normal
usage, viz., for the FBI the DNA analysis can establish whether someone was physically at a particular place at a
speciﬁc time. But it says nothing about whether the individual in question was awake, asleep, comatose or even
dead. But DNA type is a very narrow interpretation of individuality—only one form of life among many that
are concerned with identity. It cannot be an unequivocal criterion for identity since there are situations where
two “different” individuals can have the same cellular identity. For example, “conﬁdence men” who pretend
to be someone they are not in order to fool an unsuspecting “mark.” Or, cases where individuals have literally
lead more than one life, maintaining two complete identities and, in the case of clever male bigamists, spies or
double-agents, sometimes even two separate families. We can even say, on meeting an old friend, that he is “not
the person he once was.” The famous 19th century case of Phineas Gage comes immediately to mind. Gage was
the ﬁrst person known to have suffered severe damage to the frontal lobes of his brain and survive. But, although
he was the same biological person he was before and suffered no deterioration in his physical abilities, he did
not have the same personality:
So radical was the change in him that friends and acquaintances could hardly recognize the
man. They noted sadly that “Gage was no longer Gage.” So different a man was he that his
employers would not take him back when he returned to work, for they “considered the change
in his mind so marked that they could not give him his place again.” The problem was not
lack of physical ability or skill; it was his new character. [A. Damasio. Descartes’ Error:
Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain, p. 8. Avon Books, NY, 1994.]
Finally, there are rare, but documented cases of individuals suffering from a multiple personality disorder
(dissociationof the personality),where the subject appears to switch between two or more sometimes dramatically
different personalities, some of “whom” don’t even know of the existence of the others. [C. Thigpen and
H. Cleckley. The Three Faces of Eve. 1957] All this is to say that our concept of personal identity in ordinary
circumstances is not resolved solely by some reference to cellular identity. The notion of personal identity is
much more dependent on the regularities in the way we talk and interact than any reference to cellular identity.
These issues are, of course, the subject of much good ﬁction, M. Twain’s Puddinhead Wilson, the French ﬁlms
“Mr. Klein,” and “The Return of Martin Guerre” (which was based on fact), and Edward Wooll’s play (later,
movie) “Libel” being examples of how complex our notion of identity can be, and how resistant it can be to the
testimony of physical evidence.

expressions (Like Wittgenstein, Ryle insists that these expressions are misleading for the philosopher, not the
day-to-day speaker of English):
1. “Quasi-Ontological Statements”: Assertions such as “Satan does not exist” cause confusion be-
cause they deny existence to an entity, Satan, while at the same time referring to “him” and thereby
seeming to also assert his existence. Similar cases can be made for “Carnivorous cows” and “Unicorns.”
Even newspapers make such implicit assertions with headlines like “Crowds Fail to Appear.” Figures
in literature pose the same problem when we assert, for example, that Dickens’ Mr. Pickwick “ . . . is
not a real person.”
2. “Quasi-Platonic Statements”: Statements such as “Virtue is its own reward,” or “Unpunctuality
is reprehensible” implicitly assert the existence of universals such as “virtue” and “unpunctuality.”
This is the source of the insistence that universals have an existence in the same way the individual
objects, or particulars, do. What the phrase “Unpunctuality is reprehensible” really means, according
to Ryle, is that “Whoever is unpunctual deserves that other people should reprove him for being
unpunctual.”
3. “Quasi-Descriptions”: Descriptions such as “The Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University” seem to
refer to some person who is “The Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University.” Yet it is clear that although
we can give such descriptions, the entity so described may not exist. That is, although there is a position
for Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, there might not be anyone currently holding that position. Such phrases
seem to describe something, but in actuality do not.
4. “Quasi-Referential Phrases”: Phrases such as, “the top of the tree” or “the center of the bush”
or “the idea of having a holiday” suggest the existence of entities such as “tops of trees,” “centers
of bushes” and “ideas.” Yet it is not clear at all that such entities do, in fact, exist, and there are less
philosophically misleading ways to say the same thing (e.g., instead of saying “I had an idea for a
holiday” I could say, “I thought of a nice place to go for a holiday.”).
The common pathology that runs through all of Ryle’s examples is that they each suggest the existence of “new
sorts of objects.” Interestingly, Ryle claims that one of the most fertile areas for these misleading statements to
do damage is not in philosophy but in physics:
“I suspect that a lot of Cartesian and perhaps Newtonian blunders about Space and Time
originate from the systematically misleading character of the ‘the’—phrases which we use
to date and locate things, such as ‘the region occupied by x,’ ‘the path followed by y,’ ‘the
moment or date at which z happened.’ It was not seen that these are but hamstrung predicative
expressions . . . ” [op.cit., p. 96]
Were Ryle to be writing today he might see the same kind of conceptual errors being made by Artiﬁcial
Intelligence when it talks of “concepts,” “ideas,” “intelligence,” or “meanings” as if they were “things” that
could be studied by themselves and modeled in computer programs.
Wittgenstein made a similar observation:
Imagine a language in which, instead of “I found nobody in the room,” one said “I found Mr.
Nobody in the room.”
Imagine the philosophical problems which would arise out of such a convention. [BB, p. 69]

did.103 Wittgenstein showed how language can mislead us, especially when we are do-
ing philosophy. But these problems in language are not obvious. When we ask for the
“meaning” of a word, or assert that “I know what I am thinking” it seems like we are
saying something quite simple and straightforward. But we are not. The uncomplicated
syntax of surface grammar sometimes gives us a deceptive sense of meaningfulness that
masks the turmoil of “deeper” misunderstanding. Wittgenstein was particularly interested
in showing how the structure, or grammar, of language can lead us astray. This is not
something that can be easily described or explained, but it can be shown, so this is what
he does. Wittgenstein sums up his method succinctly:
My aim is: to teach you to pass from a piece of disguised nonsense to something
that is patent nonsense.104 [PI §464]
While Wittgenstein’s method was central to his later work, he spends precious little time
describing how he does it. Of course, the reader of Philosophical Investigations can watch
him do this grammatical analysis, but there is no explicit attempt on Wittgestein’s part to
describe his methodology except in the briefest detail. Wittgenstein felt, no doubt, that
this kind of analysis was better shown rather than explained. But because of Wittgenstein’s
reluctance to explain his method, even the careful reader may miss how he does it, seeing
only the philosophically interesting linguistic puzzles that he uncovers, and not the method
by which he does it. Wittgenstein’s ﬁrst mention of the method of his grammatical analysis
comes in §150 of Philosophical Investigations:
(a) “Understanding a word”: a state. But a mental state?—Depression, excitement,
pain, are called mental states. Carry out a grammatical investigation as follows: we
say
“He was depressed the whole day.”
“He was in great excitement the whole day.”
“He has been in continuous pain since yesterday,”—
We also say “Since yesterday I have understood this word.” “Continuously,”
though?—To be sure, one can speak of an interruption of understanding. But in
what cases? Compare: “When did your pains get less?” and “When did you stop
understanding that word?”
(b) Suppose it were asked: “When do you stop understanding that word?” All the
103Although Wittgenstein was the ﬁrst major philosopher to focus so much of his analysis on grammar, he is
not the ﬁrst to recognize the importance of this point of view. His mentor, Bertrand Russell once wrote before
he met Wittgenstein:
The study of grammar, in my opinion, is capable of throwing far more light on philosophical
questions than is commonly supposed by philosophers. Although a grammatical distinction
cannot be uncritically assumed to correspond to a genuine philosophical difference, yet the
one is prima facie evidence of the other, and may often be most usefully employed as a source
of discovery. [The Principles of Mathematics, p. 42. Cambridge, 1903.]
104Or, as Wittgenstein puts it, more metaphorically, “What is your aim in philosophy?—To shew [sic] the ﬂy the
way out of the ﬂy-bottle.” [PI §309]

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
time? or just while you are making a move? And the whole of chess during each
move?—How queer that knowing how to play chess should take such a short time,
and a game so much longer! [PI §150]
We can see how important Wittgenstein’s grammatical analysis is for the investigation of,
here, mental states. But this method is clearly at odds with the traditional ways philosophers
or psychologists often went about such an investigation. Philosophers often use some form
of introspection to analyze “mental states,” or some kind of reduction in which “mental
states” are broken down into constituent properties, while psychologists generally get
subjects to report on their mental states looking for what is common in these various
reports.105 Wittgenstein, though, takes the proper study of even something as complex
and elusive as a “mental state” to be best approached by grammatical analysis. He starts
out with some things that most would agree are mental states: depression, excitement or
pain. We can say things like, “He was depressed the whole day,” or, “He was excited the
whole day,” or, “He was depressed until she came back,” or, “He was excited, at ﬁrst, but
then he heard something that calmed him down.” The question Wittgenstein raises here is
whether “understanding” is a mental state or not. If it is, then we should be able to use the
word “understanding” in the same grammatical ways that we can use the words for mental
states like “depression” and “excitement.” So the following sentences should be OK:
“He understood the whole day.” (versus, “He was excited the whole day.”)
“He understood until she came back.” (versus, “He was depressed until she
came back.”)
These sentences with “understood” make us somewhat uncomfortable. But perhaps the
problem is that “understand” is a transitive verb while “was depressed” or “was excited”
is not: Let’s try the following:
“He understood geometry for the whole day.”
“He understood Spanish until she returned.”
Itisclearthatanobjectof“understanding”doesnotimprovethings.Tomakethedistinction
sharper, let’s try making the time more precise:
“He was depressed from 4:00 to 6:00 today.”
This seems OK, but if we substitute “understood” here we get:
“He understood geometry from 4:00 to 6:00 today.”
105Thetotalrelianceofphilosophicalinquiryonintrospectioniscalled“psychologism,”a positionﬁrstarticulated
in the early 19th century by German philosophers Jakob Fries and Friedrich Beneke as a reaction to the dominant
philosophy of Hegel. Wittgenstein does not argue against psychologism, per se, and no prominent philosopher
contemporary with him held allegiance to its most strict version (i.e., that introspection is the only foundation
of philosophical inquiry). Frege, an early inﬂuence on Wittgenstein, was a critic of German psychologism,
while Carnap, a member of the Vienna Circle, argued against psychologism in his Der Logische Aufbau der
Welt (Berlin, 1928). Wittgenstein was just reacting to the tendency among his contemporary philosophers
and psychologists to look predominantly at mental events (either introspected or reported by others) when
investigating cognition.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
55
The last sentence doesn’t sound right at all. This casts doubt on the idea that “understand-
ing” is a mental state like “depression” or “excitement.” This is the crux of Wittgenstein’s
“depth grammatical analysis.” Notice that in doing this we didn’t rely on introspection or
reduction, as some philosophers might do, nor did we ask a number of subjects to report
their own mental events, as a psychologist might. Yet we have uncovered some of the
characteristics of a comparatively “deep” notion of how our mind works.
One of the more interesting confusions we can have is when we think we have made an
empirical statement when, in fact, we have not. Consider Wittgenstein’s observation:
“I know . . . only from my own case.”—what kind of proposition is this meant to be
at all? An experiential one? No—a grammatical one? [PI §295]
Thegrammaroftheverb“toknow”canmisleadusinthefollowingsense:weallunderstand
the assertion, “I know that this tree is an oak.” But when we say, “I know that I am in pain”
are we making the same kind of statement? The surface grammar of the two statements is
identical, but Wittgenstein says “no,” they are not the same kind of statement. The reason
for this is evident from the following grammatical analysis where we change the above
statements slightly:
“I know that this tree is an oak, but I could be mistaken.”
“I know that I am in pain, but I could be mistaken.”
The ﬁrst statement is ﬁne, but the second one is clearly strange—how can we be mistaken
about the physical sensations we feel? We simply feel pain or we don’t—there is no mistake
about it. Yet being mistaken is certainly part of our understanding of what it means to know
something—part of the language game of “knowing.” But in the second sentence it is clear
that being mistaken simply doesn’t enter into the situation at all. Looking at the surface
grammar of the two statements, it appeared that we had two ordinary assertions about
what we know. But when we performed a depth grammatical analysis like we did above,
we saw that they were quite different. In fact, the two statements come from two entirely
different, but similar, language games. The statement, “I know that this tree is an oak”
is an assertion about observable facts. The statement, “I know that I am in pain” is not a
statement about observable facts. “I know that I am in pain” merely declares that “I am
in pain.” Personal doubt and being mistaken do not enter at all into the language game of
reporting one’s feelings—they have no grammatical place in them (of course, the listener
can have his own doubts and his own criteria for judging the truthfulness of such reports
by others, but that is a different issue). No amount of self-observation can conﬁrm or deny
the statement, “I know that I am in pain.” Hence, the statement “I know that I am in pain”
is a “grammatical” proposition, not an “experiential” one. By this Wittgenstein means that
the statement attains its validity or usefulness by virtue of its grammatical structure and
placement, not by virtue of any experience of self-observation.
The most important aspect of Wittgenstein’s depth grammatical analysis is that we have
learned something about how our mind works without investigating any mental events
at all. We have moved the inquiry away from the difﬁcult and unreliable investigation of
mental events, that are by deﬁnition private and therefore hard to generalize from, to the

56
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
examination of events that we all have easy access to. It would be difﬁcult for anyone to
answer the question, “Is ‘understanding’ a mental state?,” but it would probably take only
an average grasp of the English language to see the distinctions that Wittgenstein wants us
to see with his examples. Nothing is hidden in this kind of analysis, but the comparative
ease with which we can see these distinctions makes us think that we have somehow
missed the solution—it’s too easy. We expect that because these problems—such as the
analysis of mental states—are so “deep” their solution must be “deep” and difﬁcult, too.
But Wittgenstein warns us that we must resist the temptation to look for something deeper
or more essential in our analysis, here, of the mental status of “understanding”:
We feel as if we had to penetrate phenomena: our investigation, however, is directed
not towards phenomena, but as one might say, towards the “possibilities” of phe-
nomena. We remind ourselves, that is to say, of the kind of statement that we make
about phenomena.
...
Our investigation is therefore a grammatical one. Such an investigation sheds light
on our problem by clearing misunderstandings away. Misunderstandings concern-
ing the use of words, caused, among other things by certain analogies between
the forms of expression in different regions of language—some of them can be
removed by substituting one form of expression for another; this may be called
an “analysis” of our forms of expression, for the process is sometimes like one of
taking a thing apart.106 [PI §60]
Although Wittgenstein continually refers to “grammar” in Philosophical Investigations,
and other of his later writings, it is important to point out that the object of his analysis is
“depth grammar” rather than “surface grammar.” “Surface grammar” can be taken as what
we normally refer to as syntax—the relations between parts of speech such as nouns, verbs,
participles or adverbs. Rules of surface grammar tell us that sentences like, “The boys
is coming” are incorrect. These relationships are of little concern for Wittgenstein. His
“depth grammar” concerns how words go together in speciﬁc situations and circumstances,
in other words, how they ﬁt in their respective language games.
In the use of words one might distinguish “surface grammar” from “depth gram-
mar.” What immediately impresses itself upon us about the use of a word is the
way it is used in the construction of the sentence, the part of its use—one might
say—that can be taken in by the ear.—And now compare the depth grammar, say
106Malcolm recounts one of Wittgenstein’s lectures in which he (Wittgenstein) described his philosophical
method somewhat differently:
What I give is the morphology of the use of an expression. I show that it has kinds of uses of
which you had not dreamed. In philosophy one feels forced to look at a concept in a certain
way. What I do is to suggest, or even invent, other ways of looking at it. I suggest possibilities
of which you had not previously thought. You thought that there was one possibility, or only
two at most. But I made you think of others. Furthermore, I made you see that it was absurd
to expect the concept to conform to those narrow possibilities. Thus your mental cramp is
relieved, and you are free to look around the ﬁeld of use of the expression and to describe the
different kinds of uses of it. [N. Malcolm. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir, p. 50. Oxford
University Press, London, 1972 (reprint of 1958 edition).]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
57
of the word “to mean,” with what its surface grammar would lead us to suspect. No
wonder we ﬁnd it difﬁcult to know our way about. [PI §664]
Hacker spells out the difference between “surface” and “depth” grammar in more detail:
There are no “surface rules” and “deep rules,” such that the deep rules have the sta-
tus of hypotheses which explain the surface rules. Wittgenstein’s contrast between
surface and depth grammar (PI §664) is the contrast between the immediate appear-
ance of a word, its mode of occurrence in a given sentence, and the “multitudinous
paths leading off from it in every direction”—that is, the different transformations
of which the sentence admits, the kinds of consequences it implies, the manner of
its context dependence, its role in the language-game, the various combinatorial
possibilities of the word and so forth. These are not “hidden” from view, but visible
to any speaker of the language who is willing to look around—at the common
use of the expression in question. They are not hypotheses, but familiar truisms of
which we need to be reminded. Hence the methods of philosophy are descriptive,
and argumentative . . . 107
To see “what is the meaning of a word” and “what is the length of a marathon” as gram-
matically similar is to only look at the surface grammar of these expressions. It is the
surface grammar of expressions that confuses us, because from this point of view sen-
tences look like they have the same structure when they, at a deeper level, do not.108 One
aspect of Wittgenstein’s method that will strike the reader with a background in philos-
ophy is the almost total lack of introspection it contains. Much Western philosophy is
the result of the reﬂections of very bright individuals on their own thought processes.
Wittgenstein is mistrustful of these reﬂections. In fact, he believes that they cannot form
the basis of any signiﬁcant epistemology. While the philosopher has some insight into
how he arrives at certain thoughtful outcomes, he has no reliable basis for showing that
others do this the same way that he does. In fact, as Wittgenstein demonstrates, for almost
any intellectual activity that we can engage in, the supposed thoughtful prerequisites can
be entirely missing, just as they were for the artist in our earlier example. We can speak,
argue, promise, direct, joke or any number of other intelligent activities without preceding
or accompanying them with any conscious thought whatsoever.109 If conscious thought

1996.
108Although Wittgenstein’s early philosophy of language had signiﬁcant differences from his later views, his
metaphorical sense of language as having a visible, or “surface” aspect, which lay above a “deeper” less obvious
aspect had very early roots in his work. This can be seen from the following description of language found in
his Notebooks 1914–1916 predating even his TLP which was ﬁrst published in 1921:
Words are like the ﬁlm on deep water. [p. 52]
109Although I will discuss Wittgenstein’s argument for such non-conscious, intelligent activity in a later section,
it is useful to note here two of the best discussions of this issue apart from Wittgenstein’s writings: Norman
Malcolm’s “Wittgenstein: The Relation of Language to Instinctive Behavior,” Wittgensteinean Themes: Essays
1978–1989. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 1995. Edited by G.H. von Wright. And John Canﬁeld’s “Wittgen-
stein and Zen.” Philosophy, vol. 50, 1975, pp. 383–408. Also of related interest is Polanyi’s notion of “tacit
knowledge.” Polanyi realizes that conscious thought does not necessarily precede intelligent activity. But instead
of saying that such thought does not have to be there at all, as Wittgenstein does, he claims that this intelligent

58
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
need not precede or accompany such intelligent activity, then it is clear that examining
such thought when it does exist will not give us any deeper insight into these cognitive
processes. For Wittgenstein, since conscious thought is not necessary for intelligent ac-
tion, then to understand intelligence we must look elsewhere. If we look at what people
who perform the same intelligent activity have in common we ﬁnd, not common intellec-
tual processes, but common language, abilities, practices, and customs. These common
abilities and practices Wittgenstein called the “forms of life,” or the “natural history” of
mankind. They are “. . . simply what [we] do.” [PI §217]
What we are supplying are really remarks on the natural history of human beings;
we are not contributing curiosities, however, but observations which no one has
doubted, but which have escaped remark only because they are always before our
eyes. [PI §415]
Having established Wittgenstein’s method of investigation—analysis of depth grammar—
we can now look more closely at the results of his investigations.
Wittgenstein at Work: Philosophical Investigations
In order to see how Wittgenstein analyzes language it is perhaps best to look at the ﬁrst
few paragraphs of Philosophical Investigations in some detail. The basic framework of
his methodology and a description of the major issues of language and thought exist in
these opening statements.
Wittgenstein begins with a quotation from Augustine110:
[Augustine]When they (my elders) named some object, and accordingly moved
towards something, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was called by the sound
they uttered when they meant to point it out. Their intention was shewn by their
bodily movements, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the expression
of the face, the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the
tone of voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting, or
avoiding something. Thus, as I heard words repeatedly used in their proper places
in various sentences, I gradually learnt to understand what objects they signiﬁed;
and after I had trained my mouth to form these signs, I used them to express my
own desires. [PI §1]
Wittgenstein then comments:
These words, it seems to me, give us a particular picture of the essence of human
language. It is this: the individual words in language name objects—sentences are
combinations of such names.—In this picture of language we ﬁnd the roots of the
following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the
word. It is the object for which the word stands.
mental activity must be there, only “tacitly.” This is why we are not aware of it. Wittgenstein ﬁnds no evidence
that this is the case.
110PI §1, from Augustine. Confessions, I. 8.Translation from the original Latin by G.E.M. Anscombe.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
59
Augustine does not speak of there being any difference between kinds of word.
If you describe the learning of language in this way you are, I believe, thinking
primarily of nouns like “table,” “chair,” “bread,” and of people’s names, and only
secondarily of the names of certain actions and properties; and of the remaining
kinds of word as something that will take care of itself.111 [PI §1]
Wittgenstein’s comments don’t directly dispute the Augustinean view of language, they
merely point out some of the major implications of it. This is the way that Wittgenstein
often presents views that he differs with, and on a ﬁrst reading it can sometimes appear that
Wittgenstein is presenting a view that he agrees with (some of the quotations that he makes
and responds to in Philosophical Investigations are actually views that he held at one
time). He does not agree with the Augustinean view of language meaning and language
acquisition. But the reader can only see this in retrospect since most of the arguments
against these positions are not offered until later.
Several things stand out in these ﬁrst few comments. Of particular importance are the
words “picture” and “essence.” Augustine, Wittgenstein states, gives us a “picture of the
essence of human language.” Augustine has encapsulated a theory of meaning in just a
few short remarks, but this description is misleading in several important ways. In the
ﬁrst place, the notion of a “picture” being an explanation strikes at the root of one of
the major differences between Wittgenstein’s early and later thought (as represented by
the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus and Philosophical Investigations, respectively). In
Wittgenstein’s early work he insisted that meaning in language, in particular, propositions,
could be represented by a picture. It was only later that he saw that pictures were not
unambiguous representations, that they also required interpretation. But Wittgenstein did
not explicitly say this until later in the Philosophical Investigations. In a footnote at the
bottom of page 11, Wittgenstein states:
Imagine a picture representing a boxer in a particular stance. Now this picture can
be used to tell someone how he should stand, should hold himself; or how he should
not hold himself; or how a particular man did stand in such-and-such a place; and
so on. [PI §22]
This is not Wittgenstein’s last word on the subject. Forty-three pages later, in another
footnote, he comments:
I see a picture; it represents an old man walking up a steep path leaning on a stick.—
How? Might it not have looked just the same if he had been sliding downhill in that
position? Perhaps a Martian would describe the picture so. I do not need to explain
why we do not describe it so. [PI §139]
But it isn’t until §663, fully 157 pages later that Wittgenstein ﬁnally takes an explicit stand
against the picture theory of meaning:
If I say “I meant him” very likely a picture comes to my mind, perhaps of how I
looked at him, etc.; but the picture is only like an illustration to a story. From it
111PI §1. The idea that words are “names” goes much further back in history, at least to Plato [“The Republic,”

60
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
alone it would mostly be impossible to conclude anything at all; only when one
knows the story does one know the signiﬁcance of the picture. [PI §663]
Not only does one need to know the story before one can understand the signiﬁcance of
the picture, one needs to know the story before one formulates the picture. Like medieval
monks illuminating manuscripts, we create the images in our consciousness to accompany
our understanding, not represent it. Imagine looking at an old text with illustrations to
accompany the text of a story. Now look at another illustrated text, but look only at the
pictures without reading the text. In most cases, it would be impossible to grasp the entire
story by just looking at the pictures. We can usually understand the story without the
accompanying pictures, but we cannot understand the full signiﬁcance of the pictures
without the story. Even comic books, which tell their stories almost entirely with pictures,
usually need some text to accompany the illustrations. It is extremely difﬁcult to tell an
explicit story of reasonable length and modest complexity solely with illustrations. (By
“reasonable length” I mean a story requiring more than a few pictures.) Wittgenstein
illustrates the “danger” of pictures in the following description:
Of course, if water boils in a pot, steam comes out of the pot and also pictured
steam comes out of the pictured pot. But what if one insisted on saying that there
must also be something boiling in the pictured pot? [PI §297]
The ﬁnal comment about the picture theory of meaning comes in part II of PI on page 184:
What this language primarily describes is a picture. What is to be done with the
picture, how it is to be used, is still obscure. Quite clearly, however, it must be
explored if we want to understand the sense of what we are saying. But the picture
seems to spare us this work: it already points to a particular use. This is how it takes
us in.
For a more amusing debunking of the view that pictures are unambiguous representations,
consider Mark Twain:
In this building we saw . . . a ﬁne oil painting representing Stonewall Jackson’s last
interview with General Lee. Both men are on horseback. Jackson has just ridden up,
and is accosting Lee. The picture is very valuable, on account of the portraits, which
are authentic. But, like many other historical picture, it means nothing without its
label. And one label will ﬁt it as well as another:
First Interview Between Lee and Jackson.
Last Interview Between Lee and Jackson.
Jackson Introducing Himself to Lee.
Jackson Accepting Lee’s Invitation to Dinner.
Jackson Declining Lee’s Invitation to Dinner—with Thanks.
Jackson Apologizing for a Heavy Defeat.
Jackson Reporting a Great Victory.
Jackson Asking Lee for a Match.
. . . a good legible label is usually worth, for information, a ton of signiﬁcant attitude
and expression in a historical picture. In Rome, people with ﬁrm sympathetic
natures stand up and weep in front of the celebrated “Beatrice Cenci the Day Before

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
61
Her Execution.” It shows what a label can do. If they did not know the picture, they
would inspect it unmoved, and say, “Young Girl with Hay Fever; Young Girl with Her
Head in a Bag.” [M. Twain. Life on the Mississippi, p. 216. Airmont Publishing,
NY, 1965.]
ThesecondwordthatstandsoutinthequotationfromPI§1(supra)istheword“essence”—
Augustine’s stated view of language has said something that applies to all language. Again,
it is only on further reading that we see that Wittgenstein differs markedly with any attempt
to stipulate an “essential” view of meaning in language. The desire to ﬁnd and describe
the “essence” of language, leads to a very deep and fundamental mistake in philosophical
analysis. Wittgenstein’s strongest statement against trying to ﬁnd an “essence” of language
comes in PI §65, in his discussion of language games:
Here we come up against the great question that lies behind all these
considerations.—For someone might object against me: “You take the easy way
out! You talk about all sorts of language-games, but have nowhere said what the
essence of a language-game, and hence of language, is: what is common to all
these activities, and what makes them into language or parts of language. So you
let yourself off the very part of the investigation that once gave you yourself most
headache, the part about the general form of propositions and of language.”
And this is true.—Instead of producing something common to all that we call
language, I am saying that these phenomena have no one thing in common which
makes us use the same word for all—but that they are related to one another in
many different ways. And it is because of this relationship, or these relationships,
that we call them all “language.”112 [PI §65]
But if Wittgenstein says that looking for the essence of language is a mistake, then what
should we do in its place? Wittgenstein gives us a hint 16 pages later:
Whenphilosophersuseaword—“knowledge,”“being,”“object,”“I,”“proposition,”
“name”—and try to grasp the essence of the thing, one must always ask oneself: is
the word ever actually used in this way in the language-game which is its original
home?—
What we do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.
[PI §116]
Wittgenstein brings up one of the major mistakes of philosophical, analysis: he argues
that what the philosopher should be concerned with is not the essence of language, but
with how these words are used in ordinary contexts. The meanings of words such as
“knowledge,” “being,” etc., appear to refer to very deep concepts, and philosophers have
focused much of their analysis on ﬁnding general, essential, deﬁnitions of these words
that would be applicable in all cases. To Wittgenstein, this is a mistake. If we want to ﬁnd
out what these words really mean, we shouldn’t take them out of their ordinary context,
but look at the multitude of their everyday uses:
112Note in particular, Wittgenstein’s equivalence of the “essence” of language games and the “essence” of
language.

62
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Only in the stream of thought and life do words have meaning.113 [Z §173]
Where does this desire to reduce meaning in language to essential general deﬁnitions
come from? Wittgenstein tells us in an earlier work:
Our craving for generality has another main source: our preoccupation with the
method of science. I mean the method of reducing the explanation of natural phe-
nomena to the smallest possible number of primitive natural laws; and in mathemat-
ics, of unifying the treatment of different topics by using a generalization . . . it can
never be our job to reduce anything to anything, or to explain anything. Philosophy
really is “purely descriptive” . . .
Instead of “craving for generality” I could also have said “the contemptuous attitude
towards the particular case.”114 [BB pp. 17–18]
113Also: “For words have meaning only in the stream of life.” [RPP II §686]. Even if we want to relate word
meaning to something mental, that is, something internal, Wittgenstein reminds us that “What goes on within
also has meaning only in the stream of life.” [LWPP II, p. 30]
114Our “craving for generality” may have an even more fundamental source than “our preoccupation with the
method of science.” Some investigators have asserted that our ability to break things down into their constituent
parts and put them back together again in new ways is the characteristic that distinguishes us from other
mammals. All mammals have the ability to perform “holistic pattern recognition” since they can recognize
things like different animals, situations or geographical settings by picking out the salient features of these
entities from the welter of accompanying sense data. But only humans can break these perceived things down
into constituent parts and then reassemble them in new or different ways [Warren, as reported in Donald, infra]
This ability to break something down into its constituent parts and then reassemble them in various ways is called
“generativity.” [Corballis] It originated in primitive man’s ability to make tools from a number of constituent
parts. Having done this with objects in his environment, man, over many eons, was able to internalize this ability
until he could break less tangible things—like concepts or mental images—into their constituent parts. Having
broken something down into its constituent parts, man was then able to assemble these parts in new and different
ways; that is, he was able to “generate” new objects by varying how the parts went together. This “generative”
ability is an essential component of what we now call reduction. The distinction between generativity and holistic
perception is instantiated in our brains: generativity exists largely in the left hemisphere of our brain while holistic
perception, or pattern recognition exists in the right hemisphere. Donald comments:
In his evolutionary scenario, Corballis argued that generativity ﬁrst emerged in the left hemi-
sphere for praxic skill and was essential to the development of tool making, where categorical
analysis of the fashioned object was essential to the ability to reproduce it, that is, generate
new ones. This generative ability expanded its range and eventually enabled the development
of, among other things, language. The evolution of language was secondary, somehow de-
pendent upon the pre-existence of the underlying generative capacity. Since generativity is
the distinguishing feature of left-hemisphere cognition, laterality of function must have been
a key neuropsychological aspect of human cognitive evolution, perhaps because it allowed
humans to retain their traditional cognitive skills in the right hemisphere, while develop-
ing new ones in the left. [M. Donald. Origins of the Modern Mind: Three Stages in the
Evolution of Culture and Cognition, p. 72. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1991.
Donald discusses Warren and Corballis: M.C. Corballis. “Laterality and Human Evolution,”

Speech Evolution,” Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, vol. 280, pp. 708–731,
1976.]
If it is true that this reductive capability is not just cognitively based, but physiologically based, then it must
take remarkable self-control not to look for the constituent parts of things—real or imagined. Our “craving for
generality” may be as strong as any other physiological craving we can have. This desire to break things down

Wittgenstein continues:
The idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to ﬁnd
the common element in all its applications has shackled philosophical investigation;
for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss as irrelevant
the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him to understand the usage of
the general term. [BB p. 19]
The focus of philosophical analysis on essential deﬁnitions of words is not a new concern.
Socrates spent many of Plato’s dialogues trying to ﬁnd essential deﬁnitions of important
words like “truth,” “beauty,” “good,” etc. Socrates was smart enough to see that these
essential deﬁnitions were impossible to formulate. But since Socrates believed that “true
knowledge,” required these essential deﬁnitions, then, a fortiori, man cannot have “true
knowledge.” Like Socrates, Wittgenstein would have agreed that such essential deﬁnitions
are impossible to formulate, but unlike Socrates, Wittgenstein would not have seen that
as important.
We are unable clearly to circumscribe the concepts we use; not because we don’t
know their real deﬁnition, but because there is no real “deﬁnition” to them. To
suppose that there must be would be like supposing that whenever children play
with a ball they play a game according to strict rules.115 [BB p. 25]
Our knowledge is not grounded in essential deﬁnitions, but in ordinary language and the
“bustle of life”:
We judge an action according to its background within human life, and this back-
ground is not monochrome, but we might picture it as a very complicated ﬁligree
pattern, which, to be sure, we can’t copy, but which we can recognize from the
general impression it makes.
into constituent parts and reassemble them in new ways permeates even our mythology and has given us many
fanciful creatures: unicorns, centaurs, Pegasus, Medusa & Pan. Here we conceive of creatures composed of
“parts” which can be combined in unique and curious ways to produce mythical beings which conjoin “parts”
from two unrelated animals. Wittgenstein had some sense of how powerful this compulsion is to look for the
simple constituent parts of things very early on in his philosophy. In his Notebooks 1914–1916 he states:
And it keeps on forcing itself upon us that there is some simple indivisible, an element of
being, in brief a thing.
It does not go against our feeling, that we cannot analyze PROPOSITIONS so far as to mention
the elements by name; no, we feel that the WORLD must consist of elements. [Notebooks
1914–1916, p. 62. Harper and Brothers, NY, 1961.]
The importance of Wittgenstein’s rejection of reduction cannot be overemphasized. So central to his later
philosophy was this rejection that he at one time considered using the following quotation from Butler as the
epigraph for his Philosophical Investigations:
. . . everything is what it is and not another thing. [G. Kreise. “The Motto of Philosophical Investigations and
the Philosophy of Proofs and Rules,” Grazer Philosophische Studien, vol. 6, p. 15, 1978.]
115“When Socrates asks the question, ‘what is knowledge?’ he does not even regard it as a preliminary answer
to enumerate cases of knowledge.” BB p. 20. Wittgenstein was referring to Plato’s “Theaetetus,” 146D–147C.

64
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The background is the bustle of life. And our concepts point to something within
this bustle. [RPP II §§624–625]
If we return to our original quotation in which Wittgenstein continues his comments on
the Augustinean view of language, we can see several other implications that he draws:
. . . the individual words in language name objects—sentences are combinations of
such names—In this picture of language we ﬁnd the roots of the following idea:
Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object
for which the word stands. [PI §1]
This is a simple referential theory of meaning: that words stand for “objects” or things.
Wittgenstein makes no comment about the validity of such a claim, here, though he
certainly disagrees with it. He waits until PI §27 to raise an objection:
“We name things and then we can talk about them: can refer to them in talk.”—As if
what we did next were given with the mere act of naming. As if there were only one
thing called “talking about a thing.” Whereas in fact we do the most various things
with our sentences. Think of exclamations alone, with their completely different
functions.
Water!
Away!
Ow!
Help!
Fine!
No!
Are you inclined still to call these words “names of objects?”116 [PI §27]
A simple referential theory that applies to all words is easy to dismiss, as Wittgenstein
does here. But if we go back to the original quotation we see that Wittgenstein is less
interested in showing the poverty of the simple referential theory of language than he is
to show what it implies.
In this picture of language we ﬁnd the roots of the following idea: Every word has
a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the
words stands. [PI §1]
The notion that each word has a “meaning” associated with it is a much more difﬁcult claim
to refute than “words name objects.” These remarks demonstrate one of Wittgenstein’s
techniques of analysis: he begins with a plausible statement about some phenomenon, then
shows that it can be easily changed—by substitution of different words—into something
that is incorrect and misleading. In describing Augustine’s theory of language he does
not initially criticize it, as we have shown. This, I think, is on purpose. Wittgenstein’s
116Note in this citation that Wittgenstein’s statement begins with a quotation. In general, Wittgenstein’s remarks
made within quotation marks are not statements that he necessarily agrees with, but are ones that he wants to
react to in some way. Sometimes he even quotes a statement that he himself once made.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
65
uncritical portrayal of the simple referential theory of language—words stand for objects—
gives it an initial plausibility, and it is an easy view to hold if we think of words like
“chair,” “shoes” or “tree.” But if we hold this simple view, and then think of things that
are not physical objects, such as the exclamations—“Help! . . . No!”—we have only two
alternatives: give up the simple referential theory of meaning, or alter it in some way so that
it can accommodate anomalies such as the ones above. If one begins with the assumption
that language has an essence and the observation that many words appear to be deﬁnable
ostensively, then it will be hard to give up the simple referential theory of meaning.
Wittgenstein’s claim that this view of language has some similarities to the scientiﬁc
method, which is highly esteemed, makes it even more attractive. So, before giving up the
theory, the observer will try to ﬁnd another kind of “object” for which words stand.117 Of
course it is easy to ﬁnd such an object: a “meaning” or “concept.” But although this gives us
a plausible way of accommodating the anomalies of reference that Wittgenstein describes,
it really just gets us in deeper trouble. The reason why this view is more misleading than
Augustine’s original formulation is that it directs the analysis of language away from
speciﬁc, observable activities to “concepts” or “meanings”—mental events—which are
much more difﬁcult to examine objectively. When Augustine wants to show us what the
word “chair” means, he points to a chair and utters the word. We can immediately see
what he means by this (we teach children the meanings of many words this way). But if
we say that the word “Help” is deﬁned by a “concept” or “meaning,” what do we “point
to?” For Wittgenstein, the analysis of internal, or mental, events can be the source of much
confusion.118
There is one more problem implicit in the view that “Every word has a meaning. This
meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.” [PI §1]
Simply stated, this view can lead one to think that all meaning—regardless of what the
“meaning” is—is tied to individual words, and that the meanings of sentences or expres-
sions are merely the combination of the meanings of the words they contain. What this
view misses is that the context in which the words or sentences are uttered can have a role
in determining the meaning of a statement. Wittgenstein does not bring up or deal with this
difﬁculty here, but this issue will become one of the main concerns of his later philosophy
and its origin can be traced to the idea that “. . . the individual words in language name
objects—sentences are combinations of such names.”
117Karl Popper called this tendency for investigators to alter a theory to ﬁt new incompatible observations the
“conventionalist stratagem”:
Some genuinely testable theories, when found to be false, are still upheld by their admirers—
for example, by introducing ad hoc some auxiliary assumption, or by reinterpreting the theory
ad hoc in such a way that it escapes refutation. Such a procedure is always possible, but it
rescues the theory from refutation only at the price of destroying, or at least lowering, its
scientiﬁc status. (I later described such a rescuing operation as a “conventionalist twist” or a
“conventionalist stratiegem.”) [Conjectures and Refutations, p. 33. Harper and Row, NY,
1968.]
118The reader should not construe that Wittgenstein holds that ostensive deﬁnition is a simple matter and works
well with clear objects, such as trees, chairs, etc. He actually believes that there must be a lot of “stage setting”
before such ostention works. Here he only means to show that such a theory is plausible in certain cases, and
how that plausibility, plus a belief that language works in only one way, leads to a major misunderstanding.

66
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Continuing our discussion, we ﬁnd that Wittgenstein hints at another cause for believing
that all words have meanings:
Augustine does not speak of there being any difference between kinds of word.
If you describe the learning of language in this way you are, I believe, thinking
primarily of nouns like “table,” “chair,” “bread,” and of people’s names, and only
secondarily of the names of certain actions and properties; and of the remaining
kinds of word as something that will take care of itself. [PI §1]
He says that this results from our considering an example of just one kind of word, and then
assuming, without examination, that all other kinds of words must have similar meanings.
Wittgenstein was to state this problem more forcefully later on:
A main cause of philosophical disease—one-sided diet: one nourishes one’s think-
ing with only one kind of example. [PI §593]
In summary, then, the Augustinian view of language claims that:
i. Words name objects.
ii. The meaning of a word is the object for which it stands.
iii. Every word has a meaning.
iv. The meaning of a word is independent of context.
v. The meaning of a sentence is composed of the meanings of its words.
vi. Teaching consists of pointing to objects and saying their names.119
“Five Red Apples”
Wittgenstein continues his analysis of language by presenting the following example:
Now think of the following use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a
slip marked [“ﬁve red apples”]. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the
drawer marked “apples”; then he looks up the word “red” in a table and ﬁnds a color
sample opposite it: then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he
knows them by heart—up to the word “ﬁve” and for each number he takes an apple
119G.P. Baker and P.M.S. Hacker. An Analytical Commentary on Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations,
vol.1,p.22.TheUniversityofChicagoPress,Chicago,1985.BakerandHackerrightlypointoutthatWittgenstein
would agree with at least two of the implications of Augustine’s view of language:
[Augustine] stresses bodily behavior as “the natural language of all peoples” and as a pre-
condition of language and language-acquisition, a point Wittgenstein himself emphasizes
§§185, 202–207, etc. Secondly, he insists that the child’s learning required hearing “words
repeatedly used in their proper places in various sentences” and hence that meaning and un-
derstanding presuppose mastery of combinatorial possibilities of expressions. (op.cit., p. 22)
[“§§” refer to paragraphs in PI ]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
67
of the same color as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways
that one operates with words.—“But how does he know where and how he is to
look up the word ‘red’ and what he is to do with the word ‘ﬁve’?”—Well, I assume
that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But
what is the meaning of the word “ﬁve?”—No such thing was in question here, only
how the word “ﬁve” is used. [PI §1]
Although Wittgenstein does not explicitly state it, he formulated the above example, at
least in part, as a response to the claim that, “Augustine does not speak of there being
any difference between kinds of word” (supra). For Augustine, all words are names for
objects. The phrase “ﬁve red apples” has three words, each of which is plausibly a “name”:
“ﬁve” is a name for a number; “red” is the name for a color; and, “apple” is the name for
a fruit. “Names” are things we often “look up”: we look up the name of a restaurant in
the Yellow Pages; we look up the name of a particular bird in a bird identiﬁcation book;
we bring a sample of paint to a hardware store and the clerk compares it with paints they
carry to ﬁnd the name of the paint which matches it most closely. So the actions of the
shopkeeper in Wittgenstein’s example constitute an entirely plausible way to act.
This example raises several important points. In spite of the fact that we can describe the
three words as “names,” it is clear that they are being used differently. It is also the case
that the act of “naming” is not as simple and straightforward as it may seem:
When one says “He gave a name to his sensation” one forgets that a great deal of
stage-setting in the language is presupposed if the mere act of naming is to make
sense. And when we speak of someone’s having given a name to pain, what is
presupposed is the existence of the grammar of the word “pain”; it shews [sic] the
post where the new word is stationed. [PI §257]
Understanding the word “ﬁve” requires a background in basic arithmetic and an ability to
count and see similar objects as different individuals (so they can be counted). Understand-
ing the word “red” requires not only an understanding of the names correlated with colors,
but—and this is important—an understanding of how close the “color sample” of red must
be to the color of the apples. The major substantive distinction here between “ﬁve” and
“red” is that “ﬁve” refers to a discrete number whose application is either correct or incor-
rect and does not allow degrees of compliance. If the customer wants “ﬁve red apples,”
only “ﬁve” apples, and neither “four” apples nor “six” apples nor “5.3” apples will do.
There is little ambiguity in counting a simple number (providing one knows how to count).
The color “red,” though, is much more problematic. The color is not a discrete entity like
the number “ﬁve” is. “Red” can vary continuously across a wide spectrum of shades and
hues. Here the shopkeeper must know how to apply the sample color of “red” to the colors
of the apples. Unlike the word “ﬁve” there may be a signiﬁcant difference between the
“red” in the sample and the “red” of the apples. Many of the individual apples will also be
different shades of “red,” so the shopkeeper must have in mind how much variation in the
color of the apples there can be for apples to still be considered “red.” There is a degree
of latitude in applying colors that does not exist in the application of numbers, and this
latitude can only be understood through experience. One can easily construct examples
where colors or numbers might be used according to different criteria. For example, if I

68
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
want to match the color of paint for my car in order to paint a place where the original paint
has been scratched, I need a much more precise matching of colors than I need in the “ﬁve
red apples” example. Further, if I am installing a new ﬂoor in my hallway and I measure
it to be 5.25 feet wide, then only planks of wood of precisely 5.25 feet in length will ﬁt
there. A plank that is 5 feet or 6 feet long will not do—this job requires measurements
more precise than the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . used in the “ﬁve red apples” example.
The word “apples” has a different kind of latitude in its application, too. First of all, the
shopkeeper must be able to distinguish “red apples” from “red peaches,” and among the
apples he must not give the customer red apples that have spoiled or been bruised. The
application of the word “apples” requires a knowledge of what condition the apples must be
in for a customer to want them. This is tied up in a very complex way with how customers
will use the apples, and what the customer’s expectations are for this kind of transaction.
So while the application of the names “ﬁve” and “red” are reasonably straightforward in
this example, the application of “apples” is much more caught up in the behavior and
expectations of people who buy apples (we can imagine a dog or a monkey being trained
to pick up ﬁve apples, and to be able to distinguish between red apples and, say, green or
yellow ones. But it would be hard, I think, to train a dog or monkey to distinguish apples that
are in good enough condition to sell and those that are not. This requires an involvement
and understanding of human affairs that dogs and monkeys do not—and cannot—have).
After giving the “ﬁve red apples” example, Wittgenstein asks, “But what is the meaning
of the word ‘ﬁve’?” He then replies, “No such thing was in question here, only how the
word ‘ﬁve’ is used.”(supra) Although he does not state it explicitly, Wittgenstein’s point
in raising this issue is to show how irrelevant the question “. . . what is the meaning of the
word ‘ﬁve’?” is. If someone wanted to know what “ﬁve red apples” meant, it would be
perfectly reasonable to describe the circumstances in which the phrase is used and what
consequences arose from its use. As Wittgenstein shows later, this is all one needs to
do to make the phrase “ﬁve red apples” understandable. This issue—the “meanings” of
individual words versus the “use” of words—becomes the cornerstone on which Wittgen-
stein builds his theory of language and philosophical analysis. It also moves the object of
philosophical analysis from a quest for the “meanings” of words to an analysis of their
“uses”—that is, from an analysis of “mental events” to an analysis of, primarily, “external
events.” This idea is the source of one of Wittgenstein’s most quoted remarks:
For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word
“meaning” it can be explained thus: the meaning of a word is its use in language.120
[PI §43]
Perhaps a better statement of Wittgenstein’s views on “meaning” and “use” is:
Let the use of words teach you their meaning. (Similarly one can often say in
mathematics: let the proof teach you what was being proved.) [PI p. 220]
Here, we can see that “use” and “meaning” are separate things—“use” teaches us the
“meaning” of words. “Use” and “meaning” are not the same thing as they seem to be in
120See footnote 92 for a discussion of this translation.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
69
the ﬁrst quotation, above: “the meaning of a word is its use in language.” “Use” is not one
thing, and neither is “meaning.” More importantly, “meaning” is often taken as an internal,
mental event, while “use” is more commonly taken as an external event. By emphasizing
the importance of “use” over “meaning” Wittgenstein continues to focus his analysis on
external rather than internal phenomena. One might wonder about the seeming inconsis-
tency of the two quotations, but the two statements are an accommodation, of sorts, to
ordinary usage. That is, given that we use the word “meaning” and such uses are not entirely
senseless, Wittgenstein is offering us a way to use the word “meaning” without its being as
misleading as before. One can almost imagine Wittgenstein shrugging his shoulders and
saying “Alright, if you must use the word ‘meaning’ here’s the way you should do it . . . ”
If the proper subject of philosophical analysis is “language usage” and not the examination
of “concepts” or other abstractions, then there is one subtle, but important consequence:
nothing that is relevant to analysis is hidden. Wittgenstein was ﬁghting a tendency in
philosophy to base philosophical analysis on the examination of mental events that were
elusive or hidden in some way. This is the most important consequence of moving philo-
sophical analysis away from inner mental events to external observable phenomena. It
means that the answers we seek are, in some sense, right before our eyes.121 If there is
anything “hidden” about these it is that they are “hidden” by their familiarity:
The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because of their
simplicity and familiarity. (One is unable to notice something—because it is always
before one’s eyes.) The real foundations of his enquiry do not strike a man at all.
Unless that fact has at some time struck him.—And this means: we fail to be struck
by what, once seen, is most striking and most powerful. [PI §129]
Wittgenstein leaves the “ﬁve red apples” discussion with a ﬁnal metaphor that summarizes
the difﬁculties with analyzing language:
If we look at the example in §1 [the “ﬁve red apples” example], we may perhaps get
an inkling how much this general notion of the meaning of a word surrounds the
working of language with a haze which makes clear vision impossible. It disperses
the fog to study the phenomena of language in primitive kinds of application in
whichonecancommandaclearviewoftheaimandfunctioningofthewords.[PI§5]
121Theideathatmentalprocessescanbehidden, or have hidden componentspervaded muchof the intellectuallife
of ﬁn de si`ecle Vienna, where Wittgenstein grew up. Most prominent at this time was, of course, the dichotomy
of the conscious mind and the unconscious mind proposed by Freud. No doubt, this tendency to assume that our
thought processes contain signiﬁcant unconscious, or hidden, components was a kind of reasoning quite familiar
to Wittgenstein even before he began studying philosophy. Wittgenstein only mentioned Freud a few times,
mostly in conversations with friends (vid. M.O’C. Drury’s “Conversations with Wittgenstein,” Recollections of
Wittgenstein, pp. 97–171. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1984. Edited by R. Rhees. There is also a chapter
in LC that records some of his views on Freud.). Jacques Bouveresse offers a more extended discussion of
what Wittgenstein actually said, or implied, about Freud in his Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the
Unconscious. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1995. Translation from the French by C. Cosman. For
a more critical view, see F. Ciofﬁ’s “Wittgenstein on Freud’s ‘abominable mess,’ ” Wittgenstein Centenary
Essays, pp. 169–192. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1991. Edited by A.P. Grifﬁths. The one Freudian
concept that Wittgenstein did seem to respect was Freud’s idea that many of our mental problems are really
“illnesses” brought on by faulty thinking. This is similar to Wittgenstein’s notion that many of our philosophical
problems are brought on by what he called “diseases of thinking.”

70
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
In this statement, Wittgenstein brings up two major aspects of his method of analysis: First,
he says that in order to deal with the “hazy” notions of meaning in language, one needs
to “disperse the fog” with actual examples of language use. Instead of trying to deﬁne
the meanings of words, we should try to see how we come to understand words through
actual examples of their use. But we don’t formulate any examples of usage, we need to
formulate examples that give us a “clear view of the aim and functioning of the words.”
Wittgenstein introduces a very important concept in his statement, the notion of a “view”
of language. The German word that Wittgenstein uses is the noun “ ¨Ubersicht” (or the
verb form, “¨ubersehen”). There is no single, good English equivalent to this word. Various
translations of the word that have been used are, “view,” or “survey” or the neologism
“surview” suggested by Baker and Hacker.122 Its most common appearance in Philosoph-
ical Investigations is in the adjectival form, “¨ubersichtliche Darstellung,” translated by
Anscombe as “perspicuous representation”123 [PI §122]. What Wittgenstein is getting at
is that the examples of word usage one should look at when trying to discern the mean-
ing/usage of a word are examples that are “perspicuous” or “salient,” ones that reveal more
about the proper usage of a word than a random example might. Perhaps another transla-
tion of “¨ubersichtliche” that might be more faithful to what Wittgenstein meant would be
“exemplary.” This translation of the German would recall Kuhn’s use of “exemplars” as a
component in his disciplinary matrix of scientiﬁc ﬁelds.124 Kuhns’ “exemplars” are really
“exemplary puzzles.” By working through these puzzles the students in a scientiﬁc disci-
pline come to understand, that is, get a “clear view” of their ﬁeld. It is only after working
through these exemplars that the student really comes to understand what the basic con-
cepts of the ﬁeld are, and what the language of the ﬁeld really means. Kuhns’ emphasis on
the educational value of his exemplars resonates with Wittgenstein’s claim that the usage
of language, especially the “¨ubersichtliche Darstellung,” can “teach us the meaning” of
words. Like Kuhns, Wittgenstein’s examples must be perspicuous/exemplary and educa-
tional.125 The word “Darstellung” also has other translations besides “representation.” It
122See the essay “ ¨Ubersicht” in their Wittgenstein, Meaning and Understanding, pp. 295–309. University of
Chicago Press, Chicago, 1985.
123Even Anscombe, Wittgenstein’s principal translator, is not consistent about her translations of “ ¨Ubersicht.”
Later, in Zettel (§464), Ascombe renders “ ¨Ubersichtlichkeit” as “synoptic view.” Whether this represents a
reconsideration of her earlier translation, or is just an unconsidered variation is not clear. (Zettel was published
in 1967 while Philosophical Investigations appeared 14 years earlier in 1953.)
124The components of the “disciplinary matrix” are: Symbolic generalizations; Shared commitment to beliefs;
Shared values; and Exemplars. Kuhn, Thomas. The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions. University of Chicago
Press, Chicago, 2nd ed., 1970. pages 183ff.
125It is important to note that Kuhn’s claim that exemplary puzzles are central to the conduct of science is not
without its critics. Feyerabend writes:
According to [Kuhn’s] interpretation it is the existence of a puzzle-solving tradition that de
facto sets the sciences apart from other activities. It sets them apart in a “far surer and more
direct” way, in a manner that is “at once . . . less equivocal and . . . more fundamental,” than
do other and more recondite properties which they may also possess. But if the existence of a
puzzle-solving tradition is so essential, if it is the occurrence of this property that uniﬁes and
characterizes a speciﬁc and well recognizable discipline; then I do not see how we shall be
able to exclude say, Oxford philosophy, or, to take an even more extreme example, organized
crime from our considerations.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind

can also mean, inter alia, a “performance,” “presentation” or, in the context of the theatre,
a dramatic “production.”126 While “representation” is a perfectly reasonable translation,
“Darstellung’s” translation as a “presentation,” or “performance,” etc., gives the word the
connotation of a process or activity. This connotation is, I think, a very important aspect
of Wittgenstein’s “Darstellung” because he emphasizes that words are intimately caught
up in the activity of language usage. Examples of this usage must be both exemplary and
dynamic—they must reﬂect the meaning of the words as they occur within the context
of ongoing activities.127 So while “perspicuous representation” has been the most widely
used translation of Wittgenstein’s “¨ubersichliche Darstellung,” “exemplary presentation”
brings out some of the other connotations of this complex description.
The “Builder’s Language”
Wittgenstein next tries to show what a language that ﬁts the Augustinean model, where
words are names for things, might look like:
Let us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is right.
The language is meant to serve for communications between a builder A and an
assistant B. A is building with building-stones: there are bricks, pillars, slabs and
beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For
this purpose they use a language consisting of the words “block,” “pillar,” “slab,”
“beam.” A calls them out;—B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at
such-and-such a call.—Conceive this as a complete primitive language. [PI §2]
For organized crime, so it would seem, is certainly puzzle-solving par excellence. Every
statement which Kuhn makes about normal science remains true when we replace “normal
science” by organized crime; and every statement he has written about the individual scientist’
applies with equal force to, say, the individual safebreaker. [P. Feyerabend. “Consolations
for the Specialist,” in Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge, pp. 197–230. Cambridge
University Press, 1970. Edited by I. Lakatos and A. Musgrave.
In his comparison of the puzzle solving capability of normal science and organized crime, Feyerabend leaves
out an important element. When normal science solves a puzzle, it immediately moves on to another puzzle,
leaving the solved puzzle out of consideration for further analysis (the solved puzzle can be used for training,
though). In this way, normal science is “progressive” in its puzzle solving. Organized crime, though, is not
overtly progressive. Once criminals learn how to break open a particular kind of safe, they then concentrate their
efforts on seeking situations where they only have to break open that kind of safe. The typical scientist actively
seeks new puzzles and is not very concerned with puzzles that have been solved.

127The fact that “Darstellung” can be associated with the theater or drama (as a “production”) may also have
been in Wittgenstein’s mind when he used it. Part of his theory of meaning was that words have a context in
which they are used, and this context helps to give them their “sense,” it contributes to their meaning. When
Wittgenstein referred to this context he often referred to it as the “stage setting” necessary to provide the words
with their appropriate sense:
The contexts in which a word appears are portrayed best in a play; therefore, the best example
for a sentence with a certain meaning is a quote from a play. And who asks the character in a
play what he experiences when he speaks?
The best example of an expression with a very speciﬁc meaning is a passage in a play.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
In this example we can see another aspect of Wittgenstein’s method: he constructs hy-
pothetical examples to demonstrate the plausibility of some assertion about language
usage or philosophy. There are two ways that Wittgenstein can make his points about
language and philosophical analysis: he could explain why he believes that his assertions
are the case and offer justiﬁcations to support his beliefs, or he could give examples which
demonstrate perspicuously whether the point in question is valid or not without any ex-
planation. Wittgenstein’s preference for constructing examples rather than explaining or
justifying his assertions is entirely consistent with his claim that philosophical analysis
should consist primarily of descriptions or demonstrations rather than explanations. Care-
fully constructed examples, he believed, demonstrate philosophical points more clearly
than detailed explanations. The reason for this emphasis on examples or demonstrations
is that this is the way that we teach and learn language: a child does not ask for deﬁnitions
and explanations when he is trying to master new words. He needs examples or demon-
strations of how these words are used. Explanations and deﬁnitions are not necessarily
absent from this process, they are just relegated to a minor role and can be often dispensed
with entirely. One of the greatest writers in the English language, Shakespeare, did all
of his writing before there was a published dictionary of the English Language. Clearly
Shakespeare’s audiences didn’t need deﬁnitions to understand the subtle verbal nuances
of his dialogues and soliloquies.128
Wittgenstein maintains the importance of description, or examples, over explanations
throughout much of his writings. In his Blue and Brown Books (written before Philo-
sophical Investigations) he makes the point strongly:
I want to say that it can never be our job to reduce anything to anything, or to explain
anything. Philosophy really is “purely descriptive!” [BB p. 18]
In Philosophical Investigations we ﬁnd Wittgenstein’s strongest statement about the im-
portance of description rather than explanation:
128It is interesting to note that for most of its history, the English Language was spoken by individuals without
the aid of a dictionary. Dictionaries are a relatively recent phenomenon, with Nathan Bailey’s Universal Etymo-
logical English Dictionary, published in 1721, being the ﬁrst English dictionary of modern form. Shakespeare
wrote his plays and poems over a century before, so it can be assumed that his masterful use of the English
Language was gained without the use of any dictionary, as we know it. In addition, his plays were popular with
a broad cross section of Elizabethan society who, except for a small educated aristocracy, were largely illiterate
and could not use a dictionary even if they had one. All of this is not to say that dictionaries and deﬁnitions are
useless for language acquisition. They are useful. They are just not necessary, and much learning of linguistic
meaning can be, and is, done without them.
One can argue, as we will later in this discussion, that the reason that Shakespeare was able to convey his clever
puns and nuanced uses of language to his audiences was that he not only controlled the dialogue of his plays,
but also the context (scenery, music, situations, actors, props, etc.) in which the words were uttered. This context
helped the audience to understand the dialogue even when it consisted of new or creative uses of the language.
Wittgenstein often drew the analogy between drama and understanding by saying that “The best example of an
expression with a very speciﬁc meaning is a passage in a play” [LWPP I §424].
The analogy between the portrayal of meaning in language and dramatic representation is a very important
metaphor in Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language. We will discuss this in more detail in a subsequent section:
“Wittgenstein and Drama: A Dramatic Theory of Meaning.”

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind

We must do away with all explanation, and description alone must take its
place. . . The problems are solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging
what we have always known.129 [PI § 109]
Wittgenstein appears to exclude explanation entirely from philosophical analysis. But,
viewed from our position some 50 years after these words were written, we might ﬁnd
this statement somewhat extreme. Western philosophy has a long tradition of using ex-
planation in philosophical analysis, and this analysis has produced signiﬁcant insights.
Wittgenstein surely does not want to throw all of this out or call all of its results into
question. His concern about explanation is not so much that it never works, since it can
be useful, even in philosophy. Wittgenstein was concerned that philosophers, particularly
the analytic philosophers of the ﬁrst half of the 20th Century, were not wary enough about
how explanations, by their very structure, can lead us astray. There are Language Games
in which explanation is perfectly suited, particularly in scientiﬁc ﬁelds, but there are Lan-
guage Games, some of which are common in philosophy, where Wittgenstein believed it
is not suited. Bertrand Russell, Wittgenstein’s philosophical mentor, believed that philo-
sophical analysis could be improved by making it more like scientiﬁc analysis, which he
took as the ideal method of inquiry. Since explanation is a major method of scientiﬁc
inquiry, Russell believed that explanation should be used more in philosophy. In his later
philosophy, Wittgenstein was to take the opposite view—that the explanatory model was
not only not as useful to philosophy as Russell believed, but that it could be misleading,
too. The quotation from BB p. 18, above, is preceded by the sentence:
Philosophers constantly see the method of science before their eyes, and are irre-
sistibly tempted to ask and answer questions in the way science does. This tendency
is the real source of metaphysics, and leads the philosopher into complete darkness.
[BB p. 18]
The primary difﬁculty with explanation is that it is difﬁcult to know when to stop. No
matter how “complete” an explanation may be one can always imagine further explanation
is possible. Young children are particularly adept at playing this language game:
Parent: “I have to ﬁx the roof.”
7 year old child: “Why?”
Parent: “Because there is a hole in it.”
7 year old child: “Why is there a hole in it?”
“Because the tree branch fell on the roof.”
“Why did the branch fall on the roof?”
“Because we had a big storm yesterday.”
“Why did we have such a big storm?”
“Because we get storms from time to time.”
129In 2001 a revised edition of Philosophical Investigations was published as the 50th anniversary commemo-
rative edition. In the above quotation [PI §109] the last sentence was rendered somewhat differently:
The problems are solved, not by reporting new experience, but by arranging what we have
always known.

“Why isn’t the weather always good?”
“Because the weather can’t always stay the same.”
“Why can’t it stay the same?”
“Because . . . ”
...
Wittgenstein saw the same kind of problem with explanation in philosophy, namely, that
there is no obvious stopping point for this kind of analysis. The open-ended nature of
explanation often causes its users to miss the point where analysis has gone far enough.
The expression “that is all that happens” sets limits to what we call “happening.”
Here the temptation is overwhelming to say something further, when everything
has already been described.—Whence this pressure? What analogy, what wrong
interpretation produces it?
Here we come up against a remarkable and characteristic phenomenon in philosoph-
ical investigation: the difﬁculty—I might say—is not that of ﬁnding the solution
but rather that of recognizing as the solution something that looks as if it were only
a preliminary to it. “We have already said everything.—Not anything that follows
from this, no, this itself is the solution!”
This is connected, I believe, with our wrongly expecting an explanation, whereas
the solution of the difﬁculty is a description, if we give it the right place in our
considerations. If we dwell upon it, and do not try to get beyond it.
The difﬁculty here is: to stop.130 [Z §§312–314]
130Wittgenstein, no doubt, would have liked Wallace Stevens’ poem “The Snow Man” which artfully presents
the requirements for pure description:
One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-tree crusted with snow;
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January sun; and not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
In the sound of a few leaves,
Which is the sound of the land
Full of the same wind
That is blowing in the same bare place
For the listener, who listens in the snow,
And, nothing himself, beholds
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.
[The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens, p. 9. Alfred A. Knopf, NY, 1978.]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
75
Why do we demand explanations? In the ﬁrst place, explanation is obviously widely
used in ordinary discourse. If Wittgenstein wants to ground philosophical analysis in
ordinary language then explanation must be a valid subject for that analysis. Here there
are places for some kind of explanation—our dictionaries, for example. But dictionaries
are a convenience rather than a necessity. It would take a dictionary of great size and
scope to present meanings to the reader entirely by way of examples (the large, multi-
volume Oxford English Dictionary provides both deﬁnitions and examples of usage. We
might expect a dictionary devoted only to examples of usage to be even larger, because
you would need lots more examples to convey all the nuances that might characterize a
word’s meaning. In addition, you would also have to have fairly detailed descriptions of
the context in which the word might be used.). The explanations of a dictionary are a kind
of shorthand presentation of meaning that constitutes a particular language game. They
assume that the reader already has a basic familiarity with the concepts that surround
the word’s use. The reader is still left to ﬁnd out how the words he looks up are used in
everyday life.
To understand the reasons for Wittgenstein’s categorical exclusion of explanation from
his philosophy, we need to remember that the philosophical analysis of his day aspired to
the seeming objectivity and certitude of scientiﬁc explanation. Troublesome philosophical
statements, it was believed, could be broken down and analyzed in the way that a botanist
identiﬁes a particular ﬂower by breaking it down into its constituent parts. For Wittgenstein,
scientiﬁc explanations are not the complete explanations that they are claimed to be, and,
by inference, philosophical analysis that is based on the scientiﬁc model of explanation
is not complete either. Nevertheless, in the writings he completed just before his death
(published in the volume On Certainty)Wittgenstein appeared to see that there was some
role for explanation in philosophical analysis:
At some point one has to pass from explanation to mere description. [OC §189]
Explanations work up to a point, but the foundation on which explanations gain their
validity consists of observations that we can’t analyze or break down further. Getting back
to the “Builder’s Language,” Wittgenstein presents us with a situation that seems to be
a realistic example of Augustine’s notion of language (correlating words with objects).
There are no verbs, prepositions, participles, adjectives or adverbs—words that would
be difﬁcult to ﬁnd “objects” for. The “Builder’s Language” appears to be complete, but
consists only of nouns which are seemingly correlated with objects: “blocks,” “pillars,”
“slabs,” and “beams.” Wittgenstein also gives us a scenario showing how these words are
used. It is a convincing description, and it is a simple matter to imagine that people could
talk to each other this way.131 But having given us such a reassuring example he quickly
131In PI §6 Wittgenstein states:
We could imagine that the language of [the Builders] was the whole language of A and B;
even the whole language of a tribe.
This is a sweeping statement, and Wittgenstein does not offer an extensive justiﬁcation for it. Whether the
Builder’s Language is complete or not is not relevant here. If we can imagine that two individuals talk like this
in some kind of realistic situation, and I think we can, then that is all that is required. (One can imagine a scene

76
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
begins to undermine our conﬁdence in it. Seemingly talking about a third kind of language,
he gives us the following example:
Imagine a script in which the letters were used to stand for sounds, and also as
signs of emphasis and punctuation. (A script can be conceived as a language for
describing sound-patterns.) Now imagine someone interpreting that script as if
there were simply a correspondence of letters to sounds and as if the letters had
not also completely different functions. Augustine’s conception of language is like
such an over-simple conception of the script. [PI §4]
The “over-simple conception” of Augustine’s view of language is that words (or sounds
or letters) can function in only one way. If they do function in one way, then teaching
individuals what words mean is a fairly simple process. But if words can have more than
one function, or mean different things in different contexts, then there are a lot of ways
for people to get the wrong meaning. One can look at a word in one sentence and it
means one thing; but in another sentence the same word could mean something entirely
different—or, in one sentence a word is an adjective and in another it is a noun (e.g., “An
American” vs. “An American car”). Since Wittgenstein is criticizing Augustine’s view of
language, he is, by transitivity, criticizing the “Builder’s Language.” But the “Builder’s
Language” seems to be fairly well grounded in the real world of objects—how could it be
ambiguous? Wittgenstein begins his analysis by examining how a child might learn the
“Builder’s Language”:
A child uses such primitive forms of language [i.e., the “Builder’s Language”] when
it learns to talk. Here the teaching of language is not explanation, but training.
[PI § 5]
Wittgenstein makes the point that the teaching of meaning in language involves primarily
training rather than explanation. This is really the same distinction that he makes between
descriptionsandexplanations.Traininginvolveseitherputtingthechildinsituationswhere
the words in question might be used, or describing the situations for him (if the child is
old enough to understand such descriptions). Wittgenstein uses a child as an example
because the learning of the child is the foundation of understanding for the adult. Adults
are familiar enough with the process of using dictionary deﬁnitions that they might think,
erroneously, that such deﬁnitions are the primary way we learn language. They are not.
in an operating room with a surgeon talking to her assistant: “Scalpel!”; “Retractor!”; “Suction!”; etc.) Rush
Rhees, a former student of Wittgenstein’s, disagrees with the notion that the Builder’s Language could be the
complete language of a tribe:
The trouble is not to imagine a people with a language of such limited vocabulary. The trouble
is to imagine that they spoke the language only to give these special orders on this job and
otherwise never spoke at all. I do not think it would be speaking a language. [“Wittgenstein’s
Builders,” Discussions of Wittgenstein, p. 76. Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1970.]
One might not limit his native language to such a simple language as the Builder’s Language, but we can imagine
someone speaking English who speaks only enough of another language, say German, that his entire mastery of
German consists of something like the Builder’s Language. Norman Malcolm responds to Rhees and defends
Wittgenstein’s position in his “Language Games” [in Malcolm’s Wittgensteinean Themes: Essays, 1978–1989.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
77
The use of dictionary deﬁnitions presupposes that the adult can imagine the context in
which the words in question can be used appropriately. Wittgenstein continues:
We could imagine that the language of §2 [the “Builder’s Language”] was the whole
language of A and B; even the whole language of a tribe. The children are brought
up to perform these actions, to use these actions, to use these words as they do, and
to react in this way to the words of others.
An important part of the training will consist in the teacher’s pointing to the objects,
directing the child’s attention to them, and at the same time uttering a word; for
instance, the word “slab” as he points to that shape. (I do not want to call this
“ostensive deﬁnition,” because the child cannot as yet ask what the name is. I will
call it “ostensive teaching of words.”—I say that it will form an important part of the
training, because it is so with human beings; not because it could not be imagined
otherwise.) This ostensive teaching of words can be said to establish an association
between the word and the thing. But what does this mean? Well, it can mean various
things; but one very likely thinks ﬁrst of all that a picture of the object comes before
the child’s mind when it hears the word. But now, if this does happen—is it the
purpose of the word?—Yes, it can be the purpose.—I can imagine such a use of
words (of series of sounds). (Uttering a word is like striking a note on the keyboard
of the imagination.) But in the language of §2 it is not the purpose of the words to
evoke images. (It may, of course, be discovered that that helps to attain the actual
purpose.)
But if the ostensive teaching has this effect,—am I to say that it effects an under-
standing of the word? Don’t you understand the call “Slab!” if you act upon it in
such-and-such a way?—Doubtless the ostensive teaching helped to bring this about;
but only together with a particular training. With different training the same osten-
sive teaching of these words would have effected a quite different understanding.
[PI §6]
For Wittgenstein, Augustine’s “ostensive teaching of words” is not the unambiguous pro-
cess that it seems: “. . . an ostensive deﬁnition can be variously interpreted in every case”
[PI §28]. Ostensive teaching must be accompanied by training. It is not enough for the
child to understand the object that is correlated with the word “slab,” he must also be able
to react or do something in the appropriate way. What other ways could B act when A
calls out “Slab!?” First, he must know that “slab” is a real word and not just gibberish or
a curse; then, he must understand that the word is directed at him, and not someone else;
he must then recognize the word as a command (this may mean that B must recognize in
A’s gestures and tone of voice that the word is a command, and that a command would be
an appropriate thing for A to say to him in this situation). But even if B understands all
of this, are there still other ways that he could react to the command “Slab!?” Certainly.
“Slab!” could mean “Bring me a slab!,” “Take away the slab!,” “Turn over the slab!” “Put
the slab in the trash!” “Break the slab up into pieces!,” “Jump up and down on the slab!,”
“Put the proper postage on the slab and mail it!” etc., etc. The only limit to the number of
interpretations of “Slab!” is the number of different things that you can do to or with the
slab (here, it is also limited by the number of things B can do with the slab within the ac-
tivity of building, and, although this is fewer things to do, there still might be a signiﬁcant
number of different procedures that the builder can carry out with a slab). How would

78
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
the teacher get B to understand that “Slab!” means “Bring me a slab!?” The teacher must
show how “Slab!” is used, perhaps by showing A giving the order “Slab!” to someone else.
But, of course, all of this presupposes that B understands the concept of a command, and
the concept of following orders, and that if you work for someone, that person can give
you commands and expect them to be carried out, and that when you build something you
must bring the appropriate pieces of construction together at the right time, etc., etc. Even
this simple command presupposes a fairly high level of understanding of common human
activities before the command “Slab!” can be understood—as Wittgenstein put it: “a great
deal of stage-setting in the language is presupposed if the mere act of naming is to make
sense” [PI §257] Wittgenstein waits until PI §19 to take up a major objection to his de-
scription of what role understanding and training play in understanding the word “Slab!.”
Since Wittgenstein does not answer this objection here, it is important to spend some time
to illustrate his unstated opinion. He proposes that “Slab!” is an elliptical, sentence . . . the
command “Slab!” is merely a shortened version of “Bring me a slab!.” This is a tempting
explanation, since we can imagine A saying “Bring me a slab!” a number of times until B
understands what it means, then A can shorten the command by stages to “Bring a slab!,”
“Slab, here!” and ﬁnally, “Slab!.” Most adults have experienced such elliptical sentences,
and it is well known that words or phrases that are used frequently will gradually become
shortened in ordinary usage (e.g., how the word “automobile” became shortened over
time to “auto” and then “car”). But Wittgenstein resists this explanation, even though it
is possible that it could have happened this way (not for the builder and his assistant in
Wittgenstein’s example, though, since they only have four words in their vocabulary). Why
is it so important to resist the disambiguation of “Slab!” by “lengthening” it into the less
ambiguous sentence, “Bring me a slab!?” In the ﬁrst place, the semantic preciseness of
“Bring me a slab!” is not as unambiguous as it may seem at ﬁrst. “Bring me a slab!” could
be construed to be a “shortening” of “Bring me a slab and put it near me. Then wait for my
next order.”; or, “Bring me a slab and help me put it in the right place, which I’ll point to.”;
or, “Bring me a slab, but be careful not to hurt yourself. Ask for help if you need it.”; or,
“Bring me a slab now/quickly/soon/when you get around to it/tomorrow/etc.”; or, “Bring
me a slab and place it so the better side is face up.”; or, “Bring me a slab, but be careful
not to drop it since it may break. If it breaks, we can’t use it, we will lose money and you
will be ﬁred.”; etc. But even with all of these longer, more detailed variations of “Bring
me a slab!” one might still insist that we could formulate a single longer, unambiguous
sentence, or set of sentences, that explains all that is implicit in the command “Slab!” in
these circumstances. It might be a very long sentence or set of sentences, but it is certainly
possible to do it. But Wittgenstein’s objection is not that we cannot come up with such
an unambiguous sentence. We probably could (though just like explanation in general, it
may be difﬁcult to know when to stop). He takes issue with the assumption that it would
be a proper explanation of what “Slab!” really means. This assumption is not only wrong,
it gives us a false sense of understanding. Again, the real meaning of “Slab!” is not more
words and sentences. The solution is, as Wittgenstein often says, right before our eyes. We
understand the real meaning of “Slab!” because we are trained to do so and we can use it
successfully in some established practice, not because there is some “more detailed” verbal
description that is implicit in “Slab!.” B understands A’s command because B has worked
with him or other builders, or on similar projects, and understands what sort of things he is
expected to do. This training does not take the form of explaining what B is to do, it takes

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
79
the form of showing or demonstrating what he is to do, and this process may be largely
non-verbal, even with individuals who have a more complex language than the builder
does. Wittgenstein continues the above quotation [PI §6] with the following metaphor:
“I set the brake up by connecting up rod and lever.”—Yes, given the whole of the rest
of the mechanism. Only in conjunction with that is it a brake-lever, and separated
from its support it is not even a lever; it may be anything, or nothing. [PI §6]
When Wittgenstein puts a comment in quotation marks, he is usually identifying a state-
ment that he wants to react to. Generally it is a statement that one would consider reason-
able, sometimes it is even a statement that Wittgenstein himself has made. Wittgenstein’s
comments are aimed at the quoted statement. This statement epitomizes a particular type
of problem that can afﬂict analysis, the tendency to look at superﬁcial aspects of a problem
and ignore, or just not see the complexity of the “rest of the mechanism.” For Wittgenstein,
words are the part of language that is most visible to us. At ﬁrst it seems that these words are
the only part of language that really matters. When we say that each word in our language
has its own meaning, and sentences are combinations of these meanings, then it is easy
to make the further inference that a word somehow carries its entire meaning—nothing
need be added to the analysis of meaning than the analysis of words. But for Wittgenstein,
if we do this we are like the person who believes that to “set the brake” all he needs
to do is connect “up rod and lever.” Connecting the rod and lever is seen as a complete
explanation of how to set the brake. But this explanation ignores the “whole of the rest
of the mechanism” that is necessary for the rods and levers to work. What is the “rest of
the mechanism” for language—what underlying mechanism exists that is necessary for
language to work? Wittgenstein doesn’t say a lot here, but the careful illumination of this
“mechanism” is the subject of much of the rest of Philosophical Investigations. Brieﬂy,
the “rest of the mechanism of language” consists of the surrounding context of human
activities—the “forms of life,”—and a number of dynamic formal linguistic practices that
are embedded in these activities—what he called “language games.” These are what enable
the “mechanism” of language to work.
Language Games
In the next paragraph Wittgenstein introduces the “language game”:
We can also think of the use of language (2) [the “Builder’s Language”] as one
of these games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call
these games “language games” and will sometimes speak of a primitive language
as a language-game.
And the processes of naming the stones and of repeating words after someone might
also be called language-games. Think of much of the use of words in games like
ring-a-ring-a-roses.
I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is
woven, the “language-game.” [PI §7]

80
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The language-game is one of the most important components of Wittgenstein’s philosophy
of language. Wittgenstein resists, as we might expect, giving a rigorous deﬁnition of it,
but that does not mean that it is not a rigorous notion. As usual, we must see its rigor
in the examples Wittgenstein gives us. The problem that Wittgenstein faced was how to
reconcile the need in language for a predictable structure that determines how the words
in language go together, with the simultaneous need for ﬂexibility in usage. Further, the
structure must be dynamic: it must be able to account for regularities in language that
extend over time (such as holding a discussion). Structure in language is necessary so
that we can speak in predictable ways and be understood, but ﬂexibility is necessary, too,
in order to permit new or creative uses of language—something important when we face
new or different situations, or have to describe something we don’t understand well. These
situations do not have to be entirely new, but merely new to the speaker. The notion of a
language-game provides both the predictable structure in language as well as the ﬂexibility
that allows us to talk about new or unusual situations. Consider the game of baseball, for
example: there are rules, that can be codiﬁed and written down, but within these rules
there is enormous latitude for innovative play. Importantly, the rules of baseball do not
prescribe every possible action within the game. They specify what may be called a “fair
ball,” but do not prescribe how the runner should run to ﬁrst base, except to say that he
must stay within the base path—he may run, hop, skip or do somersaults down the base
path if he wants to. On the defensive side, it provides general rules for what counts as an
“out,” but it says nothing about how a ﬁelder may catch a “ﬂy-ball”—he can catch the
ball in front of him, behind his back or he can do a back-ﬂip before his catch. He doesn’t
even have to catch the ball in his glove, either. He can catch the ball in his bare hand, as
inﬁelders often have to, or he could catch the ball in his cap or his shirt.
The aspects of games that are important for language-games may consist of the following
characteristics:
1. A predictable structure: Usually codiﬁed as a set of rules and may be written down
in some sports, like basketball or football, or may be proposed informally by casual
players of a game, such as two children playing catch.132 For games in which the
132It may be useful to distinguish different kinds of rules here. Searle makes the distinction between “constitutive
rules” and “regulative rules”:
. . . regulative rules regulate antecedently or independently existing forms of behavior: for ex-
ample, many rules of etiquette regulate inter-personal relationships which exist independently
of the rules. But constitutive rules do not merely regulate, they create or deﬁne new forms of
behavior. The rules of football or chess, for example, do not merely regulate playing football
or chess, but as it were they create the very possibility of playing such games. . . Regulative
rules regulate a pre-existing activity, an activity whose existence is logically independent of
the rules. Constitutive rules constitute (and also regulate) an activity the existence of which is
logically dependent on the rules. [J. Searle. Speech Acts, pp. 33–34. Cambridge University
Press, 1969.]
Constitutive rules are of three general kinds: implicit, explicit and ad hoc (Searle does not draw these distinctions).
Implicit constitutive rules are like the U.S. Constitution or the Bill of Rights. They already existed before we
were born, and we accept them implicitly by virtue of our growing up in the United States. We may choose to
disobey them, as criminals do, or we may argue about their validity or consistency, which lawyers sometimes do.
But in general, such implicit constitutive rules are accepted, eo ipso, by U.S. citizens. In information systems,

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
81
rules are written down, a continual violation of the rules might mean that the
players are not really playing the game. That is, they are disobeying the explicit
constitutive rules of the game. By violating the constitutive rules they, in effect,
deny the existence of the game as it is formally set up. For example, if we allowed
two goalies for each side in a hockey game, we would be playing a game that is like
hockey, but the actions of the players and the character of the game would be subtly
changed by the addition of the extra goalies. Thus, we would not be playing hockey
as it is normally known. These codiﬁed rules specify what counts as a fair game,
but they do not specify certain basic regularities that the game assumes by being
embedded within the broader context of human activities. Games in particular are
embedded in our understanding of games in general. For example, we need not have
rules that state that the losing player should not beat up the winning player, or that
basketball players cannot eat the ball. These actions would be considered bizarre
in any game as we presently know it. In ancient Rome, though, wrestling matches
were sometimes conducted until one player was killed. One might conclude that
the Roman notion of “game” was different in this regard than ours is. Some of the
rules of games are left open to interpretation, such as a rule against cheating. Such
a rule rarely speciﬁes what counts as cheating, they merely specify the penalties
for getting caught. How do we know what cheating is? This requires training and
experience. We must play or observe the game we are interested in repeatedly,
until we get a grasp of what kind of actions constitute cheating and which do
not. Some games, especially at the higher more skillful levels have referees that
make immediate rulings on the legitimacy of certain actions (think of the umpire
in baseball, or the referee in a boxing match). Sometimes rules that may appear
the same actually are quite different when they are applied to different games. For
example, both football and hockey have rules against ﬁghting, but, at least at the
professional level in the United States, ﬁghting is tolerated much more in hockey
than in football. But hockey does not permit as much ﬁghting as boxing—ﬁghting
is the point of boxing. But even in boxing there are some things that opponents can’t
do that are permitted in football, such as throwing a block at an opponent’s knees,
and in hockey you are sometimes permitted to hit players from behind, which you
established federal regulations governing how long certain information, such as personnel records, must be kept
by an employer is an example of implicit constitutive rules.
Explicit constitutive rules are those constitutive rules which we formally accept, and do not bind us unless
we do accept them (and often the acceptance follows a precise procedure). For example, the institution of
marriage or membership in the Moose Lodge requires that we formally accept the constitutive rules of these
institutions. Often, too, institutions based on explicit constitutive rules have speciﬁc procedures for getting out
of the institution (e.g., married couples get divorced, Moose Lodge members have second thoughts, etc.).
Finally, there are ad hoc constitutive rules which we not only formally accept, but also formulate ourselves, often
with the agreement of others. For example, we can start our own version of the Moose Lodge.
All constitutive rules are based on agreement between individuals, and naturally they are all subject to change,
modiﬁcation or interpretation. Agreements can change over time, and such rules may vary greatly in their
difﬁculty or requirements necessary to change. We could also classify the institutions based on these rules as
implicit, explicit and ad hoc. (see Searle’s The Construction of Social Reality [The Free Press, 1995] for more
discussion of constitutive and regulative rules.)

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
cannot do in football or boxing. There may also be changes in the rules over time.
For example, in professional American football two decades ago, the defensive
linemen, as they tried to stop the offense, could slap the side of an offensive
lineman’s helmet in their rush. Sometime later, this move was outlawed and there is
now a penalty against any defensive player who does it. In professional basketball,
up until a number of years ago all shots (excluding free throws) counted two points.
Now, shots from farther away than the top of the key count three points. These
are just a few examples of how dynamic the notion of a “game” is. Wittgenstein
believed that this sort of dynamic structure was necessary for language, too. This
is why the metaphor of a “game” ﬁts so well with language usage.
2. A point or goal: This provides a focus for the intentions of the “players,” although
not all games, as Wittgenstein rightly points out, have a goal or an explicit point.
We can imagine children kicking a ball back and forth without any explicit goal
other than to return the ball in the general direction of the other person. [See
quotation 12 in the section in Part I “Surveying Wittgenstein’s Landscape”]
3. Flexibility of performance: There is a wide latitude in terms of what kind of
performance is permitted within the boundaries of the game’s structure. One needs
only to think of the thousands of plays that a professional football quarterback
must commit to memory to understand how much diversity there can be, even in
something as regulated as American football.
4. The need for training and practice: In order to “play” the game, one needs to be
taught how to play. Some of this teaching may take the form of explanation, but
most of it takes the form of being coached—trying to play the game and have a
coach offer suggestions as the play goes on. The learning may also take the form
of watching skilled players. Playing a game is like mastering a technique with
demonstrations being more useful to the novice than explanations. But one must
attain a certain minimum level of expertise before coaching can be effective.
5. Performance is not necessarily accompanied by conscious mental processes: Many
highly skilled athletes claim that they have little conscious thought during their per-
formance. They perform at an intuitive or instinctive level. In fact, there is evidence
that consciously thinking about your performance may actually makes your perfor-
mance worse—as professional baseball star Yogi Berra put it, “You can’t think and
hit at the same time.” This is the main point of the popular book The Inner Game of
Tennis.133 The author asserts that in order to learn a sport or improve your perfor-
mance, it is better for you to watch better players or visualize your successful per-
formance. Trying to, for example, break down your swing in tennis into its “com-
ponents” will lead to mediocre performance, at best. Likewise, conscious thoughts
are not usually necessary for Language Games either, which is why Wittgenstein
133W. T. Gallwey. The Inner Game of Tennis. Random House, NY, May 1974. In fact, Gallwey suggests that
when your opponent is beating you, the best way to get him to start playing badly is to ask him what he is doing
to play so well. This will get him to begin consciously thinking about his game which will, in turn, lead to poorer
play on his part.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
83
sees little point in examining our thoughts if we want to understand how we use
language. It is also better to watch others use language if we want to learn how to use
it ourselves. The importance of instinctive behavior in language will be discussed
in the subsequent section “The Foundation of Language in Instinctive Behavior.”
6. The ability to formulate families of games—to derive new games out of old ones.
Many games grow out of existing games and derive their rules and intent from pre-
vious games. One needs only to think of the relation of American baseball and its
antecedent game of English cricket. American football, Canadian football, rugby,
and Australian football form a “family of similar games.” For language, there are
families of similar activities that provide the basis for similar Language Games—
for example, promising to pay borrowed money back to a friend, promising to mow
a neighbor’s lawn, and signing a business contract to provide speciﬁc products or
services, are all variations in the family of Language Games called “promising.”
Interestingly, many athletic games build themselves on certain individual skills
that are developed in childhood, often independently of any formal game: skills
like jumping, running, holding one’s balance, throwing an object, catching an
object, etc. Language Games are also often built on individual skills that are
learned apart from language games: skills like acting honestly and forthrightly,
being kind and respectful to others, doing what you’re supposed to do, etc.
7. Games can rely on other games for some of their codiﬁcation. For example, some
of the constitutive rules for American baseball grew out of the British game of
cricket. Similarly, much of the structure of American football grew out of the
game of rugby. These games were probably more civilized versions of ancient
games that served to improve and maintain the warrior skills of their participants.
8. Games are embedded in, and inﬂuenced by, the larger context of human activities.
This provides a way of instilling extraordinary complexity into a game without
having to codify all of the complexity. It also means that from a superﬁcial point
of view games look rather uncomplicated. Consider the notions of “fairness,”
“cheating” or “unsportsmanlike conduct.” These concepts are set within a broader
context than the individual games of which they are a part. We might say that it
would be unfair for college basketball teams to play high school teams, or, for a
professional boxer to ﬁght an amateur. We might say it is cheating for a card player
to surreptitiously look at this opponent’s cards, or, for a golfer to make a sudden
loud noise when his opponent takes a swing at his ball. We might say that it is
unsportsmanlike for a defeated player to refuse to shake hands with the winner,
or, for a tennis player to throw a tantrum when a line-call goes against him. In
none of these cases is the use of these concepts prescribed solely by the rules or
conduct of the game in which it occurs. And these concepts are learned, not by
learning deﬁnitions and rules for their application, but by seeing demonstrations
or having instances of their occurrence in actual games pointed out to us.
9. Games help individuals build and reﬁne their social and interpersonal skills, such
as, the ability to follow rules reliably, the ability to make and interpret rules, the
ability to coordinate one’s actions with others, etc.

84
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
10. Games take place over time, consisting of certain broadly-prescribed “moves” and
“counter moves” or “responses.” Language too, is not just a collection of words
and meanings, but consists of a number of predictable transactions extending
over time such as those known as “Speech (or, Illocutionary) Acts.” Traditional
grammar speciﬁes the structure of individual sentences or clauses, but there are
many linguistic transactions that extend beyond the single sentence. Speech acts
(or, Illocutionary acts) have been more successful at categorizing some of these
transactions over time. There are 6 major kinds of Speech Acts:
Directives (orders)
Commissives (promises)
Expressives (expressions of opinion, such as an evaluation or an apology)
Assertives (claims for existence)
Declarations(formalpronouncements,suchasadeclarationofmarriage,where
the statement, by virtue of its expression in the appropriate circumstances,
creates something; here, a marriage. In short, “Saying makes it so.”)
Assertive Declarations (where a declaration is based on an observed oc-
currence; for example, an umpire calling a base runner “out.” Here, the
declaration is also an assertion that the runner failed to perform in a way
that would have made him “safe.”)
What is also important for speech acts, which echoes Wittgenstein’s view of
language games, is that there is a surrounding context and circumstances that are
prerequisites for the linguistic transactions to work. For example, only a minister,
justice of the peace or a ship captain can declare a couple married, and the couple
must themselves be willing and eligible to marry. Any one else making such a
declaration would not be able to ofﬁcially marry a couple. Austin called these
“felicity conditions.” Without them the speech act cannot work.134
134Austin’s [How to do Things with Words, Oxford University Press, 1962] description of illocutionary acts
as having a grammatical structure and a set of felicity conditions prescribed by social context and conventions
has a rough parallel with Wittgenstein’s description of language usage as being based on language games, which
consist of “. . . language and the actions into which it is woven. . . ” [PI §7]. There is no evidence that Austin’s
work was in any way inﬂuenced by Wittgenstein’s, even though they were both prominent in British philosophy
in the 1940’s (Austin at Oxford, and Wittgenstein at Cambridge). In fact, Austin considered himself more aligned
with G.E. Moore’s work than Wittgenstein’s. Hacker recounts:
If Ryle, among the leading Oxford ﬁgures, had learnt the most from Wittgenstein, Austin was
the least inﬂuenced. “Some people like Witters,” he remarked, “but Moore is my man.” [Hacker
attributes Austin’s remark to the recollections of P. Strawson and P. Grice. Wittgenstein’s
Place in Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy, p. 172. Blackwell, 1996. Hacker goes
on to identify the principal similarities and differences between Austin and Wittgenstein, pp.
172–173.]
Although there are similarities in some of their work, their main point of difference lies in their entirely different
purposes in studying language. Wittgenstein hoped to uncover mistakes in reasoning that were due to linguistic

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
85
This list is not meant to be complete or unchangeable. Further, it is not necessary that
every kind of game have all these characteristics. Although Wittgenstein introduces the
confusions. These confusions, he thought, underlay many prominent philosophical problems. Austin was less
interested in ﬁghting the brushﬁres of traditional philosophical debate than in analyzing the ordinary use of
language for its own sake (he did not claim, as Wittgenstein did, that his analysis would clear up any long-
standing philosophical disputes). Hacker gives an example:
[Austin] found linguistic investigations of interest in their own right, and delighted in uncov-
ering subtle, unnoticed differences in linguistic idiom. (Why “very” allows the substitution of
“highly” in some cases (“very unusual”) but not in others (“very depressed” or “very wicked”)
is not a question which is likely to have interested Wittgenstein.) [ibid.]
Austin’s work was extended by J. Searle [Speech Acts: An Essay in the Philosophy of Language. Cambridge
University Press, 1969]. While Searle describes a number of differences between his own and Austin’s work (pri-
marily, that Austin was describing illocutionary verbs, not illocutionary acts, as Searle wanted to do), their work
has many striking similarities. Searle’s classiﬁcation of speech acts into Representatives, Directives, Commis-
sives, Expressives and Declarations, has unmistakable antecedents in Austin’s work. Austin has the same basic
number of categories of illocutionary acts, but calls them Verdictives, Exercitives, Commissives, Behabitives and
Expositives. (Searle also described two further categories, Assertive Declarations, and (later) Indirect Speech
Acts). Searle’s contribution to speech act theory was to focus on the acts themselves and to try to describe
the conditions necessary for the successful performance of those acts. Austin and Searle also showed that the
proper study of language was not just the formal features of words and sentences (syntax, statistical properties
of language, etc.) but of the broader context of speech acts:
A great deal can be said in the study of language without studying speech acts, but any such
purely formal theory is necessarily incomplete. It would be as if baseball were studied only
as a formal system of rules and not as a game. [op.cit. p. 17]
What is implicit in this quotation is that the body of rules of a game are not complete explanations or represen-
tations of the game. The notion of “a game” is much broader than an explicit set of constitutive or regulative
rules can convey. It is an intensely human activity much of which cannot be codiﬁed entirely in a set of rules.
Wittgenstein would be sympathetic with such a portrayal. If there is a difference between Searle’s work and that
of Austin and Wittgenstein, it is that Searle claimed that his categories of speech acts covered all such transactions
that were possible in language. Austin saw these categories as only rough approximations of the kinds of speech
acts, of which he believed were between 1,000 and 10,000 [Austin, op.cit., p. 150, n.1]. Wittgenstein believed
that there were simply too many different kinds of language games to count or classify. For example, consider
the following two instances:
One corporation agrees to provide some service or product to another corporation. This
agreement takes the form of a contract, which is drawn up and handled by the corporate
counsel in each company.
Neighbor A promises to pick up neighbor B’s mail and to mow his lawn while neigh-
bor B is away on vacation.
For Searle, both of these instances are promises (what he calls “commissives”) and, from a categorical point of
view, they are the same. Wittgenstein, and probably Austin too, would see these as very different activities. It
is true that both involve a promise, of sorts. But clearly the “felicity conditions” (Austin) or the “stage-setting”
(Wittgenstein) that make these two promises work are vastly different. Certainly Neighbor B would not hold
Neighbor A legally liable if he did not mow his lawn for him, but a business would certainly hold another business
legally liable if they did not meet the terms of their contract. To say these commissives are both the same would
be like saying a mosquito and a Stealth Bomber are the same because they both have wings and ﬂy.
Paragraph §23 in PI, in which Wittgenstein talks of the enormous number of language games, is the statement that
Searle takes issue with. But Wittgenstein anticipates Searle’s more narrow point of view in the next paragraph:

86
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
concept of a language game in PI §7 of Philosophical Investigations, he does not discuss
it at any length until PI §§65–67:
Here we come up against the great question that lies behind all these
considerations.—For someone might object against me: “You take the easy way
out! You talk about all sorts of language-games, but have nowhere said what the
essence of a language-game, and hence of language, is: what is common to all
these activities, and what makes them into language or parts of language. So you
let yourself off the very part of the investigation that once gave you yourself most
headache, the part about the general form of propositions and of language.”
And this is true.—Instead of producing something common to all that we call
language, I am saying that these phenomena have no one thing in common which
makes us use the same word for all,—but that they are related to one another in
many different ways. And it is because of this relationship, or these relationships,
that we call them all “language.” I will try to explain this.
Consider for example the proceedings that we call “games.” I mean board-games,
card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them
all?—Don’t say: “There must be something common or they would not be called
‘games”’—but look and see whether there is anything common to all. For if you
look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities,
relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don’t think, but look!—
Look for example at board-games, with their multifarious relationships. Now pass
to card-games; here you ﬁnd many correspondences with the ﬁrst group, but many
common features drop out, and others appear. When we pass next to ball games,
much that is common is retained, but much is lost.—Are they all “amusing?”
Compare chess with noughts and crosses. Or is there always winning and los-
ing, or competition between players? Think of patience. In ball games there is
winning and losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and catches it
again, this feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played by skill and luck; and
at the difference between skill in chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games
like ring-a-ring-a-roses; here is the element of amusement, but how many other
characteristic features have disappeared! And we can go through the many, many
other groups of games in the same way; can see how similarities crop up and
disappear.
And the result of this examination is: we see a complicated network of similarities
overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similar-
ities of detail.
If you do not keep the multiplicity of language-games in view you will perhaps be inclined
to ask questions like: “What is a question?”
That is, if you do not keep this multiplicity of language games in mind then you are likely to clump them
together in general categories that span large numbers of examples but which will mask important differences
that exist between speciﬁc examples. Asking “What is a question?” implicitly assumes that a “question” is one
kind of thing, and misses the enormous diversity that different questions can take (direct questions vs. rhetorical
questions vs. leading questions, etc.). In our example, grouping all promises together into one category obscures
important differences they may have.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
87
I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than “family
resemblances”; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build,
features, color of eyes, gait, temperment, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the
same way.—And I shall say: “games” form a family.
And, for instance the kinds of number form a family in the same way. Why do we
call something a “number?” Well, perhaps because it has a—direct—relationship
with several things that have hitherto been called number; and this can be said
to give it an indirect relationship to other things we call the same name. And we
extend our concept of number as in spinning a thread we twist ﬁbre on ﬁbre. And
the strength of the thread does not reside in the overlapping of many ﬁbres.
But if someone wished to say: “There is something common to all these
constructions—namely the disjunction of all their common properties”—I should
reply: Now you are only playing with words. One might as well say: “Something
runs through the whole thread—namely the continuous overlapping of those ﬁbres.”
[PI §§65–67]
Baker and Hacker describe some of the characteristics of what they call “invented language
games.” These are the games that Wittgenstein makes up to demonstrate a particular gram-
matical point. But these characteristics must be similar to those that comprise language
games that Wittgenstein does not invent—ones that already exist in our language. Again,
these characteristics do not deﬁne what language games are, but give us some properties
that might help us to understand them. Wittgenstein’s invented language-games display
many features which are given varying prominence for philosophical purposes at hand. A
language-game contains the following:
(i)
Words, and sentences formed from them according to combinatorial rules: the vo-
cabulary is given and its use in speech acts (moves in the language-game) speciﬁed.
(ii)
Instruments: . . . Wittgenstein calls (a) gestures, as used in teaching the use of
“there,” (b) patterns, whether samples, words, or ﬁgure drawings, and (c) pictures
in a table which correlates words and pictures . . . This accords with his favored
tool analogy for words. Most importantly, it extends the concepts of language and
grammar to include elements hitherto regarded (by linguists and philosophers) as
extraneous. This is a remarkable innovation . . .
(iii)
Context (Zusammenhang): it is important to distinguish the generality of the
notion of context that is being used and the purpose for which it is brought into
view. Like any other game, a language-game is “played” in a setting. Wittgenstein’s
stress on the context of the game appears to be motivated by the wish to bring
to the fore elements of linguistic activities which, while not obviously involved
in the explanation of the meaning of constituent expressions (hence unlike
instruments), are nevertheless pertinent to their meaning. At its most general the
notion of context encompasses the presuppositions of meaning . . . These may be
very general features of the natural world, for example, agreement in responses
(to injury, color, pointing. etc.) . . .

88
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
(iv)
Activity of the game: this feature is related to the former. It is in the activities con-
stitutive of a language-game that the point and purpose of linguistic expressions
is evident . . .
(v)
The use, purpose, role, and function of instruments, words, sentences (and
occasionally even language-game themselves): these are crucially important
features . . . in [Wittgenstein’s] view the cardinal error of 20th-century philosophy
has been the focus upon form and structure of expression rather than upon these
features.
(vi)
Learning games: we do learn games, and the foundation of this learning is training.
In many of his invented language games Wittgenstein sketches the different kinds
of training necessary for a participant to be able to play . . . This highlights the
nature of rule-following, and the way in which the “gap” between rules and their
application is bridged. It emphasizes the presuppositions of explanation and the
prerequisites of doubt and question. It is the crucial component of the claim that
all explanation comes to an end . . .
(vii)
Completeness: Wittgenstein commonly emphasizes that his invented games are
not fragments of a language, but should be considered as complete.135
A number of questions arise in response to Wittgenstein’s concept of language games.
In the ﬁrst place, Wittgenstein brings up language games within the context of a child’s
learning language:
Language games are the forms of language with which a child begins to make use
of words. The study of language games is the study of primitive forms of language
or primitive languages. [BB p. 17]
This seems to imply that the only use of language games is for children learning to master
“primitive forms of language.” If this is the case, then the large areas in language of adult
discourse appear to lack language games; in other words, language games only cover a
small, primitive part of language. This is not a correct inference. If it is the case that
children use language games to learn language, then why shouldn’t language games be a
means for all learning in language? It stands to reason that the method that the child uses
to learn language should be useful for adult language learning, too—that the method the
child uses to learn language would not suddenly change to some other method when the
child becomes an adult. Wittgenstein never states that adults learn language differently
than children do, nor does he even hint that it might be the case. From a methodological
point of view, there is no good reason for adults to learn new words and phrases any
differently than children do.
Wittgensteinoftenreferstolanguagegamesas“primitive,”leavingonetoquestionwhether
all language games are primitive. But this notion is dispelled on further reading:
135Backer and Hacker, Essays on the Philosophical Investigations: Wittgenstein: Meaning and Understand-
ing [University of Chicago Press, 1985, pp. 54–55].

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
89
If we want to study the problems of truth and falsehood, of the agreement and
disagreement of propositions with reality, of the nature of assertion, assumption,
and question, we shall with great advantage look at primitive forms of language in
which these forms of thinking appear without the confusing background of highly
complicated processes of thought. When we look at such simple forms of language
the mental mist which seems to enshroud our ordinary use of language disappears.
We see activities, reactions, which are clear-cut and transparent. On the other hand
we recognize in these simple processes forms of language not separated by a break
from our more complicated ones. We see that we can build up the complicated
forms from the primitive ones by gradually adding new forms. [BB p. 17]
If it is the case that the employment of language games pervades both our simple and
complex uses of language then it is a reasonable inference that language games are, in
aggregate, a kind of grammar of our language—more precisely, they embody, at least in
part, what Wittgenstein was to call the “depth grammar” of our language. Finally, there
is a more fundamental question that arises naturally in response to Wittgenstein’s model
of language use comprising games. Some readers may object that Wittgenstein’s reliance
on games as a framework for his philosophy of language and mind is naive or, at best,
trivial. How could something as serious as a philosophy of language and mind be based
on something as trivial as “games?” Wittgenstein never addresses this issue, but some
comment may be in order. In the ﬁrst place, when we think of games we usually think of
children’s games, or casual adult games such as bridge or charades. But many of these
games grew out of more serious social activity. Certainly throwing a ball or wrestling have
their counterpart activities in primitive warfare, and the engagement in such activities was,
in part, a source of training for such endeavors. Some activities like archery, hunting or
boxing have direct links to traits that were necessary for our survival in not too distant
times. At times, less-serious games have even displaced the practice of more serious games
related to warfare, and such a shift in the appeal of games may signal a shift in social or
cultural attitudes as well. The conﬂict between casual sports and the practice of the skills
of warfare was evident in 15th century Scotland. Golf originated in The Netherlands, but
reached its greatest appeal in Scotland:
It is uncertain at what date golf was introduced into Scotland, but in 1457 the
popularity of the game had already become so great as seriously to interfere with
the more important pursuit of archery. The Scotish king James IV announced that
it was forbidden to play golf.
Futeball and Golfe forbidden. Item, it is statut and ordainit that in na place of the
realme there be usit fute-ball, golfe, or uther sik unproﬁtabill sportis.136
In Scotland, the urge to play “golfe” was so strong that it displaced even the need to practice
the skills of warfare. Certainly, a practice that is motivated this strongly must be closely
tied to the fundamental desires and practices of the human community. There are authors
who have argued that, contrary to initial impressions, games are not only an important
component of society, but are a sine qua non of human society as we know it. One author,
Johan Huizinga, sees the “play” aspect of culture as so essential that he claims we should
136The Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th ed., vol. 12, p. 219. The Encyclopædia Britannica Company, NY, 1910.

90
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
not be named homo sapiens (“rational man”) but homo ludens (“playing man”). Huizinga’s
notion of “play” is broader than Wittgenstein’s concept of “games,” but his conception of
“play” includes “games.” One of the most important aspects of play for Huizinga is the
order that it brings to a situation:
Inside the play-ground an absolute and peculiar order reigns. Here we come across
another, very positive feature of play: it creates order, is order. Into an imperfect
world and into the confusion of life it brings a temporary, a limited perfection.137
The notion of “the confusion of life” that Huizinga describes has a certain resonance with
Wittgenstein when he writes of the “hurly burly of human actions”:
How could human behavior be described? Surely only by sketching the actions of a
variety of humans, as they are all mixed up together. What determines our judgment,
our concepts and reactions, is not what one man is doing now, an individual action,
but the whole hurly-burly of human actions, the background against which we see
any action. [Z §567]
If Wittgenstein, like Huizinga, sees life as a “confusion” or “hurly-burly” then it must
surely be one of the functions of Wittgenstein’s games, like Huizinga’s, to provide order.
Games are not just for amusement, but are, like Huizinga claims, part of who we are. For
Wittgenstein, language games are, similarly, part of “what [we] do.”138
Language and Categorization
Categorization is one of the most important aspects of language and, by inference, thought.
The central issue of categorization is how we can see individual things as being the same
in some regard even though there may be many ways in which they are different. Most
utterances contain explicit references to categories: tables, chairs, cars, people, trees,
feelings, colors, etc. In fact, it is difﬁcult to imagine an utterance that does not contain
a reference to at least one category. Yet this description of how pervasive categories are
doesn’t get at the central position of importance they hold for language. Ellis has argued
persuasively that categories are the very foundation of language, that without them we
simply could not have language at all.139
Categorization, not syntax, is the most basic aspect of language, and it is a process
that must be understood correctly if anything else (incuding syntax) is to be un-
derstood, and categorization, not communication, is the most important function of
language, one that is prior to all others. . . . Every language is a particular system
of categorization . . . 140

Like the nominalist, Ellis holds that the individual things that make up our everyday life
are, fundamentally, unique. Two Shetland Sheepdogs have much more that is different
about them than alike—they might weigh different amounts, stand at different heights,
have slightly different coloring, have barks that sound different, prefer to eat different kinds
of food, are different ages, have different temperaments, can run at different speeds, know
different kinds of tricks, be loyal to different people, etc.141 Similar lists of differences
can be drawn between two members of any category. The world is composed of unique
objects: this person, this tree, this situation, this Shetland Sheepdog, etc. Yet if we only
had unique objects in our world—objects that do not belong to categories—it is clear that
we would not be able to talk of them at all. All linguistic references would be as unique
as the objects that they referred to and would thereby be signiﬁcantly less informative.
141While it may seem that this kind of variety in perception is more of an intellectual exercise than a practical
reality, there actually are individuals who are so overcome with the variety of visual perception that they
ﬁnd it extremely difﬁcult to recognize and form categories of objects. Oliver Sacks reports that individuals
who become blind early in life but then have their sight restored as adults inevitably have such problems
with visual recognition. He writes of one such individual, a ﬁfty-year-old man who had his sight recently
restored:
Unfamiliar objects were much more difﬁcult [for him]. When I took a blood-pressure cuff
from my medical bag, he was completely ﬂummoxed and could make nothing of it, but he
recognized it immediately when I allowed him to touch it. Moving objects presented a special
problem, for their appearance changed constantly. Even his dog, he told me, looked so different
at different times that he wondered if it was the same dog. He was utterly lost when it came
to the rapid changes in others’ physiognomies. Such difﬁculties are almost universal among
the early blinded restored to sight. [Another patient] could not recognize individual faces,
or their expressions, a year after his eyes had been operated on, despite perfectly normal
elementary vision. What about pictures? . . . when we tried him ﬁrst on still pictures, pictures
in magazines, he had no success at all. He could not see people, could not see objects—did
not comprehend the idea of representation. [An Anthropologist on Mars, p. 129. Vintage
Books, NY.]
The existence of individuals with such deﬁcits indicates that our perceptions are not as unequivocal as we might
assume. It also argues against the realist’s view that the categories of perceived objects are in any way obvious,
and for the nominalist’s view that all things are unique until we, consciously or unconsciously, group them into
classes. This sort of visual confusion is difﬁcult for the non-visually impaired person to understand. Perhaps a
good analogy would be to imagine what it would be like to look at newspaper pictures through a magnifying
glass where the visual impression is of clusters of dots rather than images. One would ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to
identify even familiar images when looking at the pictures in such detail, because it would be difﬁcult to, in
gestalt terms, separate the ﬁgure from the ground. All visual impressions would be equally salient making it
difﬁcult to separate them into meaningful groups.
The poet T.S. Eliot describes this imperfect match between knowledge and perception more elegantly:
. . . There is, it seems to us,
At best, only a limited value
In the knowledge derived from experience.
The knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsiﬁes,
For the pattern is new in every moment
And every moment is a new and shocking
Valuation of all we have been.
[“The Four Quartets: East Coker: II”)

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Language would not add any information other than a different noise sounding for every
different situation or thing. In fact, language as we know it would not be possible.Since
all references would be to unique items, then new utterances would have to be made up
with every new object or event, and this would tell us nothing we could use in subsequent
instances. It is a reasonable inference that we could not even function in our day-to-day
activities if we saw every object, situation or event as unique—we would have no categories
for things like “food,” “danger,” “friend,” “water,” etc. As a consequence, we would not
only be unable to deal with these concepts in any kind of general way, we would not have
any knowledge about them to use in the future or pass on to others.142 Categorization, then,
is a means of simpliﬁcation. It provides a basic reference system in which things that are
fundamentally different, are treated as if they were alike. And what does it mean for things
to be “alike?” It means, at least in part, that they have the same role for us in what we do,
that their differences are of no consequence for their use. Any two Shetland Sheepdogs,
though each is unique, can be treated as being members of the same category. This is done
by setting the criteria for class membership to treat some aspects as important (such as
the color and markings on the fur and the size and shape of the ears) and others (such as
precise weight, sound of voice or birthplace) as irrelevant. It is also true that members of
one category can be members of other categories: two Shetland Sheepdogs could also be
in the category of “my dogs,” or one might be in the category “show dog” while the other
is not, or they both might be in the category of “guard dog,” etc.: [Ellis]
If situations themselves present a limitless variety, a language can only have a
ﬁnite set of categories. It follows that language functions as the instrument of
human knowledge and communication only because it simpliﬁes the complexity of
experience by reducing an inﬁnite variety to a ﬁnite set of categories—the categories
of a particular language . . . This simpliﬁcation is the central fact and process of
categorization, and thus the central fact of language and the knowledge it affords
us of our world. For communication to be possible, then, there must ﬁrst have been a
considerable degree of processing of experience—of analyzing it, abstracting from
it, focusing and shaping it. It is in this complex process that the essence of language
is to be found, not in communication per se. Indeed, communication is only of value
142Zipf discussed this issue in his statistical theory of language [Human Behavior and the Principle of Least
Effort. Hafner, NY, 1965 (facsimile of the 1949 edition)]. He said that language is the result of the struggle
between two competing economies: the Force of Uniﬁcation and the Force of Diversiﬁcation. The Force of
Uniﬁcation is the tendency for language to have just one word that would be used to express all linguistic
meaning. The Force of Diversiﬁcation is the tendency for language to have a unique word for every linguistic
meaning. Zipf also called these forces the Speaker’s Economy and the Hearer’s Economy, respectively: If a
language consisted of one word it would pose the least effort for the speaker, but would demand the most effort
from the hearer (i.e., he would have to ﬁgure out what the single word meant for each of its different uses).
This is the Speaker’s Economy. If, at the other extreme, a language had a different word for every meaning,
this would minimize the effort for the hearer while maximizing the effort for the speaker for he would have to
ﬁnd the precise, unique word for every meaningful expression. This is the Hearer’s Economy. Language cannot
function at either of these extremes so the forces compete to form a balance where some words can be used to
express a lot of meanings (general words like “people”) and some can be used to express only a few meanings
(speciﬁc words like “the current President of the U.S.”). Word usage in all natural languages fall somewhere
along a continuum stretching from very general words to very speciﬁc words. This “vocabulary balance,” as
Zipf called it, represents the minimum total effort for the speaker and hearer combined, and can be represented
by a predictable statistical pattern of word frequencies (for a more detailed discussion of Zipf’s Law see Colin
Cherry’s On Communication [Basic Books, 1972], or Blair’s Language and Representation in Information
Retrieval [Elsevier Science, New York, 1990]).

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
93
to us because this prior process creates something that can be communicated and is
worth communicating. Words do not label situations, they must relate one situation
to others in order to be able to talk about them at all. Only a prior typology of
situations and their aspects allows communication about any one of them to take
place, because what is communicated is not the facts of the situation merely in itself
(again, that is an impossible notion) but the place of that situation within the set of
categories of the language.143
Butlanguageisnotjustameansofsimpliﬁcation,itsimportanceisevenmorefundamental.
The categories that are explicit in language determine how we experience reality—in fact,
they determine what we consider reality to be. This relation between language and reality
was expressed most clearly by philosopher John Searle: “Our concept of reality is a matter
of our linguistic categories.” (see entire quotation at footnote 84).
Getting back to Ellis’ point about how language simpliﬁes the complexity of experience,
consider the following sentence:
Bill got into his car and drove to the store.
“Got into” tells us that Bill entered his car, but it does not tell us speciﬁcally how he did
it. If we had to draw a picture of exactly how he got in the car we could not do so (he may
have opened the door and stepped in, or crawled in through an open window, or entered
a number of other ways). “His car” refers to a particular car, but it tells us no more. It
could be a Ford, a Cadillac or a SAAB, it could be old or new, rusty or recently repainted,
it could have a cracked windshield and bald tires, it could have in-state or out-of-state
license plates, etc. “Drove” tells us that Bill used the car when he went to the store, but
it does not say which route he used to go to the store, nor does it say whether he drove
fast or slowly, or whether he stopped along the way. “The store” doesn’t tell us what kind
of store he went to, it doesn’t say how big it is, or what Bill was looking for, nor does
it even say whether it was open or not. All of this possible complexity—and it could be
even more complex than this—is left out of this sentence, even the name “Bill” is not
as precise as it could be, we could have several friends who have the name “Bill.” In
fact, if we were to talk always at a very detailed level of complexity it might be difﬁcult
for us to communicate at all. An important point is what criteria determine the level of
complexity required for the utterance. Different levels could be appropriate for different
circumstances. If a friend asked you casually where Bill was, the above sentence might
143Ellis, op.cit., p. 29. The idea that what we perceive are not facts, but sensory data that has already been
processed in some fundamental way, is difﬁcult to grasp. But this is not a new notion. Even Goethe could see
this:
The most important thing is to understand that everything that is factual is already theory.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
be ﬁne, but if a policeman is asking you about Bill’s trip to the store because he is ﬁlling
out an accident report for a mishap Bill got into, you might be required to give a lot more
detail than the above sentence does. The level of detail required for an utterance is based
on the particular use and circumstances in which it is made. So our use of categories not
only allows us to simplify our utterances and focus them on what is important, but they
also allow us a wide latitude in how detailed we want to be. Further, the use of certain
categories can be a signal for the level of complexity desired. We could say, for example:
Bill vaulted over the door of his classic, red 1955 Thunderbird convertible, landing
squarely behind the wheel. He jabbed the key into the ignition, started the engine
and roared off in a cloud of dust. Taking the Shore Highway, he turned East on
Noriega, stopped at the small Safeway store near 25th street and bought some
cigarettes.
Such an utterance would be bizarre in response to a simple query about where Bill is, but
would certainly be imaginable as a description in a short story. It might be asked how we
know what level of detail is required for our utterances. Certainly some of this level of
detail can be negotiated in a conversation:
1st person: “Bill got into his car and drove to the store.”
2nd person: “What did he go to the store for?”
1st person: “To get a pack of cigarettes.”
2nd person: “How long ago did he leave?”
1st person: “Just a few minutes ago.”
2nd person: “What kind of car was he driving?”
...
etc.
But what is surprising is that we often begin our conversation or answer a question with
just the right level of detail, so no negotiation is required. Although this does not always
happen, the fact that it does at all, given the unlimited number of things we could say, is
remarkable. What give us a sense of the correct level of detail required are the context
and circumstances—the Forms of Life—in which the statement is uttered.144 Paul Grice
has stated that our ordinary conversations are governed by what he calls “conversational
implicatures.” These implicatures are considered to be in force during our conversations
unless there is some clear indication that they are not. [This will be discussed in more
detail in the section “Conversational Implicatures,” infra] It is clear that categorization
144It is remarkable how quickly and intuitively we can assess the level of detail needed in conversation. Some
time ago, a study was done in New York City which observed the way that people gave directions to strangers
they met on the street. The study had individuals go up to random people on the street and ask directions to a
well-known place in the city, say, Times Square or Central Park. When the person who asked directions spoke
with a New York City accent, the person asked would give the directions, but make their description relatively
simple and often reference other New York city landmarks. But when the person asking directions spoke with a
heavy Southern accent, the person who was asked would immediately give the directions in much more detail
than they would to a New Yorker. Clearly, the responder was able to make the immediate inference that someone
with a New York accent would have some familiarity with the city and could be given very brief directions, but
someone with a Southern accent would likely be entirely new to the city requiring much more detailed directions.

is an essential aspect of language. But there are a number of competing theories about
how categorization takes place. In philosophy, the subject of categorization is traditionally
referred to as the relation between “universals and particulars.”
Universals and Particulars: An Old Debate
One of the major problems in philosophy has been understanding how we can have general,
unchangingideasorconceptsofthingswhenallwecanobservearethingsthataresubjectto
constant change—or, putting it more traditionally, how can we arrive at a universal concept
when we can observe only unique particulars? Traditionally, this debate has been organized
around three points of view: realism, conceptualism and nominalism. Realism’s ﬁrst major
proponent was Plato (427–347 B.C.). For Plato, true knowledge must be permanent and
unchanging. But the things we observe in our day-to-day experience are always subject
to change and decay. Therefore, according to Plato, our everyday experience, no matter
how careful, cannot be the source of true knowledge. But there are some things that are
permanent and unchanging, namely our ideas of categories. That is, although actual tables
and chairs are inﬁnitely variable in construction and are subject to constant change—
nicks, scratches, and other wear and tear—our conception of a “table” or “chair” remains
constant. As Socrates explains to Glaucon:
Let us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the world—plenty
of them, are there not?
Yes.
But there are only two ideas or forms of them—one the idea of a bed, the other of
a table.
True.
And the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use, in
accordancewiththeidea—thatisourwayofspeakinginthisandsimilarinstances—
but no artiﬁcer makes the ideas themselves: how could he?
Impossible.145
The general, unchanging ideas of such entities had to come from some place. Since Plato
believed that they couldn’t come from our observations of everyday things, he proposed
that they actually existed independently in a “realm of forms (or ideas).” This realm of
forms exists separately from our everyday world. Our general ideas of things like “tables”
and “beds” are recollections that we have of these ideas or forms that we have seen
before we were born (the realm of forms was where people existed before birth). With
this foundation, it was easy to attribute all general prototypical ideas to the realm of
145Plato. “The Republic,” Book X, pp. 852–853. The Dialogues of Plato, vol. 1, Random House, NY, 1920.
Translated by B. Jowett. Plato’s doctrine of forms did not just attempt to resolve the problem of categories but
also tried to resolve the problems of contradiction and perfection. Plato felt that everyday objects were inherently
contradictory because any one could be, for example, beautiful from one point of view and ugly from another.
Further, geometric entities, such as circles and lines, lacked a perfection in their everyday appearances that our
ideas of them did not.

96
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
forms—ideas of not just material objects but also attributes like “beautiful” and “good”
and relations such as “greater than” or “equal to.”
Aristotle (394–322 B.C.) found some problems with Plato’s theory of “universals.” Speciﬁ-
cally, Plato could not explain satisfactorily how the forms of his ideal realm could be related
to the particulars or individuals of everyday life. This is the fundamental problem with all
dualistic systems—how do you explain the inﬂuence of one component on the other given
that they are, by deﬁnition, separate? In order to be related to particular instances there
must be some feature in common between the form and the instance. But if that were true,
then this feature in common must have its own form. This objection was rendered more
ﬁguratively as the “third man” argument, Aristotle’s most famous objection to Plato: The
“ﬁrst man” is the individual or particular man, and this is related to the “second man”
which is the type, or ideal man. But for the “ﬁrst man” and the “second man” to be related,
as they must, we need a “third man” which is the general form for this relationship. It is
not possible for the form of the relationship to be part of the ﬁrst man or second man, so
it must be separate from both of them. But if this is the case, then we will need a “fourth
man” to be the form of the relationship between the ﬁrst man and the third man. This
“fourth man” then necessitates a “ﬁfth man,” and the “ﬁfth man” requires a “sixth man,”
and so on leading to an inﬁnite regress. But this inﬁnite regress does not mean that we
cannot get to the end, but that there is, more importantly, no “end” to get to. Wittgenstein
made this important observation about inﬁnite regresses:
The reasoning that leads to an inﬁnite regress is to be given up not ‘because in this
way we can never reach the goal’, but because here there is no goal; so it makes no
sense to say “we can never reach it.” [Z §693]
For Aristotle, Plato’s realm of forms introduced a separate “reality” that caused more
problems than it solved. Bertrand Russell comments:
. . . a universal cannot exist by itself, but only in particular things.
Suppose I say “there is such a thing as the game of football,” most people would
regard the remark as a truism. But if I were to infer that football could exist without
football-players, I should be rightly held to be talking nonsense. Similarly, it would
be held there is such a thing as parenthood, but only because there are parents; there
is such a thing as sweetness, but only because there are sweet things; and there is
redness, but only because there are red things.146
Aristotle then proposed that instead of universals being a separate reality, they were better
seen as common elements in real objects of the same category—form could not be sep-
arate from existing individuals. The universal “table” consists of whatever is in common
with all tables. Plato’s theory came to be known as universalia ante rem (universals be-
fore (prior to) things) while Aristotle’s was known as universalia in rebus (universals in
things).147
146B. Russell. A History of Western Philosophy, p. 163. Simon and Schuster, NY, 1945. Russell does not hold
Aristotle’s view, but continues on and criticizes it, though his criticisms are different than the ones I present here.
147Aristotle’s criticism of Plato did not stop here. He had a total of at least 7 objections to Plato’s notion of
universals:

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
97
Platonic and Aristotelian realism both enjoyed long periods of support, with medieval
philosophers Augustine favoring Plato’s version of realism and Aquinas supporting Aris-
totle’s view. Variations of Aristotle’s realism have found even more recent support.148
But in spite of the long support these theories of knowledge have enjoyed, there are some
problems with strict versions of realism. Most prominently there is the observation that, as
we pointed out above in our discussion of Ellis, there are often more aspects of members
of the same category that are different than are the same. Further, individual members
of one category can be seen to be members of other categories, too, and some of this
variation is not due just to the entity in question, but may be contingent on context and
circumstances—for example, a can of soup on the shelf of a supermarket is merely a can
of soup; but that same can of soup on display in the Chicago Art Institute is a legitimate
art object (and worth substantially more $). In short, the number of ways that particular
entities can be the same, or can be different, is uncountable, especially when you include
context and circumstances. Clearly, then, empirical similarities or differences between
things are not decisive in establishing their membership, or non-membership, in different
categories. This was one of nominalism’s major criticisms of realism.
Nominalism’s ﬁrst major proponent was William of Ockham (1280–1347).149 Ockham was
a 14th century ﬁgure who, in addition to his scholarly work, was pronounced a heretic,
excommunicated and eventually became one of the many victims of the Black Plague. The
Plague wiped out much of the 14th century intelligentsia of Northern Europe, plunging
In criticizing the Platonic theory of ideas, [Aristotle] offers seven arguments, which group themselves in such
a way that there are virtually only two main criticisms of Plato. The ﬁrst criticism is that the ideas, although
they are intended to explain the nature of things, are not adequate to do so. This thesis is developed in four
special arguments: (1) the ideas are mere abstractions and as such cannot account for the existence of concrete
things; (2) they are static and eternal, and are thus unable to explain the motion and change of concrete things;
(3) ideas are posterior rather than prior to particular things, and cannot therefore be used to explain them; in
short, ideas are copies of things, not their causes; (4) the ideas are unnecessary reduplications of things and
not explanations of them. The second broad criticism of the ideal theory is that the relation between things and
ideas is inexplicable. This criticism is expanded into the following three arguments: (1) nothing is explained by
saying that things are the “copies of” or “participate in” ideas; to say that the individual man participates in the
ideal man adds nothing to our understanding of the individual; (2) the alleged relation between the ideas and the
corresponding things leads to an inﬁnite regress—the “third man” argument as discussed above. (3) the theory
of ideas completely separates the essence of form of a thing from the thing itself, but such a separation is at
variance with the unity of the particular as observed by the mind. [F. Thilly. A History of Philosophy, p. 104.
Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, NY, 1965. Revised by L. Wood.]
148Most notably, Frege, Russell, and Moore, all contemporary inﬂuences on Wittgenstein’s early work. Hacker
points out the debt Wittgenstein’s early philosophy had to the early Platonic/metaphysical realism of these
individuals:
[Wittgenstein] accepted a version of metaphysical realism. The simple objects of the Trac-
tatus [TLP] are heir to the realist ontologies of Frege, Moore and Russell. They resemble
Fregean concepts in being “unsaturated,” Fregean and Moorean concepts and terms in being
unanalysable and indecomposable, and all three in being conceived to be constituents of real-
ity. [Wittgenstein’s Place in Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy, Blackwell, Oxford,
1996.]
This was one of the tenets of his early philosophy that Wittgenstein was later to reject.
149Earlier ﬁgures who held nominalist-like views, but who were not as prominent as William of Ockham, were
Roscelin de Compi`egne and Peter Abelard. (“Ockham” is sometimes spelled “Occam.”)

98
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
it into a century of intellectual darkness. Ockham remains a last glimmer of rationality
before a long period in which intellectual issues were not prominent. Ockham could
see the principal ﬂaw with realism: that positing the separate existence of “universals,”
as Plato, Aristotle and their followers insisted on, does not explain how we see only
individual, unique things, yet can somehow group them by general characteristics. Further,
making universals separate from particulars introduces the principal attendant problem
with any dualism: viz. how do the separate entities interact? Ockham’s legacy to philosophy,
the notion of “Ockham’s razor,” was a defense of nominalism, because it “shaved off”
the unnecessary universals of realism.150 For Ockham, all knowledge begins with the
particulars or individual entities of our experience. We abstract from the objects of our
experience the characteristics common to them, and form universal concepts. But these
universals only exist in our mind and are only expressed as words or some other signs. They
do not exist outside our minds, as Plato believed, nor do they exist in things, as Aristotle
thought. To make separate entities of universals is to create something that doesn’t help
to explain how we acquire general concepts.151
Nominalism found an early articulation in the works of Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679):
The manner how speech serves to the remembrance of the consequence of causes
and effects consists in the imposing of names and the connection of them.
Of names, some are proper and singular to one only thing, as Peter, John, this
man, this tree; and some are common to many things, man , horse, tree, every of
which, though but one name, is nevertheless the name of diverse particular things,
in respect of all which together it is called a universal, there being nothing in the
world universal but names, for the things named are every one of them individual
and singular.
Oneuniversalnameisimposedonmanythingsfortheirsimilitudeinsomequalityor
other accident; and whereas a proper name brings to mind one thing only, universals
recall any one of those many.152
150Entia non multiplicanda praeter necessitatem (“Entities or principles should not be unnecessarily multiplied”).
F. Thilly. A History of Philosophy, p. 248. Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, NY, 1965. Revised by L. Wood. Russell
(op.cit.) claims that Ockham never wrote this, nor is there any mention of a “razor” in Ockham’s work. Russell
attributes the following similar statement to him: “It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer.” [p.
472]. Russell, himself, came closest to the view of realism: “I think a logical argument could be produced to
show that universals are part of the structure of the world” [The Analysis of Mind. London, 1921]. Some years
later he wrote: “I conclude, therefore, though with hesitation, that there are universals, and not merely general
words.” [An Inquiry Into Meaning and Truth. London, 1940.]
151While this discussion deals with traditional versions of realism and nominalism, this does not mean that
there are not tenable later formulations. For example, see Goodman and Quine’s “Steps Towards a Constructive
Nominalism,” Journal of Symbolic Logic, vol. 12, pp. 105–122, 1947. Goodman answers some of the major
objections to his version of nominalism in his “A World of Individuals.” Originally published in 1956, reprinted
in The Problem of Universals, pp. 292–305. Basic Books, NY, 1971. Edited by C. Landesman. Also, of interest
is Max Black’s critique of recent versions of nominalism in the ﬁeld of linguistics: “A crude nominalism . . . is
often to be found, nowadays, expressed by overenthusiastic devotees of the popular movement known as General
Semantics” [The Labyrinth of Language, p. 149. Mentor Books, NY, 1961]. Black cites S.I. Hayakawa’s
Language, Meaning and Maturity [Harper and Row, NY, 1954] as an introduction to General Semantics.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
99
Hobbes admits that there must be something about things in the same category that is
similar for them to be referred to by universals. This avoids the problems of the more
rigid realisms of Plato and Aristotle by not specifying exactly how entities in the same
category are similar. But Hobbes never ventures further in his description of how things
in the same category are similar, leaving his reader to wonder what precisely constitutes
this “similitude.” Later critics claimed that Hobbes had not, in fact, excluded universals—
things that are similar, they pointed out, must be similar in some general respect. This
made similarity contingent on implicit universals.
A somewhat different theory of universals was proposed by John Locke (1632–1704).153
This view is often referred to as “conceptualism,” and is close enough to nominalism that
some writers, such as Russell and Windelband, insist that Locke was really a nominal-
ist.154 While the nominalist claims that the only general things we have are words, Locke
pushed the analysis of universals back another step by claiming that a word is general or
meaningful only insofar as there is a general concept associated with it. This view adds
a complication to the nominalist theory by including another element, the “general idea,”
with it. While nominalism rejects the dualism of realism, Locke’s conceptualism brings
another form of dualism back. It is difﬁcult to understand why Locke made his theory of
universals more complicated than traditional nominalism, in effect, reversing the parsi-
mony of Ockham’s “razor.” But a good guess might be that Locke saw that general ideas
can change over time, and that it is difﬁcult to reconcile this change with the nominalist
view. For example, one could form a general idea of horses having seen a number of dark
Arabian thoroughbreds. The word for this particular category of animals, of course, is
“horse.” But suppose that at a later time, the same individual sees other kinds of horses
too: Clydesdales, Pintos, Mustangs, Piebalds, Lipizzaner stallions, etc. We would still
call these examples “horses,” but something has changed. We have a different “idea” of
“horse” now than we had before. Yet, for the nominalist, since words are “names” and the
word “horse” remains the same in both situations, it is difﬁcult to see how the observer’s
view of horses has changed. For Locke, what has changed is not the word “horse” but
the general idea that it stands for. Locke’s formulation, then, can help us to understand
general ideas when they change—something that strict nominalism has a harder time
with.155
Locke’s theory of universals works like this:
153Locke’s theory was criticized by two subsequent Empiricists, Berkeley (1685–1753) and Hume (1711–1776).
154See Russell, op.cit., p. 610: “Chapter III [of Locke’s Essay On Human Understanding] . . . takes up an
extreme nominalist position on the subject of universals.” And W. Windelband [A History of Philosophy, v. II.
Harper Torchbooks, Harper and Row, NY, 1958 (original copyright, 1901).]: “Like the greater part of English
philosophers, Locke was an adherent of Nominalsim, which professed to see in general concepts nothing but
internal, intellectual structures.” [p. 451].
155Wittgenstein’s solution to this problem, of course, would be to say that what changes is neither the word
“horse” nor some idea associated with it. What changes are the uses to which the word “horse” can be put and
the situations in which it is appropriate. One can use “horse” to refer to these other kinds of horses within a wider
range of contexts than it could be used before. In other words, the role that the word “horse” plays in our life
changes as we see more kinds of horses. Certainly we can still describe a horse as having certain characteristics,
or we can talk about our “idea” or image of a horse, but these exercises are merely two of the language games
that can be used when we are talking about horses, and are not the basis for understanding what a “horse” is.
Only the use of the word can teach us that.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The mind makes the particular ideas, received from particular objects, to be-
come general; which is done by considering them as they are in the mind such
appearances—separate from all other existences, and the circumstances of real ex-
istence. . . . This is called abstraction, whereby ideas taken from particular things
become general representatives of all of the same kind . . . Thus, the same colour
being observed today in chalk or snow, which the mind yesterday received from
milk, it considers that appearance alone, makes it a representative of all of that
kind; and having given it the name “whiteness,” it by that sound signiﬁes the same
quality wheresoever to be imagined or met with; and thus universals, whether ideas
or terms are made.
The traditional problem with universals or general ideas is that they are clearly different
from our ideas of individual things. This apparent dichotomy between universals and
particulars has proved the undoing of many theories of categorization (recall Aristotle’s
“third man” argument against Plato’s realism). Locke attempted to resolve this issue by
claiming that we did not have separate universal and particular ideas, but only particular
ideas. The universal idea is merely a particular idea regarded in a different way. Since
universals were particular ideas taken in a different way, it means that we have the ability
to turn any particular ideas we might have into universal ideas. We can choose to regard
a particular idea in a general way. This means that we are not bound to a particular
interpretation of universals, nor are we prevented from changing our mind about the
membership of categories, or even the existence of the categories themselves. Woozley
summarizes Locke’s position:
We do not ﬁnd objects and their features divided by nature of God into real and
objectively delimited classes; we observe objects and their features, but the dis-
tinction between one class and another is something we ourselves make by criteria
of convenience and utility. Similarities and differences are there for us to observe;
whether the similarities are sufﬁciently close so that we can place the objects in the
same or in different classes is for us to decide . . .
A consequence of this kind of conceptualism will be that concepts are not per-
manently ﬁxed, as on a simple realist theory they would be; a concept is liable to
development and change, as fresh experience or changes of view show the need or
utility of it.156
Locke’s most signiﬁcant contribution to the debate over universals and particulars was to
recognize that any theory must be able to account for possible changes in the categories
themselves. In this regard he sounds very modern. The problem with Locke’s concep-
tualism is that it falls prey to the difﬁculties of any mentalistic theory of language—
where the “meaning” of a word is taken to be the idea that it stands for, or, as Locke put
it: .“ . . . words in their primary or immediate signiﬁcation stand for nothing but the ideas
in the mind of him that uses them . . . ”157 The main problem with mentalistic theories of
meaning is that if the meaning of a word is a concept, and this concept is, by deﬁnition,

private, then how can one be sure that he has the “correct” concept when he learns the
meaning of a word? In truth, we cannot observe what is in others’ minds, so any appeal of
the question of meaning to concepts or other mental states cannot be veriﬁed.158 In short,
Locke made the important observation that categories are subject to change, and category
membership is subject to a decision by the observer based on the “criteria of convenience
and utility.”
Wittgenstein’s Approach: The Rejection of Strict Nominalism and Realism159
The nominalist claims that all perceivable entities are unique, and that entities that we put in
the same categories, such as Shetland Sheepdogs, have many more things that are different
about them than alike. Consequently, the similarity of entities in the same category cannot
be based on just observable characteristics. The strict nominalist would claim that the only
thing that Wittgenstein’s games have in common is that they are called games.
The realist’s view of categorization claims that universals have a separate existence outside
of the mind, that is, they are not dependent on any perception or mental abstraction for their
existence. This view has taken a number of forms including the existence of universals
separate from particular entities (Plato) and the existence of universals as common features
in particular entities (Aristotle). The realist would say that what Wittgenstein’s games have
in common is that they possess some feature, or features, in common in addition to the fact
that they are games. Having discussed some of the history of the debate over universals and
particulars, and having collected some of Wittgenstein’s views on the issue, it is important
now to reconcile these points of view. First, it would be important to discuss any actual
references that Wittgenstein makes to the nominalist:realist debate. Unfortunately, he
makes only one direct reference to these points of view.160 In Philosophical Investigations
he remarks:
We are not analysing a phenomenon (e.g., thought) but a concept (e.g., that of
thinking), and therefore the use of a word. So it may look as if what we were
doing were Nominalism. Nominalists make the mistake of interpreting all words
as names, and so of not really describing their use, but only, so to speak, giving a
paper draft on such a description.161 [PI §383]
158As Max Black put it: “It is part of the ‘mentalistic’ conception [of meaning] to assume that the ‘idea’ is
something ‘private’ to its possessor, something of which only he can be directly aware. But if so, how am I to
convey my ‘idea’ to you—or to be sure that the idea you have corresponds sufﬁciently closely to my own?,” The
Labyrinth of Language, p. 194. Frederick A. Praeger, NY, 1968. Conceptualism (or mentalism) did not die
with Locke, but exists in various forms today. Most prominently, the ﬁeld of semiotics is strongly conceptualistic
(see, especially, Umberto Eco’s A Theory of Semiotics, Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana, 1976).
This conceptualistic, or mentalistic, view is criticized in detail in Blair’s Language and Representation in
Information Retrieval [Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, 1990].
159The discussion in this section is taken largely from R. Bambrough’s “Universals and Family Resemblances,”
The Problem of Universals, pp. 266–279. Humanities Press, NJ, 1992. Edited by A.B. Schoedinger [reprinted
from the “Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society,” vol. 61, 1960–1961].
160Wittgenstein does mention “realism” in some of his later work [see, §§338–339 in his RPPII], but he is not
referring to the view of realism we have been discussing.
161This is one of the clear breaks which Wittgenstein had with his past philosophy. In the Tractatus he claimed
that the basic purpose of words is to name objects. That is, words stand for objects in reality, and these objects
are the meaning of the words.

102
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Wittgenstein’s rejection of this aspect of nominalism is brief, but clear. Since he has
already established that meaning in language is “explained”162 by how words are used, any
philosophy that does not recognize the relationship between meaning and use is going to
be rejected by Wittgenstein. On Wittgenstein’s view, the nominalists make three mistakes:
(1) By saying that all words are names, they are saying that language only works in one
way. In his criticism of the Augustine theory of language (see section “Wittgenstein at
Work: Philosophical Investigations,” supra), Wittgenstein speciﬁcally rejected the notion
that language could work in only one way, regardless of what that way might be. (2) The
claim that words are merely names is not supportable for much language use. (see section
“Five Red Apples,” supra). (3) Nominalists don’t consider the importance that context,
circumstances and activities play in the meaning of language—in effect, a word that is a
name in one context might be something entirely different in another (e.g., if I say “Bring
the chair over here” I am using the word “chair” as the name for a particular object. But
if I say that “Bill is the chair of the Executive Committee” I do not mean that Bill is an
object that people can sit on. I am using the word “chair” in a metaphorical or idiomatic
sense.). These three objections are not rejections of all of nominalism’s claims, though;
there are some aspects of nominalism that Wittgenstein agrees with, at least implicitly, as
we shall see.
The most extensive discussion that Wittgenstein has about universals—what he calls
“generality”— is to be found in The Blue and Brown Books. Although this is an earlier
work than Philosophical Investigations it contains the seeds of some of the discussions
that he devoted the Philosophical Investigations to.163 Wittgenstein begins the discussion
by saying that what we need to look at if we are examining language, is speciﬁc examples
of how particular words, phrases or sentences are used. But in saying that this is what we
should do, Wittgenstein implies that this is precisely what we don’t do. In fact, we have
an inherent distrust of this kind of analysis. This prejudice has lead us away from fruitful
investigations and towards a kind of analysis that is not likely to show us what is going on.
If we say thinking is essentially operating with signs, the ﬁrst question you might
ask is: “What are signs?”—Instead of giving any kind of general answer to this
question, I shall propose to you to look closely at particular cases which we should
call “operating with signs.”
...
Now what makes it difﬁcult for us to take this line of investigation is our craving
for generality.
This craving for generality is the result of a number of tendencies connected with
particular philosophical confusions.
162The reader is reminded that “explain” is my translation of the German word “erkl¨aren.” This word is usually
rendered as “deﬁne” in the Anscombe translation of Philosophical Investigations (see quotation 92 and the
following text).
163The generally accepted subtitle for BB is Preliminary Studies for the “Philosophical Investigations.” It
comprises two sets of class notes that Wittgenstein dictated for his students’ use in 1934–1936. While the “Blue
Book” was never intended for anything more than class notes, Wittgenstein had hoped that the “Brown Book”
might be a draft of a longer written work, but this never came to pass [R. Rhees. The preface to BB].

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
103
[One tendency is] to look for something in common to all the entities which we
commonly subsume under a general term . . . It is comparable to the idea that prop-
erties are ingredients of the things which have the properties; e.g. that beauty is
an ingredient of all beautiful things as alcohol is of beer and wine, and that we
therefore could have a pure beauty, unadulterated by anything that is beautiful.164
[BB pp. 16–17]
Wittgenstein is objecting to a view of universals that has its roots in Aristotle’s realism.
His most articulate rejection of this is his attempt to show that if we were to look at what
we all agree are “games” there is no single characteristic that they all have. Further, we
can see that some games, for example, chess and hopscotch, have so little in common
that it is remarkable that we classify both as “games,” at all. The basis for this judgment,
according to Wittgenstein, is to resist the attempt to ﬁnd a general deﬁnition of “games”
and to look at as many different kinds of games as possible. If we do this, we will see that
no such general deﬁnition of games is at all possible:
Here we come up against the great question that lies behind all these consider-
ations.—For someone might object against me: “You take the easy way out! You
talk about all sorts of language-games, but have nowhere said what the essence of
a language-game, and hence of language, is: what is common to all these activities,
and what makes them into language or parts of language. So you let yourself off
the very part of the investigation that once gave you yourself most headache, the
part about the general form of propositions and of language.”
And this is true.—Instead of producing something common to all that we call
language, I am saying that these phenomena have no one thing in common which
makes us use the same word for all,—but that they are related to one another in
many different ways. And it is because of this relationship, or these relationships,
that we call them all “language.” I will try to explain this.
Consider for example the proceedings that we call “games.” I mean board-games,
card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them
all?—Don’t say: “There must be something common or they would not be called
‘games’ ”—but look and see whether there is anything common to all. For if you
look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities,
relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don’t think, but look!—
Look for example at board-games, with their multifarious relationships. Now pass
to card-games; here you ﬁnd many correspondences with the ﬁrst group, but many
common features drop out, and others appear. When we pass next to ball games,
much that is common is retained, but much is lost.—Are they all ‘amusing’? Com-
pare chess with noughts and crosses. Or is there always winning and losing, or
competition between players? Think of patience [a form of solitaire]. In ball games
there is winning and losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and catches
it again, this feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played by skill and luck; and
at the difference between skill in chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games like
ring-a-ring-a-roses; here is the element of amusement, but how many other char-
acteristic features have disappeared! And we can go through the many, many other
164Ryle called such references to “beauty” “quasi-Platonic statements” since they implied a kind of Platonic
realism [vid. footnote 102].

104
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
groups of games in the same way; can see how similarities crop up and disappear.
[PI §§65–66]
This tendency of ours to look for essential deﬁnitions of words rather than looking at lots
of cases of their use, is not only misleading when we consider games, it is a prejudice that
underlies much philosophical analysis:
The idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to
ﬁnd the common element in all its applications has shackled philosophical inves-
tigation; for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss
as irrelevant the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him to understand
the usage of the general term. When Socrates asks the question, “what is knowl-
edge?” he does not even regard it as a preliminary answer to enumerate cases of
knowledge.165 [BB pp. 19–20]
Wittgenstein only rarely made such sweeping statements, so its impact is doubly impor-
tant. It underscores the breadth and seriousness with which he considered this problem.
Wittgenstein continues with a second reason for this “craving for generality”:
. . . There is a tendency rooted in our usual forms of expression, to think that the man
who has learnt to understand a general term, say, the term “leaf,” has thereby come
to possess a kind of general picture of a leaf, as opposed to pictures of particular
leaves . . . This again is connected with the idea that the meaning of a word is an
image, or a thing correlated to the word. (This roughly means, we are looking at
words as though they all were proper names, and we then confuse the bearer of a
name with the meaning of the name.) [BB pp. 17–18]
In this view, a universal is like a “general picture.” It is most like Locke’s theory of ideas,
namely, that general ideas are formed by considering particular ideas in a general way.
One might arrive at this general picture by looking at lots of individual leaves until we
somehow form a general picture of what the leaves have in common. This is similar to an
earlyviewthatWittgensteinheld:thepicturetheoryofmeaning.166 Thisviewofmeaningis
ﬂawed in one major way, speciﬁcally, a picture cannot be the “meaning” of a word because
165BB pp. 19–20. Wittgenstein is referring to Plato’s dialogue “Theaetetus,” 146D–147C.
166Malcolm has stated that Wittgenstein’s early philosophy, as presented in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,
has some striking resemblances to Locke’s:
If I am giving a correct interpretation of the Tractatus, it reveals that the conceptions of
the Tractatus belong to a traditional framework of philosophical ideas about the relation of
thinking to language. John Locke, for example, declared that a man’s thoughts “are all within
his own breast, invisible and hidden from others, nor can of themselves be made to appear.”
In order for there to be a communication of thoughts “it was necessary that man should ﬁnd
out some external sensible signs, whereof those invisible ideas, which his thoughts are made
up, might be made known to others.” This is substantially the same as Wittgestein’s idea that
thoughts, composed of “psychical constituents,” have an existence apart from physical signs,
but can be given an expression in physical signs, by which the thoughts are made perceptible
to the senses. The notion is that thoughts are independent of spoken or written language. [N.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
105
a picture or image can have more than one interpretation. We have already presented
Wittgenstein’s rejection of the picture-theory of meaning so we will not reiterate it here
(see the section “Wittgenstein at Work: Philosophical Investigations,” supra, especially
quotation PI §22).
Wittgenstein continues his attack on “generality”:
. . . Again, the idea we have of what happens when we get hold of the general idea
“leaf,” “plant,” etc. etc., is connected with the confusion between a mental state,
meaning a state of a hypothetical mental mechanism, and a mental state meaning
a state of consciousness (toothache, etc.)
. . . Our craving for generality has another main source: our preoccupation with
the method of science. I mean the method of reducing the explanation of natural
phenomena to the smallest possible of primitive natural laws; and, in mathematics,
of unifying the treatment of different topics by using a generalization . . . This
tendency is the real source of metaphysics, and lead the philosopher into complete
darkness. I want to say here that it can never be our job to reduce anything to
anything, or to explain anything. Philosophy really is “purely descriptive.” (Think
of such questions as “Are there sense data?” and ask: What method is there of
determining this? Introspection?)
Instead of “craving for generality” I could also have said “the contemptuous attitude
toward the particular case.” [BB p. 18]
Wittgenstein’s Categories: Family Resemblances
In his discussion of games, Wittgenstein introduces another important concept: “family
resemblances.”
. . . the result of this examination [to ﬁnd what games have in common] is: we see
a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes
overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail.
I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than “family
resemblances”; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build,
features, color of eyes, gait, temperment, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the
same way.—And I shall say: “games” form a family. [PI §§66–67]
The need to classify or categorize things is essential for language, but ﬁnding a basis for
categorization that accommodates the subtleties of Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language
is difﬁcult. The dominant view of categorization, especially in the biological sciences,
during Wittgenstein’s time was fundamentally Aristotelian—that items in the same cate-
gories had speciﬁable properties in common. Dogs were dogs because they had properties
that all dogs had, and these properties, for the most part, were different than those of other
mammals. This method of analysis has a long tradition, as we have shown. Nevertheless,
there must be good modern reasons to hold this view. Baker and Hacker, in their writ-
ings on Wittgenstein, show that this model of analysis gains its currency by mimicking
successful methods of scientiﬁc analysis, here, chemical analysis:

106
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
(i)
Chemical analysis comes to an end in atoms or elements that cannot be further
decomposed (at least chemically). It is natural to think that the analysis of con-
cepts must similarly terminate in simple ideas, in what is unanalysable and hence
indeﬁnable, that is, the atoms or elements of thought and language . . .
(ii)
Given a familiar object, we know that it must be compounded out of the familiar
chemical elements; or at least this is an accepted working assumption. The parallel
idea is familiar, for example, in British empiricism. We are thought typically to
have the full range of simple ideas, and we know in advance of carrying out an
analysis of any given idea that it must be compounded somehow out of these basic
building blocks. Any failure to analyze our idea into its simple constituents must
be ascribed to limitations of our abilities.
(iii)
Chemical analysis yields the elements out of which any substance or stuff (e.g.,
water) is compounded, but equally those out of which any particular object (e.g., a
metal bar) is compounded. It seems to be simultaneously an analysis of individual
thingsandofkindsofstuff(conﬂatedwithkindsofthings).Theanalysisofconcepts
is often conceived to be parallel. It reveals both the constituents of concepts or ideas
and the ingredients of particulars or individuals; the property of rigidity is both
a logical part of the concept of a beam and the ingredient of any object that is a
beam.167
In his earlier work, The Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, Wittgenstein held that such a
reductive method was the proper means of philosophical analysis. But by the time that he
was writing Philosophical Investigations, he was skeptical of this method. He begins his
criticism by attacking the reduction itself:
When I say: “My broom is in the corner,”—is this really a statement about the
broomstick and the brush? Well, it could at any rate be replaced by a statement
giving the position of the stick and the position of the brush. And this statement
is surely a further analyzed form of the ﬁrst one.—But why do I call it “further
analyzed?”—Well, if the broom is there, that surely means that the stick and brush
must be there, and in a particular relation to one another; and this was as it were
hidden in the sense of the ﬁrst sentence, and is expressed in the analyzed sentence.
Then does someone who says that the broom is in the corner really mean: the
broomstick is there, and so is the brush?—If we were to ask anyone if he meant
this he would probably say that he had not thought specially of the broomstick or
speciallyofthebrushatall.Andthatwouldbetherightanswer,forhemeanttospeak
neither of the stick nor of the brush in particular. Suppose that, instead of saying
“Bring me the broom,” you said “Bring me the broomstick and the brush which is
ﬁtted on to it.!”—Isn’t the answer: “Do you want the broom? Why do you ask so
oddly?”—is he going to understand the further analyzed sentence better?” [PI §60]
Wittgenstein’s ﬁrst argument is to appeal to our own experience—the activities in which
we might use a broom. Here, no further breakdown of a “broom” can be made if we still
want to keep our day-to-day understanding of what a “broom” is. The reason that we don’t

tions, v. I, p. 186. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1980.

107
break a broom down into the components “broomstick” and “the brush which is ﬁtted on to
it” is that it just doesn’t make sense to do this; that is, we can’t use the distinction in every
day life, and even if we were to use it, it would cause more confusion than it resolved. We
can see this if you look at how a broom is used (and, of course, this parallels the use of
the word “broom.” It would be used in the same circumstances.). We talk about “brooms”
when we are talking about sweeping or cleaning. Within this context it makes no sense
to speak of a “broomstick and the brush which is ﬁtted on to it.” If you said, “Bring me
the broom” and I replied, “Do you want the broomstick with the brush ﬁtted onto it?” you
would not think of my question as being wrong, but as being odd, or inappropriate. If a
statement can be construed as correct or incorrect, then we can assume that it is relevant
to the discussion at hand. The problem here in the broom analogy is that my reference to
the “broomstick with the brush ﬁtted onto it” is neither correct nor incorrect, it is simply
inappropriate, or, more to the point, without a clear use. Our desire to break down the
broom into its constituent parts has caused us to take the broom out of context:
Whenphilosophersuseaword—“knowledge,”“being,”“object,”“I,”“proposition,”
“name”—and try to grasp the essence of the thing, one must always ask oneself: is
the word ever actually used in this way in the language-game which is its original
home?—
What we do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.
[PI §116]
If we are talking about the language game in which we can refer to “brooms,” there is no
grammatical place for speaking about a “broomstick and the brush which is ﬁtted on to
it.” Following Wittgenstein’s methods, we might redirect our analysis by asking how we
might use the words “broomstick and the brush which is ﬁtted on to it.” Clearly, we cannot
use it in an ordinary context, such as we have described above. Could we use this phrase at
all? Probably. We can imagine someone working in a broom-making factory saying, “Did
you ﬁt the right brush on the stick?” This might make sense in this context, but there is
no ordinary usage of the word “broom” that can be replaced with the “broomstick and the
brush which is ﬁtted on to it,” hence, the word “broom” cannot be “further analyzed” as
in Wittgenstein’s example, above.
Philosophy has frequently worked under the assumption that ordinary language is not
robust enough to discuss the deep conceptual problems that are the object of philosophical
analysis. What is needed, it is claimed, is to make language more rigorous by deﬁning the
words used in the analysis more carefully. Wittgenstein disagrees. In fact, he makes the
point that our reluctance to use ordinary language in philosophical analysis is the source
of many of our philosophical puzzles.
When I talk about language (words, sentences, etc.) I must speak the language of
every day. Is this language somehow too coarse and material for what we want to
say? Then how is another one to be constructed?—And how strange that we should
be able to do anything at all with the one we have!168 [PI §120]
168In Wittgenstein’s time, the major proponents of the view that ordinary language was not sufﬁciently precise
for philosophical analysis were Russell and Whitehead (among other deﬁciencies ordinary language lacked

108
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Wittgenstein’s questions, of course, are rhetorical. Everyday language is not too coarse
to discuss philosophical problems, nor can we construct another, presumably better, lan-
guage for this kind of use. One suspects that Wittgenstein would be skeptical of any such
artiﬁcially constructed language, even if the ones creating it are philosophers:
It is wrong to say that in philosophy we consider an ideal language as opposed to
our ordinary one. For this makes it appear as though we thought we could improve
on ordinary language. But ordinary language is all right. Whenever we make up
“ideal languages” it is not in order to replace our ordinary language by them; but
just to remove some trouble caused in someone’s mind by thinking that he has got
hold of the exact use of a common word. That is also why our method is not merely
to enumerate actual usages of words, but rather deliberately to invent new ones,
some of them because of their absurd appearance. [BB p. 28]
Making up an “ideal language” should not be a prerequisite for philosophical analysis.
Formal logic, or any other ideal language, has only a minor role in clearing up problems
one may have in thinking. It is certainly not to be used to replace ordinary language.
Ordinary language is robust enough to be used in philosophical analysis. There is no
“ideal language” to which it aspires:
On the one hand it is clear that every sentence in our language “is in order as
it is.” That is to say, we are not striving after an ideal, as if our ordinary vague
sentences had not yet got a quite unexceptionable sense, and a perfect language
awaited construction by us.—On the other hand it seems clear that where there
is sense there must be perfect order.—So there must be perfect order even in the
vaguest sentence. [PI § 98]
Wittgenstein broadens his argument against reduction, now applying it to everyday objects:
But what are the simple constituent parts of which reality is composed?—What are
the simple constituent parts of a chair?—The bits of wood of which it is made? Or
the molecules, or the atoms?—“Simple” means: not composite. And here the point
is: in what sense “composite?” It makes no sense at all to speak absolutely of the
“simple parts of a chair.”
Again: Does my visual image of this tree, of this chair, consist of parts? And what
are its simple component parts? Multi-colouredness is one kind of complexity;
another is, for example, that of a broken outline composed of straight bits. And a
curve can be said to be composed of an ascending and a descending segment.
If I tell someone without any further explanation: “What I see before me now is
composite,” he will have the right to ask: “What do you mean by ‘composite’? For
there are all sorts of things that that can mean!”—The question “Is what you see
the necessary “deﬁnite sense”—its propositions were not always deﬁnitely true or false) . In their Principia
Mathematica they state that “Ordinary language yields no such help [in philosophical analysis].” Wittgenstein
did not wait until the Philosophical Investigations to disagree with this:
. . . all the propositions of our everyday language, just as they stand, are in perfect logical
order. [TLP §5.5563]

that is, which particular use of the word—is in question. [PI §47]
If language use is largely concerned with discussing everyday affairs, and these everyday
affairs often deal with common observable objects, these objects are not “composite” or
“simple” in any absolute sense. They can be seen variously as “simple” or “composite,”—
and not “simple” or “composite” in one or two ways, but in many ways. Their “simpleness”
or “compositeness” is dependent on what we are using them for, or in what circumstances
wetalkaboutthem.Ifwearetalkingaboutthingsthatwesiton,thenclearlya“chair”cannot
belogicallybrokendownintosmallerparts.Youwouldn’tsay,“Getmetheseatwiththelegs
and back attached to it” when you wanted a chair. When you are looking for something to
sit on, you don’t look for parts of a chair, except in very unusual circumstances (one might
imagine needing a chair of some sort in an urgent situation and making do with a couple
of boxes stacked together if that was all you have. But this is a rare situation.). Playing the
devil’s advocate, Wittgenstein tries to resurrect the dying sense of absolute compositeness:
But isn’t a chessboard, for instance, obviously, and absolutely, composite?—You
are probably thinking of the composition out of thirty-two white and thirty-two
black squares. But could we not also say, for instance, that it was composed of the
colours black and white and the schema of squares? And if there are quite different
ways of looking at it, so you still want to say that the chessboard is absolutely
“composite?”—Asking “Is this object composite?” outside a particular language-
game is like what a boy once did, who had to say whether the verbs in certain
sentences were in the active or passive voice, and who racked his brains over the
question whether the verb “to sleep” meant something active or passive. [PI §47]
Here Wittgenstein shows us where the distinction between the “simpleness” or “com-
positeness” of a chessboard shows up. It shows up in the language games that refer to
chessboards. Here we might take, for example, the request, “Get your chessboard out, I
want to play a game.” In this instance, the chessboard is simple, no further breakdown of
the “parts” of a chessboard would make any sense in this language game (remember that
Wittgenstein’s deﬁnition of language game included not just the words one might use, but
the circumstances in which they are uttered). But we also can imagine two people talking
about making a chess board. Here it would be quite reasonable for one to ask, “What
kind of wood did you use for the white squares?,” or, “How did you cut the squares so
well, they ﬁt perfectly?” Clearly, this example treats the chessboard as composed of small
squares of different colored wood. And we can make up other examples to show variations
on these uses. This points to an important aspect of Wittgenstein’s method of analysis.
That is, the way that we decide whether an object is “simple” or “composite” is not an
empirical investigation of the object—but a grammatical investigation of the language
that discusses it (taking “grammar” in Wittgenstein’s sense of “depth grammar” which
includes the activities in which the words or phrases are typically used). An empirical
investigation may lead us astray because we will be trying to determine whether the object
in question is “simple” or “complex” in some kind of absolute way—that is, in some way
that can be veriﬁed empirically and is independent of its description in language. This is an
important point, and bears further elaboration. For Wittgenstein, if we want to determine
whether something is “simple” or “composite” we don’t conduct an empirical investiga-
tion, we try to formulate different sentences that emphasize the object’s “simpleness” or

110
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
“compositeness” and see if they sound all right. The grammar of a language game mirrors
the one way, out of many possible ways, that we structure our view of the world for the
situations in which that language game is appropriate. For example, is a “tree” simple or
composite? Well, if trees are “composite” then sentences like, “Did you see the parts of
the tree?” would make sense. Since this sentence would strike most people as odd, we
might ﬁnd it hard to accept that trees are composite. But there could be circumstances
where such a statement might be understandable. For example, I might say, “John told me
that he cut down the tree already. Did you see any parts of the tree lying around?” This
is probably a marginally acceptable statement, the question might be better phrased, “Did
you see any logs or cut wood lying around?” But it is clear that, on average, trees are not
composite—and this is not an empirical statement, but a grammatical one. That is, we can
look at any number of trees and not be able to tell, in any kind of ﬁnal way, whether they
are “simple” or “composite”—they could be either. But if we construct some hypothetical
sentences that treat trees as, on the one hand, “simple,” and on the other, “composite,” we
can often immediately see which sentences look all right, and which do not. For example,
we might consider the appropriateness of the following sentences:
“Did you plant the tree?”
“What kind of tree is that?”
“How many kinds of oak tree are there?”
“Cut the tree up and put the logs in the ﬁrewood bin.”
“The gardener trimmed the tree by cutting off the lower branches.”
“The leaves of the walnut tree are a brilliant yellow in the Fall.”
“The roots of the tree were breaking the sidewalk.”
Here we can see that when we refer to trees we usually talk about them with the word “tree”
or “trees,” and do not refer to “parts” of the tree. When we want to refer to a part of the
tree rather than the whole, we do not call them “parts,” but “logs,” “branches,” “leaves”
or “roots” (although the statement “What part of the tree was damaged in the storm?”
would be acceptable). But if “logs,” “branches,” “leaves,” and “roots” are composite parts
of the tree, in the same way that “transmissions,” “fuel injectors,” and “differentials” are
composite parts of a car’s engine, then we should be able to say:
“All trees are composed of logs, branches, leaves and roots.”
This sentence is marginally acceptable (and may be made more acceptable by replacing
“logs” with “a trunk”) even though bamboo trees have no branches, deciduous trees have
no leaves in winter, and dead trees, which are still trees, have no leaves at any time. But
the above sentence is not the usual way that we refer to trees, and is certainly not the
kind of “compositeness” that we have with automobiles. Such a sentence, as Wittgenstein
remarked, gives us a “mental cramp.” We can see the difference by comparing other
statements about cars and trees:
“I took the engine apart and put it back together”
“I took the tree apart and put it back together”
The ﬁrst statement is OK, but not the second, so the compositeness of cars is very different
from the compositeness of trees, if we can even say that trees are composite in any way.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
111
When we refer to parts of a tree certain parts are appropriate to speciﬁc situations—that is,
speciﬁc language games—and not to others. For example, if we are talking about cutting
a tree up into ﬁrewood we might refer to “cut logs” or “kindling,” but not to “branches” or
“roots.” If we refer to “branches” or “roots” we refer to them in the context of gardening,
not making ﬁrewood. So our answer, if we were to construct more examples is that, in
general, trees are not treated grammatically as being “composite” in the same way that a
car can be seen as composite, but there are special circumstances where it makes sense to
talk about the parts of a tree using such speciﬁc terms as “branches,” “logs,” “leaves,” and
“roots.” Wittgenstein comments:
We use the word “composite” (and therefore the word “simple”) in an enormous
number of different and differently related ways. (Is the color of a square on a
chessboard simple, or does it consist of pure white and pure yellow? And is white
simple, or does it consist of the colours of the rainbow?—Is this length of 2 cm.
simple, or does it consist of two parts, each 1 cm. long? But why not of one bit
3 cm. long, and one bit 1 cm. long measured in the opposite direction?) To the
philosophical question: “Is the visual image of this tree composite, and what are its
component parts?” the correct answer is: “That depends on what you understand by
‘composite’.” (And that is of course not an answer but a rejection of the question.)169
[PI §47]
Getting back to the discussion of “games,” we can see that a deﬁnition of “games” that
tries to establish a set of necessary and sufﬁcient properties that all games have is doomed
to failure. No game has all the properties of other games, nor is there a necessary and
sufﬁcient set of properties that could determine whether something is a game or not.
Further, there is no single property that exists in all games. In fact, the only thing that
games have in common is that they are all games.170 This sounds facetious, but it is not. It
resists any reductive analysis of the category “games.” Games are simply games, they are
non-reducible concepts in the language games that refer to them. This does not mean we
cannot identify some features of games, but such features are heuristic not deﬁnitional. The
difference between heuristic and deﬁnitional is that the heuristic use of features utilizes
them primarily in training those who don’t understand the concept of “games” or those
who must distinguish games from other things for some purpose. Once they understand
what games are (i.e., they can use the word “games” correctly) they often dispense with the
identiﬁcation of games by features and see games simply as games. Many individuals who
know what games are, would not be able to give a deﬁnition of “games.” The deﬁnition
of “games” is simply not a necessary prerequisite to understanding what “games” are.171
169This is a common technique of Wittgenstein’s method of analysis, to show how something that we think is
simple is really complex.
170This point will be elaborated below.
171One alternative to reductive deﬁnitions that was not known in Wittgenstein’s time is the idea of “emergence.”
Instead of saying that games are deﬁned by certain characteristics, we can say that our concept of games emerges
from certain kinds of activities and circumstances. Philosopher Paul Humphries states that emergent phenomena
must satisfy two criteria: (1) The emergent phenomenon must be qualitatively different from what it emerged
from, and must exhibit novel features. (2) The emergent phenomenon must be autonomous from lower level
phenomena (emergent phenomena are subject to different rules than the lower level phenomena from which they
emerge). “Two Models of Emergence.” Presentation given at the University of Michigan, 7 March 2003. A case
could probably be made that “games” do satisfy these two criteria.

112
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
If “games” were a composite notion then we should be able to have clear answers to the
following questions:
“Of what parts is baseball composed?”
“Of what parts is hockey composed?”
“Of what parts is canasta composed?”
etc.
One can come up with valid sentences such as:
“Baseball consists of 9 innings”
“Hockey consists of 3 periods.”
These look like statements that satisfy the notion that at least some games are composite.
But these examples are misleading. Certainly games that occur over time can be said to be
“composed of” a number of discreet time intervals, but this does not mean that games are
essentially composite in the same way that, from a manufacturing point of view, cars are
composed of discrete parts. If games were composed of time intervals in the same way that
cars are composed of machined parts, then the parts of the game could exist independently
of the games. For example, it makes sense to say that differentials exist independently of
any car, but it does not make sense to say that “innings” exist independently of any baseball
game: such a statement sounds like a Zen Koan. Of the two sentences below, the ﬁrst is
grammatically correct, but the second is not:
“John took the transmission out of the car and put it over there.”
“John took the third inning out of the ball game and. . . ”
So, one grammatical criterion of the way we talk about parts that truly compose a more
complex object is that in normal circumstances we can speak of them as existing indepen-
dently of the complex object. Further, if we could say that some games are truly composed
of time intervals, then we could also say that people are composed of time intervals since
they exist over a succession of years. In fact, it would be hard to ﬁnd anything that did not
exist over speciﬁc periods of time. So, being composed of time intervals is a property of
virtually everything we know. As a result, the composition of entities existing over time
offers no information that distinguishes games from anything else. Existence over time is
a property of everything, hence it is a deﬁning property of nothing (by deﬁning property
I mean a property that distinguishes something from other related entities).
But if there is no set of properties that all games have, how do we identify games?
Wittgenstein says that this is really not a major problem if we think about it. We identify
games by having someone show us examples of games, or by playing in games ourselves.
In fact, if we are a typical individual who lives in modern society, we will have no difﬁculty
identifying games even though no one has explicitly deﬁned them for us. The only problem
that occurs is when we try to deﬁne all games as having some speciﬁc set of properties in
common.
The idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to ﬁnd
the common element in all its applications has shackled philosophical investigation;

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
113
for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss as irrelevant
the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him to understand the usage of
the general term. [BB pp. 19–20]
Certainly, there may be grey areas where an activity may or may not be a game. But this
does not concern Wittgenstein either:
Many words . . . then don’t have a strict meaning. But this is not a defect. To think
it is would be like saying that the light of my reading lamp is no real light at all
because it has no sharp boundary. [BB p. 27]
and,
Is it always an advantage to replace an indistinct picture by a sharp one? Isn’t the
indistinct one often exactly what we need? [PI §71]
This is not, of course, an argument for sloppy deﬁnitions. It is merely the observation that
looking for deﬁnitions in this case gets us away from the true foundation of our ability to
analyze and classify things like “games.” By trying to ﬁnd a common set of properties that
we can use to determine set membership, we are guilty of trying to make an “indistinct
picture into a sharp one.” This is an interesting analogy, not just because it argues against
the forcing of precision on to an imprecise process, but for something more subtle. If we
take an indistinct picture and turn it into a sharp one there are any number of “sharp”
images that we can construct from the indistinct one. Further, there are no criteria to tell
us which, of the many sharp pictures we can construct, is the one that is most faithful
to our original image. Think of a blurry photograph of a person you do not know. If
it is digital, we can certainly make it sharper with computer programs like Photoshop,
but will it be a better likeness of the actual person who was photographed?—won’t the
sharper picture introduce a misleading precision into the image? The computerization
of intelligent activity, such as the modeling of expert judgement in an expert system, is
sometimes guilty of this. They take the vague or “blurry” rules of expert decision-making
and make them more precise, that is “sharper,” because computers work best with precise
commands. For computer programs, just as for formal logic, precision is not a result of
the process, but a requirement for it. As Wittgenstein comments:
The more narrowly we examine language, the sharper becomes the conﬂict between
it and our requirement. (For the crystalline purity of logic was, of course, not a
result of investigation; it was a requirement.) The conﬂict becomes intolerable; the
requirement is now in danger of becoming empty.—We have got onto slippery ice
where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also,
just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want to walk; so we need friction.
Back to the rough ground! [PI §107]
But what happens when we codify expert behavior in precise rules? What often happens
is that we cease to have expert judgments any more. We turn an expert decision process
into a novice decision process.172
172H. Dreyfus and S. Dreyfus pointed out that only novices use precise rules, experts do not. [Mind over
Machine: The Power of Human Intuitive Expertise in the Era of the Computer. Free Press, 1986]

114
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
We do not think of a set of properties when we think of games. We think of examples
of games, examples that form a family of similar activities. What helps us the most in
understanding which of our activities are games and which are not is our involvement
in activities that we come to describe as “games.” This gets us back to Wittgenstein’s
insistence that when we want to understand some general term, such as “games,” we
should not ask for a general deﬁnition or essence that holds for all games—this will lead
us away from what we want. Deﬁnitions may also give us a false sense of analytical
rigor. We need to ask how we would use such a term like “games,” and this entails some
description or demonstration of what games are. John Wisdom, a student of Wittgenstein’s,
and later a philosopher himself, understood this well when he talked about Wittgenstein’s
technique:
. . . the substitution of ‘Ask for the use’ for ‘Ask for the meaning’ is linked with the
procedure of explaining meaning by presenting not a deﬁnition but cases, and not
with one case but cases and cases.173
Wittgenstein applies the same methods to his analysis of language games as he does to
“games” alone. That is, when we start tabulating what we perceive to be language games,
we ﬁnd that there is not a single common set of properties that deﬁne them. Instead, there
is a prodigious diversity of them:
But how many kinds of sentences are there? Say assertation, question, and
command?—There are countless kinds; countless different kinds of use of what we
call “symbols” “words,” “sentences.” And this multiplicity is not something ﬁxed,
given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say,
come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a
rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.)
Here the term “language-game” is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the
speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.174 [PI §23]
Does Wittgenstein’s resistance to philosophical reduction mean that it can never be used
to analyze something? No, it does not. There are lots of language games where it is
appropriate to talk about entities that are composed of smaller, simpler objects. When
we talk about a manufacturing process, such as making a car, it is clearly part of the
grammatical structure of this language game that cars are composed of many precisely
identiﬁable components. But if we are talking about driving a car, such as when we ask
a friend to give us a ride, the components that are part of the manufacturing process
become irrelevant. Here we engage in a different language game, a language game where
passenger capacity, power steering, air conditioning, and automatic transmissions may be
important components of the car. Even within the automobile manufacturing language
game the parts breakdown is not as obvious as might ﬁrst appear. Cars have welds, glue,
anti-freeze, brake ﬂuid, gasoline, and oil, but from the point of view of manufacturing

174J. Searle [Speech Acts: An Essay in the Philosophy of Language. Cambridge University Press, 1969]
attempted to show that this kind of diversity does not exist in language (this was discussed in more detail in
footnotes 29, and 134) and that there are only a few distinct types of language games or speech acts (he speciﬁcally
objected to this quotation from PI).

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
115
these are not considered components of a car; that is, while the gas tank is a component,
the gas in the tank is not.
Since there are language games where some reduction is acceptable when we want to know
what a word “means,” the natural question becomes, “Where do we stop our reductive
analysis?” Wittgenstein’s answer to this is to focus our attention back on the activities
or situations where the word in question is used. If we are talking about how a car is
manufactured, then it makes sense to break the car down into the components of the car—
carburetor, differential, transmission, etc. We may even break these components down into
individual parts such as nuts, bolts, washers, etc. But this is where we stop. We don’t break
the individual car parts down into their chemical components. Such a level of analysis
would not make sense if we were discussing how cars are put together; it might make sense,
though, if we are talking about how foundries prepare the metal for casting the different
components of a car, using different alloys for different components. If, on the other hand,
we are concerned with renting a car, we would probably not care whether the car has a
carburetor or fuel injection. We would be more concerned with how much the rental cost is,
what the fuel efﬁciency is, and whether the car had enough room to seat several passengers
comfortably. These different uses of the word “car” form a “family” of related usages. They
resemble each other in the same way that members of a family may resemble each other.
But even family resemblance is not a single notion: think of how two brothers resemble
each other, and how this might be different from how a brother and a sister resemble each
other, or, how family members from different generations resemble each other. Family re-
semblance is not always just a question of physiognomy, either. Two individuals who look
strikingly similar but are not related would not be said to have a family resemblance. But,
even here, we can extend the usage of family resemblance beyond blood relatives by saying
something like, “If those two young men were related, I would say that they had a remark-
ably strong family resemblance.” This, perhaps, gets more closely to what Wittgenstein
meant by family resemblances, viz., the resembling entities don’t necessarily come from
a family—though this is the paradigm case—they form a family of resembling entities.
It is important to note that the resemblance between different family members is of a
different sort than the resemblance between cars, or between paintings. What enables us
to see these various kinds of resemblance is that there is a grammatical place for such
resemblance in the language games where they occur. For example, seeing a resemblance
in the physical characteristics of a car may be useful in purchasing a car (“I want a car
that looks sporty”); or, seeing the resemblance between paintings may help us to see
the relationships between different schools of painting (“Notice how the striking colors
and severe brushstrokes of the Fauvist painters seem to be a reaction to the delicacy and
subtlety of Impressionism.”). The notion of family resemblance can be applied variously
in sundry language games and situations. If this is the case, then the question arises, “Has
Wittgenstein substituted an uncontrolled relativity for the rigor of reduction?” Surely he
must still explain how we can avoid complete subjectivity in the application of linguistic
categories. How can we use words correctly that have such a wide variety of applications?
Wittgenstein gives us no direct explanation there. He asks us, simply, to look at our
everyday use of words. If the application of words is strongly subjective, in the way, for
example, that our personal appreciation of art often is, then we should be in a constant
state of linguistic confusion and misunderstanding, but we are not. Further, if estimations

116
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
of family resemblance are as subjective or varied as aesthetic judgments then we should be
able to substitute references to family resemblances for references to aesthetic judgments
in grammatically correct sentences:
“Only an expert can judge whether art is from the same artist or school (i.e., that
two works resemble each other in a way that indicates they are by the same
artist or from the same school)”
“Only an expert can judge whether two individuals look like they come from the
same family.”
Here, the ﬁrst sentence sounds all right, but the second does not. Clearly, the judgment
of family resemblance is not of the same genre as aesthetic judgments. It is a skill that is
not reserved exclusively for experts, but available to and practiced by us all. Wittgenstein
is not concerned with how often we might be mistaken or misunderstood, he asks us
to focus on our correct usage of language in these kinds of situations. What is truly
remarkable, for Wittgenstein, is not how many times we are misunderstood, but how often
we are understood perfectly well. We can somehow take ordinary words, such as “car”
or “tree” or “friend” and, although we can use them in a wide variety of contexts and
situations and they appear to have many related “meanings,” we somehow seem to use
them and are understood most of the time. This is what is truly remarkable about our use
of language. How can we account for the fact that we can say something very precise
with such seemingly ambiguous words? The answer, according to Wittgenstein, is right
before our eyes. What accounts for our precise use of language is not some latent or
unconscious understanding of the essential deﬁnitions of words, or some kind of access
to “deep language structures,” but our participation in common activities or practices:
Suppose you came as an explorer into an unknown country with a language quite
strange to you. In what circumstances would you say that the people there gave
orders, understood them, obeyed them, rebelled against them, and so on?
The common behavior of mankind is the system of reference by means of which
we interpret an unknown language.175 [PI §206]
What we have in common with others is not so much our language, but our common
participation and involvement in the intensely human activities of mankind. When we use
words in a particular way that conveys our meaning unambiguously we understand this
usage, not because the words have some common, essential meaning to them, but because
we share the activities or practices in which the word is used. These common activities
and practices are what Wittgenstein referred to as the “forms of life”:
. . . to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life. [PI §19]
or,
175Wittgenstein gives a more detailed discussion of a similar example on pages 101ff of BB (as noted be-
fore, much of the writings in the BB were preliminary discussions of ideas that were developed in the later
PI.).

What has to be accepted, the given, is—so one could say—forms of life.176 [PI
p. 226]
We can see how Wittgenstein’s assessment of meaning in language has moved from a
formal logical model (in The Tractatus . . . ) to a pragmatic/anthropological model (in
Philosophical Investigations). It seems at ﬁrst glance that Wittgenstein is trading away
the rigor of his earlier logical model for a less rigorous, but more realistic model of
meaning, but he is not. The more pragmatic, activity-oriented model of language has a
deceptive rigor about it—in Wittgenstein’s terms:
My method is not to sunder the hard from the soft, but to see the hardness of the
soft. [NB p. 44]
Wittgenstein’s Place in the Nominalist-Realist Debate
Looking back on the nominalist:realist debate we can now see Wittgenstein’s place in
this controversy. Given a category such as “chairs,” Wittgenstein would agree with the
realist that there are observable differences between chairs and other common objects such
as refrigerators. But the realist concludes from this correct observation that there must
be properties that all chairs have in addition to the fact that they are chairs. Wittgenstein
agreeswiththerealist’sobservation,butdisagreeswithhisinference:inshort,Wittgenstein
claims that what chairs have in common is that they are chairs. Chairs, like games, may
have some features in common, but they do not need to have a single common feature, nor
do they need some subset of features with different chairs having different subsets of the
features. For us, chairs are simply chairs; they cannot be reduced to a necessary, deﬁning
set of properties—what features they have are heuristic rather than deﬁnitional.
The nominalist, on the other hand, makes the correct observation that all observable entities
are unique, and infers from this that there is no single way for a group of things to be
categorized. Wittgenstein makes a similar claim in another way: there is no limit to the
number of ways an entity can be categorized. Consequently, he agrees with the nominalist’s
inference that there can be no single observable way that entities can be classiﬁed. But
he does not agree with the nominalist’s further inference: that because there are so many
ways to classify things, no classiﬁcation based on observed features is possible—in effect,
what chairs have in common is that we call them “chairs.” Bambrough observes:
The nominalist says that games have nothing in common except that they are called
games.
The realist says that games must have something in common, and he means by this
that they must have something in common other than that they are games.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Wittgenstein says that games have nothing in common except that they are games.
Wittgenstein thus denies at one and the same time the nominalist’s claim that games
have nothing in common except that they are called games and the realist’s claim
that games have something in common other than that they are games. He asserts
at one and the same time the realist’s claim that there is an objective justiﬁcation
for the application for the word “game” to games and the nominalist’s claim that
there is no element that is common to all games.177
Bambrough continues:
There is no limit to the number of possible classiﬁcations of objects. (The nominalist
is right about this.)
There is no classiﬁcation of any set of objects which is not objectively based on
genuine similarities and differences. (The realist is right about this.) The nominalist
is so impressed by the inﬁnite diversity of possible classiﬁcations that he is blinded
to their objectivity.
The realist is so impressed by the objectivity of all genuine classiﬁcations that he
underestimates their diversity.
Of course we may if we like say that there is one complete system of classiﬁcation
which marks all the similarities and all the differences. (This is the realist’s summing
up of what we can learn by giving critical attention to the realist and the nominalist
in turn.)

I believe that Wittgenstein solved what is known as “the problem of universals,” and I would
say of his solution, as Hume said of Berkeley’s treatment of the same topic, that it is “one of
the greatest and most valuable discoveries that has been made of late years in the republic of
letters.”
I do not expect these claims to be accepted by many philosophers. [p. 266]
Bambrough was correct in that at least a few philosophers leveled criticisms against his interpretation of, and
optimism about, Wittgenstein’s views on universals. Most of these criticisms hinge on philosophical points that
are not signiﬁcant for our present discussion, but the interested reader might ﬁnd the following critical discussions
of Bambrough of interest:

Or we may say that there are only similarities and differences, from which we may
choose according to our purposes and interests. (This is the nominalist’s summing
up.)
In talking of genuine or objective similarities and differences we must not forget
that we are concerned with similarities and differences between possible cases as
well as between actual cases, and indeed that we are concerned with the actual cases
only because they are themselves a selection of the possible cases.178
Forms of Life
Wittgenstein introduces the notion of a form of life early in Philosphical Investigations.
But although forms of life are essential components of Wittgenstein’s philosophy of lan-
guage, he only explicitly uses the phrase ﬁve times in this work: in addition to the two
quotations above (the one at footnote 180 and the preceding quotation), the three other
references that Wittgenstein makes to forms of life in PI are:
But how many kinds of sentences are there? Say assertation, question, and
command?—There are countless kinds; countless different kinds of use of what we
call “symbols” “words,” “sentences.” And this multiplicity is not something ﬁxed,
given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say,
come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a
rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.)
Here the term “language-game” is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the
speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life. [PI §23]
“So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?”—
It is what human beings say that is true and false; and they agree in the language
they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life. [PI §241]
Onecanimagineananimalangry,frightened,unhappy,happy,startled.Buthopeful?
And why not?
A dog believes his master is at the door. But can he also believe his master will
come the day after to-morrow?—And what can he not do here?—How do I do
it?—How am I supposed to answer this?
Can only those hope who can talk? Only those who have mastered the use of a
language. That is to say, the phenomena of hope are modes of this complicated
form of life. [PI p. 174]
The mere counting of references does not indicate the importance of this notion for
Wittgenstein, and these ﬁve quotations have enough variety that they are probably not
sufﬁcient to get precisely what he is talking about. But although he only uses the words
“form(s) of life” ﬁve times in Philosophical Investigations, the concept that is behind

them runs like an undercurrent through much of his work, and is closely linked, I think,
to a “family” of related concepts:
“background”
[Hintergrund]
“background within human life”
[Hintergrund im menschlichen Leben]
“bustle of life”
[Getriebe des Lebens]
“human behavior”
[Menschliche Handlungsweise]
“circumstances”
[Umst¨anden]
“common behavior of mankind”
[Gemeinsame menschliche Handlungsweise]
“natural history”
[Naturgeschichte]
“pattern of life”
[Lebensmuster]
“weave of life”
[Lebensteppich]
“stream of life”
[Fluss des Lebens]
“occasions”
[Anl¨assen]
“activities”
[T¨atigkeiten]
“swirl of human actions”
[Gewimmel der menschlichen Handlungen]
“This is simply what I do”
[So handle ich eben]
In order to understand the concept of forms of life (or the family of concepts relating to
it), we can look at the speciﬁc references for the above related concepts:
“background within human life,” “bustle of life,” “hurly-burly”:
We judge an action according to its background within human life, and this
background is not monochrome, but we might picture it as a very complicated
ﬁligree pattern, which, to be sure, we can’t copy, but which we can recognize from
the general impression it makes. [RPP II §624]
The background is the bustle of life. And our concepts points to something within
this bustle. [RPP II §625]
And it is the very concept “bustle” that brings about this indeﬁniteness. For a bustle
only comes about through constant repetition. And there is no deﬁnite starting point
for “constant repetition.” [RPP II §626]
How could human behavior be described? Surely only by showing the action of a
variety of humans, as they are all mixed up together. Not what one person is doing
now, but the whole hurly-burly, is the background against which we see an action,
and it determines our judgement, our concepts, and our reactions.179 [RPP II §629]
Wittgenstein often refers to “background” as an “inherited background”:
179Boldface type added. §629 is similar to §567 in Z:
How could human behavior be described? Surely only by sketching the actions of a variety of
humans, as they are all mixed up together. What determines our judgment, our concepts and
reactions, is not what one man is doing now, an individual action, but the whole hurly-burly
of human actions, the background against which we see any action.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
121
But I did not get my picture of the world by satisfying myself of its correctness;
nor do I have it because I am satisﬁed of its correctness. No; it is the inherited
background against which I distinguish between true and false. [OC §94]
What Wittgenstein is trying to get at here is that we assume without question many of the
concepts and background by which we distinguish between what is the case and what is
not. This background is not inferred or constructed by us after intense observation, we
assume it, for the most part, without question during our formative years because it has
been accepted by others. And what we assume is not a set of rules or a precise framework.
What we learn is to act as if much of this background or context is the case. For example,
one does not learn that gravity causes a ball to fall to the earth, one learns to play games
where this assumption is the basis for playing the game—it is not questioned, nor even
raised:
Language—I want to say—is a reﬁnement; “in the begining was the deed.”180
It also would be strange to question much of this background, and in some cases, it would
be impossible to do so. But there are kinds of background that are less fundamental which
we can question and choose to assume or not. An example might be the assumption of
the context of the military when one enlists in the service. This would take some time to
acquire and much of the military context would be at odds with the civilian one—such as
the license to kill people during wartime. But, in general, what we can question about our
context or background is probably only a small part of the totality that we assume.181
“circumstances,” “common behavior of mankind”:
Suppose you came as an explorer into an unknown country with a language quite
strange to you. In what circumstances would you say that the people there gave
orders, understood them, obeyed them, rebelled against them, and so on?
The common behaviour [sic] of mankind is the system of reference by means of
which we interpret an unknown language. [PI §206]
180Page 31, Culture and Value [hereafter referred to as CV], Blackwell, Oxford, 1980. Translated by P. Winch.
This will be discussed in more detail in the section “The Foundation of Language in Instinctive Behavior.”
181Much of Wittgenstein’s discussion in his On Certainty is directed at what you can question and what you
cannot question about reality. Statements like “I know that this is a hand,” when you are referring to your own hand
[OC §19], appear to be empirical claims, but, according to Wittgenstein, they are really logical, or grammatical,
statements. Such statements are not claims about reality for there is no observation that could conﬁrm or deny
the existence of your hand in normal circumstances. These statements reveal the grammatical or logical structure
of factual assertions. As Monk writes:
. . . if the contrary of a proposition makes sense, then that proposition can be regarded as
an empirical hypothesis, its truth or falsity being dependent on the way things stand in the
world. But if the contrary of a proposition does not make sense, then the proposition is not
descriptive of the world but of our conceptual framework; it is then a part of logic. Thus:
“Physical objects exist” is not an empirical proposition, for its contrary is not false but
incomprehensible. [Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius, p. 563. Free Press, NY,
1990.]

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
“Circumstances”arenotthesamethingasformsoflife,buttheyareanecessarybackground
for them. That is, forms of life can be speciﬁable activities such as walking, ﬁxing the
house, raking the leaves, driving a car, etc. But each of these actions presupposes a set
of circumstances which are needed for the activity to make sense. For example, driving
a car is a structured activity that many of us have engaged in at one time or another, but
to do this requires a speciﬁc set of circumstances for us to carry it out—for example, we
must have a working car available, there must be a road or some other drivable surface
nearby, we must have a key to the car, we must have a valid license if we are to drive on a
public road, etc. Wittgenstein calls these circumstances “normal circumstances” or “stage
setting.” But what are “normal circumstances?” Wittgenstein continues:
. . . we recognize normal circumstances but cannot precisely describe them. At
most, we can describe a range of abnormal ones.182 [OC § 27]
The reason that we can’t describe “normal circumstances” is that we just don’t notice
them—and we don’t notice them because we don’t need to notice them. We frequently act
as if we assume that they are constantly around us, which they usually are. But why is it so
difﬁcult for us to describe them or even to notice them in any detail? Wittgenstein would
probably answer that, except in rare circumstances, we just don’t have a language game
for describing “normal circumstances”—there is no grammatical place for this kind of
description in our language. If we can assume that we usually ﬁnd ourselves in “normal
circumstances,” then why would we need to describe them? If we felt a need to describe
these circumstances we would probably frequently utter sentences like:
“In normal circumstances, I will mail the letter at the post ofﬁce.”
“In normal circumstances, I will drive to the store and buy some milk.”
Such sentences would be considered odd in everyday usage because they state the obvious
and don’t really add any information to the statement. In fact, the only information that
they might add is that the speaker needs to speak oddly for some reason or other. The
listener’s reply might be:
“Why are you speaking so oddly—are you afraid that ‘normal circumstances’ will
somehow not occur?”
Butwedohavelanguagegamesfordescribing“abnormalcircumstances”—thedescription
of abnormal circumstances does play a role in our lives. We need to describe them from
time to time, if only to describe how some event has differed from our normal expectations,
for example we might say, “I would have come at 2:00 but the bridge washed out.” But even
here, there is never a “complete” description of such circumstances. What we describe is
what is important for the situation at hand.183 “natural history”:
182There are, of course, language games and circumstances where an anthropologist might describe “normal
circumstances,” viz. when describing the “normal circumstances” of a culture different than his own. Even here,
though, “normal circumstances” would not be described in detail, but only insofar as they differ from those of
the anthropologist’s own culture.
183There are anthropologists who have tried to describe some of the “normal circumstances” of different
countries or cultures. Edward Hall is a well known writer in this regard (The Silent Language. Anchor
Books/Doubleday, NY, 1959, The Hidden Dimension. Anchor Books/Doubleday, NY, 1966, Beyond Culture.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
123
. . . commanding, questioning, recounting, chatting, are as much a part of our nat-
ural history as walking, eating, drinking, playing. [PI §25]
Anchor Books/Doubleday, NY, 1976 and, Hidden Differences: Doing Business with the Japanese. Anchor
Books/Doubleday, NY, 1987). But even here Hall does not try to describe all the characteristics of “normal
circumstances” for any culture, but limits himself to describing the differences between the normal circum-
stances of two or more cultures. Hall, though, is characteristically modest about what he can say about cultural
differences:
Culture hides much more than it reveals, and strangely enough what it hides, it hides most
effectively from its own participants. Years of study have convinced me that the real job is
not to understand foreign culture but to understand our own. I am also convinced that all that
one ever gets from studying foreign culture is a token understanding. The ultimate reason
for such study is to learn more about how one’s own system works. . . Simply learning one’s
own culture is an achievement of gargantuan proportions for anyone. [The Silent Language,
p. 30]
Seventeen years later, Hall was still convinced that inter-cultural interaction is a great source of knowledge:
. . . the great gift that the members of the human race have for each other is not exotic expe-
riences but an opportunity to achieve awareness of the structure of their own system, which
can be accomplished only by interacting with others who do not share that system—members
of the opposite sex, different age groups, different ethnic groups, and different cultures—all
sufﬁce. [Beyond Culture, p. 44]
Hall says that most individuals have stopped learning by the time they are young adults. For these individuals,
the study of foreign culture has an important positive result:
. . . man’s tremendous brain has endowed him with a drive and a capacity for learning which
appear to be as strong as the drive for food or sex. This means that when a middle-aged man
stops learning he is often left with a great drive and highly developed capacities. If he goes
to live in another culture, the learning process is often reactivated. [ibid.]
This statement may have an interesting relevance to Wittgenstein’s work. Speciﬁcally, Wittgenstein was one of
the few major philosophers who lived most of his adult life in a culture different from the one in which he grew
up. Not only were the countries different (Austria vs. England), but they were on opposite sides of two world
wars, which only served to heighten the differences between them (Wittgenstein served in the Austrian army
in WWI, but lived in England during WWII, volunteering as a hospital orderly for a period of time). Further,
Wittgenstein also lived, as an adult, in a different socio-economic group than the one in which he grew up. He
came from an extremely wealthy Viennese family with strong ties to the musical and artistic life of Vienna. His
father, Karl, was a wealthy industrialist and an avid patron of the arts—composers Brahms, Walter, Mahler and
Labor were frequent guests in the “Palais Wittgenstein.” Wittgenstein’s sister Margarete was the subject of a
famous portrait by Gustav Klimt and Ravel wrote a piano piece for Wittgenstein’s brother Paul. (Paul had lost
an arm in WWI, but still managed a respectable career playing entirely with his remaining hand. Ravel wrote
his 1931 “Concerto for the Left Hand” speciﬁcally for him.)
Although Wittgenstein remained in England for nearly all of his adult life, he maintained a critical attitude towards
British culture: “[A] fundamental difﬁculty was Wittgenstein’s dislike of English culture in general. . . “[Monk.
Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius, p. 568. Free Press, NY, 1990.]. If Hall is correct in his assertion that cultural
differences keep man’s “learning process” active, Wittgenstein’s living in a culture that was not only different
from his native one, but also one which he disliked may have kept his intellect more focused and productive
later in his life. It may also help to explain his later concern about how our “forms of life,” or shared activities—
loosely, our “culture”—affect the way we think. Wittgenstein often felt emotionally estranged from others—he
was rarely completely comfortable with his friends or even his family. While this may have been the source of
much personal pain, it may also have been the means by which he attained the necessary objectivity to see how
others are inﬂuenced by “what we do”—even when we are doing philosophy.

What we are supplying are really remarks on the natural history of human beings;
we are not contributing curiosities however, but observations which no one has
doubted, but which have escaped remark only because they are always before our
eyes. [PI §415]
“pattern of life,” “weave of life,” “stream of life”:
If a pattern of life is the basis for the use of a word then the word must contain
some amount of indeﬁniteness. The pattern of life, after all, is not one of exact
regularity. [LWPP I §211]
Seeing life as a weave, this pattern (pretence, say) is not always complete and is
varied in a multiplicity of ways. But we, in our conceptual world, keep on seeing
the same, recurring with variations. That is how our concepts take it. For concepts
are not for use on a single occasion. [Z §568]
“Grief” describes a pattern which recurs, with different variations in the weave
of our life. If a man’s bodily expression of sorrow and of joy alternated, say with
the ticking of a clock, here we should not have the characteristic formation of the
pattern of sorrow or of the pattern of joy. [PI p. 174]
For words have meaning only in the stream of life. [RPP II §687]
What goes on within has meaning only in the stream of life. [LWPP II p. 30]
“occasions,” “activities”:
. . . we don’t start from certain words, but from certain occasions or activities.184
“swirl of human actions”:
Our concepts, judgements, reactions never appear in connection with just a single
action, but rather with the whole swirl of human actions. [LWPP II p. 56]
“simply what I do”:
If I have exhausted the justiﬁcations I have reached bedrock, and my spade is turned.
Then I am inclined to say: “This is simply what I do.” [PI §217]
All of these variants form a “family” of concepts related to forms of life. They do not
comprise a deﬁnition of forms of life, but, taken together, they give us a better understanding
of the kinds of things that Wittgenstein meant. But this indeﬁniteness about what forms of
life are is somewhat disconcerting, especially since we ﬁnd it difﬁcult to give up our need
for deﬁnitions and explanations. Wittgenstein understands this:
184Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology, and Religious Belief. Edited by Cyril Barrett
[University of California Press, Berkeley, 1972, p. 3]. Hereafter referred to as LC.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
125
Remember that we sometimes demand deﬁnitions for the sake not of their content
but of their form. Our requirement is in architectural one; the deﬁnition a kind of
ornamental coping that supports nothing. [PI §217]
Pitkin comments on the lack of a clear deﬁnition for forms of life:
That notion [forms of life] is never explicitly deﬁned, and we should not try to
force more precision from it than its rich suggestiveness will bear. But its general
signiﬁcanceisclearenough:humanlifeasweliveandobserveitisnotjustarandom,
continuous ﬂow, but displays recurrent patterns, regularities, characteristic ways of
doing and being, of feeling and acting, of speaking and interacting.
Because they are patterns, regularities, conﬁgurations, Wittgenstein calls them
forms; and because they are patterns in the fabric of human existence and ac-
tivity on each, he calls them forms of life. The idea is clearly related to the idea
of a language game, and more generally to Wittgenstein’s action-oriented view of
language. “The speaking of language,” he says, “is part of an activity, or form of
life.” How we talk is just part of it, is embedded in, what we do. “Commanding,
questioning, recounting, chatting, are as much a part of our natural history as walk-
ing, eating, drinking, playing.” We all know our shared forms of life, these basic,
general human ways of being and doing, though they have never been taught to us
and we could not begin to be able to put into words what we know about them.
Wittgenstein says that they are part of our “natural history,” regularities “which
no one has doubted, but which have escaped remark only because they are always
before our eyes.” . . . The notion of forms of life should help us to understand the
sense in which language may be said to be conventional.185
Even though Wittgenstein spends little time describing or discussing these forms of life in
any detail, one should not infer that they are unimportant components of his philosophy.
In fact, just the opposite is true. As Malcolm points out:
Wittgenstein says that his philosophical observations are “remarks on the natu-
ral history of human beings.” It would be difﬁcult to exaggerate the signiﬁcance
of that comment. It is often said that Wittgenstein’s work belongs to “linguistic
philosophy”—that he “talks about words.” True enough. But he is trying to get
readers to think of how the words are tied up with human life, with patterns of
response, in thought and action. His conceptual studies are a kind of anthropology.
His descriptions of the human forms of life on which our concepts are based make
us aware of the kind of creature we are.186
Readers of Wittgenstein’s early work such as that in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
would be struck by the absence of any detailed reference to the forms of life and related
concepts. Nowhere is this more signiﬁcant than his remarks on language. In his early
work, Wittgenstein believed that expressions in language—primarily propositions or, as
185H. Pitkin. Wittgenstein and Justice, pp. 132–133. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1972, pp. 132–

126
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
he called them, “pictures of facts”—had a “deﬁnite sense.” This deﬁnite sense, or mean-
ing, stayed the same no matter where or when a statement was uttered or occurred. It
is signiﬁcant that Wittgenstein aims some of his earliest criticism in Philosophical In-
vestigations at this kind of “essentialism” in language. For early Wittgenstein, language
consists largely of propositions, and propositions are like pictures. But we have already
discussed how pictures can be interpreted, or seen, variously, so pictures—and by infer-
ence propositions—cannot have a “deﬁnite sense.” Later, Wittgenstein saw that even with
words which are simple references to objects the “meaning” of these words is not always
clear. Consider the “slab language” again (supra). Wittgenstein showed that although the
single expression, “Slab!” has the same appearance wherever it occurs, and its reference to
a speciﬁc object can be clear, its meaning can still vary radically from context to context,
or activity to activity. It can also vary according to the training of those who understand it.
As we pointed out, the single word “Slab!” can mean “Bring the slab here!,” “Put the slab
over there!,” “Break the slab up!,” etc. It is easy to imagine additional situations where
“Slab!” might mean something entirely different. Malcolm comments:
A shrug of the shoulders is a familiar gesture that means something different
in different situations. It does not have a ﬁxed meaning. Neither does a familiar
sentence.
Wittgenstein’s repudiation of the assumption that the sense of language is inde-
pendent of the circumstances of life in which the language is used, is perhaps the
single most important aspect of his break with what he calls in the preface of the
Investigations “my old way of thinking.”187
The relation between the sense of a statement and the context in which it occurs is clearly
articulated in Wittgenstein’s last work, On Certainty:
The words “I am here” have sense only in certain contexts, and not when I say them
to someone who is sitting in front of me and sees me clearly—and not because they
are superﬂuous, but because their meaning is not determined by the situation, yet
stands in need of such determination. [OC §348]
One might assume that the lack of a deﬁnition for forms of life leaves us unclear about what
they are. Not so, according to Wittgenstein. In fact, there really is no “deﬁnition” to them.
But how do we know what they are? The answer is relatively straightforward: We know
them by participating in them; we are actively involved in them on a daily basis. If I say that
walking, eating, driving, explaining, questioning, etc. are all forms of life, will you have
any difﬁculty understanding what I mean? Not likely. But we don’t begin our lives with an
understanding of many of these forms of life (an infant can certainly eat, but it cannot walk,
drive or talk). So how do we learn these activities? We don’t learn them by memorizing a
set of rules or deﬁnitions. We learn them by having them demonstrated to us. We then try
to perform them ourselves and have our attempts reﬁned through the coaching of others
who are more knowledgeable about them than we are. Here Wittgenstein’s concept of a
game is important for nonlinguistic activity too. The easiest way to see this is to imagine
how you might come to learn some card or athletic game. Some of the teaching might be
187N. Malcolm. Nothing is Hidden, p. 271. Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1986.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
127
verbal, and some might not be. There may also be rules that govern our behavior in some
of these activities, but the rules do not completely cover all the actions of the activity, in
the way that the rules of basketball do not cover every aspect of the game (e.g., there is no
description of how a player can shoot the ball other than he cannot kick it). It is important
to understand that although there may be a great deal of variability in the conduct of these
activities, they are not totally arbitrary. We know that they are not arbitrary because we
do have a sense of how they can be done badly or incorrectly—basketball games can be
played incorrectly, the rules of etiquette can be violated, our statements to others may
inadvertently offend them, etc.
From these examples we can make the following general observations about forms of life:
1. They are dynamic. The forms of life are not static, but can change over time. The
rate of change varies according to the rate of change of the activities that they
represent. For example, the activity of “riding a horse” as a common mode of
transportation gave way to “driving a horse-drawn cart,” and this, in turn, gave
way to “driving an automobile.” These activities were similar in many respects
and different in others. Even within the category of driving modern cars there is a
signiﬁcant amount of variation (some cars have four gear stick shifts, some have
ﬁve gears, some have automatic transmissions, some have different size engines,
etc.).
2. Forms of life are not deﬁnable in any complete way; there is no essential deﬁnition
to them. In fact, were we to ﬁnd a “complete deﬁnition” such a deﬁnition would
not be able to account for our ability to act in accordance with the loose structure
of these forms of life. Such a deﬁnition would not contain any instructions on how
to apply it to the activity in which it is used. Since these activities can vary a lot
within the rough boundaries of a form of life, there must be something that shows
how the concept of an activity can be applied. In general, this is not done by rules,
but by training.
3. Forms of life have an inherent “indeﬁniteness” to them:
If a pattern of life is the basis for the use of a word then the word must
contain some amount of indeﬁniteness. The pattern of life, after all, is not
one of exact regularity. [LWPP I §211]
Consider the form of life or activity “pitching a baseball.” It is clear that in American
baseball all the pitchers do roughly the same thing: they throw the ball towards the
catcher and the batter who are positioned near “home plate.” The pitcher’s intent is
to strike out the batter, or have him hit the ball badly. In addition, he must throw the
ball close enough to the batter that he will not “walk” him. The batter, on the other
hand, wants to hit the ball well or force the pitcher to walk him. This duel between
the batter and pitcher is the essential tension of the game. Now from this general
description, pitching a baseball appears to be the same thing for all pitchers. But if
we look at, say, professional baseball pitchers we ﬁnd a great deal of variety in the
way this is done. In the ﬁrst place, there are many ways to throw the ball: overhand,
three quarters, sidearm, and underhand. There is also a wide range of speeds that

128
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
a pitcher can throw the ball at, and a wide variety of pitches: fast ball, slider,
screwball, overhand curve, knuckleball, forkball, split-ﬁngered fastball, etc. Each
pitcher will often throw these pitches differently than others (“Nobody could throw
a curve like Koufax!”). Additionally, pitchers may have different “windups”: some
pitch from the “stretch” and some do not, and some have truly unique deliveries,
such as Luis Tiant or Hideo Nomo. But in spite of all these differences, we can
still see that the activity all these pitchers have in common is pitching the ball.
4. Forms of life (and the activities that are “woven” into language games) have mean-
ing for us in relation to the role or importance they play in our lives. If we are not
professional baseball players, then the distinctions between “sliders,” “forkballs,”
and “curves” will have little meaning to us. We can understand a baseball player’s
assessment that the reason Greg Maddux is such a great pitcher is that he has
remarkable control of his pitches, but we would not be able to make that assess-
ment by ourselves. Our concept of baseball pitching is not at the same level of
complexity as a professional player’s is. We would have to accept such a statement
on faith (and accepting something “on faith” is another form of life that plays a
role in our lives—we all accept some things “on faith”).
5. Forms of life do not exist by themselves, but are caught up with others in the
“pattern” of life:
Seeing life as a weave, this pattern (pretence, say) is not always complete
and is varied in a multiplicity of ways. But we, in our conceptual world, keep
on seeing the same, recurring with variations. That is how our concepts
take it. For concepts are not for use on a single occasion.
And one pattern in the weave is interwoven with many others. [Z §§568–
569]
6. Forms of life are best taught by demonstration and coaching, not by explanation,
explicit rule-following or by using deﬁnitions.
7. Forms of life arise in our lives through repetition:
We judge an action according to its background within human life. . . The
background is the bustle of life. And our concept points to something
within this bustle.
. . . it is the very concept “bustle” that brings about this indeﬁniteness. For
a bustle only comes about through constant repetition. And there is no
deﬁnite starting point for “constant repetition.” [RPP II §§624, 625, and
626]
8. We cannot isolate a single form of life from others. They are often dependent
on other forms of life for their structure and signiﬁcance. The game of baseball
is similar to and dependent upon the earlier game of cricket. Baseball is also
dependent on abilities learned in other activities, such as hand–eye coordination,
or the ability to run fast. The notion of “fairness” in a game is a broad concept

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
129
that goes beyond any single game, and takes on a character set by society at large.
Our riding a bicycle is dependent on a number of prior abilities: the ability to ﬁnd
one’s way about; the ability to understand and follow trafﬁc regulations; the ability
to balance oneself and master a physical skill; the ability to make minor repairs
of the bike; the ability to drive the bike so as not to endanger others; etc. Most
children do not learn to ride a two-wheel bicycle until they are 7 or 8 years old,
at least. It usually takes this long for children to master the related physical and
mental abilities that are needed as a foundation for riding a bicycle.
Language Games and Forms of Life
Having roughly sketched the notions of language game and form of life, we should now
look at how they are related. Wittgenstein brieﬂy states what this relation is:
. . . we don’t start from certain words, but from certain occasions or activities. [LC
p. 3]
Language Games are embedded in, and dependent on, the recurring “occasions or activi-
ties” which make up our “natural history.”
. . . the term “language-game” is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the
speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life. [PI §23]
Zabeeh writes:
The introduction of actions into the fabric of language links the idea of “language
game” with the idea of “form of life.”188
But if we go back to Wittgenstein’s discussion of language games we ﬁnd that the activity
that surrounds a language game is part of the language game itself:
I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is
woven, the “language-game” [PI §7]
If Wittgenstein included the “actions into which it is woven” as part of the language game,
then why does he introduce the notion of forms of life? It seems that the forms of life are
already part of the deﬁnition of language games. It is true that these two notions are related
and, in a sense, overlapping, but there are forms of life that do not have any direct relation
to language use. I am speaking of the nonlinguistic, or prelinguistic activities that do not
require language for their execution. Activities such as the physical act of eating, throwing
an object, walking, jumping, sleeping, driving a car, hammering a nail, tightening a bolt,
whistling, etc. These activities can be named and referred to, and the use of language
can take place during their execution, but they do not require language to execute and
can be performed entirely without recourse to language at all. These forms of life can be
contrasted with the activities that are part of language games and require language for
their execution. Activities such as giving orders, describing the appearance of an object,

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
singing, making a joke, requesting, thanking, cursing, greeting, etc.189 These actions are
generally not possible without language.
Baker and Hacker bring out this relation between forms of life and language games:
The notion of a form of life is connected with that of a language-game, but is more
general and elemental. A form of life is a given unjustiﬁed and unjustiﬁable pattern
of human activity (part of human natural history [PI §25]). It rests upon, but is not
identical with, very general pervasive facts of nature. It consists of shared natural
and linguistic responses, of broad agreement in deﬁnitions and in judgements, and
of corresponding behavior.
Alanguageperforcecontainsmoveswhicharenotjustiﬁedbyreferencetoanything,
but are simply accepted as appropriate, as a common pattern of linguistic behavior
by reference to which other moves are justiﬁed. Equally, any cognitive claims, as
well as any doubts, occur within a framework of propositions that are not doubted,
that belong to the frame of reference of the system of knowledge (propositions
of the Weltbild). Training in what counts as justiﬁcation, acceptance of undoubted
truths of the world-picture, is acculturation in the form of life of the community.190
Language can only be understood within the context of related activities—both with those
which require language and those that do not. As Zabeeh points out:
The idea that a language game is something that “plays a particular role in our
human life” (though vaguely) is important. Since even at this early stage it connects
language games with speciﬁable activities and in an oblique way shows that a mere
use of words (or even use of a grammatically well-formed expression in the absence
of certain actions, such as informing or warning or referring) is not to be considered
as playing a language game.191
It is easy to see the relation between language games and activities that require language
to execute, such as “telling a story.” One must not only have something to say, one must
tell it at an appropriate time, to an appropriate audience, and formulate the story using
one’s knowledge of certain real or ﬁctitious events that may be relevant, among many other
things. All of these are largely linguistic activities that are relevant to the task at hand. But
how does language relate to something that is nonlinguistic, such as “eating?” It’s clear,
of course, that one can eat without any recourse to language, but there are times when one
might say something that would not be understandable outside the activity of eating. For
example, we might ask “How do you like the salad?,” or we might say, “Please pass the
salmon,” or , “I am full,” or instruct someone, “Use the small fork for salad and the large
one next to it for your entr´ee.” These linguistic events are not required for us to perform
the act of eating, but they don’t make much sense unless we are eating (or are referring
to the act of eating) when we hear or utter them. Were these statements to be uttered
outside the context of eating, they would be seen as odd, perhaps even incomprehensible.
189These examples are from PI §23.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
131
A grammatically correct sentence just won’t make sense in the wrong context (imagine
getting on a bus and telling the driver, “I am full.”). Zabeeh makes a further point: the
language games and the activities in which they are embedded are not just any ones,
but are the language games and activities which play a role or have importance, in our
life. For people who have never seen or played Mah Jong, any language game that is
linked to the playing of Mah Jong would be incomprehensible. One could not understand
a statement that such-and-such “is similar to Mah Jong.” Having a role in one’s life can
also determine the degree to which a language game is understood. For example, if one
were asked, “Isn’t that a good chess move?,” the meaning of this statement might depend
on the listener’s chess playing ability. A casual, amateur’s concept of a “good move in
chess” would be much different than a grand master’s concept of a “good move in chess.”
It is useful to distinguish between those forms of life that play a role in everyone’s life,
like eating, and those that play a role in our lives by our choice, such as pitching baseballs
or driving a car—the latter activities being characterized by varying levels of ability and
commitment.
Language and forms of life work together to put a structure on our use of language and our
participation in regular human activities, respectively. But they do it without providing a
list of rules which we must refer to, consciously or unconsciously, in order to speak or act
appropriately. Instead, they provide a kind of natural structure that encourages us to act or
speak in certain ways, but not in others. A list of rules would not be enough to describe
or deﬁne language games and forms of life because in most cases rules cannot completely
describe how an activity is to be performed. To be adequate a formal system of rules
must be embedded in a broader context which limits the coverage or applicability of those
rules. Otherwise, one doesn’t know when to stop applying the rules, and new rules are
needed for every possible exception which comes up. There will be no end to such rules
if they are not bounded by human activities, conventions and training. One might object
that the rule system for a game such as chess is complete and sufﬁcient to regulate every
possible legal move. But these rules are embedded in a context that excludes many possible
moves and chess-like activities without our even thinking about them (in the way that we
would think of a chess move). We don’t need a chess rule that says that a player must
not knowingly cheat, or eat the chess pieces, or turn off the lights during his opponent’s
moves, or threaten him if he declares “checkmate,” etc. These actions are considered
bizarre or inappropriate because they are excluded by the forms of life or activities in
which the playing of chess games is embedded. The rules of chess don’t have to address
these situations at all. It is true that a “complete” set of rules for chess, such as those used
to regulate international competition, might include a rule stipulating that a player may not
interfere with his opponent. But the rules assume that a typical player would know what
“interference” means, and he does, not by virtue of the rules of chess, but because he is
a normal social individual familiar by experience with the natural conventions of playing
competitive board games. Wittgenstein comments:
How should we have to imagine a complete list of rules for the employment of
a word?—What do we mean by a complete list of rules for the employment of a
piece in chess? Couldn’t we always construct doubtful cases, in which the normal
list of rules does not decide? Think e.g. of such a question as: how to determine
who moved last, if a doubt is raised about the reliability of the players’ memories?

132
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The regulation of trafﬁc in the streets permits and forbids certain actions on the part
of drivers and pedestrians; but it does not attempt to guide the totality of their move-
ments by prescription. And it would be senseless to talk of an “ideal” ordering of
trafﬁc which should do that; in the ﬁrst place we should have no idea what to imag-
ine as this ideal. If someone wants to make trafﬁc regulations stricter on some point
or other, that does not mean that he wants to approximate to such an ideal. [Z §440]
Because language games and forms of life are not constituted or regulated by explicit rules
they cannot be deﬁned or explained in the same way that more rule-governed systems such
as chess or mathematics can be. Language games and forms of life are primarily demon-
strated or shown; they cannot be described or deﬁned in any complete way. Explanations
and deﬁnitions may help, but only if the student already understands a similar language
game or form of life and can himself ﬁll in what is left out by the explanations. Wittgenstein
comments:
For remember that in general we don’t use language according to strict rules—it
hasn’t been taught us by means of strict rules either. We, in our discussions on the
other hand, constantly compare language with a calculus proceeding according to
exact rules.
This is a very one-sided way of looking at language. In practice we rarely use
language as such a calculus. For not only do we not think of the rules of usage—
of deﬁnitions, etc.—while using language, but when we are asked to give such
rules, in most cases we aren’t able to do so. We are unable clearly to circumscribe
the concepts we use; not because we don’t know their real deﬁnition, but because
there is no real “deﬁnition” to them. To suppose that there must be would be like
supposing that whenever children play with a ball they play a game according to
strict rules. [BB p. 25]
Wittgenstein continues:
But what does a game look like that is everywhere bounded by rules? Whose rules
never let a doubt creep in, but stop up all the cracks where it might?—Can’t we
imagine a rule determining the application of a rule, and a doubt which it removes—
and so on? [PI §84]
Wittgenstein’s question is, of course, rhetorical. A game, in the normal sense of the word,
cannot be “everywhere bounded by rules,” and neither can language games (this kind
of analogy is what Wittgenstein hoped to convey by calling these linguistic activities
“games”).What, in addition to rules, do you need to learn or master a practice? Wittgenstein
is quite clear about this:
Not only rules, but also examples are needed for establishing a practice. Our rules
leave loopholes open, and the practice has to speak for itself.192 [OC §139]
192P. Ziff pointed out that people frequently confuse rules with “regularities”:
I am concerned with regularities: I am not concerned with rules. Rules have virtually nothing
to do with speaking or understanding a natural language . . .

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
133
The Big Picture: Philosophy of Language and Metaphor
In the course of his discussions of language in Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein
draws a number of analogies between language and other activities:
The grammar of language use is like the dynamic structure of a game.
Words are like tools, and language use is similar to tool use.
Words have a uniform appearance in different contexts, but their uses may be as
different as the uses of the handles in a locomotive.
Language as a city.
Language as a labyrinth.
The background in which we accept propositions is like a mythology, or a river-
bed.
Each of the above metaphors is useful for understanding Wittgenstein’s philosophy of
language, and each illuminates different aspects of language. But what strikes us is how
divergent the use of these analogies is from the usual way of doing analytic philosophy. It
may appear at ﬁrst that Wittgenstein is merely being eloquent in using these metaphors—
as Mark Twain once remarked, they are included “for general literary gorgeousness.”193
Perhaps Wittgenstein could make his points in more analytic ways without recourse to
. . . those who speak of “the rules of language” . . . are I believe misusing the word “rule.”..it
is possible to misuse a screwdriver, to use it correctly or incorrectly: are there rules for using
screwdrivers? This too would be of use of the word. . .
. . . A rule is easily confused with a regularity. This may be one reason why rules have been
thought to be of some importance in the use of language. By ﬁrst confusing “George regularly
walks to school.” with “As a rule, George walks to school.” and then confusing that with “The
rule is that George walks to school.,” one can easily arrive at the view that rules have a
signiﬁcant part to play in language.
A general model relating rules to proﬁciency in any human task (of which language use is one) has been proposed
by Bert and Stuart Dreyfus in their Mind Over Machine: The Power of Human Intuition and Expertise in
the Era of the Computer [The Free Press, Macmillan, NY, 1986]. They identify ﬁve stages in the acquisition
of proﬁciency: Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competence, Proﬁciency and Expert. Only Novices and Advanced
Beginners follow rules to any signiﬁcant extent. Those who are proﬁcient or expert at some skill—either cognitive
or physical—do not follow rules, nor can they articulate rules to explain their expertise in any kind of complete
way. Their expertise consists of “know-how” or intuition rather than skills which could be precisely described.
Wittgenstein would say that the expert has an ability to perform a particular task well rather than an ability
to follow a set of rules. In fact, attempts to model expert behavior usually produce only novice or beginner’s
performance. As Pascal wrote in 1670:
Mathematical formalizers wish to treat matters of intuition mathematically, and make them-
selves ridiculous. . . The Mind. . . does it tacitly, naturally, and without technical rules. [Pens´ees
(1670). Quoted in Dreyfus and Dreyfus, p. 16]
The intuitively applied know-how of the expert would appear in what Csikszentmihaly calls a “ﬂow-state” (vid.
footnote 237). Csikszentmihaly describes the ﬂow-state as being “rule-bound” (q.v.), But he must use the phrase
loosely because his deﬁnition of a ﬂow-state would exclude the conscious following of rules.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
analogies. But Wittgenstein introduced these metaphors for a number of reasons. In the ﬁrst
place, metaphors are a form of showing or demonstrating a concept, rather than explaining
or deﬁning it. This dovetails nicely with Wittgenstein’s assertion that explanations do not
teach as well as having a concept demonstrated to us. The second reason for his use of
metaphor is that by focusing on metaphors Wittgenstein has shifted our attention away
from internal or mental events and towards entities and processes that are external to us
and available for us all to observe and consider. When we try to understand what language
is, our natural tendency is to see it as springing from some mental event. But if we say
that language is like a city, or like a game, then we have shifted our focus to entities that
are available for us all to examine and discuss. When we argue over the precise nature of
mental events, we are on slippery ground since there is no common basis for comparing
the mental event of one person with the mental event of another, except in the most general
or adumbrative way. This redirection of our attention from internal events to external ones
is a major component in Wittgenstein’s analysis, and marks a signiﬁcant difference with
the traditional methods of analytic philosophy. Malcolm comments:
When we are philosophically perplexed about the nature of belief, or remembering,
or meaning something, our natural tendency is to search inwardly into our minds
or brains. That is a dead-end. Wittgenstein teaches us to look outwardly—to take
note of how a difference in circumstances changes the meaning of what we say and
do. Giving an account of this role of circumstances is not easy. In everyday life
we learn to use the psychological terms in various circumstances. But the needs of
everyday life do not require us to learn to describe those circumstances.194
Even though these metaphors can stand on their own, it will be useful to point out some
of the implications these analogies have for language. We begin with a common metaphor
for language that is more misleading than helpful, a metaphor that Wittgenstein, in his
early work, believed reﬂected the way that language worked.
Language as a Kind of Calculus
In one of his early works, Philosophical Grammar, Wittgenstein writes:
Theunderstandingoflanguage,asofagame,seemslikeabackgroundagainstwhich
a particular sentence acquires meaning.—But this understanding, the knowledge
of the language, isn’t a conscious state that accompanies the sentences of the lan-
guage. Not even if one of its consequences is such a state. It’s much more like the
understanding or mastery of a calculus, something like the ability to multiply.195
194Malcolm. Nothing is Hidden: Wittgenstein’s Criticism of his Early Thought, p. 191. Blackwell, Oxford,
1986. Wittgenstein comments:
One learns the word “think”, that is, its use, under certain circumstances, which, however,
one does not learn to describe.
But I can teach a person the use of the word! For a description of those circumstances is not
needed for that.
I just teach him the word under particular circumstances. [Z §§114–116]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
135
We can see that Wittgenstein’s early view of language was that it operates in much the
same way that calculus does—language use consists of the mastery of a set of symbols,
their operational deﬁnitions, and rules that govern their uses and transformations. But we
can see the change in Wittgenstein’s view later in the Blue and Brown Books:
For remember that in general we don’t use language according to strict rules—it
hasn’t been taught us by means of strict rules either. We, in our discussions on the
other hand, constantly compare language with a calculus proceeding according to
exact rules.
This is a very one-sided way of looking at language. In practice we very rarely use
language as such a calculus. For not only do we not think of the rules of usage—
of deﬁnitions, etc.—while using language, but when we are asked to give such
rules, in most cases we aren’t able to do so. We are unable clearly to circumscribe
the concepts we use; not because we don’t know their real deﬁnition, but because
there is no real “deﬁnition” to them. To suppose that there must be would be like
supposing that whenever children play with a ball they play a game according to
strict rules. [BB p. 25]
Here Wittgenstein shows that since calculus consists entirely of strict, general rules and
precise deﬁnitions, that it cannot be a model for language. Language has neither strict
rules that govern every usage nor precise deﬁnitions of its terms (symbols). It is true that
we do sometimes use language with precise rules and fairly clear deﬁnitions, such as when
we say:
John rides the horse.
and not,
John ride the horse.
The second sentence is a clear violation of the simple and precise rule that subject and verb
must agree in number. This rule is context free in the sense that it holds for any subject and
any verb. Further, the nouns, “John” and “horse,” are semantically unproblematic. This
simple example may lead us to believe that all language operates in more or less the same
way, that complex sentences are merely variations on these simple ones in the same way
that complex formulae are variations or combinations of simple ones. But if we recollect
Wittgenstein’s criticism of Augustine’s view of language, we are reminded that language
is not used in just one way.
What Wittgenstein argued against is the notion that language, like calculus, is composed
of a precise set of rules that prescribe all possible transformations within the system, and
operate on terms or symbols that are clearly deﬁned. Further, these transformations would
be context free. But this view of language has some problems. In the ﬁrst place, while we
have rules of grammar that govern the agreement between sentence parts, these rules do
not tell us why some apparently grammatically correct sentences don’t make sense:
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously
This example was used by the linguist Noam Chomsky to demonstrate the independence
of meaning and grammar—that grammatically correct sentences can still be meaningless.

136
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The independence of grammar, or syntax, and meaning is an essential characteristic of
calculus, and insures that (1) Changes in the meaning of the symbols do not change the
valid rules that operate on them, and (2) The context in which the symbols are used does
not change the meaning of those symbols once they have been deﬁned. In his early thought,
Wittgenstein himself believed this to be the case. In the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
he states:
In logical syntax the meaning of a sign should never play a rˆole. It must be possible
to establish logical syntax without mentioning the meaning of a sign. . . [TLP 3.33]
But this was one view which he was later to revise in his distinction between surface
grammar and depth grammar. The independence of grammar and meaning in language
only holds if we look at surface grammar—the syntax of statements—not if we look at
depth grammar—the context and circumstances in which they are used. But Wittgenstein
felt that surface grammar does not tell us enough about what makes a sentence meaningful
or not. What was important in this regard is the depth grammar of a sentence, how the
sentence relates to the circumstances and context—the language game—in which it is
appropriate. In Wittgenstein’s depth grammar, grammar and meaning are not separate,
and Chomsky’s sentence is both meaningless and ungrammatical.196 We can see this if we
do a Wittgensteinean analysis of the depth grammar of Chomsky’s sentence:
If “colorless green” is really a color, then it should be all right to use it in other sentences,
for example:
The artist went to the art-supply store and bought some colorless green paint.
My new car is colorless green.
These, clearly, are odd sentences. In fact, they are so deviant that one cannot even guess
what the speaker might mean by them, so they can’t even be interpreted as metaphorical.
“Colorless green” has a logical structure like (¬ A • A)—where we can approximate the
phrase in question by making A = “color.” This leaves us with a contradiction. A descrip-
tion such as “colorless green” is not an empirical mistake, but a logical or grammatical one.
No amount of empirical investigation could result in a conﬁrmation or disconﬁrmation of
“colorless green.”
There are other problems with the depth grammar of Chomsky’s statement. It makes an
implicit claim that “ideas” can have colors. If this is the case, then the following sentences
should be alright:
My ideas are mostly red or blue. . .
I had a green idea this morning, but later had a purple one.
Again, these sentences are very odd, so odd that it would be difﬁcult to even guess what
the speaker might mean. One might make a case that ideas, like moods, can be “blue” or
196J. Ellis makes the same point by insisting that grammar and lexicon (meaning) are not separate. [Language,
Thought, and Logic. Northwestern University Press, Evanston, IL, 1993. See chapter 4 “Grammar”.]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
137
“black,”butthisisstretchingthepoint,andisclearlynotwhatChomskymeant.Continuing,
if “ideas sleep,” then we should be able to say some other things about them like:
His idea slept soundly all night.
His idea woke up.
My best ideas require little sleep.
Again, we are forced into accepting an intolerable bizarreness if we want to hold on to the
claim that Chomsky’s sentence is grammatical. A similar analysis can be made of “sleep
furiously.”
A Wittgensteinean analysis of the depth grammar of Chomsky’s sentence demonstrates
that meaning and grammar are not independent in natural language, and that language,
therefore, does not operate like a kind of calculus.197
A further argument against the independence of meaning and grammar came with George
Lakoff’s examples of how the grammatical soundness of a sentence can depend on the
context in which it is uttered:
John is a Republican, and Bill is a crook, too.
A Democrat might not see anything wrong with the above statement, while a Republican
might consider it not just wrong, but, according to Lakoff, ungrammatical.198 Another
aspect of calculus that Wittgenstein, at one time, believed it shared with language is
the notion of the “deﬁnite sense” of words or terms. The logic of calculus requires that
once the meaning of a term is established, no change in the context in which it is used
will cause a change in the meaning of that term. This means that the terms in calculus
have a “deﬁnite sense.” Wittgenstein believed, early in his career, that the words used
in propositional statements had a deﬁnite sense too—that they had a meaning that was
independent of context. In the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, language consisted of
deﬁnite propositions which represented or, more accurately, pictured, reality and could
be seen as either true or false. These propositions, as long as they were grammatically
well formed, had the same sense regardless of the context in which they were uttered or
written. Wittgenstein was later not only to reject the idea of a deﬁnite sense of a sentence
or proposition, saying that they did not have ﬁxed meanings, but he was also to insist that
context is an important determinant of the sense of language:
The words “I am here” have sense only in certain contexts, and not when I say them
to someone who is sitting in front of me and sees me clearly—and not because they
197The phrase structure grammars which were a natural outgrowth of Chomsky’s emphasis on the autonomy of
grammar represent the extreme to which these syntactic structures can be taken. Eco’s semiotics was an attempt
to shore up the failing syntactic model of language by introducing semantic and pragmatic components to the
grammatical representation of language. Eco, et al., spent a lot of effort trying to keep Chomsky’s view of
language aﬂoat, but it’s hard to build a sound ediﬁce on such weak foundations.
198The example was given in personal communication at the University of California, Berkeley. Lakoff gives a
more detailed argument against the autonomy of grammar in his Irregularity in Syntax. [Holt, Rinehart and
Winston, 1970]

138
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
are superﬂuous, but because their meaning is not determined by the situation, yet
stands in need of such determination.199 [PI §348]
As Malcolm comments:
A shrug of the shoulders is a familiar gesture that means something different
in different situations. It does not have a ﬁxed meaning. Neither does a familiar
sentence.
Wittgenstein’s repudiation of the assumption that the sense of language is inde-
pendent of the circumstances of life in which the language is used, is perhaps the
single most important aspect of his break with what he calls in the preface of the
Investigations “my old way of thinking.”200
Another problem with the calculus-model of language is that calculus has no clear con-
nection with behavior and common human activities the way that language does. Calculus
does not spring from the things that we do, except in a very restrictive sense.201 As we
will argue soon, Wittgenstein believed that language was grounded in instinctive behavior,
it was not, at its most basic level, built on conscious, or what we might call “rational,”
thought. Calculus, in contrast, is nothing if it is not conscious. A further difference be-
tween the calculus model of language and the later model of language that Wittgenstein
developed is that, according to Baker and Hacker, “It is false that a complete understanding
of language is derivable from knowledge of deﬁnitions and forms alone.”202 Again, the
problem is that language requires context to complete its sense, while calculus is rela-
tively context-free in this regard. The clearest example of this is to consider the meaning
of sentences, or utterances that are exactly the same in construction but are presented in
different circumstances. Take Wittgenstein’s example (from above):
I am here.
199O.K. Bouwsma recalled the following incident which occurred in August of 1949 when he visited Wittgenstein
who was the guest of Norman Malcolm at Cornell University:
When does a sentence make sense? There was talk about Moore’s sentence: “I am here.” Moore
thought one could decide that “I am here” made sense, by some introspective questioning.
Does it make sense? Now, of course, all these sentences have a use. The question is whether,
if one shouted such a sentence under any circumstances whatever, it has a use. I can see what
moves[philosopherMax]Black.Blacksaysthatthesentenceobviouslyhasnoparticularpoint,
nobody gets any information by it. But if it were a question in a True-False questionnaire, you
would clearly answer “True” or “Yes” if asked: Yes or No. [Wittgenstein] said: “No! No! Of
course not, etc. Context determines use.” [Bouwsma. Wittgenstein: Conversations 1949—

We can imagine it uttered by someone to his blind friend whom he is meeting in a crowded
place (and who would recognize his voice and know who the “I” is without a name
accompanying it). Or we could imagine it as a response over the telephone:
When will you get here?
I am here.
In the ﬁrst case, the sentence could mean that the speaker is physically near his blind friend
and might be stated in order to give him reassurance. But in the second case, it could mean
that the speaker has arrived in the city of his friend, is probably early, and has called
his friend to get directions to his house. The knowledge of the surface grammar and the
possible meanings of the individual words in this sentence could not provide us with these
two disparate meanings of the sentence. For Wittgenstein, thinking of language as a kind of
calculus puts us on “the very brink of a misunderstanding.” This misunderstanding not only
misleads us about how language actually works, but it does something far more insidious:
it leads us to believe that an ideal logical language—a language that is “better. . . than our
everyday language”—is somehow possible. As Wittgenstein writes:
. . . in philosophy we often compare the use of words with games and calculi which
have ﬁxed rules, but cannot say that someone who is using language must be playing
such a game.—But if you say that our languages only approximate to such a calculi
you are standing on the very brink of a misunderstanding. For then it may look
as if what we were talking about were an ideal language. As if our logic were, so
to speak, a logic for a vacuum.—Whereas logic does not treat of language—or of
thought—in the sense in which natural science treats of a natural phenomenon, and
the most that can be said is that we construct ideal languages. But here the word
“ideal” is liable to mislead, for it sounds as if these languages were better, more
perfect, than our everyday language; and as if it took the logical to shew [sic] people
at last what a correct sentence looked like.
All this, however, can only appear in the right light when one has attained greater
clarity about the concepts of understanding, meaning, and thinking. For it will then
also become clear what can lead us (and did lead me) to think that if anyone utters
a sentence and means or understands it he is operating a calculus according to
deﬁnite rules.203 [PI §81]
The Structure of Language is Like the Dynamic Structure of a Game
Since we have already discussed the metaphorical connection between language and
games, we will not repeat that analysis here. But there is a variant of the language:game
analogy that bears some scrutiny—the idea that language is like a chess game.
Language and Chess
The question “What is a word really?” is analogous to “What is a piece in chess?”
[PI §108]
203Note, in the last sentence, Wittgenstein’s admission that he, too, once saw language in this misleading way
(in his early work TLP).

140
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Here Wittgenstein begins by drawing an analogy between a word and a chess piece. It
is clear that it would be odd to ask what a chess piece means—it doesn’t really mean
anything. But it does make sense to ask how the chess piece is used. The same is true of
words. But there is something rather subtle about this analogy, namely, it makes no sense
to talk about a chess piece outside the context of a chess game.
Wittgenstein makes the analogy between chess and language in other places in his writing:
How should we counter someone who told us that with him understanding was an
inner process?—How should we counter him if he said that with him knowing how
to play chess was an inner process?—We should say that when we want to know if
he can play chess we aren’t interested in anything that goes on inside him.—And if
he replies that this is in fact just what we are interested in, that is, we are interested
in whether he can play chess—then we shall have to draw his attention to the criteria
which would demonstrate his capacity, and on the other hand to the criteria for the
“inner states.” [PI p. 181]
How should we have to imagine a complete list of rules for the employment of
a word?—What do we mean by a complete list of rules for the employment of a
piece in chess? Couldn’t we always construct doubtful cases, in which the normal
list of rules does not decide? Think, e.g., of such a question as: how to determine
who moved last, if a doubt is raised about the reliability of the player’s memories?
[Z §440]
The chess analogy brings out two important similarities with language: ﬁrst, chess pieces
have no use/meaning outside of a chess game. The dependence of chess pieces on the
context of a chess game is the same as the dependence of words on speciﬁc language
games and circumstances. Words taken out of their respective language games may be
misleading or nonsensical. Secondly, like chess, the use of language is not governed by a
“complete list of rules.” For chess and language, what resolves the ambiguities of usage
left by what rules there may be, are training and relevant circumstances (Forms of Life).
Words are Like Tools and Language Use is Like Tool Use
Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a
rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.—The functions of words are as diverse as
the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.)204 [PI §11]
204PI §11. Compare with BB pp. 67–68:
Thinkofwordsasinstrumentscharacterizedbytheiruse,andthenthinkoftheuseofahammer,
the use of a chisel, the use of a square, of a glue pot, and of glue. (Also, all that we say here can
be understood only if one understands that a great variety of games is played with the sentences
of our language: giving and obeying orders; asking questions and answering them; describing
an event; telling a ﬁctitious story; telling a joke; describing an immediate experience; making
conjectures about events in the physical world; making scientiﬁc hypotheses and theories;
greeting someone, etc. etc.).
Baker and Hacker make the point that Germans consider “glue,” “nails,” and “screws” tools, though we usually
do not. [An Analytical Commentary on Wittgestein’s Philosophical Investigations, vol. 1, p. 37. University
of Chicago Press, 1985.]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
141
Wittgenstein’s analogy between words and tools is one of the central insights of his phi-
losophy of language. In the quotation above, the tool analogy reiterates his criticism of
Augustine’s view of language—that words function in only one way. But if words are like
tools, and language use is like tool use, then we only need look at the diversity of tool
usage to see that a similar diversity exists in language. Think of a hammer. It can be used
to drive nails, to break or crack something solid (like chipping ﬂakes off a stone so it will
ﬁt in a particular place), to weight something down on a windy day (like holding down a
schematic while a carpenter works outside on a project), to tap a water pipe to free it of an
obstruction, to hammer something together or apart, to tap a chisel when cutting wood, or
even to fend off an attacker. Or, think of a screwdriver which can be used to turn screws,
to try open the lid of a can of paint, to hold a door open when wedged underneath it, to
apply small dabs of glue to speciﬁc places, to make a crude hole in something or to use as
a spindle to wind string or wire on.
Another point of the tool analogy is to show how misleading questions about the meaning
of a word can be. Tools have uses but they do not really have meanings. This is evident in
a sentence such as:
What is the meaning of a hammer?
While this might be good poetry, it is not good semantic analysis, and the oddity of this
statement, when taken literally in everyday discourse, should be obvious to us all—in fact,
it isn’t at all clear what would even count as an answer to it. Wittgenstein’s reply to such
a question might be:
Why do you put it so oddly?205 [PI §60]
Further, if we insist that tools do have “a” meaning, then we are forced into trying to ﬁnd
some single, essential “meaning” that applies to all hammers, or all screwdrivers, etc. The
same holds for words: like tools, they do not have meanings, in any strict sense, but they
certainly do have uses.
Earlier, Wittgenstein makes a related point:
“I set the brake up by connecting up rod and lever.”—Yes, given the whole of the rest
of the mechanism. Only in conjunction with that is it a brake-lever, and separated
from its support it is not even a lever; it may be anything, or nothing. [PI §6]
The brake is a kind of tool, and the example here is meant to show how superﬁcial some
kinds of analysis can be. We look at the brake and think that it works by “connecting up
rod and lever.” But this is not how the brake really works. For it to work, it requires the
“whole of the rest of the mechanism.” The analogy to language is clear: we often think
that language works because of some superﬁcial relationships—relationships like syntax,
transformational grammar, or the proximity of other words. But such analysis misses the
205This was his reply to the question of asking for the “broomstick and the brush which is ﬁtted onto it” instead
of asking for the “broom” [PI §60]. This was discussed in the previous section Wittgenstein’s Categories:
Family Resemblances.

142
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
“whole of the rest of the mechanism.” What is the “rest of the mechanism” for language?
The “rest of the mechanism” is the context in which language works: the activities, cir-
cumstances, and practices in which language is used, and the background and training of
the speakers or hearers. We can see this relationship even in Wittgenstein’s simple “slab”
language (see the discussion in the previous section The “Builder’s Language”). The
context which enables the slab language to work consists of the activities of construction
and the experience of the workers. Without that context, the “rest of the mechanism” for
language is missing and nothing in the syntax of the language can tell us what “Slab!”
means. That is, there are too many possibilities for what it might mean, and no criteria for
choosing the right one. Wittgenstein continues with his tool analogy:
Of course, what confuses us is the uniform appearance of words when we hear them
spoken or meet them in script and print. For their application is not presented to us
so clearly. . .
It is like looking into the cabin of a locomotive. We see handles all looking more
or less alike (Naturally, since they are all supposed to be handled.). But one is the
handle of a crank which can be moved continuously (it regulates the opening of a
valve); another is a the handle of a switch, which has only two effective positions,
it is either off or on; a third is the handle of a brake-lever, the harder one pulls on
it, the harder it brakes; a fourth, the handle of a pump; it has an effect only so long
as it is moved to and fro.206 [PI §§ 11–12]
The fact that the same word appears in different contexts and has different uses gives us the
impression that there must be something that is the same that follows the word from context
to context—some general, essential meaning. Words are like the handles in a locomotive.
But if we grab the handles and manipulate them we ﬁnd that although they all look the
same, their functions are quite diverse. Wittgenstein considered one of the problems with
the analysis of language is that we consider only one or a few examples. It would be like
reaching into the locomotive, manipulating one or two handles, then assuming that all
other handles work the same way because they look similar. To understand how handles
that look alike really work we have to try a number of them. It is the same way with
language: we have a tendency to look at one or two examples of a word’s usage and infer
that all instances of that word work the same way. Consider the following examples of the
word “pitch”:
“Randy Johnson is the best pitcher in professional baseball.”
“The brewer pitched the yeast.”
“The sales pitch was very convincing.”
Seeing these examples, one might be tempted to say that the word “pitch” in the different
sentences has some semantic similarities: they all involve “throwing something” (albeit
in the sales example, the “sales pitch” is metaphorical). It may be tempting to think that
206In the complete quotation, Wittgenstein included a pointed observation about philosophy:
Of course, what confuses us is the uniform appearance of words when we hear them spoken or
meet them in script and print. For their application is not presented to us so clearly. Especially
when we are doing philosophy!.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
143
it might be possible, in theory, to come up with a deﬁnition of “pitch” that would be the
same in each of the above three cases. But if we take John Wisdom’s suggestion that when
we use Wittgenstein’s analysis of “depth grammar” we need to come up,” . . . not with one
case but cases and cases” (vid. See quotation at footnote 177), we can see immediately
that a uniform, essential meaning for “pitch” that applies to all usages is impossible:
“They pitched their tent.”
“They all pitched in.”
“He covered his roof with pitch.”
“The armies fought a pitched battle.”
“He sang at a much higher pitch than before.”
“Faldo pitched the ball within two feet of the cup.”
“The falcon soared to a very high pitch.”
“The roof was sharply pitched.”
“He drank all the water in the pitcher.”
“They worked at a feverish pitch.”
Even a cursory examination of these additional examples leads us to the ineluctable
conclusion that no uniform deﬁnition could possibly exist that would tell you what the
meanings of these instances of “pitch” would be in each case. At best, there are “families”
of meanings for “pitch”: some are similar to each other, and some are quite divergent.
This brings up an important point, namely, that if there are many meanings or uses for the
word “pitch,” how can you sort through them to ﬁnd the right one that is presented to you?
The answer is simple: you don’t have to go through all the possible meanings every time
you want to use the word “pitch,” the particular meaning or usage of “pitch” comes with
the circumstances in which it is used. For example, if you are watching a baseball game
with someone and he makes a remark about the “pitcher” you know immediately what he
means. There is no need to ask yourself, “Does he mean a ‘baseball pitcher’, or a ‘pitcher
of water’?” The context gives us the particular meaning of the word that is relevant to the
situation at hand. The need to sift through various meanings of the words we use would
simply be too time-consuming to do, because if we do it for one word, like “pitch,” we
would have to do it for all the words in all our sentences, not just words like “pitch,” the
nouns and verbs, but all the adjectives, adverbs and words like “the,” “and,” “is,” which can
be used variously too.207 The only thing similar in the uses of “pitch” in different contexts
is the spelling of the word. You could have made up a word different than “pitch” for any
of these contexts and the difference would be of no consequence whatsoever.208 That is,
207It is hard to see how “the,” “and,” etc. can be used differently, but they can: consider, “the car” versus “the
pain in my leg.” In both, “the” identiﬁes something speciﬁc, but the speciﬁcity of a “car” is quite different than
the speciﬁcity of a “pain.” One way to see this is to ask how you would verify statements like “I saw the car
you were talking about,” as opposed to “I see you still have the pain in your leg.” The deﬁnite article (“the”)
works differently in each case. (“The” can also create an illusion of existence, and, as such, is one of Ryle’s
“systematically misleading expressions” (vid. discussion of Ryle in footnote 102). Similar cases can be made for
the different uses of “and” and “is” (“he bought an apple and an orange” versus “he is a scholar and a gentleman.”
Or, speaking about the various uses of “is”: consider, “the car is black” versus “his mood is black.” Again, the
differences in use here can be seen if we look at how we might verify each statement.)
208In fact, it is not uncommon for ordinary words to be exchanged for other words in certain contexts. The
individual who enlists in the Navy and arrives at his new ship will at ﬁrst ﬁnd it confusing that “stairs” are
called “ladders,” “ﬂoors” called “decks”, “ceilings” called “overheads,” “doors” called “hatches,” “ropes” called

144
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
it is of no consequence whether it happened that we say, “He covered his roof with pitch,”
or we say, “He covered his roof with veebleﬂetzer.” The meaning of the word “pitch” in
this context is in no way dependent on any of the other uses of the word “pitch” in other
contexts. As a result, the word that comes to be used in this context is largely accidental.
Before the ﬁrst utterance of a sentence with this usage, it was probably no more likely for
it to contain “pitch” than it was to contain any other word.
Context is often strong enough to make the right reference without the word even men-
tioned. For example, we are watching a baseball game as the pitcher strikes out three
batters in a row. My friend turns to me and says, “Boy, he’s got good stuff!” Is this an
ambiguous phrase? Not in normal circumstances. “He” is obviously the pitcher who is
now pitching, and his “good stuff” refers loosely to the high quality of his pitches, as
evidenced by his three consecutive strikeouts. Yet if my friend utters the same sentence
as we stand in line at the concession stand between innings, I might not know what he’s
talking about.209
“lines,” “rooms” called “spaces,” “left” called “port,” “right” called “starboard,” etc. There are also many Naval
descriptions, such as “abaft the beam,” or “on the port quarter,” that have no simple equivalent in “civilian”
English. Perfectly ordinary sentences can sound like a foreign language. Herman Wouk brings this out in his
WW II novel The Caine Mutiny: The central ﬁgure in the story is Willie Keith who reports aboard the ship
the USS Caine with no prior shipboard experience. Willie listens to a sailor explaining why a mine-sweeping
maneuver had been done badly:
“Sir, it was my fault,” spoke up the boatswain’s mate. He began an alibi that sounded to
Willie [Keith] like this: “The port bandersnatch got fouled in the starboard rath when we
tried to galumph the cutting cable so as not to trip the snozzle again. I had to unshackle the
doppelganger and bend on two snarks instead so we could launch in a hurry.” “Well,” said
De Vriess, “couldn’t you have vorpaled the sillabub or taken a turn on the chortlewort? That
way the jaxo would be clear of the varse and you could forget about dudelsak. It would have
done the same thing.”
“Yes, sir,” said Bellison. “That might work okay. I’ll try it tomorrow.”
Willie’s heart sank. He was certain that if he sailed a hundred years on the Caine he would
understand such abracadabra no better than he did at the moment.[H. Wouk. The Caine
Mutiny, p. 102. Doubleday, Garden City, NY, 1951.]
209As another example of the variability of use/meaning, consider the word “line”:
“Make him toe the line.”
“He put his reputation on the line.”
“Give me the bottom line on the investment.”
“The batter lined out to third.”
“I can’t follow his line of thought.”
“He took a pencil and drew a line.”
“The soldiers stood in line.”
“The coat was lined with down.”
“Don’t give me that old line!”
“The actor forgot his lines.”
“The ocean liner weighed anchor and put out to sea.”
“The ﬁshing line was hopelessly tangled.”
“The store carried a line of small tools.”

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
145
But suppose that we can get a uniform, essential meaning or deﬁnition of a word that is
similar in all contexts. Would this work for us? Wittgenstein is clear in his answer:
When we say: “Every word in language signiﬁes something” we have so far said
nothing whatever; unless we have explained exactly what distinction we wish to
make. [PI §13]
Wittgenstein quickly follows this example with a similar one that purports to give a single
essential meaning of the word “tools”:
Imagine someone’s saying: “All tools serve to modify something. Thus the hammer
modiﬁes the position of the nail, the saw the shape of the board, and so on.”—And
what is modiﬁed by the rule, the glue-pot, the nails?—“Our knowledge of a thing’s
length. The temperature of the glue, and the solidity of the box.”—Would anything
be gained by this assimilation of expressions? [PI §14]
Again, Wittgenstein’s question is rhetorical, nothing would be gained by such a general
deﬁnition.210 This is easy to see if we look at the use of the word “tools” and not the
deﬁnition. If we try to use the general deﬁnition of the word “tool” we ﬁnd that it is really
not good for anything. What we can use, though, is a family of examples of how the word
“tools” is actually employed.
The desire to ﬁnd essential deﬁnitions of words that work in a variety of contexts
is part of our “craving for generality” and our “contemptuous attitude towards the
particular case.” [BB p. 18]
Wittgenstein continues to elaborate on the tool-like nature of language usage:
It will be possible to say : In language (8) [the “expansion” of the “Builder’s
language”] we have different kinds of word. For the functions of the word “slab”
and the word “block” are more alike than those of “slab” and “d.” But how we
group words into kinds will depend on the aim of the classiﬁcation,—and on our
own inclination.
Thinkofthedifferentpointsof view from which one can classify tools or chess-men.
[PI §17]
Once again, Wittgenstein lets us draw the conclusion he wants; and if we think of the differ-
ent points of view or uses for tools, it is not too hard to come up with other classiﬁcations:
“His actions were completely out of line.”
“Drop me a line when you get there.”
210Pitkin comments: “First, [Wittgenstein] seeks to show. . . that the grasping of deﬁnitions or essences or
universals cannot explain what needs to be explained. And, second, he tries to show that even the mastery
of deﬁnitions, principles, generalities, depends ultimately on our natural human capacities and inclinations,
which do not themselves have any further explanation. . . The kind of training that is necessary to the acquisition
of a natural language, Wittgenstein says, requires ‘inducing the child to go on’ in the same way, in new and
different cases. This is different from training for repetition, which ‘is not meant to apply to anything but the
examples given’; this teaching ‘points beyond’ the examples given.” [Wittgenstein and Justice, p. 45. University
of California Press, Berkeley, 1972. Pitkin quotes from PI §208.]

What Wittgenstein wants us to see is that there is no obvious way that we can break up
reality into categories (this is the main point of Nominalism). The possible categories we
might use to group familiar things (here, tools) are simply too numerous for one category
to be obviously more prominent than others. Categories imply a “point of view,” and
the number of “points of view” are too many for there to be a single obvious one. Even
botanical classiﬁcations, which are often seen as providing the only possible categories for
plants, presuppose a scientiﬁc framework or point of view. For example, we could classify
trees by their scientiﬁc categories: oaks, maples, hawthornes, mulberries, pines, etc. as
we normally do. But if we get away from our scientiﬁc categories, we can see a number
of other ways of categorizing trees: we could imagine that the trees could be arranged
by their utility, as an aborigine population might see them. They might break them up
into groups by whether they are good for making bows, building houses, making arrows,
building boats or making ﬁrewood. Trees could also be categorized by their size, with
all large trees being in one category and smaller ones in other categories. We could even
imagine trees being classiﬁed by their aesthetic appearance, with trees that we consider in
the same category, for example, oaks, grouped differently by aesthetic taste. Perhaps there
could be a medicinal classiﬁcation of trees, or a geographical one (pines North of the
Great Lakes being called one thing, and pines South of the Great Lakes called something
else). Again, as we start looking at lots of cases, we see that the scientiﬁc categories of
our own world are not the only possible ones. Some classiﬁcations that are used by other
cultures may be inconceivable from our point of view: As Whorf pointed out:
The Hopi actually call insect, airplane, and aviator all by the same word, and feel
no difﬁculty about it.211
Further, it is not just that we can group things in various ways, but even what we call a
“thing” may differ from situation to situation. If it is the case that things can be categorized
in a number of different ways, and that these ways of categorizing them are not obvious
when they are investigated empirically, then the natural question is: how do we know what
category a thing belongs to?

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
147
Language as a City
Wittgenstein draws another analogy with language: He describes language as a “city” or
“town”212:
Do not be troubled by the fact that languages (2) [the “Builder’s Language”] and
(8) [the extended “Builder’s Language”] consist only of orders. If you want to
say that this shews them to be incomplete, ask yourself whether our language is
complete:—whether it was so before the symbolism of chemistry and the notation
of the inﬁnitesimal calculus were incorporated in it; for these are, so to speak,
suburbs of our language (And how many houses or streets does it take before a
town begins to be a town?). Our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of
little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from
various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight,
regular streets and uniform houses. [PI §18]
The ﬁrst comparison between language and a city is brought up to show that the artiﬁcial
languages that Wittgenstein discusses earlier—(2) The “builder’s language,” and (8), the
“extended builder’s language”—are complete languages. There is no question about these
simple languages being complete or incomplete in the same way that there is no question
about “how many houses or streets does it take before a town begins to be a town” [supra]?
Why is this important? If we thought of these simple languages as being incomplete, then
we would miss what really makes them work, and we could write them off as simplistic or
elliptical. Some would say that the way these simple languages work is somehow “hidden”
from us—that these languages are simple versions of more complex utterances which we
can refer to unconsciously in order to disambiguate the simple languages Wittgenstein de-
scribed. But Wittgenstein says that incompleteness is not the problem here for the simple
reason that these languages are not incomplete. They are complete because they are used
perfectly well by the builder to accomplish his tasks. The reason for our misapprehension
is our faulty notion of how language works. If we believe that words “stand for meaning”
in some way, then we tend to think that when the words, by themselves, seem insufﬁcient
or ambiguous then “meaning” can only be completed or clariﬁed by additional words.
For Wittgenstein, this is wrong. What compensates for the perceived ambiguities or in-
completeness in language is not more words, but context,circumstances and the training
or experience of the speakers. While the single word “Slab!” may be ambiguous to the
philosopher, it is not ambiguous to the builder. The ambiguity that the philosopher sees
is not a function of the sentence, but a function of his point of view. He has taken the
“Builder’s Language” out of context, out of the “stream of life”:
For words have meaning only in the stream of life. [RPP II §687]
If the philosopher had worked with the builder, he would no doubt come to see the
“Builder’s Language” as working perfectly well—nothing about the meaning of the sen-
tence “Slab!” is hidden or elliptical. The criterion for the “completeness” of a sentence is
212Robert J. Ackermann makes ample use of Wittgenstein’s metaphor of language being like a city. He argues
that Wittgenstein’s two philosophies of language exempliﬁed in the early TLP and the much later PI, are not
two distinct philosophies but are like two neighborhoods in the same city. [Wittgenstein’s City. The University
of Massachusetts Press, Amherst, 1988]

148
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
whether you can accomplish what you want with it. If a sentence, no matter how abbre-
viated, works, then, a fortiori, it is complete—if a number of houses, no matter how few,
functions as a town, it is a town.
Wittgenstein continues in a similar vein:
But why should I not. . . have called the sentence “Bring me a slab” a lengthening
of the sentence “Slab!?”—Because if you shout “Slab!’” you really mean: “Bring
me a slab.”—But how do you do this: how do you mean that while you say “Slab!?”
Do you say the unshortened sentence to yourself? And why should I translate the
call “Slab!” into a different expression in order to say what someone means by it?
And if they mean the same thing—why should I not say: “When he says ‘Slab!’
he means ‘Slab!’?” Again, if you can mean “Bring me the slab,” why should you
not be able to mean “Slab!?”—But when I call “Slab!,” then what I want is, that he
should bring me a slab!—Certainly, but does “wanting this” consist in thinking in
some form or other a different sentence from the one you utter? [PI §19]
To argue that “Slab!” is merely a shortened version of “Bring me a slab!” is to fall again
into the trap that when the meaning of a sentence appears to be incomplete, what it needs
is more words, or more explanation. But the surface dissimilarity of “Slab!” and “Bring
me a slab!” dissolves if we focus on the use of the sentences rather than their meaning. The
mistaken inference about these two sentences is just the opposite of a previous mistaken
inference that we have already discussed. Before, Wittgenstein noted that the similar
appearance of words or sentences in different contexts leads us to the incorrect conclusion
that there is some underlying essential “meaning” that runs through all the occurrences
of words that appear in disparate contexts. Here, Wittgenstein is looking at the other
side of that question, namely, that words or sentences that look different are really the
same—that “Slab!” and “Bring me a slab!” have the same function or meaning, with the
longer statement being a more “complete” and less ambiguous version of the shorter one.
Wittgenstein asks, rhetorically:
But doesn’t the fact that sentences have the same sense consist in their having the
same use? [PI §20]
What makes “Slab!” a “complete” sentence for the builder is not that it refers in some
unconscious way to a longer “more complete” sentence, but that it is used in an appropriate
context and circumstances that enable it to be understood. One could even imagine that
in the terse, direct vernacular of the builder, the “complete” sentence “Bring me a slab!”
might be thought odd or even an insult, implying that the hearer does not understand
the simple command “Slab!.” What Wittgenstein doesn’t say, but which, I believe, agrees
with his view of the “completeness” of statements, is that even if we wanted to accept
“Bring me a slab!” as a more “complete” version of “Slab!,” what grounds would we have
for ending our analysis with “Bring me a slab!” as the ﬁnal “complete” version of the
command “Slab!?” Couldn’t we also say that “Bring me a slab!” is merely a shortened
version of:
“Bring me a slab, right now!”

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
149
And this, in turn, could be a shortened version of:
“Bring me a slab, right now, and be careful not to drop it!”
And, again, we can “lengthen” the sentence to:
“Bring me a slab, right now. Be careful not to drop it, and put it next to my feet.”
This list could be extended indeﬁnitely by, for example, providing detailed instructions
about how to pick a slab up and set it down, among other things. Of course there could be
circumstances where you might want to use such sentences, but they would not be “longer”
versions of “Slab!” within the context of the “Builder’s Language.” The reason why they
are not longer versions of “Slab!” is that the command “Slab!” works perfectly well for
the builder. No more clariﬁcation is necessary. This leads Wittgenstein to the important
conclusion:
On the one hand it is clear that every sentence in our language “is in order as
it is.” That is to say, we are not striving after an ideal, as if our ordinary vague
sentences had not yet got a quite unexceptionable sense, and a perfect language
awaited construction by us.—On the other hand it seems clear that where there
is sense there must be perfect order.—So there must be perfect order even in the
vaguest sentence.213 [PI §98]
Wittgenstein might have found some sympathy with Walt Whitman’s poetry:
There was never any more inception than there is now,
213Wittgenstein’s rejection of the need for an “ideal language” for doing philosophy, is one of his later positions
that has its roots in the Tractatus (TLP). In his early work, this was a rejection of Frege’s and Russell’s claim
that ordinary language is not adequate for doing analytic philosophy, as they saw it. Hacker writes:
Frege and Russell had held that natural languages are. . . only partial guides to the objective
logical structures of reality (of a third realm, or of the world), whereas the Tractatus had
argued that every possible language must, as a condition of sense, mirror (on analysis) the
logical forms of what is represented. [P.M.S. Hacker. Wittgenstein’s Place in Twentieth-
Century Analytic Philosophy, p. 80. Blackwell, Oxford, 1996.]
What natural language lacked, according to Russell and Frege, is a strict determinacy of sense. Since, language,
they believed, was primarily used to assert facts, and facts either are, or are not the case, then language, too,
should only make statements that are clearly true or false. They felt that the vagueness or indeterminacy of
natural language was an inherent ﬂaw that made it an inadequate tool for philosophical inquiry. This could only
be remedied by the construction of an ideal logical language—a goal of both Frege and Russell. Wittgenstein
rejected the need for an ideal language because he felt that the indeterminacy of ordinary language was just a
superﬁcial phenomenon that could be corrected by philosophical analysis. Later, in PI, he rejected this, preferring
to see determinacy of sense not as a function of language itself, but as a function of particular language games
and/or forms of life. That is, there is no absolute standard of determinacy in language, as Russell and Frege
thought, but determinacy of language varied according to the activities and circumstances of its use. The goal of
language use is not to adhere to some exalted standard of determinacy, but to have just enough determinacy of
sense that it can be used appropriately, the circumstances of its use will clear up any remaining indeterminacy.
Meaning in language is not determined by uncovering the essential unchanging meanings of words, but by
looking at how those words are actually used.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
...
To elaborate is no avail, learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is so.214
Wittgenstein is not saying that there are no ambiguous sentences in ordinary language,
or that some explanation might not be necessary for some statements. He is saying that
if a sentence makes sense, it must be complete, no matter how ambiguous it may seem
when considered apart from the context and circumstances in which it usually occurs.
And if we want to know how a brief, seemingly ambiguous sentence can convey a precise
idea, we should not look for some other more “complete” sentence, we should look at
how the circumstances and context of the sentence give it sense. To use one of Chomsky’s
examples, the single sentence “Flying planes can be dangerous” can be interpreted in two
different ways and seems in need of further clariﬁcation. But this ambiguity occurs when
we take the statement out of its context, out of the “stream of life” in which it makes sense.
If we see a friend climbing out of the cockpit of a small plane that he has just landed,
and his face appears ashen and his hands trembling as he says, “Flying planes can be
dangerous!” we know exactly what he means.215
214W. Whitman. “Song of Myself,” The Oxford Book of American Verse, part 3, p. 281.Oxford University
Press, NY, 1950. Edited by F.O. Matthiessen.
215Chomsky used examples like this to make a much more profound claim, viz., that sentences that are structurally
ambiguous such as “Flying planes can be dangerous” or “I saw a grizzly bear driving to Los Angeles” must
have a “deep structure” that we can access to resolve the ambiguity. Yet, as Wittgenstein showed us, if we look
to some “inner” or “deep” mental mechanism to resolve ambiguity in language, we are looking for the answer
in the wrong place. The resolution of this kind of ambiguity comes from the context and circumstances of the
utterance not its purported “deep structure.” As Baker and Hacker comment on this form of “ambiguity”:
The “ability to detect ambiguity” allegedly forces us to attribute knowledge of a grammatical
theory to children or adults. Two examples are notorious: (i) “Visiting aunts can be boring.” Of
this two modern linguists claim “in order to assign an unambiguous semantic interpretation
to the sentence, we need access to information contained in its deep structure.”**
(ii) “They are ﬂying planes.” . . . If I ask “Where are Tom and Dick?” and am told “They are
ﬂying planes,” I do not need any system of internal formulae or mental representation to know
that the answer means that Tom and Dick (the well-known aces of the 25th Squadron) are
ﬂying their Harriers (or, in a different context, that Tom and Dick those well-known model-
plane builders are currently ﬂying their latest models in the park). Similarly, if I am walking
through the aeronautics museum and the guide points at some full-scale model planes, saying
“These are only reconstructed planes, but those over there, they are ﬂying planes,” I do not
need any deep structures to enable me to understand. Pari passu, if “Visiting aunts can be
boring” is a response to “That old bag, Aunt Doris, is visiting us tomorrow,” or a response to
“What a bore, I have to visit my Aunt Doris tomorrow,” it wears its meaning on its face, not
in its “depth grammar,” let alone in any “mental representations” thereof.
Not only does an ordinary speaker not need to have recourse (“deep in his unconscious mind”)
to hidden rules of transformational-generative grammar, but he could not do so if he needed

151
The Implications of the “Language as City” Metaphor
The analogy between language and a city is a very powerful and suggestive metaphor, and
it may be useful to bring out some of the implications this has for the study of language.
Let’s ﬁrst take another look at the quotation in which Wittgenstein makes this analogy:
(And how many houses or streets does it take before a town begins to be a town?)
Our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares,
of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and
this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight, regular streets and
uniform houses. [PI §18]
One of the ﬁrst characteristics of a city to come to mind is that it is constantly changing:
new parts of the city are being constructed and older parts are falling into disuse. Some
parts of the city are no longer used at all. This metaphor brings out the same dynamic
quality in language. Our language changes on a continual basis in a number of ways. We
often borrow words and phrases from other languages, such as the expressions “savior
faire” or “gung ho.” We also create entirely new sets of words and phrases to deal with new
activities, such as manned space missions (“Apollo,” “power up,” “space shuttle,” “lunar
module,” and “launch pad”). These newer words and phrases occur in concert with the
growth of a new activity, and are most frequently seen in scientiﬁc disciplines since these
are the activities that are currently changing the most. Before World War II we had no words
to express such things as “DNA,” “hovercraft,” “fusion reaction,” “gene splicing,” “data
base management,” “telecommunications,” “throughput,” “mini-, micro-, or mainframe
computer,” etc. Sixty years ago we had no words to express these concepts because we had
yet to begin the activities that they emerged from. We have also completely abandoned
some words and phrases, like we abandon old neighborhoods, primarily because they refer
to activities in disuse. The practices of phrenology and bloodletting being cases here, and,
more recently, the references to “cold fusion.” Another dynamic that encourages change in
our language is the use of slang. Each generation seems to develop its own vernacular: what
was “cool!” “far out!” or “groovy!” for the “beat generation,” of the 1950’s, is now “rad!”
or “fresh!” to today’s youth. It is also the case that there may be parts of Wittgenstein’s
city that are temporary, and some parts that are more enduring (slang being a case of the
former and religious texts being a case of the latter).
One of the most interesting, but subtle, characteristics of the city is that it creates right-
of-ways through certain parts of the city and obstacles to other passageways. One cannot
go anywhere one might want to, buildings or other ediﬁces may be in our way. Language
In some sense, Wittgenstein (and his advocates such as Baker and Hacker) offers a reversal of the old joke about
the man looking for his lost keys at night under a street lamp—“Where did you lose your keys?” a passerby asks.
“Down the street,” he replies. “Why aren’t you looking for the keys where you lost them?” asks the passerby.
“Because the light is much better here,” he replies. This has been offered as an example of how misleading
it may be to use quantitative modelling methods to investigate mental processes—using the “brighter clarity”
of quantitative modelling to represent “darker” less well-understood mental phenomena. Yet, with Chomsky’s
insistence that we should be looking at “deep structures” if we want to understand meaning, and not at the actual
usage of language, as Wittgenstein insists, he moves our investigation of language away from the “bright light”
of usage (what Chomsky calls “performance”) and towards the “darkness” of the “deep mental structures” (what
Chomsky terms “competence”). Chomsky is looking for the proverbial black cat in a dark room, never asking
the more fundamental question of whether the cat is there at all.

152
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
operates in the same manner. We are not free to talk in any way that we might want to.
There are “roads” and “passageways” that inﬂuence how we speak. This does not mean
that we can never speak in certain ways, but that we are encouraged to speak in other
speciﬁc ways. Language is a not a product of thought, as we noted earlier (see the previous
section “Language and Thought”), but the vehicle of thought:
When I think in language, there aren’t “meanings” going through my mind in
addition to the verbal expressions: the language is itself the vehicle of thought.
[PI §329]
Another parallel between language and a city is that the city functions with few, if any,
explicit rules that govern how it works. It has been noted that New York City contains, at
any given time, only enough food to feed its inhabitants for a few days. Yet it never runs
out of food, even during trucking or railroad strikes or after severe snow storms. But there
is no set of rules that governs the supply of food for New York City, and it is doubtful that
such a set of rules could be set up to control all eventualities. In the same way, language is
a large, enormously complex system that deﬁes complete regulation by explicit rules. It is
true that language has rules of syntax, and New York has a variety of civil regulations. But
neither the rules of syntax nor the city regulations completely determine the functioning
of language or the city, respectively. The activities of supply and demand in New York
attain a kind of equilibrium in which the demand for goods and services balances with the
available supply. This balance can shift in favor of supply or demand in certain situations,
but it always seems to come back into balance when things return to normal:
The regulation of trafﬁc in the streets permits and forbids certain actions on the
part of drivers and pedestrians; but it does not attempt to guide the totality of their
movements by prescription. And it would be senseless to talk of an “ideal” ordering
of trafﬁc which should do that; in the ﬁrst place we should have no idea what to
imagine as this ideal. If someone wants to make trafﬁc regulations stricter on some
point or other, that does not mean that he wants to approximate to such an ideal.216
[Z §440]
Language, too, has no ideal ordering that it aspires to, but like the supply of food in
New York, language achieves a kind of balance as a result of competing forces. The
individual who originally described the balancing of competing forces in language was
George Kingsley Zipf.217 Like Wittgenstein, Zipf believed that the words and phrases in
our language are like tools, and these tools are used to perform linguistic acts:
216The idea that rules cannot govern all the actions in a process is a recurrent theme in Wittgenstein’s work. See
also PI §84 at the end of the previous section Language Games and Forms of Life.
217Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort. Hafner, NY, 1965 (facsimile of the 1949 edition). Zipf
found that if you tabulate the occurrences of all words in a sufﬁciently large text and rank them according to
their frequencies, with the most frequent word holding rank number one, then the product of the rank of any
given word and its frequency will approximate a constant. If you plot this distribution on logarithmic scales by
decreasing frequency, the plot will be linear with a slope of −1. Further, because of the slope of-1 the x and y
intercepts will be the same (x = rank, y = frequency), meaning that the total number of different words in the
vocabulary being studied will be equal to the frequency of the most frequently occurring word (the word of rank
one). Zipf’s Law was observed in such diverse linguistic samples as, James Joyce’s novel Ulysses, newspapers,
Homer’s Iliad, Chinese, German, Plains Cree, Dakota, Aelfric’s Old English, etc., so there is little doubt that it
describes a fairly well-established statistical regularity of natural language.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
153
. . . wordsaretoolsthatareusedtoconveymeaningsinordertoachieveobjectives.218
The balance in language is a product of the “competition” between tools (i.e., words) and
jobs (i.e., the linguistic tasks that we use words to complete).
The problem of tools-and-jobs is the same as the problem of means and ends, or of
instruments (or agents) and objectives. We shall adopt the homelier term, tools-and-
jobs, to emphasize the common-place nature of the problem under discussion.219
But this tools-and-jobs nature of language is fundamentally reciprocal. It means that tools
require certain kinds of jobs in order to be used, and jobs require certain kinds of tools in
order for the job to be accomplished. This reciprocity has the function of ﬁtting available
tools to required jobs, and, at the same time, altering the jobs to be performed to ﬁt the
functions of available tools.
. . . there are two aspects of the economy of the tools-and-jobs in question. In the
ﬁrst place, there is the economy of tools. In the second place, there is the econ-
omy of jobs. . . To clarify the signiﬁcance of these two economies, let us illustrate
them brieﬂy in terms of carpentry tools and carpentry jobs. . . We all know from
experience that when a person has a carpentry job to be performed, he directly or
indirectly seeks a set of carpentry tools to perform the job. And, in general, we
may say that jobs seek tools. . . But what is often overlooked is the equally obvious
fact that when a person owns a set of carpentry tools, then, roughly speaking, he
directly or indirectly seeks a carpentry job for his tools to perform. Thus, we may
say that tools seek jobs.220
Zipf calls this the “reciprocal economy of matching tools to jobs and jobs to tools.” In
linguistic behavior, this reciprocal economy manifests itself in the following way: The
words and phrases in language are, of course, the tools, and the expression of meaning is
the job for which these words/tools can be used. For example, if I want to ask someone
what time it is, I have certain words and phrases that are more-or-less suitable for this
task (consider how the use of conventional English as opposed to the use of slang can
be used to accomplish this job differently). We are so ﬂuent in our native language that
this reciprocal economy of tools and jobs is not readily apparent. But we can see this
reciprocity more clearly if we imagine ourselves in Germany with only a modest ability
to speak German. Here, the job is the same—to ﬁnd out what time it is. But suppose we
don’t know the standard phrase, “Wieviel Uhr ist es?” Here, we must ﬁt our limited tools
(the few German words and phrases we know) to the task of ﬁnding out what time it is. We
may be able to get by with the contrived phrase “Was ist die Uhr?”—“What is the hour?”
(accompanied, perhaps, by appropriate gestures), but if we look closely at this situation,
we can see another change taking place. Because our command of German is minimal, we
would not comprehend a detailed or precise explanation of the time such as, “Es ist zehn
nach halb acht.” We can only comprehend such phrases as “Sieben Uhr”—“Seven o’clock”
or, “Ungef¨ar Sieben Uhr”—“About seven o’clock.” Thus, the limited tools available to

154
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
use have changed our task at hand from ﬁnding out exactly what time it is to ﬁnding out
roughly what time it is—this is how tools and jobs can inﬂuence each other.
The important thing to remember is that, like our example of supplying food to New York
City, we don’t need codiﬁed rules to bring about the vocabulary balance in language. In
fact there is no set of rules that could do this. All we need to do is to use language to
accomplish our day-to-day tasks. A natural equilibrium will result. Another aspect that
cities share with language concerns how we ﬁnd our way about. In a city, we learn to ﬁnd
our way about through our active involvement in our daily affairs. Sometimes we might
need a map to ﬁnd our way, but often we just ask or travel with others in the course of our
activities and come to know our way about in a casual rather than formal way. By “casual”
I do not mean “imprecise” or “haphazard.” I merely mean that when we learn our way
about there is no systematic attempt to learn our way apart from the activities we engage
in. We simply participate in the activities we want to engage in and, in so doing, we learn
how to get around the city. These activities could be for business or pleasure. It is also the
case that we often can ﬁnd our way about without being able to explain to someone how
to do it in any kind of precise way. While we can show another person how to get from
A to B by driving him and pointing out landmarks along the way, we are often at a loss
to give detailed instructions about exactly what route to take without actually taking them
along that route. Wittgenstein comments:
It could very well be imagined that someone knows his way around a city perfectly,
i.e., would conﬁdently ﬁnd the shortest way from any place in it to any other,—and
yet would be quite incompetent to draw a map of the city. That, as soon as he tries,
he produces nothing that is not completely wrong. [Z §121]
Language is quite similar. We learn much of our native language by using it in day-to-day
activities rather than learning it in a formal way apart from the activities that we might
use it in. Of course, we do have formal classes in English grammar and composition,
but we usually do not take such classes until we have been in school for a number of
years and already have a good ability to use our language—that is, we can get things
done with it. The formal classes merely reﬁne an ability that already exists, and there
are many individuals who achieve a remarkable ability with language with little or no
formal training. Our understanding of cities and language comes about primarily through
interaction and participation. We can read a tourist guide to New York, but we won’t really
know our way about until we stay there for some time. Wittgenstein comments:
People who always keep asking “why?” resemble tourists who read Baedeker while
they stand before a building and through reading about the building’s history, ori-
gins, and so on are kept from seeing it.221
A ﬁnal similarity between a city and language is that we can know a lot about getting
around a city without knowing every single place in the city. There may be large areas
221Wittgenstein. Unpublished Manuscript number 163 (1941). Cornell University Library. Wittgenstein’s low
estimation for “tourists” is reﬂected in his reply to a student who wanted to attend some of Wittgenstein’s
lectures, but not all of them: “My lectures are not for tourists.” [Malcolm. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir,
p. 28. Oxford University Press, London, 1958.]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
155
that we will never see. We won’t see them because our activities don’t take us there. In
language, there will always be expressions that we don’t understand. There will even be
entire “neighborhoods” of language we will never know (a “neighborhood” of language
would be like a dialect of language or the jargon of a scientiﬁc ﬁeld, e.g., the language of
chemistry or electron microscopy, or other “suburbs” of our language (see PI §18 at the
beginning of the section Language as a City (supra)). Like cities these “neighborhoods”
of language do not have distinct borders; words and phrases can be used in common with
a variety of activities.
Language as a Labyrinth
Closely related to Wittgenstein’s notion of language as a city is his metaphor of language
as a “labyrinth.”
Language is a labyrinth of paths. You approach from one side and know your way
about; you approach the same place from another side and no longer know your
way about. [PI 203]
An unknown city can seems like a labyrinth or maze so Wittgenstein’s metaphor seems
to be just a variation on the “city” metaphor. But there is one aspect of a labyrinth that is
important to language but does not ﬁt with the city metaphor. This would be the concept
of a labyrinth that was constructed as a labyrinth, and is not part of a city. In this kind of
labyrinth, all the passageways look the same so it is difﬁcult to know just where you are
(whereas, in a city most of the “passageways,” i.e., streets, looks different). This is like
the case in language where the words look the same in different contexts so we assume
that they are all used in the same way:
Of course, what confuses us is the uniform appearance of words when we hear them
spoken or meet them in script and print. For their application is not presented to us
so clearly. [PI §11]
This is a minor point, but much of Wittgenstein’s philosophy comes as a succession of
such minor points, things, as he said, that are important but which slip by our observation
because they are so familiar.
Reality and Myth: The Background of Reality on Which Language is Based
is Like a Mythology, and its Structure is Like a Riverbed
Propositions,thatis,assertionsoffact,holdanimportantplacein20thcenturyphilosophy’s
analytic tradition and its philosophy of language. It is through factual assertions that we
can describe what we know to be the case. Some would even claim that the only role of
philosophy is to examine the truth or falsity of factual propositions. Wittgenstein, in his
early work, TLP, took as one of his primary tasks to deﬁne the boundaries of factual
discourse.
Once we know that something is the case, it does not change readily—this is the inherited
background of facts that we accept, much of it on faith. Wittgenstein comments:

156
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
But I did not get my picture of the world by satisfying myself of its correctness;
nor do I have it because I am satisﬁed of its correctness. No; it is the inherited
background against which I distinguish between true and false.
The propositions describing this world-picture might be part of a kind of mythology.
And their role is like that of rules of a game; and the game can be learned purely
practically, without learning any explicit rules.
It might be imagined that some propositions, of the form of empirical proposi-
tions, were hardened and functioned as channels for such empirical propositions
as were not hardened by ﬂuid; and that this relation altered with time, in that ﬂuid
propositions hardened, and hard ones became ﬂuid.
The mythology may change back into a state of ﬂux, the river-bed of thoughts may
shift. But I distinguish between the movement of the waters on the river-bed and the
shift of the bed itself; though there is not a sharp division of the one from the other.
Butifsomeoneweretosay“Sologictooisanempiricalscience”hewouldbewrong.
Yet this is right: the same proposition may get treated at one time as something to
test by experience, at another as a rule of testing.
And the bank of that river consists partly of hard rock, subject to no alteration or
only to an imperceptible one, partly of sand, which now in one place now in another
gets washed away, or deposited.222 [OC §§94–99]
Wittgenstein is not talking about all language here, but only that part of our language which
deals with propositions—statements of fact. These propositions express the “inherited
background” of facts that make up our view of the world. It is important to point out that
the propositions we are able to articulate cannot completely describe our “picture of the
world.” It is also the case that much of what we take as our “inherited background” by
which we can judge the truth and falsity of factual statements was not given to us in the
form of propositions. This factual background came to us, in part, through training—as a
parent shows the child the names of things—and, in part, through our involved experience
and interaction with our surroundings (e.g., our discovery of how painful bee stings are).
Nevertheless,Wittgenstein’spointiswell-taken.Ifourdescriptionsoffactsareconstrained,
not just by the “facts” of our world, but in some cases by the formal structure of those
propositions, then we can see that the inﬂuence of the formal structure of language (here,
propositions), like a riverbed, inﬂuences what we can assert and not assert, and that, in
turn, can inﬂuence how we think. Wittgenstein speaks of this as a kind of “mythology.”
He is not saying that our empirical world is a myth, but that, like a myth, parts of it are
presented to us as the truth, even though we cannot verify them. We must remember that
what we take as a mythology, such as the myths of the ancient Greeks and Romans, was
taken by them to be a picture of their factual world. The pantheon of gods that the Greeks
222This statement stands in marked contrast to statements that Wittgenstein made in his earlier philosophy: “It
isn’t possible to believe something for which you cannot imagine some kind of veriﬁcation” [Philosophical
Remarks, §59. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1975]. Since Wittgenstein does not explicitly address his
earlier views in his later writings it is sometimes difﬁcult for the reader to see exactly where he has revised his
earlier thought.

believed in were not seen to be products of their imagination, they were considered to be
just as valid a part of their reality as their everyday affairs were.
In the above quotation, Wittgenstein is saying that the propositions that we can formulate
in language have a kind of structure like the riverbed of a river. In many cases, this
propositional structure or grammar has a ﬁxed nature to it, like the “hard rock” bank of
a river, but in others it consists of “sand” and may shift easily. Propositions that have a
“hard rock” structure are like:
Alain is 6 feet tall.
Chris weighs 190 pounds.
Bill planted a copper-beech tree in his yard.
The Lufthansa ﬂight from Vienna is scheduled to arrive at 5:00 pm.
These kinds of propositions have a comfortable familiarity about them. Most importantly,
they have clear criteria for testing their truthfulness—we can measure Alain’s height and
Chris’ weight, we can look at the trees Bill has planted, we can call the airport and ask when
the Lufthansa ﬂight is due. One can be as certain about the truth of these propositions as
one can for just about anything, and there are not too many ways for an adult of reasonable
intelligence to go wrong here. These are all propositions that we can conﬁrm personally.
Another kind of proposition that we generally accept but which is beyond our personal
ability to establish is:
Pluto is the farthest planet from the sun in our solar system.
Most of us would accept this proposition as being true, but it is certainly beyond the ability
of the average person to conﬁrm directly. This is a proposition that we accept on authority
and is part our background knowledge, even though it does not affect us personally.
But sometimes we think that the “hard rock” of propositions like those above exists for
other propositions when it doesn’t. We have already given an example of this phenomenon,
but it bears repeating. When we ask:
What is the height of Mt. Hood?
we have a clear sense of what would count as an answer, and we would go about ﬁnding
it in much the way that we would answer questions of similar form or grammar. But what
about the question:
What is the meaning of a word?
On the surface, this looks like the previous question. Consequently, it’s easy to assume that
it has the same “hard rock” structure as that question. If this were so, then like “the height
of Mt. Hood,” the “meaning of a word” should not only be easily answerable, but there
should be just one clear answer to the question. But this is not the case. Not only is there
not a clear answer for our “meaning” question, but even answers that are deemed true at
one point in time, are subject to continual debate and revision. The “meaning of a word”
lies on a bed of shifting sand rather than a ﬁrmament of hard rock. To carry Wittgenstein’s

158
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
river metaphor to its conclusion, we might say that looking at the “surface grammar” of
the above two questions is like looking at the surface of a river and not questioning the
nature of the riverbed on which it ﬂows. In the “river” metaphor we are again led back to
Wittgenstein’s distinction between “surface grammar” and “depth grammar,” with “depth
grammar” being concerned with the “riverbed.” The most common way for the “hard
rock” riverbed of propositions to change is after the introduction of new technology. The
way that we see the facts of our world can change dramatically. The electron microscope
lets us see detail that simply was not possible before; telephones let us talk to friends and
relatives who were unreachable, conversationally, except by physical journey; the Hubble
telescope enables us to see farther in the universe than we have ever seen before, etc.
Wittgenstein unwittingly gives us another example:
Suppose some adult had told a child that he had been on the moon. The child tells
me the story, and I say it was only a joke, the man hadn’t been on the moon; no
one has ever been on the moon; the moon is a long way off and it is impossible to
climb up there or ﬂy there. [OC §106]
Now, of course, the child could have talked to Neil Armstrong—the hard rock riverbed
has shifted here creating a possibility that never existed before. In another case we could
compare the following statements:
Jack is over 6 feet tall.
Jack is a paranoid schizophrenic.
Sometimes, the “riverbed” for the same proposition can vary signiﬁcantly. The ﬁrst as-
sertion (above) is fairly clear, but the second may or may not make a clear distinction,
depending on the backgrounds of those who might utter it. Some psychiatrists insist that
paranoid schizophrenia, or at least extreme cases of it, is a real “sickness” and can be
diagnosed with relative conﬁdence. So to them the second statement and the ﬁrst both
have clear grounds for asserting. But for other psychiatrists the diagnosis of paranoid
schizophrenia is not nearly as clear-cut. Psychiatrist Thomas Szasz sees the distinction
between the mentally ﬁt and the mentally ill as a false dichotomy. They are of no more
consequence than other human characteristics that distinguish us (such as the differences
between shy individuals and extroverts). For Szasz, we feel a need to deﬁne and treat those
we label as psychotics, not because they are “sick” but because we ﬁnd their behavior
upsetting. Interestingly, like Wittgenstein, Szasz sees the failure to distinguish physical
from mental illness as a consequence of language:
The upshot of this psychiatric-psychoanalytic “revolution” is that, today, it is con-
sidered shamefully uncivilized and na¨ıvely unscientiﬁc to treat a person who acts
or appears sick as if he were not sick. We now “know” and “realize” that such a
person is sick; that he is obviously sick; that he is mentally sick.
But this view rests on a serious, albeit simple, error: it rests on mistaking or confus-
ing what is real with what is imitation; literal meaning with metaphorical meaning;
medicine with morals. In other words, I maintain that mental illness is a metaphor-
ical disease: that bodily illness stands in the same relation to mental illness as a
defective television set stands to a bad television program. Of course, the word

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
159
“sick” is often used metaphorically. We call jokes “sick,” economies “sick,” some-
times even the whole world “sick”; but only when we call minds “sick” do we
systematically mistake and strategically misinterpret metaphor for fact—and send
for the doctor to “cure” the “illness.” It is as if a television viewer were to send for
a television repairman because he dislikes the program he sees on the screen.223
According to Malcolm, this metaphorical mistake is echoed in the philosophy of mind:
What is happening in today’s philosophy of mind is truly extraordinary. The idea that
thoughts and feelings are “inner,” in a metaphorical sense, has been transformed into
what is believed to be a precise, hard-headed, scientiﬁc theory, namely, that thoughts
and feelings are actually in the head. This seems to be building a philosophical
position on a pun: what was ﬁrst regarded as metaphorically “inner” is now taken
to be literally “inner.”224
There are other kinds of propositions that are upheld in a different kind of way than the
more readily testable ones we described above. Wittgenstein writes:
However, we can ask: May someone have telling grounds for believing that the earth
has only existed for a short time, say since his own birth?—Suppose he had always
been told that,—would he have any good reason to doubt it? Men have believed
that they could make rain; why should not a king be brought up in the belief that
the world began with him? And if Moore and this king were to meet and discuss,
could Moore really prove his belief to be the right one? I do not say that Moore
could not convert the king to his view, but it would be a conversion of a special
kind; the king would be brought to look at the world in a different way.
Remember that one is sometimes convinced of the correctness of a view by its
simplicity or symmetry, i.e., these are what induce one to go over to this point of
view. One then simply says something like: “That’s how it must be.”225 [OC §92]
223T. Szasz. The Myth of Mental Illness. Perennial Library, Harper and Row, NY, 1973 (revised edition).
This failure of psychiatry, according to Szasz, occurs because of a problem of language, speciﬁcally, it occurs
because psychiatry has taken the metaphor “mental illness” too literally. No doubt, Wittgenstein would see this
as a “disease of thinking,” of confusing two language games—“sickness” as deﬁned by physiological medical
practice, versus, “sickness” deﬁned in psychiatric practice.
It may sound trivial to distinguish between those psychiatrists who accept the clear diagnosability of paranoid
schizophrenia and those who do not. But the acceptance of one view over the other is not just the acceptance of
a single diagnosis. Those who hold one view really hold an entire system of views. As Wittgenstein remarked:
When we ﬁrst begin to believe anything, what we believe is not a single proposition, it is a
whole system of propositions. (Light dawns gradually over the whole) [OC §141]
Interestingly, Wittgenstein has even had an impact on the ﬁeld of psychiatry. A book that takes a Wittgen-
steinean view of schizophrenia is Louis Sass’ The Paradoxes of Delusion: Wittgenstein, Schreber, and the
Schizophrenic Mind. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY, 1994.

1986.
225The “Moore” whom Wittgenstein referred to was his fellow Cambridge philosopher G.E. Moore. Wittgenstein
spent much of OC describing his objections to Moore’s philosophy as described in Moore’s 1939 paper “Proof
of an External World.”

160
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Here, Wittgenstein gives us examples of “facts” that do not lend themselves to proof the
way that more common ones do. He shows that there are other, more complex criteria for
our acceptance of them. These are the kinds of facts that comprise religious beliefs, such
as the assertion that the world was created in 6 days, or that all people are descended from
Adam and Eve, or that heaven and hell actually exist. These are facts that an astronomer,
who would not accept the existence of a tenth planet without substantial evidence, might
acceptwithoutscientiﬁcproof.Thesefactsaremorelikethe“mythology”thatWittgenstein
describes in the quotation at footnote 227 (supra). The rationale for these kinds of beliefs,
according to Wittgenstein, might be something like “simplicity” or “symmetry.” These
beliefs tend to ﬁll out the unknown parts or processes of our universe, such as, how the
universe could have come about, or, what happens to us when we die. Belief in them gives
us a kind of closure in our personal cosmology, it ﬁlls in the gaps and thereby creates a
kind of symmetry in our sense of the universe and our place in it. It is also simple, and
therefore easy to grasp and to pass on to others, unlike many scientiﬁc explanations.226
In the quotation at footnote 227 (supra) we see another metaphor. Wittgenstein draws an
analogy between the “inherited background” of facts and mythology:
The propositions describing this world-picture might be part of a kind of mythology.
This seems to be a decidedly odd statement coming from a philosopher with such a
strong analytical bent. How is our description of the factual world to be compared to a
mythology? On the one hand, we seem to have strong empirical justiﬁcation for our reality,
while mythology exists without such justiﬁcation. But if we look more closely, we ﬁnd
that there are similarities between what we take to be empirical reality and mythology. For
both, explanations have to stop somewhere, and when this point is reached we must simply
say that that is the way things are. When we try to explain how our universe began, we can
explain things back to the “Big Bang,” but we cannot go any further. Wittgenstein’s analysis
of meaning in language, which he considers the fundamental problem in philosophy, runs
up against a similar endpoint. We can talk about how we use language, we can give
examples of language use, and we can explain this usage up to a point. But we cannot go
further. For Wittgenstein, of course, the terminal point for our explanations of language
use and meaning comes in the activities in which we use the language in question. We can
226The rigor with which Wittgenstein approached philosophical problems might lend one to believe that he might
be disdainful of religion. But he was not. Normam Macolm brings out Wittgenstein’s religious point of view:
As a child Ludwig Wittgenstein received formal instruction in Roman Catholicism. Later
on, conversations with his sister Gretl destroyed his childish faith. He became indifferent
to, perhaps even contemptuous of, religious belief. When he was about 21 years of age,
however, something occurred that had a lasting impact on him. He saw a play in Vienna
which was mediocre drama: but there was a scene in which a person whose life had been
desperately miserable, and who thought himself about to die, suddenly felt himself to be
spoken to in the words, “Nothing can happen to you!” No matter what occurred in the world,
no harm could come to him! Wittgenstein was greatly struck by this thought (as he told me
approximately forty years later): for the ﬁrst time he perceived the possibility of religious
belief . . . [Wittgenstein: A Religious Point of View?, p. 7. Cornell University Press, Ithaca,
NY, 1994]. Later in life, Wittgenstein told his friend Drury, “I am not a religious man but
I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view.” [Ludwig Wittgenstein,
Personal Recollections, p. 94. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1984. Edited by R. Rhees.]

explain how language is used in, say, singing a song, but we can’t explain why we sing
songs. Singing is just something we do, which has no further justiﬁcation. Of course we
can continue the explanation of, here, singing, as a means of bonding people of the same
culture together, or for promoting social contact, or for inducing an infant to sleep, etc.
But we still have to ask why we do these things, and eventually we will reach the endpoint
that Wittgenstein reminds us of, where we will have to say, “This is simply what I do.”
Like mythology, the foundation of language is not rational:
It is so difﬁcult to ﬁnd the beginning. Or, better: it is difﬁcult to begin at the
beginning. And not try to go further back.
When a child learns language it learns at the same time what is to be investigated
and what not. When it learns that there is a cupboard in the room, it isn’t taught to
doubt whether what it sees later on is still a cupboard or only a kind of stage set.
...
Language did not emerge from some kind of ratiocination. [OC §§471–472, 475]
What is true of language is also true of language games:
. . . for why should the language-game rest on some kind of knowledge? [OC §477]
In fact, we don’t have “reasons” until we have language-games:
Instinct comes ﬁrst, reasoning second. Not until there is a language-game are there
reasons. [RPP II §689]
The child is not taught to believe that the cupboard exists, but is taught to open cupboards,
put things in cupboards, close cupboards, get things from cupboards, etc. The issue of the
cupboard’s existence never comes up.
The Foundation of Language in Instinctive Behavior
In spite of our discussion so far, it still must seem odd to some that language does “. . . not
emerge from some kind of ratiocination.” But Wittgenstein is certain that it does not.227
227This objection to a rational basis for language may seem like a minor point, but it is not. One of the most
inﬂuential modern linguists, Noam Chomsky, insists that the process of language acquisition is distinctly rational:
To learn a language. . . the child must have a method for devising an appropriate grammar,
given primary linguistic data. As a precondition for language learning, he must possess, ﬁrst,
a linguistic theory that speciﬁes the form of the grammar of a possible human language, and,
second, a strategy for selecting a grammar of the appropriate form that is compatible with the
primary linguistic data. [N. Chomsky. Aspects of the Theory of Syntax, p. 25. MIT Press,
Cambridge, 1965.]
This “linguistic theory” that the child possesses, Chomsky was later to call a “universal grammar”:
[Chomsky] Suppose we assign to the mind, as an innate property, the general theory of
language that we have called “universal grammar”. . . The theory of universal grammar, then,
provides a schema to which any particular grammar must conform. Suppose, furthermore,
that we can make this schema sufﬁciently restrictive so that very few possible grammars

162
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
As Wittgenstein pointed out, language is not the product of thought, it is “the vehicle of
conforming to the schema will be consistent with the meagre and degenerate data actually
available to the language learner. His task, then, is to search among the possible grammars
and select one that is not deﬁnitely rejected by the data available to him. [Chomsky. Language
and Mind, p. 88. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, NY, 1972.]
Why do we need the “universal grammar?” To Chomsky, there just isn’t enough linguistic information to enable
the child to learn language without some additional innate knowledge or ability:
We cannot avoid being struck by the enormous disparity between knowledge and experience—
in the case of language, between the generative grammar that expresses the linguistic com-
petence of the native speaker and the meager and degenerate data on the basis of which he
has constructed this grammar for himself. [op.cit., p. 78.]
If we just look at the linguistic information that the child has access to, then Chomsky is right, there is not enough
linguistic data for the child to build up his linguistic competence. But Chomsky’s missing the most important
component of language—a mistake that Wittgenstein doesn’t make:
. . . we don’t start from certain words, but from certain occasions or activities. [Wittgenstein.
LC, p. 3]
What lies at the foundation of a child’s learning language is not just linguistic data, but the child’s understanding
of the situations, activities and context that give that “meager and degenerate” linguistic data meaning. The
foundation of language lies not in some innate, mental, “deep structures” but surrounds us all in the “common
behavior of mankind.” Chomsky’s recourse to innate mental mechanisms is just the sort of “disease of thinking”
that Wittgenstein abhorred, since it encourages us to look for the foundation of language in the wrong place. Not
only does it ignore what is truly essential to linguistic meaning—situations, context, activities and practices—but
it is presented in such a way that it would be impossible to prove, or disprove. What would count as evidence
that the child has a “universal grammar” and uses it in the way Chomsky insists he must? Chomsky feels he
doesn’t have to prove his hypothesis because he believes it is the only one that can explain the child’s ability
to acquire language. But surely Wittgenstein’s theory of language use is a reasonable alternative to Chomsky’s,
and, if so, means that Chomsky must provide evidence for his version of language acquisition. This he cannot
do. Constructing a theory that embodies the only possible explanation of a phenomenon is a common method of
science, and Chomsky is to be commended for his rigor in analyzing language. But the rigor that characterized
his language theory was not a rigor that he discovered but a rigor he imposed on his work. Wittgenstein saw this
distinction quite clearly:
The more narrowly we examine language, the sharper becomes the conﬂict between it and our
requirement. (For the crystalline purity of logic was, of course, not a result of investigation;
it was a requirement.) The conﬂict becomes intolerable; the requirement is now in danger of
becoming empty.—We have got onto slippery ice where there is no friction and so in a certain
sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want
to walk; so we need friction. Back to the rough ground! [PI §107]
Chomsky ignored the “rough ground” of language use (what he called “performance”). Ironically, Malcolm
points out that Chomsky’s view of language is remarkably similar to Wittgenstein’s early view—a view that he,
Wittgenstein, later rejected, in large part:
One striking feature of Chomsky’s views about language is that they have a strong resemblance
to the conceptions of the Tractatus (published with English translation in 1922); and a second
striking feature is that they seem to totally ignore the devastating criticism of those conceptions
in the Philosophical Investigations (published with English translation in 1951). [Malcolm.

1994.]

163
thought” (see quote at footnote 64). But if language does not have its origin in thought or
“some kind of ratiocination,” from what does it come? Wittgenstein is quite clear in his
answer:
The origin and the primitive form of the language-game is a reaction; only from
this can the more complicated forms grow.
Language—I want to say—is a reﬁnement; “in the begining was the deed.” [CV
p. 31]
The origin of language is in the things that we do. We can imagine people existing who
do not have a language—perhaps someone suffering from aphasia. They would not be
able to say anything nor understand things that are said to them. But can we imagine the
opposite: a person who has linguistic ability but no routine activities, even of the most
primitive sort? Someone who is not active, who has never played, never run or jumped,
never thrown an object or even walked? The closest that we can imagine to someone ﬁtting
this image might be some unfortunate individual who has been brain-damaged from birth,
someone who hasn’t the ability or understanding to perform the simplest human acts.
Such an unfortunate individual would not have the characteristics, other than appearance,
of a person at all. What deﬁnes us as humans is not so much a common linguistic ability,
but a common ability to engage in many simple and complex human activities. In short,
we can imagine people without language but not people without shared activities.228
228As pointed out, aphasics are the best examples of people who do not have the ability to use or understand
language. The very existence of aphasia indicates that our ability to use language is modular and can be selectively
removed without affecting most of our other cognitive abilities. The sufferers from aphasia are usually stroke
or tumor victims and aphasia itself can be either expressive—the inability to use language—or receptive—the
inability to understand language—or both. Unfortunately, once aphasics are afﬂicted with this disability, they
can no longer report, or report reliably, to observers what they are going through, since the very medium by
which they would report what they experience—language—has been removed or corrupted. But Merlin Donald
describes a remarkable case of a paroxysmal aphasic, referred to as “Brother John,” who suffered periodic bouts
of aphasia which lasted anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours [Origins of the Modern Mind. Harvard
University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991]. After these periods of aphasia, Brother John was able to remember
what it was like to be aphasic, explaining, in detail, how his perceptions and abilities had changed. Further,
during his aphasic episodes, he was able to remember and carry out requests that were suggested by medical
observers. In this way, Brother John’s abilities during aphasia could be tested, as no aphasics had been tested
before.
The important fact about Brother John’s spells was that they selectively shut down language processing, while
he remained conscious and able to remember what he was experiencing. During his long spells, his cognitive
abilities returned gradually, progressing through several stages of recovery. The authors recorded his responses
and comments in detail and thus had an unusual opportunity to observe what a person can do in the absence of
speech (including internal speech) and written language [op.cit., p. 83].
Up until the appearance of subjects like Brother John it was not clear just what the dividing line was between
linguistic ability and other forms of intelligence that we consider uniquely human. But the following remarkable
story helps us to understand better where this boundary is:
The extent to which [Brother John] retained the ability to cope with practical challenges
was quite remarkable. One episode, while he was traveling in Switzerland, was particularly
striking. He found himself at the peak of one of his seizures as he arrived at his destination, a

164
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
town he had never seen before. He took his baggage and managed to disembark. Although he
could not read or speak, he managed to ﬁnd a hotel and show his medic-alert bracelet to the
concierge, only to be sent away. He then found another hotel, received a more sympathetic
reception, communicated by mime, and was given a room. He was able to execute various
procedures which formed a framework for linguistic operations; for example, he was able to
point out to the desk clerk where in his passport to ﬁnd the information required to ﬁll out
his registration slip, while not being able to read it himself. Finding himself too hungry and
miserable to sleep, he went to the hotel restaurant. He could not read the menu, but he pointed
to a line which he thought might be the hors d’oeuvres and randomly chose an item, hoping
he would like it. In fact, it was a dish he detested, but he ate it, returned to his room, and slept
for the remainder of his paroxysmal attack. When he awoke, he went to the hotel desk and
explained the episode in detail. [Donald, op.cit., pp. 84–85]
What Brother John’s aphasia showed is that the aphasic can understand and interact with his surroundings
appropriately in spite of his lack of expressive or receptive abilities in language. He could ﬁnd a hotel he
had never seen before even though he could not read or recognize a sign designating a hotel. As Donald
concludes:
A number of important conclusions can be drawn from this case. First, despite the complete
absence of language, internal or external, Brother John was able to cope in ways that are
uniquely human. He was capable of coherent thought, able to recognize music, voices, and
faces, and the uses of objects and places. His spatial orientation and basic mechanical intelli-
gence were intact. His episodic memory for the events of his seizures was accurate (this was
objectively veriﬁed by the authors) and organized. During a seizure, he was able to remember
and execute a request given to him weeks earlier by the authors—for example, taping his
spontaneous speech as it recovered during the spell.
...
Finally, both gestural ability and practical knowledge were intact. He could imitate or repro-
duce on demand a wide variety of gestures. He could tune a radio, operate an elevator, and,
as the Switzerland episode shows, assess and respond appropriately to a social situation of
some complexity. All of this was achieved in the absence of visual or oral language, and in
the absence of internal speech as well. In his own introspective account, he claimed that he
could not “ﬁnd the words” for things and events. Nevertheless, he could think about them
coherently, deal with them appropriately, and remember them later.
This case suggests strongly that human intellectual skill is uniquely powerful, even in the ab-
sence of language. Most of the behaviors demonstrated by this man during his seizures were
well beyond the abilities of any other primate or mammal. Language was obviously not the
vehicle by which he assessed events, formulated plans, and evaluated his own responses. Nor
was it important in his vivid and perceptive episodic registration of events or in the execution
of gestures and mime. Moreover, his semantic representations of the world were accessible
and useful to him, quite independently of language. . . the boundaries between the linguistic
and nonlinguistic worlds have seldom been so clearly seen. . . [op.cit., pp. 85–86].
What was lost, then, from knowledge and memory, by excising all forms of language and in-
ternal speech? In particular, what happened to his semantic memory, and what of propositional
knowledge? The verbal forms of this material were not available to him, and any cognitive
operations that were dependent upon symbolic representations could not be executed. But
he evidently knew many of the things that he normally would have expressed, and probably
learned, via the language system. Therefore, a great deal of his knowledge must have been
nonverbal, or at least stored outside of the language system in nonsymbolic form. . . Deaf
people who learn some form of language typically recall episodes from their youth, despite
the absence of normal language development. Thus, the human brain, without language, can
still record the episodes of life, assess events, assign meanings and thematic roles to agents

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
165
Wittgenstein’s point is that people build their linguistic ability on a set of common human
activities and abilities—activities and abilities that we all share as well as activities and
abilities that are shared by only those of a particular culture, class or background. It is
easiest to see this grounding of language in common activities when we think of learning
a new language:
Suppose you came as an explorer into an unknown country with a language quite
strange to you. In what circumstances would you say that the people there gave
orders, understood them, obeyed them, rebelled against them, and so on?
The common behavior of mankind; is the system of reference by means of which
we interpret an unknown language. [PI §206]
If we do not share or understand the customs and activities of a strange people then the
result is quite different:
We. . . say of some people that they are transparent to us. It is, however, important
as regards this observation that one human being can be a complete enigma to
another. We learn this when we come into a strange country with entirely strange
traditions; and, what is more, even given a mastery of the country’s language. We do
not understand the people. (And not because of not knowing what they are saying
themselves.) We cannot ﬁnd our feet with them.
...
If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.229 [PI p. 223]
in various situations, acquire and execute complex skills, learn and remember how to behave
in a variety of settings. [op.cit., p. 87 and p. 89]
Among the uniquely human capacities found in the complete absence of language are a capac-
ity for spontaneous gesture and mime, which can be retained after language loss; toolmaking
and praxis in general; emotional expression and social intelligence, including an ability to
comprehend complex events and remember roles, customs, and appropriate behavior. These
fundamental abilities, robust and so important to human survival, might have emerged early
in the human line, before language evolved. Their neuropsychological dissociability from
language suggests a distinctly human, but prelinguistic, level of cognitive development and
a possible basis for an early hominid adaptation that set the scene for the later arrival of
language. [op.cit., pp. 93–94]
The relevance of this to our present discussion is clear: although language is intimately tied up with our activities,
language itself can operate largely independently of our activities, giving support to Wittgenstein’s assertion that
“Language—Iwanttosay—isareﬁnement;‘inthebeginningwasthedeed’.”Further,thestatementthat“semantic
representations of the world were accessible and useful to him, quite independently of language. . . ” lends support
to Ellis’ assertion that language helps to set up categories of perception that can then exist independently of
language use.
(NB: There are actually a number of different forms of aphasia, viz., anomia, conduction aphasia, paraphasia,
jargonaphasia, ﬂuent aphasia, et al. For the purpose of this discussion their differences are not important. An early
advocate of the singularity of these afﬂictions was P. Marie. [“R´evision de la question sur l’aphasie: La troisi`eme

166
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
For Wittgenstein, the foundation of language is in shared activities—but not just any activi-
ties. The foundation of language rests on the shared activities that we perform instinctively.
There are two related characteristics of instinctive behavior: it is performed without con-
scious thought, and is unaccompanied by doubt. Such behaviors are commonplace in our
everyday affairs. We eat without thinking, drive our cars without thinking, play handball
without thinking, mow the lawn without thinking, shower without thinking—we can even
talk without thinking (see section Language and Thought, supra). That does not mean
that we have never thought during such activities, or will not in the future, it only means
that it is possible to perform them without thinking. Malcolm links instinctive behavior
with lack of doubt:
Absence of doubt manifests itself throughout the normal life of a human being. It
appears, ﬁrst, in advance of any learning: for example, in the spontaneous behavior
of reacting to a cause. This behavior is “instinctive” in the primary sense of the
word. Second, it appears in the young child when it is taught to respond to orders
such as “Sit in the chair,” “Hold out your hands,” and so on, before the child can
itself employ words. Third, it appears in the behavior, due to teaching, of employing
the names of objects. At these second and third levels, the conﬁdent way of acting
and speaking could be called “instinctive” in a secondary sense.
The absence of doubt, at all three levels, can be called “instinctive” because it
isn’t learned, and because it isn’t the product of thinking. . . The knowledge is not
something that underlies and explains the behavior.
...
One of the most striking illustrations of what I am calling the “instinctive element”
in the employment of language and in language-like activities, is the way in which
people who have been given some instruction in a procedure (such as continuing a
mathematical series, or drawing a design, or building a brick wall) will, when told
to carry on from there, spontaneously and on their own continue in the same way.
It would seem that from the original instruction those people could branch out in
an indeﬁnitely large number of directions, each one going a different way. It is true
that they could. But they don’t! Almost all of them will go on in a way that the
others will agree is the same way. This “agreement in reactions” is impressive. And
it cannot be explained by saying that they have “intuitively grasped the rule,” or
something of the sort. This conﬁdent going on in the same way, without any doubt,
cannot be given any rational foundation. This is a reason for calling it “instinctive.”
Why can’t a cat be taught to retrieve? Doesn’t it understand what one wants? And what
constitutes understanding or failure to understand here?
Retrieving is not one of the activities that cats do normally. As a consequence, we cannot train them to do this.
More importantly, since language is built on activities, we cannot link a command to a cat’s retrieving the way
we can with dogs when we tell them to “Fetch!” Paul Ziff gives a similar example:
I throw a cat a piece of meat. It does not see where the meat fell. I point to the meat; the
cat smells my ﬁnger. [Paul Ziff. Semantic Analysis. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 1960,
pp. 92–93.]

Without this kind of natural agreement, this instinctive going on in the same way,
there could not be language.230

rather, doubting is a special kind of thinking:
A child that is learning to use the word “tree.” One stands with it in front of a tree and says
“Lovely tree!” Clearly no doubt as to the tree’s existence comes into the language-game.
But can the child be said to know: “that a tree exists?” Admittedly it’s true that “knowing
something” doesn’t involve thinking about it—but mustn’t anyone who knows something be
capable of doubt? And doubting means thinking. [OC §480]
And doubting, like verbal thinking, operates within language games. There is a place for doubting in our daily
language use—that is, our language games—and a place for it in the activities that are part of our language
games. But while we can doubt things within the scope of a language game, we cannot doubt the empirical
foundations of these games:
. . . the absence of doubt belongs to the essence of the language-game. [OC §370]
You must bear in mind that the language-game is so to say something unpredictable. I mean:
it is not based on grounds. It is there—like our life. [OC §559]
The doubt that exists within a language game can only rest on empirical foundations that are beyond doubt:
Admittedly, if you are obeying the order “Bring me a book,” you may have to check whether
the thing you see over there really is a book, but then you do at least know what people
mean by “book”; and if you don’t you can look it up,—but then you must know what some
other word means. And the fact that a word means such-and-such, is used in such-and-
such a way, is in turn an empirical fact, like the fact that what you see over there is a
book.
Therefore, in order for you to be able to carry out an order there must be some empirical fact
about which you are not in doubt. Doubt itself rests only on what is beyond doubt. [OC §519]
One can see how the ordinary doubt that can be part of a language game differs from the more fundamental
doubt of the empirical foundations themselves:
Imagine that the schoolboy really did ask “and is there a table there even when I turn round,
and even when no one is there to see it?” Is the teacher to reassure him—and say “of course
there is!?”
Perhaps the teacher will get a bit impatient, but think that the boy will grow out of asking
such questions.
That is to say, the teacher will feel that this is not really a legitimate question at all. . . this
pupil has not learned how to ask questions. He has not learned the game that we are trying to
teach him.
This doubt isn’t one of the doubts in our game. [OC §§314–315, 317]
The relation of doubt and activity are close enough that were doubt to permeate all of our language games, it
would have a devastating effect on our lives. Malcolm comments:

168
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Instinctive behavior can be just a reaction—our jumping when hearing a loud noise. But
it can also be learned. Consider learning an athletic game like handball. We start by being
told how to hold our hands, then how to hit the ball, then we can be told the rules of the
game so we can see where we are allowed to hit the ball fairly, how to keep score, etc.
As we get better, we are coached on how to respond to speciﬁc game situations (“serve
conservatively when you’re behind and go for winners when you are ahead,” “every once
in a while reverse the spin on the ball when you hit it to throw your opponent’s timing
off”). All of this sort of coaching starts as a kind of background for our learning to
improve our game, and we may consciously repeat the coach’s instructions as we play. But
if we practice and play enough, there comes a time when these pointers will in large part
recede from consciousness and we will play primarily without thinking.231 If language is
grounded in learned and unlearned instinctive behavior, what can it be used for? In the ﬁrst
Now it is true that if a previously normal adult began to be in constant doubt about the meanings
of ordinary words, not only could he not continue to carry on the everyday employment of
language, but also his behavior would fall into disarray. [Malcolm, op.cit., p. 82]
I’m reminded of the comedian Gallagher talking about dictionaries: “Have you ever noticed that in a dictionary
they list words like ‘door’, ‘table’ and ‘chair’? Who would need to look those up?! If you didn’t know what a
‘chair’ or ‘table’ is, you wouldn’t know what a dictionary is either” (approximate quotation). As Wittgenstein
said, “Doubt itself rests only on what is beyond doubt.” (supra)
231This kind of non-thinking performance is related to what the psychologist Csikszentmihaly calls a “ﬂow
state.” Although he is talking about a kind of optimal experience, it is clear that even when one is performing
at a very high level in a complex task, one can engage in learned activities such that there is no accompanying
conscious thought. In fact, conscious thought will interfere with attaining such a state:
We have seen how people describe the common characteristics of [a ﬂow-state]: a sense that
one’s skills are adequate to cope with the challenges at hand, in a goal-directed, rule-bound
action system that provides clear clues as to how well one is performing. Concentration is
so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry
about problems. Self-consciousness disappears, and the sense of time becomes distorted. [M.
Csikszentmihaly. Flow: the Psychology of Optimal Experience, p. 71. Harper and Row,
NY, 1990.]
That this was not just a theoretical notion and had practical relevance is conﬁrmed by the fact that Csikszentmihaly
was hired by a professional football team to help its players achieve ﬂow states and perform instinctively. Another
analogy for Wittgenstein’s unthinking behavior is, as philosopher John Canﬁeld points out, the practice of Zen
Buddhism:
Wittgenstein’s later philosophy and the doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism integral to Zen
coincide in a fundamental aspect: for Wittgenstein language has, one might say, a mystical
base; and this base is exactly the Buddhist ideal of acting with a mind empty of thought. [J.
Canﬁeld. “Wittgenstein and Zen,” Philosophy, vol. 50, pp. 59–84, 1975. Quotation p. 59.]
Canﬁeld continues:
This “just doing” of something is an example of what Wittgenstein means by a “practice”
when he says that practice (and not some idea or other) is bedrock for the understanding
of language. . . Thus in this case it is doing, or practice, that stands as the foundation of the
understanding of language, and not the formation of ideas. Given these observations, the
view that it is necessary that understanding, at some point, proceed via thoughts, is no longer
attractive. For simply: if understanding can function at the ground level without beneﬁt of
thoughts (as it must) then why think that thoughts are necessary at any level?

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind

place, it can replace some forms of instinctive behavior, such as that which is related to
sensations:
A child has hurt himself and he cries; and then adults talk to him and teach him
exclamations and, later, sentences. They teach the child new pain-behavior. “So
you are saying that the word ‘pain’ really means crying?”—On the contrary: the
verbal expression of pain replaces crying and does not describe it. [PI §244]
Language can also extend, reﬁne and elaborate on instinctive behavior. Malcolm
comments:
Wittgenstein says that not only does language replace prelinguistic behavior, but
also that it serves as an extension, reﬁnement, or elaboration of that behavior. . . But
the language of sensation provides ﬁner descriptions of sensation than would be
possible with purely non-linguistic behavior. One says, “It still hurts but not as
much as it did yesterday”; or “There is a slight pain in my hip but not enough to
bother me.” These reports could not be conveyed in prelinguistic behavior.232
Language can also describe circumstances that can give an utterance sense when those
circumstances are not in effect. For example, if someone asks us what the word “charisma”
means, we might say, “Do you remember seeing a ﬁlm of a press conference with President
Kennedy? Do you recall his self conﬁdence, his good humor and the control he had over
the situation? Do you remember how reporters were so deferential towards him when they
asked questions? That’s what we mean when we say that Kennedy had ‘charisma’.” Or, a
tennis coach might counsel an athlete, “When your opponent is charging the net hit your
return right at his feet—if he is already at the net when you hit the ball, lob it over his
head.”
It is not just the basic or primitive examples of language that are grounded in instinctive
behavior, but also all of our more complex uses of language. Malcolm comments:
Not merely is much of the ﬁrst language of a child grafted onto instinctive
behavior—but the whole of the developed, complex, employment of language by
adult speakers embodies something resembling instinct.233
Wittgenstein’sgroundingoflanguageuseininstinctivebehaviorhasafurtherconsequence:
we can justify or explain our language use by referring to how it originates from instinctive
. . . we can view language as nowhere needing thought forms in order to function. [op.cit.,
p. 65]
232Malcolm, op.cit., p. 68. Wittgenstein writes:
Being sure that someone is in pain, doubting whether he is, and so on, are so many natural,
instinctive, kinds of behavior towards other human beings, and our language is merely an
auxiliary to, and further extension of, this relation. Our language-game is an extension of
primitive behavior. [Z §545]
233Malcolm, op.cit., p. 75.

170
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
behavior, but we can offer no further justiﬁcation; that is, we cannot justify or explain the
instinctive behavior itself. For example, if someone asked us, “Why did you cry out?,”
we could answer, “I dropped the hammer on my foot and it hurt.” But if we were asked,
further, “Why did dropping the hammer on your foot hurt you?” we would not know
what to say—it simply happens that way. This is easy to see when we are dealing with
sensations, but the same holds true for more complex linguistic acts. For example, if we
were asked, “Why did you laugh when you talked to Bill?” we might reply, “He told me
a very funny joke.” But if we were then asked, “But why do you laugh when you hear
something funny?,” again, we would not know what to say. When we hear something funny
we usually laugh—that’s simply what we do.
If I have exhausted the justiﬁcations I have reached bedrock, and my spade is turned.
Then I am inclined to say: “This is simply what I do.”234 [PI §217]
By setting limits to what we can explain, Wittgenstein is cautioning us not to look fur-
ther than our shared, instinctive behavior if we want to understand how language use is
grounded:
It is so difﬁcult to ﬁnd the beginning. Or, better: it is difﬁcult to begin at the
beginning. And not try to go further back.
When a child learns language it learns at the same time what is to be investigated
and what not. When it learns that there is a cupboard in the room, it isn’t taught to
doubt whether what it sees later on is still a cupboard or only a kind of stage set.
Just as in writing we learn a particular basic form of letters and then vary it later, so
we learn ﬁrst the stability of things as the norm, which is then subject to alterations.
This game proves its worth. That may be the cause of its being played, but it is not
the ground.
I want to regard man here as an animal; as a primitive being to which one grants in-
stinct but not ratiocination. As a creature in a primitive state. Any logic good enough
for a primitive means of communication needs no apology from us. Language did
not emerge from some kind of ratiocination.
Children do not learn that books exist, that armchairs exist, etc. etc.,—they learn
to fetch books, sit in armchairs, etc.235 [OC §§471–476]
234Compare with William James’ statement:
. . . it takes a mind debauched by learning to carry the process of making the natural seem
strange so far as to ask for the “why” of any instinctive act. [Quoted in O. Morton’s “Doing
What Comes Naturally: A New School of Psychology Finds Reasons for your Foolish Heart,”
The New Yorker, p. 102, 3 November 1997.]
235The child has no doubt whether books, armchairs, etc. exist. The issue of doubt is not part of the activities
that use books, armchairs, etc. Wittgenstein also states:
The squirrel does not infer by induction that it is going to need stores next winter as well.
And no more do we need a law of induction to justify our actions and predictions. [OC §287]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
171
Wittgenstein’s views on the foundation of language use are important in themselves, but
they also ﬁt with Wittgenstein’s more general method for examining language and the
forms of our thought. Previously, Wittgenstein urged us to examine the “depth grammar”
of language if we wanted to understand the structure of thought. Traditional epistemologi-
cal inquiry has been primarily concerned with examining mental events—our thoughts—
through either introspection (the method of choice for philosophers) or the questioning
of reliable subjects (the method of choice for psychologists). But these methods can go
wrong in a number of ways: Introspection is unreliable because I cannot know precisely
whether the mental event that I experience is like someone else’s mental event. For ex-
ample, I say that hearing a children’s song reminds me of third grade. But what does this
consist of?—a recollection of my classroom (only the vaguest image here, I can remember
no one exactly)? A recollection of the school building? A recollection of my teacher, a
middle-aged woman named Mrs. Espinshade? A recollection of the joy or disappoint-
ment of that time in my life? How could I possibly communicate this image accurately?
I probably could not communicate it at all to anyone who had not seen my third grade
school and teacher, and knew me at the time. Even if someone were to respond to me
saying that he too thinks of his third grade class when he hears the same song, certainly
his image, though seeming to be similar, would be very different from mine since, ob-
viously, he went to a different school than I did, perhaps at a different time, too. Even if
two subjects were to agree that they both had the same “thought” pop into their minds the
similarity may be an illusion. For example, someone mentions the “Cuban Missile Crisis”
and both of us immediately have an image of John F. Kennedy ﬂoat before our minds.
This appears to be the same “thought,” but it may not be so. My image of Kennedy may be
of him making his inaugural speech. The image may be animated and I may even “hear”
a sentence or two of that speech in his distinctive Boston accent. My friend, though, has
an image of a black and white photo of Kennedy on vacation at Hyannis Port playing
with his daughter Caroline. Are these two mental associations the same? Only in the most
general, and uninformative, sense. And even if the images were the same, their interpre-
tations, like the interpretation of any picture, could be decidedly different. Wittgenstein
comments:
Images tell us nothing either right or wrong, about the external world. . . Images are
subject to the will. . .
It is just because forming images is a voluntary activity that it does not instruct us
about the external world. [Z §621, 627]
Wittgenstein also refers to the “animal” nature of certainty:
One might say: “ ‘I know’ expresses comfortable certainty, not the certainty that is still strug-
gling.”
Now I would like to regard this certainty, not as something akin to hastiness or superﬁ-
ciality, but as a form of life. (That is very badly expressed and probably badly thought as
well.)
But that means I want to conceive it as something that lies beyond being justiﬁed or unjustiﬁed;
as it were, as something animal. [OC §§357–359]

172
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The other method of examining mental events is to record the recollections of reliable
subjects as they describe their own thoughts or mental images. Again, there is a problem.
Whatever similarity we may ﬁnd in the descriptions that the subjects give is just that—a
similarity of the descriptions, not a similarity of the mental images they purport to describe.
The irony of this is that the similarity of descriptions appears to reﬂect a similarity of mental
images—that is, a similarity of internal/mental events. Yet what is really similar are two
external events—the two descriptions—not two internal events. The impression that such
reports give us any precise information about mental events that could be compared is
illusory. Again, the example about John F. Kennedy is apropos: two subjects are asked
about the mental image that they formed in response to some suggestion, and they report
that they each had an image of JFK appear in their minds. What is the same here is not
the mental images that the two subjects conjure up; what is the same are the descriptions
they give to those mental events. In this light, it is not surprising that Wittgenstein moves
his analysis of inner mental events to outer linguistic/grammatical events.236
Through his use of depth grammatical analysis, Wittgenstein showed that we could ex-
amine the way we think by looking at external events—examples of language use—that
236This reliance on reports of mental processes is probably one of the reasons that Wittgenstein disliked the
experimental methods of psychology:
The confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be explained by calling it a “young
science”; its state is not comparable with that of physics, for instance, in its beginnings.
(Rather with that of certain branches of mathematics. Set theory.) For in psychology there are
experimental methods and conceptual confusion. (As in the other case conceptual confusion
and methods of proof.)
The existence of experimental methods makes us think we have the means of solving the
problems which trouble us; though problem and methods pass one another by. [PI p. 232]
An almost identical series of statements exist in RPP I §1039. It differs only in that it includes the following
penultimate sentence (supra):
While, however, in mathematics one may be pretty sure that a proof will be important, even if
it is not yet rightly understood, in psychology one is completely uncertain of the fruitfulness
of the experiments.
Gestalt psychologist K¨ohler offered an explanation for psychology’s unscientiﬁc nature:
Why does this difﬁculty beset behavioristic psychology, and not occur in physics? The answer
issimpleenough:Physicsisanoldscienceandpsychologyisinitsinfancy.[From“Psychology
as a Young Science” in his Gestalt Psychology, NY, 1929.]
Wittgenstein has a response, though:
Misleading parallel: psychology treats of processes in the psychical sphere, as does physics
in the physical.
Seeing, hearing, thinking, feeling, willing, are not the subject of psychology in the same sense
as that in which the movements of bodies, the phenomena of electricity etc., are the subject of
physics. You can see this from the fact that the physicist sees, hears, thinks over, and informs
us of these phenomena, and the psychologist observes the external reactions (the behavior)
of the subject. [PI §571]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
173
Wittgenstein never said explicitly what he disliked about psychology, but there are a number of characteristics
of the ﬁeld that he would likely be uncomfortable with:
1. As we mentioned above, psychology relies too much on subjects’ reporting of mental events. This reliance
arises from two beliefs: the ﬁrst is a belief that if we want to understand human cognition we should look primarily
at our conscious thought processes. This belief is questioned in one of Wittgenstein’s most quoted statements:
There is a kind of general disease of thinking which always looks for (and ﬁnds) what would
be called a mental state from which all our acts spring as from a reservoir. [BB p. 143]
The second belief is in a parallelism between descriptions of thoughts and the thoughts themselves. It assumes
that the same verbal descriptions of mental events by different individuals indicate that the mental events they
are describing are the same too. Yet when two individuals give the same description of their respective thoughts,
does this mean that they have the same thoughts? How could we possibly know?
Implicit in psychology’s reliance on personal reports of mental events is the belief that we can’t “really know”
what others are thinking, without their telling us, drawing a sharp boundary between public knowledge and
private knowledge. Wittgenstein attempts to show that this boundary is not as sharp as is traditionally thought,
that we can, in fact, know a great deal about what goes on “in others’ minds,” without their having to report what
they are thinking; in fact, much of our behavior is based on our being able to correctly surmise what others are
thinking or believe. But we have to look at the right things. If we only look at the descriptions of mental events as
criteria for what someone is thinking, then, rightly, we can’t know what is going on in someone else’s head, unless
he tells us (but even here, we cannot accept what he says except under certain circumstances, so statements by
themselves are not sufﬁcient). But if we look instead at circumstances, criteria, etc. that surround us all in our
day-to-day activities, then we can ﬁgure out quite a bit about what someone else is thinking. (I will discuss this
dichotomy between inner and outer processes in more detail in the section “Wittgenstein and Crime.”)
2. Wittgenstein would also be concerned about the way that psychology talks about the subjects that concern it.
The obvious example is when we ask for the meaning of a word we are led to look for some “entity” that is “the
meaning.” In the same manner, we often treat “concepts,” “subconscious,” “ego,” “phobias,” etc. like they are
deﬁnite psychological entities. This gives us a sense that they must exist in the same way that “meanings” are
thought to exist for words. We then reserve a place for these entities in our theory of mind and begin the process
of looking for something that will ﬁt. Of course, we will always ﬁnd something that will provide some kind of
“ﬁt” (and if we don’t, we won’t adjust our theory to account for why they are missing, we will adjust our theory
to account for why we can’t ﬁnd them—e.g., they are unconscious, or, they go by our consciousness so quickly
we can’t see them).
This is the same misleading process that Ryle talked about in his “Systematically Misleading Expressions” in
which he demonstrates how the use of the word “the”—as in the idea—gives a misleading ontological status to
whatever follows it. [vid. footnote 102, supra]
3. Wittgenstein would also be suspicious of the experimental method’s need for statistically signiﬁcant numbers
of cases to prove its hypotheses. That is, we may be tempted to treat things as the same which are not really
the same. For example, when the psychologist looks at “fear” or “suspicion” or “anger” is he always looking
at the same thing? Is my fear of lions the same as my fear of spiders? Is my fear of nuclear war the same as
a general’s fear of nuclear war? Is our love of humanity the same as our love of ice cream? Can an American
love the taste of a uniquely Hungarian desert like Dobos Torta the way a Hungarian does? Wittgenstein is not
saying that such comparisons are impossible, nor is he saying that all is diversity and there are no entities that
can be classiﬁed in the same category. Wittgenstein is merely saying that our “craving for generality”. . . ”our
contempt for the particular case” is so strong that we must be constantly on guard that we are not reducing
dissimilar things into a misleading similarity. For Wittgenstein, the tabulation of signiﬁcant numbers of cases
is not as compelling evidence as a single, well-chosen example—in his words, an “¨ubersichtliche Darstellung”
(“perspicuous representation,” or “exemplary presentation”).
4. There is a ﬁnal possible explanation for Wittgenstein’s dislike of psychology: viz. he may have criticized set

174
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
theory along with psychology in the quotation above because he dislikes both ﬁelds for the same reason. While
Wittgenstein didn’t state explicitly why he disliked psychology, he does elaborate on his dislike for set theory:
The error in the set-theoretical approach continually consists in treating laws and reports (lists)
as basically one and the same. [Manuscript 108. 1929–1930, p. 180. Quoted in Hallett’s A
Companion to Wittgenstein’s “Philosophical Investigations,” p. 756. Cornell University
Press, Ithaca, NY, 1977.]
Wittgenstein is complaining that set theory confuses, in more formal terminology, extensionality and intention-
ality. The intension of a set is the law or deﬁnition that can be used to determine set membership: for example
that the set of dogs consists of quadraped mammals with certain physical characteristics. The extension of a
set consists of the actual members that have been included in the set at this time: for example, the set of dogs
consists of this cockerspaniel, this doberman, this shelty, etc. Intentionality and extensionality are not the same
for the obvious reason that we can deﬁne sets intentionally that have no members, that is, have no extension:
for example, the set of people who are ten feet tall, or the set of left-handed major-league third basemen.
Psychology, as an empirical science, deals continually with sets, both intentional (e.g., people with claustro-
phobia) and extensional (e.g., the people who have read this sentence). Much psychological research consists of
determining what the characteristics are of certain groups of individuals: for example, what characteristics do
excellent chess players have in common? The most common mistake that psychology can make in this process
is a form of reductionism: to take a group of individuals that are deﬁned extensionally by some activity (e.g.,
like playing chess well) and trying to reduce them to a set of intentional psychological characteristics (e.g.,
having an IQ above 130, having a good aptitude for mathematics as a youth, etc). The confusion comes up in
two ways. In the ﬁrst place, it is not always clear that references to psychological states, such as an “aptitude
for mathematics” refers to well-determined empirical phenomena. (vid. Ryle, footnote 102)
The second way in which this confusion occurs is in the assumption that an extensionally-deﬁned group of
people can be meaningfully described by a set of intentionally-deﬁned characteristics. For example, even if it is
the case that we can deﬁne mathematical aptitude empirically, can measure it reliably, and can show that good
chess players have it and poor ones don’t, it is entirely possible that such an observation really tells us little
about what it means to be a good chess player. In short, just because we can measure it doesn’t mean that it’s
signiﬁcant or important. This is why Wittgenstein says “. . . in psychology one is completely uncertain of the
fruitfulness of the experiments” (supra). Further, because of the empirical need for measurement in psychology,
intentional deﬁnitions may be subtly altered to make them more measurable, thus confounding intension and
extension. This is why Wittgenstein asserts:
The existence of experimental methods makes us think we have the means of solving the
problems which trouble us; though problems and methods pass one another by. [supra]
For Wittgenstein, it may be the case that the only important thing that good chess players have in common is
that they are good chess players (vid. section Wittgenstein’s Approach—The Rejection of Nominalism and
Realism, supra), a claim which has a less problematic connection between its extension and intension than
the more reductionistic psychological statements. The “disease of thinking” that psychologists commit here
Wittgenstein referred to in a slightly different context:
The desire to ﬁnd essential deﬁnitions of words that work in a variety of contexts is part of
our “craving for generality” and our “contemptuous attitude towards the particular case.” [BB
p. 18]
Here, we might take the speciﬁc usages of words as their extension and their “essential deﬁnition” as their
intension. Even though Wittgenstein is here objecting to the attempt to provide essential deﬁnitions of words,
it is not, I think, an incorrect intellectual reach to apply this to the attempt to ﬁnd the “essential deﬁnitions” of
psychological phenomena. In short, Wittgenstein’s statement can, I think, be taken to express his caution about
trying to deﬁne or characterize an intensely human activity, such as playing chess well, as a set of psychological
characteristics or states.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind

are accessible to us all; we need neither introspection nor truthful reports of our thoughts
to do this. Similarly, Wittgenstein is saying here that if we want to ﬁnd the foundations of
language use we should be looking at external processes, not some elusive or idiosyncratic
descriptions of internal mental processes. As Malcolm comments:
We have the inclination to suppose that all mastery of language, as well as all
meaningful behavior, is based on and emerges from mental states or attitudes that
should be expressible in psychological terms. But what we ﬁnd is that all of the
psychological terms either redescribe, or else presuppose, ways of acting. It is these
ways of acting that provide the foundation for the psychological concepts. They
are “the main thing” (die Hauptsache), which shows itself when one reﬂects on the
practice of language, but which itself is not supported by any mental process or
structure.237
By shifting our analysis from internal events and processes to external ones, Wittgenstein
can also prescribe a limit or end point for such analysis:
Giving grounds, however, justifying the evidence, comes to an end;—but the end
is not certain propositions’ striking us immediately as true, i.e. it is not a kind of
seeing on our part; it is our acting, which lies at the bottom of the language-game.238
[OC §204]
Instinctive Behavior and Forms of Life
Instinctive behavior and forms of life appear to have some similarities. They are both
comprised in large part of conventional, repeated activities that, in aggregate, make up
many of the “things that we do.” In this sense they are the same. But while instinctive
behavior is comprised of human activities which we perform without thinking, forms of
life are not so narrowly deﬁned. As we have pointed out, when someone is learning certain
kinds of instinctive behavior (what Malcolm called the “second” and “third” levels of
instinctive behavior—see quotation at footnote [236]) he will probably go about it quite
consciously. Consider a handball coach: “Swing your hand with your palm perpendicular
to the ﬂoor, stride into the ball as you make contact, hit the ball near the top of your hand
237Malcolm. Wittgensteinean Themes: Essays 1978–1989, pp. 85–86. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY,
1995. Edited by G.H. von Wright.
238It is easy to get caught in the downward spiral of reductive explanation and hard to know when to stop. One
of the least considered failures of psychoanalysis is that its explanation of unconscious motivation suffers from
the same inﬁnite regress that Artistotle saw in Plato’s realism (see the description of the “third man” argument in
the section Universals and Particulars—An Old Debate, supra). Psychoanalysis explains inconsistencies that
occur between the way people act and the way that they profess to want to act. For example, an individual may
profess to have the utmost respect for business associates, but is continually ﬂagrantly late for meetings. The
psychoanalyst might say that while the individual consciously expresses his respect for others, unconsciously he
really feels hostile towards them, and acts out this hostility by keeping them waiting repeatedly. The failure with
this kind of explanation is that if we need an unconscious mind to interpret what the conscious mind presents,
then why do we assume that the unconscious mind is the ﬁnal arbiter of psychological conﬂicts? In short, if the
conscious mind can be false or misleading, how can we not suspect the unconscious mind of being false too? We
would then need a deeper unconscious mind to explain the unconscious mind. Of course, if this is the case, then
we need an even deeper unconscious mind to explain the deeper unconscious mind. Hence, the inﬁnite regress.
Just as Occam applied his “razor” to pare off the unnecessary universals of realism, Wittgenstein would have us
remove the unconscious mind, and even much of the conscious mind from any epistemological investigation.

176
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
if you want a natural spin on the ball and with the bottom part of your hand if you want
a reverse spin, snap your wrist on contact and follow through. . . ” If our subject practices
this enough, he will eventually be able to do this “instinctively”—without conscious
thought. During the learning period, our novice handball player could not be said to be
engaging in instinctive behavior, but he could be seen to engage in an activity that might
be characterized as a form of life. In this sense, instinctive behavior is a restricted subset of
forms of life, while forms of life comprise activities that may or may not be instinctive.239
Since language use is grounded in activities, both instinctive and conscious, and language
is “the vehicle of thought,” it is not hard to see that the nature and form of our thinking
is largely grounded in our activities. While this is an important inference, its import for
cognition is even more profound than may at ﬁrst appear. Merlin Donald suggests that
there is enough evidence from research in neurophysiology to establish the claim that our
participation in shared activities—what we would call, our “culture”— actually affects the
physical structure of our brains:
In has been known for some time that the immature brain is highly plastic; that is, it
can grow connections, and lose connections, in many different ways, depending on
early experience. Changeux has proposed an epigenetic theory of brain develop-
ment, in which the young brain proliferates new connections fairly indiscriminately,
that is, invents many possible routes of development, of which only a few will sur-
vive,duetotheselectiveeffectsofexperience. . . Changeuxwasawareofthecultural
corollary of this notion: namely, that culturally speciﬁc, highly redundant patterns
of brain use would imply the existence of cultural traditions that have an indirect
neurological instantiation—that is, the brains of many individuals in one culture are
broadly programmed in a speciﬁc way, while in another culture they may develop
differently, because use patterns are fundamentally different. . . Cultures restructure
the mind, not only in terms of its speciﬁc contents, which are obviously culture-
bound, but also in terms of its fundamental neurological organization. . . Culture
can literally reconﬁgure the use patterns of the brain; and it is probably a safe in-
ference from our current knowledge of cerebral plasticity that those patterns of use
determine much about how the exceptionally plastic human central nervous system
is ultimately organized, in terms of cognitive structure.240
239Even when we think about what we need to do while we are doing it—that is, when we are following the
coach’s instructions—there are many movements that we engage in that are not conscious. For example, when
the coach tells us that we must follow through with our swing, we don’t tell ourselves to “dip my shoulder 4
inches, bend my elbow 107 degrees at the beginning of the swing, keep my elbow 2 inches below the plane of
my hand, accelerate my hand at 32 ft/sec/sec, tense my hand at 15 pounds/sq.inch, make contact with the ball
one half inch below the base of the ring ﬁnger, etc. etc.” Such explanations could go down to an almost unlimited
level of granularity. So when we say that such descriptions are conscious, we are not saying that every minute
aspect of the directions must be described. It is only necessary for some of the action to be conscious. It is also
true that even when we are conscious of what we are doing, it is likely that there is much that we do that is not
conscious—that is, that conscious activity rests on a broad stratum of non-conscious activity.

13–14. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991 [Donald cites J. Changeux. Neuronal Man. Pantheon
Books, NY, 1985]. Donald equates “culture” with the “shared patterns of acquired behavior characteristic of
a species” [p. 9]. Although he does not state explicitly that culture consists of shared activities, his notion of
“shared patterns of acquired behavior” is reasonably similar to our notion of the shared activities or “forms of
life” that underlie our use of language. It is not, then, unreasonable to conclude that participation in the shared
activities that underly language use can affect the very physiological structure of the brain. This means, in turn,

Language and Cognition: What Do We Have in Our Heads,
and What is it Good for?
Wittgenstein’s desire to move epistemological analysis from the examination of internal,
mental events to the examination of external events—language use, activities, and their
surrounding context and circumstances—continues in his analysis of cognition. It is clear
that we often have something “in our heads” at times, so it is important to consider these
mental events to determine what they are and what their role is in what we do. Let’s look
ﬁrst at a familiar activity: Consider teaching someone to throw a baseball. We would
demonstrate the proper grip on the ball, the proper motion of the arm, the release, where
that changing some of the language and thought patterns that depend on the physiological structure of the brain
may be extremely difﬁcult to do, and explains why we sometimes cannot see another’s point of view no matter
how hard we try. Anthropologist Edward Hall has observed that cultural differences are extremely difﬁcult for us
to overcome. If these differences are largely instantiated in neurological structure, as Donald argues, then it gives
support to Hall’s claim [E. Hall.Beyond Culture. Anchor Books, New York, 1976]. Wittgenstein’s assertion
that “The common behavior of mankind is the system of reference by means of which we interpret an unknown
language” (supra) takes on an even more profound import.
Donald even sees the inﬂuence of culture on cognitive structure as the essential component of human evolution:
. . . what humans evolved was primarily a generalized capacity for cultural innovation. Part of
that capacity was linguistic communication; part of it was the ability to think and represent
the environment. . .
Dunbar has recently proposed that encephalization was driven not by the cognitive demands
of tool making or spatial mapping of the environment but by growth in the size of social
groups. In other words, it was not instrumental intelligence that drove brain expansion but
rather social intelligence. Complex societies make great demands on memory. . .
. . . the actual cognitive structure of an individual mind is heavily inﬂuenced by culture. [op.cit.,
pp. 10–11. Donald cites Dunbar, “Ecological Modeling in an Evolutionary Context,” Folia
Primatologica (Basel), vol. 53, pp. 235–246.]
From this we might surmise that the greatest achievement of ancient cultures such as the Egyptians was not so
much the building of the pyramids at Giza and the spectacular temple of Karnak, but the organizing of large
numbers of people into a complex society dedicated to the common effort of large projects. Since, as Donald
says, “speciﬁc types of human culture have direct effects upon individual cognition,” we can see that the large
projects engaged in by the Egyptians, and, later, other cultures, may have had a direct developmental effect on the
cognitive structures and abilities of the people involved and their descendents. [op.cit. pp. 9–10] So many ancient
cultures engaged, independently, in large building projects (Pueblo Bonito, Ankor Wat, Stonehenge, Teotihuac´an,
The Great Wall of China, etc.) that one is tempted to hypothesize that such large projects were part of a natural
social and cognitive evolution. Certainly, some of these projects can be justiﬁed on practical grounds: they not
only served some purpose of habitation or defense, but they also kept their inhabitants busy and, presumably,
unable to foment rebellion—unity being a major concern as societies grew larger. But if Donald is correct, these
building projects may have encouraged commensurate changes in the brain’s physiological structure that enabled
increasingly large groups of individuals to live together successfully (the projects, of course, did not cause the
change in physiological brain structure, but provided a means by which increasingly adaptive changes in brain
physiology could be selected—those individuals who were “better” at participating in or leading these large
projects, would be rewarded economically, and this reward would better enable them to produce and provide for
a family, thus passing on their adaptive genes).
In terms of our later discussion, we must ask how the structure and processes of large computerized information
systems may affect the way we think, and, perhaps, are compelled to think, about accessing information.

178
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
to throw it, etc. Wouldn’t it be odd if after our demonstration our pupil were to turn to
us and ask, “But what went on in your mind when you were throwing the ball? I need to
know that too.” We see this question as odd when we are teaching someone a physical
technique, but we do not see this as odd when we talk about meaning and language. When
we begin to see language usage as a technique, like pitching in baseball, we will also
see questions about an inner process that precedes or accompanies all language use as
somehow misplaced. This is not to deny that something might have gone on in my mind
when I was pitching, it is only to deny that what did go on in my mind is a necessary
accompaniment of the pitching and that I need to know it before I can pitch successfully.
We can also see a bit better why Wittgenstein insisted that forms, not facts, are what guide
our meaningful activities (and language use is an activity). There is no “fact” about my
arm that inﬂuences my pitching, but its general form inﬂuences how I will throw the ball
(how far it is possible to throw it, what kind of spin I can put on it, how accurately I can
throw, etc.). The general form of the anatomy of my arm does not cause me to throw in a
particular way, but it does inﬂuence it. But, again, the anatomy of my arm is not the only
inﬂuence on how I throw. The form or requirements of the game of baseball inﬂuence
how I will throw, too. It also depends on how much I practiced, who taught me, how
much time my coach spent with me, etc. And of course, there are outside factors that may
inﬂuence my pitching on a daily, or even pitch by pitch basis, such as the temperature,
the wind and its direction, and the skill of the batters I face. Can we pitch in our minds?
Of course. In fact, such imagining of athletic performance is often recommended to
athletes by coaches as a way of sharpening or reﬁning their skills (One is reminded of the
serene portrait of Olympic skiers waiting at the top of a downhill run, dreamily swaying
their heads, eyes closed, as they imagine themselves skiing down the course.). But it’s
important to get the cart and the horse the right way round. In general, one must be able
to perform, or at least observe, the activity or skill externally before one can perform it
internally, that is, mentally—one must be able to pitch in reality before one can pitch in his
imagination.
Let’s look at a more cerebral practice, such as addition. Most parents have had experience
teaching a small child to add. How is it done? Well, one puts two similar things—say,
oranges—together and says, “Two,” or “Two oranges” (Of course the child must know
what oranges are, be able to count, and be of otherwise normal intelligence.). The parent
then puts three more oranges next to the original two, and says, “. . . plus three oranges,
is how many oranges?” The parent may then show how to count all the oranges, “. . . one,
two, three, four, ﬁve oranges. . . ” If done repeatedly, then the child will be able to “add”
small numbers of objects together in the same way. A variety of more complicated skills
can be built on this simple one. For example, the parent could then show the child how to
add more things together by making series of small marks with a pencil on a piece of paper,
and eventually, could teach addition using base-ten arithmetic. The important thing is that
one can perform any of these procedures without having any accompanying conscious
thoughts whatsoever. One could do practically all the “thinking,” so to speak, with pencil
and paper. Like learning to pitch, the technique of addition is taught without any recourse to
conscious thought. Teaching someone to add consists entirely of demonstrating processes
that are external to the mind—nothing about teaching elementary addition needs to refer
to mental abilities or techniques (one certainly must have an ability to recognize things as

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
179
separate entities, but this is not an ability that is referred to. It is the instinctive background
which is the basis for counting). Malcolm comments:
People often do arithmetical calculations in their minds or, as we say, “in their
heads.” Are all calculations done in the head? Certainly not. Someone who labori-
ously worked out a complicated multiplication on paper, did not do it “in his head.”
This is not how this expression is used. One may be inclined to say: “He must have
done the calculation in his head as well as on paper. Surely he would not have been
able to do it on paper unless he had done it in his head!” What a peculiar idea! In
writing out the calculation, was he copying the calculation that he did in his head?
Was the outward calculation guided by an inward calculation? Then what guided the
inward calculation? To avoid an inﬁnite regress one has to say that nothing guided
it. But if one has to stop, why not stop with the calculation on paper? And the ex-
planation of his being able to calculate would simply be that he learned it in school.
There are people who are unable to calculate in their heads. Most of us cannot do
complex arithmetical calculations in that way. There is a philosophical temptation
to think that calculating in one’s head comes ﬁrst, and that calculating on paper or
aloud is derivative from it. But. . . the exact reverse is the case. We do not say of
someone that he does calculations in his head, unless he has learned to calculate in
writing or aloud. This is where the logical priority is.
“Calculating in one’s head” is one of those expressions that seem to have been
deliberately invented to mislead philosophers. It looks as if “in one’s head” must
mean, in one’s brain. So at least some calculations literally occur in the brain. But
if we don’t just look at the words but consider the circumstances in which they are
used, we see that nothing is implied about an occurrence in the brain.241
Wittgenstein makes a similar point more succinctly:
Only if you have learnt to calculate—on paper or out loud—can you be made to
grasp, by means of this concept, what calculating in the head is.242 [PI p. 216]
Some observers may counter that we still, in fact, do such things “in our heads,” but
that these conscious accompaniments are so subtle or brief that we just don’t see them.
When one considers this explanation, though, it is hard to ﬁnd evidence to support it, and
Wittgenstein is quite outspoken in his objection to it:
If it is asked: “How do sentences manage to represent?”—the answer might
be: “Don’t you know? You certainly see it, when you use them.” For nothing is
concealed.

Blackwell, Oxford, UK, 1986.
242Compare to PI §366:
Is a sum in the head less real than a sum on paper?—Perhaps one is inclined to say some such
thing; but one can get oneself to think the opposite as well by telling oneself: paper, ink, etc.
are only logical constructions out of our sense-data.

180
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
...
But given this answer: “But you know how sentences do it, for nothing is
concealed” one would like to retort “Yes, but it all goes by so quick, and I should
like to see it as it were laid open to view.”
Here it is easy to get into that dead-end in philosophy where one believes that the
difﬁculty of the task consists in this: our having to describe phenomena that are
hard to get hold of, the present experience that slips quickly by or something of the
kind. Where we ﬁnd ordinary language too crude, and it looks as if we were having
to do, not with the phenomena of every-day, but with ones that “easily elude us, and,
in their coming to be and passing away, produce those others as an average effect.”
(Augustine: Manifestissima et usitatissima sunt, et eadem rusus nimis latent, et
nova est inventio eorum.)243 [PI §§435–436]
And nothing is more wrong-headed than calling meaning a mental activity! Unless,
that is, one is setting out to produce confusion. [PI §693]
It is important to note that Wittgenstein says not only that the foundation of meaning in
language is not a mental process, but that it cannot be a mental process. This is relatively
simple to demonstrate, since it is clear that our intentions or thoughts are never sufﬁcient to
give our utterances or gestures meaning—otherwise we would never be misunderstood. If
I make a particularly vulgar gesture that is known to Italians, it will not be understood, no
matterhowmuchImeanitto,unlessIaminthecompanyofItalianswhomightcomprehend
it. That is, the gesture must have the right context. But even this is not enough, for the
circumstances must be appropriate too. That is, the Italians to whom I make the gesture,
may understand that I am trying to insult them, but see my gesture as only funny—an
amusing attempt at insult by a silly American. We might say that the gesture did not ﬁt
the language game we were engaged in—there was no role for the gesture to play there.
Not only is it not the case that intentions and thoughts are insufﬁcient to give meaning to
language or, here, gestures, but these intentions and thoughts can be entirely absent and
yet the words or gestures can still be meaningful in conventional ways. For example, I am
engaged in a heated debate with Italian friends and, during a lull, I unknowingly make
an obscene gesture to the people I am talking to. Here I have neither the intention nor
the thought of insulting anyone, but the gesture, unintended though it is, still works in a
conventional way. The accidental insult works because there is a place for the expression
of insults—even by silly Americans—in the language game of arguing. In fact, even if I
plead that I did not intend the insult, my friends—soon to be ex-friends—may insist that,
unconsciously, I really did intend to insult them. Similar examples can be constructed using
words and phrases instead of gestures. Such inadvertent signiﬁcation is the substance of
much good ﬁction. It is the circumstances and context that surround language use that give
it meaning, not our intentions or the meanings that might be “running through our minds.”
This does not mean to say that intention has nothing to do with meaning, only that intention
is not the determiner of meaning. Intention certainly plays a role in meaning: when we
intendtoexpresssomemeaningfulcommunicationwethenlookfortheappropriatecontext

are too well hidden, and their discovery comes as something new.” From A Companion to Wittgenstein’s

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
181
and circumstances that will support that communication. But it is the circumstances, not
the intention that play the bigger role in determining meaning. These circumstances are
sometimes so dominant that they may even prevent an intended meaning no matter how
much the speaker/gesturer wishes it to be the case. Can the Pope or the Dalai Lama make
an obscene gesture? Can Saddam Hussein apologize to the Kurds? Probably not, no matter
what they say or do, or in what circumstances they do it.244
So the foundation of meaning in language cannot be exclusively grounded in conscious
thoughts or intentions. This is not to say that language does not, or cannot, have any
conscious accompaniment, nor is it meant to say that some language games may refer
exclusively to conscious thought (e.g., children might play a game in which they try to
guesswhateachotheristhinking).Thiscanhappen.It’sjustthat,ingeneral,theseconscious
accompaniments are not necessary for meaningful communication.245 We are not saying
that nothing mental happens when we, say, engage in some nonmental activity. We are
saying that nothing important to the understanding of that activity occurs in our conscious
mental processes. In fact, like our learning to pitch baseballs “in our imagination,” the
conscious accompaniments of the meaningful use of language follow our correct use of
language rather than precede it. Since language is grounded in instinctive behavior, and
such behavior is nonconscious, then whatever conscious accompaniment it may have is,
in Malcolm’s words, “a reﬁnement” of the behavior, and thereby follows it.
Still, one may be tempted to hypothesize that if language is not grounded in conscious
thought it must thereby be grounded in unconscious thought. But such a supposition
is no more tenable than the belief that language can be grounded in conscious thought.
Unconscious thought must, by deﬁnition, be similar in structure and dynamics to conscious
thought. If this is the case, then, why would we assume that unconscious thought can impart
any more meaning to language than conscious thought can? To do so it would have to
have properties very different than conscious thought, and it is not at all clear what those
properties would be. To my knowledge, no one has proposed that unconscious thought is
substantively different than conscious thought, other than, in Freudian terms, it is seen to
be more “objective” or “uncensored” than the conscious mind. The hypothesis that the
unconscious mind can somehow supply the meaning to language that the conscious mind
cannot, is to merely shift the quest for meaning to a mechanism—the unconscious—that
is even harder to investigate than conscious mental phenomena. In fact, the very difﬁculty
244It is interesting how circumstances can legitimate an expression. Lee Atwater, President Bush’s 1988 pres-
idential campaign director was the instigator of the vicious and misleading “Willie Horton” campaign ad that
contributed signiﬁcantly to Bush’s come-from-behind defeat of Michael Dukakis. A few years later, Atwater,
on his death-bed, asked Dukakis’ forgiveness for the ads. One wonders whether such a poignant request would
have been considered sincere had Atwater not been terminally ill.
245As we quoted before:
When I think in language, there aren’t “meanings” going through my mind in addition to the
verbal expressions: the language is itself the vehicle of thought. [PI §329]
An interesting position on the necessity of consciousness is presented by Julian Janes. He describes many human
activities which do not require consciousness, and asserts that for much of man’s early history, until about 3000
years ago, individuals were not conscious at all. [The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the
Bicameral Mind. Houghton Miﬂin, 1990 (Reprint)]

182
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
that we have investigating the unconscious serves those who hold its primacy in thought.
Since its character is so elusive to investigate, the unconscious can, hypothetically, fulﬁll
whatever requirements we might want that we don’t ﬁnd in the conscious mind. The belief
in the primacy of the unconscious mind is merely a disease of thinking grounded in the
assumption that all our intelligent acts must have their origin in some mental activity:
There is a kind of general disease of thinking which always looks for (and ﬁnds)
what would be called a mental state from which all our acts spring as from a
reservoir. [BB p. 143]
The belief in the unconscious as a foundation for thought and language shifts epistemol-
ogy in the wrong direction: deeper into our minds rather than out into the context and
circumstances where Wittgenstein feels it belongs.
Externalism
Wittgenstein’s distrust of meaning being a mental activity preﬁgures a more recent move-
ment in the philosophy of language and mind called “Externalism.” The beginnings of
Externalism, as a distinct movement in the philosophy of mind, ﬁnds its roots in Putnam’s
“Twin Earth” thought experiment.246 Putnam asked us to imagine that there was a “Twin
Earth” that was exactly like our own earth, even to the point of having a “twin” of every
person on this earth. But there was one aspect of Twin Earth that was different: on Twin
Earth they had a substance they called “water” which was exactly like our own water
except that instead of having a chemical structure H2O it had a different structure which
Putnam called “XYZ.” Except for the different chemical structure, Twin Earth water had
exactly the same function there as it does here: Twin Earthers drank it, washed in it, poured
it on their plants, and used it in squirt guns for amusement. Twin Earth “water” came out
of the sky in the form of rain, and large amounts of it formed rivers, lakes and oceans, just
like ours does. Since the Twin Earthers’ use of their “water” was exactly like our own use
of water, their conception of water, that is their idea of what it was and how it was used,
was exactly the same as our own idea of what we called “water.” In other words, what
the average Twin Earther had “in his head” about water was exactly the same as what we
have in our heads about our version of water. Yet, Putnam wrote, Twin Earth water was
different from our water because it had a different chemical structure (XYZ vs. H2O). For
Putnam the ineluctable conclusion of this thought experiment is that semantic meaning
is not entirely internal; at least part of the deﬁnition of what water is, is external to our
skulls because what we and the Twin Earthers have in our heads cannot distinguish our
water from Twin Earth water. As Putnam put it, “Cut the pie any way you like, ‘mean-
ings’ just ain’t in the head!” (Putnam (1975), p.144). Tyler Burge247 published an article
a few years after Putnam’s extending Putnam’s externalist interpretation of semantics to

include intentional mental states such as beliefs, desires, hopes and fears. Burge called
the internalist interpretation that he and Putnam criticized, “individualism.”
Although the Twin Earth thought experiment is entirely fanciful, similar phenomena occur
every day. In most categories there is a level of generality where different people will call
different things by the same name—for example, what I call a “sparrow” and another
person calls a “sparrow” might actually be different species of birds, even though they
have the same behavior, general appearance and habitat. Two women can have identical
appearing necklaces and thereby have the same mental conception of each’s jewelry.
But while one necklace is made of precious stones, the other is made of fake stones.
Again, what each woman has in her head is identical since both believe their jewelry is
genuine, but their respective necklaces are not actually the same. The Twin Earth thought
experiment has had a profound effect on philosophy over the last 3 decades. As Pessin
and Goldberg observed, “Twin Earth and ‘The Meaning of Meaning,’ the article in which
it became famous, comprise perhaps the most inﬂuential single philosophical episode in
the past half century.” (This quotation was taken from the preface of a valuable 20 year
retrospective collection of prominent articles written about Putnam’s Twin Earth thought
experiment [Pessin and Goldberg (eds), 1996, p. xi] See footnote 246).
Psychophysical Parallelism
Some of those who wish to ground meaning in our mind will not give up even when our
conscious and unconscious minds are shown to be untenable foundations for meaningful
activity. For these individuals, if meaning is not grounded in the conscious mind or the
unconscious mind, then it must be grounded even “deeper” in the biological strata of the
brain. This is a kind of mind–brain, or psychophysical, parallelism where whatever is in
the conscious or unconscious mind must have a corresponding process or structure in the
neurology of the brain. Malcolm; describes the beliefs of psychophysical parallelism:
According to the viewpoint of [psycho-physical] parallelism, for each thought,
sensation, or feeling there is a corresponding event, process, or state in or of the
brain (or central nervous system). For each difference in a thought or sensation,
there is a matching difference in the corresponding brain-occurrence. It should be
mentioned that even if a philosopher does not regard the word “mind” as a term
that designates a thing that thinks, he may still adopt the doctrine of parallelism.
A thought, decision, or intention is conceived of a non-material event or state, to
which there corresponds a brain-event or brain-state.248
Even when the cognitive foundations for language are not found in the conscious or
unconscious mind, it is easy to insist that they none-the-less exist tacitly in the neurological
structure or processes of our brains. To some, this must be the case, since meaning has to
be a mental event of some kind, and any mental event must have its origin and foundation
in neurological processes and structures. This belief in psychophysical parallelism is held
by both prominent philosophers and psychologists. Philosopher John Searle presents his
support of this theory quite clearly:
248N. Malcolm. Nothing is Hidden: Wittgenstein’s Criticism of his Early Thought, p. 183. Basil Blackwell,
Oxford, 1986.

184
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The brain is all we have for the purpose of representing the world to ourselves and
everything we can use must be inside the brain. Each of our beliefs must be possible
for a being who is a brain in a vat because each of us is precisely a brain in a vat;
the vat is a skull and the “messages” coming in are coming in by way of impacts
on the nervous system.249
The views of many psychologists resonate with Searle’s statement:
There are two theories of mind, speaking very generally. One is animistic, a theory
that the body is inhabited by an entity—the mind or soul—that is quite different
from it, having nothing in common with bodily processes. The second theory is
physiological or mechanistic; it assumes that mind is bodily process, an activity of
the brain. Modern psychology works with this latter theory only.250
Wittgenstein’s disagreement with this psychophysical parallelism comes in some of his
most striking statements:
One of the most dangerous of ideas for a philosopher is, oddly enough, that we
think with our heads or in our heads.
The idea of thinking as a process in the head, in a completely enclosed space, gives
him something occult.
Is thinking a speciﬁc organic process of the mind, so to speak—as it were chewing
and digesting in the mind? Can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulﬁlls
the same end, as it were use a prosthetic apparatus for thinking? How should we
have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought?
No supposition seems to me more natural than that there is no process in the brain
correlated with associating or with thinking; so that it would be impossible to read
off thought-processes from brain-processes. I mean this: if I talk or write there is,
I assume, a system of impulses going out from my brain and correlated with my
spoken or written thoughts. But why should the system continue further in the di-
rection of the centre? Why should this order not proceed, so to speak, out of chaos?
...
It is thus perfectly possible that certain psychological phenomena cannot be inves-
tigated physiologically, because physiologically nothing corresponds to them.
I saw this man years ago: now I have seen him again, I recognize him, I remember
his name. And why does there have to be a cause of this remembering in my nervous
system? Why must something or other, whatever it may be, be stored up there in
any form? Why must a trace have been left behind? Why should there not be a
psychological regularity to which no physiological regularity corresponds? If this
upsets our concept of causality then it is high time it was upset.

The prejudice in favour of psychophysical parallelism is a fruit of primitive in-
terpretations of our concepts. For if one allows a causality between psychological
phenomena which is not mediated physiologically, one thinks one is professing
belief in a gaseous mental entity.251 [Z §§610–611]
It is a travesty of the truth to say ‘Thinking is an activity of our mind, as writing is
of the hand’. (Love in the heart. The head and heart as loci of the soul.) [PG §64]
Meaning it is not a process which accompanies a word. For no process could have
the consequences of meaning. [PI p. 218]
If God had looked into our minds he would not have been able to see there whom
we were speaking of.252 [PI p. 217]
Malcolm; makes a number of more strident comments on Searle’s assertion:
. . . It makes as little sense to ascribe experiences, wishes, thoughts, beliefs, to a
brain as to a mushroom.
Searle says that each of us is a brain in a vat, the vat being one’s skull. Now if you
are your brain then you are inside your own skull. You cannot walk or talk or see
your friends. Searle says that you can receive “messages.” But in that predicament,
who wants messages?
Searle’s idea is amusing—but at the same time one feels dismayed by the fact that an
intelligent philosopher could assert such a view in all seriousness. It is a symptom
of a grave disarray in the philosophy of mind.253
251These paragraphs exist in Wittgenstein’s RPP I as §§903–906. They are identical except for the last sentence
of the penultimate paragraph and the last paragraph:
If this upsets our concepts of causality then it is high time they were upset.
The prejudice in favour of psycho-physical parallelism is also a fruit of the primitive concep-
tion of grammar. For when one admits a causality between psychological phenomena, which
is not mediated physiologically, one fancies that in doing so one is making an admission of
the existence of a soul alongside the body, a ghostly mental nature. [RPP I §§905–906]
The change from “primitive interpretations of our concepts” to “primitive conception of grammar” is of some
note.
It is ironic that Wittgenstein writes about “a prosthetic apparatus for thinking.” One senses that he mentions it
because of its very impossibility. Yet today, there are many who believe a computer is just such a device.
252Putnam comes to a similar conclusion:
. . . reference is socially ﬁxed and not determined by conditions or objects in individual
brains/minds. Looking inside the brain for the reference of our words is, at least in cases
of the kind we have been discussing, just looking in the wrong place. [H. Putnam. Represen-
tation and Reality, p. 25. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1996.]

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Wittgenstein comments on the related ability of understanding how to continue a mathe-
matical series when it is shown to us. Even here it is not necessary that there be a perceivable
mental process that accompanies or grounds such an ability:
If there has to be anything “behind the utterance of the formula” it is particular
circumstances, which justify me in saying I can go on—when the formula occurs
to me.
Try not to think of understanding as a “mental process” at all.—For that is the
expression which confuses you. But ask yourself: in what sort of case, in what kind
of circumstances, do we say, “Now I know how to go on,” when, that is, the formula
has occurred to me?—
In the sense in which there are processes (including mental processes) which are
characteristic of understanding, understanding is not a mental process.
(A pain’s growing more or less; the hearing of a tune or a sentence: these are mental
processes.) [PI §154]
For Wittgenstein, it is no more likely that we “think” with our “brains” than we “love” with
our “hearts.” If we hold some sort of psychophysical parallelism then our belief is in some
sense due to a failure of language. We are taking a metaphor—like “calculating in our
heads”—too literally.254 If we take as a “given” that we literally “calculate in our heads” and
do not ﬁnd conscious processes that always, necessarily accompany this ability, then we
will look for or postulate some tacit or unconscious processes that satisfy these conditions;
if these unconscious processes become untenable as a basis for calculating, then one is
tempted to “go deeper” and look for these processes in the physiology of the brain itself.
The fact that CAT scans and MRI’s of the brain show that “something” is going on in
speciﬁc regions of the brain when we calculate, seems to offer support that we are looking
in the right place for what we want. There is no denying that “something” must go on in the
brain while we are calculating (Wittgenstein would not deny this either), but that is a long
ways from believing that such brain activity is a complete explanation of what we mean
by “calculating.” This is an example of how a simple metaphor—“calculating/thinking
in our heads”—can not only mislead us about the location of such an ability, but also
misleads us about where to look when we don’t ﬁnd the ability where we expect it (i.e.,
it keeps us looking “in the head” when we don’t ﬁnd what we expect at ﬁrst). There is
no reason to believe that the neurological processes offer some kind of endpoint for this
sort of examination either. Neurons are made up of molecules, so if we do not ﬁnd the
foundation of intelligent activity in the neurology of the brain, we may be tempted to
suppose that the foundation of meaning that we seek is located at the molecular level.
Further, brain chemistry plays such an important role in neurological activity with neural
synapses facilitated or inhibited by the presence or absence of neurotransmitters such as
norepinephrine, dopamine or serotonin that if we do not ﬁnd the foundation of thought in
254This is the same problem with metaphor that Szasz described as the basis for the “myth of mental illness.”
That is, psychiatrists are confusing the metaphorical use of “illness” in “mental illness,” for the literal use of
“illness” in “physical illness.” See footnote 228.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
187
neurological structures, we may then be tempted to look for a chemical basis for cognition.
For Wittgenstein, we would be, both literally and ﬁguratively, deepening our error.
There are also intelligent activities that are not entirely thought-based. Driving a car,
for example. We may consciously think about how to drive when we are learning, but
at a certain point, we drive and make decisions with our body, and not just with our
mind. Certain reactions that we have while we drive, such a jamming on the brakes in an
emergency, can happen almost entirely at the body level—that is, feeling an unexpected
bump in the road in certain situations can cause us to perform a rapid action that happens
so fast that it is our body reacting to the stimulus rather than the body feeling the stimulus,
transmitting it to the brain which evaluates it and sends an emergency message back to
the relevant body parts for response. This happens when the doctor tests our “knee jerk”
reactions with a rubber hammer, so why can’t it plausibly happen at least some of the time
or, in part, for higher level bodily responses including those which are learned?
It is also the case that by linking thought processes to brain processes we are being
arbitrarily selective. Surely, there are other physical processes, besides brain processes,
that are necessary for thought. We need to eat nutritiously, get enough sleep and breathe
before we can do any thinking “in our heads.” Why, then, aren’t eating, sleeping, and
breathing, along with brain processes, part of the physiological basis for thought? And
why stop with just these bodily processes—there are myriad others that keep us alive.
Further, it is surely the case that such physical processes can inﬂuence how we think,
too, making their relation to thought even more compelling. If I have a stomachache or a
headache my thinking is likely to be less intense, perhaps even confused, especially if my
physical ailments are disturbing enough. Late in life, the great Swiss mathematician Euler
did some of his best mathematical work while relaxing in the evening after dinner. Do we
owe as much to Euler’s agreeable digestive system as we do to his brain for the brilliant
advances in mathematics he conceived? Let’s return to Wittgenstein’s striking example
(from the quotation above):
I saw this man years ago: now I have seen him again, I recognize him, I remember
his name. And why does there have to be a cause of this remembering in my nervous
system? Why must something or other, whatever it may be, be stored up there in
any form? Why must a trace have been left behind? Why should there not be a
psychological regularity to which no physiological regularity corresponds? If this
upsets our concept of causality then it is high time it was upset. [Z §610]
We have all had experiences of recognizing an old friend after a period of absence. How
do we do this? It is easiest to suppose that we have some kind of mental image of what
our friend looked like. We recognize our friend when we match our recollection of him
with those people we are currently looking at. It seems like we are just matching pictures,
though even this is not as straightforward as it ﬁrst appears. But is this all there is to it?
Wittgenstein doesn’t think so:
It is easy to have a false picture of the processes called “recognizing”; as if recog-
nizing always consisted in comparing two impressions with one another. It is as if
I carried a picture of an object with me and used it to perform an identiﬁcation of
an object as the one represented by the picture. [PI §604]

188
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
If recognition is simply a matter of matching a mental image with a visual one we should be
able to recognize our friend in any circumstances, given the time to make the comparison.
After all, comparing pictures should work anywhere and anytime, like extracting a picture
from your wallet or purse whenever you wanted to compare it to someone you meet. But
our memory doesn’t always work so predictably. That is, although we may recognize our
old friend at a high school reunion, we may not recognize him if he were to pass us on the
street. There is nothing inconsistent about this, we would say that while we would expect
to see our friend at the reunion, we would not expect to see him on the street (perhaps we
were under the impression that he lived in another city). In this situation, we might say
that we recognize our friend because of the circumstances in which he appears. So our
recollection then, is not simply the matching of a mental image with an individual we see,
but the matching of such an image in certain speciﬁc circumstances. There might be some
circumstances in which our friend appears where we would actually refuse to believe it is
our friend even though it looks just like him. For example, we might see a picture of him
being knighted by Queen Elizabeth, but surmise that she must be knighting someone who
looks like our friend, since we believe it to be impossible that he would ever be knighted by
the ruling British Monarch. Or, we may see him in a major Hollywood movie, but believe
that such an event to be impossible since he had never demonstrated a desire to act when
we knew him before. If our recollection of our friend were purely a matter of matching
what is in our heads with people we meet, then circumstances would have no inﬂuence
on the process. But circumstances clearly do have some inﬂuence, sometimes a dominant
inﬂuence. Further, even if we look just at the physical appearance of our friend, we ﬁnd
that our recollection of him can be strikingly different from his present appearance. Those
of us who have gone to school reunions decades after our graduation know that some of
our best friends can change not only in physical appearance—balder or fatter—but also in
the clothes they wear and even their mannerisms, opinions and tone of voice. And, more
importantly, they can change in ways that we do not anticipate at all. Yet in spite of these
clear changes in their appearance or mannerisms we often still recognize them. Some of
our recollections, then, are modiﬁed by our expectations of how our friend might have
changed. For example, if we haven’t seen our friend since high school, 25 years ago, we
might expect him to be heavier, balder and more conservatively dressed, but we would
not expect him to be shorter, or have blue eyes rather than brown. Our recognition of our
friend is not simply the matching of a mental image with someone we see because there
are circumstances and expectations that would alter how we might expect him to look. The
role of the mental image we have of our friend can have even a curious negative quality
about it. That is, if it has been sufﬁciently long since we last saw our friend we might
be reasonably sure that our friend does not look like our recollection of him. Confronted
with someone who looks exactly like our friend did 25 years ago, we might surmise that
we are looking at someone else, his son perhaps, but not him. And seeing our friend after
10 years would give rise to different expectations than if we saw him after 40 years. As
Wittgenstein observed:
Images tell us nothing, either right or wrong, about the external world (Images are
not hallucinations, nor yet fancies).
While I am looking at an object I cannot imagine it.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
189
Difference between the language-games: “Look at this ﬁgure!” and “Imagine this
ﬁgure!”
Images are subject to the will.
Images are not pictures. I do not tell what object I am imagining by the resemblance
between it and the image.
...
I might also have said earlier: The tie-up between imaging and seeing is close; but
there is no similarity.
The language-games employing these concepts are radically different—but hang
together.
A difference: “trying to see something” and “trying to form an image of something.”
In the ﬁrst case one says: “Look, just over there!,” in the second “Shut your eyes!”
It is just because forming images is a voluntary activity that it does not instruct us
about the external world.
What is imaged is not in the same space as what is seen. [Z §§621, 625–627]
So, while it is tempting to say that the way we recognize things is by comparing them to
a mental image, this explanation fails on a number of signiﬁcant points:
1. The mental image does not match reality in exact ways. At best, it is a rough copy.
2. If the image is a rough copy of reality, then there must be something—perhaps
rules—that governs the application of the image to what it purports to represent.
But, as the Nominalist will remind us, reality is inﬁnitely variable, so there must be
separate rules for the application of the image to each different reality. Since there
is an uncountable number of different realities that the image in question could
apply to, there must be a correspondingly uncountable number of rules governing
its application to reality. This, of course, is impossible.
3. An important part of the recognition process includes the particular circumstances
and context where the recognition takes place. Thus, the mental image by itself
could not be sufﬁcient for recognition. That is, the image alone does not explain
what is recognized.
4. Implicit in the activity of seeing something familiar is the assumption that it in-
volves the process of recognition. That is, we see something unfamiliar, and then
by exercising whatever mental abilities are appropriate we then come to recognize
the unfamiliar as familiar. This does happen sometimes, but most of the time we
just see things as familiar—I don’t see a strange car, then recognize it as my car, I
simply see my car.

190
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
5. Finally, and perhaps most decisively, if we look at the recognition process we see
that often, and for some a majority of the time, we have no conscious impression
of a mental image at all. When we see a friend we simply recognize him; as
Wittgenstein said:
If I have exhausted the justiﬁcations I have reached bedrock, and my spade
is turned. Then I am inclined to say: “This is simply what I do.”255 [PI §217]
Searle, et al., claim that:
The brain is all we have for the purpose of representing the world to ourselves and
everything we can use must be inside the brain. (supra)
If the claim “everything we can use [to represent the world] must be inside the brain” is
not taken to be trivially circular, then to refute it we need to identify something that “we
can use [to represent the world]” which is not “inside the brain.” Consider the following
example: many of us cannot make mathematical calculations without the aid of a pencil
and paper. Yet no matter how many times we write out our calculations we may never be
able to perform these calculations without a pencil and paper. In this case the brain cannot
255Some have claimed that the dearth of conscious images is merely because the necessary images are uncon-
scious rather than conscious. But this begs the question, substituting a supposition for a missing observation.
The weakness of such an assumption is apparent when we try to distinguish between knowledge with uncon-
scious images, knowledge without unconscious images and ignorance. Clearly there is no observable distinction
between knowledge with unconscious images and knowledge without them, so this distinction is untenable.
Wittgenstein makes a similar point.
Psychologist J. Shotter argues that there is a further reason to distrust strict psycho-physical parallelism.
[“Wittgenstein and Psychology: on our ‘Hook Up’ to Reality,” Wittgenstein Centernary Essays. Cambridge
University Press, Cambridge, 1991. Edited by A. Phillips Grifﬁths.]. Speciﬁcally, it has been asserted for some
time now that the recollection of a memory is not the retrieval of some memory trace that exists in detail in some
part of the brain. Rather, it is an unconscious process of retrieving the gist of a memory and then actively ﬁlling
out its details, thereby including information that the subject did not actually observe, but which may still be
correct.
In all ordinary instances [the person] has an overmastering tendency simply to get a general
impression of the whole; and, on the basis, of this, he constructs the probable detail. Very little
of his construction is literally observed and often, as was easily demonstrated experimentally,
a lot is distorted or wrong so far as the actual facts are concerned. But it is the sort of
construction which serves to justify his general impression. [F. Bartlett. Remembering: A
Study in Experimental Psychology, p. 206. Cambridge University Press, London, 1932.
Quoted in Shotter, op.cit, p. 204]
Further, CAT scans and MRI’s have shown that the recollection of a simple memory often consists of utilizing two
or more different parts of the brain, indicating that the memory must be somehow constructed, or reconstructed,
from more than one physical element. This reconstructive recollection may be part of the reason that false
memories can be rather easily induced for some subjects, even when the memory conﬂicts with their initial
recollection [“Creating False Memories.” Scientiﬁc American, pp. 70–75. September 1997. See also, Memory
Distortion: How Minds, Brains and Societies Reconstruct the Past. Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
1995. Edited by D.L. Schacter, et al.; and, E. Loftus and K. Ketcham’s The Myth of Repressed Memory, 1994,
St. Martin’s Press, New York]. That is, since recollection is, in part, reconstruction, slight alterations in relatively
insigniﬁcant cues may cause a subject to recall, that is reconstruct, something that did not actually take place,
or did not take place in the way remembered.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
191
get along without the pencil and paper for the obvious reason that if you take the pencil
and paper away, we cannot calculate, no matter what is in our brain or how many times we
performed the calculation before. Here we have a case where the claim “everything we
can use must be in the brain” is not true—here we cannot represent the process of addition
by means of the brain itself. The brain is no substitute for pencil and paper.
Getting back to our example of recognizing an old friend, is there anything outside of the
brain that might be necessary for this recognition to take place? Surely the context and
circumstances in which the recognition takes place are important. Context and circum-
stances are outside the brain, and we cannot recognize our friend without being in the
right circumstances. Like our math example, we cannot remove the appropriate context
and circumstances and still expect to recognize our friend. Thus, some or all of the context
and circumstances must be there for the recognition to take place—the brain is simply not
able to take in everything it needs to perform the recognition correctly. I am not deny-
ing that the brain may abstract something from the circumstances that might help in the
recognition process. But what it abstracts will often not be enough for it to perform the
recognition without physically being in the appropriate context and circumstances. Now
we can see what Wittgenstein was getting at when he said, “. . . why does there have to be
a cause of this remembering in my nervous system?” (supra). There can’t be a “cause of
this remembering in my nervous system” because much of what enables us to remember
our friend is in the circumstances we ﬁnd ourselves. Whatever we have “in our heads” that
enables us to recognize our friend is, in itself, incomplete, adumbrative. Not only that, the
circumstances where we might see our friend may vary considerably, and our expectations
of what he might look like, and even our desire to see him may vary from time to time
(based on how long it has been since we saw him, what mutual friends might have told us or
how preoccupied I might be with something else at the time). It may be the case that what
we have “in our heads” that enables us to recognize our friend is in constant ﬂux. What is
constant about our ability to recognize an old friend is not something “in our head”; what
is constant is our ability to recognize our friend—as Malcolm and Wittgenstein put it so
well: “nothing is hidden.”
Wittgenstein is not saying that there are no mental processes at all accompanying conscious
intellectual activities. He is saying that the conscious accompaniments that may occur are
not necessary, and, if they do not occur in the conscious mind they cannot be replaced by
unconscious mental activity. But surely something goes on in the brain when we perform
meaningful activities like speech. Wittgenstein does not deny this, he merely says that any
analysis of these processes would not give us an explanation of how we use language:
But you surely cannot deny that, for example, in remembering, an inner process
takes place.—What gives the impression that we want to deny anything? When one
says “Still, an inner process does take place here”—one wants to go on: “After all,
youseeit.”Anditisthisinnerprocessthatonemeansbytheword“remembering.”—
The impression that we wanted to deny something arises from our setting our faces
against the picture of the “inner process.” What we deny is that the picture of the
inner process gives us the correct idea of the use of the word “to remember.” We
say that this picture with its ramiﬁcations stands in the way of our seeing the use
of the word as it is.

192
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Why should I deny that there is a mental process? But “There has just taken place in
me the mental process of remembering. . . ” means nothing more than: “I have just
remembered. . . ” To deny the mental process would mean to deny the remembering:
to deny that anyone ever remembers anything.
“Are you not really a behaviorist in disguise? Aren’t you at bottom really saying
that everything except human behavior is ﬁction?”—If I do speak of ﬁction, then
it is a grammatical ﬁction.256 [PI §§305–307]
Thisissimilartotheactofpitching,whichwediscussedpreviously,wherethereareobvious
“inner processes” that are a necessary part of the pitching activity (e.g., the contracting
and relaxing of muscles in a speciﬁc sequence during the pitching movements). Many of
these “inner processes” are also controlled by the nonconscious brain, but none is relevant
to any conscious mental part of pitching.

psychologist, the view that dominates the mainstream of modern psychology [Shotter]:
The mainstream [of psychology] is following through all the implications of what it
calls “the cognitive revolution”; the idea that everything intelligent we do involves
a “cognitive process” working in terms of “inner” mental representations of the
“external” world, and that the way to study such processes is by modeling them in
computational terms.

the current “cognitive” orientation in psychology is radically misconceived, and the
idea, that computer models are relevant to the understanding of human activities,
will eventually lose its credibility . . . 257

258In rejecting the picture theory of meaning, Wittgenstein is rejecting a view that he himself held and was
the cornerstone of his early philosophy which he developed in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Here,

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
193
Wittgenstein’s view of language was that it’s main purpose was to represent “facts.” This was a common belief
in early 20th century analytic philosophy, so Wittgenstein was not alone. Bertrand Russell wrote in his preface
to the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus that the “business of language is to assert or deny facts” [TLP p. x]. In
the Tractatus. . . Wittgenstein writes:
The world is all that is the case. [TLP 1]
The world is the totality of facts, not things. [TLP 1.1]
We make ourselves pictures of facts. [TLP 2.1]
A picture is a model of reality. [TLP 2.12]
In a picture the elements of the picture are the representation of objects. [TLP 2.131]
The fact that the elements of a picture are related to one another in a determinate way represents
that things are related to one another in the same way. [TLP 2.15]
Pictorial form is the possibility that things are related to one another in the same way as the
elements of the picture. [TLP 2.151]
That is how a picture is attached to reality; it reaches right out to it. [TLP 2.1511]
[The picture] is laid against reality like a measure. [TLP 2.1512]
Such a perspective is mirrored in more recent work in psychology by Johnson-Laird:
. . . the psychological core of understanding. . . consists in your having a “working model” of
the phenomenon [you are concerned with] in your mind. [Mental Models, p. 2. Cambridge
University Press, Cambridge, 1983.]
Wittgenstein came to reject this view, referring to it as part of his “old way of thinking” [PI, preface]. He rejected
it for two principal reasons: First, the link between the picture and reality is not a simple correlation since pictures
are always open to interpretation. Secondly, the role of language is not just to represent “facts”—it has myriad
other uses. As Wittgenstein comments:
But how many kinds of sentences are there? Say assertation, question, and command?—There
are countless kinds; countless different kinds of use of what we call “symbols” “words,” “sen-
tences.” And this multiplicity is not something ﬁxed, given once for all; but new types of
language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become ob-
solete and get forgotten (We can get a rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.).
Here the term “language-game” is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking
of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.
Review the multiplicity of language-games in the following examples, and in others:
Giving orders, and obeying them—
Describing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements—
Constructing an object from a description (a drawing)—
Reporting an event—
Speculating about an event—
Forming and testing a hypothesis—
Presenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams—
Making up a story; and reading it—
Play-acting—
Singing catches—
Guessing riddles—
Making a joke; telling it—
Solving a problem in practical arithmetic—
Translating from one language into another—
Asking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.
—It is interesting to compare the multiplicity of the tools in language and of the ways they are used,
the multiplicity of kinds of word and sentence, with what logicians have said about the structure of
language. (Including the author of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.) [PI §23]

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
our own thoughts, and even if we assume that we have it, but in some kind of tacit or
otherwise inaccessible form, we still must explain how we can apply it to reality.259 A
model of reality would, like a picture, stand in need of interpretation so it could be linked
to reality, consequently, we would need a set of rules, or some similar device, to perform
this interpretation. For example, we might have a general mental model of a tree that, it is
said, might be used to help us identify real trees. But each tree that we see is unique, as the
nominalist says. So we would not just need a set of rules to apply the model of a tree to a
tree in reality, but we would have to have a slightly different set of rules to apply the tree
mental model to every different individual tree we might possibly encounter. Without this
ability, we would not be able to classify many unique objects, as even a child can. But for
computational reasons, we probably could not work out all the possible rules that might
enable us to apply a general mental model of a tree in every case, for we would not have
mental models for just trees, but for all the myriad categories that we need to distinguish
in reality—trees, bushes, dogs, birds, cars, bicycles, furniture, wine, mushrooms, rugs,
etc. If our minds were busy working out all the rules for applying the mental models or
images we have to all the possible unique cases of classiﬁcation in reality, our minds would
no doubt be totally preoccupied in this task, leaving little capacity to do anything else.
If propositions are not pictures of facts, what are they? Wittgenstein sidesteps this question by considering, not
what a proposition is, but how would you explain what sense it has.
When I ask “What sense does it make?”—I want someone to answer me not with a picture or
a series of pictures, but with the description of situations. [RPP I §132]
It is not the photographer who captures reality, but the playwright.
259I will not address the issue here of “tacit knowledge,” though we might reject any theory of mental models
on the basis of the untenability of such knowledge. As Baker and Hacker put it:
The questions of what distinguishes tacit knowledge from explicit knowledge on the one hand,
and of what distinguishes tacit knowledge from ignorance on the other, must be answered
coherently. For it is far from obvious that theorists’ use of the term “tacit knowledge”’ is
intelligible. Like Locke’s notion of tacit consent, tacit knowledge may be no more than a
device for tacitly burying problems raised by the theory itself. If we are to ascribe tacit
knowledge of a theory of meaning to a person there must be something that will reveal the
difference between tacitly knowing the theory and total ignorance of it, something other than
the mere fact of the speaker’s correct discourse. If his correct discourse is all that shows his
tacit knowledge and incorrect discourse is all that shows ignorance, then the hypothesis that
he can produce and understand sentences because of such tacit knowledge is both untestable
and vacuous. [G.P. Baker and P.M.S. Hacker. Language, Sense and Nonsense: A Critical
Investigation into Modern Theories of Language, p. 341. Basil Blackwell, New York,
1984.]
Baker and Hacker are speciﬁcally addressing the assertion—popularized by Chomsky—that “. . . the speaker of
a language has tacit knowledge of the theory of meaning.” However, their comments apply to all notions of “tacit
knowledge.” [Op.cit. p. 340] [vid. N. Chomsky. Rules and Respresentations. Blackwell, London, 1980.] As
Wittgenstein put it:
Philosophy simply puts everything before us, and neither explains nor deduces anything.—
Since everything lies open to view there is nothing to explain. For what is hidden, for example,
is of no interest to us. [PI §126]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
195
Further, it is not clear at all where all these rules would come from, or how they might be
applied.
But suppose, it is countered, that we do not have precise mental models or images that are
in constant need of rules to apply them in exceptional cases. Suppose we have “rough”
mental models or images that can “ﬁt” a lot of applications without requiring them to
ﬁt exactly (and hence not requiring special rules to adapt to every case). This is similar
to Rosch’s “basic level” of abstraction, around which we supposedly organize many of
the categories we use in everyday life.260 But this doesn’t help us either because even
though our “rough” mental model can be applied more efﬁciently to large numbers of
unique objects, there would still need to be rules, or some method, that would enable us
to determine whether the “rough” ﬁt is adequate in each case. And some of the properties
of a tree can be very loose (like the number of leaves it might have or its height) and
others might be very precise (like whether is needs sap or bark). To distinguish which
properties can ﬁt loosely and which must be precise, and, further, in what way they must
be precise or can be loose, throws us back into the situation where we need increasingly
more information to match the model with an ever-expanding reality of individual cases. In
short, there are likely to be just as many ways that a “rough” model of a tree can be applied
to actual cases as there are ways for a more precise model to be applied. Both situations—
the precise model and the “rough” model—must be adapted to an uncountable number of
possible cases. The “rough” model does not really save us any effort when we consider all
the possible situations in which the model might be matched with reality. Trying to say
that “rough” mental models require fewer adaptive cases and rules than “more precise”
mental models might is like saying that there are fewer even integers than there are odd
and even integers—yet, as is well known to mathematicians, the set of even integers can
be mapped one-to-one onto the set of all integers, meaning that from the point of view of
denumerability, neither set is greater than the other. Paradoxically, there are just as many
even integers as there are odd and even integers. Similarly, when dealing with unlimited
sets of unique objects in reality we are faced with the paradox that there are likely to be,
at least from a practical point of view, just as many exceptions to the application of a
general mental model as there are variations of more precise mental models. Nothing is
saved by the “rough” model over the precise one. There are other inconsistencies with
“rough” mental models. For example, there are multiple criteria for “rough” ﬁtting, and
these criteria are not based on how, in our example, the tree ﬁts a formal model or image
in the mind, but on how the tree identiﬁcation might be used in particular circumstances
and for different purposes. For example, the precision of ﬁt for tree identiﬁcation for a
botanist might be very different than that of a casual hiker. And this may vary with different
situations too: the botanist who needs to fell a small tree to help him cross a stream in a
hurry is not going to care this time what type of tree it is, but whether it satisﬁes some
general “tree across the stream” properties; and these properties might have little to do
with what the botanist might normally look at in a tree. But just like our problem with
applying rough and precise mental models to reality, it is clear that any set of rules that
might permit a botanist to select a good candidate tree for bridging a stream could not be
unambiguously interpreted themselves in every type of circumstance; consequently, these
260E. Rosch. (Cited in The Literary Mind, by M. Turner).

196
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
rules would require further rules to insure their correct application in other cases—in one
case, the botanist must fell a tree to make a bridge across a small stream, in another, he
must fell a tree to cross a large raging torrent, in another the best possible trees grow too
far away from the stream, so a compromise must be reached; in another case his axe breaks
limiting his cutting ability, in another he sprains his wrist while chopping, etc., etc. This
leads us again into the potentially inﬁnite regress of rules for the application of rules to
each new case, etc.261 Wittgenstein states the issue more succinctly:
. . . the idea of “agreement with reality” does not have any clear application.
[OC §215]
Wittgenstein is quite clear about his disagreement with the use of mental images to provide
an understanding of reality. He says that if we look at what we remember when we recall
something we ﬁnd that we don’t have a very precise picture of the desired object.
If I say “I saw a chair in this room,” I can mostly recall the particular visual
impression only very roughly, nor does it have any importance in most cases. The
use that is made of the sentence bypasses this particular feature. [Z §25]
But, it could be countered, a mental model is likely to be a more complex entity than
a mental picture or image. Consider a structured, intelligent activity—ﬁnding one’s way
around a city. We have all probably done something like this at one time or another. We
can do it, do it well, do it in some circumstances and not in others, or, perhaps, not be able
to do it all. But if we look at our ability to ﬁnd our way around a city, even when we are
particularly good at it, we notice a curious inconsistency. Wittgenstein comments:
It could very well be imagined that someone knows his way around a city perfectly,
i.e. would conﬁdently ﬁnd the shortest way from any place in it to any other,—and
yet would be quite incompetent to draw a map of the city. That, as soon as he tries,
he produces nothing that is not completely wrong. [Z § 121]
If our subject truly had a working model of reality, the city, in his head—a “mental map,”
as the metaphor might suggest—then he should be able to reproduce it, at least in its
essential features.262 The fact that he often cannot means that he does not need to have
261For a more detailed discussion of the problem of rules, see, “The Structure of Language” in my book Language
and Representation in Information Retrieval, pp. 149ff. Elsevier Science, 1990.
262The persistence of the “mental map” metaphor is remarkable even though we have no real evidence that it truly
models what is in our minds. Some cognitive psychologists take the existence of a mental map as the assumed
foundation for research rather than an object for veriﬁcation itself. Consider UCLA’s Dr. Bruce Gallistel, “a
leading authority on animal navigation” who is reported to claim that “Most animals have a rudimentary mental
map of the world encoded in nerve tissue that helps them ﬁgure out how and where to move. . . ” [from “Navigating
Life’sMaze:StylesSplitTheSexes,”TheNewYorkTimes,May26,1992,p.B1].Insuchasituation,psychologists
are making the same mistake that Szasz claims psychiatrist’s make when they take the metaphor “mental illness”
literally, or that Malcolm claims philosophers make when they take the metaphor of thoughts and feelings being
“in the head” too literally (see quotation at footnote 229). It’s not hard to see how a psychologist can make this
mistake. When we want to ﬁnd our way we generally use a map. This works very well. So when animals can
somehow ﬁnd their way across difﬁcult geography, or when people do it intuitively, it is easy to infer that the
external process is a model for the internal process. What else could it be? By claiming that the “mental map” is
in the “nerve tissue” of the animal, and, by inference, in the people who can orient themselves without maps or
conscious thought, Dr. Gallistel has removed the model of a “mental map” from empirical investigation. It also

197
such an exact mental model or even a mental model at all. Some might counter that the
subject has the representation but may not be a good enough illustrator to reproduce it. But
surely he could reproduce it with simple drawings that are within his capability (i.e., while
the drawing might not be exact, it would clearly have the necessary detail and be correct
in what it does represent). But in most cases, he cannot even do this. If our subject has no
mental model of reality that stands behind such simple skills as ﬁnding his way around a
city, where does he get his ability to do this? Where is the information that enables him to
drive around the city? The information about the city is certainly available to the subject,
but it is not the kind of literal or predictive mental model that many want. In short, our
subject does not need a mental model of the city to ﬁnd his way around because he already
has the city “out there.” In other words, why do you need to make a model of something
that you already have? It would be like insisting that in order to read the map before our
eyes we must have a copy of the map in our heads, in the same way that, as Malcolm
pointed out, some assume erroneously that we must calculate in our heads before we can
calculate on paper. Surely, Ockham’s Razor is needed here. This is what Wittgenstein was
getting at when he stated:
Images tell us nothing, either right or wrong, about the external world. (Images are
not hallucinations, nor yet fancies).
While I am looking at an object I cannot imagine it. [Z §621]
The mental image is not only unnecessary as a correlative to something real, it, according
to Wittgenstein, cannot even be brought up at all when the object it might represent is
present. Reality, it seems, precludes the imagination.263
Getting back to our subject ﬁnding his way around the city, all he needs in addition to
the city itself, is such things like an ability to see parts of the city as familiar as he drives
around, an ability to tell which direction he is going, some general understanding of how
streets are usually laid out in cities (i.e., that numbered streets lie parallel to each other
in numerical order, or that street names do not usually change with each passing cross
street—and this additional information can vary greatly in kind and amount, as can the
driver’s skill in using it). Our subject cannot recall a detailed map of the city, but he can
recognize the right ways to turn as he drives around in the city. In fact, the presence of the
city is a prerequisite for his recollection of how to ﬁnd his way—without the city he cannot
“remember” how to get around. Those of us who have lived in a large metropolitan area
realize that it is not unusual for us to be able reliably to drive a complex route of many turns
conveniently explains why we can’t ﬁnd it when we look for it in the conscious mental processes of well-oriented
individuals. While the idea of a “mental model” appears to be an empirical claim, it is in actuality a somewhat
dogmatic assumption. We don’t have to have “mental maps” to orient ourselves in the same way that we don’t
have to ﬂy the same way that birds do if we want to build machines that ﬂy. The belief that we must ﬂy like birds,
if we are to ﬂy at all, hindered the early development of powered, heavier-than-air ﬂight craft. Perhaps the use of
metaphors such as “mental models” to explain how we understand things is a “disease of thinking” that holds
back cognitive psychology in the same way that Szasz and Wittgenstein claim that psychiatry and epistemology
are held back by the literal interpretation of metaphors such as “mental illness” and “thinking in our heads,”
respectively.
263It is not too farfetched to suppose that when the imagination can substitute for, replace or alter real perceptions
we would have a pathological mental state of some kind: psychosis or drug-induced hallucination.

198
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
across the city, but to not be able to tell, in sufﬁcient detail, someone else how to drive the
same way. Some of us, through practice may learn to be able to give detailed directions of
this kind (a tour guide might develop this ability). But such a detailed descriptive ability
is not a necessary condition of the ability to ﬁnd one’s way about in a reliable manner,
nor is it a latent ability that we can learn to make explicit. Since the presence of the city
is often a prerequisite for remembering how to get around, Searle’s claim that “the brain
is all we have for the purpose of representing the world to ourselves and everything we
can use must be inside the brain” (supra) cannot be right. If “everything we can use must
be inside the brain” then our recollection of how to get around the city would be just as
reliable whether the city is there or not. But it isn’t. Therefore “everything we can use” is
not in the brain.
It is also the case that two individuals who can ﬁnd their way around a large city may do it
in quite different ways. That is, they may differ greatly in the details that they keep in mind,
and differ also in the landmarks which they use as guides to following the same route.
What is the same between two individuals is not some mental phenomena that enable
them to get across town, but their ability to get across town. Again, Wittgenstein pushes
our focus away from “inner mental processes” and towards the “outer” abilities that we
have: “The uncertainty about the inner is an uncertainty about something outer” [LWPP
II p. 88]. Our mistake is that we try to explain our “outer” abilities by resorting to some
“inner/mental processes”—this is our “disease of thinking”: “There is a kind of general
disease of thinking which always looks for (and ﬁnds) what would be called a mental state
from which all our acts spring as from a reservoir” [BB p. 143]. Our “outer” abilities don’t
need explaining, Wittgenstein insists, they are “. . . simply what [we] do” [PI §217]. “What
has to be accepted, the given, is—so one could say—forms of life” [PI p. 226].
One of the central questions in epistemology concerns the relationship between mental
phenomena or processes and the ability to do things. Cognitive Science concentrates
primarily on “mental processes/mental models,” assuming that people who can do the
same things must have identical mental processes from which these actions “spring as
from a reservoir.” Wittgenstein rejects this and asserts that the only thing people who
can do the same thing have in common is the ability to do the same thing. They do not
have the same mental processes lying behind these abilities or somehow instigating them.
To disprove this assumption, Wittgenstein only has to show that there are cases where
people who can do the same things have different things going on in their minds, or that
they don’t have anything going on in their minds. For Wittgenstein, positing a “mental
model” as a basis for being able to perform intelligent activities does not add anything to
our understanding of these processes. Such a theory can be misleading, too.264 This false
264It may be the case that even from a physiological point of view there may be important differences in the
ways that the same ability or function may be instantiated at the neuronal level. Merlin Donald writes:
Classical neuropsychology has tended to assume that localization of [cognitive] function
follows a roughly similar course in each individual, provided gender and handedness are
taken into account. But this principle is almost certainly wrong, given the competitive mat-
urational environment of neurons at the microbiological level and the tremendous culturally
programmed changes in environmental patterning of the brain on the psychological level.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
199
assumption that common mental processes underly our common intelligent abilities, is
what Wittgenstein was getting at with the following statement:
It is sometimes said that animals do not talk because they lack the mental capacity.
And this means: “they do not think, and that is why they do not talk.” But—they
simply do not talk. Or to put it better: they do not use language. . . 265 [PI §25]
. . . the degree of consistency across individuals that has been assumed in neuropsychology
may not exist in tertiary cortical regions at all. This might be expressed as the principle of
singularity: the individual human brain develops a unique functional organization at the rep-
resentational level. This has serious implications for optimal research strategies in neuropsy-
chology; at the very least, it is a very strong argument in favor of the single-case approach.
The regions of the brain that are most characteristically human—especially the great expanses
of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes—are likely to be the most malleable neurological
structures in nature, taking on many forms. They are conﬁgurable and reconﬁgurable to a
remarkable degree, because their resources are allocated on a competitive basis to the many
input paths impinging on them. In effect, the physical structure of mind has become less and
less ﬁxed as neocortical evolution has progressed. This leaves room not only for the kinds
of radical reconﬁguration introduced by literacy but also (presumably) for larger differences
between the brains of individual human beings than are possible in primates. It also leaves
room for further cognitive restructuring, possibly in fundamental ways. [M. Donald. Origins
of the Modern Mind: Three Stages in the Evolution of Culture and Cognition, p. 380.
Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991. Italics are in the original text.]
In his discussion of “neurological indeterminacy,” Donald makes use of the work of Edelman [Neural Darwin-
ism. Basic Books, NY, 1987]:
Most of the greatly expanded cortical regions in the human brain. . . receive great quantities
of highly digested inputs from all over the brain. They lack a single genetically entrenched
dominant input path; therefore, in theory, maturational competition could produce a wide
variety of different “wiring” schemes in tertiary regions, depending on the patterns of early
experience. In principle, this would create an opportunity for considerable individual vari-
ability in the functional organization of the adult neocortex.
. . . Edelman [op.cit.] has considered this issue in detail and has proposed a theory of com-
petitive neuronal group selection, which he calls “neural Darwinism.” In his conception of
neuronal genesis, there is room for a great deal of individual variability in neuronal organi-
zation; in fact, it is an essential feature of his system. No two animals will evolve the same
nervous system, not even during the earliest stages of development. [Donald, op.cit., p. 379]
We can now see that we have an ineluctable cognitive variability on at least two levels: on the conscious level,
when we actively use different cues and heuristics to perform the same task as others do, and at the neuronal level
where the ability to perform conscious and nonconscious tasks is instantiated. Clearly there is ample evidence
for the cognitive variability that Wittgenstein describes in the brain and the mind.
265The idea that speech is a criterion for thought goes back a long ways in western epistemology. Thomas Hobbes
wrote:
Whenaman,uponthehearingofanyspeech,hasthosethoughtswhichthewordsofthatspeech
and their connection were ordained and constituted to signify, then he is said to understand it,
understanding being nothing else but conception caused by speech. And therefore if speech
be peculiar to man, as for aught I know it is, then is understanding peculiar to him also.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The fact that an animal cannot talk is not evidence that it cannot think, it is simply evidence
that it cannot talk—nothing is hidden. The fact that two individuals can drive a complex
route across a large city is not evidence that they have the same “mental model,” or set of
mental processes, as some might insist, it is merely evidence that they both have the same
ability to drive across town. What each of these individuals has “in mind” to enable him
to drive across town is probably quite different from what the other has “in mind,” even
when they drive the same route. Each individual would have a complex combination of
highly subjective “mental jottings,” or notes, combined with an ability to recognize certain
features of the landscape as familiar (e.g., although they all turn left at the same place,
one individual turns left at the “third stoplight after the exit from the highway,” the other
turns left “across from the dry cleaners on Cedar street,” a third individual turns left where
it “just feels like he should”). The “mental jottings” that we might have that enable us to
follow the route across town, might be like the written jottings of a student listening to a
lecture. Wittgenstein comments:
Imagine the following phenomenon. If I want someone to take note of a text that I
recite to him, so that he can repeat it to me later, I have to give him paper and pencil;
and while I am speaking he makes lines, marks, on the paper; if he has to reproduce
the text later he follows those marks with his eyes and recites the text. But I am
assuming that what he has jotted down is not writing, it is not connected by rules
with the words of the text; yet without these jottings he is unable to reproduce the
text; and if anything in it is altered, if part of it is destroyed, he gets stuck in his
“reading” or recites the text uncertainly or carelessly, or cannot ﬁnd the words at
all.—This can be imagined!—What I called jottings would not be a rendering of
the text, not so to speak a translation with another symbolism. The text would not
be stored up in the jottings. And why should it be stored up in our nervous system?
[Z §612]
We can imagine a student taking actual notes in the way that students normally do during a
lecture—that is, the notes may include actual words as well as any other marks or symbols
the student ﬁnds useful. The notes are not an exact reproduction of the lecture, yet by
means of them plus some background knowledge and understanding the student may be
able reproduce the lecture in detail; and another student, with a different set of jottings, may
be able to reproduce the lecture just as accurately as the ﬁrst student. Clearly, two students
don’t need the same “jottings” (mental or actual) in order to reproduce the lecture. In fact,
it is unlikely that any two students would, independently, have the same jottings for the
same lecture even if they tried. The rejoinder to this example might be that the combination
of the written lecture jottings plus what is in the student’s head would be a literal copy
of the lecture. But it can be shown that this is not the case either, for recapitulating the
lecture does not have to be like reading a literal copy. Much of what we do when we recall
something is inferential or reconstructive in nature. That is, I begin by stating, from literal
memory, the speaker’s opening few sentences, but then, because I know the “gist” of his
lecture, I can infer what he says next because “it follows” from his opening statements.
I may jot down a word or phrase in my notes, not because it is a complete rendition of
what was said, but because it recalls for me an “old joke” or hackneyed story that I know
already and can reconstruct in the style and emphasis that the speaker would have told the
story (i.e., I not only know the story, but I can ﬁt it into the speaker’s talk because I know
the speaker’s aim or point in using it). It follows that much of what we call memory is not

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
201
literal recall, but a complex and often idiosyncratic process of reconstruction. If we had a
literal copy of a talk in our heads, would we really have remembered the talk? I think that
Wittgenstein would say no. The exact copy of the talk (a kind of mental image of text that
we could read like a book) would fail to do what we want in the same way that a picture or
any other literal representation fails to have an unambiguous interpretation. A literal text
is like a “picture” of the talk and, like any picture, can be taken in more than one way. See
how different the meanings of three copies of the same literal sentence, “John stole the
money,” are when the emphasis is on “John” in the ﬁrst case, “stole” in the second, and
“money” in the third:
“John stole the money.” (i.e., I thought it was Bill, but found out to my surprise
that it was John)
“John stole the money.” (i.e., I thought John borrowed the money, but it turned
out that he stole it)
“John stole the money.” (i.e., John was supposed to steal the jewelry, not the
money)
Missing also from the literal text are the tone and pacing of the talk, the speaker’s gestures
and facial expressions, not to mention his beliefs or point of view as evidenced by his
previous talks or writings. The student may use these too, in order to “read between the
lines” of the talk (what the naive listener takes as literal, the informed listener may see as
facetious or allegorical). In fact, the less we “understand” a lecture, the more literal we
must be in our recollection, and we can memorize by rote what we do not understand at all
(even such a literal rendering of the lecture, as we noted before, may not be a “complete”
or accurate rendering of what the speaker wanted to convey—imagine what would be
“missing” from Martin Luther King’s invigorating “I have a dream” speech if we were to
hear it recited in a quiet monotone).266
If much of our knowledge is “out there” rather than in our heads, why don’t we see it?
Wittgenstein says that we often cannot see what is right before our eyes.
The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because of their
simplicity and familiarity (One is unable to notice something—because it is always
before one’s eyes.). The real foundations of his enquiry do not strike a man at all.
Unless that fact has at some time struck him.—And this means: we fail to be struck
by what, once seen, is most striking and most powerful. [PI §129]
If it is asked: “How do sentences manage to represent?”—the answer might be:
“Don’t you know? You certainly see it, when you use them.” For nothing is con-
cealed. [PI §435]
...
Here it is easy to get into that dead-end philosophy, where one believes that the
difﬁculty of the task consists in this: our having to describe phenomena that are
266Autistic or similarly afﬂicted individuals who have what is called “savant syndrome,” can memorize, seemingly
without effort, incredible amounts of text, sometimes without the ability to understand it at all. [O. Sacks.

hard to get hold of, the present experience that slips quickly by, or something of
the kind. [PI §436]
We don’t have a need to internalize our knowledge any more than we have a need to
memorize the contents of our libraries. We don’t need to memorize the books in libraries,
except in special circumstances, because whenever we need the information in the library
we simply go there and look it up. As Samuel Johnson once observed, “Knowledge is of
two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can ﬁnd information on
it.”267 Our surrounding context and circumstances, like the library, can be the repository
for much of the everyday information and knowledge we need to use, so we don’t have to
remember it literally. If we can go to the library for written information, why can’t we “go
to” our surroundings for some of our everyday information? As Malcolm comments:
The world is represented to us in history books and maps, drawings and diagrams,
newspapers, novels, paintings, plays and music.268
Some of our problem in seeing that much of what we “know” exists outside our heads is
that it is difﬁcult for us to see how this knowledge or information is often subtly embedded
in the circumstances that surround what we do. In large part, we have a blind spot about
this essential source of our knowledge because we have no way of describing it—and if we
can’t describe it, it is hard to be aware of it (vid. earlier section Language and Thought).
Why don’t we have the general ability to describe this knowledge that is embedded in our
surroundings, circumstances and practices? That’s simple, we don’t need to. A language
game for describing these surroundings, circumstances and practices, and the knowledge
embedded in them, is not generally available to us (although there may be activities that
would require such linguistic ability—say the work of anthropology or sociology, for
example. The necessary language games may grow out of those activities). Our difﬁculty
seeing the importance circumstances, surroundings and practices for language is a direct
consequence of a faulty view of how language works. If we believe that language is learned
by explanation and deﬁnition, we will look for the deﬁnitions and explanations which must
be used in this process. Not ﬁnding them, we refuse to give them up, and so we hypothesize
that they must be part of some hidden mental processes.269 We believe that the deﬁnitions
and explanations are there, but merely latent or hidden. But all we need to understand

Oxford, 1986.
269The belief in “false consciousness” and the hiddenness of some of our thoughts is particularly strong in 20th
century, as evidenced by the continuing popularity of its principal proponents Freud and Marx. Freud’s work was
very prominent in the intellectual circles of ﬁn de seicle Vienna, where Wittgenstein grew up, so Wittgenstein was
well aware of it (his sister Margarete was a personal friend of Freud). False consciousness is the supposed solution
to the inconsistency between what we profess to believe is the case, and what we “actually” believe (as based
on, e.g., how we act). For example,. we profess to like so-and-so but we continually mistreat him. Freud would
say that we unconsciously dislike him and that our positive conscious attitude towards him is false. This false
consciousness serves to hide our dislike for him even from ourselves. Wittgenstein, though he did not write about
Freud much, would probably consider the doctrine of false consciousness to be a “disease of thinking.” Where
Freud looked “deeper” in our psyche—the unconscious—for the resolution of inconsistencies in consciousness,
Wittgenstein, on the other hand, would shift his attention outwardly to the context and circumstances where
such inconsistencies really manifest themselves. Wittgenstein would probably say that the only thing that is
important is how we act. The contradictory positive conscious statements do not “hide” anything, they just point

language use is right before our eyes. It is not hidden in some kind of Chomskean “Deep
Structures,” nor does it consist of explanations and deﬁnitions. It consists of, among other
things, the circumstances, context, activities and practices that surround and permeate our
use of language. We have no need to describe these circumstances in any detail because
these descriptions have no real use for us. But how do we teach others about this subtle
embedded knowledge if we cannot describe it? Well, we can still convey the necessary
information by showing the student the proper usage in the relevant circumstances (In
some cases, if the student already has a personal familiarity with the circumstances or
situation in question, I may not have to wait for them to occur, but can merely refer to
them. Here we are teaching a new usage, or a reﬁnement of deﬁnition to someone who is
already familiar with the relevant circumstances, so no detailed description is needed.).
Wittgenstein comments on this problem:
One learns the word “think”, i.e. its use, under certain circumstances, which, how-
ever, one does not learn to describe.
ButIcanteachapersontheuseoftheword!Foradescriptionofthosecircumstances
is not needed for that.
I just teach him the word under particular circumstances.
...
I cannot enumerate the conditions under which the word “to think” is to be used—
but if a circumstance makes the use doubtful, I can say so, and also say how the
situation is deviant from the usual ones. [Z §§114–116, 118]
If our student understands the circumstances or situations relevant to the linguistic usage
that we want to teach, I can merely refer to those situations without describing them in
detail. But if he is not familiar with these relevant circumstances, I must show him the
actual circumstances for that language use. If he has not experienced the situation I refer
to an inconsistency between our actions and our statements. Wittgenstein remained ambivalent about Freud, as
evidenced by a letter he wrote to Norman Malcolm in 1945:
I, too, was greatly impressed when I ﬁrst read Freud. He’s extraordinary.—Of course he is
full of ﬁshy thinking and his charm and the charm of the subject is so great that you may
easily be fooled. . . Unless you think very clearly psycho-analysis is a dangerous and a foul
practice, and it’s done no end of harm and, comparatively, very little good. . . —All this, of
course, doesn’t detract from Freud’s extraordinary scientiﬁc achievement. Only, extraordinary
scientiﬁc achievements have a way these days, of being used for the destruction of human
beings.” [Malcolm. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir, pp. 44–45. Oxford University Press,
London, 1972 (Reprint of 1958 edition).]
Some years earlier (1930) he had made the following comment to Drury:
I was walking about in Cambridge and passed a bookshop, and in the window were portraits of
Russell, Freud and Einstein. A little further on, in a music shop, I saw portraits of Beethoven,
Schubert and Chopin. Comparing these portraits I felt intensely the terrible degeneration that
had come over the human spirit in the course of only a hundred years. [M.O’C. Drury. “Some
notes on conversations with Wittgenstein.” Recollections of Wittgenstein, p. 112. Oxford

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
to, or some similar situation, then the teaching becomes more complex and subject to
misunderstanding. As Wittgenstein summed it up:
One of the most dangerous of ideas for a philosopher is, oddly enough, that we
think with our heads or in our heads.
The idea of thinking as a process in the head, in a completely enclosed space, gives
him something occult. [Z §§605–606]
Since everything we need to perform a complex, intelligent task, such as ﬁnding one’s
way around town, is not in our heads, as Searle insists it is, but is, at least in part, in the
“lived world” of our experience, and since such information is a necessary foundation for
thinking, it is no great intellectual leap to see that our thinking does not always take place
entirely “in the head, in a completely enclosed space” but, at least partially, in our “lived
world.” And this should be no surprise since much of our thinking takes place using tools,
information and knowledge that are outside our heads: most of us cannot perform complex
arithmetic without paper and pencil; we cannot ﬁgure out the strengths and weaknesses
of a country’s economy without the use of almanacs, encyclopedias and newspapers; we
cannot make sound ﬁnancial decisions without reliable stock market information and the
advice of a broker; etc.270
270It is interesting to note that the idea of thinking taking place entirely in one’s head is a view of cognition
that seems to lie at the foundation of Artiﬁcial Intelligence. If, as Searle insists, everything necessary to thought
resides in the “enclosed space” of the brain—the “brain in a vat”—then isn’t a computer rather like a “brain in
a vat?” And if the human brain—the “brain in a vat”—can, according to Searle, have within it all it needs to
represent the world, then it is not surprising that those working in or supporting Artiﬁcial Intelligence would
take as a given that the computer can, at least in theory, have the capacity for holding everything needed “to
represent the world,” that is, everything necessary for intelligent activity. If, on the other hand, Wittgenstein is
right, then much of what is necessary to thought is outside our heads. For Artiﬁcial Intelligence to be successful
in performing intelligent activities, then, computers would need to interact and “live” in our milieu in the same
way that we do. Such a requirement on Artiﬁcial Intelligence might severely limit not only what it might do, but
also what it could possibly do. Research in Artiﬁcial Intelligence could no longer follow the course it has.
One rejoinder Artiﬁcial Intelligence might make to Wittgenstein’s argument is that even though much information
thatweneedmayresideoutsideourheads,thereisnotheoreticalreasontosuspectthatthecompleterepresentation
of the world within the brain and, by analogy, the computer, is not possible. This, of course, would make efforts
to do this on computers a difﬁcult, but not pointless, endeavor. There is no real direct evidence that might refute
this, and the known abilities of individuals with eidetic memories may indicate that we have the potential for the
literal storage of information in our heads at a great capacity [For a compelling description of eidetic memory,
see O. Sack’s “The Landscape of His Dreams” in his An Anthropologist on Mars, Vintage Books, NY, 1995].
This may be true, but the literal memorization of our entire milieu is not likely to be a solution to the problem.
In the ﬁrst place, not all memory is literal representation, so other kinds of prodigious memory capacities—such
as the knowledge of how to do things or the ability to formulate and use abstract concepts and relationships)
are necessary too. We have less evidence for these kinds of remarkable memory than we do for literal or eidetic
memory (e.g., while we know of individuals, like the conductor Toscaninni, who was documented to have recall
of virtually every note of every instrumental part of every major orchestral work he conducted , we have no
evidence that someone could remember how to play every instrument in the orchestra [ G. Marek. “Toscanini’s
Memory,” Memory Observed: Remembering in Natural Contexts. W.H. Freeman, NY, 1982. Edited by U.
Neisser]. Even the musically gifted can master only a small number of instruments at a time, and not because
they do not have the time to learn them, but because we just don’t have the capacity to possess a great number
of abilities like that). (Dreyfus argues persuasively that the knowledge which would provide the foundation for
intelligence is not just a collection of “facts” as early workers in Artiﬁcial Intelligence proposed. He points out

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
205
that intelligent discernment and decision-making require know-how, something that is very difﬁcult to represent
computationally. As Dreyfus put it:
“. . . the research program based on the assumption that human beings produce intelligence
using facts and rules has reached a dead end, and there is no reason to think it could ever
succeed.” [from p. ix of the introduction to What Computers Still Can’t Do: A Critique of
Artiﬁcial Reason, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1992.]
It is also the case that the vast capacity for literal recall of extraordinary amounts of information may, at a certain
point, be disfunctional. Luria’s famous mnemonist, S., remembered practically everything that happened to him
or anything he could memorize by rote [A.R. Luria. The Mind of a Mnemonist. Henry Regnery, Chicago,
1976. Translated from the Russian by L. Solotaroff.]. S. recalled things, at least in part, because he made so
many associations with the items he wanted to remember; numbers weren’t just indications of amount, they also
conjured up images of taste, smell and vision. Such combinations of images employing different senses is termed
“synesthesia.” While synesthesia serves to give memorized items more cues, it also increases the number of
associations to a remembered item and that often complicated S.’s understanding of some text. Luria observed:
Thus, trying to understand a passage, to grasp the information it contains (which other people
accomplish by singling out what is most important), became a tortuous procedure for S., a
struggle against images that kept rising to the surface in his mind. Images, then, proved an
obstacle as well as an aid to learning in that they prevented S. from concentrating on what was
essential. Moreover, since these images tended to jam together, producing still more images,
he was carried so far adrift that he was forced to go back and rethink the entire passage.
Consequently a simple passage—a phrase for that matter—would turn out to be a Sisyphean
task. These vivid, palpable images were not always helpful to S. in understanding a passage;
they could just as easily lead him astray. [Luria, op.cit., p. 113]
Dan Shacter, a specialist in the psychology of memory, comments on Luria’s mnemonist:
. . . [S.] was overwhelmed by detailed but useless recollections of trivial information and
events. He could recount without error long lists of names, numbers, and just about anything
else that Luria presented to him. This served him well in his job as a newspaper reporter,
because he didn’t have to write things down. Yet when he read a story or listened to other
people, he recalled endless details without understanding much of what he read or heard. . . he
had great difﬁculty grasping abstract concepts. [D. Schacter. Searching for Memory: The
Brain, the Mind, and the Past, p. 81. Basic Books, New York, 1996.]
One wonders if the same fate is destined for Doug Lenat’s computer program to internalize commonsense knowl-
edge. Years in the making, the program may eventually store so much information that it becomes impossible
for it to ﬁnd and use the information effectively. This is not a problem of selecting the “best” storage techniques
or access procedures. That is, it is not a problem of searching memory faster. The size of the memory to effect
such a large storage will be so great that faster access methods will only get us faster to the wrong place—and
there are too many wrong places to go to for even extraordinarily fast search techniques to be effective. What
slows such systems down is not the physical speed of searching, it’s the large number of decisions of relevance
or non-relevance that it must make in the course of its searching. As the size of the search space goes up, the
number of decision points goes up rapidly, too (This is the essence of the Information Retrieval problem, an
issue we will deal with in some detail in Part III.). Perhaps not being able to recollect everything that happens is
necessary for adequate mental functioning. Our ability to act intelligently is not so much based on our ability to
understand and memorize by rote, but on our ability to understand, remember the gist of what we know or see,
and forget what we don’t need. People, unlike computers or Luria’s mnemonist, can remember the gist of things,
and forget the “obvious.” Schacter comments:
Forgetting, though often frustrating, is an adaptive feature of our memories. We don’t need to
remembereverythingthathasever happened to us; engrams that we never use are probably best
forgotten. The cognitive psychologist John Anderson has argued convincingly that forgetting

206
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Wittgenstein rejects the dualism of the mind and thebrain believing that those who hold it
to be the case are confusing a grammatical distinction with an empirical one. Talk about
the “mind” and the “brain” involves engaging in two different Language Games which
are embedded in two different sets of activities and practices (“Forms of Life”). He also
rejects the reduction of the mind to the brain. But if we can’t build our epistemological
foundation on minds and brains, or the reduction of minds to brains, what do we build it
on? What lies at the foundation of Wittgenstein’s epistemology is not just physical brain
processes, but human activity and interaction:
Only of a living human being and what resembles (behaves like) a living human
being, can one say: it has sensations; it sees; is blind; hears; is deaf; is conscious
or unconscious.
memories over time is an economical response to the demands placed on memory by the
environment in which we live. We are better off forgetting trivial experiences than clogging
our minds with each and every ongoing event, just in case we might want to remember one of
those incidents someday. But we do need to form an accurate picture of the general features
of our world, and it turns out that we are reasonably adept at doing so. Our recollections of
the general contours of our pasts are often reasonably accurate. Perhaps paradoxically, if we,
like [S.], were constantly overwhelmed by detailed memories of every page from our pasts,
we would be left without a coherent story to tell. [Schacter, ibid.]
But there is a further argument against the practical possibility of being able to internalize all the information
that we require for intelligent activity. Namely, we don’t ever need to do this, neither now nor at any time in our
historical past. Evolutionary development is remarkably efﬁcient. Abilities that a species does not need rarely
get developed, and those that do come up from time to time in the course of random genetic change are not
sustained for long if they are not useful. Memory of the extraordinary capacity needed to represent the world to
the “brain in a vat” is most closely approximated by S.’s ability, yet it is clear that there are major drawbacks to
such a large literal memory. Our present range of mental capacity, then, may represent an “optimum” of sorts—a
useful blending of literal memorization, recognition and reconstruction that allows us to remember the things and
abilities that we need to be functioning social beings, but to forget the welter of non-relevant detail that surrounds
these things. Any greater literal mental capacity would be, like that of Luria’s mnemonist, disfunctional. From
such an evolutionary point of view, the practical possibility of complete internal representation is not convincing
because such a complete internal representation probably could not be the foundation of intelligent activity, and
intelligent activity is a sine qua non for human life as we know it. The existence of nonliteral memory has some
support in neurological research. Neurologist Antonio Damasio comments:
Images are not stored as facsimile pictures of things, or events, or words, or sentences. The
brain does not ﬁle Polaroid pictures of people, objects, landscapes; nor does it store audiotapes
of music and speech; it does not store ﬁlms of scenes in our lives; nor does it hold the type
of cue cards and TelePrompTer transparencies that help politicians earn their daily bread.
In brief, there seem to be no permanently held pictures of anything, even miniaturized, no
microﬁches or microﬁlms, no hard copies. Given the huge amount of knowledge we acquire
in a lifetime, any kind of facsimile storage also poses difﬁcult problems of retrieval efﬁciency.
We all have direct evidence that whenever we recall a given object, or face, or scene, we do
not get an exact reproduction but rather an interpretation, a newly reconstructed version of
the original. In addition, as our age and experience change, versions of the same thing evolve.
None of this is compatible with rigid, facsimile representation, as the British psychologist
Frederic Bartlett noted several decades ago, when he ﬁrst proposed that memory is essentially
reconstructive. [A. Damasio. Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain,
p. 100. Avon Books, NY, 1994. Damasio cites F.C. Bartlett: Remembering: A Study in
Experimental and Social Psychology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1964.]

...
We do indeed say of an inanimate thing that it is in pain: when playing with dolls
for example. But this use of of the concept of pain is a secondary one. Imagine a
case in which people ascribed pain only to inanimate things; pitied only dolls.
...
Only of what behaves like a human being can one say that it has pains.
...
Look at a stone and imagine it having sensations.—One says to oneself: How could
one so much as get the idea of ascribing a sensation to a thing? One might as
well ascribe it to a number!—And now look at a wriggling ﬂy and at once these
difﬁculties vanish and pain seems to get a foothold here, where before everything
was, so to speak, too smooth for it.271 [PI §§281–284]
Or, as Malcolm, discussing Wittgenstein, wrote:
. . . the thing which perceives, thinks, imagines is neither a non-corporeal entity that
“inhabits” the body, nor a brain—but a living human being.272
For Wittgenstein, the foundation of epistemology is not some kind of mind:brain dualism.
Nor is it the reduction of mental processes to neurological events or the reduction of mental
processes to behavior. The foundation of epistemology is, instead, the intensely human
activities—forms of life—of mankind. This helps to explain one of Wittgenstein’s more
curious predilections—his love of mystery stories.
Wittgenstein and Crime: The Breakdown of the Distinction Between
Inner and Outer Processes
Malcolm writes:
. . . in February 1940 I returned to the United States after one and a half years in
Cambridge. Wittgenstein and I kept up a correspondence. I knew that he was fond
of detective magazines. They could not be obtained in England during wartime, and
periodically I sent some to him from America. He had a preference for a magazine
published by Street and Smith, each number of which contained several short
detective stories. Wittgenstein acknowledged the arrival of a package of magazines,
in a letter from Cambridge.
...
In subsequent letters during and after the war Wittgenstein referred to detective magazines
more than once:

most profound insights, largely ignored in present-day philosophy. . . ” Nothing is Hidden: Wittgenstein’s

It’ll be ﬁne to get detective mags from you. There is a terrible scarcity of them now.
My mind feels all underfed.
They are rich in mental vitamins and calories.
The one way in which the ending of Lend-Lease really hits me is by producing a
shortage of detective mags in this country. I can only hope Lord Keynes will make
this quite clear in Washington. For I say: if the USA won’t give us detective mags
we can’t give them philosophy, and so America will be the loser in the end. See?
He compared “Street and Smith mags” with Mind, the prominent international philosophy
journal:
If I read your mags I often wonder how anyone can read Mind with all its impotence
and bankruptcy when they could read Street and Smith mags.
Well, everyone to his taste.
Two and a half years later he repeated the comparison:
Your mags are wonderful. How people can read Mind if they could read Street and
Smith beats me. If philosophy has anything to do with wisdom there’s certainly not
a grain of that in Mind, and quite often a grain in the detective stories.
Once Wittgenstein was so pleased with a detective story that he lent it to both Moore
and Smythies and wished me to try to ﬁnd out what else the author had written:
It may sound crazy, but when I recently re-read the story I liked it again so much
that I thought I’d really like to write to the author and thank him. If this is nuts,
don’t be surprised, for so am I.273
Wittgenstein’s former student Drury recalled the following conversation with him:
Today at lunch the conversation turned to discussing “detective stories.” Wittgen-
stein said how much he enjoyed the stories of Agatha Christie. Not only were the
plots ingenious but the characters were so well drawn that they were real people.
He thought it was a particularly English talent to be able to write books like this.
One of the company advised him to read Chesterton’s “Father Brown” stories. He
made a grimace. “Oh no, I couldn’t stand the idea of a Roman Catholic priest
playing the part of a detective. I don’t want that.”274
273N. Malcolm. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir, pp. 35–36. The detective novel which Wittgenstein liked so
much that he wanted to write to the author was, according to Monk, Norbert Davis’ Rendezvous with Fear [R.
Monk. Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius, p. 528. The Free Press, NY, 1990]. Rendezvous with Fear
was the British title of the novel that was originally published in the US as The Mouse in the Mountain. (While
Rendezvous with Fear has been out of print for some time, The Mouse in the Mountain is still in print, as of
2003).

209
What was it that Wittgenstein liked about detective stories? For most of us, mysteries are
lightdiversionaryreading.IsitpossiblethatWittgensteinturnedtothemasadiversionfrom
the exhausting rigors of philosophical analysis? Not likely. In the ﬁrst place, Wittgenstein
was not given to diversionary activities. His life, thoughts and work were in almost every
way dedicated to serious pursuits. Bertrand Russell related the following incident after
attending a boat race which they watched when Wittgenstein was ﬁrst at Cambridge
University in 1912 (he had gone there on Frege’s recommendation to study with Russell;)
“[After the race, Wittgenstein] suddenly stood still and explained that the way we
had spent the afternoon was so vile that we ought not to live, or at least he ought
not, that nothing is tolerable except producing great works or enjoying those of
others, that he has accomplished nothing and never will, etc.—all this with a force
that nearly knocks one down. He makes me feel like a bleating lambkin.”275
This extreme pessimism was neither temporary, nor a reaction to speciﬁc events. It was
part of his character. Malcolm writes:
It was Wittgenstein’s character to be deeply pessimistic, both about his own
prospects and those of humanity in general. Anyone who was on an intimate footing
with Wittgenstein must have been aware of the feeling in him that our lives are ugly
and our minds in the dark—a feeling that was often close to despair.276
Some of this intense pessimism may have originated in Wittgenstein’s youth, a time when
his sister Hermine reported that he “. . . found it particularly difﬁcult to ﬁt in, for right from
earliest childhood he suffered almost pathological distress in any surroundings which were
uncongenial to him.”277 Whether the source of his distress was to be found in his nature
or his nurturing, there can be no doubt that his family presented a very difﬁcult milieu in
which to grow up—his older brothers Hans and Rudi had already committed suicide by the
time Wittgenstein ﬁrst went to Cambridge, and a third older brother, Kurt, was to commit
suicide soon at the close of World War I.278 Wittgenstein himself was suicidal much of his
youth. Although he managed to make it through life without intentionally harming himself,
there can be no doubt that pessimism and despair dominated his thinking, maintaining his
thoughts at an intense level of seriousness that he was rarely able to rise above.279
275Russell in a letter to Lady O. Morrel, 11 September 1912, quoted on p. 76 in M. Nedo and M. Ranchetti’s
Ludwig Wittgenstein: Sein Leben in Bildern und Texten. Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1983.

Oxford, UK, 1984. Edited by R. Rhees.
278There is some question whether Hans actually committed suicide, though there is no doubt about Rudi or Kurt.
Hans had simply “vanished” from a boat in the Cheasapeake Bay, but the two major biographers of Wittgenstein,
McGuinness and Monk, both agree that the circumstances and Hans’ state of mind were such that suicide was the
most likely explanation of his death. McGuinness comments: “[Hans] vanished from a boat in Cheasapeake Bay
at the age of 26 in circumstances suggesting suicide: as such, certainly, from whatever indications, his death was
always regarded in the family.” [Wittgenstein: A Life. Young Ludwig 1889–1921, p. 26. Brian McGuinness,
The University of California Press, Berkeley, 1988. See also R. Monk’s Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of
Genius. The Free Press, a division of Macmillan, NY, 1990.]
279Wittgenstein’s good friend D. Pinsent wrote in his diary in 1912:

210
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The one exception to this obsession with serious pursuits might have been his attending
the cinema after delivering one of his intense lectures. His favorite ﬁlms were westerns and
musicals, clearly not “serious” ﬁlm genres. If Wittgenstein can be accused of diversionary
activities this, alone, is the best candidate. Wittgenstein said that he attended the movies,
often sitting in the front row, as a way of recovering from the mental intensity that he needed
to conduct his lectures. His students attested to the tortured manner in which he lectured.
One of Wittgenstein’s students, Theodore Redpath gives the following description of his
lecture style:
[During his lectures, Wittgenstein’s] train of thought would frequently come to a
halt. On such occasions he would sometimes sit astride a small upright chair, resting
his arms on the back or holding the tops of the uprights, and curse himself roundly
in such terms as “Damn my bloody soul!” Sometimes, on the other hand, he would
shout out “Help me, someone!”280
He stated that his attendance of ﬁlms after his lectures was like a “shower bath,” washing
away the disgust with which his difﬁcult lectures often left him. In this sense, ﬁlms were
more of a purgative than a diversion.281 But these experiences were very different than
what he got from his detective stories. In the ﬁrst place, he never referred to these ﬁlms
as providing anything intellectually deep at all. Detective stories, on the other hand, were
something that interested Wittgenstein. His statement (supra) that there was more wisdom
in detective stories than in the prominent philosophy journal Mind indicates that these
detective stories were probably of interest to him from an intellectual, if not philosophical,
point of view. This does not mean that he did not enjoy reading them, nor does it mean
that they contributed directly to his philosophy, it merely means that his enjoyment was
coincident with his interest in them. He never mentions that there was any wisdom in the
westerns and musicals he saw.
[Wittgenstein] was very communicative and told me lots about himself: that for nine years,
till last Xmas, he suffered from terriﬁc loneliness (mental—not physical): that he continually
thought of suicide then, and felt ashamed of never daring to kill himself [D. Pinsent. A Portrait
of Wittgenstein As a Young Man, p. 6. Basil Blackwell, Cambridge, MA, 1990. Edited by
G.H. von Wright.]
280T. Redpath. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Student’s Memoir, p. 20. Gerald Duckworth, London. 1990.
281N. Malcolm remarks in his memoir of Wittgenstein:
Wittgenstein was always exhausted by his lectures. He was also revolted by them. He felt
disgusted with what he had said and with himself. Often he would rush off to a cinema
immediately after the class ended. As the members of the class began to move their chairs
out of the room he might look imploringly at a friend and say in a low tone, “Could you go
to a ﬂick?” On the way to the cinema Wittgenstein would buy a bun or cold pork pie and
munch it while he watched the ﬁlm. He insisted on sitting in the very ﬁrst row of seats, so that
the screen would occupy his entire ﬁeld of vision, and his mind would be turned away from
the thoughts of the lecture and his feelings of revulsion. Once he whispered to me “This is
like a shower bath!” [Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir, pp. 27–28. Oxford University Press,
Oxford, 1972.]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
211
Again, we’re brought back to the question of what was the “wisdom” that Wittgenstein
found in detective stories? He only mentions detective stories once in his published writ-
ings, in a section of LWPP I in which he discusses “dissimulation” at length:
But isn’t the concept such that for any behavior, etc., one can imagine (construct) a
larger context in which even this behaviour would be dissimulating behavior? Isn’t
this, for example, the basis for the problem of any detective story? [LWPP I §254]
He doesn’t say speciﬁcally that the constant theme of “dissimulation” is what attracted
him to detective stories, but a consideration of the philosophical issues that occupied him
late in his life does yield a related issue that he returned to repeatedly—the distinction
between “inner and outer processes.” It is in this context that the “wisdom” of the detective
stories can be seen.
Traditionally, there has been a more or less sharp dividing line between what we say or
do—those things that are available for all to see—and what we think or feel—those things
that we consider private. In Wittgenstein’s later writings, especially that included in his
Last Writings on the Philosophy of Psychology, v. II, we see that he does not believe that
there is such a sharp distinction between what we consider public and what we consider
private. Traditionally, our “private” thoughts and feelings are thought to be understandable
to others only if we choose to reveal them. But for Wittgenstein, much of what we consider
private, and revealed to others only through confession, is not hidden at all—even if we
try to keep it private. These private thoughts and feelings are as “open” to others as any
public display can be—they are merely open to us in a “different way”:
My thoughts are not hidden from him, but are just as open to him in a different way
than they are to me. [LWPP II pp. 34–35]
And one cannot answer : “I draw certain conclusions from my knowledge, even if
no one else can”—for conclusions must be valid for all.
...
One could even say: The uncertainty about the inner is an uncertainty about some-
thing outer.282 [LWPP II p. 88]
Wittgenstein is not saying that we are all infallible mind-readers. He is merely saying that
what we think or feel can be surmised sometimes by others even when we don’t speciﬁcally
282Understanding someone’s unstated thoughts was not an unfamiliar event for Wittgenstein. In his memoir of
Wittgenstein, Malcolm writes:
Wittgenstein had an extraordinary gift for divining the thoughts of the person with whom he
was engaged in discussion. While the other struggled to put his thought into words Wittgen-
stein would perceive what it was and state it for him. This power of his, which sometimes
seemed uncanny, was made possible, I am sure, by his own prolonged and continuous re-
searches. He knew what someone else was thinking because he had himself travelled innu-
merable times through those twists and turns of reasoning. He once remarked to me that it
was very unlikely that anyone in his classes should think of something of which he had not
already thought. This was not braggadocio. [N. Malcolm. Ludwig Wittgestein: A Memior,
p. 55. Oxford University Press, London, 1972 (reprint of 1958 edition).]

212
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
admit to what we think or feel. When we say that we are uncertain about what someone
thinks or feels we are really stating an uncertainty about some outer, external event or
process that is open to us all, and the conclusions we draw “must be valid for all” (supra).
We are not expressing an uncertainty about something “inner.” Likewise, if I am certain
about some internal event or process in someone else I am really expressing certainty
about something external—something that can be experienced by all.
Ask not: “What goes on in us when we are certain that. . . ?—but: How is ‘the
certainty that this is the case’ manifested in human action?” [PI p. 225]
The reason why these conclusions must be “valid for all” is that they are based on the
“common behavior of mankind”—the forms of life. These forms of life are the foundation
for language, and, as we have shown, language is the foundation for thought—it is the
“vehicle of thought.” Wittgenstein goes on to make a subtle point:
Here the connection of evidence with what it is evidence for is not ineluctable. And
I don’t mean: “the connection of the outer with the inner.” [LWPP II p. 88]
Wittgenstein makes clear that he is not connecting the inner with the outer. To do so would
make the inner into a “something”—an ontological status he is unwilling to concede.
Since we have no direct access to the inner events or processes of others we cannot
connect anything to them—there is no “them” to connect to. At most, an inner event is
a “something about which nothing could be said.”283 When we make a statement about
what someone thinks or feels we are merely making a statement about what may happen
in a form that is available for us all to see—actions, social events, statements, personal
observations, etc.:
I say “This man is hiding what is in him.” How does one know that he is hiding it?
Thus there are signs for it and signs against it.
There is an unmistakable expression of joy and its opposite.
Under these circumstances one knows that he is in pain, or that he isn’t; under those,
one is uncertain.
But ask yourself: what allows one to recognize a sign for something within as
infallible? All we are left with to measure it against is the outer. Therefore the
constrast between the inner and the outer is not an issue. [LWPP II p. 32]
Traditionally, we have a sense of “outer” phenomena being exposed to view, and “inner”
phenomena being, by deﬁnition, hidden. Wittgenstein continues:
283“But you will surely admit that there is a difference between pain-behaviour accompanied by pain and pain-
behaviour without any pain?”—Admit it? What greater difference could there be?—“And yet you again and
again reach the conclusion that the sensation itself is a nothing.”—Not at all. It is not a something, but not a
nothing either! The conclusion was only that a nothing would serve just as well as a something about which
nothing could be said. We have only rejected the grammar which tries to force itself on us here. [PI §304]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind

It is only in particular cases that the inner is hidden from me, and in those cases it
is not hidden because it is inner. [LWPP II p. 33]
Wittgenstein makes the subtle, but important point that being “hidden” is not an inherent
property of “inner” phenomena. Being hidden is a particular aspect of some of our forms
of life and language games.
. . . what goes on in him is. . . a game, and pretence is not present in him like a
feeling, but like a game.
For also, if he speaks to himself his words only have meaning as elements of a
language-game. [LWPP II pp. 31–32]
If we lie to someone and wish to keep him from the truth, then it is generally not sufﬁcient
for us merely not to tell him the truth. We must also guard ourselves from revealing the truth
through our actions, dealings with others, and the things we say that might imply the truth
without our saying it explicitly. Hiding our thoughts is, in many cases, something attained
through conscious effort; that is, it is something that we add to “inner” phenomena.
Thus, for a phenomenon to be seen as “inner” or “outer” and subsequently as “hidden”
or not, is a function of the language game or form of life it occurs in and not of some
inherent property it possesses independently of its role in these language games or forms
of life. The references to “inner phenomena” are thus not so much references to actual
things as they are simply a way of talking—a Language Game. But is Wittgenstein merely
saying that all we have are “outer” phenomena—that the “inner” phenomena are somehow
irrelevant? If he were, he might justiﬁably be called a behaviorist. But Wittgenstein does
believe in both the existence and importance of “inner” phenomena, even those that are
never revealed—voluntarily or not (this will be discussed in more detail in the section
“Wittgenstein and Behaviorism” (infra)). Such “inner phenomena” are legitimized by
their existence in accepted language games and forms of life.
It is also not the case that the discovery of “inner phenomena” is contingent solely on the
consequences that may follow them. Certainly the consequences of “inner phenomena”
help us to learn how to detect something that is hidden, but they are not decisive. For
example, we believe what someone tells us but later ﬁnd out that he was lying. If we
experience this enough times we may be able to tell when that person lies in the future.
But, although consequences are often important in the learning process, we can often
attain a certainty about whether someone is lying that exists independently of the possible
consequences. For example, someone we trust tells us that we should never believe Frank’s
ﬁshing stories because he always “lies about what he caught”—we never see any of the
ﬁsh, we just, “on good authority,” don’t believe him. Wittgenstein comments:
It could be that someone uttered signs of gladness and then behaved in a completely
unexpected way, and that we still could not say that the ﬁrst expression was not
genuine. [LWPP II p. 90]
Certainty or genuineness, then, is a function of a particular language game orform of
life, and is not necessarily determined empirically. Even though our justiﬁcations for our

214
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
beliefs must be valid for all, there may be circumstances when, for example, we can tell
when someone is lying, but we cannot describe or give precise criteria about how we do
it—that is, we are convinced we are right, but can give no criteria to support our assertion:
But does there have to be a reason? Couldn’t I simply know whether he is pretending
without knowing how I know it?
I simply would have “an eye” for it. [LWPP II p. 31]
What Wittgenstein is saying is that just because one’s “conclusions must be valid for all”
(supra) does not mean that we can always articulate the criteria that convinced us we were
correct. Two people can agree that a third person is lying or “hiding something” without
being able to articulate the reasons for such a conclusion—this is like the detective’s
“hunch.”
It is also important to note that our assessment of some inner phenomenon—that so-and-so
is lying—does not necessarily express a probability of our being correct:
I do not say that the evidence makes the inner merely probable. [LWPP II p. 40]
There are cases where we can say we are certain. Does this mean that we are implicitly
asserting a probability that we are correct? Not necessarily. What is the difference between
certainty and a probability of being correct? Well, things look different in the two cases:
if we are certain that someone is thinking such-and-such, we may act differently, we may
take different things as criteria, or there may be different consequences than if we take it to
be only probable that the person is thinking such-and-such. Believing something is certain
rather than just probable, may just “feel” different. Being certain does not mean you are
correct, though. It just commits you to a particular attitude or point of view. Probability is
part of somelanguage games, but not all. Some decision theorists would like to substitute
assessments of subjective probability for all our assertions, but this is a Procrustean bed
and not all assertions will “ﬁt” it.284 Even a confession, which purports to link the inner
with the outer, is a very complex process.
Let us assume that there was a man who always guessed right what I was saying
to myself in my thoughts (It does not matter how he manages it.). But what is the
criterion for his guessing right? Well, I am a truthful person and I confess that he
has guessed right.—But might I not be mistaken, can my memory not deceive me?
And might it not always do so when—without lying—I express what I have thought
within myself?—But now it does appear that “what went on within me” is not the
point at all (Here I am drawing a construction-line).
284A good example of giving a probability, or probability-like assessment, for assertions that are not initially
quantitative such as linguistic “hedges” (like “very,” “almost,” “somewhat,” etc.) occurs in Fuzzy Sets Theory
(the originator of Fuzzy Sets theory was LotﬁZadeh, who is the author of many works on the subject). Here,
if we assert that John—who stands at 6 feet 5 inches—is “very tall” we are, in terms of fuzzy-sets, saying that
John’s probable membership in the group of “very tall people” is 90% , or so. While such a quantitative rendering
of uncertainty is useful in computer modeling, for which it was originally intended, it does not capture the subtle
differences between quantitative and nonquantitative assessments in our day-to-day discourse. That is, when we
say “John is very tall” we are not, even unconsciously, assigning a probability to his being very tall—we simply
see him as being “very tall.”

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
215
The criteria for the truth of the confession that I thought such-and-such are not the
criteria for a true description of a process. And the importance of the true confession
does not reside in its being a correct and certain report of a process. It resides rather
in the special consequences which can be drawn from a confession whose truth is
guaranteed by the special criteria of truthfulness. [PI p. 222]
We might distinguish between two kinds of “private” entities: feelings and thoughts. It is
relatively easy to see how our personal feelings may be discernable by others:
If I see someone writhing in pain, with evident cause I do not think: all the same,
his feelings are hidden from me. [PI p. 223]
Correctly discerning what someone is thinking is somewhat more complex, but also
accessible:
There is a game of “guessing thoughts.” A variant of it would be this: I tell A
something in a language that B does not understand. B is supposed to guess the
meaning of what I say.—Another variant: I write down a sentence which the other
person cannot see. He has to guess the words or their sense.—Yet another: I am
putting a jig-saw puzzle together; the other person cannot see me but from time to
time guesses my thoughts and utters them. He says, for instance, “Now where is
this bit?”—“Now I know how it ﬁts!” —“I have no idea what goes in here,”—“The
sky is always the hardest part” and so on—but I need not be talking to myself either
out loud or silently at the time.
All this would be guessing at thoughts; and the fact that it does not actually happen
does not make thought any more hidden than the unperceived physical proceedings.
“What is internal is hidden from us.”—The future is hidden from us. But does the
astronomer think like this when he calculates an eclipse of the sun? [PI p. 223]
Language use comprises a set of activities, and like other common activities—or forms
of life—they usually follow more or less predictable patterns. It is like, in Wittgenstein’s
example, the assembling of a jigsaw puzzle: there are things that you generally do ﬁrst—
like putting together all the pieces with a straight side to form the outer border of the puzzle,
then building the puzzle in from there, or concentrating on assembling those pieces with a
distinct color or design and leaving other parts until the end (“the sky is always the hardest
part”(supra)). In another example, if I see a friend coming towards me ﬁrst thing in the
morning, I am sure he will greet me and ask how I’m doing. If he knows that my son has
been ill he will likely ask after his health. If I answer his greeting saying I feel especially
good this morning, he will likely ask what the reason is for my unusually good mood, etc.,
etc. We often make such assumptions and draw such inferences about others so readily that
we aren’t even aware of how much we anticipate in our normal dealings with others.285
285There was a television commercial for Excedrin, a headache tablet, in which a wife offers her husband
some Excedrin. Since he had not complained, he wonders how she knew he had a headache. She says that his
headache is so bad “it shows.” This leads into the product endorsement: “For a headache so bad that it shows,
take Excedrin.” (quotation is approximate).

216
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
But we don’t make inferences about everything that happens around us. In fact, we often
don’t make inferences at all—we act as if routine events and things will remain the same:
I act as if the people who were my friends yesterday will be my friends today; I act as if
people who know me will recognize me, and people whom I have not seen before will not;
I act as if shopkeepers will be friendly and acquiesce to my requests for service; I act as if
family members will still share personal family knowledge with me; I act as if the streets
and buildings in my town will remain in their places; etc.:
But I did not get my picture of the world by satisfying myself of its correctness;
nor do I have it because I am satisﬁed of its correctness. No; it is the inherited
background against which I distinguish between true and false.
The propositions describing this world-picture might be part of a kind of mythology.
And their role is like that of rules of a game; and the game can be learned purely
practically, without learning any explicit rules.
It might be imagined that some propositions, of the form of empirical proposi-
tions, were hardened and functioned as channels for such empirical propositions
as were not hardened by ﬂuid; and that this relation altered with time, in that ﬂuid
propositions hardened, and hard ones became ﬂuid. [OC §§94–96]
There is much that we do not question in our day-to-day activities. Some of this is assumed
merely by our being ordinary, social people: for example, we assume that everyone we
know has biological parents. Some things, on the other hand, are contingent on certain
circumstances: for example, we might fear for our personal safety if we walk in certain
parts of some major cities late at night, but would not have the same fears walking in a
crowded shopping mall at any time; and some of what we assume is dependent on our
personal experience: for example, that my good friend Milt will be sure to pay back any
small loan I make to him, because he has always done so in the past. So some of the things
we assume are things that we do not, and in some cases, cannot test for ourselves, such as
the one about biological parents, above, and some things may not come from our personal
experience, but from the experience of others, such as the assumption about our personal
safety. The third assumption is one that is based on our own experience, but even that
experience is only assumed to hold in “normal circumstances.” Wittgenstein brings out
this inherited background in his apt example:
Does my telephone call to New York strengthen my conviction that the earth exists?
Much seems to be ﬁxed, and it is removed from the trafﬁc. It is so to speak shunted
onto an unused siding.
Now it gives our way of looking at things, and our researches, their form.
Perhaps it was once disputed. But perhaps for unthinkable ages, it has be-
longed to the scaffolding of our thoughts. (Every human being has parents.)
[OC §§210–211]
As Malcolm comments:

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
217
Absence of doubt manifests itself throughout the normal life of a human being.286
But, given the inherited background of our world, what allows us to anticipate what others
are thinking or feeling? What enables us to do this is our understanding of how we deal
with the routine activities which every normal person engages in: asking questions, joking,
complaining, arguing, censuring, praising, restraining, lying, speaking sarcastically, mis-
leading, etc. It means that if we see a particular person in certain speciﬁc circumstances,
engaged in a familiar activity, we can often surmise what he is thinking or feeling. As a
character in David Mamet’s ﬁlm “House of Games” says:
The things we think, the things we want—we can do them or not do them, but we
can’t hide them.287
Returning to Wittgenstein’s “detective mags” we can see how they frequently turn on the
clever detection of something that appears “hidden”—some knowledge that one or more
of the protagonists is keeping secret. It is this, I think, that Wittgenstein found fascinating
about detective stories, for it showed that the traditional distinction between what is public
and what is private, while held to be largely unbreachable, except by reliable confession,
by some philosophers and psychologists, is certainly not the case in everyday life. We
not only can often ﬁgure out what people are thinking or feeling without their telling us,
but, if we are clever, we can ﬁnd out about the thoughts and feelings of others who go to
elaborate lengths to keep those thoughts and feelings secret. The clever detective not only
ﬁnds out these secrets but he does it himself by piecing together a varying collection of
circumstances, evidence and statements by the suspect and/or others that lead to informal
inferences about what the suspect really thinks or feels.288 What detective stories do is to
describe attractively a kind of folk wisdom that has been available to us for some time, at
least in this form.
Perhaps the ﬁrst modern detective stories were written over 100 years ago by Edgar Allan
Poe. Consider the passage from his “Murders in the Rue Morgue”:
We were strolling one night down the long dirty street, in the vicinity of the Palais
Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a
syllable for ﬁfteen minutes at least. All at once Dupin [the detective] broke forth
with these words:
“He is a very little fellow, that’s true, and would do better for the Th´eˆatre des
Vari´et´es.”
286Malcolm. Wittgensteinean Themes: Essays 1978–1989, p. 79.
287The statement is made by a swindler/conﬁdence man to a psychiatrist who has been drawn into the demi-
monde of cons and scams where such criminals exist. Both the psychiatrist and the conman earn their living by
anticipating what others think, even when others are trying to keep those thoughts secret. The movie offers an
interesting contrast between the human understanding of the psychiatrist and the conman: the psychiatrist who
asks her patients what they think and infers what may be hidden, and the conman who must know what people
think without asking, and can even manipulate what they think to his own ends.
288Since the time of Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories these inferences unfortunately have often been called
“deductive.” It is clear that they are usually not this rigorous, but involve more informal kinds of inference. One
book which tries to systematize some detective story logic is W. Neblett’s Sherlock’s Logic. [Dorset Press, NY,
1985]

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
“There can be no doubt of that,” I replied, unwittingly, and not at ﬁrst observing
(so much had I been absorbed in reﬂection) the extraordinary manner in which the
speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected
myself, and my astonishment was profound.
“Dupin,” said I, gravely, “this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say
that I am amazed, and can scarely credit my senses. How was it possible you should
know I was thinking of —-?” Here I paused to ascertain beyond a doubt whether
he really knew of whom I thought.
“—of Chantilly,” said he, “why do you pause? You were remarking to yourself that
his diminutive ﬁgure unﬁtted him for tragedy.”
This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reﬂections. Chantilly was a
quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the
rˆole of Xerxes, in Cr´ebillon’s tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded
for his pains.
“Tell me, for Heaven’s sake,” I exclaimed, “the method—if method there is—by
which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.” In fact, I was even
more startled than I would have been willing to express.
“It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who brought you to the conclusion that
the mender of soles was not of sufﬁcient height for Xerxes et id genus omne.”
“The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no fruiterer whomsoever.”
“The man who ran up against you as we entered the street—it may have been ﬁfteen
minutes ago.”
I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket
of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the Rue
C— into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what this had to do with Chantilly
I could not possibly understand.
There was not a particle of charlat˚anerie about Dupin. “I will explain,” he said,
“and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will ﬁrst retrace the course of your
meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the recontre
with the fruiterer in question. The larger links of the chain run thus—Chantilly,
Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.”
There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives amused themselves
in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been
attained. The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the ﬁrst
time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between
the starting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement, when
I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help
acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:
“We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue
C—.” This was the last subject we discussed. As we crossed into this street, a

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
219
fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you
upon a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing
repair. You stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your
ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile,
and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but
observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity.
“You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing, with a petulant expression, at
the holes and ruts in the pavement (so that I saw you were still thinking of the
stones), until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by
way of experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance
brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured
the word ‘stereotomy,’ a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement. I
knew that you could not say to yourself ‘stereotomy’ without being brought to think
of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since when singularly, yet with
how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with conﬁrmation
in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes
upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so.
You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps.
But in the bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday’s ‘Mus´ee,’ the
satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler’s change of name upon
assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed. I
mean the line
Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum.
I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from
certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was aware that you could not
have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two
ideas of Orion and Chantilly. That you did combine them I saw by the character of
the smile which passed over your lips. You thought of the poor cobbler’s immolation.
So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up
to your full height. I was then sure that you reﬂected upon the diminutive ﬁgure
of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that as, in fact,
he was a very little fellow—that Chantilly—he would be better at the Th´eˆatre des
Vari´et´es.”289
Such inferences may seem a bit strained to the modern reader, but they may not have been
so for the 19th century reader. There is nothing deductive about inferences such as these,
289E.A. Poe. “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” The Complete Poems and Tales of Edgar Allan Poe. While
Poe is usually considered the originator of the modern detective story, the ﬁrst detective novel written in English
was probably W. Collins’ The Moonstone (1868) which T.S. Eliot called “. . . the ﬁrst, the longest, and the best
of modern English detective novels” [J.I.M. Stewart’s introduction to The Moonstone, Penguin Books, London,
1996]. Detective ﬁction in China predates English works by centuries: “Short stories about mysterious crimes
and their solution have existed in China for over a thousand years, and master-detectives have been celebrated in
the tales of the public story teller and in theatrical plays for many centuries. The longer Chinese detective novel
started later, about 1600, and reached its greatest development in the 18th and 19th centuries” [Celebrated Cases
of Judge Dee (Dee Goong An). Translated by Robert van Gulik, Dover Publications, New York, p. 1.]. We can
see from these examples that the detection and revelation of what has been hidden is a subject of longstanding
interest that cuts across cultural boundaries.

220
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
they could be right or wrong, though for the purposes of ﬁction it is better that they be right.
They would certainly be hard to prove in any rigorous sense and are certainly defeasible—
they can be overturned by further information or inferences. The series of inferences that
Dupin makes are also based on different kinds of observations and knowledge: that the
subject might be “vexed” when the fruiterer runs into him; that the subject would know
about the attempt to replace paving stones with the better stereotomy method of paving, and
approve of it; that he, Dupin, could read the subject’s lips when he mumbled “stereotomy”
to himself; that the subject would know of the philosophy of Epicurus and make the
phonetic connection between “stereotomy” and “atomies;” that the subject’s glance up
to the stars “could only mean” that he was connecting Epicurus to the Orion Nebula—
a connection that seems reasonable to Dupin because “. . . we disussed this subject not
very long ago”; that the subject would have been familiar with the recent bad reviews the
actor had gotten, and that one prominent reviewer drew a veiled analogy to Orion; that
a change in the subject’s gait—“I saw you draw yourself up to your full height”—might
indicate something about what he was thinking; and that people often follow just such
trains of thought where external stimuli, personal knowledge and associations combine to
link one thought to another, in a very informal way. But in spite of the tenuous nature of
the inferences, there is no doubt that Poe was one of the ﬁrst authors to explicitly describe
a kind of phenomenon that does have a realistic basis. We can, and do, surmise a lot about
what others think by observing what they do. Taking Wittgenstein’s lead to give examples
rather than explanations to demonstrate a point, we might consider some more recent
examples of the detective genre—examples that would probably appear more plausible
to the modern reader. First, take an example from a mystery writer who wrote during
Wittgenstein’s time and whom he liked, Agatha Christie (see quotation at footnote [274]).
One of her detectives, Hercule Poirot, demonstrates his understanding of the subtleties of
human behavior in the following passage:
[Poirot] “I was attracted to [your case]. . . by its striking unimportance.”
“Importance?” said Sir Joseph.
“Unimportance was what I said. I have been called in for varying causes—to
investigate murders, unexplained deaths, robberies, thefts of jewelry. This is the
ﬁrst time that I have been asked to turn my talents to elucidate the kidnapping of a
Pekinese dog.”
Sir Joseph grunted. He said: “You surprise me! I should have said you’d have had
no end of women pestering you about their pet dogs.”
“That, certainly. But it is the ﬁrst time that I am summoned by the husband in the
case.”
Sir Joseph’s little eyes narrowed appreciatively. He said: “I begin to see why they
recommended you to me. You’re a shrewd fellow, M. Poirot.”290
290A. Christie. “The Nemean Lion,” The Labors of Hercules, pp. 12–13. G.P. Putnam and Sons, NY, 1993.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
221
In this quotation we can see two major characteristics of this kind of inference. In the
ﬁrst place it begins with a general feeling of uneasiness, a feeling that something is
amiss, or inconsistent with one’s expectations (Poirot is wondering why the husband of
the woman with the lost dog has called him rather than the woman herself). Nothing need
be known about what exactly is wrong, only the general feeling of unease is noted. Many
detective stories begin this way. Often the detective is the only one who has these feelings,
a “hunch,” so to speak; this, of course, is due to his/her superior insight and experience (the
story wouldn’t be as interesting if it were composed entirely of observations or inferences
that anyone could make). The search for the reason for the detective’s uneasiness often
occupies the major part of the story. But while the uneasiness may occur in almost any
form, the eventual explanation for the uneasiness must be plausible both to those in the
story as well as the readers. The author of the detective story must thereby walk a ﬁne
line between plausibility and implausibility. That is, the source of the uneasiness must be
hidden enough that the reader cannot ﬁgure it out when it’s presented. But it must also
be the case that the eventual explanation of why the situation made the detective or other
protagonists uneasy must be plausible. The balancing of hiddenness and revelation is the
touchstone of good detective ﬁction. Sometimes the uneasy feelings come not from what
someone says, but from their behavior. Consider Raymond Chandler’s detective Phillip
Marlowe:
[Marlowe] “How well did Miss Fromsett know Lavery? Out of ofﬁce hours?”
His face tightened up like a charleyhorse. His ﬁsts went into hard lumps on his
thighs. He said nothing.
“She looked kind of queer when I asked her for his address yesterday morning,”
I said.
He let a breath out slowly.
“Like a bad taste in the mouth,” I said. “Like a romance that fouled out. Am I too
blunt?”
His nostrills quivered a little and his breath made noise in them for a moment. Then
he relaxed and said quietly:
“She—she knew him rather well—at one time. She’s a girl who would do about
what she pleased in that way. Lavery was, I guess, a fascinating bird—to women.”
“I’ll have to talk to her,” I said.
“Why?” He asked shortly. Red patches showed in this cheeks.
“Never mind why. It’s my business to ask all sorts of questions of all sorts of people.”
“Talk to her then,” he said tightly. “As a matter of fact she knew the Almores. She
knew Almore’s wife, the one who killed herself. Laverly knew her too. Could that
have any possible connection with this business?”

222
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
“I don’t know. You’re in love with her, aren’t you?”
“I’d marry her tomorrow, if I could,” he said stifﬂy.291
The reader can see that Chandler is trying to convey how upsetting Marlowe’s questions
are, not by explicitly saying they are upsetting, but by describing the physical appearance
of the man he is questioning. A person who is not emotionally involved in the matter would
doubtless answer the questions matter-of-factly. Since he does not answer matter-of-factly
it indicates that he ﬁnds the subject of the questions disturbing. What is interesting in
this passage is that this emotional reaction can be conveyed by the simple description
of the individual’s appearance while he answers the questions. No explanation is given
of what the individual actually is thinking or feeling during the questioning. Instead, the
appearance of the man being questioned is simply given, but for most intelligent readers
this is all that is necessary to get the author’s point. In fact, Marlowe not only sees that
the fellow he is questioning is upset, he understands why he is upset—he is in love with
Miss Fromsett and is understandably upset talking about a former affair of hers. If he
were not in love with Miss Fromsett, his being upset would not “ﬁt” the situation. For
Wittgenstein such descriptions convey what they intend because they are part of a general
system of understanding and belief that most intelligent adults know and accept (a kind
of “inherited background” that forms the basis for what we take as true). It is also an
example of “showing” rather than “telling,” of “description” rather than “explanation.”
Wittgenstein comments:
At some point one has to pass from explanation to mere description.292 [OC §189]
291R. Chandler. The Lady in the Lake, p. 73. This passage is obviously overdone, from a literary point of view,
but it still serves as an example of how a writer can convey, even in popular ﬁction, the emotions that underly
what is actually said in the dialogue, without explicitly stating what those emotions are. More subtle examples
of such techniques, of course, are used extensively in ﬁner ﬁction: consider James Joyce’s short story “The Two
Gallants” from his Dubliners [The Portable James Joyce, The Viking Press, NY, 1966 (revised edition)]. The
story concerns two young men, one of whom is on his way to see an attractive young woman. The second young
man waits to see his friend after his friend’s evening with the young woman. Afterwards, the second young man
is anxious to hear how his friend’s time with the young woman went. The story ends as follows:
“Can’t you tell us?” he said. “Did you try her?”
Corley halted at the ﬁrst lamp and stared grimly before him. Then with a grave gesture he
extended a hand towards the light and, smiling, opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple.
A small gold coin shone in the palm. [op.cit. p. 71]
This ending is understated enough for its meaning to escape the casual reader, yet it shocked Joyce’s original
printer enough for him to refuse to publish it. [R. Ellmann. James Joyce, p. 228. Oxford University Press, NY,
1959.]
292Wittgenstein comments on the dangers of explanation:
The expression “that is all that happens” sets limits to what we call “happening.”
Here the temptation is overwhelming to say something further, when everything has already
been described.—Whence this pressure? What analogy, what wrong interpretation produces
it?
Here we come up against a remarkable and characteristic phenomenon in philosophical in-

223
Sometimes the detective’s reasoning approaches more formal logical deductions:
Degarmo said gratingly: “Who told you she tried to get money from Almore?”
“Nobody. I had to think of something to ﬁt what happened. If Lavery or Mrs.
Kingsley had known who Murial Chess had been, and had tipped it off, [then] you
would have known where to ﬁnd her and what name she was using. You didn’t
know those things. Therefore the lead had to come from the only person up there
who knew who she was, and that was herself. So I assume she wrote to Almore.”293
This reasoning follows the valid logical form known as “modus tollens”:
If A then B.
Not B
Therefore: Not A.
The above passage does not explicitly deny the antecedent, A—“Lavery or Mrs. Kingsley
had known who Murial Chess had been.” It denies A implicitly. The conclusion that
“[Murial Chess] wrote to Almore” cannot be deduced from the statements above unless
there is also the premiss that only Lavery or Mrs. Kingsley knew who Murial Chess was
(of course, Murial Chess knew who Murial Chess was). This premiss is implicit in the
earlier part of the story. Nevertheless, the inference does conform to propositional logic.
Sometimes the detective’s observation depends on expected regularities that may differ
from culture to culture. Consider the following passage from a Japanese detective novel
translated into English:
As Sekigawa drank his highball, the waiter brought over an appetizer. It was a plate
of smoked salmon. Emiko stared at it.
Noticing her gaze, Sekigawa offered the dish to her. “Eat some if you like.”
“Thank you. I’ll just take this.” Emiko pierced the slice of lemon on the plate with
a toothpick. Putting it into her mouth, she ate it as if it were delicious.
“Does such a sour thing taste good to you?” Sekigawa asked, watching her.
vestigation: the difﬁculty—I might say—is not that of ﬁnding the solution but rather that of
recognizing as the solution something that looks as if it were only a preliminary to it. “We have
already said everything.—Not anything that follows from this, no, this itself is the solution!”
This is connected, I believe, with our wrongly expecting an explanation, whereas the solution
of the difﬁculty is a description, if we give it the right place in our considerations. If we dwell
upon it, and do not try to get beyond it.
The difﬁculty here is to stop.
“Why do you demand explanations? If they are given you, you will once more be facing a
terminus. They cannot get you any further than you are at present.” [Z §§312–315]

At this moment, Sekigawa’s expression changed. He had realized something. He
glared at Emiko. Suddenly shifting his chair around, he moved close to sit next to
her.
“You,” he said softly in her ear, “can’t possibly be. . . ”
Emiko turned bright red. Her hand stopped moving. She sat perfectly still.
“So that’s it.” Sekigawa was still looking at her intently.
Without uttering a word, Emiko nodded.294
Such an inference based on the stated interactions between the characters may be too
tenuous for the average Western reader to pick up immediately. Presumably, the Japanese
reader would make the desired inference—that Emiko is pregnant—given the circum-
stances described by the author.
Often the understanding of what is “hidden” in a detective story dawns with the gradual
accumulation of evidence—frequently unpredictable—and the stringing together of infer-
ences based on that evidence. This process is brought out nicely by Colin Dexter in his
more recent detective novel The Wench is Dead.295 It will be instructive to look at this
sequence of inferences in some detail. In the story, Dexter’s sleuth, Inspector Morse, is
recovering from a painful ulcer in a hospital. He must remain there several days and, being
a man of action, he is bored. A friend gives him a book detailing an account of a murder
trial that occurred over a century before in which a young woman, Joanna Franks, had
booked passage on a canal boat to Oxford, but was murdered by the four boatmen. Two
of the boatmen were convicted and hung. But reading this account Morse begins to grow
uneasy:
After reading [the ﬁrst] few pages, Morse found himself making some mental
queries about a few minor items, and harbouring some vague unease about one or
two major ones:
Far quicker for [Joanna] by rail, of course! And the fare she’d paid, 16s
11d, seemed on the face of it somewhat on the steep side for a trip as a
passenger on a working boat. In 1859? Surely so! What would the rail-fare
have been then? Morse had no idea. But there were ways of ﬁnding out;
Why on earth [did the boatmen all have] “aliases?” Were the crewmen counted a
load of crooks before they ever came to court? Did every one on the Canal have two
names—a “bye name”, as it were, as well as one written in the christening-book?
Surely any jury was bound to feel a fraction of prejudice against such [men].296
Morse does not know what these sources of his unease mean, he is just aware that the facts
of the case don’t seem to ﬁt together as well as they should. The price of the passage on

the boat is signiﬁcant because Joanna and her husband were both very poor, so poor in
fact that they could not live together. In such a case it would be normal to expect a traveler
to seek the cheapest means of transportation. If the traveler does not, one might conclude
that there must have been some ulterior motive for purchasing a more expensive ticket.
Morse does not know what that motive might be, he has just noticed a seeming deviation
from normal expectations. Of course, if it turns out that the boat passage was the cheapest
transportation available then the purchase of boat passage would ﬁt with the poverty of
Joanna.
The “aliases” of the boatmen might prejudice the jury against them, if such aliases were
uncommon. Again, it is not entirely clear how this might have been signiﬁcant in the trial,
it is just something that runs counter to what Morse expects. If the boatmen truly were a
bad lot and the evidence against them in the trial was overwhelming, then such a prejudice
would have little effect on the outcome other than, perhaps, increasing the severity of
the punishment. But if the evidence against the boatmen was weak—as it turned out to
be—then it might force a conviction where the evidence really didn’t justify it. But, if
boatmen were commonly held to be a “load of crooks” why would a woman traveling by
herself choose to spend several days alone with them? In noting these possibly signiﬁcant
facts, and the questions they raise, Morse has begun a process of detecting and revealing
something that might have been hidden in the evidence of the case—something that was
kept out of the evidence, willfully. This process is much like Peirce’s idea of “abduction”:
The ﬁrst starting of a hypothesis and the entertaining of it, whether as a simple
interrogation or with any degree of conﬁdence, is an inferential step which I pro-
pose to call abduction (or retroduction). This will include a preference for any
one hypothesis over others which would equally explain the facts, so long as this
preference is not based upon any previous knowledge bearing upon the truth of the
hypotheses, nor on any testing of any of the hypotheses, after having admitted them
on probation. I call all such inference by the peculiar name, abduction, because its
legitimacy depends upon altogether different principles from those of other kinds
of inference [induction and deduction]. . . The form of the inference, therefore, is
this:
The susprising fact, C, is observed;
But if A were true, C would be a matter of course;
Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.297
297C.S. Peirce. Philosophical Writings of Peirce, p. 151. Dover Publications, NY, 1955. Selected and edited by
J. Buchler. W.B. Gallie distinguishes between induction and abduction in the following way:
. . . in the former [induction] we conclude that facts, similar to observed facts, are true in
cases not examined, whereas in the latter [abduction] we conclude the existence of a fact
quite different from anything observed; the former classiﬁes, and the latter explains. . . the
conclusion [of an abductive inference] is altogether tentative in character: all that is argued
or defended is that a certain suggestion as conjecture is worth considering. [Peirce and
Pragmatism, p. 98. Pelican Books, Edinburgh, 1952.]
The tentative character of abduction is what logicians term “defeasible” reasoning—conclusions whose validity
can be “defeated” by further information or inferences.

226
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The uneasiness that Morse feels when he reads the account of the trial stems from ex-
pectations he has about how the trial should go. These expectations are based on his
familiarity with purposeful activities that normal individuals participate in. Some of these
expectations—that an impoverished traveler will try to ﬁnd the cheapest mode of travel
available—come from a general knowledge of how people conduct their affairs. Other
expectations—such as the understanding that a jury might be prejudiced if the defen-
dant has engaged in previous criminal activity—come from Morse’ experience as a police
ofﬁcer. The uneasiness that Morse has prompts him to resolve it in some way, either by dis-
pelling it or by ﬁnding a way to accommodate it within the framework of his expectations
(e.g., if Morse were able to ﬁgure out what the ulterior motive might be for Joanna to select
a more expensive mode of transportation and willingly travel with “a load of crooks,” then
his expectations could be altered to accommodate that seeming inconsistency).
As Morse continues reading his uneasiness grows:
As with Part One, Morse found himself making a few notes (mentally, this time) as
he read through the unhappy narrative. For some reason he felt vaguely dissatisﬁed
with himself. Something was nagging at his brain about Part One; but for the present
he was unable to put a ﬁnger on it. . . could anyone, anyone, read this story and not
ﬁnd himself questioning one or two of the points so conﬁdently reported? Or two
or three of them? Or three or four?298
Although Morse hasn’t put his ﬁnger on the source of his uneasiness, he begins to look
towards what his experience tells him might be the most fruitful area of inquiry—the
activities and routines of the boatmen:
What was the normal pattern of entertainment for canal boatmen, like Oldﬁeld,
on those “protracted stops” of theirs? Changing horses was obviously one of the
key activities on such occasions, but one scarcely calculated to gladden every soul.
Dropping in at the local knocking-shop, then? A likely port-of-call for a few of
the more strongly sexed among them, most surely. And drink? Did they drink their
wages away, these boatmen, in the low-beamed bars that were built along their way?
How not? Why not? What else was there to do?
. . . So many questions.299
But the questions keep coming up for Morse:
Boots. . . shoes. . .
What was all that about [Joanna’s] shoes? Why were they ﬁguring so repeatedly in
the story?300

Forbidding to Joanna as the tall lock-house must have appeared that midnight,
standing sentinel-like above the black waters, it presented her with her one last
chance of life—had she sought asylum within its walls.
But she made no such request.301
And those last complex, confusing paragraphs! [Joanna] had been desperately anx-
ious to get off the boat and away from her tipsy persecutors—so much seemed
beyond any reasonable doubt. But, if so, why, according to the self-same evidence,
had she always been so anxious to get back on again?302
But it’s the actions of the boatcrew after Joanna’s death, and before her body was found,
that puzzle Morse the most:
How had it come about—whatever the fortuitous, involuntary, or deliberate cir-
cumstances in which Joanna had met her death—that the crew of the Barbara Bray
had insisted time and time again that the wretched woman had been nothing but
one long, sorry trial to them all ever since she’d ﬁrst jumped on board at Preston
Brook? How was it that they were still damning and blasting the poor woman’s soul
to eternity way, way after they had pushed her into the Canal and, for all Morse
or anyone else knew, held her head under the black waters until she writhed in
agony against their murderous hands no longer? Had a satisfactory explanation
been forthcoming for such event?. . . the answer was “no.”303
Did (Morse asked himself) wicked men tend to get more drunk—or more sober—
after committing such callous crimes? Interesting thought . . . 304
It was not unknown, admittedly, for the odd psychopath to act in a totally irrational
and irresponsible manner. But these were not a quartet of psychopaths. And, about
all, it seemed quite extraordinary to Morse that, even after (as was claimed) the
crew had somehow and for some reason managed to murder Joanna Franks, they
were—some twenty-four, thirty-six hours later—still knocking back the booze,
still damning and blasting the woman’s soul to eternity. Morse had known many
murderers, but never one who had subsequently acted in such a fashion—let alone
four. No! It just didn’t add up; didn’t add up at all. . . One might expect some measure
of shame, remorse, fear—yes!—even, in a few cases, triumph and jubilation in the
actual performance of the deed. But not—no!—not the ﬁerce anger and loathing
perpetrated by the boatmen through the hours and the days after Joanna had met
her death.305
Morse has drawn on his unusual knowledge of murderers’ personalities and habits, a set
of forms of life he is familiar with, to see that these boatmen do not act like murderers.
After all these questions, Morse begins to see what the source of his discomfort is:

305Op.cit., pp. 110–111 and 125–126.

228
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Morse felt he could put his ﬁnger on the major cause of his unease. It was all
those conversations, heard and duly reported, between the principal characters in
the story: conversations between the crew and Joanna; between the crew and other
boatmen; between the crew and lock-keepers, wharﬁngers, and constables—all of
it was wrong somehow. Wrong, if they were guilty. It was as if some inexperienced
playwright had been given a murder-plot, and had then proceeded to write page
after page of inappropriate, misleading, and occasionally contradictory dialogue.
For there were moments when it looked as if it were Joanna Franks who was the
avenging Fury, with the crewmen merely the victims of her fatal power.306
What is interesting is that when Morse sees what is bothering him—what doesn’t “ﬁt” in
the narrative of the trial—he sees not one or two things, but a whole system of facts or
propositions. Again, this parallels Wittgenstein’s notion of factual understanding:
When we ﬁrst begin to believe anything, what we believe is not a single proposition,
it is a whole system of propositions. (Light dawns gradually over the whole.)
It is not single axioms that strike me as obvious, it is a system in which consequences
and premises give one another mutual support. [OC §§141–142]
Again, Morse’ narrative follows the general framework of many detective stories. First, the
detective or some central character becomes uneasy about the events or circumstances that
occur. He often doesn’t know why he feels uneasy, but the uneasiness persists in spite of
his continuing thoughts about the case. The method for resolving this uneasiness is to ﬁnd
an explanation for the events or circumstances in question that somehow shows why these
events or circumstances played out in the unexpected way that they did. This (abductive)
explanation usually comes after the detective obtains more information about the people,
things, motivations or circumstances in the case. The clever thing for the detective is to
see that some of these events or circumstances are related in a way that others, including
the reader, had not seen. Generally, the detective tries to ﬁnd more about the speciﬁc
case with which he is concerned (In our example, Morse supplements the narrative of the
murder case with trips to the library to ﬁnd the actual transcript of the trial along with old
newspaper accounts of it.). This additional information can be about a number of things:
it could be something previously unknown about the central characters that might give
them a motive for committing the crime, or some special skill that gave them a means of
carrying out the crime, or some special circumstances that preﬁgure the crime itself. When
it comes down to it, the detective, more often than not, relies on his or her understanding
of human nature—both criminal and normal. It is mostly his/her understanding of what
Wittgenstein might call the “natural history of mankind” that enables him to ﬁnd out things
that others may willfully try to hide.307
306Op.cit., p. 110.
307Out of deference to C. Dexter, the author of The Wench is Dead, I have not revealed the conclusion of the
story. But I can say that Inspector Morse was correct, there was something “ﬁshy” about the story of Johanna.
And when he ﬁnds out exactly what it is, all the inconsistencies that bothered him before now “ﬁt,” bringing
the reported actions of the protagonists back into the “inherited” framework of, in Wittgenstein’s words, the
“common behavior of mankind.” [PI §206]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind

Wittgenstein and Drama: A Dramatic Theory of Meaning
Morse’ sudden revelation that the recorded testimony of the case reads like a bad play,
resonates with Wittgenstein:
The best example of an expression with a very speciﬁc meaning is a passage in a
play. [LWPP I §424]
The contexts of a sentence are best portrayed in a play. Therefore, the best example
for a sentence with a particular meaning is a quotation from a play. And whoever
asks a person in a play what he’s experiencing when he’s speaking? [LWPP I §38]
For Wittgenstein, if we want to demonstrate the meaning of a particular word or phrase we
can best do this by describing how those words might be used in a play. So the meaning
of the word or phrase is not a dictionary deﬁnition, nor is it a description of what we are
thinking, but a description of the context and circumstances (and perhaps the background
of the characters) that would provide the “stage setting” and motivation for its use in a
play; for Morse, a good way to see what the clues or evidence mean is to imagine them
within the context of a play. Wittgenstein also uses the related metaphor of “stage setting”
in the everyday use of language:
But what does it mean to say that he has “named his pain?”. . . When one says “He
gave a name to his sensation” one forgets that a great deal of stagesetting in the
language is presupposed if the mere act on naming is to make sense. And when
we speak of someone’s having given a name to pain, what is presupposed is the
existence of the grammar of the word “pain”; it shews [sic] the post where the new
word is stationed. [PI §257]
By saying that meaning in language is best portrayed as its use in a play, Wittgenstein once
again moves us away from the narrow context-free mentalistic semantics of language that
he felt did not capture the richness and complexity of language in use. One might make
the further inference that the best description of a language game is a description of that
particular language usage in a play. Recall Wittgenstein’s description of a language game:
I shall call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven,
the “language game.” [PI §7]
Our observation that the criteria on which the detective may base his inferences or hunches
may vary between different cultures is also supported by Wittgenstein’s “dramatic notion
of meaning”:
A play, for example, shows what instances of dissimulation look like.
Of course, one could imagine variations of the typical manifestations of dissimu-
lation.
The plays of people who differ from us in this way would then take a different
course from ours, and we wouldn’t understand them at all.
What would be completely unmotivated to us would seem natural to them.

230
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
(For example, the way Orestes identiﬁes himself to the king, by pointing to his
sword, etc., might seem utterly absurd to some people.)
A play by these people would be incomprehensible to us. (Indeed, is Greek tragedy
comprehensible to us?)308 [LWPP I §§263–266]
Wittgenstein’s “dramatic theory of meaning” has given us a way to establish what particular
context and circumstances are necessary for the conveying of a speciﬁc linguistic meaning
(though the context and circumstances used in the play must be familiar to the audience).
The use of drama to portray meaning is also an instance of how effective demonstrating,
or showing, what a word or phrase means is, as opposed to explaining or deﬁning it.
Wittgenstein continually insists in his later philosophy that demonstration and description
are far better ways of conveying linguistic meaning than explanations and deﬁnitions
are.309
One of the major criticisms of ordinary language philosophy is that when we extend the
criteria of meaning in language from a syntactic or semantic foundation to a pragmatic
one, we make so much relevant to meaning that it would be impossible to describe in any
kind of complete way. As Benson Mates wrote in his criticism of this aspect of “ordinary
language philosophy”:
We have all heard the wearying platitude that “you can’t separate” the meaning of
a word from the entire context in which it occurs, including not only the actual
linguistic context but also the aims, feeling, beliefs, and hopes of the speaker, the
same for the listener and any bystanders, the social situation, the physical surround-
ings, the historical background, the rules of the game, and so on ad inﬁnitum. There
is no doubt some truth in this, but I fail to see how it helps one get started in an
empirical investigation of language. At the very least, provisional divisions of the
subject have to be made somewhere.310
For Mates, by including all this pragmatic information as essential to linguistic meaning,
we have no boundaries to limit what we look at. With no boundaries for what is relevant,
then any description or investigation of meaning based on it would be endless and, thus, im-
possible to complete. But Wittgenstein is not so open-ended in his analysis. His “dramatic
theory of meaning” (q.v.) puts clear boundaries on what is necessary to convey linguistic
meaning. Pragmatic meaning does not include, as Mates implies, everything, for, surely,
if the dramatist can create the context and circumstances that can convey, faithfully, the
308If the culture we grow up in inﬂuences not only what we think, but also how we think, as Donald claims
(“Culture can literally reconﬁgure the use patterns of the brain” (see footnote [240]), it is not unreasonable to
infer that if two individuals came from sufﬁciently different cultures they may not be able to understand each
other in fundamental ways. And the plays of a culture that no longer exists, like Greece Before the Common
Era, may be, as Wittgenstein supposes, “. . . incomprehensible to us” in signiﬁcant ways.
309Wittgenstein’s concern with language and meaning was not just philosophical. By living his entire adult life
in a culture that did not speak his native language, German, he was constantly confronted with having to ﬁnd or
conﬁrm the meanings of everyday language (English), and, no doubt, was poignantly aware of the differences in
meaning that different cultures could impose on language. This gave a constant personal imperative to his work
on language.

meaning of ordinary—or even very creative—language use in a play, then a fortiori, the
description of the context and circumstances necessary to convey linguistic meaning are
not endless and impossible to describe completely. The dramatist can do it, so why not the
philosopher?311
The Inner and the Outer
The endless fascination of these people for me lies in what I call their inward power.
It is part of the elusive secret that hides in everyone, and it has been my life’s work to
try to capture it on ﬁlm. The mask we present to others and, too often, to ourselves,
may lift for only a second—to reveal that power in an unconscious gesture, a raised
brow, a surprised response, a moment of repose. This is the moment to record.312
—Yousuf Karsh (portrait photographer)
This discussion of the “hiddenness” and “openness” of our thoughts and feelings brings
us to a more general conception of the issue which Wittgenstein termed the “inner” and
the “outer,” and which occupied much of his thought during the last few years of his
life.313 But the distinction between the inner and the outer is a variation on a much more
fundamentalsetofdistinctions,ordualisms,thathasoccupiedphilosophersforcenturies—
the distinction between the physical and the mental, between phenomena of the physical
world and the processes or states of the human mind. From a subjective point of view,
there is unquestionably a relationship between the inner and the outer: things we observe
become subjects of our most private thoughts, and ideas that we have sometimes seem to be
the instigation for our actions in the physical world. But what is this relationship between
the inner and outer processes? And, just how “private” are our thoughts and feelings? The
311S. Cavell, who is largely sympathetic with Wittgenstein’s view of language, takes issue with this statement
by Mates:
. . . I should perhaps justify my very heavy reliance on the idea of context, because on Mates’
description of what a statement of context involves, it should be impossible ever to make
one [Cavell quotes Mates’ statement above]. Isn’t this another of those apostrophes to the
inﬁnite which prevents philosophers from getting down to cases? Of course if I have to go on
about the context. . . ad inﬁnitum, I would not get very far with it. But I would claim to have
characterized the context sufﬁciently (for the purpose at hand) by the statement that something
is, or is supposed to be, ﬁshy about the action. Giving directions for using a word is no more
prodigious and unending a task than giving directions for anything else. The context in which
I make a martini with vodka is no less complex than the context in which I make a statement
with [the word] “voluntary.” Say, if you like, that these actions take place in inﬁnitely complex
contexts; but then remember that you can be given directions for doing either. . .
In recommending that we ignore context in order to make “provisional divisions” of a subject and get an
investigation started, Mates is recommending the wrong thing for the right reason. It is true that we cannot say
everything at once and that for some problems some distinction of the sort Mates has in mind may be of service.
My discontent with it is that it has come to deﬂect investigation—I mean from questions on which Oxford
[Ordinary Language] philosophy trains itself.[From “Must We Mean What We Say?,” Ordinary Language:

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
centrality of the contrast between the inner and the outer to mainstream philosophical
thought is emphasized by Glock in his comments on Wittgenstein:
The inner/outer picture informs not just Cartesian dualism, but the mainstream
of modern philosophy, including rationalism, empiricism and Kantianism. Even
Frege, who insisted that what we think—“thoughts”—are abstract entities in a
“third realm,” accepted the traditional contrast between the “second realm” of
material objects and the ﬁrst realm of “ideas” which are the private properties
of individuals. . . Idealism and phenomenalism dispense with the physical world,
but cleave to the image of the mind as a private immaterial theatre to which we
have immediate access. Behaviorism, by contrast, reduces the mental to human
behavior, which it describes in purely physical terms. Finally, materialism rejects
the Cartesian conception of the mind as an immaterial substance, but concludes that
it must be a material substance, thereby replacing the mind/body dualism with a
brain/body dualism, in which the brain takes on the role of the inner. These positions
question one half of the dichotomy, but not the contrast itself. They ignore that we
describe human behavior not as mere bodily movement, but ab initio in terms of
our mental vocabulary, for example as jumping for joy, chuckling with glee. The
mental is neither a ﬁction, nor hidden behind the outer. It infuses our behavior and
is expressed in it.314
Wittgenstein insists that our private feelings and thoughts—the “inner”—are really not
intrinsically hidden. They are open to others in a “different way” than our more public
statements and actions—the “outer”—are. The way that they are open to others is similar to
the way that hidden motivations and thoughts are open to the detective. The initial “hunch”
that begins the detective’s quest for knowledge is like our own feeling that something is,
or is not, the case, even though we do not have clear evidence for it. Wittgenstein remarks:
I go for a walk in the environs of a city with a friend. As we talk it comes out that
I am imagining the city to lie on our right. Not only have I no conscious reason
for this assumption, but some quite simple consideration was enough to make me
realize that the city lay rather to the left ahead of us. I can at ﬁrst give no answer
to the question why I imagine the city in this direction. I have no reason to think
it. But though I see no reason still I seem to see certain psychological causes for
it. In particular, certain associations and memories. For example, we walked along
a canal, and once before in similar circumstances I had followed a canal and that
time the city lay on our right.—I might try as it were psychoanalytically to disover
the causes of my unfounded conviction.
“But what is this queer experience?”—Of course it is not queerer than any other;
it simply differs in kind from those experiences which we regard as the most
fundamental ones, our sense impressions for instance.
“I feel as if I knew the city lay over there.”—“I feel as if the name ’Schubert’ ﬁtted
Schubert’s works and Schubert’s face.” [PI p. 215]

Of course, such “hunches” can be wrong, but just as surely, and perhaps more strikingly,
they can be right. The basis for these feelings may be ineffable. Even on reﬂection, one
might not be able to justify them at all, or only partially. Sometimes, they come from a
sense of “symmetry”:
. . . one is sometimes convinced of the correctness of a view by its simplicity or
symmetry, i.e., these are what induce one to go over to this point of view. One then
simply says something like: “That’s how it must be.” [OC §92]
The detective’s hunches often come when something doesn’t “ﬁt” with everything else. In
Morse’ case, the description of the boatmen’s activities after the crime does not ﬁt with
their being guilty—they did not act like men who had just committed a murder. The notion
that events, circumstances and statements must somehow “ﬁt” together, is what makes it
so difﬁcult for us to hide our thoughts and feelings, that is, to lie. As Sir Walter Scott wrote:
Oh what a tangled web we weave
When ﬁrst we practice to deceive!315
Solving a mystery is somewhat like learning a new language, and Wittgenstein makes
it very clear that such education is strongly based on our understanding of the common
practices and activities—the life forms—of mankind:
Suppose you came as an explorer into an unknown country with a language quite
strange to you. In what circumstances would you say that the people there gave
orders, understood them, obeyed them, rebelled against them, and so on?
The common behavior of mankind is the system of reference by means of which
we interpret an unknown language. [PI §206]
Inspector Morse is trying to understand what the boatmen meant by their statements
damning the murdered woman. The 19th century boatmen are residents in the “unknown
country” whose language Morse is trying to understand. Morse does not need to ﬁgure
out the literal meaning of what the boatmen said—any one who speaks English can
understand that. What he needs to ﬁgure out is how this literal meaning ﬁts the presumed
circumstances—the guilt of the boatmen. And this understanding, like all meaning in
language, is grounded in forms of life—here, the forms of life of the boatmen and Joanna
in particular, and the forms of life of average working Englishmen of the 19th century,
in general (“[Morse] What was the normal pattern of entertainment for canal boatmen,
like Oldﬁeld, on those ’protracted stops’ of theirs?”). If the detective is to interpret the
meaning, connotations and implications of a suspect’s language correctly—especially if
he is to tell whether the suspect is lying or not—he or she must understand the forms of
life of both ordinary people and criminals.
Much of what the detective infers is based on what Wittgenstein called “imponderable
evidence” or “ﬁne shades of behavior”—those things that by themselves do not amount
315Sir W. Scott. “L’envoy,” (Verse xvii).

234
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
to much but in the right context or circumstances, or with the right assumptions turn out
to be key revelations. Inspector Morse comments:
From the newspaper records, it was soon clear that the [author of the narrative] had
omitted no details of any obvious importance. Yet, as in most criminal cases, it was
the apparently innocuous, incidental, almost irrelevant, details that could change,
in a ﬂash, the interpretation of accepted facts. And there were quite a few details
here (to Morse, hitherto unknown) which caused him more than a millimetric rise
of the eyebrows.316
In a remarkably similar statement, Wittgenstein comments on the importance of the “sim-
ple” and “familiar” when doing philosophical analysis:
The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because of their
simplicity and familiarity (One is unable to notice something—because it is always
before one’s eyes.). The real foundations of his enquiry do not strike a man at all.
Unless that fact has at some time struck him.—And this means: we fail to be struck
by what, once seen, is most striking and most powerful. [PI §129]
Being a detective and doing analytic philosophy are remarkably similar activities, and
philosophy, to Wittgenstein, is an activity, not a doctrine:
Philosophy aims at the logical clariﬁcation of thoughts.
Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity.
A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations.
Philosophy does not result in “philosophical propositions,” but rather in the clari-
ﬁcation of propositions.
Without philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task is to
make them clear and to give them sharp boundaries.317 [TLP §4.112]
316Dexter, op.cit., p. 123.
317The mathematician Ramsey, who was a friend of Wittgenstein, remarked on this in this review of the Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus:
The conclusion of the greatest modern philosopher, is that there is no such subject as philos-
ophy; that it is an activity, not a doctrine; and that, instead of answering questions, it aims
merely at curing headaches. [F.P. Ramsey.The Foundations of Mathematics and Other
Logical Essays, p. 288. London, 1931. Edited by R. Brathwaite.]
While Wittgenstein rejected or modiﬁed many of his views in TLP, he maintained this view of philosophy
throughout his life, as Baker and Hacker observe:
. . . philosophy is extraordinary in that it adjudicates the bounds of sense. It clariﬁes which
questions are intelligible and which investigations are in principle relevant or irrelevant for
answering them. This view Wittgenstein held and argued for throughout his career. It is the
sense that he thought of philosophy as the activity of clarifying thoughts. [G.P. Baker and
P.M.S. Hacker. Wittgenstein: Meaning and Understanding. Essays on the Philosophical
Investigations, vol. 1, p. 259. University of Chicago Press, 1985.]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
235
This series of statements about philosophy could be a good description of what the detec-
tive’s “method” aims at too. Like the philosopher, the detective aims at ﬁnding the “simple”
and “familiar” things that elucidate his problems (Morse ponders, “Boots. . . shoes. . . What
was all that about [Joanna’s] shoes? Why were they ﬁguring so repeatedly in the story?”);
like the philosopher, the detective must ﬁnd out what the right questions are he should be
asking (“Did (Morse asked himself) wicked men tend to get more drunk—or more sober—
after committing such callous crimes? Interesting thought. . . ”); like the philosopher, the
detective must be wary of how the forms of language and the regularities of our activities
compel us to make improper assumptions or draw misleading conclusions (on reading the
case of Joanna’s murder, one is naturally drawn to believe that Joanna is the victim and
the coarse boatmen her tormentors, as the jury did. But, Morse observes, “. . . there were
moments when it looked as if it were Joanna Franks who was the avenging Fury, with the
crewmen merely the victims of her fatal power.” ); and like the philosopher, the detective
is often confronted with resolving paradoxes (“And those last complex, confusing para-
graphs! [Joanna] had been desperately anxious to get off the boat and away from her tipsy
persecutors—so much seemed beyond any reasonable doubt. But, if so, why, according to
the self-same evidence, had she always been so anxious to get back on again?”).
Imponderable Evidence (Unw¨agbare Evidenz)
Wittgenstein talks about the subtleties of evidence that we might gather to support an
inference or opinion. Some of this is what he calls “imponderable evidence”:
It is certainly possible to be convinced by evidence that someone is in such-and-
such a state of mind, that, for instance, he is not pretending. But “evidence” here
includes “imponderable” evidence.
The question is: what does imponderable evidence accomplish?
Suppose there were imponderable evidence for the chemical (internal) structure of a
substance, still it would have to prove itself to be evidence by certain consequences
which can be weighed.
(Imponderable evidence might convince someone that a picture was a gen-
uine. . . But it is possible for this to be proved right by documentary evidence as
well.)
Imponderable evidence includes subtleties of glance, of gesture, of tone.
I may recognize a genuine loving look, distinguish it from a pretended one (and here
there can, of course, be a “ponderable” conﬁrmation of my judgement). But I may
be quite incapable of describing the difference. And this not because the languages
I know have no words for it. For why not introduce new words?—If I were a very
talented painter I might conceivably represent the genuine and the simulated glance
in pictures.318 [PI p. 228]
318Wittgenstein had a slightly different version of the last two paragraphs of this in LWPP I:

236
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
What does “imponderable evidence” mean? (Let’s be honest!)
I tell someone that I have reasons for this claim or proofs for it, but that they are
“imponderable.”
Well, for instance, I have seen the look which one person has given another. I say
“If you had seen it you would have said the same thing.” [But there is still some
unclarity.] Some other time perhaps, I might get him to see this look, and then he
will be convinced. That would be one possibility.
To some extent I do predict behavior (“They’ll get married, she’ll see to that”), and
to some extent I don’t. [LWPP I §§922–923]
“Imponderable evidence” is often the grounds for both the detective’s “hunch” as well
as the expert’s “judgment.”319 Such evidence cannot be marshaled for or against a given
hypothesis as “documentary evidence” can, it can only be the unstated basis for one hunch
or judgment over another. But such a hunch must lead to certain consequences that are
not imponderable—“it would have to prove itself” as Wittgenstein states. (One imagines
the classic denouement of many British mysteries where the detective gathers all the
suspects together in the library of a country estate and begins to recount his discoveries
and inferences. Gradually, as one suspect after the other is eliminated from suspicion the
tension grows until the guilty one often makes a run for it, thereby conﬁrming his guilt and
turning the detective’s hunch into the ponderable evidence of a ﬂight, capture and possibly
a confession.)
To conﬁrm their “hunches” the detective and the philosopher must turn imponderable
evidence into “ponderable” evidence. But there are experts who may never get to the
point where they can convincingly justify their judgments to nonexperts. Consider the
connoisseur. Wittgenstein observes:
“Imponderable evidence” includes subtleties of tone, of glance, of gesture.
Isn’t it really as if here one were looking at the workings of the nervous system? For I would
very much like my feigned gesture to be exactly like the real one, but in spite of everything it
is not the same.
I can recognize a genuine loving look, distinguish it from a pretended one. And yet there is
no way in which I can describe it to someone else. If we had a great painter here, he might
conceivably represent a genuine and simulated look in pictures, or this kind of a representation
could be imagined in a ﬁlm, and perhaps a verbal description based on it.
Ask yourself: How does a man learn to get a ’nose’ for something? And how can this nose
be used? [LWPP I §§936–938]
319Note how, in common parlance, that a detective has a “hunch” while an expert has an “opinion” or “judgment.”
An expert in art would not normally be said to have a “hunch,” while the detective would not be said to have
an “opinion” or a “judgment.” Following Wittgenstein’s deep grammatical analysis, we must conclude that
“hunches,” “opinions” and “judgments” refer to a family of similar, but subtley different cognitive abilities.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
237
A connoisseur couldn’t make himself understood to a jury, for instance. That is,
they would understand his statement, but not his reasons. He can give intimations
to another connoisseur, and the latter will understand them. [LWPP I §927]
It may even be the case that there are no reasons at all for some of our judgments:
But does there have to be a reason? Couldn’t I simply know whether he is pretending
without knowing how I know it?
I simply have “an eye” for it. [LWPP II p. 31]
But how does the expert acquire such subtle abilities? Wittgenstein comments:
Is there such a thing as “expert judgment” about the genuineness of expressions of
feeling?—Even here, there are those whose judgment is “better” and those whose
judgment is “worse.”
Correcter [sic] prognoses will generally issue from the judgments of those with
better knowledge of mankind.
Can one learn this knowledge? Yes; some can. Not, however, by taking a course
in it, but through “experience.”—Can someone else be a man’s teacher in this?
Certainly. From time to time he gives him the right tip.—This is what “learning”
and “teaching” are like here.—What one acquires here is not a technique; one learns
correct judgments. There are also rules, but they do not form a system, and only
experienced people can apply them right. Unlike calculation rules.
What is most difﬁcult here is to put this indeﬁniteness, correctly and unfalsiﬁed,
into words.320 [PI p. 227]
What is important here is that learning how to make this kind of expert judgment does
not involve following explicit rules or “taking a course in it.” It involves having as many
relevant experiences as possible in the company of an expert who coaches the novice.
Experts who can make these judgments well may not be able to describe how they make
them in any kind of detail. They can demonstrate how these judgments are made in actual
cases, but they may not be able to describe any context-free rules that would allow someone
without the expertise to systematically make such judgments. Context-free rules are like
320Compare to a similar statement in LWPP I §§925– 926:
An important fact here is that we learn certain things only through long experience and not from a course in
school. How, for instance, does one develop the eye of a connoisseur? Someone says, for example: “This picture
was not painted by such-and-such a master”—the statement he makes is thus not an aesthetic judgment, but one
that can be proved by documentation. He may not be able to give good reasons for his verdict.—How did he
learn it? Could someone have taught him? Quite.—Not in the same way as one learns to calculate. A great deal
of experience was necessary. That is, the learner probably had to look at and compare a large number of pictures
by various masters again and again. In doing this he could have been given hints. Well, that was the process of
learning. But then he looked at a picture and made a judgment about it. In most cases he was able to list reasons
for his judgment, but generally it wasn’t they that were convincing.
Look at learning—and the result of learning.

238
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
calculation rules, which can be applied by nonexperts, or even computers. But these aren’t
like the rules that Wittgenstein refers to. The expert’s rules are more like heuristics, and
presuppose a minimal level of expertise before they can be applied. Perhaps an example
will help. Many of us have used repair manuals to ﬁx our cars, appliances, etc. rather than
paying to have an experienced repairman ﬁx them. While these manuals are frequently
advertised as enabling complete novices to make complex repairs, they often implicitly
presuppose a minimal level of expertise to apply the steps in a repair. For example, in
trouble-shooting a car that won’t start, one of the steps tells the reader to check to see that
all the spark plugs are generating a “good spark.” What it doesn’t tell you is what a “good
spark” looks like. You need some experience to know what a “good spark” really looks
like. The ability to blend expertise and rules is what Wittgenstein means when he writes:
There are also rules, but they do not form a system, and only experienced people
can apply them right. [supra]
The successful exercise of expert judgments not only doesn’t follow the kind of analysis
we see in mathematical calculations, the attempt to make expert judgments by analysis
can actually prove an impediment to gaining expertise. Consider the following description
of learning to play chess at an expert level:
I was always good at mathematics and took up chess as an outlet for that analytic
talent. At college, where I captained the chess team, my players were mostly math-
ematicians and mostly, like me, at the competent level. At this point, a few of my
teammates who were not mathematicians began to play fast chess at the rate of
ﬁve or ten minutes a game, and also eagerly to play over the great games of the
grandmasters. I resisted. Fast chess was no fun for me, because it didn’t give me
time to ﬁgure out what to do. I found grandmaster games inscrutable, and since the
record of the game seldom if ever gave rules and principles explaining the moves,
I felt there was nothing I could learn from the games. Some of my teammates who
through fast chess and game studying acquired a great deal of concrete experience
have gone on to become masters.
As I look around at my mathematical academic colleagues, most of whom play
chess and none of whom have gotten beyond my own competent level, I see how
our view of chess as a strictly analytic game has cut us off from absorbing concrete
chess experience. While students of mathematics and related topics predominate
in the population of young people enthusiastic about chess, you are as likely to ﬁnd
a truck driver as a mathematician among the world’s best players. You are more
likely to ﬁnd an amateur psychologist or a journalist. In a way I am glad that my
analytic approach to chess stymied my progress, because this helped me to see that
there is more to skill than reasoning.321
Taking another example, how do we teach someone the difference between Impressionism
and Neo-impressionism in French painting? Deﬁnitions and explanations alone would
likely fail to make the distinctions and similarities that are important. We need to see
examples of each of these schools of painting and our expertise will grow as we see more
321H. Dreyfus and S. Dreyfus. Mind Over Machine: The Power of Human Intuition and Expertise in the
Era of the Computer, p. 25. Free Press, NY, 1986.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
239
and more examples. The best way to demonstrate these artistic categories is for an expert
to take the novice to an art gallery in which both styles of painting are present and point
them out to him: “This painting by Cezanne is a good example of Impressionism, while
this painting by Seurat is a good example of Neo-impressionism. Both Impressionism
and Neo-impressionism reduce the sharp picture of reality that we see to an image that
is softer and less sharp, but they do it in different ways—in Neo-impressionism see how
the painter constructed the painting with discrete dots of paint; now compare that with the
Impressionist who used fuller strokes of the brush,” etc. This type of teaching involves the
grouping of examples into similar categories, but it also may be accompanied by examples
that can be used to distinguish these examples from those outside the categories in question.
For example, we might point out Lichtenstein’s Pop Art to give an example of an artistic
style that uses dots of color to make up larger images but is not an example of Neo-
Impressionism; or, we might contrast Impressionism with other painting styles such as
Fauvism and Expressionism that create their works with impressionist-like images, but are
not considered examples of Impressionism. The simultaneous importance of distinction
and similarity in assessing class membership is considered a fundamentally important
aspect of how language works.
The Objective Correlative
The use of literary techniques to reveal the feelings or thoughts of characters without
actually stating them is not limited to detective stories, but runs through much established
English literature. The poet and dramatist T.S. Eliot discusses this process in his 1919 essay
“Hamlet and His Problems.” He called this literary device an “objective correlative”:
The only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by ﬁnding an “objective
correlative”; in other words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall
be the formula of that particular emotion; such that when the external facts, which
mustterminateinsensoryexperience,aregiven,theemotionisimmediatelyevoked.
If you examine any of Shakespeare’s more successful tragedies, you will ﬁnd this
exact equivalence; you will ﬁnd that the state of mind of Lady Macbeth walking
in her sleep has been communicated to you by a skillful accumulation of imagined
sensory impressions; the words of Macbeth on hearing of his wife’s death strike us
as if, given the sequence of events, these words were automatically released by the
last event in the series. The artistic “inevitability” lies in this complete adequacy
of the external to the emotion . . . 322
We can see the subtleties of such inferences in the commentary which Ezra Pound added
to his translation of a Chinese poem by Rihaku:
“The Jewel Stairs’ Grievance”
The jewelled steps are already quite white with dew,
It is so late that the dew soaks my gauze stockings,
322T.S. Eliot. “Hamlet and His Problems,” Selected Essays. Harcourt, Brace and World, NY, 1932. Quotation is
from pp. 124–125.

240
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
And I let down the crystal curtain
And watch the moon through the clear autumn.
[Pound’s comments] Note: Jewel stairs, therefore a palace. Grievance, therefore
there is something to complain of. Gauze stockings, therefore a court lady, not a
servant who complains. Clear autumn, therefore [s]he has no excuse on account of
weather. Also she has come early, for the dew has not merely whitened the stairs,
but has soaked her stockings. The poem is especially prized because she utters no
direct reproach.323
Pound was a poet and Eliot was a poet as well as a dramatist, but such literary devices
are common to prose, too. James Joyce formulated a similar technique which he called an
“epiphany.” His brother, Stanislaus, discusses this:
Another experimental form which [Joyce’s] literary urge took. . . consisted in the
noting of what he called “epiphanies”—manifestations or revelations. Jim always
had a contempt for secrecy, and these notes were in the beginning ironical obser-
vations of slips, and little errors and gestures—mere straws in the wind—by which
people betrayed the very things they were most careful to conceal.324
This digression into literary devices is not meant to show that Wittgenstein is unoriginal in
his claim that our thoughts and feelings are “open” to others in various ways. It is merely
to show that his claim has support in other areas of language use, especially in those areas

324S. Joyce. My Brother’s Keeper, p. 124. Viking Press, NY, 1969. The relation between the “clue” in a mystery
story and an epiphany has been drawn by Hugh Kenner:
The clue is a bogus epiphany. In itself it has no ontological signiﬁcance. It doesn’t open
to contemplative penetration the intelligible depths of some object; rather it suggests to the
quick deductive wit discursive attention to the superﬁcies of a dozen other objects. The clue
and the chain of reasoning function, like a jigsaw puzzle, in two dimensions. The sleuth’s
reconstruction of a crime works at the level of efﬁcient causes only; the epiphany implies an
intuitive grasp of material, formal, and ﬁnal causes as well. Though it resembles “Araby” or
“The Dead” in that the signiﬁcance of the whole becomes clear on the last page, the detective
story remains a two-dimensional parody of the Joycean short story, as Holmes is a parody of
Stephen, as Stephen is a parody of Joyce, and as discursive analysis, once it deserts its job of
arranging data in the line of efﬁcient causality, becomes a parody of metaphysical intuition,
or of allied aesthetic modes of knowledge. The “meaning” of “The Dead” cannot be reasoned
out, as a whole generation of commentators has had opportunity to discover. [Dublin’s Joyce,
pp. 176–177. Beacon Press, Boston, 1962.]
Kenner’s criticism of clues as being a lower form of epiphany is, in my opinion, too severe. If Joyce’s epiphanies
are of a higher order of insight and revelation than clues in mystery stories are then this is not because detective
stories are “two-dimensional parod[ies] of the Joycean short story,” but because Joyce is simply a greater writer
than even the best mystery story writer. Had Joyce turned his hand to writing mystery stories his “clues” would,
no doubt, have reached the depth and insight of the epiphanies in his stories. But even apart from the greatness of
a writer like Joyce, the clues of a mystery story have a kind of deceptive obviousness about them that encourages
us to think of their revelations as clever rather than profound. If we are not familiar with the activities and forms
of life of the characters—for example, we come from a different culture—the revelations of the clues may not
be so obvious.

where language use has reached a high level of execution, such as poetry and literature.
Wittgenstein has merely drawn a reference to a kind of human ability that has existed for
a long time, but had not been considered signiﬁcant by most philosophers.
Imponderable Evidence and Real Life
So far, we have drawn supporting evidence for Wittgenstein’s claim to the “openness” of
inner/mental phenomena from the world of ﬁction. While such references are intriguing,
it is important to look for similar evidence in the details of actual events. Since we initially
drew the parallel between Wittgenstein’s work on the openness of inner phenomena and
detective ﬁction, it may be instructive to examine whether actual detectives follow their
“hunches” as ﬁctional ones do. Although Michael Kurland, author of How to Solve a
Murder: The Forensic Handbook325 is initially critical of the accuracy of ﬁction detec-
tives (and, apparently unaware of mystery writers like Agatha Christie’s and P.D. James’
use of working police and detectives as advisors), some of his examples of how detective
work proceeds are remarkably similar to the progression of unease, hunches, investigation
and resolution that we described with Detective Morse. As Kurland described it:
Many homicide detectives develop a “sixth sense” in recognizing a purposeful
murder in what seems on the surface to be a random act of violence, an accidental
death, or a suicide. If you ask a detective how he or she knew that a given case was
not what it seemed, the response is often, “It just didn’t feel right.” When, early
in the afternoon of Thursday, September 30, 1993, detectives Danny Caudil and
Larry Reese of the Columbus, Ohio, homicide squad answered the call to investigate
the death of thirty-year-old Greg Williams at Williams’ townhouse, the feeling of
wrongness was strong.326
Greg’s wife, Michele, had heard the shot, but did not see the murderer. She told the
detectives what she had seen:
Michele, a sweet young blond who looked like every college man’s dream date,
told her story between sobs while being physically supported by a family friend
to keep from collapsing completely. “You’ve got to catch that guy!” she told the
detectives. Throughout Michele and Greg’s storybook romance, they had been the
perfect couple, and still adored each other, as far as anyone could tell. . .
But something about Michele—the way she told her story or perhaps the condition
of the house—set off the alarm bells in the detective’s minds. It just didn’t feel
right. Michele and her mother were taken to the police station where Michele was
to give her statement, while Caudill and Reese, acting on their hunch, searched the
house. In a cardboard box in an upstairs bedroom, they found a laundry bag. And
in the laundry bag, a .32 caliber revolver. In her purse, sitting in the kitchen, they
found cartridges for the .32, as well as shell casings from the three rounds that had
been ﬁred.327

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Other evidence was found and Michele was eventually convicted of murder.
While the detective is sensitive to how well a suspect’s story ﬁts what is known about the
case, it is sometimes the case that a suspect’s story may be true not because it is likely to
have happened, but because it is unlikely to have happened. In this kind of situation, the
abductive inference made is quite different from inductive inferences that are based on
ﬁnding conﬁrmations of scientiﬁc theory. Consider the following example by the same
author:
When the police entered the house of Robert and Barbara Parks on February 18,
1950, they found Robert, a thirty-eight-year-old retired army captain, in the bed-
room, dead from a gunshot wound. He was lying on the ﬂoor near the door to the
dining room, with a bullet hole in his right side. The autopsy established that the
bullet had passed from right to left through his chest and stopped just on the far
side of his heart.
Park’s wife, Barbara, was twelve years younger than the captain, and the couple
had a history of violent quarrels. She was also known to have telephoned someone
in San Francisco a couple of weeks before, asking for a one-way ticket so she could
leave her husband.
When the police found Barbara, she was hysterical. Her story was that she had
been in the kitchen when she heard a shot. Racing into the bedroom, she found her
husband standing by the door. He said, “Honey, the gun backﬁred,” and then fell
dead.
The murder weapon, an automatic pistol, was lying against the far wall of the dining
room, with one shot ﬁred. The cartridge case had jammed in the ejection port. Foren-
sic investigation showed that Parks could not have been holding the gun himself
when it was ﬁred, regardless of how it could have been thrown across the room.
Barbara Parks was taken to Luray, the nearest reasonably-sized town, and put in
jail.
The investigators had two questions to answer before winding up the case. One
was why Mrs. Parks would tell such an improbable story when so many other more
plausible tales were available to her: for example, self-defense, or she thought he
was a burglar, or he was teaching her how to shoot it when it went off by accident.
The other question was how did the brown-painted hot-air grill in the doorway
between the dining room and the bedroom get a brand-new dent on it that chipped
the paint away down to the metal?
The detectives wrapped up the evidence; gun, bullet, cartridge case, and hot-air
grill were sent to the FBI Crime Laboratory. The FBI technicians veriﬁed that the
bullet that killed Captain Parks had been ﬁred from that gun, as had the cartridge,
and that the gun had been ﬁred from farther away than Parks could have held it.
But what of the dent in the hot-air grill? The technicians matched it with two points
on the slide and hammer of the automatic, and searched for and found microscopic
bits of brown paint from the grill on those spots on the gun. In reconstructing the

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
243
scene they found that if the weapon had discharged as it struck the grill, the bullet
would have hit Parks just where it actually did. Then how did it get all the way
across the room? The only scenario that ﬁt was that Captain Parks, a man with a
violent temper, threw the gun away from him in a ﬁt, it hit the grill and ﬁred, the
bullet hit Parks, the cartridge jammed when the slide was obstructed in its travel
by the heating grill, and then the gun bounced across the dining room.
A ﬁrearms expert from the FBI Crime Laboratory came to Virginia to testify to
these ﬁndings. The judge ruled that Park’s death was an accident. Barbara Parks’

While detectives are trained to look for such evidence and follow their hunches, it is
also the case that ordinary citizens often have their own hunches and make such subtle
inferences in support of a criminal investigation. Consider the following case of murder
in Ypsilanti, Michigan:
The wife of a 53 year-old real estate salesman, William Curtis, was murdered in an
apparent robbery attempt. The suspect, 24 year-old Todd Plamondon, was appre-
hended a hour later driving Curtis’ Cadillac, carrying the gun he used and the wife’s
jewelry; he also had blood stains on his shirt. The crime seemed to be a simple case
of a bungled robbery. But after the pictures of Plamondon and Curtis were shown on
local TV, two Ypsilanti bartenders felt that they had seen something odd that might
be relevant to the case. They called the police and said that they had seen Curtis
and Plamondon meet weekly in their bar a couple of months before the murder.
Why was this important? The two bartenders weren’t sure but they commented:
It was pretty strange to see those two together sitting at the bar. . . Plamondon was
strictly Ypsi [Ypsilanti] local—torn Levis and a T-shirt—but this guy Curtis was
always dressed just like the picture, suit and tie. . . They could come in within ﬁve
minutes of each other, talk quietly for two or three hours and, except for one time,
leave together. . . Todd would talk to me about the bands that would be playing at
night. . . Curtis never introduced himself. He was pretty quiet. . . Curtis always paid
for both of them.
Why was this likely to be relevant to the murder? Well, it showed that Curtis and Plamondon
knew each other well before the murder, making it unlikely that the robbery was just a
random act. It would also be unusual for a conservative businessman to meet regularly
with a scruffy young man half his age, unless the young man was related to him or worked
for him, neither of which was the case here. Further, since Curtis payed for Plamondon’s
food and drink each time they met, it implied that Curtis was more generous than he
needed to be, or was in debt to Plamondon for some reason. If the latter, how could the
wealthier Curtis be in debt to Plamondon—he certainly could not be ﬁnancially in debt to
him (None of these possible interpretations was given by the bartenders at the time, they
simply reported what they believed to be an unusual set of events.). Why did the police
take what the two bartenders said to be reliable or without an ulterior motive? Well, the
bartenders had no obvious connection to Curtis, his wife or Plamondon outside of their
duties as bartenders, so an ulterior motive was not likely. Further, the evidence they gave the
328Op.cit., p. 37.

244
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
police was not, from their point of view, likely to inﬂuence the case in one way or another,
so it had no real “point” to it. It was simply something unusual that they had observed
and thought might be relevant to the guilt or innocence of the individuals involved. It was
also the case that the bartenders were students at nearby Eastern Michigan University who
were bartending to help put themselves through college. It seemed clear that they were
two earnest, responsible young men whose testimony was likely to be true (the article had
a picture of them both looking serious and guileless, one with an EMU sweatshirt on).
On the basis of this hunch, the police investigated further and found that Curtis and
Plamondon had a long term homosexual relationship that pre-dated the murder by some
time. Curtis had, until then, been considered “cooperative” with the police and was “not a
suspect at this point.” But Curtis suddenly ﬂed and was arrested on a fugitive warrant in
Virginia. He was extradited and eventually tried and convicted along with Plamondon.329
It is clear that real detectives make subtle inferences based on their intimate knowledge
of human behavior in the same way that ﬁctional detectives do, and that ordinary citizens
are capable of having their own hunches. Often the use of such subtle clues in criminal
detection are described without any explanation or justiﬁcation:
MIAMI, Aug. 25—The three wooden cargo crates dropped off by a courier at the
international airport in San Juan, P.R., for a Delta Air Lines ﬂight to New York
City looked harmless. But when the courier’s nervousness raised suspicions about
their contents, law-enforcement ofﬁcials looked inside, and found 1,000 pounds
of cocaine.330
Why would the nervousness of the courier indicate that the cargo might contain illegal
drugs? Further, what actions of the courier would be taken as signs of nervousness? The
article doesn’t have to answer these questions because virtually every adult reader of the
New York Times would know the answers. But the reader knows the answers in a special
way. For the ﬁrst question, he may be able to explain why the nervousness of the courier
might indicate that the cargo contained illegal drugs. But for the second question, he might
not be able to explain exactly what nervousness looks like. He still could be said to know
the answer, though—he knows it insofar as he could recognize nervousness were he to
see it (knowing how vs. knowing that). Such explanations are taken at face value because
they draw on our mutual understanding of what Wittgenstein would call the “common
behavior of mankind” or “our natural history”:
The common behavior of mankind is the system of reference by means of which
we interpret an unknown language. [PI §206]
. . . commanding, questioning, recounting, chatting, are as much a part of our natural
history as walking, eating, drinking, playing. [PI §25]
329This description, and the quotation by the bartenders, was drawn from two newspaper articles: “Barkeeps:

Even if the reporter who wrote the article wanted to describe the actions of the courier
that indicated his nervousness he might be at a loss to do so in any kind of complete
or convincing manner. He might be able to describe certain physical movements that the
courier made that indicated his nervousness, such as ﬁdgeting, or being too much in a hurry,
or forgetting to take a receipt for the cargo, or any number of other observable actions. But
each of these physical movements could have an entirely innocuous interpretation, too.
What is it that he did that made authorities think that he was nervous?—Well, he acted
nervous.331 We also make the same kind of subtle inferences based on imponderable
evidence in noncriminal situations:
331It’s interesting that a common tactic for a lawyer who might defend the courier would be to pursue a re-
ductionistic strategy and make the witnesses who noted the courier’s “nervousness” explain, in court, precisely
what they saw in the actions of the courier that made him appear nervous. Inevitably, when the witnesses try to
state exactly what they saw that indicated that the courier was nervous—that the courier’s hands were trembling
or he couldn’t look them in the eye—the defense lawyer can bring up perfectly innocent explanations for this
behavior: that the courier had had little sleep the night before, or was in an unusual hurry for personal reasons.
If the lawyer can show that the witnesses had no certain, unequivocal reasons to interpret the behavior of the
courier as being “nervous,” then he might be able to show that the search of the cargo was illegal and any drugs
found inadmissible as evidence. Such a reductionistic strategy often works for several reasons. First, one aspect
of behavior is that there is no single thing that equates with a characteristic such as “nervousness”:
Our concepts, judgements, reactions never appear in connection with just a single action, but
rather with the whole swirl of human actions. [LWPP II p. 56]
There may be lots of observable things that, together, might indicate nervous behavior, but such a set might
be quite large and would often be both unbounded and varying from situation to situation (e.g., what would a
nervous soldier look like compared to a nervous public speaker, or a nervous adult compared to a nervous child,
etc. There are individual differences, too, since there is a lot of variety in the ways that individuals show their
nervousness. There may be cultural differences, too).
How could human behavior be described? Surely only by sketching the actions of a variety of
humans, as they are all mixed up together. What determines our judgment, our concepts and
reactions, is not what one man is doing now, an individual action, but the whole hurly-burly
of human actions, the background against which we see any action. [Z §567]
This would make it difﬁcult for the witnesses to give a “complete” explanation of what they saw that indicated
the courier was nervous. Further, even if we realize that there may be lots of observable things that, together,
constitute “nervousness,” we may not be able to describe many of them. Wittgenstein comments:
. . . we recognize normal circumstances but cannot precisely describe them. [OC §27]
It may have been the case that there were no necessary and sufﬁcient physical characteristics that indicated that
the courier was nervous; that is, the complete explanation of why the cargo was searched was that the courier
looked nervous:
If I have exhausted the justiﬁcations I have reached bedrock, and my spade is turned. Then I
am inclined to say: “This is simply what I do.” [PI §217]
What Wittgenstein is saying is that describing what “nervousness” looks like may be similar to describing what
coffee tastes like. Coffee doesn’t taste like anything else—coffee tastes like coffee. In the same way, “looking
nervous” may not be the sum of a number of characteristics—“looking nervous” is simply “looking nervous.”
As Wittgenstein puts it:

246
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
After 27 years of patrolling the Golden Gate Bridge, Ron Garcia says that he can
spot potential suicides as adeptly as a cabbie does fares.
Overly purposeful walkers catch his watchful eye, as do those with ﬂimsy clothing
on blustery winter afternoons.
“A lot of the people we pick up are people you’ll spot and you’ll say, ’That one
isn’t right.’ It’s like a sixth sense you come up with,” said Garcia, bridge captain
for Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District.332
While such abductive inferences are dramatic, making good newscopy, we make similar
less spectacular assessments of others on a regular basis: when we meet friends, we can
often assess their mood just by looking at them or listening to their tone of voice; we
judge others we don’t know by their mannerisms and the circumstances surrounding our
meeting—a complete stranger who approaches us upon our arrival at a large airport late
at night and offers us a ride wherever we want to go might be looked upon with suspicion,
perhaps even fear, while the same stranger coming up to us on a busy city street at noon
asking for directions to a restaurant may be seen as quite ordinary, even sympathetic.
We often assess the intentions of others—whether they are dissembling or biased in their
statements—by similar asessments of subtle, imponderable evidence. And this ability to
assess intentions is an ability that appears very early in our development. Consider the
following description of a study of infant behavior reported in Science News:
Each of us constantly makes assumptions about what other folks believe, want, and
feel. Now, a new study shows that these inferences about our compatriots’ mental
states may have developmental roots in the ﬁrst year of life.
By about age 1, infants tend to attribute positive or negative intentions to self-
propelled objects that pursue simple goals, assert David Premack and Ann James
The expression “that is all that happens” sets limits to what we call “happening.”
Here the temptation is overwhelming to say something further, when everything has already
been described.—Whence this pressure? What analogy, what wrong interpretation produces
it?
Here we come up against a remarkable and characteristic phenomenon in philosophical in-
vestigation: the difﬁculty—I might say—is not that of ﬁnding the solution but rather that of
recognizing as the solution something that looks as if it were only a preliminary to it. “We have
already said everything.—Not anything that follows from this, no, this itself is the solution!”
This is connected, I believe, with our wrongly expecting an explanation, whereas the solution
of the difﬁculty is a description, if we give it the right place in our considerations. If we dwell
upon it, and do not try to get beyond it.
The difﬁculty here is: to stop.
“Why do you demand explanations? If they are given you, you will once more be facing a
terminus. They cannot get you any further than you are at present.” [Z §§312– 315]
“All that happen[ed]” was that the courier “looked nervous.” Here, bad epistemology becomes good legal strategy.

Premack, psychologists at the National Center for Scientiﬁc Research in Paris,
France.
This suggests that infants have an inherent capacity for discerning such intentions
in the goal-directed actions of their parents or anyone else they observe, argues
David Premack.
...
These responses support the theory that infants possess a basic knowledge about
intentional actions, the investigators assert in a report accepted for publication in
Cognition.
Nonetheless, only older children, beginning between age 3 and 5, understand that
others may hold distinct mental states, such as false beliefs. “A major question is
how the transition occurs from basic intentional knowledge to an understanding of
mental states,” David Premack contends.333
While assessments of other’s thoughts or intentions can be right or wrong, they can often
be justiﬁed and we can even argue about the validity of such inferences. Consider a critical
book review by New York Times reviewer Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of a prominent
book about the Kennedy’s: The Last Brother, by Joe McGinniss:
How do you read Joe McGinniss’s new biography of Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
“The Last Brother,” without being overwhelmed by the tempest it has already cre-
ated? You try to read it objectively, but it all too quickly becomes apparent that its
problems are even greater than anticipated. The book isn’t bad; it’s awful.
...
Writing classes of the future will be richly rewarded by studying the art of inferred
hypotheses as wielded in “The Last Brother.” My favorite is Mr. McGinniss’s ex-
planation for what he perceives to be Senator Kennedy’s rather sudden marriage
to Joan Bennett: “It is true that no child was born the following year, but also true
that if Joan had miscarried (and she later had at least three miscarriages, as well as
three children), it would not have been a development the Ambassador [the Sen-
ator’s father] would have publicized.” From this, one is supposed to conclude that
because no announcement of a miscarriage was made, Mr. Kennedy married Ms.
Bennett because she was pregnant.
As for imagining thoughts: nothing surpasses the way Mr. McGinniss has it both
ways trying to read Joseph P. Kennedy’s mind long after the former Ambassador
to the Court of St. James’s had lost the ability to communicate because of his
stroke: “Whatever his agonies, they would be locked inside him until death set
him free. And whatever his sins, this punishment seemed sufﬁciently severe: to be
forced, every waking hour, to confront the stark fact that his drive for power, glory
and freedom from the laws that governed man had been satisﬁed only through the
spilling of his children’s blood.”
But the area that raises the greatest difﬁculties in “The Last Brother” is Mr. McGin-
niss’s uncritical appropriation of sources. Any rumor that suits his purposes is fair
333”Tots show signs of intentional minds,” Science News, vol. 149, p. 118, 24 February 1996.

248
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
game. For instance, he cites the speculation by John F. Kennedy’s biographer Nigel
Hamilton that Joseph P. Kennedy may have sexually abused his daughter Rose-
mary and thereby caused the emotional disturbance that later led him to have her
lobotomized, presumably to remove an embarrassing stain from the family’s image.
After balancing this speculation with mention of Ms. Goodwin’s heated refutation
of “any such notion,” he hits us ungently with how he imagines Rosemary’s sudden
disappearance might have affected his subject as a youth: “In the absence of any
assurances to the contrary, it might well have begun to seem to the 9-year-old Teddy
that this could be the price of failure within the family: to suddenly cease to exist.”
[“Ms. Goodwin” is Doris Kearns Goodwin who is another Kennedy biographer:
The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys, Simon and Schuster, 1987]
Where Mr. McGinniss’s indiscriminate use of sources gets him into severe difﬁcul-
ties is in his uncritical embrace of the unproved theory that the Maﬁa assassinated
John F. Kennedy for failing to oust Fidel Castro and revive the mob’s criminal stake
in Cuba, an obligation that Mr. McGinniss says the Kennedys incurred when Joseph
P. accepted illegal election help for his son in West Virginia and Illinois.
Mr. McGinniss’s version of this conspiracy is built out of highly speculative books
like [3 books are mentioned]
...
And what is Mr. McGinniss’s point in embracing such half-baked history? Not
to buttress one conspiracy theory against another, but simply to milk the reader’s
sympathy for Senator Kennedy.
. . . one of Mr. McGinniss’s most spectacular thought inferences [concerns] when
his subject is considering whether to run for the Presidency in 1968, after his brother
Robert has been killed: “He knew the time was not right, but he knew also that for
him, the time would never be right. Why not just jump in and get it done? Maybe
somebody would shoot him and then he, too, could die a hero, like his brothers.
Then the family destiny would be complete.”334
Lehmann-Haupt does a surgical job of exposing the improper use of imponderable ev-
idence in McGinness’ book. He gives examples where McGinniss appears to read the
literal thoughts of many of the principal characters, something that is tough to do for
those with whom we are not intimate. If Teddy Kennedy were to speculate on what John
Kennedy may have thought at one time or another, it might be more believable than McGin-
niss’ ruminations. In spite of the subtlety and even ad hoc character of such imponderable
inferences, there seem to be criteria that can lend or take away support for them. Lehmann-
Haupt’s attribution of a motive for McGinniss’ speculation merely adds another reason
why McGinniss seems to have gone beyond the bounds of such legitimate inference.
This is not to say that what we take as evidence for some subtle phenomenon cannot
change or be culturally contingent. At the Salem Witch Trials in 1692 the evidence used
to substantiate the guilt of the witches were the reports of several young girls that the
334“The Minds of the Kennedys as Imagined by McGinniss.” Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York
Times, 29 July 1993.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
249
supposed witches had appeared in their dreams. That is, the witches appeared in the girls’
dreams because they, the witches, chose to appear in them. At that time it was generally
believed that only witches could chose to appear in others’ dreams, so the individuals who
appeared in the girls’ dream must have been witches. Such an inference in a court of law
in present-day New England would be, of course, absurd.
One of the more common places for challenges to inferences to be made is in a criminal
trial. This is often where imponderable evidence is debated and sometimes transformed
into ponderable evidence. Consider the murder trial of Eric and Lyle Menendez:
As jurors showed up for another week of deliberations today in the murder trial of
Lyle and Erik Menendez, the two panels appeared to be struggling with the trial’s
central issue: whether the brothers told the truth when they said they killed their
parents out of fear for their lives.
Prosecutors challenged the brothers’ account that they killed out of fear arguing
that they had planned the killings, concocted an elaborate alibi and then lavishly
spent their parents’ money after the shootings.
The prosecution says that the brothers killed to inherit $14 million from an over-
bearing father and to eliminate their mother as a witness.
The brothers said they had bought shotguns at a San Diego sporting goods store for
protection. But the prosecution said the manner of the purchase showed that they
had tried to cover their tracks: they went out of town, used false identiﬁcation and
paid in cash, even though they usually used credit cards for purchases.335
Conversational Implicatures
While we have concentrated here on how we uncover the plausible truth that lies behind our
hunches, it is also the case that we often bring unquestioned assumptions to our daily social
interactions; that is, in a given situation we do not uncover or infer everything. Some of our
understanding consists of implicit assumptions about what is the case. This is particularly
true in our use of language. Paul Grice has identiﬁed a number of assumptions that
each speaker brings to ordinary discourse; he calls these “Conversational Implicatures.”
Conversational Implicatures are based on what Grice terms the “Cooperative Principle”:
Ourtalkexchangesdonotnormallyconsistofasuccessionofdisconnectedremarks,
and would not be rational if they did. They are characteristically, to some degree at
least, cooperative efforts; and each participant recognizes in them, to some extent,
a common purpose or set of purposes, or at least a mutually accepted direction.336
We engage in conversation to do things: we ask questions to gain information; we assert
things to convince others that such-and-such is the case; we talk informally to others to
establish or maintain relationships; we direct others to do things; we make promises; etc.
335“Juries Ask: Did Brothers Kill Parents Out of Fear?,” The New York Times, 28 December 1993.

MA, 1989. (***cf. G’s criticisms of W in Hacker’s Witt’s Place in 20th century Analytic Philosophy pp. 245ff)

250
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
In each of these activities the participants normally have a mutual interest in the success of
the communication: if we make a promise, our listener is interested in having the promise
be made clearly and properly; if we ask a question, our answerer is interested in our
being correctly answered; if we chat casually, both of us are interested in maintaining our
relationship; etc. Since it is far too arduous a task to test the other’s cooperative sincerity
each time one engages in a conversation, we generally begin our conversations with the
assumption that our participant is cooperating with us, that is, he wants the conversation
we are having to proceed as faithfully as possible. This is not to say that we will always
ﬁnd our conversational partners cooperative: others may exaggerate, dissemble or mislead
us, or otherwise violate this principle of cooperation. But it is the case that people do
cooperate so frequently that it is generally practical to assume someone is cooperating
unless there is evidence to the contrary.
Grice does not discuss why such cooperation would be useful since you could still fulﬁll the
purposes of conversation without being cooperative. It is clear, though, that the assumption
of cooperation makes conversation much more efﬁcient than it would be without such an
assumption. Without this assumption, all cooperation and all the implicatures (which we
will discuss below) would have to be tested at the beginning of each conversation. Again,
that doesn’t prevent the attainment of conversational goals, but it does make such activities
extraordinarily inefﬁcient. The nearest analog to the assumption of noncooperation—or
the non-assumption of cooperation—is the vetting of testimony in a court of law. Here
all testimony must be tested and found truthful to be admitted to the purposes of the
court. This is a long, often inconclusive process—certainly not the kind of process that
we would want to govern our everyday conversations. The most plausible rationale, then,
for the assumption of cooperation is that it makes the conversational process faster and
more efﬁcient. But this rationale is not just speculation, it ﬁts with an older view of
language proposed by George Zipf. Zipf theorized that language use was governed by the
Principle of Least Effort. For Zipf, during any communicative act we have a speaker and
a hearer. For the speaker and the hearer to understand each other they must both engage
in a certain amount of effort: the speaker must ﬁnd the right words in language to say
what he wants to say; the hearer, on the other hand, must interpret what the speaker says in
order to understand it fully. We are all governed, Zipf said, by the Principle of Least Effort,
that is, we will try to expend the least effort we can to get a job done at a desired level
of effectiveness. Neither the speaker nor the hearer wants to expend any more cognitive
effort in conversation than he has to. But there is a problem here. For the speaker, he would
expend the least amount of effort if he could be as terse in his speech as possible—in the
extreme case he might utter a single word for all his communicative acts. Most of the effort
would fall on the hearer who must ﬁgure out what the speaker means by this single word
uttered in a wide range of situations and circumstances (one can imagine an autocratic ruler
who merely grunts when he wants something leaving it up to his frantic subjects to ﬁgure
out what he might desire). So while the speaker expends a minimal amount of effort, the
hearer must expend an exceptionally large amount of effort. On the other hand, the hearer
can expend the least amount of effort if he can force the speaker to state everything in
great and extensive detail so no possible ambiguity would be left unexplained (consider our
autocratic ruler again, forcing his subjects to explain themselves in wearying detail while
he lounges on his throne eating grapes). This situation, of course, would cause the speaker
to expend a tremendous amount of effort. For Zipf, either of these extreme alternatives

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
251
requires a non-minimal amount of total effort when considering the speaker and the hearer
together, that is, when considering the total act of conversation. According to Zipf, the
minimum of effort occurs in conversation when both the speaker and the hearer make
reasonable efforts to communicate. Speciﬁcally, the speaker gives up his idea of using just
one word to express many different things, and expands the number of words he uses so
the hearer doesn’t constantly need to ﬁgure out the different meanings the same words
might have. The hearer, on the other hand, relaxes his insistence that the speaker explain
himself in great and unambiguous detail in each utterance, and agrees to let the speaker
use some general words multiple times and permits him a certain amount of vagueness of
expression that can be clariﬁed by the context or circumstances of the utterance or some
other knowledge the hearer may have. The hearer, then, must expend a reasonable amount
of effort to decipher some tolerated ambiguities of the speaker’s expressions. According
to Zipf, this tacit agreement between speaker and hearer will cause a “balance” of effort
to be reached which causes a minimum amount of total effort to be expended during the
conversational process. For Zipf, the foundation of language use—in fact, the foundation
of all behavior—is the desire to expend the least amount of effort in the process. In his
Principle of Cooperation, Grice has articulated one of the mechanisms that Zipf claimed
would be necessary for conversationalists to communicate as efﬁciently as possible; that
is, with the least amount of effort.337
Grice’s Principle of Cooperation is based on the satisfaction of nine maxims which fall
into four categories: Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Manner:
There are two maxims of Quantity:
1. Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of
the exchange).
2. Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.
Two maxims of Quality:
1. Do not say what you believe to be false.
2. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.
One maxim of Relation:
1. Say only what you believe to be relevant.
Four maxims of Manner:
1. Avoid obscurity of expression.
337Zipf”s theory of language is extensive and detailed, and has some strong correlations with Wittgenstein’s
philosophy of language, especially with Wittgenstein’s notion that words are like tools. For a more detailed
description of this relationship, see Blair’s Language and Representation in Information Retrieval [Elsevier
Science, New York/Amsterdam, 1990], especially pages 139ff. Zipf’s theory is developed most extensively in
his Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort. [Hafner, NY, 1965 (Facsimile of the 1949 edition).]

252
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
2. Avoid ambiguity.
3. Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity).
4. Be orderly.
Conversation begins with the participants’ assumption that all nine maxims are being
followed by the participants. Some maxims are clearly more important than others: an
individualwhoexpresseshimselfobscurelywouldlikelybelesscriticizedthanonewhohas
knowingly stated something false. Grice also points out that there is some interdependence
among the maxims, notably, that many of the maxims only become relevant if the ﬁrst
maxim of Quality is satisﬁed. It is also the case that other maxims might be added to
this list (Grice comments that other maxims of Manner might be necessary). Be that as it
may, we are not looking for a complete theory here, but only some indication of what the
structure and dynamics of these implicatures might be. In fact, what Grice has outlined
are some of the components of conversational Language Games.
The importance of the assumption of cooperation cannot be overstated. For example,
consider the following situation: I come in to work in the morning. As I walk past the
secretary I ask if my colleague Bill has arrived yet. The secretary replies, “I saw a yellow
Volkswagen in the parking lot.” Taken literally, this is a bizarre, even incomprehensible
statement. But if I make the assumptions that the secretary has understood my question
and has tried to satisfy the maxims of cooperation to the best of his ability, then I may
be able to make sense out of the seemingly odd statement. That is, the reference to the
“yellow Volkswagen” must be relevant to my question, so a reasonable supposition is that
it refers to Bill’s car. The secretary must also know that I know that if Bill were to be in
his ofﬁce he would have driven and parked his car in the lot this morning. The secretary
would also know that, in general, yellow Volkswagens are uncommon enough that the
appearance of one in a parking lot is likely to be a unique event, indicating the presence
of a particular driver, in this case, Bill. The secretary would also have to assume that I
would be aware of such general information too. Contrast the above statement with the
statement (in answer to my question), “I saw a white car in the parking lot.” What does
that tell me about Bill’s presence? Not much. Even if Bill owns a white car, so do a lot of
other people. The presence or absence of a white car in the parking lot tells me little that I
want to know. (Interestingly, it does tell me something about the secretary—either he has
entirely misunderstood my question, does not have a good grasp of basic facts, like the
comparative rarity of white cars, is making some kind of joke, or has just gone silly.)
But the maxims that Grice has identiﬁed are not just members of a static list, they are
the foundation for a number of extremely subtle communicative acts. Let’s look at some
of these. In the ﬁrst place, the maxims are subject to variation based on other aspects of
the circumstances or context in which the conversation takes place. For example, a study
showed that if someone with a New York accent asks directions on a New York City street,
he will generally be given brief, explicit directions. But if someone with a Texas accent
asks for the same directions in exactly the same way as the New Yorker did, the person he
asks will often give him much more detailed instructions than he gave the New Yorker.
The direction-giver has automatically altered the maxim of Quantity—he has increased

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
253
the level of informativeness he assumes is needed for the Texan. Why? Because, on the
basis of the Texan’s accent alone, the direction-giver has surmised that he, the Texan, is
not as likely to be as familiar with New York City as an typical New Yorker might be.
Consequently, the Texan would need more detailed street directions (“See that street behind
you? Go up there two blocks to Broadway, take a left. . . ”), rather than broader references
to unconnected landmarks (“Go to Grant’s Tomb, then. . . ”). We do the same sort of thing
when talking to small children, altering the level of informativeness and perhaps some of
the maxims of Manner to talk to them “at their level.” The degree by which we alter the
levels of satisfaction for the maxims is not something that we calculate. It is something
we do based on experience, and the immediate feedback that we might receive from the
person we are talking to (e.g., if we are too detailed in our statements our listener might
say, “OK, OK, you don’t have to be so detailed, I understand the basics.”). But there are
times when it may be impossible to fulﬁll all of the maxims, even if the speaker wants to do
so. For example, we may not be as informative as we know we should be without violating
the second maxim of Quality: to say only that for which we have adequate evidence.
Of particular importance is the subtle information that can be conveyed through the sys-
tematic violation of one or more of the maxims. That is, it is not just what we say that is
part of the informativeness of a conversation, our level of compliance with the maxims of
cooperation also convey important information. For example, suppose I ask a friend why
our car won’t start. He replies that it is undoubtedly because I am out of gas. Yet I know
that there are innumerable other reasons why my car might not start—wet or grounded
electrical system, low battery cranking voltage, poor fuel and oxygen mixture, bad spark
plugs, etc. By giving a simplistic answer, my friend has violated the ﬁrst maxim of Quan-
tity: he has not been as informative as he should have. If I can assume that he has not
done this on purpose, his lack of informativeness tells me that he knows little about the
workings of an automobile. Yet, he has nowhere explicitly admitted to such, and probably
does not even know how naive he really is.
Let’s look at some examples of how the intentional violation of the maxims can be used
to inform the listener of something implicit in the exchange. Consider a high school
student asking a mathematics instructor how to do a particular calculation. The instructor
explains how to do it, but the student still doesn’t understand. The instructor then explains
the calculation again, this time in somewhat more detail. The student claims that he still
does not understand how to do the calculation. This is repeated a number of times. Finally,
the instructor begins to explain the calculation including trivial detail: “First you ﬁnd a
pencil, then you get a piece of paper, then you add the ﬁrst two numbers by making marks
on the paper with the pencil and counting the marks, 1, 2, 3, 4 . . . ” It should be obvious to
the student that the instructor is purposefully including too much detail for a high school
student. If the student believes that the instructor is sincere in wanting to teach him,
and that although he made a reasonable effort to explain the calculation, the student must
explain why the instructor has switched from being helpful, to being obviously not helpful.
The most likely explanation is that the instructor is irritated at the student’s inability to
understand her, and is telling him, basically, “I’ve tried to explain this to you, but you
don’t seem to be making an effort to understand what I am saying (or, you didn’t come
adequately prepared), therefore I am no longer willing to help you. You must ﬁnd some
other means of learning the calculation.”

254
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Another kind of intentional violation of the cooperative principle might be willful equiv-
ocation. For example, we ask our friend, “I didn’t see you at the meeting last Wednesday,
where were you?” Our friend answers, “I couldn’t make it.” Since he offers no more expla-
nation, we might pursue the issue with, “Why couldn’t you make it?” If our friend answers
this with, “Some other things came up” he has not only not told us what prevented him from
attending the meeting, he has also implied that he does not want to tell us the reason, either.
Or, another example: I ask a friend, “Is Jennifer seeing Stuart again?” He responds, “I saw
his car parked at her house the other evening.” I reply, “Are you saying that she is seeing
him?” Our friend replies, “I didn’t say that!” Of course our friend really is saying that he
believes Jennifer is seeing Stuart, but by implying it then denying that he is implying it
he is really saying, in effect, “I think that she is seeing him, but don’t tell anyone that I
said so!” Here our friend is violating the maxim to say only that which he believes to be
true. He asserts something—that Jennifer is seeing Stuart again—while at the same time
denying that he is asserting it (he is not only violating one of the maxims of Quality, he is
also stating that he is violating it).
Wittgenstein and Behaviorism
The mind-body dualism has been both a persistent framework and a longstanding irritant
in philosophy. Plato was the ﬁrst major ﬁgure to make this distinction, but it was Descartes
who ﬁrst proposed a system based on the nature and interrelationships between mind and
body. This dualism is attractive because it models two kinds of seemingly separate entities,
or, at least, two different kinds of statements. But maintaining the dualism poses obvious
problems about how, if mind and body are separate entities, they can interact, for clearly
they do. Some theories of interaction suffer from the same inﬁnite regression of Aristo-
tle’s third-man criticism of Plato (see the previous section “Universals and Particulars-An
Old Debate”). It is beyond the scope of this discussion to present the rich history of the
mind-body debate, but some discussion of it can illuminate Wittgenstein’s position vis `a
vis behaviorism, and help us to understand his later philosophy. One possible solution to
the mind-body distinction, which we have already discussed, is to defeat this dualism by
reducing the mind to the body—that is, reducing mental processes to brain states (this is
commonly called “materialism”). We have already shown how Wittgenstein rejects this
“solution.” Another monistic “solution” is to go in the opposite direction and reduce the
mind to the externally observable body—that is, to reduce mental processes to behavior.
Because Wittgenstein continually forced our investigation of meaning away from inter-
nal, mental phenomena towards outer, observable phenomena his epistemology is often
seen to be some form of behaviorism. What’s important is not whether Wittgenstein is
a behaviorist or not—and there are lots of different versions of behaviorism that could
apply—but whether any of these versions of behaviorism when applied to Wittgenstein’s
work is at all misleading. It is my contention that labeling Wittgenstein’s epistemology a
form of “behaviorism” misrepresents his work in important ways. Behaviorism traces its
antecedents back to Thomas Hobbes who attempted to interpret all mental states as forms
of matter in motion. But modern, more attractive forms of behaviorism began in the early
20th century with J.B. Watson. Watson wanted to establish psychology as an objective
science by freeing it of the subjectivism of introspection:

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
255
The committed behaviorist, Watson declared, will drop “from his scientiﬁc vocabu-
lary all subjective terms such as sensation, perception, image, desire, purpose, and
even thinking and emotion as they were subjectively deﬁned.” This is not merely
because these concepts are insufﬁciently sharply deﬁned for “scientiﬁc purposes.”
Rather, there is no such thing as consciousness as traditionally conceived. “The
belief in the existence of consciousness,” he wrote contemptuously, “goes back
to the ancient days of superstition and magic.” The scientiﬁc psychologist “can
do without the terms ’mind’ and ’consciousness,’ indeed he can ﬁnd no objective
evidence for their existence.” Hence “the behaviorist recognizes no such things as
mental traits, dispositions or tendencies.”338
Since Watson, psychologists, such as Skinner have offered alternative versions of behav-
iorism, in particular, alternative descriptions of what counts as behavior (Watson’s notion
of behavior was so broad that it included even physiological processes such as the beating
of the heart, while Skinner proposed that only the “action of the organism upon the outside
world” should count as behavior.).339 In philosophy, as we pointed out, behaviorism is a
direct attack on the duality of the mind and the body. We can identify three major kinds
of behaviorism: metaphysical, methodological and logical. Metaphysical behaviorism is
the most extreme version, denying that there are mental phenomena at all; methodological
behaviorism does not deny mental phenomena, but it stipulates that they should not be
used to explain behavior since they are not directly accessible by more than one individ-
ual; logical behaviorism claims that statements about mental phenomena or processes are
semantically equivalent to statements about behavior.340
Philosopher Gilbert Ryle offered the most sustained attack on mind-body dualism in his
The Concept of Mind341 where he termed the Cartesian view “. . . the dogma of the
ghost in the machine.” Ryle’s work is often called behaviorism, but Wittgenstein’s early
work is most closely associated with Carnap’s logical behaviorism which he, Carnap,
called “physicalism.” So similar were some of Wittgenstein’s early views with Carnap’s
that Wittgenstein accused him of plagiarism in 1932.342 The dispute is curious, since, as

iorism [Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, and Co, London, 1924] pp. 5f (ﬁrst three quotations), 2, 18, and 98,
respectively.
339For the antecedents of modern behaviorism, see, principally: Thomas Hobbes. De Corpore; J.B. Watson.
op.cit. B.F. Skinner. The Behavior of Organisms. NY, 1938. Skinner made the most effort to extend his
version of behaviorism beyond the traditional boundaries of psychological research. Of particular interest is his
behavioral interpretation of linguistic meaning in Verbal Behavior (New York, 1957). Noam Chomsky’s strident
criticism of Skinner’s theory of language in his review of Verbal Behavior was the opening clarion call of his
enormously inﬂuential theory of transformational grammar, which dominated linguistics for the next several
decades (Chomsky’s review appeared in Language, vol. 35, pp. 26–58, 1959).
340Behaviorism can also be distinguished as either molar or molecular. Molar behaviorism investigates the
relations between stimuli and observable responses, while molecular behaviorism attempts to discover the phys-
iological laws that underly and support the relations found by molar behaviorism.

When Wittgenstein resumed philosophy in 1929, behaviorism was deﬁnitely in the air. There
is no evidence to suggest that he read Watson’s book, but he certainly read Russell’s Analysis
of Mind, in which Watson’s ideas are discussed. It seems likely that at some stage he at least

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Hacker points out, Wittgenstein never gave what could be described as a logical behaviorist
version of ﬁrst-person psychological statements.343 He did give something like a logical
behavior analysis of third-person psychological assertions, but that is not sufﬁcient to
label him a behaviorist. From that point, Wittgenstein’s subsequent philosophy moved
much farther away from the model of logical behaviorism, although many readers of his
later work still insist that it harbors behaviorist ideas, at least implicitly. Such a belief is
unwarranted, as we shall see.
Wittgenstein vs. Behaviorism: What is “Behavior”?
Perhaps the most fundamental difference that Wittgenstein has with behaviorism would be
over the deﬁnition or concept of “behavior” itself. Most behaviorists insist that behavior
consists of observable human actions, either at the social level, for molar behaviorism,
or at the physiological level, for molecular behaviorism. Wittgenstein would accept the
relevance of certain physical movements, but considers them only part of what he would
call behavior. If behavior were merely physical movements, then we should be able to
photograph behavior. As Wittgenstein put it:
looked at Carnap’s Logische Aufbau, and he deﬁnitely read the ﬁrst of the Erkenntnis ar-
ticles in 1932, which occasioned a quarrel. Wittgenstein accused Carnap of plagiarism, and
held that Carnap’s ideas concerning physicalism were derived from the Tractatus, conversa-
tions Wittgenstein had held with Waismann and Schlick in which Carnap had participated,
and reports of Wittgenstein’s new ideas circulated to members of the Vienna Circle by Wais-
mann. He abruptly severed relations with Carnap. [Hacker, Wittgenstein, Meaning and
Mind. Part I: Essays, p. 105 (Vol. 3 of an Analytic Commentary on the Philosophical
Investigations). Blackwell, Oxford, 1990. The full name of Carnap’s book is Der Logische
Aufbau der Welt. Berlin, 1928 (English translation: The Logical Structure of the World,
translated by R.A. George. Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1967). Carnap’s two articles
appeared in Erkenntnis, pp. 432–465, II, 1932; and Erkenntnis, pp. 165–197, III, 1932/
1933.]
The philosophical connection between analytic philosophy and behaviorism did not originate with Carnap but
with Bertrand Russell eleven years earlier. In the preface to his Analysis of Mind (1921) he states:
I think that what has permanent value in the outlook of the behaviorists is the feeling that
physics is the most fundamental science at present in existence.
The conﬂation of psychology and physics—more precisely, behaviorism and empiricism—gave the hope of
a “uniﬁed science” as at least a theoretical possibility. Such a concept would have had great appeal to the
philosophical group called the Vienna Circle, of which Carnap was a part. Wittgenstein’s view of such a synthesis
could be inferred from his statement about the “barrenness of psychology” in which he insisted that psychology
is not like physics, at all (see footnote 241, supra).[The above quotation by Russell is not meant to imply that
he agreed entirely with Watson’s, or behaviorism’s views. Quite to the contrary, there is one tenet of Watson’s
behaviorism that he explicitly rejects:
[Behaviorism’s] denial of images is indefensible: they cannot be interpreted as actual small
sensations, or as words. Quoted by R. Monk in his Bertrand Russell: The Spirit of Solitude:
1872–1921, p. 545. Free Press, NY, 1996.]
343Ibid.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
257
If behaviourism is correct, then it would be intelligible to say that a camera
perceives.344
Yet it is clear that ﬁlming human actions does not necessarily record legitimate behavior.
Consider a ﬁlm which depicts two actors making an agreement and shaking hands. Did
they really make an agreement? No, it only looks that way—they just “went through the
motions.” But the ﬁlm by itself cannot tell us that for it could just as easily be used to
record an actual agreement (between heads of state, for example).
Laughing, joking, arguing, persuading, being afraid, being happy, being depressed, etc.
All these “behaviors” call up easy images of individuals manifesting them. But because
these images are so easy to imagine, we often don’t see some important aspects of the
behavior they represent. To shake us out of these easy images, Wittgenstein gives us a
number of examples of the behavior of animals:
Can I then speak of one behaviour of anger, for example, and of another of hope?
(It is easy to imagine an orang-utan angry—but hopeful? And why is it like this?)
[RPP I §314]
Onecanimagineananimalangry,frightened,unhappy,happy,startled.Buthopeful?
And why not?
A dog believes his master is at the door. But can he also believe his master will
come the day after to-morrow?—And what can he not do here?—How do I do
it?—How am I supposed to answer this? [PI p. 174]345
Wittgenstein answers this question, ironically, in an earlier part of Philosophical Inves-
tigations:
Why can’t a dog simulate pain? Is he too honest? Could one teach a dog to simulate
pain? Perhaps it is possible to teach him to howl on particular occasions as if he
were in pain, even when he is not. But the surroundings which are necessary for
this behaviour to be real simulation are missing. [PI §250]
We can imagine a dog frightened or happy, but not hopeful or simulating pain. A dog can
be frightened or happy not just because of his actions, but because there are legitimate
circumstances in which we might ﬁnd dogs where these behaviors would be seen as
genuine. A dog can’t be hopeful or simulate pain because we cannot imagine the dog being
in circumstances which would legitimate such behavior. What about people? How would
we portray a person who is angry? Well, we should remember Wittgenstein’s “Dramatic
Theory of Meaning” (q.v.):
344Wittgenstein’s unpublished “Big Typescript” (ca. 1933) p. 462. Cited by Nicholas Gier in his Wittgenstein and
Phenomenology: A Comparative Study of the Later Wittgenstein, Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty,
p. 135. State University of New York Press, Albany, NY, 1981.
345In LWPP II, §§358–360 are similar to the ﬁrst two statements, supra, but they include the following statement
between them in §359:
For hoping is quiet, joyful expectation. (Even though there is something repugnant about this
kind of analysis.)

258
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The best example of an expression with a very speciﬁc meaning is a passage in a
play. [LWPP I §424]
The director of a play might have an actor portray anger by scowling, raising his voice (if
talking), acting agitated, perhaps shaking his ﬁst, etc. Circumstances seem to play less of a
role here; just the mannerisms of the individual in question seem to be sufﬁcient to convey
anger, and these mannerisms would probably be convincing in just about any normal
context. But what about portraying a person who is hopeful? Unlike anger, there are no
obvious expressions or other physical mannerisms that are uniquely characteristic of being
hopeful. Something more is needed, we need the right “stage settings,” as Wittgenstein
reminds us. How would we portray being hopeful in a play? Well, it would require more
context than portraying anger. Imagine a scene in a play: a man is wheeled into an operating
room for a dangerous operation, his wife bids him goodbye with tears in her eyes. Some
time later, the surgeon enters the room where the wife is waiting. She looks up as he
approaches her. Can’t we say here that she looks hopeful? And what about a dog’s expecting
his master to come the day after tomorrow? Can we devise a scene in a play that would
convey that to an audience? Probably not.
We might take Wittgenstein’s use of plays to demonstrate meaning and behavior a step
further: behavior might be explained as that which can be portrayed and understood in a
play. This sounds enough like a deﬁnition to make anyone who understands Wittgenstein
uncomfortable. But, like Wittgenstein’s coupling of meaning and use, we can certainly say
that for a large class of cases—though not for all—we can explain behavior as that which
can be portrayed and understood in a play.346 It does not hold for all cases because we can
portray some impossible behavior in a play—like someone ﬂying (using a wire), someone
disappearing in a puff of smoke, someone reading someone else’s mind, etc. But, again,
for a large number of cases, what can be portrayed in a play is a touchstone of legitimate
human behavior, and while some behaviors portrayed in a play are not legitimate behaviors,
there are no legitimate human behaviors that cannot be portrayed in a play. This is as close
to a deﬁnition of behavior as we can get. The importance of the right circumstances to
legitimate behavior can be seen in the following example:
Why can’t my right hand give my left hand money?—My right hand can put it into
my left hand. My right hand can write a deed of gift and my left hand a receipt.—
But the further practical consequences would not be those of a gift. When the left
hand has taken the money from the right, etc., we shall ask: “Well, and what of it?”
[PI §268]
Ifcircumstancesandcontextarenotnecessaryforlegitimatingbehavior,thenmyrighthand
really could give my left hand a gift by just making the appropriate bodily movements.
But if we try to deﬁne behavior as just bodily movements, there is a further problem,
namely, that the same bodily movements, without reference to context or circumstances,
could mean a wide variety of things. That is, it would be impossible to tell what speciﬁc,
346The quotation I allude to is:
For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word “meaning” it
can be explained thus: the meaning of a word is its use in language. [PI §43]

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
259
bodily movements meant outside of the relevant circumstances. For example, imagine two
individuals shaking hands: are they actually shaking hands, or is one pulling the other
by the hand? Even if they were just shaking hands, are they shaking hands to seal an
agreement, shaking hands to say “hello,” or, are they shaking hands for the beneﬁt of a
photographer. Two hands clasped together tell us very little. This is what Wittgenstein is
getting at in the following example:
Suppose we were observing the movement of a point (for example, a point of light
on a screen). It might be possible to draw important consequences of the most
various kinds from the behavior of this point. And what a variety of observations
can be made here!—This is how it is with the behavior of man; with the different
characteristic features which we observe in this behavior. [PI p. 179]
Wittgenstein’s analogies make us aware of how important circumstances are for legitimat-
ing all human behaviors. Now we can understand Wittgenstein’s description of what he
means by “behavior”:
Take the various psychological phenomena: thinking, pain, anger, joy, wish, fear,
intention, memory etc.,—and compare the behavior corresponding to each.—But
what does behavior include here? Only the play of facial expression and the ges-
tures? Or also the surrounding, so to speak the occasion of this expression? And if
one does include the surrounding as well,—how is the behavior to be compared in
the case of anger and in that of memory, for example? [RPP I §129]
Wittgenstein answers these questions 34 pages later:
. . . the word “behaviour,” as I am using it, is altogether misleading, for it includes
in its meaning the external circumstances—of the behaviour in a narrower sense.
[RPP I §314]
So now we see behavior as consisting of speciﬁc physical/bodily movements embedded
within legitimating context and circumstances. But when we observe behavior, even in
speciﬁc circumstances, what is it we actually see—just physical movements? Wittgenstein
remarks:
“I see that the child wants to touch the dog, but doesn’t dare.” How can I see
that?—Is this description of what is seen on the same level as a description of
moving shapes and colours? Is an interpretation in question? Well, remember that
you may also mimic a human being who would like to touch something, but doesn’t
dare. And what you mimic is after all a piece of behavior. But you will perhaps be
able to give a characteristic imitation of this behavior only in a wider context.
One will also be able to say: What this description says will get its expression
somehow in the movement and the rest of the behavior of the child, but also in the
spatial and temporal surrounding.
But now am I to say that I really “see” the fearfulness in this behavior—or that I
really “see” the facial expression? Why not? But that is not to deny the difference
between two concepts of what is perceived. A picture of the face might reproduce
its features very accurately, but not get the expression right; it might, however,

260
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
be right as far as the expression goes and not hit the features off well. “Similar
expression” takes faces together in a quite different way from “similar anatomy.”
[RPP I §§1066–1068]
Wittgensteinmakesacrucialdistinctionwhenheaskshowhecanobservethechild’sfearof
touchingthedog.Iswhatheseesherethesameaswhenhesees“movingshapesandcolors,”
that is, un-interpreted perceptions of physical phenomena? No, it is not. If behavior was just
“moving shapes and colors” then, as he commented before, a camera could perceive this
kind of behavior. But, clearly, we could not photograph the child’s fear of touching the dog.
What the observer sees is not the anatomical movements of the child’s face and body, he
sees a fearful child. Fear is not comprised of a ﬁxed set of bodily movements for the simple
reason that these bodily movements can be feigned by an individual who is not afraid at
all. But even in the case where someone is actually afraid, their fear can be manifested
behaviorally in a unlimited variety of ways. It is possible that we could see fear manifested
in a way that we had never seen before, and still know that this new manifestation is
fear. How would we know this? Well, we see a person caught in circumstances where
a reasonable individual with his background should be afraid. The behavior of fear is a
very complex form of life consisting of bodily movements, performed by individuals with
certain kinds of experience or training, in particular circumstances, and which often have
“further practical consequences.” How does our presumption of experience or training
in the observed individual help us to understand his behavior? Suppose that we are in
a crowded coffee shop and we observe someone moving his hands in quick, distinctive
movements. Are his movements just nervous twitches? Is he going through some exercise
for physical therapy? Or, is he “talking” with American Sign Language for the Deaf?
Clearly, if we know that he is recovering from a severe hand injury, or that he is deaf, or
that he is neither of these, then we can make some reasonable assessments of what his hand
motions are (or, are not) likely to mean. The interpretation of behavior requires not only
present, immediate perceptions, but sometimes also a knowledge of the kind of relevant
training or experience that the person being observed might have undergone.
For Wittgenstein, a “similar expression” does not mean a “similar anatomy.” This means
that “expression” and “anatomy” are only loosely coupled, and not causally. The desire
to express a particular feeling might be a reason why someone makes certain facial
movements, but it is not a cause. So here is another difference between behaviorism and
Wittgenstein: behaviorism seeks to establish the causes for observable behavior, while
Wittgenstein believes that there are no causes for behavior—there are only reasons for
acting in particular ways.
It’s helpful to see behavior as a kind of language. Traditionally, language had been seen
as the representation of thought—that is, we have thoughts and then translate them into
written or spoken language. Wittgenstein conﬂated thought and language by showing
that instead of language representing or being a product of thought, language is often
the means by which we think (“language is itself the vehicle of thought” [PI §329]). A
similar relation exists between behavior and feeling. Traditionally, behavior was thought
to represent feeling—that is, we have feelings and then translate them into certain speciﬁc
behavior. Wittgenstein conﬂated this duality, too, by insisting that behavior is part of
the feeling itself. We don’t have feelings and then translate them into behavior, or have

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
261
feelings that cause behavior, we have expressive behavior—behavior that is part of the
feeling process. Now we can see why different behaviors can go along with the same
feeling: it is analogous to the fact that different words can have the same “meaning.”
Like language, behavior can be unpredictable and creative, and in the same way that we
can understand a sentence we have never seen or heard before, we can often understand
behavior we have never seen before.
Wittgenstein vs. Behaviorism: Reductionism
Most versions of behaviorism are characterized by some form of reductionism, for exam-
ple, mental phenomena being reduced to observable behavior or behavior being reduced
to physical movements. But Wittgenstein’s later work is strongly anti-reductive:
Our craving for generality has another main source: our preoccupation with the
method of science. I mean the method of reducing the explanation of natural phe-
nomena to the smallest possible of primitive natural laws. . . This tendency is the real
source of metaphysics, and leads the philosopher into complete darkness. I want to
say here that it can never be our job to reduce anything to anything. . . [BB p.18]
Any reductive system is implicitly dualistic, so in denying reductive analysis in philosophy,
Wittgenstein is also denying the dualisms on which it is based.
Wittgenstein vs. Behaviorism: The Existence of Mental Phenomena
Another difference which Wittgenstein has with behaviorism is with metaphysical behav-
iorism’s belief that mental processes or events are, as Watson put it, “superstition and
magic.” While Wittgenstein directed our attention away from mental processes and to-
wards those human life forms that we all could observe or experience, he was quite clear
that he was not denying the existence of mental phenomena. This is evident from one of
his longest and most important discussions about behavior:
“But you will surely admit that there is a difference between pain-behavior ac-
companied by pain and pain-behavior without any pain?”—Admit it? What greater
difference could there be?—“And yet you again and again reach the conclusion
that the sensation itself is a nothing.”—Not at all. It is not a something, but not a
nothing either! The conclusion was only that a nothing would serve just as well as a
something about which nothing could be said. We have only rejected the grammar
which tries to force itself on us here.
The paradox disappears only if we make a radical break with the idea that language
always functions in one way, always serves the same purpose: to convey thoughts—
which may be about houses, pains, good and evil, or anything else you please.
“But you surely cannot deny that, for example, in remembering, an inner process
takes place.”—What gives the impression that we want to deny anything? When one
says “Still, an inner process does take place here”—one wants to go on: “After all,
youseeit.”Anditisthisinnerprocessthatonemeansbytheword“remembering.”—
The impression that we wanted to deny something arises from our setting our faces
against the picture of the ’inner process’. What we deny is that the picture of the
inner process gives us the correct idea of the use of the word “to remember.” We

262
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
say that this picture with its ramiﬁcations stands in the way of our seeing the use
of the word as it is.
Why should I deny that there is a mental process? But “There has just taken place in
me the mental process of remembering. . . ” means nothing more than: “I have just
remembered. . . ” To deny the mental process would mean to deny the remembering:
to deny that anyone ever remembers anything.
“Are you not really a behaviorist in disguise? Aren’t you at bottom really saying
that everything except human behavior is ﬁction?”—If I do speak of ﬁction, then
it is a grammatical ﬁction.
How does the philosophical problem about mental processes and states and about
behaviorism arise?—The ﬁrst step is the one that altogether escapes notice. We
talk of processes and states and leave their nature undecided. Sometime perhaps
we shall know more about them—we think. But that is just what commits us to a
particular way of looking at the matter. For we have a deﬁnite concept of what it
means to learn to know a process better (The decisive movement in the conjuring
trick has been made, and it was the very one that we thought quite innocent.).—And
now the analogy which was to make us understand our thoughts falls to pieces. So
we have to deny the yet uncomprehended process in the yet unexplored medium.
And now it looks as if we had denied mental processes. And naturally we don’t
want to deny them.
What is your aim in philosophy?—To shew[sic] the ﬂy the way out of the ﬂy-bottle.
[PI §§304–309]
These are important, but difﬁcult passages, and deserve some commentary: In paragraph
one, Wittgenstein begins with a clear statement about the “. . . difference between pain-
behavior accompanied by pain and pain-behavior without any pain.” If there is a difference,
as Wittgenstein admits there is, then there must be some “inner” mental component of these
two identical behaviors that distinguishes them. Having said that, Wittgenstein makes one
of his most cryptic remarks about the mental component of pain: “[the sensation] is not
a something, but not a nothing either!” Wittgenstein has seemingly placed his conception
of sensation in the previously “excluded middle” between “something” and “nothing.”
Wittgenstein is making a very subtle, but important point: pain sensation is neither an
object nor a “thing,” in the way that we ordinarily conceive a thing to be. But it cannot be
“nothing” either, otherwise there would be no difference between the behaviors of feeling
pain and feigning it. What gives us the idea that there is no “middle ground” between
“something” and “nothing?” The grammar of these two words does it—it forces itself on
us. Since we know that we have sensations—that they exist—the sense of the “excluded
middle” forces us to think that since a sensation is not “nothing” it must be “some thing”
or “some mental phenomenon.” What’s wrong with this? Well, by treating a sensation as a
“thing” we fall into that unproductive disease of thinking whereby we think “sensations”
are objects that can be found and examined in the same way that a geologist examines
rock samples. This leads us to think of “sensations” as one thing, or one kind of thing.
This, in turn, can lead us to look for the “location” of sensations in the brain—if they
are “things” then they must be located somewhere. If the neurologist sees a difference
between the CAT scans of a person who is in pain and someone who is merely feigning

pain, this “object-language” of sensations may encourage him to interpret the difference
in the CAT scans as an actual physiological representation of the thing we know as “pain.”
The neurologist’s mistake is not an empirical mistake, it is, as Wittgenstein insists, a
grammatical one. Our language has forced us to interpret our milieu in a particular, biased
way. What are “sensations,” really? Wittgenstein gives us no answer, here. He simply
resists the grammatical temptation to declare them either “objects” or “nothing”—“It is
not a something, but not a nothing either!” [supra]
This simple referential language, as we described above, should sound familiar. It is the
language of Augustine (see the section “Wittgenstein at Work: Philosophical Investiga-
tions,” supra). For Augustine, language works in only one way, and words are names
for “things”—here, the “things” are “thoughts” or “sensations.”347 The “paradox” that
Wittgenstein refers to in the quotation we are considering is, of course, that “pain” is
neither a “something” nor a “nothing.” The paradox is resolved by the realization of two
things: ﬁrst, language does not work in just one way; and, second, even though there are
instances where language can best be described as consisting of names which refer to
things/objects, the words “pain” and “sensation” do not fall within the language-game of
simple reference. Freed from this grammatical straight-jacket, we can withold our judg-
ment of what sensations are, pending further analysis, which, of course, could be either
a grammatical or an empirical analysis. To reiterate, the important point is that whether a
sensation is a “something” or a “nothing” is not an empirical distinction, but a grammatical
one. If we think that it is an empirical distinction then we are forced to choose between two
alternatives: if we believe a sensation is a “something” then we are lead down the same
fruitless path as the neurologist with his CAT scans; but if we believe that a sensation is a
“nothing” then we are forced into the dead end of metaphysical behaviorism which denies
the very existence of mental phenomena.
In the third paragraph, supra, the Augustinian view of language—that words name
objects—rears its head again in a more insidious form. Wittgenstein is asked whether
or not he denies that “. . . in remembering, an inner process takes place.” Here, Augus-
tine’s simple referential language takes the form of designating a “thing” called an “inner
process.” Wittgenstein, at one and the same time, admits that there is an “inner process”
that occurs when we remember, but denies that what we refer to as an “inner process” is a
“thing” of any kind. The danger of giving “something” a precise name, is that, if we are not
careful, the naming process can reify what is named as a kind of “object.” Having given
these mental phenomena names, the empiricist/psychologist will design his experiments
to “discover” these “things”—the “inner processes.” We should not be surprised when he
ﬁnds them. But what he ﬁnds ﬁts a grammatical form, not an empirical one.
If the problem we have is grammatical, as Wittgenstein insists, then the solution must
involve some grammatical change. In the next paragraph, Wittgenstein shows us how:
“But ’There has just taken place in me the mental process of remembering. . . ’ means
nothing more than: ’I have just remembered. . . ’.” We need to adopt a non-referential
language, here. If we say a “mental process of remembering” took place, we are committed
347Words need to stand for “thoughts” rather than just “things/objects” in order to allow words to refer to things
that do not currently exist; for example, unicorns, Millard Fillmore, water-proof teabags, etc.

264
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
to identifying remembering with “some-thing.” But if we just say, “I remembered. . . ” then
we do not fall into this grammatical trap. We can now apply this method to other referential
statements: “I have a pain” becomes, “I’m hurting”; “I have an idea what to do” becomes,
“I know what to do.” If we recall the discussion in footnote 262 about “mental maps,” we
can see some of the same kind of grammatical disease of thinking taking place. A “mental
map” is, as we pointed out, a metaphor that has been taken too literally; and when we take
it literally, we are then committed to the Augustinean language of simple reference again.
This leads to such spurious inferences as, “Most animals have a rudimentary mental map
of the world encoded in nerve tissue. . . ” If we say that animals “have” a mental map, then
it is easy to infer that there must be a “something” that equates with the “mental map.”
But when we do not ﬁnd the “mental map” in any obvious “place,” it is easy to fall into
the trap of locating it in the place where we can’t easily look, the “nerve tissue.” That is, if
we “have” a “mental map,” it must be located somewhere. Again, this is not an empirical
imperative, but a grammatical one.
Is Wittgenstein saying that we should get rid of all such references in our language? No,
he is not, for the simple reason that we can “make sense” using these references—people
understand me when I say that I “have a pain” or “have an idea.” This is a language
game that is perfectly legitimate for me to engage in. Wittgenstein’s admonishment is
for epistemologists and psychologists, or anyone else investigating cognition. These are
the people who must avoid the “ bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.”
[PI §109]
Wittgenstein then asks the obvious question (of himself):
“Are you not really a behaviorist in disguise? Aren’t you at bottom really saying
that everything except human behavior is ﬁction?”—If I do speak of ﬁction, then
it is a grammatical ﬁction. (supra)
Since Wittgenstein says that sensations are “not a something” it looks like we have no
“thing” linked to our behavior. All we have left that is anything is behavior itself, hence,
Wittgenstein must be a behaviorist, though he seems to deny it. But what Wittgenstein
denies is not the mental phenomena, but the “particular way of looking at the matter”
that is forced on us by our grammar. This particular way of looking at the matter is to
see behavior somehow “linked” to mental processes and states, as names are “linked” to
objects in Augustine’s view of language. How does this happen? Wittgenstein tells us:
How does the philosophical problem about mental processes and states and about
behaviorism arise?—The ﬁrst step is the one that altogether escapes notice. We
talk of processes and states and leave their nature undecided. Sometime perhaps
we shall know more about them—we think. But that is just what commits us to a
particular way of looking at the matter. . . (The decisive movement in the conjuring
trick has been made, and it was the very one that we thought quite innocent.) (supra)
The “decisive movement in the conjuring trick,” in Wittgenstein’s wonderful metaphor, is
the naming of these mental processes and states. Naming them accomplishes two things:
ﬁrst, it separates them and treats them as independent objects, and, second, the name
gives the process or state a deceptive familiarity—don’t we really know what “fear” is, or

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
265
“enthusiasm?” So we are committed to treating these mental processes as objects which
we are basically familiar with. This familiarity keeps us from looking too deeply into
what these processes and states are, or, more importantly, whether they exist at all in
the independent manner that their names, that is, their grammatical usage, suggest. If we
combine this naming and reiﬁcation of mental phenomena with a penchant for seeing
the physical and the mental as separate, then it is easy to see how the grammar of these
statements gets us into this particular “disease of thinking.” All of this is a “grammatical
ﬁction” because it has no real empirical basis—it is simply a way that we talk about these
things that has forced us into a “particular way of looking at the matter”(supra).
Wittgenstein vs. Behaviorism: Intersubjective Knowledge
Methodological behaviorism rejects the consideration of mental phenomena, not because
they don’t exist, but because they are not directly accessible to more than one individual.
Wittgenstein, as we already discussed, did not believe that our thoughts and feelings were
entirely inaccessible to others (this is discussed in the section “Wittgenstein and Crime:
The Breakdown of the Distinction Between Inner and Outer Processes.”):
My thoughts are not hidden from him, but are just as open to him in a different way
than they are to me. [LWPP II p. 34]
Wittgenstein vs. Behaviorism: Logical Behaviorism
Wittgenstein’s philosophy, albeit his early philosophy, comes closest to the logical
behaviorism—termed “physicalism”—of Carnap. In spite of the fact that Wittgenstein
accused Carnap of plagiarism in developing physicalism Wittgenstein has clear theoretical
differences with him. In particular, Carnap built his theory on a foundation of method-
ological solipsism which holds that the primary source of our knowledge is ﬁrst-person
experience. Our knowledge of other’s feelings or thoughts is inferential in character: for
example, “He is in pain” is known by inferring that he behaves the same way that I do
when I am in pain. There are a number of problems with this self-referential learning.
In the ﬁrst place, not only is it difﬁcult to observe ourselves and make the appropriate
inferences, but often we’re not even aware that our own behavior can be a reference for
determining the behavior of others. Wittgenstein comments:
If someone imitates grief for himself in his study, he will indeed readily be conscious
of the tensions on his face. But really grieve, or follow a sorrowful action in a ﬁlm,
and ask yourself if you were conscious of your face. [RPP I §925]348
The answer, of course, is that we are not conscious of our own face when we try to interpret
another’s facial expressions. This is easy to see if we ask ourselves how we determine the
meaning of a puzzling expression in another person. If our own face were a reference
point, then we might ﬁnd a mirror, look into it, and try to make the same expression that
puzzles us in the other individual. Having made the expression in question in a mirror,
though, it is unclear what we would do next. The relation between the expression and a
348This is very similar to Z §503: If someone acts grief in the study, he will indeed readily become aware of the
tensions in his face. But be really sad, or follow a sorrowful action in a ﬁlm, and ask yourself if you were aware
of your face.

266
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
feeling or thought is not causal, as we have shown, so there is no obvious thought or feeling
that would be linked to it and uncovered by this process—one can have a smile on one’s
face for a lot of different reasons, even when one is in unhappy circumstances. It is clear,
though, that we often see puzzling expressions in the faces of others and are somehow
able to ﬁgure out what they mean. How do we do this? The most direct method is to ask
the other person why he made such an expression; but if we can’t do that, the next most
obvious method is to try to determine what circumstances he is in. Personal knowledge
will certainly play a role here, but it is knowledge of shared activites—forms of life—that
tell us what the other person is going through, not his physiognomy. This would give us the
context and circumstances in which the expression would “make sense.” Any expression
taken out of the context in which it occurred can be ambiguous. Consequently, facial
expressions are usually secondary to circumstances and activities when an interpretation
must be made. Wittgenstein continues:
“Putting the cart before the horse” may be said of an explanation like the following:
we tend someone else because by analogy with our own case we believe that he
is experiencing pain too.—Instead of saying: Get to know a new aspect from this
special chapter of human behavior—from this use of language.
...
Being sure that someone is in pain, doubting whether he is, and so on, are so
many natural, instinctive, kinds of behavior towards other human beings, and our
language is merely an auxiliary to, and further extension of, this relation. Our
language-game is an extension of primitive behavior. (For our language-game is
behavior.) (Instinct).349
We may need to learn to recognize when people are in pain, and we may make inferences
during this learning process. Further, there may be instances where we have to ﬁgure out
whether someone is in pain or not. But in the ordinary cases, once we have learned to
recognize pain in others, what we see is not a set of behaviors from which we infer that
so-and-so is in pain—we see a person in pain. Wittgenstein comments:
We do not see facial contortions and make inferences from them (like a doctor
framing a diagnosis) to joy, grief, boredom. We describe a face immediately as
sad, radiant, bored, even when we are unable to give any other description of the
features.—Grief, one would like to say, is personiﬁed in the face.
This belongs to the concept of emotion. [Z §225]
There is also a problem with the process of inference. The relation between behavior and
a feeling (e.g., pain) is, as we pointed out, not causal—lots of different behaviors can
indicate pain. We can see an entirely new manifestation of pain behavior and still know
that it is pain we are looking at. More importantly, we can’t always make a clear inference
to our own behavior because the person we are looking at may exhibit pain behavior
that is very different from our own. If the relation between behavior and feeling is not
causal, then any inferences necessary to determine what a given behavior means are much
349Z §§542–545, resp. In the section “The Foundation of Language in Instinctive Behavior” we discussed how
language can be a form of expressive behavior that can reﬁne and extend nonlinguistic behavior.

Part II: Wittgenstein’s Philosophyof Language and Mind
267
more problematic and certainly defeasible. As a consequence, Carnap’s attempt to base
understanding of behavior on personal, inferential knowledge, is tenuous at best. Carnap
wentevensofarastoclaimthatourknowledgeofourselvesis,likeourknowledgeofothers,
inferential in nature. The sentence “I am now excited” is supported by such assertions as
“I feel my hands trembling,” “I see my hands trembling,” “I hear my voice quavering,”
etc.350 In effect, we determine how we feel by marshalling evidence for it. Wittgenstein
would not agree with this proposal. If we need to gather evidence to determine whether we
are “excited,” then it implies that there will be cases where we will surmise we are excited,
since it is supported by sufﬁcient evidence, and cases where we may think we are excited
but do not ﬁnd sufﬁcient evidence to support this. In short, we could be wrong about how
we feel. Once again, the grammar of our language highlights the problem: We can say, “I
know he is excited, but I could be wrong.” But we cannot say, “I know I am excited, but I
could be wrong.” For Wittgenstein, the declaration “I am excited” is not a statement about
what we have found out through some sort of investigation. It is not knowledge because
being mistaken is implicit in the act of knowing. The statement “I am excited” in not a
statement of knowledge, it is an avowal. In other words, it is not a statement about my
behavior, it is an expression of my behavior. My statement “I am excited” is a substitute
for, or extension of, my pain-behavior:351
The truth is: it makes sense to say about other people that they doubt whether I am
in pain; but not to say it about myself. [PI §246]
Why Wittgenstein is not a Behaviorist: A Summary
It is fairly clear that Wittgenstein is not a behaviorist in any sense of the term. While his
early work in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus has some prima facie similarities with
Carnap’s logical behaviorism, careful reading indicates that Wittgenstein harbors some
decisive differences with even Carnap’s work. As Wittgenstein’s philosophy moved into
its later phase where he looked at language, behavior and psychology more deeply, only
a superﬁcial reading would give one the idea that Wittgenstein was a behaviorist of any
form. His major differences with behaviorism can be summarized as follows:
1. Wittgenstein held that “behavior” was not the simple aggregation of bodily move-
ments that many behaviorists believed it to be. Wittgenstein’s concept of “behavior”
included not just physical movements but also the context and circumstances which
surround them, and the training and experience of the individuals involved. These
are the sorts of things which you would have to put in a play to legitimate an actor’s
portraying such behavior. Much behavior is embedded in, and derives meaning
from, forms of life—the common day-to-day activities that comprise “what we
do.”
2. Some forms of behaviorism utilize an explicit reduction of mental phenomena to
physiological or behavioral phenomena. Wittgenstein rejects all forms of reduction
in this kind of analysis. Reduction purports to apply the scientiﬁc method to

1959. Edited by A.J. Ayer.

268
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
psychology. But, according to Wittgenstein, the scientiﬁc method is out of place
here—it is the wrong language game to be using in psychology or epistemology.
One of the aims of philosophy is to clarify our statements. This doesn’t require
reduction, but is best served by descriptions of “perspicuous representations” of
usage.
3. Wittgensteinbelievedintheexistenceandimportanceofmentalphenomena,which
metaphysical behaviorism does not. Methodological behaviorism, on the other
hand, accepts the existence of mental phenomena, but it did not believe that they
should be used in analysis since they were not accessible intersubjectively.
4. But Wittgenstein believed that we can often know what others are thinking or
feeling, even if they do not tell us, and sometimes even when they try to hide their
thoughts and feelings from us.
5. For logical behaviorism, our knowledge of others is based on our personal ex-
perience and is inferential in nature. Wittgenstein did not agree that this kind of
knowledge is inferential, but, in many cases, was directly accessible (e.g., we do
not see certain behavior and infer that someone is afraid, we see someone who is
afraid).
6. Logical behaviorism held that self-knowledge is inferential in nature too—that I
observe certain aspects about myself, that my hands are trembling, for example,
and infer that I am nervous. Wittgenstein held that statements like “I am nervous”
are not expressions of knowledge inferred from observations of ourselves, but are
avowals—these expressions are not about behavior, but are a form of behavior
themselves.

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The general features of Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language could be summarized as
follows:
i. “Meanings” are not linked to words.
ii. “Meanings” are not concepts or any other single thing.
iii. To understand the meaning of a word is not to have some deﬁnition in your head,
but to be able to use the word correctly in the activities and practices (Wittgen-
stein’s “Forms of Life”) in which it is normally used, and to know how to use it
(Wittgenstein’s “Language Games”).
iv. Meaning emerges from or becomes evident through use. “. . . we don’t start
from certain words, but from certain occasions or activities” [LC p.3].—“Let the
use of words teach you their meaning.” [PI p. 220]
v. While examining the use of language is important for understanding meaning,
Wittgenstein is clear that not just any usage is relevant. He felt that mean-
ing in language was conveyed most clearly by what he called a “perspicuous
representation” (“¨ubersichtliche Darstellung”).
“A main source of our failure to understand is that we do not command a clear
view of the use of our words.—Our grammar is lacking in this sort of perspicuity.
A perspicuous representation produces just that understanding which consists in
“seeing connexions” [sic]. Hence the importance of ﬁnding and inventing inter-
mediate cases.
“The concept of a perspicuous representation is of fundamental signiﬁcance for
us. It earmarks the form of account we give, the way we look at things.” [PI §122]
vi. Context is important for understanding language. We often understand the
situation in which language is used before we understand the words used. Meaning,
in part, is an external notion—what we have in our heads, our ideas, are neither
necessary nor sufﬁcient for determining what we mean: context and circumstances
are often essential determinants of meaning.
vii. Indeterminacy in language is not the result of sloppy or irrational usage.
Language meaning reﬂects the complexity of usage, that is, the wide variety of
circumstances and activities in which it can be used, and the same word may have
different meanings in different circumstances or activities. “If a pattern of life
is the basis for the use of a word then the word must contain some amount of
indeﬁniteness. The pattern of life, after all, is not one of exact regularity” [LWPP
I §211]. Most of the troublesome indeterminacy in meaning arises, as Wittgenstein
put it, “when language goes on holiday. . . ” [PI §38]. This occurs primarily when
language is taken out of its normal circumstances and patterns of usage. The
269

270
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
apparent lack of precision in meaning is not something that can be “cured” by
better deﬁnitions of words or by creating a more “rational” ideal language to
replace our present language. Ambiguity in meaning is mitigated by looking at
how the words in question are actually used.
viii. We make a variety of assumptions about the intentions of those with whom we talk.
In particular, unless given evidence to the contrary, we assume that the individuals
with whom we talk will cooperate with us and follow Grice’s maxims (Although
Grice developed his theories of language many years after Wittgenstein’s death,
since they were based on the interaction between speakers, i.e., on context and
circumstances, Wittgenstein would have probably agreed with them.).
Support for Wittgenstein’s Philosophy of Mind:
Robotics and “Scaffolding”
Where is the Mind?
As compelling as Wittgenstein’s arguments are for his theories of language and cognition,
it is reasonable to ask whether there is any more recent work that support his conclusions.
There is. Wittgenstein is quite clear in his related assertions that “meaning” is not a mental
entity or activity,352 that thinking does not take place exclusively in the head,353 and that
the conscious thoughts or other “psychological phenomena” we have do not correspond to
parallelbrainprocesses.354.Wittgensteinleavesuswiththesetantalizingassertionswithout
speciﬁcally telling us why he believes them to be the case. Although the careful reader can
get a sense of why Wittgenstein believed these claims to be true, Wittgenstein nowhere
gives us a concise argument for their support (see the section “Language and Cognition”
in Part I of this manuscript for a justiﬁcation of Wittgenstein’s position). Fortunately, there
is now growing support for these assertions coming out of recent work in robotics and
neuroscience. Andy Clark’s book Being There355 gives us a clear sense of this movement
352“And nothing is more wrong-headed than calling meaning a mental activity! Unless, that is, one is setting out
to produce confusion.” [PI §693]
353“It makes as little sense to ascribe experiences, wishes, thoughts, beliefs, to a brain as to a mushroom.”
[N. Malcolm. Nothing is Hidden: Wittgenstein’s Criticism of His Early Thought, p. 186. Basil Blackwell,
Oxford, 1986.]
354“No supposition seems to me more natural than that there is no process in the brain correlated with associating
or with thinking; so that it would be impossible to read off thought-processes from brain-processes.
...
It is thus perfectly possible that certain psychological phenomena cannot be investigated physiologically, because
physiologically nothing corresponds to them.
...
The prejudice in favour of psychophysical parallelism is a fruit of primitive interpretations of our concepts. For
if one allows a causality between psychological phenomena which is not mediated physiologically, one thinks
one is making profession that there exists a soul side by side with the body, a ghostly soul-nature.” [Z selected

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
271
away from psychophysical parallelism, and offers a more complex view of the “mind”
than the simple traditional notion of the mind being “in the head.”
To ask the question “Where is the mind?” or even just to use the word “mind” is to
commit oneself implicitly to the existence of something called a “mind.” In Part I we
saw how Wittgenstein warned us that a similar “disease of thinking” occurs when we ask
“What is the meaning of a word?”—by using the word “meaning” we give meaning an
implicit, independent existence, and the form of the question is seductively similar to more
straightforward questions like “What is the height of Mount Ranier?” This grammatical
parallel encourages us to assume that there is the same concise, determinate answer to the
question about “meaning” as there is to the question about the height of Mount Ranier.
A similar situation occurs with the use of the word “mind.” When we ask “where is the
mind?” we expect the same kind of answer that we would get with the parallel question
“Where is the pineal gland?”
The Mind: “Who’s in Charge Here?”
One aspect of cognition that Clark takes up that Wittgenstein does not explicitly address,
is the notion of the mind as being a “central controller” or “central planner.” Yet the idea
of a central planner is implicit in the idea of cognition being epistemically based and a
product of a single entity—the mind. When Wittgenstein insists that we don’t “think. . . in
our heads” he is, I suggest, adopting a view that is consistent with Clark’s rejection of the
“central planner.” Wittgenstein’s objection to the purely cognitive foundation of behavior
is clear when he states:
There is a kind of general disease of thinking which always looks for (and ﬁnds)
what would be called a mental state from which all our acts spring as from a
reservoir.356 [BB p. 143]
Clark rejects both the need for a central planner and the cognitive foundation of behav-
ior. The principal reason for this, Clark asserts, is that the central planner represents a
prohibitively inefﬁcient way for us to manage what we do. Interestingly, the evidence to
support this view comes largely from work in robotics:
The New Robotics revolution rejects a fundamental part of the classical image of
mind. It rejects the image of a central planner that is privy to all the informa-
tion available anywhere in the system and dedicated to the discovery of possible
behavioral sequences that will satisfy particular goals. The trouble with the cen-
tral planner is that it is profoundly impractical. It introduces what Rodney Brooks
aptly termed a “representational bottleneck” blocking fast, real time response. The
reason is that the incoming sensory information must be converted into a single
symbolic code so that such a planner can deal with it. And the planners’ output
will itself have to be converted from its proprietary code into the various formats
356This does not say, of course, that none of our actions is the result of a mental state, only that our actions are
not necessarily the result of a mental state.

272
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
needed to control various types of motor response. These steps of translation are
time-consuming and expensive.357
One of the ways that Clark bolsters his claim that there is no central planner to control
our behavior or motor skills is to offer the suggestive analogy of how more observable
complex behavior may be carried out in ways that do not require a central planner, either:
Complex phenomena exhibit a great deal of self-organization. Bird ﬂocks do not, in
fact, follow a leader bird. Instead, each bird follows a few simple rules that make its
behavior depend on the behavior of its nearest few neighbors. The ﬂocking pattern
emerges from the mass of these local interactions—it is not orchestrated by a leader,
or by any general plan represented in the heads of individual birds.358
Sometimes the overall pattern of behavior of the group emerges from the reactions of
individuals to small changes in their local environment. Clark calls this “stigmergy.” He
gives an example of termites building a nest in which individual termites respond to the
placement of mud balls by other termites and place their own mud ball in a position relative
to the others. Through the repetition of this process by thousands of termites a complex
nest of many arches, cells, chambers, and tunnels is created. The important point is that no
single termite has an overall plan for the nest, nor does the overall plan exist in any other
form. Yet by means of these basic stigmergic actions a nest can be built that is beyond the
planning capability of any individual termite.359
Scaffolding
Much seems to be ﬁxed, and it is removed from the trafﬁc. It is so to speak shunted
onto an unused siding.
Now it gives our way of looking at things, and our researches, their form. Perhaps
it was once disputed. But perhaps, for unthinkable ages, it has belonged to the
scaffolding of our thoughts. (Every human being has parents.) [OC §§210–211]
Some human activities are stigmergic in nature, though Clark makes it clear that true stig-
mergy is quite inﬂexible since it mandates a speciﬁc response to each triggering condition.
People have more ﬂexibility in their responses to triggering events than insects do, but
more importantly, they can intentionally alter their environment in ways that will elicit the
kinds of responses that they want to get. Clark calls this process “scaffolding.” Scaffolding
provides external augmentation for intelligent activity that permits us to achieve outcomes
that would be difﬁcult or beyond the capability of a single, unassisted individual. This ex-
ternal assistance can be physical (e.g., a hammer, a truck, a boat), cognitive (e.g., reference

books, methods of estimation, rules of thumb, explicit procedures) or social (e.g., creating
guilds of craftsmen to establish professional standards, building professional societies
to facilitate the dissemination of professional information, and to monitor professional
conduct, or, gathering individuals together to collaborate in the solution of a complex
problem).360 It is this ability to alter our immediate environment to augment our abilities
and stimulate speciﬁc actions that gives us the capability to perform exceptionally com-
plex tasks: from building a house, to constructing a dam, to designing the equipment that
can take astronauts to the moon, and return them safely to the earth. Scaffolding occurs
even on a simple level when we make subtle changes in our environment to, for example,
help us remember things: we can put an overdue library book on the driver’s seat of our
car so that when we get into the car next we will see the book and be reminded to return
it. Or, we can leave notes to ourselves stuck to prominent places, like the refrigerator, to
remind us of things we need to do.
Some of the most interesting scaffolding is that which we do in order to enable several
individuals to work together to perform a complex task that would be difﬁcult or impossible
for a single person to perform. An exceptionally rich and detailed example of this kind of
deliberate scaffolding is described in Hutchins’ Cognition in the Wild361 where the author
describes a long and detailed study of the complex process of navigation on a Navy ship.
This is an interesting example because it involves the collaboration of several individuals,
each of whom brings a different kind of expertise to the activity, and it requires a kind of
precision and low fault tolerance that puts signiﬁcant pressure on the individuals involved
to work together and get all the procedures right.
Scaffolding and the Rational Model of Choice
The choices that are available to us are dictated by the scaffolding that surrounds and
permeates what we do. We are not, Clark points out, fully rational agents with a com-
prehensive set of preferences and complete or perfect information about the situations
in which we act. Our rationality, as Simon362 described, is “bounded”: we make choices
based on the alternatives available to us and the amount of information we are capable of
considering in the process of choosing.
But Clark’s notion of scaffolding is even more radical than Simon’s “bounded rationality.”
Simon’s model is an adjustment, albeit an ingenious one, of the rational model, but, as
such, it is still anchored in the model of rational choice. The model of rational choice
360Clark traces the roots of the idea of scaffolding back to the Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky [Thought and
Language. MIT Press, Cambridge, 1986. Translation of the 1962 edition]. As Clark describes it: “Vygotsky
stressed the way in which experience with external structures (including linguistic ones, such a words and
sentences. . . ) might alter and inform an individual’s intrinsic modes of processing and understanding” [Clark,
op.cit., p. 45]. The more general notion of “. . . mind as inextricably interwoven with body, world and action”
[op.cit., p. xvii] has its antecedents in the works of Martin Heidegger [Being and Time. Harper and Row,
1961. Translation of 1927 edition. ] and M. Merleau-Ponty [The Structure of Behavior. Beacon Press, 1963.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
dictates that choices can be made entirely by conscious deliberation. That is, we can make
the best choices by considering available information and thinking about how it inﬂuences
the alternatives that we have—rational choice becomes the exercise of rules on data. These
data are mostly “facts” about the decision situation, but can also include such values as
preferences, utilities, expected monetary values, etc. All of these can be represented in
some context-free, objective manner. The rational model claims that all decisions can be
represented this way, and in the stronger versions of the rational model, it is held that this
is the way that the mind actually makes decisions, even when it is operating unconsciously.
Hubert Dreyfus363 wrote persuasively decades ago about the inadequacy of the purely
rational model of choice or mind. But there is growing evidence that we don’t make our
choices following anything like the purely rational model, except in a few very limited
kinds of decision-making. Nor is it possible to represent all the factors that inﬂuence
our choices as “facts,” “data” or “preferences” of some kind. Even the “transitivity of
choice”—one of the central assumptions of the rational model of choice, has proved to be
unreliable.364 One of the most concerted attempts to make the rational model of choice
work has been Lenat’s “CYC Project,” a decades-long, multi-million dollar attempt to
enable a computer to have the commonsense understanding of a child. CYC attempts
to do this by creating an enormous storage of “facts” and some methods of using these
facts to understand ordinary human situations. CYC aims to make use of many of the
commonsense things that we all know, but never explicitly mention. Things like, if you
go into a restaurant, you are probably hungry, or if something large is between you and
the place that you want to go, you will have to go around it to get there. The underlying
idea behind CYC is that having commonsense is just a matter of having lots and lots of
explicit facts about us, our common circumstances and activities.
Clark considers the CYC project and concludes that the rational model of intelligence
that it represents is “absolutely, fundamentally, and fatally ﬂawed.”365 For Clark, much of
our knowledge comes not from lists of explicit facts and rules, but from our active in-
volved dealings with the world. Our minds are not objective, independent rational choice
calculators, but are pattern completers “embedded” in our daily activities—as Wittgen-
stein put it, in the “bustle” and “hurly-burly” of “what [we] do.”366 This, of course, is
a viewpoint championed by Dreyfus 3 decades ago, and echoed in the pre-Artiﬁcial In-
telligence philosophies of Wittgenstein, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty.367 This kind of

of Artiﬁcial Intelligence’s claims that we could model how the mind works with rules and facts. Dreyfus’ critique
is still relevant today, and his book is now in its 3rd edition (Ironically, this edition was published by MIT Press,
the publisher and the institution which adopted the early model of rationality that Artiﬁcial Intelligence defended
so vigorously and Dreyfus criticized so sharply).

by means of disembodied symbol manipulation and have likewise insisted on the impor-
tance of situated reasoning (that is, reasoning by embodied beings acting in a real physical
environment).” [Op.cit., p. 4]

intuitive, involved knowledge that resists explicit description comes out nicely in Mark
Twain’s description of his training as a 19th century Mississippi riverboat pilot. Twain
describes a critical event in his education as recounted in his semi-autobiographical Life
on the Mississippi. [In this passage, the pilot has just ordered Twain, the apprentice pilot,
to steer the boat over what Twain thinks is a deadly reef which will sink the boat]:
[Twain] [we] made a straight break for the reef. As it disappeared under our bows
I held my breath: but we slid over it like oil.
[Pilot] “Now don’t you see the difference? It wasn’t anything but a wind reef. The
wind does that.”
[Twain] “So I see. But it is exactly like a [real] reef. How am I ever going to tell
them apart?”
[Pilot] “I can’t tell you. It is an instinct. By and by you will just naturally know one
from the other, but you never will be able to explain why or how you know them
apart.”
[Twain] It turned out to be true. The face of the water, in time, became a wonderful
book—a book that was a dead language to the uneducated passenger, but which
told its mind to me without reserve, delivering its most cherished secrets as clearly
as if it uttered them with a voice. And it was not a book to be read once and thrown
aside, for it had a new story to tell every day.368
What we have for minds are not rational, objective calculators, but, in Clark’s words,
“embodied minds”—minds that are not bounded by the skull, but are intimately coupled
with bodies which are actively situated in the world and are participating in activities
and practices. Much of the information that we garner from our environment cannot be
represented formally at all, and can, in some sense, only be felt by active participants in the
world. This interplay between the rational part of our mind and its inseparable embodied,
feeling part is easy to see in Clark’s example of solving a jigsaw puzzle. When we work
on a jigsaw puzzle, it would probably be impossible to put the right pieces together by
just thinking about which pieces might ﬁt, without actually trying to ﬁt them together. By
thinking, we can estimate which pieces are good candidates for ﬁtting together, but we
can’t really tell which ones go together without actually trying to ﬁt them together. The
decisiveness of the “snap” of two pieces going perfectly together is not possible to have
by a purely rational attempt to ﬁt them together.
Another aspect of scaffolding that may be important is the physiological effect it may
have on the brains of those who use it, especially the brains of youngsters. In Part I of
this manuscript, Merlin Donald pointed out that the young brain is highly plastic and
“can grow connections, and lose connections, in many different ways, depending on early
experience.”369 The “shared patterns of acquired behavior” that we engage in can literally

“restructure the mind.” In this sense, scaffolding can have a self-reinforcing aspect to it,
the more it is used, the more necessary it becomes to the behavior it augments, especially
for younger individuals. There is already some preliminary evidence of how dependent
we have become on the scaffolding of personal computers and PDA’s (Personal Digital
Assistants). Consider the following news article:
“Computer-mad generation has a memory crash”
by Cherry Norton and Adam Nathan
The New York Times [February 4, 2001]:
GROWING numbers of people in their twenties and thirties are suffering from se-
verememorylossbecauseofincreasingrelianceoncomputertechnology,according
to new research.
Sufferers complain they are unable to recall names, written words or appointments,
and in some cases have had to give up their jobs.
Doctors are blaming computer technology, electronic organisers and automatic car
navigation systems. They claim these gadgets lead to diminished use of the brain
to work out problems and inﬂict “information overload” that makes it difﬁcult to
distinguish between important and unimportant facts.
Scaffolding and Computerized Information Systems
Scaffolding is clearly one of the important things that computerized information systems
can provide. Ideally, computers are designed to augment individual information searching
and retention capabilities. They allow us to store increasingly large amounts of information
of all kinds—data, text, images, audio, hypertext, and compound documents, etc. They
also enable us to search through information at remarkable physical speeds.
The Boundaries of the Mind
In the section “Language and Cognition: What do We Have in Our Heads, and What is
it Good for?” in Part I, we discussed how we not only frequently use implements in our
surroundings to help us think, but in some situations these implements may be the sine
qua non of thought. Wittgenstein mentions passingly about thinking with “pencil and
paper” and Malcolm develops this example more carefully.370 The upshot is that many of
370Clark also uses the example of mathematical calculation in his discussion of how we can extend the capability
of the mind with “pen and paper”:
Most of us. . . can learn to know at a glance the answers to simple multiplications, such
as 7 × 7 = 49. . . But longer multiplications present a different kind of problem. Asked to
multiply 7222 × 9422, most of us resort to pen and paper (or a calculator). What we achieve,
using pen and paper, is a reduction of the complex problem to a sequence of simpler problems
beginning with 2 × 2. We use the external medium (paper) to store the results of these simple

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
277
us simply cannot do basic arithmetic calculations without paper and pencil, and few of us
can do complex calculations without being able to write them down. If we take away the
paper and pencil, we simply cannot do the calculations—we cannot think. And calculations
are not the only kinds of mental activity that require some kind of essential augmentation.
We cannot compose a scholarly paper of any length, without actually writing it down,
reviewing it, revising it, and adding related quotations from books, articles or personal
notes. All of these materials are not just supplemental to the process of writing but are
essential to it, they are part of the “scaffolding” of scholarly work. Neither I, nor any of
my colleagues, can compose a paper, much less a book such as this one, without writing it
down, and without reading and looking up a lot of related material in established sources.
It is not enough to have the idea or insight, one must be able to look at it and revise
it—visions often need revisions. This usually requires us to record it in some way, thereby
increasing the accuracy and longevity of our “memory.” Thomas Edison’s observation that
inventions are “1% inspiration and 99% perspiration” is just as applicable to writers as it
is to inventors.
Thisbringsusbacktothequestionswhat,andwhereisthemind?ItisclearthatWittgenstein
and Clark do not believe the mind to be exclusively in the head, nor do they believe that
its capabilities are limited to what we can think. As Clark put it:
Much of what we commonly identify as our mental capacities may likewise, I
suspect, turn out to be properties of the wider, environmentally extended systems
of which human brains are just one (important) part.371
Wittgenstein said that we can think with pen and paper, accepting the notion of scaffolding,
in principle. So, where is the mind? For Wittgenstein, talking about mind and body is to
commit one self to a dichotomy that is more of a grammatical distinction than an empirical
one. Wittgenstein’s solution to the perils of the “mind/body” distinction is simply to not
make the distinction. Philosophers are confronted with the problematic nature of the
dichotomy between brain and mind forgetting that they made the original distinction to
begin with. For Wittgenstein the solution is not to ﬁnd some way of putting mind and body
back together again, but of not breaking them apart in the ﬁrst place. This is easy to do
if we avoid the overly abstract view of language and restrict our study of language and
its relation to thought to ordinary usage—to examine language in the Language Games
and Forms of Life in which it ﬁnds its home. The issue of the mind/body dualism simply
doesn’t come up if we look at ordinary usage. To accept the mind/body dualism is to
be caught between Scylla and Charybdis: one is forced to choose between two equally
problematic alternatives: either the mind is the brain—the materialist’s solution—or the
mind is the immaterial “inhabitant” of the body, the “ghost in the machine” as Ryle aptly
called it—the idealist’s solution. But, Wittgenstein’s “solution” is that what perceives,
problems, and by an interrelated series of simple pattern completions coupled with external
storage we ﬁnally arrive at a solution. Rummelhart et al. comment: “This is real symbol pro-
cessing and, we are beginning to think, the primary symbol processing that we are able to do.
Indeed, on this view, the external environment becomes a key extension to our mind.” [op.cit.,
pp. 60–61]
371Clark, op.cit., p. 214.

278
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
thinks, or acts is not a “mind” or a “brain” but a living human being who is caught up
in the “bustle” and “hurly-burly” of everyday life and interactions with others. This is
the foundation for the analysis of intelligent activity, not neurons and synapses. This is
Wittgenstein’s solution to the mind/body dualism. Clark appears to agree:
. . . we must recognize the brain for what it is. Ours are not the brains of disembodied
spirits conveniently glued into ambulant, corporeal shells of ﬂesh and blood. Rather,
they are essentially the brains of embodied agents capable of creating and exploiting
structure in the world.372
Scaffolding and the Role of Language
For Clark, language has a major role in scaffolding. Language gives us a means by which
we can dramatically reduce the complexity of intelligent activity. It does this in a number
of ways. First, language can give us notational systems such as those used by formal
mathematics and logic which permit us to say fairly complex things very concisely and
to draw conclusions and make comparisons that would be difﬁcult to do without them.
Languagealsogivesusthemeansbywhichtoconstructspecializedlanguageslikethosefor
biology and physics. In more mundane tasks we use language to make lists and schedules,
and to exchange messages which simplify planning and collaboration. One of the most
obvious ways in which we simplify our intellectual tasks is to ofﬂoad much of our memory
into diaries, notebooks, memos, and other recording media, many of which are now in
electronic format which adds further capabilities to these recordings (e.g., text which is in
electronic format is easier to store, transmit, and copy than paper versions of it would be).
One of the most common uses of language is as a label or sign. These deceptively simple
artifacts are of great use for reducing the complexity our immediate environment, and can
be made to correlate with other media such as maps or diagrams. Labels and signs are so
commonplace that we quite literally could not get along without them—the computational
complexity of our tasks would be far too difﬁcult. It is no wonder that one of the ﬁrst things
that resistance ﬁghters often do when their country is invaded is to take down or change
all the road signs ahead of the advancing enemy.
The closest afﬁnity that Clark has with Wittgenstein comes when he considers the relation
between language and thought:
. . . we use words to focus, clarify, transform, ofﬂoad, and control our own think-
ings. Thus understood, language is not the mere imperfect mirror of our intuitive
knowledge. Rather, it is part and parcel of the mechanism of reason itself.373
As Wittgenstein put it, “When I think in language, there aren’t “meanings” going through
my mind in addition to the verbal expressions: the language is itself the vehicle of thought.”

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
279
Mental Models
One of the more interesting parallels between Clark and Wittgenstein is with the utility
of mental models. Wittgenstein, as we showed in Part I, was not an advocate of mental
models when the models are taken to be detailed representations of aspects of reality that
we are concerned with, and these models are a requirement for our understanding of, and
interaction with, these aspects of reality [See, “The Mind and Reality: Mental Models
or Scribbled Jottings?” in Part I for a more detailed discussion of this.]. As an example,
Wittgenstein considers our ability to ﬁnd our way across a large city. Just because we can
ﬁnd our way across the city does not mean that we have some kind of detailed cognitive
representation of the city, a “mental map,” that we can look at like a real map. What
we have is the ability to ﬁnd our way across the city. This ability, according to Clark is
not contingent on our having a detailed mental model of the city but of our ability to
use our experience of being in the city to complete partially remembered patterns. This
is why we often can’t remember our way around the city without actually being in the
city, and why we can only remember a complex route across a city as we travel it (see
Part I).374 Like Wittgenstein, Clark is skeptical about the utility of detailed mental models
to mediate intelligent activity such as ﬁnding our way across the city. Creating and using
mental models to mediate complex intelligent activity, according to Clark, would put an
intolerable cognitive burden on our ability to do things. In the example of the city, we
would not only have the effort of constructing a detailed, three-dimensional mental model
of the city, we would also have to continually update it to reﬂect changes in reality—trafﬁc
jams, road construction, detours, or how the lighting at different times of day makes visual
landmarks look different. What is the solution? If we can’t use complex mental models
efﬁciently, then what do we use? As I stated in Part I, we don’t need a mental model of
the city because we have the city itself “out there”—it is part of the world we live in, feel
comfortable in, and ﬁnd familiar. We can avoid the creation and maintenance of complex
three-dimensional mental models because, “The world is its own best representation.”375
If we refer to the world itself instead of a detailed mental model of the world, then we
don’t have to keep a model of the world in mind, we don’t have to constantly refer to
it, and we don’t have to continually update the model as we use it.376 If we don’t have
detailed mental models of the reality we interact with, then what do we have? Churchland,
374This criticism of detailed mental models has its origin in Wittgenstein’s more general claim that what we
“have in mind” are not mental entities that we can examine the way we might examine objects in reality.
What we “have in mind” are more or less detailed mental jottings which we can complete with our situated
experiences.
375Clark, op.cit., p. 46. Clark identiﬁes this phrase as the “moboticists’ slogan.” This is clearly a rejection of
Searle’s “Brain in a vat” model of cognition: “The brain is all we have for the purpose of representing the world to
ourselves and everything we can use must be inside the brain.” If the “world is its own best representation” then
“everything” we need to represent the world to ourselves is not in the brain. (See the section “Psycho-physical
Parallelism” in Part I)
376There is another problem with detailed mental models. Speciﬁcally, even if we saw that we had a detailed
mental model that appeared when we performed some complex mental activity, such as ﬁnding our way across
a large city, there is no evidence that such a mental model is what guides us in our actions or understanding.
The mental model that we have may only be epiphenomenal, that is it may simply accompany our understanding
rather than be the cause of it.

280
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
et al., in their cleverly-named paper, “A Critique of Pure Vision”377 hypothesize that we
maintain only sequences of “partial representations” or “visual semi-worlds” which we use
in conjunction with our perception of the reality that surrounds us, to provide a complete
and detailed model of reality. We update such a model by continually taking glimpses of
reality to ﬁll out parts of the model that we don’t have or that need to be updated.
In spite of the parallels between Clark’s and Wittgenstein’s thought on mental models,
there are some important differences too. Clark does not completely reject the use of men-
tal models to assist intelligent activity. He believes that the “New Roboticists’ rejection of
all internal models, maps, and representations”378 is too extreme. Clark dismisses the use
of detailed mental models on purely computational grounds—to “avoid excessive world
modeling.”379 If “excessive world modeling” is bad, and the “partial representations” of
Churchland, et al., are OK, then simple mental models of simple situations should be OK,
too. But for Wittgenstein, the rejection of mental models is a complete rejection, whether
the models are simple or complex is of no consequence.380 Clark’s willingness to keep
some form of mental model as a prerequisite for understanding, even when complex forms
of these models seem to be clearly wrong, indicates that he is still sympathetic with the use
of mental models to mediate intelligent activity. But if we don’t need detailed mental mod-
els to mediate complex tasks, then why do we need them to mediate simple ones? Clark’s
rejection of complex mental models is based on computational grounds, yet by hypothe-
sizing that simple kinds of mental modeling are OK while complex kinds are not, Clark
removes one source of complexity but introduces another source of complexity into this
process. Speciﬁcally, by asserting that there are two ways of mediating intelligent activity,
one for simple models and one for complex, Clark puts us in a position where we must
have some way of determining which method, the complete model for simple situations,
or the partial model for complex situations, is to be selected for each intelligent activity
in which we engage. The computational effort needed to determine when to apply the
complete detailed mental model or the partial mental model, is, obviously, an increase in
computation, not a reduction. Wittgenstein showed that there is no simple comprehensive
way to distinguish the simple from the complex, and that the distinction is usually context
dependent; that is, an entity could be simple in one context and composite or complex in
another.381 Furthermore, in the case of the partial model, we would also need to determine

379Clark, op.cit., p. 23.
380As stated in Part I, Wittgenstein’s rejection of mental models is not a claim that we have no mental repre-
sentations at all during intelligent activity, or that such representations are completely useless. His is merely a
rejection of the claim that such mental representations are required for intelligent activity.
381Wittgenstein:
But what are the simple constituent parts of which reality is composed?—What are the simple
constituent parts of a chair?—The bits of wood of which it is made? Or the molecules, or the
atoms?—“Simple” means: not composite. And here the point is: in what sense “composite?”
It makes no sense at all to speak absolutely of the “simple parts of a chair.”

exactly how the partial model is to be supplemented: in Churchland’s terms, which parts
of the model need glimpses of reality to supplement or update them, and which do not.
Boundary conditions can sometimes be extremely difﬁcult to determine, as the 2,400 year
debate over the “sorites” paradox attests.382 In short, if our aim is to reduce cognitive com-
plexity, as Clark insists, why would we have two ways of mediating intelligent activity
instead of just one way?383 Clark asserts that the mental component of intelligent activity
is to complete partially held mental patterns with information from our surroundings. It is
likely that instead of having complete or incomplete mental models, we have mental pat-
terns that all require some “ﬁlling out” with empirical information. Although Wittgenstein
did not speciﬁcally discuss “mental models,” since the phrase is of more recent origin, we
must look to his remarks on the use of mental images to mediate intelligent activity to
give us a sense of how he conceives of mental models. Wittgenstein states:
Images tell us nothing either right or wrong, about the external world. . . .
Images are subject to the will. . . .
It is just because forming images is a voluntary activity that it does not instruct us
about the external world. [Z §§621, 627]
For Wittgenstein, mental images are not entities that can be examined to tell us something
about the external world that we did not already know; consequently, they cannot usually be
used to store comprehensive objective information about our milieu, nor can we examine
them the way that we examine objects in our milieu such as the way we might look up
something in a book. Of course we do remember things as images, so how is it that
they do “not instruct us about the external world?” Wittgenstein is making a subtle point
here: the mental image can tell us something about the external world in the sense that
we can use our will to create the image in a certain way, and the way that we create
it may actually be faithful to the way that our external world is. But, and this is the
critical point, mental images are always “subject to the will” so any faithfulness that they
have to reality is because we have willed the appropriate image, not because there is any
objective, photographic-like recording of the external world. The willed-image, and the
way that we interpret it, just happened to represent faithfully the way reality was and it
component parts? Multi-colouredness is one kind of complexity; another is, for example, that
of a broken outline composed of straight bits. And a curve can be said to be composed of an
ascending and a descending segment.
If I tell someone without any further explanation: “What I see before me now is composite,” he
will have the right to ask: What do you mean by “composite?” For there are all sorts of things
that that can mean!”—The question “Is what you see composite?” makes good sense if it is
already established what kind of complexity—that is, which particular use of the word—is in
question. [PI §47]
See the extended discussion of the distinction between simple and complex, or composite, in Part I section
“Wittgenstein’s Categories: Family Resemblances.”
382See the section “The Analysis of Depth Grammar” in Part I.
383Clark actually violates his own “principle of parsimony” in which he asserts that we should know “only as
much as you need to know to get the job done.” Op.cit., p. 46. The “partial representations” that Clark likes have
the same problems that the “rough copies” I talk about in section “Psychophysical Parallelism” have.

282
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
can only represent what we will it to, so it cannot “instruct us about the external world”—
it cannot tell us anything that we did not know in the ﬁrst place. Even times when we
try to remember things in a faithful and objective manner, our memories are notoriously
unreliable. There are many examples where the image we remember was supposed to be
an objective representation, but turns out not to be—like the bystander who, as a witness
to an event that becomes the subject of litigation, tells the court what he thinks he saw,
but which turns out not to be the case. Psychologists have found that it is remarkably
easy to get people to believe in recollections that are known to be false, even in such a
rigorous context as courtroom testimony.384 Images do not mediate intelligent activity,
they accompany it. Mental images are not like maps which give us objective pictures of
reality, they are more like the illuminations of medieval manuscripts which don’t convey
information so much as represent text that is already understood. Likewise, the “mental
model” is not something that can be referred to as a map or a dictionary can be, it is a
kind of epiphenomenon that is an illustration of our understanding, not the source of the
understanding itself. If there is a role for mental images or models it may not be so much
to give us detailed information about our milieu, but to give us the senses of familiarity
and relevance which we need to feel when we go about our daily activities.
The reason that we can say that images or mental models are not necessary intermediaries
for intelligent activity is that for much of our intelligent activity we simply don’t have
them. We do have “something in mind” when we remember a familiar place because we
can often describe it or make a rough drawing of it. But just because an image comes to
mind when we think of a familiar place does not mean that the image is the source of our
understanding, it may only be a product of our understanding. Also, we can still have the
feeling of familiarity without being able to draw or recall the place, even vaguely. We have
all had the experience of coming to a place and seeing it as familiar, but before that occurs
having no recollection of the place at all. Quite literally, we may have had to be in the place
in question before we could sense its familiarity. Nothing in our minds alone could give
us this sense. Being there gives us perceptions which help to complete our recollections
of familiar places and circumstances.
Clark’s instincts about what is wrong with mental models are good, but he resists the
obvious conclusion to the points he raises—namely, if there is something wrong with
mental models there is something wrong with all mental models, not just some of them
(the “complex”ones). In this light, Wittgenstein would be more likely to sympathize with
those New Robotcists who reject all forms of “internal models, maps and representations,”
though, as we said, he does grant the usefulness of “scribbled jottings.” (See section “The
Mind and Reality: Mental Models or Scribbled Jottings?” in Part I)
Externalism and the Philosophy of Language
Recent work in the philosophy of language has shown the inﬂuence of the trend towards
“externalism” in the philosophy of mind.385 Traditionally, the philosophy of mind has been

283
almost exclusively “internalist”—that is, the workings of the mind, our thought processes,
have been seen as acting entirely within the physical boundaries of the brain and skull.
Internalism has been an implicit, but essential component of the mind:body dualism most
strongly associated with Descartes, and is still, in various forms, fundamental to many
current models of cognition. Externalism, on the other hand, does not place the boundaries
of cognition within the skull, but argues that there are many external facilities or processes
that are necessary for cognition. Wittgenstein, who can be said to have had externalist
leanings, gave the example of our using a pencil and paper when we perform calculations.
Many of us need such external implements for even simple calculations, but all of us
need them for complex calculations. If we do not have a paper and pencil handy, we,
quite literally, cannot think through a complex calculation—the pencil and paper become
a sine qua non for thought itself. Today, we have many such tools essential for thought:
computers, databases, graphical plotters, etc. None of us remembers everything he or she
needs to conduct his or her daily affairs. Books, databases and personal computers become
necessary extensions to our memory. Without these implements, we would not be able to
think the way we do.
The beginnings of externalism, as a distinct movement in the philosophy of mind, ﬁnds its
roots in Putnam’s “Twin Earth” thought experiment.386 Putnam asked us to imagine that
there was a “Twin Earth” that was exactly like our own earth, even to the point of having
a “twin” of every person on this earth. But there was one aspect of Twin Earth that was
different: on Twin Earth they had a substance they called “water” which was exactly like
our own water except that instead of having a chemical structure H2O it had a different
structure which Putnam called “XYZ.” Except for the different chemical structure, Twin
Earth water had exactly the same function there as it does here: Twin Earthers drank it,
washed in it, poured it on their plants, and used it in squirt guns for amusement. Twin
Earth “water” came out of the sky in the form of rain, and large amounts of it formed
rivers, lakes, and oceans, just like ours does. Since the Twin Earthers’ use of their “water”
was exactly like our own use of water, their conception of water, that is, their idea of
what it was and how it was used, was exactly the same as our own idea of what we called
“water.” In other words, what the average Twin Earther had “in his head” about water was
exactly the same as what we have in our heads about our version of water. Yet, Putnam
wrote, Twin Earth water was different from our water because it had a different chemical
structure (XYZ vs. H2O). The ineluctable conclusion of this thought experiment is that
semantic meaning is not entirely internal; at least part of the deﬁnition of what water is,
is external to our skulls because what we and the Twin Earthers have in our heads cannot
distinguish our water from Twin Earth water. As Putnam put it, “Cut the pie any way you
like, ‘meanings’ just ain’t in the head!” (op.cit., p.144). Tyler Burge387 published an article

include intentional mental states such as beliefs, desires, hopes, and fears. Burge called
the internalist interpretation that he and Putnam criticized, “individualism.”
Although the Twin Earth thought experiment is entirely fanciful, similar phenomena ac-
tually do occur every day. In most categories there is a level of generality where different
people will call different things by the same name—for example, what I call a “sparrow”
and another person calls a “sparrow” might actually be different species of birds, even
though they have the same behavior, general appearance and habitat, and they appear the
same to us mentally. Two women can have identical appearing necklaces and thereby have
the same mental conception of each’s jewelry. But while one necklace is made of precious
gems, the other is made of fake stones. Since each woman believes that her necklace is
made of precious stones, what each woman has “in her head” is identical. But their respec-
tive necklaces are, in reality, not the same. The Twin Earth thought experiment has had a
profound effect on philosophy over the last 3 decades. As Pessin and Goldberg observed,
“Twin Earth and ‘The Meaning of Meaning,’ the article in which it became famous, com-
prise perhaps the most inﬂuential single philosophical episode in the past half century.”388
Why is the “Mind” Important for Information Systems?
Information systems are used, of course, to ﬁnd information of various kinds: data, doc-
uments, images, audio recordings, websites, etc. But searchers typically don’t ﬁnd infor-
mation to just collect it, they ﬁnd it to use it for some purpose. Even the casual Internet
“surfer,” while seemingly engaged in idle, nonspeciﬁc retrieval, still has a purpose in his
or her searching, be it simple curiosity, or the escape from boredom. But the typical, pur-
poseful searcher who uses an information system is frequently looking for information
that he needs in order to begin or continue some task or activity.389 All but the smallest
information systems contain more information than the searcher could possibly commit
to his own memory, so in just the storage sense information systems are an augmentation
of the memories of searchers. But information systems augment the searcher’s cognitive
abilities in many other ways, too. The information that exists on an information system
is rarely haphazardly collected; it almost always represents a selection of some subset
of the available information by individuals who may be more knowledgeable about that
information than the searcher is. In this sense, the selection of information on the system
embodies the intelligence and discrimination of the individuals who designed the system,
and may reﬂect abilities and practices that extend more broadly than the information it-
self (such as, e.g., when practicing physicians have a part in selecting information to be
included in a system such as the medical document retrieval system Medline). This too, is
an augmentation of the cognitive capabilities of the searcher. Computerized information
systems also offer a number of tools that enable the searcher to do things that would
be impossibly time-consuming to do on a noncomputerized information system of any

typical size (things like sorting large amounts of retrieved information by its date, its au-
thor or its title, performing statistical procedures—sum, average, standard deviation—on
large collections of data, or searching through the text of information for speciﬁc names,
dates, words or phrases). These are only a few of the things an information system can
do to augment the cognitive abilities of a searcher, and by augmenting these abilities the
information system is helping the searcher, quite literally, to think. Thus, an information
system acts as a kind of scaffolding to supplement the searcher’s intellect, enabling him
to examine information, perform searches, and compare information that he would not
be able to do easily or at all by himself. The information system, then, represents a kind
of extension of the mind of the searcher, or at least a softening of its boundaries. Since
the scaffolding of the information system should assist the intellect of the searcher in
ways that are beneﬁcial, it is important that the designers of information systems should
know not only what the capabilities of technology are, but also what the capabilities of
the human mind are so they can decide how best to supplement or assist them in their
information searches. The mind of the searcher can extend, quite literally, into the infor-
mation system—it can become “embedded” in information technology in the same way
that it can become embedded in the implements of any practice. As Clark put it, “I am
convinced that it is valuable to (at times) treat cognitive processes as extending beyond
the narrow conﬁnes of skin and skull.”390 Thus, an understanding of the capabilities and
limits of the human mind is essential if we are to design information systems that extend
and supplement these capabilities and limits.
The Structure of Information Systems
At the highest level of abstraction, the level at which the searcher comes into contact with
it, an information system is fairly simple. Basically, an information system is an organized
process which attempts to provide correct or pertinent information in response to a formal
request of some kind. In the broadest sense, people are themselves information systems
since they often provide answers or recommendations to others who ask them questions.
But our concern here is with information systems which are artifacts designed to provide
answers or selected material in response to queries, or to be used by searchers to ﬁnd
relevant information. The following diagram depicts the basic structure and dynamics of
an information system:
The Inquirer generally begins the search process with a request of some kind. This can be
stated in natural language as a question—“What is Mary Sinico’s credit limit?” If we think
of the request as a question, we can distinguish between a number of basic kinds: what,
who, where, why, how, and when. These can all be reformulated as “What. . . ” questions:
what person, what place, what reason, what method, and what time. This request must
then be translated into a format that is appropriate for the information system being used.
This is the Formal Query. In its simplest form, a Request and a Formal Query might look
like this:
Request: “What is the credit limit for the customer Mary Sinico?”
390Clark, op.cit., p. 215.

286
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Formal Query (SQL): SELECT
Credit Limit
FROM
Customer
WHERE
Last Name = “Sinico”
AND
First Name = “Mary”;
In order for the Formal Query to select the right information or data there must be some
data or information for it to search through and it needs to be structured in a way to facilitate
retrieval. For data, like in our example, there are relatively well-understood procedures for
structuring it for retrieval: a process called “Normalization.”391 While normalization is not
391While Database modeling and design is, in most cases, a fairly routine process, this does not mean that it has
the precision of a mathematical procedure or that it is without uncertainties or competing viewpoints. Rather
than a rigid procedure, normalization is more like a set of heuristics that guides the design of record structures
but does not control it. Most data base design theories recommend normalization to third Normal Form, but some
recommend that fourth and ﬁfth Normal Forms should be implemented if multi-valued dependencies are present
in the data. Even in databases which are normalized, violations of the rules of normalization can be tolerated

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
287
without its uncertainties, it is still a fairly straightforward process compared to the design
of some more problematic collections of information which we will consider shortly.
In the above example, the database needs to be structured so that customer data is kept in a
table, or relation, called “Customer” and that this table has the data ﬁelds “Credit Limit,”
“Last Name,” and “First Name.” The job of the Information System is to ﬁnd the appro-
priate tables or relations in the database and to select the correct rows and ﬁelds that match
the Formal Query.
What I have described here is what I would call the basic “Data Model” of information
systems. Overall, this view of information or data has been enormously successful in
managing data over the last few decades, and it has affected our daily lives in signiﬁcant
ways: we can withdraw cash from our personal checking account using an ATM in a distant
city or even in another country; we can use a single credit card to handle virtually any
purchase of any kind in stores that are thousands of miles away from our home town; we
can buy a ticket in Chicago for a play at the Geary Theater in San Francisco so we can
attend during a future trip; we can reserve a campsite at any National Park in the US from
any telephone with access to 800-level phone numbers; etc. These activities would not be
possible without the capacity to ﬁnd and record precisely deﬁned data like names, account
numbers, phone numbers, etc.
The Fundamental Relationship in Information Systems
The Fundamental Relationship in any information system is the linking of an item or
items of information or data with some representation or description of that information.
In our example, above, the number representing Mary Sinico’s credit limit is given the
description “Credit Limit.” In semiotic terms, this is an indexical relation. For data, this
indexical relation looks like this:
Address
|
|
V
31 Emmett Avenue, Dedham, MA
5822 Jamestown Road, Hyattsville, MD
4413 Chase Avenue, Bethesda, MD
6227 Madawaska Road, Washington, D.C.
400 East Randolph, Chicago, IL.
...
and are sometimes even recommended—the most common complaint of normalization being that it breaks data
bases up into too many records, making it necessary for the data base users to join them back together again
to answer queries. Apart from normalization, there are other issues concerning the treatment of null values in
data bases, and, more recently, the handling of object-oriented features like inheritance, encapsulation and class
hierarchies. The more recent extension of the data base concept into Data Warehousing and Data Mining have
introduced new uncertainties and competing visions into the data design process.

288
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Here the word “Address” is an index of a set of data items. It allows us to refer to the address,
or addresses, in a meaningful and parsimonious way. It is parsimonious in the sense that
we have a single term “Address” to refer to an entire set of addresses on the information
system. The word “Address” also has a “sense” or “meaning” that we are all familiar with,
and helps us to understand what kind of data is in this set. Here we can see that indexes
do two things: ﬁrst, they distinguish a speciﬁc set of data as distinct from the other data in
the system, and, second, they describe this set of data in a way that makes it meaningful
for individuals who use the system.392
This basic indexical relation occurs repeatedly in information systems and is the basis
for the retrieval of information or data. It allows us to index, that is to distinguish and
describe, a wide variety of familiar data items:
“Phone Number”
“Name”
“Employer”
“Social Security Number”
“Date of Birth”
“Marital Status”
‘ “Job Title”
“Account Balance”
...
These index terms have a highly determinate relation between their common meaning
or usage and the information or data they can be used to represent. That is, in ordinary
usage, which Wittgenstein insisted is the touchstone of linguistic meaning, there is usually
very little ambiguity about what “phone numbers,” “names,” “dates of birth,” etc., are.
This kind of highly determinate relationship between indexes and information or data
is one of the major reasons for the success of the data model. We are able to precisely
describe a large percentage of the data we need to conduct our daily activities: we can
ask directions to a unique address, we can look up our checking account balance which
is referred to by our unique Social Security Number, we can order a book or CD with
a unique combination of title and author, and we can call a friend whose phone number
is, out of the millions of phone numbers in the world, unique. This kind of information
system, with highly determinate indexes we can refer to as the “Data Model.” As we said,
it is an enormously robust and successful model for information or data management.
But its very success has led to its widespread application to kinds of information that
cannot be indexed with the certainty of the above examples. Even more problematic, it is
the source of the belief that all information has, at least potentially, a highly determinate
representation that can be used to distinguish a small amount of useful information from
large amounts of similar information on an information system. But to insist that there is,
potentially, a highly determinate representation of any item of information is like insisting

can be found in D.C. Blair “Information Retrieval and the Philosophy of Language.” [Annual Review of
Information Science and Technology, vol. 37, pp. 3–50. Information Today, Medford, NJ, 2003.]

that there is a clear deﬁnition for each of the concepts we use. Wittgenstein considered this a
mistake:
We are unable clearly to circumscribe the concepts we use, not because we don’t
knowtheirrealdeﬁnition,butbecausethereisnoreal“deﬁnition”tothem.[BBp.25]
If we believe that every item of information has, potentially, a highly determinate repre-
sentation that would enable it to be retrieved by those who want it in any situation, then
many of the failures of information systems will be attributed to incorrect indexing—not
representing the information content correctly, or incorrect search query formulation—
not representing what the inquirer wants correctly. But, it is the thesis here, that in many
retrieval situations information does not, either actually or potentially, have a determi-
nate enough representation to distinguish it from the information a searcher does not
want.
The Fundamental Issue of Information Systems:
The “Determinacy of Representation”
There are indexes which are less determinate than the ones above and whose precise
meanings are correspondingly less certain. Even some highly determinate indexes may
have indeterminate aspects about them. For example, index descriptions such as “debit”
or “credit” on a bank statement indicate additions or subtractions from an account but
may not indicate what the nature of the credit or debit actually was. Of course, whether
such descriptions are considered determinate or indeterminate will depend on how that
information is being used. Sometimes the speciﬁc values for the data and the nature of
their use can lower the level of determinacy.393 For example, while the name “Alex Szabo”
appears only once in the Manhattan phonebook, and is thus quite determinate (i.e., it refers
to a single individual), the name “Robert Smith” occurs over 90 times in the same phone
book, and is correspondingly less determinate. It is less determinate not simply because it
repeats a lot, but because the typical use of a phone book is to look up unique individuals,
not groups of individuals with the same name. No matter how many Robert Smiths there
are in Manhattan, there is typically only one Robert Smith to whom we wish to talk.
Recalling Wittgenstein, the key to understanding a word, even something as simple as a
name, is to look at its use.
But there are other kinds of indexes which also have high levels of indeterminacy. The
most common of these are the indexes which represent certain aspects of textual infor-
mation like the “intellectual content” of documents. A given document does have some
determinate indexes such as the author’s name, the title, the date of publication, the title of
the journal or edited collection in which it occurred, etc. But it is far more uncertain how
to index or precisely describe the “intellectual content” of documents or books—what
they are about, or how they can be used—than it is to determine the correct name of the
author.
393I take the phrase “to lower determinacy” and “to raise indeterminacy” to be synonymous. Likewise, “to raise
determinacy” and “to lower indeterminacy” are synonymous.

290
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
We can see now that there are two basic kinds of information or data which can be
managed by an information system—highly determinate information which we can refer
to with precise indexes, and less determinate information which varies in its precision
of representation. This distinction we take as fundamental; it differentiates two different
kinds of information systems or retrieval situations. Originally,394 it was taken that data
managementsystemsprovidedaccesstohighlydeterminateinformation—phonenumbers,
account balances, order numbers—while document and image retrieval systems had much
less determinate representations of their stored information, particularly when looking
for documents with a speciﬁc “intellectual content” or images of a particular type or
subject. But, on further consideration, we can see that the distinction between highly
determinate and less determinate representations of information does not fall precisely
on the dividing line between data retrieval and document/image retrieval systems. There
can be indeterminate representations of data and highly determinate representations of
documents or images. Let’s look at our phonebook example in more detail: We would
usually consider the names in a phone book as a fairly determinate representation of the
phone numbers and addresses of individuals who live in a particular city. For most small to
modest sized towns names can often uniquely identify individuals, so it is not difﬁcult to
ﬁndthephonenumberof,say,MichaelR.Waltersinatownof40,000residents.Sometimes,
though, a name may be common enough even in a small town to provide multiple listings
for it. If there are four Michael Walters in one town, then your certainty, or probability,
of dialing the number of the speciﬁc Michael Walters whom you want is, ceteris paribus,
25%. While such indeterminacy may be irritating, we would only have to call at most four
numbers before reaching the Michael Walters whom we want. The situation for certain
names in large metropolitan areas—New York, Chicago, or Pittsburgh—may be a different
matter, though. A common name like Robert Smith, appears 114 times in the Pittsburgh
phone book. While we may be willing to dial four numbers to get the right Michael Walters
in a small town, we would probably not be willing to dial anywhere near 114 numbers to
ﬁnd the right Robert Smith in Pittsburgh (especially if we are using a pay phone!). But the
problem of even the most common name in an American phone directory is dwarfed by
the repetition of names in China. Although the Chinese culture is several millennia old,
there are only a few hundred family names to distinguish billions of individual Chinese.
In Shanghai alone, there are several thousand individuals with the same name. If all were
listed in a hypothetical Shanghai phone book, it would take many pages to list them. Such
a high level of indeterminacy would militate against the accurate retrieval of a speciﬁc
individual in Shanghai with that name.
Looking at the other side of the determinacy problem, we said that, in general, retrieving
documents or images can often be fairly indeterminate, in particular, when looking for a
speciﬁc intellectual content, or “subject.” But there are situations where even this is not
the case. Take the documents that go together to make a loan application at a bank: these
documents are stored under the applicant’s name. But because the uniqueness of these
documents is essential, banks usually include the applicant’s Social Security Number
(SSN) along with the other information. In such a case, the SSN would uniquely identify
394This distinction in information systems was originally called the “Data : Document Distinction.” [D.C. Blair.
“The Data-Document Distinction in Information Retrieval,” Communications of the ACM, vol. 27:4, pp. 369–
374, April 1984.]

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
291
any single set of application documents. The SSN can be used in the application process
because only bank employees or the applicant will need to have access to these records
and they both know which SSN corresponds with a particular name. But the manner in
which indeterminacy is resolved here—by the use of customer SSN’s—is not available
for resolving all cases of the indeterminacy of identity. For example, when there are a
large number of duplicate names in a telephone book, it would be possible to also list
everyone’s unique SSN along with his or her name, address, and phone number. But,
given the nature of the retrieval task, it is unlikely that this would prove useful. The reason
for this is that even close friends usually do not know each other’s SSNs so it would be of
little value for distinguishing individuals with the same names. Further, most individuals,
as an ordinary practice, would be reluctant to have their names and corresponding SSNs
published together in a public document, since that information could be used to get access
to personal information or to “steal identities.” In the case of the duplicate names in the
phone book there is usually another highly determinate item of information that would be
better than an SSN for distinguishing duplicate phone book entries: the address. While
there may be many Robert Smiths in the phone book, there may only be one on “Green
Court”oroneon“RandolphStreet,”forexample.Itisfarmorelikelythatafriendwillknow
the street you live on than your SSN, and that may be enough to resolve the indeterminacy
of even large numbers of duplicate names in a phone book. The discrimination power of
additional information is directly related to how determinate that information is. The fact
that it is more likely that a friend would know your address rather than your Social Security
Number is not arbitrary. It is a natural consequence of the ways that we normally interact
in our day-to-day activities. Friends often visit each other or write to each other, so they
often know each other’s addresses, if only the name of the city and street. There are no
common activities, though, in which two friends might need to know each other’s Social
Security Numbers. There are, in contrast, activities such as applying for a bank loan, where
Social Security Numbers are used regularly. The discrimination power of language, like
meaning, is ultimately contingent on the day-to-day activities (Wittgenstein’s Forms of
Life) and Language Games, in which it appears.
“Escalating Uncertainty of Retrieval”: The Problem With Large
Systems and Indeterminately Represented Information
One way to demonstrate the effects of the indeterminacy of representation in information
systems is to show how it could effect the conceptually simpler data model. Consider
the situation in which we want to know the ofﬁce phone of a co-worker we met brieﬂy
whose last name we believe to be “Smith.” If we have access to a relational database with
employee information in the “Employee Table” we might submit an SQL query of the
following type:
SELECT
Phone Number
FROM
Employee Table
WHERE
Last Name = “Smith”;
If this is a small company and there is only one “Smith” who is an employee, then this
query will retrieve the correct information. But, if the company is larger, there would

292
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
likely be more Smiths who work there and the above query would return a set of phone
numbers for all the Smiths. If there are just two or three Smiths, you might be willing to
call each of them to ﬁnd the Smith whom you want. But let’s assume that there are too
many Smiths to call up.395 In this case, you would need to use more information in the
query to distinguish the Smith whom you want. Suppose that you know that Smith is a
computer programmer and that job titles are included in the employee information on the
database. Here, you might extend your query in the following way:
SELECT
Phone Number
FROM
Employee Table
WHERE
Last Name = “Smith”
AND
Job Title = “Programmer”;
In some cases this would retrieve the phone number of a unique individual, and in some
cases it would not. In the latter case, it would be necessary to add more information, for
example, if we knew he was in the marketing department we might submit the query:
SELECT
Phone Number
FROM
Employee Table
WHERE
Last Name = “Smith”
AND
Job Title = “Programmer”
AND
Department = “Marketing”;
This is a common way to deal with retrieving speciﬁc information from a large information
system. One can increase the speciﬁcity of the query, that is, reduce the number of retrieved
items, by conjoining additional information with the original query. With each additional
item of information—here, the “Job Title” and then the “Department”—the number of
items satisfying each successive query usually decreases making the searcher’s efforts
easier.396 But this strategy for the reduction of retrieved set size only works with highly
determinate representations of the information on the database. If the representations are
less determinate then an interesting thing happens when we add information to the query—
with the addition of each item of information, even though the number of items retrieved
usually goes down, the certainty of retrieving the correct record also goes down—that is,
it is less certain that the retrieved records, no matter how few, will include the one the
searcher wants. For example, suppose that we are uncertain of the individual’s exact name.
We think it was “Smith” but it could have been something else, “Smythe” or “Schmit,”
395When too many records are retrieved we say that the size of the retrieved set is greater than the searcher’s
“futility point”—the point in a search when he gives up. A more detailed discussion of “futility points” and
the biases that it can introduce into the retrieval process can be found in Blair’s “Searching Biases in Large-
Scale Document Retrieval Systems.” Journal of the American Society for Information Science, pp. 271–277,
31 July 1980, or in the ﬁrst chapter of his Language and Representation in Information Retrieval [Elsevier
Science, 1990]. The phenomenon of excessively large retrieved sets is also referred to as “output overload” (Blair
and Maron, 1985) or “Infoglut.” [Rozak. The Cult of Information. Pantheon Books, New York, 1986.]
396The size of the retrieved set might remain the same from query to query, but it cannot not go up. For the
purposes of this discussion we will assume that the common result obtains and that additional information in
the query will reduce the number of retrieved items. It is also important to note that this reduction only occurs
when additional information is added conjunctively (using “AND” in the above SQL statements), and not when
it is added disjunctively (using “OR” instead of “AND”).

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
293
perhaps. We could represent this uncertainty probabilistically saying that we are 60%
certain that his name is, in fact, “Smith” (i.e., we estimate that there is a 60% likelihood
that the set of records corresponding to employees by the name of “Smith” will include
the record of the employee whom we want).397 Now, even if we only retrieve one or two
records with our ﬁrst query—ostensibly, a good result—it may be the case that neither of
them represents the individual we want. But, as in the previous example, let’s assume that
the ﬁrst query returns too many records. We could then add the additional information
about the individual we want, as we did before, that he is a “programmer.” Again, instead
of knowing this with certainty, consider our certainty of his being a programmer is 70%.
Even though our certainty of his being a “programmer” is higher than our certainty of
his name being “Smith,” the overall certainty of the individual we want being among
those employees who are represented as having both the name “Smith” and the job title
“programmer” is the product of the individual certainties, that is, .60 × .70, or 42%.398
If we add the information that he is likely to be in the “Marketing” department, with a
certainty of 80%, we wind up with a combined certainty of our third query (“Smith” and
“programmer” and “Marketing”) retrieving the individual we want as .60 × .70 × .80, or
.34. So, even though we are increasingly certain that each additional item of information
represents the individual we want, our combined certainty goes down with the addition
of each item of information until we have, here, only a 34% certainty that the retrieved
records, however few, include the individual whom we want.399
But notice what happens when we combine information that we are certain of, which is
usually the case in database management systems. If we are absolutely certain that the
individual whom we are looking for has the name “Smith,” a job title of “programmer”
and is employed by the “Marketing” department, then the combined certainty of these
descriptions is, assuming independence, the simple product of successive probabilities
397In reality, it may be very difﬁcult to estimate accurately a numerical value for our uncertainty about whether a
particular index represents the information we want. The numerical values here are hypothetical and are meant to
demonstrate the general nature of the retrieval difﬁculties rather than provide a precise estimation of the numeric
values which might occur.
398To make the combination of probabilities the simple product of the individual probabilities requires an
assumption of the independence of the two probabilities, namely, that the fact that someone’s name is “Smith” is
not related in any signiﬁcant way to the fact that he is a programmer. Such independence is not always the case
since we can imagine instances where there may be a signiﬁcant dependence between two facts; for example, it
may be the case that certain job titles, such as “salesman” are more likely to be found in one department, say,
“Marketing,” than another. Thus, “salesman” and “Marketing” are not independent. But the lack of independence
in some cases does not change the point we are making here. If the probabilities of the individual events are
not independent and are less than 1.0, which we assume they are here, then the resulting probability of the
combination of events still yields probability values that decrease as more events (additions of information)
are combined. It is this trend of decreasing certainty, or, as we ﬁrst termed it, “escalating uncertainty,” that is
important for our discussion, not the actual probability values themselves.
399The perceptive reader can see that a reasonable search strategy is to search using the terms with the highest
probabilities of success ﬁrst. In our example, it would probably be better to search with the terms “Smith” and
“Marketing” whose conjunctive probability is .48, before searching with “Smith” and “programmer” whose
conjunctive probability is .42. Of course, a higher probability is not an absolute indicator of search term utility
since there are words, like “the” or “a,” that are in every document or record and, although they have probabilities
of 1.0, they do not discriminate the useful documents from the useless ones at all. To select the retrieved set
that has the higher probability of returning the desired record, both retrieved sets need to be smaller than the
searcher’s “futility point.”

of 1.0. As long as we can add items of information to our query that are certain, the
resultant probabilities will not be subject to the “escalating uncertainty” that typiﬁes
the combination of indeterminate information. This is why the data model has been so
successful, even in large applications. It deals almost exclusively with certain information.
This is the most important difference in the comparative effect of determinate/certain and
indeterminate/uncertain information in large systems.400
The Nature of Representational Indeterminacy in Information Systems
Representational indeterminacy is one of the most signiﬁcant factors affecting the success
of a search for information, so it is important that we look at it more closely. When we
do, we see that there are different kinds of representational indeterminacy and a number
of factors that can make it better or worse.
1. Semantic ambiguity. Ambiguity about the meaning of a word is the most obvious
source of representational indeterminacy since we frequently deal with it conver-
sationally. Consider the word “head.” We might ﬁnd it used in the following kinds
of sentences:
“He put his hat on his head.”
“He went to the head of the line.”
“She’s the head of the Executive Board.”
“The crisis quickly came to a head.”
“They began the canoe trip at the head of the river.”
“He wuz headin’ North after he robbed the bank, sheriff!”
The word “head” can be used in any of the above examples, as well as others.
If we just look at the literal word by itself it could take on any of a number of
different meanings and be correspondingly indeterminate in what it represents.
We could imagine submitting the single word “head” to an Internet search engine
and retrieving web pages with the above sentences in them. An actual Internet
search with the word “head” is given below.
2. System size and category overload. The number of times a word is used to
represent, or index, information on an information system will affect the level of
indeterminacy of that word. If the word “head” occurs in only one document or is
used to represent a single item of information, then it is presumably being used in
just one way, and semantic indeterminacy is less of a problem. Certainly, it may
be unclear which of the many semantic meanings of “head” is being used to index
the information, but with a single occurrence it would be no great effort for the
400This problem of escalating uncertainty and its effect on the retrieval of documents was ﬁrst discussed in a paper
by Blair and Maron: “An Evaluation of Retrieval Effectiveness for a Full-Text Document Retrieval System.”
Communications of the ACM, vol. 28:3, pp. 289–299, March 1985. The ﬁrst publication to relate conditional
probabilities to document indexes was M.E. Maron and J.L. Kuhn’s “On Relevance, Probabilistic Indexing and
Information Retrieval,” Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery , vol. 7:3, pp. 216–244, July
1960.

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
295
searcher to retrieve the information and see whether it is the semantic usage that
he wants. But as the number of times a word is used to represent information goes
up, the uncertainty of its meaning increases, too. If “head” is used to index 1,000
items of information, then it is likely that its inherent semantic variability will
cause it to represent a variety of semantic content. One might ask how the mere
increase in the number of times a word is used causes an increase in the number of
different semantic ways it is used, that is, why couldn’t all 1,000 uses of “head” refer
to a single semantic sense? While this is a reasonable hypothesis, the statistical
properties of language militate against it. George Kingsley Zipf was the ﬁrst to
describe some of the basic statistical properties of natural language. Among these
statistical regularities of language, he found that there was a relationship between
the number of occurrences of a word in natural language text and the number
of different semantic ways in which it is used: if the number of occurrences of
a word in a sample of text is equal to n, then the number of different semantic
ways in which it is used is equal to the square root of n. In our example, if “head”
occurs 1,000 times as an index for information, then it is likely to be used around
30 different semantic ways. The “different meanings” of words are, admittedly,
not always precisely identiﬁable, so it is unclear how exact Zipf’s formulation of
the relationship between word frequency and meaning actually is, though he did
claim empirical evidence for the relationship.401 But a more general formulation
of this relationship which states that as a word increases in frequency of usage, the
number of different semantic ways it is used goes up too, but at a rate proportional
to the square root, is very likely to be the case.402 This explains one of the most
persistent frustrations of using search engines on the World Wide Web, namely,
that when a searcher uses an ordinary word in a search query, she not only will
usually retrieve a large number of websites having that word occurring in them,
but she will also see a wide semantic variability in the way that the word is used in
the retrieved websites. If we submit the word “head” to the Google Internet Search
Engine, we can ﬁnd the following variability in the ﬁrst 30 retrieved websites (out
of 21,300,000 selected websites!403):
i. HEAD-Document Head. Syntax, <HEAD>. . . <HEAD>. Attribute Speciﬁ-
cations.
ii. HEAD NEW MEDIA: ecommerce, interactive television, intranets. Head cre-
ates relationships which are true to marketing strategy.
401Zipf. Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort. Hafner Publishing, NY, 1965. (Facsimile of the
1949 edition)
402It may be the case that there is some upper bound to the number of semantic meanings that a word can possess,
and it is certainly the case that some words have more semantic meanings than others. But even if the maximum
number of meanings is no more than 50, for example, it still means that semantic indeterminacy can pose a
signiﬁcant problem with searching for intellectual content on a large information retrieval system.
403Of course, when the retrieved set of websites or documents rises beyond 20 or 30, it is unlikely that an inquirer
who is dissatisﬁed with these ﬁrst retrieved sites will continue to look beyond them. Thus the effective size of the
set of retrieved websites must be less than the inquirer’s “futility point”—which may be deﬁned as the maximum
number of items of information, here, websites, that he is willing to look through before he either gives up his
search, or, submits a different or revised query to the search engine.

We can see that there is a lot of semantic variability for the word “head” in the above
20 websites of the 21+ million identiﬁed for retrieval. Whether these represent the
ﬁrst 20 meanings of a possible 4,615 (the square root of 21,300,000) is difﬁcult
to tell, but it is clear that if we see this much variability in the ﬁrst 30 websites
retrieved, we will probably see a great deal more variability were we to examine
subsequent retrieved websites. In any event, since the typical web user would be
looking for a single usage of “head” the majority of the websites identiﬁed for
retrieval would not be useful to the inquirer.
3. The Productivity of Language. One of the salient characteristics of natural lan-
guage is its “productivity.” Language is productive in the sense that a relatively
small vocabulary and a few rules of syntax and semantics can combine to produce
an uncountabley large number of valid sentences or descriptions (this is the notion
of a “generative grammar”).404 The productivity of language has proved to be both
a help and a hindrance for information retrieval systems, as it has for any other
computerized system that has a large semantic component. Productivity is a help
because it is relatively simple to ﬁnd a reasonable way to represent the intellectual
404D.T. Langendoen and P. Postal. The Vastness of Natural Languages. Basil Blackwell, Oxford, UK, 1984.

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
297
content of any document; but this productivity can also be a hindrance because
language is so creative that the number of “reasonable” representations for a doc-
ument’s intellectual content is virtually unlimited. As a consequence, anticipating
how a searcher might ask for a particular document content can be very difﬁcult.405
Consider our example of the semantic variability of the word “head.” There are
two kinds of semantic variability here. First, as we have already shown, the word
“head” can have a variety of meanings. But there is another kind of semantic
variability, namely, that there is a wide variety of ways we can express the same
semantic content of the word “head” without using the word “head.” Consider our
examples:
Original Sentences
Alternative Sentences
“He put his hat on his head.”
“He put his hat on.”
“He went to the head of the line.”
“He went to the front of the line.”
“She’s the head of the

“The crisis quickly came to a head.”
“The crisis quickly became

at the source of the river.”
“He wuz headin’ North after he
“He wuz ridin’ North after he
robbed the bank, sheriff!”
robbed the bank, sheriff!”
4. The two sides of indeterminacy: The indexer and the inquirer. The examples
that we have given of semantic indeterminacy are on the index or document side
of the retrieval process. But semantic indeterminacy also affects the inquirer or
searching side of this process, too, thus multiplying the effect of indeterminacy and
lowering the likelihood of retrieving a useful item of information content.406 That
is, the word “head” as we have shown, has a large number of different semantic
uses, or meanings, which the authors of different websites may use. But, that same
variability can affect the inquirer, too: he has a lot of choices of words and phrases
that he can use instead of“head”—these are like the “Alternative Sentences” shown
above. So the person who must represent the intellectual content of a website must
not only make decisions about the speciﬁc words that he or she uses to express what
405Swanson demonstrated this effect empirically in his “Studies of Indexing Depth and Retrieval Effectiveness”
[Unpublished report, National Science Foundation Grant GN 380, February 1966]. The results of his unpublished
test are discussed in Blair Language and Representation in Information Retrieval, pp. 170–171. Elsevier
Science, 1990.

the Association for Computing Machinery, vol. 7:3, pp. 216–244, July 1960]. Maron later extended this work
in his writings on what he called the “Operational Deﬁnition of ’About’.” [“On Indexing, Retrieval and the
Meaning of About,” Journal of the American Society for Information Science, vol. 28:1, pp. 38–43, January
1977.

298
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
they want to express, they must give some thought to what words a typical searcher
who would be happy with the “content” of that website might use as search terms.
5. What do search terms do?—Description and discrimination. If we look more
closely at the way that words are used in the search for intellectual content—what
Wittgenstein might call the Language Game of searching—we can see that they
have two major functions. In the ﬁrst place, they must describe the intellectual
content of the material they serve as indexes for. In the data model this was fairly
straightforward: we usually call addresses by the word “address” and phone num-
bers by the words “phone number.” For documents or images this is, as we have
shown, a more indeterminate process, except for the limited contextual information
such as the author’s name and the title of the work. But while there may not be a
single, agreed-upon way to represent the intellectual content of text or images, the
goal of the indexing process is to describe that content in a way that will facilitate
retrieving it by interested inquirers.
If all information systems were small, that is, if all the possible retrieved sets
they might generate would be smaller than the futility point of even the most
demanding inquirer, then we would need only to be concerned with how index
terms describe the intellectual content of available items of information. But one
of the lessons of the Information Age is that as the costs of storage have decreased
dramatically, the sizes of information systems have gone up just as dramatically.
We have, quite literally, reached the point where no item of information, no matter
how trivial, need be thrown away. In fact, in many instances it may cost more to
examine items of information and decide whether to keep them than to simply
keep them and pay for their storage indeﬁnitely. As a consequence, the size of the
typical information system continues to grow. Index terms, then, must not only
describe the intellectual content of information, they must also discriminate the
intellectual content of a given item of information from the intellectual content of
other information on the same system that is similar to it. Description, then is a
process which is only concerned with a single item of information, while discrim-
ination is a process which must consider how a given item of information, such as
a document or an image, must be distinguished from other items of information
on the same system. In short, description deals with single items of information
while discrimination looks at how individual information items relate to the en-
tire information system. For example, in a small public library, if there are only
ten books on the subject of “Database Management Systems,” it might be ﬁne to
index them all with that phrase, since ten is most likely smaller than the futility
point of the typical inquirer. But in a computer science library at a major univer-
sity there might be hundreds of books that have an intellectual content concerned
in some way with “Database Management Systems” and there would be few in-
quirers with a futility point that reaches into the hundreds. As a result, it may be
important to subdivide the description “Database Management Systems.” Instead
of describing every intellectual content which has to do with database management
systems as “Database Management Systems” we might be able to discriminate,
for example, between different kinds of “Database Management Systems”: Hi-
erarchical, Network, CODASYL, Relational, Object-Oriented, or Distributed; or

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
299
we might distinguish different kinds of Database applications: Data Warehous-
ing, Data Marts, Data Mining, OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing); or, we
might distinguish different Database design issues: Normalization, Storage Struc-
tures, Physical Storage; Access Methods: Hashing Algorithms, Data Loading; or
we might distinguish between speciﬁc brands of Database Management Systems:
ORACLE, ACCESS, DB2, TOTAL, FILEMAKER PRO, INFORMIX, etc. Such
subdivisions will better discriminate between the intellectual content of the large
number of books on the general topic of “Database Management Systems.”
Description and discrimination also characterize the two major kinds of search fail-
ures. A failure of description occurs when either an index term does not accurately
describe the intellectual content of a given item of information, or when a search
term does not accurately describe the intellectual content of the information the
inquirer is looking for. The result of a failure of description is that the information
retrieved does not have the content the inquirer wanted. A failure of discrimination
can occur when a given index term correctly describes the intellectual content of an
item, but does not discriminate it well from the intellectual content of other items
of information on the same system. The result of a failure of discrimination is the
retrieval of exceptionally large sets of information—“output overload.” From this
we can see that the most troublesome search failure for Internet search engines is
a failure of discrimination—even the simplest search for intellectual content can
return a retrieved set of millions of websites. The traditional measures of document
retrieval effectiveness, recall, and precision, can be seen in terms of description
and discrimination: recall, the percentage of relevant documents that are retrieved,
can also be seen as a measure of the success of description, while precision, the
percentage of retrieved documents that are relevant, can be seen as a measure of
the success of discrimination.407
6. The requirements of use. Typically we search for information, not as an end in
itself, but as something we can use in an activity or practice. Thus, it is the activity
or practice that the search serves that sets the criteria for successful searching.
Likewise, the degree of indeterminacy that a representation can have is not just
a matter of the number of times that representation occurs, but is also a function
of what the information that is indexed by that representation will be used for.
For example, we described how there was a direct relation between the number of
occurrences of a person’s name in a phone book and the level of indeterminacy of
that name as an indicator of a particular individual. This is true, not just because
there are multiple occurrences of the name in the phonebook, but because the
primary use of the phone book is to look up the phone number of a single individual.
But we could imagine another, albeit unusual, use of a phone book. We could
imagine that someone, a genealogist for example, might have a quite different use
for a phone book. The genealogist might use it to determine how many individuals
with a particular surname live in a given city. In such a case, a name that occurs 50
times in the phone book might not be indeterminate at all, since the genealogist’s

and Technology, vol. 37, pp. 3–50. Information Today, Medford, NJ, 2003.

300
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
goal, unlike the typical phonebook user, might not be to ﬁnd a single individual,
but to tabulate all the occurrences of the name in question.
Looking at the requirements of use, we can say that there are, from a quantitative
point of view, a number of different kinds of searches: speciﬁc, exhaustive, and
sample.
Types of search:
Speciﬁc. The searcher wants to see a single speciﬁc item of information (only
one item of a category is desired, e.g., a telephone book lookup, or a patent
search where an inventor is looking for the existence of a speciﬁc patent.).
Exhaustive. The searcher wants to see all the items of information of a partic-
ular type or category (e.g., scientiﬁc research or litigation support).
Sample. The searcher wants to see some, but not all, of the items of information
in a particular category (e.g., a market researcher retrieving a few examples
of what consumers are saying about a particular new product).
7. Indirectness of Representation. As we described in 2 (above), indeterminacy
affects both the indexer and the inquirer, but there is one kind of indeterminacy
that is unique to the inquirer. Unlike the indexer, the inquirer’s search terms may not
be a precise description of the “content” that he or she wants. If the indexer is free
to use whatever terms he wants, then he can use whatever index terms best express
the content of the information as he sees it. The inquirer, on the other hand, does
not generally have this freedom of expression when using an information retrieval
system. The inquirer must select his search terms from the index terms which have
been used to represent the information content on the system. The inquirer’s search
terms are, in effect, not pure expressions of what he wants, but are hypotheses about
how the information content he wants is represented. This means that there are two
distinct stages of a content search: The First Stage is not so much a direct search for
content as it is a search for the best search terms for the inquirer to work with. This
is why Swanson has characterized content searching as inevitably a trial-and-error
process.408 In this kind of situation the inquirer may know what he wants, but can
only guess at how it’s represented on the information system he is using. But there
are other situations where the inquirer doesn’t even know exactly for what he is
looking—for example, a lawyer, in the defense or prosecution of a lawsuit might,
during the pre-trial “discovery” stage of the lawsuit, be looking for what could only
be generally described as some kind of “incriminating evidence”—a “smoking
gun”—which might be valuable in the conduct of the lawsuit. Here, the lawyer
doesn’t know speciﬁcally what she is looking for, but can only say that she will
recognize such incriminating evidence if and when she sees it. A similar situation
obtains with scholarly research, where the researcher may not know exactly what
408D.R. Swanson. “Information Retrieval as a Trial-and-Error Process,” Library Quarterly, vol. 47:2, pp. 128–
148, April 1977.

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
301
she is looking for, but, like the lawyer, will recognize what she is looking for when
she sees it. Here we should remember Wittgenstein’s admonition that “language
is a vehicle of thought” rather than a representation of thought—we use language
as a means by which we think. Likewise, the index terms available to the inquirer
represent the tools with which he can not only search, but, even more basically,
they represent the tools with which he can think about what information content he
wants. In so far as the index terms are limited in their utility for expressing what
the inquirer wants, they also pose constraints on how he can think about what he
wants.
Indeterminacy of Representation: This depends on several factors:
i. The number of tokens/occurrences of the representation in the category. For ex-
ample, the number of documents which are represented by a particular term, or
the number of websites linked to a particular term as a result of an Internet search.
ii. The uniqueness requirement. This is a requirement based on the particular needs
of the application the information is being used in. For example, in most cases
someone looking up “Michael Smith” wants one person, but someone doing a
demographic study may want to know how many “Smiths” are in New York city.
The difference here is between “Smith” when it denotes a particular individual and
“Smith” when it denotes a class of individuals: the ﬁrst is a semantic use of “Smith”
where it connotes a particular individual, but may not have enough information or
the right information for the searcher to discriminate the individual he wants from
the other “Smiths.” The second use of “Smith” is a use of it as an item of data.
Here, the name “Smith” gives us all the information we need. . . no supplementary
information is needed since we don’t need to distinguish individuals. The names
by themselves, even without addresses or phone numbers, would be sufﬁcient for
the task. In the second case, individual reference or discrimination doesn’t matter.
iii. The discrimination power of additional information. If we know “Michael Smith’s”
street address we might be able to pick him out from the other “Michael Smith’s
in a phone directory, even if there are a lot of them.” The ability to distinguish
the “Michael Smith” we want is dependent on the granularity of description, that
is, just knowing the borough of New York city where “Michael Smith” lives may
be all we need to identify the one we want, but in other situations we may need
the street name, and in others you may need the street address, too. The nature of the
representation may give you additional discrimination power, for example, since
the information you are dealing with consists of the names, addresses, and phone
numbers, we also have the option of calling and talking to several of the “Michael
Smiths” if we cannot otherwise distinguish the individual we want. We might
call this the “Cost of Discrimination,” which dictates the cost of indeterminate
searches. In some cases the “Cost of Discrimination” is low, but we can imagine
examplesforwhichthe“CostofDiscrimination”isintolerablyhigh,higherthanthe
inquirer’s “futility point,” such as when an Internet content search yields thousands,
or millions of websites [the name “Michael Smith” returns 766,000 websites when
used as a search phrase on the Google Internet search engine].

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Indeterminacy in Information Systems: An Empirical Study
The discussion of indeterminacy of representation so far has been largely conceptual,
with mostly hypothetical examples. It is only natural to ask whether there are any doc-
umented examples of information systems where the indeterminacy of representation
seriously affected the effectiveness of retrieval? There is. In 1985 the results of a study
were published409 that showed dramatically how the indeterminacy of natural language
militated against the precise retrieval of documents with a particular intellectual content.
The study examined, in detail, the retrieval effectiveness of a full-text document retrieval
system (IBM’s STAIRS—STorage And Information Retrieval System) used to support a
large corporate litigation, in which the defendant, an engineering construction company,
was defending its conduct in a large construction project.410 The system provided access
to 40,000 documents, about 350,000 pages of online text. Simple full-text document re-
trieval systems operate by having the inquirer formulate queries using words he believes
are contained in the documents he wants but are not contained in the documents he doesn’t
want—that is, the selected search terms must both describe the content the inquirer wants
as well as discriminate the desired documents from nonrelevant ones. The lawyers and par-
alegals using the retrieval system were actively working on the lawsuit and were intimately
familiar with the case, having worked on it for over a year prior to the test. They were
also quite speciﬁc in their insistence that they needed to retrieve a minimum of 75% of the
desired, or relevant, documents to conduct the defense of the lawsuit successfully. After
the lawyers and paralegals used 51 individual queries to retrieve what they considered to
be over 75% of the desired documents, the experimenters then tried to ﬁnd whether they
had missed any relevant documents. The results were striking: while the lawyers and par-
alegals were convinced that they were retrieving over 75% of the desired documents, they
were, in actuality, retrieving only 20%!411 The principal reason for such low success rates
in retrieval can be directly attributed to the indeterminacy of meaning in natural language.
Stated succinctly, it is impossibly difﬁcult for inquirers using a large full-text retrieval
system to predict, by means of their search queries, the exact words, word combinations,
and phrases that are used to express the content of the documents they desire but are not
used to express the content of the documents they do not desire. (Note: it is not enough
for the inquirer to simply predict the words that occur in the documents she wants—this
409D.C. Blair and M.E. Maron. “An Evaluation of Retrieval Effectiveness for a Full-Text Document Retrieval
System,” Communications of the ACM, vol. 28:3, pp. 289–299, March 1985. This experiment is discussed in
much more detail in chapter 3 of Blair’s Language and Representation in Information Retreival, Elsevier
Science (1990).
410The litigation which the retrieval system supported was the defense of a $257 million lawsuit brought by
the city of San Francisco against the contractors who built the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, for
their alleged failures to meet all the speciﬁcations of the contract and to manage the costs of the construction
effectively.
411The value of 20% for recall is a maximum value. The reason for this is simple. In order to search such a large
document collection effectively, the experimenters could not examine the relevance of every single document
for every query. They actually searched only small portions of the document collection looking for relevant
unretrieved documents. Consequently, the experimenters could not say with any assurance that they had found
all of the unretrieved relevant documents, they merely retrieved enough to make the point that many were missed
by the original searchers. If more unretrieved relevant documents were found, the average recall value would
have been less than 20%, perhaps signiﬁcantly less. (details of the experimental procedures were given in Blair’s
Language and Representation in Information Retrieval (1990))

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
303
is the “description requirement” of searching. The inquirer must also predict which of
those words do not occur in the documents she doesn’t want—this is the “discrimination
requirement” of searching. If the inquirer only had to predict a word that occurred in all
the documents she might want, she would use the word “the” as a search term. That would
retrieve all the desired documents, but it would also retrieve all the undesired documents,
too.)
It’s instructive to look at some of the examples of how this indeterminacy affected retrieval
in this case:412
In the legal case in question, one concern of the lawyers was an accident that had
occurred and was an object of litigation. The lawyers wanted all the reports, cor-
respondence, memoranda, and minutes of meetings that discussed this accident.
Formal queries were constructed that contained the word “accident” along with
the name of the [city] where it occurred. In the search for unretrieved relevant
documents, the experimenters later found that the accident was not always referred
to as an “accident,” but as an “event,” “incident,” “situation,” “problem,” or “dif-
ﬁculty,” often without mentioning the relevant proper name—the name of the city
in which it occurred. The manner in which an individual referred to the accident
was frequently dependent on his or her point of view. Those who discussed the
event in a critical or accusatory way referred to it quite directly–as an “accident.”
Those who were personally involved in the event, and perhaps culpable, tended to
refer to it euphemistically as, inter alia, an “unfortunate situation,” or a “difﬁculty.”
Sometimes the accident was referred to obliquely as “the subject of your last let-
ter,” “what happened last week was . . . ,” or, as in the opening lines of the minutes
of a meeting discussing the issue, “Mr. A: We all know why we’re here. . . .” [the
words “accident” and the name of the city were not used at any time in the meet-
ing either]. Sometimes relevant documents dealt with the problem by mentioning
only the technical aspects of why the accident occurred, but neither the accident
itself nor the people or place involved. Finally, much relevant information discussed
[contributing factors in] the situation prior to the accident and, naturally, contained
no reference to the accident itself.
Another information request resulted in the identiﬁcation of 3 key terms or phrases
that were used to retrieve relevant information. Later, the experimenters were able
to ﬁnd 26 other words and phrases that retrieved additional relevant documents. The
3 original key terms could not have been used individually as they would have re-
trieved 420 documents, or approximately 4000 pages of hard copy, an unreasonably
large set, most of which contained irrelevant information. Another request identi-
ﬁed 4 key terms/phrases that retrieved relevant documents, but it was possible to
ﬁnd 44 additional terms and combinations of terms to retrieve relevant documents
that had been missed.
Sometimes the experimenters followed a trail of linguistic creativity through the
database. In searching for documents discussing “trap correction” (one of the key
engineering phrases), it was discovered that relevant, un-retrieved documents had
discussed the same issue but referred to it as the “wire warp.” Continuing our
412These quotations are from Chapter 3 of Blair’s Language and Representation in Information Retrieval
(1990).

304
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
search, we found that in still other documents “trap correction” was referred to
in a third and novel way: the “shunt correction system.” Finally, it was discovered
that the inventor of this system was a man named “Coxwell” which directed the
experimenters to some documents he had authored, only he referred to the system as
the “Roman circle method.” Using the “Roman circle method” in a query directed
them to still more relevant but un-retrieved documents, but this was not the end
either. Further searching revealed that the system had been tested in another city,
and all documents germane to those tests referred to the system as the “air truck.”
At this point the search ended, having consumed over an entire 40-hour week of
on-line searching, but there is no reason to believe that the experimenters had found
all of the un-retrieved relevant documents; they simply ran out of time.
As the data base included many items of personal correspondence as well as the
verbatim minutes of meetings, the use of slang frequently changed the way in
which one would “normally” talk about a subject. Disabled or malfunctioning
mechanisms with which the lawsuit was concerned were sometimes referred to as
“sick” or “dead,” and a burned-out circuit was referred to as being “fried.” A critical
issue under discussion was sometimes referred to as a “smoking gun.”
Even misspellings proved an obstacle [to retrieval]. Key search terms like “ﬂat-
tening,” “gauge,” “memos,” and “correspondence,” which were essential parts of
search phrases, were used effectively to retrieve relevant documents. However, the
misspellings “ﬂatening,” “guage,” “gage,” “memoes,” and “correspondance,” using
the same phrases, also retrieved relevant documents. Misspellings like these, which
are tolerable in normal everyday correspondence, when included in a computer-
ized database become literal traps for users who are asked not only to anticipate the
key words and phrases that may be used to discuss an issue but also to foresee the
whole range of possible misspellings, letter transpositions, and typographical errors
that are likely to be committed. [While spelling correction sub routines in word-
processing programs have improved such problems, they have not eliminated them
since they generally cannot correct proper names which have been misspelled.]
Some information requests placed almost impossible demands on the ingenuity of
the individual constructing the query. In one situation, the lawyer wanted “Com-
pany A’s comments concerning [a speciﬁc subject]. . . .” Looking at the documents
authored by Company A was not enough, as many relevant comments were embed-
ded in the minutes of meetings or recorded secondhand in the documents authored
by others. Retrieving all the documents in which Company A was mentioned was
too broad a search; it retrieved over 5,000 documents (about 40,000+ pages of hard
copy). However, predicting the exact phraseology of the text in which Company A
commented on the issue was almost impossible; sometimes Company A was not
even mentioned, only that so-and-so (who represented Company A):
“said/considered/remarked/pointedout/commented/noted/explained/
discussed,”
etc. [the fact that this individual represented Company A was not included in the
document text and had to be known by the searcher.]
In some requests, the most important terms and phrases were not used at all in rel-
evant documents. For example, “steel quantity” was a key phrase used to retrieve
important relevant documents germane to an actionable issue in the lawsuit, but
unretrieved relevant documents were also found that did not report steel quantity at

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
305
all, but merely the number of such things as “girders,” “beams,” “frames,” “brac-
ings,” etc. In another request, it was important to ﬁnd documents that discussed
“non-expendable components.” In this case, relevant unretrieved documents merely
listed the names of the components (of which there were hundreds) and made no
mention of the broader generic description of these items as “nonexpendable.”
It might be countered that such linguistic variability as this is uncommon—it is
not. This linguistic variability is a consequence of the “productivity” of language
which we discussed brieﬂy above. Another question which arises is, why didn’t the
lawyers realize they were not getting all of the information relevant to a particular
issue? Certainly they knew the lawsuit. They had been involved with it from the
beginning—over a year—and were the principal attorneys representing the defense.
In addition, one of the paralegals had been instrumental not only in setting up
the information retrieval system, but also in supervising the selection of relevant
information to be put on-line. Might it not be reasonable to expect them to be
suspicious that they were not retrieving everything they wanted? Not really. Because
the database was so large (providing access to over 350,000 pages of hard copy, all
of which was in some way pertinent to the lawsuit), it would be unreasonable to
expect four individuals (two lawyers and two paralegals) to have total, literal recall
of all the important supporting facts, testimony, and related data that was germane
to the case. If they had such recall they would have no need for a computerized,
interactive retrieval system. It is well known among cognitive psychologists that
man’s power of literal recall is much less effective than his power of recognition.
The lawyers could remember the exact text of some of the important information,
but this was a very small subset of the total information relevant to a particular
issue.
The system, above, as mentioned, contained 40,000 documents. Yet this was just a small
part of the entire system which was projected to have over 1,000,000 documents, approx-
imately 10,000,000 pages of online text, by the time the trial began. As we have pointed
out, some of the indeterminacy of natural language is due to the size of the text in which
it occurs. If the above linguistic variability was found in the comparatively small prelim-
inary system, the linguistic variability and difﬁculty retrieving the desired documents in
sets smaller than the inquirer’s futility point would likely be signiﬁcantly higher—again,
the analogy of doing content searches on the Internet using an Internet search engine is
apropos, especially since Internet search engines are basically full-text retrieval systems
like STAIRS was. The difference is, of course, that most Internet searches are not in
defense of a multi-million dollar lawsuit, as the above example was, so when relevant doc-
uments/websites are missed it is not nearly as crucial. Although this study was published
over 20 years ago, the problems it identiﬁes are still critical in information retrieval. The
fact that an Internet search using the names of the authors “Blair and Maron” links to
several hundred websites in 2004 shows that the issues it discussed are still relevant to
today’s information systems.
The “Determinacy of Sense”: An Old Logical Problem
Talking about the indeterminacy of language is a broad and conceptually deep endeavor,
one in which we can easily lose our intellectual footing. But here, as elsewhere in this
manuscript, Wittgenstein has left us some guideposts.

306
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Computers are fundamentally logical systems, and the evolution of computer models has
some parallels with the evolution of models of formal logic (the logic of relations existed
for almost a century before the ﬁrst relational database was proposed and built by a
philosopher at the Rand Corporation413). The high determinacy of representation in the
data model recalls the concern over the “determinacy of sense” in language that occupied
several prominent philosophers in the early 20th century. Germany’s Gottlob Frege and
England’s Bertrand Russell were the most prominent logicians of this period. For them,
the primary purpose of language was to assert facts. Facts themselves are either true or
false—there are no other choices. If language asserts facts, and facts are either true or
false, then it is necessary that language should be able to represent these facts precisely.
The words or assertions which correspond to the facts must have a “deﬁnite sense,” that
is, their meaning or application must be only one of two choices: true or false (what
logicians call the “excluded middle” or “bivalence”: If A is an assertion about a fact, then
the expression (A v ¬A) is true for all values of A. That is, if A = “It is raining” then
it is necessarily true that “It is raining” (A) or (v) “It is not raining” (¬A)). Frege and
Russell believed that ordinary language was logically ﬂawed and did not measure up to
the criterion of deﬁnite sense. Consequently, they believed that the analytic precision that
philosophical analysis required could only be attained by a specially constructed logical
language which could maintain the requisite deﬁnite sense of its assertions. Wittgenstein
was a student of Russell’s and a prot´eg´e of Frege’s. In his early work, the Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus, Wittgenstein agreed with Frege and Russell that language asserted
facts and that its assertions about facts, what philosophers call “propositions,” must be
“bivalent.” As he stated in the Tractatus:
A proposition must restrict reality to two alternatives: yes or no. [TLP 4.023]
But Wittgenstein went farther than his predecessors by saying that the logical structure of
factual assertions was the factual structure of the world—a grand statement that assured
that language would have the same determinacy of sense as the “facts” of the world.414 But
Wittgenstein broke with Frege and Russell’s assertion that ordinary language was logically
defective and needed to be replaced by a more precise logical language:
413The philosopher who designed the ﬁrst working Relational Data Base was M.E. Maron [M.E. Maron. “Rela-
tional Data File I: Design Philosophy,” Information Retrieval: A Critical View. Thompson Book , Washington,
DC, 1966. Edited by G. Schector.] After designing it, Maron worked with R.E. Levien to build an actual working
model. This was reported in: R.E. Levien. “Relational Data File II: Implementation” [Information Retrieval:
A Critical View, Thompson Book, Washington, D C, 1966. Edited by G. Schector] and R. E. Levien and M.
E. Maron. “A Computer System for Inference Execution and Data Retrieval,” Communications of the ACM,
vol. 10:11, pp. 715–721, November 1967.
414Wittgenstein presented this view in the Tractatus:
2.1
We picture facts to ourselves.
2.12
A picture is a model of reality.
2.141
A picture is a fact.
2.15
The fact that the elements of a picture are related to one another in a determinate way
represents that things are related to one another in the same way.
2.1511
That is how a picture is attached to reality; it reaches right out to it.
2.1512
It is laid against reality like a measure.

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
307
All the propositions of our everyday language, just as they stand, are in good logical
order. [TLP 5.5563]
With this statement Wittgenstein is making a subtle, but important distinction with Frege
and Russell. He is saying that language is not logically defective, that assertions about
facts can, and do, make sense. He is not saying that language cannot be misunderstood,
and that sometimes our assertions about facts are not vague or ambiguous. They can be.
What ordinary language does is it obscures or disguises the underlying logical form of its
assertions:
Everyday language is part of the human organism and is no less complicated than it.
It is not humanly possible to gather immediately from it what the logic of language
is. [TLP 4.002]
Most of the propositions and questions of philosophers arise from our failure to
understand the logic of our language. [TLP 4.003]
We don’t need to construct a separate logically precise language, we just need to analyse
our assertions in ordinary language according to strict logical principles, as his mentor
Bertrand Russell had done:
It was Russell who performed the service of showing that the apparent logical form
of a proposition need not be its real one. [TLP 4.0031]
The logical structure of language just needs to be brought out. Logic doesn’t give us an
ideal language, it simply gives us a form of notation and a method that we can use to bring
out the logical order of ordinary language.
Over the next 3 decades, Wittgenstein gradually reassessed this position. In the ﬁrst place,
he saw that language did not have an underlying logical order which needed to be brought
out to resolve ambiguities or determine the meaning of a statement. No logical order could
do this because for it to work it must be able to not only tell us the meaning of a word,
but the meaning of that word in all possible circumstances and uses. Issues of meaning,
he began to see, are not resolved by uncovering something inherent in language, they are
resolved by looking at how the statement in question is used. He also came to reject the
notion that the meaning of a word had to have a deﬁnite sense, believing that such a notion
was ultimately incoherent because it could be applied variously in different contexts of
language use. That is, the notion of a deﬁnite sense is not one thing, since it varied in
different contexts and circumstances. For example, suppose I am with a friend who is
sitting at a desk and typing on his Macintosh computer. If he says that “the computer”
works very well, I know exactly what “the computer” means. But if my friend says that “the
computer” used by the IRS has proved unreliable, I have only the vaguest idea what “the
computer” actually means here—it could be any one of hundreds of brands and models
of computers. Even when such a thing as a deﬁnite sense does exist in language, it is
not something that is a property of words. Words, by themselves, do not have precise
meanings, but their uses could have. Wittgenstein’s reassessment of his earlier position
lead him to reject the single comprehensive notion of a deﬁnite sense and to adopt a more
complex notion of meaning in language which recognized that the sense of language was

308
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
precise in some contexts and uses but could have varying levels of indeterminacy in other
contexts and uses. This break with what Wittgenstein called his “old way of thinking”
comes out in his criticism of Frege in Philosophical Investigations:
One might say that the concept “game” is a concept with blurred edges.—“But
is a blurred concept a concept at all?”—Is an indistinct photograph a picture of a
person at all? Is it even always an advantage to replace an indistinct picture by a
sharp one? Isn’t the indistinct one often exactly what we need?
Frege compares a concept to an area and says that an area with vague boundaries
cannot be called an area at all. This presumably means that we cannot do anything
with it.—But is it senseless to say: “Stand roughly there?” Suppose that I were
standing with someone in a city square and said that. As I say it I do not draw
any kind of boundary, but perhaps point with my hand—as if I were indicating a
particular spot. And this is just how one might explain to someone what a game is.
One gives examples and intends them to be taken in a particular way.—I do not,
however, mean by this that he is supposed to see in those examples that common
thing which I—for some reason—was unable to express; but that he is now to
employ those examples in a particular way. Here giving examples is not an indirect
means of explaining—in default of a better. For any general deﬁnition can be
misunderstood too. The point is that this is how we play the game. (I mean the
language-game with the word “game.”) [PI §71]
It is important to avoid an obvious misinterpretation of Wittgenstein here. He is not saying
that vagueness is an essential feature of language, in a sense promoting vagueness in
language as necessary and useful. What he is doing is simply resisting the requirement for
the “strict determinacy of sense” in language that Frege and Russell insisted was necessary
for language to express meanings clearly. For Frege and Russell, each individual word had
to have a meaning that was clear and precisely determinate. If it didn’t, Frege insisted, the
indeterminacy of meaning would multiply as words were combined into sentences. But
here again Wittgenstein debunks this view in his later writing:
When I give the description: “The ground was quite covered with plants”—do you
want to say I don’t know what I am talking about until I can give a deﬁnition of a
plant? [PI §70]
The meaning of this statement, as well as his other example, “stand roughly there,” are, in
the proper circumstances, perfectly clear even though they both use words—“plants” and
“roughly”—that, by themselves, are somewhat vague. As Wittgenstein has shown us, we
should “Let the use teach you the meaning” [PI p. 212]. Of course, this does not mean that
these statements are always clear. We can imagine circumstances, that is, uses, in which
they are not. For example, if I go to a store and ask the clerk for some weed killer saying
that “The ground was quite covered with plants that I want to get rid of” the clerk might
say that he needed to know exactly what kind of plants they were in order to give me the
proper weed killer. Or, if I say “Stand roughly here” but point to the edge of a precipice,
the person I am addressing might reasonably ask, “Where do you mean exactly?”
What is the relationship between the quest for a logical model of language with a deﬁnite
sense, and the difference between data retrieval and content, or document, retrieval? In

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
309
the ﬁrst place, data are usually considered to be “facts,” so an instance of a Data Model
is, in some sense, an implicit assertion about the truth or falsity of the speciﬁc facts
that are organized by it (e.g., the record that shows that Roy Blakney lives at 10 Green
St Court, is an implicit assertion that an individual by that name currently lives at that
address). The various editing and integrity constraints that can be applied to the data or
facts on a database are aimed at preserving the recorded values of these facts. Further,
the data manipulation and data deﬁnition languages of the Data Model have some of the
characteristics of the ideal logical language which Frege and Russell sought—take SQL
as an example: SQL is separate from natural language; its operators are precisely deﬁned
in a way that much of the grammar of natural language cannot be; and for most of the data
it is used to specify it’s application has a deﬁnite sense—it is either true or false.415
If we can take any lesson from Wittgenstein’s evolving view of representation in language
it is that the simple logical model with a deﬁnite sense and an excluded middle, while
rigorous, has only a narrow range of application, namely, to only those items of data or
information whose representations have a deﬁnite sense—a high level of representational
determinacy (or low level of indeterminacy). As Wittgenstein saw the limitations of the
model of language with a deﬁnite sense, in particular, that the logical model of language
was not something that underlay language use and needed to be uncovered, and that even
the idea of a strict determinacy of sense was a false ideal because a general universally
applicable conception of such determinacy was incoherent. His own views evolved to a
more complex assessment of language in which meaning was not a context-free property
of individual words, but was often dependent on context and could be determinate in some
contexts and uses and indeterminate in varying degrees in others (And “indeterminacy”
is not a pejorative term. It merely expresses a particular state of the sense or meaning of
an expression.). In the same manner we can view the transition from the Data Model to
the Document Model of information systems as, not a break with the past and the creation
of a new form of representation, but the natural evolution of a precise, but limited, data
model to a more complex and comprehensive document model—a model that includes the
precision of the data model in some circumstances, but also incorporates the capacity for
the less determinate representations of intellectual content often found in the document
model. In his later writings, Wittgenstein himself summarized the transition from the
precise logical model of language to the more complex context-dependent model of his
later writings:
The more narrowly we examine language, the sharper becomes the conﬂict between
it and our requirement (For the crystalline purity of logic was, of course, not a
result of investigation; it was a requirement.). The conﬂict becomes intolerable; the
requirement is now in danger of becoming empty.—We have got onto slippery ice
where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also,
just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want to walk; so we need friction.
Back to the rough ground! [PI §107]
415In the Database literature, there is some discussion of the need for 3-valued logics rather than two, primarily
because of the ambiguity of the “null” value—for example, when an employee record has a null value where
an employee’s spouse is to be listed, does it mean that he/she has no spouse, or does it mean that the spouse’s
name was simply not recorded? But, to date, data base management system manufacturers have not agreed on a
uniform way to handle such ambiguities.

310
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
The Data Model has, as I have already stated, been enormously successful in its application
to data management. But its implicit unstated requirement for determinacy of represen-
tation made for a neat, but bounded domain of application. This was ﬁne as long as the
principal applications dealt with precisely speciﬁable data whose correctness was evident,
or decidable, in every case (e.g., that “Roger Picquet’s address” is correct and the same
in each of its occurrences on the multiple databases or ﬁles in which it appears). But as
database applications have evolved, database management systems began to be used to
manage information such as documents and images whose representations of intellectual
content often didn’t fall into the precisely deﬁned categories or value ranges of the data
model. If this indeterminate information is “forced” into the more precise data model, then
the data model becomes a Procrustean bed in which everything “ﬁts” but access may still
not be adequate, because the apparent precision only hides an underlying indeterminacy of
representation. The evolution from the Data to the Document Model is, in a metaphorical
sense, a movement from the “crystalline purity of logic” back to Wittgenstein’s “rough
ground.” What is the “rough ground?” The “rough ground” consists, in part, of the cir-
cumstances and context which help to give language meaning, and which can mitigate
the ambiguity of document representations. If the evolution of the precise Data Model to
the more complex—but more broadly applicable—Document Model is analogous to the
development of Wittgenstein’s idea of logic, representation, and deﬁnite sense, then the
development of the Document Model is contingent on being able to build more of the
context of information creation and use into the representation scheme of the Document
Model—it is “information in context.”
Description and Discrimination (Either can be Indeterminate)
Representations of information, what we call indexes, have two fundamental objectives:
description and discrimination: they must describe the “intellectual content” of a particular
corpus of information, and they must discriminate that information from information that
has a similar intellectual content. The judgment of the quality of indexes lies primarily
(though not solely) with the searchers: the indexes must describe the information the
way that searchers who are looking for that information would describe it.416 But the
indexes must also, through these descriptions, discriminate the information the searchers
would ﬁnd useful from similar information which they would not ﬁnd useful. The goal of
indexes is to identify all and only the information that the searcher would ﬁnd useful—
description identiﬁes all the useful information, while discrimination identiﬁes only the
useful information.
The quality of description and discrimination vary quite widely in information systems.
Databases which provide access to highly determinate data, such as bank accounts which
are indexed by unique names or social security numbers, both describe and discrimi-
nate well. Descriptions such as, “name,” “address,” “account balance,” or “social security
number” have clear senses, or meanings, that are easily understood within the context and
416This is the “operational theory of about” put forward by M.E. Maron in his “On Indexing, Retrieval and the
Meaning of About” [Journal of the American Society for Information Science, vol. 28:1, pp. 38–43, January
1977]. This deﬁnition, while insightful, only models description, not discrimination.

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
311
practice of banking. The description “social security number” discriminates well since
it links account information to uniquely identiﬁable individuals, a requirement for the
practice of banking.
But, as we pointed out before, there are kinds of data retrieval systems, like the hypothet-
ical Shanghai phonebook, that, although they describe their data correctly, they do not
discriminate it well enough to distinguish items of information (names) which have many
occurrences.417 Here we might say that some data retrieval systems while successful at
describing the data or information that they provide access to, suffer from a failure to
discriminate useful data for the searchers who use them. But other kinds of information
systems may suffer from failures of description as well as failures of discrimination. This
is the case, as we mentioned brieﬂy before, for those information systems that provide
access to the “intellectual content” of texts or images. A failure of description occurs
when the intellectual content of a document or image is described in a way that the typical
searcher, who wants that document or image, would not be able to anticipate. For exam-
ple, a book that discusses what the searchers would call “continental drift” is indexed
under the description “plate tectonics.” This usually occurs when the index scheme—the
vocabulary that has been selected to represent the intellectual content of texts or images—
does not match very well the way that searchers might describe the intellectual content
of those texts or images. But descriptions of intellectual content can fail to discriminate
as well. This occurs when the index terms the searchers use to describe what they want
identify categories that have very high numbers of members. This sort of problem occurs
in the subject catalogues of large libraries, but is often seen as a consequence of using
World Wide Web search engines to search for intellectual content. On the Web, searches
using fairly general terms like “computers” or “travel” or “investing” return thousands,
sometimes millions of websites that match them. This is a failure of discrimination.
The Consequences of Indeterminacy in Information Retrieval
Since indeterminacy in language is the principal factor that determines the successful
retrieval of information content, we should take a moment to look at the actual conse-
quences of indeterminate searches on information systems. First of all, we should note
that indeterminacy is not a property of individual index terms, or a property of informa-
tion retrieval systems. As Wittgenstein showed us, indeterminacy is a function of how
the searcher wants to use the information she is looking for: if she just wants to look at
a few samples of information on a particular topic, then the determinacy of her search
terms does not need to be high. But if she needs to ﬁnd the “best” information on a very
precisely deﬁned topic, and is not at all interested in information with similar intellectual
417While most phone books rely only on the uniqueness of names to discriminate individual listings, instances
like the hypothetical Shanghai phone book could still provide unique listings if the searcher knew both the name
and the address of the person whose phone number he is looking up. This, of course, puts an additional burden
on the searcher and makes his search more difﬁcult. In fact, it is almost a truism that an information system that
does not describe or discriminate well is often trading off indexing effort for searching effort: that is, less effort
in indexing results in information systems that do not describe or discriminate well, and a system with such
ﬂaws makes effective searching much more difﬁcult than a system that does a better job of description and/or
discrimination.

312
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
content that is not the “best,” the determinacy of her search terms needs to be very high.
Previously, we drew the major distinction in information systems as being between Data
Retrieval and Document Retrieval. While it is the case that Data Retrieval tends to be
fairly determinate, and Document, or Content, Retrieval relatively indeterminate, there
are instances as we have shown where Data Retrieval can be somewhat indeterminate and
Document Retrieval can be relatively determinate. It all depends on the manner in which
the information is represented and the use to which the searcher wants to put the informa-
tion. The real distinction between Data Retrieval and Document retrieval is the distinction
between “Determinate Searching” and “Indeterminate Searching.” Since Data Retrieval is
the exemplar of Determinate Searching, and Document Content Retrieval is the exemplar
of Indeterminate Searching, we will refer to distinctions between Data Retrieval and Doc-
ument Retrieval in the following discussion of the distinctions between Determinate and
Indeterminate Searching. It will be easier for the reader to see the important distinctions
if the examples are given of searching for Data and searching for Document Content.
DISTINCTION 1: THE TYPE OF QUERY
The typical queries for document and data retrieval differ noticeably. For determinate data
retrieval, the question names the desired information fairly precisely. An inquiry for Roy
Blakney’s phone number is described as a request for “Roy Blakney’s phone number.”
There is very little ambiguity about how to describe it. Document content queries are
often much more indirect and ambiguous. They tend to look like: “Give me information
that discusses the economic tradeoffs between distributed database management systems
and centralized systems for databases with high transaction rates.” From this question it
is impossible to determine what the exact formal query might be to retrieve the desired
information. For example, should the inquirer look under speciﬁc subject terms like “dis-
tributed databases,” “economics,” “budgeting,” “cost analysis,” etc., or, under the names of
computer vendors who might provide distributed databases or manage them such as IBM
or Oracle—or, some Boolean combination of these terms. Further, does the inquirer want
actual budgeting information for individual systems, or averaged over several systems;
or does the inquirer want explanations of a more general or theoretical nature? Does the
inquirer want comparative analysis of systems of different size, in different industries, or
managing different kinds of data, etc? Such questions can go on indeﬁnitely. It is also the
case, that a determinate search for data on one system will be very much like a determinate
search for the same data on another system, but an indeterminate search for document
content, even though it is looking for the same information, might require vastly different
search strategies on different systems.
DISTINCTION 2: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FORMAL QUERY AND THE
REPRESENTATION OF THE SATISFACTORY ANSWER
In retrieval we can identify three principal linguistic relationships:
Between the request for information and the formal query;
Between the formal query and the representation of the information desired;

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
313
Between the representation of the information desired and the intellectual
content of that information.
The relationship between a formal data retrieval query and the representation of a
satisfactory answer is typically deterministic. A request for Brian O’Connor’s social
security number will be satisﬁed only with Brian O’Connor’s social security number.
Hence, there is usually a clear mapping between the description in a formal query of
what is desired—“O’Connor’s social security number”—and the representation of that
information in a data management system. In SQL, the de facto standard data access
language, it might look like this:
SELECT
SSN
FROM
EMPLOYEE TABLE
WHERE
NAME = “O’Connor”;
There is also a deterministic relationship between the request for data and the formal
query which retrieves the right information. From a logical point of view, the relationship
between a data retrieval request and the formal query that retrieves what you want is
similar to the notion of “analytic” statements in language. Analytic statements are like
“All bachelors are unmarried.” This statement is analytic—that is, it is necessarily true—
because the idea of being “unmarried” is part of the deﬁnition of what a bachelor is. No
amount of empirical investigation can prove or disprove an analytic statement, it is true
by deﬁnition. In a similar sense, the correct formal data query is often embedded in the
description of the original request for information. If you ask, “What is Brian O’Connor’s
employee number?” the formal terms “SSN” and “O’Connor” used in the formal SQL
query are part of the deﬁnition of “employee number” and “Brian O’Connor” in the
original request. So, more formally, we might say that for most data retrieval requests
the relation between the data request and the correct formal query is analytic.
In document retrieval, the request for information and the query that retrieves the
desired document(s) may be entirely, and unpredictably, dissimilar. Consider again the
example from the STAIRS study (see the quotation at footnote 412) where the request
was for documents that discussed “steel quantity.” Most of the relevant documents did not
use the phrase “steel quantity” at all, but merely referred to the number of such things as
“girders,” “beams,” “frames,” “bracings,” etc. While the relationship between a determi-
nate data query and the representation of the correct answer is generally deterministic,
the relationship between an indeterminate document query and the representation of
the most useful documents is generally probabilistic.
DISTINCTION 3: CRITERION OF SUCCESSFUL RETRIEVAL
The evaluation of retrieval effectiveness for determinate data retrieval is fairly straight-
forward: Did the system retrieve the correct answer to the query? If you asked for “Arpad
Kerekes’ address” then only Arpad Kerekes’ correct address would be a successful an-
swer. No other address will do, and there are no “partially correct” answers. Further, there
are usually ways of verifying correctness independently of the information system itself.
The decision whether data retrieval is successful or not is, thus, binary—either it got the

314
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
right data, or it did not—this is what logicians call the “excluded middle.” Since document
retrieval has a less straightforward relation between the query and the representation of
desired documents, the standard of success cannot be as rigid as correctness. Retrieved
documents are judged to be useful or not useful, and some documents can be more, or
less, useful than others. Hence, document retrieval success is often judged in terms of
degrees of effectiveness, and only under special circumstances can a document be thought
of as correct or not. The standard of effectiveness for document retrieval is one of utility
rather than correctness. Utility is a much more complex and problematic performance cri-
terion to measure than correctness, and, typically, there are no objective, user-independent
standards of utility.418
Although documents may be judged useful or not useful, their utility is not just a property
of the information itself, it is contingent on the background and abilities of those who
would use the information, and on the use to which it will be put: one document may be
useful for one individual, but not for another, even though both individuals are searching
for information to solve the same problem (e.g., the retrieved document may be very
“technical” and while one searcher has the necessary background to understand it, the
other searcher does not). Since the effectiveness of data retrieval is, as we have observed,
usually contingent on the correctness of the data, the background and abilities of those
who use the information do not usually affect this judgment—that is, an item of data is
correct whether or not it is thought to be correct by the searcher, but a document cannot
usually be judged useful if the searcher does not think it is so. Thus, while correctness is
an independent property of data itself, utility is a broader notion that extends beyond the
information itself and includes the background, abilities, and intentions of the searcher.
DISTINCTION 4: THE SPEED OF SUCCESSFUL RETRIEVAL
Since the process of determinate data retrieval generally consists of the simple matching
of formal queries to descriptions of the data, the speed of successful data retrieval is
primarily dependent on the physical searching speeds of the computer. Faster computers
and more efﬁcient methods of searching and storage translate into a “better” data retrieval
system, all other things being equal. But, because of the indeterminacy of document
content representation—that is, that there is usually no single, direct link between a formal
query and the intellectual content of useful documents, document searches are typically
characterized by trial-and-error: The inquirer submits a formal query, retrieves a number
of documents, evaluates their utility, and, if not enough useful documents are retrieved,
modiﬁes the original query and retrieves a new set of documents. This process may repeat
itself many times during a search, especially on large document collections. To understand
this iterative process, one needs only to think of conducting a subject search on the World
Wide Web. Here, individual websites are equivalent to the individual documents in our
model. Because of the trial-and-error nature of document retrieval, the speed of successful
retrieval is not primarily dependent on the physical searching speeds of the computer, but
on the number of websites or documents the inquirer must evaluate, and the number of
418William Cooper was the ﬁrst to show that utility was the principal criterion of success for document content
retrieval: W.S. Cooper. “On Selecting a Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness, Part I: The ‘Subjective’ Philosophy
of Evaluation,” Journal of the American Society for Information Science, vol. 24, pp. 87–100, 1973.

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
315
revisions of his query he must make in the course of ﬁnding what he needs. In short, the
speed of document retrieval is primarily contingent on the number of logical decisions
the inquirer must make during the course of her search. No matter how fast the physical
searching speeds of the retrieval systems are, the searcher is still faced with the task of
evaluating the retrieved documents, and deciding on subsequent query revisions. Unlike
data retrieval, simply using a faster computer does not guarantee better access to document
content. A faster computer may only get you the useless documents faster, and there may
be too many useless documents to look at in a reasonably large system.
The difference between the speeds of determinate data retrieval and document content
retrieval is like the difference in speeds between a racecar and a delivery truck. Since a
racecar merely goes from the start to the ﬁnish, its physical speed is a reasonably good
indicator of how fast it will run the race. But for the delivery truck, its physical speed
matters less than the number of stops (deliveries) it must make along the way—a Ferrari
won’t help a newspaper boy deliver his papers any faster than a bicycle if he has to stop
and park it at every house and the houses are close together. But a delivery truck may
also deliver things to the wrong addresses and must then take additional time to straighten
this out. In such a case the delivery process is extended and may reach a point where it
is never completed, that is, some customers never get their packages. Analogously, just
as the delivery truck may deliver the wrong things to a customer, a document retrieval
system can deliver useless documents to an inquirer. In some situations, the inquirer,
like the hapless customer, may never get what he wants, and, likewise, the document
search or “delivery” process may extend to the point where it is never ﬁnished. Because
of these differences in how search speed may be assessed, data retrieval is improved by
increasing the speed of physical access, while document retrieval can only be improved by
reducing the number of logical decisions the inquirer must make. Automated document
retrieval procedures may reduce the number of decisions an inquirer must make, but it
does not eliminate them. The reduction of the number of logical decisions can be effected
by improving the representation of the documents, by improving the inferences that a
system needs to make to match formal requests to useful documents, or, by providing
expert searchers to help the users of the system. Because of the dominance of the determi-
nate Data Retrieval Model, some system designers have made the erroneous assumption
that the increase in physical searching speed of a document content retrieval system will
improve its effectiveness the way that such an increase in physical searching speed im-
proves a determinate data retrieval system. Wittgenstein would call this a “disease of
thinking.”
DISTINCTION 5: REPRESENTING INFORMATION: THE EFFECT
OF SEMANTIC INDETERMINACY
Data items are typiﬁed by the relatively few ways in which they can be represented. An
“address” is simply an “address,” there are no obvious other simple ways to represent or
refer to that kind of information. An “employee number” might be variously termed an
“employee ID” or an “Social Security Number” or an “ID number” or an “SSN.” But even
here there is still a relatively limited number of ways to represent it. Documents with a
particular subject content, on the other hand, can be represented in an almost unlimited

316
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
number of ways. Suppose an inquirer wanted a document dealing with the “techniques
of records management.” How might such information be represented? Well, it might be
under “techniques of records management,” of course, but it might also be represented as:
records management systems
records organization
records organizing systems
ﬁle management
techniques of ﬁle management
ﬁle management systems
systems of ﬁle management
ﬁling systems
ﬁling methods
methods of ﬁling
methods of ﬁle management
techniques of ﬁle organization
ﬁle organization methods
information systems
techniques of information system design
ofﬁce systems
ofﬁce information systems419
...
With the aid of a thesaurus, such a list could be extended considerably. But even this
does not exhaust the ways in which this kind of information could be represented. Useful
documents might be listed under the names of the numerous speciﬁc commercial records
management systems such as “FileNet,” “PCDocs,” or “Documentum” and might not
have any generic descriptions like the ones above. The consequence of this phenomenon
is that it becomes increasingly problematic for the inquirer to guess the description(s)
that represent the documents he wants. An experiment conducted by Swanson420 showed
that when indexers were encouraged to assign as many subject terms as possible to short
physics papers they were able to ﬁnd pertinent subject descriptions with virtually no upper
limit. Such unlimited semantic ﬂexibility in language was ﬁrst proposed by the mathe-
matician/philosopher C.S. Peirce in the 19th century. He called this aspect of language
“unlimited semiosis.”421 Peirce believed that most semantic “meaning” could be repre-
sented by an unlimited number of different words, word combinations, and phrases. In the
1960’s the logician Yehoshua Bar-Hillel also recognized this combinatorial aspect of lan-
guage drawing an a propos analogy between the representation of meaning for a linguistic
419This list was the result of some information systems work I was doing at a company. The managers I was
talking to did not believe that it was problematic to represent document content, so I gave each of them a copy
of the same document entitled “Techniques of Records Management” and asked them to each write down what
he/she thought was the main subject description for it, and to not talk to each other in the process. This is the
list that resulted.

expression and the endless—and undecidable—ways that the same number could be repre-
sented [e.g., 4 = (3 + 1) = (7 – 3) = (1765 – 1761) = (positive square root of 16), etc.].422
More recently, Langendoen and Postal423 have asserted that the collection of sentences
which comprise a natural language is so vast that its magnitude cannot be represented
by any number, ﬁnite or transﬁnite. As a consequence, no algorithm, Turing Machine or
generative grammar can construct or produce all of the possible well-formed sentences
in a language. Prima facie, this is a different problem than the one we have described by
the phrase “unlimited semiosis.” But it is still part of the same linguistic phenomenon.
The fact that the set of all possible well-formed sentences in a language is uncountably
inﬁnite is certainly related to the phenomenon that Peirce observed that a given linguistic
“meaning” has an unlimited number of representations. The practical consequences of this
phenomenon have been a persistent irritant to work on “semantic networks.” Here, unless
the network is unusually small the number of words and phrases that can be linked to a
set of semantic “meanings” can quickly grow to unmanageable proportions. This indeter-
minacy in language has been a signiﬁcant problem for Artiﬁcial Intelligence which terms
it the “exponential explosion”424 and has undermined many attempts to provide realistic
natural language processing or semantic networking.
DISTINCTION 6: THE END-POINT OF SEARCHING
Because determinate data retrieval depends on a fairly straightforward matching of queries
to representations, if the query does not retrieve what you want you can be fairly certain
that the desired data does not exist on the information system. For example, if you submit
a well-formed request for Mary Sinico’s address and the system replies that no records
match the query, it is very likely that that information does not exist on the database. This
is a direct result of the low indeterminacy of representation for data.
On the other hand, for document retrieval, if you submit a query and retrieve no useful
documents, it does not mean that there are no useful documents in the system. Because
so many formal queries can be derived from a single topical request (see the “records
management” example in Distinction 5, supra), the negative results may only mean that
you have not guessed, in your formal query, the words that represent the documents you
would ﬁnd useful.
DISTINCTION 7: TYPES OF SEARCHES
Determinate data retrieval is characterized by one kind of search: an exact match of the
formal query with speciﬁc data representations. This may retrieve a single data item or it
may retrieve an aggregate of data based on a number of exact matches, such as when the
search looks for data in a speciﬁc range. Document retrieval, on the other hand, is typiﬁed

318
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
by at least three different kinds of searches: sample, exhaustive, and speciﬁc.425 Sample
searches are those where the inquirer needs only a few of the documents on a given topic,
so any reasonably good documents on the subject will sufﬁce (one can imagine a marketing
executive for a manufacturing ﬁrm wanting to see examples of what customers are saying
about his company’s products. He doesn’t want everything written by or about customers
who bought his products, but only a selection of such writings). Exhaustive searches are at
the other extreme and require all the documents that might satisfy a particular information
need. Legal searching and searching to support research often require exhaustive searches.
Speciﬁc searches are those where one must either ﬁnd a speciﬁc document that satisﬁes
the information need, or ﬁnd evidence that the desired document does not exist. Speciﬁc
searches are typical of patent searching. Here, the inventor or patent attorney must either
ﬁnd a document that describes the existence of a previous patent that matches the one
being applied for, or search enough to develop evidence that no such single prior patent
exists.
One of the characteristic difﬁculties of document retrieval design is that often systems
are designed to support one kind of searching, say, sample, but over time the needs of
the inquirers change and the system is used more for exhaustive or speciﬁc searches.
A system designed for sample searching is not well-suited for exhaustive or speciﬁc
searching. Further, document representation schemes are especially difﬁcult to change
in a reasonably large system, so it may be difﬁcult to convert a sample-oriented search
system into an exhaustive or speciﬁc-oriented searching system. This is part of a more
general problem of the structure of searching, that a lack of foresight in the selection
of the searchable categories of a set of documents may leave a searcher without good
access points for her searches. For example, in the STAIRS evaluation (q.v.) searching
was based on the precise word content of the documents and a few categories such as
“author”and“date.”Afterthesystemwasbuiltitwasdiscoveredthatthelawyersfrequently
wanted to ﬁnd documents of a particular type (internal memos, outside letters, minutes
of meetings, different types of reports, budget statements, etc). Since “document-type”
was not a searchable ﬁeld on the system, this kind of search could not be made. This is
a common problem for document content retrieval systems that start as small systems
but develop into much larger systems. Categories of documents that were relatively small
and could be searched in their entirety on a small system, may grow larger than a typical
inquirer would be willing to look through.426 When the STAIRS system was smaller,
the searchers could retrieve the documents with the words they wanted in them, then
look through the retrieved set to ﬁnd the document types that they wanted. But as the

319
system got larger and the retrieved sets got correspondingly larger, it became very time-
consuming to look through entire retrieved sets for the document types that the searcher
desired.
DISTINCTION 8: SCALING UP THE SYSTEM
Increasing the size of an existing determinate data retrieval system generally does not cause
any major difﬁculties with retrieval. The process of normalization, the principal method of
database design, does not take the size of the database into consideration when normalizing
record structures. Again, less determinate document content retrieval systems are more
problematic. Size does inﬂuence document content retrieval effectiveness, all other things
being equal. In fact, the fastest way to turn a good document content retrieval system into a
bad one is simply to make it larger. Consider the following example. Suppose a document
retrieval query consists of the following terms: “Databases” AND “Distributed” (This
will retrieve documents that contain both words “Databases” and “Distributed” in their
text, or as assigned index terms.). Let’s suppose, further, that it retrieves 50 documents
that match the query, and 1 of those documents is judged to be useful. Now, let’s suppose
that the document collection grows signiﬁcantly. This generally means that the number
of documents retrieved by our query will increase, too. Now let’s say that the number
of documents retrieved by our query is 500 instead of 50. While 50 documents might be
tedious to browse through to ﬁnd our one useful document, 500 documents would probably
be too many to look through. This is what is known as “output overload.” The easiest way
to reduce the number of documents retrieved by a query is to simply add another term,
conjunctively, to the original query. For example: “Databases” AND “Distributed” AND
“Relational.” We have now speciﬁed that the term “Relational” must appear in the text or
indexing record of the retrieved documents, in addition to the two original terms. Suppose
that this query now retrieves 50 documents. Since we now have only 50 documents in our
retrieved set, are we in the same position as we were after submitting the original query
to the smaller document collection? Not necessarily. While we have only 50 documents
again, these are not likely to be the same 50 documents that we had originally. It is also
possible that the one useful document that we found in the original 50 may not be included
in the second 50. What has happened here is that a quantitative change in the system
has caused a qualitative (i.e., semantic) change in the search strategy (i.e., the search
query “Databases” AND “Distributed” AND “Relational” is semantically different from
the search query “Databases” AND “Distributed”). This qualitative change means that it
will require an increased searching effort to achieve the same level of effectiveness in the
larger system as was achieved in the smaller system.
For some numerical information, data retrieval has other ways of dealing with large
numbers of records that are not available to document retrieval systems—aggregation,
graphical representation and data modeling. Many large sets of values can be represented
meaningfully by totals, rates, averages or mathematical models: for example, the total
sales for each salesperson, the average salary of COBOL programmers with 10 years
experience, the backorder rate for new products, etc. The technique of Data Warehous-
ing deals almost entirely with extremely large data sets of aggregated data—data that

320
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
would be incomprehensible without being summarized in some way.427 Other numerical
information can be presented graphically in ways that make it easy to see the general
characteristics, like trends, of un-aggregated information. Some relations might even be
difﬁcult—perhaps impossible—to see without being represented graphically.428 For data
values that occur in some complex but predictable pattern, a mathematical model may
reduce a large data set into a single formula. None of these efﬁcient ways of dealing with
large amounts of information is available for document retrieval. Although documents can
be summarized, there is no simple uniformly accepted way of doing this, and any such
summarizing process inevitably reduces the amount of useful information available for
retrieval (imagine how much less information there is in the abstract of a scientiﬁc paper
than there is in the paper itself).
DISTINCTION 9: MANAGEMENT AND THE DELEGATION PROBLEM
Because the typical data search is relatively straightforward, and the procedure of one
search is often very similar to the procedures of other searches, these kinds of searches
can usually be easily delegated to assistants. Without too much fear of misunderstanding,
one person can ask another to get “Eveline Hill’s pay rate,” “The number of widgets in
stock in the Centralia warehouse,” or “The names of customers with backorders of more
than two weeks.” For document retrieval, on the other hand, a request for information may
be interpreted in such a wide variety of ways that delegation is difﬁcult. For example,
when a manager asks her assistant to “Get me any reports that analyze Central European
investment prospects,” there are a lot of different ways that request could be interpreted,
and a variety of information that might satisfy it. For example, is it a request for the
investment records of speciﬁc investors, or is it a request for general investment trends?
Is it a request for historical information combined with present results, or is it a request
for an informed analysis of future prospects? Should the information be broken down
by company, or industry, or by country? Should the information include just economic
information/projections, or should it include an analysis of the political situations and
economic stability of the concerned countries? Should the request only be directed toward
internally done analysis, or should it be targeted towards gathering analysis done by those
outside the organization? Are there free government sources of this kind of information—
in which case, how would you ﬁnd out where they are—or is this information maintained
by commercial information brokers—in which case, how much do you want to pay to get
it? Does the person who wants the information have a strong background in economics
and ﬁnance? If so, the information can be very technical. If not, a more general level of
analysis is needed, etc. This list of variations can be extended indeﬁnitely. The managerial
consequences of this difference are clear: managers can delegate most data searches to
subordinates, but they cannot do so as easily with document searches (unless they have a
high tolerance for misunderstanding or have assistants who understand their information
needs in great detail). If the manager cannot easily delegate a task, what does she do? She
hastodoitherself.Consequently,documentretrievalcanquicklybecomea“blackhole”for

Summary of the Consequences of Indeterminacy in Information Retrieval
time, drawing the manager away from his/her primary duties for signiﬁcant periods. While
data retrieval draws on the duties of lower level employees who carry out the requests of
management, document retrieval tends to draw on the duties of management itself—those
who are most responsible for decision-making in the organization. Document retrieval,
then, can be a two-edged sword. It can assist the manager in getting what she needs for
decision-making, but it may do this by increasing the amount of time she spends away
from her primary duties. This is one of the reasons that document retrieval systems are
perceived with such ambivalence. A good document retrieval system that gets you useful
information quickly is certainly an asset, but one that contains crucial information but is
difﬁcult to use can be a source of frustration and a drain on managerial time.
One of the consequences of the construction of a poorly designed document retrieval
system is that the users quickly learn how difﬁcult it is to get what they want. If the system
contains important information that they need to have access to, they meet this difﬁculty
by forming their own personal document retrieval systems—usually paper-based ones—
thereby duplicating much of the retrieval function and cost. If this happens frequently,
a substantial amount of an organization’s document retrieval cost may be duplicated.
Further, these “personal” information systems are often designed idiosyncratically (since
they have to satisfy only one user) and can be used effectively only by the designer. As
a result, when the person who designed her own document retrieval system leaves her
job or the organization, the knowledge needed to use the system leaves, too (for others
it’s like trying to make sense of another individual’s personal ﬁling system). Further, this
need to create redundant systems is not a one-time effort. The next person to occupy the
vacated position may have to create an entirely new system. This may result in two costs:
the cost of creating a duplicate, personal retrieval system, and the cost of poor information
retrieval while the personal system is being put together.

322
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
Since our only means of retrieving information from an information system is by using
index terms in our search queries, it is easy to see how critical indexes are to the perfor-
mance of an information system. If you can’t anticipate the way that the information you
want is indexed, be it data, text, images or audio, then it is very unlikely that you will be
able to retrieve it, short of sequentially looking at every information item in the collection,
an unworkable strategy for most information systems.
Ifwearetohaveanychanceofreducingtheindeterminacyofcontentindexingitisessential
for us to understand the indexing process. On the most basic level, content indexing is
a process by which we create brief descriptions of the information in question and link
those descriptions logically or physically to that information. What is necessary for search
terms and indexes to work? What do they do? On the face of it, an index term is simply
a word that has a “meaning,” and the “meaning” can, among other things, describe the
intellectual content of the text in question:
Index Term ←→[“Intellectual Content”]429
The exemplars of this relationship are the drawers of 3× 5 cards that used to comprise the
subject catalogue of many libraries. Here an index phrase saying “20th Century Imagist
Poetry” might be afﬁxed to the top of the cards for speciﬁc books in the library. Each
book with this phrase on it would presumably be concerned in whole or in part with
“20th Century Imagist Poetry.” This ostensibly simple basic relationship between index
terms and the intellectual content of text is the kind of linguistic model of language that
Wittgenstein discusses in the opening paragraph of Philosophical Investigations:
When they (my elders) named some object, and accordingly moved towards some-
thing, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was called by the sound they uttered
when they meant to point it out. Their intention was shewn by their bodily move-
ments, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the expression of the face,
the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the tone of
voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting, or avoiding
something. Thus, as I heard words repeatedly used in their proper places in various
sentences, I gradually learnt to understand what objects they signiﬁed; and after I
had trained my mouth to form these signs, I used them to express my own desires.
[PI §1]
These are the words of the medieval philosopher Augustine. They encapsulate an easy
and intuitively attractive theory of language. Wittgenstein describes a more sophisticated
version of this theory which seems to ﬁt the relationship between indexes and intellectual
content particularly well:
These words, it seems to me, give us a particular picture of the essence of human
language. It is this: the individual words in language name objects—sentences are
429An index term can, of course, describe other aspects of information in addition to its “intellectual content.”
An index term may be an author’s name, date of publication, type of information, type of document, type of
image (JPEG, TIFF, GIF), etc. But it is in the representation and retrieval of “intellectual content” that the more
difﬁcult and interesting issues arise. How intellectual content should be represented for retrieval will be the
subject of much of the remainder of this discussion.

323
combinations of such names.—In this picture of language we ﬁnd the roots of the
following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the
word. It is the object for which the word stands.
Augustine does not speak of there being any difference between kinds of word.
If you describe the learning of language in this way you are, I believe, thinking
primarily of nouns like “table,” “chair,” “bread,” and of people’s names, and only
secondarily of the names of certain actions and properties; and of the remaining
kind of words as something that will take care of itself. [PI §1]
This model of language matches very closely to the way that language often appears to
be used in information systems. Speciﬁcally, index terms “stand for” information objects
(“intellectual contents”) in much the way that Augustine describes words as standing
for objects, or, as Wittgenstein reformulated it, words have (“stand for”) meanings. We
discussed Augustine’s model of language brieﬂy in Part I in our exegesis of Wittgenstein’s
Philosophical Investigations. But because of its relevance to how language is used in
information systems it is important to look at the model in more detail, and to bring out
whatever implications or shortcomings it may have. To see the difﬁculties with Augustine’s
model of language and its more subtle descendents, lets enumerate its basic features:
1. Words name objects.
2. The meaning of a word is the object for which it stands,
3. Every word has a meaning.
4. The meaning of a word is independent of context.
5. The meaning of a sentence is composed of the meanings of its words.
6. Teaching consists of pointing to objects and saying their names.
7. Language is primarily used to assert facts.
1. and 2. Words name objects—the meaning of a word is the object for which it stands. If
we consider examples of words such as “chair,” “apple,” and “pencil,” language does seem
to work this way. But if we look at examples such as “rectitude,” “charisma,” and “the day
after tomorrow” it is harder to make the case that words name “objects.” Wittgenstein gives
us a hint of the complexity he sees in these kinds of statements when he asks rhetorically:
A dog believes his master is at the door. But can he also believe his master will
come the day after to-morrow?—And what can he not do here?—How do I do
it?—How am I supposed to answer this? [PI p. 174]
If “the day after to-morrow” were simply a phrase correlated with an object, or “meaning,”
of some kind, it would be plausible that even a dog could understand it and could come
to expect his master then. A dog, after all, can recognize other kinds of objects: balls,
bones, food, leashes, cats, and other dogs, as well as more abstract objects such as friends
and enemies, and characteristic situations like his master coming home soon, playing, or

324
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
being frightened. Further, as Pavlov showed, a dog can “expect” things to happen some
short time in the future, such as getting fed. But can a dog expect his master “the day after
to-morrow?” Wittgenstein does not answer his question explicitly, but it is clear from his
previous writings that he does not believe that a dog can do this. For Wittgenstein, the
“day after to-morrow” isn’t so much a phrase that has a meaning, although we may speak
of it this way, that is, there are Language Games in which we use the word “meaning”
in this way (we can imagine someone who is learning English asking “What does the
’day-after-tomorrow’ mean?”). But for Wittgenstein, as we showed in Part I, if we really
want to understand the “meaning” of the “day after to-morrow” we need to look at its
use. Consequently, to understand the “meaning” of the “day after to-morrow” we need
to be able to use it in the right circumstances, and to use it we need the experiences of
distinguishing one day from another—“today,” “tomorrow,” “the day-after-tomorrow”—of
observing the succession of one day following another, and of using days as units of time in
a variety of activities. And these are not independent activities that can be separated from
our daily lives and practices like we can sometimes separate the “meaning” from a word,
as we do with dictionary entries. To use the “day after to-morrow” correctly is not just
to know a dictionary deﬁnition, it is to be able to discern the appropriate circumstances
and activities in which it can be used, and this ability is further contingent on our ability
to participate in a broad range of human activities in which understanding the “day after
to-morrow” is important. Someone who is learning English and asks me “What does the
’day-after-tomorrow’ mean?” can get along with this simple question because he is already
familiar with the kinds of activities in which such a phrase is used. A dog, though, doesn’t
share with us the activities in which the “day-after-tomorrow” is important. Wittgenstein
brings this out more strikingly with one of his more provocative statements:
If a lion could talk we could not understand him. [PI p. 223]
The reason why we could not understand the speaking lion is because we have no personal
experience with the activities in which he is generally engaged. If we can come to under-
stand the meaning of a word by looking at its use, then meaning is intimately linked to the
activities that we have in common with others. If we don’t have any activities in common,
then there is little that we can talk about. In Wittgenstein’s words, we have too few “forms
of life” in common with the lion on which we could base a common language. Someone
might object that there are activities which we have in common with the lion—activities
like eating, resting, being afraid, or raising children. But, in spite of the superﬁcial sim-
ilarity of these activities, the lion goes about them in such a different manner that they
really are not the same for us both. For example, though the lion must eat regularly, the
way that we do, eating for him is a basic, instinctive, opportunistic activity, while eating
for us is intimately caught up in a complex system of social activities that involve issues
of etiquette, socializing and the culinary arts, none of which has any role in the life of the
lion. Our talking lion might use the word “eat” to refer to the same act as we do, but the
real meaning of the word “eat” with all its connotations and implications would be vastly
different for the lion than it would be for us. If our talking lion were to say that he was
“stepping out for lunch” we could not be certain exactly what he was going to do, and if he
said that he had a “lot of fun yesterday” we would not know at all what he meant. This is
what Wittgenstein means when he says that even if a lion could talk, that is, use the same
words we do, we would not really be able to understand him.

325
After consideration of these examples, which belie the Augustinian Model of Language,
we may try to draw some comfort from the fact that language appears to work according
to Augustine’s Model at least in the cases where objects are referred to. But even here the
relationship between language and “objects” is not simple. “Words” and “objects” recall
the much debated topic of “reference.” Frege, Wittgenstein’s early mentor, was one of
the ﬁrst philosophers to discuss some of the complexities of reference, but these issues
reach back at least to antiquity and Eubulides’ “paradox of the Hooded Man.”430 Frege
highlighted one of the important issues of reference with his example of the “Morning
Star” and the “Evening Star.” Both the Morning Star and the Evening Star refer to the same
celestial object, the planet Venus. Yet the descriptions “Morning Star” and “Evening Star”
do not have precisely the same meaning or “sense” for the simple reason that we cannot
use them interchangeably in everyday discourse. That is, in ordinary usage we cannot say,
in the morning, that we see the “Evening Star” and, in the evening, that we are looking at
the “Morning Star.”
In Frege’s example we could at least tell what the speaker who refers to the “Morning
Star” in the evening, or the “Evening Star” in the morning probably means. But Bertrand
Russell gave us an example of a problem of reference where it is much less clear what the
speaker means. Consider the following two statements:
George the IV wanted to know if Scott was the author of Waverly.
Scott is the author of Waverly.
Now if “Scott” and “the author of Waverly” refer to the same person, and the meaning of a
word is completely explained by its reference, as Augustine claims, then we should be able
to use “Scott” and “the author of Waverly” interchangeably. If we substitute “Scott” for
“the author of Waverly” in Russell’s ﬁrst sentence, then we get: “George the IV wanted to
know if Scott was Scott.” Here, in contrast to Frege’s example, the substitution of “Scott”
for “the author of Waverly” leaves us with a sentence whose intended meaning would be
impossible to ﬁgure out.
It is clear that even when a word or phrase has an obvious reference such as “Scott” and
“the author of Waverly” do, the “meaning,” or what Frege called the “sense,” of that word
or phrase is not limited to the object to which it refers. It is also the case that when we
refer to a particular person we may not mean the person at all, but some salient aspect of
the person. For example, Wittgenstein’s father, Karl, was once referred to as “the Andrew
Carnegie of Austria.” By this, it was not meant that Karl looked like Carnegie, or had
Scottish ancestry, but that he, like Carnegie, was a wealthy industrialist who patronized
the arts. Finally, it is evident that many words, such as “rectitude” and “unicorn” do not
refer to objects at all, yet we still use them regularly and are understood when we do so.
According to Putnam, reference is not established solely by some mental event which links
words to objects, but is “socially ﬁxed.”431 That is, I can refer to, or point out a “chair”
430See foonote 99 in Part II.***
431“. . . reference is socially ﬁxed and not determined by conditions or objects in individual brains/minds.”

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
only under particular circumstances and only to certain kinds of people. For example, for
me to refer to a chair—“This is a chair”—what I refer to must be present and visible. It
can’t be hidden in some way, and there must be enough light for us to see it. Further, the
people I am talking to must speak enough English to understand me, and be old enough to
understand my point in referring to a chair. Pointing out a chair to infants in a dark nursery,
just won’t work. Finally, “chairs” need to be one of those things that people ordinarily refer
to ostensively, they must “ﬁt” into the practice or activity of “pointing things out”—for
example, pointing out a chair as part of a request to move it. Augustine’s model of language
is a simple model and easy to comprehend. But there are some subtle aspects to it which
are not obvious at ﬁrst. In particular, Augustine’s description of how he learned to speak
is important. In his words, he “. . . heard words repeatedly used. . . [and] gradually learnt
to understand what objects they signiﬁed. . . ” [PI §1] This passage makes the point that
we can hear and distinguish words before we understand them. That is, words can exist
for us without meaning—as words we don’t understand. Further, since we can have words
without meaning, it follows that “meaning” can exist independently of words—it appears
to be something that can be added to words by a speciﬁc act such as looking it up in a
dictionary.432 In some instances we can even have a “sense” or “meaning” without a word.
We can see this sometimes when we compare words in two languages. For example, the
Japanese have a word that means the point when a sound, such as the single stroke of a
large bell, has diminished to a level where the listener cannot tell whether he can still hear
it or not. In English, we don’t have a word or simple phrase for this “meaning.” Augustine’s
view of language dichotomizes words and meaning, and sets up a framework in which
they can be considered separately, a framework that exists in various forms to this day:
most prominently, in the belief in the independence of syntax and meaning that was the
cornerstone of Chomsky’s generative grammar.433
This dichotomy between words and meaning forces us to deal with questions of meaning
in a predictable, almost unavoidable, way. Speciﬁcally, when we can no longer maintain
the claim that meaning equals some entity such as a physical “object,” we give up the
physical “object” but we inevitably try to keep the framework in which the “meaning” of
a word is an entity of some kind. We think of a word having a “meaning” in the same
way that we think of people having biological parents. The orphaned child may not know
who his parents are, but their existence at some time is beyond doubt. Wittgenstein, too,
believed in the dichotomization of meaning and words or grammar early in his career.434
But it was one of his major contributions to the philosophy of language to question this
432The separation of “meaning” from words has another unfortunate consequence, namely, when we believe
that “meanings” can be separated from words it is easy to follow this belief into a kind of Platonism where the
“meanings” of words have a kind of separate existence. This is a view that Frege held, and, in a more subtle
version, Russell too.
433As discussed in Part I, this is a view that Wittgenstein held himself in his TLP, but later repudiated particularly
in his rejection of the “calculus model of language” (see the section “Language as a Kind of Calculus” in Part I).
George Lakoff’s early work in linguistics directly challenged this notion of the independence of grammar, or
syntax, and meaning. See his Irregularity in Syntax. The independence of words and meaning lead Frege to
assert that the “meaning”—what he called the “sense”—of a word had actual existence in his own right (***see
Muculloch’s The Mind and its World).
434This was Wittgenstein’s view of meaning in his TLP.

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
327
fundamental dichotomy, in short, to resist the “compulsion” that the Augustinian model
of language seems to force on us.435
Augustine’s model of language reinforced the basic dichotomy between words and mean-
ing, leaving subsequent philosophers the task of trying to get them back together again.
The fact that many words and phrases obviously do not refer to objects, yet are nonethe-
less meaningful, compels us to look for another entity that “meaning” could be. John
Locke was able to articulate an alternative theory of meaning that preserved Augustine’s
separation of words and meaning but did not fall prey to its failures. For Locke:
Words in their primary or immediate signiﬁcation, stand for nothing but the ideas
in the mind of him that uses them.436
Locke’s linking of a word’s signiﬁcation, or “meaning,” with an “idea” resolves the problem
of words that do not refer to an object or type of object, yet are still meaningful. We may
not be able to link all words to objects, but it seems evident to some theorists that when
we know the meaning of the words “rectitude” or “unicorn” we do have something “in
mind.”
Locke’s mentalistic theory of meaning has had a long history of support, and various forms
of it survive today.437 But, as appealing as mentalistic theories of meaning are, they suffer
435Much of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy was directed at questioning this and other dichotomies that have
been of concern to philosophy: dichotomies between “word” and “meaning,” between “inner (mental) states”
and “outer processes,” between “mind” and “body,” and between “mind” and “brain.” He dealt with these
dichotomies in a characteristic way. First, he showed how untenable such dichotomies were. We need both
parts of the dichotomy to work together—the “mind” and the “brain” must work, somehow, in concert, “inner
processes” obviously inﬂuence “outer processes”—but we are confronted with an inﬁnite regress whenever we
try to explain how they work together. Second, he tried to show where the source of these dichotomies comes
from: these dichotomies arose not from empirical observation so much as they arose from distinctions we make
in language. In short, most of the dichotomies which trouble us are chimera, they are grammatical distinctions
which we have mistaken for empirical ones. As Wittgenstein stated, in another context, but no less relevant here:
“We have only rejected the grammar which tries to force itself on us. . . ” [PI §304]
436J. Locke. “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.” See Book III “Of Words.” Quotation from section
3.2.2 in British Empirical Philosophers. Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1985. Edited by A.J. Ayer and
R. Winch. Hilary Putnam places the origin of a mentalistic theory of meaning in the work of Aristotle:
As he was the ﬁrst to theorize in a systematic way about so many other things, so Aristotle
was the ﬁrst thinker to theorize in a systematic way about meaning and reference. In De
Interpretatione he laid out a scheme which has proved remarkably robust. According to this
scheme, when we understand a word or any other “sign,” we associate that word with a
“concept.” This concept determines what the word refers to. Two millennia later, one can ﬁnd
the same theory in John Stuart Mill’s Logic, and in the present century one ﬁnds variants of this
picture in the writings of Bertrand Russell, Gottlob Frege, Rudolph Carnap, and many other
important philosophers. Something like this picture also appears to be built into the English
language. Etymologically, meaning is related to mind. To mean something was probably, in
the oldest usage, just to have it in mind. [H. Putnam. Representation and Reality, p. 19.
MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991.]
437In particular, semiotic theory is often mentalistic, see Umberto Eco’s A Theory of Semiotics, Indiana Uni-
versity Press, Bloomington, Indiana, 1976. This version of semiotics was described and critiqued in Chapter 4 of
Blair’s Language and Representation in Information Retrieval, Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, 1990. Hilary

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
from a number of fatal problems. In the ﬁrst place, if the meaning or sense of a word that I
understand is an idea, then that idea is something private to me. But if meaning is private,
how do I teach you my idea of the meaning of a word, or learn the meaning of a word
which you understand but I do not? We do explain the meaning of words and phrases to
each other, but is this explanation really a presentation of our ideas? If the explanation
we give turns out to be wrong, what is the source of our error? Did we have the right
idea, but explained it incorrectly, or was our original idea incorrect in the ﬁrst place?
There is no way to tell. Yet to teach or learn the meaning of a word or phrase requires
clear criteria of correctness, something a purely mentalistic theory of meaning does not,
and cannot, have. The criterion for whether you understand the meaning of a word is not
whether you have the “right idea,” but whether you use it correctly in your day-to-day
speech and writing. The question of whether you have the “right idea” doesn’t come up in
ordinary usage. Thus, if the criterion for correct understanding is correct usage, then ideas
are not the foundation of our understanding—usage is. This is not to deny that there are
some “mental phenomena” that accompany our language use, it only means that whatever
those “mental phenomena” are they are not relevant to teaching or learning a language.
But a replacement of “ideas” with “usage” has to be done carefully, too. If meaning is
only resolved through a consideration of usage, then we must be careful not to be forced
into the most obvious alternative to mentalism—behaviorism. This too, is a dead end as
an unrestricted source for meaning, as we discussed in the ﬁnal section of Part II. The
problem is not what the deﬁnition of “meaning” is, the problem is the seeming dichotomy
between words and meanings which forces us to see “meaning” as something separate
from the words themselves.
The dichotomy between a word and its meaning is more harmful than helpful in our quest
for understanding how language works. Equating “meaning” with some kind of object
puts us in a position where “meanings” can have some kind of separate existence from
the words that are somehow connected to them. But “meanings” are not separate things
that can be looked at like a geologist looks at rock samples. Meanings are not “things”
but are emergent from our day–to-day activities and practices. They are not simply mental
entities, conscious or unconscious, because they are contingent on the circumstances and
context of their usage; neither are they just behavior because they do have some mental
component (otherwise we would not be able to distinguish between someone who lies but
has the same statements and behavior as someone telling the truth).438
Putnam presents a criticism of current mentalistic theories of meaning in his Representation and Reality, MIT
Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991.
438Wittgenstein’s critique of mentalism comes in two forms. The ﬁrst is his criticism of the “Picture Theory
of Meaning”—a view that he held early in his career. Brieﬂy, pictures, especially mental ones, cannot be the
unequivocal foundation for meaning in language because pictures can be interpreted in any number of ways (see
the examples in the previous section “Wittgenstein at Work: Philosophical Investigations”).
Wittgenstein’s second criticism of mentalism is his well-known argument against a private language. Brieﬂy, the
issue of a private language concerns whether or not we can have meanings in language that only we can know.
For example, private language advocates claim that although we all have a sense of what the word “pain” means,
and can use it appropriately in ordinary discourse, in reality our notion of “pain” is based on our own experiences
of “pain” and these personal experiences are unique and private. Wittgenstein’s rejoinder to this is two-fold: in
the ﬁrst place, private meanings cannot be uniquely private since in order to discuss, describe, or compare them
we must use our ordinary, public language. If we can only describe the private language using language that is
public, then our private language is just a particular kind of public, that is, ordinary, language. As Wittgenstein

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information

3. Every word has a meaning. If the “meaning” of a word is the object, actual or mental, for
which it stands, this implies that the “meaning” is a clearly deﬁned entity—a single thing.
Again, if we think of tangible objects—chairs, cars, hammers, etc.—this view has a certain
appeal. But on closer examination we can see that even the deﬁnitions of common objects
can have cases where their application is indeterminate. Those who think that a chair is
simply a chair, should go to a museum of contemporary art. Here, what an artist may
call a chair can vary widely from our accepted notion of what it is. But even in ordinary
usage, what we might call a chair can deviate from our normal expectations. A chair has
a function, it is something to sit on. Such a function can give the status of “chair” to a lot
of objects. For example, if we need to sit down, but there are no ordinary chairs available,
we might use a low table or a box to sit on. In a functional sense, the low table or box
becomes a chair for the period of time we use it for this purpose. Some may quibble that
using something as a chair does not change the general deﬁnition of what a chair is, but
arguments can be made on both sides of the issue. What is important is that the deﬁnition
of what an ordinary object like a chair is can vary a lot and, like the “heap” in sorites, the
boundary between what is a chair and what is not a chair may be unclear and may vary
according to circumstances. In like manner, we can view a hammer as a speciﬁc kind of
tool with a characteristic shape and heft, but we can also view a hammer as something
that can be used in certain ways. In the functional sense, a lot of things can be used as
hammers: rocks, iron bars, hatchets, even ﬁsts.
The words “hammer” and “chair” can also be used metaphorically, such as when the
weatherman says that a storm “hammered Cape Cod” or when a reporter states that Senator
X “chaired the Armed Services Committee.” In other uses, some professional athletes and
at least one popular singer have the nickname “hammer.” These metaphorical uses of these
words stretch our notion of what these words mean and where it is appropriate to use them.
Some names of objects ﬁnd a wide variety of applications. We discussed before the many
disparate uses or meanings of the word “head,” but it is easy to come up with other examples
of words with many acceptable uses. Consider the word “line”:
“He took a pencil and drew a line.”
“The soldiers stood in line.”
put it, “What goes on within also has meaning only in the stream of life.” [RPP II §687]
Wittgenstein’s second criticism of private language has to do with how we determine correct usage. If we want
to know how to use a word then we need to have some exemplary cases of the word’s usage—what Wittgenstein
called “¨ubersichtliche Darstellungen”—which we can look to as examples of how to use it. But since, in a private
language, any such exemplary uses of a word are also private, how would we know whether the exemplary cases
we have are actually correct or whether we have used the exemplary cases appropriately to establish correct
usage? What is private to us cannot be compared to other private entities in the way that we compare things in
our daily activities—for example, comparing samples of shades of a color to see which are alike. This notion of
the incomparability of private phenomena is one of the cornerstones of Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mind.
Through all of this Wittgenstein is not saying that we have no mental process, conscious or unconscious, that is
part of our correct use of language. He just says that any such mental process is neither necessary nor deﬁnitional.
In his words, “It is not a something, but not a nothing either!” (see Part II section “ Wittgenstein vs. Behaviorism:
The Existence of Mental Phenomena”)

330
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
“He put his reputation on the line.”
“Give me the bottom line on the investment.”
“The batter lined out to third.”
“I can’t follow his line of thought.”
“The coat was lined with down.”
“Don’t give me that old line!”
“The actor forgot his lines.”
“The ocean liner weighed anchor and put out to sea.”
“The ﬁshing line was hopelessly tangled.”
“The store carried a line of small tools.”
“His actions were completely out of line.”
“Drop me a line when you get there.”
“Make him toe the line!”
Such examples do not exhaust the different uses of the word “line” and this variability
is typical of many other common words. Examples like these should disabuse us of any
notion that word meaning is a precise or single thing. Hilary Putnam goes even farther.
He shows that even when we agree on the meaning, or usage, of a particular word we
still may not all have the same criteria for its use. Meaning, he proposes, is subject to
a kind of “Division of Linguistic Labor.” By Putnam’s account, even when we agree on
the “meaning of a word” we may not be using identical criteria for its application. Take
the word “elm,” I may recognize an elm tree by the general size and shape of its serrated
leaf, while my friend may recognize elms just as reliably as I do by looking at the shape
of the mature tree, the appearance of the bark and the size of the leaf buds. An expert
botanist might be able to identify an elm by the particular cell structure of the wood
which she can see under a microscope.439 Putnam’s point is that the ability to use a word,
here, “elm,” in the same way does not guarantee that the users possess the same criteria
for the word’s usage. Language, according to Putnam, is a co-operative activity. We may
have useful heuristics that help us to identify things like elms, but no one, not even the
expert, can identify things like elms in every possible circumstance (e.g., a botanist would
probably not be able to identify an elm in complete darkness, but a blind person may
have sensitive enough touch to do so by handling the bark and leaves). To distinguish an
elm from trees that it looks very much like, or in the winter when it has no leaves, we
would probably rely on expert botanists or on a tree-identiﬁcation guide. But if we know
very little about elms, we may just rely on our neighbor to help us identify them. This is
what Putnam means by the “Division of Linguistic Labor.” The expert, though, does not
know a “more complete” deﬁnition of “elm” than we do, he simply knows more about
elms than we do, and this additional information about elms may be useful for identifying
elms in different circumstances—that is, the expert can use the word “elm” in a wider
variety of circumstances than the average person can. But this additional information is
not part of the meaning of the word “elm.” Wittgenstein would say that what accounts
for the different criteria that we have, even when we can each identify elms reliably, is
that we use the word “elm” in different language games. We only need the criteria to
identify elms in the language games, that is, the particular uses, that concern us. If we
439I have no idea whether cell-structure can be used to identify trees. My point is that the expert may have
different criteria for identifying elms than non-experts, like myself, have.

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
331
are not botanists we may only want to identify the elms which we see in our own yard or
neighborhood. The ability to distinguish species of elms, for example those that grow in
the southern latitudes from those that grow in northern latitudes, may not be important
to us. For some botanists, distinguishing various species of elm may be important, but
understanding the cell structure of elm wood may not be important. For a botanist at a
tree farm, understanding the different cell structures of elm species may be important, but
understanding how to identify elms in the wild may be unimportant. And for a botany
student studying for an exam, he may need only to be able to write down the scientiﬁc
deﬁnition of an “elm” which might include its Latin name and its correct genus. Some
of these language games may pick out the same trees as elms, and some may not. There
is no sense of a “complete” deﬁnition of an “elm” that would enable us to pick out elms
in all conceivable circumstances. It also should be clear that there is no language game
that would require such an all-inclusive understanding of what an elm is. The criterion
for whether an individual knows the meaning of a word like “elm” is not whether he has
some arbitrarily “complete” deﬁnition of an elm, but whether he can use the word “elm”
correctly in the language games in which he wishes to participate. A language game, as
we pointed out in Part II, is not just a particular set of regularities in language but also
includes the activities or practices in which it is normally used—as Wittgenstein put it:
I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is
woven, the “language-game.” [PI §7]
4. The meaning of a word is independent of context. Much of Part II of this manuscript
was a discussion of the importance of context for meaning, so these discussions will not
be repeated here (in particular, see the sections “Wittgenstein at Work” and “Language
Games” in Part I). A couple of clear examples can serve to remind us of the importance
of context.
Indexicals are good examples of strongly context-dependent words: words like “here,”
“now,” “this,” “that,” “him,” “her,” and “it.” The references these words make change from
context to context and speaker to speaker. These examples are fairly obvious, but there are
other examples that are more subtle and deal with aspects of context beyond the notion
of physical presence or absence. Consider the example, “I am here.” This sentence has
the indexicals “I” and “here” and these would be clariﬁed by ascertaining who spoke the
sentence and on what occasion. But if you are sitting before me and are perfectly visible,
and you utter “I am here” you probably mean something else entirely than the simple
statement of where you are. That is, it is obvious to me that you are here, so you must
be trying to tell me something else. One can imagine a situation in which one person
is distraught over something and the other, a close friend or relative, goes to him and,
patting him on the shoulder, says, “Don’t worry, I am here,” meaning, of course, not
just that the speaker is physically present, but that the speaker is emotionally supportive.
In this utterance the context needed to interpret the meaning of the sentence extends
beyond the simple notion of physical presence and includes the relationship between the
two individuals and the particular circumstances in which they ﬁnd themselves. Context
can often indicate which of the many meanings of a word is currently being used. For
example, the word “pitch” can mean a lot of things: the slope of a roof, the tone of voice, a
speciﬁc action in a baseball game, a tar-based substance, the description of a product that

a salesman gives his customer, etc. But if two individuals are talking while they attend a
baseball game and use the word “pitch” it is highly unlikely that it means anything other
than a speciﬁc action in the game.
5. The meaning of a sentence is composed of the meanings of its words. If “meanings” are
entities that are attached somehow to words, then it is no great intellectual leap to conclude
that sentence meaning is somehow put together from the meanings of the words. If this is
the case, then, most fundamentally, to understand the meaning of a sentence means that we
must be aware of all the words in a sentence. Yet there is ample empirical evidence that, at
least with speech, we often do not hear every word in a sentence. For example, suppose that
you walk into a fast food restaurant and go up to the counter to order what you want. As
you come up to the counter, a clerk approaches you and quickly says, “Kelp ya?” In spite
of the fact that the clerk, strictly speaking, has not said any English words, we generally
understand him to say, “Can I help you?”—a phrase we do understand. President Franklin
Roosevelt would often dispel the boredom of a long receiving line before a White House
dinner by saying completely inappropriate things to the guests as he greeted them, his
favorite greeting being “I murdered my grandmother this morning.” The guests, of course,
would assume that the President had greeted them in a cordial and expected manner, and
that even if they heard exactly what he said they would assume that they had misunderstood
him.440 In cases like these, it is clear that we understand the situation or circumstances
before we understand what is said to us, and our expectations about what is likely to be
said may override and supersede what is actually said. Thus, sentence meaning, in these
examples, is not built up out of word meanings for the simple reason that we often do not
hear the words in the sentence, or we hear them but the circumstances are so strong that
we assume something else was said.
But what about cases where we do hear all the words in a sentence. Are there ever cases
that the meaning of a sentence seems to have little to do with the individual meanings
of the words? Yes there are. Consider the following example. I come into my ofﬁce in
the morning, and after greeting a colleague I ask her, “Is Bill back from vacation yet?”
She answers, in a perfectly forthright manner, “I saw a yellow Volkswagon in the parking
lot this morning.” What did she mean? It is not difﬁcult to see that she is saying that she
believes Bill is back from vacation—that is, that Bill owns a yellow VW, that a yellow
VW is an unusual appearing car so Bill probably has the only one, and if Bill is back from
vacation he will have likely driven his car in to the ofﬁce and parked it where it can be seen
by others, etc. But no matter how extended and detailed a description of the meanings of
“saw,” “yellow,” “Volkswagen,” “parking lot,” etc., are, there is no way that we can derive
the meaning my colleague intended soley from the meanings of her words.
6. Teaching consists of pointing to objects and saying their names. If meaning is not an
object then we cannot “point” to it, either literally or ﬁguratively. This is not to say that we
cannot convey the meaning of some words by pointing to an object, for we can certainly
do this (Wittgenstein: “. . . the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to
its bearer” [PI §43] ). But this is just a special case in language learning and is not the
only way, nor even the most common way, that we learn what words mean. Further, even

the simple act of pointing to an object to explain the meaning of a word is not the simple
act that Augustine makes it out to be. If someone points to an automobile in response to
a question about what a particular word means, what is it exactly that is being pointed to?
One cannot state unequivocably that it was the car that was being pointed out. It could
be that the car was pointed to as an example of a particularcolor; or, as an example of
a particularbrand of car (e.g. a Ford); or, as an example of a particularkind of car (e.g.
a sedan); or, as a particular person’s car. (Wittgenstein: “an ostensive deﬁnition can be
variously interpreted in every case” [PI §28] ) It is interesting to note that even when we
point to something to demonstrate what a word means, such as pointing to a chair when
someone who is learning English asks us what “chair” means, the chair itself is not the
meaning of the word “chair.” The chair that we point to is a single entity, yet when we
deﬁne the word “chair” by pointing to a chair we are indicating not a single thing but a type
of object. As a consequence, even when we point at an object to explain the meaning of a
word, we are not really pointing just to that single object, but indicating a type of object,
so it is the type of object that is the meaning of the word, not the object itself. While we can
point to an object in explaining the meaning of a word, we cannot point to a type of object.
The person learning English who asks us what “chair” means must understand this; he
must understand the Language Game of pointing things out to explain the meaning of a
word. In other words, he must understand a lot about how language works before even
the simple act of ostensive deﬁnition will make sense. Consequently, ostensive deﬁnition
cannot be the foundation of language understanding as Augustine implies it is because
one must have a clear grasp of how language works before ostensive deﬁnition can be
understood. As Wittgenstein put it, succinctly:
. . . the ostensive deﬁnition explains the use—the meaning—of the word when the
overall role of the word in language is clear. [PI §30]
Wittgenstein scholar P.M.S. Hacker summarizes Wittgenstein’s position on this issue:
The meaning of a word is not an object in reality. It is not an abstract object (a
Fregean “sense”) which, by means of an ethereal mechanism, determines an entity
in reality as its reference. Nor is it a psychological object (an idea in the mind) which
resembles an entity or possible entity in reality. Rather it is, or is determined by, the
use of the word, and it is given by an explanation of meaning, which is a rule for
the use of that word. Ostensive deﬁnition, which appears to connect the network of
language to reality, actually connects a word with a sample, which itself belongs to
the method of representation and is an instrument of the language, not something
represented by the ostensive deﬁnition. So language remains self-contained and
autonomous. Of course, this does not mean that we do not refer to objects in the
world by our uses of language, that we are not really talking about a language-
independent reality. However, the intentionality of language is attributable not to
connections between words and world, but to intra-grammatical connections, to
explanations of meaning and of what we mean by the words we utter.441
7. Language is primarily used to assert facts. Early in his philosophical career, Wittgen-
stein also believed that the primary purpose of language was to make assertions about facts.

But this is one idea about language that he quite clearly revised (note Wittgenstein’s refer-
ence to “the author of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus” at the end of the following
quotation):
But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and comm-
and?—There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call
“symbols,” “words,” “sentences.” And this multiplicity is not something ﬁxed, given
once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come
into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough
picture of this from the changes in mathematics.)
Here the term “language-game” is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the
speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.

What Do Inquirers Want?
Traditionally, searchers have been thought to be retrieving information on speciﬁc top-
ics or subjects; libraries and many Internet “portals” are arranged this way. Yahoo
(www.yahoo.com) and the Library of Congress are the exemplars of this class of informa-
tion system, developing and maintaining thousands of hierarchically arranged categories
and linking them to existing information. Classifying information sources by subject has
become such a compelling design for Internet searching that many of the search engines
that began as just search engines have added subject access to websites, too, making them
more like Yahoo. But as compelling as subject access is as a paradigm for searching, it
is usually not what searchers are really looking for. More often than not, what prompts

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
335
a search for information is not so much a lack of information on a particular subject,
but the obstruction of an activity that the searcher wants to begin or continue. It may be
that information on a particular topic will help a searcher continue an activity that has
been impeded in some way, but it is rare that any information on that topic will do this.
Consequently, the primary goal of most searching is to ﬁnd something that will enable the
searcher to continue the impeded activity.442 Let’s consider a few examples:
1. An investor searching for stock information. In this situation, the searcher is look-
ing for information that will tell him how good his existing investments are, or
whether there are present investment opportunities that he could take advantage
of. Naturally, he could probably ﬁnd pertinent information under the general topic
of “investing,” so it is tempting to say that he is looking for information on that
subject. But if we look at the activity of investing, we can see a number of in-
teresting aspects of it. In the ﬁrst place, the searcher will probably not make an
investment or change an existing investment without good reason to do so. In this
sense, his activity of investing has been impeded or at least slowed, pending some
information that would justify his doing something.
It is also the case that not every item of information under the topic “investing”
will be useful to the searcher. He may have very speciﬁc needs as far as what types
of investments he is interested in and the level of detail or technicality in which
the information is written. The principal criterion, then, is not just what topic the
information is on but whether the information is useful to him, that is, does it help
him further his investing activity? Topicality is a good starting point, but may not
be precise enough to lead him to exactly what will be useful for him. Interestingly,
it may be the case that information that is not on the topic of “investing” will be the
most useful information that he ﬁnds. Useful information could take the form of
economic forcasts which predict slowdowns in the industries in which our searcher
is invested, dictating that he should move his investments to a more promising eco-
nomic sector. He might also ﬁnd a statement from the Federal Reserve announcing
interest rate increases, thus making investments in bonds or money markets more
attractive than his stocks. Neither of these items of information is, strictly speaking,
on the topic of “investing.”
2. An inventor searching to see if his invention has already been patented. Here, of
course, the searcher is primarily looking for information that concerns the type
of invention he has made, probably a very narrowly deﬁned topic. A successful,
though disappointing, conclusion to the search would occur if he ﬁnds that an
invention like his has already been patented. But there is another kind of conclusion
to his search, namely, his not being able to ﬁnd patents for inventions like his.
Here, the success of the search comes not with the acquisition of information
about patents for inventions similar to his, but with the convincing absence of such
information. In other words, the successful conclusion of the search has occurred
because no information on that topic could be found. The inventor is now free to
442D.C. Blair. Pragmatic Aspects of Inquiry, Doctoral dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, 1981.

336
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
continue his application for a patent for his invention, something he could not do
until he could not ﬁnd the information he was searching for.443
3. An academic researcher searching for information to support a research project
(a grant, dissertation, or scholarly publication). While academic research is often
considered the exemplar of subject searching—“knowing more and more about
less and less” as the saying goes—the researchers who are at the forefront of their
respective ﬁelds are often engaged not so much in searching a topic as they are
engaged in creating a topic, or at least re-deﬁning it. Research is, by deﬁnition,
working on something that has not been done before. Since the researcher is, in
some sense, creating or modifying a topic, the information that she ﬁnds relevant to
this endeavor can be unpredictably varied and may change from search to search.
One aspect of research is that it tends to be frequently associated with speciﬁc
individuals, institutions or journals. Often a searcher will use a topic search to
get her into the general intellectual area with which she is concerned. Once she
gains access to her ﬁeld of interest she then combs through the ﬁeld’s literature
for the names of individuals, institutions and journals that deal with what she
is interested in. These names can become the focus of her subsequent searches.
Citations and bibliographic references can also become important access points to
research literature, for example, when the searcher ﬁnds a paper that she considers
useful, some of the papers that are cited by that paper are likely to be useful, too.
It is also the case that papers that subsequently cite the useful paper may be of use,
too (these can be found in the Science or Social Science Citation Indexes). The
strategy of using citations to ﬁnd related information comes from an understanding
of how the activities of research and writing about research are done. Here we can
see how closely dependent search strategy can be on understanding how the activity
(research and publication) uses that kind of information. This is why the citation
indexes are so popular among researchers.
4. A biologist looking for information on a speciﬁc species of plant or animal. Bio-
logical nomenclature is certainly one of the most precise classiﬁcations of infor-
mation, and searching its categories is probably the closest searching comes to a
pure subject search. It is usually the case, though, that a searcher in a biological
ﬁeld would not ﬁnd everything in a particular classiﬁcation useful for his purposes.
But it is also the case that whatever he does ﬁnd useful is often within a single
established category.444 Biological classiﬁcations have one characteristic, though,
443It is tempting to think that if the goal of the search is topic “A” then the conclusion of the search can be arrived
at by ﬁnding “¬A.” But ﬁnding that a topic does not exist is a very different sort of search than ﬁnding that it does
exist. In order for the inventor to convince the patent ofﬁce that “A” (the speciﬁc category for his invention) does
not exist, he must either search all existing invention categories and not ﬁnd it, or marshal evidence to support
this assertion that “A” does not exist. Since it is unlikely that he can search all existing invention categories, there
being too many even in narrowly-deﬁned ﬁelds, he must then gather evidence for the category’s nonexistence.
This is, in part, a semantic notion (what kind of invention is it, that is, what does the category mean?), in part a
logical notion (what categories are logically equivalent to the negation of topic “A?”), and in part a legal notion
(what counts as evidence that topic “A” does not exist?).
444The ﬁeld of biological classiﬁcation is not without its differences of opinion, and competing methodologies.
New methods like “cladistics” can produce classiﬁcations that compete with more traditional classiﬁcations,

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
337
that most other classiﬁcation schemes do not: the classiﬁcation scheme and how
it is applied to ﬂora and fauna is part of an established practice. The establish-
ment, maintenance and understanding of the relevant classiﬁcation scheme itself
is part of the practice of being a biologist. It is also the case that the classiﬁca-
tion scheme marks the boundaries of what the biologist does: she is an expert on
furbish louseworts, he works on the life-cycle of snail darters, they study the mi-
gration patterns of whooping cranes. Having the classiﬁcation scheme so closely
allied with the practice of being a biologist links it closely to what biologists do,
making it more likely that biological classiﬁcations would distinguish useful in-
formation from the less useful or useless information. The classiﬁcation system is
also, in a sense, normative: an entity that has all the characteristics of one partic-
ular species must be classiﬁed as that species, and information about that entity
must be classiﬁed in that species’ category. We might hypothesize that the best
candidates for pure subject searches are those that operate within a normative
classiﬁcation scheme, though even normative classiﬁcation schemes can suffer
from category overload, and normative schemes themselves are probably the most
labor-intensive categorization mechanisms to use since they require their construc-
tion, support and maintenance to be carried out by many of the individuals who
would use them, and, in the ﬁnal analysis, the taxonomy must be agreed upon
by the majority of practitioners (as Putnam pointed out, reference is “socially
ﬁxed.”).
From these brief examples we can draw a number of conclusions: because the searcher
often wants information that will enable him to begin an activity, or restart an activity that
has been blocked in some way, we can say that what he is searching for is not so much
information on a topic as it is information that he can apply to some purpose—information
he can use. This can be true even when a searcher is looking explicitly for information on
a particular topic. Topics, then, are usually not the primary goal of a search, but are more
like heuristics that might get the searcher into the general area where there might be useful
information. From this point, the searcher can use a variety of criteria to identify other,
possibly useful information—authors’ names, publication titles, time periods, publishing
institutions, types of publication, citation references, recommendations of colleagues,
literal occurrences of speciﬁc words, such as names, in the text of candidate documents,
etc. In short, the early part of most content searches is not so much looking for the right
information as it is looking for the right questions to base the search on (i.e., which subject
terms, author names, journal names, or names of research institutions, are the best ones
to base the search on?).
To represent the content of information, we must understand what it means, and to under-
stand what it means we need to know how it is used. Since words in a sentence can be seen
to have meaning, we think that they have meanings that they carry with them. In the same
sense, we think that information has a meaning apart from its use. But neither words nor
information really has determinate meaning apart from their usage.
and established classiﬁcations rarely survive indeﬁnitely without some alteration. (See the website “What is
Cladistics?” by L. M. Clos—www.fossilnews.com/1996/cladistics.html)

338
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
If it is true that a searcher is primarily interested in the use to which the information
he ﬁnds can be put, then why don’t we have classiﬁcation schemes that emphasize the
utility of information rather than its subject? There are some instances of classiﬁcations of
information based on utility, many government publications have this kind of orientation,
technical manuals and publications are categorized this way, and military publications are
often speciﬁcally classiﬁed according to what kind of activity or skill they support. But
the vast majority of publications are not classiﬁed according to their use but according to
their perceived subject.
There are a number of reasons why information classiﬁcations are oriented more towards
subjects and less towards utility. In the ﬁrst place, while a unit of information might have a
few subjects with which it may be reasonably associated, there are often a number of uses
to which that information can be put. Identifying the possible uses for speciﬁc information,
outside of a particular practice, can be difﬁcult. But there is a more compelling reason
for the dominance of subject description over utility in classiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, the
classiﬁcation process, whether automatic or human-based begins, and usually ends, with
an examination of the information that is to be classiﬁed. From this information it is
usually possible to get some idea of its subject, but it may be very difﬁcult to get a sense
of how that information might be used. The subject of information is a characteristic of
individual information items, but its utility is more of a system-concept, a broader and more
contextual notion of information. It must include not just a sense of what the information
is about, but must also include some sense of how it may serve the skills and practices of
those who use the information system. Such meta-information cannot usually be inferred
from just the text of a document.
You can make a guess at a subject by reading a document text, but you cannot understand
how it may be used without understanding the pragmatic context—the scaffolding and
practices it’s used in—of the publication. The primary reason subject searches are not
precise descriptions of what the search is about is that it is almost never the case that
everything on a subject will satisfy the searcher.
If we assume Andy Clark’s perspective (vide supra) and look at information systems from
a “scaffolding” point of view, we can see their relation to utility more clearly. That is, as
part of our intellectual scaffolding, an information system is really an extension of our
memories, storing information that would be difﬁcult, if not impossible, to remember. But
if we look at our own memories, we see that what we typically remember is not usually
random bits of information, but things that are useful for us. If our memory is utility-
oriented, then it makes sense for our information systems, as intellectual scaffolding, to
be utility-oriented too.
Information Systems—A Wittgensteinean View
I am sitting with a philosopher in the garden; he says again and again “I know that
that’s a tree,” pointing to a tree that is near us. Someone else arrives and hears this,
and I tell him: “This fellow isn’t insane. We are only doing philosophy.” [OC §467]
What’s the point of bringing philosophy into this discussion? If we have identiﬁed the
determinacy of representation as a major factor in the retrieval of intellectual content, and
that this is a property of language, then philosophy gives us some idea of the depth of

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
339
this issue. What it shows us is that the indeterminacy of representation is not a superﬁcial
issue in language that can be easily eliminated with “clearer” or “more precise” descrip-
tions. As Wittgenstein showed us, the meaning of language is not a property of individual
words, but is intimately bound up in its use. Likewise, the meaning and determinacy of the
descriptions of information are not properties of the descriptions themselves, but are con-
tingent on how they are used. It shows that the determinacy of representation is a deep and
complex aspect of language that cannot be clariﬁed without reference to the context and
circumstancesofitsusage.Ininformationsystems,otherthanthemoredeterminatedatare-
trieval systems, indeterminacy will be an essential characteristic of many content retrieval
efforts, and will not lend itself to solution by Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Natural Language
Processing, or any other techniques that do not/cannot understand language meaning as
an emergent phenomenon arising from the day-to-day interactions of individuals engaged
in their fundamental activities and practices. Indeterminacy cannot be “squeezed out” of
language—there is no underlying logical clarity of meaning that we just need to uncover, as
Frege and Russell thought. If indeterminacy is something that we are going to have to live
with in content retrieval, then we need to understand what the consequences of it are for in-
formation system design and use. If we cannot eliminate indeterminacy in a lot of retrieval
situations, then we need to investigate ways of mitigating it when it interferes with effec-
tive retrieval. We have discussed the consequences of indeterminacy in content retrieval,
and we will look at some of the ways to mitigate this indeterminacy shortly. First, though,
let’s look at the problem of indeterminate retrieval from a Wittgensteinean point of view.
The “Meaning” of a Document
Information systems are fundamentally linguistic processes. At the very least a searcher
must describe the intellectual content he would like to ﬁnd, and these descriptions must be
matched against the descriptions of the content of available information (these descriptions
of available information can come from a variety of sources: manual indexing, computer-
assisted indexing, automatic indexing, or full-text retrieval). Looking at the linguistic
nature of information, it is natural to see items of information, documents, databases,
images, etc. as meaning something. This is implicit in the idea of information having
“intellectual content.” But just as Wittgenstein admonished us not to look for the meaning
of a word, but to let the use teach us the meaning, we can also say that documents or other
items of information don’t having meanings so much as they have uses—that is, we should
let the use of information “teach us the meaning.”
What are the “Diseases of Thinking” in Information Retrieval?
Wittgenstein believed, as we have shown, that many of the problems that philosophers
had solving traditional philosophical problems were not a result of the intractability of the
problems but resulted from a ﬂawed way of thinking about them—his most salient example
is, of course, that asking for the “meaning” of a word can lead our analysis of language
in an unproductive direction. If we take a Wittgensteinean view of Information Retrieval,
then we need to ask ﬁrst whether there are any “Diseases of Thinking” in analyzing the less
determinate activity of content retrieval, that is, are there ways of looking at the problems
of indeterminate content retrieval that militate against the solution or mitigation of these
problems. There are.

340
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
a.
The Data Model is an effective model for all Information Systems, regardless
of what kind of information is managed by the system. This assumption is
the one that causes the most trouble in information retrieval design. It is not a
“stupid” assumption, it merely overlooks the fact that the enormous success of
the Data Model when managing determinate information is a kind of success that
is strictly limited by the kind of information it provides access to. The attempt
to apply the Data Model to all kinds of information systems is a lot like the
attempt by some philosophers to apply the formal logical model of language,
which is similarly bounded, to all questions of language meaning. This, of course,
is precisely the “disease of thinking” that Wittgenstein spent his later life arguing
against. The success of the Data Model of determinate retrieval has made this
view very attractive and has lead to a number of other “Diseases of Thinking” in
Information Retrieval:
b. Information Content representation can be exact and unambiguous. It’s easy
to assume that the determinacy of representation in the Data Model is a realistic
goal for representing less determinate content for retrieval. But for a goal to be
productive, it must be a realistic one, and as Wittgenstein showed us in detail,
indeterminacy is not something that can be squeezed out of language by more
rational or logical efforts. The belief that the representation of information content
is potentially determinate leads to the erroneous assumption that content retrieval
failures are the results of poor searching techniques. This, in fact, is exactly the
rationale that IBM responded with when it was ﬁrst confronted with the results of
the STAIRS evaluation. The unacceptably low recall values, they claimed, were
a product of lousy searching techniques (this explanation was not published, but
was communicated to the company that sponsored the STAIRS study). This ex-
planation overlooks a number of aspects of language that we have discussed here,
in particular, that language is “productive” and that there are an unlimited number
of ways that a particular intellectual content can be represented linguistically. By
advocating that full-text retrieval was perfectly suited to the retrieval of precise
content from a large system of related information, STAIRS forced the searchers
into a position where it was impossible not to have poor searching techniques. To
blame the searchers for the failures of the system was like, as M.E. Maron pointed
out, a company selling someone a combination lock without giving them the com-
bination, and when the customer asks for the combination the company replies that
ﬁnding the combination is the customer’s responsibility, not theirs. Now, although
we have showed how pervasive indeterminacy in language is, and how severely
it can affect content retrieval, it is important that we should not simply give up,
believing there is no way to retrieve precise information from any content retrieval
system. Just as Wittgenstein showed that there were deﬁnite nonlogical ways to
resolve ambiguities in meaning, we will discuss shortly a number of non-Data
Model strategies for mitigating the affects of indeterminacy in content retrieval.
c.
Improvements in Physical Access speed will improve Intellectual Access to
information content. This is another consequence of the belief that the Data
Model works well for all kinds of retrieval. For very deterministic data retrieval,
as we discussed, if you speed up the physical access speed of the system, it will

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
341
speed up intellectual access too, that is, it will get you faster to the information you
want. Again, this only works for highly determinate retrieval where given a typical
query it is clear exactly what information will satisfy it. To recall our analogy for
this issue, a physically faster race car will enable the racer to get to the ﬁnish faster,
but a physically faster delivery truck doesn’t necessarily speed up delivery over a
slower truck.
d. Size doesn’t matter. Large retrieval systems work just as well as smaller sys-
tems. For the determinate data retrieval model, as we pointed out, making a system
larger does not typically reduce retrieval effectiveness. But with the less determi-
nate content retrieval model, as the system gets larger the indeterminacy multi-
plies making it increasingly difﬁcult to conduct successful speciﬁc or exhaustive
searches. The indeterminacy of content representation has two principal effects:
First, and most obviously, it may be very difﬁcult for a searcher to anticipate how a
particular information content is represented in a large system containing similar
information. This can lead to the situation where the searcher cannot retrieve the
information content that she wants. But there is another less obvious aspect of the
indeterminacy of content representation, namely, that even when the searcher cor-
rectly anticipates how the information content she wants is represented, because of
the indeterminacy of representation, there may be many other information contents
that she doesn’t want that are represented the same way. On large content retrieval
systems this leads to the situation where the searcher retrieves a great deal of
unwanted information, and this unwanted information may hide the retrieval of
the desired information if the number of desired documents is small and the total
number of retrieved documents is above the searcher’s futility point. This belief
that large less determinate retrieval systems work as well as small systems leads
to a related “Disease of Thinking”:
i. Information systems should be as comprehensive as possible: A bigger in-
formation system is always a better information system. As the cost of the
storage of information has dropped dramatically in recent years, organizations
have gotten to the point where they need not throw away any of the documents
they have gathered or written. In fact, for many organizations, it may cost them
more to look at the information they have collected and decide which of it to
keep, than it costs to simply keep it. By keeping everything, it appears that the
organization is saving money and building a better more comprehensive infor-
mation system, but if they are keeping increasing amounts of indeterminately
represented information content, the “cost” of successful retrieval will go up
signiﬁcantly since it will be increasingly difﬁcult for searchers to search through
the growing body of existing information for what they want or need.
e.
Everything that we need to know in order to determine how to represent the
intellectual content of a document is contained within the document itself.
Wittgenstein’s predecessor Gottlob Frege claimed that the meaning of a sentence
is composed of the meanings of its words. In his view, the meaning of a sen-
tence cannot be something other than a composite of the meanings of its words.
Wittgenstein disagreed strongly with this view, especially since it implied a kind

of semantic “reduction” of sentence meaning to a combination of individual word
meanings. It is easy to come up with an example where the meaning of a sentence
is something other than an aggregate of the meanings of its words. Consider again
the example of when I come into my ofﬁce and ask a colleague whether Bill has
returned from vacation yet. My colleague replies “I saw a yellow Volkswagen in the
parking lot.” Clearly, my colleague is telling me that she thinks Bill has returned
from his vacation, since he has a comparatively uncommon yellow Volkswagen,
and she saw it in the parking lot today. Thus the actual “meaning” of the sentence
“I saw a yellow Volkswagen in the parking lot” is clearly “Yes, Bill has returned
from vacation.” But there is no way that you could derive the actual meaning of
the sentence my colleague utters by looking only at the words in that sentence.
As Wittgenstein showed us, to understand the meaning of the sentence we have to
understand the circumstances in which it was uttered, and the background of the
person who uttered it. Just as a sentence can be something more than the com-
bination of the meanings of its words, the determination of how to represent the
intellectual content of a document may require an understanding of more than the
words in the text of the document.
This particular bias in the way that content searching for documents is seen is
implicit in the belief that full-text searching will work for precise searches on
large-scale information retrieval systems. That is, if everything you need to know
about how a document is to be represented or understood is in the text of the
document, what else could you possibly need to represent the document but the
text itself? But it was clear from the STAIRS evaluation that what was in the
documents was clearly not enough to support precise retrieval on a large system.
f.
The only thing that a searcher is actively looking for is the information that
he desires. Again, the distinction between determinate and indeterminate search-
ing is important here. With determinate data retrieval systems, since the desired
information can be deﬁned so precisely, it is clear that the searcher is primar-
ily involved in ﬁnding that information. But for a large less determinate content
retrieval system, since it is usually unclear what the exact search query is that
will retrieve what is wanted, the initial part of the search is not so much looking
for the right information as it is looking for the right search queries. Since, as
Swanson showed, content retrieval is a trial-and-error process, the searcher must
ﬁrst be focused on identifying and correcting or mitigating the errors of retrieval
that typify the ﬁrst attempts to ﬁnd what he wants. This two-stage approach to
searching is often overlooked in the design of content retrieval systems. That is,
if the searcher must begin his search for content by actively looking for the “right
search terms/queries” with which to initiate his search, then a good content re-
trieval system must be designed to help the searcher in this process—most content
retrieval systems do not do this. Thus, content retrieval systems must support both
kinds of searches—the search for the best queries and then the search for the de-
sired information. The only major document content retrieval system that actively
helps searchers ﬁnd the best queries with which to begin their searches is Swan-
son’s Arrowsmith Project which provides this kind of support for active searches
on Medline, the national medical research document retrieval system maintained
by the National Library of Medicine. Swanson built Arrowsmith because he saw

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
343
that the inherent indeterminacy in content representation, in even such a closely
controlled and manually indexed retrieval system as Medline, was so great that it
was possible to uncover “undiscovered medical knowledge” among the published
writings of medical researchers by linking together medical research documents
that had not previously been linked together by Medline’s carefully constructed
and applied content descriptions. Swanson brilliantly proved his point by propos-
ing, for the ﬁrst time, several treatments for illnesses that had not been proposed
before (e.g., treating Raynaud’s syndrome with Omega-3 ﬁsh-oil, and treating Mi-
graine headaches with Magnesium). This inspired subsequent medical research
which proved that Swanson’s proposed treatments were effective.445 Thus Swan-
son showed that indeterminacy in language is unavoidable even in such carefully
constructed normative taxonomies as medical content descriptions.
How Do Computers Inﬂuence Information Systems?
So far we have described how the determinate Data Model of information retrieval has
inﬂuenced the less determinate Document Content Retrieval Model. But there is another
major factor of inﬂuence on the Content Retrieval Model and that is the use of computers
to build such retrieval systems. Computers have had a number of signiﬁcant inﬂuences on
the less determinate Document Content Retrieval Systems:
i. Computers often force an unnatural precision on categories. The majority of
computerized information systems operate by performing exact matches between
category descriptions and the items in that category. But there are situations where
the membership in a particular category may not be that precisely determined. This
is commonly the case in representing information content since it is rarely the case
thatonecouldsaythataparticulardocumentisaboutonlyonething.Forexample,if
we had a biography of Aristotle, what category would you put it in? It could realisti-
cally be linked to the category of “Biography,” of course, but it could also be linked
to the category of “Ancient Greek History,” or the category of “Ancient Greek
Philosophy.” Yet these obvious categories only scratch the surface of the possible
categories that Aristotle’s biography could be linked to. For example, the biography
could be classiﬁed as an example of “good biographical writing” or “bad biograph-
ical writing,” or “pioneering work in formal logic” or an example of the “life of an
inﬂuential thinker.” Of course the response to this categorical indeterminacy is to
simply recommend that all possible categories be added to Aristotle’s biography.
But this overlooks the fact that some of these categories are more appropriate than

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
others, and some of them, while reasonable, may actually be misleading for a ma-
jority of the searchers. It is also the case that while adding all the possible category
descriptions to a document is faithful to the demands of content description, it
ignores the importance of content discrimination, that is, while each of the content
descriptions will make it more likely that a searcher who would want the document
will be able to anticipate the correct search query, it is also the case that it is more
likely that the document will be retrieved by those who don’t want that particular
content. This is, as we have discussed, particularly true on large content retrieval
systems. The recommendation to add as many content descriptions as possible to
documents has been called “unlimited aliasing.” We have discussed how there may
be no upper limit to the number of possible content descriptions that can be added to
a document, so while the addition of content descriptions may expand the descrip-
tion of document content, it ignores the fact that some content descriptions are more
useful than others. The key to document representation is not unlimited aliasing—
just adding as many content descriptions as possible—the key is to add just the right
content descriptions, ones that simultaneously describe the documents well and
discriminate them from other documents in the collection. In an empirical study,
Brooks could not ﬁnd evidence to support the unlimited aliasing recommended
by Furnas, et al. “This experiment found no evidence to support the Strategy of
Unlimited Aliasing. . . some index terms are simply better than others.”446
ii. Computerizing an information system often removes information from its ac-
tive context. As we discussed before, most categories of data—names, addresses,
phone numbers, etc.—are fairly determinate, and because of this their precise
meaning is not affected by changes in context. An address is still obviously an
address whether you read it in a document or see it written on the side of a truck.
Such is not the case, as we have said, for content descriptions. When considered by
themselves, these descriptions can be quite indeterminate. For example, suppose
that you saw the content description “Systems” assigned to a particular document
that was not available to look at. So, on the basis of the content description “Sys-
tems,” what do you think the document would be about? There is no clear answer
to such a question. But if we refer back to Wittgenstein, he was quite clear about
how you resolve ambiguities or indeterminacies in language—you look at how the
words are actually used. The use of words is just another way of saying that you
need to look at their active context. In our example, you may not be able to under-
stand what the single word “Systems” actually means when it is used to represent
the intellectual content of a document, but if you can look at the actual context
of the document, for example, that it was a document that came from the ﬁling
cabinet of a computer technician who specialized in building and maintaining ac-
counting systems, you would then have a much better idea of what kind of content

345
“Systems” actually refers to in this case. Prior to the widespread use of comput-
erized information, documents often had a kind of social context—that is, if you
worked in an organization when all documents were made of paper, and wanted a
document on a particular subject, your best search strategy was to simply ask others
in the organization if they had such a document or, if not, if they could recommend
someone else in the organization who might have it or know where it might be.
Since paper-based information was cumbersome to manage, people would gener-
ally only keep information that they found particularly useful. As a result, knowing
who had what information, and what activities they participated in, could tell you a
great deal about the information itself. By understanding what the social context of
information was, it was also much easier to see what the “value” of the information
was. Such a social organization of information was quickly bypassed when docu-
ments became machine-readable. As more and more information came to reside on
computers, it tended to lose its social context. It was no longer as signiﬁcant when
someone kept a particular document on his computer, because, given the low cost
of computer storage and the easy and rapid ability to copy documents, people could
keep machine-readable copies of documents that were not necessarily that useful
to them. In fact, it’s not uncommon for people to have copies of documents on their
computers that they have not even read. One of the major consequences of losing
the social context of documents and not being able to see their value, is that it be-
comes increasingly hard to distinguish important information from less important
or unimportant information. As a result, there is no incentive to throw any of that
information away. This contributes to the continual growth of document collec-
tions on computers, and the resulting degradation of effective retrieval of needed
information. In the early 1970’s I worked for a company that had its headquarters in
San Francisco. In this period, virtually all documents were kept and stored as paper
copies. The company, in order to keep the comparatively expensive ofﬁce space as
small as possible, had a rigid company-wide rule that no one could have more than
one ﬁling cabinet in his or her ofﬁce. This rigidly enforced rule meant that employ-
ees could not usually keep every document they received or used, but it had the
beneﬁcial effect of forcing employees to regularly “weed” their document collec-
tionsandkeeponlythatinformationthatwasreallyimportanttothemandnecessary
for their jobs. As a consequence, the value of virtually all of the paper documents
in the organization was well understood, and the organization was not littered with
useless documents. Soon all of this changed when the company installed equip-
ment that could convert paper documents into 16mm microﬁlm. Because a single
microﬁlm roll could hold 6000 pages of documents, it became possible for em-
ployees to put all the documents on microﬁlm that they would have thrown away
before. Now that nothing needed to be thrown away, they became very casual about
deciding what to keep as paper and what to put on microﬁlm. Also, since what they
kept on microﬁlm was often a jumble of documents with dissimilar content, there
was no easy way to describe in detail what was contained in the 6000 pages of a ﬁlm
roll. As a result, in less than a year there were over 35 microﬁlm rolls—210,000
pages of documents—labeled “Miscellaneous,” some of which actually contained
documents that were important for the activities of the organization.

346
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
iii. Computers can force searchers, indexers and content system designers into
unnatural Language Games. Since we have discussed how many organizations
now have an economic disincentive for weeding out less useful and useless
information—that it costs more to periodically examine the information on a
computer and decide what to keep, than to simply keep everything—many organi-
zations have gotten to the point that virtually nothing is thrown away. The obvious
consequence of this is that computerized information systems will continue to
grow larger at a rapid rate with no clear upper limit. The dramatic increase in
the size of less determinate content retrieval systems has forced the designers
and users into unnatural Language Games. Speciﬁcally, when there are thousands
of documents that all have similar content, it becomes extremely difﬁcult to use
natural language to distinguish some of the content from the many other different,
but similar contents of documents on the same system. In short, our natural
language was never intended to make the kind of subtle distinctions that would be
required to describe the slight differences of content of thousands or millions of
documents with similar content. If our natural language cannot make the distinc-
tions necessary to discriminate the different kinds of content in a large information
retrieval system, then we have to ﬁnd other means to make these distinctions
manifest.
Managing the Retrieval of Indeterminate Information
Content—Some Practical Consequences
Since one of the themes of this discussion has been to look at how indeterminacy in
language affects the retrieval of information content, it is appropriate that we end this
discussion with a brief look at the practical consequences that such indeterminacy has for
the actual management of information content.
First of all, as we stated before, indeterminacy in language is not something that can be
squeezed out by a more rational approach such as deﬁning words more precisely. In so far
as indeterminacy in meaning is pervasive in ordinary language, it will be correspondingly
pervasive in information systems, especially content-retrieval ones. But while indetermi-
nacy cannot be eliminated, its effects can be mitigated. Let’s look at how this might be
done.
Representing Intellectual Content. The most fundamental question in the design of
content retrieval systems is, of course, how do you represent the content of information?
When an index term is assigned to represent some speciﬁc content, it is, in linguistic
terms, a “reference” to that content. If we recall what Putnam stated about the character
of “reference,” we are reminded that referring words do not refer to some mental concept,
their reference must be, as Putnam put it, “socially ﬁxed”—that is, what enables a reference
to work are not the concepts that people have “in their heads,” but the active way that they
use the words to refer to something. Although Putnam is a contemporary philosopher, he
has acknowledged his afﬁnity with Wittgenstein’s philosophy, and it is clear that the notion
of reference being “socially ﬁxed” is a description that Wittgenstein would be sympathetic
to since it ﬁts with his idea of linguistic meaning being based on use. The importance of

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
347
this view of reference for content-retrieval is that if a system designer wanted to represent
a certain information document content with “term A,” it cannot be justiﬁed by saying
that “term A” appears within the title or the text of the document, or that people “think”
that “term A” represents that content. The best justiﬁcation for “term A” being used to
represent the content of this document is whether the individuals who would use that
document would actually refer to that content themselves by using “term A.” In this way,
“term A” would be “socially ﬁxed” to the content of that document. Thus, the ﬁrst step in
representing information content is to examine how the potential users of the information
system actually talk about this kind of information content—“Let the use teach you the
meaning.” [PI p. 212]
While the examination of how users talk about the information content on an information
retrieval system is a good way to see how the information should be represented, it is
not a solution without limitations. Speciﬁcally, although users might refer to a particular
document content using “term B,” this might be a useful way to represent this content if
there are only a limited number of documents on the system with this content and the rest of
the documents on the system are concerned with clearly different content that would not be
represented by “term B.” Using “term B” to represent the content of a document runs into
a problem when the number of documents so represented is large. How many is a “large
number of documents?” This is not an easy ﬁgure to estimate, but a good touchstone is the
average “futility point” of the users of the system—the maximum number of documents
that the searchers, on average, are willing to look through to ﬁnd what they want. When the
number of documents using “term B” to represent their content gets above the threshold
of the average futility point, then there is the possibility that the users will not ﬁnd “term
B” by itself a very useful search term. The reason why this happens is that in ordinary
usage, a particular reference to information content, for example “philosophy,” is typically
only used to make fairly obvious distinctions. For example, if a friend of mine tells me his
son just declared his college major, and I ask him what major he declared, it’s perfectly
understandable for him to just say “philosophy.” But if I am looking for some information
on “philosophy,” and there are thousands of documents on the information system with that
content description, the chances are that I don’t want just anything with that content, but
some speciﬁc subset of it. This example is even more striking when we consider content
searching on the World Wide Web. Using the Google search engine, the search term
“philosophy” returns 18,200,000 websites. When this occurs, system designers must ﬁnd
ways for searchers to reduce the size of the retrieved sets without raising the probability
of excluding the desired documents.
Reducing Indeterminacy in Content Retrieval
As we pointed out before, indeterminacy in content retrieval is not one thing. There are
several major kinds of indeterminacy, and each can have different mitigating strategies.
Semantic Ambiguity. This kind of indeterminacy is a consequence of the fact that the
same word can be used in multiple contexts and have a different meaning in each context.
Consider our examples of the words “head” or “line” which each have a number of distinct
“meanings.” How can these meanings be distinguished if they are used to represent the
content of documents? The easiest way is to not represent the content of information with

348
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
a single word such as “head” but to represent it with the word “head” in its appropriate se-
mantic context—for example, “head of the intelligence committee” or “medical treatment
of head injuries.” One of the recent changes in some Internet search engines like Teoma and
Google is that they now include the sentence in which the search term appears at each se-
lected website. This helps the searcher to see which retrieved websites are using the search
term the way she intended it. This would be a good model for full-text retrieval systems
to follow, although it certainly doesn’t solve all the problems of full-text content retrieval.
Category Overload. One of the contributors to indeterminacy that is most characteristic of
content retrieval systems is the retrieval of large numbers of documents that are represented
by the same search term. As we pointed out before, Zipf showed that when a word is used
many times in ordinary usage, the number of different meanings it has will increase as its
usageincreases.Consequently,ascontent-retrievalsystemsgetlarger,astheyareinevitably
doing, the levels of indeterminacy will go up too. How can the effects of category overload
be mitigated? The most obvious way is to try to keep the retrieved sets as small as possible.
One way to do this is to keep the entire system as small as possible by regularly examining
the information in the system and removing any documents that are no longer useful. As
we pointed out, this is often not done because the cost of weeding out useless documents
is usually more than the cost of simply keeping everything. But there is another cost that
is important here, namely, the cost of less effective retrieval. As more useless documents
are kept on the retrieval system, the cost of retrieval will continue to increase. This cost of
retrieval is really two costs: ﬁrst, as more useless documents ﬁll the system, retrieved sets
will become larger, and the searcher will have to work harder to ﬁnd what she wants if it’s
buried in a large retrieved set. Secondly, as the retrieved sets get larger, it becomes more
likely that the searcher won’t see the desired document even when it is in the retrieved set.
This can add the additional cost of not being able to retrieve the information that is wanted.
Language Productivity. Because there are so many different ways that the same content
can be represented by the system designer or indexer, and the searcher, there must be a
way to direct the searcher towards the right descriptions. One obvious way is to use a
normative classiﬁcation scheme which states quite clearly that certain speciﬁc content
can only be represented in one way. This is what Medline, the medical research retrieval
system does when it classiﬁes medical documents by using the same words that physicians
and medical researchers use to refer to medical subjects such as afﬂictions and treatments.
Of course, the use of a normative representation scheme generally requires that such a
scheme already exists and be supported by the active users of the information system. A
normative representation scheme is not something that can be declared by ﬁat, it must be a
reference scheme that is part of the practice that it supports. If it is not part of the practice
it supports, it will be hard for searchers to understand just what the terms of representation
actually “mean” because they will have no clear usage.
ContentRepresentationand“¨ubersichtlicheDarstellungen.”Sincecontentrepresentations
use ordinary language to describe content, then, like ordinary language these uses of
language should be “learnable.” Since Wittgenstein showed how essential “perspicuous
representations” (“¨ubersichtliche Darstellungen”) were to learning what the meanings of
particular words are, it follows that if the language used to represent information content
is to be learnable it should have “perspicuous representations” too. This can be done in

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
349
a content retrieval system by explicitly linking each content representation term to an
information content that best represents what the content term “means,” and identifying
these “perspicuous representations” for searchers so that they can more quickly get an
idea of what particular content representations actually mean.
Large Content Retrieval Systems vs. Small Content Retrieval Systems
While the results of the STAIRS evaluation (q.v.) are striking, when it was published there
was a lot of resistance to its results. In particular, a number of previous studies of full-text
retrieval systems were cited which had much better retrieval results. But when these eval-
uations were examined it was discovered that they were conducted on comparatively small
retrieval systems of fewer than 200 documents (as compared with the 40,000 documents
of the STAIRS study). Of course the problem was the assumption that if retrieval worked
well on a small system, it would work well on a large system of the same design. We have
already discussed the problem with such an assumption or “disease of thinking” (q.v.),
and have shown why large content-retrieval systems have rates of retrieval effectiveness
that decrease as the system gets larger. But if it is the case that even full-text retrieval
can be adequate on small systems, this actually has a consequence for the design of large
content-retrieval systems. In short, the best way to insure good retrieval on a large content-
retrieval system is to turn it into a small system. This doesn’t mean to get rid of most of
the documents, but to develop partitions in the document collection so that searchers,
instead of applying their search requests to the entire document collection will actually
only apply them to a much smaller partition of the collection. If content retrieval is much
more likely to be successful on systems of 200 documents or less, then it stands to reason
that even a document collection of thousands of documents could be searched effectively
if the searcher was assured that the documents she wanted were all in a particular partition
of less than 200 documents. Without such partitions, the searchers are likely to apply their
own form of active retrieved set reduction by conjunctively adding search terms to the
original query. This is not a good strategy in indeterminate searching because, in the ﬁrst
place, it changes the searcher’s original query to something that is semantically different,
and with the addition of each indeterminate search term, while the number of documents
retrieved goes down, the probability of retrieving the desired content goes down too [the
details of this combinatoric problem were discussed in the previous section “‘Escalating
Uncertainty of Retrieval’: The Problem with Large Systems and Indeterminately Repre-
sented Information.”] How can such partitions be designed? There are a number of ways
partitions can be constructed, for example:
1. Partitions based on temporal values. Most documents or other texts have a time
when they were published or created or even a time when they become obsolete.
Sometimes the time of creation can be an effective partition for content searching
such as when a searcher desires information content that was created within a
speciﬁc time period.
2. Partitions based on authors. Most documents have authors, and frequently this
can be the basis of a useful partition. This is especially true in research-oriented
information systems since authors’ names can often be a good way of partitioning
documents that pertain to a particular activity or subject.

350
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
3. Partitions based on publishers. Publishers, of course, often exercise critical judg-
ment when deciding what documents or books to publish, and such judgment can
be an effective way of partitioning texts that concern a particular topic, or are of a
particular quality. Even the works of a single publisher can be partitioned by, for
example, the names of the journals it publishes.
4. Partitions based on the principal activities of the users. Of course, it has been
the theme of this discussion that the activities of the users of an information system
can be an effective way to classify the information that they use in these activities. It
stands to reason, then, that if the information on a system is being used in a number
of speciﬁc activities, then these activities may be an effective basis for partitions.
5. Partitions based on document type. (internal memo, external letter, book,
government publication, published document, ﬁnancial analysis, etc.)
6. Partitions based on normative taxonomies. We have already discussed how the
normative taxonomies of the sciences are, in some sense, “ideal” subject classi-
ﬁcations. It seems logical, then, that such normative taxonomy partitions would
be the goal of any large content-retrieval design. But it is important to understand
that what makes a normative taxonomy such as Botany or Obstetric Medicine so
effective as a way of partitioning information content is that such taxonomies are
part of the practice of being a Botanist or an Obstetrician. Thus, effective norma-
tive taxonomies cannot be easily created by simply ordering system users to think
this way. They are typically only effective if they already exist and are understood
and supported by the potential users of the information retrieval system.
7. Partitions based on physical separation. It is often the case nowadays that exist-
ing information systems are combined with other information systems to produce
larger and more comprehensive information systems. Sometimes, the previous in-
formation systems can be effective partitions for information that is used for a par-
ticular activity, or is concerned with a particular subject area. Consequently, when
information systems are combined to produce larger systems, the system designers
should consider whether to keep the different system contents as searchable parti-
tions of the larger system. This decision should be made, of course, by interviewing
the potential users of the larger system and determining whether they would ﬁnd
the previous systems useful searchable partitions of the new system. Even the infor-
mation collected by individuals within an organization can sometimes be useful
partitions for an information system. That is, if individuals frequently went to
“Mary Ann. . . ” or “Fred. . . ” to ﬁnd information on a particular topic or informa-
tion useful in a particular activity, it stands to reason that the information that Mary
Ann and Fred had in their possession may still be effective partitions in this regard.
This is particularly true for individuals who leave an organization, and is a way of
maintaining the usefulness of their information selection after they have gone.
8. Partitions based on information usage. We have already said that it is generally
a good idea to regularly “weed out” useless documents/information. This keeps
the retrieval system from growing larger with information that is of no use to the

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
351
searchers. One of the reasons some information system designers are reluctant
to do this is that they feel that they can’t absolutely say which documents are
so useless that they can be discarded. If this is the case, then when you “weed”
an information system, the documents that are not considered useful do not
have to be thrown away, they merely have to be moved to a partition containing
“less useful” documents that is separate from the active retrieval system. Such a
partition can be the basis for an “archive” of information. Searchers who cannot
ﬁnd what they want on the active system, then would still be able to search the
partition of “less useful” documents in case what they want is there.
9. Partitions based on previous searches. If the information system can maintain
a record of successful searches, these could be used as heuristics for subsequent
searches. For each successful search, a record should be kept of the natural
language statement of the search query, the actual formal query which retrieved
the desired documents, and the documents which satisﬁed the request.
It is essential that partitions satisfy two requirements:
1. The reference that deﬁnes a partition, such as a time period, author’s name, docu-
ment type, etc. must be completely determinate; that is, there can be no ambiguity
about which partition a document belongs in. If a partition is not completely de-
terminate then it cannot be an effective searchable subset of the entire collection.
2. The partition itself must divide the documents into searchable subsets of the entire
collection, that is, the types of searches which the users engage in should, most of
the time, fall within a single partition, or within a very few partitions. Once again,
it is essential to examine the kinds of searching that the users engage in primarily
to determine what kinds of partitions would satisfy these two criteria.
Using Documents Themselves as Instruments of Organization and Indeterminacy
Reduction—“Exemplary Documents” and “Seed Searching”
Since we have shown how “meaning” in language is best understood by looking at how
words are used, it stands to reason that usage is an important criterion for determining how
document content might be arranged and how it should be referred to or indexed. As we
said, it is best to talk to the users of the system to ﬁnd out how they discuss the information
content held on the information system. But there is sometimes another source of this
referential information—certain speciﬁc documents. The documents that can provide this
segmentation and description of the content in an information system, are what have
been called “exemplary documents.”447 Exemplary documents are those documents that
describe or exhibit the intellectual structure of a particular area of intellectual content.
In so doing, they provide both a referential/indexing vocabulary for that content area
and, more importantly, a natural language context in which the terms which refer to this
content have a clearer meaning, thus making it easier for searchers to understand how the

352
Wittgenstein, Language and Information
document/information content is arranged and referred to. The most obvious example of
an exemplary document is the “survey article” that appears in the literature of a particular
research area. This kind of article explicitly discusses the major issues or topics in a ﬁeld of
study, and often provides speciﬁc references from these issues to signiﬁcant publications,
authors and institutions that are important in this area. But survey articles don’t just provide
a “topography” of the intellectual landscape of the ﬁeld, they also discuss the issues of
the ﬁeld using the professional vernacular of that ﬁeld; that is, they are demonstrations
of how the ﬁeld refers to, and talks about, these issues and topics, and what the “socially
ﬁxed” references of that content area are. In this way, the survey article can act as a kind of
conservative linguistic process that demonstrates how, out of the many ways a topic could
be discussed, it usually is discussed in that ﬁeld of inquiry. Survey articles, therefore,
provide two essential elements for representing the intellectual content of documents in a
particular ﬁeld:
r
A description of the major issues or topics in the ﬁeld, or part of the ﬁeld.
r
A demonstration of the language used to refer to the issues and topics with which
the ﬁeld is concerned.
Another example of an exemplary document would be in litigation. Corporate and gov-
ernment litigation are just two areas where there is a dramatically increasing number of
large-scale lawsuits—lawsuits in which attorneys may need to have access to thousands,
or sometimes millions of documents. Further, the successful conduct of the lawsuit is
critically dependent on effective document access. The intellectual structure of the in-
formation germane to a particular lawsuit is best exempliﬁed in an exemplary document
called the “complaint.” The complaint identiﬁes, very precisely, the issues or events being
litigated, the individuals involved in the case, and, if relevant, the institutions involved
also. In addition, the complaint will often identify the chronological sequence of events
that ties all the individuals, issues and institutions together, and will often assert causal
links between certain key events which can be useful in retrieval. Looking at the above
examples of exemplary documents, we can start to see some of the characteristics that
many of them have:
i. They provide a synoptic view or survey of at least some of the major topics and
issues of an area of intellectual content.
ii. They often discuss these topics and issues with a vocabulary that is a restricted
subset of all the possible ways these issues could be discussed. An exemplary
document is a demonstration of the “dialect” of natural language that is used to
talk about issues in that content area. In this way, an exemplary document can limit
the “productivity” of language.
iii. They often indicate the structure or framework of the content by showing, explicitly
or implicitly, the relationship between some or all of the issues or topics they
identify (e.g., that certain issues are related causally; or chronologically).
Exemplary Documents enable inquirers to better understand the intellectual structure of
the content of a document collection. One of the trade-offs of content-retrieval is that the

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
353
more complex the intellectual structure of an indexing or representation scheme is, the
harder it may be for the searchers to understand. Yet, if we want to provide high levels of
retrieval effectiveness for some content retrieval systems, then we will need fairly complex
and detailed intellectual structures for representing the various contents of the documents.
But such complex representation schemes will require that inquirers must be able to
learn them. Unfortunately, most indexed collections of documents are not constructed to
facilitate the “learning” of the intellectual structure.448 Often the only way an inquirer can
learn how documents are represented on a system is by trial and error—by submitting
queries and retrieving documents.449 Such a piecemeal process is a very unsystematic and
difﬁcult way to learn, in any general way, how the documents in the collection have been
represented. In the ﬁrst place, the inquirer may never be able to see enough documents to
form any general opinion about how the documents are represented450; and, in the second
place, if the inquirer can only see individual documents it may be hard to infer what the
broad intellectual relationships are that may exist among the different contents of groups
of documents. Exemplary documents can help to defeat, or at least mitigate, this problem
by providing access to not only the intellectual concepts of a content area, but also to the
structure of those concepts and the speciﬁc vocabulary used to discuss them.
Given the capabilities of current information systems, there is a very useful way to present
an exemplary document that structures the content of a particular information system.
Speciﬁcally, the full text of the exemplary document can be placed on the information
system with hypertext links from the statements in the text which refer to the information
content of the system, to the actual documents on the system which have these referred
to intellectual contents. This means that the searchers can begin their searches by reading
the exemplary document that refers to their area of interest, and then directly follow the
links from the exemplary document to the subset(s) of the content that they want. This
is a much better way to provide access to the intellectual content of the retrieval system
than by simply listing the different descriptions by themselves, like a subject catalogue
in a library, and providing links to the appropriate documents. Such a list would not give
searchers any indication of what the descriptions actually mean, whereas the exemplary
document not only contains the appropriate descriptions which refer to various contents,
it uses these words in a natural language discussion of the content, so it gives the searchers
a better understanding of what the references actually “mean.” An exemplary document
would be a better introduction to the “meaning” of the references than any deﬁnitions of
the references would be.
Seed-Searching and “Pitching Horseshoes in the Dark”: One of the difﬁculties
searchers have with content retrieval is learning how the content they want is actually
represented on the retrieval system. As we said, the searcher often must try to ﬁnd out how
content is represented by trial and error. This is made more difﬁcult because there are two
kinds of indeterminacy which occur in content retrieval: the indeterminacy of search term

selection, and the indeterminacy of document representation. Together, they act to increase
the overall indeterminacy of the retrieval system. Yet there is, in some retrieval situations,
a way to reduce one of these indeterminacies. The method is called “Seed Searching.”451
When a searcher begins to use a content retrieval system for the ﬁrst time to search for
some speciﬁc content, it is very difﬁcult for him to know with any certainty what the best
candidates for search terms are. This is where the “trial and error” part of content retrieval
begins. But unless the retrieval system uses a well-understood normative representation
scheme, the searcher’s initial queries may be no more than “wild guesses,” and, if so, may
lead to a lot of effort and frustration before he begins to retrieve the information content
that he wants. Basically, when the searcher starts, he doesn’t have a good idea how the
information content he wants is represented on the system, because, as we have shown,
given the “productivity” of language, there may be an uncountable number of ways that
a particular content can be represented or referred to. It’s like “pitching horseshoes in the
dark”—if you can’t see the post you’re trying to hit with your horseshoe, then not only is
it difﬁcult to hit it, but you can’t even tell how far and in what direction you’re pitch of
the horseshoe is off the mark, so it’s hard to make an informed adjustment to the missing
toss. Selecting the right search terms to look for speciﬁc content on a new information
retrieval system has a similar character—not only is it hard to ﬁnd the right search terms,
but it may even be difﬁcult to determine how “far off the mark” the initial search terms
are if they did not retrieve what was wanted—basically, such search failures are relatively
uninformative, if you don’t get the content you want with a particular search query, it is
hard to see how to change it to make a better query. Seed searching is a way to reduce the
effect of this uncertainty. It works in the following way: instead of beginning a content
search by guessing which search terms will work, the searcher should, if possible, begin by
identifying a document he has already read that he knows has the content he wants and see
if it already exists on the system (I’m assuming that such a document can be retrieved by
specifying something other than the content representations, such as the title, the author’s
name, or the publisher and date of publication, etc.). If a searcher can ﬁnd such a document
on the retrieval system, then he can look at how the content of the document is represented
by the system. This representation can then become the basis for a search query that will
very likely retrieve the content that the searcher wants. Of course, it won’t always be the
case that a searcher can identify a document with the desired content that already exists
on the retrieval system, but it is a strategy that is worth considering since it gives a far
better starting search query than what the searcher would have if he just has to guess at
how the content he wants is represented.452

452The “Seed Searching” strategy for content retrieval was developed as a result of a request by one of the editors
of Mathematical Reviews in the early 1980s. The editor told me that Mathematical Reviews, which publishes
English language reviews of all the mathematical research articles published throughout the world, was in a
difﬁcult position because many of the subscribers said that they had a hard time determining how the articles
that concerned the branch of mathematical research they were interested in were represented in the reviews. The
editor told me that they were ready to spend up to $400,000 to redesign their classiﬁcation scheme, so that their
clients could ﬁnd the content they wanted more easily. He then said that he had contacted me so that I could
help in the redesign of the classiﬁcation scheme. I pointed out, that instead of changing the representations of
thousands of mathematical reviews stretching back to 1940, it would be far better for them to suggest that their
clients ﬁrst retrieve an article from Mathematical Reviews that they already knew had the content they wanted,
then look at how the content of that article was represented. These representations could then be used to ﬁnd

Measuring the Effectiveness of Content Retrieval
Naturally, a well-run content retrieval system should have a sense of how well it is op-
erating, that is, how successful the searches are that are conducted on the system. Of
course, the system could keep track of the searchers’ evaluations of the success of their
searches. While this is revealing information, it is relatively hard to gather this kind of data
because searchers rarely like to take the time to record their evaluations of their searches.
In addition, it is hard to add evaluations from different searchers together because their
evaluations may not actually be comparable. For example, if two searchers each say that
their respective searches were “unsuccessful” they could still mean very different things
by these descriptions. For one searcher, although the search was “unsuccessful” she im-
mediately saw how to change her search query to retrieve the content that she wanted.
But for the other searcher, the “unsuccessful” search left him completely in the dark, and
became the ﬁrst of many in a sequence of “unsuccessful” searches. This raises the ques-
tion of whether there is a way to test the overall effectiveness of a content retrieval system
without having to compensate for the probable differences in meaning of the searchers’
evaluations. There is. Once again, we must look at how language is being used in the
searching process.
George Kingsley Zipf demonstrated that there were empirical ways to measure the
effectiveness of language use.453 He showed how one could tabulate the frequen-
cies in which individual words occur in ordinary language usage and construct
a rank-frequency distribution of these words and their frequencies. This distribu-
tion could then be examined to determine how effective the language usage which
produced the data was. Zipf’s rank-frequency distribution in language was used
as a basis for estimating the effectiveness of content-retrieval by Blair(1990).454
But there actually is a similar, but easier way to estimate the effectiveness of a
content-retrieval system. Instead of using the Zipﬁan distribution as the measure
of retrieval effectiveness, one needs only examine the similarity of the searchers’
use of language and the language of representation for the retrieval system. That is,
the system could keep track of the number of times individual search terms were
used in queries by all searchers, and construct a rank-frequency distribution of the
terms used. Another rank-frequency distribution could be constructed of the terms
used to represent the content of the documents on the retrieval system. These two
rank-frequency distributions could then be compared to see how similar they were.
If they were similar, then it would mean that the searchers were using the language
of content representation in a similar way to the way it was used to represent the
intellectual content of the information. This homogeneity of usage between search-
ing and content representation would most likely mean that content-retrieval on the
system was relatively successful. By the same token, if there is a dissimilarity of
other reviews with similar content. The only requirement would be that the indexing representation process be
consistent, so that even if the articles in a particular area were represented in a way that a client thought was
unusual, once he determined what this representation was all other reviews of documents with similar content
would be represented the same way.

Wittgenstein, Language and Information
language usage between searching and content representation then it is clear that
the searchers are using the language of content representation differently than it is
being used by the retrieval system to represent the content of the documents. This
would be a general indicator of probable poor searching results. The advantage of
this method, of course, is that it is very easy to calculate since a retrieval system
could be programmed to gather this data as searches are carried out on the system.
It is also a feasible way to calculate the effectiveness of a content-retrieval system
without forcing the searchers to record their judgments of retrieval effectiveness
every time they search. The basic assumption of this method is that if searchers
are to be successful at retrieving the intellectual content they desire, they must
use language in searching in the same way that the language is used to represent
the content of the information on the retrieval system. This assumption is clearly
consistent with the Wittgensteinean view of language that we have discussed here.
The STAIRS Evaluation: A Final Look
Given this discussion of the practical methods for mitigating the effects of indeterminate
content retrieval, it may be instructive to discuss how these recommendations could have
been used to make a better retrieval system out of the full-text content retrieval system
investigated in the STAIRS evaluation. First of all, as the searchers used the STAIRS
system it was clear that many of the searches required documents of a speciﬁc type.
Consequently, document type would have been an effective partition for the collection.
Each document on the system should have been classiﬁed according to its type so it could
be retrieved with other documents of the same type. Since the document type was not
something that could be inferred by the computer from the text of the document alone,
these representations of the documents would have had to be applied to the documents
manually. The type of document is a fairly determinate representation, so it would not have
been a difﬁcult description to add to the documents. The STAIRS study was conducted on
a document collection used to defend a large corporate lawsuit, so the ofﬁcial “complaint”
of the lawsuit which described the legal issues being contested was a complete description
of the content of the document collection. In other words, only documents relevant to
issues identiﬁed in the lawsuit were included in the information retrieval system. The
complaint speciﬁed 13 issues that were being contested. Since every document had to
be relevant to one of these issues, it is clear that these 13 issues could also serve as
partitions for the document collection, and the complaint itself was a good candidate
for an “exemplary document” to be included with the collection. Since each document
included in the collection had to be personally examined and determined to be relevant,
it would not have been much extra effort to also determine which partitions (document
type and issue in the complaint) each relevant document fell into, and manually add these
representations to the documents. Of course, the essence of full-text retrieval then was
that such manual indexing procedures were not necessary, but the results of the STAIRS
evaluation showed that full-text retrieval was not sufﬁcient by itself to enable effective
retrieval of speciﬁc content on a large retrieval system. How much these partitions would
have improved the results of the STAIRS evaluation is, of course, not clear, but there is
little doubt that they would have improved the performance of the system. This is because,
instead of applying the search queries to all the 40,000 documents in the collection, the
queries would have been applied to the much smaller partitions of the collection.

Part III: Wittgenstein, Language and Information
357
Finally, some content retrieval system designers remain expectant of a technical solution
to the problems of retrieving speciﬁc content on a large retrieval system. This could, they
think, take the form of either a particularly fast search engine or the development of a
computer system that “understands” language use. To expect that there will be such a
simple technical solution to the problem of indeterminacy in content retrieval is to ignore
the complexity of language that the ﬁeld of the philosophy of language is a testament to. If
meaning in language is not something that is “in the head” but attains its meaning through
the context and circumstances of usage, then no computer can ever have the understanding
of language that an ordinary individual has, because a computer cannot participate in the
activities and circumstances that an ordinary individual does. As Hilary Putnam put it,
“Cut the pie any way you like, ‘meanings’ just ain’t in the head!”455 We could modify his
statement to assert, just as convincingly:
Cut the pie any way you like, “meanings” just ain’t in the computer!
Summary of the Design Criteria for Large Content-Retrieval Systems
While every content retrieval system is in some sense unique, there are some general
guidelines which we can extract from the previous discussion that can help to improve the
retrieval of information with speciﬁc content.
1. Regularly weed out useless documents, otherwise searchers may wind up “drinking
from the ﬁrehose”—that is, having retrieved sets of documents that are too large
to examine completely.
2. Talk to the potential searchers to determine:
i. What kind of search will be most common: sample, exhaustive or speciﬁc. This
will determine how important it will be to mitigate the inherent indeterminacy
of content retrieval (i.e., if most searches are just sample searches, then in-
determinacy will not be too much of a problem, but if speciﬁc or exhaustive
searches are the norm, then mitigating strategies should be adopted).
ii. How they actually talk about and refer to the intellectual content managed by
the information system.
iii. What possible partitions can be placed in the system that can reduce the number
of documents being searched for individual queries, and can focus the searches
on groups that likely contain the desired documents.
3. Try to ﬁnd “exemplary documents” which discuss the intellectual content of in-
formation on the retrieval system. If they can be found, set them up as “entrances”
and organizers of the content of the system.

4. If strategies are needed to mitigate indeterminacy look at the possibility of provid-
ing relatively determinate “partitions” of the collection that can focus searches on
smaller parts of the document collection.
5. Consider keeping a record of the rank-frequency distributions of search terms and
content representation terms.
6. Create a taxonomy of activities and practices that use the documents in the collec-
tion and link the documents to the activities and practices that use them.
7. For each of the terms in the indexing/searching vocabulary that has multiple mean-
ings in everyday usage, link it explicitly to a “perspicuous representation” in the
document collection which can provide the searchers with good examples of what
the term actually “means,” that is, how it is used, in the retrieval system.
8. Finally, educate the searchers to give them an understanding of the unavoidable
indeterminacy of content representation, and of the various mitigating strategies
for effective retrieval: Partitions, Exemplary documents, Seed Searching, and the
relation of content to the activities that use it.
