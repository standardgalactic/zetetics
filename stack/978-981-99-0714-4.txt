Preface 
The following essays selected from my last three decades of writing illustrate a 
variety of perspectives on the nature of power and the US role in the world. A careful 
reader may notice some changes of emphasis over time, but also some constants. 
The US and China are the two largest economies in the world. We are heavily 
interdependent. China is a rising power and the US is an established power, but that 
need not lead to war which would be devastating for both countries as well as for 
the world economy. China and the US do not pose an existential threat to each other. 
On the contrary, both countries can gain from cooperation. While some degree of 
great-power competition is unavoidable, it is best to think of it in terms of a managed 
competition or a cooperative rivalry. 
After Al Qaeda’s attack on September 11, 2001, American foreign policy focused 
on terrorism and particularly the Middle East region. Since 2017, however, attention 
in Washington has shifted more toward Asia and great-power competition. While 
those changes in priorities make sense, a strategy of great-power competition has 
two problems. First, it lumps together very different types of states. Russia is a 
declining power and China a rising one. The US must appreciate the unique nature 
of the threat that Russia poses. As the world sadly discovered in 1914, on the eve 
of World War I, a declining power (Austria-Hungary) can sometimes be the most 
risk-acceptant in a conﬂict. Today, Russia is in demographic and economic decline, 
but retains enormous resources that it can employ as a spoiler as well as a threat to 
its neighbors as illustrated by its February 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine in violation 
of the important norm of not using force to steal your neighbor’s territory. The US 
therefore needs a Russia strategy that deters its further use of force and helps return 
it to the norms of the UN Charter it signed in 1945. 
A different problem is that the concept of great-power rivalry is the new chal-
lenges the US and the rest of the world face. National security and the global political 
agenda have changed since 1914 and 1945, but focusing solely on great-power rivalry 
strategy underappreciates the new threats from ecological globalization. Scientists 
tell us that global climate change will cost trillions of dollars and can cause damage 
on the scale of war. The COVID-19 pandemic has already killed millions of people

Preface
around the world, and unfortunately, there are more pandemics to come. Policy-
makers in Washington and Beijing are trying to understand their relationship. Some 
politicians and analysts call the current situation a “new Cold War,” but squeezing 
China into this ideological framework misrepresents the real strategic challenge the 
two countries face. The US and the Soviet Union had little bilateral commerce or 
social contact, whereas America and its allies trade heavily with China and (before 
COVID-19) admitted several hundred thousand students to their universities. In addi-
tion, China is now the largest trade partner to more countries than the US is. America 
can decouple security risks involved in dual use of advanced microchips or threats to 
its 5G telecommunications network, but trying to curtail all trade with China would 
be too costly. And even if breaking apart economic interdependence were possible, 
neither sides can decouple the ecological interdependence that obeys the laws of 
biology and physics, not politics. 
Since China and America cannot tackle climate change or pandemics alone, they 
have to realize that some forms of power must be exercised with others, not over 
others. Addressing these global problems will require the US to work with China at 
the same time that it competes with its navy to defend freedom of navigation in the 
South China Sea. If China refuses to cooperate, it has to realize it will hurt itself. 
A rational great-power-competition strategy requires careful net assessment. 
Underestimation breeds complacency, while overestimation creates fear. Either can 
lead to miscalculation. Chinese belief in American decline can be dangerous. China 
is the world’s second-largest economy, and its GDP (at market exchange rates) may 
(or may not) surpass that of the US by the 2030s. But even if it does, China’s per capita 
income remains less than a quarter that of the US, and the country faces a number 
of economic, demographic, and political problems. In addition, the US, Japan, and 
Europe will still represent the largest part of the global economy and will have the 
capacity to work with China to organize a rules-based international order. 
As former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has argued, the objective for 
great-power competition with China is not total victory over an existential threat, but 
rather “managed strategic competition.” That will require America and China to avoid 
demonizing each other. They should instead see the relationship as a “cooperative 
rivalry” that requires equal attention to both sides of the description at the same 
time. That will require more face-to-face meetings, both at the level of leaders and 
peoples, as well as awareness of the new environment. On those terms, we can cope 
successfully, but only if we realize that this is not the great-power competition of the 
nineteenth or twentieth century. 
I have tried to describe that global environment in the following essays. Great-
power competition may be inevitable in a world of sovereign states, but cooperation 
to deal with transnational challenges can simultaneously be a positive sum game. 
If these essays help the reader to better understand the world and create such a 
relationship, they will be worth the time spent writing them and reading them. That 
is my hope.

The Role of Soft Power in Global Politics 
As the world entered the twentieth century, traditional expressions of power in terms 
of the acquisition of land and resources by force became supplanted by more populist 
expressions of power. After two World Wars, and led by mainly by the United States, a 
balance of traditional hard power along with a new form of “soft power” expressed 
through the acceptance of certain cultural elements, values and practices of a state, 
became an increasingly important part of global politics. 
This is where we will start our journey.

Soft Power 
Originally published in 
the Autumn 1990 edition 
of Foreign Policy. 
The end of the American-Soviet duality that characterized the Cold War paved the 
way for a completely new balance of power and a new way to exercise that power. 
It is at this historical turning point, with memories of World Wars and “mutually 
assured destruction”still fresh in the minds of people and governments, as well as 
the lack of a clear enemy in the world, where we ﬁrst come in contact with “soft 
power”. 
The Cold War is over, and Americans are trying to understand their place in a world 
without a deﬁning Soviet threat. Polls report that nearly half the public believe the 
country is in decline, and that those who believe in decline tend to favor protectionism 
and to counsel withdrawal from what they consider “overextended international 
commitments.” 
In a world of growing interdependence, such advice is counterproductive and 
could bring on the decline it is supposed to avert; for if the most powerful country fails 
to lead, the consequences for international stability could be disastrous. Throughout 
history, anxiety about decline and shifting balances of power has been accompanied 
by tension and miscalculation. Now that Soviet power is declining and Japanese 
power rising, misleading theories of American decline and inappropriate analogies 
between the United States and Great Britain in the late nineteenth century have 
diverted our attention away from the real issue—how power is changing in world 
politics. 
The United States is certainly less powerful at the end of the twentieth century than 
it was in 1945. Even conservative estimates show that the U.S. share of global product 
has declined from more than a third of the total after World War II to a little more

Soft Power
than a ﬁfth in the 1980s. That change, however, reﬂects the artiﬁcial effect of World 
War II: Unlike the other great powers, the United States was strengthened by the war. 
But that artiﬁcial preponderance was bound to erode as other countries regained their 
economic health. The important fact is that the U.S. economy’s share of the global 
product has been relatively constant for the past decade and a half. The Council on 
Competitiveness ﬁnds that the U.S. share of world product has averaged 23% each 
year since the mid-1970s. The CIA, using numbers that reﬂect the purchasing power 
of different currencies, reports that the American share of world product increased 
slightly from 25% in 1975 to 26% in 1988. 
These studies suggest that the effect of World War II lasted about a quarter century 
and that most of the decline worked its way through the system by the mid-1970s. 
In fact, the big adjustment of American commitments occurred with then President 
Richard Nixon’s withdrawal from Vietnam and the end of the convertibility of the 
dollar into gold. 
The dictionary tells us that power means an ability to do things and control others, 
to get others to do what they otherwise would not. Because the ability to control others 
is often associated with the possession of certain resources, politicians and diplomats 
commonly deﬁne power as the possession of population, territory, natural resources, 
economic size, military forces, and political stability. For example, in the agrarian 
economies of eighteenth-century Europe, population was a critical power resource 
since it provided a base for taxes and recruitment of infantry. 
Traditionally, the test of a great power was its strength in war. Today, however, 
the deﬁnition of power is losing its emphasis on military force and conquest that 
marked earlier eras. The factors of technology, education, and economic growth are 
becoming more signiﬁcant in international power, while geography, population, and 
raw materials are becoming somewhat less important. 
If so, are we entering a “Japanese period” in world politics? Japan has certainly 
done far better with its strategy as a trading state since 1945 than it did with its military 
strategy to create a Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere in the 1930s. On the 
other hand, Japan’s security in relation to its large military neighbors, China and 
the Soviet Union, and the safety of its sea routes depend heavily on U.S. protection. 
While they may diminish, these problems will not vanish with the end of the Cold 
War. One should not leap too quickly to the conclusion that all trends favor economic 
power or countries like Japan. 
What can we say about changes in the distribution of power resources in the 
coming decades? Political leaders often use the term “multipolarity” to imply the 
return to a balance among a number of states with roughly equal power resources anal-
ogous to that of the nineteenth century. But this is not likely to be the situation at the 
turn of the century, for in terms of power resources, all the potential challengers except 
the United States are deﬁcient in some respect. The Soviet Union lags economically, 
China remains a less-developed country, Europe lacks political unity, and Japan is 
deﬁcient both in military power and in global ideological appeal. If economic reforms 
reverse Soviet decline, if Japan develops a full-ﬂedged nuclear and conventional 
military capability, or if Europe becomes dramatically more uniﬁed, there may be a 
return to classical multipolarity in the twenty-ﬁrst century. But barring such changes,

The Great-Power Shift

the United States is likely to retain a broader range of power resources—military, 
economic, scientiﬁc, cultural, and ideological—than other countries, and the Soviet 
Union may lose its superpower status. 
The Great-Power Shift 
The coming century may see continued American preeminence, but the sources of 
power in world politics are likely to undergo major changes that will create new difﬁ-
culties for all countries in achieving their goals. Proof of power lies not in resources 
but in the ability to change the behavior of states. Thus, the critical question for the 
United States is not whether it will start the next century as the superpower with the 
largest supply of resources, but to what extent it will be able to control the polit-
ical environment and get other countries to do what it wants. Some trends in world 
politics suggest that it will be more difﬁcult in the future for any great power to 
control the political environment. The problem for the United States will be less the 
rising challenge of another major power than a general diffusion of power. Whereas 
nineteenth-century Britain faced new challengers, the twenty-ﬁrst-century United 
States will face new challenges. 
As world politics becomes more complex, the power of all major states to gain 
their objectives will be diminished. To understand what is happening to the United 
States today, the distinction between power over other countries and power over 
outcomes must be clear. Although the United States still has leverage over particular 
countries, it has far less leverage over the system as a whole. It is less well-placed to 
attain its ends unilaterally, but it is not alone in this situation. All major states will 
have to confront the changing nature of power in world politics. 
Such changes, of course, are not entirely new. For example, the rapid growth of 
private actors operating across international borders, whether large corporations or 
political groups, was widely recognized in the early 1970s. Even Henry Kissinger, 
with his deeply rooted belief in classical balance-of-power politics, conceded in a 
1975 speech that “we are entering a new era. Old international patterns are crum-
bling…The world has become interdependent in economics, in communications, in 
human aspirations.” 
By the late 1970s, however, the American political mood had shifted. Iran’s seizure 
of the U.S. embassy in Tehran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan seemed to 
reafﬁrm the role of military force and the primacy of the traditional security agenda. 
Ronald Reagan’s presidency accentuated these trends in the early 1980s. The U.S. 
defense budget increased in real terms for ﬁve straight years, arms control was down-
graded, and public opposition to nuclear forces and deterrence grew. Conventional 
military force was used successfully, albeit against the extremely weak states of 
Grenada and Libya. The shifting agenda of world politics discredited the 1970s’ 
concern with interdependence and restored the traditional emphasis on military 
power. But interdependence continued to grow, and the world of the 1980s was 
not the same as that of the 1950s.

Soft Power
The appropriate response to the changes occurring in world politics today is not 
to abandon the traditional concern for the military balance of power, but to accept 
its limitations and to supplement it with insights about interdependence. In the tradi-
tional view, states are the only signiﬁcant actors in world politics and only a few 
large states really matter. But today, other actors are becoming increasingly impor-
tant. Although they lack military power, transnational corporations have enormous 
economic resources. Thirty corporations today each have annual sales greater than 
the gross national products (GNPs) of 90 countries. In the 1980s, the annual proﬁts 
of IBM and Royal Dutch/Shell Group were each larger than the central government 
budgets of Colombia, Kenya, or Yugoslavia. Multinational corporations are some-
times more relevant to achieving a country’s goals than are other states. The annual 
overseas production by such corporations exceeds the total value of international 
trade. In a regional context, a portrait of the Middle East conﬂict that did not include 
the superpowers would be woefully inadequate, but so would a description that did 
not tell of transnational religious groups, oil companies, and terrorist organizations. 
The issue is not whether state or non-state actors are more important—states usually 
are. The point is that in modern times, more complex coalitions affect outcomes. 
With changing actors in world politics come changing goals. In the traditional 
view, states give priority to military security to ensure their survival. Today, however, 
states must consider new dimensions of security. National security has become more 
complicated as threats shift from the military (i.e., threats against territorial integrity) 
to the economic and ecological. For example, Canadians today are not afraid that 
U.S. soldiers will burn Toronto for a second time (as in 1813); rather, they fear that 
Toronto will be programmed into a backwater by a Texas computer. The forms of 
vulnerability have increased, and trade-offs among policies are designed to deal with 
different vulnerabilities. The United States, for instance, might enhance its energy 
security by sending naval forces to the Persian Gulf, but it could accomplish the 
same goal by enlarging its strategic petroleum reserve, by imposing a gasoline tax to 
encourage conservation at home, and by improving cooperation in institutions like 
the International Energy Agency. 
While military force remains the ultimate form of power in a self-help system, the 
use of force has become more costly for modern great powers than it was in earlier 
centuries. Other instruments such as communications, organizational and institu-
tional skills, and manipulation of interdependence have become important. Contrary 
to some rhetorical ﬂourishes, interdependence does not mean harmony. Rather, it 
often means unevenly balanced mutual dependence. Just as the less enamored of two 
lovers may manipulate the other, the less vulnerable of two states may use subtle 
threats to their relationship as a source of power. Further, interdependence is often 
balanced differently in different spheres such as security, trade, and ﬁnance. Thus, 
creating and resisting linkages between issues when a state is either less or more 
vulnerable than another becomes the art of the power game. Political leaders use 
international institutions to discourage or promote such linkages; they shop for the 
forum that deﬁnes the scope of an issue in the manner best suiting their interests. 
As the instruments of power change, so do strategies. Traditionalists consider 
the goal of security and the instrument of military force to be linked by a strategy

of balancing power. States wishing to preserve their independence from military 
intimidation follow a balancing strategy to limit the relative power of other states. 
Today, however, economic and ecological issues involve large elements of mutual 
advantage that can be achieved only through cooperation. These issues are often 
critical to the reelection of political leaders. A French president today would not 
interfere with Germany’s increased economic growth because German growth is 
critical to French economic growth. The French decision to forego an independent 
economic policy and remain in the European monetary system in the early 1980s is 
one example of such interdependence. 
Traditionalist accounts of world politics often speak of an international system that 
results from the balancing strategies of states. Although bipolarity and multipolarity 
are useful terms, today different spheres of world politics have different distributions 
of power—that is, different power structures. Military power, particularly nuclear, 
remains largely bipolar in its distribution. But in trade, where the European Commu-
nity acts as a unit, power is multipolar. Ocean resources, money, space, shipping, 
and airlines each have somewhat different distributions of power. The power of states 
varies as well, as does the signiﬁcance of non-state actors in different spheres. For 
example, the politics of international debt cannot be understood without considering 
the power of private banks. 
If military power could be transferred freely into the realms of economics and 
the environment, the different structures would not matter, and the overall hierarchy 
determined by military strength would accurately predict outcomes in world politics. 
But military power is more costly and less transferable today than in earlier times. 
Thus, the hierarchies that characterize different issues are more diverse. The games 
of world politics encompass different players at different tables with different piles 
of chips. They can transfer winnings among tables, but often only at a considerable 
discount. The military game and the overall structure of the balance of power domi-
nate when the survival of states is clearly at stake, but in much of modern world 
politics, physical survival is not the most pressing issue. 
Converting Power 
The fragmentation of world politics into many different spheres has made power 
resources less fungible, that is, less transferable from sphere to sphere. Money is 
fungible, in that it can be easily converted from one currency to another. Power has 
always been less fungible than money, but it is even less so today than in earlier 
periods. In the eighteenth century, a monarch with a full treasury could purchase 
infantry to conquer new provinces, which, in turn, could enrich the treasury. This 
was essentially the strategy of Frederick II of Prussia, for example, when in 1740 he 
seized Austria’s province of Silesia. 
Today, however, the direct use of force for economic gain is generally too costly 
and dangerous for modern great powers. Even short of aggression, the translation of 
economic into military power resources may be very costly. For instance, there is

8
Soft Power
no economic obstacle to Japan’s developing a major nuclear or conventional force, 
but the political cost both at home and in the reaction of other countries would be 
considerable. Militarization might then reduce rather than increase Japan’s ability to 
achieve its ends. 
Because power is a relationship, by deﬁnition it implies some context. Diminished 
fungibility means that specifying the context is increasingly important in estimating 
the actual power that can be derived from power resources. More than ever, one must 
ask the question, “Power for what?” Yet at the same time, because world politics 
has only partly changed and the traditional geopolitical agenda is still relevant, some 
fungibility of military power remains. The protective role of military force is a rele-
vant asset in bargaining among states. The dependence of conservative oil-producing 
states on the United States for their security, for example, limited their leverage on 
the United States during the 1973 oil crisis. The United States is still the ultimate 
guarantor of the military security of Europe and Japan, and that role is a source 
of bargaining power in negotiations with its allies. In general, the allies’ need for 
protection strengthens American inﬂuence and may continue to do so even with a 
reduced Soviet threat. During the Cold War, the United States often worried about 
the frailty of its allies and tended to sacriﬁce some economic interests in its effort to 
contain the perceived Soviet menace. Despite the waning of that threat, if the United 
States worries less than its allies do, it may be able to demand more of them. 
To evaluate power in a post-Cold War world, it is necessary to recognize instru-
ments and balance-of-power strategies necessary for a successful policy. But new 
elements in the modern world are diffusing power away from all the great powers. 
Thus, any successful strategy must incorporate both continuity and change. 
The great powers of today are less able to use their traditional power resources to 
achieve their purposes than in the past. On many issues, private actors and small states 
have become more powerful. At least ﬁve trends have contributed to this diffusion of 
power: economic interdependence, transnational actors, nationalism in weak states, 
the spread of technology, and changing political issues. 
New forms of communications and transportation have had a revolutionary effect 
on economic interdependence. A century ago, it took two weeks to cross the Atlantic; 
in 1927, Charles Lindbergh did it in 33 hours; today, the Concorde ﬂies across in three 
and a half hours. Modern telecommunications are instantaneous, and satellites and 
ﬁber-optic cables have led to a tenfold increase in overseas telephone calls in the last 
decade. The declining costs of transportation and communication have revolutionized 
global markets and accelerated the development of transnational corporations that 
transfer economic activity across borders. World trade has grown more rapidly than 
world product, becoming more important in all major economies. Trade has more 
than doubled its role in the U.S. economy over the past two decades. Changes in 
ﬁnancial markets are even more dramatic. International monetary ﬂows are some 25 
times the world’s average daily trade in goods. The rapid expansion of Euro-currency 
and Euro-bond markets (i.e., currencies held outside their home country) has eroded 
the ability of national authorities to control their capital markets. In 1975, foreign 
exchange markets handled some $10–15 billion daily; by 1986, they handled $200 
billion.

Governments can intervene in such markets, but if they do so with a heavy hand, 
they will incur enormous costs in their own economic growth and risk unintended 
effects. For instance, efforts by the U.S. government in the 1960s to slow the export 
of capital by U.S.-based multinational ﬁrms encouraged those ﬁrms to keep and 
borrow dollars outside the United States. The result was the rapid burgeoning of 
Euro-currency markets outside U.S. controls. 
In addition to constraining the way states pursue their national interests, transna-
tional actors affect the way such interests are initially deﬁned. Transnational invest-
ment creates new interests and complicates coalitions in world politics. For example, 
Honda of America is steadily turning into an American car maker. It plans to export 
50,000 cars annually to Japan in the early 1990s. American ofﬁcials are now pressing 
Europeans to open their market to Japanese automobiles produced in the United 
States. In other words, transnational investments have changed an American interest. 
The American case is not unique. For years, France restricted Japanese automo-
biles to 3% of the French market and restricted investment by Japanese companies 
in France. When Japanese automakers began to establish plants in other European 
countries that could export to France, the French government dropped its restrictions. 
Transnational investments changed a long-standing French policy. The diffusion of 
power to private transnational actors and the resulting complication of national inter-
ests is likely to continue even though it is not recognized in many comparisons of 
the power resources of major states. 
Modernization, urbanization, and increased communication in developing coun-
tries have also diffused power from government to private actors. Military power is 
more difﬁcult to apply today than in the past because a social awakening has stirred 
nationalism in otherwise poor or weak states. This increased social mobilization 
makes military intervention and external rule more costly. The nineteenth-century 
great powers carved out and ruled colonial empires with a handful of troops. In 
1953, the United States was able to restore the Shah of Iran to his throne through a 
minor covert action. It is hard to imagine, however, how many troops would have 
been needed to restore the Shah in the socially mobilized and nationalistic Iran of 
1979. The United States and the Soviet Union found the costs of maintaining troops 
in Vietnam and Afghanistan unsupportable. In each case, the cause was less an 
increase in the power of a weaker state than the costliness for outsiders of ruling 
actively antagonistic populations. 
Another trend in the diffusion of power is the spread of modern technology, which 
has enhanced the capabilities of backward states. While the superpowers have kept 
a large lead in military technology, the forces that many Third World states can 
deploy in the 1990s make regional intervention more costly than in the 1950s. In 
addition, at least a dozen Third World states have developed signiﬁcant arms-export 
industries. Meanwhile, many arms recipients have sought to diversify their purchases 
in order to gain leverage over the major or sole supplier. When arms are supplied from 
outside, the supplier often has leverage through technical assistance, spare parts, and 
replacements. The growth of indigenous arms industries removes that leverage. 
In addition, more countries are acquiring sophisticated weapons capabilities. 
Today, about 20 countries have the capability to make chemical weapons, and by the

10
Soft Power
year 2000, an estimated 15 Third World countries will be producing their own ballistic 
missiles. Five states had the bomb when the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was 
signed in 1968; India, Israel, Pakistan, and South Africa have since developed some 
nuclear capability. Within the next decade, Argentina, Brazil, and several others 
might also develop military nuclear capability. However, a small nuclear capability 
will not make these states contenders for global power; in fact, it may increase the 
risks they face if their neighbors follow suit or if the weapons fall into the hands of 
rebel or terrorist groups. 
On the other hand, nuclear capability would add to these states’ regional power and 
increase the potential costs of regional intervention by larger powers. Technology also 
increases the power of private groups. For instance, hand-held antiaircraft missiles 
helped guerrillas in Afghanistan, and new plastic explosives are effective tools for 
terrorists. The ability of great powers with impressive traditional power resources 
to control their environments is also diminished by the changing nature of issues in 
world politics. Increasingly, the issues today do not pit one state against another; 
instead, they are issues in which all states try to control non-state transnational 
actors. The solutions to many current issues of transnational interdependence will 
require collective action and international cooperation. These include ecological 
changes (acid rain and global warming), health epidemics such as AIDS, illicit trade 
in drugs, and terrorism. Such issues are transnational because they have domestic 
roots and cross international borders. As the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the 
USSR demonstrated, even a domestic issue like the safety of nuclear reactors can 
suddenly become transnational. 
Although force may sometimes play a role, traditional instruments of power 
are rarely sufﬁcient to deal with the new dilemmas of world politics. New power 
resources, such as the capacity for effective communication and for developing and 
using multilateral institutions, may prove more relevant. Moreover, cooperation will 
often be needed from small, weak states that are not fully capable of managing 
their own domestic drug, health, or ecological problems. For example, the United 
States cannot use its traditional power resources to force Peru to curtail the produc-
tion of cocaine if a weak Peruvian government cannot control private gangs of drug 
dealers. And if the U.S. government cannot control the American demand, a transna-
tional market for cocaine will survive. Although the traditional power resources of 
economic assistance and military force can assist in coping with terrorism, prolif-
eration, or drugs, the ability of any great power to control its environment and to 
achieve what it wants is often not as great as traditional hard power indicators would 
suggest. 
The changing nature of international politics has also made intangible forms of 
power more important. National cohesion, universalistic culture, and international 
institutions are taking on additional signiﬁcance. Power is passing from the “capital-
rich” to the “information-rich.” 
Information is becoming more and more plentiful, but the ﬂexibility to act ﬁrst on 
new information is rare. Information becomes power, especially before it spreads. 
Thus, a capacity for timely response to new information is a critical power resource. 
With the rise of an information-based economy, raw materials have become less

Converting Power
11
important and organizational skills and ﬂexibility more important. Product cycles 
are shortening, and technology is moving toward highly ﬂexible production systems, 
in which the craft-era tradition of custom-tailoring products can be incorporated 
into modern manufacturing plants. Japan has been particularly adept at such ﬂexible 
manufacturing processes; the United States and Europe need to do more, and the 
Soviet Union and China lag seriously behind. 
Timely response to information is not only important in manufacturing but also in 
critical services such as ﬁnance, insurance, and transportation. In the past, markets 
were deﬁned by the limits of transportation and communication between buyers and 
sellers. Today, however, the new means of communication convey immediate infor-
mation on market trends to buyers and sellers worldwide. Satellites and ﬁber-optic 
cables instantaneously and continuously link people watching little green screens in 
London, New York, and Tokyo. That China and the Soviet Union do not signiﬁcantly 
participate in these transnational credit markets seriously limits their access to intan-
gible aspects of power. In the 1980s, other governments such as Britain and Japan 
had to follow the United States in the deregulation of money markets and ﬁnancial 
operations in order to preserve their positions in these important markets. 
Intangible changes in knowledge also affect military power. Traditionally, govern-
ments have invested in human espionage. But now major powers like the United 
States and the Soviet Union employ continuous photographic and electronic surveil-
lance from space, providing quick access to a variety of economic, political, and 
military information. Other countries, such as France, are beginning to make low-
resolution satellite information commercially available, but the United States leads 
in high-resolution information. 
Another intangible aspect of power arises from interdependence. The overt distri-
bution of economic resources poorly describes the balance of power between inter-
dependent states. On the one hand, the inﬂuence of the ostensibly stronger state may 
be limited by the greater organization and concentration of its smaller counterpart. 
This difference helps to account for Canada’s surprising success in bargaining with 
the United States. On the other hand, if a relationship is beneﬁcial to both parties, the 
possibility that the weaker side might collapse under pressure limits the leverage of 
the seemingly stronger partner. The “power of the debtor” has long been known: If a 
man owes a bank $10,000, the bank has power over him. But if he owes $100 million, 
he has power over the bank. If Mexico or some Caribbean states became too weak to 
deal with internal poverty or domestic problems, the United States would face a new 
foreign policy agenda involving larger inﬂuxes of migrants, drugs, or contraband. 
Similarly, the failure of developing countries to prevent destruction of their forests 
will affect the global climate; yet those states’ very weakness will diminish other 
countries’ power to inﬂuence them. The current U.S. neglect of weak Third World 
countries may reduce its ability to affect their policies on the new transnational issues. 
The United States will have to devote more attention to the paradoxical power that 
grows out of political and economic chaos and weakness in poor countries.

12
Soft Power
The Changing Face of Power 
These trends suggest a second, more attractive way of exercising power than tradi-
tional means. A state may achieve the outcomes it prefers in world politics because 
other states want to follow it or have agreed to a situation that produces such effects. 
In this sense, it is just as important to set the agenda and structure the situations in 
world politics as to get others to change in particular cases. 
This second aspect of power—which occurs when one country gets other countries 
to want what it wants—might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the 
hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants. 
Parents of teenagers have long known that if they have shaped their child’s beliefs 
and preferences, their power will be greater and more enduring than if they rely only 
on active control. Similarly, political leaders and philosophizers have long understood 
the power of attractive ideas or the ability to set the political agenda and determine the 
framework of debate in a way that shapes others’ preferences. The ability to affect 
what other countries want tends to be associated with intangible power resources 
such as culture, ideology, and institutions. 
Soft co-optive power is just as important as hard command power. If a state can 
make its power seem legitimate in the eyes of others, it will encounter less resistance 
to its wishes. If its culture and ideology are attractive, others will more willingly 
follow. If it can establish international norms consistent with its society, it is less 
likely to have to change. If it can support institutions that make other states wish to 
channel or limit their activities in ways the dominant state prefers, it may be spared 
the costly exercise of coercive or hard power. 
In general, power is becoming less transferable, less coercive, and less tangible. 
Modern trends and changes in political issues are having signiﬁcant effects on the 
nature of power and the resources that produce it. Co-optive power—getting others 
to want what you want—and soft power resources—cultural attraction, ideology, 
and international institutions—are not new. In the early postwar period, the Soviet 
Union proﬁted greatly from such soft resources as communist ideology, the myth 
of inevitability, and transnational communist institutions. Various trends today are 
making co-optive behavior and soft power resources relatively more important. 
Given the changes in world politics, the use of power is becoming less coercive, at 
least among the major states. The current instruments of power range from diplomatic 
notes through economic threats to military coercion. In the earlier periods, the costs 
of such coercion were relatively low. Force was acceptable, and economies were less 
interdependent. Early in this century, the United States sent marines and customs 
agents to collect debts in some Caribbean countries, but under current conditions, 
the direct use of American troops against small countries like Nicaragua carries 
greater costs. 
Manipulation of interdependence under current conditions is also more costly. 
Economic interdependence usually carries beneﬁts in both directions, and threats 
to disrupt a relationship, if carried out, can be very expensive. For example, Japan 
might want the United States to reduce its budget deﬁcit, but threatening to refuse

The Changing Face of Power
13
to buy American Treasury bonds would be likely to disrupt ﬁnancial markets and 
to produce enormous costs for Japan as well as for the United States. Because the 
use of force has become more costly, less threatening forms of power have grown 
increasingly attractive. 
Co-optive power is the ability of a country to structure a situation so that other 
countries develop preferences or deﬁne their interests in ways consistent with its own. 
This power tends to arise from such resources as cultural and ideological attraction as 
well as rules and institutions of international regimes. The United States has more co-
optive power than other countries. Institutions governing the international economy, 
such as the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, tend to embody liberal, free-market principles that coincide in large measure 
with American society and ideology. 
Multinational corporations are another source of co-optive power. British author 
Susan Strange argued in her 1988 book States and Markets that U.S. power in the 
world economy has increased as a result of transnational production: Washington 
may have lost some of its authority over the U.S.-based transnationals, but their 
managers still carry U.S. passports, can be subpoenaed in U.S. courts, and in war or 
national emergency would obey Washington ﬁrst. Meanwhile, the U.S. government 
has gained new authority over a great many foreign corporations inside the United 
States. All of them are acutely aware that the U.S. market is the biggest prize. 
This power arises in part from the fact that 34% of the largest multinational 
corporations are headquartered in the United States (compared to 18% in Japan) and 
in part from the importance of the American market in any global corporate strategy. 
American culture is another relatively inexpensive and useful soft power resource. 
Obviously, certain aspects of American culture are unattractive to other people, and 
there is always danger of bias in evaluating cultural sources of power. But American 
popular culture, embodied in products and communications, has widespread appeal. 
Young Japanese who have never been to the United States wear sports jackets with 
the names of American colleges. Nicaraguan television broadcast American shows 
even while the government fought American-backed guerrillas. Similarly, Soviet 
teenagers wear blue jeans and seek American recordings, and Chinese students used 
a symbol modeled on the Statue of Liberty during the 1989 uprisings. Despite the 
Chinese government’s protests against U.S. interference, Chinese citizens were as 
interested as ever in American democracy and culture. 
Of course, there is an element of triviality and fad in popular behavior, but it 
is also true that a country that stands astride popular channels of communication 
has more opportunities to get its messages across and to affect the preferences of 
others. According to past studies by the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc, and 
Cultural Organization, the United States has been exporting about seven times as 
many television shows as the next largest exporter (Britain) and has had the only 
global network for ﬁlm distribution. Although American ﬁlms account for only 6– 
7% of all ﬁlms made, they occupy about 50% of world screen time. In 1981, the 
United States was responsible for 80% of worldwide transmission and processing of 
data. The American language has become the lingua franca of the global economy.

14
Soft Power
Although Japanese consumer products and cuisine have recently become more 
fashionable, they seem less associated with an implicit appeal to a broader set of 
values than American domination of popular communication. The success of Japan’s 
manufacturing sector provides it with an important source of soft power, but Japan is 
somewhat limited by the inward orientation of its culture. While Japan has been 
extraordinarily successful in accepting foreign technology, it has been far more 
reluctant to accept foreigners. Japan’s relations with China, for example, have been 
hampered by cultural insensitivities. Many Japanese are concerned about their lack 
of “internationalization” and their failure to project a broader message. 
While Americans can also be parochial and inward-oriented, the openness of 
the American culture to various ethnicities and the American values of democracy 
and human rights exert international inﬂuence. West European countries also derive 
soft power from their democratic institutions, but America’s relative openness to 
immigrants compared to Japan and Europe is an additional source of strength. As 
European scholar Ralf Dahrendorf has observed, it is “relevant that millions of people 
all over the world would wish to live in the United States and that indeed people are 
prepared to risk their lives in order to get there.” Maintaining this appeal is important. 
In June 1989, after President George Bush criticized the Chinese government for 
killing student protesters in China, ordinary Chinese seemed more supportive of the 
United States than ever before. Subsequently, by sending a delegation of too high a 
level to Beijing to seek reconciliation, Bush squandered some of those soft power 
resources. When ideals are an important source of power, the classic distinction 
between realpolitik and liberalism becomes blurred. The realist who focuses only on 
the balance of hard power will miss the power of transnational ideas. 
Americans are rightly concerned about the future shape of a post-Cold War world, 
but it is a mistake to portray the problem as American decline rather than diffusion 
of power. Even so, concern about decline might be good for the United States if it 
cut through complacency and prodded Americans to deal with some of their serious 
domestic problems. However, pollsters ﬁnd that excessive anxiety about decline turns 
American opinion toward nationalistic and protectionist policies that could constrain 
the U.S. ability to cope with issues created by growing international interdependence. 
There is no virtue in either overstatement or understatement of American strength. 
The former leads to failure to adapt, the latter to inappropriate responses such as 
treating Japan as the new enemy in place of the Soviet Union. 
As the world’s wealthiest country, the United States should be able to pay for 
both its international commitments and its domestic investments. America is rich but 
through its political process acts poor. In real terms, GNP is more than twice what 
it was in 1960, but Americans today spend much less of their GNP on international 
leadership. The prevailing view is “we can’t afford it,” despite the fact that U.S. taxes 
represent a smaller percentage of gross domestic product than those of other advanced 
industrial countries. This suggests a problem of domestic political leadership rather 
than long-term economic decline. 
As has happened many times before, the mix of resources that shapes international 
power is changing. But that does not mean that the world must expect the cycle of 
hegemonic conﬂict with its attendant World Wars to repeat itself. The United States

The Changing Face of Power

retains more traditional hard power resources than any other country. It also has the 
soft ideological and institutional resources to preserve its lead in the new domains 
of transnational interdependence. In this sense, the situation is quite different from 
that of Britain at the century’s beginning. Loose historical analogies and falsely 
deterministic political theories are worse than merely academic; they may distract 
Americans from the true issues confronting them. The problem for U.S. power after 
the Cold War will be less the new challengers for hegemony than the new challenges 
of transnational interdependence.

The Limits of Soft Power 
Originally published as 
part of Soft Power: 
The Means to Succeed in 
World Politics, 2004. 
While important, soft power may be less relevant than hard power in preventing 
attack, policing borders, and protecting allies, however, soft power is particularly 
relevant to the realization of “milieu goals.” Moreover, governments are not in full 
control of the attraction—much of American soft power has been produced by Holly-
wood, Harvard, Microsoft, and Michael Jordan. In a liberal society, government 
cannot and should not control the culture. 
Some skeptics object to the idea of soft power because they think of power narrowly 
in terms of commands or active control. In their view, imitation or attraction is simply 
that, not power. As we have seen, some imitation or attraction does not produce much 
power over policy outcomes, and neither does imitation always produce desirable 
outcomes. For example, in the 1980s, Japan was widely admired for its innovative 
industrial processes, but imitation by companies in other countries came back to 
haunt the Japanese when it reduced their market power. Similarly, armies frequently 
imitate and therefore nullify the successful tactics of their opponents and make it 
more difﬁcult for them to achieve the outcomes they want. Such observations are 
correct, but they miss the point that exerting attraction on others often does allow you 
to get what you want. The skeptics who want to deﬁne power only as deliberate acts 
of command and control are ignoring the second, or “structural,” face of power—the 
ability to get the outcomes you want without having to force people to change their 
behavior through threats or payments. 
At the same time, it is important to specify the conditions under which attrac-
tion is more likely to lead to desired outcomes, and under which it will not. As we 
have seen, popular culture is more likely to attract people and produce soft power in

the sense of preferred outcomes in situations where cultures are somewhat similar 
rather than widely dissimilar. All power depends on context—who relates to whom 
under what circumstances—but soft power depends more than hard power upon 
the existence of willing interpreters and receivers. Moreover, attraction often has a 
diffuse effect, creating general inﬂuence rather than producing an easily observable 
speciﬁc action. Just as money can be invested, politicians speak of storing up polit-
ical capital to be drawn on in the future circumstances. Of course, such goodwill 
may not ultimately be honored, and diffuse reciprocity is less tangible than an imme-
diate exchange. Nonetheless, the indirect effects of attraction and a diffuse inﬂuence 
can make a signiﬁcant difference in obtaining favorable outcomes in bargaining 
situations. Otherwise leaders would insist only on immediate payoffs and speciﬁc 
reciprocity, and we know that is not always the way they behave. Social psychologists 
have developed a substantial body of empirical research exploring the relationship 
between attractiveness and power.1 
Soft power is also likely to be more important when power is dispersed in another 
country rather than concentrated. A dictator cannot be totally indifferent to the views 
of the people in his country, but he can often ignore whether another country is 
popular or not when he calculates whether it is in his interests to be helpful. In 
democracies where public opinion and parliaments matter, political leaders have less 
leeway to adopt tactics and strike deals than in autocracies. Thus, it was impossible 
for the Turkish government to permit the transport of American troops across the 
country in 2003 because American policies had greatly reduced our popularity in 
public opinion and in the parliament. In contrast, it was far easier for the United States 
to obtain the use of bases in authoritarian Uzbekistan for operations in Afghanistan. 
Finally, though soft power sometimes has direct effects on speciﬁc goals—witness 
the inability of the United States to obtain the votes of Chile or Mexico in the 
UN Security Council in 2003 after our policies reduced our popularity—it is more 
likely to have an impact on the general goals that a country seeks.2 Fifty years ago, 
Arnold Wolfers distinguished between the speciﬁc “possession goals” that countries 
pursue, and their broader “milieu goals,” like shaping an environment conducive to 
democracy.3 Successful pursuit of both types of goals is important in foreign policy. 
If one considers various American national interests, for example, soft power may be 
less relevant than hard power in preventing attack, policing borders, and protecting 
allies. But soft power is particularly relevant to the realization of “milieu goals.” It 
has a crucial role to play in promoting democracy, human rights, and open markets. 
It is easier to attract people to democracy than to coerce them to be democratic. The 
fact that the impact of attraction on achieving preferred outcomes varies by context 
and type of goals does not make it irrelevant, any more than the fact that bombs and

bayonets do not help when we seek to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, slow 
global warming, or create democracy. 
Other skeptics object to using the term “soft power” in international politics 
because governments are not in full control of the attraction. Much of American soft 
power has been produced by Hollywood, Harvard, Microsoft, and Michael Jordan. 
But the fact that civil society is the origin of much soft power does not disprove its 
existence. In a liberal society, government cannot and should not control the culture. 
Indeed, the absence of policies of control can itself be a source of attraction. The 
Czech ﬁlm director Milos Forman recounts that when the Communist government let 
in the American ﬁlm Twelve Angry Men because of its harsh portrait of American 
institutions, Czech intellectuals responded by thinking, “If that country can make 
this kind of thing, ﬁlms about itself, oh, that country must have a pride and must 
have an inner strength, and must be strong enough and must be free.”4 
It is true that ﬁrms, universities, foundations, churches, and other non-
governmental groups develop soft power of their own that may reinforce or be at 
odds with ofﬁcial foreign policy goals. That is all the more reason for governments 
to make sure that their own actions and policies reinforce rather than undercut their 
soft power. And this is particularly true since private sources of soft power are likely 
to become increasingly important in the global information age. 
Finally, some skeptics argue that popularity measured by opinion polls is 
ephemeral and thus not to be taken seriously. Of course, one must be careful not 
to read too much into opinion polls. They are an essential but imperfect measure of 
soft power resources because answers vary depending on the way that questions are 
formulated, and unless the same questions are asked consistently over some period, 
they represent snapshots rather than a continuous picture. Opinions can change, and 
such volatility cannot be captured by any one poll. Moreover, political leaders must 
often make unpopular decisions because they are the right thing to do, and hope 
that their popularity may be repaired if the decision is subsequently proved correct. 
Popularity is not an end in itself in foreign policy. Nonetheless, polls are a good 
ﬁrst approximation of both how attractive a country appears and the costs that are 
incurred by unpopular policies, particularly when they show consistency across polls 
and over time. And as we shall see in the next chapter, that attractiveness can have

State Smart Power Strategies 
Originally published as part of 
The Future of Power by 
Public Affairs Press in 2011. 
The world is neither unipolar, multipolar, nor chaotic—it is all three at the same time. 
Thus, a smart grand strategy must be able to handle very different distributions of 
power in different domains and understand the trade-offs among them. The concept of 
“smart power” is essentially the intelligent integration and networking of diplomacy, 
defense, development, and other tools of so-called “hard and soft” power. 
“The concept of ‘smart power’—the intelligent integration and networking of diplo-
macy, defense, development, and other tools of so-called ‘hard and soft’ power—is at 
the very heart of President Obama and Secretary Clinton’s policy vision.”1 Because 
the term has been adopted by the Obama administration, some analysts think it refers 
only to the United States, and critics complain that it is merely a slogan like “tough 
love” that sugarcoats nasty stuff. But, even though the term “smart power” lends 
itself to slogans (no one wants to be “dumb,” though counterproductive strategies 
ﬁt that description), smart power can also be used for analysis and is by no means 
limited to the United States. 
Small states are often adept at smart power strategies. Singapore has invested 
enough in its military resources to make itself appear indigestible in the eyes of 
neighbors it wishes to deter, but it has combined this approach with active sponsorship 
of diplomatic activities in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as 
efforts to have its universities serve as the hubs of networks of nongovernmental 
activities in the region. Switzerland long used the combination of mandatory military

service and mountainous geography as resources for deterrence, while making itself 
attractive to others through banking, commercial, and cultural networks. Qatar, a 
small peninsula off the coast of Saudi Arabia, allowed its territory to be used as the 
headquarters for the American military in the invasion of Iraq, while at the same time 
sponsoring Al Jazeera, the most popular television station in the region, which was 
highly critical of American actions. Norway joined NATO for defense but developed 
forward-leaning policies on overseas development assistance and peace mediation 
to increase its soft power above what would otherwise be the case. 
Historically, rising states have used smart power strategies to good avail. In the 
nineteenth century, Otto von Bismarck’s Prussia employed an aggressive military 
strategy to defeat Denmark, Austria, and France in three wars that led to the uniﬁca-
tion of Germany, but once Bismarck had accomplished that goal by 1870, he adapted 
German diplomacy to create alliances with neighbors and make Berlin the hub of 
European diplomacy and conﬂict resolution. One of the Kaiser’s great mistakes two 
decades later was to ﬁre Bismarck, fail to renew his “reinsurance treaty” diplomacy 
with Russia, and challenge Britain for naval supremacy on the high seas. After the 
Meiji Restoration, Japan built the military strength that enabled it to defeat Russia 
in 1905, but it also followed a conciliatory diplomatic policy toward Britain and the 
United States and spent considerable resources to make itself attractive overseas.2 
After the failure of its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity imperial scheme of the 1930s 
(which had a soft power component of anti-European propaganda) and defeat in 
World War II, Japan turned to a strategy that minimized military power and relied on 
an American alliance. Its single-minded focus on economic growth was successful 
on that dimension, but it developed only modest military and soft power. 
China under Mao built its military strength (including nuclear weapons) and used 
the soft power of Maoist revolutionary doctrine and Third World solidarity to culti-
vate allies abroad, but after the exhaustion of the Maoist strategy in the 1970s, 
Chinese leaders turned to market mechanisms to foster economic development. Deng 
warned his compatriots to eschew external adventures that might jeopardize this 
internal development. In 2007, President Hu proclaimed the importance of investing 
in China’s soft power. From the point of view of a country that was making enormous 
strides in economic and military power, this was a smart strategy. By accompanying 
the rise of its hard power with efforts to make itself more attractive, China aimed to 
reduce the fear and tendencies to balance Chinese power that might otherwise grow 
among its neighbors. 
In 2009, China was justly proud of its success in managing to emerge from the 
world recession with a high rate of economic growth. Many Chinese concluded that 
this represented a shift in the world balance of power and that the United States was 
in decline. One dated the year 2000 as the peak of American power. “People are 
now looking down on the West, from leadership circles, to academia, to everyday

and National Assets of Japan and the United States (Armonk, NY: M. E. Sharpe, 2008).

folks,” said Professor Kang Xiaoguong of Renmin University.3 But, such narratives 
can lead to conﬂict. Overconﬁdence in power assessment (combined with insecurity 
in domestic affairs) led to more assertive Chinese foreign policy behavior in the latter 
part of 2009. Some observers wondered if China was beginning to deviate from the 
smart strategy of a rising power and violating the wisdom of Deng, who advised that 
China should proceed cautiously and “skillfully keep a low proﬁle.”4 
Dominant states also have incentives to combine hard and soft power resources. 
Empires are easier to rule when they rest on the soft power of attraction as well 
as the hard power of coercion. Rome allowed conquered elites to aspire to Roman 
citizenship, and France coopted African leaders such as Leopold Senghor into French 
political and cultural life. Victorian Britain used expositions and culture to attract 
elites from the empire, and as we saw earlier, it was able to rule a vast empire in large 
part with locals and very few British troops. Of course, this became progressively 
more difﬁcult as rising nationalism changed the context and eroded the soft power of 
the British Empire. The development of the British Commonwealth of Nations was 
an effort to maintain a residual of that soft power in the new postcolonial context. 
A state’s “grand strategy” is its leaders’ theory and story about how to provide 
for its security, welfare, and identity (“life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” in 
Jefferson’s terms), and that strategy has to be adjusted for changes in context. Too 
rigid an approach to strategy can be counterproductive. Strategy is not some mystical 
possession at the top of government. It can be applied at all levels.5 A country must 
have a general game plan, but it also must remain ﬂexible in the face of events. In the 
words of one historian, a sound grand strategy is “an equation of ends and means so 
sturdy that it triumphs despite serial setbacks at the level of strategy, operations, and 
campaigns.”6 Some American analysts of the post-Cold War world look for narratives 
that can be reduced to bumper stickers, such as “containment” served in the past. 
They forget that the same slogan covered policies that sometimes conﬂicted with 
each other.7 For some, containment justiﬁed the Vietnam War ; for George Kennan, 
author of the strategy, it did not. More important than simple formulas or clever 
slogans is the contextual intelligence that leads to accurate assessment of trends in 
power and thinking ahead about smart policy responses.8

As we have seen, academics, pundits, and presidents have often been mistaken 
in their assessment of America’s position in the world. For example, two decades 
ago the conventional wisdom was that the United States was in decline, suffering 
from imperial overstretch. A decade later, with the end of the Cold War, the new 
conventional wisdom was that the world was a unipolar American hegemony. Some 
observers concluded that the United States was so powerful that it could decide 
what it thought was right and others would have no choice but to follow. Charles 
Krauthammer celebrated this view as “the new unilateralism,” and this narrative of 
dominance heavily inﬂuenced the Bush administration even before the shock of the 
attacks on September 11, 2001, produced a new “Bush Doctrine” of preventive war 
and coercive democratization.9 But, the new unilateralism was based on a profound 
misunderstanding of the nature of power in world politics and the context under 
which the possession of preponderant resources will produce preferred outcomes. 
What are the main features of the current world environment, and how are they 
changing?10 I have likened the context of politics today to a three-dimensional chess 
game in which interstate military power is highly concentrated in the United States; 
interstate economic power is distributed in a multipolar manner among the United 
States, the EU, Japan, and the BRICs, and power over transnational issues such 
as climate change, crime, terror, and pandemics is highly diffused. Assessing the 
distribution of resources among actors varies with each domain. The world is neither 
unipolar, multipolar, nor chaotic—it is all three at the same time. Thus, a smart grand 
strategy must be able to handle very different distributions of power in different 
domains and understand the trade-offs among them. It makes no more sense to 
see the world through a purely realist lens that focuses only on the top chessboard 
or a liberal institutional lens that looks primarily at the other boards. Contextual 
intelligence today requires a new synthesis of “liberal realism” that looks at all three 
boards at the same time. After all, in a three-level game, a player who focuses on 
only one board is bound to lose in the long run. 
That will require an understanding of how to exercise power with as well as power 
over other states. On issues arising on the top board of interstate military relations, 
an understanding of ways to form alliances and balance power will remain crucial.
evolving environment and to capitalize on trends in changing markets. In foreign policy, contextual 
intelligence is the intuitive diagnostic skill that helps align tactics with objectives to create smart 
strategies in varying situations. On the attributes and dimensions of contextual intelligence, see

But, the best order of military battle will do little good in solving many of the prob-
lems on the bottom chessboard of non-state actors and transnational threats, such 
as pandemics or climate change, even though these issues can present threats to the 
security of millions of people on the order of magnitude of military threats that tradi-
tionally drive national strategies. Such issues will require cooperation, institutions, 
and pursuit of public goods from which all can beneﬁt and none can be excluded. 
Theorists of hegemony have looked at issues of transition and the prospects of 
conﬂict, but they have also examined the beneﬁcial effects of hegemony on the 
provision of public goods. This led to a theory of hegemonic stability. Public goods 
from which all can beneﬁt are underproduced because the incentives to invest in their 
production are reduced by the inability to prevent others from enjoying the beneﬁts 
without paying for their production. If everyone has an incentive to “free-ride,” no 
one has an incentive to invest. The exception may be situations where one state is so 
much larger than the others that it will notice the beneﬁts of its investment in public 
goods even if smaller states free-ride. In this “case for Goliath,”11 hegemonic states 
are necessary for global governance and must take the lead in production of global 
public goods because smaller states lack the incentives or capacity to do so. 
When the largest states do not step up to the task, the results can be disastrous 
for the international system. For example, when the United States replaced Britain 
as the world’s leading ﬁnancial and trading state after World War I, it did not live 
up to these obligations, and that failure contributed to the onset and severity of the 
Great Depression. Some analysts worry about a repeat of that experience.12 As China 
approaches the United States in its share of the distribution of economic resources, 
will it assume the role of responsible stakeholder (to use the phrase developed by the 
Bush administration), or will it continue to free-ride as the United States did in the 
interwar period? 
Fortunately, hegemonic preponderance is not the only way to produce global 
public goods. Robert Keohane argues that it is possible to design international insti-
tutions to solve problems of coordination and free riding in the period “after hege-
mony.”13 Moreover, as other theorists have pointed out, hegemonic stability theory 
is an oversimpliﬁcation because pure public goods are rare, and large governments 
can often exclude some countries from some of the beneﬁts they provide.14 Some 
broad goods, such as security or trade agreements, can be turned into “club goods” 
that beneﬁt many but from which some can be excluded. 
Global government is unlikely in the twenty-ﬁrst century, but degrees of global 
governance already exist. The world has hundreds of treaties, institutions, and

regimes for governing areas of interstate behavior ranging from telecommunications, 
civil aviation, ocean dumping, trade, and even the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
But, such institutions are rarely self-sufﬁcient. They still beneﬁt from the leadership 
of great powers. And it remains to be seen whether the largest countries in the twenty-
ﬁrst century will live up to this role. As the power of China and India increases, how 
will their behavior in this dimension change? Some, such as liberal scholar John 
Ikenberry, argue that the current set of global institutions are sufﬁciently open and 
adaptable that China will ﬁnd it in its own interests to be coopted into them.15 Others 
believe that China will wish to impose its own mark and create its own international 
institutional system as its power increases. Ironically, for those who foresee a tripolar 
world at mid-century composed of the United States, China, and India, all three of 
these large powers are among the most protective of their sovereignty and the most 
reluctant to accept a post-Westphalian world. 
Even if the EU retains a leading role in world politics and pushes for more insti-
tutional innovation, it is unlikely that, barring a disaster such as World War II, the 
world will see “a constitutional moment” such as it experienced with the creation of 
the UN system of institutions after 1945. Today, as a universal institution the United 
Nations plays a crucial role in legitimization, crisis diplomacy, peacekeeping, and 
humanitarian missions, but its very size has proven to be a disadvantage for many 
other functions. For example, as the 2009 UN Framework Conference on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) at Copenhagen demonstrated, meetings of nearly two hundred 
states are often unwieldy and subject to bloc politics and tactical moves by players 
that are largely extraneous because they otherwise lack resources to solve functional 
problems. 
One of the dilemmas of multilateral diplomacy is how to get everyone into the 
act and still get action. The answer is likely to lie in what Europeans have dubbed 
“variable geometry.” There will be many multilateralisms that will vary with the 
distribution of power resources in different issues. For instance, on monetary affairs 
the Bretton Woods conference created the International Monetary Fund in 1944, and 
it has since expanded to include 186 nations, but the preeminence of the dollar was the 
crucial feature of monetary cooperation until the 1970s. After the weakening of the 
dollar and President Nixon’s ending of its convertibility into gold, France convened 
a small group of ﬁve countries in 1975 to meet in the library of the Chateau of 
Rambouillet to discuss monetary affairs.16 It soon grew to the Group of Seven and 
later broadened in scope and membership to the Group of Eight (which included 
Russia and a vast bureaucratic and press attendance). Subsequently, the Group of 
Eight began the practice of inviting ﬁve guests from the BRICs and other countries. 
In the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, this framework evolved into a new Group of 20, with 
a more inclusive membership.

Summits (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1984).

27
At the same time, the Group of Seven continued to meet at the ministerial level 
on a narrower monetary agenda; new institutions such as the Financial Stability 
Board were created, and bilateral discussions between the United States and China 
continued to play an important role. As one experienced diplomat puts it, “If you’re 
trying to negotiate an exchange rate deal with 20 countries or a bailout of Mexico, 
as in the early Clinton days, with 20 countries, that’s not easy. If you get above 10, 
it just makes it too darn hard to get things done.”17 After all, with 3 players, there 
are 3 pairs of relationships; with 10 players, there are 45; with 100 players, there are 
nearly 5000. Or to take issues of climate change, the UNFCCC will continue to play 
a role, but more intensive negotiations are likely to occur in smaller forums where 
fewer than a dozen countries account for 80% of greenhouse gas emissions.18 
Much of the work of global governance will rely on formal and informal networks. 
Network organizations (such as the G-20) are used for agenda setting and consensus-
building, policy coordination, knowledge exchange, and norm-setting.19 Centrality 
in networks can be a source of power, but “the power that ﬂows from this type 
of connectivity is not the power to impose outcomes. Networks are not directed 
and controlled as much as they are managed and orchestrated. Multiple players are 
integrated into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts”20 —in other words, 
the network provides power to achieve preferred outcomes with other players rather 
than over them. We saw that power in networks can come from both strong ties 
and weak ties. Strong ties, such as alliances, “multiply a nation’s power through 
everything from basing rights, intelligence sharing, weapons system collaborations 
and purchases, and shared military deployments to support in multilateral institutions, 
mutual trade beneﬁts and mutual security guarantees.” And weak ties, such as global 
multilateral institutions, “for all of their manifest deﬁciencies … still matter, and a 
nation cannot be a great power without at least having a signiﬁcant voice as the UN, 
the IMF, and the World Bank.”21 In this dimension, predictions of an Asian century 
remain premature; the United States will remain more central in a dense global web 
of governance than other countries.

Understanding Twenty-First Century 
Power Shifts 
Originally published in the 
June 24, 2011 edition of 
the European Financial 
Review. 
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States was the sole global superpower 
for a time, but this was not to last. The increased inﬂuence of developing countries, not 
least of which China, altered power shifts yet again, and by the twenty-ﬁrst century, 
the shift in power from West to East was unstoppable. Here, we examine how those 
shifts had taken shape as the world entered a new century and new millennium. 
There are two big power shifts going on in the twenty-ﬁrst century. One is among 
countries, from West to East, and the other is from governments to non-governmental 
actors, regardless of whether it is East or West. I call the ﬁrst of these power transition 
and the second, power diffusion. 
The issue of power transition is sometimes called the rise of Asia, but it should 
more properly be called the recovery of Asia because if one looked at the world 
in 1750, one would see that Asia was more than half of the world population and 
represented more than half of the world’s product. By 1900, Asia was still more than 
half of the world’s population, but it declined to only 20% of the world’s products. 
What we will see in this twenty-ﬁrst century is the recovery of Asia to its normal 
proportions, with more than half of the world’s population and more than half of the 
world’s products. This starts, of course, with Japan after the Meiji Revolution, and 
it continues with the smaller countries like Korea, Singapore, Malaysia. Now it is 
focused on China, but it is also going to include India. India now has growth rates of 
8–9% a year. We should see during the course of the twenty-ﬁrst century Asia as a

whole recovering to about what one would think would be normal proportions. That 
is power transition. 
Power diffusion is best understood in terms of the way technologies, and particu-
larly information technology, are affecting the costs of participating in international 
affairs. The price of computing power declined a thousand-fold from 1970 to 2000. 
That is an extraordinary number. If the price of an automobile had declined as rapidly 
as the price of computing power, one could buy an automobile today for 5 Euros. 
And when the price of something declines that rapidly, it removes the barriers to 
entry. Now others can do what previously was reserved just to governments or big 
corporations. If you wanted to communicate instantaneously from Moscow to New 
York to Brussels to Johannesburg to Riyadh in 1970, you could do it technologically, 
but it was very expensive. Now, anybody can do it, and it is virtually free. 
What this means is that things once restricted to very large organizations like 
governments or corporations are now available to anyone, and this has a signiﬁcant 
impact on world politics. It does not mean that the governments are being replaced or 
that the nation-state is obsolete. Rather, it means that the stage on which governments 
act is now crowded with many more smaller actors. Some of those smaller actors are 
benign—for example, Oxfam, which serves to relieve poverty—and some of them 
are malign such as Al Qaeda, which is trying to kill people. But, the main point is 
that it produces a new type of international politics, and we have not yet begun to 
understand this. We need to realize that in an age in which information technology 
is so powerful and important, it may often be the case that it is not only whose army 
wins, but whose story wins, and that the ability to create an effective narrative is 
crucial. 
Consider the problem of terrorism. Terrorists have very little military power, but 
they have a lot of soft power, a lot of power over narrative. Bin Laden did not point 
a gun at the heads of the people who ﬂew into the World Trade Center. He did not 
pay them. He attracted them by his narrative of an Islam under threat and the need 
to purify Islam. As we try to cope with this problem, we may make the mistake of 
thinking that we can solve this by hard power alone. 
Power is the ability to affect others to produce the outcomes you want, you could 
do this through coercion and threats, so-called “sticks.” You could do it with payments 
we call “carrots.” Or you could do it with attraction and persuasion which is “soft 
power.” In an information age, the role of soft power is increasing in its importance. 
The famous British historian A.J.P. Taylor, who wrote a book about the struggle for 
mastery of Europe in the nineteenth century, deﬁned a great power as a country that 
was able to prevail in war. But, we have to go beyond that limited way of thinking 
about what power means in the twenty-ﬁrst century, and see it as much more three 
dimensional, including not only military power but also economic power and also 
soft power. 
Regarding the issue of power transition from West to East, one of the questions 
that is being raised nowadays is whether China will pass the United States, and some 
Chinese scholars have written about America in decline. Russian president Dmitri 
Medvedev said the ﬁnancial crisis was the beginning of the end of American power. 
And there is a certain mood of pessimism in the United States right now because 
of the economic problems following the recession. Many Americans now think the

country is in decline, but before one takes that too seriously, one should note that 
after the Soviets put up the Sputnik satellite in 1957, Americans thought America 
was in decline, and the Soviet Union was going to prevail. In 1971, when President 
Richard Nixon closed the gold window, there was a feeling that this was the end 
of American power. In the 1980s, when Japan was doing so well and the yen was 
strong, there were Americans who saw this as the end of American power. 
Americans go through these cycles of psychology, but it does not tell one much 
about changing power resources. If one looks carefully at power resources, the 
United States is likely to remain more powerful than China for the next few decades. 
Goldman Sachs, the investment company, has projected that if China grows at its 
current rate and the United States grows at its current rate, the Chinese economy will 
be equal in size to the American economy in 2027. It is plausible that the Chinese 
economy would be as large as the American economy even sooner than that. China 
is a big country, and it is growing rapidly. But, even when the Chinese economy is 
equal in size to the American economy, it would not be equal in composition. That 
one judges more by per capita income, which is a better measure of the sophistication 
of an economy, and when China equals the Americans in overall economic size, it 
will only be one-third of the United States in per capita income. 
In addition, when we think of power in comparing China and the United States, 
one should not think only of economic power. If you look at military power, the 
United States is likely to remain much more powerful on a global basis than China. 
China is now building an aircraft carrier, but there is a huge difference between 
having an aircraft carrier and having eleven carrier battle groups. Then, ﬁnally, there 
is the issue of soft power. China is very interested in increasing its soft power. Hu 
Jintao told the 17th Party Congress that China needed to invest in its soft power, and 
they are making major efforts, spending billions of dollars on Confucius institutes, 
and international broadcasting. 
But, a recent BBC poll shows that China is not doing as well in soft power as the 
United States. Basically, China is going to have trouble increasing its soft power until 
it realizes that much of soft power comes from civil society, not from government. 
And government broadcasting is often not trusted because it is the government. It 
is informal social contacts that are created across societies that are most effective in 
generating soft power. China did more damage to its soft power by its reaction to Liu 
Xiaobo and the Nobel Prize than it gained from the Olympics and Shanghai Expo. 
The fear that China is about to pass the United States in any of these three dimen-
sions of power is excessive. Why does it matter? Power is not good or bad per se. 
Too much power can be bad. It can lead you to hubris and mistaken strategy. It is 
very important to have accurate perceptions about the distribution of power. When 
people are too worried about power, they may overreact or follow strategies that are 
dangerous. The Peloponnesian War in which the Greek city-state system tore itself 
apart was caused by the rise in the power of Athens and the fear it created in Sparta. 
Similarly, World War I, which destroyed the centrality of the European state system 
in the world, is often said to have been caused by the rise in power of Germany and 
the fear that created in Britain. 
Some analysts predict that will be the story of power in the twenty-ﬁrst century: 
The rise in the power of China will create fear in the United States which will lead

32
Understanding Twenty-First Century Power Shifts
to a great conﬂict, but that is bad history and a poor understanding of power for our 
century. By 1900, Germany had already passed Britain in industrial strength. In my 
book The Future of Power, I show the basis for arguing that China is not going to 
equal the United States for another two decades or more, if then. In other words, the 
US has more time than Britain had, and it does not have to be as fearful. If we are too 
fearful, we may overreact. The danger I see that is the Chinese thinking America is 
in decline push too hard and Americans, fearing the rise of China, overreact. That is 
the danger we face in power transition, and the best way to avoid that is by having a 
very clear-eyed view of all three dimensions of power and how it is changing and the 
fact that we do not have to be fearful. There is time to encourage China to become 
what Robert Zoellick called, a “responsible stakeholder.” 
The other reason why it is important not to be too fearful is the diffusion of 
power. What we are seeing is that both China and the United States, and of course 
Europe, Japan, and others, will be facing a new set of transnational challenges, issues 
like climate change, transnational terrorism, cyberinsecurity, pandemics. All these 
issues, which are going to be increasing in the future, are going to require cooperation. 
They cannot be solved by any one country alone, so to talk about the world being 
multipolar or unipolar makes no sense at all when one is talking about these issues. 
And it is interesting that if one looks at the National Security Strategy of the Obama 
administration which was issued in May 2010, it refers to the fact that we have to 
think of power as positive-sum, not just zero-sum. In other words, there may be times 
when it is good for the United States, good for Europe, if Chinese power increases. 
Take, for example, Chinese power to control their emissions, the one area where 
China is a superpower. We should be eager to strengthen and help China to increase 
its capacities in that area. This is win–win. 
Many of these new transnational challenges that we face are areas where we have 
to get away from just thinking about power over others and think about power with 
others. That is another reason why we do not want to become so fearful that we are 
not able to have cooperation with China. We are facing a world which is going to be 
quite different in the twenty-ﬁrst century than the world of the nineteenth or twentieth 
century that A.J.P. Taylor wrote about when he deﬁned a great power as a country 
able to prevail in war. We are going to have to learn to combine our hard power 
resources—the military and economic—with soft power resources into successful 
strategies of smart power. 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has referred to Obama administration policy as 
based on smart power. And indeed she has said we should not talk about multipolarity; 
we should talk about multipartnerships. This is a different approach to the future of 
power in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Or another way of putting it, the American president 
Franklin Roosevelt at the time of the Great Depression said, “We have nothing to fear 
but fear itself.” Perhaps as we turn to the twenty-ﬁrst century, we should say one of 
the things that is most worrisome is fear itself. If we can keep a balanced appraisal of 
the distribution of power, and ﬁgure out ways to deal with these common challenges 
that we face—we, meaning the United States, China, Europe, Japan and others—we 
can indeed have a win–win situation. That is the message of my new book: We need 
to get away from our old ways of thinking about power and broaden our ways of 
thinking to accommodate the changes that are going to occur in this twenty-ﬁrst 
century.

Soft Power: The Origins and Political 
Progress of a Concept 
Originally published as part of 
Soft power: the Origins and Political 
Progress of a Concept by 
Palgrave Communications in 2017. 
The gradual acceptance of soft power as a legitimate tool for states to exercise their 
political muscle provided the concept with more clout. From the Europe to the US, 
and ultimately China, the attractiveness of the concept increased, but interpretations 
and applications of it remain varied. 
I coined the term “soft power” in my 1990 book Bound to Lead that challenged the 
then conventional view of the decline of American power.1 After looking at American 
military and economic power resources, I felt that something was still missing—the 
ability to affect others by attraction and persuasion rather than just coercion and 
payment. At that time, there was a prevalent belief that the United States was in 
decline, and Paul Kennedy’s The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers was a New 
York Times best seller.2 Kennedy argued that the US was suffering from “imperial 
overstretch” and would soon go the way of seventeenth-century Spain or Edwardian 
Britain. Many others echoed these thoughts and believed that the Soviet Union was 
passing us in military might and Japan was overtaking us in economic strength. I 
doubted this conventional wisdom and went to many seminars and conferences where 
I was a lonely dissenter. 
Both academics and practitioners in international relations tended to treat power 
as tangible resources you could drop on your foot or drop on a city. This was less

true of classical realists like Carr,3 but particularly true of neorealist theorists such 
as Kenneth Waltz and his followers who became fashionable in the 1970s.4 Every-
thing was coercion and payments, but sometimes people inﬂuence others by ideas 
and attraction that sets the agenda for others or gets them to want what you want. 
Then carrots and sticks are less necessary or can be used more frugally because 
others see them as legitimate. With its universalistic values, open culture and vast 
popular cultural resources ranging from Hollywood to foundations and universities, 
the United States seemed uniquely placed to affect how others viewed the world and 
us. Of course, it did not make us attractive to everyone. Quite the contrary, as the 
Mullahs in Iran proved. But where we were attractive, it was a huge advantage. As 
one Norwegian scholar put it, if the Americans had created an empire in Europe, 
it was an “empire by invitation.”5 I tried a variety of terms to try to summarize 
these thoughts and eventually settled on the term “soft power.” I hoped its slightly 
oxymoronic resonance in the traditional discourse of my ﬁeld might make people 
think again about their assumptions when they spoke of power. 
I thought of soft power as an analytic concept to ﬁll a deﬁciency in the way analysts 
thought about power, but it gradually took on political resonance. In some ways, the 
underlying thought is not new, and similar concepts can be traced back to ancient 
philosophers. Moreover, though I developed the term soft power in the context of 
my work on American power, it is not restricted to international behavior or to the 
United States. As I became interested in leadership studies, I applied the concept to 
individuals and organizations in my 2008 book The Powers to Lead.6 Nonetheless, 
it has taken particular root in international relations, and as the European Union 
developed, more European leaders began to refer to its soft power. The term was less 
used, however, by American political leaders. 
In 2002, I was one of two keynote speakers at a conference organized by the 
Army in Washington. I spoke to the assembled generals about soft power and, by 
their questions, they seemed to get it. Later, one of the generals asked the other 
keynote speaker, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, what he thought of soft 
power. He replied that he did not understand what soft power meant, and that was 
evident in his policies. This hubris was evident well before the security drama that 
followed the terrorist attacks on 9/11, but in that climate of fear, it was difﬁcult to 
speak about soft power, even though attracting moderates away from appeals by 
radicals is a key component of any effective counterterrorism strategy. 
In that climate, and with the invasion of Iraq proving disastrous, I felt I needed to 
spell out the meaning of soft power in greater detail. Even colleagues were incorrectly 
describing soft power as “non-traditional forces such as cultural and commercial

goods” and dismissing it on the grounds that “it’s, well, soft.”7 And a Congresswoman 
friend told me privately that she agreed 100 percent with my concept, but that it was 
impossible to use it to address a political audience who wanted to hear tough talk. 
In 2004, I went into more detail conceptually in Soft Power: The Means to Success 
in World Politics. I also said that soft power was only one component of power and 
rarely sufﬁcient by itself. The ability to combine hard and soft power into successful 
strategies where they reinforce each other could be considered “smart power” (a term 
later used by Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State). I developed the concepts further 
in my 2011 book on The Future of Power Including in the realm of cyber power.8 
I made clear that soft power is not a normative concept, and it is not necessarily 
better to twist minds than to twist arms. “Bad” people (like Osama bin Laden) can 
exercise soft power. While I explored various dimensions of the concept most fully 
in this work, the central deﬁnition (the ability to affect others and obtain preferred 
outcomes by attraction and persuasion rather than coercion or payment) remained 
constant over time. 
In 2007, as the situation in Iraq continued to deteriorate, John Hamre, Richard 
Armitage, and I co-chaired a “Smart Power Commission” for the Centre for Strategic 
and International Studies in Washington. With former senators and Supreme Court 
justices participating, we hoped to use soft and smart power for the political purpose 
of centering American foreign policy. Subsequently in the Bush Administration, in 
2007 Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called for the United States to invest more 
in soft power. It was a long way from the modest ambitions for the analytic concept 
scribbled out on my kitchen table 17 years earlier. The term “smart power” (the 
successful combination of hard and soft power resources into effective strategy) was 
clearly prescriptive rather than just analytical. 
Even more impressive in terms of distance from that kitchen table was the fate 
of the concept in China. As China dramatically developed its hard power resources, 
leaders realized that it would be more acceptable if it were accompanied by soft 
power. This is a smart strategy because as China’s hard military and economic power 
grows, it may frighten its neighbors into balancing coalitions. If it can accompany 
its rise with an increase in its soft power, China can weaken the incentives for 
these coalitions. In 2007, Chinese President Hu Jintao told the 17th Congress of the 
Chinese Communist Party that they needed to invest more in their soft power, and 
this has been continued by the current President Xi Jinping. Once the top leader 
had spoken and the word was out, billions of dollars were invested to promote soft 
power, and thousands of articles were published on the subject. China has had mixed 
success with its soft power strategy. Its impressive record of economic growth that 
has raised hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and its traditional culture 
have been important sources of attraction, but polls show it lags behind the United 
States in overall attractiveness in most parts of the world, including Asia. Portland— 
a consultancy in London that constructs an annual index of soft power—ranks the 
United States ﬁrst and China as number 28 of the top 30 countries.9

Soft Power: The Origins and Political Progress of a Concept
Top-level endorsement in China affected me directly. Hardly, a week went by in 
the year after Hu Jintao’s use of the concept without an e-mail asking me to write 
an article or participate in some soft power seminar or conference. Chinese ofﬁcials 
contacted me for private conversations about how to increase China’s soft power. My 
advice was always the same. I say that China should realize that most of a country’s 
soft power comes from its civil society rather than from its government. 
Propaganda is not credible and thus does not attract. China needs to give more 
leeway to the talents of its civil society, even though this is difﬁcult to reconcile with 
tight party control. Chinese soft power is also held back by its territorial disputes 
with its neighbors. Creating a Confucius Institute to teach Chinese culture in Manila 
will not generate attraction if Chinese naval vessels are chasing Philippine ﬁshing 
boats out of Scarborough Shoal that lies within 200 miles of its coastline. When I 
said this on a televised panel at Davos in 2013, Wang Jianlin, the richest man in 
China interrupted the panel to criticize me for “hurting the feelings of the Chinese 
people.” 
One of the most intriguing occasions was an invitation to address the School of 
Marxism at Peking University in Beijing. I was treated royally. When it came time 
for my lecture to some 1500 students, I was seated alone at a table on a podium 
covered with gorgeous ﬂowers with a large screen on the wall behind me with an 
enlarged video of my performance. In the course of my speech, I addressed the 
question of how China could increase its soft power and I mentioned the harassment 
of the great Chinese artist Ai WeiWei as an example of too tight control over civil 
society. There was a slight titter in the crowd, but at the end of my lecture, the dean 
of the School of Marxism took the stage and gave a long ﬂowery thanks that the 
author of the concept of soft power had come to address the school. As he went on, 
however, I noted that my translator was skipping much of what he said. I later asked a 
Mandarin-speaking Canadian friend who was present in the front row what the dean 
had said. In summary: “we are ﬂattered to have Professor Nye here, but you students 
must realize that his use of the concept is overly political and we prefer to restrict it 
to cultural issues.” 
With time, I have come to realize that concepts such as soft power are like children. 
As an academic or a public intellectual, you can love and discipline them when they 
are young, but as they grow they wander off and make new company, both good and 
bad. There is not much you can do about it, even if you were present at the creation. 
As the Princeton political scientist Baldwin has recently written, “Nye’s discussion 
of soft power stimulated and clariﬁed the thoughts of policy makers and scholars 
alike—even those who misunderstood or disagree with his views.”10 Perhaps, that 
is all one can hope for.

What is a Moral Foreign Policy? 
Originally published in 
Project Syndicate on 
March 4, 2020. 
A foreign policy should be judged not only by speciﬁc actions, but also by how a 
pattern of actions shapes the environment of world politics. Leadership in supplying 
global public goods, for example, is consistent with “America First,” but it rests on 
a broader historical and institutional understanding than Donald Trump has shown. 
Many Americans say they want a moral foreign policy, but disagree on what 
that means. Using a three-dimensional scorecard encourages us to avoid simplistic 
answers and to look at the motives, means, and consequences of a US president’s 
actions. 
Consider, for example, the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and the two George 
Bushes. When people call for a “Reaganite foreign policy,” they mean to highlight the 
clarity of his rhetoric in the presentation of values. Clearly stated objectives helped 
educate and motivate the public at home and abroad. 
But that was only one aspect of Reagan’s foreign policy. The success of his moral 
leadership also relied on his means of bargaining and compromise. The key question 
is whether he was prudent in balancing his objectives and the risks of trying to achieve 
them. 
Reagan’s initial rhetoric in his ﬁrst term created a dangerous degree of tension 
and distrust between the United States and the Soviet Union, increasing the risk of a 
miscalculation or accident leading to war. But it also created incentives to bargain, 
which Reagan later put to good use when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the 
Soviet Union. Reagan advanced US national interests, and he did so in a manner that 
did not exclusively beneﬁt American interests.

What is a Moral Foreign Policy?
In contrast, George H.W. Bush, by his own admission, did not promote a transfor-
mative foreign policy vision at the end of the Cold War. His goal was to avoid disaster 
during a period of rapid and far-reaching geopolitical change. While he referred to 
a “new world order,” he never spelled out what it would look like. As Bush and his 
team responded to forces that were largely outside of his control, he set goals that 
balanced opportunities and prudence. 
Bush limited his short-term aims in order to pursue long-term stability, prompting 
some critics to complain that he did not set more ambitious objectives. Instead, he 
was prudent in a turbulent time and managed to achieve American goals in a manner 
that was not unduly insular and did minimal damage to the interests of foreigners. 
He was careful not to humiliate Gorbachev and to manage Boris Yeltsin’s transition 
to leadership in Russia. 
With better communication skills, Bush might also have been able to do more to 
educate the American public about the changing nature of the world they faced after 
the Cold War. But given the uncertainties of history, and the potential for disaster 
as the Cold War ended, Bush had one of the best foreign policies of the period after 
1945. He allowed the US to beneﬁt from the Cold War’s outcome while avoiding 
calamity. 
His son, George W. Bush, started his ﬁrst term in ofﬁce with limited interest in 
foreign policy, but his objectives became transformational after the terrorist attacks 
on September 11, 2001. He became focused on national security but turned to the 
rhetoric of democracy to rally his followers in a time of crisis. His 2002 national 
security strategy, which came to be called the “Bush Doctrine,” proclaimed that the 
US would “identify and eliminate terrorists wherever they are, together with the 
regimes that sustain them.” 
In this new game, there were few rules and inadequate attention to the means. 
Bush’s solution to the terrorist threat was to spread democracy, and a “freedom 
agenda” thus became the basis of his 2006 national security strategy. But he lacked 
the means to democratize Iraq. The removal of Saddam Hussein did not accomplish 
the mission, and inadequate understanding of the context, together with poor planning 
and management, undercut Bush’s grand objectives. The result was a sectarian civil 
war in Iraq and a strengthening of the terrorist groups that eventually became the 
Islamic State (ISIS). 
A perpetual problem in US foreign policy is the complexity of the context, 
which increases the likelihood of unintended consequences. Prudence is sometimes 
dismissed as mere self-interest, but in foreign policy, it becomes a virtue. Negligent 
assessment and reckless risk-taking often lead to immoral consequences, or what 
in legal terms is called “culpable negligence.” Prudence also requires the ability 
to manage one’s emotions. In both respects, President Donald Trump’s rejection of 
intelligence and reliance on television sources raises serious moral as well as practical 
questions about his foreign policy. 
That leads, in turn, to the question of the role of institutions and how broadly a 
president deﬁnes America’s national interest. A president’s foreign policy depends 
not just on speciﬁc actions, but also on how a pattern of actions shapes the envi-
ronment of world politics. Leadership by the world’s most powerful country in the

supply of global public goods is consistent with “America First,” but it rests on a 
broader understanding of that term than Trump has shown. As Henry Kissinger has 
put it, “calculations of power without a moral dimension will turn every disagreement 
into a test of strength … Moral prescriptions without concern for equilibrium, on the 
other hand, tend toward either crusades or an impotent policy tempting challenges; 
either extreme risks endangering the coherence of the international order itself.” 
Prudence is a necessary virtue for a good foreign policy, but it is not sufﬁcient. 
American presidents have been prudent when they needed to embrace a broader 
institutional vision. In the future, a sense of vision and strategy that correctly under-
stands and responds to new technological and environmental changes—such as cyber 
threats, artiﬁcial intelligence, climate change, and pandemics—will be crucial. 
A moral foreign policy not only makes Americans safer, but also makes the world 
a better place. We judge moral policy by looking at behavior and institutions, acts 
of commission and omissions, and at all three dimensions of motives, means, and 
consequences. Even then, the nature of foreign policy—with its many contingencies 
and unforeseen events—means that we will often wind up with mixed verdicts. 
Future presidents will confront two global power shifts that will shape the context 
of American foreign policy in this century, one horizontal and one vertical. The 
horizontal shift is the rise of Asia, or more accurately, the recovery of Asia. Before 
the Industrial Revolution boosted the economies of Europe and North America in 
the nineteenth century, Asia represented more than half the world’s people and half 
the world’s economy. By 1900, Asia still had half the population, but its share of 
the global economy had shrunk to 20%. Beginning with the double-digit economic 
growth of Japan after World War II (which was an objective of US policy), the 
world has been returning to more normal proportions as Southeast Asia, China, and 
India followed in Japan’s footsteps. Particularly important is the rise of Chinese 
power and the danger that the world will fall into a “Thucydides trap” in which a 
devastating war is caused by the fear created in a dominant great power by the rise 
of a new power.1 Some think the twenty-ﬁrst century will be devastated by a war of 
hegemonic transition similar to what happened in the last century, when Britain was 
challenged by the rise in the power of Germany. 
The other great-power shift is vertical and is driven by technology. The information 
revolution that started in the 1960s with Moore’s Law about the doubling of the 
capacity of computer chips every two years is providing more information to more 
actors than at any time in history. This second power shift has sometimes been 
called “the new feudalism,” in which sovereigns share authority with a variety of 
other actors. Technology empowers non-state actors. They do not replace sovereign 
states, but they crowd the stage on which governments act, creating new instruments, 
problems, and potential coalitions.2 In addition, technology has increased economic, 
political, and ecological interdependence and created more transnational linkages

and issues that are often outside the control of governments, but affect the relations 
between them. Such global interdependence has also had redistributive effects within 
societies, which are in turn altering domestic politics that affect foreign policies. 
Both these power shifts challenge the liberal order of the past seven decades. 
Respected commentators such as Martin Wolf of the Financial Times have argued that 
“we are at the end of both an economic period—that of Western-led globalization— 
and a geopolitical one, the post–Cold War ‘unipolar moment’ of a US-led global 
order. The question is whether what follows will be an unravelling of the post– 
Second World War era into a period of deglobalization and conﬂict much like the 
ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, or a new period in which non-Western powers, 
especially China and India, play a larger role in sustaining a co-operative global 
order.”3 Such a new world poses new challenges for an ethical foreign policy.

Soft Power in the American Experience 
The United States has played an important role in the development and applica-
tion of soft power, both actively and passively. Post-World War II America, through 
Hollywood, music, and promotion of liberal democratic ideology, greatly inﬂuenced 
its allies and enabled the United States to extend its inﬂuence without military 
intervention. 
This evolution of “soft power” as used by the United States serves as a point of 
reference when we look at other countries, especially China.

Soft Power and American Foreign Policy 
Originally published in 
the Summer 2004 edition 
of Political Science 
Quarterly. 
The sources of American soft power—culture, values, etc.,—remain attractive 
despite foreign policy decisions that are unpopular and increased anti-American 
sentiment. While the issues may be different, the views in this article from 2004 
will seem all too familiar and provide some insight into how the United States has 
changed and how it has stayed the same. 
Anti-Americanism has increased in the past few years. Thomas Pickering, a seasoned 
diplomat, considered 2003 “as high a zenith of anti-Americanism as we’ve seen for 
a long time.”1 Polls show that our soft power losses can be traced largely to our 
foreign policy. “A widespread and fashionable view is that the United States is a 
classically imperialist power…That mood has been expressed in different ways by 
different people, from the hockey fans in Montreal who boo the American national 
anthem to the high school students in Switzerland who do not want to go to the 
United States as exchange students.”2 An Australian observer concluded that “the 
lesson of Iraq is that the US’s soft power is in decline. Bush went to war having 
failed to win a broader military coalition or UN authorization. This had two direct 
consequences: a rise in anti-American sentiment, lifting terrorist recruitment; and a 
higher cost to the US for the war and reconstruction effort.”3 A Gallup International 
poll showed that pluralities in ﬁfteen out of twenty-four countries around the world

said that American foreign policies had a negative effect on their attitudes toward 
the United States. 
A Eurobarometer poll found that a majority of Europeans believe that the United 
States tends to play a negative role in ﬁghting global poverty, protecting the envi-
ronment, and maintaining peace in the world.4 When asked in a Pew poll to what 
extent they thought the United States “takes your interests into account,” a majority 
in twenty out of forty-two countries surveyed said “not too much” or “not at all.”5 In 
many countries, unfavorable ratings were highest among younger people. American 
pop culture may be widely admired among young people, but the unpopularity of 
our foreign policies is causing the next generation to question American power.6 
American music and ﬁlms are more popular in Britain, France, and Germany than 
they were twenty years ago, another period when American policies were unpopular 
in Europe, but the attraction of our policies is even lower than it was then.7 There 
are also hints that unpopular foreign policies might be spilling over and undercut-
ting the attractiveness of some aspects of American popular culture. A 2003 Roper 
study showed that “for the ﬁrst time since 1998, consumers in 30 countries signaled 
their disenchantment with America by being less likely to buy Nike products or eat 
at McDonalds…At the same time, nine of the top 12 Asian and European ﬁrms, 
including Sony, BMW and Panasonic, saw their scores rise.”8 
The Costs of Ignoring Soft Power 
Soft power is the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion 
or payments. When you can get others to want what you want, you do not have to 
spend as much on sticks and carrots to move them in your direction. Hard power, the 
ability to coerce, grows out of a country’s military and economic might. Soft power 
arises from the attractiveness of a country’s culture, political ideals, and policies. 
When our policies are seen as legitimate in the eyes of others, our soft power is 
enhanced. 
Skeptics about soft power say not to worry. Popularity is ephemeral and should 
not be a guide for foreign policy in any case. The United States can act without the 
world’s applause. We are so strong we can do as we wish. We are the world’s only 
superpower, and that fact is bound to engender envy and resentment. Fouad Ajami has 
stated recently, “The United States need not worry about hearts and minds in foreign

lands.”9 Columnist Cal Thomas refers to “the ﬁction that our enemies can be made 
less threatening by what America says and does.”10 Moreover, the United States has 
been unpopular in the past, yet managed to recover. We do not need permanent allies 
and institutions. We can always pick up a coalition of the willing when we need to. 
Donald Rumsfeld is wont to say that the issues should determine the coalitions, not 
vice-versa. 
But it would be a mistake to dismiss the recent decline in our attractiveness so 
lightly. It is true that the United States has recovered from unpopular policies in the 
past, but that was against the backdrop of the Cold War, in which other countries still 
feared the Soviet Union as the greater evil. Moreover, while America’s size and asso-
ciation with disruptive modernity are real and unavoidable, wise policies can soften 
the sharp edges of that reality and reduce the resentments that they engender. That 
is what the United States did after World War II. We used our soft power resources 
and co-opted others into a set of alliances and institutions that lasted for sixty years. 
We won the Cold War against the Soviet Union with a strategy of containment that 
used our soft power as well as our hard power. 
It is true that the new threat of transnational terrorism increased American vulner-
ability, and some of our unilateralism after September 11 was driven by fear. But the 
United States cannot meet the new threat identiﬁed in the national security strategy 
without the cooperation of other countries. They will cooperate, up to a point, out of 
mere self-interest, but their degree of cooperation is also affected by the attractiveness 
of the United States. Take Pakistan for example. President Pervez Musharraf faces a 
complex game of cooperating with the United States on terrorism while managing a 
large anti-American constituency at home. He winds up balancing concessions and 
retractions. If the United States were more attractive to the Pakistani populace, we 
would see more concessions in the mix. 
It is not smart to discount soft power as just a question of image, public relations, 
and ephemeral popularity. As I argued earlier, it is a form of power—a means of 
obtaining desired outcomes. When we discount the importance of our attractiveness 
to other countries, we pay a price. Most importantly, if the United States is so unpop-
ular in a country that being pro-American is a kiss of death in their domestic politics, 
political leaders are unlikely to make concessions to help us. Turkey, Mexico, and 
Chile were prime examples in the run-up to the Iraq war in March 2003. When Amer-
ican policies lose their legitimacy and credibility in the eyes of others, attitudes of 
distrust tend to fester and further reduce our leverage. For example, after September 
11, there was an outpouring of sympathy from Germans for the United States, and 
Germany joined a military campaign against the al Qaeda network. But as the United 
States geared up for the unpopular Iraq war, Germans expressed widespread disbe-
lief about the reasons the United States gave for going to war, such as the alleged 
connection of Iraq to al Qaeda and the imminence of the threat of weapons of mass

destruction. German suspicions were reinforced by what they saw as biased Amer-
ican media coverage during the war and by the failure to ﬁnd weapons or prove the 
connection to al Qaeda right after the war. The combination fostered a climate in 
which conspiracy theories ﬂourished. By July 2003, one-third of Germans under the 
age of thirty said that they thought the American government might even have staged 
the original September 11 attacks.11 
Absurd views feed upon each other, and paranoia can be contagious. American 
attitudes toward foreigners harden, and we begin to believe that the rest of the world 
really does hate us. Some Americans begin to hold grudges, to mistrust all Muslims, 
to boycott French wines and rename French fries, and to spread and believe false 
rumors.12 In turn, foreigners see Americans as uninformed and insensitive to anyone’s 
interests but their own. They see our media wrapped in the American ﬂag. Some 
Americans, in turn, succumb to residual strands of isolationism, saying that if others 
choose to see us that way, “to hell with’em.” If foreigners are going to be like that, 
who cares whether we are popular or not. But to the extent that we allow ourselves to 
become isolated, we embolden enemies such as al Qaeda. Such reactions undercut 
our soft power and are self-defeating in terms of the outcomes we want. 
Some hard-line skeptics might say that whatever the merits of soft power, it has 
little role to play in the current war on terrorism. Osama bin Laden and his followers 
are repelled, not attracted by American culture, values, and policies. Military power 
was essential in defeating the Taliban government in Afghanistan, and soft power 
will never convert fanatics. Charles Krauthammer, for example, argued soon after the 
war in Afghanistan that our swift military victory proved that “the new unilateralism” 
worked. That is true up to a point, but the skeptics mistake half the answer for the 
whole solution. 
Look again at Afghanistan. Precision bombing and Special Forces defeated the 
Taliban government, but U.S. forces in Afghanistan wrapped up less than a quarter 
of al Qaeda, a transnational network with cells in sixty countries. The United States 
cannot bomb al Qaeda cells in Hamburg, Kuala Lumpur, or Detroit. Success against 
them depends on close civilian cooperation, whether sharing intelligence, coor-
dinating police work across borders, or tracing global ﬁnancial ﬂows. America’s 
partners cooperate partly out of self-interest, but the inherent attractiveness of U.S. 
policies can and does inﬂuence the degree of cooperation. 
Equally important, the current struggle against Islamist terrorism is not a clash 
of civilizations but a contest whose outcome is closely tied to a civil war between 
moderates and extremists within Islamic civilization. The United States and other 
advanced democracies will win only if moderate Muslims win, and the ability to 
attract the moderates is critical to victory. We need to adopt policies that appeal 
to moderates and to use public diplomacy more effectively to explain our common

interests. We need a better strategy for wielding our soft power. We will have to learn 
better how to combine hard and soft power if we wish to meet the new challenges. 
Beneath the surface structure, the world changed in profound ways during the last 
decades of the twentieth century. September 11 was like a ﬂash of lightening on a 
summer evening that displayed an altered landscape, and we are still left groping in 
the dark wondering how to ﬁnd our way through it. George W. Bush entered ofﬁce 
committed to a traditional realist foreign policy that would focus on great powers like 
China and Russia and eschew nation building in failed states of the less-developed 
world. But in September 2002, his administration proclaimed a new national security 
strategy that declared “we are men aced less by ﬂeets and armies than by catastrophic 
technologies falling into the hands of the embittered few.” Instead of strategic rivalry, 
“today, the world’s great powers ﬁnd ourselves on the same side—united by common 
dangers of terrorist violence and chaos.” The United States increased its development 
assistance and its efforts to combat AIDS because “weak states, like Afghanistan, 
can pose as great a danger to our national interest as strong states.”13 The historian 
John Lewis Gaddis compared the new strategy to the seminal days that redeﬁned 
American foreign policy in the 1940s.14 
The new strategy attracted criticism at home and abroad for its excessive rhetoric 
about preemptive military strikes and the promotion of American primacy. Critics 
pointed out that the practice of preemption is not new, but that turning it into a 
doctrine weakens international norms and encourages other countries to engage in 
risky actions. Similarly, American primacy is a fact, but there was no need for rhetoric 
that rubbed other people’s noses in it. Notwithstanding such ﬂaws, the new strategy 
responded to the deep trends in world politics that were illuminated by the events of 
September 11, 2001. The “privatization of war” is a major historical change in world 
politics that must be addressed. This is what the new Bush strategy gets right. What 
the United States has not yet sorted out is how to go about implementing the new 
approach. We have done far better on identifying the ends than the means. On that 
dimension, both the administration and Congress were deeply divided. 
According to the National Security Strategy, the greatest threats the American 
people face are transnational terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and partic-
ularly their combination. Yet, meeting the challenge posed by transnational military 
organizations that could acquire weapons of mass destruction requires the cooper-
ation of other countries—and cooperation is strengthened by soft power. Similarly, 
efforts to promote democracy in Iraq and elsewhere will require the help of others. 
Reconstruction in Iraq and peacekeeping in failed states are far more likely to succeed 
and to be less costly if shared with others rather than appearing as American imperial 
occupation. The fact that the United States squandered its soft power in the way that 
it went to war meant that the aftermath turned out to be much more costly than it 
need have been.

Soft Power and American Foreign Policy
Even after the war, in the hubris and glow of victory in May 2003, the United 
States resisted a signiﬁcant international role for the UN and others in Iraq. But as 
casualties and costs mounted over the summer, the United States found many other 
countries reluctant to share the burden without a UN blessing. As the top American 
commander for Iraq, General John Abizaid reported, “You can’t underestimate the 
public perception both within Iraq and within the Arab world about the percentage 
of the force being so heavily American.” But, Abizaid continued other countries 
“need to have their internal political constituents satisﬁed that they’re playing a role 
as an instrument of the international community and not as a pawn of the United 
States.”15 Before the Madrid conference of potential donors to Iraq in October 2003, 
the New York Times reported that L. Paul Bremer, the chief occupation administrator 
in Baghdad, said, “I need the money so bad we have to move off our principled 
opposition to the international community being in charge.”16 Neoconservatives like 
Max Boot were urging conservatives not to treat marginalizing the UN as a core 
principle, and Charles Krauthammer, proud author of “the new unilateralism,” called 
for a new UN resolution because Russia, India, and others “say they would contribute 
only under such a resolution.” In his words, “the U.S. is not overstretched. But 
psychologically we are up against our limits. The American people are simply not 
prepared to undertake worldwide nation building.”17 
In the global information age, the attractiveness of the United States will be 
crucial to our ability to achieve the outcomes we want. Rather than having to put 
together pick-up coalitions of the willing for each new game, we will beneﬁt if we 
are able to attract others into institutional alliances and eschew weakening those we 
have already created. NATO, for example, not only aggregates the capabilities of 
advanced nations, but its interminable committees, procedures, and exercises also 
allow these nations to train together and quickly become interoperable when a crisis 
occurs. As for alliances, if the United States is an attractive source of security and 
reassurance, other countries will set their expectations in directions that are conducive 
to our interests. Initially, for example, the U.S.-Japan security treaty was not very 
popular in Japan, but polls show that over the decades, it became more attractive 
to the Japanese public. Once that happened, Japanese politicians began to build 
it into their approaches to foreign policy. The United States beneﬁts when it is 
regarded as a constant and trusted source of attraction so that other countries are 
not obliged continually to re-examine their options in an atmosphere of uncertain 
coalitions. In the Japan case, broad acceptance of the United States by the Japanese 
public “contributed to the maintenance of US hegemony” and “served as political

constraints compelling the ruling elites to continue cooperation with the United 
States.”18 Popularity can contribute to stability. 
Finally, as the RAND Corporation’s John Arquila and David Ronfeldt argue, 
power in an information age will come not only from strong defenses but also from 
strong sharing. A traditional realpolitik mindset makes it difﬁcult to share with others. 
But in an information age, such sharing not only enhances the ability of others to 
cooperate with us but also increases their inclination to do so.19 As we share intel-
ligence and capabilities with others, we develop common outlooks and approaches 
that improve our ability to deal with the new challenges. Power ﬂows from that 
attraction. Dismissing the importance of attraction as merely ephemeral popularity 
ignores key insights from new theories of leadership as well as the new realities of 
the information age. We cannot afford that. 
American Empire? 
Not everyone agrees with this picture of the changing nature of world politics, and 
thus, they recommend a different approach to American foreign policy. Many argue 
that our new vulnerability requires a much higher degree of forceful control. More-
over, our unprecedented power now makes it possible. As Robert Kaplan has argued, 
“it is a cliché these days to observe that the United States now possesses a global 
empire; the question now is how the American empire should operate on a tactical 
level to manage an unruly world.”20 William Kristol, editor of the neoconservative 
magazine The Weekly Standard, says, “We need to err on the side of being strong. 
And if people want to say we’re an imperialist power, ﬁne.”21 Writing in the same 
journal in 2001, Max Boot agreed, in the explicitly titled article “The Case for an 
American Empire.”22 
Three decades ago, the radical left used the term “American empire” as an epithet. 
Now, the phrase has come out of the closet and is used by a number of analysts, on 
the left and the right alike, to explain and guide American foreign policy. Andrew 
Bacevich, for example, argues that the notion of an American empire is approaching 
mainstream respectability, and we should not worry about the semantic details.23 But 
words matter. In Alice in Wonderland, the Red Queen tells Alice that she can make

words mean whatever she wants. But when we want to communicate clearly with 
others, we have to take care in what we use our words to do. If America is like no 
other empire in history, as Bacevich claims, then in what sense is it an empire? And 
while the use of the term may point up some useful analogies, it may also mislead 
us by obscuring important differences. 
In many ways, the metaphor of empire is seductive. The American military has a 
global reach, with bases around the world, and its regional commanders sometimes 
act like proconsuls. English is a lingua franca, like Latin. The American economy is 
the largest in the world, and American culture serves as a magnet. But it is a mistake 
to confuse the politics of primacy with the politics of empire. Although unequal 
relationships certainly exist between the United States and weaker powers and can 
be conducive to exploitation, absent formal political control, the term “imperial” can 
be misleading. Its acceptance would be a disastrous guide for American foreign policy 
because it fails to take into account how the world has changed. The United States is 
certainly not an empire in the way we think of the European overseas empires of the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries because the core feature of such imperialism was 
direct political control.24 The United States has more power resources, compared to 
other countries, than Britain had at its imperial peak. On the other hand, the United 
States has less power, in the sense of control over the behavior that occurs inside 
other countries, than Britain did when it ruled a quarter of the globe. For example, 
Kenya’s schools, taxes, laws, and elections—not to mention external relations— 
were controlled by British ofﬁcials. Even where Britain used indirect rule through 
local potentates, as in Uganda, it exercised far more control than the United States 
does today. Others try to rescue the metaphor by referring to “informal empire” or 
the “imperialism of free trade,” but this simply obscures important differences in 
degrees of control suggested by comparisons with real historical empires. Yes, the 
Americans have widespread inﬂuence, but in 2003, the United States could not even 
get Mexico and Chile to vote for a second resolution on Iraq in the UN Security 
Council. The British empire did not have that kind of problem with Kenya or India. 
Devotees of the new imperialism say not to be so literal. “Empire” is merely 
a metaphor. But the problem with the metaphor is that it implies a control from 
Washington that is unrealistic and reinforces the prevailing strong temptations toward 
unilateralism that are present in Congress and parts of the administration. The costs 
of occupation of other countries have become prohibitive in a world of multiple 
nationalisms, and the legitimacy of empire is broadly challenged. 
Power depends on context, and the distribution of power differs greatly in different 
domains. In the global information age, power is distributed among countries in a 
pattern that resembles a complex three-dimensional chess game. On the top chess-
board of political-military issues, military power is largely unipolar, but on the 
economic board, the United States is not a hegemon or an empire, and it must bargain 
as an equal when Europe acts in a uniﬁed way. And on the bottom chessboard of 
transnational relations, power is chaotically dispersed, and it makes no sense to

American Empire?
55
use traditional terms such as unipolarity, hegemony, or American empire. Those 
who recommend an imperial American foreign policy based on traditional military 
descriptions of American power are relying on woefully inadequate analysis. If you 
are in a three-dimensional game, you will lose if you focus only on one board and 
fail to notice the other boards and the vertical connections among them—witness the 
connections in the war on terrorism between military actions on the top board, where 
we removed a dangerous tyrant in Iraq, but simultaneously increased the ability of 
the al Qaeda network to gain new recruits on the bottom, transnational board.25 
Because of its leading edge in the information revolution and its past investment in 
military power, the United States will likely remain the world’s single most powerful 
country well into the twenty-ﬁrst century. French dreams of a multipolar military 
world are unlikely to be realized anytime soon, and the German Foreign Minister, 
Joschka Fischer, has explicitly eschewed such a goal.26 But not all the important 
types of power come out of the barrel of a gun. Hard power is relevant to getting 
the outcomes we want on all three chessboards, but many of the transnational issues, 
such as climate change, the spread of infectious diseases, international crime, and 
terrorism, cannot be resolved by military force alone. Representing the dark side 
of globalization, these issues are inherently multilateral and require cooperation for 
their solution. Soft power is particularly important in dealing with the issues that arise 
from the bottom chessboard of transnational relations. To describe such a world as 
an American empire fails to capture the real nature of the foreign policy tasks that 
we face. 
Another problem for those who urge that we accept the idea of an American 
empire is that they misunderstand the underlying nature of American public opinion 
and institutions. Even if it were true that unilateral occupation and transformation 
of undemocratic regimes in the Middle East and elsewhere would reduce some of 
the sources of transnational terrorism, the question is whether the American public 
would tolerate an imperial role for its government. Neoconservative writers like Max 
Boot argue that the United States should provide troubled countries with the sort of 
enlightened foreign administration once provided by self-conﬁdent Englishmen in 
jodhpurs and pith helmets, but as the British historian Niall Ferguson points out, 
modern America differs from nineteenth-century Britain in our “chronically short 
time frame.”27 Although an advocate of empire, Ferguson worries that the American 
political system is not up to the task, and for better or worse, he is right. 
The United States has intervened in and governed countries in Central America, 
the Caribbean, and the Philippines, and America was brieﬂy tempted into real impe-
rialism when it emerged as a world power a century ago, but the interlude of formal

empire did not last.28 Imperialism has never been a comfortable experience for Amer-
icans, and only a small portion of the cases of military occupation in our history 
have led directly to the establishment of democracies. The establishment of democ-
racy in Germany and Japan after World War II remains the exception rather than 
the rule, and in these countries, it took nearly a decade. American empire is not 
limited by “imperial overstretch,” in the sense of costing an impossible portion of our 
gross domestic product. We devoted a much higher percentage of the gross domestic 
product to the military budget during the Cold War than we do today. The overstretch 
will come from having to police more peripheral countries with nationally resistant 
publics than foreign or American public opinion will accept. Polls show little taste 
for empire among Americans. Instead, the American public continues to say that it 
favors multilateralism and using the UN. Perhaps that is why Michael Ignatieff, a 
Canadian advocate of accepting the empire metaphor qualiﬁes it by referring to the 
American role in the world as “Empire Lite.”29 
In fact, the problem of creating an American empire might better be termed “impe-
rial understretch.” Neither the public nor Congress has proven willing to invest seri-
ously in the instruments of nation building and governance as opposed to military 
force. The entire budget for international affairs (including the Agency for Inter-
national Development) is only 1% of the federal budget. The United States spends 
nearly nineteen times that amount on its military, and there is little indication that this 
is about to change in an era of tax cuts and budget deﬁcits. Moreover, our military 
is designed for ﬁghting, rather than for police work, and the Rumsfeld Pentagon has 
cut back on training for peacekeeping operations. The United States has designed a 
military that is better suited to kick down the door, beat up a dictator, and then go 
home rather than stay for the harder imperial work of building a democratic polity. 
For a variety of reasons, in regard to both the world and the United States, Americans 
should avoid the misleading metaphor of empire as a guide for our foreign policy. 
Empire is not the narrative we need to help us understand and cope with the global

The United States has a variety of foreign policy traditions to draw upon that overlap, 
reinforce, and sometimes conﬂict with each other. The writer Walter Mead has used 
the device of identifying these traditions with the names of past leaders as a helpful 
way to distinguish them.30 The realists who prudently pursue national interest and

commerce are named after Alexander Hamilton. Populists, who emphasize self-
reliance and frequent use of coercion, he names for Andrew Jackson. He calls “Jef-
fersonians” those who pursue democracy by being a shining beacon to others rather 
than (in John Quincy Adams’s words) “going forth in search of monsters to destroy.” 
Finally, “Wilsonians” are the idealists who follow Woodrow Wilson in seeking to 
make the world safe for democracy. 
Each approach has its virtues and faults. The Hamiltonians are prudent, but their 
realism lacks a moral appeal to many at home and abroad. The Jacksonians are robust 
and tough, but lack staying power and allies. Both the Hamiltonians and Jacksonians 
are deﬁcient in soft power. The Jeffersonians, on the other hand, have plenty of soft 
power, but not enough hard power. Being a shining city on a hill is attractive but 
often not sufﬁcient to achieve all foreign policy goals. The Wilsonians are also long 
on soft power, but sometimes their idealism leads them into unrealistic ambitions. 
Their danger is that their foreign policy vehicles often have strong accelerators but 
weak brakes and are thus prone to go off the road. 
Whereas Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians tend toward prudent and conservative 
foreign policies that do not rock the boat, Wilsonians seek to transform the interna-
tional situation. In the case of the Middle East, for years, the United States followed 
a Hamiltonian policy that sought stability through the support of autocrats but that, 
in the end, did not prevent the rise of radical Islamist ideology and terrorism. The 
Wilsonians urge a transformational rather than a conservative or status quo foreign 
policy. In their view, without democratization, the Middle East (and other regions) 
will continue to be a breeding ground for rogue states and terrorist threats. Much of 
the debate inside the Bush administration over the Iraq war was between traditional 
Hamiltonian realists (such as Secretary of State Colin Powell) and a coalition of 
Jacksonians (such as Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald 
Rumsfeld) plus neoconservative Wilsonians (such as Deputy Defense Secretary Paul 
Wolfowitz). Part of the confusion over American objectives in going to war was that 
the administration used different arguments to appeal to different camps. The sugges-
tion of a connection to al Qaeda and September 11 was important to Jacksonians, who 
sought revenge and deterrence; the argument that Saddam Hussein was developing 
weapons of mass destruction in violation of UN resolutions appealed to Hamiltonians 
and traditional Wilsonians in Congress; and the need to remove a bloody dictator 
and transform Middle Eastern politics was important to the new Wilsonians. 
In recent years, the Wilsonians have divided into two camps. President Wilson, 
of course, was a Democrat, and traditional Wilsonians continue to stress both the 
promotion of democracy and the role of international institutions. The neoconserva-
tives, many of whom split off from the Democratic party, stress the importance of 
democracy, but have dropped Wilson’s emphasis on international institutions. They 
do not want to be held back by institutional constraints, and they see our legiti-
macy coming from our focus on democracy. In that sense, the neoconservatives are 
advocates of soft power, but they focus too simply on substance and not enough on 
process. By downgrading the legitimacy that comes from institutional processes in 
which others are consulted, they squander soft power.

58
Soft Power and American Foreign Policy
Ironically, however, the only way to achieve the type of transformation that the 
neoconservatives seek is by working with others and avoiding the backlash that 
arises when the United States appears on the world stage as an imperial power 
acting unilaterally. What is more, because democracy cannot be imposed by force 
and requires a considerable time to take root, the most likely way to obtain staying 
power from the American public is through developing international legitimacy and 
burden sharing with allies and institutions. For Jacksonians like Secretary of Defense 
Rumsfeld, this may not matter. They would prefer to punish the dictator and come 
home rather than engage in tedious nation building. For example, in September 2003, 
Rumsfeld said of Iraq, “I don’t believe it’s our job to reconstruct the country.”31 But 
for serious neoconservatives, like Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, their 
impatience with institutions and allies may undercut their own objectives. They 
understand the importance of soft power but fail to appreciate all its dimensions and 
dynamics. 
Soft Power and Policy 
Soft power grows out of our culture, out of our domestic values and policies, and 
out of our foreign policy. Many of the effects of our culture, for better or worse, are 
outside the control of government. But there is still a great deal that the government 
can do. Much more can be done to improve our public diplomacy in all dimensions. 
We can greatly improve our broadcast capabilities as well as our narrowcasting on 
the Internet. But both should be based on better listening as well. Newt Gingrich has 
written that “the impact and success of a new U.S. communication strategy should be 
measured continually on a country-by-country basis. An independent public affairs 
ﬁrm should report weekly on how U.S. messages are received in at least the world’s 
50 largest countries.”32 Such an approach would help us to select relevant themes 
as well as to ﬁne-tune our short-term responses. And we should greatly increase our 
investment in soft power. We could easily afford to double the budget for public 
diplomacy as well as raise its proﬁle and direction from the White House. 
Equally important will be increasing the exchanges across societies that allow 
our rich and diverse non-governmental sectors to interact with other countries. It 
was a great mistake for the Clinton administration and Congress to cut the budget 
and staff for cultural diplomacy and exchanges by nearly 30% after 1993.33 And 
it is a mistake now to let visa policies curtail such contacts. The most effective

communication often occurs not by distant broadcasts but in face-to-face contacts— 
what Edward R. Murrow called “the last three feet.” Such programs were critical 
to winning the Cold War. The best communicators are often not governments but 
civilian surrogates, both from the United States and from other countries. 
We will need to be more inventive in this area, whether it be through ﬁnding ways 
to improve the visa process for educational exchanges, encouraging more Amer-
ican students to study abroad, rethinking the role of the Peace Corps, inventing a 
major program for foreigners to teach their languages in American schools, starting 
a corporation for public diplomacy that will help tap into the resources of the private 
and non-proﬁt sectors, or a myriad of other ways. As Michael Holtzman has observed 
about the Middle East, our public diplomacy must acknowledge a world that is far 
more skeptical of government messages than we have assumed. “To be credible to 
the so-called Arab street, public diplomacy should be directed mainly at spheres 
of everyday life. Washington should put its money into helping American doctors, 
teachers, businesses, religious leaders, athletic teams, and entertainers to go abroad 
and provide the sorts of services the people of the Middle East are eager for.”34 
While the United States has a number of social and political problems at home, 
many of these are shared with other postmodern societies, and thus, invidious compar-
isons do not seriously undercut our soft power. Moreover, we maintain strengths of 
openness, civil liberties, and democracy that appeal to others. Problems arise for 
our soft power when we do not live up to our own standards. As we try to ﬁnd 
the right balance between freedom and security in the struggle against terrorism, it 
is important to remember that others are watching as well. The Bush administra-
tion deserves credit for responding to human rights groups’ accusations that it was 
torturing suspects by unequivocally rejecting the use of any techniques to interrogate 
suspects that would constitute “cruel” treatment prohibited by the Constitution.35 
Some domestic policies, such as capital punishment and the absence of gun 
controls, reduce the attractiveness of the United States to other countries but are 
the results of differences in values that may persist for some time. Other policies, 
such as the refusal to limit gas-guzzling vehicles, damage the American reputation 
because they appear self-indulgent and demonstrate an unwillingness to consider 
the effects, we are having on global climate change and other countries. Similarly, 
domestic agricultural subsidies that are structured in a way that protects wealthy 
farmers while we preach the virtue of free markets to poor countries appear hypo-
critical in the eyes of others. In a democracy, the “dog” of domestic politics is often too 
large to be wagged by the tail of foreign policy, but when we ignore the connections, 
our apparent hypocrisy is costly to our soft power. 
The government can do most to recover the recent American loss of soft power in 
the near term by adjusting the style and substance of its foreign policy. Obviously, 
there are times when foreign policies serve fundamental American interests and 
cannot and should not be changed. But tactics can often be adjusted without giving 
up basic interests. Style may be the easiest part. For one thing, the administration

Soft Power and American Foreign Policy
could go back to the wisdom about humility and warnings about arrogance that 
George W. Bush expressed in his 2000 campaign. There is no need to take pleasure in 
embarrassing allies or to have a secretary of defense insulting them while a secretary 
of state is trying to woo them. As a British columnist wrote in the Financial Times, 
“I have a soft spot for Donald Rumsfeld. But as an ambassador for the American 
values so admired around the world, I can think of no one worse.”36 Prime Minister 
Tony Blair put it well in his 2003 address to the American Congress, when he said 
that the real challenge for the United States now “is to show that this is a partnership 
built on persuasion, not command.”37 
On the substance of policy, the Bush administration deserves credit for its efforts 
to align the United States with the long-term aspirations of poor people in Africa and 
elsewhere through its Millennium Challenge initiative, which promises to increase 
aid to countries willing to make reforms, as well as for its efforts to increase 
resources to combat AIDS and other infectious diseases. Success in implementing 
those programs will represent a signiﬁcant investment in American soft power. So 
also will be the serious promotion of the peace process in the Middle East. As National 
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said, “America is a country that really does have 
to be committed to values and to making life better for people around the world…It’s 
not just the sword, it’s the olive branch that speaks to those intentions.”38 
As for the sword, the United States will continue to need it from time to time in 
the struggle against terrorism and in our efforts to create stability. Maintaining our 
hard power is essential to security. But we will not succeed by the sword alone. Our 
doctrine of containment led to success in the Cold War not just because of military 
deterrence but because, as George Kennan designed the policy, our soft power would 
help to transform the Soviet Bloc from within. Containment was not a static military 
doctrine but a transformational strategy, albeit one that took decades to accomplish. 
Indeed, Kennan frequently warned against what he regarded as the overmilitarization 
of containment and was a strong supporter of contacts and exchanges. Those lessons 
about patience and the mixture of hard and soft power still stand us in good stead 
today. 
When we do use our hard power, we will need to be more attentive to ways to 
make it less costly to our soft power by creating broad coalitions. Here, the model 
should be the patient and painstaking work of George H. W. Bush in building the 
coalition for the ﬁrst Gulf war. Those who write off “old Europe” as so enthralled 
by Venus that it is hopelessly opposed to the use of force should remember that 
75% of the French and 63% of the German publics supported the use of military 
force to free Kuwait before the Gulf war.39 Similarly, both countries were active

participants in NATO’s use of military force against Serbia in the 1999 Kosovo war, 
despite the absence of a formal UN security council resolution. The difference was 
that American policy appeared legitimate in the eyes of their publics in those two 
cases. We had soft power and were able to attract allies. 
The UN is not the only source of legitimacy, but many people concluded that the 
Kosovo campaign was legitimate (although not formally legal) because it had the de 
facto support of a large majority of Security Council members. The UN is often an 
unwieldy institution. The veto power in the Security Council has meant that it has 
been able to authorize the use of force for a true collective security operation only 
twice in half a century: in Korea and Kuwait. But it was designed to be a concert of 
large powers that would not work when they disagree. The veto is like a fuse box in 
the electrical system of a house. Better that the fuse blows and the lights go out than 
that the house burns down. Moreover, as Koﬁ Annan pointed out after the Kosovo 
war, the UN is torn between the traditional strict interpretation of state sovereignty 
and the rise of international humanitarian and human rights law that sets limits on 
what leaders can do to their citizens. Moreover, the politics of consensus has made 
the United Nations Charter virtually impossible to amend. Nonetheless, for all its 
ﬂaws, the UN has proven useful in its humanitarian and peacekeeping roles where 
states agree, and it remains an important source of legitimization in world politics. 
The latter point is particularly galling to the new unilateralists, who correctly point 
to the undemocratic nature of many of the regimes that vote and chair committees. But 
their proposed solution of replacing the UN with a new organization of democracies 
ignores the fact that the major divisions over Iraq were among the democracies. 
Rather than engage in futile efforts at ignoring the UN or changing its architecture, 
we should improve our underlying bilateral diplomacy with the other major powers 
and use the UN in the practical ways in which it can help with the new strategy. In 
addition to the UN’s development and humanitarian agenda, the Security Council 
may wind up playing a background role related to North Korea ; the Committee on 
Terrorism can help to prod states to improve their procedures; and UN peacekeepers 
can save us from having to be the world’s lone policeman. Not only can the UN be 
useful to us in a variety of practical ways if we work at it, but unilateralist attacks on 
it will backﬁre in a way that undercuts our soft power.

Americans are still working their way through the aftermath of September 11. We 
are groping for a path through the strange new landscape recreated by technology 
and globalization whose dark aspects were vividly illuminated on that traumatic 
occasion. The Bush administration has correctly identiﬁed the nature of the new 
challenges that the nation faces and has reoriented American strategy accordingly. 
But the administration, like Congress and the public, has been torn between different 
approaches to the implementation of the new strategy. The result has been a mixture 
of both successes and failures. We have been more successful in the domain of hard 
power, where we have invested more, trained more, and have a clearer idea of what we 
are doing. We have been less successful in the areas of soft power, where our public

diplomacy has been woefully inadequate and our neglect of allies and institutions 
has created a sense of illegitimacy that has squandered our attractiveness. 
Yet this is ironic because the United States is the country that is at the forefront of 
the information revolution as well as the country that built some of the longest-lasting 
alliances and institution that the modern world has seen. We should know how to 
adapt and work with central to our power for more than half country with a vibrant 
social and culture that provides an almost inﬁnite number of points of contact with 
other societies. What is more, during the Cold War, we demonstrated that we know 
how to use the soft power resources that our society produces. 
It is time now for us to draw upon and combine our traditions in a different way. 
We need more Jefferson and less Jackson. Our Wilsonians are correct about the 
importance of democratic transformation of world politics over the long term, but 
they need to remember the role of institutions and allies. They also need to temper 
their impatience with a good mixture of Hamiltonian realism. In short, America’s 
success will depend upon our developing a deeper understanding of the role of soft 
power and developing a better balance of hard and soft power in our foreign policy. 
That will be smart power. We have done it before; we can do it again.

Get Smart: Combining Hard and Soft 
Power 
Originally published in the 
July/August 2009 edition 
of Foreign Affairs. 
The transition toward “smart power” requires constant adjustment to the balance 
between hard and soft power. Changing geopolitical and economic contexts neces-
sitates a regular reassessment of what tools of power are used and how they are 
applied, especially in the information age, in which change happens at increasingly 
break-neck speeds. 
In her conﬁrmation hearings, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, “America 
cannot solve the most pressing problems on our own, and the world cannot solve 
them without America…We must use what has been called ‘smart power,’ the full 
range of tools at our disposal.” Since then, editorial pages and blogs have been full 
of references to “smart power.” But, what does it mean? 
“Smart power” is a term I developed in 2003 to counter the misperception that 
soft power alone can produce effective foreign policy. Power is one’s ability to affect 
the behavior of others to get what one wants. There are three basic ways to do this: 
coercion, payment, and attraction. Hard power is the use of coercion and payment. 
Soft power is the ability to obtain preferred outcomes through attraction. If a state 
can set the agenda for others or shape their preferences, it can save a lot on carrots 
and sticks. But, rarely can it totally replace either. Thus, the need for smart strategies 
that combine the tools of both hard and soft power. 
In an otherwise estimable new book, Power Rules: How Common Sense Can 
Rescue American Foreign Policy, Leslie Gelb argues that “soft power now seems to 
mean almost everything” because both economic and military resources can inﬂuence 
other states. (Gelb’s recent article in these pages, “Necessity, Choice, and Common 
Sense” [May/June 2009], is drawn from the book.) But, Gelb confuses the actions of

a state seeking to achieve desired outcomes with the resources used to produce those 
outcomes. Military and economic resources can sometimes be used to attract as well 
as coerce–witness the positive effect of the U.S. military’s relief efforts in Indonesia 
following the 2004 tsunami on Indonesians’ attitudes toward the United States. This 
means that many different types of resources can contribute to soft power, not that 
the term “soft power” can mean any type of behavior. 
In his book, Gelb deﬁnes power too narrowly, as “getting people or groups to do 
something they don’t want to do.” He ignores a long literature on the other facets of 
power that are used to persuade others to do what is in fact in their own interests. 
As U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower put it, leadership is about getting people to 
do something “not only because you tell them to do so and enforce your orders but 
because they instinctively want to do it for you.” Sometimes that is possible, and 
sometimes not, but it is certainly an important aspect of power. Even if soft power is 
rarely sufﬁcient, it can help create an enabling or disabling context for policy. 
The major elements of a country’s soft power include its culture (when it is 
pleasing to others), its values (when they are attractive and consistently practiced), 
and its policies (when they are seen as inclusive and legitimate). Over the past decade, 
public opinion polls have shown a serious decline in the United States’ popularity in 
Europe, Latin America, and, most dramatically, the Muslim world. Poll respondents 
have generally cited the United States’ policies, more than its culture or values, to 
explain this decline. Since it is easier for a country to change its policies than its 
culture, U.S. President Barack Obama should focus on choosing policies that can 
help recover some of the United States’ soft power. 
Of course, soft power is not the solution to all problems. The fact that the North 
Korean dictator Kim Jong Il likes to watch Hollywood movies is unlikely to affect his 
country’s nuclear weapons program. And U.S. soft power got nowhere in drawing 
the Taliban government away from al Qaeda in the 1990s; it took hard military 
power in 2001 to end that alliance. But, broader goals, such as promoting democracy, 
protecting human rights, and developing civil society, are not best handled with guns. 
Contextual Intelligence 
In 2007, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and I co-chaired 
a bipartisan commission at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that 
helped popularize the concept of smart power. It concluded that the Pentagon is the 
best-trained and best-resourced arm of the government, but that there are limits to 
what hard power can achieve on its own and that turning to the Pentagon because it 
can get things done will lead to an overmilitarized foreign policy. Gelb criticizes us 
in Power Rules for “a mechanical combining rather than a genuine blending of the 
two ideas,” but we never proposed a mechanical formula for smart power. Figuring 
out how to combine the resources of both hard and soft power into smart power 
strategies requires what I call “contextual intelligence” in my book The Powers to 
Lead. In foreign policy, contextual intelligence is the intuitive diagnostic skill that

Contextual Intelligence
65
helps policymakers align tactics with objectives to create smart strategies. Of recent 
U.S. presidents, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush had impressive contextual 
intelligence; the younger Bush did not. 
Academics and pundits have often been mistaken about the United States’ power. 
Just two decades ago, the conventional wisdom was that the United States was in 
decline, suffering from so-called imperial overstretch. International relations theory 
at the time suffered from a materialist bias that truncated conceptions of power and 
ignored the full range of factors that can inﬂuence behavior through attraction. This 
is what I tried to recover in 1990 with the idea of soft power. 
A decade later, with the Cold War rivalry over, the new conventional wisdom was 
that the world was characterized by unipolarity and U.S. hegemony. Some neoconser-
vative pundits drew the conclusion that the United States was so powerful that it could 
decide what was right and others would have no choice but to follow. This new unilat-
eralism heavily inﬂuenced the George W. Bush administration even before the shock 
of 9/11 produced the Bush doctrine of preventive war and coercive democratization. 
Contextual intelligence must start with an understanding of not just the strengths 
but also the limits of U.S. power. The United States is the only superpower, but 
preponderance does not constitute empire or hegemony. The United States can inﬂu-
ence, but not control, other parts of the world. World politics today is like a three-
dimensional chess game. At the top level, military power among states is unipolar; 
but, at the middle level, of interstate economic relations, the world is multipolar and 
has been so for more than a decade. At the bottom level, of transnational relations 
(involving such issues as climate change, illegal drugs, pandemics, and terrorism), 
power is chaotically distributed and diffuses to non-state actors. 
Military power is a small part of any response to these new threats; these necessi-
tate cooperation among governments and international institutions. Even at the top 
level (where the United States represents nearly half the world’s total defense expen-
ditures), the U.S. military may be supreme in the global commons of air, sea, and 
space, but it is much less able to control nationalist populations in occupied areas. 
Contextual intelligence is needed to produce an integrated strategy that combines 
hard and soft power. Many ofﬁcial instruments of soft power—public diplomacy, 
broadcasting, exchange programs, development assistance, disaster relief, military-
to-military contacts—are scattered across the U.S. government. There is no overar-
ching policy that even tries to integrate them with hard power into a comprehensive 
national security strategy. The United States spends about 500 times as much on the 
military as it does on broadcasting and exchange programs. Is this the right propor-
tion? And how should the U.S. government relate to the generators of soft power in 
civil society—including everything from Hollywood to the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation?

66
Get Smart: Combining Hard and Soft Power
Success in the Information Age 
Despite its numerous errors, the United States’ Cold War strategy involved a smart 
combination of hard and soft power. The U.S. military deterred Soviet aggression, 
while American ideas undercut communism behind the Iron Curtain. When the Berlin 
Wall ﬁnally collapsed, it was destroyed not by an artillery barrage but by hammers 
and bulldozers wielded by those who had lost faith in communism. 
In today’s information age, success is the result not merely of whose army wins 
but also of whose story wins. The current struggle against Islamist terrorism is much 
less a clash of civilizations than an ideological struggle within Islam. The United 
States cannot win unless the Muslim mainstream wins. There is very little likelihood 
that people like Osama bin Laden can ever be won over with soft power: Hard power 
is needed to deal with such cases. But, there is enormous diversity of opinion in the 
Muslim world. Many Muslims disagree with American values as well as American 
policies, but that does not mean that they agree with bin Laden. The United States 
and its allies cannot defeat Islamist terrorism if the number of people the extremists 
are recruiting is larger than the number of extremists killed or deterred. Soft power 
is needed to reduce the extremists’ numbers and win the hearts and minds of the 
mainstream. 
The United States can become a smart power by once again investing in global 
public goods—providing things that people and governments in all quarters of 
the world want but cannot attain on their own. Achieving economic development, 
securing public health, coping with climate change, and maintaining an open, stable 
international economic system all require leadership from the United States. By 
complementing its military and economic might with greater investments in its soft 
power, the United States can rebuild the framework it needs to tackle tough global 
challenges. That would be true smart power.

Obama the Pragmatist 
Originally published 
on June 10, 2014 by 
Project Syndicate. 
There is no reason to believe that Obama was being disingenuous when he announced 
high expectations during his campaign, but his vision simply could not withstand the 
recalcitrant and difﬁcult world that confronted him, so he had to adjust. This forced 
the man who had promised transformational leadership to become a “transactional” 
leader. Obama understood the need to “do no harm,” and he served to establish 
precedent for the “smart” use of both soft and hard power during his presidency. 
President Barack Obama stated that some of America’s most costly mistakes since 
World War II were the result not of restraint, but of a “willingness to rush into military 
adventures without thinking through the consequences.” Though Obama may be 
right, the speech did little to mollify critics who have accused him of passivity and 
weakness during his time in ofﬁce, particularly regarding Syria and Ukraine. 
This frustration can be blamed partly on the impossibly high expectations that 
Obama set in his early speeches, in which he inspired voters with promises of 
systemic transformation. Unlike most candidates, Obama maintained this trans-
formational rhetoric even after it secured him his victory in the 2008 campaign. 
Indeed, a series of addresses in the ﬁrst year of his presidency raised expectations 
even higher, by establishing the goal of a nuclear weapons-free world, promising to 
revamp America’s approach to the Middle East, and pledging to “bend history in the 
direction of justice.” 
It is often said that democratic politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose.

that confronted him, so he had to adjust. After just one year in ofﬁce, the man who had 
promised transformational leadership became a “transactional” leader—pragmatic 
to a fault. And, despite what his critics say, this was a positive development. 
While vowing to use force when America’s vital interests are at stake and rejecting 
pessimistic projections of national decline, Obama was able to rely more heavily on 
diplomacy than force. For this, his critics accused him of failing to promote American 
values and retreating into isolationism. 
But, restraint is not isolationism. No one accused President Dwight Eisenhower 
of isolationism when he accepted a stalemate in the Korean War, refused to intervene 
at Dien Bien Phu, resisted recommendations from senior military ofﬁcers regarding 
islands near Taiwan, watched the Red Army invade Hungary, or refused to back 
allies in the Suez Canal crisis. Nor did those who now disparage Obama’s measured 
response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent annexation of Ukrainian terri-
tory call Bush an isolationist for his weak response to Putin’s invasion of Georgia in 
2008. 
Effective foreign policymaking requires an understanding of not only international 
and transnational systems, but also the intricacies of domestic politics in multiple 
countries. In such a complex and uncertain context, prudence is critical, and bold 
action based on a grandiose vision can be extremely dangerous. This is what advo-
cates of a more muscular approach to today’s revolutions in the Middle East often 
forget. 
Of course, it makes sense for US leaders to nudge events at the margins in an effort 
to advance democratic values in the long term. But, attempting to direct revolutions 
that they do not fully understand would be a mistake, with potentially serious negative 
consequences for all parties involved. 
In fact, in the twentieth century, US presidents who pursued transformational 
foreign policies were neither more effective nor more ethical. Woodrow Wilson’s 
bet on the Versailles Treaty of 1919 contributed to the disastrous isolationism of the 
1930’s. And the bets that John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson made in Vietnam 
had devastating consequences, some of which are still being felt today. 
In foreign policy, as in medicine, leaders must “ﬁrst do no harm.” Obama under-
stood that and he served to establish precedent for the “smart” use of both soft and 
hard power during his presidency. However, recent years have shown us that relent-
less uninformed criticism that his pragmatic policies elicited, resulted in a successor 
that reverted to a risky transformational approach.

American Soft Power in the Age 
of Trump 
Originally published by 
Project Syndicate 
on May 6, 2019. 
Many in the Trump administration argue that soft power does not matter much; 
countries cooperate out of self-interest. But, this misses a crucial point: Cooper-
ation is a matter of degree, and the degree is affected by attraction or repulsion, 
not just weapons and sanctions. While American power politics during the Trump 
administration was possibly not as “smart,” this was not a death knell for American 
soft power, but a lesson in the challenges that it faces both domestically and abroad. 
US President Donald Trump’s administration has shown little interest in public diplo-
macy. And yet public diplomacy—a government’s efforts to communicate directly 
with other countries’ publics—is one of the key instruments policymakers use to 
generate soft power, and the current information revolution makes such instruments 
more important than ever. 
Opinion polls and the Portland Soft Power 30 index show that American soft 
power has declined since the beginning of Trump’s term. Tweets can help to set the 
global agenda, but they do not produce soft power if they are not attractive to others. 
Trump’s defenders reply that soft power—what happens in the minds of others— 
is irrelevant; only hard power, with its military and economic instruments, matters. 
In March 2017, Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, proclaimed a “hard power 
budget” that would have slashed funding for the State Department and the US Agency 
for International Development by nearly 30%. 
Fortunately, military leaders know better. In 2013, General James Mattis (later 
Trump’s ﬁrst Secretary of Defense) warned Congress, “If you don’t fund the State 
Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.” As Henry

American Soft Power in the Age of Trump
Kissinger once pointed out, international order depends not only on the balance 
of hard power, but also on perceptions of legitimacy, which depends crucially on soft 
power. 
Information revolutions always have profound socioeconomic and political conse-
quences—witness the dramatic effects of Gutenberg’s printing press on Europe in 
the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries. One can date the current information revolu-
tion from the 1960s and the advent of “Moore’s Law:” The number of transistors 
on a computer chip doubles roughly every two years. As a result, computing power 
increased dramatically, and by the beginning of this century cost 0.1% of what it did 
in the early 1970s. 
In 1993, there were about 50 Web sites in the world; by 2000, that number 
surpassed ﬁve million. Today, more than four billion people are online; that number 
is projected to grow to 5–6 billion people by 2020, and the “Internet of Things” will 
connect tens of billions of devices. Facebook has more users than the populations of 
China and the US combined. 
In such a world, the power to attract and persuade becomes increasingly important. 
But, long gone are the days when public diplomacy was mainly conducted through 
radio and television broadcasting. Technological advances have led to a dramatic 
reduction in the cost of processing and transmitting information. The result is an 
explosion of information, which has produced a “paradox of plenty:” An abundance 
of information leads to scarcity of attention. 
When the volume of information confronting people becomes overwhelming, it 
is hard to know what to focus on. Social media algorithms are designed to compete 
for attention. Reputation becomes even more important than in the past, and political 
struggles, informed by social and ideological afﬁnities, often center on the creation 
and destruction of credibility. Social media can make false information look more 
credible if it comes from “friends.” As US Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report 
on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election showed, this enabled Russia 
to weaponize American social media. 
Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become an 
even more important power resource. Information that appears to be propaganda may 
not only be scorned, but may also turn out to be counterproductive if it undermines 
a country’s reputation for credibility—and thus reduces its soft power. The most 
effective propaganda is not propaganda. It is a two-way dialogue among people. 
Russia and China do not seem to comprehend this, and sometimes the United 
States fails to pass the test as well. During the Iraq War, for example, the treatment of 
prisoners at Abu Ghraib in a manner inconsistent with American values led to percep-
tions of hypocrisy that could not be reversed by broadcasting pictures of Muslims 
living well in America. Today, presidential “tweets” that prove to be demonstrably 
false undercut America’s credibility and reduce its soft power. The effectiveness of 
public diplomacy is measured by minds changed (as reﬂected in interviews or polls), 
not dollars spent or number of messages sent. 
Domestic or foreign policies that appear hypocritical, arrogant, indifferent to 
others’ views, or based on a narrow conception of national interest can undermine 
soft power. For example, there was a steep decline in the attractiveness of the US in

American Soft Power in the Age of Trump
73
opinion polls conducted after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the 1970s, many people 
around the world objected to the US war in Vietnam, and America’s global standing 
reﬂected the unpopularity of that policy. 
Skeptics argue that such cycles show that soft power does not matter much; 
countries cooperate out of self-interest. But, this argument misses a crucial point: 
Cooperation is a matter of degree, and the degree is affected by attraction or repulsion. 
Fortunately, a country’s soft power depends not only on its ofﬁcial policies, but 
also on the attractiveness of its civil society. When protesters overseas were marching 
against the Vietnam War, they often sang “We Shall Overcome,” an anthem of the 
US civil rights movement. Given past experience, there is every reason to hope that 
the US will recover its soft power after Trump, though a greater investment in public 
diplomacy would certainly help.

Trump’s Effect on US Foreign Policy 
Originally published 
by Project Syndicate 
on September 4, 2019. 
The long-term impact that Donald Trump has left on US foreign policy remains 
uncertain, and the debate over this has revived a longstanding question: Are major 
historical outcomes the product of human choices or are they largely the result of 
overwhelming structural factors produced by economic and political forces beyond 
our control? If the latter is true, then we will continue to face the same problems in 
the foreseeable future. 
US President Donald Trump’s behavior at the recent G7 meeting in Biarritz was 
criticized as careless and disruptive by many observers. Others argued that the press 
and pundits pay too much attention to Trump’s personal antics, tweets, and political 
games. In the long run, they argue, historians will consider them mere peccadilloes. 
The larger question is whether the Trump presidency proves to be a major turning 
point in American foreign policy or a minor historical blip. 
The current debate over Trump revives a longstanding question: Are major histor-
ical outcomes the product of human choices or are they largely the result of over-
whelming structural factors produced by economic and political forces beyond our 
control? 
Some analysts liken the ﬂow of history to a rushing river, whose course is shaped 
by the climate, rainfall, geology, and topography, not by whatever the river carries. 
But even if this were so, human agents are not simply ants clinging to a log swept 
along by the current. They are more like white-water rafters trying to steer and fend 
off rocks, occasionally overturning and sometimes succeeding in steering to a desired 
destination.

Trump’s Effect on US Foreign Policy
Understanding leaders’ choices and failures in American foreign policy over the 
past century can better equip us to cope with the questions we face today about the 
Trump presidency. Leaders in every age think they are dealing with unique forces of 
change, but human nature remains. Choices can matter; acts of omission can be as 
consequential as acts of commission. Failure by American leaders to act in the 1930s 
contributed to hell on Earth; so did refusal by American presidents to use nuclear 
weapons when the United States held a monopoly on them. 
Were such major choices determined by the situation or the person? Looking 
back a century, Woodrow Wilson broke with tradition and sent US forces to ﬁght in 
Europe, but that might have occurred anyway under another leader (say, Theodore 
Roosevelt). Where Wilson made a big difference was in the moralistic tone of his 
justiﬁcation, and, counterproductively, in his stubborn insistence on all or nothing 
for involvement in the League of Nations. Some blame Wilson’s moralism for the 
severity of the America’s return to isolationism in the 1930s. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt was unable to bring the US into World War II until Pearl 
Harbor, and that might have occurred even under a conservative isolationist. Nonethe-
less, Roosevelt’s framing of the threat posed by Hitler, and his preparations to 
confront that threat were crucial for American participation in the war in Europe. 
After World War II, the structure of bipolarity of two superpowers set the frame-
work for the Cold War. But, the style and timing of the American response might have 
been different had Henry Wallace (whom FDR ditched as vice president in 1944), 
instead of Harry Truman, become president. After the 1952 election, an isolationist 
Robert Taft or an assertive Douglas MacArthur presidency might have disrupted the 
relatively smooth consolidation of Truman’s containment strategy, over which the 
latter’s successor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, presided. 
John F. Kennedy was crucial in averting nuclear war during the Cuban Missile 
Crisis, and then signing the ﬁrst nuclear arms control agreement. But, he and Lyndon 
B. Johnson mired the country in the unnecessary and costly ﬁasco of the Vietnam War. 
At the end of the century, structural forces caused the erosion of the Soviet Union, and 
Mikhail Gorbachev speeded up the timing of Soviet collapse. But, Ronald Reagan’s 
defense buildup and negotiating skill, and George H.W. Bush’s skill in managing 
crises, played a signiﬁcant role in bringing about a peaceful end to the Cold War. 
In other words, leaders and their skills matter. In a sense, this is bad news, because 
it means that Trump’s behavior cannot be easily dismissed. More important than 
his tweets are his weakening of institutions, alliances, and America’s soft power of 
attraction, which polls show as having declined under Trump. He is the ﬁrst president 
in 70 years to turn away from the liberal international order that the US created after 
WWII. General James Mattis, who resigned after serving as Trump’s ﬁrst secretary 
of defense, recently lamented the president’s neglect of alliances. 
Presidents need to use both hard and soft power, combining them in ways that are 
complementary rather than contradictory. Machiavellian and organizational skills are 
essential, but so is emotional intelligence, which produces the skills of self-awareness 
and self-control, and contextual intelligence, which enables leaders to understand an 
evolving environment, capitalize on trends, and apply their other skills accordingly. 
Emotional and contextual intelligences are not Trump’s strong suit.

Trump’s Effect on US Foreign Policy
77
The leadership theorist Gautam Mukunda has pointed out that leaders who are 
carefully ﬁltered through established political processes tend to be predictable. 
George H.W. Bush is a good example. Others are unﬁltered, and how they perform 
in power varies widely. Abraham Lincoln was a relatively unﬁltered candidate and 
was one of the best American presidents. Trump, who never served in ofﬁce before 
winning the presidency and entered politics from a background of New York real 
estate and reality television, has proven to be extraordinarily skilled in mastering 
modern media, defying conventional wisdom, and disruptive innovation. While some 
believe this may produce positive results, for example, with China, others remain 
skeptical. 
Trump’s role in history may depend on whether he is re-elected. Institutions, trust, 
and soft power are more likely to erode if he is in ofﬁce for eight years rather than 
four. But, in either event, his successor will confront a changed world, partly because 
of the effects of Trump’s policies, but also because of major structural power shifts 
in world politics, both from West to East (the rise of Asia), and from government 
to non-state actors (empowered by cyber and artiﬁcial intelligence). As Karl Marx 
observed, we make history, but not under conditions of our own choosing. American 
foreign policy after Trump remains an open question.

Can Joe Biden’s America Be Trusted? 
Originally published 
by Project Syndicate on 
December 4, 2020. 
The decline in America’s image among friends and allies has led to distrust, perhaps 
one of the greatest challenges facing US soft power . Joe Biden will have to do all that 
he can, at home and abroad, to repair that damage. However, the biggest challenge to 
this is not the trust in Biden and the US government, but in the American democratic 
process and its people. 
Friends and allies have come to distrust the United States. Trust is closely related to 
truth, and President Donald Trump is notoriously loose with the truth. All presidents 
have lied, but never on such a scale that it debases the currency of trust. International 
polls show that America’s soft power of attraction has declined sharply over Trump’s 
presidency. 
Can President-elect Joe Biden restore that trust? In the short run, yes. A change 
of style and policy will improve America’s standing in most countries. Trump was 
an outlier among US presidents. The presidency was his ﬁrst job in government, 
after spending his career in the zero-sum world of New York City real estate and 
reality television, where outrageous statements hold the media’s attention and help 
you control the agenda. 
In contrast, Biden is a well-vetted politician with long experience in foreign policy 
derived from decades in the Senate and eight years as vice president. Since the 
election, his initial statements and appointments have had a profoundly reassuring 
effect on allies. 
Trump’s problem with allies was not his slogan “America First.” As I argue in Do 
Morals Matter? Presidents and Foreign Policy from FDR to Trump, presidents are

entrusted with promoting the national interest. The important moral issue is how a 
president deﬁnes the national interest. 
Trump chose narrow transactional deﬁnitions and, according to his former national 
security adviser, John Bolton sometimes confused the national interest with his own 
personal, political, and ﬁnancial interests. In contrast, many US presidents since 
Harry Truman have often taken a broad view of the national interest and did not 
confuse it with their own. Truman saw that helping others was in America’s national 
interest, and even forswore putting his name on the Marshall Plan for assistance to 
post-war reconstruction in Europe. 
In contrast, Trump had disdain for alliances and multilateralism, which he readily 
displayed at meetings of the G7 or NATO. Even when he took useful actions in 
standing up to abusive Chinese trade practices, he failed to coordinate pressure on 
China, instead levying tariffs on US allies. Small wonder that many of them wondered 
if America’s (proper) opposition to the Chinese tech giant Huawei was motivated by 
commercial rather than security concerns. 
And Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health 
Organization sowed mistrust about American commitment to dealing with transna-
tional global threats such as global warming and pandemics. Biden’s plan to rejoin 
both, and his reassurances about NATO, will have an immediate beneﬁcial effect on 
US soft power. 
But, Biden will still face a deeper trust problem. Many allies are asking what is 
happening to American democracy. How can a country that produced as strange a 
political leader as Trump in 2016 be trusted not to produce another in 2024 or 2028? 
Is American democracy in decline, making the country untrustworthy? 
The declining trust in government and other institutions that fueled Trump’s rise 
did not start with him. Low trust in government has been a US malady for a half-
century. After success in World War II, three-quarters of Americans said they had 
a high degree of trust in government. This share fell to roughly one-quarter after 
the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal of the 1960s and 1970s. Fortunately, 
citizens’ behavior on issues like tax compliance was often much better than their 
replies to pollsters might suggest. 
Perhaps the best demonstration of the underlying strength and resilience of Amer-
ican democratic culture was the 2020 election. Despite the worst pandemic in a 
century and dire predictions of chaotic voting conditions, a record number of voters 
turned out, and the thousands of local ofﬁcials—Republicans, Democrats, and inde-
pendents—who administered the election regarded the honest execution of their tasks 
as a civic duty. 
In Georgia, which Trump narrowly lost, the Republican secretary of state, respon-
sible for overseeing the election, deﬁed baseless criticism from Trump and other 
Republicans, declaring, “I live by the motto that numbers don’t lie.” Trump’s lawsuits 
alleging massive fraud, lacking any evidence to support them, were thrown out in 
court after court, including by judges Trump had appointed. And Republicans in 
Michigan and Pennsylvania resisted his efforts to have state legislators overturn the 
election results. Contrary to the left’s predictions of doom and the right’s predictions 
of fraud, American democracy proved its strength and deep local roots.

Can Joe Biden’s America Be Trusted?
81
But, Americans, including Biden, will still face allies’ concerns about whether 
they can be trusted not to elect another Trump in 2024 or 2028. They note the polar-
ization of the political parties, Trump’s refusal to accept his defeat, and the refusal 
of congressional Republican leaders to condemn his behavior or even explicitly 
recognize Biden’s victory. 
Trump has used his base of fervent supporters to gain control of the Republican 
Party by threatening to support primary challenges to moderates who don’t fall 
into line. Journalists report that about half the Republicans in the Senate disdain 
Trump, but they also fear him. If Trump tries to maintain control over the party 
after he leaves the White House, Biden will face a difﬁcult task working with a 
Republican-controlled Senate. 
Fortunately for US allies, while Biden’s political skills will be tested, the US 
Constitution provides a president more leeway in foreign than in domestic policy, so 
the short-term improvements in cooperation will be real. Moreover, unlike in 2016, 
when Trump was elected, a recent Chicago Council on Global Affairs poll shows that 
70% of Americans want an outward-oriented cooperative foreign policy– a record 
high. 
But, the lingering long-run question of whether allies can trust America not to 
produce another Trump cannot be answered with complete assurance. Much will 
depend on controlling the pandemic, restoring the economy, and Biden’s political 
skill in managing the country’s political polarization.

After the Liberal International Order 
Originally published by 
Project Syndicate on 
July 6, 2020. 
The election of Joe Biden as president sent a sigh of relief through the world, but 
he faced the question of what to do with the effectively defunct liberal international 
order. His burden was how to cooperate with an inner core of allies to promote 
democracy and human rights while working with a broader set of states to manage 
rules-based international organizations to face transnational threats. 
Many analysts argue that the liberal international order ended with the rise of China 
and the election of US President Donald Trump. But, if Joe Biden defeats Trump in 
November’s election, should he try to revive it? Probably not, but he must replace it. 
Critics correctly point out that the American order after 1945 was neither global 
nor always very liberal. It left out more than half the world (the Soviet bloc and 
China) and included many authoritarian states. American hegemony was always 
exaggerated. Nonetheless, the most powerful country must lead in creating global 
public goods, or they will not be provided—and Americans will suffer. 
The current pandemic is a case in point. A realistic goal for a Biden admin-
istration should be to establish rules-based international institutions with different 
membership for different issues. 
Would China and Russia agree to participate? During the 1990s and 2000s, neither 
could balance American power, and the United States overrode sovereignty in pursuit 
of liberal values. The US bombed Serbia and invaded Iraq without approval by 
the United Nations Security Council. It also supported a UN General Assembly 
resolution in 2005 that established a “Responsibility to Protect” citizens brutalized

After the Liberal International Order
by their own governments—a doctrine it then used in 2011 to justify bombing Libya 
to protect the citizens of Benghazi. 
Critics describe this record as post-Cold War American hubris—Russia and China 
felt deceived, for example, when the NATO-led intervention in Libya resulted in 
regime change—whereas defenders portray it as the natural evolution of international 
humanitarian law. In any case, the growth of Chinese and Russian power has set 
stricter limits to liberal interventionism. 
What is left? Russia and China stress the norm of sovereignty in the UN Charter, 
according to which states can go to war only for self-defense or with Security Council 
approval. Taking a neighbor’s territory by force has been rare since 1945 and has 
led to costly sanctions when it has happened (as with Russia’s annexation of Crimea 
in 2014). In addition, the Security Council has often authorized the deployment of 
peacekeeping forces in troubled countries, and political cooperation has limited the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. This dimension 
of a rules-based order remains crucial. 
As for economic relations, the rules will require revision. Well before the 
pandemic, China’s hybrid state capitalism underpinned an unfair mercantilist model 
that distorted the functioning of the World Trade Organization. The result will be a 
decoupling of global supply chains, particularly where national security is at stake. 
Although China complains when the US prevents companies like Huawei from 
building 5G telecommunications networks in the West, this position is consistent 
with sovereignty. After all, China prevents Google, Facebook, and Twitter from 
operating in China for security reasons. Negotiating new trade rules can help prevent 
the decoupling from escalating. At the same time, cooperation in the crucial ﬁnancial 
domain remains strong, despite the current crisis. 
By contrast, ecological interdependence poses an insurmountable obstacle to 
sovereignty, because the threats are transnational. Regardless of setbacks for 
economic globalization, environmental globalization will continue, because it obeys 
the laws of biology and physics, not the logic of contemporary geopolitics. Such 
issues threaten everyone, but no country can manage them alone. On issues like 
COVID-19 and climate change, power has a positive-sum dimension. 
In this context, it is not enough to think of exercising power over others. We must 
also think in terms of exercising power with others. The Paris climate agreement and 
the World Health Organization help us as well as others. Since Richard Nixon and 
Mao Zedong met in 1972, China and the US have cooperated despite ideological 
differences. The difﬁcult question for Biden will be whether the US and China can 
cooperate in producing global public goods while competing in the traditional areas 
of great-power rivalry. 
Cyberspace is an important new issue—partly transnational, but also subject to 
sovereign government controls. The Internet is already partly fragmented. Norms 
regarding free speech and privacy on the Internet can be developed among an inner 
circle of democracies, but will not be observed by authoritarian states. 
As suggested by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, some 
rules barring tampering with the Internet’s basic structure are also in authoritar-
ians’ interests if they want connectivity. But, when they use proxies for information

warfare or to interfere in elections (which violates sovereignty), norms will have to 
be reinforced by rules such as those the US and the Soviet Union negotiated during 
the Cold War (despite ideological hostility) to limit the escalation of incidents at 
sea. The US and like-minded states will have to announce the norms they intend to 
uphold, and deterrence will be necessary. 
Insistence on liberal values in cyberspace would not mean unilateral US disarma-
ment. Rather, the US should distinguish between the permitted soft power of open 
persuasion and the hard power of covert information warfare, in which case it would 
retaliate. Overt programs and broadcasts by Russia and China would be allowed, 
but that would not be true for covert coordinated behavior such as manipulation of 
social media. And the US would continue to criticize these countries’ human rights 
records. 
Polls show that the US public wants to avoid military interventions, but not to 
withdraw from alliances or multilateral cooperation. And the public still cares about 
values. 
If Biden is elected, the question he will face is not whether to restore the liberal 
international order. It is whether the US can work with an inner core of allies to 
promote democracy and human rights while cooperating with a broader set of states to 
manage the rules-based international institutions needed to face transnational threats 
such as climate change, pandemics, cyberattacks, terrorism, and economic instability.

The Rise of Chinese Soft Power 
Following Reform and Opening, China has changed dramatically in almost every 
way possible. Rapid economic development has thrust it onto the world stage, almost 
unwillingly. China’s relatively weak military position and emphasis on a peaceful 
rise have made “soft power” an attractive option for China, leveraging its cultural 
and economic resources with programs like the Confucius Institute and the Belt and 
Road Initiative. While these programs have made headway with developing nations, 
China’s position on both domestic and foreign issues has created a fundamental rift 
with the West and even neighboring countries. The question is how can China get 
“smart” on how it uses soft power?

As China Rises, Must Others Bow? 
Originally published in the 
June 25, 1998 edition 
of The Economist. 
At the close of the twentieth century, my answer to this question was a resounding 
‘no’. As then-President Clinton visited China, the focus was on economic growth 
rather than military inﬂuence, and the view was the United States could maintain 
its inﬂuence in Asia as China rose. Times change, but it is essential to reﬂect on 
different periods in China’s development as well as the positions taken on China at 
the various phases of its development. 
Ever since Thucydides’s explanation of the Peloponnesian war, historians have 
known that the rise of a new power has been attended by uncertainty and anxieties. 
Often, though not always, violent conﬂict has followed. The rise in the economic 
and military power of China, the world’s most populous country, will be a central 
question for Asia and for American foreign policy at the beginning of a new century. 
Explaining why democratic Athens decided to break a treaty that led to war, Thucy-
dides pointed to the power of expectations of inevitable conﬂict. “The general belief 
was that whatever happened, war with the Peloponnese was bound to come,” he wrote. 
Belief in the inevitability of conﬂict with China could have similar self-fulﬁlling 
effects. 
Thucydides attributed the real cause of war to the rise in the power of Athens 
and the fear that created in Sparta. One does not have to linger long in Washington 
these days to encounter anxiety about China. President Clinton’s visit to Beijing has 
been broadly criticized. Three times in two weeks recently, the House of Represen-
tatives rebuked the administration over China by large majorities. To some extent, 
those votes reﬂected partisan wrangling in an election year. Republicans have made 
campaign issues out of the sloppiness of Democratic Party fund-raising and questions

of technology transfer involved in allowing China to launch American commercial 
satellites. (Whatever the wisdom of allowing such launches, the policy originated in 
Republican administrations.) 
The domestic politics of China policy, however, are more complicated than these 
particular issues. Many Democrats also voted to condemn the president’s visit. The 
split over China policy is not between liberals and conservatives. As the speaker of 
the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, has said, “Some of my friends are in 
the opponent business and want a new enemy.” In addition, America’s religious right 
objects to religious persecution and forced abortion; liberals object to human rights 
violations and worker exploitation. Both the liberal New Republic and the conserva-
tive Weekly Standard call China “totalitarian,” though today’s market communism 
is a far cry from the real totalitarianism of Chairman Mao. The domestic politics of 
China policy, however, is a strange alliance of left and right against the center. The 
central lines of policy have been in place since the Nixon administration. The policy 
was broadly accepted during the Cold War, but criticized after the 1989 Tiananmen 
Square killings. 
Ironically, Bill Clinton attacked George Bush’s China policy (from the left) in 
the 1992 campaign, but soon switched to the center once he was in ofﬁce. Now Mr 
Clinton has inherited the criticism and ﬁnds support for his trip from none other than 
Mr Bush. In a recent speech, Mr Clinton defended his trip: “Some Americans believe 
we should try to isolate and contain China because of its undemocratic system and 
human rights violation, and in order to retard its capacity to become America’s next 
great enemy… Choosing isolation over engagement would not make the world safer. 
It would make it more dangerous.” Critics to the contrary, Mr Clinton’s rationale 
stressed long-term strategy, not short-run commercial considerations. 
What are the facts about China’s power? The “rise of China” is, of course, a 
misnomer. “Re-emergence” would be more accurate. By its size and history, China 
has long been a major power in the Asia–Paciﬁc region. Technologically and econom-
ically, China was the world’s leader (though without global reach) from 500 to 1500. 
Only in the past half-millennium was it overtaken by Europe and America. China’s 
experience was partly the result of internal problems, but it also reﬂected broader 
global changes that affected the world as a whole. Japan was the Asian leader in 
adapting to these global economic forces, and its early success compounded China’s 
losses between 1895 and 1945. 
Before 1979, China was not yet part of the East Asian transformation. In 1978, 
China was poorer per head than Korea or Taiwan in 1960. Since then, China’s history 
has been dominated by economics, with growth rates of 8–9% per year that have led 
to a tripling of its GNP in less than two decades. At a more sustainable rate of growth 
of 6% per head, China would reach $10,000-per-person income in 30 years, and its 
economy would then total about $16 trillion, or twice the size of the current American 
economy. The Asian Development Bank projects Chinese income per head to reach 
the equivalent of about 38% of the United States’ in 2025, about the same relative 
level that South Korea reached in 1990.

Look Both Ways
91
Look Both Ways 
Linear projections are suspect, and China faces short-term problems with its state-
owned enterprises, its shaky banking system, and the value of its currency. Over the 
long term, the Asian Development Bank posits two scenarios (assuming no major 
political disruptions). The optimistic scenario foresees growth of 7–8% per head 
over the next decade, falling toward 5–6% in the 2020s as dependency rates rise 
and savings fall. Under the pessimistic scenario, China would fail to make essential 
reforms and bottlenecks and growing income equality would slow growth to 4– 
5% per head. Even at the higher growth rates, China would lag behind the OECD 
countries in terms of income per person. 
Is China’s growing economic strength a base for equivalent military power? The 
answer is contentious, since China does not divulge all its defense-related expendi-
ture. The ofﬁcial military budget does not account for the 600,000 People’s Armed 
Police, nuclear weapons procurement, some defense-related R&D, or soldiers’ 
pensions. In a recent book, “The Coming Conﬂict with China,” Richard Bernstein, 
and Ross Munro argue that the ofﬁcial Chinese military budget for 1996 was 69.8 
billion yuan or about $8.7 billion. The most conservative western analysts would 
multiply that ﬁgure by three, to reach a $26.1 billion amount. That is already close 
to half the Japanese defense budget, which is roughly $50 billion. Our multiple of 
ten would put China’s actual defense spending at around $87 billion per year, which 
would make it nearly one-third the amount of American spending. Moreover, the 
1996 ﬁgure was 11.3% higher than 1995. 
Other analysts are less alarmist than Messrs Bernstein and Munro. The East–West 
Centre in Hawaii argues that China’s military modernization is still far from meeting 
its defense needs. Military expenditures have been very low, especially when consid-
ered against the size of the country and military… China’s low military spending 
reﬂects a clear-cut policy choice—that military modernization is subordinated to and 
supportive of national economic reconstruction. 
Military spending dropped steadily in the 1980s. In the 1990s, it began to increase 
moderately, partly in response to the events of Tiananmen Square in 1989 and partly 
due to the lessons of the Gulf war two years later. Much of China’s increased spending 
was applied to salaries and infrastructure, not to weapons systems. 
American government ﬁgures show that, adjusted for inﬂation, China’s military 
spending declined slightly between 1984 and 1994. Much of China’s equipment is 
obsolete; command, control, and communications capabilities are weak; combined-
forces exercises are limited, and power-projection capabilities are very limited. In the 
Taiwan Straits imbroglio of 1996, most expert observers believed that Taiwan could 
have repelled a cross-straits invasion even without the United States’ navy becoming 
involved. 
Chinese capability to ﬁght a serious engagement in the South China Sea is also 
doubtful. A leaked American navy report concluded that the Chinese air force and 
naval air force are “obsolescent and incapable of mounting any effective large-scale 
and sustained air operations.”

92
As China Rises, Must Others Bow?
Chinese military leaders are well aware of these deﬁciencies and want to correct 
them. The Gulf war showed them how far China lagged behind modern military 
capabilities, and the Taiwan events of 1996 reinforced their concern to improve their 
offshore capability. Because of the economic distress of the former Soviet states, 
and joint Russian and Chinese concerns about American global dominance, China 
has been able to import impressive ex-Soviet equipment at reasonable prices. The 
key question, however, is how quickly new imports and investments will remedy the 
current defects of Chinese military forces. 
The Systems Question 
Those who wish to paint an alarming picture concentrate on the new equipment 
and its capabilities. Those who wish to paint a less alarming picture point out that 
success in battle requires the integration of new equipment with existing capabilities 
and doctrines, many of which remain deﬁcient. For instance, having ﬁrst-class long-
distance ﬁghters or even an aircraft carrier does not ensure dominance of the South 
China Sea unless logistics and command and control are adequate to the task. It is 
not enough just to have a few pieces of the puzzle. 
David Shambaugh, an analyst of the Chinese armed forces, argues that “The recent 
hype in the media and by those in the American political system about the so-called 
Chinese threat is grossly overblown, not empirically grounded, irresponsible and 
politically dangerous.” 
Whatever the accuracy of such assessments of China’s military programs, the key 
question is net assessment, and that depends on what the United States (and other 
countries) will be doing over the next decades. The United States will not be standing 
still. Military power in the information age will depend on the ability to collect, 
process, act upon and disseminate information so as to achieve dominant battle-space 
awareness. This will depend on such technologies as space-based surveillance, direct 
broadcasting, high-speed computers, and, above all, the ability to integrate complex 
information systems. Other countries will develop some of these technologies, but 
the key capacity will be the ability to integrate a system of systems. 
Again, having a piece of the puzzle is not sufﬁcient. The position of the American 
economy as the leader in information technologies combined with the investments 
in the American defense budget make it very unlikely that the United States will lose 
this lead. According to an Australian expert, Paul Dibb, the revolution in military 
affairs will continue to favor heavily American military predominance. It is not likely 
that China will, in any meaningful way, close the gap with America. 
Chinese military strength is likely to grow over the next decades. Even if that 
does not make China a global or even regional power equivalent to the United States, 
it does mean that China is likely to look more awesome to its regional neighbors, 
and its enhanced capabilities will mean that any American military tasks will require 
greater forces and resources than is the case at present. In other words, the rise of 
Chinese military power, similar to the rise of its economic power, must be taken

seriously as a new factor in the region; but, China will not be a global challenger to 
the United States, nor will it be able to exercise regional hegemony so long as the 
United States stays involved in East Asia. 
Common Interests 
The Clinton administration has described its policy toward China as “constructive 
engagement,” but the debate between “containment” and “engagement” is too simple. 
Engagement does not prescribe how to handle hard issues such as Taiwan, trade or 
human rights. It did not preclude the Clinton administration from sending two carriers 
to patrol off Taiwan in 1996 or from insisting on proper conditions for Chinese entry 
into the World Trade Organization. 
Despite the descriptive inadequacy of the slogans, “engagement” signiﬁes that 
the United States has rejected the inevitability of conﬂict. President Clinton told 
President Jiang Zemin in 1995 that a “stable, open, and prosperous China—in other 
words, a strong China—is in our interest. We welcome China to the great-power 
table. But, great powers also have great responsibilities.” The United States has also 
reafﬁrmed its commitment to a “one-China” policy, thus ruling out any ﬂirtation 
with the idea of independence for Taiwan, the single most dangerous scenario for 
potential conﬂict between the United States and China. The United States remains 
committed by law and policy to ensuring that Taiwan cannot be taken over by force, 
but not to defending its independence should the island declare it unilaterally. 
Notwithstanding differences on trade, human rights and some of the details of 
non-proliferation policy that are likely to arise at the summit, the United States 
also sees common interests with China. As Mr Clinton pointed out last week, both 
countries have an interest in stability that allows the economic prosperity of the 
region to grow, and China has acted responsibly in the recent ﬁnancial crisis. Neither 
country wants a conﬂict on the Korean peninsula or in Asia following the Indian and 
Pakistani tests. Chinese behavior on proliferation has improved considerably over 
the past decade. Moreover, a weak or chaotic China that could not feed its people, 
stem ﬂows of refugees, deal with smuggling or manage its environmental problems 
is not in America’s interest. 
In February 1995, the Defense Department issued a report, “United States Strategy 
for the East Asia–Paciﬁc Region,” that outlined a four-part strategy: 
. maintain the forward presence of about 100,000 American troops in the region; 
. put America’s alliances, particularly with Japan, on a ﬁrm basis; 
. try to develop multilateral institutions such as the ASEAN Regional Forum while 
recognizing they are still weak; 
. from that position of strength, encourage China to deﬁne its interests in ways that 
could be compatible with America’s and its neighbors’. 
The American alliance with Japan, where the largest number of troops are 
stationed, is critical to American strategy. Over the past three years, the security

94
As China Rises, Must Others Bow?
relationship has been greatly strengthened, and recent polls show that two-thirds of 
the Japanese people support it. In April 1996, the Japanese prime minister, Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, and Mr Clinton publicly afﬁrmed the work of a joint group that rede-
ﬁned the United States-Japan Security Treaty as the basis for stability in the region 
after the Cold War, and in 1997, the two countries agreed on guidelines for defense 
co-operation. That reafﬁrmation may turn out to be one of the most important policy 
developments for the region. It means that China cannot play a Japan card against 
the United States or try to expel the Americans from the region. From that position 
of strength, America can work to engage China as a responsible regional power. 
The Case for Friendship 
How China will behave as its power grows is an open question. Unconstrained, 
it might someday wish to expel the United States from the region and exercise 
hegemony over its neighbors. But, in the real world of constraints, states learn to 
deﬁne their interests in practical ways. The United States will remain the largest 
power in the world well into the next century. The American presence in East Asia 
provides a stability, which, in the absence of other institutions, has beneﬁts for all 
countries in the region. So long as the Americans exercise their power in a reasonable 
way so that other countries (including China) continue to beneﬁt from the stabilizing 
effects, and so long as the United States invests wisely to maintain its power resources, 
it is unlikely that any country or coalition will be in the position of a strong challenger. 
If the United States treats China as an enemy now, it will guarantee an enemy in 
the future. If China becomes aggressive in the future, the current policy is reversible. 
In that sense, only China can produce the conditions for its containment. If the United 
States engages China, there is no guarantee of friendship, but at least, there will be 
a reasonable prospect. To discard the chances of a more benign future through a 
misguided belief in the inevitability of conﬂict would be a tragic mistake. Such a 
larger strategic vision, representing the bipartisan tradition on China policy, should 
outweigh the domestic politics that currently cloud President Clinton’s trip.

The Rise of China’s Soft Power 
Originally published in 
the December 29, 2005 
edition of the Wall Street 
Journal. 
By the early days of the twenty-ﬁrst century, China’s rise was already recognized 
and an unavoidable reality. How that rise would progress would doubtlessly impact 
the United States and other established powers. China’s use of soft power in its rise 
is of special note as its soft power resources are few and far between, while instances 
that tarnish its image, at least in the eyes of the liberal West, are difﬁcult to overcome. 
The United States was noticeably absent from the guest list when countries from 
Australia to India gathered recently in Malaysia for the ﬁrst East Asian Summit. It 
was a meeting which some fear marks the ﬁrst step in China’s long-term ambition 
to build a new regional power structure, known as the East Asian Community, that 
excludes Washington. Couple that with a recent BBC poll of 22 countries, which 
found that nearly half the respondents saw Beijing’s inﬂuence as positive compared 
to 38% who said the same for the U.S., and it is clear that the rise of China’s soft 
power—at America’s expense—is an issue that needs to be urgently addressed. 
While recent U.S. Congressional reports have focused on the rise of China’s 
economic and military power, far less attention has been paid to the rise of China’s 
soft power. Yet in a global information age, soft sources of power such as culture, 
political values, and diplomacy are part of what makes a great power. Success depends 
not only on whose army wins, but also on whose story wins. 
China has always had an attractive traditional culture, but now it is entering 
the realm of global popular culture as well. Chinese novelist Gao Xingjian won 
China’s ﬁrst Nobel Prize for Literature in 2000, and the Chinese ﬁlm “Crouching 
Tiger, Hidden Dragon” became the highest grossing non-English ﬁlm. Yao Ming, 
the Chinese star of the U.S. National Basketball Association’s Houston Rockets,

is rapidly becoming a household name, and China is set to host the 2008 Summer 
Olympics. The enrolment of foreign students in China has tripled to 110,000 from 
36,000 over the past decade, and the number of foreign tourists has also increased 
dramatically to 17 million last year. China has created 26 Confucius Institutes around 
the world to teach its language and culture, and while the Voice of America was 
cutting its Chinese broadcasts to 14 from 19 hours a day, China Radio International 
was increasing its broadcasts in English to 24 hours a day. 
In terms of political values, the era of Maoism (and Mao jackets) is long past. 
Although China remains authoritarian, the success of its political economy in tripling 
gross domestic product over the past three decades has made it attractive to many 
developing countries. In parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America, the so-called “Bei-
jing consensus” on authoritarian government plus a market economy has become 
more popular than the previously dominant “Washington consensus” of market 
economics with democratic government. China has reinforced this attraction by 
economic aid and access to its growing market. 
China has also adjusted its diplomacy. A decade ago, it was wary of multilateral 
arrangements and at cross purposes with many of its neighbors. Since then, it has 
joined the World Trade Organization, contributed more than 3000 troops to serve 
in United Nations peacekeeping operations, become more helpful on nonprolifera-
tion issues (including hosting the six-party talks on North Korea), settled territorial 
disputes with its neighbors, and joined a variety of regional organizations. This new 
diplomacy, coupled with the slogan of “China’s peaceful rise,” helps to alleviate fears 
and reduce the likelihood of other countries allying to balance a rising power. 
But just as China’s economic and military power is far from matching that of the 
U.S., China’s soft power still has a long way to go. China does not have cultural 
industries like Hollywood, and its universities are far from the equal of America’s. It 
lacks the many nongovernmental organizations that generate much of America’s soft 
power. Politically, China suffers from corruption, inequality, and a lack of democracy, 
human rights and the rule of law. While that may make the “Beijing consensus” 
attractive in authoritarian and semi-authoritarian developing countries, it undercuts 
China’s soft power in the West. Although China’s new diplomacy has enhanced its 
attractiveness to its neighbors in Southeast Asia, the continuing belligerence of its 
hard power stance toward Taiwan hurts it in Europe in early 2005. China’s efforts 
to persuade the Europeans to relax an embargo on the sale of arms imposed in the 
aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre foundered after its enactment of 
an anti-secession law mandating the use of force against Taiwan. 
Nonetheless, although China is far from America’s equal in soft power, it would be 
foolish to ignore the gains it is making. The declining poll results and Washington’s 
absence from the East Asian summit are warning lights. It is time for the U.S. to pay 
more attention to the balance of soft power in Asia.

Hard Decisions on Soft Power: 
Opportunities and Difﬁculties 
for Chinese Soft Power 
Originally published in the Summer 2009 edition of the 
Harvard International Review, co-authored by Joseph S. Nye, Jr. 
and Wang Jisi, Dean of School of International 
Studies of Peking University. This article is a shorter 
version of their chapter in Power and Restraint 
edited by Richard Rosecrance and Gu Guoliang. 
Soft power in China is not only in the early stages of its formation, it is also based 
on very different foundations than in the US or other developed countries. These 
systemic and values-based considerations mean that Chinese soft power may be 
unfamiliar or unpalatable to those outside the Chinese system. However, China is a 
rising power is attractive in the developing world, which makes it a force that cannot 
be ignored. 
Broadly deﬁned, power is the ability to affect others to obtain the outcomes one 
wants. One can affect other individuals’ behavior in three main ways: by threatening 
coercion (“sticks”), by offering inducements or payments (“carrots”), and by making 
others want what one wants. A country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world 
politics because other countries want to follow it. They may display this desire 
by admiring the country’s values, emulating its example, or aspiring to its level of 
prosperity and openness. In this sense, it is not only important in world politics to force 
other countries to change by the threat or use of military or economic weapons, but 
also to set the agenda and attract others. This “soft power”—getting other countries 
to want the outcomes that a particular country wants—coopts people rather than 
coerces them. In the debate about the rise of Chinese power and how it will affect the 
United States and global stability, one question that has received increasing attention 
in both countries is precisely that of China’s soft power. After more fully exploring 
soft power itself, this article explores the various aspects of this kind of power when

applied to the Chinese context. To conclude, it considers how China can best use its 
soft power to be beneﬁcial to the international community. 
Soft Power 
Soft power rests on the ability to shape the preferences of others. This type of power 
does not belong to any one country. Nor does soft power belong solely to countries. At 
the personal level, individuals know the power of attraction and seduction. Political 
leaders have long understood the power that comes from setting the agenda and 
determining the framework of a debate. 
While not the same as inﬂuence, soft power serves as a source of inﬂuence. 
Inﬂuence can also rest on the hard power of threats or payments. And soft power 
represents more than just persuasion or the ability to move people by argument, 
though this constitutes a crucial part of this kind of power. Soft power also includes 
the ability to entice and attract. In behavioral terms, it means attractive power. In terms 
of resources, soft power resources are the assets that produce such attraction. Some 
resources can produce both hard and soft power. For example, a strong economy 
can produce important carrots for paying others, as well as a model of success that 
attracts others. Whether a particular asset is a soft power resource that produces 
attraction can be measured by asking people through polls or focus groups whether 
they like a country. That attraction may in turn produce desired policy outcomes. But, 
the gap between power measured as resources and power judged as the outcomes 
of behavior is not unique to soft power. A similar disparity occurs with all forms 
of power. Before the fall of France in 1940, for example, Britain and France had 
more tanks than Germany, but that advantage in military power resources did not 
accurately predict the outcome of the battle. 
In international politics, the resources that produce soft power arise in large part 
from the values an organization or country expresses in its culture, in the examples it 
sets by its internal practices and policies, and in the way it handles its relations with 
others. Governments sometime ﬁnd it difﬁcult to control and employ soft power, but 
that does not diminish its importance. The soft power of a country rests primarily 
on three resources: its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political 
values (when the country lives up to these values at home and abroad), and its foreign 
policies (when other nations see the country as a legitimate and moral authority). 
The “Soft Power” Discourse in China 
Rather than ignoring these gains, the Chinese display active interest in the idea 
of “soft power.” Since the early 1990s, dozens, if not more, of soft power-themed 
essays and scholarly articles have been published in the country. In fact, in late 2006,

How the Chinese View Their Soft Power
103
a Chinese journal entitled Soft Power published its ﬁrst issue, although the contents 
of the journal are mostly related to the business world. 
“Soft power” has also entered China’s ofﬁcial language. In his keynote, speech to 
the 17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on October 15, 
2007, Hu Jintao stated that the CCP must “enhance culture as part of the soft power 
of our country to better guarantee the people’s basic cultural rights and interests.” 
He recognized in that speech that “culture has become a more and more important 
source of national cohesion and creativity and a factor of growing signiﬁcance in the 
competition in overall national strength,” And while there does not seem to be any 
ofﬁcial effort in China to deﬁne the term “soft power,” Chinese scholars continue to 
debate its scope, deﬁnition, and application. They do not agree with one another as 
to how that phrase in English should be better translated into Chinese, since at least 
three Chinese words—shili, quanli, and liliang—carry meanings similar to “power.” 
Different translations indicate the nuanced and different interpretations of the term 
“soft power” within the country. 
How the Chinese View Their Soft Power 
More evidently indicative of these varying interpretations of soft power are the 
numerous Chinese publications on China’s own soft power, which voice divergent 
views. Some stress that only a rapid growth of hard power can provide China with the 
premises on which to enhance its soft power, implying that priority should be given 
to the increase in hard power rather than soft power. For example, Yan Xuetong, 
a renowned international relations scholar, contends that the wielding of political 
power, reﬂected by showing China’s determination in strengthening military power 
and deterring Taiwanese independence by force, is more important than spreading out 
cultural inﬂuences. Most other observers, however, do pay more attention to culture 
as a necessary ingredient, even a core element, of soft power. Many try to portray 
China’s soft power today by analyzing both its strengths and weaknesses. On the posi-
tive side, to many people in the world, China’s performance is strikingly admirable 
in sustaining a high rate of economic growth over the last three decades, which has 
helped Chinese people get rid of poverty. The economic and social progress would 
not have been possible if China’s political institutions were not strong and resilient. 
Whether its performance has provided a development model (the so-called Beijing 
Consensus) for other countries to follow is subject to debate, but the accumulated 
economic power and social capital have certainly boosted China’s conﬁdence, pride, 
and capacity to project its political power and cultural inﬂuences abroad. 
Chinese analysts tend to attribute China’s recent achievements to its cultural merits 
and traits. They also tend to believe that along with China’s increased hard power 
Chinese culture should be more attractive to other peoples. Some also point to ethnic 
Chinese outside of China as a great asset that can contribute to its soft power. In 
addition, China’s foreign policy has been highly successful, with (arguably in the 
eyes of others) its high moral principles and increasingly adroit diplomatic skills.

104
Hard Decisions on Soft Power: Opportunities and Difﬁculties …
Meanwhile, a number of Chinese publications admit the limits and constraints 
to China’s soft power, especially when they compare it with US inﬂuence in the 
world. Some of them subtly point to the lack of transparency in government work 
and rampant ofﬁcial corruption that damages China’s image. Some others refer to the 
“brain drain” China is still suffering from, which reﬂects insufﬁciencies in China’s 
educational (and possibly political) system. Still others suggest that the Chinese 
government should do better in its public relations work internationally. Thus, while 
no consensus Chinese view of the country’s soft power has emerged, debate has been 
ﬁerce and impassioned. 
Interaction Between China and the United States 
Having considered the domestic perception of Chinese soft power, it is imperative to 
look at how Chinese soft power interacts with the rest of the world and particularly 
the world’s most powerful nation, the United States. Just as the national interests of 
China and the United States are partly congruent and partly conﬂicting, their soft 
powers are reinforcing each other in some issue areas and contradicting each other 
in others. This is not something unique to soft power. In general, power relationships 
can be zero or positive sum depending on the objectives of the actors. For example, 
if two countries both desire stability, a balance of military power in which neither 
side fears attack by the other can be a positive sum relationship. 
Undeniably, the polities of these two countries represent different value systems 
and ideologies. In the eyes of China’s political elites, the United States is attempting 
to change the whole world in its own image, and China as a socialist country led by 
the Communist Party is without any doubt a main obstacle to achieving US strategic 
goals. Chinese ofﬁcials are always sensitive and alert to US schemes involved in what 
Condoleezza Rice called “transformational diplomacy” that are aimed at spreading 
out US inﬂuences deeply onto other countries’ domestic lives. The Chinese also 
watched closely and worryingly the “color revolutions” in Central Asia and else-
where, which were seen as staged or encouraged by Americans to undermine existing 
governments. To this extent, the expansion and wielding of US soft power as part 
of a “smart” combination of culture, political values, and foreign policy will not be 
welcomed by China. 
To the US general public and elites alike, China under the Communist Party 
leadership is a political symbol that they ﬁnd difﬁcult to accept and understand. 
In general, Americans are favorably impressed with China’s great achievements in 
the last three decades. However, if they were asked if these achievements have been 
made “because of” or “despite” the Communist Party leadership in China, they would 
probably be perplexed. They harbor mixed feelings in seeing China’s soft power rise 
in world affairs. Most of these views assume a zero-sum perspective and cast a more 
negative rather than positive light on China’s soft power growth. 
In their respective foreign policy pronouncements, Americans and Chinese often 
have opposite views and goals. While Americans want to maintain their leading

Interaction Between China and the United States
105
position in global affairs, Chinese are opposing “hegemonism,” a code word for 
US ambitions to dominate the world, and are promoting “multipolarity,” signifying 
an apparent decline in US power. Nonetheless, the seemingly opposite goals and 
ambivalent feelings described above belie some very fundamental realities, according 
to which the soft power interaction between the United States and China is far from 
a zero-sum game. 
First, there is little evidence that the increase in China soft power is aimed at 
counterweighing US soft power, or that the “color revolutions,” regardless of their 
connection to US strategic objectives, are intended to work against China’s inﬂuence 
in those countries where they occurred. The tainted US image in Europe and the 
Islamic world has little to do with Chinese diplomacy there, and US unpopularity 
would not directly result in any boosting of China’s cultural and political inﬂuences. 
Just as Yao Ming is not in the United States at the expense of Michael Jordan, 
Hollywood movies and TV series like Desperate Housewives would do no harm 
to the quality of Chinese movies. Although some people in China may blame the 
popularity of American cultural products for reducing the attractiveness of Chinese 
counterparts, a reverse argument can be made that such competitions are needed and 
healthy. Similar cases can be found in China-US educational exchanges, in which 
each side beneﬁts from better students and teachers of the other side. 
Second, the perception that the Chinese model of combining market economy with 
one-party rule (Beijing Consensus) will challenge the Western model (involving open 
markets, democracy, and rule of law), and values are dubious. More research should 
be done to ﬁnd out how many, and to what extent, other developing countries are 
actually able to learn a great deal from the Chinese model, even if some of them do 
admire the Chinese performance. For what we know, Americans would be pleased 
should North Korea or Myanmar now begin to move toward the Chinese market 
economy. 
Third, China is using its soft power in diplomacy in ways that may help the 
United States protect its interests in certain countries and regions. To be sure, China’s 
actions are taken ﬁrst of all to serve its own interests, but its quiet efforts to persuade 
the North Koreans to terminate their nuclear weapon programs and to embark on 
economic reform do facilitate US policy objectives on the Korean Peninsula. Like-
wise, Beijing’s quiet diplomacy to persuade Myanmar’s government to modify its 
behavior at home may pave the way for stabilizing the situation in that country. What 
is more, China has successfully convinced Khartoum to accept a UN presence in 
Sudan, which was originally rejected under Western pressures. 
Fourth, Chinese guardedness against US soft power is essentially defensive, espe-
cially in China’s domestic affairs. Despite their suspicions of US intentions and their 
doubts about the relevance of American experiences to China’s own path to moder-
nity, Chinese political elites share the basic values of democracy, human rights, rule 
of law, as well as market economy. As a US analyst observed a few weeks after the 
9/11 tragedy, “we used to emphasize that China and the United States hold different 
values. But, if we compare the gap between American values and the values held 
by the Taliban and Al Qaeda, differences between China and the United States are 
negligible!”.

106
Hard Decisions on Soft Power: Opportunities and Difﬁculties …
Finally, in reality, Chinese are borrowing many skills and practices that undergird 
US soft power. A great number of Chinese government ofﬁcials, military ofﬁcers, 
judges, lawyers, among other professionals, have been trained in the United States, 
and they have made contributions to US knowledge as well. In the ﬁeld of foreign 
policy, many Chinese think tanks have emerged in the last decade or so, and the 
examples they refer to are their counterparts in the United States, rather than those 
in Japan, Russia, or Germany. The soft power interaction between the United States 
and China thus need not be seen as a competition, but rather as a more complex 
combination of competitive and cooperative forces. 
Conclusions 
It is not surprising to see Chinese leaders and academics referring explicitly to China’s 
soft power and adopting policies to promote it. In a sense, this reﬂects a sophisticated 
realist strategy for a country with rising hard power. To the extent it is able to combine 
its hard power resources with soft power resources, it is less likely to frighten its 
neighbors and others and thus less likely to stimulate balancing coalitions directed 
against it. Successful strategies often involve a combination of hard and soft power 
that are called “smart power.” For example, in nineteenth century, Europe, after 
defeating Denmark, Austria, and France with Prussian hard military power, Bismarck 
developed a soft power strategy of making Berlin the most attractive diplomatic 
capital of Europe. During the Cold War, the United States used both hard and soft 
power against the Soviet Union. Thus, it is not surprising to see China following 
a smart power strategy. Whether this will be a problem for other countries or not 
will depend on the way the power is used. If China seeks to manipulate the politics 
of Asia and exclude the United States, its strategy could be counterproductive, but 
to the extent that China adopts the attitude of a rising “responsible stakeholder” 
in international affairs, its combination of hard and soft power can make a positive 
contribution. In return, much will depend upon the willingness of the United States to 
include China as an important player in the web of formal and informal international 
institutional arrangements. 
China is far from the United States’ or Europe’s equal in soft power at this point, 
but it would be foolish to ignore the important gains it is making. Fortunately, these 
gains can be good for China and also good for the rest of the world. Soft power is 
not a zero-sum game in which one country’s gain is necessarily another country’s 
loss. If China and the United States, for example, both become more attractive in 
each other’s eyes, the prospects of damaging conﬂicts will be reduced. If the rise of 
China’s soft power reduces the chance of conﬂict, it can be part of a positive sum 
relationship.

Xi Jinping’s Marco Polo Strategy 
Originally published 
by Project Syndicate 
on June 12, 2017. 
The Belt and Road Initiative has great potential and is being strongly pushed by 
China as an alternative for both developing and developed countries. With over 65 
countries containing some 4.5 billion people, will over a trillion dollars in infras-
tructure investment and other areas be enough to succeed as part of Xi Jinping’s 
grand strategy? 
Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over a heavily orchestrated “Belt 
and Road” forum in Beijing. The two-day event attracted 29 heads of state, including 
Russia’s Vladimir Putin, and 1200 delegates from over 100 countries. Xi called 
China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) the “project of the century.” The 65 countries 
involved comprise two-thirds of the world’s land mass and include some four and a 
half billion people. 
Originally announced in 2013, Xi’s plan to integrate Eurasia through a trillion 
dollars of investment in infrastructure stretching from China to Europe, with exten-
sions to Southeast Asia and East Africa, has been termed China’s new Marshall Plan 
as well as its bid for a grand strategy. Some observers also saw the forum as part 
of Xi’s effort to ﬁll the vacuum left by Donald Trump’s abandonment of Barack 
Obama’s Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership trade agreement. 
China’s ambitious initiative would provide badly needed highways, rail lines, 
pipelines, ports, and power plants in poor countries. It would also encourage Chinese 
ﬁrms to increase their investments in European ports and railways. The “belt” would 
include a massive network of highways and rail links through Central Asia, and the 
“road” refers to a series of maritime routes and ports between Asia and Europe.

Xi Jinping’s Marco Polo Strategy
Marco Polo would be proud. And if China chooses to use its surplus ﬁnancial 
reserves to create infrastructure that helps poor countries and enhances international 
trade, it will be providing what can be seen as a global public good. 
Of course, China’s motives are not purely benevolent. Reallocation of China’s 
large foreign-exchange assets away from low-yield US Treasury bonds to higher-
yield infrastructure investment makes sense and creates alternative markets for 
Chinese goods. With Chinese steel and cement ﬁrms suffering from overca-
pacity, Chinese construction ﬁrms will proﬁt from the new investment. And as 
Chinese manufacturing moves to less accessible provinces, improved infrastructure 
connections to international markets ﬁt China’s development needs. 
But is the BRI more public relations smoke than investment ﬁre? According to the 
Financial Times, investment in Xi’s initiative declined last year, raising doubts about 
whether commercial enterprises are as committed as the government. Five trains full 
of cargo leave Chongqing for Germany every week, but only one full train returns. 
Shipping goods overland from China to Europe is still twice as expensive as 
trade by sea. As the FT puts it, the BRI is “unfortunately less of a practical plan 
for investment than a broad political vision.” Moreover, there is a danger of debt 
and unpaid loans from projects that turn out to be economic “white elephants,” and 
security conﬂicts could be devil projects that cross so many sovereign borders. India 
is not happy to see a greater Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean, and Russia, 
Turkey, and Iran have their own agendas in Central Asia. 
Xi’s vision is impressive, but will it succeed as a grand strategy? China is betting 
on an old geopolitical proposition. A century ago, the British geopolitical theorist 
Halford Mackinder argued that whoever controlled the world island of Eurasia would 
control the world. American strategy, in contrast, has long favored the geopolitical 
insights of the nineteenth-century admiral Alfred Mahan, who emphasized sea power 
and the rimlands. 
At World War II’s end, George F. Kennan adapted Mahan’s approach to develop 
his Cold War strategy of containment of the Soviet Union, arguing that if the US 
allied with the islands of Britain and Japan and the peninsula of Western Europe at 
the two ends of Eurasia, the US could create a balance of global power that would 
be favorable to American interests. The Pentagon and State Department are still 
organized along these lines, with scant attention paid to Central Asia. 
Much has changed in the age of the Internet, but geography still matters, despite 
the alleged death of distance. In the nineteenth century, much of geopolitical rivalry 
revolved around the “Eastern Question” of who would control the area ruled by 
the crumbling Ottoman Empire. Infrastructure projects like the Berlin to Baghdad 
railway roused tensions among the great powers. Will those geopolitical struggles 
now be replaced by the “Eurasian Question”? 
With the BRI, China is betting on Mackinder and Marco Polo. But the overland 
route through Central Asia will revive the nineteenth-century “Great Game” for 
inﬂuence that embroiled Britain and Russia, as well as former empires like Turkey 
and Iran. At the same time, the maritime “road” through the Indian Ocean accentuates 
China’s already fraught rivalry with India, with tensions building over Chinese ports 
and roads through Pakistan.

Xi Jinping’s Marco Polo Strategy
111
The US is betting more on Mahan and Kennan. Asia has its own balance of power, 
and neither India nor Japan nor Vietnam want Chinese domination. They see America 
as part of the solution. American policy is not containment of China—witness the 
massive ﬂows of trade and students between the countries. But as China, enthralled 
by a vision of national greatness, engages in territorial disputes with its maritime 
neighbors, it tends to drive them into America’s arms. 
Indeed, China’s real problem is “self-containment.” Even in the age of the Internet 
and social media, nationalism remains a most powerful force. 
Overall, the United States should welcome China’s BRI. As Robert Zoellick, 
a former US Trade Representative and World Bank president, has argued, if a 
rising China contributes to the provision of global public goods, the US should 
encourage the Chinese to become a “responsible stakeholder.” Moreover, there can 
be opportunities for American companies to beneﬁt from BRI investments. 
The US and China have much to gain from cooperation on a variety of transnational 
issues like monetary stability, climate change, cyber rules of the road, and anti-
terrorism. And while the BRI will provide China with geopolitical gains as well as 
costs, it is unlikely to be as much of a game changer in grand strategy, as some 
analysts believe. A more difﬁcult question is whether the US can live up to its part.

Does China Have Feet of Clay? 
Originally published 
by Project Syndicate 
on April 4, 2019. 
China’s investment in soft power demonstrates its commitment to working to ensure 
to a peaceful rise. However, there are a number of elements in China’s soft power 
drive that have made it turn “sharp” in the eyes of some nations of the world. Sharp 
power is a type of hard power, especially in the form of verbal threats or coercion. 
The line between soft and sharp power is one that China and the West have clearly 
drawn differently, and this will continue to be a source of contention. 
China has invested billions of dollars to increase its soft power, but it has recently 
suffered a backlash in democratic countries. A new report by the National Endowment 
for Democracy argues that we need to rethink soft power, because “the conceptual 
vocabulary that has been used since the Cold War’s end no longer seems adequate 
to the contemporary situation.” 
The report describes the new authoritarian inﬂuences being felt around the world 
as “sharp power.” A recent cover article in The Economist deﬁnes “sharp power” by 
its reliance on “subversion, bullying and pressure, which combine to promote self-
censorship.” Whereas soft power harnesses the allure of culture and values to augment 
a country’s strength, sharp power helps authoritarian regimes compel behavior at 
home and manipulate opinion abroad. 
The term “soft power”—the ability to affect others by attraction and persuasion 
rather than the hard power of coercion and payment—is sometimes used to describe 
any exercise of power that does not involve the use of force. But that is a mistake. 
Power sometimes depends on whose army or economy wins, but it can also depend 
on whose story wins.

Does China Have Feet of Clay?
A strong narrative is a source of power. China’s economic success has generated 
both hard and soft power, but within limits. A Chinese economic aid package under 
the Belt and Road Initiative may appear benign and attractive, but not if the terms 
turn sour, as was recently the case in a Sri Lankan port project. 
Likewise, other exercises of economic hard power undercut the soft power of 
China’s narrative. For example, China punished Norway for awarding a Nobel Peace 
Prize to Liu Xiaobo. It also threatened to restrict access to the Chinese market for an 
Australian publisher of a book critical of China. 
If we use the term sharp power as shorthand for information warfare, the contrast 
with soft power becomes plain. Sharp power is a type of hard power. It manip-
ulates information, which is intangible, but intangibility is not the distinguishing 
characteristic of soft power. Verbal threats, for example, are both intangible and 
coercive. 
When I introduced the concept of soft power in 1990, I wrote that it is characterized 
by voluntarism and indirection, while hard power rests on threats and inducements. 
If someone aims a gun at you, demands your money, and takes your wallet, what 
you think and want is irrelevant. That is hard power. If he persuades you to give him 
your money, he has changed what you think and want. That is soft power. 
Truth and openness create a dividing line between soft and sharp power in public 
diplomacy. When China’s ofﬁcial news agency, Xinhua, broadcasts openly in other 
countries, it is employing soft power techniques, and we should accept that. When 
China Radio International covertly backs 33 radio stations in 14 countries, the 
boundary of sharp power has been crossed, and we should expose the breach of 
voluntarism. 
Of course, advertising and persuasion always involve some degree of framing, 
which limits voluntarism, as do structural features of the social environment. But 
extreme deception in framing can be viewed as coercive; though not violent, it 
prevents meaningful choice. 
Techniques of public diplomacy that are widely viewed as propaganda cannot 
produce soft power. In an age of information, the scarcest resources are attention and 
credibility. That is why exchange programs that develop two-way communication 
and personal relations among students and young leaders are often far more effective 
generators of soft power than, say, ofﬁcial broadcasting. 
The United States has long had programs enabling visits by young foreign leaders, 
and now, China is successfully following suit. That is a smart exercise of soft 
power. But when visas are manipulated or access is limited to restrain criticism 
and encourage self-censorship, even such exchange programs can shade into sharp 
power. 
As democracies respond to China’s sharp power and information warfare, they 
have to be careful not to overreact. Much of the soft power democracies wield comes 
from civil society, which means that openness is a crucial asset. China could generate 
more soft power if it would relax some of its tight party control over civil society. 
Similarly, manipulation of media and reliance on covert channels of communication 
often reduces soft power. Democracies should avoid the temptation to imitate these 
authoritarian sharp power tools.

Does China Have Feet of Clay?
115
Moreover, shutting down legitimate Chinese soft power tools can be counterpro-
ductive. Soft power is often used for competitive, zero-sum purposes, but it can also 
have positive sum aspects. 
For example, if both China and the US wish to avoid conﬂict, exchange programs 
that increase American attraction to China, and vice versa, would beneﬁt both coun-
tries. And on transnational issues such as climate change, where both countries can 
beneﬁt from cooperation, soft power can help build the trust and create the networks 
that make such cooperation possible. 
While it would be a mistake to prohibit Chinese soft power efforts just because 
they sometimes shade into sharp power, it is also important to monitor the dividing 
line carefully. For example, the Hanban, the government agency that manages the 
500 Confucius Institutes and 1,000 Confucius classrooms that China supports in 
universities and schools around the world to teach Chinese language and culture, 
must resist the temptation to set restrictions that limit academic freedom. Crossing 
that line has led to the disbanding of some Confucius Institutes. 
As such cases show, the best defense against China’s use of soft power programs 
as sharp power tools is open exposure of such efforts. And this is where democracies 
have an advantage.

Perspectives for a China Strategy 
Originally published in 
the Jun 11, 2020 edition 
of Prism. 
Beyond the COVID-19 crisis, we face the larger question of how to frame a strategy 
toward the inexorably rising China. The perennial theme of Western decline is not 
new, though the role of China is. In a longer historical perspective, this century is 
witnessing not the rise, but the recovery of Asia. Ultimately, the U.S.-China relation-
ship is a cooperative rivalry where a successful strategy of “smart competition” is 
necessary. 
When the Munich Security Conference met in February 2020, China was the most 
frequently mentioned country, while there was an exaggerated mood of Western 
decline. Yet as the recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown, China has both strengths 
and weaknesses. Its initial censorship, suppression of feedback, and curtailment 
of international information allowed the pandemic to develop and fester. Draco-
nian quarantine of Wuhan curtailed its spread somewhat; followed by a government 
propaganda campaign to attract others to the theme that China’s behavior had been 
benign. When the pandemic eventually subsides, however, China will be faced with 
the political and economic costs resulting from the exposure of both a failed public 
health system and an overly rigid party control system. 
Beyond the COVID-19 crisis, we face the larger question of how to frame a 
strategy toward the inexorably rising China. The perennial theme of Western decline 
is not new, though the role of China is. Oswald Spengler opined about the decline of 
the West over a century ago. During the Cold War, American pundits and politicians 
went through several cycles of belief in declinism that featured fear of the Soviet

Perspectives for a China Strategy
many proclaimed the West triumphant. In his 1992 book The End of History and 
the Last Man, Francis Fukuyama wrote that humanity had reached “the end-point of 
mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democ-
racy as the ﬁnal form of human government.” A few years later, Samuel Huntington 
issued a gloomier prognosis in The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World 
Order that “the rise of China and the increasing assertiveness of this ‘biggest player 
in the history of man’ will place tremendous stress on international stability in the 
early twenty-ﬁrst century.”1 Today, the prevailing fear is indeed the rise of China. 
Accordingly, the 2017 version of the National Security Strategy of the United States 
focuses on great-power competition with China and to a lesser extent with Russia. 
In a longer historical perspective, this century is witnessing not the rise, but the 
recovery of Asia. Western civilization did not fully ﬂower until 1500, and before 
1800, Asia (including India and Japan as well as China) was home to more than 
half the world’s population and world economy. By 1900, however, while Asia still 
represented more than half the world’s population, its share of the global economy 
had fallen to only 20%. Meanwhile the industrial revolution in Europe and North 
America and their domination of the seas made Europe the center of the global 
balance of power—until it tore itself apart in World War I. As I wrote a decade ago, 
the twenty-ﬁrst century will see the return of Asia, but Asia is much more than just 
China.2 Asia has its own internal balance of power, and many Asian states welcome 
a Western presence to make sure they are not dominated by China.3 
The United States became the world’s largest economy at the end of the nineteenth 
century, but it was not until it tipped the outcome of World War I that it became crucial 
to the global balance of power. Failing to understand that balance, America retreated 
into isolationism, and the 1930s was a disastrous decade. Following World War 
II, Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower avoided 
the mistakes of isolationism and created the institutions of what would become the 
Western liberal order. 
Some contemporary realists believe the rise of China portends a conﬂict that will 
tear the world apart similar to the sundering of Europe in 1914. Graham Allison has 
warned of a “Thucydides Trap” invoking the history of the Peloponnesian War which 
was caused by the rise in power of Athens and the fear it created in Sparta. While 
Allison’s historical cases and numbers have been questioned, his metaphor serves a

useful warning.4 Strategists must pay attention both to the rise of China and the fear 
it creates in the United States. 
Assessing Chinese Power 
It is equally dangerous to over- or underestimate Chinese power. Underestimation 
breeds complacency, while overestimation creates fear—either of which can lead to 
miscalculation. Good strategy requires careful net assessment. Many current, gloomy 
projections rest on exaggerations of China’s strength and Western weakness. Some 
observers warn that the rise of China will spell the end of the American era, but this 
is far from clear.5 Nonetheless, failure to successfully cope with the rise of China 
could have disastrous consequences for America and the rest of the world. 
Contrary to current conventional wisdom, China has not yet replaced the United 
States as the world’s largest economy. Today China’s economy is only about two-
thirds that of the United States, and an even smaller fraction if Europe, Japan, 
Australia, and other Western allies are included. Measured in purchasing power 
parity, the Chinese economy became larger than the American economy in 2014, but 
purchasing power parity is an economist’s device for comparing estimates of welfare, 
not for measuring power. For example, oil and jet engines are imported at current 
exchange rates, not some notional purchasing power adjustment. Gross domestic 
product (GDP) is in any case a very crude measure of power. For the ﬁrst half of 
its “century of humiliation” that started with the opium wars with Britain in 1839, 
China had the world’s largest GDP (and military) but that did not accurately describe 
the balance of power.6 Per capita income gives a better index of the sophistication 
of an economy; American per capita income is several times that of China. 
Many economists expect China to pass the United States someday as the world’s 
largest economy (measured as GDP in dollars), but the estimated date varies from 
2030 to mid-century depending on what one assumes about the rates of Chinese and 
American growth, and whether either country stumbles along the projected ahistorical 
linear paths. Past growth rates are not good predictors. 
By any measure, however, the gravitational pull of China’s economy is increasing. 
China is now the world’s largest manufacturer and the major trading partner of nearly

every country in the world.7 Not only does its growing economy support military 
and aid expenditures, but access to the Chinese market and its ability to set standards 
for that market are a signiﬁcant source of political inﬂuence. 
As we have seen above, Thucydides famously attributed the outbreak of the Pelo-
ponnesian War to two causes: the rise of a new power—Athens and the fear that 
created in an established power—Sparta. Most readers focus on the ﬁrst half of 
Thucydides assessment, but the second is equally important to strategic planning 
and more within our control. 
Most sinologists properly doubt that U.S. foreign policy can prevent the rise of 
China’s economy, but if we use our contextual intelligence well, we can avoid the 
exaggerated fears that could provoke a new cold or worse, a hot war. Even if China 
someday surpasses the United States in total economic size, that is not the only 
measure of geopolitical power. As we saw, the United States became the world’s 
largest economy at the end of the nineteenth century, but did not become a central 
player in the global balance of power until three decades later in the context of World 
War I. Economic might is just part of the equation. 
In terms of military might, China is well behind the United States. U.S. military 
expenditure is several times that of China. While Chinese military capabilities have 
been increasing in recent years and pose new challenges to U.S. and Western forces 
in the region, China is not a global peer. Nor will it be able to exclude the United 
States from the Western Paciﬁc so long as the United States maintains its alliance and 
bases in Japan. Despite its non-nuclear status, Japan anchors the ﬁrst island chain and 
possesses a formidable military which exercises regularly with U.S. forces. Despite 
trade tensions, the U.S.-Japan alliance is stronger today than it was thirty years ago 
at the end of the Cold War. 
Sometimes analysts draw pessimistic conclusions from war games played in the 
limited context of Taiwan. However, with China’s vital energy supply lines vulnerable 
to American naval domination in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, it would be a 
mistake for China’s leaders to assume that a naval conﬂict near Taiwan (or in the 
South China Sea) would stay limited to that region. 
China has also invested heavily in soft power, the ability to get preferred outcomes 
through attraction rather than coercion or payment. Cultural exchanges and Belt and 
Road Initiative (BRI) projects can enhance China’s attractiveness, but the BRI is more 
like a successful marketing propaganda than a true Marshall Plan for the world. BRI 
projects range from those that promote economic infrastructure to those designed 
primarily to contain India.8 Chinese soft power faces two major limits. Ongoing 
territorial conﬂicts with neighbors such as Japan, India, Vietnam, and the Philip-
pines make it difﬁcult for China to appear attractive while contesting rival claims. 
And domestic insistence on tight Communist Party control deprives China of the 
beneﬁts of civil society that European countries or the United States enjoy. Author-
itarian responses to artists like Ai Wei Wei and dissidents like Liu Xiaobo or the

cultural repression in Xinjiang limit China’s attractiveness in democratic societies. 
In measuring soft power, opinion polls as well as a recent index published by Portland, 
a London consultancy, ranked China in twenty-sixth place while the United States 
ranked near the top.9 Ironically, Mao Tse Tung’s brutal but ideological Communism 
in the 1960s had a far greater transnational soft power appeal. 
China’s huge economic scale matters; it is an inescapable fact. The United States 
was once the world’s largest trading nation and largest bilateral lender. Today nearly 
one hundred countries count China as their largest trading partner, compared to ﬁfty-
seven that have such a relationship with the United States. China plans to lend more 
than a trillion dollars for infrastructure projects with its Belt and Road Initiative 
over the next decade, while the United States has cut back aid. China’s economic 
success story enhances its soft power, and government control of access to its large 
market provides hard power leverage. Moreover, China’s authoritarian politics and 
mercantilist practices make its economic power readily usable by the government. 
China will gain economic power from the sheer size of its market as well as its 
overseas investments and development assistance. 
Of the seven giant global companies in the age of artiﬁcial intelligence (Google, 
Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent), three or nearly half 
are Chinese. And Chinese companies dare not defy the Chinese Communist Party, 
rendering them tools in China’s geostrategic competition toolkit. With the world’s 
largest population, its largest Internet audience, and while data resources are 
becoming the “new oil” of world politics, China is poised to become the Saudi 
Arabia of big data.10 Overall, Chinese power relative to the United States is likely to 
increase. 
American Assets 
In assessing the balance of power, it is important to remember that the United States 
has some long-term power advantages that will persist regardless of current Chinese 
actions. One is geography. The United States is surrounded by two oceans and benign 
neighbors that are likely to remain friendly. China has borders with fourteen coun-
tries and has territorial disputes with India, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines 
among others. Energy independence is another American advantage.11 A decade 
ago, the United States seemed hopelessly dependent on imported energy. The recent 
shale revolution has transformed it from energy importer to energy exporter, and the 
International Energy Agency projects that North America may be self-sufﬁcient in 
the coming decade. Meanwhile, China is becoming ever-more dependent on energy

imports, and much of the oil it imports is transported through the Indian Ocean and 
the South China Sea, where the United States and others maintain a signiﬁcant naval 
presence. Eliminating this vulnerability will take decades. 
The United States enjoys ﬁnancial power derived from its large transnational 
ﬁnancial institutions as well as the role of the U.S. dollar. Of the foreign reserves 
held by the world’s governments, just 1.1% are in yuan, compared with 64% for 
the dollar. While China aspires to a larger role, a credible reserve currency depends 
on currency convertibility, deep capital markets, honest government, and the rule 
of law—all lacking in China and not quickly developed. While China could divest 
its large holdings of dollars, such action would risk damaging its own economy as 
much as the United States. China dumping dollars might bring the United States to 
its knees, but it would have a similar effect on China itself. 
Power in interdependent relations depends upon asymmetric vulnerability, and 
there are too many symmetries in U.S.-China interdependence at this point, though 
that might change if there is a much more radical decoupling. Although the dollar 
cannot remain preeminent forever, and American overuse of ﬁnancial sanctions 
creates incentives for other countries to look for other ﬁnancial instruments, the 
yuan is unlikely to displace the dollar in the near term. 
The United States also has demographic strengths. It is the only major developed 
country that is currently projected to hold its place (third) in the demographic ranking 
of countries. While the rate of American population growth has slowed in recent 
years, it is not shrinking as are the populations of Russia, Europe, and Japan. Seven 
of the world’s ﬁfteen largest economies will face a shrinking workforce over the 
next decade and a half, including China whose population will decline by 9%, while 
the U.S. workforce is likely to increase by 5%. China will soon lose its ﬁrst-place 
population rank to India, and its working age population already peaked in 2015. 
Chinese worry about “growing old before growing rich.”12 
America has been at the forefront in the development of key technologies (bio, 
nano, information) that are central to this century’s economic growth, and Amer-
ican research universities dominate higher education. In 2019 ranking by Shanghai 
Jiaotong University, ﬁfteen of the top twenty global universities were in the United 
States; none were in China. 
To challenge U.S. dominance in this domain, China is investing heavily in research 
and development; it competes well in some ﬁelds now and has set a goal to be the 
global leader in artiﬁcial intelligence by 2030. Some experts believe that with its 
enormous data resources, lack of privacy restraints on how data is used, and the fact 
that advances in machine learning will require trained engineers more than cutting-
edge scientists, China could achieve its artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) goal. Given the 
importance of machine learning as a general purpose technology that affects many 
domains, China’s gains in AI are of particular signiﬁcance.13

Devising a Strategy

Chinese technological progress is no longer based solely on imitation. Although 
clumsily handled, the Donald Trump administration was correct to punish China 
for cybertheft of intellectual property, coerced intellectual property transfer, and 
unfair trade practices such as subsidized credit to state-owned enterprises. Reci-
procity needs to be enforced. If China can ban Google and Facebook from its market 
for security reasons, the United States can surely take similar steps. Huawei and ZTE, 
for example, should not be allowed to participate in building American 5G networks. 
However, a successful American response to China’s technological challenge will 
depend upon improvements at home more than upon external sanctions. 
American complacency is always a danger, but so also is lack of conﬁdence and 
exaggerated fears that lead to overreaction. In the view of John Deutch, a former 
Provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, if the United States attains 
its potential improvements in innovation potential, “China’s great leap forward will 
likely at best be a few steps toward closing the innovation leadership gap that the 
United States currently enjoys.” But notice the “if.”14 
Devising a Strategy 
The United States holds high cards in its poker hand, but hysteria could cause it to fail 
to play its cards skillfully. When the Bill Clinton administration published its East 
Asian Strategy Report in 1995 to cope with the rise of China, we decided to reafﬁrm 
the U.S.-Japan alliance well before seeking to engage China in the World Trade 
Organization. Discarding our high cards of alliances and international institutions 
today would be a serious mistake. If the United States maintains its alliance with 
Japan, China cannot push it beyond the ﬁrst island chain because Japan is a major 
part of that chain. Another possible mistake would be to try to cut off all immigration. 
When asked why he did not think China would pass the United States in total power 
any time soon, the late Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew cited the ability 
of America to draw upon the talents of the whole world and recombine them in 
diversity and creativity that was not possible for China’s ethnic Han nationalism.15 
If the United States was to discard its high cards of external alliances and domestic 
openness today, Lee could be proven wrong. 
As China’s power grows, some observers worry we are destined for war, but 
few consider an opposite disruptive danger. Rather than acting like a revolutionary 
power in the international order, China might decide to be a free rider like the United 
States was in the 1930s. China may act too weakly rather than too strongly and 
refuse to contribute to an international order that it did not create. China knows it

Perspectives for a China Strategy
has beneﬁted substantially from the post-1945, Western international order.16 In the 
United Nations Security Council, China is one of the ﬁve countries with a veto. China 
is now the second largest funder of UN peacekeeping forces and has participated in 
UN programs related to Ebola virus containment and climate change. China has 
also beneﬁted greatly from economic institutions like the WTO and the International 
Monetary Fund and is a party to the 2015 Climate Accords. 
On the other hand, China has started its own Asian Infrastructure Investment 
Bank (AIIB) and the BRI program of international infrastructure projects that some 
see as an economic offensive. China has not practiced full reciprocity as a market 
economy, and its rejection of a 2016 Hague Tribunal ruling regarding the South China 
Sea raised questions about whether China would treat its legal obligations a la carte 
(as the United States has sometimes done). American and allied navies’ freedom of 
navigation operations in the South China Sea remain essential to maintain this point. 
Thus far, China has not tried to overthrow but rather to increase its inﬂuence 
within the world order from which it beneﬁts, but this could change as Chinese 
power grows.17 Appetites sometimes grow with eating, and Xi Jinping’s rhetoric 
about China as a great state suggests this could occur. The Trump administration has 
called China a revisionist power, but so far its revisionism has been quite moderate, 
unlike extreme revisionist powers such as Hitler’s Germany. China is not interested 
in kicking over the card table, but in tilting the table so it can claim a larger share of 
the winnings. China’s growing economic power will create problems for the United 
States and the international order, and this friction will likely continue. The United 
States will have to manage alliances, networks, and institutions deftly to shape the 
environment in which China uses its growing power. 
As Chinese power increases, the American-led liberal international order will 
have to change. China has little interest in liberalism or American domination, but 
it does have a continuing interest in an “open and rules-based” world order. In the 
aftermath of the trade wars and COVID-19 pandemic, there is bound to be a degree 
of disengagement between the two countries.18 The American approach to an open 
international economy will need to be adjusted for greater oversight of Chinese trade 
and investments that threaten its technological and national security objectives, but 
there is still a basis for fruitful interdependence and rules of the road to govern that 
independence. The West can also express its disagreement over values and human 
rights while cooperating on rules of the road related to matters where there are joint 
interests. Our values are an important source of our soft power. 
In late 2017, President Trump announced a new National Security Strategy 
focused primarily on great-power competition with China and Russia. It provided

the beneﬁt of a wake-up call, but as a strategy to protect American security, it is inad-
equate. Under the inﬂuence of the information revolution and globalization, world 
politics is changing. Even if the United States prevails over China as a great power, 
we cannot protect our security acting alone. COVID-19 is only the latest example of 
national security challenges that cannot be met unilaterally. Global ﬁnancial stability 
is another; it is vital to the prosperity of Americans, but we need the cooperation of 
others to safeguard it. And regardless of potential setbacks to economic globalization 
caused by trade wars, environmental globalization will increase. 
Pandemics, climate change, and economic instability threaten all Americans, but 
we cannot manage these problems alone. In a world where borders are becoming more 
porous to everything from drugs to infectious diseases to cyberterrorism, we must 
use our soft power of attraction to develop and cultivate networks and institutions 
capable of addressing these untraditional challenges. 
A successful national security strategy for the United States must begin with the 
recognition that our size and superpower status mean we have to lead the cooperation 
effort. A classic problem with public goods (like clean air, which all can share and 
from which none can be excluded) is that if the largest consumer does not take 
the lead, others will free-ride, and the public goods will not be produced. President 
Trump’s National Security Strategy says little about these increasingly important 
transnational threats to national security. As the technology expert Richard Danzig 
summarizes the problem, “Twenty-ﬁrst century technologies are global not just in 
their distribution, but also in their consequences. Pathogens, AI systems, computer 
viruses, and radiation that others may accidentally release could become as much our 
problem as theirs. Agreed reporting systems, shared controls, common contingency 
plans, norms, and treaties must be pursued as a means of moderating our numerous 
mutual risks.”19 Neither tariffs nor border walls can solve these problems. Even with 
American leadership, success will require the cooperation of others. The United 
States will have to work more closely with other countries and institutions rather 
than in the dismissive manner of the Trump administration. 
On transnational issues like COVID-19, climate change, and global economic 
stability, power becomes a positive-sum game. It is not sufﬁcient to think in terms 
of American power over others. We must also think of power in terms of the ability 
to accomplish joint goals which involves power with others. On many transnational 
issues, empowering others can help us to accomplish our own goals. The United 
States beneﬁts if China improves its energy efﬁciency and emits less carbon dioxide 
or improves its public health systems. In the world of the twenty-ﬁrst century, insti-
tutional networks and connectedness are an important source of national power. In 
a world of growing complexity, the most connected states are the most powerful. 
Washington has some sixty treaty allies while China has few, but we are squandering 
that strategic resource. 
In the past, the openness of the United States enhanced its capacity to build 
networks, maintain institutions, and sustain alliances. But will that openness and

Policy from FDR to Trump (New York: Oxford University Press, 2020).

Perspectives for a China Strategy
willingness to engage with the rest of the world prove sustainable in the populist 
mood currently dominating American domestic politics, or will we see a twenty-ﬁrst 
century analog to our isolationism of the 1930s? Even if the United States continues to 
possess greater military, economic, and soft power resources than any other country, 
we may not choose to convert those resources into effective power behavior on the 
global scene. Between the two world wars, we did not and the result was disastrous. 
If the key to America’s future security and prosperity is learning the importance of 
“power with” as well as “power over,” our current strategy is not up to the task. Every 
country puts its interests ﬁrst, but the important question is how broadly or narrowly 
those interests are deﬁned. Recent events have shown an inclination toward short-
term, zero-sum transactional interpretations with little attention to institutions or 
allies. The United States appears to be stepping back from the long-term, enlightened 
self-interest that marked the security paradigm designed by Roosevelt, Truman, and 
Eisenhower after 1945, and successfully guided us through the Cold War. The new 
threat to our security is not just from transnational forces like COVID-19 and climate 
change but from our domestic failure to adjust own attitudes to this new world. 
Conclusion: Cooperative Rivalry 
Despite Russia and China’s current alliance of convenience against the United States, 
a real alliance of authoritarian countries similar to the Axis of the 1930s or the 
Sino-Soviet alliance of the 1950s is unlikely given the underlying mistrust between 
Russia and China and the difﬁculty of coordinating competing nationalist ideolo-
gies.20 Today’s alliance of authoritarians lacks the soft power appeal of the 1950s, 
though steps will need to be taken to counter their covert “sharp power” threat to 
democratic values. China makes major soft power efforts to promote its authori-
tarian social model through economic inducements as well as manipulation of social 
media.21 However, while Maoism used to bring protesters onto the world’s streets, it 
is unlikely that many protesters will march under the banner of “Xi Jinping Thought 
about Socialism with Chinese Characteristics.” 
Since the Nixon era, China and the United States have cooperated despite ideolog-
ical differences. Rapid Asian economic growth has encouraged a horizontal power 
shift to the region, but Asia has its own internal balance of power. Chinese power is 
balanced by Japan, India, and Australia among others. None want to be dominated 
by China. The United States will remain crucial to that Asian balance of power. 
If the United States maintains those alliances, the prospects are slight that in the 
traditional interstate competition China can drive the United States from the Western

Paciﬁc, much less dominate the world. The United States holds the high cards in the 
traditional great-power competition. The question is whether it will play them well. 
The more difﬁcult question for an effective national security strategy will be 
whether the United States and China can develop attitudes that allow them to coop-
erate in producing global public goods while competing in the traditional areas of 
great-power competition. Exaggerated fears and worst-case analyses may make such 
a balanced policy impossible. The U.S.-China relationship is a cooperative rivalry 
where a successful strategy of “smart competition,” as advocated by Orville Schell 
and Susan Shirk, will require equal attention to both aspects of that description.22 
But, such a future will require good contextual intelligence, careful management on 
both sides, and no major miscalculations. That will be a hard test of the skills of our 
leaders.

US-China Relations 
and the Role of Soft Power 
In today’s world, relations between the United States and China are the deciding 
factor in many global issues. How points ranging from fundamental issues like human 
rights and democracy, to regional issues like Hong Kong, Taiwan to Xinjiang, and 
even trade issues connected to companies like Huawei, will be resolved will also 
depend largely on how the different interpretation of soft power in the United States 
and China plays out. However, one thing is certain, that these two countries must 
ﬁnd a way to co-exist and engage with one another to overcome more global issues 
and have much to gain from cooperation on ﬁghting climate change, pandemics, 
cyberterrorism, and nuclear proliferation. 
The development of soft power need not be a zero-sum game. If Chinese soft power 
increases in the US and vice versa, it will help make conﬂict less likely.

Originally published in the

While more an expression of hard power, the US position on security in the East 
Asia–Paciﬁc Region does color the soft power efforts of the United States, especially 
in China, whose response, in turn, can also impact external impressions of China. 
This contrast of the states of affairs in the region over the course of six years provides 
us with a basis for discussing the role of soft power in US-China relations. 
In February 1995, the US Department of Defense published The United States Secu-
rity Strategy for the East Asia–Paciﬁc Region, sometimes referred to as the “Nye 
Report.” It was broadly welcomed in most capitals in the region, though some critics 
portrayed it as “ossiﬁed” traditionalism.1 Friends have sometimes remarked on the 
irony that someone so closely associated with the concept of transnational interdepen-
dence should have helped produce a report that rested heavily on Realist thinking. 
I reply that in my textbook Understanding International Conﬂicts, I tell students 
that Realism and Liberalism each have something to teach policymakers, depending 
on the circumstances.2 And in 1995, American strategy toward East Asia needed a 
healthy dose of Realism.

The “Nye Report:” Six Years Later
The origins of the report and the associated initiative to strengthen the US-Japan 
alliance have been described in detail by Yoichi Funabashi3 Sufﬁce it to say that 
in the early 1990s, there was a widespread belief both within and without govern-
ment that “geo-economics” had replaced geo-politics. Many people in both Japan 
and the United States regarded the bilateral Cold War alliance as obsolete. Bill 
Clinton had been elected President by relentlessly focusing on the campaign theme, 
“It’s the Economy, Stupid!” The early stages of Clinton’s Asia policy were guided 
by economic governmental agencies; little interest was evinced in security issues. 
Indeed, in some quarters, there was concern that the US-Japan relationship would take 
an adversarial turn. Some writers had gone so far as to describe Japan as America’s 
new enemy.4 Some East Asians began to anticipate a dismantling of American secu-
rity structures in the region. I did not share these views. As I wrote in the ﬁrst 
paragraph of the report, “Security is like oxygen: you do not tend to notice it until 
you begin to lose it. The American security presence has helped to provide this 
‘oxygen’ for East Asian development.” 
East Asia in 1995 
The Asia–Paciﬁc region, unlike Europe, had not developed a rich web of institutions 
during the Cold War, and there was no reconciliation between China and Japan such 
as occurred between France and Germany in the context of the European Union and 
NATO. The receding of the Cold War had exposed the earlier historical conﬂicts in 
the region. A number of countries in the region were adding to their armaments. 
During the Cold War, US, Japanese, and Chinese power balanced against the 
Soviet Union. The collapse of Soviet power left the American position preponderant. 
Some Chinese analysts complained that now there was no regional balance of power, 
and that their military growth could restore a balance.5 Americans warned against 
changing the balance of power. As is evident, each country employed a different but 
longstanding meaning of the term: China’s usage referred to a roughly equal distribu-
tion of power; American usage referred to the existing distribution of power.6 Some 
“balance-of-power” analysts believed that the United States could avoid conﬂict with 
China by withdrawing from the area and letting a local balance develop between 
China, Japan, and a revived Russia. Others believed that the current distribution 
of power had produced the political stability that undergirded the Asian economic 
miracle. American preponderance was acceptable because the United States was a 
distant power with no local territorial claims and could provide the reassurance of

stability that makes local arms races unnecessary. They pointed to the fact that the 
presence of American forces in the region was (and is) welcome in nearly all capitals. 
Even in Beijing, there was ambivalence. To the extent that American forces reduced 
any pressures for Japan to remilitarize, they were welcome; to the extent they reduced 
China’s pressures on Taiwan, they were not. 
As I saw it, the United States had at least ﬁve major alternatives for a grand 
strategy toward the Asia–Paciﬁc region: 
The ﬁrst option was to withdraw and pursue an Atlantic (and/or hemispheric) only 
policy.7 While this would reduce the prospect of conﬂict with China, it was costly and 
unlikely. History, geography, demographics, and economics make the United States 
a Paciﬁc power. Hawaii is in the middle of the Paciﬁc Ocean. In 1995, eight million 
Americans traced their ancestry to the region. Isolation from the most rapidly growing 
area of the world economy would have high costs. America’s military presence was 
generally welcomed and enhanced US inﬂuence in the region. Because of Japanese 
support, it cost the United States less to keep troops in Japan than on the American 
mainland. Moreover, isolation did not enjoy broad support at home.8 
The second option was to create a local balance of power. America would with-
draw from its ﬁve formal alliances in the region (Japan, Korea, Thailand, Philippines, 
Australia) and let a local balance evolve. The United States could then play one 
state against another and isolates itself more easily from some contentious issues.9 
This would likely have led to a remilitarized Japan, and an arms race in the region 
which, ironically, could have made occasional American participation more costly 
and more dangerous as the US tried to balance the new and enhanced forces that 
would be created. In addition, American domestic politics is poorly attuned to such 
nineteenth-century style balance-of-power politics. 
The third option was to create regional security institutions. The United States 
could create a set of regional security institutions to replace its existing structure of 
bilateral alliances, thus providing stability with less direct involvement. ASEAN and 
its Regional Forum already existed, and a Northeast Asian Security Forum had been 
discussed. As a supplement to alliances, such institutions made sense, but they are 
not easily or quickly developed under any circumstances. European institutions took 
decades to develop. A regional institutional strategy alone was unlikely to provide a 
sufﬁcient framework for stability in the region. 
The fourth option was to create a coalition to contain China. Advocates argued 
that containment would compel Beijing to choose political liberalization as the best 
way to safeguard their economic gains and win acceptance in the international 
community. There were at least three ﬂaws in this approach. First, sanctions and
7 This might seem to be one of the implications of Samuel P. Huntington, The Clash of Civilizations 
and the Remaking of World Order (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1996). Huntington writes, 
‘The avoidance of major intercivilizational wars requires core states to refrain from intervening in 
conﬂicts in other civilizations’ (p. 316).

The “Nye Report:” Six Years Later
isolation were less likely than economic growth and engagement to produce liber-
alization. Second, it discounted the changes already under way in China and the 
possibility that China could evolve to deﬁne its interests as a responsible power. 
If the United States treated China as an enemy, it was likely to guarantee itself an 
enemy, particularly given that nationalism has been rapidly replacing Communism 
as the dominant ideology among the Chinese people. While the converse did not 
guarantee that China would become a friend, it kept options open. Third, as a quick 
survey of Asian capitals made clear, the Unites States could not develop a coalition 
to contain China even if it tried. China’s neighbors did not see it as a threat in the way 
the Soviet Union’s neighbors saw it during the Cold War. Only if China became more 
aggressive in the future could such a coalition be formed. And to try containment 
without such a coalition would simply result in providing economic opportunities 
for other countries and thereby increase frustration at home. 
The ﬁfth option was  formal alliance with Japan and normal relations with 
China. The Clinton administration described its policy toward China as “construc-
tive engagement,” but the debate between “containment and engagement” was overly 
simple. Despite the descriptive inadequacy of the slogans, however, the orientation 
or attitude that “engagement” signiﬁed did matter. It meant the United States had 
rejected the inevitability of conﬂict. President Clinton told President Jiang in 1995 
that “a stable, open, and prosperous China-in other words, a strong China-is in our 
interest. We welcome China to the great-power table. But, great powers also have 
great responsibilities.”10 The United States also reafﬁrmed its commitment to a “One 
China” policy, thus ruling out any ﬂirtation with the idea of independence for Taiwan, 
the single most dangerous scenario for potential Sino-American conﬂict. 
Thus, the new security strategy report outlined a four part strategy: (i) maintain 
the forward presence of American troops; (ii) try to develop multilateral institutions 
as a reinforcing mechanism; (iii) put our alliances, particularly with Japan, on a ﬁrm 
basis after the Cold War; and (iv) from that position of strength, encourage China to 
deﬁne its interests in ways that could be compatible with ours. 
The report stated that the United States planned to keep approximately 100 000 
troops in the area. This number was chosen after a review in 1993 of what it would 
take to ﬁght and win two major regional conﬂicts—e.g. in the Persian Gulf and 
Korea—at about the same time. There was nothing sacrosanct about the number, 
but initial reactions in the region to its announcement were positive and helped to 
dispel accumulating concerns about American withdrawal. Reassurance was more 
important than the exact numbers. Although a new edition of the report in 1999 
reafﬁrmed the commitment, I always pointed out in speeches that the number could 
change as conditions changed in the future. The important point was that there should 
be no unilateral reductions without consultation if reassurance was to be maintained. 
In the area of multilateral institutions, the report strongly supported the ASEAN 
Regional Forum. China is said to prefer to deal bilaterally with its smaller neighbors, 
which is a natural reaction for a larger power. On the other hand, it has found that it

cannot afford to ignore ARF, including its discussions of the Spratly Islands. Efforts 
to create a Northeast Asia Security Dialogue or Forum were less successful. China 
did not want to isolate North Korea, but with the two Koreas beginning the process 
of talks, this constraint might diminish in the future. 
The US alliance with Japan, where the largest number of troops were stationed, 
was critical to American strategy. Over the years following the report, the security 
relationship was strengthened despite controversy over the rape of a schoolgirl by 
American marines in Okinawa in September 1995 and the ensuing contention over 
the presence of American bases there. Despite these serious problems, the Japanese 
Diet promised $25 billion in support of American forces over the next ﬁve years, and 
Japan’s National Defense Program Outline reinforced the centrality of the American 
alliance for defense planning. In April 1996, Prime Minister Hashimoto and President 
Clinton publicly afﬁrmed the work of a joint group that redeﬁned the US-Japan 
Security Treaty as the basis for stability in the region after the Cold War, and the 
two countries began to work out guidelines for Japanese support in time of crisis. 
Indeed, that reafﬁrmation may turn out to have been one of the most important policy 
developments for the region. It meant that China could not play a Japan card against 
the US or try to expel the Americans from the region. From that position of strength, 
the United States, Japan, and other states could work together to engage China as its 
regional power developed. 
Some analysts feared that this approach would drive China and Russia to recon-
struct their anti-American alliance of the 1950s—a prospect hinted at by the Sino-
Russian Summit after the 1996 Clinton-Hashimoto reafﬁrmation of the US-Japan 
Security Treaty. While diplomatic coordination was to be expected, a tight alliance 
seemed unlikely. First, as Mikhail Nosov has pointed out, China and Russia have 
“problems connected with the demographic situation in the Far East, where the popu-
lation on the Russian side of the border is 6 to 8 million, and on the China side is up 
to 120 million.”11 Additionally, as Zbigniew Brzezinski has noted, “greater China’s 
geopolitical inﬂuence is not necessarily incompatible with America’s strategic 
interest in a stable pluralistic Eurasia.”12 At some point, a recovered Russia might 
again be included in a concert for regional stability, but in 1995, such a prospect 
seemed to be at least a decade away. Indeed, the severity of Russia’s current social, 
economic, and military infrastructural problems offers evidence that this estimate 
may have been conservative.

The “Nye Report:” Six Years Later
East Asia, 2001 
In retrospect, the assumptions of the 1995 report have held up quite well. While 
implementation is never perfect, policy has generally been consistent with the report’s 
strategy. The United States today faces four major challenges to the strategy of 
maintaining a formal alliance with Japan and normal relations with China: China 
itself, Taiwan, Korea, and troop deployments. All are related, but each poses unique 
problems. 
In recent years, China has become a political issue in American politics, and that 
has led to exaggeration of its position. It is not the giant threat seen by many in the 
Congress, where China politics is often characterized by an unholy alliance of left 
and right against the center. Chinese growth rates of 8–9% per year have led to a 
tripling of its GNP in less than two decades. At a 6% growth rate, in 30 years, China’s 
economy would total $16 trillion. The Asian Development Bank projects China’s per 
capita income to reach the equivalent of about 38% of the United States in 2025.13 
Such linear projections are suspect, however, and China faces serious problems with 
its state-owned enterprises, its shaky banking system, and the value of its currency. 
If China fails to make essential reforms, bottlenecks and growing income inequality 
could slow growth considerably. Even at the higher growth rates, China will lag well 
behind both the Unites States and Japan in per capita income. 
With a growing economy, Chinese military strength is likely to increase over 
the next few decades. Even if that does not make China a global power or one 
regionally equivalent to the United States, it does mean that China is likely to look 
more intimidating to its neighbors, and its enhanced capabilities will mean that any 
American military tasks will require greater forces and resources than is presently 
the case. In other words, the rise of China as a military power, like its economic 
reemergence, must be taken seriously as a new factor in the region. But, China will 
not be a global challenger to the US, nor will it be able to exercise regional hegemony 
so long as the United States stays involved in East Asia and maintains its alliance 
with Japan. 
Taiwan was treated very lightly in the 1995 report, but it is central to any China 
policy. Because of history and the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States has to 
walk a tightrope between risking war with China and abandoning the people of 
Taiwan. Nationalism has become more important than communism in China, and 
even the new generation believes that Taiwan is an integral part of China and worth 
ﬁghting for. At the same time, Taiwan has become democratic and unwilling to see 
itself submerged into the current Chinese system. The United States has an interest 
in protecting the freedom of Taiwan’s people and markets, but not in the symbolism 
of a separate Taiwanese ﬂag. America is committed to helping Taiwan defend itself 
against coercion, but not to protecting its formal independence. Washington should be 
clear that US policy is “no independence and no use of force.” Within that framework,
13 Asian Development Bank, “Emerging Asia: Changes and Challenges.” Manila: Asian Develop-
ment Bank.1997, p. 11. 

East Asia, 2001
137
the United States should encourage the two sides to bargain about more international 
living space for Taiwan and more exchange of goods and people across the strait. 
If the United States can maintain a dynamic status quo over time, differences may 
diminish as Taiwan contributes to change in China. President Clinton could have 
made this more clearer when he was in Shanghai by uttering a fourth “no”—no use 
of force—in addition to the three that recognize “one China.” On the other hand, 
those in Congress who are pressing for legislation that openly commits the US to 
defend Taiwan under any circumstances may encourage Taiwanese politicians to take 
risks that could jeopardize their own freedoms, as well as involve the United States 
in an unnecessary conﬂict. The best motto for all is “don’t rock the boat.” 
The third security challenge, North Korea, is a special story. The July 2000 summit 
between South Korean leader Kim Dae-Jung and his Pyongyang counterpart Kim 
Jong-Il was a major event, and the news that North Korea agreed to freeze missile tests 
during talks with the United States was a welcome ﬁrst fruit of the initiative launched 
in 1999 by former Defense Secretary William Perry. If such progress continues, a 
major security threat will diminish. 
On the other hand, the situation in North Korea remains highly uncertain. The 
secretive and isolated DPRK regime remains difﬁcult for Americans and other 
outsiders to understand. With over a million-man army, two-thirds of which is 
stationed within 100 km of the demilitarized zone, North Korea continues to pose 
a conventional military threat. And although the nuclear program at Yongbyon is 
frozen and subject to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, if 
Pyongyang expelled the inspectors, it would have access to enough plutonium to 
make half a dozen nuclear weapons. Some observers argue that these threats are 
more apparent than real. It is true that economic conditions have dulled the readiness 
of North Korea’s conventional forces, and the Framework Agreement has frozen the 
nuclear program, but there is still a risk. Indeed, in desperate circumstances, risks 
may increase. Imagine a person standing on the roof of a ten-story building that 
is being consumed by ﬁre and all exits are blocked. If he jumps, there is only one 
chance in 20 that he will survive. If he remains where he is, there in a 100% chance 
that he will die. It is rational to jump, despite the low odds of survival. The danger is 
that desperation could lead the North Korean regime to take such high-risk actions. 
The results would be devastating for the Korean peninsula. The right response is to 
maintain a high readiness of the South Korean and US forces to deter such action, 
but also to provide other exits. 
North Korea’s modest overtures of late may be a product of this combination. 
Whether Kim Jong-Il can open his country’s economy without losing political control 
is highly questionable, and the opening may suffer setbacks. Even if there is continued 
progress, it is likely to be slow. Thus, American troops are likely to remain in South 
Korea for some time. Moreover, Kim Dae-Jung has reported that Kim Jong-Il has 
come to agree that the United States should maintain a military presence in South 
Korea as a counterpoise to Korea’s being surrounded by major powers China, Russia

138
The “Nye Report:” Six Years Later
and Japan.14 This remarkable statement by North Korea’s leader offers evidence that, 
as a small state in the shadow of its giant neighbors, even a uniﬁed Korea may have 
a strong incentive to maintain an alliance with the United States. 
Nonetheless, if the North Korean threat diminishes, there will be domestic pressure 
to reduce the 37,000 American troops on the peninsula, and the United States should 
be prepared to respond in a positive manner. Maintaining a small number of troops 
in Korea reduces the singularity of Japan as a host to American forces in the region. 
Even so, the United States should plan to reduce its military footprint in Japan, 
particularly on Okinawa. Implementation of the recommendations of the Special 
Action Committee on Okinawa is a ﬁrst step, but it would also be useful to plan for a 
new deployment that would shift some Marine Corps units to Australia and Guam. In 
addition, an updated strategy would explore more joint logistics, repair, and training 
facilities in Southeast Asia such as currently exist with Singapore. It is important 
that the number 100,000 does not become a shibboleth. Future plans should focus 
on the function of reassurance, not the number of troops. 
Conclusions 
Like Britain in the mid-nineteenth century, the United States after the Cold War is a 
preponderant but not dominant power. If the largest beneﬁciary of a public good (such 
as international order) does not take the lead toward its maintenance, nobody else 
will. Maintaining the balance of power in a region, promoting an open international 
economy, and maintaining the commons (such as the law of the sea) are classic tasks 
of the largest power. Within that framework, economic and social change can develop 
the interdependence which, as in Europe, can transform a region in the long run. 
America’s role as a stabilizer and a reassurance against the rise of hostile hege-
monic states is strongly in the US national interest. The United States will stay 
involved because events and actors around the world can pose signiﬁcant security 
threats and because Americans want to inﬂuence distant governments and organi-
zations on a variety of issues such as proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
terrorism, human rights, and the environment. 
Nowhere is this more true than in East Asia, where the United States can also 
beneﬁt from participating in one of the most dynamic parts of the world economy. 
To protect those interests, America’s alliance with Japan and engagement of China 
as a normal country remain the appropriate long-run US strategies.

The Dollar and the Dragon 
Originally published 
by Project Syndicate on

Of the many factors affecting US-China relations, economics and trade is at the core. 
An issue that has fundamentally remained unchanged for the past decade is China’s 
large US dollar reserves. A bargaining chip on both sides is used by politicians and 
society alike to color US-China relations, but should this change dramatically, it 
could end up hurting both sides. 
For several years, American ofﬁcials have pressed China to revalue its currency. They 
complain that the undervalued renminbi represents unfair competition, destroying 
American jobs, and contributing to the United States’ trade deﬁcit. How, then, should 
US ofﬁcials respond? 
Just before the recent G-20 meeting in Toronto, China announced a formula that 
would allow modest renminbi appreciation, but some American Congressmen remain 
unconvinced and threaten to increase tariffs on Chinese goods. 
America absorbs Chinese imports, pays China in dollars, and China holds dollars, 
amassing $2.5 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves, much of it held in US Treasury 
securities. To some observers, this represents a fundamental shift in the global balance 
of power, because China could bring the US to its knees by threatening to sell its 
dollars. 
But, if China were to bring the US to its knees, it might bring itself to its ankles 
in the process. China would not only reduce the value of its reserves as the dollar’s 
value fell, but it would also jeopardize America’s continued willingness to import 
cheap Chinese goods, which would mean job losses and instability in China.

The Dollar and the Dragon
Judging whether economic interdependence produces power requires looking at 
the balance of asymmetries, not just at one side of the equation. In this case, inter-
dependence has created a “balance of ﬁnancial terror” analogous to the Cold War, 
when the US and the Soviet Union never used their potential to destroy each other 
in a nuclear exchange. 
In February 2010, angered over American arms sales to Taiwan, a group of senior 
military ofﬁcers called for the Chinese government to sell off US government bonds 
in retaliation. Their proposal went unheeded. Instead, Yi Gang, China’s director of 
State Administration of Foreign Exchange, explained that “Chinese investments in 
US Treasuries are market investment behavior, and we don’t wish to politicize them.” 
Otherwise, the pain would be mutual. 
Nevertheless, this balance does not guarantee stability. There is always the 
danger of actions with unintended consequences, especially as both countries can be 
expected to maneuver to change the framework and reduce their vulnerabilities. For 
example, after the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, while the US pressed China to let its currency 
appreciate, ofﬁcials at China’s central bank began arguing that America needed to 
increase its savings, reduce its deﬁcits, and move toward supplementing the dollar’s 
role as a reserve currency with IMF-issued special drawing rights. 
But China’s bark was louder than its bite. China’s increased ﬁnancial power may 
have increased its ability to resist American entreaties, but despite dire predictions, 
its creditor role has not been sufﬁcient to compel the US to change its policies. 
While China has taken minor measures to slow the increase in its dollar-
denominated holdings, it has been unwilling to risk a fully convertible currency for 
domestic political reasons. Thus, the renminbi is unlikely to challenge the dollar’s 
role as the largest component of world reserves (more than 60%) in the next decade. 
Yet, as China gradually increases domestic consumption rather than relying on 
exports as its engine of economic growth, its leaders may begin to feel less dependent 
than they now are on access to the US market as a source of job creation, which is 
crucial for internal political stability. In that case, maintaining a weak renminbi would 
protect the trade balance from a ﬂood of imports. 
Asymmetries in currency markets are a particularly important aspect of economic 
power, since they underlie global trade and ﬁnancial markets. By limiting the convert-
ibility of its currency, China is avoiding currency markets’ ability to discipline 
domestic economic decisions. 
Compare, for example, the discipline that international banks and the IMF were 
able to impose on Indonesia and South Korea in 1998, with the relative freedom 
of the US—bestowed by denomination of American debt in dollars—to increase 
government spending in response to the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. Indeed, rather than 
weakening, the dollar has appreciated as investors regard the underlying strength of 
the US as a safe haven. 
Obviously, a country whose currency represents a signiﬁcant proportion of world 
reserves can gain international power from that position, thanks to easier terms for 
economic adjustment and the ability to inﬂuence other countries. As French Presi-
dent Charles de Gaulle once complained, “since the dollar is the reference currency

The Dollar and the Dragon
143
everywhere, it can cause others to suffer the effects of its poor management. This is 
not acceptable. This cannot last.” 
But it did. America’s military and economic strength reinforces conﬁdence in 
the dollar as a safe haven. As a Canadian analyst put it, “the combined effect of an 
advanced capital market and a strong military machine to defend that market, and 
other safety measures, such as a strong tradition of property rights protection and a 
reputation for honoring dues, has made it possible to attract capital with great ease.” 
The G-20 is focusing on the need to “rebalance” ﬁnancial ﬂows, altering the old 
pattern of US deﬁcits matching Chinese surpluses. This would require politically 
difﬁcult shifts in consumption and investment, with America increasing its savings 
and China increasing domestic consumption. 
Such changes do not occur quickly. Neither side is in a hurry to break the symmetry 
of interdependent vulnerability, but both continue to jockey to shape the structure 
and institutional framework of their market relationship. For the sake of the global 
economy, let us hope that neither side miscalculates.

Is China Overtaking America? 
Originally published

on April 7, 2011. 
The rise of one power often raises questions of replacing another. This is currently 
the question in the case of China and its rise vis-à-vis the United States. However, if 
China is overtaking America, it must be asked in what sense? Even if Chinese and US 
GDP reach parity, the two economies might be equal in size, but not in composition. 
China faces far greater obstacles to sustainable growth and global success than 
many estimates suggest. 
The twenty-ﬁrst century is witnessing Asia’s return to what might be considered 
its historical proportions of the world’s population and economy. In 1800, Asia 
represented more than half of global population and output. By 1900, it represented 
only 20% of world output—not because something bad happened in Asia, but rather 
because the Industrial Revolution had transformed Europe and North America into 
the world’s workshop. 
Asia’s recovery began with Japan, then moved to South Korea and on to Southeast 
Asia, beginning with Singapore and Malaysia. Now, the recovery is focused on China 
and increasingly involves India, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty 
in the process. 
This change, however, is also creating anxieties about shifting power rela-
tions among states. In 2010, China passed Japan to become the world’s second-
largest economy. Indeed, the investment bank Goldman Sachs expects the Chinese 
economy’s total size to surpass that of the United States by 2027. 
But, even if overall Chinese GDP reaches parity with that of the US in the 2020s, 
the two economies will not be equal in composition. China would still have a vast 
underdeveloped countryside. Assuming 6% Chinese GDP growth and only 2% US

growth after 2030, China would not equal the US in terms of per capita income—a 
better measure of an economy’s sophistication—until sometime near the second half 
of the century. 
Moreover, linear projections of economic growth trends can be misleading. 
Emerging countries tend to beneﬁt from imported technologies in the early stages of 
economic takeoff, but their growth rates generally slow as they reach higher levels of 
development. And the Chinese economy faces serious obstacles to sustainable rapid 
growth, owing to inefﬁcient state-owned enterprises, growing inequality, massive 
internal migration, an inadequate social safety net, corruption, and inadequate 
institutions, all of which could foster political instability. 
China’s north and east have outpaced its south and west. Almost alone among 
developing countries, China is aging extraordinarily fast. By 2030, China will have 
more elderly dependents than children. Some Chinese demographers worry that the 
country will get old before getting rich. 
During the past decade, China moved from being the world’s ninth-largest exporter 
to its leader, displacing Germany at the top. But China’s export-led development 
model will need to be adjusted as global trade and ﬁnancial balances become more 
contentious. Indeed, China’s 12th Five-Year Plan is aimed at reducing dependence 
on exports and boosting domestic demand. Will it work? 
China’s authoritarian political system has thus far shown an impressive capacity to 
achieve speciﬁc targets, for example, staging a successful Olympic Games, building 
high-speed rail projects, or even stimulating the economy to recover from the global 
ﬁnancial crisis. Whether China can maintain this capability over the longer term is a 
mystery to outsiders and Chinese leaders themselves. 
Unlike India, which was born with a democratic constitution, China has not yet 
found a way to channel the demands for political participation (if not democracy) 
that tend to accompany rising per capita income. Communist ideology is long gone, 
so the legitimacy of the ruling party depends on economic growth and ethnic Han 
nationalism. Whether China can develop a formula to manage an expanding urban 
middle class, regional inequality, and resentment among ethnic minorities remains 
to be seen. The basic point is that no one, including the Chinese, knows how China’s 
political future will affect its economic growth. 
Some analysts argue that China aims to challenge America’s position as the 
world’s dominant power. Even if this were an accurate assessment of China’s inten-
tions (and even Chinese cannot know the views of future generations), it is doubtful 
that China will have the military capability to make this possible. To be sure, Chinese 
military expenditures, up more than 12% this year, have been growing even more 
rapidly than its economy. But China’s leaders will have to contend with other coun-
tries’ reactions, as well as with the constraints implied by the need for external 
markets and resources in order to meet their economic growth objectives. 
A Chinese military posture that is too aggressive could produce a countervailing 
coalition among its neighbors, thereby weakening China’s hard and soft power. In 
2010, for example, as China became more assertive in its foreign policy toward 
its neighbors, its relations with India, Japan, and South Korea suffered. As a result, 
China will ﬁnd it more difﬁcult to exclude the US from Asia’s security arrangements.

China’s size and high rate of economic growth will almost certainly increase its 
relative strength vis-à-vis the US in the coming decades. This will certainly bring the 
Chinese closer to the US in terms of power resources, but China will not necessarily 
surpass the US as the most powerful country. 
Even if China suffers no major domestic political setback, many current projec-
tions based on GDP growth alone are too one-dimensional: They ignore US mili-
tary and soft power advantages, as well as China’s geopolitical disadvantages in the 
internal Asian balance of power. My own estimate is that among the range of possible 
futures, the more likely scenarios are those in which China gives the US a run for its 
money, but does not surpass it in overall power in the ﬁrst half of this century. 
Most importantly, the US and China should avoid developing exaggerated fears 
of each other’s capacities and intentions. The expectation of conﬂict can itself 
become a cause of conﬂict. In reality, China and the US do not have deeply rooted 
conﬂicting interests. Both countries, along with others, have much more to gain from 
cooperation.

The Financial Crisis and US-China 
Misperceptions 
Originally published in 
the April 28, 2011, edition 
of China-US Focus. 
While some have predicted the fall of the US as a world leader and the possible rise 
of China to take its place in wake of the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, it is clear that things 
are not that simple. However, these two powers have much more to gain by working 
together. 
The decline of America and the ascendancy of China has become a popular theme, 
and nothing seemed to provide a clearer marker to those disposed to the idea than the 
ﬁnancial crisis of 2008 and the great recession that followed. America, larded with 
personal debt, saw the jewel in its empire, Wall Street, stumble and fall, while China, 
its great factories spewing exports across the Paciﬁc, became America’s lender, 
holding more than $2.5 trillion of foreign exchange reserves, much of it in U.S. 
bonds. 
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev warned that the United States’ global 
leadership was nearing an end, while Goldman Sachs even proposed a speciﬁc 
date—2027—by which China’s economy would overtake the United States. 
As I argue in my new book The Future of Power, one should be wary of extrap-
olating long-term trends from cyclical events. While few expect China to surpass 
the United States in military power in the next two decades, many still see the crisis 
as transformative in economic and soft power relations. It is important, therefore, to 
focus on the implications of the crisis in order to analyze the power relations between 
China and the United States. 
China has amply demonstrated its interest in the idea of soft power—the expres-
sion of power through attraction rather than coercion—with President Hu Jintao using

The Financial Crisis and US-China Misperceptions
the phrase in a speech to the country’s Communist Party Congress in 2007. And not 
surprisingly China has invested heavily in soft power. From the 2008 Olympic Games 
to the Shanghai Expo to the creation of a 24 hours news channel, from the establish-
ment of hundreds of Confucius cultural centers across the world to the creation of 
world-famous universities, China both created an impressive record of accomplish-
ment and sold a compelling narrative of a country on the rise. It has also adjusted 
its diplomacy, joining global and regional organizations, playing important roles in 
international negotiations, and offering goodwill gestures, such as the rebuilding of 
the Cambodian Parliament. 
But limits to that soft power have quickly become apparent, as evidenced by the 
jailing of Liu Xiaobo, the 2010 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Similar actions 
such as the locking up of human rights lawyers after the recent events in the Middle 
East have the effect of undercutting China’s soft power in democratic countries such 
as Europe, Japan, India, and the US. 
American soft power rests on a variety of resources that range from Hollywood 
to Harvard; from Madonna to the Gates Foundation; from Martin Luther King’s 
speeches to Barack Obama’s election. It is not easy for governments to sell their 
country’s charm if their narrative is inconsistent with domestic realities. Despite its 
perceived role for the ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, the United States’ soft power remained 
greater. According to a poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, China’s image 
in most of the Americas, Asia, and Europe is neutral or poor, and only Africa and 
some parts of Asia see it positively. 
China’s impressive economic growth has added to its soft power, and obviously to 
its hard economic and military power. Analysts point to China’s seemingly unstop-
pable growth and its holdings of United States dollars. But they fail to take into 
account the role of symmetry in interdependence in creating and limiting economic 
power. If I depend on you more than you depend on me, you have power. But if we 
both depend equally upon each other, there is little power in the relationship. 
Some observers have described this as a great shift in the global balance of power 
because China could bring the United States to its knees by threatening to sell its 
dollars. But in doing so, China would not only reduce the value of its reserves as the 
price of the dollar fell, but it would also jeopardize U.S. willingness to continue to 
import cheap Chinese goods, which would mean job loss and instability in China. 
If it dumped its dollars, China would bring the United States to its knees, but might 
also bring itself to its ankles. The situation, analogous to the Cold War’s balance of 
terror, where the price of aggression was the inevitable destruction of both sides, has 
both sides eager to maintain the balance of interdependence even as they continue to 
jockey to shape the structure and institutional framework of their market relationship. 
Given the challenges they face, both countries have much to gain by working 
together. As the largest and second-largest economies in the world, the US and 
China have a responsibility to provide such international public goods as ﬁnancial 
stability and less carbon-intensive growth. But hubris and nationalism among some 
Chinese, as well as unnecessary fear of decline among some Americans, make it 
difﬁcult to assure this future. Extrapolating the wrong long-term projections from 
short-term cyclical events like the recent ﬁnancial crisis can lead to costly policy 
miscalculations. The last two years provide ample evidence of misperceptions and

of putting US-China relations on a more fruitful track than in the period right after

Work with China, Don’t Contain It

China of today is not the Soviet Union of the Cold War. During the Clinton admin-
istration, we rejected the idea of containment for two reasons. If we treated China 
as an enemy, we were guaranteeing a future enemy. If we treated China as a friend, 
we kept open the possibility of a more peaceful future. Today, the American-Chinese 
relationship “has elements of both cooperation and competition.”

The 
Economist warned last week that “China and Japan are sliding toward war.” That 
assessment may be too alarmist, but the tensions have bolstered the efforts of some 
American analysts who have urged a policy to “contain” China. 
During a recent visit to China, I was struck by how many Chinese ofﬁcials believe 
such a policy is already in place and is the central purpose of President Obama’s 
“pivot” toward Asia. “The pivot is a very stupid choice,” Jin Canrong, a professor of 
international relations, declared publicly. “The United States has achieved nothing 
and only annoyed China. China can’t be contained,” he added. 
Containment was designed for a different era, and it is not what the United States 
is, or should be, attempting now. At the start of the Cold War, containment meant 
economic isolation of the Soviets and regional alliances like NATO to deter Moscow’s 
military expansion. Later, to the chagrin of George F. Kennan, the father of contain-
ment, the doctrine led to the “domino effect” theory behind the escalation of the 
Vietnam War. 
Cold War containment involved virtually no trade and little social contact. But 
China now is not what the Soviet Union was then. It is not seeking global hegemony,

and the United States not only has an immense trade with China but also huge 
exchanges of students and tourists. 
When I worked on the Pentagon’s East Asia strategy in 1994, during the Clinton 
administration, we rejected the idea of containment for two reasons. If we treated 
China as an enemy, we were guaranteeing a future enemy. If we treated China as a 
friend, we kept open the possibility of a more peaceful future. 
We devised a strategy of “integrate but hedge”—something like Ronald Reagan’s 
“trust but verify.” America supported China’s membership in the World Trade Orga-
nization and accepted Chinese goods and visitors. But a 1996 declaration reafﬁrmed 
that the postwar United States-Japan security treaty was the basis for a stable and 
prosperous East Asia. President Clinton also began to improve relations with India 
to counterbalance China’s rise. 
This strategy has enjoyed bipartisan support. President George W. Bush continued 
to improve relations with India, while deepening economic ties with China. His 
deputy secretary of state, Robert B. Zoellick, made clear that America would accept 
the rise of China as a “responsible stakeholder.” 
Mr. Obama’s “rebalancing” toward Asia involves moving naval resources to the 
Paciﬁc, but also trade, human rights, and diplomatic initiatives. As his national 
security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, said in November, the American-Chinese 
relationship “has elements of both cooperation and competition.” 
Asia is not a monolith, and its internal balance of power should be the key to our 
strategy. Japan, India, Vietnam, and other countries do not want to be dominated by 
China and thus welcome an American presence in the region. Unless China is able 
to attract allies by successfully developing its “soft power,” the rise in its “hard” 
military and economic power is likely to frighten its neighbors, who will coalesce to 
balance its power. 
A signiﬁcant American military and economic presence helps to maintain the 
Asian balance of power and shape an environment that provides incentives for China 
to cooperate. After the 2008–2009 ﬁnancial crisis, some Chinese mistakenly believed 
that America was in permanent decline and that this presented new opportunities. A 
result was that China worsened its relations with Japan, India, South Korea, Vietnam, 
and the Philippines—a misstep that conﬁrmed that “only China can contain China.” 
But America’s rebalancing toward Asia should not be aggressive. We should 
heed Mr. Kennan’s warning against overmilitarization and ensure that China does 
not feel encircled or endangered. The world’s two largest economies have much to 
gain from cooperation on ﬁghting climate change, pandemics, cyberterrorism, and 
nuclear proliferation. 
With China becoming more dependent on Middle Eastern energy, we should 
discuss maritime regulations to ensure free passage of ships and include China in 
Paciﬁc naval exercises. We should help China develop domestic energy resources 
like shale gas and encourage China and Japan to revive their 2008 plan for joint 
undersea gas exploitation. And we should make clear that if China meets certain 
standards, it can join the negotiations over the Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership, a proposed 
free-trade agreement around the Paciﬁc Rim.

Work with China, Don’t Contain It

Containment is simply not a relevant policy tool for dealing with a rising China. 
Power is the ability to obtain the outcomes one wants, and sometimes, America’s 
power is greater when we act with others rather than merely over others.

The Future of U.S.-China Relations 
Originally published in the 
March 10, 2015 edition of 
US-China Focus. 
As China grows stronger and talk of a “new type of major power relations” emerges, 
discussion of “rebalancing” US policy toward Asia has become an important topic. 
Some see conﬂict in the future of US-China relations, but while human error and 
miscalculation are always possible, with the right choices, conﬂict is not inevitable. 
When Xi Jinping visits the U.S. this autumn, one of the items on his agenda is bound 
to be what he has called a “new type of major power relations.” The term remains 
ambiguous, and some Americans fear that it is a device for disrupting American 
alliances. Chinese scholars reply that it is a genuine effort to avoid the dangerous 
dynamics between a rising and an established power that helped precipitate the 
Peloponnesian War and World War I. 
Looking ahead, pessimists predict an impending clash as China grows stronger 
and seeks to expel the U.S. from the Western Paciﬁc. Some argue that this can be 
forestalled by the acceptance of spheres of inﬂuence in which the U.S. restricts 
its activities primarily to the Eastern Paciﬁc. But such a response to China’s rise 
would destroy American credibility and lead regional states into bandwagoning rather 
than balancing China. Instead, a continued U.S. presence in the Western Paciﬁc can 
reinforce the natural balancing reactions of regional states and help to shape the 
environment in a way that encourages responsible Chinese behavior. 
An appropriate policy response to the rise of China must balance realism and 
integration. When the Clinton Administration ﬁrst considered how to respond to the 
rise of China in the 1990s, some critics urged a policy of containment before China 
became too strong. We rejected such advice for two reasons. First, it would have been 
impossible to forge an anti-China alliance since most countries in the region wanted

The Future of U.S.-China Relations
(and still want) good relations with both the U.S. and China. Even more important, 
such a policy would have unnecessarily guaranteed future enmity with China. As I 
used to say in my speeches when I was responsible for East Asia in the Pentagon, if 
you treat China as an enemy, you are certain to have an enemy. 
Instead, the U.S. chose a policy that could be called “integrate and insure.” China 
was welcomed into the World Trade Organization, but the U.S.-Japan security treaty 
was revived to insure against China becoming a bully. If a rising China throws its 
weight around, it drives neighbors to seek to balance its power. In that sense, only 
China can contain China. 
This is a key point in assessing the relative power of the U.S. and China. As 
Yan Xuetong wrote about how China could defeat America, “to shape a friendly 
international environment for its rise, Beijing needs to develop more high-quality 
diplomatic and military relationships than Washington. No leading power is able to 
have friendly relations with every country in the world, thus the core of competition 
between China and the United States will be to see who has more high-quality 
friends.” At this point, the United States is better placed to beneﬁt from such networks 
and alliances. Washington has about 60 treaty allies; China has few. In political 
alignments, the Economist estimates that of the 150 largest countries in the world, 
nearly 100 lean toward the United States; 21 lean against. 
In 2011, the United States announced a strategy of rebalancing toward Asia, the 
fastest growing part of the world economy. Some Chinese see the Obama Admin-
istration policy of “rebalancing” towards Asia as a form of containment, but unlike 
the Cold War doctrine when the U.S. had virtually no trade or social contact with 
the Soviet Union, it has massive trade with China and more than 250,000 students 
in American universities. Shaping the environment for Chinese decisions is a more 
accurate description than containment for American strategy. 
Some analysts see China as a revisionist state eager to overthrow the established 
international order as its strength increases. But China is not a full-ﬂedged revisionist 
state like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union in the last century. While it has joined 
in the creation of a BRICS development bank and promotes regional organizations 
that suit its needs, China has beneﬁted greatly from and is not eager to destroy 
existing international institutions such as the UN, the International Monetary Fund, 
and the World Trade Organization—as well as many others. American allies help 
shape the environment that encourages responsible behavior, and China cares about 
its reputation. 
In addition, technological and social changes are adding a number of impor-
tant transnational issues to the global agenda such as climate change, pandemics, 
terrorism, organized crime, and cybercrime. These issues represent not a transition 
of power among states, but a diffusion of power away from governments. Coping 
with these global threats will require increased intergovernmental cooperation that 
includes China, Europe, and the United States and others. 
China aspires to play a larger role in East Asia and the U.S. has Asian allies 
to whose defense it is committed. Miscalculations are always possible, but conﬂict 
is far from inevitable. The legitimacy of the Chinese government depends on a 
high rate of economic growth; the top leaders realize that China will need many

decades before it approaches the sophistication of the American economy. Where 
Germany was pressing hard on Britain’s heels (and passed it in industrial strength), 
the U.S. remains decades ahead of China in overall military, economic, and soft 
power resources at the global level. Moreover, China cannot afford a policy like that 
of the Kaiser’s Germany. Too adventuresome, a policy risks its gains and stability at 
home and abroad. 
In other words, the United States has more time to manage it relations with a rising 
power than Britain did a century ago, and China has more incentives for restraint than 
Germany had. This provides an opportunity to work out a new type of major power 
relationship if the U.S. continues to avoid containment as a strategy and if China 
accepts the legitimacy of the American presence in the Western Paciﬁc. Whether 
the United States and China will manage to develop such a relationship is another 
question. Human error and miscalculation are always possible. But with the right 
choices, conﬂict is not inevitable.

The Kindleberger Trap 
Originally published 
by Project Syndicate on 
January 9, 2017. 
Charles Kindleberger, one of the intellectual architects of the Marshall Plan, argued 
that the disastrous decade of the 1930s was a result of the United States’ failure to 
provide global public goods after it had replaced Britain as the leading power. Today, 
as China’s power grows, will it make the same mistake? 
As US President-elect Donald Trump prepares his administration’s policy toward 
China, he should be wary of two major traps that history has set for him. The 
“Thucydides Trap,” cited by Chinese President Xi Jinping, refers to the warning 
by the ancient Greek historian that cataclysmic war can erupt if an established power 
(like the United States) becomes too fearful of a rising power (like China). But Trump 
also has to worry about the “Kindleberger Trap”: a China that seems too weak rather 
than too strong. 
Charles Kindleberger, an intellectual architect of the Marshall Plan who later 
taught at MIT, argued that the disastrous decade of the 1930s was caused when the 
US replaced Britain as the largest global power but failed to take on Britain’s role in 
providing global public goods. The result was the collapse of the global system into 
depression, genocide, and world war. Today, as China’s power grows, will it help 
provide global public goods? 
In domestic politics, governments produce public goods such as policing or a 
clean environment, from which all citizens can beneﬁt and none are excluded. At the 
global level, public goods—such as a stable climate, ﬁnancial stability, or freedom 
of the seas—are provided by coalitions led by the largest powers.

The Kindleberger Trap
Small countries have little incentive to pay for such global public goods. Because 
their small contributions make little difference to whether they beneﬁt or not, it is 
rational for them to ride for free. But the largest powers can see the effect and feel 
the beneﬁt of their contributions. So it is rational for the largest countries to lead. 
When they do not, global public goods are under-produced. When Britain became 
too weak to play that role after World War I, an isolationist US continued to be a free 
rider, with disastrous results. 
Some observers worry that as China’s power grows, it will free ride rather than 
contribute to an international order that it did not create. So far, the record is mixed. 
China beneﬁts from the United Nations system, where it has a veto in the Security 
Council. It is now the second-largest funder of UN peacekeeping forces, and it 
participated in UN programs related to Ebola and climate change. 
China has also beneﬁted greatly from multilateral economic institutions like the 
World Trade Organization, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. 
In 2015, China launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which some saw 
as an alternative to the World Bank; but the new institution adheres to international 
rules and cooperates with the World Bank. 
On the other hand, China’s rejection of a Permanent Court of Arbitration judgment 
last year against its territorial claims in the South China Sea raises troublesome 
questions. Thus far, however, Chinese behavior has sought not to overthrow the 
liberal world order from which it beneﬁts, but to increase its inﬂuence within it. If 
pressed and isolated by Trump’s policy, however, will China become a disruptive 
free rider that pushes the world into a Kindleberger Trap? 
Trump must also worry about the better-known Thucydides Trap: a China that 
seems too strong rather than too weak. There is nothing inevitable about this trap, 
and its effects are often exaggerated. For example, the political scientist Graham 
Allison has argued that in 12 of 16 cases since 1500 when an established power has 
confronted a rising power, the result has been a major war. 
But these numbers are not accurate, because it is not clear what constitutes a 
“case.” For example, Britain was the dominant world power in the mid-nineteenth 
century, but it let Prussia create a powerful new German empire in the heart of the 
European continent. Of course, Britain did ﬁght Germany a half-century later, in 
1914, but should that be counted as one case or two? 
World War I was not simply a case of an established Britain responding to a 
rising Germany. In addition to the rise of Germany, WWI was caused by the fear 
in Germany of Russia’s growing power, the fear of rising Slavic nationalism in a 
declining Austria-Hungary, as well as myriad other factors that differed from ancient 
Greece. 
As for current analogies, today’s power gap between the US and China is much 
greater than that between Germany and Britain in 1914. Metaphors can be useful 
as general precautions, but they become dangerous when they convey a sense of 
historical inexorableness. 
Even the classical Greek case is not as straightforward as Thucydides made it 
seem. He claimed that the cause of the second Peloponnesian War was the growth of 
the power of Athens and the fear it caused in Sparta. But the Yale historian Donald

The Kindleberger Trap
163
Kagan has shown that Athenian power was in fact not growing. Before the war broke 
out in 431 BC, the balance of power had begun to stabilize. Athenian policy mistakes 
made the Spartans think that war might be worth the risk. 
Athens’ growth caused the ﬁrst Peloponnesian War earlier in the century, but then 
a Thirty-Year Truce doused the ﬁre. Kagan argues that to start the second, disastrous 
war, a spark needed to land on one of the rare bits of kindling that had not been 
thoroughly drenched and then continually and vigorously fanned by poor policy 
choices. In other words, the war was caused not by impersonal forces, but by bad 
decisions in difﬁcult circumstances. 
That is the danger that Trump confronts with China today. He must worry about 
a China that is simultaneously too weak and too strong. To achieve his objectives, 
he must avoid the Kindleberger trap as well as the Thucydides trap. But, above all, 
he must avoid the miscalculations, misperceptions, and rash judgments that plague 
human history.

The Cooperative Rivalry of US-China 
Relations 
Originally published 
by Project Syndicate on 
November 6, 2018. 
The US and China have entered a new phase in their relationship, but talk of a 
new Cold War is misleading. A better description of today’s bilateral relationship 
is “cooperative rivalry.” The US retains the upper hand strategically, and, on a 
growing number of issues, neither side can afford to go it alone. 
On a visit to Beijing in October, I was often asked whether US Vice President Mike 
Pence’s recent harsh criticism of China marked the declaration of a new Cold War. I 
replied that the United States and China have entered a new phase in their relationship, 
but that the Cold War metaphor is misleading. 
During the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union targeted tens of thousands 
of nuclear weapons at each other and had virtually no trade or cultural ties. By 
contrast, China has a more limited nuclear force, annual Sino-American trade totals 
a half-trillion dollars, and more than 350,000 Chinese students and three million 
tourists are in the US each year. A better description of today’s bilateral relationship 
is “cooperative rivalry.” 
Since the end of World War II, US-China relations have gone through three phases 
that lasted roughly two decades each. Hostility marked the 20 years after the Korean 
War, followed by limited cooperation against the Soviet Union during the phase that 
followed President Richard Nixon’s famous 1972 visit. 
The Cold War’s end ushered in a third phase of economic engagement, with the 
US helping China’s global economic integration, including its entry into the World 
Trade Organization in 2001. Yet in the ﬁrst post-Cold War decade, President Bill

The Cooperative Rivalry of US-China Relations
Clinton’s administration hedged its bets by simultaneously strengthening the US-
Japan alliance and improving relations with India. Now, since 2017, the US National 
Security Strategy focuses on great-power rivalry, with China and Russia designated 
as America’s main adversaries. 
While many Chinese analysts blame this fourth phase on US President Donald 
Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping is also to blame. By rejecting Deng Xiaoping’s 
prudent policy of maintaining a low international proﬁle; by ending presidential term 
limits; and by proclaiming his nationalistic “China Dream,” Xi might as well have 
been wearing a red hat reading, “Make China Great Again.” The conventional wisdom 
on China within the US had already begun to sour before the 2016 presidential 
election. Trump’s rhetoric and tariffs were merely gasoline poured on a smoldering 
ﬁre. 
The liberal international order helped China sustain rapid economic growth and 
reduce poverty dramatically. But China also tilted the trade ﬁeld to its advantage 
by subsidizing state-owned enterprises, engaging in commercial espionage, and 
requiring foreign ﬁrms to transfer their intellectual property to domestic “partners.” 
While most economists argue that Trump is mistaken to focus on the bilateral trade 
deﬁcit, many support his complaints about China’s efforts to challenge America’s 
technological advantage. 
Moreover, China’s growing military strength adds a security dimension to the 
bilateral relationship. While this fourth phase of the relationship is not a Cold War, 
owing to the high degree of interdependence, it is much more than a typical trade 
dispute like, say, America’s recent clash with Canada over access to that country’s 
dairy market. 
Some analysts believe this fourth phase marks the beginning of a conﬂict in which 
an established hegemon goes to war with a rising challenger. In his explanation of 
the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides famously argued that it was caused by Sparta’s 
fear of a rising Athens. 
These analysts believe that China’s rise will create a similar fear in the US and use 
the analogy of World War I, when a rising Germany set hegemonic Britain on edge. 
The causes of World War I, however, were far more complex and included growing 
Russian power, which created fear in Germany; rising nationalism in the Balkans 
and other countries; and the risks deliberately taken by the Habsburg Empire to stave 
off its decline. 
Even more important, Germany had already surpassed Britain in industrial produc-
tion by 1900, while China’s GDP (measured in dollars) currently is only three-ﬁfths 
the size of the US economy. The US has more time and assets to manage the rise 
of Chinese power than Britain had with Germany. China is constrained by a natural 
balance of power in Asia in which Japan (the world’s third-largest economy) and 
India (about to surpass China in population) have no desire to be dominated by it. 
Succumbing to the fear that Thucydides described would be an unnecessary self-
fulﬁlling prophecy for the US. Fortunately, polls show that the American public has 
not yet succumbed to a hysterical portrayal of China as an enemy as strong as the 
Soviet Union was during the Cold War.

The Cooperative Rivalry of US-China Relations
167
Neither China nor the US poses an existential threat to the other the way that 
Hitler’s Germany or Stalin’s Soviet Union did. China is not about to invade the US, 
and it is unable to expel America from the Western Paciﬁc, where most countries 
welcome its presence. Japan, a major part of the so-called ﬁrst island chain, pays 
nearly three-quarters of the host nation costs to keep 50,000 US troops based there. 
My recent visit to Tokyo conﬁrmed for me that the alliance with the US is strong. 
If the Trump administration maintains it, the prospects are slight that China can drive 
the US from the Western Paciﬁc, much less dominate the world. The US holds better 
strategic cards and need not succumb to Thucydidean fear. 
There is another dimension, however, that makes this fourth phase a “cooperative 
rivalry” rather than a Cold War. China and the US face transnational challenges that 
are impossible to resolve without the other. Climate change and rising sea levels 
obey the laws of physics, not politics. As borders become more porous to everything 
from illicit drugs to infectious diseases to terrorism, the largest economies will have 
to cooperate to cope with these threats. 
Some aspects of the relationship will involve a positive-sum game. US national 
security will require power with China, not just over China. The key question is 
whether the US is capable of thinking in terms of a “cooperative rivalry.” Can we 
walk and chew gum at the same time? In an age of populist nationalism, it is much 
easier for politicians to create fear about a new Cold War.

The Future of U.S.-China Relations After 
Buenos Aires 
Originally published in the 
December 7, 2018, edition of 
US-China Focus. 
As the trade war between the US and China ratcheted up, the tension could be felt 
and new lines were being drawn. However, the US still held the better cards, and 
Thucydidean fears were unnecessary. Tough bargaining was necessary, but, as is 
true today, some aspects of American national security require power with China, 
not just over China. 
The 90-day “truce of Bueno Aires” buys time for negotiations during the US-China 
trade war, but President Trump’s subsequent proclamation that he was “Tariff Man” 
and the ambiguities about what was agreed at the Trump-Xi dinner left markets 
shaken. An increase in China’s purchase of soybeans or natural gas might alleviate 
some political aspects of America’s bilateral trade deﬁcit, but it would do little 
to address the real problems of the China-US relationship. That will depend on 
the coming negotiations over the technological and intellectual property aspects of 
trade that will be led on the American side by Special Trade Representative Robert 
Lighthizer. 
Some analysts blame the current impasse on the idiosyncratic personality of 
Donald Trump, but it has deeper roots. Washington’s attitudes toward China were 
already changing, and Trump merely threw gasoline on a ﬁre that was already smol-
dering. The liberal international order helped China achieve dramatic economic 
growth and reduce poverty, but the degree of political and economic opening was 
disappointing. China also tilted the trade ﬁeld to its advantage with subsidies to 
state-owned enterprises and used commercial espionage and coercive measures to 
force foreign ﬁrms to transfer their intellectual property. While most economists

argue that Trump is mistaken to focus on the bilateral trade deﬁcit, many support his 
complaints about the means China has used to challenge America’s technological 
advantage. Moreover, China’s growing military strength and its reclamation projects 
in the South China Sea add a security concern, and things were not helped by China’s 
rejection of the 2016 Law of the Sea Tribunal decision. 
Some observers believe that the harsh speech by Vice President Mike Pence in 
early October meant that what we are witnessing is not a trade dispute, but a new Cold 
War. Others go further and see a “Thucydides Trap,” in which an established hegemon 
goes to war with a rising challenger. Thucydides attributed the Peloponnesian War 
to the rise in the power of Athens and the fear that created in Sparta. Analysts also 
cite World War I when the rise of Germany created fear in hegemonic Britain. But 
historical analogies can mislead. Germany had already surpassed Britain in industrial 
production by 1900 while China’s economy (measured in dollars) is today only 60% 
of that of the United States. And unlike the Cold War when the US and USSR had 
virtually no trade or social contact, the US and China have over a half trillion dollars 
in two-way trade and more than 350,000 Chinese students and three million tourists 
visit the US annually. 
People sometimes forget that there are two parts to Thucydides’ famous explana-
tion; “rise” and “fear” and they tend to focus only on the former. As former Treasury 
Secretary Larry Summers points out, we cannot stop the rise of Chinese economic 
power and the effort to do so would damage us all. But we can shape the political 
environment of China’s rise and we can do something about fear by not succumbing 
to unnecessary hysteria of the type that sometimes sweeps Washington. 
The US has more time and assets to manage the rise of Chinese power than Britain 
had with Germany. Asia has its own natural balance of power in which Japan (the 
world’s third-largest economy) and India (about to surpass China in population) 
have no desire to be dominated by China. For America to succumb to Thucydidean, 
thinking would be a damaging self-fulﬁlling prophecy. Fortunately, polls show that 
the American public does not yet see China as another Soviet Union. A recent Pew 
poll showed 38% of the public with a favorable view of China, down slightly from 
44% before the trade wars started in 2017 (and 40% during the 2012 election period.) 
The next 90 days will be accompanied by hard bargaining to press China to change 
some of its trade practices, but it will be important that the accompanying rhetoric 
does not pitch us into the fear side of a Thucydides trap. 
China does not pose an existential threat to us the way that Hitler’s Germany or 
Stalin’s Soviet Union did. China is a global economic power, but it casts a modest 
ideological shadow in terms of its soft power, and it is far from being a global military 
power. China has increased its military capabilities in its region, but it is unable 
to expel us from the Western Paciﬁc where most countries welcome an American 
presence. The largest part of the “ﬁrst island chain” is Japan which pays to keep 
50,000 American troops based there. The US still holds the better cards, and we 
need not succumb to Thucydidean fear. 
There is another reason why succumbing to hysteria would be a mistake. China 
and the US both face transnational challenges that are impossible to resolve without 
the cooperation of the other. Even if economic globalization slows, environmental

globalization will increase. The laws of physics are not bound by politics. The ancient 
Greeks did not have to worry about climate change and rising sea levels. As borders 
become more porous to everything from drugs to infectious diseases to terrorism, 
it will be important for the world’s two largest economies to cooperate to cope 
with these threats. That is why we should think of the US-China relationship as a 
“cooperative rivalry” rather than a revival of the Cold War. We should be prepared 
for tough bargaining, but some aspects of American national security will require 
power with China, not just over China.

For the US and China, Interdependence 
is a Double-Edged Sword 
Originally published by 
Financial Times 
on February 4, 2020. 
The Trump administration’s National Security Strategy had identiﬁed China as a 
strategic threat. But the question remained what kind of threat is it, and how much 
entanglement can the US afford? Repeated relationships can nurture co-operative 
restraint and reciprocity, while some interdependence, in which a state has a general 
interest in not upsetting the status quo, is systemic. 
With the coronavirus outbreak, nature has reminded us how much the US and China 
are economically entangled. But politics is also involved as some in Washington 
form strategies for a second Cold War and economic decoupling. 
Economic exchange can produce welfare gains for both sides, but it can also be 
used as a strategic weapon. The Trump administration’s National Security Strategy 
identiﬁes China as a strategic threat. But what kind of threat is it, and how much 
entanglement can the US afford? 
Understanding power and interdependence in the US-China relationship depends 
on understanding America’s strategic objectives. If its relationship with China is 
zero sum, and China’s long-term objective is to destroy the US much like Hitler’s 
Germany in the 1930s, then the less interdependence the better, though in the military 
and environmental domains some will be unavoidable. 
However, by focusing solely on the manipulation of economic vulnerability as 
a weapon, strategists can ignore that fact that interdependence can also have the 
positive effect of stabilizing deterrence. Punishment and denial are central to the 
classical conception of deterrence, but they are not the only components of dissuasion. 
Entanglement is another important means of making an actor see that the costs of an 
action will sometimes exceed the beneﬁts, hurting the attacker as well as the target.

For the US and China, Interdependence is a Double-Edged Sword
For example, in 2009 the People’s Liberation Army urged the Chinese government 
to sell some of China’s massive holdings of dollars to punish the US for selling 
arms to Taiwan. The People’s Bank of China pointed out, however, that doing so 
would impose large costs on China. The government sided with the central bank. 
Dumping dollars might bring the US to its knees, but it would also have devastating 
consequences for China. 
Similarly, in current scenarios that envisage a Chinese cyberattack on the US 
power grid, the two countries’ economic interdependence would mean costly damage 
to China as well. Precision attacks on minor economic targets might not produce 
much direct blowback, but the rising importance of the internet to economic growth 
increases general incentives for self-restraint. The legitimacy of the Chinese Commu-
nist party depends heavily upon economic growth, and economic growth in China 
increasingly depends upon the Internet. 
Critics of crude claims that economic interdependence guarantees peace, point to 
the ﬁrst world war as evidence that such ties did not prevent a catastrophic conﬂict 
between major trading partners. That is true, but it goes too far in dismissing outright 
the possibility that interdependence can reduce the probability of conﬂict. The author 
Norman Angell and others were wrong to argue before 1914 that economic inter-
dependence had made war impossible. But they were not wrong that it had greatly 
increased war’s cost. 
Of course, conﬂict is always possible because of human miscalculation. Most 
European leaders in 1914 incorrectly envisaged a short war with limited costs. And 
trade between the US and Japan did not prevent the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 
although that was partly caused by the American embargo on exports to Japan. The 
embargo manipulated economic interdependence in a way that led the Japanese to 
fear that failure to launch a risky attack would lead to their strangulation. 
Entanglement is sometimes called “self-deterrence,” but that term should not lead 
analysts to dismiss its importance. The belief that costs will exceed beneﬁts may 
be accurate, and self-restraint may result from rational calculations of interest. But 
we should remember that the perceptions of the target, though crucial, are not the 
only perceptions that matter in deterrence. It should also be a reminder that an 
international deterrent relationship is a complex set of repeated interactions between 
complex organizations that are not always unitary actors. Moreover, these actors can 
adjust their perceptions in varying ways. The economic relationship between the US 
and China is a good example of this. 
As the political scientist Robert Axelrod has shown, repeated relationships can 
nurture co-operative restraint and reciprocity. In addition, some interdependence, in 
which a state has a general interest in not upsetting the status quo, is systemic. 
It does not follow from this that we should ignore the strategic costs of interde-
pendence. And we should expect some decoupling of the US from China in sensitive 
high-tech areas that affect national security. Excluding companies such as Huawei 
from western 5G telecommunications networks is not very different from China’s 
exclusion of Google or Facebook for the past decade.

For the US and China, Interdependence is a Double-Edged Sword
175
But we should not let misplaced fears lead to comprehensive decoupling. Inter-
dependence is a double-edged sword, of course, but carefully wielded it can also 
contribute to deterrence and strategic stability.

Cold War with China Is Avoidable 
Originally published in the 
December 30, 2020 edition of the 
Wall Street Journal. 
Some say Donald Trump has bequeathed Joe Biden a new Cold War, but it is not 
yet a Cold War, and Mr. Trump is not the sole source of the problem. Unlike the 
Soviet Union, we cannot decouple our economy completely from China without 
costs. However, there are serious issues in US-China relations that require a broad 
strategy, which should include processes for accident avoidance, crisis management, 
and constant high level communication. 
American relations with China are at their lowest point in 50 years. Some say Donald 
Trump has bequeathed Joe Biden a new Cold War, which they deﬁne as intense 
competition without shooting. But it is not yet a Cold War, and Mr. Trump is not the 
sole source of the problem. 
In the past decade, Chinese leaders abandoned Deng Xiaoping’s moderate policy 
of biding their time. They became more assertive, building artiﬁcial islands in 
the South China Sea and coercing Australia economically. On trade, China tilted 
the playing ﬁeld with subsidies to state-owned enterprises and forced intellectual-
property transfer. Mr. Trump was clumsy in responding with tariffs on both allies and 
China, but he was correct to defend against Chinese companies like Huawei, whose 
plans to build 5G networks pose a security threat. 
It is a mistake, however, to think we can decouple our economy completely from 
China without enormous economic costs. That is why the Cold War metaphor is 
misleading. In the Cold War, the Soviet Union was a direct military and ideological 
threat to the U.S., and the two countries had almost no economic or social inter-
dependence. The U.S. does half a trillion dollars in trade annually with China, not 
to mention the millions of social interchanges like tourism. China has learned to

harness the creativity of markets to authoritarian Communist Party control in ways 
the Soviets never mastered. 
The U.S. and its allies are not threatened by the export of communism—few 
are taking to the streets in favor of Mr. Xi’s ideology—but by a hybrid system of 
economic and political interdependence that China can manipulate. More countries 
count China than the U.S. as their leading trade partner. Partial decoupling on security 
issues like Huawei is necessary, but total economic decoupling would be costly, and 
few allies would follow suit. 
Moreover, with regard to the ecological aspects of interdependence such as climate 
change and pandemics, the laws of physics and biology make decoupling impossible. 
No country can solve transnational problems alone. The politics of global interdepen-
dence involves using power with others as well as over others. For better and worse, 
we are locked in a “cooperative rivalry” with China in which we need a strategy that 
can accomplish two contradictory things at the same time. This is not like Cold War 
containment. 
Meeting the China challenge will require a more complex strategy that leverages 
American hard and soft power at home and abroad to defend ourselves and strengthen 
a rules-based system. Some pessimists look at China’s population size and economic 
growth rate and believe the task is impossible. On the contrary, if the U.S. treats allies 
as assets rather than liabilities, the combined wealth of the Western democracies will 
far exceed that of China well into this century. 
A successful challenge to China will require clear strategy with well-deﬁned goals. 
It will require establishing and defending technology standards and values that are 
consistent with freedom. A new Cold War cannot be ruled out. But as Henry Kissinger 
has warned, the appropriate historical metaphor today is not 1945 but 1914, when 
all the great powers expected a short third Balkan war. Instead, they got a world war 
that lasted four years and destroyed four empires. A successful strategy must also 
protect against such a sleepwalker syndrome. 
If China thinks it can coerce Taiwan with a blockade or by taking an offshore 
island—or there is a ship or aircraft collision that leads to loss of life—all bets 
are off. If the U.S. reacts by freezing Chinese assets or invoking the Trading with 
the Enemy Act, the world could slip quickly into a real Cold War or even a hot 
one. The Biden administration needs to prepare a broad strategy to meet the China 
challenge, and it must include processes for accident avoidance, crisis management, 
and constant high level communication. Otherwise, the result could be disastrous for 
China, the U.S., and the world.

The Logic of US-China Competition 
Originally published 
by Project Syndicate on 
May 26, 2021. 
The success of US President Joe Biden’s China policy will depend on whether the two 
powers can cooperate in producing global public goods, while competing in other 
areas. The US-China relationship is a “cooperative rivalry,” in which the terms of 
competition will require equal attention to both sides of the oxymoron. That will not 
be easy. 
In his recent address to the US Congress, President Joe Biden warned that China is 
deadly serious about trying to become the world’s most signiﬁcant power. But Biden 
also declared that autocrats will not win the future; America will. If mishandled, 
the US-China great-power competition could be dangerous. But if the United States 
plays it right, the rivalry with China could be healthy. 
The success of Biden’s China policy depends partly on China, but also on how 
the US changes. Maintaining America’s technological lead will be crucial and will 
require investing in human capital as well as in research and development. Biden has 
proposed both. At the same time, the US must cope with new transnational threats 
such as climate change and a pandemic that has killed more Americans than all 
the country’s wars, combined, since 1945. Tackling these challenges will require 
cooperation with China and others. 
Biden thus faces a daunting agenda and is treating the competition with China 
as a “Sputnik Moment.” Although he referred in his address to President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt and the Great Depression, and avoided misleading Cold War rhetoric, 
an apt comparison is with the 1950s, when President Dwight Eisenhower used the

shock of the Soviet Union’s satellite launch to galvanize US investment in education, 
infrastructure, and new technologies. Can America do the same now? 
China is growing in strength but also has signiﬁcant weaknesses, while the US 
has important long-term power advantages. Start with geography. Whereas the US 
is surrounded by oceans and friendly neighbors, China has territorial disputes with 
India, Japan, and Vietnam. Likewise US advantage. America is now a net energy 
exporter, while China depends on oil imports transported across the Indian Ocean— 
where the US maintains a signiﬁcant naval presence. 
Furthermore, the US wields ﬁnancial power as a result of its global institutions and 
the dollar’s international hegemony. While China aspires to a larger global ﬁnancial 
role, a credible reserve currency depends on currency convertibility, deep capital 
markets, honest government, and the rule of law—all of which China lacks. The 
US has demographic advantages, too: Its workforce is increasing, while China’s has 
begun to decline. 
America has also been at the forefront of key technologies, and US research 
universities dominate global higher-education rankings. At the same time, China is 
investing heavily in research and development, now competes well in some ﬁelds, and 
aims to be the global leader in artiﬁcial intelligence by 2030. Given the importance 
of machine learning as a general-purpose technology, China’s advances in AI are 
particularly signiﬁcant. 
Moreover, Chinese technological progress is no longer based solely on imita-
tion. While the Trump administration correctly punished China’s theft and coercive 
transfer of intellectual property, and unfair trade practices, a successful US response 
to China’s technological challenge will depend more on improvements at home than 
on external sanctions. 
As China, India, and other emerging economies continue to grow, America’s share 
of the world economy will remain below its level of about 30% at the beginning of this 
century. In addition, the rise of other powers will make it more difﬁcult to organize 
collective action to promote global public goods. Nonetheless, no country—China 
included—is about to displace the US in terms of overall power resources in the next 
few decades. 
Rapid Asian economic growth has encouraged a horizontal power shift to the 
region, but Asia has its own internal balance of power. China’s strength is balanced 
by Japan, India, and Australia, among others, with the US playing a crucial role. If 
America maintains its alliances, China will have slim prospects of driving it from 
the Western Paciﬁc, much less dominating the world. 
But competing with China is only half the problem facing Biden. As the American 
technology expert Richard Danzig argues, “Twenty-ﬁrst-century technologies are 
global not just in their distribution, but also in their consequences. Pathogens, AI 
systems, computer viruses, and radiation that others may accidentally release could 
become as much our problem as theirs.” For that reason, Danzig argues, “Agreed 
reporting systems, shared controls, common contingency plans, norms, and treaties 
must be pursued as means of moderating our numerous mutual risks.” 
In some areas, unilateral American leadership can provide a large part of the 
answer to the problem of providing public goods. For example, the US Navy is

vital to policing the law of the sea and defending freedom of navigation in the 
South China Sea. But when it comes to new transnational issues like climate change 
and pandemics, success will require the cooperation of others. While American 
leadership will be important, the US cannot solve these problems by acting alone, 
because greenhouse gases and viruses do not respect borders or respond to military 
force. 
In the domain of ecological interdependence, power becomes a positive-sum 
game. America thus cannot simply think in terms of its power over others, but 
must also consider its power with others. On many transnational issues, empow-
ering others can help America to achieve its own goals; the US beneﬁts if China 
improves its energy efﬁciency and emits less carbon dioxide. America thus has to 
cooperate with China while also competing with it. 
Some worry that China will link cooperation on tackling climate change to US 
concessions in traditional areas of competition, but this ignores how much China has 
to lose if Himalayan glaciers melt or Shanghai is ﬂooded. It was notable that Chinese 
President Xi Jinping participated in Biden’s recent global climate conference despite 
bilateral tensions over US human rights criticisms of China. 
A key question when gauging the success of Biden’s China policy will be whether 
the two powers can cooperate in producing global public goods, while competing 
strongly in other areas. The US-China relationship is a “cooperative rivalry,” in which 
the terms of competition will require equal attention to both sides of the oxymoron. 
That will not be easy.

Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power1 
The ongoing great-power competition between the United States and China, the 
world’s two largest economies, is predominantly viewed through the lens of balance 
of power. In this April 28, 2021 dialogue with Dr. Huiyao Wang, Professor Nye 
explore topics including the role and inﬂuence of soft power in foreign policy, the 
rise of nationalism in both countries, economic and social co-existence and inter-
dependence, as well as cooperation on important global issues such as climate and 
trade. 
Joseph S. Nye, Jr. is University Distinguished Service Professor and Former 
Dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and coiner of 
the concept of “soft power.”. 
Dr. Huiyao Wang is Founder and President of Center for China and Globalization 
(CCG), a think tank ranked among top 100 think tanks in the world. He is currently 
a Steering Committee Member of Paris Peace Forum.

with Wolfgang Ischinger, John Thornton, and some other well-known international 
scholars. And, tonight, we are with Joseph Nye. Professor Nye is University Distin-
guished Service Professor and also Former Dean of Harvard Kennedy School of 
Government. 
He received his bachelor’s degree from Princeton University and won the Rhodes 
Scholar scholarship from Oxford University and attained his Ph.D. in Political 
Science from Harvard University. He has worked in three city government agencies 
and has had a very impressive career. From 1977 to 1979, Joseph served as a deputy 
to the Undersecretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology 
and chaired the National Security Council Group on non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. For recognition of his service, he received the highest of the Department 
of State commendation, the Distinguished Honour Award, and in 1993 and 1994, he 
was the chair of the National Intelligence Council, which coordinates intelligence 
estimation for the president. He was awarded to the Intelligence Community Distin-
guished Service Medal. In 1994 and 1995, he served as the Assistant Secretary of 
Defence for International Security Affairs, where he won the Distinguished Service 
Medal. Joseph is very famous for his academic career. I remember when I was at 
Harvard Kennedy School about 11 or 12 years ago, you were so kind to accept our 
interview and you wrote a preface for a book of ours, which I really appreciate. And 
Joseph is a fellow at the American Academy of Arts and Science of the American 
Academy of Diplomacy and of the British Academy. In a recent survey of the Inter-
national Relations Scholars, Professor Nye was ranked as the most inﬂuential scholar 
on American foreign policy, and also in 2011, Foreign Policy named him one of the 
top 100 global thinkers. Professor Nye, today, we are really pleased to have you and 
perhaps you can say a few words to our online audience in China and elsewhere. 
Joseph Nye: Well, it is a pleasure to be with you and to visit the Centre for China and 
Globalization, even if it is only virtually. I look forward to the day when we can once 
again greet each other personally. But I think the topic of how power is changing in 
the world and how that is going to affect the relations between the United States and 
China is one of the absolute central topics of our century. 
In the last chapter of a recent book that I published, Do Morals Matter?, I say that 
there are two great-power shifts going on in this century. One is a power shift from 
west to east, which means from basically Europe and the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc and 
Asia. If you think about the world in, let us say in 1800, Asia was half of the world’s 
population and half of the world’s economy. By 1900, Asia is still half the world’s 
population, but only 20 percent of the world’s economy and that was because of the 
industrial revolution in Europe and North America. 
What we are seeing in this century is a return to normality—normal proportions. 
And it is a long process, but I think it is an extraordinarily important power shift. 
Many people see this as the rise of China and certainly China has been central to it, 
but also, it starts really with the rise of Japan after the Meiji Restoration and it will 
continue also with the rise of India. 
So, China is big part of Asia, but Asia is a broader concept. So how do we 
manage that power transition from the West to East in a way which is beneﬁcial

Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
187
for all countries and which does not break down into great-power rivalries, which 
are destructive. That is one of the great-power shifts. The other great-power shift 
is what I would call vertical rather than horizontal. And that is the power shifts 
from governments to non-governmental and transnational actors. And this is driven 
by technology and by changes in in ecological globalization, things like pandemics 
and climate change, which do not respect boundaries and which no government can 
control working alone, but has to, in fact, control by working with other governments. 
And that is why in my book, I talk about the fact that the ﬁrst type of power shift, the 
one that I would call horizontal, is one that can lead to power “over,” “competitive 
power,” in which we think in traditional terms—power over other countries. But when 
you look at this other power shift, the vertical one from governments to transnational 
requires a different form of power, called “power with” rather than “power over,” 
because no country can solve those problems alone. So, if you take climate change, 
for example, China cannot solve climate change by itself. The United States cannot 
solve it by itself. Europe cannot solve it. It is going to have to be cooperative. And 
yet it is tremendously important for each of us. If the Himalayan glaciers melt, that 
is going to destroy agriculture in China. If the sea levels rise, that is going to put 
much of Florida underwater. But neither of us can deal with that acting alone. 
We have to work with each other. And that is the importance of “power with.” 
So, what I argue in the book is that these two power shifts lead to emphasis on two 
different types of power, power “over” others and power “with” others. If we are 
going to have to learn to live in a world where we manage both simultaneously, that 
is not easy. People always like things to be simple. It is either one or the other. In 
fact, it is going to be both. 
Huiyao Wang: Thank you, Joseph. I think you illustrate this power shift very well, 
both from horizontal power “over” to vertical power “with.” Absolutely, you are 
the authority on power narratives, particularly soft power. You have published 18 
books and hundreds of articles. You are also a familiar name in China, known as 
the father of soft power. As a matter of fact, your 1990 book, Bound to Lead the 
Changing Nature of American Power, was published in China in 1992 and China 
CITIC Publishing House has published other books of yours including Soft Power: 
The Means to Succeed in World Politics in 2015. Your most recent book Do Morals 
Matter? Presidents and Foreign Policy from FDR to Trump has also added quite a 
lot of new dimensions and I am sure the CITIC Publishing is looking forward to 
publishing your new book in China. 
You ﬁrst coined the term “soft power” in your 1990 book, which is 30 years ago, 
in Bound to Lead that challenged the conventional view of the decline of American 
power. America actually is still a very powerful country. So how do you see American 
soft power since then and what can we learn? For example, America has the best 
universities that attract talent from all over the world. Also, following the Trump 
administration, how do you see the gains and losses of American soft power, the 
term you have invented? 
Joseph Nye: Well, soft power is the ability to inﬂuence others through attraction 
rather than coercion or payment. I ﬁrst developed this idea back in, as you said, in

188
Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
1989 and 1990 when there was a widespread belief at the time that America was in 
decline and I thought that was incorrect. But after I totaled up the usual resources 
of military power and economic power and so forth, I said, you know, there is still 
something missing, which is the ability to attract, and that is why I developed this 
concept of soft power. Now, if you look back over the years, American soft power 
goes up and down over time. In the last four years under President Trump, we have 
seen a considerable loss of American soft power. Trump’s populist nationalism and 
his attitudes in general made America less attractive. And I think that the last four 
years have been bad years for American soft power. You can measure that by looking 
at public opinion polls like the Pew Poll or Gallup Poll and so forth of international 
opinion. 
On the other hand, I think it is likely that American soft power will recover under 
President Biden. He has already reversed some of the things that Trump did, which 
were particularly unpopular, such as the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords 
or withdrawal from the World Health Organization. So those are things that help. 
In addition, his attitudes more generally, I think, are less nativist, nationalist, and 
therefore will make the United States more attractive to other countries. 
But does it indicate American decline? No, I mean, the interesting thing to me is 
that there are always beliefs that America is in decline. It comes in cycles. And what 
they miss is the ability of the Americans to be resilient, to regenerate themselves. Take 
the 1960s, the United States was extremely unpopular around the world because of 
the Vietnam War. But by the 1970s and 80 s, American soft power had been restored. 
So, in that sense, while we have had a bad four years under Trump, I do not regard 
that as a sign of American decline. I think it is more typical of the cycles that we 
have gone through in the past, and I expect it will probably recover from this one, as 
we have from others in the past. 
Huiyao Wang: Great insights. We know that the world has really changed quite a lot 
compared to the 90 s, the end of last century. During the ﬁrst 20 years of this century, 
we saw globalization expanding rapidly and MNCs operating more worldwide. There 
is somehow an idea that although they have operated worldwide, they probably have 
not really beneﬁted their home country or their host country enough, for example, 
in the US, the gap between rich and poor is widening, not to mention we saw the 
generation of a lot of populism and nationalism. 
What do you think about this kind of deglobalization, which damages soft power, 
not only for the US, but for other countries as well—have we seen setbacks for 
soft power? As you explained, when people have enough hard power, they look for 
attraction, wanting to be more attractive, and soft power adds more value to that, but 
now having the world getting harder and harder in terms of infrastructure, the soft 
agenda part is disappearing a little bit. So how will we address that? 
Joseph Nye: Well, I think you are right that one of the things that globalization has 
done is to produce challenges to different groups within domestic society and that 
has stimulated populism and nationalistic reactions. So if you are a factory worker 
in, let us say, the middle of the United States, and you lose your job because the job 
is going to China or to Vietnam, you are not likely to be in favor of globalization

Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
189
and you will react against this and that many of those people wound up being voters 
for President Trump. And then again, I think you could argue that this increased the 
inequalities that while some people beneﬁted from globalization, others did not, and 
that rising inequality is another tension on the political system. So a country’s soft 
power depends not just on the words that it says, but on the deeds that it does and 
the way that it practices its own values at home. 
In that sense, I think that what we have seen is a globalization that has produced 
a degree of populist reaction, which has produced a polarization in politics, which 
has undercut the attractiveness of the soft power of the United States. And I think 
that is a real factor. I think what one of the things that President Biden is doing is 
focusing on his domestic agenda to try to cure many of those aspects. I think that he is 
headed in the right direction for that, but I think it is deﬁnitely true that globalization 
produces a reaction and the reaction can, in fact, undercut soft power. It does not that 
mean soft power is less important, but it does mean that it is hard to maintain under 
conditions like that. 
What you see when you have disruptive social change is a tendency to populism 
and nationalism. And you see this in many countries and nationalism is attractive to 
people inside the country. But almost by deﬁnition, since it sets a country apart in 
an antagonistic role, it is not attractive to others. So, I mean, this is this is a problem 
for the United States. It is a problem for China, too. If you take the so-called Wolf 
Warrior for your diplomacy, that is very popular inside China as part of a response 
to Chinese nationalism. It is not very popular to other countries. 
Huiyao Wang: I think that your invention of the term “soft power” is something 
that will probably go down in history as something to make the world more friendly, 
more charming and more attractive. Countries pay attention to their soft power. I 
also liked your comments in an article you did for the Wall Street Journal in 2005 on 
the rise of Chinese soft power, citing Yao Ming, the ﬁlm “Crouching Tiger, Hidden 
Dragon,” and the summer Olympics. But another part of soft power is the Chinese 
students studying in the United States and we hope that more American students 
can study in China. There is also outbound tourism, about 100 million before the 
pandemic. China has a 5000-year history with Confucianism and other concepts. 
There are also other concepts like President Xi’s “green mountain, gold mountain” 
concept in terms of environmental. Also, we can see how Chinese “collectivism” is 
helping China ﬁght the pandemic. So how do you view Chinese soft power and what 
can be done to improve it or maybe what could be added? 
Joseph Nye: Chinese soft power has many sources. One, of course, is Chinese tradi-
tional culture, which is very attractive. Indeed, the very idea of soft power can be 
traced back to great Chinese thinkers, like Lao Zi. I may appoint the words “soft 
power,” but the concept of getting inﬂuence of others by attraction is an ancient 
Chinese philosophy. So Chinese traditional culture is a source of soft power for 
China. Another major source of soft power for China is China’s remarkable economic 
performance. China has raised hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the 
last 40 years. This is widely admired and it provides attraction and inﬂuence for 
China.

190
Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
I think if there are sources for China’s soft power, I think there are also problems. 
One is when you have conﬂict with your neighbors. For example, as China has with 
many countries related to the South China Sea, or you have the problem, let us say, 
about the borders with India. That makes it hard to generate soft power in those 
countries. You can set up a Confucius Institute in New Deli to teach Chinese culture, 
but you are not going to attract Indians if Chinese soldiers are killing Indian soldiers 
on the Himalayan border. So, one problem for Chinese soft power is the existence of 
these territorial conﬂicts with a number of neighbors. Another limit on China’s soft 
power the insistence on tight control of civil society. A great deal of a country’s soft 
power is produced, not by its government, but by its civil society. And that makes 
the country more attractive more resilient. If the Party insists on clamping down 
on everything in civil society, that makes it less ﬂexible, less attractive. So if you 
have a creative genius who is produced by Chinese civil society, the best thing to do 
is to celebrate that, not to control it. We saw this just this week with Chloe Zhao, 
the Chinese ﬁlm director who won the Oscar for the best director—that should be 
celebrated in China and not censored. 
Huiyao Wang: Actually, I think there are different interpretations on that. China has 
1.4 billion people, and the standards and the measure of soft power is therefore a 
gradual process. I would say probably, for example, that given the 5,000-year history 
and its collective society, maybe people are willing to sacriﬁce a little individual 
freedom for the sake of community, which is working very well in ﬁghting COVID-
19 in China. What happened in India is very tragic in these days, but in China, 
basically, you can go everywhere, there is no more COVID-19 cases now. I think 
some of those things are also a changing dynamic. There is always one room to 
improve, absolutely. But I think given a country as big as China where everything is 
experimenting forward, we probably need to take on a lot of different perspectives 
and I agree with you. With the 5,000-year history and culture, how to really stimulate 
the individual innovative spirit is a constant subject for China to master more. So this 
is really great to ﬁnd out what are the things we can do better, and whether Americans 
can do better. And course, we can learn from each other. 
In your recent book, Do Morals Matter? which was just published last year, you 
provide an analysis of the role of ethics in US foreign policy in America after 1945 
from President Roosevelt to President Trump. As we are facing a more complex 
world, what do you think about President Biden as he is about to reach 100 days in 
ofﬁce? Having just analyzed the 14 presidents before him, what do you think about 
President Biden? 
Joseph Nye: Now, I would say that Biden is still much soon to judge him histori-
cally, because we only have seen three months of his presidency. But in the three 
months, the hundred days, he seems to be doing pretty well. President Trump took a 
position of being divisive for political support. His popularity in the American public 
never reached above 50%. President Biden has taking a different approach, trying 
to appeal more broadly. His popularity is somewhere measured around 57%. That is 
an indication of the different style of leadership between Trump and Biden. I think

Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
191
that is a good sign for a promising future. But as I said, it is much too early to judge 
at this stage. 
Huiyao Wang: But do you think that President Biden and President Xi, who both 
attended the global summit on climate change, with the world facing pandemic and 
climate change, do they demonstrate some kind of moral relationship? I think that if 
China and the US can work together on ﬁghting the pandemic, we would probably 
have a much more organized world. I think that kind of moral leadership, for both 
President Biden and President Xi, is really important. 
Joseph Nye: Exactly right. I have argued that we have to think of the US-China 
relationship in terms of what I call a cooperative rivalry. There will be areas of rivalry, 
for example, different views on the navigation of the South China Sea, that will be an 
area of traditional rivalry. But when it comes to ecological interdependence, which is 
illustrated by climate change, or by the pandemic. Viruses do not respect nationality, 
they just wanted to reproduce themselves, so they cross borders without any respects 
to what government say or politics. The same thing is true with greenhouse gases. 
In that sense, we have to be able to realize ecological interdependence, which is a 
form of globalization, is one where it is going to require cooperation. There will be 
a rivalry in certain areas. There has to be cooperation at the same time. I was very 
pleased to see this virtual climate summit last week to speak to see the President 
Xi, President Biden, President Putin, and others, because it really is essential that 
we overcome the rivalries in the areas where we must cooperate, because there is no 
alternative to cooperation. 
Huiyao Wang: You actually said that in the past, the development of soft power may 
not be a zero-sum game. So, if we have established a cooperative rivalry, but we need 
to decide areas in which we can compete and areas in which we can cooperate to 
become the norm of the time. We try to ﬁnd attractive parts of each other. We can see 
China and the United States, partly converging in terms of ﬁghting pandemic and in 
terms of climate change, but also partly there are conﬂicts, as you mentioned. So, the 
soft power probably can reinforce each other, if we can ﬁnd the soft spots and really 
press on that, that would be really great for China and the US to manage conﬂict. 
Do you think that both the US and China can gain soft power from cooperating? 
Are there more areas in which we can collaborate? For example, President Biden 
announced the proposal of a 2.3 trillion USD plan on infrastructure. You probably 
know China in the past four decades has built a superinfrastructure—we have 2/3 
of the global high-speed train networks now and out of the ten largest container 
ports, seven of them are in China and also the longest bridges. And so, can we work 
on that? The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is one of the good examples of 
China working with European countries, except the US and Japan now. Maybe we 
could upgrade that to a world infrastructure bank so that we can help developing 
countries. And maybe the US, China, and others can cooperate with more of each 
other’s interests. I remember last time during a panel in Boao Forum for Asia we 
were in, you talked about China and US setting up a COVID-19 global ﬁghting fund?

Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
What do you think about those areas that can increase our soft power and can help 
us collaborate even more? 
Joseph Nye: I think that is correct. Soft power does not have to be zero-sum. If, 
for example, China becomes more attractive to the United States, and the United 
States becomes more attractive to China—that can help both of us to overcome our 
differences. Some years ago, I remember co-authoring an article with a distinguished 
Chinese scholar, Wang Jisi from Peking University. We pointed out in that article that 
soft power can be positive sum in which both sides can beneﬁt simultaneously—not 
always but in some instances. And that is why it is important for the US and China 
to ﬁnd areas where they can cooperate, because we both look more attractive in the 
eyes of other countries, if we do so. Most countries do not want to have to choose 
in a harsh way between China and the US. To that extent, when we are cooperating, 
particularly on the production of global public goods—as you can imagine, that 
increases China’s soft power and increases American soft power at the same time. 
At Boao, I did mention the idea that the US and China could work together on this 
whole idea of strengthening the health systems of poorer countries, including their 
vaccine capabilities, which would be good for us as well as good for them, and which 
would also enhance the soft power of both our countries. 
Huiyao Wang: China and the US are the two largest economies in the world. Also, 
the US has been building this postwar global governance system and China has 
actually beneﬁted from this system, and also is trying to add on, trying to be more 
active on that. There are enormous areas to work together. I notice that you do not 
really like this metaphor of the Thucydides Trap that the rising power challenges the 
ruling power, you said that either there is a challenge part of it or there is also a fear 
part of it, but we should not over emphasize that. So that is a really interesting thing, 
which maybe you can elaborate on. That is really interesting because we do not want 
to get into a kind of deadly confrontation. Because after all, we are so interdependent 
now. 
Joseph Nye: I think that is right. I think there is some validity that a rising power 
can create fear in established power and that can be a source of conﬂict, but it does 
not have to be. Even thinking back to the Peloponnesian War, which Thucydides 
described. He said the causes of the war was the rise of the power of Athens and fear 
it created in Sparta. We can control the amount of fear. If we become too obsessive 
about our fear of each other, we fall into the Thucydides Trap. 
My own view is that we do not have to succumb. Basically, as I see it, China does 
not pose an existential threat to the existence of United States and the United States 
does not pose an existential threat to China. We are not trying to take over China. So, 
in that sense, we will compete, but we should limit the fears. It is not as though it is 
life-or-death fear. In that sense, going back to Thucydides, the rise in the power of 
China is something which is likely to continue. There is not much we can do about 
that, only China will do something about it, which is how it behaves domestically. 
But the fear that creates in the United States is something we can do something about 
which is to not overexaggerate China, not to become overly fearful.

Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
193
Competition is healthy, frankly. The idea that the Americans will improve some 
things at home, such as infrastructure, because China is leading the way. Let us 
say, on high-speed rail, that can be healthy. But if it becomes fearful or obsessively 
fearful, it can become destructive. 
So, my view is that we should be careful of the language we use. I do not like this 
language some people are using about a new Cold War between the United States and 
China. I think that is a misreading of history. It implies a deeper and more intractable 
conﬂict than really the case. If you look back to the real Cold War between the 
United States and the Soviet Union, there is almost no economic interdependence, 
whereas with US and China, you ﬁnd just the opposite—half a trillion dollars of 
trade. If you look back on the real Cold War, there was no social interdependence, 
whereas today more than three million Chinese come to the United States as tourists 
and three hundred thousand students. So, you have much greater economic interde-
pendence, social interdependence and the new aspects that I mentioned, ecological 
interdependence. During the Cold War, we were less worried about climate change 
or pandemics. And so, there are reasons for why these increases in globalization and 
interdependence make us or urge us to be careful about not using metaphors like 
the Cold War, which were true for a time of history, but not necessarily accurate 
descriptions of the current period of history. 
Huiyao Wang: Yes, thank you. Absolutely. Well, you are great promoter of peace. 
The term of Cold War is really obsolete, we have economic dependence, we have 
social dependence, we have ecological dependence, and we have technology depen-
dence as well. And so, it does not really make sense to decouple or to really to 
confront. I remember last time when you were in China, I went to see you and you 
talked about cooperative rivalry as well. How can we do better on that? I mean, we 
see that in the US Congress, some keep putting out all kinds of reports depicting that 
a Cold War is happening. You have been in the Department of Defence to advise on 
all those security issues and you have been teaching power and the geopolitics of the 
world for your lifetime. So how can we do better to have a cooperative relationship? 
Joseph Nye: Well, one thing is to strengthen the ties that we have. I mean, the students, 
the visitors, and the communication, these are important aspects of what I call social 
interdependence, which help develop deeper understanding between the societies. 
And that is important. The other is on the economic interdependence. There will be 
some areas where there will be decoupling—areas that touch on high security. 
For example, Americans are very worried about Huawei or ZTE controlling 5G 
telecommunications in the US for security reasons. I do not think you can see more 
economic interdependence there, just as China has not wanted to allow Google or 
Facebook to operate freely inside China because of security reasons, so there will 
be some areas where they will be decoupling. But that does not mean we want to 
see overall economic decoupling, which would be extraordinarily costly for both 
countries. 
And then ﬁnally, we have this question of how do we manage the relationship 
overall so that we avoid miscalculations or accidents. You know, people who talk 
about 1945 and the Cold War are picking the wrong date for historical analogy. As

194
Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
Henry Kissinger points out, 1914 is something we should pay more attention to. All 
the great powers in Europe at the time did not want World War I. They expected 
in their competition in the Balkans to have a short, sharp conﬂict which would 
redress the balance of power and things would go back to normal. Instead, through 
miscalculations and failure to manage their relationship to manage the competitive 
parts of the relationship, they wound up with four years of war, which destroyed four 
empires and destroyed the centrality of Europe in the global balance of power. We 
have to be extremely cautious and careful that we do not allow some incident in the 
South China Sea or over Taiwan or something to lead us into something which nobody 
intends with great unintended consequences. And that is going to require constant 
communication, so we need to enhance our cooperation in areas of interdependence 
where it is possible to cooperate. But in the areas in which are competitive. We have 
to be much more cautious and attentive in how we communicate to each other to make 
sure that we do not have miscalculations. Those are the two things I think we have 
to do to avoid this relationship becoming a zero-sum game. I think, as I mentioned 
earlier, I remain relatively optimistic about the long run. But humans make mistakes. 
That is the nature of being a human and so we have to guard against those mistakes. 
Huiyao Wang: Absolutely, I think you are right on communication and also to avoid 
misunderstanding. And it is also important to promote mutual understanding and 
avoid those kinds of mistakes as disasters happen. I remember well, you said a new 
Cold War is not possible and there are several factors, too. I mean, Americans should 
not be worried about China because, you know, geographically the US is so far with 
friendly neighbors, like Canada, and Mexico. But also the US is already self-sufﬁcient 
on energy now and China still needs a lot of supply. The US has many things that 
are still leading. So the concerns on China should really be less so, I suppose. I think 
China has a lot more people interested in learning from the US. We have 400,000 
students studying in the United States, as you said, and three million tourists going 
there, too. China is also now one of the largest trading nations with over almost 100 
countries now so hopefully the beneﬁts produced by both sides, can really cut down 
the mistrust, so how can we build up some more trust? I mean, it is very valuable to 
hear your sober mind at this critical time. As we approach 100 days with President 
Biden in ofﬁce, how we can really shape a little different perspective for the future 
of the US-China relations? 
Joseph Nye: One of the things that both of us have to worry about is the rise of 
nationalism in our two countries. I mentioned earlier that the effect of globalization 
on creating inequality and disrupting jobs and so forth led to more populist and nativist 
nationalism in the United States and that produced voters for President Trump. But let 
us be frank, there is also rising nationalism in China. If you look at the Chinese web, 
you will notice enormous nationalism. And there is the feeling in China that, you 
know, there is still this argument about overcoming the nineteenth-century history 
and as a form of recruiting support when you do things like “wolf warrior” diplomacy, 
that is very popular inside China. But those things are not healthy in terms of creating 
trust in other countries.

Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
195
So it is interesting to take, for example, the program China 2025, about tech-
nologies that made sense inside China—it created fear in Washington—the fact that 
China was going to try to replace the United States in a whole series of important 
technologies created fear in Washington or when President Xi Jinping said that China 
would be number one in artiﬁcial intelligence by 2030, that was read in Washington 
as well that China intends to replace the United States by 2030, so it might have 
been a good goal in terms of recruiting national support inside China. But there is 
always, for every political leader, is what is called the two-audience problem. One 
audience is internal, the other audience is external, and sometimes the messages that 
play well internally and played badly externally, I think on both of our sides, given 
the rise in nationalism that is produced to some extent by globalization, the reaction 
to globalization, we have to be careful about the two-audience problem. 
Huiyao Wang: You are absolutely correct. I think that, you know, if it is a peaceful 
competition, maybe let us handle a bit more on the domestic side. You know, China is 
trying to avoid that kind of populism. But the same is true for the United States. And 
we really need to make the internal narrative and international narrative combined. 
And for example, in America there is also the gap between rich and poor that is 
widening and also, there is racial differences. In the last several decades, China has 
been careful about minimizing the gap a bit, even though the rural and urban still 
have a lot of differences. But with this, China had been trying to lift 800 million 
people out of extreme poverty, so that poverty does not generate so much populism 
and dissatisfaction with the globalization or the opening up of China. So I think that 
lessons can be learned for both countries on that as well. 
And the problem is how we can really get multinationals and all those big players to 
work on things together. They need more non-government, non-proﬁt organizations 
to enable them to work together for an inclusive and balanced globalization, particular 
in developing countries. 
Now with things happening with COVID in developing countries, it is absolutely 
important that the US and China work together. Last weekend, we celebrated the 
50th anniversary of the ping pong democracy. The slogan then was, “friendship ﬁrst, 
competition second.” That was very meaningful one. As a veteran professor like 
you, who has been seeing all the ups and downs, what is your take on the future of 
Sino-US relations? I have noticed you have given quite a few scenarios for the future. 
Joseph Nye: One could imagine a variety of scenarios any time as you try to guess the 
future. You have to realize that there is no one future. There are many possible futures 
and they are affected by events that we do not know about. They are unexpected. 
And they are affected also by our own actions and how we choose what behaviors 
we are going to follow. So one can imagine the futures of US-China relations, which 
are bad or good. But we have to say what are the things they can do. They can steer 
themselves more toward the good relations which are beneﬁcial to both. 
It is interesting when you look back historically since 1945, we have gone through 
a series of relationships. In the ﬁrst 20 years or so, things were pretty tough. After 
all, US and Chinese soldiers fought each other on the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s. 
So we had twenty years of tense relationship. Then as you pointed out, we had ping

196
Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
pong diplomacy and the easing of relations. You had the Nixon visit to Beijing, 
and you had another 20 years then of improving relationships. Then, during of the 
Clinton administration, there was the desire of a rising China to integrate China into 
the international order through the World Trade Organization and so forth. Then, 
that lasted nearly 20 years, but you have the period of the arrival of Donald Trump, 
the 2015, 2016, and so forth, with a feeling among many Americans that China 
was not playing fair, that it was subsidizing state-owned enterprises and stealing 
intellectual property and militarizing islands in the South China Sea that President 
Xi had promised President Obama he would not do. And there was a reaction against 
it so we started another cycle. 
So we have gone through ups and downs roughly on twenty years. If you use 
that same 20 years Cycle, we are in the middle. You know, it starts around 2015 and 
2025 is 10 years, I hope it does not have to last that long, but it is quite possible that 
we will have intense competition for 20 years. My own personal view is, as I said 
earlier, that I do not think China is an existential threat or a threat to the existence of 
the United States or that the United States is a threat to the existence of China. So in 
that sense, I think that you could imagine some period—who knows? Maybe we are 
talking about 2035 where you will see the cycle turn toward better relations, maybe 
with beneﬁt, have it sooner than that. 
But again, as any time you predict the future, you have to realize that history is 
always full of surprises, and that every time you think you know something, there is 
going to be something which you have not taken into account. So that makes it all 
the more important that we try to use our own actions cautiously so that we do not 
get the wrong sorts of surprises. 
Huiyao Wang: I absolutely agree with you, China is not a threat to the United States 
and hopefully the US is not a threat to China as well. I mean, the US has already had 
so much abundance around its country and is very rich in all kinds of resources and it 
is geographically so far away from China as well. I read one of your Project Syndicate 
articles, in which you talked about ﬁve scenarios of the international order in 2030. 
Number one is that maybe the liberal international order is coming to an end because 
of populism and other political forces. And as you mentioned, the second scenario is 
massive unemployment, economic depression, and also politicians taking advantage 
of that to push populist protectionism. Number three, you talked about how China 
may also be more active on the international arena or dominating the global order. 
The GDP of China might get bigger compared to that of the United States and maybe 
multinational actors will be interested in China. And you also talked about the global 
green agenda, such as climate change and a “Covid Marshall Plan.” Finally, you 
talked about similarities and co-existence of countries. We talked about China and 
the US, let us talk about the globe now. You are such a great predictor, and we had 
love to see your crystal ball for the global future. 
Joseph Nye: I do think that you are going to see the increased importance of the 
green agenda simply because this is something which obeys the laws of physics and 
biology, not politics. And as more and more people and countries become aware of 
the importance of climate change and the dangers of things like pandemics, I think

Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
197
that is going to put pressure on political leaders to take these issues more seriously 
than they have in the past. But it is not going to totally replace traditional politics 
and traditional competition by any means. But it will become increasingly important. 
And that means that the cooperative dimensions are going to have to increase. 
Now, the world’s the political leaders could still make mistakes and fail to see this 
or react to it. But I do think that it is a source of potential optimism that this agenda is 
going to be increasing because of physics and biology. So, I think that of the various 
scenarios that I sketched out for the world in that Project Syndicate column, I saw 
the gradual evolution of the world as we see it now was the most likely, but I put 
more emphasis on the green agenda than I would have before COVID, and so as I 
said, I remain relatively optimistic that we can pull through this period. 
Huiyao Wang: You are cautiously optimistic because we are absolutely dependent 
on each other. So maybe one other question we can talk about is that now another 
Professor Burns is rumored to be the next US Ambassador to China. So, what do you 
think about the new ambassador? He has worked in US government before, maybe 
those high-level exchanges can really promote the relationship with China. You have 
been working with him at Aspen as well, he is a great friend of yours. What do you 
think about that (Burns becoming the US Ambassador to China)? 
Joseph Nye: Well, I think Nick Burns is an extraordinarily skillful professional 
diplomat, but it is also true that all we have now is a rumor and in the American 
political process of appointing ambassadors, you have to get approval of the White 
House, and then you have to get approval of the Senate. And we are a long way 
from any certainty about whether he will be the ambassador. But I think the fact that 
the Biden administration is at least considering somebody who is one of our most 
skillful professional diplomats to assign to Beijing, it is a good sign. It means that 
we are taking the relationship seriously. This ambassador as he should be, just like 
the Chinese ambassador in Washington, has to be tough. That is his job. But he also 
has to be business-like and professional and look for areas of cooperation. So, I think 
those are characteristics that Nick Burns has as a person. But as I said, this is all 
premature because really nothing has been announced formally. However, if it does 
come out, I would regard it as a good sign. 
Huiyao Wang: Great. So now we have some questions from media. China Radio 
International asks, if you are supposed to tell young people of this era about three 
major events, except for the two world wars, that changed the world during the past 
100 years, what would be your choice? 
Joseph Nye: Events, by their deﬁnition, are always full of surprise. There was a 
British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, who was asked a question about what is 
going to happen in British foreign policy next year given this trend or that trend. And 
he said, the trouble, my dear boy, is events. And so you never know how the events 
are going to turn out. I mean, who would have predicted COVID in 1919, yet that 
had a profound effect on all our economies in the world economy. So I think in that 
sense, it is hard to know what events happen. What worries me are miscalculations 
and in which people think if I push a little harder there, I will get what I want. And

198
Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
if there is push back and before you know it, people are getting further along than 
they want to be in their attentions. So I worry about events that by deﬁnition cannot 
be properly described or spelled out now, but that could be taking us by surprise. 
Huiyao Wang: And we have another question from the Hoxing News—after the 
outbreak of the pandemic, especially Trump took ofﬁce, the growing nationalism 
both in China and the United States has led to the exaggeration of the sense of 
threat between these two countries. As you mentioned, power can be divided into 
two types: power “over” others and power “with” others. The recent communication 
between China and the United States on climate issues shows the importance of 
rivalry cooperative. In your opinion, how can the concept of power with others be 
more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people? 
Joseph Nye: Well, I think I would go back to something I said earlier—building on 
the interdependence we have, both economic and social, is one way for people to 
understand each other’s societies and to thereby somewhat reduce suspicion. Personal 
contacts do not automatically produce friendships, but in fact, interpersonal contacts 
do help to increase understanding or empathy toward the other. And so that is one 
thing we can do. The other thing we can do is when there are areas where we can 
cooperate, such as issues related to pandemics or climate change, we should deﬁnitely 
pursue those. And I think we are making some progress in that direction. 
Huiyao Wang: Well, we have another question from People’s Weekly—President Xi 
has proposed the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind. So China 
is actually thinking globally and President Xi has mentioned China’s global efforts 
in Devos this year as well as in 2017. So how can how can the world leaders really 
work together with some common narrative? I mean, climate change is one. And so 
what else? Can we really minimize the differences and maximize the similarities, as 
you also mentioned? 
Joseph Nye: Well, I think the words that President Xi has expressed are welcome, 
but people watch deeds and ask whether words are met with deeds. So if we look 
at whether China is moving in the right direction on climate change, the speech 
President Xi gave the climate summit last week was very welcome. On the other 
hand, when we read the statistics, we noticed that China is continuing to build new 
coal-ﬁred plants and some of these coal-ﬁred plants will last for 30 and 40 years, 
putting out greenhouse gases. So I think people are going to want to ask not just there 
are good words, but are there good deeds? That is true. Not just for China, it is true 
for the US. One of the interesting things is Biden’s words on climate are good. He is 
now trying through executive actions and a program of decarbonizing the economy 
to see whether deeds can follow up those words. So basically, I would say deeds have 
to follow the words. 
Huiyao Wang: So one ﬁnal question from China Review News agency— the Biden 
administration continues to identify China as a “revisionist state” and chief strategic 
competitor. Would the Biden administration be willing to maintain some healthy 
competition with China and collaborate with China? And as you know, Richard

Appendix: Dialogue on US-China Balance of Power
199
Hass of the Council on Foreign Relations proposed that maybe we should abandon 
some of our ideological differences and have six countries or regions—US, China, 
Russia, India, EU, and Japan to form some sort of a consultation mechanism. How 
can we overcome ideological divisions and become strategic competitors? 
Joseph Nye: Well, those are good questions, and we do have mechanisms for coordi-
nation and consultation. We have ﬁve countries in the UN Security Council. We have 
the Group of 20, which is the major economic forces in world politics, and we also 
have the prospects for bilateral consultations. So there are a number of mechanisms 
that we have which can help us to coordinate. We have to make sure though not 
just that we are having mechanisms for this, but that we use them properly. And I 
think I was encouraged by this summit in Washington last week on the climate as an 
illustration that is going to be possible to do that. 
Huiyao Wang: Now, we have over 800,000 online viewers and listeners tuned in to 
our dialogue, the concept of a country’s soft power is really beneﬁcial for all of us. I 
really appreciate that you said China is not a threat and we should really depend on 
each other for the world. We should really not decouple, and we have to cooperate 
together. A Cold War mentality is not really going to work, which we should really 
avoid and the communication is so important—in people’s exchanges and also as to 
increase soft power. So for the ﬁnal conclusion, what would you like to say to such 
large audience today? 
Joseph Nye: Yeah, well, we are all human. We are bound to make mistakes. They 
are bound to be tensions and competitions between Chinese and Americans. But 
we have to keep it in perspective. We have more in common and more to gain from 
cooperation, and we have to keep that perspective. So I think if we have an optimistic 
view about our potential to manage competition and to practice cooperation, I think 
we can look to a good future. 
Huiyao Wang: Great, Professor Nye, thank you so much. We appreciate you taking 
time to have this dialogue with us. We hope to see you next time. We also thank our 
audience in China and the rest of the world.
