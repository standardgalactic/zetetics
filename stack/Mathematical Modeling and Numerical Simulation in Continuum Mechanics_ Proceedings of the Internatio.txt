Preface
The first international symposium on mathematical foundations of the finite
element method was held at the University of Maryland in 1973. During the
last three decades there has been great progress in the theory and practice
of solving partial differential equations, and research has extended in various
directions. Full-scale nonlinear problems have come within the range of nu-
merical simulation. The importance of mathematical modeling and analysis
in science and engineering is steadily increasing. In addition, new possibili-
ties of analysing the reliability of computations have appeared. Many other
developments have occurred: these are only the most noteworthy.
This book is the record of the proceedings of the International Sympo-
sium on Mathematical Modeling and Numerical Simulation in Continuum
Mechanics, held in Yamaguchi, Japan from 29 September to 3 October 2000.
The topics covered by the symposium ranged from solids to fluids, and in-
cluded both mathematical and computational analysis of phenomena and
algorithms. Twenty-one invited talks were delivered at the symposium. This
volume includes almost all of them, and expresses aspects of the progress
mentioned above. All the papers were individually refereed. We hope that
this volume will be a stepping-stone for further developments in this field.
The symposium was supported by many people and organizations. Spe-
cial thanks should go to Professor H. Fujita and Professor H. Hironaka, for
their support and advice in planning this symposium, and also to Professor
Ohtsuka, Professor Tabata and Mr. Hataya, the members of the local organi-
zation committee, for their enthusiastic and continued cooperation. It should
be acknowledged that the symposium was sponsored by the Japan Associa-
tion for Mathematical Sciences, the Inoue Foundation for Science, Mitsui

ciation, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A)-10304012, 11304004, (B)-

and Applied Mathematics, The Japan Society for Computational Enginee-
ring and Science, and the Department of Mathematical Science of Yamaguchi
University, for their support and cooperation.

Abstract. We describe, and we discuss the merits of, a two-dimensional nonlinear
shell model analogous to a model proposed by W .T. Koiter in 1966, where the exact
change of curvature tensor is suitably modified. A first interest of this model, from
the computational viewpoint, is that the resulting stored energy function becomes
a polynomial with respect to the unknown components of the deformation field and
their partial derivatives.
A second interest of this model is its amenability to a formal asymptotic analysis
of its solution, with the thickness as the "small" parameter . Such an analysis yields
exactly the same conclusions as the formal asymptotic analysis of the solution of the
three-dimensional equations, thus providing a justification of the proposed model.

Let ne := wx1- e, s], let xe = (xn denote a generic point in the set ne,
and let of := %xf.Then, for e > 0 small enough, the mapping e :rt -> ]R3

is injective and the three vectors gf(xe ) := ofe(xe ) are linearly independent
at all points xe E ne (see Ciarlet (2000a, Thm. 3.1-1)). The vectors gf(xe )
then form the covariant basis at the point e(xe ) .
Consider then a shell with middle surface S and constant thickness 2e > 0,
i.e., a body whose reference configuration is the set e(n
e
) .
The shell is subjected to a homogeneous boundary condition of place on
the portion e('yo x I-e,cD of its lateral face, where
"Yo is a subset of "Y
satisfying length "Yo > O. This means that the displacement field vanishes on
this portion.
The shell is subjected to applied body forces in its interior e(ne ) and
to applied surface forces on its "upper" and "lower" faces e(w x {e}) and
e(w x {-e}), given by their contravariant components r- E L 2(n e ) and
hi,e E L2(r~ ur:.), i.e., their components over the vectors gf of the covariant
bases. We then define functions pi,e E L 2(w) by letting
pi,e := Je f i,edx3+ hi,e(-,e) + hi,e(-, -c) .
-e
Note that the remaining portion e(('y- "Yo) x [-e,cD of the lateral face of
the shell is free.
Finally, it is assumed that the shell is constituted by a nonlinearly elastic,
homogeneous, and isotropic, material and that its reference configuration is
a natural state. Hence (cf., e.g., Ciarlet (1988, Sect. 3.8)) the behavior of the
constituting material is governed by its two Lame constants >. > 0 and J.L > 0
(that they are> 0 follows from experimental evidence). The functions

denote the contravariant components of the two-dimensional elasticity tensor
of the shell, the form of which can be fully justified by an asymptotic analysis
with the thickness as the "small" parameter (see, e.g., Ciarlet (2000a)).
The unknown in the nonlinear model proposed by Koiter (1966) is the vec-
tor field (e = (([) : w --+ JR3, where the functions (f :w--+ JR are the covari-
ant components, i.e., the components over the vectors a' of the contravariant
bases, of the displacement vector field of the points of the middle surface S:
in other words, the displacement vector of each point O(y) E S, yEw, is the
vector (f(y)ai(y) .
Remark. Koiter's model, as well as the model proposed in Sect. 2, can be
re-formulated in terms of deformation vector fields: This means that the
unknown then becomes the deformation field of the surface S, i.e., the vector
field ¢e :w --+ JR3 defined by
¢e(y) = O(y) +(f(y)ai(y) .
In other words, ¢e(y) is the new position occupied by the point O(y) (( S,
under the influence of the applied forces.
Not only does this re-formulation avoid the introduction of covariant
derivatives, but it also shows that the two-dimensional shell models discussed
here can be equivalently expressed in terms of Cartesian components of the
unknown. Note that the variables in both the "displacement" and the "defor-
mation" approaches are the curvilinear coordinates yo. of the surface S .

Given a sufficiently smooth, but otherwise arbitrary, field 1J = (17i) :w --+ JR3
and its associated displacement field 'TJiai of the surface S, let
ao./3(1J) := ao.(1J) . a/3(1J), where ao.(1J) := 80.(0+ 17iai) ,
denote the covariant components of the metric tensor of the "deformed" sur-
face (0 + 17iai)(W). The functions
then designate the covariant components of the change of metric tensor as-
sociated with the displacement field 'TJiai of S . If, in addition, the two vectors
ao.(1J) are linearly independent at all points yEw, the functions

are well defined in w. They denote the covariant components of the curvature
tensor of the "deformed" surface (0 + 'TJiai)(w). The functions

then designate the covariant components of the change of curvature tensor
associated with the displacement field 'fJiai of S .
Founding his approach on various a priori assumptions, of a geometri-
cal and mechanical nature, Koiter (1966) has proposed the following two-
dimensional minimization problem for modeling the shell problem described
above: The unknown displacement field (iai of the middle surface S should
be such that (" := ((n is a minimizer, or more generally a stationary point,
of the energy jk defined by (see ibid., eqs. (4.2), (8.1), and (8.3)):
jk(T/) := iLacx{3<rTG<rT(T/)Gcx{3(1J)v!ady
+ €: i acx{3<rTR<rT(T/)Rcx{3(1J)v!ady - i pi''''fJiv!ady
for smooth enough fields T/ = ('fJi) satisfying ad hoc boundary conditions on
')'0 ' Note that this model is indeed nonlinear, in that the functional jk is not
a quadratic function of 1J.
However, the functions bcx{3(1J), whence the functions R cx{3(1J), are not
defined at those points of w where the vectors acx(1J) = 8cx(8 + 'fJiai) are
linearly dependent. Hence this minimization problem is not well posed.
Our objective consists in showing, first, how the above model of W.T.
Koiter can be modified so as to avoid this difficulty; then, how the modified
model can be fully justified. The results described here were first announced
in Ciarlet (2000b) and Ciarlet & Roquefort (2000). Full details are found in
Ciarlet (2001) and Ciarlet & Roquefort (2001).

A Two-Dimensional Nonlinear Shell Model
"of Koiter's Type"
The strain energy in Koiter's model (i.e., the part of the expression jk(T/)
that does not involve the applied forces) is exactly the sum of the strain
energy of a nonlinearly elastic "membrane" shell, i.e., the part in jk(T/) with
~ as a factor, and of the strain energy of a nonlinearly elastic ''flexural''
3
shell, i.e., the part in jk(1J) with
"6 as a factor, as they have been recently
identified and justified by Miara (1998) and Lods & Miara (1998) by means of
a formal asymptotic analysis of the appropriately "scaled" three-dimensional
displacement field, with the thickness 2€ as the "small" parameter.
We recall that, in this approach, a nonlinearly elastic shell is deemed
either a "membrane" or a "flexural" one, according to whether a certain
manifold of "inextensional" displacement fields 'fJiai, i.e., that satisfy the re-
lations Gcx{3(1J) = 0 in w, together with ad hoc boundary conditions on ')'0,
either contains only 'fJiai = 0, or contains nonzero displacement fields, in
which case the tangent space at each point of the manifold must also contain

5
nonzero elements (for a discussion about the difficulties inherent to a satis-
factory classification of nonlinearly elastic shells, see Ciarlet (2000a, Sects.
9.1 and 10.2)) .
Remark. Another "membrane" strain energy for a nonlinearly elastic shell
has been identified and justified by Le Dret & Raoult (1996). Using r-
convergence theory, they have established the weak convergence, in an ad hoc
space W1,P(D), of a subsequence of the minimizers of the three-dimensional
energy, appropriately scaled over the fixed domain D = wx] -1,1[, toward a
minimizer of a "limit energy" as the thickness of the shell approaches zero.
The Le Dret-Raoult strain energy appearing in this limit energy is indeed
that of a "membrane" shell, in the sense that it is again only a function of
the change of metric tensor GQ /3('ry). However, this strain energy does not co-
incide with the "membrane" strain energy found via the formal approach by
Miara (1998), save for particular deformations identified by Genevey (1997)
(for further comments about the comparison between these "membrane" the-
ories, see Ciarlet (2000a, Sect. 9.5)).
A likely explanation for this difference may lie in that the formal approach
corresponds to "rigid" nonlinearly elastic materials, while the r-convergence
approach corresponds to "soft" nonlinearly elastic materials. This assertion
remains yet to be mathematically substantiated, however.
0
A careful scrutiny ofthe formal asymptotic approach of Lods & Miara (1998)
reveals that, instead of the expected components R Q/3(TJ) of the "exact"
change of curvature tensor, the components that naturally appear in the
course of the asymptotic analysis are different, though closely related. These
functions, originally denoted
£~II/3(TJ) by Lods & Miara (1998, Lemma 3),
have later been given a remarkably simple expression by Roquefort (2001),
viz.,
"
1
.
R Q/3(TJ) := ..;a8Q/3(() + That) . {al(TJ) 1\ a2(TJ)} - bQ/3
Remarks. (1) Clearly,
R~/3('1J) =
R Q/3(TJ) if the displacement field 'T/iai is
inextensional, since a(TJ) = a in this case. This explains why the strain energy
of a nonlinearly elastic "flexural" shell can be as well expressed in terms of
the functions RQ /3 (TJ), since the energy of such a shell is to be minimized
over a manifold of inextensional displacements. This is also a first indication
that the associated minimization problem could be well posed, since there
is no longer a possibly vanishing denominator in the stored energy function.
Indeed, one can establish the existence of a least one minimizer; cf. Ciarlet
& Coutand (1998).
(2) Interestingly, exactly the same functions
R~/3('1J) are also mentioned
by Koiter (1966, eq. (4.11)), who calls them the covariant components of
a "modified" change of curvature tensor. However, W.T. Koiter does not
provide any hint about the raison d'etre of these functions, which he most
likely found by means of an entirely different approach.

6
Philippe G. Ciarlet
(3) The above considerations suggest that the functions R~I3(1J) could be
aptly called the covariant components of the "modified change of curvature
tensor of Koiter-Lods-Miara-Roquefort".
0
On the basis of the aforementioned observations, Ciarlet (2000b, 2001) has
proposed the following two-dimensional nonlinear shell model "of Koiter's
type" for modeling the same shell problem as in Sect. 1: The unknown dis-
placement field (fai of the middle surface should be such that (e := (f) is a
minimizer, or more generally a stationary point, of the energy f
defined by
over an affine space of sufficiently smooth vector fields TJ (e.g., TJ E W 2,P(w)
for some p > 2) satisfying ad hoc boundary conditions (e.g., the boundary
conditions "of strong clamping" TJ = 0 and 8vTJ = 0 on "Yo, where 8v denotes
the outer normal derivative along "Y; cf. Ciarlet (2000a, Sect. 10.5).
A first interest of this model is that, contrary to Koiter's model described
in Sect. 1, its stored energy junction no longer possesses a possibly vanishing
denominator (viz., va(TJ) , which has been "replaced" by via), so that the
corresponding minimization problem can be posed over an "entire" vector
space.
Its second interest is its (relative) simplicity from a computational view-
point, since its stored energy function is a polynomial (of degree ~ 6) with
respect to the unknown covariant components of the displacement field and
their partial derivatives.
Its third interest is its amenability to a justification, by means of a formal
asymptotic analysis of its solution, described in the next section.

Justification of the Two-Dimensional Shell Model
"of Koiter's Type"
With the same notations as in Sect. 1, we now consider a family of nonlin-
early elastic shells with thickness 2e > 0 approaching zero, with each having
the same middle surface S = 8(w). Each shell is subjected to a homogeneous
boundary condition of place on a portion ebo x [-e,e]) of its lateral face,
i.e., each having the same set 8bo) as its middle curve, where "Yo C "Y and
length "Yo > O. Each shell is subjected to body forces in its interior and to
surface forces on its upper and lower faces, given by their contravariant com-
ponents pi,e E L 2(w). All the shells in the family are made with the same
nonlinearly elastic, homogeneous, and isotropic material, and their reference
configurations are natural states. Hence the material constituting the shells is

characterized by two Lame constants >. > 0 and J.L > 0 that are independent
of e.
Each shell in the family is modeled by the nonlinear shell model of Kotter's
type proposed in Sect. 2. This means that, for each e > 0, the field (E: = ((f) :
W --+ 1R3 , where (E:a' is the displacement field of the middle surface S, is a
stationary point of the energy j'" defined by

the shells.
The problem of finding a stationary point (E: of the energy j'" is first recast
as a set of variational equations posed over the space
W(w) := {1] = (T/i) E W 2,P(w); "1 = 8v 1] = 0 on TO} ,
for some fixed p > O. Then, following a well-established procedure (see, e.g.,
Ciarlet (2000a, Chap. 8)), the unknown and the data are first "scaled", by
letting ((e) :=
(E: and pi(e) := Clpi,E:. It is then assumed that the field
((e) admits a formal asymptotic expansion in terms of the thickness as the
"small" parameter, viz.,
((e) = (0 + e(l + e2(2 + ... , with (0 E W(w) .
Remark. It can be demonstrated that the leading term of this formal asymp-
totic expansion is indeed of order zero; d . Ciarlet & Roquefort (2001, Thm.
3).
0
The main results are that, according to two mutually exclusive sets of as-
sumptions on an associated manifold M(w) of fields 1] = (rli) corresponding
to "inextensional" displacements (i.e., that satisfy aOl(3(1]) - aOl(3 = 0 in w),
the leading term (0 satisfies either the variational problem PM(W) of a non-
linearly elastic "membrane" shell (Theorem 1) or the variational problem
PF(W) of a nonlinearly elastic "flexural" shell (Theorem 2).

Philippe G. Ciarlet
Remark. Naturally, both problems PM(W) and PF(W) should be "de-scaled",
in order to acquire physical significance. In particular, such a de-scaling intro-
duces the expected factors e and e3 in the left-hand sides of their respective
variational equations.

Theorem 1. Assume that the manifold
M(w) := {7J E W 2,P(w)j 7J = 0 on 'Yo, aa/3(7J) - aa/3 = 0 in w}
contains only 7J = 0 and that the applied forces are "of order cO with re-
spect to e", in the sense that pi(c) = pi,O for all e > 0, where the functions
pi,O E L2(w) are independent ofe. Then ,0 satisfies the following variational
problem PM(W):

Theorem 2. Assume that M(w) -::j; {O} and that, at each point of M(w) ,
the tangent space to M(w) contains nonzero elements. Also, assume that the
applied forces are "of order e2 with respect to e", in the sense that pi(e) =

The assumptions and the conclusions of Thms. 1 and 2 being identical to the
assumptions and to the conclusions reached by Miara (1998) and Lods & Mi-
ara (1998) about the leading term (shown in particular to be independent of
the "transverse" variable, so that it can be identified with a two-dimensional
vector field) of a formal asymptotic expansion of the scaled three-dimensional
solution (the vector field whose components are the scaled covariant compo-
nents of the three-dimensional displacement field, i.e., the components over
the contravariant bases gi ,t: defined by gi ,t: .g; = 5!), again with the thickness
as the "small" parameter, the nonlinear shell model of Koiter's type proposed
in Sect. 2 is thus justified, at least formally.

Remarks. (1) The assumption in Thm. 2 about the tangent space to the
manifold M(w), which first appeared in this form in Ciarlet (2000a, Thm.
10.1-1), was implicit in Lods & Miara (1998).
(2) The function spaces in Miara (1998) and Lods & Miara (1998) are
not the same as in Thms. 1 and 2. This observation bears no consequence,
however, inasmuch as only formal methods are compared.
(3) This justification of a nonlinear shell model of Koiter's type is anal-
ogous in its principle to the justification of the linear model proposed by
Koiter (1970). But while the former justification is only formal, the latter
is substantiated by convergence theorems as € approaches zero (see Ciarlet
(2000a, Sect. 7) and the references therein).

Abstract. We present two families of finite element methods for the Reissner-
Mindlin plate model. The families are based on a stabilized formulation which cir-
cumvents the requirement that the finite element spaces should satisfy the Babuska-
Brezzi conditions. In the first family the polynomial order of the basis functions
for the deflection is one higher than that for the rotation. In the second family the
stabilization is combined with the MITC interpolation technique, which enables
equal order basis functions. We review the stability and error estimates which show
that the methods are "locking-free" and optimally convergent.
1
Introduction
In the last decade great progress has been achieved in the understanding of
the "locking" phenomena connected with the finit e element solution of the
Reissner-Mindlin plate model. Based on the Babuska-Brezzi theory [6,7,11]
for saddle point problems it has been possible to design optimally convergent
methods. Among of the most successful are the so-called MITC families of
Bathe, Brezzi and Fortin [9].The performance of these is not only documented
by numerous benchmark computations (cf. e.g. [8]) but also by a rigorous
mathematical analysis, cf. [9,13,18,10]. When designing an element based on
the traditional energy formulation the necessary Babuska-Brezzi conditions
are quite restrictive, and hence none of the elements employ standard basis
functions.
In our work we have followed another approach that has its origin in
fluid mechanics where the class of methods are known as "stabilized" or
"Galerkin Least-Squares" methods. In this, properly weighted least-squares
terms of the strong form of the differential equations is added to the saddle
point functional. This has the consequence that the finite element spaces do
not have to satisfy the "inf-sup" condition and hence much more freedom is
possible when choosing the finite elements.
For plates this technique was first used by Franca and Hughes [15] and
in our work we have continued in this direction. In [17] we have shown that
the stabilization be done directly in the displacement vari ables avoiding the

intermediate step of stabilizing the saddle point functional obtained by choos-
ing the shear force as an independent unknown. This is the case both for the
error analysis and for the implementation. A consequence is that the method
leads to a positively definite stiffness matrix which is better conditioned than
those obtained from traditional methods.
This first stabilized formulation suffers from the drawback that the dis-
placement has to be chosen as polynomial of one degree higher than that
for the rotation in order to have a right balance in the consistency error.
It turns out that equal order polynomials can be chosen if the stabilization
is combined with the MITC interpolation technique. These stabilized MITC
elements have the following favorable properties:
- They employ standard basis functions, equal for the rotation and the
deflection. No special" bubble" degrees of freedom are needed.
- They contain stable and optimally convergent methods with linear (or bi-
linear) basis functions. (These elements were already introduced in [13].)
- They give rise to well conditioned stiffness methods which is an advantage
for iterative solvers.
The purpose of this paper is to give a short review of these elements.

The Plate Model of Mindlin and Reissner
Let fl C IR2 be the midsurface of the plate and suppose that the plate is
clamped along the boundary r.The variational formulation of the Reissner-
Mindlin model (appropriately scaled, cf. e.g. [9]) is: find the deflection w E
W = HJ(fl) and the rotation vector () = (Ox,£Jy ) E V = [HJ(fl)]2 such that
a((),'TJ) + C 2(V'w - (),V'v - 'TJ) = (g,v)
V(v, 'TJ) E W x V,

where t is the thickness of the plate, G is the shear modulus, II the Poisson
ratio and 9 is the (scaled) transverse load. e(·) is the small strain tensor and

as an independent unknown in S = [L2(S2W one gets the following mixed
formulation: find (w, 0, q) E W x V x S such that

We here remark that the problem is singularly perturbated; in the limit ob-
tained when t
--+ 0 the shear force is not longer in S, but in the space
H- 1(div : st), cf. [12]. On consequence of this is that there for small values
of the thickness t there is a boundary layer in the solution [1]. The differential
equations of this system are obtained by integrating by parts:
LO + q = 0

The Stabilized Finite Element Methods
Let Ch be a partitioning of ti into triangular or quadrilateral finite elements.
The elements K
E Ch are images of the reference element K under the
(bi)linear mapping FK : K --+ K. The diameter of an element K
E Ch is
denoted by b«. In the mesh we allow both triangles and quadrilaterals and
hence we will use the notation
R (K) = {Ps(K)
when K is a triangle,
s
Qs(K) when K is a quadrilateral.
The finite element subspaces for the deflection and rotation are denoted by
Wh C Wand v, C V, respectively.
In the next two sections we will present the two families of elements.

A Consistent Formulation
The spaces are specified as:
Wh = {v E WI VIK E Rk+l(K), VK E Ch},
Vh = {ry E V IrylK E [Rk(KW, VK E Ch},
(12)
(13)
where k 2: 1 is the polynomial index. The method is then defined as follows.
Method 1. Find (Wh, lh) E Wh x Vh such that
Bh(Wh,OhiV,ry) = (g,v)
V(v,ry) E Wh x Vh ,

JFrom the solution (Wh, Oh) we then calculate the approximation for the shear
by
(16)
Here a is a positive parameter lying in a fixed range which will be specified
in Theorem 2 below. 0
Note that (5) and the first equation of (7) give
(17)
Hence, we see that the approximation (16) is consistent with the exact shear.
The formulation, although nonstandard, is easily seen to be consistent.
Theorem 1. The solution (w,O) to (7) satisfies the equation
Bh(W,O;v,ry) = (g,v)
V(v,ry) E W xV.
Proof: Recalling the first equation in (7), the expression (17), and the vari-
ational form (6), we get

Let us next outline the steps needed in the error analysis of the method,
i.e, the stability and estimation of the interpolation error. (The details of the
analysis are given in [17] .)
First, let us denote by CI > 0 the biggest constant in the inverse inequality
CI L
h'J<IILryll~,K ~ a(ry, ry),
KECI>
which is valid as Vh consists of continuous piecewise polynomial functions
(cf. e.g. [14]).
For the discrete solution space Wh x Vh we then define the mesh dependent
norm
(19)
The stability with respect to this norm now follows then from the Poincare
and Korn inequalities.
Theorem 2. Suppose that 0 < 0: < CI' Then there is a positive constant C
such that
Proof: Using the inverse estimate (18) and Korn's inequality we get
Bh(V,ry; v, ry)
=a(ry,ry)- L

(20)
Using the triangle inequality, the same inverse estimate and the boundedness
of the bilinear form a one obtains

KEC"
Combining (20) and (21) gives
where we used an equivalence of norms, which is easily proved by scaling. 0
Remark 1. For triangular elements with k = 1 it holds
and hence the bilinear form Bh reduces to
Bh(W,OjV,"1) = a(O, "1) + L (t2 + ahk)-I(V'W - 0, V'V - "1)K ,
KEC"
and we obtain a formulation proposed by Pitkaranta [19]. Now, the method
is stable for all positive values of a. It is easily seen that the above bilinear
form can also be used in the quadrilateral case for k = 1 without a decrease
in accuracy. 0
In the convergence analysis we take the effect of the boundary layer into
account. (We refer to [1-3] for a detailed analysis of the boundary layers.)
In the limit t ~ 0 the solution (w,O) = (wt, Od of the Reissner-Mindlin
equations converges to the Kirchhoff solution for which it holds
00 = V'wo.
(22)
The limit solution Wo satisfies the biharmonic equation in the domain D.
The following theorem (that can be deduced [17] from results by Arnold
and Liu [4]) gives the interior and global regularity for the" Kirchhoff" com-
ponent and the" residual" component of the solution.
Theorem 3. Let D be a convex polygonal domain and let Di be a domain
compactly embedded in D. Denote by (w,0, q) the Reissner-Mindlin solution
for the clamped plate and let w = Wo+wr , where Wo is the deflection obtained
from the Kirchhoff model. With 9 E HS- 2(D) and tg E Hs- I(D), s ~ 1, it
then holds

When estimating the approximation error we consider separately both
components of the solution. Furthermore, we consider the case of a finer
mesh along the boundary. Hence, we measure the size of the elements in
the interior region Jli and the boundary region Jlb = Jl \ Jli by the mesh
parameters
(25)
The estimate so obtained is [17]:
Theorem 4. Suppose that 0 < Q < CJ . For the solution (Wh'(h, qh) of (14)
it then holds
111(w - Wh, (J - (Jh)lIlh + Ilq - qhll-1,h + t Ilq - qhllo
:::; C{h7(llgllk-2 + tllgllk-r) + hb(llgll-1 + tllgllo)}.

3.2
The Stabilized MITe Elements
These elements use identical basis functions for the deflection and both com-
ponents of the rotation. For the index k ~ 1 they are defined as
Wh = {v E W I VIK E Rk(K), VK E Ch},
Vh = {1J E V 11JIK E [Rk(KW, VK E Ch}'
(26)
(27)
The use of equal basis functions is enabled by modifying the shear energy
term. The shear force will be interpolated in the space
(28)
with
(29)
where J K is the Jacobian matrix of F K and J;<T is the transpose of J ;<1.
The spaces on the reference element Sk(K) will be defined separately for
triangles and quadrilaterals. In addition, we will define the the MITe re-
duction op~rator R K
: IHl(K)]2 --+ Sk(K). It is defined from the operator
Rk : [Hl(K)jZ --+ Sk(K) on the reference element by a covariant transfor-
mation through the equation
(30)
The shear spaces and reduction operators are now the following.
Triangular elements. For a triangle K we choose

where Pk-1(K) is space of homogeneous polynomials of degree k - 1. ~ and
TJ are the coordinates of K (i.e . the natural coordinates of K). This is the
rotated Raviart-Thomas space [20j.
The reduction operator Rk is defined through the conditions
h [(Rkii - ii ) .r ]v ds = 0, "Iv E Pk-1 (E), for every edge E of K , (32)
and

operator is defined through the conditions
h[(Rk7} - ii ) ' r]v ds = 0, "Iv E Pk-l(E) , for every edge E of K , (35)

We are now ready to define the method.

and we have

(41)
This gives the linear element introduced and analyzed in [13]. In [16] it has
been shown that it is essentially equivalent to an element introduced by
Hughes and Tessler [22] . Later, it has been rediscovered in [23,5,21].0
The analysis of the method requires a careful study of the properties of
the reduction operator. First, it has to be included in meshdependent norm.
Similarly as for the first method we automatically have a stable formulation.
Theorem 5. There exists a constant C > 0 such that for 0 < ex < CJ it
holds
Second, in contrast to the first method, this formulation is not consistent.
The error introduced is however of the right order due to the orthogonality
properties (35) and (35) of the reduction operators.
Third, it can be shown that for there is an interpolation operator h for
the deflection such that
(43)
Without this crucial property we would have an error term of order O(h k - l )
which would exclude the use of equal order interpolation.
We refer to the original article [17] for all the details in this error analysis.
The final error estimate obtained is:

Introduction
Microelectronics solder joints are constantly subjected to a fatigue induced
by a thermal expansion mismatch between IC-package and substrate. From
a viewpoint of reliability assessment of the microelectronics solder joints, it
is important to predict the fatigue life of the joints, which should help in im-
proving the package design accuracy and efficiency. The fatigue life of solder
joints may be divided into the crack initiation and growth life. As to crack
initiation life, many formulae based On the Coffin-Manson 's law or the mod-
ified Coffin-Manson's law have been proposed [1]-[4]. By applying the strain
range partitioning approach and a linear cumulative damage concept, and us-
ing material-dependent parameters, the authors also have proposed a fatigue
life prediction formula on eutectic ( 638n - 37Pb ) and low melting-point
(378n - 45Pb - 18Bi) solders, expressing the number of cycles to failure as a
function of cyclic frequency and equivalent inelastic strain range, which can
be understood to successfully incorporate a creep damage effect [5]. However,
little is known about the crack growth behavior of the solder joints used in
surface mount technology[6]. In the meantime, the toxicity of lead, Pb, in-
cluded in the conventional solder material is also a problem. Therefore the
development of Pb-free solder joints with high reliability is hurried up and

considerable attention has been paid to the fatigue strength of Pb-free solder
[7]-[10].
In this work, fatigue tests are carried out on surface-mounted solder joints
in product size electronic package models using conventional Sn-37Pb eutectic
solder and two kinds of Pb-free solder ( Sn-2.8Ag-15Bi-0.5Cu and Sn-3.5Ag-
0.7Cu) in order to examine the crack initiation and growth behavior. Torsion
fatigue tests are performed in parallel on bulk specimen of solder used in this
work to obtain basic fatigue data of the solder materials, such as mechanical
properties, cyclic stress-strain curves and prediction formulae used in numer-
ical simulation. Further, a finite element program employing a new scheme
for crack growth analysis is developed, and finite element analyses (FEA) of
fatigue crack growth in microelectronics solder joints are carried out by this
program. The calculated results are compared with the experimental ones to
examine the feasibility of crack growth life prediction by the FEA.

Testing procedures
The geometry of the surface mount type specimen is shown in Fig.I. The
specimen was manufactured by cutting the quad flat type LSI-package, and
consisted of LSI-package, lead wire, solder joints and substrate. The configu-
ration and the dimension of the specimen are shown magnified in Fig.2. The
lead wire, being of a Gullwing type shown in the figure, is made of 42 Alloy
and the substrate of glass epoxy resin. The dimensions shown in this figure
are averages of several measured values in specimens. Conventional Sn-37Pb
eutectic solder and two kinds of Pb-free solder (Sn-2.8Ag-15Bi-0.5Cu and
Sn-3.5Ag -0.7Cu) are used.

The fitting of the specimen to fatigue testing system is as shown in Fig.3.
The top surface of the test model was clamped to a displacement-controlled
reciprocating pulse-stage, as shown in the figure. The fatigu e tests on solder
joints were carried out at temperatures controlled to 303±2K and 333±2K,
the reciprocating frequencies 0.1 and 1.0Hz, and the displacement amplitudes
being 25 and 50f..Lm. The crack initiation and growth loci were followed under
stereo-microscope. In addition, torsion fatigue tests on bulk specimen of Sn-
2.8Ag-15Bi-0.5Cu and Sn-3.5Ag -0.7Cu solder were performed in the same
way as shown in the previous paper [11] in order to obtain th e material
constant using FEA.

Experimental results
With increase in number of cycles, a surface of the solder fillet loses metallic
luster, followed by the appearance of a fissured pattern, which grows into
cracks in the comparatively upper position of the fillet edge. Fatigue crack
initiat ion life, NC, is defined by the value of N, number of cycles, at which
a microcrack has grown to approximately 30m, long enough to be detectable
as a surface crack. After crack initiation, the crack grew along the above-
mentioned fissured pattern bi-directionally, i.e., both to the fillet center and
to the longitudinal direction . The cross-sectional views which were cut from
solder fillet along the center line were examined by microscope to determine
the longitudinal crack growth locus in the fillet . An example is shown in FigA.

The crack grew initially downwards in direction. When the crack approached
the interface with lead wire, its direction changed and began to grow along
th e vicinity of the solder-lead interface thereafter.
Fig. 4. Cracked solder joint ( Sn-2.8Ag-15Bi-O.5Cu, 8 = ± 50j.tm O.lHz, 303K )
A typical relationship between th e crack length, a, along the interface
with lead wire and the number of cycles, N, is shown in Fig. 5. The process of
initiation to final failure can reasonably be divided into four phases, namely,
life up to crack initiation (T), life from crack initiation to crack growth up
to the plateau (U), life of the plateau, i.e., the period of crack stabilization
(V) and life for crack propagation to final failure (W). Figure 6 represents
the averaged lives for the above four phases under each test condition. We
see from this figure that the rate of domain U to the total life is very large
for all test conditions. Consequently, for the prediction of the total fatigue
life, crack growth analyses including the plateau region are indispensable. As
for the influence of the test condition on fatigue life, it should be noted that
an increase in applied displacement from ±25 to ±50J.Lm , abruptly redu ced
the domains U and V for Sn-2.8Ag-15Bi-0.5Cu solder joints, while it reduced
the life to a quarter orily for 63Sn-37Pb solder joints. As to Sn-3.5Ag -0.7Cu
solder, the crack did not grow to final failure until 30,000 cycles for all test
conditions.

based on the strain range partitioning method and linear cumulative damage
concept for Sn-37Pb solder material [5]. In the present work, the material
constants of the following prediction formula for Sn-2.8Ag-15Bi-0.5Cu and

The st ress-strain analyses of the solder joints were performed by three dimen-
sional elasto-inelastic FEM in order to predict the crack initiation locus and
life in the solder joint. In our strain analyses, an experimentally determined
cyclic stress range versus inelastic st rain range relation was incorporated into
the constitutive equation to consider the creep effect . First , the whole finite
element model as shown in Fig.7 was calculated, and then a detailed analysis
of the solder joint as shown in Fig.8 was carried out by using a zooming
technique.

The cyclic equivalent stress, aeq s - inelastic strain, c~~, relations used in
this calculation were obtained from torsion fatigue test data on the bulk
solder. Mechanical properties used for the numerical simulation are shown in
Table 2. The modulus of longitudinal elasticity and yield stress was obtained
from the above-mentioned fatigue test data on bulk solder, the Poisson's ratio
being assumed to be 0.3. Perfect elasticity of the lead wire, package, substrate
and Cu-land were assumed. The sum of the equivalent inelastic strain c~~ for
downward displacernent.d, and that for backward displacement, -S, was given
at the upper surface of the LSI-package, was regarded as equivalent inelastic
strain range, .:1c~~ . Figure 9 shows the distribution of the equivalent inelastic
strain range
.:1c~~. The highest zone of .:1c~~ is in good agreement with the
experimentally observed crack initiation site.

Crack initiation life of solder joints
By substituting equivalent inelastic strain range, .:1c~~, calculated by three-
dimensional inelastic stress analysis into eq.(l), the calculated crack initiation
life, (Nclca1is obtained. Table 3 represents several examples of (NcJcal and
compares with experimental results Nc; the ratios Nc/(Nclca1are found to
be 1.1 to 5.37. Thus it would be reasonable to assume that fatigue crack

Prediction of the crack growth path and life
5.1
Crack growth path
Because the inner part of solder fillet in Gullwing type joints can be regarded
as in an approximate plane strain condition, two-dimensional FEM program
for crack growth analyses was developed in order to predict the fatigue crack
growth life in solder joints. In this work, the super-element shown in Fig.lO,
which can be rotated in conformity with the direction of crack growth, was
embedded in a crack tip region; triangular elements were regenerated by De-
launay Triangulation technique[12] in the outer region for arbitrary bound-
ary geometry including crack faces. A special attention was paid in this work

Prediction of the Fatigue Crack Growth Life
31
regarding the crack surface deformation problem as a dynamic contact prob-
lem by the use of penalty function method[13]. Cyclic stress-strain curves
obtained in torsion fatigue tests of the solder material were used to consider
both plasticity and creep effect.
As for the prediction of crack growth path, some criterions based on max-
imum tangential stress (MTS), maximum energy release rate (ERR), mini-
mum strain energy density (SED) and modified SED have been proposed. In
this work it is assumed that the crack extends in the direction of maximum
Llao at a small radial distance of r = d, where d is chosen to be a grain
diameter's distance, 1.0m, in solder material. See reference[14] for general
discussions including MTS and the present assumption. Concretely, enforce-
ment displacements (+J-J+J-Jcc) are given cyclically at the certain crack
length stage. Then, the relationship between ao and angle () in the last cycle
(+15-8) is interpolated by the spline function of degree 3, and the maximum
value of ao was made to be aO m a ", ' In the meantime, the minimum value of ao
becomes a negative value. However, since the negative part is not concerned
in crack growth, a maximum value of Llao is regarded as aOm a", ' Therefore
it is defined as (LlaO)cT in respect of the maximum value of Llao as shown
in Fig.ll, and a line crack of lOpm length is made to grow in the direction
() 1. By the way it is well known that the fatigue resistance in intermetal-
lie compound formed at the solder-lead interface is improved. Therefore we
assumed that the thickness of the compound is 7pm and the next crack tip
never enter this zone.

A typical example of the crack growth path calculated by FEA is demon-
strated in Fig.13. The crack grew along the vicinity of the solder-lead interface
after it approached the interface. The simulated crack growth path is in good
agreement with the experimentally observed one. It would be reasonable to
suppose that the crack growth path in microelectronics solder joint can be
predicted by using the present FEA program.
5.2
Crack growth life
Let us now attempt to extend this simulation to the prediction of crack
growth life. Figure' 14 plots the computed (d0"9)cT against crack length for
test conditions indicated in the figure, where (d0"9)cT denotes the maximum
d0"9 at r = l.0J.Lm. It is characteristic of this plot that (d0"9)cT decreases
monotonically as crack length exceeds O.03mm until O.18mm and increases
again to final failure due to the contact effect of the crack surface. This
tendency is similar to the experimentally obtained relationship between crack
growth rate and crack length. In Fig. 15 crack growth rate, da/dN, is plotted
against (d0"9)cT for the conditions indicated in the figure, which describes
crack growth rate as a function of (d0"9)cT of the form;
da/dN = (3 [(d0"9)cT -1']'"

In the FEA the same super-element is embedded in the near crack-tip
region to avoid the effect of mesh density on the results. It is considered that
Q , f3 and , in the above equation would be regarded as material constants
being independent of the applied displacement amplitude, 8, and joint type,
provided that the same super-element is used in the FEA. For this reason,
fatigue crack growth life can be predicted by integrating Eq.(2) .
Crack length-to-number of cycles relations for ±25J.Lm and ±50J.Lm were
calculated by using the above-mentioned values of 0:, f3 and " and compared

with the experimental ones. Several examples of the results for each materials
are shown in Fig.16(a) to (f). Agreement between calculation and experiment
would be satisfactory for all experimental conditions in Gullwing type joints.
6
Application to a Butt type joint
The FEA of the Butt type joint shown in Fig.17 is carried out in the same
manner as for the Gullwing type and compared with the experiment in or-
der to examine the feasibility of the prediction method for crack growth life
proposed in this work. See Fig.18, which compare the crack growth paths
between simulation and experiment. Although the fatigue crack growth in
butt joint takes place in different fashion compared with the case of Gull-
wing type, crack growth path is controlled by maximum stress range as well
as Gullwing type. An example of the prediction of fatigue crack growth life
in Butt type by integrating Eq.(2) using above-mentioned values of a, f3
and I , which are obtained from Gullwing type model is shown in Fig.19. In
spite of the quite different joint geometry, the numerical result is in a fair
agreement with the experimental one. These comparison would suggest the
validity of the present FEA for the prediction of fatigue crack growth life of
the microelectronics solder joint independently of the joint geometry.

Conclusions
An FEA program employing a new scheme for crack growth analysis was
developed, by which fatigue crack growth in microelectronics solder joints
were numerically analyzed. The FEA results show that crack growth rate
and path are controlled by a maximum opening stress range, .dO-Oma", , at
a small radial distance of r = d, where d is chosen to be a grain diameter's
distance, 1.0m, in solder material. Experimentally obtained crack growth rate
is found to be related to .do-oma", by
da/dN = f3 [.do-Oma'" - I'r ,
where a = 2.0 and f3 = 2.5 x 1O-9mm5 / N 2 are determined independently
of test conditions and I' is a kind of material constant. Conclusively it is
shown that experimentally observed fatigue crack growth path and life can
be predicted by the maximum opening stress range criterion and numerically
integrating the above equation.

Abstract. In order to study the effects of spilled oil on coastal ecosystem, multi-
phase flow with reaction is modeled mathematically. In this procedure, Discontinu-
ous Interface Generating Method plays an important role to formulate the decom-
position phenomena of oil into water and soluble components. This mathematical
model is numerically solved by use of finite difference method and the numerical
results are presented.

Introduction
1.1
Motivation
In this paper, the effects of spilled oil on coastal ecosystem are discussed
from the viewpoint of fluid dynamical studies. A tanker was stranded in the
Japan Sea on January 2nd, 1997 and oil flowed out into sea from the tanker.
Spilled oil drifted on the shore of Mikuni district, adhered to sand beach and
penetrated into sand accompanied with the ebbing tide. The local people and
many volunteers cooperated to remove spilled oil from seashore. At that time,
serious influences of spilled oil to exert on ecosystem were discussed from a
lot of viewpoints. Such an incident mentioned above promoted strongly to
organize national projects to investigate and to study environmental pollu-
tion.
A part of this study is under cooperation with "Research for the Fu-
ture Program" of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Research
theme: Evaluation and restoration of the effects of oil pollution on coastal
ecosystem, Principal investigator: Prof. Mitsumasa Okada, Department of
Environmental Science, Hiroshima University). Main themes included in this
project are;
1. Process of drifting ashore of spilled oil.
2. Penetrating process of spilled oil into tidal flats and seabeds.
(a) Effect of wave motion to the penetration.
(b) Effect of tidal motion to the penetration.
(c) Transport process of oil in sand.
3. Decomposition process of spilled oil after the penetration.
4. Influence for the penetration to exert on soluble components in seawater.

5. Evaluation of influence for the penetration to exert on ecosystem and
benthos.
6. Restorative techniques for the influence due to oil pollution.
This study is focused on theme 3. from fluid dynamical point of view. The
phenomena of theme 3. describe the decomposition of penetrated oil into
discharged materials by bacteria in the tidal flats, main components of which
are water and soluble ones. These phenomena are mathematically modeled
into a multi-phase flow formulation with reactions. One of characteristics of
this model is an appearance of velocity jump on the reaction surface between
phases of oil and water based on the difference of densities among them.
In order to treat this difficulty, Discontinuous Interface Generating Method
(DIGM) has been proposed by the authors, an original idea of which was
invented through repeating try and error of numerical experiments. Flow
equations for all phases are unified into a single flow equation to construct
a numerical model. The fictitious domain method plays an important role
in this procedure. Also it should be noted that adhesion and penetration as
characteristic properties of oil are taken into consideration through boundary
conditions of friction type prescribed on the boundary between oil and sand.
Finally, numerical results are presented by solving the unified model by means
of the finite difference method.

Fictitious domain method Regard the domain occupied by air as the
fictitious domain because of large discrepancy of density between air and
water.
In the fictitious domain, we assume that air satisfies singularly perturbed
parabolic equation. As a matter of course, that does not need the incompress-
ibility condition. Then pressure p takes the value of atmospheric pressure Poe
there.

Interfacial interactions
Adhesion and sliding phenomena of oil in sand As an interfacial in-
teraction, we formulate adhesion and sliding phenomena of oil in sand on the
basis of simplified Coulomb law for friction. Let [err] be the jump of tangential
stress defined on the boundary between oil and water in sand[4].

I[err]I = tn: >---t ur = 0 or ur =J 0 (Sliding)
where 9r is the friction coefficient. For A = (aI ,a2,aa), IAI means Jar + a~ + a~ .
By use of the definition of the subdifferential, (15) and (16) are formulated
by
- [err] = 9r .a(Iurl)
(17)
In order to avoid the difficulty due to singularity arises in the numerical
treatment of (17), (17) is regularized as follows;

Here, kf and kw mean the rate of consumption for oil and the rate of pro-

is a positive constant. X(b) is characteristic function of fh.

Biological contribution to satisfy reactivity condition on the
reaction surface
We propose the following conjecture as one of possible interpretations of
adding dipole moment distribution along the reaction surface.
The torque caused by the difference of the bouyancy between the bacte-
ria pairs, which are closely located along the reaction surface, produces the
distribution of dipole moments on the reaction surface. Let 'Y be the reaction
surface which is assumed to be smooth. Then the dipole moment defined on
'Y is represented by tvbb), where bb) is delta measure supported on 'Y. On
the other hand, we have tvbb) = .0.X. Define the volume of a bacteria by

3.1
The statement of Theorem
Let us note that the interfacial interactions stated in 2.3 are represented by
the jump boundary conditions for the Dirichlet type (the reactivity condition)
and the Neumann type (the frictional condition). In order to introduce such
jump conditions into an unified model for multi-phase flow system, we have
developed Discontinuous Interface Generating Method (DIGM). For simplic-
ity, we discuss the case of steady Stokes problem defined in il C R3. il is
divided into subdomains ill and il2 , whose interface is denoted by r. (See
figure 3.) The two phase Stokes problem (81) with jump boundary conditions
on r is defined as follows.
-.0.u(1) + V'p(l) = 1(1)

div u(l) =°

Remark 3.1
The surface distribution of the dipole moment with the normal direction
to the surface brings about the jump of the normal component of velocity for
the fluid flowing across the interface.

Remark 3.2 DIGM for Stokes equation with a variable viscosity is proved by
treating the transmission problem defined on T under the weak formulation
of the equation, that will be shown in the succeeding paper.

the same result as obtained in the steady case.

Abstract. We present a review of the CIP method that is known as a general nu-
merical solver for solid, liquid and gas. This method is a kind of semi-Lagrangean
scheme and has been extended to treat incompressibleflow in the framework ofcom-
pressible fluid. Since it uses primitive Euler representation, it suits for multi-phase
analysis. The recent version of this method guarantees the exact mass conservation
even in the framework of semi-Lagrangean scheme. Comprehensive review is given
for the strategy of the CIP method that has a compact support and subcell res-
olution including front capturing algorithm with functional transformation. Some
practical applications are also reviewedsuch as milk crown or coronet.

Introduction
Solving all phases of matter together by one universal scheme is a grand
challenge to the field of computational mathematics. For these types of prob-
lems such as melting and deformation, and evaporation, we need to treat
topology and phase changes of the materials simultaneously, where the grid
system aligned to the solid or liquid surface has no meaning and sometimes
the mesh is distorted and even broken up. A universal treatment of all phases
by one simple algorithm is thus essential and we are at the turning point of
attacking this goal. Even without phase change, problems of surface captur-
ing and structure-fluid interaction are not easy task. In most of cases, the
grid can not always be adapted to those surfaces. Therefore, the description
of moving surfaces of complicated shape in the Cartesian grid system will be
a challenging subject.
In order to attack the problems mentioned above, we must first find a
method to treat a sharp interface and to solve the interaction of compressible
gas with incompressible liquid or solid. Toward this goal, we take Eulerian-
approach based on the CIP(cubic-interpolated propagation) method [1-7]
which does not need adaptive grid system and therefore removes the prob-
lems of grid distortion caused by structural break up and topology change.
The material surface can be captured by almost one grid throughout the
computation[8]. Furthermore, the scheme can treat all the phases of matter
from solid state through liquid and two phase state to gas without restriction
on the time step from high sound speed [9].

Pressure-based algorithm coupled with semi-Lagrangian approach like the
CIP proved to be stable and robust in analyzing these subjects. The only
disadvantage of this method was the lack of conservative property. Recent
version of the CIP-CSL4[1O] can overcome this difficulty and povide exactly
conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme. Since these scheme do not use the cu-
bic polynomial but use different orders of polynomial, we re-define the name
of these CIP families as "Constrained Interpolation Profile" and still keep
the abbreviation, CIP. This means that various constraints such as the time
evolution of spatial gradient, that is used in the original CIP method, or spa-
tially integrated conservative quantities can be used to construct the profile.
In this paper, we shall give a brief review of the CIP family and give some
examples applied to various phases of matter.

2.1
CIP method
Although the nature is in a continuous world, digitization process is unavoid-
able in order to be implemented in numerical simulations. Primary goal of
numerical algorithm will be to retrieve the lost information inside the grid cell
between these digitized points. Most of numerical schemes proposed before,
however, did not take care of real solution inside the grid cell and resolution
has been limited to the grid size. The CIP method proposed by one of the
authors tries to construct a solution inside the grid cell close enough to this
real solution of the given equation with some constraints. We here explain its
strategy by using an advection equation,
(1)
When the velocity is constant, the solution of Eq.(l) gives a simple trans-
lational motion of wave with a velocity u. The initial profile (solid line of
Fig.1(a)) moves like a dashed line in a continuous representation. At this
time, the solution at grid points is denoted by circles and is the same as
the exact solution. However, if we eliminate the dashed line as in Fig.1(b),
then the information of the profile inside the grid cell has been lost and it
is hard to imagine the original profile and it is natural to imagine a profile
like that shown by solid line in (c). Thus, numerical diffusion arises when we
construct the profile by the linear interpolation even with the exact solution
as shown in Fig.1(c). This process is called the first-order upwind scheme. On
the other hand, if we use quadratic polynomial for interpolation, it suffers
from overshooting. This process is the Lax-Wendroff scheme or Leith scheme.
What made this solution worse? It is because we neglect the behavior of
the solution inside a grid cell and merely follow after the smoothness of the so-
lution. From this experience, we understand that a method incorporating the
real solution into the profile within a grid cell is quite an important subject.

(c) When (b) is linearly interpolated, numerical diffusion appears. (d) In the CIP,
spatial derivative also propagates and the profile inside a grid cell is retrieved.
We propose to approximate the profile as shown below. Let us differentiate
Eq.(l) with spatial variable x, then we get

where 9 == aflax stands for the spatial derivative of f. In the simplest case
where the velocity u is constant, Eq.(2) coincides with Eq.(l) and represents
the propagation of spatial derivative with a velocity u. By this equation, we
can trace the time evolution of f and 9 on the basis of Eq.(l). If 9 could be
predicted to propagate like that shown by the arrows in Fig.l(d), the profile
after one step would be limited to a specific profile. It is easy to imagine that
by this constraint, the solution becomes much closer to the initial profile that
is the real solution. Most importantly, the solution thus created gives a profile
consistent with Eq.(l) even inside the grid cell.
If both the values of f and 9 are given at two grid points, the profile
between these points can be interpolated by cubic polynomial F(x) = ax3 +
bx2 + ex + d. Thus, the profile at n+1 step is readily obtained by shifting the
profile by u.1t like r+1 = F(x - u.1t) ,gn+1 = dF(x - u.1t)ldx.

Interface tracking: a sharpness preserving method
Treatment of interface that lies between materials of different properties re-
mains a formidable challenge to the computation of multi-phase fluid dynam-
ics. Eulerian methods have proven robust in simulating flows with interfaces
of complex topology. Generally, Eulerian methods use color function to dis-
tinguish the regions where different materials fall in. To accurately reproduce
the physical processes across the interface transition region, keeping the com-
pact thickness of the interface is of great importance. The finite difference
schemes constructed on an Eulerian grid, however, intrinsically produce nu-
merical diffusions to the solution of advection equation by which the interface
is predicted temporally. Thus, the direct implementation of finite difference
schemes (even of high order) can not maintain the compactness of the inter-
face.
Various kinds of methods have been developed so far to achieve a compact
and correctly defined interface by introducing extra programming. Among
those mostly used algorithms are the level set methods and the VOF(volume
of fluid) methods for front capturing, and others for front tracking [11] . Level
set method that was firstly proposed by Osher and Sethian[12] gets around
the computation of interfacial discontinuity by evaluating the field in higher
dimensions. The interface of interest is then recovered by taking a subset of
the field. Practically, the interface is defined as the zero level set of a distance
function from the interface.
In a VOF kind method on the other hand, the interface needs to be re-
constructed based on the volume fraction of fluid. VOF methods are mainly
classified as SLIC(simple line interface calculation)algorithm[13] and PLIC
(piecewise linear interface calculation) algorithm[14] according to the inter-
polation function used to represent the interface. The SLIC makes use of
piecewise constant reconstruction and the interfaces are approximated by
lines aligned with mesh coordinates. The PLIC estimates the interface with
a truly piecewise linear approximation that improves largely the geometrical
faithfulness of the method.
In [8] and [15], we devised an interface tracking technique which appears
efficient, geometrically faithful and diffusionless. The method is a combination
of the CIP advection solver and a tangent function transformation.
Consider K kinds of impermeable materials occupying closed areas {ilk (t),
k = 1,2,···, K} in computational domain D E R 3(x,y, z), we identify them
with color functions or density functions {cPk(X, y, z, t), k = 1,2, · · · , K} by
the following definition

Suppose these materials move at the local speed, the color functions evolve
then according to the following advection equation
acPk
fit + u· 'VcPk = 0,
k = 1,2"", K
(5)
where U is the local velocity.
It is known that solving the above equation by finite difference schemes
in an Eulerian representation will produce numerical diffusion and tend to
smear the initial sharpness of the interfaces. In our method, rather than the
original variable cPk itself, its transformation, say F(cPk), is calculated by the
eIP method. We specify F(cPk) to be a function of cPk only, which means that
the new function F(cPk) is also governed by the same equation as (5). Hence,
we have
aF(cPk) + U . 'VF(A-. ) = 0
at
v»:>»,
(6)
and all the algorithms proposed for cPk (schemes for advection equation) can
be used to F(cPk). Hopefully, by the considerable simplicity, this kind of tech-
niques would be very attractive for practical implementation. We here use a
transformation of a tangent function for F(cPk), that is,
F(cPk) = tan[(l - €)n(cPk - 1/2)]'
cPk = tan- 1F(cPk)/[(l - €)n] + 1/2,
(7)
(8)
where € is a small positive constant. The factor (1 - €) makes us get around
-00 for cPk = 0 and 00 for cPk = 1 and enables us to tune for a desired
steepness of the transition layer.

Although cPk experiences a rapid change from 0 to 1 at the interface, F(cPk)
shows a quite regular behavior. Because most of the values of F(cPk) are con-
centrated near cPk = 0 and 1, the function transformation improves locally
the spatial resolution near the large gradients. Thus, the sharp discontinuity

62
Takashi Yabe
can be described quite easily. The transformation of this kind is effective only
for the case where the value of rPk is limited to a definite range throughout
the calculation, like the color function defined before. This method does not
involve any interface const ruction procedure and is quite economical in com-
putational complexity. It should be also notified that the presented method
is more attractive in 3-D computation since the extension of the scheme to
3-D is straightforward.
Figure 2(c) shows a 1D square wave propagation computed by the CIP
method together with the tangent transformation. The initial sharpness is
well preserved and the discontinuities are advected with a correct speed.
2.3
Conservative Semi-Lagrangian Scheme
It is well known that the CIP method shows good conservation of mass, al-
though the method is written in a non-conservative form . However, in some
special cases, there still exist problems which require exact conservation of
mass. For example, when we treat the black-hole formation and plasma dy-
namics, small fraction of mass and charge gener at es a gravity wave and a
large electric field, respectively, and therefore, the exact conservation of mass
is necessary to success the numerical analysis. For the solution of Vlasov
equat ion, it is possible to const itute and improve the CIP method so as to
exactly conserve the mass [16]. However, it is impossible to apply this nu-
merical technique to the solution of general hyperbolic equations. Therefore,
the development of the conservative CIP method is desired earnestly.
Under such situation, recently, authors have succeeded in the develop-
ment of new conservative schemes called as CIP-CSL4 [10] and CIP-CSL2
[17] which are based on the concept of the CIP scheme and succeeded the
excellent numerical features of the CIP scheme. In order to include these
various families of the schemes, we here extend the name CIP to mean Con-
strained Interpolation Profile and CSL means Conservative Semi-Lagrangian.
CSL4 and CSL2 use the 4-th order and quadratic polynomial, respectively.
The scheme has been applied to many problems of the linear and nonlinear
one-dimensional hyperbolic equations in the previous papers [10,17].
Since semi-Lagrangian schemes [18-20] can be used for high CFL (Courant-
Friedrichs-Lewy) condition in explicit form and are stable for multi-phase flow
calculations [21] but only shortcoming is the lack of exact mass conservation,
exactly conservative semi-Lagrangian schemes like the CIP-CSL2 and CSL4
have many promising future applications.
As already seen , the CIP adopted additional const raint , that is spatial
gradient, to represent the profile inside the grid cell. For being endowed with
the conservative property, we here add another constraint as

P'l-1 / 2 = Ir:

Therefore the spatial profile must be constructed to satisfy this additional
constraint. Ifthis could be realized, I would be advanced in the non-conservative
form with exact conservation in a form of p which could be advanced main-
taining mass conservation.
Keeping this point in mind, then the ith function piece Fi(x) must be
determined so as to satisfy the following constraints:
Fi(Xi-l) = I(Xi-l),
Fi(Xi) = I(Xi)
aFi(Xi-l)lax = g(Xi-l)
aFi(Xi)lax = g(Xi)

of three characters of "C.LP" and all the lines composing the charecters are thiner
than 3 grid points. (Left) Initial profile (Right) profile after one complete revolution.
In order to meet the above constraints, the 4th-order polynomial can be
chosen as the interpolation function Fi(x) . Thus the time development of I
and 9 is calculated simply by shifting the interpolation function Fi(x) by
uLlt in the same way as Eq.(4) of the CIP method. This method is called
CIP-CSL4 because it uses the 4-th order polynomial. Figure 3 demonstrates
the advantage of improved accuary by 4-th order and exact conservation.
These characters in Fig.3 is rotated within fixed grid system and dots after
the character II C" and "I" are one-grid size. It is surprising, material of one
grid size has been preserved even after revolution.
In the CIP, the time evolution of I and 9 = aI Iax is used as constraints
to define a cubic polynomial, while in the CIP-CSL4, constraints are now
I ,al lax and J[da: giving 4-th order polynomial. It would be intresting to
find a way to apply the eIP to the integrated value of I instead of I itself.

The motivation to employ this analogy stems from the following advection
equation.
ei:
eo
at + u ax = O.
(11)
Interestingly, if we take a spatial derivative of Eq.(11) and define D' =:
aD/ax, we obtain a conservative-type equation
ei»
a(uD')
fit +a;;- = O.
(12)
Then we come to an idea to use D' = 1 in Eq.(12) and D = J1 dx in
Eq.(11). This procedure is exactly the same as Eq.(l) by simply replacing 1
by J1 dx, together with Eq.(2) in which 9 is replaced by 1. Thus all the CIP
procedure can be used for a pair of J[do: and 1 instead of 1 and aI/ax
By this analogy, we shall introduce a function :
Di(x) = 1~ l(x')dx'.
We shall use a cubic polynomial to approximate this profile.
Di(x) = A1iX3 + A2iX
2 + IfX
(13)
(14)
(16)
where X = x -
Xi . The role of spatial gradient 9 in the CIP method is now
played by 1 that is spatial gradient of D(x) in the present scheme. By using
the above relation, a profile of l(x) between Xi and Xiup is then given by
taking the derivative of Eq.(14).
Then we apply the splitting algorithm of the CIP to
a1 + u a1 _ -1au
at
ax -
ax'
(15)
in which advection part is calculated by
ir: = 3A1ie + 2A2i~ + If,
where
~ = -u.1t. Although we separately treat the conservative equation
Eq.(12), mass conservation is recovered by Eq.(9) in constructing the spatial
profile inside a grid cell.
Although this scheme is quite promising, we will not use it for the calcu-
lations given in the following sections, since the original CIP is sufficient for
these applications.
2.4
Hydrodynamic Equations
In order to solve all the materials in a universal form, we must find an appro-
priate equation for solid, liquid and gas. We use full hydrodynamic equations
for these materials, which can be written in a form :
af- + (u V')f = S
at
(17)

Cartesian-Grid-Based e lP Method
65
where f = (p, u, T) , S = (-p'V ·u+Qm, -'Vp/p+Qu, -PTH'V ,u/pCv +QE),
and p is the density, u the velocity, p the pressure, T the temperature, Qm
represents the mass source term, Qu represents viscosity, elastic stress tensor,
surface tension etc. , and QE represents viscous heating, thermal conduction
and heat source.
Here, C; is the specific heat for constant volume and we define PTH =
T(8p/8T)p which is derived from the first principle of thermodynamics as
TdS = dU + pdV = (~~)v sr ; (~~)T dV +pdV
= c.sr + T (;~) v dV
(18)
where S is the entropy, U the internal energy, V = 1/p the specific volume.
The last relation in Eq.(18) is derived from the Helmholtz free energy F =
U - TS and thermodynamic consistency : (8p/8T)v = -(82F/8V8T) =
(8S/ 8V )T = I/T [P + (8U/ 8V)T]. Here, PTH is not merely the pressure. In
the special case of ideal fluid, however, PTH is exactly the pressure p because
the pressure linearly depends on temperature. Next simpler example is the
two phase flow described by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation:
(19)
where R is the gas constant . In this case, PT H becomes proportional to the
latent heat L. Therefore, FTH describes the heat loss due to latent heat when
the ratio of gas increases in two-phase flow. More general form of Cv and PTH
will be given by semi-analytical formula or tabulated data.
The CIP method solves the equat ions like Eq.(17) by dividing those into
non-advection and advection phases as given in previous papers. A cubic-
interpolated profile propagates in space in the advection phase and then
nonadvection phase is calculated by finite difference methods.
As shown in the previous papers, we can trace shock waves correctly with
the CIP method although it uses fluid equations written in a non-conservative
form or in primitive Euler representation.
2.5
Pressure-based algorithm
The CIP method uses the primitive Euler method to solve Eq.(17), thus the
formulation into a simultaneous solution of incompressible and compressible
fluid is readily obt ained. In order to get an idea of this strategy, we shall
start at first examining how it has been difficult to solve them together. In
ordinary compressible fluid, the density p is solved by the mass conservation
equation and then the temperature T is obtained by energy equat ion. After
that, from the equation of state (EOS), the pressure p = p(p, T) is calculated.

66
Takashi Yabe
In the low density side, p ex pT like ideal fluid and dependence is relatively
weak, but at solid or liquid density p steeply rises as the density. This means
that extremely high pressure is need to compress solid or liquid even slightly.
In other words, for solid or liquid , the sound speed C, = (8p/8p)1/2 is quite
large. Therefore, if we choose the process in which density is calculated at
first, only a small amount of error on density of 10%, for example, causes a
large pressure pulse by 3-4 orders of magnitude.
In such a situation, incompressible approximation is normaly adopted,
that is, pressure equat ion to ensure 'V . u = 0 is derived from equation of
motion and mass conservation. This scheme is called pressure-based scheme
and MAC[22]' SMAC[23]' SIMPLE[24]' SIMPLER[25] etc . are some of the
typical examples.
In order to extend this idea to compressible fluid, we had better modify
the EOS. Let us rotate the EOS by 90 degree, then the steep pressure curve
becomes now flat density curve. This means that if we could solve the pressure
at first and then estimate the density later on by this EOS in terms of p(p,T),
the problem at the liquid density will be removed. Adding to this, since the
EOS in lower density gas depends linearly on other quantities, no problem
occur there by this reverse procedure.
Then how we realize this reverse procedure? For this purpose, we should
predict how the pressure reacts to the change of density and temperature.
Such a unified procedure to incorporate compressible fluid with incompress-
ible fluid has been initiated by Harlow as the ICE(Implicit Continuous Eu-
lerian) [26). The ICE has been improved by the PISO [27)(Pressure Implicit
with Splitting of Operators). In both cases, however, conservative equations
are used as a starting point . Main difference between ICE and PISO comes
from the treatment of convection term.
On the other hand, the CCUP [9] uses primitive Euler equations and splits
the advection term from the other terms related sound waves. By this sim-
plification, pressure equation becomes quite simple and the ability to attack
the multi-phase flow has been great ly improved. One year after this proposal,
Zienkiewicz et al.[28) proposed similar method but applied to Finite Element
Method. Unfortunately, however, their scheme is not so simple to remove the
difficulty stemming from large density ratio at the boundary between liquid
and gas as will be discussed later on.
Let us now start with the description of the ICE in a most compact and
generalized way. In both the ICE and the PISO, conservation equations of
mass and momentum are used in a finite difference form

Nextly if we assume that density changes in proportion to pressure change,

change,

and finaly get an equation :
(27)
Original PISO is more complicated because it repeats this predictor-corrector
algorithm by a few times and some complication appears to diagonalize H
term to solve Eq.(26) in terms of up .
2.6
CCUP method
Yabe et al.[9] darely used primitive Euler form to construct pressure equation
instead of conservative form. Furthermore, advection part is separated from
the other terms, since the advection term can be processed being free from
CFL condition in semi-Lagrangian procedure. Fortunately, this splitting led
to an unexpected advantage to the solution in multi-phase flow as shown
below.
Original CCUP method [9] was proposed only for a special equation of
state like Eq.(24), but here we rebuild it with more general EOS [30]. That
is, for small change of density and temperature, the pressure change can be
linearly proportional to them as
(28)
where Llp means the pressure change pn+I - p' during one time step and *
is the profile after advection. This applies also to p, T . From this relation,

68
Takashi Yabe
once dp, dT are predicted, dp will be predicted based on Eq.(28). Needless
to say, op/op,op/oT are given by EOS.
Since the CIP separates the non-advection terms from the advection, we
can concentrate on the non-advection terms related to sound waves which
are the primary cause of the difficulty in liquid having large sound speed and
hence p, T are simply given by
dp = - p*\1 . un+!dt
p*CudT = -PTH\1 · un+!dt
(29)
where C; is the specific heat ratio at constant volume. un+! in this equation
is given by equation of motion as
\1pn+!
du= ---dt
p*
(30)
Since du = un+! - u*, Eqs.(28)-(30) leads to a pressure equation [9,301

)
pn+l - p*
\1 . u*

(31)
Then substituting the given pn+! into Eq.(30), we obtain the velocity
un+! and then density pn+! from Eq.(29). From this procedure, density can
be solved in terms of pressure which is analogous to rotate Fig.3 by 90 degree.
Equation (31) has many important features in the following points. This
equation shows that, at the sharp discontinuity, n . (\1p/ p) is continuous.
Since \1p/p is the acceleration, it is essential that this term is continuous
since the density changes by several orders of magnitude at the boundary
between liquid and gas. In this case, the denominator of \1p/p changes by
several orders and pressure gradient must be caulcuated accurately enough
to ensure the continuous change of acceleration. Equations (25) and (27)
derived by the ICE and the PISa seems to be quite similar to Eq.(31) but
the continuity of \1p/p in the formers is not guaranteed. Thus, the method
works robustly even with a density ratio larger that 1000.
It is interesting to examine the meaning of this pressure equation. If \1 . u
term is absent, this equation is merely the diffusion equation. The origin of
this term is as follows. During time step dt, the sound wave propagate for a
distance Csdt. In the next step, the signal also propagates backwardly and
forwardly since sound wave should isotropically propagate . Then statisti-
cally, 50% propagates backwardly and another 50% forwardly. This process
is similar to random walk. The diffusion coefficient of the random walk is
given by the quivering distance dx = Csdt as D = dx2 / dt. This leads to
the diffusion equation for pressure. From this consideration, we understand
how the effect of sound waves is implemented.

Summary
We have proposed a new tool to attack the simultaneous solution of all the
materials. The success of the code is due to a high ability of tracing sharp
interface even with fixed grid and flexibility of extension to various materials
and physics. Before closing this paper, we should remind the reader that the
code has been applied to various problems which have never been attacked
by conventional schemes . Figure 4 shows a snap shot of Milk-crown forma-
tion that has been published before [31,32] and the crown formation is quite
sensitive to ambient gas pressure.

Abstract. In recent times, several attempts have been made to recover some in-
formation from the subgrid scales and transfer them to the computational scales .
Many stabilizing techniques can also be considered as part of this effort. We discuss
here a framework in which some of these attempts can be set and analyzed.
1
Introduction
In the numerical simulation of a certain number of problems, there are phys-
ical effects that take place on a scale which is much smaller than the smallest
one representable on the computational grid, but have a strong impact on
the larger scales, and, therefore, cannot be neglected without jeopardizing
the overall quality of the final solution.
In other cases, the discrete scheme lacks the necessary stability properties
because it does not treat in a proper way the smallest scales allowed by the
computational grid. As a consequence, some"smallest scale mode" appears as
abnormally amplified in the final numerical results. Most types of numerical
instabilities are produced in this way, as the checkerboard pressure mode
for nearly incompressible materials, or the fine-grid spurious oscillations in
convection-dominated flows. See for instance [19] and the references therein
for a classical overview of several types of these and other instabilities of this
nature.
In the last decade it has become clear that several attempts to recover
stability, in these cases, could be interpreted as a way of improving the sim-
ulation of the effects of the smallest scales on the larger ones. By doing that,
the small scales can be seen by the numerical scheme and therefore be kept
under control.
These two situations are quite different, in nature and scale. Nevertheless
it is not unreasonable to hope that some techniques that have been developed
for dealing with the latter class of phenomena might be adapted to deal with
the former one. In this sense, one of the most promising technique seems
to be the use of Residual-Free Bubbles (see e.g. [10], [18].) In the following
sections, we are going to summarize the general idea behind it, trying to
underline its potential and its limitations. In Section 2 we present the contin-
uous problems in an abstract setting, and provide examples of applications,

related to advection dominated flows, composite materials, and viscous in-
compressible flows. For application of these concepts to other problems we
refer, for instance, to [13], [14], [16], [18], [24]. In Section 3 we introduce the
basic features of the RFB method. Starting from a given discretization (that
might possibly be unstable), we discuss the suitable bubble space that can be
added to the original finite element space. Increasing the space with bubbles
leads to the augmented problem, usually infinite dimensional, which, in the
end, will have to be solved in some suitable approximate way. In Section 4
we give an idea of how error estimates can be deduced for the augmented
problem. In Section 5 we discuss the related computational aspects, and we
present several strategies that can be used to deal with the augmented prob-
lem, in order to minimize the computational cost. We shall see in particular
that several other methods that are known in the literature can actually be
seen as variants of the RFB procedure, in which one or another of the above
strategies is employed. This includes, for advection dominated problems, the
classical SUPG methods (as it was already well known, see, e.g., [4]) as well
as the older Petrov-Galerkin methods based on suitable operator dependent
choices of test and trial functions [25]. For composite materials, this includes
both the multiscale methods of [22]' [23]' and the upscaling methods of [1],
[2]. Finally, in Section 6 we draw some conclusions.

The continuous problem
We consider the following continuous problem
{
find u E V such that
L:(u,v) =< f,v >
Vv E V,
(2.1)
where V
is a Hilbert space, and V' its dual space, L:(u, v) is a continu-
ous bilinear form on V x V, and f
E V'is the forcing term. We assume
that, for all f
E V', problem (2.1) has a unique solution. Various prob-
lems of interest for the applications can be written in the variational form
(2.1), according to different choices of the space V and the bilinear form L:.
Typical choices for V , when V is a space of scalar functions, are the follow-
ing: if 0
C R d , (d = 1, 2, 3) denotes a generic domain, V could be, for in-
stance, L2(0), Hl(O) , HJ(O), H 2(O) or L5(0), the last one being the space
of L2-functions having zero mean value. In the case where V is a space of
vector valued functions, a first choice could be to take the cartesian product
of the previous scalar spaces. Other typical choices for V can be:
H(divi 0) := {r E (L 2(0))d such that V'. -r E L 2(0)},
Ho(div;O) := {r E H(diviO) such that r· n = 0 on aO} ,

75
or also, for a generic domain 0 C R 3 ,
H(curl; 0) := {T E (L 2(0))3 such that 'iJ 1\ T E (L 2(0))3}
Ho(curl; 0) := {T E H(curl;0) such that T 1\ n = 0 on aO}.
Product spaces are also used quite often: for instance, H(div; 0) x L2(0), or
(HJ(O))d x L5(0), etc . Next, we provide some classical examples of problems
and we indicate the corresponding space V, the bilinear form .c, and the
variational formulation.
Ex 2.1: Advection-dominated scalar equations:
-cLlu + c . 'iJu = f
in n ;
u = 0 on an
V := HJ(n); ci« v):= L c'iJu · 'iJvdx + L
c · v« vdx; (1,v) := L fv dx
.c(u,v)=<f,v>
VvEV
Ex 2.2: Linear elliptic problems with composite materials:
-'iJ . (o:(x)'iJu) = f

u = 0 on an
V := HJ(n);
.c(u,v) := L a(x)'iJu· 'iJvdx;
< f,v > := L fvdx
.c(u,v)=<f,v>
VVEV
(where o:(x) ~ 0:0 > 0 might have a very fine structure).

previous example, but now with:

V := Ex P;
E := H(div; n);
P := L2(n )
ao(CT,T) := L o:-lCT.Tdx,
b(T,ep) := L'iJ·TepdX
.c((CT, 'I/J), (T,ep)) := ao(CT, T) - b(T, 'I/J) + b(CT,ep); < f, (T, ep) > := L [ip da:
.c((CT,'I/J), (T,ep)) =< f,(T,ep) >
V(T,ep) E V
Ex 2.4 : Stokes problem for viscous incompressible fluids:
-Llu + 'iJp = f

V := U x Q;
U := (HJ(n))d ;
Q := L5(n)

b(v,q):= L'iJ·vqdX
.c((u,p), (v, q)) := al(u,v) - b(v,p) + b(u, q); < f, (v, q) > := L f· vdx

From the discrete problem to the augmented
problem
Let Th be a decomposition of the computational dom ain fl , with the usual
nondegeneracy conditions [12], and let Vh
C V be a finite element space.
The original discrete problem is then:
{
find Uh E Vh such that
£.(Uh ,Vh) =< I, Vh >
'VVh E Vh.
(3.1)
Note that we do not assume that (3.1) has a unique solution. Indeed, the
stabilization that we are going to introduce can, in some cases, take care of
problems originally ill-posed. Our aim is, essentially, to solve in the end a
final linear system having as many equations as the number of degrees of
freedom of Vh . Apart from that, we are ready to pay some extra work, in
order to have a better method. In some cases, the total amount of additional
work will be small. In other cases, it can be huge. However, we want to be
able to perform the extra work independently in each element so that we can
do it, as a pre-processor , in parallel. This implies that we are ready to add
as many degrees of freedom as we want at the interior of each element. For
that, to V and Th we associate the maximal space of bubbles
B(V jTh) = II Bv(K),
K
with Bv(K) = {v E V : supp(v) ~ K}.
Let us give some exampl es of the dependence of Bv (K) on V .
• if V = HJ(fl) then Bv(K) = HJ(K)
• if V = H1(fl) then Bv(K) = {v E H1(K) , v = a on 8K n fl}
• if V = L2(fl) then Bv(K) = L2(K)
• if V =
L~(fl) then Bv (K) =
L~(K)
• if V = Hg(fl) th en Bv(K) = Hg(K)
• if V = Ho(divjfl) then Bv(K) = Ho(divjK)
• if V = H(divjfl) then Bv(K) = {r E H(divjK) , r·n = aon 8Knfl}
Similar definitions and properties hold for the spaces H (curh 0), but we are
not going to use them here.
Let us now turn to the choice of the local bubble space Bh(K) . If possible,
we would like to augment the space Vh by adding, in each element K, the
whole Bv(K) . This would change Vh into Vh + B(V jTh). However, some
conditions are needed, as we shall see below. This might forbid , in some cases,
to take the whole Bv (K) in the augmentation process: some components of
Bv(K) have to be discard ed. This will become more clear in the examples
below. At this very abstract and general level, we assume that, in each K E
Th , we choose a subspace Bh(K) ~ Bv(K) and, for the moment, "the bigger

Subgrid Phenomena and Numerical Schemes
77
the better" . A first condi tion that we require is that, for every 9 E V', the
auxiliary problem
{
find WB,K E Bh(K) such that
£(WB,K,V) =< g,v >
'Vv E Bh(K)
(3.2)
has a unique solution. We point out that the choice "the bigger the better"
for Bh(K) is made (so far) in order to understand the full potential of the
method. As we shall see, in practice we will need to solve (3.2) a few times
in each K . This implies that a finite dimensional choice for Bh(K) will be,
in the end, necessary.
Having chosen Bh(K), we can now write the augmented problem. For
that, let
(3.3)
Two requirements have to be fulfilled: first of all, in (3.3) we must have a
direct sum, and, second, for every f E V', the augmented problem
{
find UA E VA such that
£(UA, VA) =< f, VA >
'VVA E VA
(3.4)
must have a unique solution. To summarize, in the augmentation process
three conditions have to be fulfilled:
1) the local problems (3.2) must have a unique solution;
2) in (3.3) we must have a direct sum;
3) the augmented problem (3.4) must have a unique solution.
These are then the requirements that can guide us in choosing Bh(K) in the
various cases.
Examples of choices of Bh(K).
Ex 3.1 - Referring to Examples 2.1 and 2.2 of the previous section, suppose
that Vh is made of continuous piecewise linear functions. In this case it is
easy to check that the choice Bh(K) = Bv(K) == HJ(K) verifies all of the
three conditions.
Ex 3.2 - Suppose now that, always referring to Examples 2.1 and 2.2, Vh is
made of continuous piecewise cubic functions. The choice Bh(K) = Bv(K) is
not viable anymore, as clearly condition 2) is violated: Vh contains functions
of Bv(K). In situations like this we should then choose a different Bh(K),
but we could also reduce the original space Vh. This is actually the simplest
strategy, and we are going to follow it. Here, for instance, we can just remove
the cubic bubble from Vh jK and take a reduced space, still denoted by Vh with
an abuse of notation, as a space of any serendipity cubic element (see, for

78
Franco Brezzi and Donatella Marini
instance, the element described in [12], page 50). Or we might take Vh as the
space of functions Vh that are polynomials of degree :s; 3 at the interelement
boundaries and verify LVh = 0 separately in each K . Notice that these two
choices produce the same augmented space VA, and hence the same solution
UA to (3.4).
Ex 3.3 - Let us consider the problem of Example 2.3, and assume that
Vh =
Eh X Ui, is made by lowest order Raviart-Thomas elements (see for
instance [3]). For this problem we have
Bv(K) = {T E H(div; K) , T ' n = 0 on 8K n f2} x L 2(K).
we notice now that taking Bh(K) = Bv(K) would not guarantee that prob-
lems (3.2) have a unique solution. Indeed, for internal elements K , the Inf-sup
condition is not verified, since JK dun: V dx = 0 forall v constant on K . Con-
dition 2) would also be violated by the choice Bh(K) = Bv(K) : in fact , Uh
being the space of piecewise constants, UhlK contains bubbles of L2(K). A
possible remedy in this case is to take
Bh(K) = Ho(div ;K) x L5(K) c Bv(K).
With this choice Vh remains the same, and Bi, is the space of all pairs (T,v) E
V such that T has zero normal component at the boundary of each element,
and v has zero mean value in each element. The same choice for B h would
be suitable also in the case of higher order Raviart-Thomas spaces (or, say,
for BDM spaces; see always [3]), but then Vh should lose all internal degrees
of freedom , apart from the piecewise constant scalars.
Ex 3.4 - Let us now examine the Stokes problem of Example 2.4, and assume
that Vh is made of piecewise quadratic velocities in (HJ (f2) )d, and discon-
tinuous piecewise linear pressures in L5(f2), a choice which is known not to
be stable, but can be stabilized with the present technique. Actually, in this
case one can see that Bv(K) = (HJ(K))d x L5(K). Taking Bh(K) = Bv(K)
would violate condition 2), but we can reduce the space Vh, taking it to be
the space of quadratic velocities and constant pressures. It is easy to check
that with this last choice we have a direct sum in (3.3). Moreover, problem
(3.4) has a unique solution, because the Inf-sup condition is now verified in
VA·
Ex 3.5 - Let us consider again the Stokes problem of Example 2.4, but
now with Vh = Uh X Qh made of piecewise linear continuous velocities in
(HJ(f2))d, and piecewise constant pressures in L5(f2). It is well known that
for this choice the Inf-sup condition does not hold. Moreover, if we augment
Vh with bubble functions, no matter how, the augmented problem (3.4) will
never verify the Inf-sup condition. To see that, augment as much as you can
the velocity space: UA = Ui, + IIK(HJ(K))d, and augment as little as you
can the pressure space: QA = Qh + {O}. For every v E (HJ(K))d and for

Subgrid Phenomena and Numerical Schemes
79
every constant q in K, we clearly have (divv,q) = O. Hence, for q E Qh:
(divv,q)
(divv,q)
sup
= sup
,
VEVA
llvlh
VEUh
Ilvlll
and we know that the last quantity cannot bound Ilqllo for all q E Qh. We
clearly see that, in cases like this, our strategy is totally useless, and should
not be applied.
4
An example of error estimates
To give an idea of how to proceed to obtain error estimates, let us consider,
as an example, a general singular perturbation problem where
L(u, v) := cal (u, v) + ao(u, v)
with
al(v,v) 2: Qllvll~
Vv E V,
al(u,v)::; Iluliv llvl!v
Vu,v E V
(4.1)
ao(v,v) 2: 0
Vv E V,
ao(u,v)::; Mllullv IlvllH
Vu,v E V
(4.2)
where H is a space such that V c H with continuous embedding. We set
e := u - UA and 17 := u - UI, U I being some interpolant of u in Vh. Proceeding
as usual we have
wllell~ ::; L(e, e) = L(e, 'T/) = €al(e, 17) + ao(e,17),
(4.3)
and the term ao(e, 'T/) is the source of all difficulties, since it does not contain
e as an explicit factor. In order to estimate it, let
'T/ =
17B + 17H be any
decomposition of 'T/ with 'T/B E Bi, and 17H E H . Notice that 'T/B E Bh eVA,
so that, by Galerkin orthogonality,
(4.4)
Using this and the bounds (4.1)-(4.2) we can proceed as in [9] and deduce:
ao(e,'T/) = ao(e,'T/B) +ao(e,'T/H) = -€aI(e,'T/B) +aO(e,'T/H)
::; ellellvll'T/Bllv+ Mllellvll17HIIH
::; el/2(el/21Iellvll'T/Bllv+ M e- I / 21Iellvll'T/H IIH)
(4.5)
::; el/2(1 + M)llellv (e
1
/ 21117Bllv + e- I / 21117HIIH).
Taking now the supremum over all possible decompositions 'T/ = 'T/B +'T/H, and
then over e > 0 we obtain
ao(e, 'T/) ::; el/2(1+ M)lleliv sup [
sup
(el/2 11'T/Bllv + e- I / 211'T/HIIH)]'
e:>O
T/B+1/H=T/
(4.6)

80
Franco Brezzi and Donatella Marini
By definition (see [7]) the double supremum is the norm of 1] in a suitable
interpolation space, usually denoted by [Bh' HI!,oo, that for brevity we shall
denote by F. Hence, (4.6) becomes
(4.7)
Inserting (4.7) in (4.3) gives
mllell~ S; €al(e, 1]) + ao(e,17) S; e1/ 21Iellv(e1/ 2111]llv + (1+ M)11171IF),
and finally
e1/2allu - uAllv S;e1/211u - ulliv + (1+ M)llu - uIIiF .
(4.8)
Notice that an estimate for e1/ 21Iu - UAllv is not as bad as we are used to. For
instance, with an argument similar to the one used before, using (4.4)-(4.5),
from (4.8) we can see that
ao(u - UA,cp)
IIAo(u - uA)IIFI := s~p
IIcpllF
ao(u - UA, CPB) + ao(u - UA, CPH)
= s~p
II'PIIF
-cal(U - UA,'PB) + ao(u - UA,CPH)
= s~p
II'PIIF
S; (1+ M)e1/21Iu - UAllvs~p el/21IcpBllvll:I~;1/2I1cpHIIH
S; (1 + M)e1/21Iu - uAllv S; C(e1/21Iu- ulliv + Ilu - uIIIF),
which is a typical estimate that can be obtained with stabilized methods (see,
e.g., [22], [27]). We refer to [6], [9], [281 for the error analysis for residual-free
bubbles methods for advection dominated problems.
5
Computational aspects
Let us now examine the structure of the abstract augmented problem (3.4).
Since we constructed the space VA as a direct sum:
we have then the unique splittings: UA
= UB + Uh, VA
= VB + Vh. The
augmented problem can then be written as
{
find UA = UB + Uh E VA such that
£(UB + Uh,VB + Vh) =< f,VB +Vh >
(5.1)

81
The associated system will therefore have the form:
with LB,B block diagonal.
There are different strategies for solving the (still infinite dimensional) prob-
lem (5.1). All of them are based on the (approximate) solution ofthe problems
{
find wk E s, such that
.c(wk, VB) = .c(Vi,VB) =< LVi,VB >
(5.2)
where the {Vi}'S are a basis for Vh , plus, if necessary, the solution of the
problem
{
find w~ E e, such that
.c(w~,VB) =< I, VB >
VVB E Bi;
(5.3)
As we shall see, what is actually needed, for all strategies, is the computation
(for i ,j = 1, ...,dim(Vh)) of the quantities
Sj,i := .c(wk,Vj) =< wk, L*vj >,
and
Tj := .c(w~ , Vj) =< w~, L*vj >,
(5.4)
where L * is the adjoint operator of L . In turn, the computation of the solution
of the problems (5.2) amounts to solve, in each K, the local bubble problem
{
find Wk,K E Bh(K) such that
.c(Wk,K,b) =< LVi, b >
Vb E Bh(K).
(5.5)
The same is obviously true for (5.3). Moreover, f can often be approximated,
in each K, by elements of LVhIK, so that the solution of (5.3) can be easily
obtained from the solutions of the problems (5.2).
A careful inspection of the local problems (5.5) suggests several observa-
tions that are computationally relevant.
• For each Vi , the computation of wk can be done in parallel.
• In each element K, the dimension of span{LViIK} will be small. In general,
it will be less than or equal to the number of degrees of freedom of Vh in K .
• Finally, as we already pointed out, only the quantities Sj,i =< wk, L*vj >
are actually needed. Hence, only some averages of wk will be used, and
therefore a rough approximation might often be sufficient.
• The same considerations clearly hold for the contributions Tj to the right-
hand side.

5.1
First strategy
Let us see in more detail how the whole procedure can be applied in practice.
For this, consider problem (5.1) and note that U B is the solution of
and can be seen as an (affine) function of Uh and f:
Substituting into (5.1), and taking now Vh as a test function, gives
(5.6)
which is an equation in terms of Uh alone, where the additional term
(5.7)
represents the effect of the small scales onto the coarse ones. To see how to
compute the additional term (5.7) let us write Uh := L:iU iVi and take Vj as
a test funct ion. We have
that clearly shows the use of the auxiliary terms T j and Sj,i' Indeed, setting
and
(5.8)
we have from (5.6) that the Ui 's can be obtained as the solution of the
following linear syst em of equations:
""(K· · - S · ·) U· = F- - T ·

Example - To see how this st rategy can be applied, let us go back to the
advection-dominated equation, that we recall here:
-cL1u + C . 'lu = f
in V;
U = 0 on an,
v := Hci(V);
£ (u,v) :=lr-> :kC ''lU VdX.
Assume that the original finit e element space Vh is made of piecewise linear
continuous functions. Assume moreover that both the source term f and the
convective term C are piecewise constant . Then, it is easy to see that for all

(5.10)
Subgrid Phenomena and Numerical Schemes
83
Vi the terms LVi and L*vi are constant in each K . Consequently, all the wk
can be computed by solving a single problem in each K, that is
{
find b« E HJ(K) such that
£(bK ,b) =< 1,b >
Vb E HJ(K).
With some computations, the problem becomes now (see, e.g., [4]):
{
find Uh E Vh such that, for all Vh E Vh :
",JKbKdx r
(5.11)
£(Uh' Vh) - 7
IKI
J)I - c . V'Uh)C' V'Vh dx =< I, Vh > .
This coincides with the SUPG method with TK = JKt:1 dx (see [11], [16]).
5.2
Alternative computational strategies
Another possibility is to change the space Vh : for every basis function Vi E Vh,
define
and remember that wk was defined by
£(Wk ,VB) = £(Vi ,VB)
Therefore,
(5.12)
(5.13)
(5.14)
Set now Vh =
span {Vi}' and notice that, again, VA = Vh EB Bh. Split then
UA as UA = Uh + UB , with Uh in l\, and UB in Bh. Then, thanks to (5.14),
UB is the solution of
(5.15)
Hence UB equals w~, solution of (5.3) , and can be computed before knowing
Uh . Finally, Uh can be computed as the solution of
(5.16)
with the same number of unknowns and equations as the dimension of Vh . It
is interesting to observe that the difference between this and the first strategy
is mainly psycological. Indeed, setting Uh := Ei UiVi , we have from (5.12) ,
(5.8), and (5.4)
£(ih,vj) = L£(Vi,Vj)Ui = L£(Vi - wk,vj)Ui = L(Kj,i - Sj,i) ii..

"'(K · - S·) ii. = Y - T ·

J
j = 1, ...,dim(Vh) ,
(5.18)
which is exactly (5.9).
A third possibility would be, assuming that the adjoint problem of (5.13) is
uniquely solvable, to define wk solution of
(5.19)
and to associate to any Vi, basis function in Vh, the function
(5.20)
Therefore, Vi is the solution of
(5.21)
Set then V; = span {Vi}, and notice that, in general, V; will be different
from Vh, unless the bilinear form £ is symmetric. We have again VA = V; +
Bh , always with a direct sum. Take now in (5.1) for UA the same splitting
as before, that is, UA = Uh + UB, with Uh E Vh, UB E Bh, and for VA take
instead the splittig VA = Vh +VB, with Vh E V;, VB E Bh, always without
changing the final solution UA . Substituting in (5.1) shows that UB is again
the solution of (5.15). Hence, as before, UB equals w~, and can be computed
before knowing Uh . Finally, Uh can be computed as the solution of
The matrix associated with (5.22) is however given by
L(ih,vj) = L(Vi,Vj - w1) = L(Vi,Vj) = Kj ,i - Sj,i
(having used (5.20) , (5.14), and (5.17)) . On the other hand,
and, using (5.3), (5.19), and (5.4),
< j, w1 >= L(w~,w1) = L(w~, Vj) = Tj •
(5.22)
(5.23)
(5.24)
(5.25)
We are therefore back to the system (5.18). It is somehow remarkable that the
solution of (5.22) can be computed without actually computing the functions
Vj.
Remark Although the above strategies, as we have seen, do coincide in prac-
tice, this is not often recognized in the literature. For instance, formulations
(5.16) and (5.22), when applied to advection dominated problems coincide

Subgrid Phenomena and Numerical Schemes
85
with the classical so-called Petrov-Galerkin methods in which suitable trial
and test functions, depending on the operator, were used (see [25], and see,
in Fig . 1, the typical shape of the basis functions in Vh and Vh') . The above
computation shows that these methods coincide with SUPG when the choice
of the stabilization parameter TK is made as in (5.11). On the other hand,
when applied to problems related to composite materials, as in Example 2.2
(respectively, Example 2.3), the formulation (5.22) reproduces the multiscale
methods of [22] , [23] and the upscaling method of [1], [2]' respectively.

So far , we assumed that we were able to compute the solutions of the local
bubble problems (5.2). As anticipated, these solutions cannot be computed
exactly, but require some suitable approximation. Let us see, in the particular
case of advection dominated problems, how this approximate solutions can
be carried out in practice.
We recall that, in this case, solving (5.15) amounts in practice to compute,
in each K , the "unitary bubble" btc , solution of
- eL1bK + c . \1bK = 1
in each K.
(5.26)
Actually, what we really need is its mean value in each K (see (5.11)).
Several tricks can be used to compute fK btc dx .
• A possibility is to solve by hand the pure convective problem, as advo cated
in [10]:
{
find!K E H1(K) such that
c . \1bK = 1 in K ,
bK = 0 on 8K- (= inflow)
Notice that the integral of b« on K is just the volume of a pyramid , as
shown in Fig. 2.
• Another possibility is to solve (5.26) on a subgrid with very few degrees of
freedom , but well chosen (e.g., Pseudo RFB [8], Shishkin [17], etc, see Fig. 3).
Typically few nodes in the element boundary layer are needed.

• As an alternative, one could use subgrid artificial viscosity; that means
solving , instead of (5.26), the problem
-(C + cA)L\bK + C· \1bK = 1
in each K
on a very rough grid (typically, one node), where CA is a suitably chosen
artificial viscosity, in general c:::: li« (see [20]). Unfortunately, the problem of
the optimal choice for cA is rather delicate. Indeed, using a one-dimensional
space Bh(K) = span {,8K(X)} results in an SUPG method with
UK,8dx)2
as shown in [5]. This implies that the bigger is CA the smaller is TK, that
is, we add artificial viscosity for stabilizing and we decrease the stabilization
parameter.

Conclusions
The Residual Free Bubble approach offers a unified framework for setting and
analyzing several two-level and/or stabilized methods. It consists, essentially,

Subgrid Phenomena and Numerical Schemes
87
in augment ing a given finite element space with spaces of functions having
support in a single element . The necessary requirements for this augmentation
pro cess have been introduced and discussed for several examples. The split
nature of the bubble space allows to eliminate the additional unknowns with
an element by element pro cedure, that can be carried out in parallel. The
elimination process involves in general the approximate solution of a partial
differential equation in each element. We have seen however that in many
cases a rough approximat ion can be sufficient.
The use of this type of approach for stabilizing unstable finite element
formulations were already well known. Here we presented the method in a
very general sett ing, and this allowed us to show that several other methods
for stabilizing and, mostly, for dealing with subgrid phenomena, can actually
be seen as a particular case of the RFB approach. This includes, on one
side, old methods like the Petrov Galerkin methods with special, operator
dependent, trial and test functions for advection dominated problems, as
well as more recent approaches like the multiscale method or the upscaling
method for problems with composite materials.
Other developments and applications to different problems are surely
worth further investigations, as well as some recent variants like the use
of non-conforming bubbles, the possibility of adding edge-bubbles, or the
connections with domain decomposition methods.

Two Scale FEM for Homogenization
Problems*

Abstract. We analyze generalized Finite Element Methods for the numerical so-
lution of elliptic problems with coefficients or geometries which are oscillating at
a small length scale E. Two-scale elliptic regularity results which are uniform in E
are presented. Two-scale FE spaces are introduced with error estimates that are
uniform in
E . They resolve the E scale of the solution with work independent of
E and without analytical homogenizations. Numerical experiments confirming the
theory are presented.

Introduction
The accurate and efficient numerical solution of partial differential equations involv-
ing length scales that differ by many orders of magnitude has received increasing
attention recently, due in part to t he increasing miniaturization and manufacturing
capabili ties in engineering. For example, lattice materials or electronic circuit boards
are assembled out of many basic building blocks of small size into larger macro-
scopic structures. Scale resolution, i.e. the direct numerical solution of boundary
value problems in multiple scale structures by standard methods such as the Finite
Element Method (FEM) is infeasible if the difference in scales is sufficiently large
and the FE mesh is refined to the smallest scale.

Modelling approaches try to account for the effect of the small scales in the
problem on the macroscopic solution behaviour analytically and to circumvent the
requirement of scale resolution in the numerical solution of the problem. In this
process, information on the fine scale behaviour of the solution is lost and cannot
be recovered numerically since the modelling error is not a discretization error.
Here we consider a different approach if the solution contains several length
scales differing by orders of magnitude and these scales are separated, i.e, the spatial
variation of the solution is concentrated at length scales which are a-priori known or
can be estimated. In between these scales, only a small part of the solution energy
is concentrated. If, in addition, the fine-scale data contains regular patterns, the
resolution of this scale is possible with substantially fewer degrees of freedom than
(uniform or adaptive) mesh refinem ent which assumes a rather uniform distribution
of solution scales. In the present paper, we illustrate this idea for the numerical
solution of elliptic homogenization problems in divergence form . The present paper
is a short version of [6] where full proofs shall be given.

Finite Element Discretization
The variational form of (1), (5), (6) reads
Find u" E Hb(fJ,,) : a(u" ,v) = (f,v)
'Vv E Hb(fJ,,) ,
(7)
where Hb(fJ,,) := {u E H1(fJe)
: (5) holds for u} . By (3), (7) admits a unique
solution u" E Hb(fJ,,) for every e > 0 and every f E L 2(fJ).
Let VfJ C Hb(fJ,,) be any subspace of dimension N = dim (ViJ) < 00 . The
Finite Element Method for (7)
u7v E VfJ : a(u7v, v) = (f,v)
'Vv E VfJ
defines a unique FE solution u7v and
(8)
(9)
where C> 0 is independent of e, i.e. the FE-error is bounded by the best approx-
imation of u" from VfJ . Finite Element convergence of u7v is therefore related to
regularity of u" in dependence on the scale parameter e.
Even if the right hand side f, the domain fJ" and the coefficients A and ao
are smooth, for e/diam(fJ) « 1 the solution u" exhibits oscillations on the e-
scale. These in turn stall the convergence of standard FEM: consider for illustration
Q = [0,It. Then a, = fJ and

on a quasiuniform mesh TH of meshwidth H, it holds

Trivially, we have also that
It follows therefore that the FE error with respect to the usual FE space VN
Sp,l (D, TH) satisfies the following a-priori bounds
lIu' -
u~IIHl ( nc ) ::; Cmin(l, (H/e) P),
with C = C(p, D, I, A,ao) > 0 a constant independent of e and H. Standard FEM,
as e.g., piecewise linears on a quasiuniform mesh TH of size H , thus converge only
if H < e, i.e., if N = dim VN= O(e- n ) . This scale resolution requirem ent is often
prohibitive, especially if n ~ 3.
1.3
Scale separation and outline of the paper
In view of (9), the key to robust approximations is the design of VN. Rather than
incorporating the asymptotics of u' (which is not always defined, see [1,81 and the
references there) into the FE-space VN, we design VN based on a refined regular-
ity theory of u'. To this end, ignoring boundary conditions (5) for the moment,
we consider (1) on the unbounded domain D':' in (4). For any I E L2(lle), (1),
(6) admits a unique solution u' E H:" ,,(D':') , the weighted HI-space with weight
exp(vl xl) , 0 < v ::; vo(,). This solution u' can be written in the form [7,4,3]

Problem (1) has separated scales, a slow variable x and a fast variable y = xfe,
in the following sense: the kernel 'l/J in (11) (which is, in a sense, the fine scale
response to the coarse scale excitation eit.x ) can be written in the form 'l/J(x,e,t) =
eit.X¢( ~,e, t) where ¢(y, s, t) is the solution of the so-called unit-cell problem: find
¢ E H~er (Q) such that
£(e, t ,y; Oy)¢ := e-i't.yL'(y,e-Ioy)ei't.y¢ = 1 in Q,
(12)
Unlike is in (11) , the kernel ¢ is computable by solving the unit-cell problem (12)
numerically, for example (but not necessarily) with finite elements. In the the re-
mainder of this note, we present approaches for the design of FE- spaces VN which
give e-Independent convergence. We pro ceed as follows: First , based on the rep-
resentation (10), we see that on D':' (Le., in the absence of boundary layers ) the
solution u' (x) can be viewed as a map from the 'slow' variable x ED (not in D, )
into the 'fast' vari able x]« E Q. Two-scale regul arity results on u'(x) which are
uniform in e are obtained by analysing this map and we present these in Section

2. The two-scale point of view of regularity gives rise to a 'natural ' FE discretiza-
tion of (1) by means of a non-standard two-scale FE-space ViJ in a< constructed
as follows: Let TH be a quasiuniform 'macro' mesh in a (not in a<, i.e., the fine
structure of the coefficients is ignored) of meshwidth H and denote by SP(a, TH)
the usual FE-space of continuous, piecewise polynomials of degree p on TH (we
assume also for convenience that TH is aligned with the periodic pattern in a.).
We discretize the unit-cell problem (12) by a FEM in Q, based on the mesh Th (for
simplicity also quasiuniform of width h), and the space Ster(Q, Th).The 2-scale FE
space ViJ in (9) is then the Bochner space
(13)
Since {I} ~ Ster(Q,7;.), SP(a,TH ) ~ ViJ and ViJ is a generalized FE-space.
With V<N in (8) robust convergence rates as h,H -+ 0 can be achieved for u~ as we
shall show in Section 3. These 2-scale approximation results are quite general and
applicable whenever the solution has the 2-scale regularity; in particular, the rep-
resentation (10) which is valid only in a linear setting is not necessary. In contrast,
in [3-5) a different (in general smaller) space ViJ than (13) was proposed. In that
approach the kernel ¢(y, s, t) in (12) is incorporated directly in the FE-space via
shape functions ¢(y, e,t) sampled at suitable points tj in the frequency domain.

Two scale regularity
As in the two-scale asymptotics in e.g. [1,8), we separate the slow from the fast
scales. We do not expand u«x) asymptotically, however, but rather interpret it as
map from the "slow variable" x into the "fast variable" y = x]e:
(14)
for r, s 2: 0 depending on the regularity of the coefficients and of the data f and
where the e-dependence of U< (x, y) is smooth. We consider here only the case when
the unit cell problem admits maximal elliptic regularity and therefore take in (14)
as target space H;er(Q). Then the 2-scale shift theorem holds in standard Sobolev
spaces (if the unit cell has corners as e.g. in Figure 2, the target space H;er(Q) has
to be replaced by a suitable weighted space with weights associated to the corners
in the unit cell) .
Theorem 1. Assume that A(.), aoO are smooth and l-periodic in y = x/c E Q
with Q denoting (O,l)n if TN = 0 or that TN is smooth otherwise. If in addition
f E H:om p (R") (k 2: 0), then the solution u< (x) of (1) on the unbounded domain

provided r + s ~ k + 1, r , s - 1 2:: O. Here, C(k) is independent of e, but depends on

Proof. The proof is based on the Fourier-Bochner integral representation (10) of the
solution u'(x) = U'(x, x/c.) and on two-scale regularity estimates on the Fourier-

Remark 2. The two-scale regularity result is based on (10), i.e, the solution of (1)

Estimates (15), (16) appear to be suboptimal, in terms of the regularity of
the right hand side. They can nevertheless not be improved, if one insists on 10-
independence of the constant G(k), as the following example from [6) shows. We
consider n = 1 and assume that f E L~er(O, 1) has the Fourier expansion f(x) =

Two scale FE convergence
In the previous section we saw that u«x) admits elliptic regularity independent of
the scale parameter in the framework of the two-scale Sobolev spaces H T (Rn, H;er(Q)) .
The two-scale Finite-Element spaces in the Introduction are, in a sense, natural
for the direct discretization of homogenization problems. In the present section we
prove robust approximation properties for two-scale FE-spaces under two-scale reg-
ularity hypothesis on u<(x). In particular, we will generalize h, p and hp convergence
results which are well known for standard FEM to two-scale FEM.

Two-scale approximation results
Recall that the two scale Bochner Finite Element space is given by
Sp(n, TH j S~er(Q , 't)).
(22)
We assume that the domain n is axiparallel and we take TH to be a quasiuniform
triangulation of n of affine quadrilateral elements of size H .1f Q= (0, I)" then we
take Th as well as a quasiuniform mesh in Qofaxiparallel quadrilaterals. For the
case when the unit-cell domain Qhas e.g, interior holes the 'micro' triangulation i;
is obtained as follows. First one assumes the existence of a partition Q = Uf=1 Qi
(I < 00 fixed) of Q in a finite number of patches Qi . Each patch Qi is obtained by
mapping the reference domain (0, I)" via the Coo diffeomorphism F; : (0, l )" -+ Qi.
These mappings satisfy also a compatibility condition in the sense that FioFi; 1 = I d
on Qi n Qil for all i, i' = 1, . .. , I (Fi can be constructed by blending, see also [11)).
The mesh i: is obtained as follows:
with Th being a uniform, affine quadrilateral mesh in the reference domain (0, l )" .
In this case we will mean by S~er(Q ,Th ) the finite element space given by all piece-
wise mapped polynomials of degree /-L of the form

Let K = FK(K) E TH be an element of the 'macro' triangulation, affine image of

Ei(FK(X), y) := W, K(x,y) - IIp,xU'' K(x, y)
+ IIp,xW' K(x,y) - (IIp,x @'Ih,yW" K(x,y).

'micro' FE space S~er(Q, 7;,), the 'micro' error IlK can be estimated as follows
Summing up over all elements K E TH we obtain that

A similar result can be derived also for the energy norm of the two scale inter-
polation error. To this end, we estimate the L 2 (n )-norm of 'Vxei in terms of the
regularity of the data and of the 'macro', resp . 'micro' triangulations .

Similar error estimates for the interpolation error as in Propositions 9, 10 can be
obtained in the case n = 3.
Theorem 11. Assume for the solution u< of (7) the two-scale regularity (15)-
(16) in no' Then, the error in the two-scale FEM based on the space (22) can be

Proof. The proof is a direct consequence of Theorem 1 and Propositions 9, 10.

The previous bounds allow to deduce the convergence rates hand p. Under
analyticity assumptions, even exponential convergence results are possible.

hold with constants independent of c. In this case the estimates in Propositions 9,
10 lead to exponential convergence.
Remark 13. The convergence estimates in Theorem 11 are robust in c. However,
this robustness comes at a price: for n c Rn the number N of degrees of freedom
in the two scale FE space (22) grows, as h = H -. 0 at fixed p, p, for example,
asymptotically as O(h- 2n ) . With the two-scale FEM based on (22), scale reso-
lution and e independent convergence is achieved by inflating the dimension of
the approximation: we resolve the fine scales by simultaneously approximating in
(x ,y) E n x Q C R2n • Tensor product approximations represent full interactions
between scales. The product structure of n x Q and the anisotropic regularity in
Theorem 1 allow, however, to get the convergence in Theorem 11 with substantially
fewer degrees of freedom: the scale interaction is 'thinned out' by means of sparse
tensor products.

Implementation of Two-Scale FEM
In order to obtain an efficient algorithm it is essential that the element stiffness and
mass matrices can be computed in a complexity independent of e and to an accu-
racy which will not compromise the asymptotic convergence rates in Theorem 11.
Due to the rapid oscillations of the coefficients and of the micro-shapefunctions,
the elemental stiffness matrices on the macro mesh can not be evaluated robustly
by standard quadratures, or if the macro mesh TH is not aligned with the periodic
pattern. If TH is aligned, however, the macro stiffness and mass matrices can be
developed from moments, i.e., from integrals in the fast variable corresponding to
discretization of the unit-cell problem with monomial weighted coefficients, com-
bined with certain lattice summation formulas. We will explain this in Section 4.1
and present in Section 4.2 numerical experiments confirming our error analysis.
Proposition 14. For any e > 0 and for any finite dimensional subspace M~er(Q)
of H~er(Q), with M~er(Q) = Span {<Pi (y)}f=l of dimension p, independent of e, the
FEM with respect to the two-scale space SP(n,TH" M~. per(cQ))
(M~. per(cQ) =
Span{<Pi(x/cnf=l) can be implemented with a computational work independent of
c.
The s-independence is achieved by judiciously exploiting the periodicity in the
fast variable.

B(u, v) = L

For each element K of the 'macro' triangulation TH with 'macroscopic' polynomial

Fig. 3. Energy error in the H -Version of the two-scale FEM

Christoph Schwab
The shift Theorem 1 applies in this case on n and the solution does not exhibit
boundary layers, since the scales are separated in the following sense : u€(x) =
U€(x,x/c), with U€(x,y) smooth on n x Qand l-periodic in y.
In Figure 3 we plot the energy error versus H = h and for different p = fJ, E
{I, 2, 3, 4}. Computations were performed for two different s-scales, 10- 2 and 10-4 ,
respectively. We see that the rate of convergence of lIu€ -uj;.EII~l(n) is proportional
to H 2p as expected from the error estimates in Theorem 11. Moreover, we observe
robustness of the convergence rates with respect to the parameter c.
The next set of numerical experiments shows that simultaneous refinement on
both scales is indeed necessary. To that end, calculations for e = 10-4 , fJ, = 1 and
fixed h, p were performed. In Figure 4 we plot the error in energy versus H (for
several fixed p). In agreement with our a-priori estimates O(H2P + h2!-') we observe
a saturation effect.
We remark that for analytic or piecewise analytic U€(x ,y), it is possible to ob-
tain even robust exponential convergence rates of the two-scale FEM. For numerical
examples, we refer to [6).

Abstract. We give theoretical and computational overview of numerical analysis
of the finite element methods for electromagnetics. In particular, theoretical com-
ments on the edge and face elements, frequently employed in the finite element
discretizations, are given . Moreover, we present some iteration methods which are
effective to solve discrete equations arising from finite element methods.

Introduction
Numerical analysis of electromagnetic problems is now quite important in
wide fields of science and engineering. The application of the finite element
method (FEM) to such ends is very effective especially for 3-D problems since
FEM is well suited for complex regions with various boundary conditions. By
appropriate modeling of the Maxwell equations of electromagnetics, we have
a variety of problems describing electromagnetic phenomena in practice.
In FEM, we first derive weak forms to such problems, and then obtain
discrete equations by the finite element procedures. In this process, we often
utilize mixed formulations based on the Lagrange multiplier techniques. Then
the Nedelec type edge elements and the Raviart-Thomas type face ones are
very effective to approximate vector fields with their rotations and/or diver-
gences. They are also well suited to the tangential and normal boundary con-
ditions in electromagnetics, and their effectiveness is now widely recognized
through practical experiences. Although there have been proposed various
approaches without relying on such vector elements, most of them have been
unsuccessful as is known the "nightmare" in computational electromagnetics.
The Raviart-Thomas face elements were proposed in [26], and they have
been generalized in various fashions as summarized in [7]. On the other hand,
basic edge elements of simplex or cube-based shapes were early proposed by
Nedelec [23],124], and then their generalizations such as the covariant inter-
polation elements have been developed [6], [27].
Once the discrete equations are obtained, they must be solved by means
of appropriate computational methods. Since the equations are usually of
very large-scale especially in 3-D cases, we often prefer to reliable iterative
methods even in linear cases.
The outline of this note is as follows. We first present some basic elec-
tromagnetic problems and give them variational formulations, most of them

are of mixed type, either explicitly or implicitly, and easy to implement as
the finite element methods. Then we show the outline of theoretical numeri-
cal analysis of such finite element schemes. Among them, we give comments
on the discrete compactness properties, which are discrete analogs of the
compactness properties of electromagnetic spaces and difficult to check the-
oretically [13]. Finally, we present some computational techniques to solve
discrete equations arising from the finite element discretizations.
2
Electromagnetic problems
First we will explain typical electromagnetic problems with some variational
formulations.
2.1
Maxwell's equations
As is well known, the governing equations of electromagnetics are the Maxwell
partial differential equations, which may be expressed as follows when con-
sidered in a 3-D domain n occupied by the medium :
aB
H
aD
.
rotE+7jt=O,
divD=p,
rot
- at =3 , divB=O in n,
(1)
where "rot" and "div" are the usual differential operators, E is the electric
field, H the magnetic field, D the electric flux density, B the magnetic flux
density, p the electric charge density, j the electric current density, and t the
time variable. Moreover, the following "constitutive" relations are assumed :
D=€E,
B=p,H,
(2)
where € and p, are the dielectric constant and the magnetic permeability of
the medium, respectively. Here, we assume that both s and p, are positive
constants for simplicity.
Of course, appropriate initial and boundary conditions must be imposed
on the fields. For example, when the boundary an of n corresponds to a
perfectly conducting wall, the boundary conditions are given by
Ex n = 0,
B · n = 0 on an,
(3)
where n is the outward unit normal on on,and x and- denote the operations
of vector and scalar products, respectively.
2.2
Basic problems in electromagnetics
By introducing various assumptions and/or simplifications to the original
Maxwell equations, we may obtain a number of model problems in electro-
magnetics. For simplicity, we assume that n c R 3 is a simply-connected

Electrom agnetic Problems
111
bounded Lipschitz domain and that an is connected. Then we can assure
the existence of both the scalar and vector potentials [1). We can explain
some of the essential features of numerical analysis of electromagnetic prob-
lems under such fairly strong conditions on the domain as well as very special
boundary condit ions (3), although it is possible to relax them considerably.
Cavity resonator problem. A typical model problem is the classical cavity
resonator eigenvalue problem, which is essentially to determine non-trivial
time-harmonic electromagnetic fields satisfying the Maxwell equations in a
bounded vacuum cavity surrounded by a perfectly conducting wall.
In this case, the Maxwell equations reduce to
aB
.
eo
rotE + at = 0, div D = 0, rotH -
at
= 0,
div B = 0 in n ,
(4)
with the boundary conditions (3) and the relations (2) for the vacuum:
D = coE ,
B = J1.oH ,
(5)
where co > 0 and J1.o > 0 are the (constant) values of c and J1. for the vacuum.
Introducing the time-harmonic assumption to the above and eliminating
the common factor eiwt , we have, for the spat ial parts of the fields,
rotE = - iwJ1.oH, div E = 0, rotH = iwcoE, div H = 0 in n ,
(6)
E xn=O , H·n=O
on an,
(7)
where i is the imaginary unit and w the angular frequency, and we have also
used the notations of original time-dependent fields as their spatial parts.
The above equations contain two unknown vector functions E and H . If
we eliminate H, we have the following eigenvalue problem in E only :
Cavity resonator problem: E
rot rot E = >..E , div E = 0 in n ; E x n = °on an ,
(8)
where>" = c OJ1.0W 2, which can be shown to be actually real (and positive).
Similarly, by eliminating E , we have the following one in terms of H :
Cavity resonator problem: H
rotrotH=>..H, divH=O in n ; H·n=O, (rot H )x n = O on an. (9)
Electrostatic and magnetostatic problems. It is also essent ial to deter-
mine stationary, i. e., static, states of electromagnetic fields. In such cases, all
the quantities must be independent of the time variable t. Then the governing
equations can be obtained by setting the time derivatives zero in (1) :
rot E = 0,
div D = p,
rot H = i . div B = 0 in n ,
(10)

112
F'umio Kikuchi
along with appropriate boundary conditions. If we employ the static version
of (3) as the boundary conditions, the present problem may be separated into
two, that is, the electrostatic problem and the magnetostatic one :
Electrostatic problem: E, D
rot E = 0 ,
div D = p in D;
E x n = 0 on aD ,
(11)
Magnetostatic problem: H , B
rot H = i . div B = 0 in D;
B . n = 0 on aD.
(12)
In the present case, it is also possible to use the scalar potential ¢ and
the vector one A to deal with the linear relations rot E = 0 and div B = 0 :
Electrostatic problem: ¢
div(cgrad¢)=p in Il ,
¢=O on aD,
Magnetostatic problem : A
(13)
rot(/L-lrotA) = j , div A = 0 in D ;
A x n = 0 on aD .
(14)
Here the Coulomb gauge is imposed on A.
As may be easily seen from the above, the scalar potential formulation
leads to a boundary-value problem of a Poisson-like equation, which can be
dealt with by the classical FEM. On the other hand, the vector potential
formulation gives a fully vector-based system of equations.
There are various other electromagnetic problems such as the eddy current
problems, the forced vibration of dielectric media appearing in the design of
microwave ovens, etc. Fully time-dependent analysis is of course possible, but
it inevitably becomes to be of quite large-scale.
2.3
Function spaces for electromagnetics
Besides the usual spaces L2(D), Hl(D) and HJ(D) , we also use some function
spaces to express our electromagnetic problems mathematically :
H(rot;D) = {UEL2(D)3 j rotuEL2(D)3},
(15)
Ho(rot;D) = {u E H(rot jD); u x n = 0 on aD} ,
(16)
H(rotO;D) = {u E H(rotjD); rotu = A},
(17)
Ho(rotOjD) = Ho(rotjD) n H(rotO; D) ,
(18)
H(divjD) = {u E L2(D)3; divu E L2(Dn,
(19)
Ho(div;D) = {u E H(divjD); u· n = 0 on aD} ,
(20)
H(divo; D) = {u E H(divj D)j div u = O},
(21)
Ho(divOjD) = Ho(divj D) n H(divO; D).
(22)

Electromagnetic Problems
113
These spaces become Hilbert spaces by equipping them with appropriate
inner products, and are effective to describe electromagnetic problems for
homogeneous media. Moreover, we will use (".) and II . II as notations of
the inner products and the norms of both L2(a) and L2(a)3. For details of
the above spaces, especially the definitions of boundary conditions, see e.g.
[7],[14].
2.4
Variational formulations
Let us present some weak or variational formulations to the basic electro-
magnetic problems stated above.
Cavity resonator problem. First we have the following variational formu-
lations by applying the standard approaches to (8) and (9).
[CRl]E Find {A,E} E Rx{Ho(rot; a) n H(divO;an such that E =I- 0 and
(rot E , rot E*) = A(E, E*); VE* E Ho(rot; D).
(23)
[CRl)H Find {A, H} E Rx{H(rot;a) n Ho(divO;an such that H =I- 0 and
(rot H, rotH*) = A(H,H*); VH* E H(rot; a).
(24)
It is noted that the trial spaces are different from the test ones, but we
can take the test ones to the trial ones without essentially changing the
problems [16]. Sometimes u will be used instead of E and H in what follows.
It is easy to see that the present eigenvalue problems may be consid-
ered those of symmetric bounded non-negative operators. Moreover , for the
present a, we have the compact imbedding properties:
(25)
where
VE := Ho(rot; a) n H(div; a),
VH := H(rot; D) n Ho(div; a).
(26)
See Amrouche et al. [1) for details.
Based on the above and the spectral theory in Hilbert spaces, we have
various nice properties on the eigenvalues and eigenspaces, well-known for
symmetric positive compact operators. That is, our model problem is a stan-
dard and nice one from purely analytical standpoint under (25).
In [CRl)E and [CRl]H , the divergence-free conditions for u E Ho(rot; D)
(H(rot; D) , resp.) can be expressed weakly as
(u, grad ep) = 0; Vep E HJ(a) (H1(a), resp.).
(27)

114
Fumio Kikuchi
More precisely, these are equivalent to u E H(divo; n) (Ho(divo; n) resp .) for
u E Ho(rot; n) (H(rot; n), resp.). Then we can see that each u of [CRl]E or
[CRl]H for A f:. 0 satisfies (27) even when they are not required beforehand.
At the same time, the problems then become eigenvalue problems for non-
compact operators. In fact, the eigenspaces associated to A = 0 without (27)
become infinite-dimensional : for the present n, they are spanned by grad sp
for ep E HJ(n) or sp E H1(n). It is also not difficult to show the equivalence
between [CRl]E and [CRl]H under natural correspondence between E and
H suggested by (6), cf. [18] .
It is now natural to use the Lagrange multipliers to deal with the divergence-
free conditions (27) as linear constraints. Choosing the Lagrange multiplier p
from HJ(n), we have the following mixed variational formulation for [CRl)E :
[CR2]E Find {A, E ,p} E R xHo(rot; n) x HJ(n) such that E f:. 0 and
(rotE,rotE*) + (gradp,E*) = A(E,E*) ;VE* E Ho(rot;n),
(28)
(E, gradq) = 0 ; Vq E HJ(n).
(29)
Similar formulation may be derived for [CRl)H. Substituting grad q for q E
HJ(n) into E* of (28), we can see that gradp = o. That is, the multiplier
p essentially vanishes, and hence it may be considered a "hidden" variable.
Thus [CD2)E reduces to the original formulation [CRl)E.
Another popular approach to deal with linear constraints is the penalty
method. To apply it to our problem, we can use the function spaces VE and
VH defined by (26) . Using s > 0 as the penalty parameter for the divergence-
free condition, we have the following variational formulation for [CRl)E :
[CR3)E Find {A,E} E RXVE such that E f:. 0 and
(rotE,rotE*) + s-l(div E ,div E*) = A(E,E*) ; VE* E VE .
(30)
Similar formulation may be given for [CRl)H.
The present penalty formulation appears to be quite attractive since we
can rely on the compactness (25). Moreover, the original eigenpairs satisfy the
corresponding penalized equations, although additional spurious pairs also
satisfy them and pollute the original spectrum. Such spurious ones, however,
can be made diverge to infinity by letting s
--> +0, see [18] for the selec-
tion of s. Nevertheless, our penalty approach has a serious drawback when
implemented numerically as we will see later.
It is possible to give other variational formulations to the present problem,
some of which use H(div; n) or Ho(div;n) as well, see [3]'[5).
Electrostatic and magnetostatic problems. It is also possible to give
various variational formulations to the electrostatic and magnetostatic prob-
lems. It is quite common to use various mixed formulations in such processes.

Electromagnetic Problems
115
The electrostatic equations (11) consist of two parts, one involving the
rotation and the other involving the divergence. If we apply the least square
technique to the rotation part and deal with the divergence one as the con-
straint condition, we are naturally lead to a mixed formulation. Essentially
the same idea is applicable to the magnetostatic equations (12), and we have:
[ESl]E Given p E L2(st), find {E,p} E Ho(rot;.n) x HJ(st) such that
(rot E, rotE*) + (gradp, €E*) = 0; VE* E Ho(rot; st) ,
(31)
(€E,gradq) = -(p,q); Vq E HJ(st).
(32)
[MSl]H Given i E L2(st)3, find {H,p} E H(rot; st) x H1(st) such that
(rotH,rotH*) + (gradp,j.tH*) = U,rotH*) ; VH* E H(rot; st) ,
(33)
(j.tH, gradq) = 0; Vq E H1(st) .
(34)
Here, some of the boundary conditions are implicitly expressed as the natural
ones. Moreover, it is easy to see that gradp = 0 in these formulations. For
j
E H(divo; st), the solution H of [MSl]H is that of (12). Otherwise, it is a
kind of generalized inverse solution of (12), cf. [19].
It is also possible to consider the "dual" formulations by dealing with the
rotation equations as the constraint conditions:
[ES2]D Given p E L2(st), find {D,p} E H(div;st) x H(rot;st) such that
(div D ,div D*) + (rotp, €-l D*) = (p,div D*) ; VD' E H(div;st),
(35)
(€-l D, rot q) = 0; Vq E H(rot;st) .
(36)
[MS2]B Given j
E L 2(st)3, f ind {B ,p} E Ho(div; st) x Ho(rot;st) such that
(div B, div B') + (rotp, j.t-lB') = 0 j VB' E Ho(divj!2) ,
(37)
(j..L-1B,rotq) = (j ,q); v« E Ho(rotj!2) .
(38)
Again, some of the boundary conditions above are implicitly expressed as the
natural ones, and rot p = 0 in these formulations.
We can also consider variational formulations in terms of the scalar and
vecotor potentials. Since it is rather trivial to give a scalar potential for-
mulation for electrostatics, we here present only a mixed formulation for
magnetostatics in terms of the vector potential :
[MS3]A Given j
E L2(!2)3 ,find {A,p} E Ho(rotj!2) x HJ(!2) such that
(j.t-1rot A, rot A') + (gradp, A*) = U, A*) ; VA' E Ho(rot; st),
(39)
(A,gradq) = 0 ; v« E HJ(!2) .
(40)
Here, gradp = 0 if j satisfies the range condition j
E H(divOj st) for the
rotation operator over H(rot; st) .
For some other variational formulations for magnetostatics, see e. g. [25].

Finite element approximations
Based on the variational formulations in Sec. 2, we can obtain finite element
schemes by means of the Galerkin principle and triangulations of fl .
3.1
Finite element spaces
As we have seen in various variational formulations, it appears to be quite
natural to consider finite dimensional subspaces of HI(fl) , H(rot; fl) and
H(div; fl). So let us prepare appropriate finite element spaces Ch c HI(fl) ,
R h C H(rot;fl), Dh C H(div; fl), and also
C~ := C h n HJ(fl),
R~ := Rh n Ho(rot;fl) ,
D~:= Dh n Ho(div; fl) . (41)
For these, we assume the existence of the both scalar and vector potentials
inside the finite element spaces so that
grad C" = Rh n H(rotO, fl),
gradC~ = R~ n Ho(rotO, rz),
rotRh = Dh n H(divo, fl) ,
rotR~ = D~ n Ho(divo , fl) .
(42)
It is now well known that such desirable situation can be actually realized
for appropriate combination of the nodal, edge, and face elements, cf. [4]'[6] .
Let us now show two simplest pairs of examples for Rh and Dh presented
by Nedelec [23] and Raviart-Thomas [26] that satisfy (42) for appropriate G":
The associated finite elements are typical edge (face, resp.) elements where
edge (normal to face, resp.) values of approximate vector fields are used as
the degrees of freedom . Then it is easy to assure the interelement continuity
of the tangential (normal, resp.) components of the approximate vector fields,
which is required for the fields to belong to H(rot, fl) (H(div, fl), resp.).
1) Tetrahedral element : Uh = (UI' U2, U3) E Rh in each element is given by
Uh = a + j3 x x,
(43)
where x = (Xl, X2, X3), and a
E R 3 and j3 E R3 are coefficient vectors.
Similarly, Ph = (PI, P2, P3) E D h in each element is of the form
Ph = at + I3x,
(44)
where at E R 3 is a coefficient vector and 13 E R is a scalar coefficient.
The associated Ch is the classical piecewise linear space of tetrahedral
nodal element.
2) Rect angular parallelepiped element: Uh E Rh in each element is of the
form
UI = al + I3l x2 + 132x3 + ')'I X2 X3 , U2 = a2 + 133x3 + 134xI + ')'2X3XI,
U3 = a3 + I3sxI + 136x2 + ')'3XIX2,
(45)

(47)

117
while Ph = (Pl,P2,P3) E nh in each element is of the form
Pl =
Q;~ + ,BiXl , P2 =
Q;~ + ,B~X2, P3 =
Q;~ + ,B~X3 .
(46)
The associated Gh is the nodal finite element space for the popular 8-node
trilinear element.
3.2
Finite element schemes
Let us present some examples of finite element schemes based on the varia-
tional formulations in 2.4 and the finite element spaces in 3.1.
Cavity resonator problem.
We can give a finite element scheme for
[CRllE as
[CRl]~ Find {Ah' Eh} E RXR~ such that e, =f:. 0 and
(rot Eh' rot Ei'.) = Ah(Eh, Ei'.); \:IEi'. E R~ .
We can easily check that Eh of [CRl]~ for Ah =f:. 0 satisfies
(Eh, grad cph) = 0 ; \:ICPh E G~ .
(48)
Clearly this is a discrete analogs of (27), but the divergence-free condition
is not satisfied strictly so that we cannot rely on the compactness (25). A
similar scheme may be derived for [CRl]H with similar observations.
We can also construct a mixed finite element scheme based on [CR2]E by
using G~ as the space for the approximate Lagrange multiplier Ph:
[CR2]~ Find {Ah, Eh,Ph} E RXR~ x G~ such that Eh =f:. 0 and
(rot Eh' rot Ei'.)+ (grad Ph,Ei'.) = Ah(Eh, Ei'.); \:IE;' E R~ ,
(49)
(Eh,grad%) = 0; \:1% E G~.
(50)
Similarly to the continuous case, we have grad p., = 0 by taking Ei'. in (49)
as grad % for % E G~ , and the present mixed scheme reduces to [CRl]~ .
We can also consider penalty finite element schemes based on the formu-
lation [CR3]E, if we can find a finite-dimensional space vg such that
(51)
Such a space is obtainable if we use the popular "nodal" finite elements
with the tangential boundary conditions approximated adequately. Then our
approximation is an "internal" one and we can take full advantage of the
compactness (25) for VE. That is, each eigenpair of (30) can be well approxi-
mated by assuring appropriate approximation capabilities on vg. Moreover,
polluting eigenpairs may be deleted by choosing s sufficiently small.

118
Fumio Kikuchi
Actually it is not easy to assure approximation capabilities. That is, if we
use usual piecewise polynomial spaces, then condition (51) requires that
(52)
Such a condition is satisfied when we use usual nodal elements. The serious
fact is that, for general (in particular, non-convex, non-smooth) domain D,
VE n H 1(D)3 may be a proper subspace of VE,
(53)
cf. [10]. If such being the case, approximation is impossible when nodal type
elements are used as above [11],[18]. Of course, when the singular parts of
VE are known and finite-dimensional, we can include them to Vp to obtain
reasonable results. Various other attempts have been also made to use nodal
elements, but the use of edge elements appears to be more effective at present.
In [18] , numerical results based on the penalty approach by the piecewise
linear triangular element are given for various domains. In particular, we con-
sider pentagonal domains which can be either convex or non-convex. When
it is non-convex, it has at least one reentrant corner.
The results are generally reasonable when D is convex or aD is smooth.
In particular, we can observe typical spectral pollution when s-1 is close to
0, but polluting eigenvalues can be made diverge to 00 by letting s -+ +0
with physical eigenvalues being almost insensitive to variation of s.
On the other hand, when D is non-convex with non-smooth aD, there
are eigenvalues which do not approximate exact ones. Even in such cases,
finite element schemes based on edge elements are usually robust to such
geometrical singularities, and also free from the spectral pollution [16].
Electrostatic and magnetostatic problems. First we present a few finite
element schemes for magnetostatics.
[MS1]~ Given i E L 2(D)3, find {Hh,Ph} E R h x Gh such that
(rotHh' rotH,,) + (gradph,j.LH,,) = (j,rotH"J ; VH'h E Rh,
(54)
(j.LHh' grad Qh) = 0 ; VQh E cr,
(55)
[MS2]~ Given j E L 2(D)3, find {Bh,Ph} E Dg x Rg such that
(divBh ,divB'h) + (rotPh,j.L- 1B'h) =0; VB'hEDg,
(56)
(j.L-1Bh,rotqh) = (j,Qh); Vqh E Rg .
(57)
[MS3]~ Given j E L2(D)3, find {Ah,Ph} E R~ x G~ such that
(j.L-1rotAh ,rotA'h) + (gradph,A'h) = (j ,A'h) ; VA'h ERg ,
(58)
(Ah ,gradQh) = 0 ; VQh EGg .
(59)

For electrostatics, we present here the following one based on [ES2]D :

(div Dhl div Di.) + (rot Ph, f- 1Di.) = (p, div Di.) ; VDi. E tr,
(60)
(f- 1o., rotqh) = 0 j VQh E R h.

Analysis of finite element schemes
4.1
General
In order to analyze the above mixed finite element schemes, we should check
various conditions such as (d. [7]'[12]'[14])
1) approximation properties for Rh, Rg, r», Dg, Gh and Gg,
2) uniform coerciveness for some bilinear forms,
3) uniform lifting properties (inf-sup conditions),
4) discrete compactness properties.
The first condition is clearly necessary and has been shown for various con-
crete finite element spaces. The second and the third ones are also required
since our schemes are essent ially of mixed type, but closely related to 4) in
the present cases. On the other hand, the fourth one has been quite difficult
to show until recently. We will discuss it in a little more detail later.
Once these conditions are established, it is rather a standard process to
show the validity of finite element schemes given in the preceding section. Of
course, we actually consider an appropriate h-family of finite element spaces
associated with a family of triangulations of {2, where h is the discretization
parameter of a representative element size for each triangulation.
4.2
Discrete compactness properties
As was already noted, the discrete compactness is quite delicate. To give
examples of such definitions, let us first introduce some discrete operators:
div., : R~ -) G~; (divhvh,%) = -(vh,grad%) (VVh E R~, V% E G~),(62)
div~: R h -) G\
(div~vh,%) = - (vh, grad % ) (VVh E R h, Vqh E Gh),(63)
roth : D~ -) R~; (rothqh ,Vh) = (qh' rotvh) (VQh E D~ , vs« E R~),

These operators are well-defined thanks to assumptions (42).
Now we can give two examples of discrete versions of (25) in terms of the
above discrete divergence and/or rotation operators.

[DCl] Let {uhh>o be an arbitrary h-family such that
Uh E Rg,
Iluhll~(rot;.a) + IIdivhuhll2 :S 1.
(66)
Then there exist a subfamily, again denoted by {uhh>o, and an element
Uo E Ho(rotj D)nH(divj D) such that Uh --+ Uo weakly in Ho(rot; D) and
strongly in {L2(D)}3, and divhuh --+ div u., weakly in L2(D), as h 1o.
[DC2] Let {Phh>o be an arbitrary h-family such that
Ph E Dg,
Ilphll~(div;.a) + Ilroth Phl12 :S 1.
(67)
Then there exist a subfamily, again denoted by {Phh>o, and an element
Po E H(rot; D) n Ho(div; D) such that Ph --+ Po weakly in Ho(divj D) and
strongly in L2(D)3, and roth Ph --+ rot Po weakly in L2(D)3, as h 1o.
In the above, the "strong-convergence" parts are essential since the "weak"
ones follow from the boundedness of the families and the approximation con-
ditions for finite element spaces.
We can give two more examples of discrete compactness. First, using Rh
and div~ in place of R8 and div), in [DCI], we have a discrete analog of
compact imbedding of H(rot jD) nHo(divjD) to L2(D)3. Similarly, using Dh
and roth in place of D8 and roth in [DC2], we have a discrete analog of
compact imbedding of Ho(rotjD) n H(div;n) to L2(D)3.
The property [DCI] was shown by the present author [17] for the simplest
Nedelec elements of triangular andtetrahedral shapes in [23]. Notice here that
the case divhuh = 0 is essential. Recently, Boffi [3] presented more general
results for fundamental Nedelec's elements of simplex and cube-based types
presented in [23] by using the Fortin operator and the results in [1],[23]. See
also [8],[9] and [20] for some related results and generalizations . Thus it
will be important to analyze the discrete compactness for more general edge
elements including the covariant interpolation ones.
If we consider an appropriate pair of edge and face elements, the analysis
of [DC2] is quite similar to that of [DCI], and follows from [DCI] in the case
where div Ph = 0, cf. [22]. Furthermore, the case roth Ph = 0 is essential.

Computational techniques
There are at least two or three important factors for implementation of the
proposed finite element schemes for electromagnetics. The first one is the
special data structures for the edge- and face-type elements compared with
the conventional node-type ones. The second is how to solve the algebraic
equations arising from the discretization, which may contain indefinite ma-
trices and are of very large-scale especially in 3-D cases. Moreover , we need
to specify tangential or normal boundary conditions, but such conditions are
rather easy to deal with in edge- and face-type elements.

Electromagnetic Problems
121
The first factor may be coped with preparing directional segment or arc
data as well as face ones, besides the usual element and node data.
5.1
Cavity resonator problem
For this problem, we should solve the matrix eigenvalue problem associated
with (47), which has zero eigenvalue with very large multiplicity since con-
dition (48) is not a priori imposed. To cope with such a difficulty, we may
essentially use the subspace iteration method with shift techniques, which
appears to be effective to separate non-zero eigenvalues from the zero one [2].
However, especially in 3-D analysis, we need good solvers for large-scale lin-
ear simultaneous equations in the inverse iteration step. For such a purpose,
we can for example use the CG-type methods combined with Iwashita's zero
filtering technique, which enables us to deal with symmetric positive-definite
matrices in the inverse iteration process [15]. His idea is to consider the fol-
lowing form of a matrix eigenvalue problem :
([K] + >'*[M]){u} = (>' + >'*)[M]{u} ,
(68)
(rot HT., rot Hi.) + r(j.LHT., Hi.) + (gradph,j.LHi.) = (j, rot Hi.) ;
VH* E Rh
h
,
where A is the eigenvalue, {u} the eigenvector, A* the shift> 0 (A* :S 0 in the
usual inverse iteration method), [K] the stiffness matrix, and [M] the mass
matrix. Usually [K] + A* [M] is symmetric positive definite, and hence the
CG-type method is applicable to it. Furthermore, the eigenspace associated
with the zero eigenvalue can be removed by the zero-filtering, which is a
simple subtraction process for iteration vectors.
An alternative to be tested as an eigensolver is the Lanczos method.
5.2
Electrostatic and magnetostatic problems
The finite element schemes proposed in Sec. 3 for magneto- and electrostatics
are in general of large-scale, and the coefficient matrices associated with the
discrete linear equations are indefinite. Moreover, the Lagrange multipliers
are also contained as unknowns although they are essentially zero. To cope
with such difficulties, some iteration methods have been proposed, cr. [21].
Let us consider [MS1]i- as an example. Let r be a positive parameter,
and consider the following perturbation problem [21].
(69)
(j.LHT.,grad%) = 0 ; V% E cr.
(70)
Then we find that grad pj, = 0, so that we have the equation in HT. only :
(rotHT. ,rotHi.) + r(j.LHT., Hi.) = (j,rotHi.) ; VHi. E Rh.
(71)

122
Fumio Kikuchi
If r is small (but not too small to cause numerical instability), we can show
that HI. is close to the unperturbed H h under some conditions on the fi-
nite element spaces. Clearly, the associated coefficient matrix is now positive
definite. Moreover, we may consider an iteration method to correct HI. :
(rotH~k), rot Hi.) + r(JLH~k), Hi.) = (j, rot Hi.) + r(JLH~k-l), Hi.) ;
VHi. E Rh
(k = 1,2,3, ...). (72)
For the analysis of such a perturbation problem and its iterative version, the
discrete compactness properties again play essential roles [21] .
Essentially the same approach is available to solve [MS3]~ and [ES2]1J .
To deal with [MS3]~ for general j
E L2(n)3, we first obtain Ph and modify
j so that the new Ph becomes zero. More specifically, we obtain for Ph that
(73)
which can be solved by the standard methods based on nodal elements. Then
we modify j as j - gradps, for which the new Lagrange multiplier becomes
zero and hence the afore-mentioned approach is available.

Concluding remarks
We have given overview of numerical analysis of electromagnetics by the
finite element method. It appears that theoretical and computational basis
of such approaches become considerably firm, but further study appears still
necessary. Theoretically, we should establish discrete compactness for general
(curved, covariant) edge and face elements. Computationally, development of
appropriate iteration methods is desirable although it is not easy because the
arising matrices are frequently indefinite.
We have been mainly concerned with finite element schemes developed
around the present author, but there may exist various other effective ap-
proaches for computational electromagnetics. One important subject is to de-
velop effective finite elements well suited to electromagnetic fields and based
on sound theoretical basis, and another is to obtain nice variational formula-
tions convenient for large-scale computations and adaptive error controls. Of
course these two are closely related to each other, and it seems that the role
of numerical analysts will become increasingly important in the new century.

Abstract. Domain Decomposition has been extensively studied as a tool for paral-
lel computing. But in many cases th e problem posed includes domain decomposition
in its statement . For these the necessary numerical analysis is different because do-
main decomposition is not only at the discrete level but also on the continuous
problem . Therefore non-matching grids for their numerical solutions is more natu-
ral , but requires new error estimates.
Our main purpose is to compute with the data of Virtual Reality. In this paper
we shall review earlier works , including our own[9][1O][1l] and we shall present the
project freefem3d.

A-Priori Domain Decomposition
The Domain Decomposit ion Method (DDM) has been invented mostly as
an acceleration technique for parallel computations on multi-processors ma-
chines or networks. For example let (., .) denote the scalar product in L 2( fl )
and a(u, v) = (V'u, V'v ). In [15] for instance, it is seen that a model problem
such as
(2)
u - 9h E VOh
a(u, u) = (f,u )
\lu E V == HJ(fl) ,
u - 9 E V ,
(1)
is first discretized, and then decomposed into sub-problems. So DDM appears
as a solution method.
With the pI finite element method[3]' (1) is discretized as
1
(V'uV'v - f v) = 0 \Iv E VOh
fh
where Vh is the space of continuous pI functions on a triangulation flh of fl ,
and VOh is the subset of such functions which are zero on the boundary.
The Schwarz algorithm rely on a decomposition of flh into flh = fl i h U fl2h
with fl i h n fl2h =J 0 where all sets are unions of triangles of the triangulation
of fl. Then the solution of (2) is the limit of the following loop which starts
with uO = 9h

(V'u~+ I V'V - f v ) = 0 \Iv E ViOh

i = 1,2,
j = i + 1 mod 2
(3)
where Vih is the space of continuous pi functions on the triangulation of Jli h .
Note that the same method works on the continuous problemjl.S]:
and that it can be discretized on non-compatible meshes , but then the con-
vergence is more difficult to establish. We recall a result established in [71 on
a modified version of the Schwarz algorithm.

A Modified Schwarz Algorithm

and find u~+l E ViOh' i = 1,2 by solving

We consider the case where fh and Jlz are triangularized independently.
Integrals of piecewise constant functions 9 are computed exactly by
(6)
where n i is the number of triangles of the triangulation of Jli and
~~ is the
chosen quadrature point in triangle T~ (its center for instance).
To compute integrals involving products of functions on two triangulations
like JV'UlhV'VZh we propose the following formula

{k :~~E[}ln[}2}
{k :~~E[}ln[}2}
This can be summarized by saying that when U E Vih and v E VJh ' i :f. i ,
then a( ·, .) is replaced by ah(-, .) with
In the above formula I[};(x) is one if x E Jli and zero otherwise.
With such definitions the discrete version of (5) is :
- Find U~h+l E Vih such that 'VVih E Vih

b(U~;;l -
U~h' U2h) + ah(u~h + u~;;l, U2h) = (j, U2h)
VU2h E V2h
(9)
These equations define u~h+l uniquely. At convergence the problem solved is
- Find Uih E Vih such that VUih E Vih
(10)
The bilinear form is symmetric but this discrete problem may not have a so-
lution because the form may not be coercive. For this there is a compatibility
condition between the triangulation which is that the bilinear form must be
coercive: ah(ulh + U2h, Ulh + U2h) ~ cllulh + U2hl1 2 for all Uih E Vih
Proposition
Assume that the triangulations of ill and il2 are compatible in the sense that
they give a coercive bilinear form . Then the error between the approximate
problem (10) and the continuous problem is
lIu - uhll < Ch(llulI12,!]1 + Ilu2112,!]2)
In the case of the Laplace operator, if the mesh is uniform in ill n il2 and if
each triangle of one mesh contains one and only one quadrature point of the
other mesh then ah is positive and coercive .
3
The Chimera Method
Chimera as found in Stegger[16] is a method to solve problems for which
the construction of a triangulation of the complete domain il is impossible
or undesirable. This happens in CFD where the geometries are complicated.
For instance one could compute a full aircraft using DDM by computing first
the wings then the fuselage, provided that the meshes for each overlap in a
suitable manner.
The previous theory applies there too. Assume that il = [l' \ C where C c
tr.
We take a larger set
il~ containing C and inside il'. For ill we choose a set
il~ containing C but inside il2:
C c
il~ c
il~ c sr
Then we take
(11)
ill = tr
\il~,
Obviously we have il = ill Uil2.
(12)
In the discrete case, the domains ili are found automatically by finding first
all the triangles of ill h which are touching C then taking one or two layers
of triangles around it; this determines the boundary 8 1. Then surrounding C
with a boundary 82 of the same type as 8C which contains 81 in its interior
and is contained in ill' This may not be possible if the triangles of il' are
too large.

Constructive Solid Geometry
The algorithms of Virtual Reality (VR)[2][6][18] have to compromise between
realistic rendering and speed. We consider the case where a Partial Differen-
tial Equation has to be solved in the framework of VR.
Constructive Solid Geometry is quite popular in VR and consequently the
domain of integration of the PDE (if any) is not given by its boundary but by
set operations on simple elementary volumes, typically unions and intersec-
tions and sometimes extruding of elementary shapes. Consider for example
the following scene (see figure 3) described in the PDV-Ray language:
#declare altere = union{ cylinder {<-1 .5,O,O> <1.5,0,0>,
.35}
sphere {<-1.5,O,O>, 0 .5} sphere {<1.5,O,0>,
.5}}
union { object { altere rotate z*90 } object {altere scale 1}
object { altere rotate y*90 } sphere{<O,O,O>, 0 .6 } }
It is a set of spheres and cylinders with some realistic steel-like texture; notice
that there is no information about their intersection. This is seen only in the
rendering phase which is based on the z-buffer algorithm (zbuff[] is initially
filled with large values) :
for(t=O;tmax;t++) if(z[t] <= zbuff[x[t]] [y[t]])
{ putpixel(x[t],y[t],z[t]); zbuff[x[t]] [y[t]]=z[t] ;}
This C-program displays 3D objects {t -+ (x[t],y[t] ,z[t])} on a screen of size
hmax x vmax. By displaying all objects this way each new voxel (3D point) of
an object lights a screen-pixel (2D point) only if it is in front of all previously
displayed voxels that fall on the same pixel.
Engineering data on the other hand use Bezier or B-spline patches from
which it is easier to derive a triangulation of the surfaces in the scenes, a
necessary step for the generation of three-dimensional meshes.

the graphic rendering that takes care of the problem.

part of the scattered acoustic field on the surface of the geometry.

Geological Flows
Geological layers such as clay and chalk have very different diffusion and
Darcy coefficients with the consequence that flows through porous media
could benefit from DDM . Implicit solutions of the convection-diffusion equa-
tion with largely varying coefficients is a challenge. By concentrating the
difficulties at the interfaces between the layers, and use DDM, we may build
more efficient numerical methods.
The method described in [12] is well suited and will allow different time steps
in the different regions.
We consider the convection-diffusion equation
8tu + v . \lu - \l . (v\lu) = 0 in a x (0, T)
with zero initial and boundary conditions, except at the right boundary where
an homogeneous Neumann condition is applied.
The problem is in a = (0,1) x (0,2). It is an academic example of the
dissipation of a pollutant from an enclosure C into a medium a1 (rock) with
low diffusion but cracked (the vertical boundary next to the circle on figure
4). Furthermore below a1 there is another medium a2 (sand) with large
diffusion constant V2; there the pollutant is also convected (water in sand) at
velocity v. The velocity derives from a potential ¢ solution of (see figure 7)
8¢
¢Ix=o = 0
¢Ix=l = 1 and 8n = 0 elsewhere
and v = -J.L\l¢. The equations are discretized in time by an implicit Euler
scheme and in space by the finite element method of order one on triangles.
The convection term is treated by the Galerkin-Characteristic method[14]
and X(x) denotes an approximation of x - vSt:
The following Domain Decomposition Method is fully described in [12]; it
relies on Lagrange multipliers for the constraint Ul = U2 on the interface of
the (non-overlapping) sub domains.

where V; and Lh are the finite element spaces of piecewise linear continuous
functions on ai and S respectively, and

The parameters chosen are :
/..L = 10, V2 = 0.1, Jt = 0.1, T = 0.6, a = 1, f3 = 0, e = 1, TJ = 0.1, V2/Vl = 100.
The results are shown on figure 4. The mesh has some 1500 vertices (2/3 in
the top region fh). Sensitivity with respect to numerical coefficients is mild
except for e and a. The size of >. is proportional to l/f and its smoothness
(or localization) is controlled by TJ; a good choice of a improves the quality
of the results but f3 does not seem to playa major role. If f is too small the
method is unstable.
The numerical tests show that the method is feasible and well adapted to
discontinuous coefficients. Different time steps in different sub-domains (with
rendez-vous) improve the computing time and do not affect the precision.

The freefem Project
Started in 1995 as an educational multi-platform software freefem[l] has
received a larger audience than expected and many users have requested a
three dimensional version of this public domain software.
Presently freefem+ is a language driven 2D-PDE solver based on the finite

132
S. Delpino, J.L . Lions, and O. Pironneau
element method of order 1. It is written in C++ using template and generic
programming so that both scalar equations and systems can be solved. It
has two solvers in its kernel: a general elliptic PDE solvers based on a direct
Choleski factorization of the linear systems and a convection solver based on
the Galerkin-Characteristic method [14]. It can handle several meshes in one
program thanks to its powerful interpolator[8]. Therefore it is a convenient
tool for DDM.
Fig. 5. Solution of (1) with f == 1 in a circle of radius a third of the larger one, by
solving (9) on non-matching meshes with freefem+. The bottom left figure shows
the direct solution of the same problem without DDM.
In freefem3d we delegate the description of the domain to POV-Ray or vrml.
Similarly the display of result is done either in POV-Ray or in dx (ibm's data-
explorer[4]) . The language to describe the partial differential equations is
similar to freefem+. The following program is the source code of Figure 6.
vector a =(-1,-1,-1) ;
vector b = (1,1,1) ;
vector n = (38,38,38) ;

};
i=i+1;

}while(i<=5);
However the solver is quite different from freefem+: it is a fictitious domain
method with an iterative solution of the linear systems by the preconditioned
conjugate gradient method (see [5] for more details).
To use the virtual reality description of the computational domain (Figure 3
and the program of Section 2), one has to generate a characteristic function
for the object D .
The construction of this function was done in two steps, first by writing an
interpreter for the language describing the scene and then by constructing
the charact eristic functions of all the elementary objects of the scene.
The virtual reality language chosen was POV-Ray[18] because it is stable and
portable but it can also be done with vrml as easily. Also vrml just imple-
ments the set union but no set intersection. Moreover, one can use it as a
visualization tool thanks to the iso-surface patch of Suzuki[17] .
To parse the program of Section 1 is easy but POV-Ray has also conditional
statements, loops , symbolic variables, functions, etc.; so we have used lex
and yacc because both of them generate C or C++ parsers .
In the C++ produced, an abstract Shape class is defined; it provides a stan-
dard interface to every kind of shapes. Its children are specializat ion such as
Sphere or Cube (primitives), but also boolean operations such as Union and
Intersection. The same kind of design is used for geometrical transforma-
tions of POV-Ray, (s cal e, rotate or translate).
As every primitive shape is simple (sphere, cube, cone,. .. ), one can easily
associate to it its characteristic function. This is done by specializing the
virtual function of the class Shape for each of them. To know if a vertex is in
an object one has to compute the inverse of each transformation associated
to it and then check if the antecedent is in the primitive Shape.
This implementation makes the formul ation very close to the mathematics,
and as the results of boolean operations on shapes are shapes, complex objects
descriptions and their characteristic function evaluation may be recursive.
There is a problem however with two dimensional st ructures like polygonal
facets.
7
Conclusion
We have presented a few examples where Domain Decomposition is part of

We have recalled a modified Domain Decomposition Method which is well
suited to these problems and for which we have some convergence results for
an arbitrary number of subdomains.
We have given some results in two dimensions and presented the work plan
for three dimensional results. These are preliminary results which will be
followed by more realistic ones in the near future.

Abstract. We investigate a one dimensional model of blood flow in human arteries.
In particular we consider the case when an abrupt variation of the mechanical
characteristic of an artery is caused by the presence of a vascular prosthesis (e.g,
a stent). The derivation of the model and the numerical scheme adopted for its
solution are detailed. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the model
for the problem at hand.

Introduction
The growing interest in the use of mathematical modelling and numerical
simulations for the investigation of biomedical issues and, in particular, the
human cardiovascular system, is testified by the numerous works which have
appeared on the subject in recent years, among which we mention [1,6,10] and
the references therein. In this context, often simple models are already able to
provide good indications for the practitioners, at a reasonable computational
cost .
Here, we will focus on the application of a one-dimensional model of blood
flow in a compliant vessel to study the effect on the flow pattern caused by
the local stiffening of an artery. This can be due to a stent implantation, or
to the presence of a vascular prosthesis. A common pathology in the human
circulatory system is the on-rise of atherosclerotic plaques which cause a
restriction of the arterial lumen called a stenosis; in the most severe cases this
may hinder, or even stop, the flow of blood. One of the techniques nowadays
used for curing this problem is the implantation of a stent (an expandable
metal mesh) into the affected region which has the purpose of returning the
artery lumen to approximately its original shape. Whenever possible, this
procedure is preferred to more invasive ones, such as surgical by-pass.
However, besides other effects, the presence of a stent causes an abrupt
variation in the elastic properties of the vessel wall, since the stent is usually
far more rigid than the rather soft arterial tissue. This fact may cause a
disturbance in the blood flow pattern (and in particular in the pressure) with
the appearance of reflected waves. Indeed, the so-called pressure pulse is
generated by the interaction between the blood flow and the compliance of
the circulatory system and is intrinsically related to the elastic properties of
the arteries. The alteration in the pressure pattern is even more important

in the case of vascular prosthesis in large arteries, such as the ones used, for
instance, to cure aneurisms of the aorta or the femoral artery. Indeed, the
superposition of the waves reflected by the prosthesis or the stent with the
pressure pulse coming from the heart may generate localised pressure peaks,
which may have dangerous effects on the heart. In the case of an aortic or
femoral prosthesis, should these peaks occur at the region of the suture, they
could even break it apart.
Here, we carry out a numerical investigation of the modification of pres-
sure and flow pattern caused by an abrupt variation of the vessel elastic char-
acteristic, by employing a one dimensional model of blood flow. This model
is derived from the one described in [8] and already used for simulations in
arteries in normal conditions.
In section 2 we will present the model and in particular the modifications
which have been necessary to account for variable elastic properties. In section
3 we detail the numerical algorithm proposed for its solution, which is based
on a Taylor-Galerkin finite element scheme, and we briefly comment on the
application of boundary conditions for the simulations at hand. Section 4
presents some numerical results.

One dimensional models of blood flow in arteries
A one dimensional model for blood flow in arteries may be derived from
the following Navier Stokes equations, under a certain number of simplifying
hypotheses,

The domain !tt is depicted in Fig. (1) and is a cylinder which exemplifies a
portion of an artery. We have used the subscript t to put into evidence that

the domain is in fact moving with time, because of the compliance of the
vessel walls. Therefore, the equation should be coupled with an appropriate
model of the vessel wall dynamics, as for instance one of those that are
proposed in [10,3]. The unknowns are the fluid velocity u , the pressure P

and the wall displacement. The two positive constants u and p denote the
kinematic viscosity and the fluid density, respectively.
A simplified model is derived by assuming a cylindrical geometry with cir-
cular cross section, like the one depicted in Fig. (2). Without loss of generality,

we assume that the z coordinate is aligned with the axis of the cylinder. By
integrating the Navier-Stokes equations on a generic axial section S = S(z, t)
one obtains the following set of two partial differential equations
z E (0, l) , t > 0,
(2)
(3)
where A, Q and p denote the section area, average volumic flux and mean
pressure, and are defined as

p(z,t) = (A(z,t))-l r
P(x, t)d-y,
) S(z,t)
where x = (x, y, z) and U z denotes the z-component of the velocity. The
coefficient a is a function of the velocity profile on each section, and accounts
for the fact that the actual momentum flux differs from that obtained using
the averaged quantities. Here, it has been taken constant and equal to one.
It will be therefore ignored in the rest of the paper. The coefficient KR is a
resistance parameter linked to the blood viscosity.
We wish to point out that in order to derive (2) from (1) we have made the
approximation of considering the viscous effects to be important only in the
wall boundary layer . Consequently, we have neglected all second derivative
terms along the z coordinate coming from the viscous stress tensor in the
Navier-Stokes equations.

The number of unknowns (p, A and Q ) exceeds the number of equations
in (2). A possible way to close the system is to explicitly provide a relation
linking the pressure to the vessel area A and possibly its time derivatives. This
relation is derived from the.model of the dynamics of the vessel wall, and some
possible expressions have been given in [8]. Here we consider the case of an
elastic wall with varying elastic Young's modulus E to simulate the presence
of a vascular prosthesis or of a stent. We have neglected the inertia effect and
used the relation of static equilibrium in the radial direction for a cylindrical
tube, in the hypothesis of linear elastic material and small deformations, to
derive the following pressure relation
p = Pext + {3 (VA-~),
(4)
(5)
where Pext is the external pressure, here taken constant and equal to zero. A o
is the reference vessel section area which is a function of z since an artery is
usually tapered. However, for the sake of simplicity we have here considered
Ao constant, the steps required to deal with tapering have been described
in [8]. Finally, (3 = (3(z) is a parameter linked to the wall elastic properties,
which, under the assumption of incompressible material, takes the form
(3(z) = 4/irhoE(z) .
3Ao
The fact that (3 varies with z will affect the derivation of the conservation
form for equations (2), as we will detail in the following section.
Other possible relationships between P and A can be found in [5]'[12],[7].
The methodology here presented may be extended to those formulations as

The conservation form
We aim at writing (2) in the form
8U
8F(U) = B(U)

(6)
where U = [A, QjT are the conservation variables, F = [FA, FQ]T the corre-
sponding fluxes and B = [BA, BQjT a source term which is of zeroth order
in U .
To that purpose, we note that

Comparing with the case when (3 is constant, we may note that an additional

Alternative one-dimensional models for blood flow in artery, which adopt
the non-conservative variables p and Q as unknowns, have been used in the
literature (see e.g. [9]).
System (6) may be written in quasi-linear form as
(9)
Here,
c= J;:~
is the "sound speed" . Indeed, it may be shown that for all allowable values
of U, the matrix H possesses two real and distinct eigenvalues,
AI,2 = u ± c,
and a complete set of eigenvectors. We have put u = Q/A to indicate the
average value of the component U z of the velocity.
System (2) is then hyperbolic. Although a non-linear hyperbolic system
may develop discontinuous solutions even if the initial and boundary data
are smooth, for the values attained by the mechanical parameters and blood
velocities in physiologic (sub-critical) conditions, one has c > u, then the two
eigenvalues have opposite sign. A recent study [21 shows that in this situation
the pulsatile nature of blood flow may inhibit the formation of discontinuities.
Therefore, we will assume in the following that the solution is continuous.
We now indicate by L and A = diag(AI, A2) the matrix of left eigenvectors
and that of the eigenvalues of H, respectively. Then, relation (9) may be
written as
a
au
Lat U + ALa; = LB(U) .
(10)
It is possible to find a vector function W = W(U) = [W1(U) ,W2(U )1such
that auW = L. The quantities WI and W 2 are the characteristic variables

of problem (2) and their expression may be given as function of the average
velocity u and the pressure p (or of A and Q) as follows
By inverting these relations we may express the conserved variables in terms
of WI and W2 ,
(12)
In the case B = 0, equations (10) decouples and may be written component-
wise as
(13)
Equation (6) must be supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions
at z = 0 (proximal section) and z = l (distal section). The medical terms
"proximal" and "dist al" correspond to the sections nearest and farthest from
the heart.
Since the eigenvalues have opposite sign, a single boundary condition
must be specified at both ends. In particular, we may impose the entering
characteristic variable, i.e., "it > 0
WI (t) = 91(t) at z = 0, and W2(t ) = 92(t) at z = l,
(14)
where 91 and 92 are given functions of t. Alternative boundary conditions
applied to the primary variables Q and A (or p) can be devised as well,
under suitable restrictions [4]. For the numerical discretisation of (6), the
two boundary conditions above need to be supplemented by two additional
equations, one at each side, in order to allow the computation of two vector
unknowns U(O) and U(L). We will address this issue in more detail in section
3.1.
We recall here an a-priori estimate which has been derived in [3] for the
case of constant Young's modulus using slightly different, yet equivalent,
formulation for the characteristic variables. If
{fp

and 92(t) < 4 -AJ,

then there exists a positive function G = G(91, 92) such that the following
inequality holds , for all T ~ 0,

Clearly, E(O) depends only on the initial data.

Numerical Discretisation
The equations in conservation form (6) have been discretised by adopting a
second order Taylor-Galerkin scheme, which is the finite element counterpart
of the well known Lax-Wendroff scheme.
The presence of a non-constant source term and the explicit dependence
of the momentum flux FQ on the variable z due to the varying ,8 has made
the derivation of the scheme slightly more complex. In the rest of this paper
we will use the abridged notation
8F
Fu = 8U'
8B
Bu = 8U '
We now follow the usual route to derive the Lax-Wendroff scheme, by
writing

(16)
We note that, in contrast with what is usually done for the derivation of a
Lax-Wendroff scheme in standard cases, here we have not further developed
the z derivative of the fluxes, since in our case it is not anymore true that
8F _ F

because of the dependence of F on z through ,8.
For the time discretisation, we consider a time step L\t and indicate with
the superscript n quantities computed at time tn = nL\t. Using, as in a stan-
dard Lax-Wendroff procedure, a truncated Taylor expansion in time around

Space discretisation is carried out by using linear finite elements. To that
purpose, let us subdivide the interval [0,l] into N finite elements [Zi ' Zi+l ],
with i = 0, . . . , N and Zi = ih being h the constant element size. We indicate
by Vh = [VhF the space of continuous vector functions defined on [0,l],linear
on each element, and with V~ the set formed by functions of V h which are
zero at Z = °and Z = l. Furthermore, we indicate by
(u,v) =1/U . v dz
the £2 vector product.
Let us put FLW = F+(L1t/2)FuB and B LW = B+(L1t/2)BuB. A finite
element formulation of (17) is: for n 2': 0, find U~+l E Vh which satisfies

The boundary values of U~+l will be calculated using the presented boundary
conditions and following the technique described in section 3.1. U~ will be
taken as the finite element interpolant of the given initial data Uo.

Remark 1. We have integrated by parts the term (-a;-' 'l/Jh) in order to
make a discontinuous flux FLW admissible. Such event may be possible if
f3 fj. C1(0,l). However, the formulation here adopted does not allow for dis-
continuities in f3, because of the presence of d {3/ dz in the source term Band
in its gradient Bu.
Remark 2. Since we have ruled out the appearance of discontinuous solutions,
there is no need to adopt the limiting techniques normally implemented in
the context of the numerical simulation of non-linear hyperbolic equations by
explicit schemes.

scheme on a grid with uniform spacing h, gives a stability condition of the

which is more restrictive than the classical CFL condition for finite differ-
ence of finite volume Lax Wendroff schemes. This has been confirmed by our
numerical experiments.
In (18) there is the need of integrate numerically the terms containing the
fluxes and the sources. As for the terms involving F" and Fuwe have used
the technique of projecting each component on the finite element function
space Vh by interpolation. The same applies for the other vector products
which involve only F" and Fu.
As for the terms containing B" and Bu,we have adopted a slightly dif-
ferent approach in order to assure the strong consistency of the numerical
scheme. More precisely, we wanted our numerical scheme to be able to rep-
resent exactly constant solutions of the differential problem. In view of that
the term d 13/dz has to be approximated by piecewise constants. Precisely, on
each element [Zi, Zi+!] we have approximated df3/dz by [f3(Zi+l) - f3(zi)]jh .
For the remaining terms we have used the same technique adopted for the
fluxes. This gives rise to a piecewise linear discontinuous representation for
the source terms.
3.1
Computing the boundary data for the numerical scheme
The numerical scheme (18) needs to have a complete boundary data un+! at
the boundary nodes . We may note that the knowledge of W{'+! and Wr+!
at the boundary would in principle enable us to compute the corresponding
U n +! , thanks to relation (12). However, for the well posedness of the differ-
ential problem only one condition at each end, for instance those in (14), has
to be assigned.
In order to compute the complete boundary data we need an additional
equation, which must be compatible with the original differential problem.
Here, we have adopted a technique based on the extrapolation of the outgoing
characteristics. We remind that we are interested in simulating the effect on
the flow (and in particular on the pressure) of a vascular prosthesis, which is
accounted for by a variation in the parameter 13. The prosthesis will occupy
a portion of the model of the artery, let us say the interval z E [aI, a2], with
al > 0 and a2 < l. Therefore, at the boundary points z = 0 and z = I we
have ~~ = 0; furthermore the term KR(Q/A) is normally of small size. We
feel then legitimated to assume that in the vicinity of the boundary the flow
is essentially governed by equations (13). Let us consider now the proximal
boundary z = 0 (the case of the distal boundary will be treated similarly) ,
and a generic time step of our numerical procedure. We assume that U" is
known and we linearise A2 in the second equation in (13) by taking its value
at time tn and at Z = O. The solution corresponding to this linearised problem
at the time level tn+! gives

146
Luca Formaggia, Fabio Nobile, Alfio Quarteroni
and is in fact a first order extrapolation of the outgoing characteristic variable
W2 from the previous time level. Higher order extrapolations can be used as
well. By using this information together with the value of WI provided by
the boundary condition, W{'+! = gl(tn+!) , we are able to compute, using
(12), the required boundary data, U n+l(O).
This technique may be extended to the case when the boundary conditions
are not given in terms of the characteristic variable, for instance when one
wants to impose a given law for the pressure p(O,t) = t/J(t) at the proximal
boundary. However , we wish to point out that a homogeneous condition on
the incoming characteristics corresponds to a non-reflecting boundary condi-
tion and prevents unwanted spurious wave reflections at the boundary.
Remark 3. The methodology just illustrated is not the only possibility to
provide boundary data for the discrete problem. Another possible approach
is to adopt the so-called compat ibility conditions [4,11]' namely
IT (au
H au _ B(U)) = 0
2
at +
az
'
IT (au
H au _ B(U)) = 0
I
at +
az
'
z = 0, t > 0,
z = l , t > 0 .
(19)
A way to apply these conditions in a finite element scheme is to rewrite the
weak form (18) by letting 1/Jh E Vh( beware that in this case we cannot drop
the boundary terms which originate from the integration by parts). Now using
as test function the finite element functions associated to the two boundary
nodes we obtain two relations per boundary node. We may then form a
linear combination of the equations associated to node z = 0 (resp. z = l )
with coefficients 12 (resp. It), thus producing one equation for each boundary
node. They effectively represent a discretisation of (19) which conforms to
the adopted numerical scheme. In fact , a linearisation is usually required to
this purpose, for instance by evaluating the eigenvectors Ii, i = 1,2, in (19)
at the previous time step t" , These two extra equations are then added to the
ones produced by (18) and, together with the assigned boundary conditions,
allow to solve the discrete problem.
This technique has been tested as well, yet in this work we preferred the
method based on the extrapolation of the characteristics, for its simplicity.

Numerical Tests
In order to assess the effect of the changes in vessel wall elastic characteris-
tic on the pressure pattern, we have devised several numerical experiments.
Three types of pressure input have been imposed at z = 0, namely an im-
pulse input, that is a single sine wave with a small time period, a single sine
wave with a more realistic time period and a periodic sine wave (see Fig. 4).

Fig. 3 shows the layout of the numerical experiment. The part that simu-
lates the presence of the prosthesis or stent of length L is comprised between
coordinates Ul and a2. The corresponding Young's modulus has been taken
as a multiple of the basis Young's modulus Eo associated to the physiological
tissue.
Three locations along the vessel have been identified and indicated by
the letters D (distal), M (medium) and P proximal. They will be taken as
monitoring point for the pressure variation. Different prosthesis length L have
been considered; in all cases points P and D are located outside the region
occupied by the prosthesis. Table 1 indicates the basic data which have been
used in all numerical experiments. A time step L1t = 2 X 1O-6s and the initial
values A = AD and Q = °have been used throughout.
The boundary data for this numerical tests have been taken as follows. At
the distal boundary z = l we leave W2 constant and equal to its initial value.
This simulates a tube of "infinite" length. At the proximal boundary, we
would like to impose the chosen pressure input p(O,t) = 'ljJ(t). Yet, imposing
directly the pressure, as already noted in section 3.1, will produce a reflecting
boundary condition. Therefore, we wish to transform the pressure condition

exact terms, it has been proved very effective and enjoys good non-reflecting
properties. FUrthermore, sufficiently small t, when no W2-waves generated
at the prosthesis location have jet reached the proximal boundary, (21) is
effectively equivalent to impose the desired value for p and indeed this is
confirmed by the numerical experiments.
As previously pointed out, the formulation here adopted does not allow for
a discontinuous variation of the Young modulus E . Therefore, we smoothed

out the transition between Eo and E 1, as depicted in Fig. 5. A transition
zone of thickness 28 has been set around the point z = al and z = a2. In
that region the Young modulus varies between Eo and E 1 with a fifth order
polynomial law.
4.1
Case of an impulsive pressure wave
In Fig. 6 we show the results obtained for the case of a pressure impulse.
We compare the results obtained with uniform Young's modulus Eo and
the corresponding solution when E 1 = 100Eo, L = a2 -
al = 5cm and
8 = 0.5cm. We have taken l = 15cm and a non uniform mesh of 105 finite
elements, refined around the points al and a2. When the Young modulus
is uniform, the impulse travels along the tube undisturbed. The numerical
solution shows a little dissipation and dispersion due to the numerical scheme.
In the case of varying E the situation changes dramatically. Indeed, as soon
as the wave enters the region at higher Young's modulus it gets partially
reflected (the reflection is registered by the positive pressure value at point
P and t ~ 0.015s) and it accelerates. Another reflection occurs at the exit
of the 'prosthesis', when E returns to its reference value Eo. The point M
indeed registers an oscillatory pressure which corresponds to the waves that
are reflected back and forth between the two ends of the prosthesis. The wave
at point D is much weaker, because part of the energy has been reflected back
and part of it has been 'captured' inside the prosthesis itself.
4.2
Case of a sine wave
Now, we present the case of the pressure input given by the sine wave with
a larger period shown in Fig. 4, which describes a situation closer to reality
than the impulse. We present again the results for both cases of a constant
and a variable E . All other problem data have been left unchanged from the
previous simulation. Now, the interaction among the reflected waves is more
complex and eventually results in a less oscillatory solution (see Fig. 7). The
major effect of the presence of the stent is a pressure build-up at the proxi-
mal point P, where the maximum pressure is approximately 2500dynes/cm2
higher than in the constant case. By a closer inspection one may note that
the interaction between the incoming and reflected waves shows up in dis-
continuities in the slope, particularly for the pressure history at point P. In
addition, the wave is clearly accelerated inside the region where E is larger.
In table 2 we show the effect of a change in the length of the prosthesis by
comparing the maximum pressure value recorded for a prosthesis of 4,14 and
24 cm, respectively. The values shown are the maximal values in the whole
vessel, over one period. Here, we have taken l = 60cm, 8 = 1cm, a mesh
of 240 elements and we have positioned in the three cases the prosthesis in
the middle of the model. The maximum value is always reached at a point
upstream the prosthesis. In the table we give the normalised distance between

Finally, we have investigated the variation of the pressure pattern due to
an increase of k = EIEo. Fig. 8 shows the result corresponding to L = 20cm

fact that a stiffer prosthesis causes a higher excess pressure in the proximal
region.

is a build-up of the maximum pressure of approximately 2650dyne/cm2. This
simulation shows that the effects of the presence of a prosthesis are remarkable
even far away form the prosthesis in the proximal region.

Essential Spectrum and Mixed Type Finite
Element Method
Takashi Kako and Haniffa M. Nasir

Abstract. In the error analysis of finite element method, the inf-sup condition
or the uniform lifting property plays an important role. In this paper, we discuss
the relationship between the uniform inf-sup condition and the essential spectrum
of the operator that appears in the problem. In general, one can not expect the
convergence of the finite element approximation due to the spectral pollution that
stems from the inappropriate mixing of the eigen-subspaces that correspond to
two distinct components of the essential spectrum. As examples of our considera-
tion, we treat the Stokes problem, mixed approximations of elliptic problems and a
structural-acoustic coupling problem. In these problems, two distinct components
might appear in the essential spectrum of the corresponding operators.
1
Introduction
In the finite element method, to assure the convergence of a sequence of
approximate solutions to the exact solution, we have to choose appropriate
approximation subspaces. In the case of conforming finite element method,
it is well known that the inf-sup condition gives an abstract sufficient con-
dition for the convergence (see Babuska [1]). On the other hand, Descloux-
Nassif-Rappaz [9] introduced a necessary and sufficient condition for the non-
pollution of the approximate spectra in the finite element approximation for
a bounded linear operator. One of the main topics of this paper is to point
out a relation between these conditions with some typical examples.
As the application of these considerations, we investigate the mixed method
for the Poisson equation and a simple 1-D Stokes problem. The essential spec-
trum of an operator plays an important role in the analysis.
We also consider a fictitious domain method applied to a structural-
acoustic coupling problem as an example of a mixed finite element method
and show some numerical results without pollution although its exact error
analysis has not yet been done.

Finite Element Method and Abstract Error
Estimation
The error analysis for the conforming finite element method has been inves-
tigated for a long time since the works of Babuska [1] and Brezzi [5]. In the
following, we review the basic formulation for the finite element method and

the fundamental abstract error analysis of the problem in the framework of
operator theory.
Let X be a Hilbert space with inner product (., .) and x.; 0 < h :S ho,
be a family of its finite dimensional subspaces, and let Ph be the orthogonal
projections from X onto Xh. Then we consider the following linear equation
for the self-adjoint operator A in X :
and its approximation problem:
AX=f
(1)
As for the weak formulation of this problem, we introduce the bounded
bilinear form a(-, .) associated with A as follows:
a(x,y) = (Ax,y)
for all x,y EX,
and get equivalent problems to (1) and (2): To find x E X such that
a(x, y) = (f, y)
for all y E X,
and to find Xh E Xh such that
(3)
(4)
In the following, we assume the unique existence of the solution of the
equation (1) and hence a bounded inverse of A. This is equivalent to assume
that the range of A is dense:
a(x ,y) = 0
for all x E X
implies
y = 0,
and the following inf-sup condition is satisfied:
.
a(x ,y)
;~l :~~ Ilxllllyll > o.
As for the approximation problem, the uniform inf-sup condition:
CIS ==

a(xh' Yh) > 0

'
which is equivalent to the uniform invertibility of the approximate problems:
sup

hE(O,ho]
plays an essential role. Namely, under this uniform invertibility condition, we
obtain the abstract basic error estimate due to Babuskall]:

Essential Spectrum and Mixed Type Finite Element Method
157
The proof of this fact is given as follows. For any Yh in Xh, we have
x - Xh = x - Yh+ Yh - Xh = x - Yh + (Ah)-l(AhYh - /h)
= x - Yh + (Ah)-l(AhYh - Ph!)
= x - Yh + (Ah)-l(AhYh - PhAx )
= x - Yh + (Ah)-lPhA(Yh - x)
= {l - (Ah)-l PhA}(X - Yh).
Hence using the uniform boundedness of II(Ah)-lll , we get
IIx - xhll :::; (1 + II(Ah)-lll·IIPhAII) infYhExhllx - Yhll
:::; (1 + {sup II(Ah)-1IllIlAII)II(1 - Ph)xll
h
:::; c 11(1- Ph)xll·
(5)
Combining this estimate with the approximation property of X h (see (P-1)
condition (31) in Section 4) we have the convergence of the approximate so-
lution, and higher regularity of the solution implies the corresponding higher
order of convergence of the approximate solution (see for example [4], [3] and
[7]).

Application to coupled systems
Various problems such as the mixed formulation of the Poisson equation, the
Stokes problem, the electro-magnetic problem and the domain decomposition
method with interfacial conditions can be written in the following form of a
coupled system:
T [;] = [~]
with
T == (~ ~*) .
(6)
Here, A is a selfadjoint operator in some Hilbert space V and B is an operator
from V to another Hilbert space W with its adjoint B*.
We introduce a direct product X of Hilbert spaces V and W: X == V x W .
Then the operator T becomes selfadjoint in X . The weak formulation of the
equation (6) which is used for the finite element method is written as to find
u E V and pEW such that
a(u,v) + b*(p,v) = (f,v)v ,
"Iv E V,
b(u,q) = (9,q)W,
Vq E W,
(7)
(8)
where a(u,v) = (Au,v)v,
b*(p,v) = (B*p,v)v and b(u,q) = (Bu, q)w . We
note the relation:
b(v,q) = (Bv,q)w = (v,B*q)v = b*(q,v).
(9)

158
Takashi Kako and Haniffa M. Nasir
In the following we show some typical examples which can be written in
this form.
Example 1 (Mixed method for the Poisson equation): Consider the fol-
lowing Poisson equation:
(10)
where fl is a bounded region in the N-dimensional Euclidean space RN , and
H2(fl) and HJ(fl) are the usual Sobolev spaces on fl. We assume that the
inhomogeneous term f belongs to L2(fl). For the mixed formulation of the
problem, we introduce u as u == grad p, and put
v = H(div; fl) == {ulu E (L2(fl))n, div u E L2(fln
and
W = L2(fl),
(11)
and define
A == (I - grad · div)-l ,
B == div
and
B* == -A grad.
(12)
Then (10) can be written in the form (6). The corresponding weak formulation
is given as
(u,V)£2 + (p, div v)w = 0,
(div u,q)w = (j,q)w,
(13)
(14)
with (u,v)v = (U,V)L2 + (div u, div v)p and (p,q)w = (P,q)£2' We note
that the relation a(u,v) = (Au ,v)v = (u,v)w holds.
Example 2 (The Stokes problem): Let v be a velocity and p a pressure
for the incompressible fluid under the external force f, then the stationary
Stokes problem is written as
-<1v -l-grad p = f,
-div v = o.
(15)
(16)
Introduce function spaces V == HJ(fl)3 , W = L5(fl) == L2(fl)u{pl J"nPdx =
O} and let A == I, B == -div and B* == (-<1)-lgrad. Then the problem takes
the form (6) with (u,v)v == (grad u, grad v):» and (p,q)w == (P,q)£2.

Eigenvalue problem for coupled systems and finite
element method
The spectrum of the selfadjoint operator T which appears in the equation (6)
is a closed subset of the real line, and the essential spectrum of the operator
T is defined as

Essential Spectrum and Mixed Type Finite Element Method
159
If this set includes two mutually distinct non-empty subsets, the finite element
approximation of its spectrum could be suffered from the so-called spectral
pollution in the sense that there could be a point in the resolvent set of T
in the convex hull of two spectral subsets to which a sequence of eigenvalues
of the approximate operator converges. The simplest example of the spectral
pollution can be found in Kako [13] (see also Kako [14]) and is given as
follows.
4.1
A simple example of the spectral pollution
Let H be a Hilbert space and let {<pj }~1 be a set of orthonormal vectors in
H . We consider the following eigenvalue problem in the direct product space
X == H x H:
(18)
Here a and (3 are two distinct complex numbers. The operator T in the
left-hand side has the essential spectrum which consists of two points a and
(3:
aess(T) = {a} U {(3}.
(19)
Now introduce a special sequence of approximation subspaces Xn C X ,
and consider the Ritz-Galerkin approximation. Let Sn and t« be sequences
of real numbers which satisfy s~ + t~ = 1 for each integer n > O. We define
Xn as
Xn == {[~] I [~] = Ek= l [~:::] with arbitrary complex numbers
Ck, dk ,l ~ k ~ n - 1, and the n-th coefficients [~] = bn [::]
with an arbitrary complex number bn } .
Then the Ritz-Galerkin approximation of the eigenvalues of T consists of a ,
(3 and s~a + t~(3 . The last value is situated on the interval between a and (3.
From this observation, choosing Sn and t« appropriately, we can construct a
sequence of subspaces for which the approximate eigenvalue converges to any
point on the interval between a and (3. FUrthermore, changing Xn appropri-
ately we can construct an example where any closed subset of the interval
[a,(3] becomes a set of accumulation points of approximate eigenvalues. This
is a typical simple(est) example of pollution phenomena which is sometimes
observed in the finite element approximation of the saddle point problem.
4.2
Examples of essential spectrum
In the following, we compute the essential spectrum of the operators ap-
pearing in the problems introduced in Section 3, and we can conclude that

(20)
160
Takashi Kako and Haniffa M. Nasir
the spectral pollution might occur for the problems involving these operators.
Example 1 (Mixed formulation for the Poisson equation): The operator
T = T
= ((1 - grad -div)-l -(1 - grad -div)-l grad)
M
-
div
0
has the essential spectrum given as follows.
(21)
(22)
Hence the origin 0 E [-1, 1] can be polluted for a certain special finite el-
ement approximation. The fact (21) can be shown as follows. The concrete
expression of the eigenvalue problem: TM(U,p)t = >'(u,p)t is given as
Au + B*p = >'u
Bu = >.p.
The corresponding weak formulation is written as
(u,v) £2 + (p,div V)L2 = >.{(u, vh2 + (div u, div V)L2}
(divu,q)=>.(p,q)L2.
(23)
Eliminating u from this system of equations, we can deduce a condition for
p:
(>.2 _ 1)(-L1)DP = ->.(>. - l)p,
(24)
where - L1D denotes the Laplacian with homogeneous zero Dirichlet bound-
ary condition. Hence >. = 1 is always the point spectrum with infinite mul-
tiplicity which belongs to the essential spectrum. A sequence of eigenvalues
{Pj}J=1,2,
of -L1D which tends to infinity gives a sequence of eigenvalues
{>'j }j=1,2,
of TM:
1
>'j = -1 +--
(25)
1 + Pj
which tends to -1. Hence -1 also belongs to the essential spectrum of TM.
Example 2 (The Stokes problem): Let us denote by [ . ] the closure of
an operator. The operator T = Ts in this case is written as
T = T
= (
I
[(-L1 D)-l grad])
s -
-div
0
.
The essential spectrum of Ts then becomes
1+V5
1-V5
17ess (Ts ) = {1}U{-2-}U{-2-}'
(26)
(27)
Hence also in this case, the origin 0 can be polluted. The proof of (27) is
given as follows.

Essential Spectrum and Mixed Type Finite Element Method
161
After some calculation we see that ). = 1 is an eigenvalue with infinite
multiplicity whose eigen-functions consist of those pairs of functions satisfying
the condition:
div u = 0,
p = O.
(28)
In case that LlD p -I 0 with non-zero p, we can deduce the following non-
trivial condition
().2 _). -1)(-LlD)p = 0
which leads to the second order algebraic equation in ).:
).2 _). -1 = O.
(29)
(30)
Hence the roots of this equat ion (1± V5)/2 are eigenvalues of Ts with infinite
multiplicity and hence belong to the essential spectrum.
As for the non-pollutive spectral approximation, we mention the following
results by Descloux-Nassif-Rappaz ([9]) under the conditions (P-1) and (P-
2) below. Let us introduce a family of subspaces of X as X
~ X h ,
h E
(0, ho], and define the orthogonal projection Ph from X onto Xh : (PhX,Yh) =
(x ,Yh),
VYh E Xi; We introduce conditions (P-1) and (P-2) as:
(P-1)
(P-2)
limh~o PhX = X,
"Ix E X ,
limh~o II(I - Ph)TPh li = o.
(31)
(32)
Then we have the following
Theorem 1 ([9]). The conditions (P-l) and (P-2) are the necessary and
sufficient conditions for that the spectrum and eigenspaces of the operator T
can be approximated by those of Th without pollution.
5
Inf-sup condition and spectral pollution
In this section, we first briefly discuss the relations among the conditions
(P-1) and (P-2), the spectral pollution and the inf-sup condition. Next we
show a typical example of spectral pollution phenomena related to the I-D
Stokes problem.
5.1
Abstract results
We have the following results (see [14]).
Theorem 2. Consider the finite element approximation of a uniquely solv-
able problem: Tu = f with a bounded selfadjoint operator T in a Hilbert space

ciated orthogonal projections Ph and approximation operators Th = PhTl xh'
Th en the uniform inf-sup condition:
is satisfied if and only if the origin 0 is not polluted.
Proof. If the origin is not polluted, there exists a neighborhood of the origin:
B£ == [z] Izi < t}
(34)
such that, for sufficiently small h, B£is included in the resolvent set of Ti.,h E
(0, hoI:
(35)
which implies the uniform inf-sup condition.
On the other hand, if the pollution occurs in the sense that there exists
a sequence of approximate eigenvalues which converges to the origin which
belongs to the resolvent set of T by the solvability of the original problem:
ThXh = AhXh,
Ah -+ 0,

(36)
If we consider (33) for the eigenvectors Xh which causes the pollution, it is
easily seen that the uniform inf-sup condition is violated.
For the finite element approximation of the inhomogeneous problem (6),
we have the following results (see [14)).
Theorem 3. Let us assume that the problem (6) is solvable and also assume
that 0

We choose as the finite element subspace Xh C X the set of pairs of functions
Vh and Ph which are continuous and piecewise linear with respect to the equi-
partition of [0,1] and Vh(O) = vh(l) = O. Let n be the number of sub-intervals
in the partition and let Ti, == PhTlxh ' Then a special pair of functions VOh
and POh' which are given as

belongs to Xh and satisfies the condition: Th(Vh ,PhY = O·(Vh ,Ph)t. Essential
point to prove this is the fact that (_d2 / dx 2) -1 (d/dx )Ph is orthogonal to
every function in Vh.
Namely the origin°is always the eigenvalue of Th although 0 is not in the
spectrum of T. This is a typical pollution phenomena for the Stokes problem
which violates the uniform inf-sup condition.
On the other hand, we can explain this phenomena as the spectral pol-
lution of the origin due to the fact that the essential spectra of T is given
as aess(T)(= a(T)) = P+ = (1 + J5)/2} U {A_ = (1 - J5)/2} and hence
the origin belongs to the convex hull of the essential spectra. The pair of
functions VOh and POh are expressed as the sum of eigenfunctions of T with
eigenvalue A+ and A_ as
[VOh] = [voi] + [VO~]
POh

POh (x) = =fA+ _ A_POh(X),

element method as
Ah = A+(llvot I12+ IIPotI 12) + L((lIvoh" W+ IIPoh"W))

and after some calculation, we obtain once more the fact that >"h = O. This
elementary observation confirms the argument in the previous section that
the spectral pollution due to distinct two essential spectra is the origin of the
violation of the inf-sup condition.

Fictitious domain method as an example of mixed
method
In this section we briefly study a structural-acoustic coupling problem ap-
plying the fictitious domain method. The problem can be formulated as a
mixed type and hence there is a possibility of pollution phenomena. Never-
theless, in the following numerical examples, we do not see any pollution. Its
mathematical justification is a future work.
This type of coupling problems is important for the noise reduction inside
motorcars, trains, airplanes and others. The mathematical model of the prob-
lem is written as to find the inside and outside pressure deviations Pi, i = 1,2
and the shell deformations u = (UI ' uz) satisfying

(45)
where Po is the surface mass density of the shell, Pi,i = 1,2 are the densities
and Ci, i = 1, 2 are sound velocities of inside and outside acoustic media
respectively, Ll is the Laplacian, A is the shell force operator, n is the unit
normal on the shell towards outside and Ii,i = 1,2 are sound sources situated
inside and outside the shell.
The problem can be formulated mathematically in a simular way as was
developed in Deng-Kako [8]. In computing the acoustic fields, we use the ficti-
tious domain method following the idea of Heikkola et al [11] and Kuznetsov-
Lipnikov [17] . The treatment of outer infinite domain where the Sommerfeld
radiation condition is assumed at infinity is based on the methods in [12],
[18] and [19] . As for the finite element subspaces for acoustic pressure fields,
we use piecewise linear continuous functions on almost uniform mesh with
respect to polar coordinates except the vicinity of the shell where the acous-
tic mesh is modified to adapt the shell. On the other hand, for the shell
deformation variables, one dimensional Fourier spectral method is used.

Time stationary problem for this type of coupled vibration is formulated as a
similar system of equations to the mixed formulation of the Poisson equation

Introduction
Computational science in general and computational mechanics in particular
addresses physical and engineering reality with respect to some particular
goals. These goals must be clearly specified. They are usually to get good
qualitative or quantitative information about reality. The admissible quality
of required information should be characterized.
The quality of the information relates directly to validation and veri-
fication of the problem. Validation deals with the question of how well a
mathematical model describes reality. Verification deals with the question of
the error of the approximate numerical solution in comparison with the exact
solution of the mathematical problem (see e.g. [1]).
The usual mathematical problems are deterministic i.e. it is assumed that
all data are known perfectly. In practical computations, often the formulation
can be assumed to be known (for example the type of differential equation is
known) but there is uncertainty in the input data such as the values of the
coefficients, right hand side and the domain definition.
For practical purposes, computations make sense only if the uncertainties
in the input data have small effect on the output of interest. In other words,
that the problem is well posed . By a well posed problem we mean that both
the physical one (for example we need reasonable reproducibility of the ex-
periments) and the mathematical one (where we need continuous dependence
on the perturbation of the data so that it is relevant for the applications).
Let us show an example when the domain of a partial differential equa-
tion is obtained by scanning. Consider the following model problem. Let
D = {Xl, X21
~ < XI + X~ < I}, r, = {Xl, X2! XI + x~ = I}, and
r2 = {Xl,x21XI + x~ = ~ } and let us be interested in the problem:

Let us now assume that the domain D is given by a digital image with
pixels of size of f . Let us denote this "pixel" domain by D£ with the boundary
r 1u r2. Let us denote U£ E HJ(D£) = {U E HI(D£) , U= 0 on r 2} which
solves the problem (1.1) on D£ in the weak form

Obviously u£ exists for any f. Now we have:
Theorem 1.1 u£(O, 0) f+ u(O, 0) as f
----> O.
This shows that the classical formulation is not well posed. Nevertheless
from physical consideration we can conclude that the physical problem is well
posed. The source of the paradox in Theorem 1.1 is that the length of r l£ does
not converge to the length of r i . Of course assuming stronger convergence
of r1to r l we will get continuous dependence. It is worthwhile to note that
this paradox is related to the nonhomogenous Neumann boundary condition.
There is no paradox for the homogenous Neumann condition as well as for the
homogenous or nonhomogenous Dirichlet boundary condition. The paradox
mentioned in Theorem 1.1 can be resolved by different weak formulation.
Denoting G(XI, X2) = e where e is the angle (multivalued function). Then
we replace F£ by F£* where
(1.4)
i.e, by Stieltjes integral, which is properly defined in the obvious way for the
multivalued G. Denoting u; the weak solution of (1.3) when F£(v) is replaced
by (1.4) we get
Theorem 1.2
u; (0,0) -+ uo(O, 0) as f -+ O.
(1.5)
The proof follows from the results in [2].
Assuming that the problem is well posed it is important to assess the
influence of the uncertainties in the input data on the computed data. We
can consider two approaches:

Can We Trust the Computational Analysis of Engineering Problems?
171
a) The worst scenario approach. Here we assume that a set of admissible
data is known and we wish to obtain the range of the ouput when the in-
put ranges over the admissible set. In the example above we can consider
the set of admissible domain D; : {Xl,X2!! + 10 ::; X~ + X~ ::; 1 - f} C
o, C {Xl,X2\ ! -10 < X~+X~ < 1+f}. Then we can consider supuf(O, 0)
and inf uf(O,0) when D, is ranging over the admissible set.
b) The stochastic approach. Here we assume that a set D with a specified
probability space is given. We are interested in the probability field of the
solution. For example we can assume that D = {Xl, X2!! < Xl + X2=
1 + ¢(B)} where ¢(B) is a stochastic function with known probability
field. Then the goal is to obtain the probability of uf(O).
Problem of this type are related to the validation. The problem of veri-
fication is related to the a-posteriori estimate of the error in the output of
interest. It is essential to measure the error in an application relevant sense.
2
A-posteriori error estimation for the deterministic
problems
2.1
Introduction
Here we summarize the basic results on a-posteriori error estimators. For
details we refer to [3].
Let us consider the following model problem:
U = 0 on rD ,
(2.1a)
(2.1b)
(2.1c)
Let UEX be the exact solution and USP be the finite element solution. Using
.6
the mesh .d and element of degree p. The exact solution UEX E U satisfies
where
B(UEX,V) = F(v)
'r/v EU
(2.2a)
(2.2b)

172
1. Babuska and T. Strouboulis
and
u = {UIB(U,U) = lIull~ < 00, U=a on rD } .
Given the mesh L\ = {r} we denote
S~ = { U E ul UIT is polynomial of degree p}.
Then the finite element solution Usp satisfies
41
(2.2c)
(2.2d)
(2.3a)
B(usp ,v) = F(v)
41
Vv E S~ .
(2.3b)
The elements r can be triangles or quadrilaterals, straight or curved . Let us
denote f the master elements which is mapped on the "physical" element r.
If f is a triangle then the shape functions are polymomials of degree p. If f
is rectangle then the shape functions are the polynomials of degree p in both
variables. If the mapping of f on r is not linear, then the shape functions
on r are the "pullback" polynomials. By esp = UEX -
UsP we denote the
41
41
the error of the finite element solution and we are interested in estimating
IlespIlu. More precisely, we are interested in the construction of a computable
41
upper (resp. lower) estimator £u (resp. £L) so that
(2.4)
The upper estimator £u is used for the acceptance of the computed data
and £L is used as the quality measure of £u . The interval (£U,£L) is called
the reliability interval. £u and £L have to be computable and utilize the
computed solution USP , the mesh L\, and the input data t, and g.
41
The estimators have the form (or similar form)
1
£U = ( 2: (rp(r»)2) :2,
TEL\
(2.5a)
(2.5b)
rF (r) , and r/(r) are called the error indicators. We distinguish two kinds of
estimators:
a) The guaranteed ones when £L, and £u leads to estimate (2.4).

Can We Trust the Computational Analysis of Engineering Problems?
173
b) The correct estimator t: when there exists constants CL, and Cu such
that
(2.6)
where CL, and Cu are independent of the large class of meshes, of the
input data (and solution UEX) from a sufficiently large class.
The quality of an estimator is usually characterized by the effectivity
index '"
(2.7)
2.2
The basic estimators
Let us now list the basic a-posteriori estimators.
a) The subdomain residual estimator: Let A(..:1) = {ad be the set of the
vertices of the mesh ..:1. By a, we denote the patch associated to the
vertex ai. It is the union of the elements which have a vertex at ai. Let
eUi E UO(O"i) be such that
B(eUi'v) = R(usp ,v) = ( Iv dXldx2 +j
gv ds - B(usp ,v)
~
JD
rN
~
Vv E UO(O"i),
(2.8a)
where UO(O"i) = {u E HJ(O"i), u= aon 80"i - TN } . Then we can define
(2.8b)
Ui
and have
Theorem 2.1 There exists constants CL, and Cu dependent only on
the class of meshes (e.g. minimal angle condition, type of the elements,
coefficients in the differential equation etc.) but are independent of UEX
and USP such that (2.6) holds.
~
This estimator is one of the first proposed a-posteriori estiamtor, see[4-
7]. Recently a modification of the definition of eUi was suggested in [8-
10]. The function eUi is locally defined. Of course, we have to compute
it numerically. It is possible to estimate the effects of the approximate
solution of eUi similarly as in [3]. The constants CL, and Cu depends on
the form of the patches and hence, if they are computed, they could lead
to a conservative result. On the other hand, in practical computation we
mostly have! < r: < 2 or better. The modifications in [9], [10] further
improve the effectivity index in practical computation.

b) The explicit residual estimator: The residual R(us':.! ' v) defined in (2.8a)
can be written in a more explicit form using integration by parts.

and from Theorem 2.1 we have

Assuming that f is sufficiently smooth then we have
Theorem 2.2b
(2.11b)
(2.11c)
The explicit estimator was proposed in [5], [11] and then used in many
places. The correctness of this estimator can be proven by various means.
The effectivity index of this estimator can be very poor specially when
the triangles have small angles. For more see [3], [12], [14). If we would
have
(2.12)

175
then we can compute er E U(r) so that
Vv E U(r),
(2.13)
where
e.i«, v) =1V'uV'v dXldx2
and U(r) = {u E H1(r), Br(u,v) =
lIull~(r) < oo} and
lIerll~(r) :::; CT/2(r),
where T/(r) is given in (2.10). We can then define the estimator
(2.14)
(2.15a)
e = ( L
lIerll~(r»)!'
rEL\
(2.15b)
It is necessary to compute er numerically. We can utilize (2.13) using
only the set of polynomial of degree p+k instead of U(r). Further we can
restrict this space so that the polynomials are zero at the vertices and on
every side e they are orthogonal to all polynomials of degree p with zero
at all the ends of f. We denote this set as B(p + k) (the buble set).
The condition (2.12) does not hold in general. It is possible to modify J,
so that (2.12) holds. It will be discussed below. If (2.12) does not hold
then er satisfying (2.13) does not exist but e~(p+k) still exists and we can
1
define T/B(p+k)
=
Ile~(p+k) II~~ and £B(p+k) = (LrEL\ lIe~(p+k)II~~) 2
and Theorems 2.2a, b hold for this estimator too. For details see [3].
Usually for k = 2 this estimator performs better that £ EX PL .
c) The equilibrated estimator: Assume now that we can change the jump J,
used earlier into J; so that
(2.16)
and
(2.17)
(2.18)
Vv E U(r);
This is possible to do by local computations. For such construction see
[3, 14-18]. Let er E U(r) be such that
Br(er,v) =1rv dXldx2 + L 1i;» ds
r

e

176
I. Babuska and T . Strouboulis
Because of (2.17) er exists. Now we have
(2.20)
and we have
Theorem 2.3a
(2.21)
and hence [EQ is guaranteed upper estimate. For sufficiently smooth data
we also have
Theorem 2.3b [EQ is a correct lower estimator. For more details see
[3].
Of course we have to compute er numerically in an approximate way. For
example we can solve (2.18) by using polynomials of degree p + k, The
error of this approximate solution can be estimated and a guaranteed
upper estimate can be obtained. For more see [3]. It is possible to get a
guaranteed lower estimate also. For details see [3].
d) The recovery estimator: This estimator is based on special averaging so
that the gradient of UEX is "recovered" . By this we mean that we can
(locally) compute qi, i = 1,2 on every T so that
(2.22)
q is then the recovered gradient. This allows then to define
(2.23)
This kind of estimator was proposed by Zienkiewicz, see [19-21], and is
closely related to superconvergence. For more details see [3]. It is also
possible to prove that this estimator is a correct one when the data are
sufficiently smooth.

Can We Trust the Computational Analysis of Engineering Problems?
177
2.3
Rating of the estimators
Since the first a-posteriori error estimator proposed in 1978 (see [4]' [5], [11]),
there have been many estimators proposed and analyzed in the literature,
see e.g, [3]' [22-24] and references therein. The problem is how to assess their
quality. This depends on the purpose of the computations. Sometimes it is
sufficient only to have correct estimators with constants more or less known
from experience so that in practice the effectivity index is 4< "- < 2. Other
times we would like to have a guaranteed error estimator. For more details see
[3]. One powerful rating approach is the asymptotic one which is described
in [3], [25-27] . Assume that the mesh is patchwise (cell) translation invariant
on domain weD of diameter H with h being the diameter of the cell. Also,
assume that
a) there is no pollution.
b) the exact solution is smooth.
c) the error of us:; is of order p for elements of degree p.
Then it is possible to find (asymptotically) the finite element solution by local
cell computation only. It is possible to assume that UEX is a polynomial of
degree p + 1 on w. These results are closely related to the superconvergence.
See [3]' [28, 29] for more details. This relationship allows the effectivity index
for every estimator to be computed asymptotically. The effectivity index "-
depends on the mesh Ll (i.e. the cell), the exact solution (polynomial), and
the differential equation. Given the class of meshes M, the class of solutions
S (for example only those satisfying homogenous differential equations, such
as Laplace's equation), for every estimator E: we can compute
tf(M ,S,E:) =
inf
,,-(Ll,UEX,E:)
LlEM ,UEXES
and
R(M,S,E:) =
sup
,,-(Ll,UEX,E:)
LlEM,UEXES
and define the robustness index
1
R(M,S,£) = max (~-1, - -1).
tf
(2.24)
(2.25)
(2.26)
Comparing the estimators we prefer the one which has the smaller robustness
index. In [3], [27] robustness indices for various estimators are given. Roughly
the estimator based on recovery and the equilibrated estimator using the
bubble shape functions have the smallest robustness indices.
Asymptotic robustness does not mean that the error estimator is either
a guaranteed upper or lower one. As we have mentioned we can construct
locally the guaranteed upper and lower estimates. For experience with these
estimators and computation of the reliability interval see [3].

The estimates of the error in the computed data of interest
In the previous section we have discussed the error of the finite element so-
lution measured in the energy norm. In practice often the aim of the compu-
tation is to obtain values of some functionals, such as stress intensity factors,
flux at a point, and average values of the solution over an area. In general we
are interested in the value 4'>(UEX) but we are able to compute only 4'>(Usp )
~
and hence we are interested in the estimate of 4i(UEX) - 4'>(us,·). Here we
~
have to consider two classes of functionals 4'>:
a) Linear bounded functionals on (entire) space U, such as the average value
of UEX over a subdomain w.
b) Functionals which are not bounded on the entire set U such as the point
value of u, the point value of ~~ or the stress intensity factor.
Let us first address the error in the bounded functionals. Given a bounded
functional 4'> there exists ¢EX E U such that
B(¢EX,V) = 4'>(v)
Vv EU
(2.27)
and its finite element approximation. Then it is easy to prove (see [3])
Theorem 2.5 We have
4i(UEX) - 4'>(usp ) = B(UEX - US", ¢EX - ¢s" ) = B(esp (u) , es,· (¢)),
~
~
~
~
~
(2.28)
where es: (u) = UEX - US", and es" (¢) = ¢EX - ¢sP . Using the estimators

for esp (U), and es,· (¢) we get

If the functional ([J is not bounded on the entire space U , usually it is
possible to write
([J(UEX) = ([J*(UEX) + 1[t(UEX),
(2.33)
where 1[t(UEX) can be computed directly from the input data, e.g, f and ([J*
is a bounded functional on the entire space U. Then we can define
([J( us~J = ([J* (us~J + 1[t(us~J
(2.34)
and the error can be computed as before. For more details and numerical
examples we refer to [3].
Computation of data of interest and its a-posteriori estimates was first
introduced in [30] . Now there are many papers addressing the computation
of data of interest. For more see [3], [31-33]. A-posteriori error estimation is
typical of the verification problem as mentioned in the introduction. In this
section we have outlined the basic state of the art when the finite element
method is used as the numerical treatment of the elliptic partial differential
equations.

The problem of stochastic differential equation
Let us now address the validation problem when the data are not exactly
known. Let us consider the model problem with x = (Xl,X2),
a
au
a
au
-(aXl a aXl + aX2 a ax) = f
on
D ,
(3.1a)
U = 0 on aD.
(3.1b)
We will assume that the coefficient a is a stochastic function, and f is a
deterministic one . More precisely let (D, F , P) be a probability space and
Dc R 2 , with Lipschitz boundary and a : D x D ~ R . We will assume:
1. Assumption Ql: The function a(x,D) is measurable. We will work with
the natural o-algebra, F = u(a) which is the smallest one which makes
a measurable function.
2. Assumption Q2: There exists 0 < ao < al < 00 such that
ao ::; a(X, D) ::; al .
(3.2)
If X is a real valued random variable in (D, F, P) with X E Ll(D) we
denote its expected value by
E(X) = LX(w) dP(w) = LXdp.(x) .
(3.3)
Here J1. is the standard distribution measure for X defined on the Borelian
sets on R, with B(R) given by
(3.4)

3. Assumption Q3: There exists a density function for X, p: R --+ RY such
that
E(X) = JR Xp(X)dX.
(3.5)
Let V be a Hilbert space which is the completion of the set {v E Ltoc(D)®
Ll(D)llIdV'Vlli2(Dxm < oo} and
B(u,v) = »l. a(V'u · V'v)] =1E[aV'u· V'VjdXl dx2
(3.6)
is bounded coersive bilinear form on V x V . Then the weak form of our
model problem reads:
Given f E V', find u E V such that
B(u,v) =< [,» >
"Iv E V.
(3.7)
Because of our assumption Ql, Q2, and Q3 there exists a unique solution
u(x,w) E V .
Let us make further assumptions:
4. Assumption Q4: Let
m
a(x,w) = (E[a])(x) +2: Aai(X)Yi(W)
i=1
(3.8)
where Yi(w) are real random variables which are mutually independent
and T; = Yi(D), i = 1, ...,m is a bounded interval. Moreover each Yi has a
smooth density function Pi : T, --+ R which are bounded away from zero.
Further ai(x) are sufficiently smooth functions . Denote T =
ll~ 1ri C
R'", and p(y) = II~IPi(Yi), Y E r.
Now we have
Theorem 3.1 Under assumptions Ql and Q4, the solution u(x ,w) =
u(x, Y1(w), ...,Ym(w)), y = (Y1(w), ...,Ym(w)) satisfies
B(u,v) = tp(y)1a(x,y)V'u(x,y) · V'v(x,y)dx dy
=t1p(y)f(x)v(x,y)dx dy
(3.9)
with u(x, y) E HJ(D) X L 2(F) and for any v E HJ(D) x L 2(r ).

Can We Trust the Computational Analysis of Engineering Problems?
181
Theorem 3.1 shows that we can transform the stochastic equation problem
into a deterministic one then can be solved by the finite element method.
All theoretical finite element method results can be utilized. For more and
numerical results refer to [35]. Using a specific form of the p-version of the
finite element method leads to the use of Wiener chaos polynomials proposed
in [36].

Conclusions
Trusting the computed data depends on
a) the mathematical model used - the validation;
b) the reliability of the approximate numerical solution characterized by
a-posteriori error estimation;
c) dealing with uncertain input data.

Abstract. We propose a use of some multiple-precision systems for numerical anal-
ysis of ill-conditioned problems, and we show efficiency of the systems through nu-
merical examples. We also introduce the F-system which is a fast multiple-precision
system designed by one of the authors.

Introduction
The aim of the paper is to show effective applications of multiple-precision
systems to some ill-conditioned problems and to show a design and an im-
plementation of a fast multiple-precision system (the F-system) proposed by
one of the authors. The ill-conditioned problems mean the problems which
contain numerically unstable processes in their numerical computations, and
we focus especially on those arising from discretizations of ill-posed problems
in the sense of Hadamard.
We should recall the influence of rounding errors in numerical computa-
tions on the floating point arithmetic. It is not assumed substantial in nu-
merically stable processes, but it may become crucial for the ill-conditioned
problems. Especially for discretizations of ill-posed problems, they are always
crucial, because the problems are too sensitive for perturbations.
The ill-posedness is opposite concept to the well-posedness, of which the
main concept consists in the stability against perturbations piercing to prob-
lems. We must fix a norm to estimate magnitude of the perturbations in
order to discuss well-posedness of problems, and in most of cases of well-
posed problems, we find such a nice discretization that we show stability of
its numerical processes by the norm. But we remark that the discretization
behave as an ill-conditioned problem even for the case, if the norm is not
suitable to estimate the influence of the rounding errors. For the ill-posed
problems, all their discretizations become ill-conditioned problems. We need
some device to stabilize their numerical processes, because the main reason
for instability of numerical solutions is rapid increase of the influence of the
rounding errors in their numerical processes.
We propose effective use of multiple-precision systems for numerical treat-
ments of ill-conditioned problems instead of stabilization techniques. In this
paper, we mean multiple-precision systems as the systems where we can ma-
nipulate as many digits in the floating point arithmetic as we wish. They lead

us to control the influence of the rounding errors to our request and are ex-
pected to give us new numerical tools to deal with ill-conditioned problems.
We will show some numerical examples by multiple-precision systems in the
present paper.
Multiple-precision systems have a fatal demerit of consumption of vast
computing time, and we need some ideas to overcome the demerit in order to
use them in practical computing. One of the authors has proposed a design
to improve and has succeeded in an implementation as the Fast Multiple-
precision system (F-system) in 2000. Refer to Fujiwara [1] for the details of
the F-system,
In the following sections, we show some numerical results of an inverse
scattering problems in §2 and those of a finite difference approach to the
Cauchy-Riemann equation in §3. Finally we introduce our multiple-precision
system.

Application to an Acoustic Inverse Scattering
(2.1)
(2.2)
(2.3)
IXI ~ +00,
We deal with numerical analysis of an inverse scattering problem to deter-
mine an unknown obstacle in the 2D wave field governed by the Helmholtz
equation. Our inverse problem is formulated by Kirsch-Kress [4], and we de-
termine the obstacle from the measurement of the far-field pattern.
Prior to the inverse problem, we pose a direct problem connected with
it. We denote x E rn? by x = (Xl,X2). Consider an exterior boundary value
problem of the Helmholtz equation in rn?;
.dus + k 2u s = 0
in
rn? \ D,
ui + US = 0
on
Bl),
where D is a simply connected domain and k is the wave number. We denote
the (given) incidental wave and the scattered wave by ui and US respectively,
and we pose the Sommerfeld radiation condition (2.3) to ensure the unique-
ness in the exterior problem for us. We suppose smoothness of aD to be
of C 2-class, and we call the open set D an obstacle. Since the fundamental
solution to the 2D Helmholtz equation is
E(x) = ~ HJ(klxl) ,
(2.4)
where HJ is the Hankel function of order zero and of the first kind, the unique
solution to (2.1) and (2.2) is written in
{{

US(x) = J

Numerical Computations for Ill-conditioned Problems

for x E ill? \ D, where n is the unit outward normal vector to aD. By
an application of the asymptotic expansion of E(x) to (2.4), there exists a
function uoo(x) on SI such that
Ixl-+ +00,
(2.5)
where x = x/lxl E SI. We call the function uoo(x) the far-field pattern.
Our inverse problem is to determine an unknown obstacle D by the mea-
surement of the far-field pattern uoo(x). We follow a method by Kirsch-
Kress [4J in order to reconstruct the obstacle using a priori information that
the unknown obstacle D contains the unit circle SI and that the solution US
of (2.1) and (2.2) is written by the single layer potential defined on SI . The
a priori information implies
where J..t(fi) is a density function on SI . From (2.6), we see

(2.7)
(2.8)
and its comparison with (2.5) leads us an integral equation for J..t(fi);
et
i r e-ik(xoy)J..t(fi) day = uoo(x)
x E SI.
J8rrk lSI
We look for the density function J..t(fi) by the measured far-field pattern uoo ,
and we give the solution US(x) by (2.6). We seek the unknown boundary
aD as the contour line of US + ui = 0, and we are able to reconstruct aD
numerically through discretization of this process. We call this idea the Kress
method, and refer to Kress [5J for details.
We note that the kernel of the integral equation (2.8) is analytic, and the
equation becomes ill-posed within the class of the Sobolev spaces. We need a
discretized version of the Tikhonov regularization to stabilize discretizations
for (2.8) in usual computations, but we apply a multiple-precision system
instead of it in the present research. Since we restrict ourselves to show effec-
tiveness of a multiple-precision system, we adopt the Fourier series method
in discretization.
We explain our numerical computations. We firstly approach to the direct
problem (2.1) and (2.2) by the boundary element technique to obtain the
unknown Neumann data ausIan on aD. Since we have a closed formula
to express the far-field pattern U oo by using the Dirichlet data U S and the
Neumann data aus[Bn, we can calculate the far-field pattern for a known
obstacle by the formula. We start reconstruction of aD by the Kress method

188

from the calculated far-field pattern. We discretize this process and construct
numerical examples shown later.

for the (unknown) Neumann data q := Bu"jan. The integral equation is
uniquely solvable as far as k 2 belongs to the resolvent set p(-.:1) . We will show
numerical results for the case of k = 10 and aD = {(Xl, X2) IXl = 2 cos 0,X2 =
~ sin 0, 0 :::; 0 < 271'}, and the incidental wave ui is a plane wave. We use
the REAL*16 and the UBASIC with about 96 digits in radix-lO as our com-
putational environments. The REAL*16 is one of the extended formats of
IEEE754 [3] and available on a package of the FORTRAN, and it ensures
about 32 digits in radix-lO. The UBASIC is a Japanese software of a multiple-
precision system working on personal computers and is widely used in the
research of the number theory.

behaviors of {an}~=_M for M = 256. We notice that we can calculate {an}
up to [n] ~ 220 in the UBASIC but that we obtain them only up to Inl ~ 90

For the inverse problem, we calculate the unknown J.L(fi) in the equat ion
(2.8) by the same manner from the computed far-field pattern Uoo,M , which
is obtained from ui and qM. We denote our numerical solution by J.LM.
We give the solution aD to the inverse problem in advance and try nu-
merical reconstructions in the research , and we define the discretization error
e M by the maximum of lui +ukl on aD , where uk is given by
uk(x) = r E(x - f))J.LM(Y) do-y

We observe in Fig .2 that we obtain accurate numerical solutions up to n ~ 90
in REAL*!6 and that we get them up to more than n ~ 160 in the UBASIC.
We notice from Fig.2 that numerical solutions by the Kress method seem
converge exponentially to the exact solution. Some other examples are seen
in Saito [8] .
These simple numerical examples clearly explain the efficiency of applica-
tions of multiple-precision systems to ill-conditioned problems. But we must
note that the UBASIC consumes very much time in each computation; it is
aimed for the research of number theory and is not aimed for large scale prob-
lems arising from the discretizations of functional equations such as integral

equations and PDE's etc. We should improve a multiple-precision system, if
we wish to apply multiple-precision systems to numerical analysis connected
with PDE's. We succeed in construction of a fast multiple-precision system
(F-system), which is introduced in §4.

Cauchy-Riemann Equation
We deal with a finite difference approach to the initial value problem of the
Cauchy-Riemann equation in this section and we give some numerical results
given by the F-system. The problem is equivalent to the harmonic extension
across a boundary of a domain, and it is one of the typical ill-posed problems.
We firstly refer to a theory of finite difference schemes in the class of
analytic functions by Hayakawa [2] . Let A be a constant square matrix and
consider the initial value problem
a
a
atu(t,x) = Aaxu(t,x),
u(O, x) = uo(x),
(3.1)
(3.2)
where u and Uo are vector valued functions. If uo(x) is analytic on an interval
containing x = 0, there exists a unique analytic solution in a neighborhood
V of the origin. We consider a finite difference scheme
Uh(t + Llt, x) = AAuh(t, X+ Llx) + (I - AA)Uh(t, x)
(3.3)
Uh(O, x) = uo(x)
(3.4)
in order to approximate the solution in the neighborhood, where A = Llt/LlX>
°and I is the identity. According to the theory, we have the following theo-
rem.
Theorem 1. (Hayakawa [2J) Suppose uo(x) to be analytic near x = 0, and
define Uh(t, x) (t ~ 0) by (3.3) and (3.4) for a fixed A. Then there exists a
domain D contained in the neighborhood V of the origin such that Uh(t, x) uni-
formly converges to the exact solution to (3.1) and (3.2) on D as Llt, Llx ...... O.
We remark that the theorem covers the case
(3.5)
and that the finite difference solution Uh converges to the exact solution
without stability; the equation (3.1) becomes the Cauchy-Riemann equation
for the case (3.5), and we know the scheme (3.3) to be unstable.
We will show some numerical examples by the scheme (3.3) for

We remark again that our problem is ill-posed and that the scheme is
unstable. Fig.3 and Fig.4 show the instability, and meaningful calculations
cannot be done in the double precision. We think that the fatal influence
in unstable schemes should be the rounding errors, and we use a multiple-
precision system to remove them virtually. Fig.5 and Fig.6 show good coin-
cidence of computed values in 100 digits in radix-lO with the exact ones at
t = 0.55. But we notice that 100 digits comparison is not enough for the case
oft = 0.65 (Fig.7 and Fig.8), and we need 120 digits for the case (Fig.9 and
Fig.lO).

We conclude that a multiple-precision computation is a powerful tool for
numerical computation for unstable problems, but we should know necessary
digits in computations in advance. And the F-system is aimed for compu-
tation for large scale problems, and we can save much time in computation
with the UBASIC. Refer to Fujiwar a [1] for the det ailed data of computing
by the F-system.

Fast Multiple-precision System (F-system)
In this section, we give a brief introduction of the Fast Multiple-precision
System (F-system) implemented by one of the authors. Refer to Fujiwara [1]
for details.
Our aim is numerical treatment of ill-conditioned problems arising in en-
gineering and physics, and we need a fast computer system in which we can
represent and operate real numb ers without the rounding errors. To this end,
we choose a strategy that we can fix an arbitrary (finite) precision to represent

Numerical Computations for Ill-conditioned Problems
193
and to calculate approximated real numbers within the prescribed precision .
We call it a multiple-precision arithmetic system, which is considered one of
the extended formats. Though we cannot remove the rounding errors even
by the strategy, we virtually carry out exact numerical computations on the
floating point arithmetic. The term 'virtual' means that we control significant
digits to avoid the influence of the rounding errors as much as we wish, and
we are able to obtain numerical results as precisely as we wish.
The principles of the design for the F-system are;
- fast computing,
- using less memory, which enables us to deal with large scale problems,
- fully designed in 64bit base; possibility of high performance with resources
of the typical next generation computer environments,
- equipment of easy interfaces for accesses of low end users.
The most important features in the construction of a fast multiple-precision
system are data structure and implementation of improved arithmetic algo-
rithms.
We firstly explain a format of multiple-precision numbers in the F-system.
We adopt an original extension of the floating point format designed in
IEEE754 (see [3]). Each real number is normalized in the form (_1)8 X 2e x
l.F, where the sign part s has one bit, the exponent part e has 63bit, and
the fraction part F = hh ···In has 64 X n bit. (Each Ii has 64bit width.)
This type of floating point multiple-precision numbers are stored in mem-
ory using the 64bit unsigned integer array, and accuracy of the numbers
is loglO 264n +l (,,-, 19.26 x n) digits, and the above mentioned real number
(_1)8 X 2e x l.F is
where b = 262 - l.
One of the advantages of the design is cost performance in the use of
memory. The ALU (Arithmetic Logical Unit) of 64bit CPU's is more advan-
tageous in accuracy than the FPU (Floating Point Unit), and we can use all
bits in the integer array which stores a fraction part of the multiple-precision
format according to our design.
We are enough to use less memory than in the case of IEEE754 double
format number array, and our system enables us to deal with larger scale
problems. At the same time, since a number of necessary elements of the
array decreases, and since the memory access and branch operators are less
issued, we succeed in speed up in computation. We remark that our 64bit
integer base representation and operation should be a remarkable feature of
the design and have an advantage.

194
Yuusuke Iso, Hiroshi Fujiwara and Kimihiro Saito
We secondly mention about improvement and implementation of arith-
metic algorithms. In our system, the arithmetic for multiple-precision num-
bers is designed as external routines of the programming language C (LP 64
model). We choose the Alpha system as a 64bit computing environment in
the present research. The four fundamental rules for multiple-precision arith-
metic, multiplication by integer, and division by integer are implemented in
the Alpha assembly language and are optimized for its architecture. The clas-
sical algorithms are used in addition and in subtraction, and we adopt the
classical algorithm (O( n2 ) ) and Karatsuba-Offman's algorithm (O( n'og23))
in multiplication (see [6]). In division, we implement an improved Ozawa's
algorithm (see [7]).
Considering usability, we should design multiple-precision systems as mod-
ules of an existing programming language, and we implement our system as
external routines of the programming language C. But we should note that
the language C has a disadvantage in vulnerability of the argument types etc;
users should be requested to parse formulas in their programming. These pro-
cesses are burdens for the users, and we remark that we design the interface
of the F-system by use of the polymorphism supplied by the programming
language C++.
We are sure that a fast multiple-precision system, which is applicable to
large scale problems, should become a powerful new tool in computational
mathematics, and our research is one of the first steps to overcome difficulties
in the computation of the ill-conditioned problems.

Abstract. In this paper, we consider numerical techniques which enable us to ver-
ify the existence of solutions for the free boundary problems governed by two kinds
of elliptic variational inequalities(EVIs). Based upon the finite element approxima-
tions and the explicit a priori error estimates for some simple EVIs, we present
effective verification procedures that, through numerical computation, generate a
set which includes exact solutions. We describe a survey of the previous works as
well as show some newly obtained results up to now.

Introduction
The authors have studied for years the numerical verification of solutions
for elliptic partial differential equations([8][9)[ll]etc .) and ellipt ic variational
inequalities(EVIs) using the finite element method and the constructive er-
ror estimates combining with Schauder's and Banach's fixed point theorem.
Several results in our research are already published in [12]'[17]'[19]. In this
paper, we briefly overview our recent research results including works not yet
published.
In Section 2, so-called first kind problems of EVI are considered. Namely,
in 2.1, we first give, a slight ly detailed description of the basic principle and
formulation of our numerical verification method for the solution of obstacle
problems with a homogeneous condition. This should be an appropriate intro-
duction to another applications of our idea. The basic approach of the method
consists of the fixed point formulation of the problems and construction of the
function set, in a computer, satisfying the validation condition of a cert ain in-
finite dimensional fixed point theorem. We also mention that it is possible to
extend the method to more general problems with non-homogeneous obsta-
cles. Moreover, in order to apply our method to the problem whose associated
operator is not retractive in a neighborhood of the solution, a Newton-like
method is introduced.
Next, in 2.2, we apply our method to another type of free boundary
problem which appears in the elasto-plastic deformation theory. This problem
causes some properties of non-smoothness in the associated finite dimensional

equations. But, we can also overcome such a difficulty by applying the solution
method for non-smooth problems developed by [3]. In the subsection 2.3, we
briefly remark that our enclosure method can also be applied to the so-
called simplified Sigorini problem which is a simplified version of a problem
occurring in the elasticity theory.
Finally, in Section 3, we show the way to apply our approach to EVls of
the second kind appearing in the flow problems of a visco-plastic fluid in a
pipe.

2.1
Obstacle problem
In this subsection, we consider the verification method for solutions of the
obstacle problem which is known as a free boundary problem cahracterizing
the contacted zone with the obstacle of an elastic membrane.
2.1.1 Homogeneous case
Here, 'homogeneous' stands for the case that obstacle 'IjJ = 0 in the whole
domain.
Problem and basic formulation of verification Though the basic idea
of verification is given in other places(e.g., [17],[19]), in order to keep the
paper as self-contained as possible, we describe rather detailed formulation
and verification procedure for the present case.
Let fl be a bounded convex domain in R"; 1 ~ n ~ 2, with a piecewise
smooth boundary afl. We set V = HJ(fl) = {v E Hl(fl) : vlan = O} and
a(u, v) = (\7u ,\7v)
which is adopted as the inner product on V, where (., .) stands for the inner
product on £2(fl) . We define K := {v E V : v 2:: 0 a.e. on fl}.
First, we note that, by the well-known result [7], for any g E £2(fl), the
problem:
a(u,v-u) 2:: (g,v-u),
VVEK,
UEK,
has a unique solution u E V n H 2(fl ), and the estimate
(1)
(2)
holds (ef.[7]), where IwlH2 implies the semi-norm of win H 2(fl) defined by

Now consider the following EVI with a nonlinear right-hand side:
{
Find w E K
such that
a(w, v - w) ~ (J(w), v - w),
"Iv E K.
(3)
Here, assume that f satisfies the hypotheses as follows:
AI. f is the continuous map from V into L2(n).
A2. For each bounded subset WE V, f(W) is also bounded in L 2(n ).
We take an appropriate finite dimensional subspace Vh of V for 0 < h < 1.
Usually, Vh is taken to be a finit e element subspace with mesh size h. We
then define Kh, an approximation of K , by
We also define the projection PK from V onto K . That is, v = PK(w), the
projection of w E V into K , is defined as the unique solution of the following
problem:
v E K:
a(v ,(- v)~a(w,(- v) ,
V(EK.
(4)
And define the projection PKh from V onto Kh. That is, Vh = PK,, (w) , the
projection of w into Kh , is defined as follows:
Now, as one of the approximation properties of K h , assume that
A3. For each w E K n H2(n), there exists a positive constant C1 , inde-
pendent of h, such that
(6)
Here, C1 has to be numerically determined. For example, it is known that
we may take C1 =
-.:: for the linear element in the one dimensional case[17].
Furthermore, it will be readily seen that the same const ant can be taken for
the two dimensional bilinear element from the consideration on the proof of
Theorem 5.1 in [17].
To verify the existence of a solution of (3) in a computer, we use the fixed
point formulation.
First, note that, for each w E V, there exists a unique F(w) E V such that
(\7F(w),\7v) = (J (w),v),
"Iv E V,
which also implies that
{
-LlF(w) = f(w ) in a,
F(w) = 0 on an.

Then the map F : V ~ V is compact. By (7), problem (3) is equivalent
to finding w E V such that
a(w,v - w) ~ a(F(w),v - w),
Vv E K.
(9)
By using the definition (4) and (9), we now have the following fixed point
problem for the compact operator PK F.
Find w E V such that w = PKF(w).
(10)
Verification condition We introduce two concepts, rounding and rounding
error, which enable us to deal with the infinite dimensional problem by finite
procedures, i.e., in a computer.
Now we define the dual cone of Kh by
K;' = {w E V: a(w,v) ~ 0,
Vv E Kh},
and note that Kit is also a closed convex cone in V with vertex at the origin
with is the only point common to Kh and Kit. From (5) it follows that Kit
is the null set of the projection PK h • We have the following lemma which is
from [13].
Lemma 1. Any w
E V can be uniquely decomposed into the sum of two
orthogonal elements. That is,
w = PKhw ffi(I - PKh)W = PKhwEBPKi..W.
Here, EB denotes the sum of two orthogonal elements in the sense of V.
For any w E V, we now define the rounding R(PKF(w)) E K h by the solution
of the following problem:
Next, for any subset W C V, we define the rounding R(PKFW) C Kh by
Usually, R(PK FW) is enclosed and represented as a linear conbination of the
base functions in Vh with interval coefficients.
Moreover, for W c V, we define RE(PKFW), the rounding error of
PKFW, as a subset of Kit, i.e.,
RE(PKFW) = {v E Kit : Ilvllv ~ Cohllf(W)IIL2},
(11)
where
Ilf(W)II£2 == sup IIf(w)IIp·

Here, Co == C1C2 , where C1 is the same positive constant as in (6), and C2
is determined by the following regularity estimate for the solution to (1) of
the form
(12)
Thus we may take as C2 = 1 for the present case from (2). Then, we have
Therefore, the following verification condition is obtained by Schauder's fixed
point theorem.
Lemma 2. If there exists a nonempty, bounded, convex, and closed subset
W c K such that
(13)
then there exists a solution of w = PKF(w) in W .
We sometimes refer the above set W as a candidate set, which we generate
in a computer so that it satisfies the condition (13).
Verification procedures We describe below the method to find a set W
satisfying (13).
Consider the following approximate solution Wh E Ki; of (1):
(14)
Since the bilinear form a( . , . ) is symmetric, (14) is reduced to the quadratic
programming problem:
min [~a(v,v) - (g,V)].
vEKh

(15)
Let {cPj}j=l...M be a basis of Vh with usual linear functions such that
cPj(x) 2:: 0,
'<Ix En and satisfying
where Xi is a node of the finite element mesh. Then (15) reduces to the
following vector form:
min [~WIDw - p1w] ,
w~o

(16)

where w 2: 0 means the componentwise relation. Here , D := (dij h:5i,j:5M
with dij = ('9¢i, '9¢j), and w is the coefficient vector with {¢j} of the func-
tion v in (15). Also, P := ((9, ¢j))
.
l'Sj'SM
Furthermore, for any a E R+, nonnegative real number, we set
[a] == {¢ E Ki. :
11¢llv::; a}.
Then, for a given candidate set W = Wh EB [a] with Wh c Kh' the computa-
tion of the rounding R(PKFW) reduces to enclose an interval vector Z = (Zj)
and Y = (Yj) satisfying the following nonlinear system of equations(see [17]
for details):
(17)
1 $j s M,
{
Y - DZ = -(J(~), ¢j),
YjZj = 0,
1::; J ::; M.
Here, (J(W),¢j) is evaluated as an interval Bj such that {(J(w),¢j)lw E
W} c Bj • In order to solve (17) with guaranteed accuracy, we use some
interval approaches for the nonlinear system of equations(e,g., [14]). Thus,
using the solution of (17), we can enclose the set R(PKFW) in (13). Com-
bining this with (11), we can successfully compute the left-hand side of (13)
for any candidate set W = Wh EB [a].
Thus we can present a computational verification condition. In the ac-
tual computation, we use an iterative procedure with 6-inflation technique
to find the set W satisfying (13)(cj[10],[17]etc.). Several numerical examples
for verification are presented in [17], for the one dimensional problem using
the linear finite element.
2.1.2 Non-homogeneous case
For the non-homogeneous case, we define K := {v E V : v 2: 'l/J a.e. on n},
where 'l/J is a given H 2(n) function such that 'l/J ::; 0 on an and is not identi-
cally equal to O. In this case, we take Vh as in 2.1.1 and define Kh by
where Nh denotes the set of all nodes associated with the subspace Vh . Note
that, in general, Kh -; Vh n K. Then, PK and PK h are similarly defined
as before, and we also have the constructive error estimates of the form,
VVh E Ki; and Vv E K ,
Based upon this inequality and the similar arguments to that in [6], by using
the approximation property of K h and the constructive regularity estimates

of the form: luIH2 ~ rP(g, 'IjJ) for the solution uof the variational inequality of
the same type as (1), we can obtain the desired error estimates. Here rP(g, 'IjJ)
is a nonlinear and constructive function of 9 and 'IjJ( see [6]). Detailed argu-
ments and numerical examples will be given in forthcoming paper[18].
2.1.3 A Newton-type verification method
The idea of the enclosure method for solutions of obstacle problems in
2.1.1 is based upon simply sequential iterations for the original fixed point
operator PKF. Therefore, it is difficult to apply the method to the problem of
which associated operator is not retractive in a neighborhood of the solution.
In order to overcome such a difficulty, we introduce an another formulation
using a Newton-like operator. The essential point is the way to devise the
Newton-like operator for a kind of non-differentiable map which defines the
original problem.
To formulate a Newton-type verification condition, we need a Frechet
derivative of the operator PKF. However, PKF is not Frechet differentiable
at all. Therefore, we define the approximate Frechet-like derivative 15KF(Uh)
on Vh for some Uh E Kh instead of the Frechet derivative. Assume that
{¢j}j=I...M is a basis of Vh , where M = dim Vh, such that ¢j(x) 2: a on n
and satisfying
A, (
)
{1,i=j,
'l'j X i =
a . -i.
.
,
~ rJ,
where X i is a node of the finite element mesh.
And , for u t, E Vh, we represent it such as
M
Vh = L Vhj¢j'
j=1
Here, (Vhj)j=I ,...,M is called as the coefficient vector of Vh. Now we take a
fixed subset No C {1, 2, ·· · , M} , define Vh,No, the closed subspace of Vh, by
And let Ph,No be a HJ-projection from V onto Vh,No defined by
In order to define 15KF(uh) : Vh ~ Vh,No, we differentiate the first
equation of (17) in W at W = Uh to get, for arbitrary 0 E Vh,
(19)
Here, BY* =
(YJ*h~j~M and BZ' = (Z;h~j~M ' where YJ* = a for j E No
and Z; = afor j tf. No, respectively.

202
Mitsuhiro T. Nakao and Cheon Seoung Ryoo
Then we define the approximate Frechet-like derivative of PKF(u) at
u = Uh , as the linear map 15KF(Uh) : Vh --t Vh,No such that, for each
s E Vh ,
M
15KF(Uh)(O) := L z/ (1Ji.
j=l
We now assume that
A4. The restriction to Vh,No of the operator Ph,No [I-15KF (Uh)] : Vh --t
Vh,No has the inverse operator
-
-1
[Ph,No - DKF(Uh)]h
: Vh,No --t Vh,No'
Here, I means the identity map on Vh.
By using the above approximate Frechet-Iike derivative, we define the
Newton-like operator Nh : V --t Vh by
-
-1
Nh(W) == PKhW - [Ph,No - DKF(Uh)]h Ph,No(PKh - PKhPKF)(w)).
Next we define the operator T : V --t V as follows:
Then T becomes a compact map on V and it follows the fixed point problem
w = PKFw is equivalent to w = T(w). Hence, we can formulate a Newton-
type verification condition such as in [10]. By using this formulation, we
succeed the enclosure for the solutions of problems for which the previously
sequential iteration method could not work(see [19] for numerical examples).
2.2
Elasto-plastic torsion problems
In this subsection, we consider an enclosure metnod of solutions for elasto-
plastic torsion problems governed by an EVI. The nonlinear elasto-plastic
torsion problem is defined as the same type EVI as (3) with
K := {v E HJ(fl) : I\i'vl :::; 1
a.e, on fl} .
(20)
As is well known(e.g., [5], [13]), two sub-domains fl p and fl e defined by
flp = {x : x E fl , I\i'ul = I} ,
and
fl e = fl\flp = {x: x E fl,l\i'ul < I}
correspond to the plastic and elastic regions, respectively. The elastic region
fl e and the plastic region fl p are not known beforehand and should be deter-
mined, therefore afle n aflp is actually the free boundary of the problem (3).
The problem (3) has been formulated as the problem of finding U satisfying
{
-..du = !(u) , in a.,
I\i'ul = 1
In flp ,
(21)
U = 0
on afl.

(23)
Numerical Verification Methods
203
The finite dimensional convex subset Kh is also defined similarly as before:
In order to formulate the verification procedure, we need a verified com-
putational method for solving the finite dimensional part(rounding) and a
constructive estimates for infinite dimensional part(rounding error) as in the
previous subsection.
Following [7], we define the Lagrangian functional I:- associated with (1)
by
l:-(v,j.L) = ~in IVvl2dx - (9,v) + ~in j.L(IVvI2 -l)dx.
It follows, from [7], that if I:- has a saddle point {u, A} E HJ(fl) x L'+(fl),
then u is a solution of (1), where L,+(fl) = {q E LOO(fl) : q :::: 0 a.e. in fl} .
We use the Uzawa algorithm to solve (1)([7]).
Thus we can claculate the rounding R( PKF(W)), for a candidate set W,
by solving the following problem with guaranteed error bounds:
{
Find {Uh , Ah} E tc, x Ah
such that
Ah = max[Ah + p(IVUhI2 - 1),0] with p > o.
J.n(1 + Ah)VUh . VVhdx = (J(W), Vh), VVh E Vh , Uh E Vh ,
The problem (23) can be formulated as a system of nonlinear and nonsmooth
(nondifferentiable) equations. A verification method for nonsmooth equations
by a generalized Krawczyk operator is studied in [3]. We briefly describe the
method presented by [3] in the below.
We consider the following equivalent system of nonlinear( and nondiffer-
entiable ) equations to (23) for a fixed W E W
H(x) = o.
(24)
Here, we assume that H : R" -
Rn is locally Lipschitz continuous. The
equivalence means that x* solves (23) if and only if x* solves (24). The method
is based on the mean value theorem for local Lipschitz functions of the form
H(x) - H(y) E co8H([x])(x - y), for all x, y E [x],
where [x] stands for an interval vector, "co" denotes the convex hull, and 8H
the generalized Jacobian in Clarke's sense [4], which is also considered as a
slope function, and
co8H([x]) := co{V E 8H(x): x E [x]}.
Let [L[xJl be an interval matrix such that co8H([x])
~ [L[xJl . Then for any
x,y E [x] ~ R" it holds that H(x) - H(y) E [L[xJl(x - y). Next an interval
operator for nonsmooth equations is defined by
G(x, A, [x]) := x - A-1H(x) + (I - A-I [L[x]])([x] - x).
(25)

204

The mapping G(x,A, [x]) is called a generalized Krawczyk operator. There-
fore, the verification condition of solutions for (24) in [x] is given by G(x, A, [x])
~[x]CD.
Thus, we can compute the solution of (23) with guaranteed accuracy.
That is, we can enclose the rounding R(PKF(U)).
On the other hand, for the calculation of the rounding error RE(PKF(U)) ,
the similar arguements in 2.1.1 can also be applied for the one dimensional
problem. Actually, we can prove that the same constant Co = ¥ is also valid
for the present problem in the one dimensinal case, which implies that we
can give a verification procedure besed on the same principle as before(see,
[12]).
2.3
Signorini problem
A simplified Signorini problem is also given by the EVI of the form (3) with
and
K := {v E HJ(n) : Iv ~ 0
on 8n}
a(u, v) == (V'u,V'v) + (u, v) .
(26)
(27)
As well known, the solution u of this EVI can be characterized as a solution
of the following free boundary problem finding u and two subsets To and T+
such that To U T+ = 8n and To n T+ = 0
-Llu +u = f(u) in n,
8u
u = 0 on To, 8n
~ 0 on To,
8u
u> 0 on T+, 8n = 0 on T+,
(28)
where :n the outer normal derivative on 8n. In the present case, the ap-
proximation subspace Kh is taken as
(29)
For a candidate set W, the computation of rounding R(PKF(W)) is also
reduced to the quadratic programming problem as in 2.1.1([22], [7]).
Since the constant C2 in (12) is easily estimated as C2 = 1, the stan-
dard approximation property of the interpolation by Kh gives a constructive
error estimates to compute the rounding error RE(PKF(W)) . The detailed
computational procedures and numerical examples will be described in the
forthcoming paper [20] .

EVI of the second kind
In this section, we show that our idea of verification method can also be
applied to the EVI of the second kind.
Now, we define the functional j (v) = In l'Vvldx. We consider the following
problem of the flow of a viscous plastic fluid in a pipe:
{
Find u E HJ (D)
such that
(30)
a(u, v - u) + j (v) - j (u) ~ (f(u),v - u) ,
"Iv E HJ(D).
As in the previous section, we consider the following auxiliary problem asso-
ciat ed with (30) for a given 9 E L2(D) :
a(u ,v - u) + j(v) - j (u) ~ (g, v - u), "Iv E HJ(D) ,u E HJ(D) .
(31)
By the well known result [2]' we have the following lemma.
Lemma 3. ([2J)
There exists a unique solution u E HJ(D) n H 2(D) of
(31) for any 9 E £2, such that
IluIIH2(n) ::; Cllgllu(n).
This lemma follows by obvious modification in the proof of Theorem 15 in [2J.
When we denote the solution u of (31) by u = Ag and define the composite
map F on HJ(D) by F(u) = Af(u), which is a little bit of different from the
previously appeared symbol F in Section 2, we have
Theorem 4. F is compact on HJ(D) and the problem (30) is equivalent to
the fixed point problem
u = F(u).
Proof. First, for a bounded subset U c L2(D) , we show that AU C HJ(D)
is relatively compact. Secondly, prove that A : L 2(D) --+ HJ (D) is continuous.
By Lemma 3, AU C H 2(D) n HJ(D) and AU is bounded in H 2(D). Since
U is bounded in L2(D), by the Sobolev imbedding theorem, we have AU
is relatively compact in HJ(D) . Next, for arbitrary ft, h
E L 2(D) , setting
Ul = Aft and U2 = Ah, by using (31), we obtain
a(ul ,U2 - Ul) + j (U2 ) - j(Ul) ~ (ft,U2 - uI),
a(u2,Ul - U2)+ j(uI) - j(U2) ~ (f2, Ul - U2) .
With the above inequalities, we obtain a(U2- Ul , U2- uI) = -a(Ul, U2- Ul) +
a(u2, U2 - uI) ::; j(U2) - j (u I) - (ft,U2 - Ul) +j(uI) - j (U2 ) - (f2,Ul - U2) =
(f2 - ft,U2 - Ul). Hence , by the Poincare inequality, we have

206
Mitsuhiro T . Nakao and Cheon Seoung Ryoo
Therefore, we obtain
That is, A is Lipschitz continuous as a map L 2(.fl) --+ HJ(.fl). Hence A is
compact. The latter half in the theorem is straightforward from the definition
of F .
We now define the approximate problem corresponding to (31) as
In order to apply our verification method to enclose the solutions of (30), we
need a guaranteed computation of the exact solution of the problem (32)( a
rounding procedure), as well as the constructive error estimates between the
solution of (31) and (32)(rounding error estimates).
A major difficulty in solving the problem (32) numerically is the pro-
cessing of the nondifferentiable term j(u) = In lV'uldx. One approach is the
method of Lagrange multiplier on that term, whose continuous version is as
follows [71. Let us define A =
q I q E L 2(fl) x L 2(.fl) , Iq(x)1 :s: 1 a.e, x E .fl}
with Iq(x)1 =
ql(x)2 +q2(x)2. Then the solution u of (31) is equivalent to
the existence of q satisfying
{
a(u, v) + Cs- V'v = (9, v), Vv E HJ(.fl) ,u E HJ(.fl) ,
Jf,
(33)
q. V'u = lV'ul a.e. ,q E A,
which means the simultaneous equations for two unknown functions u and q.
Moreover, it is known that (33) is equivalent to the following problem:
{
a(u,v) + In q -V'v = (9, v), Vv E HJ(.fl) ,u E HJ(.fl),
q + pV'u
(34)
q = sup(l, Iq + pV'ul)'
Here p is a positive constant. Let 1h be a triangulation of .fl, and let define
Lh and Ah ( approximation of U'O(.fl) x LOO(fl) and A, respectively) by
Lh = {%I % = L qrXTl qr E R2} and Ah = An Lh , respectively,
-et;
where Xr is the characteristic function of T.
Then our first purpose, computing the rounding RF(U), is to enclose the
solution of the following approximation problem of (34):
(35)

Numerical Verification Methods
207
The equation (35) leads to a kind of finite dimensional, nonlinear and non-
differentiable problem. We use a slope function method proposed by Rump
[15],[16] to enclose the solutions of (35) with 9 = f(W) for a candidate set
W .
On the other hand, the rounding error RE(F(U)) can be computed by
using the following constructive error estimates:
Theorem 5. Let u and Uh be solutions of (31) and (32),
respectively. If
9 E L2(st), then there exists a constant C(h) such that
(36)
Here, we may take C(h) = '-:!h for the linear element in the one dimensional
case, and C is also numerically estimated such that C(h) ~ O(h!) for the
two dimensional linear element.
The proof of this theorem would be described in the forthcoming paper[21].
Thus we can also implement the verification algorithm for the solution of
(30) as in the previous section.
A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE.
Let st = (0,1). We considered the case f(u) = Qu + 4, where Q is a
constant. We used the usual linear element with uniform mesh size h = iJ,
where M denotes the total number of elememts.
The execution conditions are as follows:
{
Q = 1.
Numbers of elements(M)
= 41.
dimVh = 40.
Approximate solution: Uh =
Galerkin approximation (32).
Approximate locations of free boundary: x = 0.238095 and x = 0.761905.
Verified results are as follows:
{
Iteration numbers : 12.
HJ - error bound: 0.027202.
Maximum width of coefficient intervals of ¢>j = 0.072109.

Abstract. We consider the Rayleigh-Benard problem of the heat convection in the
horizontal strip with the stress freeboundary condition for the velocity and Dirichlet
boundary condition for the temperature. We examine the pattern formation of the
roll type solution, the rectangular type solution and the hexagonal type solution
and see the stability of them and a better bifurcation diagram for the full system
by using numerical computations.

Introduction
We consider the Rayleigh-Benard problem for the heat convection using the
Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations for the velocity, pressure and temperature in
the dimensionless form :
1 au
p(fit + u · \7u) + \7p =
L\u - p(T)\7z ,
aT
fit+u.\7T = L\T
,
\7 ·u = 0,
in the horizontal domain {x E R, y E R , 0 < z < rr} , where p(T) = G-RT
is assumed for the density of the fluid, P is the Prandtl number and R is
the Rayleigh number.
When the temperature T = rr is given on the lower boundary and T = 0
on the upper boundary, the equilibrium state is the purely heat conduction
solution, which exists for all parameter values P > 0, R > 0 :
rr2
z2
u = 0 , T = rr-z , p = G-R(rr-z) , p = G(rr-z)-R("2-rrz+"2)+Pa .
We assume the stress free boundary condition for the velocity on the both
boundaries ( z = 0, rr ), and Dirichlet boundary condition for the temperature
as above.
We will consider the bifurcation problems from this equilibrium state
under the assumption that all perturbations are periodic in the horizontal
direction, especially with the periodicity 0 S x S 2rr/ a, 0 S y S 2rr/ b . The
system for the perturbation to the equilibrium state is given by

Also we assume the usual even- or odd-ness conditions for the unknown func-
tions :
U(x,y, z) = -u(- x ,y, z) =
u(x, -y, z) ,
v(x, y, z) =
v(- x ,y, z)

O(x, -y, z) ,
p(x,y,z) =

p(x , -y, z) .
Then the unknown functions have the expansions :

The incompressibility condition is given for each l ,m, n by the following :

The function spaces for the solution are the following :

The linearized system is selfadjoint and has real eigenvalues as follows. Sub-
stituting the above expressions for the solution such as :
8(t, x , y, z)
=
81m n(O) eAt cos alx cos bmy sin nz ,
we have the eigenvalue problem for A, which can be solved explicitly. The
eigenvalues have the following forms for each
Z, m , n .
A3 = _PA2 ,
A± =
~ (-(1 +P)A2 ± Jr"(I-+-P-)2-A-4-+-4--"(a-=2-cZ2=-+-b2=-m-;=-]-R"""'2---P-A-6 ) ,
where
A2 = a2Z2+b2m2+n2 .
For each (Z, m , n) - mode A3 and A_ are always negative, but

R

(a2z2 + b2m2)
Therefore the critical Rayleigh number for fixed (a,b) is
Thus we know ( [9] ) that
If R < R c , then the heat conduction state is linearly stable.
If R > R c , then the heat conduction state is linearly unstable.
Furthermore Joseph ( [5] ) proved by energy method that
if R < R c , then the heat conduction state is globally nonlinearly stable.
Therefore when the biggest eigenvalue becomes A+ = a at the critical
Rayleigh number R c for fixed a and b and it is "simple", the usual stationary
bifurcation theory can be applied and the stationary bifurc ation occurs at
the critical Rayleigh number. If we examine the function
we see that R c attains the minimum value 6.75 at a = 1/V2. ( R c = 6.75 X 11"4
for the usual dimensionless system. ) The minimum value 6.75 is attained at
a = I/V2, (Z,m,n) = (1,0,1), at a = I/2V2, (Z,m,n) = (2,0,1), and so on.
We have considered two dimensional problems, namely roll type solutions on
the extended bifurcation curves for the case a = 1/V2 and proved the exis-
tence of the solutions not close to the first bifurcation point R
= R c = 6.75
by a computer assisted proof [12] . Here we consider the three dimensional
problem to obtain not only roll type solutions but also rectangular type so-
lutions and hexagonal type solutions.

Rectangular Type Solution and Hexagonal Type
Solution
To see the pattern formation clearly we choose special aspect ratio b/a = J3
and a = 1/2.;2 , which is one of the most interesting case, where the critical
Rayleigh number nc =6.75 and the biggest eigenvalue>. =°for n =nc has
a two-dimensional eigenspace. One eigen-function with (l,m,n) = (2,0,1)
corresponds to the roll type solution:
() = ()201 cos(2ax) sin z .
Here we only express the temperature for the eigen-function, but the other
unknowns have similar expressions. The other eigen-function with (l, m, n) =
(1, 1, 1) does to the rectangular type
solution :
() = ()111 cos(ax) cos(V3ay) sin z .
Furthermore a linear combination of them does to the hexagonal type solu-
tion:
() = ()hex { 2 cos(ax) cos(V3ay) sin z + cos(2ax) sin z} .
Thus the simple bifurcation theory does not apply directly to this case.
To obtain the roll type solution by the simple bifurcation theory we have
to restrict the function space H 2 M3
to the subspace H;oll as follows : For
a,vva
example the temperature has the following expansion.
00
00
()=2: 2:
n=O l+n=even
()1 ,O,n cos(2alx) sin(nz).
Then the eigenvalue >. =°becomes simple at 'R: =nc =6.75 , and the
simple stationary bifurcation theory applies to this and we obtain the roll
type solution which bifurcates from the point for R: > R c . (cf. [4] )
To obtain the rectangular type solution we can restrict the function space
H 2 M3
to the subspace Hr~ct as follows:
a,v.>a
00
() = 2:

2:
()l,m,n cos(alx) cos(V3amy) sin(nz) .
n=even l+m=even,l,m=even
The other unknowns have similar expansions. In this subspace the simple
bifurcation theory applies to the system and the stationary bifurcation of
rectangular type solution occurs at the critical Rayleigh number.

The other unknowns have similar expansions to that of temperature. In this
subspace we have the bifurcation of hexagonal type solut ion. Here we notice
that by the global nonlinear stability theorem of Joseph all these bifurcation
branches come out of the same bifurcation point to the direction of R > R c

curves. To treat these problems we are forced to use the numerical computa-
tions. We restrict the function space H
2 1';3
to the finite dimensional space
a ,v.:>a
HJ by the condition l + m + n ::; N and l + m = even . The latter condition
comes from that the rotation of 271"/3 is invariant in the subspace. If we apply
the Galerkin method in HJ to the stationary solut ions of the original system,
it is reduced to the finite dimensional system of bilinear algebraic equations.

tained by Newton's method. We have taken Prandtl number P = 10 and
N = 12 in the computations. We have the following figures.

The stability of those solut ions are examined by the linearization around
those solutions and are reduced to the eigenvalue problem for the linearized
time dependent system. These eigenvalue problems are solved by numerical
computations. Now we summarize the stability and bifurcation diagram as
follows. The roll type solution is always stable und er our computations 1.0 <

becomes unstable r

Abstract. Rheology and geometry are two important factors in the Earth's man-
tle convection phenomenon . That is, the viscosity is strongly dependent on the
temperature and the phenomenon occurs in a spherical shell domain. Focusing our
attention on these two factors, we describe a total approach of numerical simula-
tion of the Earth's mantle convection, i.e., mathematical modeling, mathematical
analysis, computational scheme, error analysis, and numerical result.

Introduction
The Earth's mantle convection is considered to have a close relation to the
earthquake by the plate tectonics theory. It is, therefore, an important re-
search subject for scientists, especially, in the countries where earthquakes
often occur. Numerical simulations have been done by many authors to an-
alyze the phenomenon. See for instance [1],[11] and the references therein.
The main part of the mathematical model of this phenomenon consists of
the Rayleigh-Benard equations with infinite Prandtl number. While compu-
tations in the early stage had been done with the constant viscosity and/or
in the box domain, 'Ratcliff et al. [8] pointed out the importance of rheology
and geometry in this phenomenon. The former means that the viscosity of
the mantle is strongly dependent on the temperature, and the latter means
that the domain of the problem is a three-dimensional spherical shell. The
corresponding mathematical model becomes a nonlinear system of the Stokes
equations and the convection-diffusion equation in a spherical shell, coupled
with the viscosity, the buoyancy and the convection. In this paper we re-
view the mathematical model, prove the existence of the solution, present
an efficient and mathematically justified finite element scheme, and show a
numerical result using the scheme.
Experimental data on this phenomenon are very few compared to engi-
neering problems. There exist temporal and spatial limitations to get them. It
is, therefore, important to establish numerical methods mathematically jus-
tified. At the same time numerical schemes should be so efficient as to solve
the three-dimensional problem in a reasonable computation time. In the iso-
viscosity case we developed a stabilized finite element scheme and proved

the convergence of the finite element solutions to the exact one [10]. We have
made a computation code of the scheme and reported some three-dimensional
numerical experiments [9]. This paper presents an extension of the scheme to
the temperature dependent viscosity case.
The contents of this paper are as follows. In Section 2 we derive a mathe-
matical model of the Earth's mantle convection, starting from the Rayleigh-
Benard problem. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of the non-
linear partial differential equations are discussed in Section 3. In Section 4
we present a finite element scheme for the equations. Considering the cost
of three-dimensional problem, we use PI/PI/PI element, i.e., velocity, pres-
sure, and temperature are all approximated by the piecewise linear element,
which implies that some stabilization method is required. In the isoviscosity
case we have used the Galerkin least square (GLS) type stabilization [6,4] for
the Stokes equations. In the temperature dependent viscosity case we use the
penalty type stabilization [2), which reduces the computational cost but keeps
the same convergence order as the GLS stabilization. In Section 5 we present
a numerical result, which shows a clear effect of the temperature dependent
viscosity. We give some concluding remarks in Section 6.
Throughout the paper we denote by c and c(*) positive constants, where
the latter is dependent on the argument.

Mathematical Model
In this section we review a mathematical model for the Earth's mantle con-
vection problem. The mantle is considered to be an incompressible fluid in
the spherical domain between the core and the surface of the Earth. The core
is hot and the surface is cold. The direction of gravity is to the center of
the Earth. Accordingly we suppose that the movement of the Earth's mantle
convection is governed by the Rayleigh-Benard equations
p {~~ + (u· V)U} + Vp - V· [2j.LD(u)] = _pge(r),
V· u = 0,
08ot + u . V8 - V . (K:V8) = i,
where U = (Ul' U2, U3)T is the velocity, p is the pressure, 8 is the temperature,
p is the density, j.L is the viscosity, 9 is the gravity acceleration, e(r) is the
unit radial vector, K: is the thermal diffusivity, i is the heat source, and D(u)
is the velocity rate tensor defined by
D(u) := (Vu + VuT) /2.
The density p is, in general, a function of the temperature and the pres-
sure. We, however, introduce the Bussinesq approximation to p, i.e., the p of

Modeling and Simulation of Earth's Mantle Movement
221
the buoyancy term is replaced by
P = po{l - o:(B- Bo)}
and the P of the inertia term is replaced by Po, where 0: is the thermal expan-
sion coefficient, and Po and Bo are representative density and temperature,
respectively. The viscosity j.L of mantle is strongly dependent on the tempera-
ture. We treat j.L as a function of the temperature B and the position x. Thus
we consider the rheology of mantle. As for the importance to introduce this
complex rheology we refer to Ratcliff et al.[8]. We assume that the others, g,
K, and 0: are positive constants.
Using the scales d, d2/K, «[d, j.LoK/pod2, .tJ.(), K/d2, and j.Lo for x , t, u, p,
(), I, and u, and translating B, we obtain non-dimensional equations
~r {~~ + (u · V)U} + Vp - V· [2j.L(()D(u)] = Ra()e(r),
V · u = 0,

8t + u . VB - V 2() = I,
where d is the depth of mantle, .tJ.B is the difference of temperature, j.Lo is the
representative viscosity, and Pr and Ra are Prandtl and Rayleigh numbers
defined by
Pr := .!:!:!2-,
Ra:= pogo:.tJ.()d3
KpO

Since Pr is of order 1023 rv 1024 in the mantle convection, we omit the inertia
term. Scaling again t by 1/Ra and u, p, and I by Ra , we obtain

where Ixl is the Euclidian norm of x =

positive constants. In the case of the Earth R1 = 11/9 and R2 = 20/9. Let

Existence and Uniqueness of the Solution
In this section we discuss the existence and uniqueness of the solution of
(1)-(7). After dividing the equations into a Stokes problem and a convection-
diffusion problem, we investigate the whole problem.
If the temperature is known, (1) and (2) are Stokes equations with a
variable viscosity v and an external force g,
V=jL(.,(J),
g=(Je(r)
We consider a Stokes problem in the spherical domain il

V'. u = 0,

subject to the slip boundary conditions (4) and (5). Since (4) is an essential
boundary condition, it is natural to introduce the function space
However, as was discussed in [lOJ, the velocity is not determined uniquely in
W. There are three freedoms of rigid body movements
v(i) := e( i) x x
for i = 1,2,3,
r
where e(i) is the unit vector to the xi-direction. Eliminating the freedoms, we
seek the velocity in
V :={vEW; (V,V(i)) = 0 (i=I,2,3)),
and the pressure in
Q := {q E L 2(il); (q,1) = O},
where (.,.) means the L2(il)3_ or L2(il)-inner product.
Lemma 1. Suppose that
9 E H-1(il)3,
(g,V(i)) = 0 (i = 1,2,3),
v E LOO(il),
v ~ Vo

where Vo is a positive constant and (.,.) denotes the dual product. Then,
there exists a unique solution (u,p) E V x Q of (8), (9), (4) and (5), and the
estimate
holds.
Lemma 1 can be proved in a similar way to Lemma 2 of [10].
Next we consider the convection-diffusion equ ation (3) in temperature,
supposing that the velocity u is known. Let T be a positive constant. We
consider (3) on the time interval (0,T).
Lemma 2. Suppose that
u E £2(0, T ,£3(.0)3), \I. u E £2(0,T; £3(.0)) ,
f E £2(0, T; H-1(.o)), Or E H1(0, T ;H 1/2(r )), 0° E £2(.0)
Then, there exists a unique solution of (3), (6) and (7)
and the estimate

principle of the convection-diffusion equation.

We now consider the whole problem (1)-(7) on the time interval (0,T ).

Then, there exist a solution (u,p,O) of (1)-(7) ,

eE L2(0,r,H1(il)) n Loo(O,T jLoo(il))
Furthermore, if
the solution is unique.
Outline of the proof. For the existence of the solution we make a sequence of
approximate solutions {(ULlt, PLlt, 0Llt)}, where <1t 1 o. Let <1t be a positive
constant. The approximate solution is constructed step by step on the interval
h := (k<1t, (k + 1)<1t) for k = 0, · ·· , IT/<1tJ - 1. Let O~t, the value of OLlt
at time k<1t, be known
(O~t := 0°). Putting v = p,(-, O~t), we solve the
Stokes equations (8) and (9) subject to (4) and (5). We define (ULlt,PLlt) on
Ik by this solution. We solve the convection-diffusion equation (3) on Ik with
U = U~t and the initial value OLlt(k<1t) =
O~t to get OLlt on the interval.
Thus, we obtain a step function (ULlt,PLlt) from (0, T) to H 1(il)3 x L2(il)
and a continuous function OLlt from [O,TI to H-1(il). From Lemmas 1 and
2 the sequence {(ULlt ,PLlt,OLlt)} is uniformly bounded in
Loo(O,Tj H 1(il)3) X £00(0, T; L2(il))
X £2(0,i: H1(il)) n Loo(O,T; Loo(il)) ,
which shows that a common positive constant Vo can be chosen in solving
the Stokes problems in all h . Choosing an appropriate subsequence, we get
a limit function (u,p,O) , which is a solution of (1)-(7). Here we use the
compactness argument (see [7], [121, for example) to treat the nonlinear term
u · 'VO.
The uniqueness is proved by the standard Gronwall inequality on the
difference of supposed two temperatures, where the assumption on U is used
to treat the nonlinear term p,(0).

Finite Element Scheme
Here we present a finite element approximation to the problem (1)-(7). Con-
sidering the cost of computation in three-dimensional problems, we employ a
cheap element combination PI/PI/PI, that is, velocity, pressure, and temper-
ature are all approximated by the piecewise linear element. As is well-known,

Modeling and Simulation of Earth '5 Mantle Movement
225
the combination of PI/PI element does not work for the Stokes problem.
We, therefore, use a stabilization method. Considering again the cost of com-
putation, we employ the stabilization of penalty type [2]. Since Ra is high
in our problem, (3) is convection-dominant. To solve the equation stably, we
use the stream upwind Petrov/Galerkin method [5], [4].
Let nh be a polyhedral approximation to nand Th be a partition of nh by
tetrahedra, where h is the maximum diameter of tetrahedral elements. The
boundary of nh is denoted by rh. We consider a regular family of subdivisions
{Th}, h 1 0, satisfying the inverse assumption [3]. Let Sh (c H1(nh) n
CO(nh)) be the PI finite element space whose degrees of freedom are on the
vertices of'.tetrahedra. We introduce finite element spaces Wh, Vh , Qh, and
1[Ih corresponding to W, V, Q, and 1[1 := HJ(n), respectively,
Wh := {Vh E S~ ; (Vh ·nn}{P) = 0 (VP)} ,
Vh := {Vh E Wh ; (Vh,v(i»)h = 0 (i = 1,2,3)} ,
Qh := {Qh E s; ; (Qh, l)h = O},
1[Ih := {1/'h E s; ; 1/'h(P) = 0 (VP) } ,
where P stands for nodal point on rh, nn is the unit outer normal to r.
Since we use the PI element, every nodal point P on rh is on r . We employ
Hl(nh)3-norm for Wh and Vh, L2(n h)-norm for Qh, and Hl(nh)-norm for
1[Ih, respectively. We define an affine space 1[Ih(8r) by
1[Ih(8r) := {1/'h E Sh ; 1/'h(P) = 8r(P) (VP)},
where P stands again for the nodal point on rh and 8r = 8r(x) is supposed
to be continuous.
We prepare the following bilinear and trilinear forms for u, v E H 1(n)3,
q E L 2(n), and 8, 1/' E H1(n),
a(j.L,u,v) := 2 Lj.LD(U): D(v)dx,
b(v,q) := - L
'V . vqdx,
co(8,1/') := ~a L
'V8 · 'V1/'dx,
cl(u,8, 1/') := ~ {L (u · 'V)81/'dx - L
(u · 'V)1/'8dX}
Remark 4.
(i)
In the finite element method every integral over n is replaced by that
over nh. We express such integrals by adding the subscript h. For example,
ah(',',') is the trilinear form corresponding to a(', ', '), whose integration is
done over nh, and (', ')h is the inner product in L2(n h)'

Let ilt be a time increment and set the total time step number NT :=
[T/ilt] . We denote by vh the value of Vh at t = nilt for an integer n E

ence DL1ton := ur+1- on)/ilt. A stabilized finite element approximation to

Stokes equations and TK is also a stability parameter for the convection-

where ti« is the diameter of element K , UK = IUh(GK)1 and GK is the
barycenter of K .
Remark 5. The stabilization method of GLS type [6J includes the term "V .
[/-l(Oh)"VUh]' It does not vanish element-wise for the PI element unless /-l is
constant, which increases considerably the computation cost in the three-
dimensional problem. That is the reason why we use the penal ty type sta-
bilization. The convergence rates are same for these two methods as we use
the PI element.
We can show that (12) and (13) is uniquely solvable in (uh,Ph) and that (14)
is uniquely solvable in O~+l. When 0h is given, (uh,Ph) is obtained from (12)
and (13). Substituting the uh to (14), O~+1 is solved . Hence, starting from
the initial value O~ , we can obtain the finite element solution (Uh ,ph,Oh).

Suppose that f , Or, and 00 satisfy the conditions in Theorem 3. Then, we
know a priori bound of 0 from (10) . Modifying J.L outside the bound, we can
take a positive constant J.Lo such that
J.L(x,O ~ J.Lo
for (x,€)
E n x 1R. .
Under such a modification we can show that the scheme (12)-(14) is uncon-
ditionally stable and that the finite element solutions converge to the exact
one.
Theorem 6. Let (u, p,O) be a solution of (1)-(7) such that
u EC([O, T]; H2(il)3) n Hl(O, T; H l(il)3),
P EC([O, T] ;Hl(il)),
oEHl(O, T; H 2(il))n H 2(0,T; L2(il)).

This theorem extends the result obtained in the isoviscosity case [10] to the
temperature dependent viscosity case . The complete proof will be given in a
forthcoming paper.

Numerical Result
We present a numerical result of (1)-(7). Since the temperature is normalized,
Or is simply given by
Or = 1 on F l ,
Or = °on F2 •

We use a linearized Arrhenius law for the viscosity [8],
J.L(()) = expl-(() - 1/2) log e],
where b is a positive number describing the contrast of viscosity, that is, J.L
is independent of x, normalized at () = 1/2, and the ratio of the maximum
and minimum viscosity is equal to b. Heat source is f = 0 and the initial
temperature ()o is

m is the normalized spherical harmonic function of degree n and order m,
and € = 0.1. This initial condition was used in 18]. We set Ra = 7,000.
We performed a numerical simulation for this problem by the stabilized
finite element scheme (12)-(14). Figure 1 shows the mesh and Table 1 shows
the data for the computation. We set b = 1,000. Starting from the initial
temperature (15), we got a numerically stationary solution (Uh,ph,8h) . In
the left column of Fig.2 we show the isothermal surfaces of ()h=0.2, 0.5, 0.8,
and in the right column we show the corresponding results of the isoviscosity
case J.L == 1. In the variable viscosity case the viscosity increases and the ve-
locity decreases at the place where the temperature is low. The plume heads,
therefore, flatten much more than in the isoviscosity case. Such phenomenon
can be observed clearly in Fig. 2. More detailed observation including results
of other viscosity contrasts and Rayleigh numbers will be reported in the
forthcoming paper.

Concluding Remarks
We have solved a mathematical model with temperature dependent viscosity
for the Earth's mantle convection in the whole three-dimensional domain.
Although we use the cheap element PI/PI/PI, the computational cost of
the full three-dimensional problem is pretty large. In order to reduce the cost
we have exploited symmetries of the domain and made a parallel computation
code, where no symmetries of the solution are supposed. We will discuss on
this subject in a forthcoming paper. For the computation of much higher
Rayleigh numbers such effort of reducing the computation cost is necessary.

Abstract. In this paper , we propose a mathematical formulation of 3-dimensional
qu asi-static brittle fracture under varying loads. We give a precise formulation of
internal cracking and surface cracking in 3D elastic bodies. In Sections 2 and 3, we
provide geometrical results and results on Sobolev spaces . Most criteria in fracture
mechanics are based on Griffith's energy balance theory, which is explained briefly in
Section 5. GJ-integral is proposed by the author (1981), which is a generalization of
J -integral widely used in 2D fracture problems. GJ-integral expresses the variation
of energies with respect to crack extensions and relates to Griffith's energy balance
theory. Under varying loads, we cannot use Griffith's energy balance theory directly,
however GJ-integral is applicable to such cases too. For practical use, we must study
the combination with numerical calculation. In the last section, we give an error
estimate for finite elem ent approximation of GJ-integral.

Introduction
In this paper, we adopt Einstein 's convention, that is, XiYi means the sum l:i XiYi .
By Hm(Q) we denote Sobolev space of order m defined on (a domain or a surface )
Q. For a function i , we denote by f lQ the restriction of f on Q. For a function
space 7{, we denote by 'H"' th e product space H x .. . x H and by H' the dual space
of H .
Consider an elastic body whose undeformed shape is fh: = n \ E . Here n is
a bounded domain in 1R.3 with a Lipschitz boundary rand E is the undeformed
shape of a crack, which is Goo-smooth surface with Goo-smooth boundary BE . We
assume that E lies on a Goo-smooth oriented open manifold S (see Fig. 1). The
surface E is called a crack surface.
We consider the case where the crack extension is considered to occur in a quasi-
static manner. Therefore, when we refer to time t we use it as a parameter that
delineates the history of the sequence of events such as loading or crack extension,
which are observed in the interval [0,T] of time t. In the crack extension process,
the part rD of T is fixed (Dirichlet condition) and the surface force g(t) is given
on the remainder part rN = T \ rD. The body force f (t ) also is given inside n as
shown in Fig. 2.
In this paper, we consider only sm ooth virtual crack extensio ns E(t) C n, but
of two types. One is internal cracking satisfying E(t) n r = 0 for all 0 S; t S; T as
shown in Fig. 2. We write the set of all smooth virtual internal crack extensions
by SCin(EIS) . Another is surface cracking satisfying E(t) n T = L(t) for all 0 S;
t S; T as shown in Fig. 3, where L( t) denotes the smooth curve on r. We denote
by SC.,,(EIS) the set of all smooth virtual surface crack extensions. In sur face
crack extension, we assume that r is Goo-class, so we can divide BE(t) to two

smooth curves 8 1E (t) and 82E(t) = L(t) as shown in Fig. 3. The surface E(t) is
called Goo-manifold with corner. By considering the smooth extension of mapping
in the atlas of E(t) for each t, we can extend E(t) to a Goo-manifold A(t) with
the smooth boundary 8A(t). Then we assume the form E(t) = A(t) n D in what
follows. Moreover, under some engineering environment (e.g. pressure vessel), we
must consider the surface force pet) on E(t). If there is no need to distinguish
SCin(EIS) and SC.,,(EIS), then we write them SC(EIS).
The plan of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, we explain SC(EIS) precisely.
In Section 3, the density and trace theorem in Sobolev spaces defined on DE (or
DE(t ) are given . In Section 4, we construct a weak solution of quasi-static fracture
in virtual crack extension. The main of this paper is Section 5 as below.
The real crack extension is selected from virtual crack extensions by a criterion.
Least-energy principle is widely used , and applied to fracture mechanics in the fa-
mous studies by Griffith [5,6]. The developments of his studies are called Griffith's
energy balance theory today, in which the crack extension force is called energy re-
lease rate (= variation of energies with respect to crack extensions). J-integral is
widely used in fracture mechanics in 2D cases . In [26] and [2] , it is shown indepen-
dently that J -integral equals energy release rate (for a mathematical proof, refer

to [13]). In Section 5, a generalization of J-integral is given in 3D cases, named
GJ-integral by the author [14] which is the functional
(u,w,X) ...... Jw(u,X)
with parameters; the displacement vector u = u(O), the domain wand the vector
field X . The important property of GJ-integral is the following: If there is no
singularity inside w, that is ulwnnL' E H2(w n nE)3 , then Jw(u, X) = 0 for all
vector field X. However, Jw(u ,X) f= 0, if u has some kind of singularities inside w,
where X is derived from the movement of singularities. The theory on GJ-integral
has been constructed in the papers [16,22] and is applied to various sensitivity
analysis. The equivalence between energy release rote and GJ-integral has been
proved in [14] for 3D internal crack extension and in [18] for 3D surface crack
extension. The results of theoretical research in crack problems suggest that a weak
solution (displacement vector) u has the following singularies (see e.g. [3])
Ui = kjP:;;<Pi,j + UR,i

P8E(X) = min Ix- YI,

for i = 1,2,3, where Ui are components of u and UR,i E H 2 (near 817) are regular

817, and kj are functions defined on 817. Without using (1), we will prove that
GJ-integral expresses a crack extension force and if (1) is true,

Geometry on Crack Extension
2.1
Internal crack extension
We define the class of smooth virtual crack extensions as follows (see Fig.4).
(SCinl) E = E(O) C E(t) c E(t') c S if 0 ~ t < t' ~ T .
(SCin2) The crack extends along the closed Coo-manifold S so that E(t) may be
Coo-submanifolds of S with boundary oE(t).
(SCin3) For each t E [0,Tj , there is a Coo-diffeomorphism ¢>t : oE -> oE(t), and
the map ¢>. : oE x [0,T] -> S is of class Coo.
Let us denote by SCin(EIS) the set of all virtual crack extensions {E(t)} satisfying
rsc., 1)-(SCin3) .
Now we introduce the local coordinate system near the edge oE of the initial
crack E as shown in Fig. 4. Let {e1(r), e2(r), e3(r)} be the vectors at "( E 0E
such that e3(r) is unit normal to E C S directed from minus side to plus side.
We denote also e3(r) by v(r) . The vector el(r) is the outward unit normal to oE
along Sand e2(r) unit tangent to oE.
There is a numb ere > 0 such that, for all point x E U.(aE) = {x E IR.3 : PoE (x) < E} ,
we get only one point y E oE satisfying Ix - yl = poE(x). For any point P E
S n U.(oE), we get uniquely the point 'YP E oE and geodesic line connecting P
and rt»: The geodesic lines are defined as the locally shortest curves connecting
two points on S (see Fig. 5). For each point Q E U.(oE), we get the point PQ E S
uniquely which lies on the normal straight line through the point Q, and we get also
the geodesic line connecting PQ and "(Q E oE. So we can introduce the curvilinear
coordinate system (F, U.(oE)) called tubular neighborhood.
Fig. 5. For P E SnU.(oE), "( p E oE is uniquely determined, also for Q E U.(oE) ,
we get uniquely "(Q E oE as shown above.

Lemma 1. There is a constant E >°and an open neighborhood U.(8E) of 8E in
lR3 such that the map
is a Coo-diffeomorphism of 8E x D. onto U.(8E), where D. denotes the disc with
the radius E. Here the path 6
t-+ F(-y ,6, 0), 161 < E is the geodesic line along S
starting from, E 8E and F(-y,6,6) = 6v(F(-y,6 ,0»
(see Fig. 5). Moreover, we
have
F(-y,O,O) =,

En U.(8E) = {F(-y, 6, 0); , E 8E, -E < 6 < O} .
(7)
In smooth crack extension, the movement of crack is given by the disjoint path
t t-+ <Pt(-y) connecting, and the point on 8E(t) for each°::; t ::; T and, E 8E,
which make the vector field d<Pt/dtlt=o on 8E. In the paper [14), it is proved that
the crack extension depend only on the er- component D<po(-y)e1(-y) of d<Pt/dtlt=o,
that is, D<Po(,) = (D<Pt(-y)/dtlt=o) . e1(-Y) by the inner product,
In (3), we called D<Po(,) the speed of the virtual crack extension at the initial
crack (or t = 0). Also we callD<Po(-y)e1(-y) the velocity vector of crack extension.
2.2
Surface crack extension
As stated in Introduction, we assume the undeformed shape of surface cracks has
the form E(t) = A(t) n n.
(SCsul) A = A(O) C A(t) c A(t') C S if 0::; t < t' ::; T.
(SCsu2) The crack extends along the Coo-manifold S so that A(t) may be Coo_
submanifolds of S with boundary 8E(t).
(SCsu3) For each t E [0,T], there is a Coo-diffeomorphism <Pt : 8A --+ 8A(t), and
the map <p. : 8A x [0,T]
--+ S is of class Coo.
(SCsu4) The closure A(t) is a 2-dimensional Coo-submanifold of S with Coo_
boundary 8A(t) intersecting transversally with r at two points A1(t) and A2(t) .
Let us denote by SCsu(EIS) the set of all virtual crack extensions {E(t)} satisfying
(SCsul)-(SCsu4). We can construct the tubular neighborhood of 8A as given in
Lemma 1. But we must notice that the geodesic line starting A;(O), i = 1,2 along
S goes away from r, in general. So we use the spray (see e.g. [10, IV, 5]) which
fits into the shape of rand 8A. The usual argument on the existence of tubular
neighborhood leads to the following Lemma (see, e.g. [10, IV, 5]).
Lemma 2.
There is a constant E >°and an open neighborhood U.(8A) of 8A in

AnU.(8A) = {F(-Y,6,O);, E 8A, -€ < 6 < O} ,
8lE n U.(8A) = {F(-y ,6,O); , E 8E, -€ < 6 < O},
DEnU.(8A) = U~=l {F(Ai(O),6,6) ; (~l,6) E D;} .

Density and Trace Theorem
To formulate the boundary condition, we must define the value v~(t) on the plus
side or the minus side of the surface E(t). To construct the density and trace
theorems in 3D case, we will approximate DE by domains with local Lipschitz
property. However Euclidean distance in IR3 is not fit for this approximation. Now
we introduce the new distance lnI: ; For a domain Q C IR3 , we denote the distance
lQ(x, y) of two points x, y E Q by the infimum of lengths of all piecewise linear
lines connecting x and y inside Q. If Q has local Lipschitz property, then lQ(x, y)
is equivalent to the Euclidean distance Ix - yl.
We prepare some lemmas to show the density theorem.
Lemma 3.
(see (lB, Lemma 2.1}) Let Q and 0 be bounded domain in IR3 and if>
a mapping from Q into O . Assume that Q is covered by a family {Qili=l,... ,m of
domains with local Lipschitz property in IR3 satisfying the following:
There is a constant C such that
Iif>(x) - if>(y)I ~ Glx - yl for any x, y E Qi, i = 1, · · · , m.
(9)
The image
Qi = if>(Qi) is a domain with local Lipschitz property
(10)
for each i. Then there is a constant Go such that
lo(if>(x), if>(y» ~ GolQ(x, y)
for all x ,y E Q.
(11)
We now construct the mapping if>0l which maps the neighborhood of 8E onto
domains with local Lipschitz property (see Fig . 6)
fJ.(E) = {F(-y,6,6);, E 8E, I~il < ,j;fi,i = 1,2} C U.(8E) ,
':(0) = {F(-Y,6,6); A E 8E, 0 < 6 < ..;;]2,°< 6 < 06} ,
for °~ 0 < ..,ff]8. For 0 > 0, ':(0) become the domain with local Lipschitz
property. We consider the family of mappings {if>0l}0:50l<v';;2 defined by
if>Ol(X) = { F(-y(x), 6 (x), [6(x) + sign(6(x» 06 (x)Jj2) x E ~(o) \ E

Fracture Problems in 3D elasticity
Under the virtual crack extension {E(t)}O$t$T , let us consider the brittle fracture
phenomenon which means the fracture process is described by a sequence of lin-
ear elastic solids defined on !lE(t). Let u(t) be the displacement vector and the
constitution law is expressed by Hooke's tensor Cijkl(X), i ,j,k,l = 1,2,3 with the
following properties
Cijkl = Cjikl,
Cijkl = Cklij ,
with Q > 0,
for all ~ij E JRj i ,i,k,l= 1,2,3.
By Hooke's tensor, the stress tensors Uij(U(t» are expressed by the stain tensors
Cij(U(t» = (8iuj(t) + 8jUi(t»
as Uij(U(t» = Cijklckl(U(t» .
In the case of surface crack extension, we assume that Fo C rE(t) for all
o S t S T . For each t , the displacement vector u(t) is given by the solution
of the boundary value problems PC(t),E(t): For a given .c(t) = (f(t) ,g(t),p) E
L 2(JR3)3 x L2(rN)3 x L2(S?, find u(t) such that

The crack extension force in brittle fracture
In the case of surface crack extension, that complicates matters, so we only write
on internal crack extension in what follows. However by [18], we can get similar
results stated below for surface crack extension.
5.1
Griffith's energy balance theory
Under the constant loading C(t) = C = (I,g,O) and a virtual crack extension
{E(t)} , the difference of energies is written by
£ (u(O); C,!tE) - £ (u(t);C,!tE(t» = ~1
E(x , u - u (t» dx ~ 0,
n E ( , )
so the difference of energies become the crack extension f orce. On the other hand,
there is a resisting force, such as bonding strength, intermolecular force, etc. Grif-
fith[5,6] used the surface force of glass as the resisting force. In the fracture me-
chanics, the simplest assumption is to consider the constant resisting force Oc per
unit surface.
If there is a real crack extension {E R (t)} , then the following inequality will
satisfy,
(20)
where IE R(t ) \ E I is the area of crack extension ER(t) \ E. Dividing the both side
of (20) by IE R(t) \ E I and taking the limit, we have the inequality
(21)

Here for an arbitrary virtual crack extension {E(t)},
is called energy release rate. Moreover, the real crack extension {ER(t)} will take
the maximum value of energy release rate over all virtual crack extensions, that is,
Ifwe find a virtual crack extension {E·(t)} E SC(EIS) such that g(.c; !h··(.)) 2 (Xc,
then from the inequality
the crack will extend. We now find the criterion of crack extensions as follows:
Find the supremum over internal smooth crack extensions,
g.(.L:; SCin(EIS)) =
sup
g(.c;nE (.) ) .
{E(t)}ESCin(EIS)
Because g.(.c;SC(EIS)) 2
(X c implies that g(.c; nERO) 2 (Xc.

Generalized J-integral for internal crack extension
(22)
Let w be a bounded domain in 1R.3 . We call the domain w "regular relative to nE"
if the identity

(23)
holds for all v, wE H1(nE) and each i = 1,2,3. Here we notice the direction of u
on S .
For each solution u of P .c(O),E(O) , we define the GJ-integral by
Jw(u, X) = Pw(u, X) + Rw(u, X)
as a functional depending on the domain wand a vector field X E coo (IR.3?,where
Pw(u,X) = r
{E(x,u)(X .n)-O"ij(u)nj(X ·V'ui)}ds,

Rw(u,X) =1{O"ij(U)OjXkOkUi - XV'xE(x,u) - f(X· V'u) - E(x, u)divX} dx.

Here n = (nl, n2, n3) is the outward unit normal n on o(w n n) and ds the surface
element of o(w n n). The integral Rw(u,X) is well-defined for all solutions u of
P.c(O),E(O)' however Pw(u,X) needs the regularity of u . We notice that Pw(u,X)
contains no integral over w n E.

Theorem 10 (refer to [13,14,19]). For a {E(t)} E SCin(EIS),
Q(.L:, n E(.» = Jw(u; X) (iE 8<Po(T)d-Y) -1,
(25)
where w stands for an arbitrary small domain containing the crack front 8E, X the
vector field obtained from parallel extension of 8<pO(T)elb), -y E 8E over U(8E)
and d-y the line element of 8E (see Fig. 4). Moreover, we have
(26)
where JI'(u,eI) is the distribution on 8E (see e.q. [7] for the distribution on the
manifold).
Proof. The mathematical proof of (25) is given in [14]. Here we notice that Jw(u, X)
are independent of w. For hI, ha E C
OO (8E ) and 0:, {3 E JR., we can construct
the vector fields X",hl+l3h2 by the parallel displacement of (o:h1 + {3hZ)el along
geodesic line on S and the normal surfaces in the tubular neighborhood (F, U.(8E»
(called Levi-Civita connection of 8<po(T)el(T) in (F,U.(8E», see e.g, [9]). Then
X",hl+l3h2 = o:Xhl + {3Xh2 (same to the relation v'",x+I3y = o:V'x + (3V'y for
covariant derivative in Riemannian manifold), so we have
Let 1J8E E cO'(n) be the cut-off function near 8E, that is, 1J8E = 1 near 8E and
1J8E = 0 outside some neighborhood of 8E. By the independence of w, we can
derive
for all h E C OO (8E ). Using Schwarz inequality, we obtain the estimation
with some constant C > 0 independent of h, u, f . Therefore, h ...... Jw(U,Xh)
is the linear continuous functional defined on C 1(8E ). Since C
OO (8E ) C C 1(8E )
topologically, we then complete the proof of Theorem.
Theorem 11. If the solution u of PC(O),E(O) is in HZ(near 8E?, then

for all vector field X obtained from smooth crack extension. Moreover, we assume
that u is decomposed to Us +un as follows; There is a constant M > 0 such that
Iv'P8E(X)V'US(x)! < M for all x E U.(8E»
and un E H Z{U.(8E) n nE)3 . Then
Jw(u,X) = lim Pw(us,X) .

Remark 12. The assumption U = Us + UR will be true by [3], however obtained
results in [3] are regularity and asymptotic representations on pseudodifferential
equations defined on E. Then there is a small gap between their retults and the
assumption.
Proof. The identity (27) is proved in [14].
Using the independence of wand limlwl_o Rw (u, X) = 0, we only check that
lim5_0 PU6(iJE)(U,X) = lim5_0 PU6(lJE) (us , X),
PU6(8I:)(U,X) = PU6(8E) (us, X) + PU6(8E)(UR,X) + PU6(8E)(US;UR, X) ,

we have the estimation
(29)
with a constant C > 0 independent of UR and 0. By Schwartz inequality, we obtain
(30)
By the partition of unity and the change of variables, lI'\7uRII~,8u6(8E) become the
finite sum of the following integrals
for some L > 0,
j = 1,2,3,
where 8jU stands for some element of 8jUi,R after using partition of unity and the
change of variables. We can assume that 8j U(£,r, (}) == 0 for r > Ro with some
Ro > O. By the expression

with C2 > 0 depending only on the change of variables. We arrive the estimation
(31)
with a constant C3 > 0 independent of UR and 8. Combining (29) - (31), we obtain
the following
which leads (28).

From the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem, we can extend the domain of operator
to rca(8E) , where rca(8E) stands for the space of all regular countable additive
scalar valued set functions on the a-field of all Borel sets in 8E (see e.g. [4]). Let
us denote the duality between C(8E) and rca(8E) by (', ·)aE.
Thus the fracture criterion is reformulated as follows;
Find hmax E rca(8E) such that
(hmax,JI'(U,el))aE 2 (h,JI'(u,el))aE
for all h E Sin(8E),
~n(8E) = {h E rca(8E) Ih20, Ihl = I} .
Since rca(8E) is the dual space of CO(8E), we have
The compactness of 8E imply the existence of the maximum value of JI'(u, eI) at
"(max E 8E. Let us denote by 8l'max, Dirac's distribution at "(max, i.e., 81'max satisfy
the equality
for all 'l/J E CO(8E),
and furthermore 81'max 2 0 and 181'maxI= 1. Then 81'max E Sin (8E) . From this,

In [1], they adopt Irwin criterion (see e.g. [8]) when S = {(Xl, X2, X3) :
X3 = a},
that is, if the virtual crack extension is not real, then KI(t;,) ::; K lc, and real
crack extension implies that KI(tj,) = Klc. Here KI(tj,) are stress intensity fac-
tors (opening mode) near E(t) with time-like parameter t, and K 1c the critical
value determined by experiment. Using asymptotic expansion of K I (t;,), they also
rewrite Irwin's criterion the variational inequality and solve it . The uniqueness,
smoothness and numerical realization (example) are given. The asymptotic expan-
sion technique (refer to [1]) is very powerful, however it's very difficult even if we
study them under simple situation.
5.3
Internal crack extension under varying load
Griffith's energy balance theory is not applicable under varying load. However, we
get same result on fracture criterion from the following results.
Theorem 13 ([23]). Under the constant loading, we have

Under the varying load .c(t), the energy release rate is not the crack extension

Numerical analysis of 3D fracture
The calculation of GJ-integral is very important in fracture problem. Here we only
state the theoretical results for finite element method, because we need huge power
of machines and labour in 3D calculations. The method stated below is essentially
same in 2D cases (see [21]).
Let [} be a bounded polyhedral convex domain and let us assume that S is a
flat surface. We make a tetrahedral finite element Th = {T1 , .. . TM } of [}E ,
[} E = UTEThT = T l UT2 U'" UTM ,
h = max{size oi T; : i = 1,' " ,m }.
We put
where PI (T) is the space of the polynomials less than one defined in T . Here we
notice that the discontinuity of v E Vh([}E) is permitted on E . So the nodes on
plus side and minus side of E must be different.
Find Uh E Vh([}E) such that

Under the assumption stated in Theorem 11, we can prove the following by similar
argument in [27, Theorem 12.1].
for 0 < Q < 1/2.
(39)
Perhaps, JU.(8E)(U h, X ) gives the approximation of JU.(8E )(U , X ). However, to
get the error estimate of PU, (8E)(U h , X k) , we need the error estimation Ilu-
u hIlQ,u'_ 6,' +6(8E ) for a number q > 3/2 where
in 0 < €1 < e < €2. Moreover, the constant in error estimation depends on €l , €2 .
We now prove the important property of GJ-integral in FEM.
Proposition 15. Let n be arbitrary function Wl ,OO(IR?) such that TJ == 1 on U./ 2(oE )
and n == 0 outside U3' /4(oE ).
(40)
Remark 16. The space Wl ,oo(lR3) is the set of functions whose weak derivatives ar e
essentially bounded on JR.3. Vh-interpolation ofthe cut-off function ii E Co (U.(oE) )
belongs to W l,oo(JR.3).
Proof.
Let Z = (Zl, Z3, Z3) = X

JU, (8E)(U , .,.,X) = JU' / 2,, (8E)(U , Z) . Since u IU' /2,, (8E ) E H 2(U' /2,. (o E ))3 , we

Exploiting Partial or Complete Geometrical
Symmetry in Boundary Integral Equation
Formulations of Elastodynamic Problems

Abstract. Procedures based on group representation theory, allowingthe exploita-
tion of geometrical symmetry in symmetric Galerkin BEM formulations of 3D elas-
todynamic problems, are developed. They are applicable for both commutative
and noncommutative finite symmetry groups and to partial geometrical symmetry,
where the boundary has two disconnected components, one of which is symmetric.

Introduction
When a linear boundary-value problem (BVP) exhibits geometrical symme-
try, taking full advantage of it yields substantial computational benefits. In
Bossavit [4]' the linear representation theory for finite groups [8,9] is shown
to lead to the correct definition of (i) decomposition of function spaces into
orthogonal subspaces of symmetric, skew-symmetric,... functions, and (ii)
reconstruction of the global solution from these components; the (domain-
based, FEM-oriented) weak formulation is thus recast into a block-diagonal
form, each 'subproblem' being defined on a 'symmetry cell' (a subdomain of
smallest measure that, under the action of the symmetry group, generates the
entire initial domain) and associated to the corresponding projection of the
boundary data. The procedure, being essentially an elaborate superposition
technique, assumes linear constitutive properties. Similar principles are used
by Allgower et al. [I] to block-diagonalize the discretized equations.
The adapt ation of the former approach to boundary element methods
(BEMs) is not straightforward, mostly because the symmetry cell usually
involve the definition of new boundaries, a feature which is unimportant in
FEMs but clearly undesirable in BEMs, where subproblems should be stated
only on symmetry cells of the boundary. In an earlier work [2], this issue
was adressed for collocation BEMs and commutative symmetry groups (see
also [6]). Using standard methods to set up and solve the matrix equations,
the theoretical computational gains (in relative terms, compared to using the
same discretization without symmetry) were found to be lin, lin and I/n 2
for the matrix storage requirement, matrix set-up time and solution time,
respectively, where n is the number of elements in the symmetry group (e.g.
n = 8 for the group of symmetries with respect to three orthogonal planes).

This contribution aims at extending the concepts and results of [2) in
three directions. Firstly, the exploitat ion of geometrical symmetry is consid-
ered here in the framework of symmetric Galerkin BEM formulations. Sec-
ondly, procedures are developed for both commutative or noncommutative
symmetry groups. Thirdly, the approach is generalized to partial geometrical
symmetry, where the boundary has two (or more) disconnected components,
one (or more) of which being invariant under a symmetry group. For instance,
in defect identification problems, bodies with external geometrical symme-
try but cont aining internal cracks, voids, inclusions... of arbitrary shape and
location might be encountered. The formulations developed herein are ex-
pected to bring significant gains in computational efficiency by exploiting
symmetries of the external boundary.

Governing equations
In this paper, the use of geometrical symmetry is fully developed for the Neu-
mann BVP of linear elastodynamics in the frequency-domain, using double-
layer integral representations. These BVPs are chosen as representative model
problems , and the developments to follow are expected to be easily adaptable
to ot her scalar or vector linear BVPs (e.g. from electromagnetics).
The displacement vector u , strain tensor e and stress tensor a in a three-
dimensional isotropic elastic medium are governed by the dynamic equilib-
rium, constitutive and compatibility field equations:
div a + pw2u + f = 0
u = JL[ 1:~vTr(c)1+ 2c]
(1)
e = (V u + V Tu)/2
(with JL: shear modulus, u: Poisson ratio, p: mass per unit volume, f : body
force distribution), which , upon elimination of e and a , yield the well-known
Navier equation, an elliptic second-order vector PDE for the primary field u.
In particular, a time-harmonic unit point force (i.e. f = 8(x - x)ek)
applied in an infinite elastic body at the fixed point x and along the k-
direction defines at x E ]R3 \ {x} the well-known elastodynamic fundamental
solution. The fundamental displacement UNx, x) , stress tensor Et(x ,x) and
traction vector Ti

where S is a bounded surface, either closed or open (or possibly a set of several
such surfaces) and the density 4J depends on the boundary conditions; the
case of an open surface is usually associated with scattering of elastodynamic
waves by cracks. Representations of the form (7) are often used to formulate
boundary integral equations (BIEs) for interior or exterior problems on the
domain [l bounded by S with Neumann boundary data p over S . In partic-
ular, such problems lead to symmetric Galerkin BlE (SGBlE) formulations

integrations by parts over S, the actual SGBIE formulation, which is the
basis for the present development, is:
A(4J, ¢*) = I:.(¢*)
(9)
where the linear form I:. and the symmetric bilinear form A are given by:
I:.(¢*) = ~ r p(x).¢(x) dSi;

function f [7] (eabc: permutation tensor):
(12)
Besides, if the surface 8 is defined by a mapping Ll C ]R2 ~ 8 , e ~ x(e),
one has

which shows in particular that R; is a tangential differential operator. Both
Bik qs and Ai k are weakly singular in view of (5) and (6) and have symmetry
properties which ensure the overall symmetry of A(cjJ, ;p*) through:
B(x,x;cjJ,;P*) = B(x,x;cjJ,;P*) = B(x,x;;P* ,cjJ)
(14)

Geometrical symmetry assumptions
The most important assumption for the present purposes is that the boundary
8 has either full or partial geometrical symmetry. By this, we mean that there
exists a finite group S = {Sl' .. ' ,sn} of n isometries of]R3 (n is the order
of S) and a partition of the boundary 8 into two disconnected components
8 1,82 such that 8 1 is invariant under S whereas 8 2 is not:
(Vs E S)
One can therefore introduce a symmetry cell for 8 1, i.e. a subset C of 8 1
such that
Area(C) = Area(81)jn
and
8 1 = Us(C)
sES
For example, 8 1 is the (symmetric) external boundary while 8 2 is a (col-
lection of) interior hole(s) or crack(s) of arbitrary shape and location. Full
symmetry refers to the case where 8 1 = 8 and 8 2 = 0, i.e. the whole bound-
ary 8 (and hence also D) is invariant under S. Recall that an isometry of]R3
is a linear application s: ]R3 ~ ]R3 such that Isxl = Ixl (Vx E ]R3), where
Ixl == (X.X)1/2 is the usual Euclidean norm in ]R3.
Exploiting (partial) symmetry in the SGBEM formulation (9) essentially
consists in transforming integrals over 8 1 into integrals over C, so that the
matrix operators produced by the discretization process are of smaller size
than those corresponding to the original integral equations. Note that no
symmetry is assumed regarding the Neumann data p.
In addition to geometrical symmetry, one must assume that the material
properties are also invariant under the symmetry group S . Accordingly, the
bilinear form A is said to have the equivariance property if:
(15)

(where Us(x) == su(s-1 x)) which is a straightforward adaptation of the defi-
nition proposed in [4]. Since 8 1 is invariant under 5 , the changes of variables
(x,x) -+ (sx,sx) imply:
B(x, X j Us,vs) = B(sx, SXj SU, sv)
and (15) thus implies:
B(sx,SXjSU,sv) = B(x,xju,v)
In fact , it is easy to check that:
Bikq.(SX, sx ) = SijSklSqrsstBjlrt(X, x)
(16)
from (262) and the identities:
r(sx,sx) = sr(x,x)
r(sx, sx) = r(x, x)
where r(x, x) == x - x and r(x,x) = lx,xlj then (16) follows easily.
An immediate and useful consequence of property (16) is:
B(sx,SXjSU,sv) = B(tx, x ;tu,v)

Using geometrical symmetry: the Abelian case
The present approach is based on the exploitation of some basic results
from the the theory of linear representations of finite groups. In this respect,
Abelian (or commutative, i.e, "Is,t E 5, st = ts) and non-Abelian symmetry
groups lead to quite different formulations. In this section, 5 is a commuta-
tive finite group of order n; this includes the common cases of group Pm of
symmetries w.r.t, m orthogonal planes (with n = 2m and 1 S m S d) and the
group e n = {Id, r,r2 , ••• , rn- I } of cyclic symmetry generated by a rotation
r of angle 27f/ n, with 2 S n). The non-Abelian case is deferred to section 5.
Review of basic definitions [4,8,9]. Any finite Abelian group 5 of order n
possess n irreducible linear representations, i.e. n applications PI': 5 -+ <C
which satisfy the following relations:
Ipl/(s)! = 1
(18)
for any s,t E 5 , 1 S u S n (z* denotes the complex conjugate of z), as well
as the 'orthogonality relation':
(19)

The Pv are known for all usual groups; they are shown in table 1 for the
groups Pl, P2 , P3 while for the group C«, one has
pv(r) = exp(2i1l"vj n)
(v = 0, . . . ,n - 1)
(20)
The Pv: S ~ C can be view as a group isomorphism between S and GL(C),
the multiplicative group of linear endomorphisms of C , and are said to be of
degree one. In contrast, when S is not commutative, some of the irreducible
linear representations are necessarily of degree ~ 2.
Any vector function v defined on Sl then admits the decomposition [4]:
n
V = 2::Pvv
v=l
where the linear operators P v defined by:
1
v ~ [Pvv](x) = ;; 2::Pv(t)t-1v(tx)
tES
(21)
(22)
are readily shown using (19) to be orthogonal projectors for the L2 scalar
product: if V is a space of functions defined on s' , then one has
r (PJLv ).(Pv v )*dS = 0
l s 1
and
Let V v denote the restriction on C of P,», Then , from the properties

Moreover, let Is = {x E 0, sx E O}, i.e. Is is the set of points of 0 whose
images under a given s are in 0 (in fact, such points necessarily belong to
BO for 0 to be actually a symmetry cell). Identity (23) then implies that the
Vv obtained from a given v E V must satisfy the constraints:
vv(sx) - Pv(s-l)svv(x) = 0
(Vs E S, Vx E Is)
(24)
Let Vv denote the set of functions defined on 0 for which (24) holds.
Finally, for any x E 0 and any s E S, the value v(sx) of vat the image
sx of x can be expressed in terms of the Vv:
n
v(sx) = L Pv(S-I)svv(X)
v=1
(25)
Exploiting partial symmetry. Under the assumption of partial geometrical
symmetry, one can map each s(0) onto 0 by x E 0
--+ Z = sx E s(0) and
express integrals over 8 1 as sums of integrals over 0, with the help of the
identities
d8(sx) = d8(x)
n(sx) = s[n(x)]
(26)
which stem from the fact that s is an isometry. In particular, the bilinear
form A(4), iiJ*) and linear form £(iiJ*) defined by (11) and (10) take the form:
A(4>, iiJ*) = B(4>1, iiJh) +C(4>1, iiJ2*) +cT(4)2, iiJh) +V(4>2, iiJ2*)
(27)
£(iiJ*) = F(iiJh) + 0(iiJ2*)
(28)
where 4>1, iiJ1* E V = [Hl/2(81)]3 and 4>2, iiJ2* E W = [Hl/2(82)]3, and with
B(4)I,iiJh) = L L r rB(sx, sa:; 4>1 0 S,iiJh 0 s)as, d8;;

Now, inserting the decomposition (25) for both 4>1 and iiJl in B(4)I,iiJh)

since B(x, x; ¢1, 1>h) is bilinear in ¢1 and 1>h. Next, using the change of

Using geometrical symmetry: the non-Abelian case
In this section, S is a non-Abelian finite group of order n , i.e, there exist
S, t E S such that st =f. ts. This includes the important practical case of the
dihedral symmetry group D m , l.e. the group of order n = 2m of the affine
transformations that leave a regular m-gon unchanged.
Review of basic results [4,8,9j. Here, the irreducible representations PII of S
are of integer degree dll ~ 1:
Pv :
s E S -+ PII(S) E GL(ed,,)
i.e, each PII(S) is a linear endomorphism of a dll-dimensional complex vector
space; moreover I the number R(S) of such representations and their degrees
d; are such that at least one of them is ~ 2 and :
The properties of the irreducible representations PII include the preservation
of group structure:

A space V of vector functions defined on 81 is decomposed into orthogonal
subspaces [4]:

with the projectors p~ defined by:
[P~v](x) = ~ L

From this definition and the properties of the representations, one has for
any s E S and v E V:
dv
[P~u](sx) = L
pti(S-1 )s[Ptiu](x)
k=1
(42)
Hence, for a given s E S and a point x E C, the value v(sx) of v at the images
of x can be expressed by virtue of (41) and (42) in terms of the restriction
v~i on C of the projections ptiv:

Moreover, let again Is = {x E ac,sti: E ac}. It is then easy to show, from
(42), that the dll-uple {v~, 1::; i ::; dll} offunctions defined on C are subject
to the following constraints:
dv
v:f(x) - LPti(s-l)svti(S-I X ) = 0
k=1
(44)
(note that the constraint does not depend on the rightmost index j). Accord-
ingly, for the non-Abelian case, let VII denote the set of dll-tuples of functions
vi (1 ::; f ~ dll) defined on C and such that any pair (Vi, v k) is linked through
the constraints (44) (with the index j omitted).

Calculation of field values at interior points
Displacement values at selected interior points x can be computed explicitly
using the representation formula (7) once the density c/J is known, and related
quantities (strains, stresses) at x can be easily obtained as well.
Let u = u 1 + u 2 in (7), where u l is the contribution of the integration
over SI. Exploiting symmetry affects the computation of u 1. Inserting the
decomposition (43) into (7) and following the now usual pattern, one obtains:

(note that sts = sst = Id). A close examination of (49) thus reveals that, for
a given interior point x, the same numerical quadrature effort is required by
(7) and (49). However, the terms within curly brackets in (49) do not depend
on B, so that the same numerical integrations can be reused (with different
weights p~b(B- 1)) to evaluate u 1 at all the n images of x under S.

Computational implications
7.1
Reduction of numerical quadrature effort
It is obvious from (56) that a reduction of both setup and solution compu-
tational efforts results from the block-diagonalization of the operator l3. The

Complete or Partial Geometrical Symmetry in SGBEM Formulations
265
numerical quadrature effort consists in evaluating discretized versions of
8t(u,v) == fc fc B(tx, Xj tu,v) dSx dS;;
for all t E 5 instead of
8(u,v) == r r B(x,xju,v)dSxdS;;
lSI lSI
Moreover, a useful consequence of equivariance (16) and the symmetry prop-
erties (14) of B is:
(50)
From this identity and the symmetry of the original bilinear form 8, the
block-diagonalized 8 is seen to entail a numerical quadrature effort n times
smaller than the original 8 .
7.2
Symmetry properties of the matrix equations
Abelian case. The irreducible representations PII are usually complex-valued
functions over 5 (e.g. (20) for cyclic groups). In that case, it can be shown
that the PII can be associated by conjugate pairs, i.e. that for any 1/ such that
PII is complex-valued, there exists 1/* such that PII* (5) = P~ (5). In that case,
from (24), v E VII ::::::} v* E VII*. Besides, using (50), one can show that:
complex-valued PII
(51)
i.e. that, although 8 is symmetric, the 811(u, v) are not individually sym-
metric, but have a 'reciprocal symmetry'. In some cases, including the very
common one of symmetry with respect to coordinate planes, the PII are real-
valued (see table I}; then, v E VII ::::::} v* E VII and the 811 are symmetric:
real-valued PII
(52)
Non-Abelian case. The symmetry properties of the matrices associated with
degree one representations are as in the Abelian case. Otherwise, one has
from (45):
8ii(u,v) = ; L pti(t-I)8t(u,v)

where 5' = {t E 5, t = C I } and 5" C 5 is chosen such that 5' n5" = 0 and
5 = 5' U 5" U {t- I , t E 5"}. First, as a consequence of (50) :
(54)

Also, whenever the irreducible representations p~l and p£k are real-valued,
one has
Besides , from (44):
{vlh$l$dO' E Vy =} {vl*h$l$dO' E Vy
Thus, if all p~l(t) are real-valued for a given II, the bilinear form
dO'L Eil(uk,v*l)
k,l=l
(where {ukh$i$dO' E Vy and {vlh$l$dO' E Vy) is symmetric. On the other
hand, if some
p~l(t) are complex-valued, it is not clear how to establish
the symmetry of the above bilinear form from the general properties of the
representations.
Besides, it is also important to note that in (48) the same bilinear form
E%~l= 1 E~l(uk, v*l) appears d; times; it should thus be assembled and fac-
tored once and then used to solve for all dy-uples
{«p~i h$k$dO' with i =
1, . .. ,dy •
Example: the dihedral group S = D3. Let Er and Es denote two distinct
planes in JR3 which intersect along the coordinate line OX3 and such that
the angle (En Es) is rr/3. The dihedral group D3 , which is the simplest non-
Abelian one, is generated by the symmetry s w.r.t. E s and the 2rr/3 rotation
r around OX3. Its irreducible representations are shown in Table 2; one has
R(S) = 3, d1= d2 = 1, d3 = 2.
For the case II = 3, more explicit expression for the E~l are obtained as
follows, using Table 2 and (50):
E~l(Ul, v h ) = EId(U1,v h ) + jEr(u1,v h ) +iBr(v h , u 1)
B~1(U2, v h ) = Bs(u2,v h ) + jBsr(u2,v h ) + j2Bsr2(U2,v h )
E~2(Ul , v2*) = Bs(ul, v2*) + j 2Bsr(u1,v2*) + jBsr2 (u 1, v2*)
E~2(U2, v2*) = B1d(U2,v 2*) + j 2Br(u2,v2*) + jBr(v2*,u 2)
It appears that BP(u,v) =
.B~2 (V , u) ; besides, since s = S-l, sr = (sr)-l
and sr2 = (sr2)-1, (54) implies that B~l(U,V) and E~2(U,V) are symmetric
(in both cases disregarding for the moment the constraints (44)).
In addition, the constraints (44) reduce to two independent restrictions,
as follows. If x E E s , x = sx, thus:

Hence, the one-to-one substitution {V2*,Vh} E V3 = {wl,w 2 } E V3 can be

Elastostatic problems, Abelian case. In the limit of zero frequency (i.e. kT =
0), the problem (1) becomes real-valued, as does the kernel function B. How-
ever, when the Pv are complex, Eqs. (22), (34), (35), (36) show that the
subproblems (37) are in general complex-valued even in that case. In fact, it
is easy to show in this case that:
Bv* (u, v) = [Bv]*(u, v)
Cv*(u, v) = [Cv]*(u, v)
r..(v) = [:Fv]*(v)
Thus, the equations for the v-subproblem and the v*-subproblem, and hence
their solutions (cPv' cPv*), are conjugate to each other and thus redundant. It
is sufficient to solve (say) the v-subproblem for uv . The contribution of the
conjugate pair (cPv' cPv*) to the reconstruction of the (real) global solution u
is then:
[PvcP](sx) + [Pv*cP](sx) =
p~(s)cPv + Pv(s)cP~ = 2Re(p~(s)cPV>
In the FEM framework, adequate combinations of the two conjugate equa-
tions are known to yield two coupled real-valued subproblems defined on the
(volumic) symmetry cell. Here, a similar approach could be applied to the
symmetry-reduced SGBEM. However, contrarily to the FEM case, this would
result in one subproblem of size 2N/n, and hence would not bring any ad-
vantage over solving directly the complex-valued subproblem of size N[n :

Conclusion
The analysis, conducted here for the simple case of Neumann boundary-
value problems, can be extended to the SGBEM formulations of more general
boundary-value problems. This strategy is especially interesting when S2 is
'small' (in terms of the number of degrees of freedom involved). This is for
instance the case for externally symmetric bodies containing holes, cracks
or other defects of arbitrary shape and location. This work is expected to
be highly beneficial to some computationally intensive problems like defect
identification in complex bodies exhibiting geometrical symmetry.

Abstract. This paper discusses a formulation and its applications of the new
Fast Multipole Method (FMM) to three-dimensional Boundary Integral Equation
Method (BIEM) in elastostatic crack problems. It is shown, through numerical
experiments, that the new FMM is more efficient than the original FMM.

Introduction
In spite of its apparent advantage of the reduced dimensionality, BIEM has so
far been applied to relatively small problems, compared to numerical methods
of the domain type such as FEM or FDM. This is because the resulting
matrix in BIEM is full, which implies that the memory requirement of BIEM
is O(N2), where N is the number of unknowns. Even more serious is the
drawback of BIEM in terms of the computational cost. Indeed, the buildup
of the coefficient matrix requires an O(N2) work, which further increases
to O(N3) if one attempts to solve matrix equations with direct methods
based on the LV decomposition. However, the appearance of FMM changed
the situation drastically: FMM reduces the computational cost of BIEM to
O(Nl+a(logN)f3) and the memory requirements to O(N) , where (): and (3 are
nonnegative numbers. With the help of FMM, BIEM can now be applied to
large scale problems.
FMM was proposed by Rokhlin [I] as a fast solver for integral equations for
the two-dimensional Laplace equation. This method was then made famous as
Greengard [2] improved the algorithm and applied it to multibody problems.
Since then FMM has been developed as a fast solution method for large scale
problems. We here cite a few papers related to the use of FMM and BIEM
in solid mechanics: Nishimura et a1. [3] for crack problems for the three-
dimensional Laplace equation, Fu et a1. [4], Fukui et a1. [5] and Takahashi et
a1. [6] for ordinary problems for three-dimensional elastostatics, Yoshida et
a1. [7,8] for crack problems in three-dimensional elastostatics and Fujiwara
[9] and Yoshida et a1. [10] for three-dimensional elastodynamics.
FMM provides a fast method of computing certain potential functions
using the multipole expansion in the evaluation of contributions from remote

sources. In this approach the effects of remote sources are aggregated into
quantities called multipole moments. The effects of these sources are eval-
uated not directly with the help of multipole expansion but in the form of
a series expansion called 'local expansion'. The process of converting multi-
pole moments into the coefficients of the local expansion is called M2L. In
the original FMM by Rokhlin the computational cost for the M2L trans-
lation dominates the performance especially in Helmholtz' equation or in
three-dimensional problems. In view of this Rokhlin introduced the diagonal
form [11,12] so as to reduce the computational cost for the M2L translation.
However, Rokhlin's diagonal form is known to have numerical instabilities in
Laplace's equation [13] or in Helmholtz' equation [14] with low frequency. In
order to overcome these problems Hrycak and Rokhlin [15] proposed a new
FMM for the two-dimensional Laplace equation, Greengard and Rokhlin [16]
and Cheng et al. [17] for the three-dimensional Laplace equation, and Green-
gard et al. [18] for the three-dimensional Helmholtz equation. Yoshida et al.
[19] investigated the use of the new FMM in crack problems for the Laplace
equation in 3D. In this paper we discuss an application of the new FMM to
three dimensional elastostatic crack problems. We shall show, via numerical
experiments, that the new FMM is more efficient than the original FMM,
especially when the cracks are distributed densely.
In this paper we shall use both indicial and direct notations for tensorial
quantities. The summation convention is used for repeated indices. Also the
-=-+
position vector of a point x will be denoted by either x or Ox, the latter
being the preferred notation when one needs to show the origin explicitly.

cates the limit on S from the positive (negative) side of S where the positive

mainly for the convenience of reference. See Yoshida et al. [7] for further

The starting point in the application of FMM to BIEM is to expand the
fundamental solution rij(x - y) into a series of products of functions of x
and those of y . For this purpose we use the well-known formula given by

endre function and a superposed bar indicates the complex conjugate. In
passing we point out that the use of solid harmonics in FMM has been sug-
gested by Perez-Jorda and Yang [21] among others. Using (7), we rewrite (4)

for Vy E Sy. We now compute the integral on the right hand side of (3) over

Algorithm for original FMM
The algorithm of the original FMM is described as follows:
Step 1. Discretisation:
Discretise S in the same manner as in the conventional BIEM.
Step 2.
Determination of octree structure:
Consider a cube which circumscribes S and call this cube the cell of level
O. Now take a cell (a parent cell) of levell (l 2: 0) and divide it into 8 equal
sub cubes whose edge lengths are half of that of the parent cell and call any of
them which contains some boundary elements a cell of level l + 1. Continue
the subdivision of cells until the number of boundary elements in a cell is
below a given number. A cell having no children is called a leaf.
Step 3.
Computation of the multipole moments:
We first compute the multipole moments associated with leaves via (12)
and (13) taking the centre (0) of the multipole moment as the centroid
of C. For a non-leaf cell C of level l we compute the associated multipole
moments recursively by adding all the multipole moments of C's children
after translating them via (14) and (15) from the centroids of C's children
(0) to that of C (0'). We repeat this procedure tracing the tree structure of
cells upward (decreasing l) until we reach level 2 cells.
Step 4. Computation of the local expansion:
We have to prepare some definitions first. We say that two cells are 'ad-
jacent cells at level l' if these cells are both of the level l and share at least
one vertex. Two cells are said to be 'well-separated at levell' if they are not
adjacent at level l but their parent cells are adjacent at level l - 1. The list
of all the well-separated cells from a levell cell C is called the interaction list
ofC.
We now compute the coefficients of local expansion associated with a
cell C, which are defined to be the sum of the contributions of the forms in
(17) and (18) from cells which are not adjacent to C. Obviously this sum is
divided into the contribution from cells in the interaction list of C and the
contribution from cells which are not adjacent to C's parent. One computes
the former by substituting the multipole moments associated with cells in
the interaction list of C into (17) and (18). Also, the latter is computed from
the coefficients of the local expansion of C's parent as one shifts the centre
of the expansion from the centroid of C's parent (xo) to that of C (xI) via
(19) and (20). We repeat these procedures starting from l = 2 and increasing
l along the tree of cells until we reach leaves.

New FMBIEM in Elastostatic Crack Problems in 3D
277
Step 5. Evaluation of the integral in (5):
The integral in (5) is now evaluated in leaves (denoted by C). First we
compute the contribution from boundary elements in cells adjacent to C using
(6) in the same manner as in the conventional BIEM and then compute the
contribution from cells which are not adjacent to C using (16). The sum of
these contributions gives the contribution from all boundary elements.
In the implementation of this algorithm one has to truncate the infinite
series with respect to n in (11) etc. at n = p. For a fixed p one shows that the
computational complexity of this algorithm is O(N) where N is the number
of boundary elements [1,2]. Also, the M2L operation in the 4th step is seen
to require an O(p4) work.

New FMM in Elastostatics
4.1
Formulation
We now consider a source point Y located at (Yl ,Y2,Y3) and a target point x
at (Xl ,X2, X3). The cell containing the source point Y is denoted by Cs and
the cell containing the target point x by Ct. Assume th at X3 > Y3 holds. We
then have the following integral representation:
Suppose that each of the cells C, and Ct has an edge length of d. Then the
double integral in (21) is evaluated with the following double sum:
1

s(e) M (k )
:L :L ~Z)dE XP(XiiX , k,j) Exp(Ox~ , k, j) Exp(-oy,k,j ) + e, (22)

where
Xo is a point near x, Ctj(k) is given by
c is the error term and the numbers s(c), M(k) , Gaussian weights Wk and
nodes Ak are given in Yarvin and Rokhlin [201. One may determine these
parameters considering the required accuracy. The expansion in (22) is called
the exponential expansion for 1/lx - yl.

With the exponential expansion in (22) and (4) we derive an exponential

where v? (p,q;xo) and V2(p,qjxo) are the coefficients of the incoming expo-
nential expansion at Xo, which are related to another set of coefficients of
exponential expansion W}(p, q;0) and W2(p, q; 0) via

We note that the relations in (23), (24,25) and (26,27) are conceptually similar
to (16), (17,18) and (12,13) in the original FMM, respectively. An important
difference between (24,25) and (17,18) is that (24) and (25) do not include
summation, while (17) and (18) do. In other words, the operations in (24)
and (25) are "diagonal". We shall see the implication of this fact later.
Since the function Exp(O"1:, k,j) is harmonic, it allows an expansion in
terms of Rn,m(O"1:). Indeed, one has

4.2
Rotation of Coefficients
In this section we shall remove the assumption that Ot is in +X3 direction of
C; made in the previous section. To this end we divide the interaction list of
C, into 6 lists: uplist, downlist, northlist, southlist, eastlist and westlist. The
uplist and downlist contain target cells located in +X3 and -X3 directions
of Os, respectively. The northlist and southlist contain target cells located
in +X2 and -X2 directions of C; except those in the uplist or downlist,
respectively. The eastlist and westlist contain remaining target cells located
in +XI and -Xl directions of Os, respectively. If the target cell is included
in lists other than the uplist of Os we rotate the coordinate system so that
the target cell is in the positive X3 direction viewed from the source cell,
where Xi denotes the new axis. In general the multipole moments in the new
coordinate system are obtained as follows:
n
M],n,m(O) = L
Rn,m,m,(v,a)M],n,m'(O),
m'=-n
m'=-n
(33)
(34)
where Rn,m,m' (v, a) is the coefficient of rotation, v is a unit vector par-
allel to the rotation axis and a is the rotation angle . The explicit form of
'R.n,m,m'(v, a) is given by (See Biedenharn and Louck [22])
Rn,m,m,(v,a) = (_1)m+m' (n + m')!(n - m')!
'" (ao - i(3)n+m-k(-ial - (2)m'-m+k(-ial + (2)k(ao + i(3)n-m'-k
L."
(n + m - k)!(m' - m + k)!k!(n - m' - k)!
'
k
(35)
where ao = cos(a/2) and ai = -Vi sin(a/2). The summation in (35) is carried
out over such k that the powers in the numerator are all non-negative.
We next describe the M2L translation process in the new FMM.
1. Rotation:
First we rotate the multipole moments via (33) and (34) so as to make
the procedure presented in 4.1 applicable. The specific forms of (33) and
(34) depend on the location of Ot and are described as follows:

Algorithm for the new FMM
(42)
(43)
The algorithm for the new FMM is given as follows:
Steps 1-3. Same as the steps 1-3 in 3.2.
Step 4.
Computation of the coefficients of the exponent ial expansions:
Compute the coefficients of the outgoing exponential expansions in each
cell using (29)-(30), taking the origin (0) at the centroid of the cell.
Step 5.
Computation of the coefficients of the local expansion:
We compute the coefficients of the local expansion of cells oflevel l, start-
ing from l = 2 and increasing l. Consider a level l cell C and another level
l cell C' which is contained in the interaction list of C . Depending on the
position of C' relative to C, we translate the coefficients of an appropriate
outgoing exponential expansion of C to those of the corresponding incoming
exponent ial expansion via (37) and (38) by shifting the centre of the expo-
nential expansion from the centroid of C (0) to that of C' (xo). We then use
(31), (32) and an appropriate rotation to convert the coefficients of the in-
coming exponential expansion to the coefficients of the local expansion. After
carry ing out these conversions for all cells in the interaction list of C , we add
them together via (42) and (43) to obtain the contribution from the interac-
tion list of C to the coefficients of the local expansion. To this we add the
coefficients of the local expansion of the parent of C after shifting the origin
from the centroid of the parent (xo) to that of C (Xl) via (19) and (20) to

complete the calculation of the coefficients of the local expansion associated
with C.
Step 6. Same as the 5th step in 3.2.
With this algorithm one shows that the M2L operation reduces to an
O(p3 ) work [16,17]. Hence the new FMM is considered to be more efficient
than the original FMM, which requires an O(p4) work for M2L, at least when
p is not very small.

Numerical Examples
In the FMM accelerated BIEM used in this paper we discretise (5) with
collocation and piecewise constant boundary elements. The resulting linear
system of equations is solved with the preconditioned GMRES, which requires
the product of the discretised matrix and the trial solution in each step
of the iteration. The computation of this matrix-vector product is carried
out efficiently with the FMM approaches discussed in the previous sections
without building up the matrix explicitly.
In our implementation in Fortran 77, the integrals in the multipole mo-
ments in (12) and (13) are computed numerically with Gaussian quadrature.
The infinite series in (11) and (16) are truncated at 10 terms (p = 10) and the
sums in (22), (23), (31) and (32) are computed with the 109 point generalised
Gaussian quadrature formula in Yarvin and Rokhlin [20]. Also, the maximum
number of boundary elements in a leaf is set to be 100. In GMRES we adopt
the block diagonal matrix corresponding to the leaves as the preconditioner
following Nishida and Hayami [23]. Also, the iteration is stopped when the
relative residual norm is below 10-5. The performance of our implemementa-
tion has been tested on a desktop computer having a DEC Alpha 21264(500
MHz) as the CPU.
5.1
One Crack
We consider an infinite space which contains one penny-shaped crack having
the radius of ao and the unit normal vector of n = (0,0,1). The function
t oo(x) is given by too(x) = (7"oon(x) where (7"00 is a tensor whose components
are zero except for O"~ = PO. Hence, one has tOO = (0, O,po). This asymptotic
condition means that the domain is subjected to a uniform uniaxial tension.
Also, Poisson's ratio is set to be 1/4, i.e. >. = u, This problem is solved with
the convent ional BIEM, the original FM-BIEM (Fast Multipole-BIEM) and
the new FM-BIEM. Fig.1 shows the 5736 DOF mesh and Fig.2 plots the
non-dimensional crack opening displacement J.t¢3/aOpO obtained with this
mesh. In Fig.2 the symbols indicated 'conv', 'fmm' and 'newfrnm' stand for
numerical results computed with the conventional BIEM, the original FM-
BIEM and the new FM-BIEM, respectively. Fig.2 shows good agreement in
numerical results. Fig.3 plots the total CPU time (sec.) vs the number of

283
unknowns. In Fig.3 the lines marked 'Tdir', 'Tfmm' and 'Tfmmnew' indicate
the CPU time required with the conventional BIEM, the original FM-BIEM
and the new FM-BIEM, respectively. This figure shows that the new FM-
BIEM is only slightly faster than the original FM-BIEM. This is because this
example is essentially a two-dimensional one where the computational cost
for the M2L translation is not dominant. In order to show the efficiency of
the new FMM more clearly we need to consider an example where boundary
elements are distributed three-dimensionally. Therefore we consider many
crack problems in the next example.

Many Cracks
We now consider an infinite space which contains an array of 12 x 12 x 12(=
1728) penny-shaped cracks (total DOF=1,285,632), each having the same
radius ao subjected to the same asymptotic condition as in the previous ex-
ample. The centroids of these cracks are located at the same interval of 4ao in
each coordinate direction, but the orientation of each crack is taken random.
Fig.4 plots the non-dimensional crack opening displacement (J1-¢/aopo) on the
non-dimensional mesh x/ao. The required CPU times with FM-BIEM and
the new FM-BIEM are 13954(sec.) and 8290(sec.), respectively. This result
shows that the new FM-BIEM is more efficient than the original FM-BIEM
when distribution of the boundary elements is dense in the domain. In this

Concluding Remarks
- In this paper we could successfully apply the new FMM to the three-
dimensional elastostatic crack problems and could show that the new
FMM is faster than the original FMM in sample problems.
- In the future work we plan to use singular elements to take the behaviour
of c/> near the crack tip into account and compute the interior stress field
using the FMM techniques proposed in Yoshida et al. [8].
- The proposed techniques can be extended to the Galerkin BIEM which
yields highly accurate numerical results for crack problems [8]. Also, the
new FMM for the three-dimensional Helmholtz equation proposed by
Greengard et al. [18] is expected to be applicable to three-dimensional
elastodynamics in the frequen cy domain.

Computational Crack Path Prediction and the
Singularities in Elastic-Plastic Stress Fields
Tetsuhiko Miyoshi

Abstract.
The paper justifies the assumption that the exponent of the first term
in asymptotic expansion of two-dimensional stresses at a crack tip of elastic-plastic
body is independent of the angle 8 in polar coordinates. First we discuss the case
of a total deformation theory and then apply the idea used there to an incremental
theory. These results can be effectively used to show the validity of a procedure
used in computational crack path prediction for elasic-plastic bodies. In Appendix
we show that, if the" J-integral " does not vanish, the exponent is independent of
the load parameter t too, and equal to -
~ for stational cracks in the material with
hardening, as is seen in elastic stresses.

Introduction
This research derives from a practical problem in computational crack path
prediction in elastic-plastic bodies . For formulating a crack extension problem
we need the criteria to determine the initiation, direction, speed and arrest of
the extension, at least. In this paper, however, we limit consideration to only
the direction. Several criteria to determine the direction of crack extension in
elastic media have been proposed. (see, for example,[2],[5],[6],[12]). Some of
them are applicable, at least formally, to plastic cracks too. The one which
is usually called the maximum stress criterion or max-
eY() criterion is one
of them. This criterion conjectures that the crack will grow in a direction
perpendicular to the maximum principal stress. This criterion is simple and
has wide applicability.
In a certain procedure applying the max-e» criterion, we meet a problem
related to the order of singularity of plasic solutions, which has been simply
assumed to be constant in the engineering literatures. The order of singularity
of the stresses in 2-dimensional elastic crack is O(r-!) in polar coordinates.
This fact is well known and is used widely in the practical application of
the theory of fracture. For plastic deformation there is a singular solution
known as HRR solution. This solution was found by Hutchinson[7] and Rice
and Rosengren[ll] . In seeking this solution they assume that the material
is governed by a deformation theory and that the exponent to express the
singularity is constant. However this constant assumption must be rigorously
examined, especially in applying the incremental plasticity theory, since the
exponent might be dependent of the degree of the hardening. In fact the
results in [1] for steadily growing cracks show the existence of such dependence
even for bilinear hardening materials.

In this paper we examine the validity of the constant exponent assump-
tion for in-plane plastic deformation. We discuss first the case based on a
deformation theory and then proceed to the case of an incremental theory
for materials with hardening. The starting assumption of the present paper
is, like many other literatures [1],[71 and [11], for example, the existence of
the stress function, and that the leading term of the stress function is of the
form
¢ = r s(8)(logr)i cp(B)
or
¢ = rs(t,lI) (log r)i cp(t,B)
in polar coordinates (r,B), where t denotes the loading parameter in the flow
theory of plasticity and j is an integer.
The paper shows that in both formulations the exponent 8 is independent
of B. In Appendix we show that, if an integral which is known as j -integral
does not vanish as r tends to 0, then 8 is independent of t too and is -
~
for stresses in the incremental formulation of stationary cracks as is seen in
the elastic deformation. Since our approach is based on the use of a stress
function, the equation to represent the compatibility condition of strains plays
a key role. In treating this equation we use a formal manipulation program.
The present study is motivated by the work of Kaminishi [81.
2
The max- U(J criterion
Throughout this paper we assume the following for simplicity, unless other-
wise stated. See [10], for example, for the details on the general theory of
plasticity.
(1) Plane-stress problem.
(2) Straight or curved crack with one end point (crack tip), stationary or
steadily extending to the x direction in (x, y) plane. The origin of the (x,y)
coordinates is taken at the crack tip, being the x coordinate the tangent to
the crack at the crack tip.
(3) Nonlineality appears only in the stress-strain relations.
(4) The von Mises yield function is employed.
Let (0"11,0"22,0"12) be the stresses in (x,y) coordinates (suffix 1 and 2 cor-
respond to the coordinates x and y, respectively). Let (r, B) be the polar
coordinates taken at the crack tip, being B = 0 the plus part of the x coor-
dinate. Let S be an arbitrary surface with direction B. Then the normal and
shear stresses on S are expressed as follows, respectively.
0" = O"u cos2 B+ 20"12 sin Bcos B+ 0"22 sin2 B
T = (0"22 -
0"11) sin BcosB+ 0"12 (cos2 B- sin2 B).
The stresses should be divergent at the crack tip. However if the leading
part of 0" can be written as
O"=rscp(B)+·· ·,
8<0

Singularities in Elastic-Plastic Stress Fields
291
in the vicinity of the crack tip, it is natural to think that, in such a small
region, the direction of the maximum tensile stress is, approximately, the
direction 0 at which the maximum of <p(0) is attained. The max- a8 criterion
conjectures, therefore, that the crack will grow in a direction perpendicular
to such O. Now it is easy to see that
da
dO = 2r,
so that the maximum of a is attained at such 0 that r = 0 is satisfied. There-
fore the problem of predicting the crack path reduces to find the direction
along which the shear stress r = r'(r, B) vanishes. Following experimental and
theoretical results, the variation of this stress is rather gentle even near the
crack tip and it is not so difficult to find the zero of the shear stress. In fact
if the kinking of the crack is small, we can effectively apply the Newton 's
method as follows. Let (r, (0) be an approximate zero of r(r, 0). If
0= r(r, 00 + 8) ~ r(r, ( 0 ) + r8(r,(0)8,
r(r,O) = r S1jJ(O)
(1)
we have the Newton correction
8 = _ r(r,(0)
r8(r, ( 0 )
Therefore a precise approximation of the zero of r will be obtained ( in
practical computation some modification is necessary, since the computation
1jJ' is difficult generally). This procedure, however, may break down if the
exponent s in (1) is dependent on O. In fact if s = s(O) we have
8 - _
1jJ(Bo)
-
s'(Oo)1jJ(Oo) logr + 1jJ'(Oo) '
that is, the correction 8 may not effectively work for small r. This situation
can be clearly illustrated by a simple example. Assume, for example, that
r(r,O) = Kr- t+82sinO.
Then the Newton correction 8 takes the following values for different r,
~

-0.199
-0.210 -0.242 -0.310

(00 = -
= 0.196 · ..)
16
Therefore, it is necessary to examine whether or not the exponent s is really
independent of O. This is the motivation of the present study.

Deformation theory
In this section we consider the material with the nonlinearity of the so called
Ramberg-Osgood type :

and check the validity of the constant exponent assumption by a method
which is applicable to other formulations of plasticity.
We follow the formulation in [7]. The stresses and strains are normalized by
ife , ife / E, respectively, where ife is the initial yield stress and E the initial
tangent of the stress - strain relation. We introduce the deviatonic stresses
1
Sij = aij - 3akkOij,
(3)
and the equivalent stress ae by
(4)
Then the general stress-strain relation which is equivalent to (2) is written
as follows. Let v be the Poisson's ratio:
1 - 2v
3
n-l
f ij = (1+ V)Sij + -3-appOij + '2aae
Sij'
(5)
Let a = (an 0'0 ,7rO) be the stresses in polar coordinates. If there exists
a stress function ¢ satisfying the following equation, then the equilibrium
equations are automatically satisfied.
ar = r-1¢r +r- 2¢00
0'0 = ¢rr
7rO = -(r-1¢0)r'
The von Mises yield function is written as follows.
ae = a; + a~ - arao + 37;0'
The stress-strain relations (5) are then written in polar coordinates as
n-l(
1)
lOr = O'r - VO'o +aae

n-l
ErO = 1 + V O'rO + '2aae
7rO.
Since the compatibility condition of the strains
r-1(rEO)rr + r- 2(Er)00 - r-1(Er)r - 2r-2(r(Ero)0)r = 0
(6)
must be satisfied, the governing equation of the stress function is written as
follows.
£j.2¢ + ~{r-l (0'~-1(2r¢rr - ¢r - r-1¢00))rr
+ 6r- 1 (a~-lr(r-l¢o) r)ro

(7)
+ r- 2 (O'~-l(-¢rr + 2r-1¢r + 2r- 2¢00))00 } = O.

Singularities in Elastic-Plastic Stress Fields
293
The HRR solution of this equation is sought in the form
(8)
where 8 is assumed to be constant. By using the J-integral twice or by solving
(7) numerically, this constant has been determined in [7] and [11] to be
2n+ 1
8=--.
n+l
(9)
We want to examine whether the constant assumption on 8 is valid. We
hence assume that the leading term of the stress function <p will be written
as follows.
(10)
Note that the stresses in the polar coordinates are then written as follows.
a; = r s(O)-2 [ (8(0) + (8'(0) logr)2 + 81/(0) lOgr) <p(0)
+28'(0)<p'(0) logr + <pl/(O) ]
(Yo = 8(0)(S(0) - l)rs(O)-2<p(0)
(11)
TrO = _rS(O)-2[ (8'(0) + (8(0) -1)8'(0)lOgr)<p(0)
+(8(0) - 1)<p'(O) ].
We examine the case where n is odd, so that the governing equation has
a polynomial nonlinearity. Substitution (11) into the stress - strain relation
leads the equation (7) to a nonlinear equation beginning from the leading
terms of the following form.
where Fi(0) is a function of 8 = 8(0) and ip, and of their derivatives. The cal-
culation of these coefficients is enormously complicated. We hence employed
a formal manipulation program. We cite below the coefficients of (log r)?' of
the terms of highest singularity in r of this equation for n = 3 and 5. The

These coefficients must vanish near the crack tip, as far as the equation (7)
holds . Therefore in both cases we have
<p(O)s'(O) = 0,
from the coefficients for m = 8(for n = 3) and for m = 12( for n = 5). It is
clear by (11) that <p(0) == 0 does not hold on any interval of positive length,
since the equivalent stress a; should diverge at the crack tip and therefore the
leading term of O'e should not vanish. s'(O)i- 0 implies that it must hold on a
certain interval I including 0 if s'(0) is continuous, and this implies <pC0) == 0
on I. Hence we have
s'(O) = 0
for all 0,
that is, s(0) is constant. Other coefficients therefore vanish automatically as
is seen from the above result.
Remark.
In the above argument we assumed (10) as the leading term of
the stress function. Even if we assume the more general form

the result is the same. In this case the non-zero term begins from m = 3j + 8,
for n = 3 for example, and the coefficient of (Iogr )?' is again
gar-8+3s(lI )<p3(B){s' (B) }8 .

Incremental theory - stationary cracks
In this section we apply the above method to the solution based on the
incremental theory of plasticity. Consider a stationary crack subjected to
increasing load. We assume that a sufficiently wide neighborhood of the crack
tip under consideration is in plastic state . Also we assume that the material
is governed by the so called Prandtl-Reuss' flow rule with kinematic hardning
condition.
The equilibrium equations in the Cartecian coordinates are given by

Let a
=
(Qr , all,Qrll) be the parameter to express the center of the yield
surface in the polar coordinates and
j2((1 - Q) = ((1r -
Qr)2 + ((111 - a ll )2- ((1r - Qr)((111 - all) + 3(Trll - Qrll)2.
We introduce the vector 8 j by
8j- (~~

-
8(1r ' 8(111 ' 8Trll
.
Then f. and Q are given by the following equation.
f.=C&+f.p

f.p = !..8j < 8j,& >,

where D is the matrix to denote the modulus of elasticity, <,> denotes
the inner product of vectors and () denotes the differentiation on a loading
parameter t. TJ denotes the rate of hardening which is assumed to be constant
in what follows. Also rJe is the initial yield stress and assumed to be unity
for simplicity. The plastic state is characterized by the conditions
j((1 - a) = rJe,
< 8j,& > 2: o.
As in the preceding section we introduce the stress function. Since the stress
should be dependent of the loading parameter we assume that, in the vicinity
of the crack tip, the stress function will take the form
¢J = rs(t ,lI)<p(t,B).

(15)
then the equilibrium equations in incremental form are automatically satis-
fied. Let us introduce a bounded function ~ = (~n~O,~rO) by
~ = (J - a .
(16)
This function is well defined and bounded at any point of the material since
the stress point (J is not able to go out of the yield surface. Substituting (14)
and (15) into (12) and using the compatibility condition of incremental form
r-1(rfO)rr + r- 2(fr) 66 - r- 1(fr)r - 2r-2(r(fro)0)r = 0,
(17)
we have an equation to be satisfied by the stress function.
We cite below the coefficients of r-4+s(O) (logr)m , the term of the highest
singularity of equation (17). A formal manipulation shows that the non-zero
coefficients begin from m = 4 and
for m = 4 :
(~ + (~r - ~.5~0)2) <p(t, B){so(t, B)}4
for m = 3 :
0
(if so(t,B) = 0)
for m = 2 :
3(~ + (~r - ~.5~e)2)<p(t,B){see(t,B)}2
(if SO(t,B) = 0)
for m = 1 :
0
(if so(t, B) = seo(t, B) = seee(t,B) = seooe(t, B) = 0)
These results imply again that
se(t, B) = 0,
(18)
as is expected.
Remark 1. Even if we assume the more general form, instead of (13),
<P = rs(t,O) (Iogr}' <p(t, B)
(19)
as the stress function, where j is plus or minus integer, we have the same
result. In this case the non-zero term begins from m = j+4 and the coefficient
of the highest term is again
(~ + (~r - ~.5~0)2)<p(t ,B){Se(t,B)}4 .
Remark 2. The independence of t, that is,
St(t, B) = 0
is not proved by the present method. This independence will be shown in
Appendix.

Incremental theory - steadily growing cracks
The above argument is valid for steadily extending cracks. Consider a crack
growing steadily and quasi-statically along the x axis. In this case the differ-
entiation ( ) must be understood as
(20)
We assumed for simplicty that the velocity of the crack extension is unity.
The form of the stress function is ( see [3],[4], for instance)
¢ = r S(O) (logr)i ep(O).
We require that this ¢ satisfies the relations
{
o; = r- 1¢ r +r- 2¢ 00
ao
= ¢rr
TrO = -(r- 1¢ O)r ,
so that the equilibrium equations are automatically satisfied. To define the
stress rates in polar coordinates we introduce the well known matrix M to
transform the stresses represented by polar coordinates into those in Carte-
sian coordinates:
(
cos2 0
sin20
- sin 20)
M =
sin20
cos2 0
sin 20
.
sin 0 cos 0 - sin 0 cos 0 cos 2()
The stress rates in Cartesian coordinates are obtained by differentiating
(all)
(ar)
a 22
= M
ao
a12
TrO
in the sense of (20). The stress rates in the polar coordinates are obtained by
inverting this relation, that is,
The other treatments are the same as in the stationary case. In this case
the non-zero term begins from m = 5 + j and the coefficient of the highest
term r - 5+s (0)(log r)5+i reads as follows.
(21)
Hence the situation is exactly the same as in the stationary cracks and the
exponent s(0) is independent of () in this case too.

Appendix: Estimation of the exponent
It is still open if the exponent is independent of the loading parameter t.
In this appendix we will show that this independence is assured if the so
called J-integral does not vanish . At the same time it will be shown that the
exponent is -! for stationary cracks.
In estimating the exponent of the singularity of stresses, Hutchinson[7]
and Rice and Rosengrenjl l] have employed the so called J-integral which is
valid for the deformation theory. The key role of this integral is the path-
independence, or for the present purpose that it does not vanish as r tends
to O. In this section we discuss the case of the incremental formulation for
stationary cracks. For steadily growing cracks the present approach will not
be valid since the integral of the J-integral type will vanish due to the low
singularity of the stresses and strainsjl]. We employ an integral known as
J-integral [9], which is originally derived so as to apply to various problems
including plasticity analysis. We will show that the exponent of singularity
is -!, as far as this integral does not vanish. In the following argument we
assume that
(1) The whole region that we consider is in plastic state.
(2) The singularity of the stresses and strains occurs only at the crack
tip.
(3) The order of singularity in stresses at the crack tip is estimated as
(22)
The assumption (22) is motivated by the singularity of the HRR solution.
Before introducing the J-integral we derive some preliminary estimates
of the stresses, strains and the displacements. Let S be defined by

S =

f. =Ca+ -Sa.

(23)
(24)
(25)

Singularities in Elastic-Plastic Stress Fields
299
To get the estimates of the singularities, we introduce a stress function </J as in
Section 3. We have already known that the exponent s of the stress function
is independent of the angle 0 in polar coordinates (see the Remark of Section
4). Therefore we take a function of the form
</J = rs(t)cp(t,O),
3
(2:::;s(t) <2)
as the stress function corresponding to the assumption (22). The stresses are
then expressed as follows for certain functions CPl.
(26)
Since the condition
must holds always, we have
0: = r 8 (t) - 2cpI (t , 0) + (bounded term),
and by (25)
(27)
t = r 8(t)-2cp2(t, 0) + (term of lower singularity).
(28)
Using the strain - displacement relation in polar coordinates
where U,r denotes the differentiation on r, we integrate the strains to get the
displacements. We then have
U = rs(t)-ICP3(t,O) + (higher order term).
(29)
It is also clear by (24) that
tp = r 8(t)-2cp4(t, 0)+ (term of lower singularity).
(30)
Now the J -integral is derived as follows. Let Ta and To be the circles
centered at a crack tip under consideration and of radious a and 8 (a > 8),
respectively. (Remark : As the following discussion shows, Ta and To need
not to be circles. Also, in [9],the integration to define the J-integral is carried
outside the process region in which the actual fracture should occur and the
application of continuum mechanics breaks down. We here assume, however ,
that the plasticity theory introduced before is valid in all the material and
neglect such an exceptional region) . By [la,o we denote the region bounded

following identity.

where T(er) denotes the traction vector on the circles and Vx the directional

(33)
where na is the inner zone of Fa. Note that the last term in the right-hand
side of (33), the integral over na , is finite and hence vanishes as a tends to
O. In fact, by (30) we have
fp,x = O(rs(t )- 3 ) ,
(34)
(35)
which implies the integrability of < a - a, fp,x >. This integral is slightly
different from the original ]-integral. In fact, in the original derivation the
]-integral includes the term of the form
r < a, fp,x > dxdy
ina
as the integral over the region na and does not include the term for the back
stress a . Note also that it is not clear if the integral in (35) is well defined. ]
stands for the so called energy release rate when this integration is applied
to purely elastic problems. This is the outline to derive the] -integral. It is
clear that this integral is path-independent under the previous assumptions.
Now we substitute (26),(27),(29) and (34) into (33). We then have
1]1 S; constant · (r2s(t)-3 + rs(t)-l) .
Therefore, if ] does not vanish as r tends to zero, we have
2s(t) - 3 S; O.

However, 2s(t) - 3 < a implies that the stresses have the singularity stronger
than O(r-!), which contradicts to the assumption (22). Hence the only pos-
sible case is
that is, the exponent of singularity in the stresses is independent of the pa-
rameter t and equal to -! as far as the J-integral does not vanish as r tends
to zero.

Textbooks
Those considering a book which might be suitable for the series are strongly advised
to contact the publisher or the series editors at an early stage.
§2. Categories i) and ii). These categories will be emphasized by Lecture Notes in
Computational Science and Engineering.Submissions by interdisciplinary teams of
authors are encouraged. The goal is to report new developments - quickly, inform-
ally,and in a way that will make them accessible to non-specialists. In the evaluation
of submissions timeliness of the work is an important criterion.Textsshould be well-
rounded, well-written and reasonably self-contained. In most cases the work will
contain results of others as well as those of the author(s). In each case the author(s)
should provide sufficient motivation, examples, and applications. In this respect,
Ph.D. theses will usually be deemed unsuitable for the Lecture Notes series. Proposals
for volumes in these categories should be submitted either to one of the series editors
or to Springer-Verlag,Heidelberg,and will be refereed.Aprovisional judgment on the
acceptability of a project can be based on partial information about the work:
a detailed outline describing the contents of each chapter, the estimated length, a
bibliography,and one or two sample chapters - or afirst draft.Afinal decision whether
to accept will rest on an evaluation of the completed work which should include
- at least 100pages of text;
- a table of contents;
- an informative introduction perhaps with some historical remarks which should be
accessible to readers unfamiliar with the topic treated;
- a subject index.
§3. Category iii). Conference proceedings will be considered for publication provided
that they are both of exceptional interest and devoted to a single topic. One (or more)
expert participants will act as the scientific editor(s) of the volume. They select the
papers which are suitable for inclusion and have them individually refereed as for a
journal. Papers not closely related to the central topic are to be excluded. Organizers
should contact Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering at the
planning stage.
In exceptional cases some other multi-author-volumes may be considered in this
category.
§4. Category iv) Textbooks on topics in the field of computational science and
engineering will be considered. They should be written for courses in CSEeducation.
Both graduate and undergraduate level are appropriate. Multidisciplinary topics are
especially welcome.
