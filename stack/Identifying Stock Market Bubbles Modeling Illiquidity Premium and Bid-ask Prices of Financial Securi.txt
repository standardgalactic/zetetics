Foreword
The purpose of this book, Identifying Stock Market Bubbles: Modeling Illiquidity
Premium and Bid-Ask Prices of the Financial Securities, is to deeply inquire,
holistically reﬂect on, and practically expose the current and emerging concept of
modern time modeling to the areas of ﬁnancial market dynamics and derivative
pricing with real-time data and signals. During the previous decades, the analytical
tools and the methodological toolbox of applied and ﬁnancial mathematics, and
of statistics, have gained the attention of numerous researchers and practitioners
from all over the world, providing a strong impact also in economics and ﬁnance.
Here, the notions of information on asset valuation and disparities among market
participants are turning out to be key issues from an integrated perspective, and
they are closely connected with further areas such as behavioral analysis, ﬁnancial
signal processing, agent-based modeling, and early detection of ﬁnancial bubbles
and liquidity squeezes.
This book seeks to revitalize, amid ongoing structural problems in ﬁnancial
markets, and reassess the role of liquidity through a new fundamental approach
to pricing of a range of ﬁnancial contracts, option contacts as a special case, which
focuses on a novice, yet intuitive and theoretically robust, framework of illiquidity
premium, with the help of the Conic Finance Theory. The book could become a
helpful compendium for risk managers, decision-makers, researchers, as well as
graduate students and practitioners in quantitative ﬁnance who aim to go beyond
conventional approaches to ﬁnancial modeling.
The author of this book is both an academic and practitioner in the area of applied
ﬁnancial mathematics, with considerable international research experience. He uses
the state-of-the-art model-based strong methods of mathematics as well as the less
model-based, more data-driven algorithms which are less rigorous mathematically
and released from ﬁrm calculus in order to integrate data-led approaches with a
view to efﬁciently coping with hard problems. Today, labeled by names like Conic
Finance and Two Price Economic Valuation, and by Operational Research and
Analytics, model-free and model-based streamlines of traditions and approaches
meet and exchange in various centers of research, at important congresses, and in
leading projects and agendas in all over the world. The herewith joint intellectual

Introduction
Liquidity is the crucial prerequisite for the normal working of ﬁnancial markets.
Only the properly liquid money markets can work successfully. The liquidity of
business sectors, more accurately the absence of it, inﬂuences the entire ﬁnancial
system, and the entire economy, repressing their typical way of working. The
ﬁnancial bubble of 2008 has indicated remarkable signiﬁcance of the liquidity of
the ﬁnancial markets, and in the meantime it pushed this inquiry to the spotlight.
The modiﬁcation and supplementation of the standard equilibrium and no-arbitrage
models which accept the presence of inﬁnity liquidity has turned into a need, as
there is a clear necessity to develop new pricing and detection models and risk
management systems.
A complete description and basic interpretation of liquidity does not exist.
Straightforward deﬁnitions in one sentence would be like, e.g., “Liquidity in a
ﬁnancial market is the capacity to assimilate easily the ﬂow of buy and sell orders—
...” [1]. Unfortunately, this deﬁnition cannot catch the reality of “liquidity”, since
liquidity is not a one-dimensional measurement but it rather incorporates several
measurements.
In illiquid markets, sales charges are altogether higher than in liquid markets, i.e.
deals may be executed with particularly higher expense and time. In this way it is not
unexpected that investors’ essential prerequisite is that every stock’s liquidity ought
to be proportionate and the trade costs have to be quantiﬁable. Measuring liquidity is
a complicated issue by itself, it is hard to express the majority of its angles with one
single pointer; likewise it is difﬁcult to gauge how much cost illiquidity produces
during the transaction, since liquidity can be explained along various measurements
and accordingly at any given time some of its distinctive characteristics can be in
the spotlight.

Introduction
Different aspects of liquidity may be organized as in below in order to display
the given levels of liquidity:
1. The capacity to make an exchange at all: This ﬁrst level of liquidity is self-
evident: if there is no liquidity entirely in the market, no exchange will occur. In
a liquid market, there exist no less than one bid and one ask quote that make an
exchange conceivable.
2. The capacity to buy or to sell a speciﬁc amount of an asset with impact on the
given price: In a liquid market, it is conceivable to exchange a speciﬁc measure
of shares with little effect on the cited cost.
3. The capacity to buy or to sell a speciﬁc quantity of an asset without impact on
the cited price: The more liquid a market, the less is the effect on the cited prices.
Along these lines, as the liquidity rises, in the long run a point will be achieved
where there is no more value effect for a speciﬁc quantity of shares.
4. The capacity to buy and to sell an asset at about the same cost at the same time.
5. The capacity to execute a trade from items 2–4 quickly.
During this research we put strong emphasis on an illiquidity indicator which
evaluates the differences between the bid and ask prices of ﬁnancial derivatives in
a real time frame. Another principle objective of the thesis is to help illiquidity as
an idea to be integrated into the routine of Risk Management Departments on a
daily basis, i.e., to give detailed resolutions which can be effectively incorporated
into their regular work, and also to correctly develop from hypothetical perspective.
Moreover, by evaluating the illiquidity premium we try to detect the ﬁnancial
bubbles before it collapses.
Stock market bubbles take place when the prices of stocks are exaggeratingly
higher than their fundamental value (intrinsic value). According to the fundamental
value of a security, an investor can decide whether the security is overvalued or
undervalued. If the intrinsic value of a security is higher than its current market
price, it is classiﬁed as overvalued, if otherwise occurs (i.e. intrinsic value lower
than market price), it is called as undervalued. Hence, an investor may build their
investment decision based on this criteria.
The thesis is divided into eight chapters and is broadly focused on one major
related topic, i.e., bid-ask spread or illiquidity premium. This chapter serves as
an introduction to the thesis and provides various motivations for the research
undertaken.
Chapter 2 provides a critical review of the current literature with existing bid-
ask spread measurement approaches. For the purpose of this thesis, we classify the
literature into three broad categories: (1) the ﬁrst one includes the literature about the
methods and techniques used in inventory models related to the bid-ask spread; (2)
the second category consists of the literature about models and useful tools to extract
the effective bid-ask spreads from information models; and (3) the third category
focuses on the model, of Conic Finance Theory which studies liquidity or bid-ask
spread in the context of asset pricing. This model abandons the one price universe,
and by combining theories of No-Arbitrage and Expected Utility it proposes two
price framework, one for buying and one for selling.

Chapter 3 gives an extended view onto Conic Finance Theory, by introducing
main deﬁnitions and theorems. Afterward, distortion functions are introduced with
an overview about several main functions used in the literature.
Chapter 4 starts by providing an introduction to the properties of a Brownian
Motion and, speciﬁcally, a Geometric Brownian Motion. It continues with the
derivation of the bid and ask prices of the European call and put options. After the
derivation of the relevant formulas for the options’ bid and ask prices, the chapter
moves on to the description of the ﬁnancial data used to obtain the presented results.
It continues to present a range of combined events that explains the increases in the
illiquidity premium during the course of the option maturity.
Chapter 5 sets out an extended model used for estimation of the effective bid and
ask prices as well as the illiquidity premium. The chapter starts by the introduction
of jump models and continues with the positive and negative attributes of these
models. The chapter then proceeds with the introduction of Kou model. Afterwards,
we calculate the distribution function of the stock price process that follows the
Kou model. During the calculation steps, we use Residue Theorem from Complex
Analysis and Inversion Formula from the Theory of Inverse Problems for densities.
Chapter 6 focuses on numerical estimations of the Kou model parameters. The
chapter begins with the theoretical introduction of several models used in numerical
calculation and moves to the evaluation of the parameters of the Kou model. After
veriﬁcation of the signiﬁcance of the parameters by using statistical tests, the chapter
ﬁnishes with the illiquidity premium calculation by using the bid and ask prices of
European options and with a corresponding optimization technique.
Chapter 7 presents a new Early-Warning signaling for ﬁnancial bubbles by
beneﬁting from the theory of Conic Finance, from optimization and selected
numerical methods. The chapter starts with the most famous historical bubbles and
it continues by identifying how the illiquidity premium can be regarded as a main
indicator for any upcoming ﬁnancial trouble or bubble. For this case, we consider
the U.S. markets since bubbles, mostly, have occurred in those markets.
The thesis concludes with Chap. 8 which presents a summary of the research
undertaken and provides directions for future work in this area. It draws together
our conclusions about the developed theory, the new ﬁndings and suggestions’ and
probable future enhancement of current research.

Chapter 2
Review on Research Conducted
There are two main approaches in explaining the theory of the spread between bid
and ask prices. The ﬁrst one describes the role of inventory and its impact on prices
formed by dealers. This approach focuses on the market maker’s inventory problem,
where buyers and sellers are liquidity traders without any informational advantages.
The second one describes the role of information asymmetry by analyzing the role of
trading insider information. In this approach, the market maker and liquidity traders
are both uninformed regarding to the information-motivated traders. In this chapter,
the notions spread and bid-ask spread will be used interchangeably.
2.1
Inventory Models
One of the earliest approaches in the price formation in market micro-structure
theory is considered to be inventory models. In these models, equilibrium prices
are the result of a dealer’s obligation to offer liquidity, and face uncertainty in order
ﬂow. Basically saying dealer may end up with a position in which a price risk will
arise. Hence, the spread in this case is assumed to be a compensation for bearing
that risk.
Among the ﬁrst scholars to propose spread as the liquidity measure was Demsetz
[7] in his article dated back to 1968. Demsetz shows that spread can be regarded as
the cost of immediacy or trading costs. This means that, spread would occur as the
consequence of the time measure of the trade action since traders who are eager to
do business at the earliest convenience have to pay a cost for this trade immediacy.
The importance of limit orders as a source of liquidity has also been emphasized
in the same article. The results of that paper show that the greater the activity (e.g.,
the number of trades) in the given stock the lower the spread, which indicates that
the cost of non-synchronization between demand and supply for similar assets is a
relation of the rate at which purchase and sell agreements reach the trading ﬂoor.

Review on Research Conducted
Another scholarly article was written by Garman [9]. In his article, Garman
argues that the ambiguity in the order ﬂow is the main cause of uncertainty in the
market makers’ cash position, because buy orders will cost money while sell orders
will generate cash. The article further indicates that the spread is an instrument that
market maker employs to control the order ﬂow, the corresponding cash position
and the arising inventory level. More speciﬁcally, endogeneity of the probability of
buying and selling orders depends on the listed bid and ask prices. Essentially, the
article argues that higher bid prices will increase the probability of facing a trader
who is selling while lower ask prices increase the probability of facing a trader who
is buying. A change in the spread enables the market maker to control the inventory,
but this in turn changes the cash position, which means that a trade-off is established
between controlling inventory and the cash position.
Ahimud and Mendelson in [1] analyze a price-setting market maker in an
economy with stochastic demand and supply where prices follow Poisson processes.
In this analysis, the spreads depend on the stock inventory position of the market
maker. Authors further derive the behavior of the spreads for demand and supply
functions with linear nature and prove that on a transaction bases price behavior is
inter-temporally dependent. In addition, the article proves that proﬁts will disappear
on a price dependence in cases where trade will be implemented contrary to the
market-maker, which indicates that price-changes with serial dependency are in line
with the market efﬁciency hypothesis.
Some inventory models deal with the optimization problems of the risk averse
market maker. The market maker is simply a liquidity provider who maximizes the
risk-return proﬁle of the held portfolio, hence, yielding minimal inventory costs. In
this articles, the main function of prices is adjustment of the stock position to the
necessary level (i.e. to the level that maximizes market makers utility of expected
wealth), therefore bid-ask spread is formed as a follow-up for this risk aversion.
In the context of Stoll [19], the spread can be seen as the cost of the vulnerability
to distinct set of risks, like information, holding and order. The analyses are done
for the investor or dealer willing to deviate from an optimal mean-variance efﬁcient
portfolio in order to facilitate trading. The spread therefore can be regarded as a
compensation for the dis-utility that arises from this deviation. Additionally, these
order costs consist of ﬁxed-order charges that decline with the order size and
information charges emerging as a result of the adverse selection from traders with
better informed dealers. As in Garman [9], Stoll’s model also treats order ﬂow as a
random process, controlled by the bid-ask prices. However, Stoll is more concerned
with the costs of offering immediacy while Garman focuses on the equilibrium price
under a random arrival of trades.
The model developed by Ho [11] is the multiperiod extension of Stoll [19]. It
considers additional order uncertainty and indicates that the spread can be split into
a risk premium and a risk neutral component. Speciﬁcally, holding costs rely upon
the value of the order, the variance of the return, the risk-aversion and the wealth of
the dealer, etc. The article assumes that when only holding costs are considered, the
stock position on its own does not affect the trade volume; only the placement of the
spread affects the trade volume. Moreover, the spread remains independent of the

inventory level, and also changes with the market maker’s planning horizon. In the
models discussed by Stoll [19] and Ho [11], the market makers only, discriminate
between different types of traders based on the volume.
One additional assumption of inventory models is that order ﬂows are uncor-
related with future price movements. This is very unlikely as order ﬂows contain
information about the markets’ perception about fundamentals. In this concept,
information models can be seen as earliest models that incorporate distinct kinds
of traders and the role of information onto the future price developments.
2.2
Information Models
The class of models that provide important insights of the role of adverse selection
into the price formation process is called information models. They can be divided
into two classes: one analyzes the impact of the traders with information on market
makers and the other one uses statistical models to analyze the bid-ask spread.
2.2.1
Informed Traders vs. Market Makers
A ﬁrst series of information-based models is introduced as competitive-behavior
models. The main assumption of these models is that the market participants act
competitively. Within this category we can include the works of Copeland and Galai
[6], Easley and O’Hara [8] and Glosten and Milgrom [10].
Copeland and Galai [6] use a 2-period structure to analyze the markets with
informed traders. In this structure, the interest of informed traders is obvious
while the uninformed traders do business for exogenous reasons. Dealers unable
to differentiate between these two types of investors, will apply positive spreads to
make up for the expected loss that dealer will bring upon himself in case there is
a probability of some investors being informed. The article also suggests that limit
orders or quotes are disclosed to the prospect of being “picked off” when the market
pricing varies, leading to unproﬁtable execution. Additionally, the asymmetry in the
timing of the moves is at the origin of the adverse selection.
Unlike Copeland and Galai [6], Glosten and Milgrom [10] form an exchange
with three participants: market maker, informed traders, and uninformed traders.
All participants ought to be risk neutral and competitive. The article shows that
the unbalanced information alone requires a positive spread, which relies upon
the nature of the underlying information, the number of informed traders and the
uninformed supply and demand elasticities. Prices form martingales and mirror all
publicly available information, hence, the market is semi-strong form of efﬁciency.
Additionally, adverse information costs bring almost no serial correlation in prices.
Eventually, when the adverse selection is exceptionally inﬂated, spreads increase so
much that markets close.

Both articles that we discussed above indicate that the likelihood of trade based
on information can cause a deviation between bid and ask prices. Easley and O’Hara
[8], on the contrary, show that the possibility of the same trade need not always
leads to a spread. Depending on the market conditions, traders with information
may determine to trade only considerable quantities, which will have no effect on
the prices of small trades. The article also establishes that prices and spreads will
vary across different trade volumes.
2.2.2
Bid-Ask Spread as the Statistical Model
There are numerous spread deﬁnitions. Some focus on the gap between the bid
and ask prices and some like Roll-Indicator introduced by Roll [18] determine the
adequate spread with regard to the ﬁrst-order serial covariance of changes of prices.
This indicator uses readily available time series of market prices, which makes it
efﬁcient and easy to use. In the same article, Roll considers an informationally
competent market with zero trading costs, meaning that any price changes would
be an explicit result of the release of new information. The paper presumes that in
an efﬁcient market, the likelihood of a trade occurring at the bid price is 0:5 and
it is independent of past transactions. Roll argues that in such a market, with only
an order processing component of the spread, the movement of transaction prices
between bid and ask creates a negative ﬁrst-order auto covariance of differences
in transaction values. Using this relationship, he derives a plain estimator of the
adequate spread:
SRoll D 2
p
Cov.Pt; Pt1/:
(2.1)
The generalized version of the Roll model, introduced by Choi et al. [4], allows
for the possibility of serial covariance in the chain of trade initiations. This means
that the possibility of the new trade being initiated at the ask (bid) price given
that the last trade occurred at the ask (bid) price may differ from 0:5. The authors
concluded that the conditional probability of an extension could be bigger than 0:5
because large market orders often initiate trades with more than one participant
as a counterparty. Hence, single trades will be recorded as multiple sequential
trades in a ticker tape output, with ticker tape being the earliest digital electronic
communications device, that transmitted stock price information over telegraph
lines till 1970. The article also derives the following modiﬁed Roll estimator:
SCSS D
p
Cov.Pt; Pt1/

(2.2)
with  indicating the likelihood of a trade reversal and, moreover the ﬁrst-order auto
covariance of transaction prices being negative.

The costs of inventory holding, order processing, and adverse selection are three
factors of the bid-ask spread analyzed by Stoll [20]. In this context, the relationship
between abnormal trading volume and elements beside adverse selection costs can
also force the negative relationship. This work also expresses that in the model,
possibility of a trade switch regarding inventory control (a sell followed by a buy
order or vice versa) is higher than 1
2.
Huang and Stoll [13] used trade indicator models and generalized the methodol-
ogy of Stoll [20] so that they would became able to assess the elements of the spread.
In their article, spread has been decomposed into inventory, order processing and
adverse selection components. Such a model assumes that all trades are of unitary
size, and the “true” public information price of a stock evolves according to the
following formula:
Vt DVt1 C ˛ S
2 .unexpected change in inventory/
C .public information innovation/
DVt1 C ˛ S
2 .It1  E ŒIt1 j It2/ C "t;
(2.3)
where "t is an indicator for the public information innovation and It is an indicator
function with the following speciﬁcations:
It D
(
1;
buyer initiated trade at time t;
1;
seller initiated trade at time t:
(2.4)
Hence, the expected change in inventory is simply:
E ŒIt1 j It2 D .1  2/It2;
(2.5)
with  being the reversal probability.
Lesmond in his article [15] allowed for the assessment of transaction costs by
using the zero-returns measure, which Roll [18] had assumed to be non-real since
transaction costs are not always accessible. Lesmond was also able to internally
calculate the efﬁcient transaction costs using historical data of security returns on a
daily basis. This estimate essentially contains trading costs in order to capture the
explicit cost of trade (i.e., the change between cost portions of sale and purchase).
Holden’s [12] extended Roll’s [18] assumption on securities being traded half of
the time at the ask and the other half at the bid by introducing a measure which
contains the probability that the stated end price may be the average of these prices.
Holder gives two justiﬁcations for this. Firstly, the last trade of the day may be
improving prices for both orders as a result of the buy and sell orders crossing the
midpoint. Secondly, the trade price may be set at the average of closing bid and ask
prices as the result of absence of sufﬁcient trades on the particular day.

2.2.3
Introduction of Transaction Costs
Another approach, different from the information and inventory models, given in
the literature is related with the transaction costs. The spread is assumed to be equal
to the fee expenses for trading and could be associated with numerous experimental
features of the asset under analysis, such as the ﬂow of order and quantity of trade.
Research also discusses liquid markets trading fees.
Constantinides [5] does not account for transaction costs in asset pricing, as
authors research shows that the risk premium due to these costs is very small.
He presumes a rather long holding period, and disputes that investors decrease the
frequency and amount of trades when transaction costs are large. The same line of
thinking has been used to reach an equilibrium condition with a deﬁnition of the
illiquidity premium. The decrease in expected return on an illiquid asset makes the
investor indifferent between the illiquid asset and a liquid asset.
By using martingales, Jouini and Kallal [14] investigated the no-arbitrage
problem in securities markets under transaction costs and constraints on short
sales. They showed that the lack of arbitrage is equivalent to the presence of
a frictionless arbitrage-free process between bid and ask prices. Hence, all the
constant proportional transaction cost models tested on frictionless arbitrage-free
price process, are arbitrage-free. The converse is not always true.
Lo et al. [16] analyzed the effect of ﬁxed transaction cost when investors have
a continuous trading need. Investors receive a non-traded income continuously
over time so that in the frictionless market, they trade continuously to share risks.
However, the existence of transaction costs prevents investors from the continuous
risk-sharing trading. The authors found that even a small transaction cost can lead
to a large non-trading zone and generate a signiﬁcant liquidity premium in asset
prices. In the presence of transaction cost, the trading volume is ﬁnite. The increase
of transaction cost, however, has marginal effects only on the trading volume.
2.3
Conic Finance
The models mentioned in Sects. 2.1 and 2.2 are based on empirical studies in
relatively liquid markets. The spread between bid and ask prices in those markets
have been justiﬁed by costs like the volume of trades and commissions. In this
thesis, we will analyze derivative markets which are often much less liquid and
requires market maker to have additional compensation for holding unhedgeable
risks. Contrary to the models formed on the law of one price, the model proposed
by Madan and Cherney [17] introduce two different prices for the price processes in
the market: one price for buying and another price for selling. They simply abandon
the law of one price and the no-arbitrage theory, and propose different formulas for
bid and ask prices applicable to ﬁnancial derivatives.

Carr et al. [2] introduce a new approach that combines the theories of arbitrage
pricing and expected utility maximization. More importantly, the set of opportuni-
ties is expanded from arbitrage opportunities to a set of acceptable opportunities,
and acceptable opportunities are deﬁned as opportunities that a wide range of risk-
averse investors would be willing to accept.
In a market with a vast amount of investment opportunities it is crucial to evaluate
the performance of all different opportunities in order to decide which investment
to make. The theory of Conic Finance is a new measure for performance and uses
indices of acceptability to choose between different investment opportunities. The
indices of acceptability are a mixture of the theory of expected utility maximization
and the arbitrage pricing theory. Need for little information is an advantage of
arbitrage pricing theory, but lack of strong implications to decide between two cash
ﬂows which are not arbitrage opportunities, when one cash ﬂow might be more
attractive to the investor than the other, is the major disadvantage of this theory.
On the other hand, the theory of expected utility maximization is a powerful tool
for the decision on the investment opportunity. This theory only works as long
as the behavior of an investor is consistent with the Von Neumann Morgenstern
axioms [21]. In practice this does not always hold and, more importantly, there are
difﬁculties in correctly specifying the required inputs for optimization. In summary,
the theory of expected utility maximization turns out not to be a good way to decide
whether an investor should accept or reject an investment opportunity.
Cherny and Madan [3] presented a set of axioms that might be satisﬁed by
measures of performance. They consider eight axioms: quasi-concavity, mono-
tonicity, scale invariance, Fatou property, law invariance, second-order stochastic
dominance, arbitrage and expectation consistency. When combined, the ﬁrst four
axioms deﬁne new acceptability indices. The other axioms are used to make
additional comparisons. Cherny and Madan used performance measures that assign
a value ˛.X/ to a stochastic investment opportunity. A higher value of ˛.X/ means
a higher level of acceptability. These values enable ﬁnancial managers to decide
between different investment opportunities.

Theory of Conic Finance
Some models try to determine whether an investor should invest in an uncertain
opportunity or not, for example it can be done by specifying an index that
measures the performance of a stochastic cash-ﬂow on the basis of some speciﬁc
characteristics. This reduces an investment decision to the comparison of a value
attached to the cash-ﬂow with the one that is attached to other cash-ﬂows or with
a certain benchmark. The main point here is to deﬁne which characteristics of
stochastic cash-ﬂows must be considered in order to develop an index that leads
to sound investment decisions.
The ﬁeld of Conic Finance speciﬁes a new index of acceptability as improvement
of the economic characteristics of the traditional performance measures. Theory
integrates the full probability distribution of a zero costs stochastic cash-ﬂow into
the index, which is used to calculate a stress level that the stochastic cash-ﬂow
can tolerate, while being attractive for a wide range of investors. A higher level
of maximum stress implies a higher level of acceptability that is attached to the
stochastic cash-ﬂow.
3.1
Conic Finance
In ﬁnance, transactions are based of buying or selling of a contracts or an
opportunity with a stochastic cash-ﬂow at a certain time in the future. Suppose that
a random variable X, a zero cost stochastic cash-ﬂow at some particular time, is
identiﬁed on probability space .; F ; P/. The assumption of a zero cost investment
is not entirely realistic, but it does not affect the generality of the theory, as the
premium, cost of the opportunity, can be borrowed at a risk-free rate and paid back
at the ﬁnal payoff date of the cash-ﬂow. The time value of money is important, that
is why suitable discount factors should be used in calculations.

Theory of Conic Finance
It is crucial to evaluate the performance of each investment when there are
numerous opportunities in the market in order to decide which investment to make.
In this regards, Conic Finance as a theory is based on indices of acceptability as
a new measure for performance. These indices of acceptability are a combination
of the Theory of Expected Utility Maximization and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory.
Arbitrage pricing theory only needs little information, which is an advantage, but it
cannot decide between two cash ﬂows that are not arbitrage opportunities, although
one cash ﬂow might be more attractive to the investor, which is a disadvantage. The
theory of Expected Utility Maximization is a very effective tool to decide which
investment opportunity should be accepted and which not. It works as long as the
behavior of an investor is guided by the Von Neumann Morgenstern axioms [5].
Unfortunately this is not always the case in practice and, even more importantly,
there are difﬁculties in correctly specifying the required inputs for optimization. In
brief, the theory of expected utility maximization turns out not to be a good way to
decide whether an investor should accept or reject an investment opportunity.
Carr et al. [2] introduced a new approach that combines the theories of arbitrage
pricing and expected utility maximization. Importance of this concept is the idea
that the set of opportunities is expanded from arbitrage opportunities to a set of
acceptable opportunities. Acceptable opportunities are deﬁned as opportunities that
a wide range of risk-averse investors will be willing to accept.
With a view to escape the details related to the ﬁnite moments, the subgroup of
delimited random variables deﬁned by L1 D L1.; F ; P/ will be used in this
thesis and, moreover a map of ˛ W L1 ! R
C, where R
C WD Œ0; 1, will be deﬁned
as the measure of performance. For a random variable X 2 L1 which could be a
cash ﬂow from a trading strategy, ˛.X/ will be measuring the performance or quality
of X.
3.2
Conic Finance in Practice
The space of traded cash ﬂows, which are all bounded random variables, is assumed
to be a base probability space .; F ; P/. Moreover, there is a unique pricing
measure Q, equivalent to P, and a complete market. In these regards, we assume that
we have a cash ﬂow, CF, that has a price of p such that p ¤ 0; then the difference
X D CF  p can be formed with zero price and any quantity of the cash ﬂow X may
be traded with the market. Moreover, the set of cash ﬂows traded in liquid markets
will have the property EQ.X/  0.
Speciﬁcally, if a cash ﬂow CF has a price of p and the cash ﬂow of X D CF  p
is bought by the market, then we may say that in an incomplete market the price of
CF, indicated by p, will be a bid price. It would be impossible for the market to sell
and keep X D p  CF, as an individual will be expected to pay a spread s, to the
market, which will be ready to get . p C s/  CF. In this setup, the set of cash-ﬂows
is no longer closed under negation due to the fact on incompleteness. The market

model is identiﬁed by deﬁning the set of cash ﬂows which is the cash ﬂows smaller
than the one in the liquid market.
It must be noted that the set of marketed cash ﬂows is convex, closed under
scaling, and also only a linear mixture of any amount of these cash ﬂows can be
marketed. The generic model for the set sustains the given two characteristics and,
thus, the set of cash ﬂows would nevertheless be a convex cone. Moreover, since
all non-negative cash ﬂows are marketed, it is obvious that the set consisting of
marketed cash ﬂows could be a convex cone and this set will include the non-
negative cash ﬂows. It can be easily deducted from Artzner et al. [1] that this set
will be made of all cash ﬂows X satisfying the following condition:
EQ .X/  0 for any Q 2 D;
(3.1)
where D is a set of measures that are equivalent to P, and also these sets are convex.
It is supposed that the risk-neutral universe is also included in D.
To achieve this degree of change for the set of given marketed cash ﬂows, Cherny
and Madan [3] proposed an acceptability index that permits to deliver the cash ﬂows
which are acceptable or equivalently marketed at level .
An index of acceptability is a function ˛ that links every delimited random
variable X to a number ˛.X/ in Œ0; 1, which is named as acceptability level of
X. Such an ˛ would have four features, as we have discussed in Sect. 3.1. First of
all, if 2 distinct random variables are acceptable at a level , then so does the sum
of these 2 random variables. Secondly, if one random variable is acceptable at a
level  and another one prevails over this random variable, then the second random
variable will also be acceptable at the same level. Thirdly, for a random variable Y
acceptable at a level  and for any positive scalar of a, a random variable aY would
also be acceptable at the same level. Lastly, if the set of random variables .Xn/n1
are all acceptable at a level  and Xn ! X in probability then the random variable
of X is also acceptable at the same level.
Cherny and Madan in their paper [3] provided examples of four new law-
invariant indices of acceptability and, hence, distortion functions related with them.
These indices, aimin, aimax, aimaxmin, and aiminmax (where “ai” means the
“acceptability index”) are established by taking into account 4 distinctive categories
of sampling:
•
aimin—a sample is formed as the expected value of the smallest of several
selections from the cash ﬂow distribution. The risk measure associated with this
acceptability index is called as minvar.
•
aimax—a sample is formed by making several selections from the distribution
and taking the biggest to get the cash ﬂow distribution. The relevant risk measure
is called as maxvar.
•
aiminmax and aimaxmin—merge the aforementioned processes in different con-
sequences. The applicable risk measures are called minmaxvar and maxminvar
appropriately.

Theory of Conic Finance
An elementary link exists between the groups of probability measures and
acceptability indices. Madan and Cherny in [4] state that any acceptability index
is linked to an increasing one-parameter family of sets of probability measures so
that the value ˛.X/ is the largest level  such that X has a positive expectation
under each measure from the set corresponding to the level . In other words, the
acceptability at level  means that all measures from the corresponding family value
X are positive. The index ˛.X/ is then the highest level of acceptability attained.
For the acceptability index of ˛, and for each  > 0 there is an absolutely
continuous set of probability measures of D equivalent to the initial probability
measure of P. A random variable is acceptability at level  if and only if it has a
positive expectation under each measure from D. In regards to the family .D/0,
the index ˛ will satisfy the subsequent theorem (for the proof see [3]).
Theorem 3.1 ([3]) A map ˛ from the set of bounded random variables on a base
probability space of .; F ; P/ to the extended half-line, Œ0; 1, is an acceptability
index if and only if there exists a family of sets of probability measures .D/0
equivalent to P such that D1  D2 for 1  2, and
˛.X/ D sup ˚  0 W EQ.X/  0 for all Q 2 D

(3.2)
where sup ; D 0.
Suppose that the trader sells a cash ﬂow, X, for which driven by competition he
charges a minimal price of a. Notwithstanding, the emerging remaining cash ﬂow,
a  X, ought to be ˛-acceptable at level . Hence, this price, a, would be the ask
price of X. For aX to be acceptable at level , the price a must exceed EQ .X/  0
for any Q 2 D, so the minimal price would be derived using the following formula:

(3.3)
For the buy side, when the trader buys a cash ﬂow, X, again driven by competition
he charges a maximum price of b. Nevertheless, the emerging remaining cash ﬂow,
X  b, again ought to be acceptable at level . Hence, this price, b, would be the bid
price and will have the following expression:
b .X/ D inf

Operational and parametric models for cash ﬂows can be formulated by restrict-
ing the characteristics of acceptability so that these models would completely map
the probability law of the imminent risk. Thus, in order to check the acceptability
at a level  for a random variable X, the only information needed is the CDF, FX,

of this process. Generally, investors and traders are caring about the relationship
between the future and presently held risks, and the probability law on its own is not
an adequate model for the market acceptability.
As proposed by Cherny and Madan in [3], parameter family of distortion
functions can be used to formulate an operational index of acceptability. A distortion
function, indicated by ‰, is an increasing concave function from Œ0; 1 onto Œ0; 1;
when applied to a cumulative distribution function, it is said to “distort” it at a
rate speciﬁed by the parameter . Because of the concavity, the distortion functions
will assign higher weights to lower outcomes of the random variable X, and higher
outcomes will be weighted lighter. Hence, the larger , the lower becomes the
distorted expectation of a cash ﬂow X, which is characterized as:
˛ .X/ D sup

where X is the random variable, F is the distribution function of X and   0.
The density ‰. FX.X// is identiﬁed in regard to the initial measure of P. We have
to indicate that for a concave distortion the new density gives more weight to the
losses when FX.X/ is near zero, and it decreases weights of the gains when FX.X/
is near one.
The value ˛.X/ expressed by Eq.(3.5) can be numerically computed if we have
the distribution function of X.
3.3
Distortion Functions
The distortion function performs a crucial part in the realization of explicit bid
and asks prices. As discussed, there are different distortion functions that can be
used. Although some of them are not preferred, due to some undesirable properties,
there are still a lot of different distortion functions to choose from. Therefore, an
interesting question might be whether there is one particular distortion function that
is best to use. Madan and Cherny [3] conclude that maxminvar and minmaxvar
provide relatively similar results and prefer one of them to maxvar and minvar. The
Wang transform that is used in this thesis is similar to minmaxvar. At this moment,
there is no scientiﬁc proof that one particular distortion function is best to use, so
further research on this topic is recommended.

This distortion function is based on the risk measure minvar, which corresponds
to acceptability index aimin. A disadvantage of minvar is that the maximal weight on
big losses is relatively small and hence this distortion function does not have enough
relevance in economic theory. Consumers are generally risk-averse and absolutely
do not want large losses, but this risk measure is too lenient towards large losses
and, therefore, not risk-averse enough to be a good risk measure. minvar is rarely
used, because there are more relevant alternatives. Figure 3.1 shows the effects of
the minvar distortion on the standard normal distribution. The PDF and CDF shift

therefore, is rarely used. The effects of this distortion is depicted in Fig. 3.2.

Chapter 4
Stock Prices Follow a Brownian Motion
In both expressions for calculating prices of put and call options the outcome rely
on the CDF of underlying process. In this instance, distribution function of the
stock process is needed to calibrate gamma. This part of the thesis assumes that
stock or index price processes are lognormally distributed. We will start this chapter
by introducing a Geometric Brownian Motion and then we will move onto the
calculation of the illiquidity premium. Moreover, by employing the assumptions of
Black-Scholes model, we will infer the distribution function of stock price process.
4.1
Geometric Brownian Motion: Introduction
Brownian motion stands in one of the central roles in probability theory, theory of
stochastic processes, and also in ﬁnance. We will start this section of the thesis with
a description of this process, and will move on to listing of several of the basic
properties of Brownian motion.
Deﬁnition 4.1 ([8]) On a probability space .; F ; P/, a real-valued stochastic
process .Wt/t0 is called a Brownian motion or a Wiener process, if it satisﬁes the
following conditions:
•
.Wt/t0 has independent increments. In other words, Wy  Wt and Ws  Wv are
independent for v < s  t < y;
•
.Wt/t0 has continuous paths;
•
Wt  Ws follows a Normal Distribution function with zero mean and variance of
t  s or Wt  Ws  N.0; t  s/ for 0  s < t.
The Brownian motion is called standard if it starts at 0, i.e., P.W0 D 0/ D 1.
The ﬁnite-dimensional distributions of Brownian motion are multivariate Gaus-
sian, so, .Wt/t0 is a Gaussian process. From the deﬁnition, we know that Wt  Ws

will have the same distribution as Wts  W0 D Wts, which is an N.0; t  s/
distribution.
From the above statement we can deduct that a Brownian motion has expectation
operator with the value of,
E.Wt/ D 0
.t  0/:
It has a covariance value of
Cov.Wt; Ws/ D minfs; tg
.s; t  0/:
Lévy’s characterization is often considered as another way to deﬁne and identify
Brownian motions.
Theorem 4.1 (Lévy’s Characterization [8]) Let .; F ; .Ft/t0; P/ be a ﬁltered
probability space. Let .Wt/t0 be an adapted continuous local martingale in regards
to .; F ; .Ft/t0; P/. In this case, W is a Brownian motion if and only if the
quadratic variation of W is equal to t, i.e., < W; W >tD t.
Brownian motion is assumed to be in the nature of the stock markets, the foreign
exchange markets, commodity markets and bond markets. In these markets assets
are changing within very small time and position intervals which happens continu-
ally, and this is in the very characteristics of the Brownian motion. Essentially, all
ﬁnancial asset pricing and derivatives pricing models are based on the mathematical
algorithms describing Brownian motions. These mathematical models are of main
importance to the work that is being done on market models and risk analysis.
One of these models is the Geometric Brownian Motion which has the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.2 ([10]) A stochastic process .St/t0 on a probability space of
.; F ; P/ is said to follow a Geometric Brownian Motion if it satisﬁes the stochastic
differential equation
dSt D St.dt C dWt/;
(4.1)
with  being a drift term and  being a volatility.
Equation (4.1) has a below given solution:
St D S0e. 2
2 /tCWt
.t  0/;
(4.2)
where S0 represents the initial value of stochastic process. The same model is also
used in pricing of option contracts.
Deﬁnition 4.3 ([3]) An option is the contract between two parties in which one
party has the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset, subject
to the contract.

4.2
Option Pricing with Geometric Brownian Motion
25
The rights beyond obligations given under the option contract has a ﬁnancial
value, so option buyers must pay a fee in order to purchase these rights, which
basically makes options an asset to buyers. The given assets infer or derive their
prices from their underlying assets, that is why they are called derivative assets
or derivative contract. Nowadays, option pricing techniques, by using stochastic
calculus, are among the most mathematically complex areas of ﬁnance [3].
4.2
Option Pricing with Geometric Brownian Motion
Knowing acceptability indices and distortion functions provides an opportunity to
compute expressions for bid and ask prices. It is critical to notice that in Conic
Finance the market is seen as a counterparty, willing to accept all stochastic process
or cash-ﬂows X that have an acceptability level of at least . The ask price a.X/ is
what the market asks from the trader, so the trader needs to pay that price to buy it.
The bid price b.X/ is the price that a trader gets for selling an asset to the market.
The market makers will set their price in such a manner that the payoff of variable X
is acceptable to them at level : speciﬁcally, for the case of an ask price the market
maker will require a random variable of a  X to be acceptable at the level of ,
which can be given in the inequality form as ˛.a  X/  , and for the case of a
bid price market maker will be satisﬁed in case when X b is acceptable at the level
of , or ˛.X  b/  . In the formulas below, with the use of Riemann-Stieltjes
integral in (3.6), we will derive the ask price and, then, the bid price of the ﬁnancial
instruments:
˛.a  X/   ”
Z 1

1
xd‰. FX.x//  0;
a.X/ D 
Z 1

(4.3)
Analogously, for b.X/, the bid price, we obtain:
˛.X  b/   ”
Z 1

Z 1
1
xd‰. FX.x//  0;
b.X/ D
Z 1
1
xd‰. FX.x//:
(4.4)
Theoretically, the ask price must be more than the bid price, because of the
concave characteristics of the distortion functions. The parameter , ﬁtting the
theoretical bid-ask prices around the historical market prices will be called, the
Implied Illiquidity Parameter or the Illiquidity Premium from here afterward.
It is assumed that .St/t0, the stock prices at times t  0, follow a Geometric
Brownian Motion [8], with a stochastic differential equation having the following

expression:
dSt D Stdt C StdWt
.t  0/;
(4.5)
where Wt .t  0/ a Brownian Motion, reﬂects uncertainty of the price process in a
standardized way.
The solution of Eq.(4.5) can be calculated to be equal to the following formula:
St D S0eYt;
(4.6)
where Yt D Wt C .  2
2 /t, .t  0/ is a Brownian Motion with drift term 
and scaling or volatility term of , with respect to probability measure P. Moreover,
S0 > 0 is assumed to be the initial value of price process. The Black-Scholes model
will be used to derive the distribution function of St .t  0/ [1].
With the help of ItOo’s Lemma which is shown in below, we can identify the
distribution of the given stock price process. Consider a process Xt, for t  t0, of the
form:
Xt D Xt0 C
Z t
t0
b.u; Xu/du C

.u; Xu/dWu;
where b.t; Xt/ and .t; Xt/ are continuous nonanticipating processes with

representation:

If we go one step further in the above calculations, we will have the following
expression of the stochastic differential equation:
dlnSt D .  1
22/dt C dWt:
From here we may simple deduct that the subsequent is true:
lnSt D lns0 C .  1
22/t C Wt;
(4.8)
or,
St D s0e. 1
2 2/tCWt;
(4.9)
where s0 denotes the initial value of the price process. From Eq.(4.8) we may
conclude that the process .lnSt/t0 has the Normal Distribution with mean . 
1
22/t and variance of 2t, which means that the process .St/t0 has the Lognormal
Distribution with the same parameters.
If we do the same calculation steps for the function of F.ST; T/ D lnST, we will
have the following results:
lnST D lns0 C .  1
22/T C WT;
(4.10)
or,
ST D s0e. 1
2 2/TCWT :
(4.11)
Let us assume that our price process given by Eq. (4.11) will start at time t instead
of t0 D 0, then Eq. (4.11) will have the following representation:
ST D s0e. 1
2 2/TCWT D Ste. 1
2 2/.Tt/C.WTWt/
D e. 1

It is known from measure theory that under the risk-neutral measure Q, the

Black-Scholes model assumes that the starting premium is borrowed at the risk-

needs to be multiplied by discount factor er.Tt/, which leads to the following

If we do the above calculation for the ask price of the European call option and
also the bid price of the European put option, we will get the formulas as presented
in Table 4.1.
4.4
Data and Numerical Application
In this part, we employ the formulas in Table 4.1 to real data and derive the daily
values of the . We use the data of European put and call options written on S&P
500 index. This index, depicted in Fig. 4.1, mainly consists of large U.S. companies
and trade either on the New York Stock Exchange or on the NASDAQ. We chose
this index option, because it gives a general overview of the North-American option
market that is one of the effective option markets in the world. Additionally, due to
the nature of the S&P 500 index we may assume that the company speciﬁc events
will have minor effects on the calculation of values of , and all other effects will
be the results or aftermath of the ﬁnancial bubble, when the S&P 500 index has
declined from its peak around 30% (from 1282 on August 28, 2008, to 900 on
October 13, 2008).
We obtained the data from a ﬁnancial database of Bloomberg Terminal. The data
contain the daily bid and ask prices of European call and European put options in the
period between 02=01=2008 and 16=12=2010, when U.S. mortgage crises emerged.
Both types of options have a strike price of 1300, a base date in January 2008 and
an expiration date in December 2010. The data also contain the daily values of the

As we have mentioned above, there are different distortion functions that can be
employed when applying the theory of Conic Finance. In this thesis, we used the
Wang transform, because this distortion function is almost similar to minmaxvar,
which is mostly used in literature, as the corresponding risk measure of minmaxvar
works best in most cases [2].
In Fig. 4.2, we display the spread between the bid and ask prices of the European
Call and Put options. It is obvious that the spread has substantially increased during
the U.S. Mortgage bubble.

Stock Prices Follow a Brownian Motion
Fig. 4.3 Interest rate on 3 months Treasury Bills
One of the parameters in the pricing model is the risk-free rate, depicted in
Fig. 4.3. It plays a crucial role in the Black-Scholes model, as the change in interest
rates will automatically change the call and put premiums. We determined r at time
t using the Bloomberg Terminal, by ﬁnding the risk-free rate at the given date and
corrected it for T  t, the time from moment t until the expiration date, T, of the
option.
In Fig. 4.3, we see the starting point of the stock market bubble in 2008 when the
interest rates reached one of their highest points. In 2008, during the mortgage crisis,
the labor market weakened and, moreover, business investment, consumer spending,
and industrial production decreased, as ﬁnancial markets remained utterly tense
and credit conditions stiffened. In general, the prospect for economic activity has
diminished further. Under these circumstances, the Federal Reserve employed all
tools and policies to encourage the continuation of sustainable economic growth and
to protect price stability. One of the implemented policies was cutting or decreasing
the interest rate to the levels that will stimulate the economic activity.
Another parameter, , illustrated in Fig. 4.4, is the volatility of the returns on the
S&P 500 index. We make use of implied volatility obtained with the use of Black-
Scholes formula.
The values of , related to the dataset are estimated by minimizing the total-
squared error (TSE). TSE is the sum of the squared variation between the market

The variable , can be estimated hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly

characteristics of the dataset is that it covers the period of the latest ﬁnancial crises.
It is essential to know the effects of a crisis on the acceptability level of the derivative
that needs to be priced. These effects can be taken into consideration by adjusting
the expected level of the .
Analyzing the bid and ask prices of the options and the corresponding values of

future values of the  to price ﬁnancial products. Figure 4.5 shows the minimum of

that the  never take values of zero, because this indicates that the bid and ask prices
never equal to the Black-Scholes price.

Fig. 4.5 Daily implied illiquidity
The implied illiquidity parameter, or , is highest between September 2008
and December 2008. September 2008 was a month full of escalations of several
problems in the ﬁnancial world. Numerous large and important banks had huge
problems, because the interbank lending market got severely worse; moreover, the
mortgage bubble had already been inﬂated to its maximum and the burst started. On
September 15-th the important investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt
after the U.S. government decided not to bail them out, and in the rest of September
several banks from all over the world went bankrupt. This led to extreme uncertainty
on the ﬁnancial markets and stock exchanges crashed, which caused higher spreads
between bid and ask prices. Therefore, days with a larger bid-ask spread were likely
to have higher values for .
Other peaks in the  level in Fig. 4.5 occurred in Spring and Summer 2009 and
in Spring 2010. In 2009 there was still uncertainty in the market after the crash in
2008 and important economic powers from all over the world were reporting highly
negative economic growth. Furthermore, large companies like Chrysler and General
Motors were in ﬁnancial trouble. This severe decline in economic growth can be an
explanation for the peaks of the  in 2009. The rise of the  in Spring 2010 can
be explained by the European Debt Crisis and by the problems of public ﬁnance in
countries such as Greece and Spain [6, 7].

Stock Prices Follow a Double Exponential
Jump-Diffusion Model
Leptokurticity, volatility clustering as well as implied volatility smile are keywords
which represent three deﬁciencies of Black-Scholes model. Hence, there have
been conducted various researches in order to adjust Black-Scholes model and
explain these facts on deﬁciency. Some of those studies include Chaos Theory and
fractal Brownian Motion [22, 25], Generalized Hyperbolic models [2, 3, 26], Levy
Processes [29], Constant Elasticity Variance model [7, 8] and many more.
In this chapter, we are going to review and apply the Jump-Diffusion models
proposed by Kou in [19].
5.1
Details of Jump-Diffusion Models
An experimental interest to use jump-diffusion models are the result of the reality
where asset return follow a heavy tail distribution. Nonetheless, heaviness of
the tail distributions are ambiguous, while several academicians prefer power
type distributions, and some favor exponential-type distributions. It is hard to
differentiate power-type tails from exponential-type tails by using empirical data
only when one has quite large sample size and a preference of either one of the
models as a subjective issue. Moreover, distribution selection has an important
meaning in reaction to specifying suitable risk measures [15].
There are numerous methods for the selections of the pricing measure, as
jump-diffusion models can result with incomplete markets, some of them are
entropy methods, mean-variance hedging, indifference pricing, local mean variance
hedging, etc. In this thesis, we employ the Esscher transform, which is giving an
easy transition from the base to a risk-neutral probability.

5.1.1
Reasons for Using Jump-Diffusion Models
Let us examine the daily prices of S&P
500 index (S&P
500) from January
1950 until mid 2016. We calculate the daily returns of S&P 500 by employing
continuously compounded returns, rt D ln
S.t/
S.t1/ .t  1/. The normalized daily
rates of returns are plotted in Fig. 5.1.
From Fig. 5.1 we can observe the big spikes in late 80th, 2000 and 2008. The
maximum and minimum values are about 11:2422 and 23:5872 times of standard
deviation. We have to take into account that for a standard normal random variable
Z, P.Z < 21:1550/ 	 2:6  10123.
Next, let us draw the histogram of the daily returns of S&P 500. Figure 5.2
presents the histogram together with the standard normal density function, which is
basically constrained inside the interval of .3; 3/. From the ﬁgure we may indicate
that the features of a high peak and of two heavy tails, of leptokurticity, are quite
evident.
5.1.2
Leptokurticity of Returns
Clearly the histogram of S&P 500 shows asymmetric heavy tails and a high top.
Beside S&P 500 this fact is true for almost all asset classes. High peaks and
asymmetric heavy tails are so apparent that a name “leptokurtic distribution” is

Fig. 5.2 Illustration of the histogram of the normalized daily returns of S&P 500 index and the

are determined as K D E. .X/4
4
/, and S D E. .X/3
3
/, respectively, and for
the standard normal density the kurtosis is equal to 3. If kurtosis is bigger than
3, the distribution will be named leptokurtic and it will have a higher peak and
heavier tails. Double-exponential distribution (DED) can be given as an example of
leptokurtic distributions.
To evaluate the sample skewness and kurtosis, the following formulas are used:
OS D

.n  1/O3
n
X
iD1
.Xi  NX/3;
OK D
1
.n  1/O4
n
X

.Xi  NX/4;
with O being the sample standard deviation. For the daily returns of the S&P 500
index, the kurtosis is equal to 30:1178, and the skewness is equal to 1:0101, where
negativity of skewness means that the return has a heavier left tail.
5.1.3
Exponential and Power-Type Tails
From what we said above, heavy tail distributions of stock returns are very much
obvious. In this regard, power and exponential-type tails distributions are the two
main classes used in the literature [10]. As indicated by Kou [19], right tails
having power-type distributions are not appropriate for the models with continuous
compounding.

5.1.4
Implied Volatility Smile
We can easily specify an inverse function that maps option price to the volatility,
due to the simple fact that prices derived from Black–Scholes model are monoton-
ically increasing functions of the volatility. In detail, implied volatility .T; K/ is
associated with a strike price of option, K, and a maturity T such that if used in the
Black–Scholes formula we will achieve a price that accurately equals the market
price of an option.
Implied volatility can be easily calculated from real-world prices with diverse
maturities and strike prices. If the assumptions of the geometric Brownian motion
are true, then implied volatilities should be equal to each other for all the options
on the same underlying. Nevertheless, options on the same underlying but with
distinctive strikes or maturities will have different implied volatilities.
Particularly, it is extensively investigated that if we depict implied volatilities
and strikes, then the volatility curve will resemble a “smile”, which means that the
implied volatility is a convex function of the strikes. Moreover, the “smile” curve
adjusts for distant maturities. It is beneﬁcial to note that leptokurticity under a risk-
neutral measure leads to the “volatility smiles” in option prices.
5.1.5
Alternatives for Black-Scholes Model
There have been made numerous analyses in order to customize the Black–Scholes
model and include leptokurticity, implied volatility smile and volatility clustering.
One type of these models is fractal Brownian motions, where Brownian motion
is replaced by the fractal Brownian motion which has dependent increments [22].
But, Rogers [25] indicates that these types of models may lead to arbitrage
opportunities. Another model is given by generalized hyperbolic models, which
changes the normal distribution assumption by some other class of Lévy process
distributions [2, 3, 26]. There are also stochastic volatility and GARCH models
[9, 11, 13, 16], designed to catch the volatility clustering effect. Constant elasticity
of variance (CEV) model [7, 8] and time-changed Lévy processes and Brownian
motion [4, 5, 14, 20, 21] are other types of alternatives of the aforementioned models.
Yet another type of model that capture leptokurticity, volatility clustering and
implied volatility smile is Jump-Diffusion models. Suggested by Merton [23] and
Kou [19], jump-diffusion models obey the following representation:
S.t/ D S.0/e. 1
2 2/tCW.t/
N.t/
Y
iD1
eYi
.t  0/;
with .Nt/t0 being a Poisson process. The model suggested by Merton assumes that
Y follow a normal distribution, and in the model proposed by Kou Y has a DED. This
distribution allows to have analytical solutions for some path-dependent options.

all random processes, .Nt/t0 , .Bt/t0, and .Vt/t0’s, are pairwise independent.
If solved the stochastic differential equation given by Eq.(5.1) will give us the
following formula of the asset price process:

Kou [19] proposed Y D ln.V/ to have an asymmetric DED with the density
fY. y/ D p1e1y1y0 C q2e2y1y<0;
with p; q  0, p C q D 1, representing the likelihood of up and down jumps
and 1 > 1, 2 > 0. The prerequisite of 1 > 1 is required to guarantee that
E.V/ < 1 and E.S.t// < 1, basically meaning that the typical up-jump will
not be more than 100%. For clarity and in order to have systematic solutions of
option pricing problems, the drift and the volatility terms are considered ﬁxed, and
the Brownian motion and jumps are expected to be one-dimensional. Ramezani and
Zeng [24] individually suggest a double-exponential jump-diffusion model from an
econometric aspect as a way to improve the empirical ﬁt of Merton’s normal jump-
diffusion model into stock price data.
The DED has two appealing characteristics that are important for the model.
First of all, it has the leptokurticity [17]. The leptokurticity of the distribution of
jump sizes is acquired by the return distribution. Secondly, as a special property of
the DED, originated from the exponential distribution, is the memoryless property.
This unique feature clariﬁes why closed-form solutions for option pricing problems
under the double-exponential jump-diffusion are possible even though it sounds
complicated for other models.

In order to compute the distribution function g of the ‚ D PNt

employ the Inversion Formula on the above calculated characteristics function.
Theorem 5.2 (Inversion Formula for Densities [18])
Let X

Using the Tonelli’s theorem [30] on interchanging the sequence of integration

we will be able to make the following changes in Eq. (5.11):

where ‚n D Pn

Using the ﬁnal part of Eq. (5.13) we may deduce that, in order to calculate the
distribution function PNt
kD1 Xk we will have to calculate the characteristics function
of Pn
kD1 Xk. Moreover, by using this characteristics function we will derive the
distribution function of Pn
kD1 Xk and afterward we will use Eq. (5.13) to arrive at
the distribution function of PNt
kD1 Xk. In this regards, we have the condition that all
the Xk, k 2 N, are i.i.d. random variables. Hence, the characteristics functions of
‚n D Pn

the product of the characteristic functions, or:

Since, the function Gk.z; x/ is analytical with respect to the variable z in the
domain, which is bounded by curve of DR; hence, the following equality holds

In order to get the distribution function of Lt, we will use the following deﬁnition
and theorem [18].
Deﬁnition 5.1 ([18]) Let X and Y be two continuous random variables with density
functions f.x/ and g.y/, respectively. We assume that both f.x/ and g.y/ are deﬁned
for all real numbers. Then the convolution of f and g, f 
 g, is the function given by
. f

f.z  y/g. y/dy

g.z  y/f. y/dy:
(5.41)
Theorem 5.3 ([18])
Let X and Y be two independent random variables with
density functions fX.x/ and fY.y/ deﬁned for all x. Then, the sum Z D X C Y is a
random variable with density function fZ.z/, where fZ is the convolution of fX and fY.
Let us take a closer look at Eq. (5.6). We may see that, as indicated above,
the right side can be separated into two components, one for the Sum of Double-
Exponential Process, g‚n.x/, and one for the Drift plus Brownian Motion part,
gDBM.x/. The distribution of the Sum of Double-Exponential Processes is charac-
terized with Eq. (5.37), and the distribution of the Drift plus Brownian Motion part
is given subsequently:

Risk-Neutral Dynamics
Under a risk-neutral measure, the ﬁnancial instrument must grow at a risk free rate
in order for the discounted prices to be a martingale. Hence, the very natural thing
to do is to specify the mean return rate, , that will be equal to a risk free rate, which
have been done for the Black-Scholes case and moreover refer to other variables as
a risk neutral, too. For any model that incorporates jump, as in our case the jump-
diffusion model, there are more that one equivalent risk-neutral measures Q  P
where the discounted prices become martingales. In another words, there is no way
an investor would be able to construct a hedging portfolio that is totally risk-free.
Incompleteness of the market is one of the crucial problems that we are
facing with jump-diffusion or Lévy processes. Surely, the risk arousing from
jumps is unhedgeable and no exclusive risk-neutral measure exists. Researchers
suggest that several measures with distant characteristics can be selected, such as
Hellinger distance, L2 distance, entropy or Kullback-Leibler distance, which would
be equivalent to the historical probability measure.
We select the Esscher measure as the change of measure technique that is
based on the compound return of the price process. Hans U. Gerber in his article
[12] has developed this change of measure. Our choice relies on several reasons.
Firstly, a mathematical viewpoint, in the sense of power metrics Esscher measure
can be regarded as the equivalent martingale measure closest to the real-world
probability measure. Secondly, we refer to an economic point of view. As the risk-
neutral universe for jump-diffusion models is not unique, the behavior of economic
agents toward risk will shape the prices. Thirdly, by employment of either neo-
Bernoulli theory or expected utility, we can achieve “clean” price with the principle
of marginal utility. In fact, it could be demonstrated that the proper prices derived
from a logarithmic utility or power utility function can be formulated by using the
Esscher measure that employs compound return calculation.
Asset value can be given by the exponent of Lévy process X or by the Doléans-
Dade exponential of some other process QX. The processes could be connected
among each other and connections between the characteristic triplets may be quickly
calculated. Hence, we are allowed to speak about the Esscher measure, speciﬁed

66

Stock Prices Follow a Double Exponential Jump-Diffusion Model
with QX. From the economic viewpoint, the given measure is associated with the
utility functions of exponential forms. Furthermore, when the given measure is
applied, Lévy processes stay as Lévy processes during the transition from the
real-world universe to the new risk-neutral universe. Under this risk measure, the
characteristic triplet of the process X also has a ready to use common formula.
Let us now employ of the Esscher transform in the framework of our universe.
Following Radon-Nikodym formula characterizes the Esscher risk-neutral measure
with one parameter, indicated by Q, which is related with the process X and the
parameter u:

in the subsequent way:

This latter condition writes as

where real-world probability is designated by  P. Lastly, the martingale condition
conforms the description of an answer of the next equation which is identiﬁed by
the parameter u:
 r C  P.uC1/   P.u/ D 0:
(5.117)
The main purpose of this part of the thesis is to identify the link between
parameters of the Kou model in the historical and in the risk-neutral world, by using
the rationale of the Laplace exponent under Qu. We will designate the solution of
Eq. (5.117) by u instead of u, and by Q in lieu of Qu the risk-neutral measure. In
this regard, we can easily have:

This generates a very easy equation, associating the Laplace exponent in the
(Esscher) risk-neutral measure with the same exponent in the historical universe:

Let us employ the above general outcome in the framework of Kou model, which
has the subsequent expression:

To achieve the corresponding martingale measure, the parameter u is selected
in a way so that the discounted price process would be a martingale. It can be
easily shown that the risk-neutral parameter u under the Esscher measure can be

The Esscher transform, parametrized only over u, is therefore entirely character-
ized at this stage.
Now, using Eq. (5.119) inside Eq. (5.118), and after some mild computations, one
obtains:

which is the relationship between the real-world and the risk-neutral parameters.
Equation (5.121) indicates that X is a Kou process under the Esscher risk-neutral
measure. The parameters of the process are presented in Eq. (5.122), where u D u
is the solution of Eq. (5.120). We have to take into account that the characteristic
triplet of the Kou process X under the Esscher measure could be achieved directly
from the representations of Eq. (5.121).
After the computations exhibited above, we will get the subsequent expression:

So, in conclusion, we can say that the gain process would still be a Kou process
in the risk-neutral world, although with distant parameters.
We can get all the details of the risk-neutral parameters by using the formulas
given by Eq. (5.122). The main conclusion may be summarized in the following
way: When the gain process follows a Kou model in the real-world universe, it

will follow similar Kou model in the risk-neutral universe, related to the selection
of correct Esscher measure. Moreover, under these circumstances the change of
parameter can be deﬁned as given in Eq. (5.122) above. Certainly, the formulas in
Eq. (5.122) show the way how the coefﬁcients of the real and the risk-neutral world
are exactly related. As a summary we may indicate that, in the selected risk-neutral
world, the following will hold true:

(5.123)
with OW being a standard Q-Brownian motion, ON being a Poisson process with ﬁxed

with density:
OfY. y/ D OpO1eO1yIf y0g C OqO2eO2yIf y<0g;
(5.124)
under the trivial conditions of O1 > 1, O2 > 0, Op; Oq > 0, and Op C Oq D 1.
We have to take into account that O is identiﬁed by O D Eh

Numerical Implementation and Parameter
Estimation Under KOU Model
In this chapter, an overview of the different estimation methods, and the cal-
culation of the parameters of the Kou model based on these estimations are
presented. Among the used estimation methods are Maximum-Likelihood Estima-
tion, Empirical Characteristic Function method, Generalized Method of moments,
and Cumulant Matching method.
6.1
Estimation Method: Theoretical Background
In the following subsections, we will explain some estimation methods that have
been used in this thesis.
6.1.1
Maximum-Likelihood Estimation
Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE) can be expressed as the likelihood function
of the given data. In other words the likelihood of a set of data is the probability
of achieving that particular set of data within the given probability distribution
model. Unknown model parameters are also incorporated in this expression. The
values of these parameters that maximize the sample likelihood are known as the
Maximum-Likelihood Estimates [15]. MLE method can be used in a large variety
of statistical, data mining and optimization situations which makes it a consistent
approach to parameter estimation problems. The choice of starting values affect
the estimation, and the optimality characteristics may not be appropriate for small
sample sets [15]. In ﬁnance, alternatives to the MLE approach have been used by
practitioners. Despite its generality and well-known asymptotic properties, such as
consistency, normality and efﬁciency, the likelihood function may not be tractable

in many situations, namely, due to its boundlessness over the parametric space,
instabilities or the existence of many local maxima [16]. Another obstacle with the
MLE approach is that a closed form density cannot be attained for some families
of distribution functions and, therefore, the MLE method will be computationally
expensive when applied.
Let us denote by S D .St/t0 the stochastic process of index values given at
equally-spaced times: the one period rate of return Xt D ln St  ln Stt assumed
to be i.i.d., where t is the length of any subinterval of equally spaced observations.
Let X denote the observed (random) return vector; then its PDF is:
f.X; /;
(6.1)
with  D .1; 2; : : : ; m/T being the vector of m unknown parameters that needs to
be calculated.
The likelihood function can be calculated by the following product:
L.Xj/ D
n
Y
iD1
f.Xi; /:
In writing the right hand side as the product of the density function assumptions
have been made that the random sample variables are i.i.d. The log likelihood
function is given by:
ln L.Xj/ D
n
X
iD1
ln f.Xi; /:
(6.2)
The MLE of  are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function. Since the
maxima of this function are the same with that of the log-likelihood, and due to the
monotonicity in  of natural logarithm function, we can maximize log-likelihood
which is much simpler to work with than likelihood function.
6.1.2
Generalized Method of Moments
Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) is a generalization of the classical Method
of Moments (MoM) estimation technique. MoM procedure equates population
moments to sample moments in order to estimate population parameters. Since
the introduction of GMM in 1982 by Hansen [10], it has been widely applied to
analyze economic and ﬁnancial data. Even though MLE is a more efﬁcient estimator
than GMM, the dependence of MLE on probability distribution can be a weakness.
Some of these problems are sensitivity of statistical properties to the distributional
assumption and computational burden [9]. In the GMM framework, the probability
density function is not speciﬁed and this makes GMM a more computationally

6.1

75
convenient method for parameter estimation. To employ the GMM to calculate
parameters, the estimators are derived from so called moment conditions. A moment
condition is a statement involving the data and the parameters [14]. For a dataset of
Xt, where t D 1; 2; : : : ; n, drawn from a given probability distribution P and the
parameter vector 0 satisﬁes the moment condition
E Œg.Xt; 0/ D 0
for some known function g. In GMM, the basic idea is to construct the function g to
form a valid moment condition, and the sample data are used to establish a sample
analog of E Œg./ using the Law of Large Numbers [9]. A parameter O is chosen to
solve the next equation

E Œg.Xt; 0/ D 0:
This allows us to consider the quadratic form

(6.3)
where by Mt./ we indicate
Mt./ D 1

E Œg.Xt; 0/;
and Wt is a symmetric, positive semi-deﬁnite matrix which may depend on the data
but it is required to converge in probability to a positive deﬁnite matrix for the
estimator to be well deﬁned. If Mt./ is a q  1 matrix, then W is a q  q matrix.
The estimate O is obtained by minimizing Qt./. There are two main problems
associated with the GMM, ﬁrst one is which moments to match, and the second
one is the number of moments included in estimation. Andersen [1] showed that the
inclusion of an excessive number of moments produces bigger biases and larger root
mean square errors. Hence, the employment of extra information may be harmful.
We can conveniently derive all the moments via the characteristic function by taking
advantage of the relationship between moments and cumulants. Denoting x as
a characteristic function of a random variable X and assuming that EjXjn < 1,
then x has n continuous partial derivatives at u D 0, and we obtain for all

where Mk and Ck are the kth moment and kth cumulant, respectively.
6.1.3
Characteristic Function Estimation Method
Characteristic Function (CF) estimation method is applied in situations when the
likelihood has more complicated form than the characteristic function because
the characteristic function (CF) is always bounded and is available in a simpler
form than the density in some important cases [16]. Empirical Characteristic
Function (ECF) preserves all information in the data because there is an injective
correspondence between the CF and cumulative distribution function due to the
fact that CF is the Fourier—Stietjes transform of the CDF and this justiﬁes the
use of the ECF estimation method [21] and, therefore, an inference based on
ECF can outperform the one which is based on generalized method of moments.
Moreover, the ﬁnal estimators will be consistent and asymptotically normal, under
some conditions. In Lévy models, the CF is known via Lévy Khintchine theorem,
given in below:
Theorem 6.1 (Lévy-Khinchin Representation [3])
Let .Xt/t0 be a Lévy process
in R with characteristic triplet .A; ; /. Then, the characteristic function of Xt
satisﬁes the relation
Xt.u/ D et .u/;
u 2 Rd;
where  .u/ known as the characteristics exponent and given by
 .u/ D iu  1
2Au2 C
Z
Rd

eiux  1  iuxIjxj1

.dx/;
where A is the diffusion component,  2 Rd is the drift component and  is a positive
Radon measure on Rd n f0g verifying:
Z
jxj<1
jxj2.dx/ < 1;
Z
jxj1
.dx/ < 1;
with  being a Lévy measure of the jump distribution.
The ECF estimation method will be used to model log-returns as i.i.d. random
variables using Kou’s model. This method builds upon the works of Jiang and
Knight [12] and Rockinger and Semenova [18] to evaluate the parameters of jump
diffusion models. Former article used ECF method to calculate the parameters of

afﬁne jump diffusion models with latent variables while the second one employed
the method to estimate the parameters of afﬁne jump diffusion models with
stochastic volatility. ECF method for i.i.d. random variables proposed by Heathcote
[11] is used in this thesis.
6.1.3.1

Monte-Carlo Simulation
A method for iteratively assessing a deterministic model by using as input the sets of
random numbers is called Monte-Carlo simulation. This method is employed when
the model is complicated, nonlinear, or comprising more than a couple uncertain
parameters. Monte-Carlo methods are based on the analogy between probability
and volume, and simulation can normally contain over 10,000 assessments of the
considered model [8].

The basic concept of Monte-Carlo simulation is as follows, assume that we are
analyzing a random variable Y on a probability space .; F ; P/, which also
notes the results of a conducted experiment. The repetitions of the experiment can
be modeled by suggesting a sequence of random variables Y1; Y2; : : : ; Yn, each
having the same probability distribution as Y. Assuming that Y1; Y2; : : : ; Yn are
independent, the sequence can be regarded as a model for repeated and independent
runs for the experiment [2]. The Strong Law of Large Numbers shows that with
certainty, we can derive the common expected values of the random variables.
6.1.4.2
Strong Law of Large Numbers

Let .Yi/i2N be a sequence of i.i.d. integrable random variables

Simulation of Kou Model
We simulate at ﬁxed set of dates 0 D t0 < t1 < : : : < tn without explicitly dis-
tinguishing the effects of the jump and diffusion terms, as speciﬁed by Glasserman
[8]. Let us set Xt D ln St .t D ft0; t1; : : : ; tng/, then the algorithm for the steps in a
sequential Monte-Carlo procedure for Kou model will be as follows:
1. Simulate Z  N.0; 1/,
2. Simulate N  P.
t/, where P stands for the Poisson distribution,
3. If N ¤ 0, then simulate ln Y1; : : : ; ln YN and set Jump D ln Y1 C : : : C ln YN else
if N D 0, set Jump D 0. Since an exponential distribution is basically a Gamma
distribution with shape and scale parameters of 1 and ˇ, then ln Y1 C : : : C ln YN
will have a Gamma distribution with shape parameter N and scale parameter ˇ,
and the sign of ln Yj is positive with probability p and negative with probability
1  p. In case if the Poisson random variable N takes the value n, the number of
ln Yj with positive sign obeys a Binomial distribution with parameters n and p.

Cumulant Matching Method

Numerical Implementation and Parameter Estimation Under KOU Model
of calculations. The procedure utilized in this thesis is an alternative version of
the Method of Moments and it is named as Cumulant Matching. The cumulant
catching method is based on the relationship between the population cumulant
and the distribution parameters. Population cumulants are not known, the sample
cumulants are used to estimate the parameters. Parameter estimation by cumulant
matching is known to yield consistent estimators, but these estimators are not
always efﬁcient [17]. The cumulants are matched with the sample central moments
because of the relationship that exists between them. The log-characteristic function
 .u/ D ln..u// is applied in generating the population cumulants Ck [3], with
k > 0. Using this relationship between the central moment Mk and Ck, the ﬁrst six
sample cumulants of the models can be computed from the sample moments in the
following way [13]:
OC1 DM1;
OC2 DM2;
OC3 DM3;
OC4 DM4  3M2
2;
OC5 DM5  10M3M2;
OC6 DM6  15M4M2  10M2
3 C 30M3
2;
where M1 is the mean and M2 being the second central moment is equal to the
variance of the sample.
For Kou model, equating the population cumulants of the models to the sample
cumulants gives the parameter estimates. As stated above, the parameters estimated
by this method are consistent, but not always efﬁcient. However, these estimates
provide a good initial parameter for the algorithms of GMM and ECF. Nevertheless,
the cumulant estimates may not exist or may have the wrong sign. In this thesis, the
method proposed involves setting the population cumulants Ck D OCk as the sample
cumulants, for k D 1; : : : ; 6. Solving these sets of equations without constraints
might lead to getting values outside of the range that is desired; for instance, one
could get a negative value for  or a value greater than 1 or less than 0 for p.
Therefore, we set
fk WD Ck  OCk;
(6.13)
and the Sum of Squared Error, by SSE WD f 2

6 ; furthermore, the
constrained optimization function fmincon from MATLAB is used to minimize SSE
subject to the constraints that  > 0, 1 > 1, 2 > 0 and 0  p  1. SSE is at its
minimum when Ck 	 OCk. In particular, Kou model is achieved as described in the

Maximum-Likelihood Estimation
The closed form of the transition density of Kou model is not known. Hence,
the density is approximated using inverse Fourier transform of the characteristic
function shown in Eq. (6.10):

After approximation of the right-hand side of Eq. (6.14) by using MATLAB
fmincon, and getting estimation of parameters from CMM as initial parameter, we
will minimize the negative value of the log-likelihood speciﬁed in Eq. (6.2), which is
equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood function. The parameters that maximize
the log-likelihood function will also maximize the likelihood function and will be
the MLE estimates for the proposed Kou model.
The integral given in Eq. (6.14) is evaluated using Matlab built-in function
quadgk. In this thesis, the MATLAB built-in function mle is employed to evaluate

is the dataset of log-returns used for calibration, and t is the period of these returns
(e.g., 
1
252 for daily returns using the unit 1 year, etc.).
Ideally, the weight function w.z/ should answer to the precision of O'.z/ as an
estimate of '.z/ for every z. Therefore it must be chosen as the reciprocal of the
variance of O'.z/:

with  being a true parameter. Nevertheless, this deﬁnition is not fruitful to deal
with, as it relies upon the unknown parameter vector  and therefore cannot be

simulated data [4].
Obtained parameter estimations of the Kou model are displayed in Table 6.3. The
values for the parameters depend on the estimation method used. For Kou Model,
estimation based on ECF saves time, because of Fourier inversion involved in using
the MLE estimation method.
Figure 6.2 illustrates the goodness of our ﬁt achieved. Solid line in the ﬁgure
indicates the Kernel density estimator applied directly on the data. Dashed line
on the other hand is the Kernel density estimator derived from the Kou model
simulation with parameters calculated via ECF. We note that indeed Kou model
ﬁts the smoothed returns density very well.

Fig. 6.2 Logarithm of the density for S&P 500 Index time series
For the sake of assessing the goodness of ﬁt of the Kou distributions to the market
index data from another point of view, we use the quantile-quantile (Q-Q)-plot. A Q-
Q plot is a plot of the quantiles of two distributions against each other. The order of
the points in the plot is chosen to analyze the two distributions. If the plotted points
lie roughly on the line y D x, then the compared distribution ﬁts the data well. In
order to show the goodness of ﬁt using Q-Q plot, the parameters obtained by ECF
from logreturns are used to simulate the distributions of the models, and then the
quantiles of the distributions are compared to the quantiles of historical log-return
data sets. Q-Q plots for our models are provided in Fig. 6.3. For the model based on
the normal distribution, the deviation from the straight line is clearly seen (cf. the
right panel). The Q-Q plots of the simulated returns against the historical returns
show that Kou models do signiﬁcantly better when compared to the models based
on normal distribution. The quantiles of the simulated distributions are much more
aligned with the quantiles of the historical return distribution than it was the case
for the plain normal distribution.
One-sample and Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic goodness-of-
ﬁt tests are also employed to elaborate the null hypothesis that the log-returns
have the normal distribution, and to test whether the empirical distribution Femp
and the ﬁtted distribution Fﬁt are sampled from the same distribution, respectively.
MATLAB’s one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Œh; p; ksstat; cv D kstest.x/, is
applied to compare the empirical data X to the standard normal distribution. The
null hypothesis says that the distribution function of X is the same as the standard
normal distribution. The alternative hypothesis is that the distribution function of X

signiﬁcantly different from the standard normal distribution. In case when the value
of h is equal to 1 the null hypothesis can be rejected at the 5% signiﬁcance level,
and if value of h is equal to 0 then the test will fail to reject the null hypothesis. The
null hypothesis is accepted if p is greater than 5% and rejected otherwise. As shown
in Table 6.4, the null hypothesis is rejected. In order to contrast the distributions of
the two data vectors we will employ the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The
test uses the empirical data X1 and the ﬁtted data X2 to check whether the empirical
cumulative distribution function Femp and the ﬁtted cumulative distribution function
Fﬁt are sampled from the same distribution. The null hypothesis consists of the
statement: X1 and X2 are from the same continuous distribution. The alternative
hypothesis is that these samples are from distant continuous distributions. As in the
one-sample test the null hypothesis will be rejected the 5% signiﬁcance level if h is
1, and the test will fail to reject the null hypothesis if h is 0. The test statistic is:

(6.20)
with ST being the index price at maturity time, K the strike price, and T the maturity

calculation will be minmaxvar function as it is similar to the Wang distortion
function that has been applied in the Brownian case. This distortion function
possesses the following representation:

Data and Numerical Application of the Estimation

In this part we will employ the formulas at Table 6.5 to real data and derive the daily
values of the . As in Sect. 4.4, we use the data of European put and call options
written on S&P 500 index. Again the chose of this index option is made mainly
because it gives a general overview of the North-American option market that is
one of the effective option markets in the world. Additionally, due to the nature
of the S&P 500 index we may assume that the company-speciﬁc events will have
minor effects only on the calculation of the values of , and all the effects will come
from the impacts of main events in the market, such as the ﬁnancial crisis.
Expressions of bid and ask prices of the European options in Table 6.5 are easy to
estimate numerically, if the distribution function of ST is given. The formulas related
to the put option, given by integrals with bounded limits, can be further simpliﬁed
by employing Simpson’s Rule for the numerical approximation of the integral

and, afterward, we will employ the method of Gauss-Legendre approximation.
The values of  on a dataset are again estimated by minimizing the total-squared
error (TSE), where TSE is the sum of the squared variations between the market
prices and the theoretical prices:

for example for daily  calculations 	 D 1, for weekly  calculation 	 D 5, and
so on. Minimizing TSE delivers the market level’s . We use Eq. (6.28) and the

The parameter  can be estimated hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly
as a constant value. We have estimated daily  values. One of the interesting
characteristics of the dataset is that it covers the period of the latest ﬁnancial crises.
It is essential to know the effects of a crisis on the acceptability level of the derivative
that needs to be priced. These effects can be taken into consideration by adjusting
the expected level of .
Figure 6.4 reﬂects the daily values of the Illiquidity Premium, calculated using
the Kou model.
Figure 6.5 depicts the differences between the illiquidity premium, calculated by
using the Kou and Black-Scholes Models.
There are several noticeable differences between the illiquidity premiums cal-
culated from different models. The ﬁrst one is the smoothness of the illiquidity
premium derived from Kou model. In our opinion this is the case due to the fact
that the Black-Scholes model does not take into account the jumps which have been
proved to be the part of the movements of ﬁnancial instruments. Kou model, on the
contrary, by employing a double-exponential jump process takes into account the
jumps related to the movements stock market price.

Secondly, the premium calculated from the Kou model starts with high values;
then it declines until the start of the Mortgage crisis, but the Black-Scholes model
does not have this feature as the illiquidity premium has a nearly constant value
initially. This is due to the fact that on 9th of August 2007, BNP Paribas, one of
the Systematically Important Financial Institutes (SIFI), announced that it ceased
activity of number of its hedge funds specialized over the mortgage debt. This
was the moment when it became clear that investors and bankers were incorrect
regarding the prices of more than trillions of dollars worth of derivative contracts,
and they were worth a lot less than these investors had imagined [5]. This action
of BNP Paribas began the seizure in the banking system and, moreover, in the
overall economy. Around then no one knew how enormous the losses were or how

6.4

95
big the exposure of individual banks to the crisis really was; thus, trust dissipated
overnight and banks quit working with each other, which send market and economy
to ﬂuctuate.
Thirdly, after a couple of months of low values, between May and June 2008,
which we think is the result of the calming of the market after the BNP Paribas news,
the illiquidity premium started to rise, which occurred around the beginning of the
third quarter of the year 2008. As we have mentioned, the premiums calculated
from the Black-Scholes model are ﬂat during the ﬁrst 3 quarters and show an
increase only towards the end of the third quarter of the 2008. The nearly one-
quarter of difference is related with the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers. On
15th of September 2008 the investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, as
the U.S. government did not bail it out. Before the bankruptcy, on 9th of June 2008,
Lehman Brothers reported a second-quarter loss of $2.8 billion [20]; moreover the
Lehman’s quest to ﬁnd a capital infusion created many speculations regarding them,
and so the uncertainty in the market increased, hence the illiquidity premium went
up.
At the point when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, the thought that all banks
were “too big to fail” no more remained true, and the outcome was that banks were
considered to be dangerous and risky. Within a month, the danger of a domino effect
through the worldwide monetary system constrained western governments to infuse
immeasurable amounts of capital into their banking system to counteract them from
collapsing. The banks were saved at the last possible second, however it was past the
point where it is possible to keep the worldwide economy from going into freefall.
This came after a period when high oil prices had inﬂuenced national banks that the
need was to keep interest rates high as a defense against expansion instead of to cut
them in expectation of the ﬁnancial crisis spreading to the real economy [5].
From Fig. 6.5 we may also see that there are two more peaks for the results
of the Kou model, namely, in early 2009 and in mid 2009. These peaks are also
true for the Black-Scholes model results. The ﬁrst peak in both models that has
occurred in early 2009 is related with the General Motors (GM) and Chrysler
solicitation of emergency loans with a speciﬁc end goal to address approaching
money deﬁciencies following dramatic drops in automobile deals all through 2008.
By April 2009, the circumstance had intensiﬁed to such an extent that both GM and
Chrysler were confronted with approaching Chap. 11 and liquidation. With the aim
to avoid unemployment increase and a destabilizing harm to the whole assembling
segment, the U.S. also, Canadian governments gave extraordinary ﬁnancial bailout
($85 billion) help in order for organizations to restructure [19]. Both organizations
independently petitioned for this protection by June 1, 2009, and this is where
uncertainty in the market started again, which corresponds to the second peak in
Fig. 6.5.

Illiquidity Premium and Connection
with Financial Bubbles
In this chapter, we present an early-warning signaling for ﬁnancial bubbles by
beneﬁting from the theory of Conic Finance, from optimization and suitably chosen
numerical methods. We consider the U.S. markets since bubbles, mostly, occur in
this market.
7.1
A Brief History of Financial Bubbles
Here, we present famous ﬁnancial bubbles which occurred in the history, in order
to perceive destructive results of a possible forthcoming bubble in present times and
future.
7.1.1
Tulip Mania
The ﬁrst well-known bubble in economic history is the tulip mania that originated
in the Republic of Netherlands in the 1630s. The nation was encountered an
extraordinary ﬂourishing in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, during which
the tulip was brought into Europe from the Ottoman Empire. The bloom quickly
turned into a desired extravagance thing and a symbol of status as a result of its
magniﬁcence and the abundance of its varieties. Countless speculators began trading
tulip and, therefore, the cost of the tulip bulbs raised to a mind blowing high levels.
For instance, the knob of “Viceroy” costed around 3000 and 4200 ﬂorins; at the same
time, a talented expert earned around 300 ﬂorins a year [25]. In February 1637, the
tulip market suddenly broke down [39] abruptly, as shown in Fig. 7.1.

7.1.2
South-Sea Bubble
The South-Sea bubble which originated in 1720 was an incredible ﬁnancial bubble,
caused by the stock speculation in the South-Sea Company. Along with the War of
the Spanish Succession, a lot of the British government obligations were issued, and
the administration needed to remove the interest rates of the obligation to alleviate
its ﬁnancial pressure. In the meantime, the stock of South-Sea organization was
exceptionally well known in the light of the fact that it was given a trade monopoly
with Spain’s South American provinces as an element of a treaty throughout the
War of Spanish Succession. The South-Sea Company wanted to hedge its risks by
purchasing the government obligations with its overvalued stocks and get a steady
income. Under this condition, the South-Sea scheme was put into action precisely
the same way as our arguments above. This plan was thought to be a win-win
trading. As an outcome, people in general began to purchase the stocks of South-Sea
Company and the illicit activities from the organization (misrepresentation, loaning
cash to the purchasers to empower the purchase of their stocks, etc.) increased the
irrational behavior.
As Fig. 7.2 shows, the offer cost had ascended from the time when the plan was
suggested: from 128 pounds in January, 1720, to 1000 pounds toward the beginning
of August, 1720, trailed by a sensational tumble down to around 100 pounds during
several months. Many investors lost a huge amounts of cash, along with Sir Isaac
Newton. When he was given a question regarding the continuance of the rising of
South-Sea stock, he replied: “I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the
madness of men” [38].
7.1.3
1929 Great Depression
The end of World War I introduced a new era to America. A time of certainty,
good faith and welfare was experienced by the people of the United States in the
1920s. After World War I, industrialization and development of new technologies,

for example, of radio, automobile and air ﬂight, supported the economic and social
blast. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, expanded all through the 1920s
and due to the nation’s solid economic conditions, the greater part of the ﬁnancial
experts believed that shares were the most certain investment. These brought about
numerous investors to purchase stocks, greedily [8]. After a while, speculators
acquired stocks on margin. In those years, just 10–20% of the stock cost were paid
by the purchaser and, thus, 80–90% of the expense of the stock cost were being
paid by the broker. Given the chance that the cost of the shares declined lower
than the loan amount, the agent or broker would most likely issue a margin call,
i.e., the purchaser had to pay back his loan as cash instantly. Along these lines,
to purchase shares on margin could be exceptionally unsafe. Nonetheless, in the
1920s, numerous investors appeared who anticipated to make a proﬁt on the stock
market effectively, called speculators, in order to buy these stocks on margin. They
assumed that this ascending process in prices would never end; so they could not
perceive how genuine the danger was which they were getting in [31].
So, after all of these speculations, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
increased from 60 to 400 between 1921 and 1929. This produced a considerable
number of new millionaires. Numerous individuals sold their homes and put their
savings into securities at the exchange markets. In any case, few individuals truly
knew about the companies in which they invested [8].

In 1929, from June through August, stocks prices saw some highest peaks.
Economist Irving Fisher expressed that “Stock prices have achieved what resembles
an all time high level”; this was just the comment numerous speculators needed to
hear and believe. On 3rd of September 1929, the closing price of DJIA index was
at 381:17 and after 2 days, the market started falling. Stock prices vacillated all
through September and into October [31].
As demonstrated in Fig. 7.3, a steady bear market, a market in which the prices
of shares were diminishing, had begun by October 1929. At 24th of October 1929
which is known as Black Thursday, alarm offering began since investors recognized
that the stock market boom was indeed an over-inﬂated speculative bubble [8].
Despite the fact that the Federal Reserve Bank raised interest rates a few times
to alleviate the uncertainty in securities’ exchange and the overheated economy in
1929, this could not prevent from a tragic end. At the point when stock markets
crashed at 28th and 29th of October, millionaire margin investors went bankrupt
right away. In November 1929, DJIA sharply declined from 400 to 145. Over $5
billion worth of business sector capitalization had vanished from stocks that were
traded at the New York Stock Exchange in only 3 days. The market crash of 1929
brought an extraordinary economic crisis, known as the Great Depression [8].

The Tech Bubble
By the mid 1990s, PCs were turning out to be progressively common for both
business and individual use. PCs already become to be truly helpful business
instruments that conceded their users a huge support in productivity. Business
applications were developed to help end users with a diversity of assignments from
bookkeeping via expense planning to word processing.
In the course of the 1990s, the U.S. PC industry chose to concentrate fundamen-
tally upon software as opposed to designing and assembling PC equipment. The
purpose behind this focus was founded in the reason that PC software was an item
with high overall revenues, dissimilar to PC equipment. Software organizations’
stocks were extremely strong performers all through the 1990s. Enthusiasm over the
software business prompted the making of numerous small software startups, with
a decent part of these organizations being pushed by undergrads in garages. For all
intents and purposes each software startup wanted to become “the Next Microsoft”.
By the mid 1990s, the index of technology stocks, NASDAQ, was ascending
at a high pace, making numerous tech-centered investors to become wealthy.
By 1994, the web ﬁrst got to be accessible to the general public. Very quickly,
companies saw the web as an important proﬁt opportunity, America Online (AOL),
Yahoo!, Amazon.com, EBay are a few examples of these opportunities. Technology
stocks continued on taking off and made an exceptionally solid incentive for more
technology startups to become traded at an open market. Tech startups kept on
paying their workers in stock options, meant great beneﬁts as long as stocks
preserved their strong upward direction.
From 1996 to 2000, the NASDAQ stock index increased from 600 to 5000
points. “Dot-com” startups, went on running by individuals who were scarcely out
of school, were opened up to the world and raised a huge amount of capital. A
considerable number of these companies needed clear marketable strategies and
signiﬁcantly more had no proﬁt at all.
By early 2000, a sense of reality began to return. Investors soon understood that
the dot-com dream had degenerated into an exemplary speculative bubble. In the
period of several months, the NASDAQ stock index slammed from 5000 to 2000,
as shown in Fig. 7.4. Several stocks which once had a multi-billion dollar market
capitalization, were off the map of the capital market as fast as they appeared. Panic
selling resulted as the stock market’s value broke down by trillions of dollars. The
NASDAQ further decreased to 800 by 2002. At the same time, various bookkeeping
scandals became known in which tech startups had falsely inﬂated their proﬁts. In
2001, the U.S. economy encountered a post dot-com bubble recession, which forced
the Federal Reserve to decrease interest rates again in order to stop the recession.
A huge number of technology experts lost their occupations and, since they had
invested into tech stocks, they also lost a noteworthy part of their life savings.

7.1.5
Subprime Mortgage Bubble
After the tech bubble and the September 11, 2001, the Federal Reserve stimulated
a battling economy by decreasing interest rates to historically low levels. In under
2 years, from December 2000 until November 2002, the Fed decreased the rates
from 6:5 to 1%. Contrasting this with the inﬂation rate, it is questionable that not
taking on debt would infer losing cash. Accordingly, a housing bull market was
created. Individuals with poor credit into this rush when mortgage lenders made
non-conventional home loans: interest-only loans, installment options and home
loans with augmented amortization periods.
Loan costs were generally low during the initial part of the decade. This low loan
fee environment spurred increase in home loan ﬁnancing and also in house prices.
It urged investors to look for instruments that offer a yield enhancement. In this
regards, subprime contracts offered higher yields than standard home loans and,
thus, they have been in demand for securitization. The interest for progressively
complex structured contract, for example, collateralized obligation obligations
(CDOs) which embed leverage inside their structure, exposed investors to a more
serious risk of default, however, with generally low ﬁnancing costs and rising house
prices. This risk was not viewed as excessive.
In the same time frame, ﬁnancial markets have been abnormally liquid, which has
cultivated higher leverage and more serious risk-taking. Spurred by enhanced risk
management strategies and a movement by worldwide banks towards the supposed
“originate-to-distribute” plan of action, where banks give loans, and then convey
a great part of the credit risk arousing from these loans to end investors. Hence,
ﬁnancial innovation has prompted a sensational development in the business sector
towards credit risk transfer instruments. In the course of the next 4 years, the
worldwide outstanding amount of credit default swaps has increased more than ten

7.1
A Brief History of Financial Bubbles
103
times [7]. At that time, investors had a much more extensive scope of instruments
available for them to price, repackage and circulate through the ﬁnancial markets.
From the above discussions, it is obvious that if a small problem arose inside the
subprime mortgage sector, it would rapidly spread to other sectors, too. In the long
run, loan fees increased and numerous subprime borrowers defaulted when their
loans’ payments were updated into much more regularly scheduled installments.
This left mortgage lenders with property that was worth less that the outstanding
credit because of decreasing house prices. Defaults expanded; the issue snowballed,
and some lenders went bankrupt. As subprime borrowers defaulted, investors in the
subordinate tranche of the subprime CDOs took the ﬁrst hit. This prompted lost
conﬁdence even among investors in the more secure tranches who had not endured
any losses. But as they started to sell their investment, that panic started. The ﬁre
sale of assets led to a downward spiral of prices and a freeze in funding for these
CDOs. In Fig. 7.5 we may see the real effect of this event on the S&P 500 index.
As we see from all of the popular bubble cases above, irrational expectations
constantly generate damaging ﬁnancial crashes. In fact, the enormous but enigmat-
ically comprehended reality of bubbles requests a high excellence in academics.
Nevertheless, academicians and national bankers attempt to discover a strategy to
anticipate the ﬁnancial bubbles and to build up a model and technique in order to
forecast the bubbles.
In the upcoming section, we will identify how the Illiquidity Premium can be
related to some ﬁnancial bubble and how we can identify the early warning signs of
the crisis with the help of Illiquidity Premium.

Illiquidity Premium and Connection with Financial Bubbles
7.2
Illiquidity Premium vs. Financial Bubbles
Financial bubbles occur when the prices of assets transiently accelerate upward
and raise over much their fundamental value (intrinsic value). The most common
calculation method of the fundamental value of a stock or any security is the
discounted cash ﬂow (DCF) analysis that is deﬁned as follows [3]:
Fundamental Value of a stock D DCF WD
CF1
.1 C d/1 C
CF2
.1 C d/2 C: : : C
CFn
.1 C d/n :
(7.1)
This formula beneﬁts from weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as a
discount variable to explain the time value of money. Here, d is a discount rate
and CFn (n 2 ZC) is a free cash ﬂow along periods n, calculated in the following
way [3]:
Free cash ﬂow D Net income C Amortization & Depreciation  Changes in
Working Capital  Capital Expenditures.
In an efﬁcient market, the price of an asset is equal to its fundamental value and,
according to the fundamental value of a security, an investor can decide whether the
security is overvalued or undervalued. If the intrinsic value of a security is higher
than its current market price, it is classiﬁed as overvalued, if not, it is called as
undervalued. If the price of an asset is less than its intrinsic value, a wise investor
will purchase more to get proﬁt. This behavior will boost the price of the security
until no further proﬁt can be obtained: in other words, until the price equals to the
intrinsic value. If an asset is traded at a price which is higher than its fundamental
value and if this case continue persistently, its price shows a bubble.
A bubble does not have a strong effect on the general economy if only a few
investors are effected. Bubbles can lead to major troubles when they emerge in a
ﬁnancial instrument that is regularly held. Therefore, devastating bubbles are, for
their major parts, the one in securities’ exchanges [5]. Since stock market bubbles
are only realized during a continuous bull market circumstance, the conﬁdence of
the traders is very high [6]. They believe that the demand for the stocks will never
end and stocks will always become proﬁtable. This belief about the stock market
causes irrational expectations, and it escalates the stock prices upward and inﬂates
the size of the stock market bubble as well. This trend ends when some investors
recognize that the prices have risen unrealistically, thus they begin selling their
stocks before the prices go down. Then, other traders follow this attitude; hence,
panic selling starts. Not always but mostly, this process is completed by a sharp
decline and when this acute drop occurs, it is said that the bubble bursted.
Most of the ﬁrms that are growing more and more rapidly through a stock market
bubble go bankrupt when the bubble bursts. This gives rise to an increase of the
unemployment rates [6]. Business and consumer consumptions diminish and this

7.2
Illiquidity Premium vs. Financial Bubbles
105
may cause to commence an economic recession [6]. Because of these negative
effects of bursting of a bubble, it is important to develop early-warning methods to
detect it, timely [19]. However, it is still exceptionally hard to describe, to calculate
and to keep them from further inﬂating ahead of time. Therefore, one of the various
scientiﬁc contributions of this thesis is to introduce an early-warning method for
bubbles, for the ﬁrst time by using derivative markets as an application ﬁeld of
Conic Finance theory which is a very new ﬁeld in the literature. This theory is
deeply connected with liquidity effects and risk behavior of ﬁnancial markets.
Here, as a new approach, we use implied liquidity from Conic Finance theory. In
ﬁnancial markets, liquidity is an important feature. It mirrors the asset’s capability
to be purchased or sold without a huge change in the price and with a least loss
of value. Liquidity is closely associated with bid-ask spread: highly liquid products
have a narrow spread; illiquid assets have a wide spread. During ﬁnancial shocks,
the liquidity is said to evaporate and, hence, drive further the bid and ask prices
of ﬁnancial securities from their fundamental values. Therefore, implied liquidity,
or as we called it in previous chapters, Illiquidity Premium has been thought as a
kind of indicator to detect bubbles. Also, Conic Finance theory is founded on the
basis of two concepts: acceptability and distorted expectations. The bubbles can be
interpreted as distorted expectations of investors; therefore, we beneﬁted from this
theory to identify stock market bubbles.
In Chaps. 4 and 6, we have already calculated the daily illiquidity premium for
the derivative market, and we saw that the premium increases during the times
of disturbance or recession and it decreases during the times of recovery and
expansion. In this regard, as we have mentioned in preceding paragraphs, illiquidity
premium can be regarded as an indicator for the market contraction or recession
and, speciﬁcally, for ﬁnancial bubbles. To do this we are going to utilize the sliding
window technique.
It is common practice to use a sliding-window to dynamically model the
changing properties, in our case: the illiquidity premium, of a single or multiple time
series. The simplest method makes use of a window of a ﬁxed length which slides
through the data at ﬁxed intervals, usually one datum at each step. This involves
updating some or all of the model parameters at each time step, using a window in
which a ﬁxed number of past data points are used to estimate the parameters. We
now describe some major criteria which need to be considered when selecting the
appropriate window length for a ﬁxed-length sliding-window. The window should
be large enough so as to accurately capture any variation of the market signals within
it. However, a large window also may not be able to properly reﬂect rapid changes
in the dynamics of the market and may result in big computational times. Therefore,
the window should be small enough so as to accurately compare disparity of the
market signals at corresponding points [26], without leading to “noisy” results.
However, a very small window may not contain enough data points for an accurate
computation of the dependency measure, which is illiquidity premium. Hence, any
sliding window model carries this complexity-beneﬁt trade-off with respect to the
choice of window length.

Illiquidity Premium and Connection with Financial Bubbles
Sliding window analysis of time series is usually applied to dynamically update
the parameters of a model. It is a common form to compute the parameter estimates
through a window of sample data which is sliding in a ﬁxed length. The estimates
of model parameters over the sliding windows should be similar if the data are
stationary. On the other hand, if the parameters change frequently or at some
observations, the rolling window analysis is able to detect the unstable changes over
the estimations [29].
In this thesis, we concentrate on dynamic variation of the stock markets’
movements advancing with time t, so we examine the illiquidity premium estimated
over a sliding window. In order to do this, we create a time-evolving sequence of
matrices by rolling the time window of 	 prices through the full data set. Saying in
another way, 	 will represent the sliding window length.
As having been indicated by us in the above paragraphs, the choice of 	 is a
compromise between an excessively noisy and an over excessively smoothed curve
[27]. Also, it must be taken in consideration the type of data that we are dealing
with. In this work, it would be interesting to study sizes 	 of the rolling window
to be 	 D 5 or 	 D 22 trading days, i.e., weekly and monthly data. Generally, the
shorter the interval, the earlier the early-warning for the crises and the better the
monitoring of the price process [18].
Equations (6.26), (6.27) or (6.28) are applied to calculate the illiquidity premium
over a subset of option bid and ask price series within the rolling window Œt	C1; t.
For instance, the illiquidity premium in the ﬁrst sliding windows are computed by
the price series within Œ1; 	 and Œ2; 	 C1 for the following sliding window. By only
shifting the time window by one data point, there is a signiﬁcant overlap in the data
contained in consecutive windows. This approach enables us to track the evolution
of the derivative market’s illiquidity premium and to identify time steps at which
there were signiﬁcant changes in it.
As we have noted, a sliding window approach will be used to analyse and
calculate the values for the illiquidity premium with respect to the data set. This
will help us to conﬁne the search for “early warning signs” to a few windows before
and after the events of interest. It is in the nature of this approach that we can apply
this technique to different intervals of ﬁxed size. Each one of these intervals can
be characterized by different results. Another purpose of our analysis on different
scales is to test the dependence of the results on the granularity of the data, since we
expected different behaviors at different scales for ﬁnancial time series. The other
studied criterion is the window size. We wonder: Do the results, in general, remain
the same independently of the size of the window?
Let us remember that in Eqs. (6.26)–(6.28), the parameter 	 stood for the number
of days for which we want to calculate the illiquidity premium. As we have
mentioned, for the weekly premiums we have to take 	 D 5, as the number of
business days in a week is ﬁve. Under these conditions, minimizing TSE gives
the market level’s weekly . Moreover, we generate sliding window values of 
by choosing a windows of 5 days of length and sliding it along the historical data,
beginning at the ﬁrst date (January 2, 2008) and continuing until the window reaches
the last date of the data (December 12, 2010). The window moves forward in steps

of 1 day. At each position of the window, the value of  is calculated, by using the
total sum-of-squares method, and assigned it against the window position.
We did the same calculation steps for the monthly values, too, but in this case we
took 22 working days. The results of these calculations can be found in Fig. 7.6 for
the Kou Model and in Fig. 7.7 for the Black-Scholes Model: for a comparison we
also provide the results of the daily illiquidity premium curve.
By analyzing the above ﬁgures we may see that the  never takes zero values, as
this indicates that in the two-price world the bid and ask prices never equal to each
other. One main difference between the illiquidity premium derived from Kou and
Black-Scholes models are the trend that the different curves follow. In premiums
derived from the Kou model, we may see that the curves do not have a signiﬁcant
change in local max and min values; they only shift to the right. Meanwhile, in

108
7
Illiquidity Premium and Connection with Financial Bubbles
the premiums derived from the Black-Scholes model we have seen that both the
local max and min and also the curves’ positions change. We believe that this
characteristics is due to the simple fact that the illiquidity premium derived from
the Black-Scholes model does not take into account the jumps, an inseparable part
of the stock market process and, hence when we calculate the sliding windows,
some of the jumps get smoothed out due to the increased size of the data used in
each window position.
Figures 7.8 and 7.9 represent the values of the implied illiquidity parameter for
the cases where we use monthly and weekly sliding windows.

Comparison with Other Bubble-Detection Techniques

As a result, we observed a sharply increasing process in the illiquidity premium
obtained from the derivatives market, when the bubble-burst time approaches.
Moreover, the increase in the illiquidity premium over periods, like ﬁnancial trouble
of Chrysler and General Motors or European debt crisis, etc., is lower than the
increase which we have calculated for the ﬁnancial crisis and the bubble-burst time,
which means that their effects on the U.S. economy were not as critical as the
Subprime Crisis.
As ﬁnal remarks of this chapter, we may deduct that an increase in the
illiquidity premium goes hand in hand with problems in the ﬁnancial market and,
in particular, with the ﬁnancial crises. In our opinion, this is related with the
investors’ unwillingness to execute the order during uncertain times, which can be
the times when there is an insufﬁcient information regarding the current economical
conditions or during the deteriorating state of the systematic institution, as in the
cases of Chrysler/General Motors or European debt crisis.
7.3
Comparison with Other Bubble-Detection Techniques
Bubbles are still a controversial subject in classical economics; they imply that there
is sizable and persistent deviation between the fundamental value of an asset and
its market value. But the dominant paradigm in economics, the Efﬁcient Market
Hypothesis (EMH) [22], states that all information about the fundamentals of an
asset are reﬂected in the market price through the action of the rational market
participants. As such, the fundamental and the market value are the same: if there
was a difference between the two, there would be an arbitrage opportunity and that
difference would quickly be traded away. An important challenge to this paradigm
is the empirical evidence about bubbles, such as the historical examples cited at the
beginning of Sect. 7.1. Furthermore, while economists who base their assumptions
on EMH argue that even large bubbles, such as the Tulip Mania, can be explained
fundamentally, a growing number of models have been proposed to explain these
phenomena. The theories on bubbles can be classiﬁed into three broad categories:
rational bubbles, heterogenous belief bubbles and behavioral bubbles. Before giving
an overview of the main bubble-related literature, we will explain the crucial concept
of (fundamental) value in economics. This overview of the existing literature does
not aim to be exhaustive, but rather to give a basic understanding of some of the
main theories.
7.3.1
Value in Economics
The notion of value in economics is based on two fundamental concepts. The ﬁrst
one can be enunciated as follows: $100 today is worth more than $100 tomorrow.
Generalizing this elementary concept, the present value of $CF in t years with an

110
7
Illiquidity Premium and Connection with Financial Bubbles
annual return of d is:
Present Value D
CF
.1 C d/t ;
(7.2)
where the exponent t comes from compounding. As we have indicated in Eq. (7.1)
the value of an asset distributing dividends CFt every year is:
Fundamental Value ( Price) D
1
X
tD0
CFt
.1 C d/t :
(7.3)
The second fundamental concept relates to the magnitude of d, also called
risk premium or weighted average cost of capital. Economics postulate a positive
relationship between risk and return. In other words, a higher risk has to be
remunerated by a higher return. The value d has a lower bound called the risk-
free rate (rf ) which is the remuneration that one gets for a riskless investment. It
embodies time value and for the U.S. market is usually proxied by the return on
U.S. T-bills. Determining the value of the additional component of d associated
with the riskiness of an asset is the major problem of economics. Theories such as
the Capital Asset Pricing Model [33] or the 3-factor model [11] propose speciﬁc
relationships between risk and return. Although this economic deﬁnition of value is
very narrow, since it ignores other dimensions of value such as the social or tactical
dimensions, it offers a well-deﬁned framework to postulate and test hypotheses.
7.3.2
Rational Bubbles
Rational bubbles are probably the dominant approach taken by economists to
explain the emergence of bubbles. These models examine the conditions under
which bubbles can form given that all the agents are rational.
The foundation of the rational bubble models is the one proposed by Blanchard
and Watson [4]. In this model, the value of an asset is decomposing into its
fundamental value and a bubble component:
Pricet D Pricefund
t
C Bt D Et
"
1
X
	DtC1
CFt
.1 C d/	1
#
C lim
T!1 Et

BT
.1 C d/Tt

;
(7.4)
where the fundamental component is the present value of the discounted future cash-
ﬂows (cf. Eq.(7.3)) and the bubble component is the present value at T ! 1. The
ﬁrst consequence of this model is that, for the bubble to exist, it has to grow with rate
d. Indeed, if the bubble would grow with growth rate dB < d, the present value of
the bubble component would be 0 and, as such, the price of the asset would be equal

7.3
Comparison with Other Bubble-Detection Techniques
111
to its fundamental value. In this case, we will have to replace BT with B0.1 CdB/Tt
in Eq. (7.4). If on the contrary, dB > d, the bubble component would be inﬁnite and,
as a consequence, so would be the price. The second implication of the model is that
the asset has to be lived inﬁnitely: suppose that the asset has a maturity date T. At
that time, the asset would be liquidated for its fundamental value and BT D 0. But
if BT D 0, nobody would be willing to buy the asset for more than its fundamental
value at T  1, knowing that one time step later, the bubble component will be 0.
This backward induction argument implies that a bubble can only exist for inﬁnitely
lived assets.
One of the many problems of the Blanchard and Watson’s model is that, as the
bubble component of the price grows exponentially, the price-to-cash-ﬂow ratio
becomes inﬁnite, i.e., limT!1.PriceT=CFT/ D 1, which is unrealistic. To remedy
this problem, Froot and Obstfeld [13] proposed to make the bubble component
depend on the cash ﬂows rather than on time. This choice was motivated by the
observation that investors are bad at predicting future cash ﬂows. By doing so, the
authors show that under the hypothesis of no bubbles, the price-to-cash-ﬂow ratio
would be constant, PriceT=CFT D k, with k being a constant. Applying this criteria
on the S&P 500 over the 1900–1988 period, they rejected the hypothesis of no
bubbles.
By relaxing the assumption about common knowledge, i.e., the fact that every-
body knows that everybody knows, and limiting short-selling, Allen et al. [2] show
that bubbles can form on ﬁnitely lived assets. The intuition behind this result is that
the absence of common knowledge eliminates the backward induction argument,
since a rational agent can hope to resell the asset to another one who might not know.
Furthermore, constraining short-selling limits the ability of the agents to learn other
agents’ private information from market prices.
Another class of models departs from the assumption that all agents are rational
and achieves bubbles by introducing a second class of traders that are behavioral
feedback traders. It is the interaction between the rational arbitrageurs and the
behavioral traders that creates the bubbles. Delong et al. [10] show that, in their
setup, rational arbitrageurs buy the asset after a good news in order to bait the
behavioral feedback traders into pushing the price further up, allowing the rational
agents to sell their stock shares proﬁtably at the expense of the behavioral ones.
In Abreu and Brunnermeier [1], all the rational agents know that there is a
bubble, but it is the difference of opinions about the timing of the start of the
bubble or, in other words, their estimate of the asset’s fundamental value that leads
to a synchronization problem, each agent not being able to burst the bubble on its
own. As such, rational arbitrageurs ride the bubble until they can synchronize, due
to a piece of exogenous information for example. These models offer a powerful
argument against the EHM which claims that even if there are irrational agents in
the market, rational arbitrageurs will prevent any possibility of mispricing.
Lin and Sornette [20] on the other hand argue that it is the difference of opinions
about the timing of the end of the bubble leading to the persistence of bubbles. They
support their claim by applying their model on real data and derive an operational
procedure that allows them to diagnose bubbles and forecast their termination.

112

Illiquidity Premium and Connection with Financial Bubbles
7.3.3
Heterogeneous Beliefs Bubbles
Heterogeneous belief bubbles take place in a setup where agents do not agree on the
fundamental value of the asset. This can be due to psychological biases, or due to
the difﬁculty in making predictions about an uncertain future. Miller [24] shows in
a very simple framework that given a limitation on short selling, the divergence in
opinion between the agents about the asset’s return leads to an equilibrium where
the price is higher than the average estimate. Put simply, the optimists push the price
higher than the average estimate because the pessimists stay out of the market, not
being able to fully reﬂect their opinion by shorting the asset. Moreover, the author
shows that the price of the asset increases with the diversity of the opinions about
its future returns.
In a dynamic framework, Harrison and Kreps [14] demonstrates that not only can
a bubble arise when agents have different opinions about the fundamentals of an
asset, but the price of the asset can even surpass the valuation of the most optimistic
agent. This happens because the optimistic agent chooses to pay a premium to buy
the asset in the hope of reselling it later when he will be pessimistic (and other
agents will be optimistic). We should note that short-selling is also restricted in this
model.
Scheinkman and Xiong [32] build their model on Harrison and Kreps [14] model
and extend it into continuous time. They interestingly conclude that bubbles are
characterized by higher trading volumes, a fact that can be observed empirically.
7.3.4
Behavioral Bubbles
Some ﬁnancial economists agree that psychological biases must play a fundamen-
tal role in the formation of bubbles, departing completely from the claim that
agents are rational, and frontally attacking the EHM. Shiller [34] cites several
behavioral mechanisms to be at the origin of bubbles. Among the most relevant
ones are positive feedback loops between price and investor’s enthusiasm, as well
as herding, i.e., the fact that people tend to imitate each other. In the light of
the historical bubbles and crashes, some of which were described in previous
sections, these mechanisms seem very convincing in generating bubbles. It is
also worth mentioning the work of Hens and Schenk-Hoppé [15] who show in
an evolutionary framework, where strategies implemented by heterogenous agents
with different opinions and behaviors compete for market capital, that seemingly
irrational strategies can outperform seemingly rational ones.
Models coming from physics, in particular the Ising model, have been very
successful at describing how imitation between agents can lead to bifurcation in
their aggregate opinions [35]. The Ising model consists of agents inﬂuencing each
other. In a nutshell, if an agent is surrounded by agents willing to sell, it is likely
that he or she will start selling as well. Two opposite forces are at play: the ordering

7.3
Comparison with Other Bubble-Detection Techniques
113
force of social imitation and the disordering force of idiosyncratic noise. In an Ising-
like framework, Orléan [28] shows that Bayesian opinion leads to two qualitatively
different dynamics. When the agents’ estimates of the group’s opinion, i.e., the
estimation of the fraction of agents that would buy, are heterogenous, the stationary
distribution of opinions is peaked around 50%: half of the agents would buy and
the other half would sell. However, when the same estimate is homogenous, the
interaction among agents leads to a stationary distribution with two peaks: most
agents would buy and a few would sell, or most agents would sell and a few would
buy. These situations can be interpreted as bubble and crash states, respectively.
Lux [21] sets up a framework with two kinds of agents: speculative traders
and fundamentalists. Speculative traders form their decisions based on the opinion
about other traders of their kind, as well as on price dynamics (momentum).
Fundamentalists buy or sell based on the difference between the asset’s market
and fundamental values. The interaction between the Ising-like speculative traders
and fundamentalists gives rise to a rich phenomenology of price dynamics, with
prices moving around an equilibrium as well as boom and bust cycles, depending
on different parameters. This shows that simple mechanisms are enough to generate
a variety of dynamical regimes.
Contrary to the previous works, where every agent was interacting with every
other, Cont and Bouchaud [9] impose a random graph topology on how the agents
interact. A random graph is a network where an agent has a probability c=N to be
connected to another agent, N being the total number of agents and c the average
number of connections of per agent. In their setup, the authors propose that every
agent of a component, i.e., the set of agents connected through a path, would take
the same action of buying, selling or staying out of the market. The components
could be thought of as organizations such as hedge funds, individual traders, etc.
The main result of the paper is that for 0 < c < 1, the fat-tails of the distribution
of returns can be recovered. The case c D 1 corresponds to a critical value where a
giant component emerges, encompassing a ﬁnite fraction of the system. This can be
interpreted as a bubble or a crash, since the giant component contains agents with
the same action.
Although nearly all of the models described so far offer an explanation as to what
mechanisms could be at the origin of the formation of bubbles, they suffer from a
major limitation: either they cannot be calibrated to real data and as such are not
testable, or they lack any predictive power. Hence, among the different types of the
bubble models that we have described above, the model that can be related to the
model developed in this thesis is Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model. We are
going to give a comparison between the LPPL model and Conic Finance model (or
Illiquidity Premium model) in the subsequent section.

114
7
Illiquidity Premium and Connection with Financial Bubbles
7.4
Log-Periodic Power Law Model vs. Illiquidity Premium
The major model that distinguishes itself by proposing a functional form for the
price dynamics up to the crash is the LPPL model and was ﬁrst suggested by
Sornette et al. [37]; it was later formalized by Johansen et al. [17]. LPPL model
is constructed on the behavioral and well-documented phenomenon of positive
feedback between demand and price, i.e., the fact that an increase in price leads
to an increased demand in speculative periods, which itself leads to an increase in
price. Translating the positive feedback mechanism into mathematical terms, one
can show that the price dynamics obeys a super-exponential law with a ﬁnite-time
singularity, beyond which the solution does not exist. This ﬁnite-time singularity
can be interpreted as the time of the crash. In addition, imposing a hierarchical
topology on the networks of traders leads to the super-exponential price dynamics,
being characterized by log-periodic oscillations of decreasing amplitude. Other
explanations for the log-periodic oscillations include the rivalry within nonlinear
trend followers and nonlinear value investors [16].
The LPPL model was expanded to interpret the dynamics of ﬁnancial markets
during bubbles and crashes. Similar to the agent-based model it is assumed that
there are rational traders and noise traders who display herding behavior that can
destabilize the asset price [12]. Employing the LPPL approach, Sornette et al. [37]
have analyzed the stock market bubbles and crashes at the macroeconomic and
microeconomic levels. From a macroeconomic perspective, the model presumes
that we are dealing with rational markets which have incomplete information. In this
kind of market, the trade price will reﬂects both the fundamental value and also the
future expectations associated with the proﬁtability and risk. From a microeconomic
perspective, the Sornette-Johansen model considers that investors, both rational
investors and noisy traders, are connected narrowly through the networks that
govern their anticipations regarding market earnings. Moreover, trade choices rely
upon the choices of other members of the network, but may also consist of external
inﬂuences.
One of main disadvantage of LPPL model is that it can not differentiate between
several sources of price growth as described below:
•
Possibility that the prices are high and keep increasing as investors expect
high future earnings growth. This growth could be related to a shift in the
economic structure and the way economic gains are divided between companies
and employees, or between retaining earnings and dividend payments.
•
Possibility that there could be a bubble in the sense that prices are high today,
simple because investors anticipate future prices to be even higher, without taking
into account the fundamentals.
•
Possibility that bubbles and crashes can be formed by ﬂuctuations in investors’
risk premia. Sudden rises in prices can be result of the investors suddenly
becoming more risk tolerant and requiring a lower expected return for the asset.
Contrary, as risk premia suddenly change its course, markets can experience
crashes. Prices in accordance with this theory are always rational, and reﬂect

7.4
Log-Periodic Power Law Model vs. Illiquidity Premium
115
investors’ stand towards risk. One might see a sharp increase in asset prices, but
one should not clarify this as inconsistent with the fundamentals [30].
Another disadvantage of the LPPL model is that for pre-crash bubbles on stock
markets the LPPL model [17] require the expected prices to be non-decreasing
during the whole bubble period (as recognized by Sornette and Zhou [36]). In
the same study, it was described that the LPPL model ﬁtted to the price process
decreases at some point during the bubble.
Moreover, estimating LPPL models in general never was an easy task, as there
are numerous local minimum of the price function where the minimization method
can get trapped.
However, in a series of papers, Madan, Cherny and their co-authors developed a
new method which succeeded to overcome the shortcomings of the aforementioned
traditional approach.
Conic Finance is a new way to price ﬁnancial assets; it combines No-Arbitrage
theory and Expected Utility theory. The level of acceptability is very important
in Conic Finance, because it helps market-makers to set good bid and ask prices.
In general, this theory is very helpful for investors and portfolio optimizers to
distinguish between different investment opportunities. It disregards the law of one-
price by incorporating the bid and ask prices. Moreover, by being established on the
basis of two principles, namely, Acceptability and Distorted Expectations, Conic
Finance theory is deeply connected with liquidity effects and risk behavior within
ﬁnancial markets.
We can empirically characterize bubbles as periods in which illiquidity premium
experiences explosive dynamics, and produce statistical tools to discover and time-
stamp the existence of such a behavior.
When applied to historical bid and ask prices of the European options written
on the S&P 500 index, the method classiﬁes ﬁve cases where bid and ask prices
deviated from fundamentals and in which there were elevated levels of uncertainty
in the market between the start of the 2008 and end of 2010.
Subsequently, we summarized the advantages of an Illiquidity Premium
model:
•
An Illiquidity Premium model does not require to differentiate between the
different sources, different types of price growth.
•
An Illiquidity Premium model determines a real-time tool for identiﬁcation of
the bubbles. To decide whether an asset is in the state of a bubble or not, only
current and past information is necessary and there is no look-ahead bias.
•
An Illiquidity Premium model has no constrains on prices to be increasing
throughout the bubble.
•
Instead of providing an answer to the question of if there is a bubbles in asset
prices, Illiquidity Premium model speciﬁes a live-dating algorithm in order to
identify when bubble end, which can be beneﬁcial to the stock market investors.
•
An Illiquidity Premium model quantiﬁes the bubble state of an asset through its
price dynamics, without resorting to the determination of a fundamental value.

116

Illiquidity Premium and Connection with Financial Bubbles
•
The increase in the illiquidity premium in this model leads to a critical point that
characterizes the beginning of the market crash.
Yet these models have never been compared to each other in a statistical meaning.
The major reason is that the data used in LPPL model are the stock prices, or S&P
500 index prices, but the data that is used in the Illiquidity Premium model are the
bid and ask prices of the European options.
7.5
Investment Management and Illiquidity Premium
This chapter has deﬁned a new mathematical approach for detecting the termination
of bubbles in real-time. The technique does not have the disadvantages of traditional
methods, and demonstrates that bubbles and consequent price increases of the
market are a frequent characteristics of stock market.
For investors and investment managers, being able to determine periods when
asset prices are in a bubble state in real-time and when this bubble bursts has crucial
implications for portfolio optimization and hedging. Moreover, correctly determin-
ing the periods of enormous exuberance and panic is valuable for measuring how
different strategies function in these episodes with respect to more calm periods of
market behavior.
We choose as default strategy for non-bubble times that the investors are rational
in the current model, i.e., investing a ﬁxed percentage in the risky asset. An investor
will consider that an economy is experiencing economic uncertainty or, particularly,
a ﬁnancial bubble as soon as the illiquidity premium of the bid and ask prices
derived from the model in consecutive time windows will yield increasing results.
If investors detect this signal, i.e., increased illiquidity premium, they decrease their
investment in the risky asset to 0% of their wealth to limit the loss arising from the
bubble bursts. As soon as the signal is not picked up anymore, i.e., the illiquidity
premium is gradually decreasing or is stable, investors will have to reevaluate their
strategy and revert to their previous behavior of investing a ﬁxed percentage of their
wealth in the risky asset.

Conclusion and Future Outlook
In our thesis, we present a new measure to account for the differences between the
bid and ask prices of the ﬁnancial instruments and an early-warning signaling for
ﬁnancial bubbles by beneﬁting from Conic Finance theory, modern optimization
techniques and well-chosen numerical methods. For the time being, we consider the
U.S. derivative markets since bubbles, mostly, occurred in these markets. Yet, we
intend to extend our work for further countries’ markets and also for other types of
assets, such as gold and oil markets.
Conic Finance is a new way to price ﬁnancial assets: it combines the No-
Arbitrage theory and Expected Utility theory. The level of acceptability is very
important in Conic Finance, because it helps market-makers to set good bid and ask
prices. In general this theory is very helpful for investors and portfolio optimizers
to distinguish between different investment opportunities. It disregards the law of
one-price by incorporating the bid and ask prices. Moreover, by being established
on the basis of two principles, namely, Acceptability and Distorted Expectations,
Conic Finance theory is deeply connected with liquidity effects and risk behavior
within ﬁnancial markets.
In markets of the ﬁnancial sector, liquidity is a core criterion. It mirrors the asset’s
capability to be bought or sold without a signiﬁcant change in the price and with a
lowest loss in value. Liquidity is closely associated with bid-ask spreads: highly
liquid products have narrow spreads; illiquid assets have a wide spread. During
ﬁnancial shocks, liquidity is sometimes said to evaporate. Therefore, it is increasing
the bid and ask prices of ﬁnancial securities. Financial bubbles can be interpreted as
distorted expectations of investors; hence, we can beneﬁt from Conic Finance theory
in order to recognize and identify the stock market bubbles as early as possible.
In this thesis, in line with the numerical calculation of the illiquidity premium, we
presented a new approach to identify stock market bubbles by beneﬁting from Conic
Finance theory, and illiquidity premium was understood to be a kind of indicator to
detect bubbles.

Conclusion and Future Outlook
In this thesis we deal with the 2008 Subprime Crisis in equity markets, by
analyzing the derivative markets and the movement of the acceptability index of
European options written on the S&P 500 index during that ﬁnancial crisis, from
2008 and December 2010.
In order to calculate the illiquidity premium we ﬁrstly employ the Black-Scholes
Model and extend it so that it will include our implied liquidity parameter. By this
way we derive the bid and ask prices of the European put and call options. The
second model that we use is the Kou model. This model have been chosen as it
better represents the movements in the stock markets. In this case, by using the
Inversion formula for densities, Residue Theorem from Complex Analysis, Taylor
Series Expansion and from Theory of Inverse Problems we also derive the bid
and ask prices of the European call and put prices that incorporate the illiquidity
premium.
Moreover, in order to monitor the market movements closely, weekly and
monthly sliding windows have been used. As a result, we observed a sharply
increasing process in illiquidity premium obtained from the derivatives market,
when the bubble-burst time approaches. Moreover, the increase in the illiquidity
premium for other periods, like ﬁnancial trouble of Chrysler and General Motors or
European debt crisis, etc., is lower than the increase which we have calculated for
the ﬁnancial crisis and its bubble-burst time.
Conic Finance theory is a very new ﬁeld in the ﬁnance literature and its
applications have begun very recently. One of the various scientiﬁc contributions
of this thesis is the introduction of an early-warning method for bubbles, for the ﬁrst
time by using derivative markets as an application ﬁeld of Conic Finance theory
which is a very new ﬁeld in the literature. In this regards, we can empirically
characterize bubbles as periods in which the illiquidity premium experiences
explosive dynamics, and produce statistical tools to discover and time-stamp the
existence of such a behavior.
We are going to extend our work to derivatives contracts which are written on
other countries’ stock markets and also to other types of assets such as gold and
petrol markets. This thesis analyzes the derivatives market’s illiquidity based on
daily data; it would also be very challenging and interesting to take a look at how
illiquidity premiums will behave with respect to higher frequency data, for instance,
at a trade-by-trade frequency. What is more, we shall address ﬁnancial dynamics
beyond the use of geometric Brownian motion or Kou Model and investigate the
application of more advanced processes in the calculation of implied liquidity or
illiquidity premium. Moreover, we are going to apply a more complex approach
for the window-size determination by using adaptive windows whose sizes change
with time depending on some properties of the underlying assets or the entire
economy. This will offer a possible compromise between the two conﬂicting criteria,
namely, accurately capturing the variation of the signals and accurately comparing
disparity of the signals at corresponding points, for selecting the windows’ lengths.

Conclusion and Future Outlook
121
Eventually, we aim at practical tools and a Graphical User Interface for the analyst,
manager and decision maker, related with our computational and probabilistic
methods on the detection, early warning of ﬁnancial bubbles and further problems
of liquidity. In addition, we will be working on a more detailed investment portfolio
management strategy that will use illiquidity premium as a signal to change the
combination of different investments.

Some Distributions Under Wang Transform
Assume that the function ‰ is the Wang transform, then it will have the following
formula:
‰ .u/ D ˆ.ˆ1 .u/ C /; u 2 Œ0; 1 ;   0;
(A.1)
where ˆ is the standard normal distribution function.
Wang transform of the normal and lognormal distributions are also normal and
lognormal distributions are preserved:
•
If F has a normal.; 2/ distribution, ‰ .F/ is also a normal distribution with
 D   
 and  D ,
•
If F has a lognormal.; 2/ distribution such that ln.X/  normal.; 2/,
‰ .F/ is another lognormal distribution with  D   
 and  D .
Let us prove this statement for the case of the lognormal distribution (the case
when F has a normal distribution can be easily deducted).
If F has a lognormal.; 2/ distribution, then it means that F

Ask Price
By using Eq. (4.3) and also the transformations that we used in the process of
calculation of bid and ask prices of the European call option we will derive the
ask price of the European put option as follows:
