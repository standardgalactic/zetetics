TWO DIFFERENT RARE EVENTS OCCURRING
SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE HOUSE MOUSE

IN an inbred line in which Caracul (Ca, linkage group VI) had been
segregating as a backcross for eight generations, there appeared two
males which, from their breeding behaviour, were apparently homo-
zygous for this factor. They were members of the same litter, the
first produced by their parents. The latter bred seven Caraculs and
four normals in three litters, in good agreement with the expected
i ratio. The anomalous males (Io/13o.37oc and Io/13o.37od)
were given several unrelated does besides their first mates from the
inbred line, and bred consistently by all of them as homozygous
Caraculs, producing no normals out of over two hundred progeny. A
summary of these arid other relevant data is given in the table.
There is no possibility of mistaken identity. The inbred line
segregates in six factors (ca, belted, bt, misty, m, brown, b, silver,
si, and Fused, Fu), which are not found in this combination elsewhere
in this laboratory. The anomalous males' phenotypes and breeding
performance were such that they could only have come from this
line, and their parents bred as expected for all six factors.
Neither does it seem likely that Ca was segregating in an unusual
fashion in this line or that any other waving factor was present. The
eight previous generations produced severally and in the aggregate
ratios of Caracul to normal none of which differed significantly from
the expected x : i, and three sibs of the anomalous males, mated to
normals, also produced good i
i ratios.
An explanation which at first appears plausible is that the "non-
Caracul" parent of the males in question was in fact Caracul. If
so, the mating producing them would have been an intercross for
Caracul, and the production of two homozygous males out of eleven
offspring would not have been surprising. Certainly the ratio seven
Caraculs to four normals is not significantly different from 3 : I.
However, the "non-Caracul" parent was scrupulously examined and
no trace of curly hair was found. Unfortunately it died before any
specific tests of its genotype could be made. But the records showed
that it had been outcrossed to an unrelated non-wavy female in a
test for another factor. Three young had been classified for waviness
and appeared normal. Five others had been killed at five days old
but had not been specifically classified for wavy. However, if they
had had wavy whiskers this would probably have been noticed. Thus
this mating probably produced no wavies out of eight progeny, a result

which, had the "non-Caracul" actually been a Caracul, could only
have occurred by chance with a probability of i in 256.
It must therefore be concluded that an unusual genetic situation
has occurred.

The following explanation appears, at first, to be sufficient
A mutation may have occurred in the production of chromosome
VI in two of the gametes from the non-Ca parent. These mutant
gametes may have carried either Caracul, or another dominant
curling factor, here given the symbol "K", closely linked to Ca.
However, on further inspection of the data, it is apparent that a
mutational explanation suffices for only one anomalous male's perform-
ance. For as regards the bt locus, the two males bred very differently
(see table).
370d produced eight belted offspring by its related
btbt mate, thereby demonstrating that it possessed a bt chromosome
from the btbt parent in which the Ca or K mutation is supposed to
have occurred. But its sib 370c, by a similar mate, produced only
two belted offspring out of twenty-two classified for this factor, a
very poor fit to the half expected. Moreover, the belt of one of these

offspring was poorly expressed and the bearer could be construed
as a heterozygote. There is no record of the appearance of the belt
of the second offspring, but heterozygous penetrance of bt is sufficiently
common for one to conjecture that this mouse was a heterozygote
also.
If, then, it may be said that 370C produced no homozygous
belteds out of twenty-two, it is not clear what happened to the bE
chromosome this mouse should have received from its btbt father.
If a mutational explanation is to be used, one must suppose that two
mutations occurred simultaneously in this chromosome, one from
normal to Ca and one from bt to normal.
An explanation for 37oC which requires no mutations at all is
as follows.
The 370C zygote may never have received the +bt chromosome from
its father, and the Ca + one from its mother may have been doubled
or it may have lost the +bt chromosome at some time during the
early mitotic divisions. Or, if the two apparently belted offspring
which 37oc produced were actually homozygotes, one may say that
the
chromosome was not lost, but that it contained some defect
which either tended to prevent it from reaching the gametes of 37oc
or tended to prevent those gametes containing it from reaching the
ova of the btbt mate. The two bt gametes which did fertilise these
ova must then have been Ca bt, that is, crossovers. (This supposition
is consistent with the known Ca-bE value for males, ii
per cent.,
Mallyon, 1951). This suggests that the defect was carried in the
segment between the Ca and bt loci. Since the bt received by the
sib 37od apparently segregated normally, one may suppose that the
btbt father was at worst heterozygous for the defect. It is conceivable
that the same agent was responsible for the mutation to Ca or K
in one chromosome of the btbt mouse and for the defect in the
other.
To sum up, the anomalous facts are as follows. Two Ca males
from a coupling backcross of Ca and bi produced nothing but Ca
offspring. One male, mated in a backcross, segregated I : i in normal
and belted, while the other, similarly mated, gave only two doubtful
belteds out of twenty-two classified. These, and the explanations
discussed here, may be graphically represented as follows
