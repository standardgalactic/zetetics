Introduction 
. 'VTHAT WAS THE FIRST idea? Was it formed by an early human-like 
W figure, poised with stone in hand, calculating how to fell his prey? 
Certainly, an intriguing question, but there is an even more important 
one. How and when did the capacity to create an idea come about in the 
first place? This question has perplexed ancient and modern philosophers, 
scientists in the fields of human development and evolution, and most of 
the rest of us. How do human beings develop their highest mental abili­
ties, the abilities to symbolize and think? And how did these distinctly hu­
man abilities arise during the course of evolution? In short, how did we 
become human beings and how do we maintain our humanness? 
We have developed a new hypothesis to address these questions. The 
key to the evolutionary hypothesis we will present in this book comes 
from our observations of babies at the beginning of their developmental 
journey. We have found that the capacity to create symbols and to think 
stems from what was often thought of by philosophers as the "enemy" of 
reason and logic: our passions or emotions. While there is mounting 
evidence that emotions influence the content of our thoughts (see Chap­
ter 1 1), we have discovered a far more important role for our emotions. 
We will show how emotions actually give birth to our very ability to cre­
ate symbols and to think. 
However, a very special characteristic of our emotions paves the path 
to symbols. This characteristic is relatively different in human beings 
than in other animals. We have observed that it is the capacity to trans­
form basic emotions into a series of successively more complex interac-
tive emotional signals. We will show how emotional signaling enables a

Introduction 
child to separate perceptions from fixed predictable actions and, in so 
doing, free up these perceptions to acquire emotional meaning and be­
come symbols. Something as profound as mastering the word "mommy," 
or something as basic as the word "apple" or the number "4," comes into 
being through six initial levels of emotional interaction and signaling 
in the early years of life. Sensory and subjective experiences, seemingly 
the enemy of reason and logic, through progressive transformations, 
therefore, actually become the basis for both creative and logical reflec­
tive thought. 
These uniquely human abilities are not hardwired into our brains. 
They must be developed through learning interactions. Humans inten­
sify these types of critical learning processes in the second half of the 
first year of life and during most of the second year and then continue it 
throughout their lifetimes. These learning interactions are not instruc­
tional, where an adult lectures, shows, or otherwise directly teaches a 
child. They are natural interactions that result in new learning, such as 
playful back-and-forth smiles or vocalizations between an infant and 
caregiver from which the infant learns about relating and interacting. 
When we use the term "learning," we will be using it in this way, even 
though at times this type of learning will also involve interactions where 
a child imitates or copies the adult or another child. 
Through our studies of nonhuman primates and a review of the fossil 
record, we will also demonstrate that what takes a human baby two 
years to learn took our human ancestors millions of years. Remarkably, 
however, we can trace the same steps in both. 
Based on these studies, we have formulated a hypothesis about the evo­
lution of symbols, reflective thinking, and language skills that challenges 
the prevailing theory. The prevailing theory asserts that, during the course 
of evolution, change occurred predominately through changes in genetic 
structure-through the processes of natural selection, genetic mutation, 
and random genetic drift. Although modern evolutionary theorists will 
stress thanhis process of genetic change was ruled by chance and contin­
gency due to unpredictable environmental events, the basic notion per­
sists that evolutionary change came about predominantly through 
changes in our genes. The genetic changes that were associated with 
greater adaptation tended to persist. 
We will show, however, that the prevailing theory is incorrect. The 
origins of symbolic thinking and speaking depend heavily on the social

but were passed down and thus learned anew by each generation in the 
evolutionary history of humans: a history that extends far back beyond 
the appearance of anatomically modern humans, to the early humans, 
the Australopithecines, and even beyond. These cultural practices are 
necessary for each generation to master the stages of emotional signaling 
that lead to symbol formation and reflective thinking. They, therefore, 
constitute an essential element in the growth of the human mind and 
human society, and, indeed, in the ongoing development of human 
minds and human societies. 
Ever since the pioneering work of Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson, 
evolutionary theorists have become increasingly interested in the role of 
cultural and social factors in human evolution.l Indeed, there has been a 
growing interest in recent years in the so-called Baldwin Effect,2 accord­
ing to which learned behaviors operate in much the same way as envi­
ronmental challenges in classical evolutionary theory, insofar as those 
individuals who favor that learned behavior are selected (either through 
mutations or by tapping into pre-existing capacities). But in this theory, 
the learned behavior is ultimately passed on through the genes, not 
through new learning in each generation. 
In the majority of cases where theorists have begun seriously to ex­
plore the role of culture and society in the evolution of the human 
mind, therefore, the primacy of the genetic perspective persists.3 For 
these arguments remain wedded to what Susan Oyama describes as a 
doctrine that assumes that the effects of the cultural and social environ­
ment are passed on to descendants through the genetic structure.4 The 
basic principle thus remains that human beings developed-and de­
velop-the capacities to reason, speak, see one another as intentional 
agents, live in complex rule-governed societies, and so on, because spe­
cific genes for each of these abilities were naturally selected. 
The strongest challenge to this determinist form of reasoning has 
come from behavioral scientists who tend to take into account an entire 
dynamic system rather than to isolate single factors. Because the multi­
ple environments that genes interact with have endless degrees of varia­
tion, the developmental outcome of traits or behaviors can be influenced 
in a near infinite number of ways) According to this way of thinking, 
evolutionary change involves changes in the developmental system.6 
Therefore, attempts to attribute this or that percent of influence to ge­
netic or environmental factors when looking at intelligence or different 
types of temperament are not only fruitless, they're inaccurate. Nature

Introduction 
and nurture are constantly influencing one another, much like Fred As­
taire and Ginger Rogers during one of their memorable dances. 
Understanding the dance between nature and nurture (genes and en­
vironment) requires more than assertion and vivid metaphor, however 
compelling. It requires a careful analysis of how each partner actually in­
teracts with or influences the other. For example, Gilbert Gottlieb 
showed that wood ducklings could only learn the calls of their species if 
they heard them from their parents or siblings as hatchlings before they 
were hatched.? Nobel prize winning neuroscientist Eric Kandel showed 
how learning experiences influence regulatory genes, which in turn, in­
fluence biological processes involved in the formation of neural path­
ways that make long-term memory possible.8 
How does environmental variability interact with genetic variability 
in the development of a range of human capacities? For some capacities, 
the genetic structure may set the constraints and environmental experi­
ences may operate more like a switch-turning on or off certain "regu­
lator" genes, which in turn, influence gene expression and behavior. For 
other capacities, however, environmental variability and learning may 
play a far more complex role, be far more influential than thought, and 
be a necessary condition for these capacities to develop. We believe this 
is especially true for our highest level human capacities, such as sym­
bolic thinking. For example, we have worked with infants who were 
born with motor and sensory differences, such as low muscle tone and 
underreactivity to touch and sound. With one type of environment, 
they have a high probability of becoming self-absorbed and evidencing 
severe language, social, and cognitive deficits. With another type of en­
vironment, one that is geared to their particular physical traits (i.e., we 
construct a "key" to fit and open their "lock"), we have been able to help 
many of them master the stages of emotional signaling and become en­
gaged, interactive, and symbolic, with high levels of social, verbal, re­
flective, and empathetic capacities.9 
As indicated, in this model, basic biological capacities are a "neces­
sary" but not a "sufficient condition" for an individual learning to con­
struct symbols and to think. That is, our biological potential for learning 
from experience, which includes our rudimentary capacities to perceive, 
organize, and respond, is the critical substrate for the capacity to learn. 
The sufficient condition, however, involves a series of learning steps that 
are the basis for symbolic thinking. In human beings, however, even the

These include the ability to attend, interact with others, engage in emo­
tional and social signaling, construct complex patterns, organize infor­
mation symbolically, and use symbols to think. These "tools" enable us 
to develop knowledge, wisdom, and empathy. They are also the means 
for effective protection, security, and social and political organizations. 
We were able to search for those stable learning processes that have 
been passed on throughout human evolution by making a critical dis­
tinction between two types of cultural and learning processes: There are 
those that originated millions of years ago and have been passed on 
through learning from one generation to the next over the evolutionary 
time period and are therefore quite permanent and near universal in hu­
man groups (i.e., the capacities to attend, relate, signal with emotions, 
etc.). There are also those that are determined by variations in each indi-
. vidual and time period, that is, they express the near infinite variations 
of human groups (i.e., the specific ways a person attends, relates, and 
signals with emotions, for example, signaling pleasure, but not anger). 
The former involve basic learning processes and the latter embrace indi­
vidual content and behavior stemming from these processes. 
Once we could identify these processes in our research on the devel­
opment of human infants and nonhuman primates and the fossil record, 
we were able to see how the critical learning steps leading to symbolic 
thinking were embedded in our cultural learning processes and not in 
the structure of our genes (as important as these were and are as the nec­
essary foundations for learning). In the chapters that follow we will 
identify and describe the critical and culturally mediated learning pro­
cesses that have made us human and have the potential to continue our 
mental growth. 
We will show that this theory can answer the three fundamental 
questions about the evolution of human beings that challenge current 
evolutionary theory: 
1. What are the factors that promoted the growth of the human mind? 
2. What is the relationship between these factors and the processes that en­
able a child to develop the higher-level reflective capacities that charac­
terize our species? 
3. 
How do these factors relate to the origins of human society? 
To be precise, we will show that the same processes we describe in 
Chapters 1 and 2 that lead to creative and reflective thinking in children

Introduction 
were at work over millions of years during human and even prehuman 
evolution. In fact, we will show that the cultural diffusion of these pro­
cesses of emotional interaction throughout our evolutionary history 
constituted the primary engine for the development of our highest 
mental capacities. 
In particular, in what follows we will show how 
• 
certain cultural practices are absolutely necessary for the development of 
higher-level symbolic and reflective skills, and that without these prac­
tices humans cannot develop the species-typical skills that distinguish 
our speCIes; 
• 
these cultural practices are a necessary factor in the evolution of symbolic 
and reflective thinking; 
• 
the cultural practices we are discussing date back to prehistoric times 
and were likely shared at the outset with the nonhuman species that 
preceded us; 
• 
certain basic practices are also present in nonhuman primates; 
• 
these cultural practices are not self-sustaining nor inherited but passed 
on only through social learning in each new generation; 
• 
this critical social learning progressed in a specific manner from one gen­
eration to the next over millions of years through different species until 
each of the stages of emotional and intellectual development (to be de­
scribed in Chapter 2) was mastered; and 
• 
the fossil record, as well as an examination of the behavior and interac­
tion patterns of nonhuman primates, will be shown to support this new 
theory. 
This type of culturally transmitted learning may have been especially 
important for the evolution of flexible problem solving that uses complex 
communicative and symbolic processes because these processes needed to 
be sensitive to changing environments and, therefore, could not be struc­
tured into fixed biological pathways as could simpler patterns. 
Many evolutionary psychologists believe not only that human intelli­
gence evolved through genetic changes but that the brains of modern hu­
mans have remained the same since the time modern humans first 
appeared. Others believe that human brains have remained the same for 
at least the last 30,000 to 50,000 years (since the time cave drawings and 
new tools emerged). Contrary to this assumption, we will consider evi-
Introduction 
7 
dence suggesting that during this time the very structure of the human 
brain has changed. For to the degree that new generations had access to 
culturally mediated early interactions that were more "enriched" than 
those of previous generations, there were opportunities for the brain to 
develop new pathways. For example, on brain imaging studies musicians 
have been shown to have more neuronal connections in the area of the 
brain that regulates the hand movements involved in their musical per­
formance. In Chapter 10, we will present the mounting evidence for a 
relationship between experience-based learning, including the role of en­
vironmentally sensitive regulator genes that turn other genes on and off, 
and the growth of neuronal pathways in the brain. These enriched, or 
improved, formative learning interactions likely led to new neuronal 
pathways. In Chapters 1 and 2, we will discuss how our highest level 
_.mental capacities, such as reflective thinking, only develop fully when in­
fants and children are engaged in certain types of nurturing learning 
interactions. Children who are deprived of critical early nurturing learn­
ing interactions tend to have a variety of problems in the development of 
their social, language, and thinking capacities. But, as indicated, the pre­
dominant way these pathways that require learning and development are 
transferred from one generation to another is through the continuation 
of culturally mediated learning interactions. 
We will also show that a current view of the way in which the brain 
organizes emotions, advocated by neuroscientists such as Joseph 
leDoux, is incorrect. This view, which sees emotions as .states of mind 
that are somewhat separate from and compete with or influence logical 
thinking, is not consistent with our clinical observations of growing in­
fants and children. In fact, we will show that this view is based on confu­
sion over the difference between pathological and healthy emotional 
development. In pathological development, the systems that organize 
emotions and logical thinking may remain separate. In healthy develop­
ment, these systems become fully integrated and catastrophic emotions, 
such as rage, become transformed. Emotional signaling will be seen to 
provide the missing link between the level of the brain that involves basic 
emotional circuitry (subsymbolic systems, such as the amygdala) and its 
highest cortical symbolic capacities. 
Similarly, we will show, contrary to the views of Chomsky and Pinker 
on the genetic origins of language, that language and cognition are embed­
ded in the emotional processes that, in our hypothesis, led to symbols.

Introduction 
We will also show that while Piaget and his followers made pioneer­
ing contributions in formulating the way a child acts on his world to 
learn to think, they were not able to figure out the mechanism through 
which symbol formation and thinking occurs. Piaget described stages 
involved in thinking and discussed emotionally meaningful behaviors, 
such as imaginative play. However, he viewed emotions as more of a sec­
ondary phenomenon, useful for motivation and, at times, guided by a 
child's reasoning abilities. He and his followers, however, did not realize 
that emotions and their transformation into various levels of emotional 
signaling and mental representation were a critical mechanism in the 
development of thinking and that at each level of thinking, emotions 
lead the way to higher levels of thinking. For example, an infant learns 
causality through his experience of his smiles leading to his caregivers' 
smiles months before he learns to pull a string to ring a bell (which Pi­
aget believed was the beginning of causal thinking). 
Our work with children with autism (discussed in Chapter 11) and 
other developmental and emotional challenges provides supportive evi­
dence for our developmental, evolutionary model of how symbols are 
formed. In general, we observe problems when critical emotional inter­
actions are not available, because of either biological or environmental 
challenges. This is seen in autism (biological) or deprivation of nurtur­
ing care in orphanages and multiproblem families, and in experiments 
with nonhuman primates (environmental), where there are often severe 
limitations in emotional development, and, in humans, in the capacity 
for symbolic thinking. In children with autism, biological factors, which 
vary in pattern and degree from child to child, undermine their capacity 
to master the stages of emotional signaling that we believe are important 
for symbol formation. If our theory is correct, helping some of these 
children find another pathway to master the stages of emotional signal­
ing should enable them to create symbols and think. We have found that 
a subgroup of these children (where the biological limitations afforded 
more flexibility) verified this prediction. In fact, their symbolic thinking 
capacities were proportional to the degree to which they mastered the 
different stages of emotional signaling. As we will show, children in this 
subgroup developed the capacity to engage, read, and respond to affect 
signals, empathize with the feelings of others, form symbols, and think 
reflectively to a degree formerly thought unattainable in children with 
autistic spectrum disorders.

Another part of the evolutionary puzzle is how early humans learned 
to live and work in families and groups and build complex cultures and 
societies. The concept of natural selection and survival of the fittest has 
tended to emphasize competition among individuals for the survival of 
their genes. Unfortunately, since Hobbes, it's been widely accepted that 
the basis of social and political discourse and organization is language, 
which is assumed, for the most part, to be genetically mediated. 
In contrast, we will show that the growth of complex cultures and so­
cieties and human survival itself depends on the capacities for intimacy, 
empathy, reflective thinking, and a shared sense of humanity and reality. 
These are derived from the same formative emotional processes that 
lead to symbol formation. They enable human beings to work together 
in larger and larger groups. Ironically, even successful competition, be-
_. yond the brute force level, depends on cooperative group functioning 
with a high degree of mutual empathy and trust. 
We will trace the growth of these social capacities through nonhuman 
primates and early human cultures. Then we will show that understand­
ing the types of early emotional processes that lead to symbols can con­
tribute to understanding the developmental levels of different cultural 
and social groups. This understanding provides a new "lens" to observe 
both the near-infinite cultural variations and the remarkably stable pat­
terns that have characterized social groups since their inception. The af­
fective processes that orchestrate individual intelligence connect the 
individual to the social group and characterize the way in which the group 
functions. The levels of functioning of the social group, therefore, will be 
seen to be an extension of the intelligence of individuals and a continua­
tion of the evolution of intelligence. 
Although most students of human behavior now focus on the inter­
action between nature and nurture, nonetheless, as indicated earlier, 
there is an overemphasis on the role of genes and an underemphasis on 
the role of culture (except as made possible by genes) in the formation 
of high-level thinking and social capacities. Perhaps there is comfort in 
assuming that biology, rather than families, communities, and culture, 
is responsible for and protects our highest mental abilities. Do we some­
how feel that biology can preserve our humanity better than learned, 
culturally mediated processes? Perhaps so! If we believe in "fixed biol­
ogy" over "experience," we can falsely believe that only these severe 
mental illnesses, which are characterized by biological aberrations that

Introduction 
affect a small percent of the population, can derail these processes and 
ignore far more common changes in family structure, international rela­
tionships, culture, and the environment that threaten the foundations 
of our humanity and intelligence. 
The evolutionary forces that equipped the human baby with the po­
tential to learn made that same baby dependent on a learning environ­
ment of emotional, social, and cultural experiences for subsequent 
development. Remarkably, over millions of years, these basic, learned, 
culturally transferred processes keep improving and building on one an­
other (at least until now). In Part II, as we trace the "line" of human evo­
lution from prehuman ancestors and many species of nonhuman 
primates to modern humans, we will show how each new species and 
group reached higher levels of these core basic processes. 
What are these vital learning processes that carry the building blocks 
of culture and intelligence from one generation to the next? In Chapters 
1 and 2, we will identify these stages. They are more basic than the com­
monly assumed building blocks, such as language, new tools, or symbol 
use in its own right, and underlie the mechanisms of observing, imitat­
ing, and practicing that are commonly assumed to be hardwired. We will 
show that rather than being hardwired, basic tools, such as social imita­
tion, are themselves learned through earlier emotional interactions. 
One reason we assume that our highest human capacities are biologi­
cal is that, when we look around, many people appear to have at least 
some degree of them. Most people relate, interact, think, and solve prob­
lems. Yet, as we will show, the reason these processes can be found in so 
many peoples, cultures, and geographical areas across long stretches of 
human history is that similar culturally mediated learning practices be­
gan in our prehistory and, therefore, characterize many cultures, settings, 
and historical periods. 
Similarly, the ability of individuals from across the globe to arrive at an 
implicit consensus on certain basic elements of reality, in spite of near­
infinite cultural variations, emerges in part from these basic shared inter­
active processes and experiences that originated millions of years ago. 
Therefore, although our common DNA creates a potential for learn­
ing in helpless newborns and the potential for progression, it is our 
common ancestor's behavior and cultural patterns that set in motion the 
development of practices that influence the way newborns of non­
human primates and human primates are nurtured and master the fun­

Introduction 
1 1  
Before we conclude this introduction, we should like to provide a 
glimpse of the evidence for our hypothesis that a common set of cultural 
ancestors and interactive emotional patterns led to symbol formation. 
Consider two babies engaging with adults. Nathan, a one-year-old, is 
sitting on the floor, playing idly with his toes, when Sue walks in. The 
moment Nathan sees her his face lights up, to which Sue responds with 
a broad smile. Nathan giggles and waves his arms slightly as if beckon­
ing Sue to join him. She sits down on the floor and, laughing, asks, 
"What are you doing with your toes?" When she tickles his toes, 
Nathan pulls his feet away sharply, laughing as he does so, his big smile 
extending from the corners of his mouth all the way up to his eyes. Her 
eyes sparkling, Sue asks in a gentle voice: "Can I please see your toes? I 
promise not to tickle them." With a wary look on his face, Nathan 
_ "  slowly extends his right foot, and, just as Sue starts to lean forward, he 
pulls his foot away and breaks out into a full-bellied laugh. Sue reacts 
with a crestfallen look on her face and hangs her head slightly, to which 
Nathan responds by edging closer and slowly extending his foot again. 
Sue keeps her eyes on the ground and then suddenly darts forward and 
starts tickling Nathan's toes, laughing loudly. For an instant Nathan 
looks frightened, but then he starts to smile and begins laughing in per­
fect unison with Sue while making faint attempts to brush her hands 
away. After about a minute of this, they both begin to quiet down and 
their faces and bodies relax; Sue says, ''I'm going to go get your dinner 
ready." As she starts to stand up Nathan suddenly indicates that he 
wants to be chased and starts to move purposefully across the room, 
looking back with nodding glances as Sue is in hot pursuit. Nathan then 
smiles broadly and shrieks in delight as Sue, laughing loudly, shouts, 
"I'm going to catch you." 
Sasha, a one-year-old, is lying on the floor hugging Eeyore, his fa­
vorite stuffed animal, when Ginny walks in. When she sees him hug­
ging Eeyore, she smiles warmly and says in a high voice, "Isn't that nice: 
You're hugging Eeyore." Sasha quickly looks up and struggles to his feet 
while clutching Eeyore. As soon as he is standing, he holds Eeyore up to 
Ginny with a look of utter seriousness on his face. Ginny bends over 
and gently takes Eeyore from his hands, saying as she does so: ''Are you 
giving me Eeyore? Isn't that wonderful. Hello, Eeyore. Would you like a 
big hug?" As she is saying this, she is giving Eeyore a warm hug, burying 
her face in his belly. Sasha watches intently and, while she is cuddling 
he reaches up with his right hand and points. Smiling broadly,

Introduction 
Ginny responds by handing him Eeyore. Sasha takes Eeyore and hugs 
him in exactly the same way that Ginny has just done, burying his head 
in the toy's belly. While he does this, he makes a sort of babbling sound 
that has the same rhythmic contours as the words Ginny has just spo­
ken. The cuddle lasts for a few seconds and then Sasha looks up at 
Ginny and, his eyes shining, he holds Eeyore up to her again. Ginny, 
her eyes shining with the same intensity, responds, "Oh boy, can I hug 
Eeyore again?" fu she starts to take Eeyore from him, Sasha gives a huge 
smile and breaks into a happy laugh and starts to wave his hands, almost 
as if he were trying to clap. Now laughing herself, Ginny hands Eeyore 
back and, her mind on something else, turns and begins to walk to­
wards the kitchen. fu soon as she has taken her first step, Sasha makes 
some distinct sounds that have a yearning quality. Hearing this, Ginny 
immediately turns back to him and, now laughing loudly, asks, "Does 
Eeyore need another hug?" This time, she bends over and hugs the two 
of them while Sasha chuckles softly. 
These babies are both developing their ability to engage in back-and­
forth emotional signaling. As we said earlier, this ability, a critical step in 
forming symbols, is not genetically mediated, but took millions of years 
to be learned and was then passed on from nonhuman primate cultures 
to human cultures. It is not mastered by every baby; these subtle emo­
tional interactions in which Nathan and Sasha are engaging with their 
caregivers are delicate learned processes that require skillful caregiving. 
Yet they are not new or even uniquely human. 
In fact, one of these two babies is a bonobo chimpanzee interacting 
with his mom. Which one is it? The answer is in the endnote.1o 
These interactive emotional processes that we share with nonhuman 
primates and many other mammals reach higher levels of organization 
in humans. As children transform emotions, through learning interac­
tions with caregivers, from primitive fixed actions, the emotions become 
part of and orchestrate intelligent problem-solving interactions with the 
world. For example, we show in Chapter 2 how complex advanced 
emotions, such as empathy, compassion, respect, and pride, become 
necessary ingredients in high levels of reflective thinking. 
Just as the discoveries of the wheel and fire set in motion enormous 
technological advances, the learned ability to signal with emotions and 
progress through various stages of emotional transformation enabled 
the development of symbols, language, and thinking, including reflec­
tive reasoning and self-awareness. In the twenty-first century, however,

these culturally mediated learning processes that took millions of years 
to evolve may be at risk. Because the critical changes in the mind and 
brain that support reflective thinking depend on the way in which hu­
mans interact emotionally with and learn from each other, these pat­
terns are vulnerable. Misunderstanding regarding what's essential about 
human beings could easily increase this vulnerability. 
For example, the human mind is being thought of more and more as 
a series of neuronal circuits under genetic control. These circuits are 
viewed as accessible to biological manipulation with everything from 
"nano robots" to polypharmacy, without sufficient appreciation of the 
emotional and social contexts within which the mind and brain grow 
and maintain their subtle equilibrium. There is also insufficient appreci­
ation of the boundary between curing disease on the one hand and tam-
_.pering with our humanity under the guise of artificially increasing our 
potential on the other. Events or changes in family or group structure 
that alter the nature of early interactions between caregivers and their 
infants and children could alter an evolutionary line that dates back to 
prehuman and primate cultures. 
The first section of The First Idea: How Symbols, Language, and Intel­
ligence Evolved will focus on the formation of symbols and reflective 
thinking. In Part II, we will then show how these insights have helped 
us know what to look for in human evolution, and present a new model 
of evolution. 
In Part III, we will show how this hypothesis challenges and revises 
current thinking about the human mind. We will explore its implica­
tions for a new view of language, cognition, autism, and the develop­
ment and functioning of the brain. 
In Part IV, we will explore the implications of this model for under­
standing groups, cultures, and societies. We will show how "groups" 
evolved through a series of stages and can be characterized according to 
their developmental needs and functioning. Our developmental model 
of groups will reveal the new challenges of a world now connected not 
only by shared communication and economies but by shared techno­
logical and environmental dangers as well. It will inform a new psychol­
ogy of global interdependency that can help us understand emerging 
social and political forces. 
Although the authors speak as one voice in this book, we bring very 
different training and experience to bear on the questions discussed. 
One of us (S.I.G.) is a child psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who brings

years of clinical work with infants, children, and their families, as well as 
research in early development and mental health. The other (S.C.S.), 
philosopher and psychologist, brings intense study of language, both in 
humans and nonhuman primates, as well as research into Artificial In­
telligence and the philosophy of psychology. Although readers may be 
aware of our individual contributions, the authors have worked together 
for many years to uncover the developmental pathways leading to lan­
guage, intelligence, and mental health.

Origin and Development of Symbols

Origin of Symbols 
How DO WE COME to form symbols and learn to think? As we 
mentioned in the introduction, we have recently found a new an­
swer to this longstanding question. Our ability to form symbols, which 
enables us to represent our world and reason about it-and all the great 
intellectual accomplishments that build upon this-has an unexpected 
origin. In order to develop symbols, we must transform our basic emo­
tions into a series of succeedingly more complex emotional signals. This 
human capacity to exchange emotional signals with each other begins in 
early life during an unusually long practice period and leads to symbols, 
language, abstract thinking, and a variety of complex emotional and so­
cial skills that enable social groups to function. The exchange of emo­
tional signals may also play a critical role in the development of the 
brain, especially that of the higher cortical centers dealing with language 
and thinking, the prefrontal cortex dealing with planning and problem 
solving, and the integrating pathways that connect subsymbolic systems 
that process basic emotions such as fear and anxiety (such as those in­
volving the amygdala) with cortical symbolic capacities. 
Symbol formation is a complicated process that has perplexed ancient 
and modern philosophers and scientists alike. Only human beings, as far 
\ we know, can engage in reflective thinking. They can think about and 
!,
udge their own thoughts or feelings, saying to themselves, for example, 
That's a good idea"; "That's nonsense"; "I want (or don't want) to do 
that"; "I should or shouldn't feel this way." Many members of the animal 
kingdom can solve problems, but only human beings, we believe, can use 
Symbols to think reflectively. Thinking means not just having a verbal or

visual image, but being able to take that image, manipulate it, combine it 
with other images, and then organize these at different levels. At the re­
flective level this involves reflecting on one's own thoughts-"Why am I 
thinking about that?" We all vary considerably in the degree of reflection 
we can use. There would seem to be no limit to ever deeper reflections or 
new insights about many of the eternal questions. 
If we are to nurture these vital human talents in childhood and adult 
society, we need to know how this ability is acquired through develop­
ment and how it came about during the course of evolution. 
How does a baby develop from an action-oriented, global set of re­
sponses into a reflective, thoughtful, problem-solving individual? There 
are various existing theories. In our view, however, they leave this funda­
mental question unanswered. Although we have traveled to the moon 
and back, we haven't been able to figure out how we became able to "fig­
ure out" how to get there. 
A MISSING LINK 
The most popular current view held by those in the field of behavioral 
genetics, neuroscience, and cognitive science is that the ability to sym­
bolize and use language is based on the physical wiring of the brain. This 
view holds, for example, that there is a language module in the brain. 
This module is contained in the genetic code and, during the course of 
evolution, came into being through natural selection. This view was pop­
ularized years ago by Noam Chomsky,1 the MIT linguist who holds that 
important elements oflanguage (e.g., grammar) are prewired and require 
only that the environment "turn on" the program. Steven Pinker, also 
from MIT, in his new book The Blank Slate,2 presents a recent example 
of this view. 
Another theory of how the brain and mind work holds that emotions 
operate at one level of brain organization and rational, reflective thought 
at another level. For example, Joseph LeDoux,3 whose work we will de­
scribe in more detail later on, has mapped out the role of the limbic sys­
tem in the processing of emotions. While this "subsymbolic system" 
relates to symbolic, cortical systems, it is viewed as a fundamentally sepa­
rate system within which emotions and reflective thought are often in 
conflict (passion versus reason). 
Origin o/Symbols 
1 9  
In both these views the ability to form symbols is mostly genetic (hard 
wired). There are modules in the brain that are biological givens. If a 
baby is fed, is not ill, and doesn't have a neurological deficit, the baby de­
velops a certain wiring of his or her brain because it's in the genetic blue­
print. While few would argue that a child does not need to hear language 
to become language-literate, this theory holds that only a very general 
kind of environmental switch, like hearing the human voice, is required 
in order to learn language. A sizable group of scholars believe in this 
viewpoint. Both thinking skills and temperament are viewed as being the 
product of our genes. The environment isn't discounted entirely; it's just 
assigned a lesser role. 
This view does not discuss the developmental steps in the growth of 
the mind that would account for the shift from a reaction-driven baby to 
_a reflective adult. The explanation is that somehow this transition is pre­
wired or preprogrammed into our brains and emerges on its own sched­
ule with only more general or global environmental input required. 
Since this genetic perspective has not worked out the critical steps and 
pathways leading to language or intelligence, it can't answer why, for ex­
ample, we see different levels of thinking among identical twins. Years 
ago, we did an in-depth clinical study of identical twins and found that 
many had different levels of reflective thinking.4 Not only in identical 
twins but in all children, the emergence of reflective thinking and use of 
symbols can be derailed by differences in nurture. 
Why are some adults impulsive and unable to use the ability to rea­
son and think to control their actions? They just discharge aggressive 
behavior. Why do children in orphanages who have been given ade­
quate medical care and nutrition and heard language spoken, but who 
have been deprived of critical social interactions, often fail to develop 
fully language and social skills? These are questions that would lead us 
to ask what the mechanisms are that explain (even if you're inclined to 
believe in minimal environmental influence) these variations in intellec­
tual development. 
Another view is that proposed by the field of cognitive development. 
Jean Piaget and his followers created the most systematic version of this 
theory. Piaget offers a more developmental and dynamic explanation for 
how symbols are formed,5 but misses its most critical elements. He be­
lieves that symbols emerge from earlier levels of sensorimotor intelli­
gence. His model sees the baby operating on his environment and 

20 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
learning from experience as a critical factor. He refutes Chomsky's and 
the genetic and neuroscience view that symbols emerge from a prewired, 
genetically controlled brain module and emphasizes the role of learning 
and experience. As we will discuss in more detail later, however, Piaget 
does not give an adequate explanation for the critical transitions from in­
telligent action to intelligent thinking with symbols. Piaget's construc­
tivist stance-that is, the child constructs his understanding of the world 
from active experience with the world-has many helpful elements, in­
cluding wonderfully detailed descriptions of stages of thinking. His pio­
neering descriptions of levels or stages of thinking, however, do not 
explain this critical transition, that is, how symbols and thinking actually 
come about. What are the mechanisms? 
Cultural anthropology, child development, and dynamic systems ap­
proaches have also looked at the issue of symbol formation and the gene­
sis of thinking. Researchers in these fields recognize the importance of 
experience and, like Piaget, believe that children's development depends 
on human interaction. These fields have also emphasized the enormous 
variation and the importance of the social and cultural context in the 
way in which children learn to symbolize and think. Although these 
fields recognize certain missing pieces in understanding human develop­
ment, they leave open the question of how symbol formation and think­
ing are learned. 
The question of how a baby progresses from global reactions to reflec­
tive thinking not only has perplexed students of human development 
but has also perplexed those in the field of evolution. As we will discuss 
in more detail in Part II, evolutionary psychologists have been struggling 
to figure out how primates progressed from prelanguage to language­
based beings-how they progressed from early, action-oriented creatures 
capable of only a limited degree of tool use to reflective individuals who 
can build a rocket ship capable of travelling to the moon, create great lit­
erature, and construct complex social organizations. The best that cur­
rent theories of evolution can come up with is that during the last 
200,000 years, modern humans, through genetic changes, have devel­
oped a new capacity for higher-level thinking and that challenges from 
the environment have enabled human beings to use this new, genetically 
mediated mental capacity. The mechanisms by which this happened, 
and the steps through which it happened, are still a mystery. Therefore, 
there is no coherent or logical explanation for why, between 30,000 and 
Origin of Symbols 
21 
50,000 years ago, the fossil record shows a surge of new tools and re­
markable symbolic drawings on cave walls. 
THE SOCIAL ORIGINS 
OF COGNITION 
In 1929, the Russian philosopher V N. Volosinov wrote in his book The 
Philosophy of Languagtf> that "signs (symbols) emerge only in the process 
of interaction between one individual consciousness and another. . . .  
And the individual consciousness is filled with signs." Lev Vygotsky, the 
well-known Russian psychologist and philosopher, also stressed the so­
cial nature of cognition and language.? Studies in the middle of the 
_twentieth century established the importance of early emotional en­
gagement between infants and caregivers by showing the massive effects 
of institutional deprivation on cognitive, language, and social develop­
ment. The well-known studies of Spitz, Bowlby, and Hunt, as well as 
the notorious experiments of Harry Harlow on nonhuman primates, 
showed that even babies who were well-fed and properly cleaned needed 
emotional contact with a caregiver to grow and develop.8 
There is considerable current interest in and support for the role of 
emotions and social interaction in human development. For example, 
higher-quality child care, including emotionally sensitive caregiving, is 
associated with stronger cognitive, language, and emotional and social 
development.9 On the other hand, recent studies show that insensitive 
or poor emotional interaction between infants and caregivers, low­
quality day care, long hours in full-time daycare (over thirty hours a 
week), and a mother's returning to full-time work (over thirty hours 
a week) before her baby is nine months old were all associated with 
more challenges, for example, increased stress and aggression. lO In a 
ɻtudy of multirisk families, we found that early problems in emotional 
Interaction were associated with a variety of language and cognitive dif­
Fculties in children, and that as we improved early emotional interac­
tIons through a comprehensive intervention program, competency in 
emotional and intellectual functioning increased.l I  In another study, 
We found that the risk factors, such as mental illness and family dys­
function, that undermine caregiver and family emotional relationships 
are associated with compromises to intellectual functioning. Families 

22 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
with four or more risk factors interfering with relationships were 
twenty times more likely to have children exhibiting marginal IQ 
scores and behavior problems at age four. 1 2 This pattern continued and 
was again documented when the children were thirteen years 01d.13 In 
studies of emotional rhythmicity between caregivers and babies, it has 
also been shown that early emotional interactions influence cognitive 
capacities in the preschool years. 14 A recent study of older children 
showed that this basic capacity for timing and rhythmicity, which orig­
inates during the infant's earliest emotional interactions, is associated 
with levels in a range of cognitive and academic skills during the school 
years.15 A large empirical literature, recently summarized by the Na­
tional Academy of Sciences, also documents the importance of early 
emotional interactions for children's later cognitive and social skills.16 
This review includes the well-known studies on the favorable impact of 
early intervention. 17 
THE ROLE OF EMOTION 
Recognition of the social origins of cognition has also been strength­
ened by neurological research. New knowledge of the pathways that 
process emotions, the effect of stressful emotional experiences on the 
brain, and the impact of brain lesions on emotional regulation has illu­
minated this link (see Chapter 10).18 In addition, explorations of the 
types of thinking that are part of skillful social interactions (emotional 
intelligence) and concepts of multiple intelligences have further sup­
ported and increased interest in the role of emotions. 19 Recently, when 
we worked on emotional interactions with children with developmental 
disorders, including autistic spectrum disorders, we found that a sub­
group of the children could learn to engage with others; think creatively, 
logically, and reflectively; enjoy peers; and do well academically in regu­
lar classes (see Chapter 1 1).20 
In spite of this support for and greate'r interest in the role of emotions 
in human development, there has not been sufficient understanding of 
how emotions exert their influence, nor of the ways emotions and emo­
tional interactions affect intelligence and its related cognitive and lan­
guage abilities as well as many complex social and self-regulation skills. 
There has not been sufficient understanding of the psychological or 
Origin of Symbols 
23 
neurological mechanisms of action by which emotions influence these 
different aspects of the mind. 
In other words, we have correlational studies showing that emotions 
are important. We even have neurological data and clinical data showing 
that interfering with emotional functioning negatively influences cogni­
tive and social capacities. But we haven't had a theory that explains ade­
quately just how during development emotions exert their considerable 
influence. Because we have not had an adequate understanding of how 
emotions exert their influence, emotions have taken a back seat to cogni­
tion, language, and memory. Therefore, the question remains: What are 
the developmental steps and pathways through which such distinctly hu­
man capacities as symbol formation, language, and reflective thinking 
emerge in the life of each new infant and child and, furthermore, how 
. . did these human capacities emerge during the course of evolution? 
A NEW APPROACH 
TO THE QUESTION 
We have had a somewhat unique opportunity to search for answers to 
this question. Over the years, we have worked with normally developing 
infants and children and observed them to see symbol formation in 
progress. We saw thinking skills develop over time. However, because we 
also worked with children who had difficulties, we had a chance to ob­
serve many of the variations in these skills. This research included work 
with multiproblem families in which there was severe environmental 
deprivation; indeed, children weren't receiving the basics, and many of 
them were afflicted with ADHD, ADD, and a variety of learning prob­
lems. We worked with children with autistic spectrum disorders and 
other biologically based, special needs conditions where the biology of 
the child was expressed through problems with processing information 
(such as language, motor, visual-spatial processing). The problems inter­
fered with learning to think, relate, and communicate. These children 
couldn't interact in the way that is needed not because the environment 
Was unWilling to provide essential learning opportunities but because 
their own biology made it hard for them to learn. Yet when we figured 
OUt how to create special learning opportunities that dealt with these 
processing differences, we saw that many of these children could learn. 

24 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
Over time we learned which therapeutic and educational experiences 
worked, even when there were biological limitations, and which didn't. 
Trying various prevention and intervention strategies gave us a unique 
window through which to study the developmental processes leading to 
symbol formation, thinking, and intelligence.21 
THE MISSING LINK 
IN SYMBOL FORMATION 
These observations have led us to a new understanding of how symbol 
formation comes about. So that we can understand this process, let's 
picture two situations. The first situation is that of a baby seeing his 
mother and crying immediately for food, or .a frustrated baby who is 
biting in anger. In both these instances, there is a link between the 
baby's perception, a possible emotion (yearning for milk food, anger), 
and a relatively fixed set of behaviors (such as crying or biting). Con­
sider another situation, that of an adult sitting in a bar. Another patron 
gives him a dirty look for making a noise and he impulsively hits the pa­
tron who gave him the dirty look. Here, too, we see a relatively fixed 
pattern of action that's closely tied to a perception and a possible emo­
tion (such as anger). The baby and the barroom brawler both have in 
common this fixed perceptual motor or action pattern in which some­
thing that is seen or perceived leads to a possible emotion and an action 
pattern closely tied to that emotion (anger/biting, anger/hitting, yearn­
ing for food/crying). 
Contrast this with a young child who can think to himself, "There's 
Mommy! Maybe she'll get me some milk if I ask her nicely," and then 
be able to say, "Mommy, I'm hungry. Can I please have some milk?" A 
more mature and reRective barroom patron might think to himself, "1 
wonder why that guy glared at me. Was it because 1 was burping or 
making too much noise? 1 wonder if that offended him. Maybe I should 
say, 'Excuse me.'" The barroom brawler who can think through his own 
feelings, and the possible feelings of another person, can say, "Excuse 
me!" and see whether the other person accepts his statement. Or per­
haps he could say to himself, "I've seen that look before, and reacting 
will only get me into more trouble!" In both situations, he is exploring 
options based on a process of reflective thinking involving the use of 
Origin of Symbols 
25 
symbols rather than taking a relatively fixed action based on an immedi­
ate perception and an associated emotion. 
To understand how babies or barroom brawlers progress from actions 
to thinking, we need to look more closely at some critical developmen­
tal steps. We have found that there are two conditions that need to be 
met for human beings to progress from the fixed action level to a level 
where they can create meaningful symbols and thoughts. The first con­
dition, which we have discussed in earlier works,22 is that relevant emo­
tional experiences must invest symbols as they form. Images without 
emotion, or affect-that is, without meaning-create memories with­
out meaning. We see this phenomenon in some children with autism. 
They just repeat words rather than convey what the words mean. For 
example, "mama" is one of the first words children use. If we ask, "What 
. . does 'mama' mean to you?" and the answer is, "Red hair, green eyes, and 
tall," we suspect developmental challenges. But if the child says, "Mama 
is loving and she feeds me" or "Mama is mean and bossy and she doesn't 
do what I want her to do," then we feel confident about the child's de­
velopment. Meaningful words involve emotionally rich images. It's the 
same with "dada" or "no." When children develop words without mean­
ing, they tend to use the words in a scripted way, repeating what they 
heard on TV or read in a book. 
Therefore, to create a meaningful symbol, the image must be in­
vested with emotion. We don't have meaningful symbols (you can have 
imagery, but not symbols) unless affect invests the image. Even seem­
ingly impersonal objects, such as an apple or concepts such as numbers, 
we have found, require emotional investment if they are to become 
meaningful symbols. As we will explain, an apple is not just red and 
round, it's something you give your teacher with pride and throw at 
your brother in anger. The understanding of number concepts is based 
on how it feels to have a "lot" or a "little" of something. To a three-year­
old, "a lot" is more than you want and "a little" is less than you expect. 
The second condition for creating meaningful symbols is the one 
ٚhat was a dramatic new insight for us. Yet it was so basic in its simplic­
Ity that it also surprised us. This second condition is that a symbol 
emerges when a perception is separated foom its action. The developmental 
process that enables a human being to separate perception from action 
Pٛovides the missing link in understanding symbol formation and 
higher levels of consciousness, thinking, and self-reflection. In Chapter 

26 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
3, we will also show that this developmental process was a critical step 
in the course of evolution. 
THE SEPARATION OF 
PERCEPTION FROM ACTION 
In most nonhuman animals, very young babies, and impulsive older 
humans, perception is tied closely to action. A trout, for example, per­
ceives a fly or a larger fish, and what happens next? He moves toward it 
and attacks, or he flees. The perception triggers an action. There is very 
little pause or delay in carrying out the action. In a baby, you expect 
this. In some preschoolers, you expect this (a child sees a toy and he 
grabs it). Across the animal kingdom, you can see that some are more 
tied to the perceptual/motor (action) patterns and some a little less be­
cause they are more adept at problem solving. 
To understand how humans make the huge step from action to 
thinking, let's look at the parts of this process more closely. First, what is 
a perception, whether of another person or an object such as an apple? 
We perceive when the mind registers a sight, sound, smell, or other sen­
sation. Often, a perception involves the registering of several or all these 
sensations together. Such a multisensory "image" is simply what we see, 
hear, and/or touch. Without an action, it is a freestanding image or 
multisensory impression or "picture." 
When the baby and the barroom brawler move from perception to 
action, there are three steps. They perceive something, for example, the 
baby perceives the mother or the barroom brawler perceives another 
person giving him a dirty look. They then may experience an emotion, 
and a tendency toward one or a few actions at almost the same moment. 
The baby, for example, may experience hunger and then begin crying or 
sucking to deal with that emotional and physical need. The barroom 
brawler may experience rage and, in a fixed pattern, immediately strike 
out. Even verbal adults will often be unaware of this emotional part of 
the fixed pattern. When asked what happened in a situation, they may 
reply, "He gave me a dirty look and I hit him." If you inquire, "How did 
that dirty look make you feel?" the barroom brawler is likely to say, "It 
made me feel like hitting him." He simply describes his action. Of 
course, our baby can't verbally describe his actions, but in all likelihood 
he also experiences his own actions without any self-awareness. 
Origin o/Symbols 
27 
What if this pattern is interrupted? Then a perception may not lead 
automatically to a fixed action. In other words, our baby would be able 
to perceive his mother without being driven to some fixed behavior. 
Our barroom brawler might be able to perceive that somebody is look­
ing at him critically and not be driven instantly to hitting. If the baby or 
brawler can perceive the other person without taking action, they are 
left with a freestanding image. 
The ability to experience a freestanding image (a multisensory picture) 
is a momentous developmental step. Such a freestanding image is used in 
a variety of ways; for example, it can be used to accumulate more experi­
ence. Rather than the image of mother being associated only with crying 
and milk, it can become associated with other experiences as well. Over 
time, this freestanding image of mother can be imbued with many emo-
. .  tional experiences-playing, eating, being comforted, and so forth. The 
freestanding perception or image acquires emotional "meaning." 
As a freestanding image is seasoned with more and more emotional 
experiences, it is on its way to becoming an internal symboL Over long 
stretches of time, a symbol for something as complex and important as 
"mother" will involve such complex meanings as love, devotion, con­
trol, annoyance, and sacrifice. But, to begin this journey toward becom­
ing a symbol, a perception must first be separated from fixed actions. 
A freestanding perception that becomes an internal symbol continues 
to define itself throughout life. This is true for simple images and symbols 
as well as for complex ones. The internal image of a strawberry enables us 
to see, and sometimes almost to taste or smell, that berry without actually 
eating it (taking action). As with the example of the image of "mother," 
the image of a strawberry can acquire more meaning, perhaps from mem­
ories of summer meadows or gardening, or from books and films. 
TRANSFORMING CATASTROPHIC 
EMOTI ONS INTO EMOTIONAL SI GNALS 
E?W to the tough question: How do we separate a perception from the 
lٜltial tendency or urge to take immediate action? To answer this ques­
tIon, let's first look at instant nonreflective responses, which tend to keep 
human beings tied to fixed actions. Babies, older nonhuman animals, and 
barroom brawlers usually experience affects or emotions in a "cata­
strophic" way. Catastrophic emotions are intense global emotional states, 

28 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
such as massive rage, fear, or emotional hunger or neediness, that press for 
direct discharge in fixed actions. These intense global feeling states are of­
ten tied to the fight or flight reactions, massive avoidance approach, seek­
ing behaviors, or other basic responses. When a caribou sees a wolf, or a 
baby sees a stranger, fear drives responses. In these situations, there is little 
subtle nuance or pause to solve a problem. 
Human beings under the pressure of intense emotions will often at­
tack or run away. Others may also withdraw, avoid, freeze, or approach. 
For some, if the emotion of fear is very intense, they are momentarily al­
most paralyzed. In these situations, we are observing "catastrophic," or 
global emotional, reactions. 
When people say something's emotional, and use the term "emo­
tion," often they are referring ro this level of intense (often seemingly ir­
rational) emotionality-fight or flight reactions, panic, avoidance, 
feeling overwhelmed, being overwhelmed. These catastrophic feeling 
states are part of a primitive perceptual motor level of central nervous 
system organization. 
In human development, however, infants can learn to " tame" cata­
strophic emotional patterns. Early to midway in the first year of life, care­
givers help babies begin to learn how to transform catastrophic emotions 
into interactive signals. For example, we frequently observe the following: 
A mother smiles and the baby smiles back. She coos and the baby coos 
back. A baby smiles, raises his arms as if to say, "Hey!" and vocalizes emo­
tionally needy sounds that convey "Look at me!" The mother looks his 
way. Baby then smiles and flirts and the mother flirts back. By seven to 
eight months, the baby can keep it going, and mothers will often keep re­
sponding. Now we have back-and-forth emotional signaling, or "circles 
of communication." Contrast this pattern with one in which emotional 
signaling does not occur. A baby smiles and vocalizes and a mother, pre­
occupied with her own thoughts, ignores the overture. Baby tries again 
with more "oomph," this time moving his arms, vocalizing more loudly, 
and smiling even more brightly, bur with obvious strain. The mother still 
ignores his overtures. After three more tries, we observe the baby looking 
despondent and resigned as he leans back, becomes passive, and stares at 
his mobile without showing signs of interest or pleasure. 
For the type of emotional signaling we described in the first example 
to occur, the baby needs to have been wooed into a warm pleasurable 
relationship with one or a few caregivers so that there is another human 
being toward whom he experiences deep emotions and, therefore, with 
Origin of Symbols 
29 
whom he wants to communicate. He also needs opportunities to be "in­
tentional," to express an emotion or need by making a sound, using a 
facial expression, or making a gesture with his arm, and to have his ef­
forts become part of a back-and-forth interaction by being responded 
to. For all this to happen, he needs to have a relatively intact central ner­
vous system so that he can move his facial muscles and arms and begin 
to recognize patterns. 
Human beings are distinguished from most mammals by having a 
long period of dependence on caregivers. During this time, infants and 
toddlers can develop, use, and rely on nonverbal, gestural, emotional 
signals to meet basic needs, interact, and communicate. These years 
provide continuous opportunities to learn and fine-tune the skills of 
emotional signaling; these skills will continue to be learned and refined 
. . during the course of life even after words and other symbols are mas­
tered. As we will see, these emotional signals are used to communicate, 
to negotiate, and, ultimately, to govern, or orchestrate, our emotional 
states, and to build our cognitive abilities. 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
EM OTIONAL SI GNALING 
Before they learn to use emotions to signal, during these same early 
months of life, babies are learning about the world outside themselves. 
As caregivers provide interesting and pleasurable sights, sounds, and 
calming, regulating interactions, these experiences facilitate interest in 
the outside world and the use of the senses and motor system. These 
types of nurturing interactions enable the infant to awaken to the world 
outside himself. These nurturing, pleasurable interactions also deepen 
the infant's engagement and relationship to his caregivers. During the 
early months, this growing intimate relationship enables the infant to 
become more deeply involved in all aspects of his caregivers' emotional 
communications. 
As his nervous system develops, an infant becomes more able to regu­
late his facial muscles and give a big smile (or angry glare). Not only can 
hٝ look where he wants and turn toward pleasurable, interesting care­
?lver sounds, he can also reach for a caregiver's nose or an enticing ob-
Ject she is holding. Through his relationship to his caregiver(s), he is 
becoming more intentional. 

30 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
This budding intentionality can then be harnessed into back-and­
forth emotional signaling. For example, the baby turns to look at his 
mother as she makes an interesting sound, mother gives him a big smile, 
and he smiles back. She moves her head a little and makes another in­
teresting sound and, with an expectant tone, says, "Can you find me 
now?" Baby moves his head to find her and greets her eyes with a big 
smile and sound of his own, as though to say, "What do you think of 
that?" Mother responds with her own sound and they continue to ex­
change pleasurable smiles, sounds, and a variety of facial expressions. 
As mentioned earlier, a baby wants to communicate because he is so 
engaged with his caregivers. If his care is too chaotic or neglectful (if he 
is left alone in his crib all the time), he may either withdraw or become 
hyper-excitable, vigilant, and/or disorganized. He may remain governed 
by catastrophic, global emotions rather than enter into a pattern of reg­
ulated emotional signaling and interaction. 
By nine to eleven months, this process can become very complicated. 
Babies and emerging toddlers can exhibit a range of emotions-pleasure, 
disgust, anger, annoyance, surprise. These are not simply expressions but 
can now be used for emotional signaling. A mother looks annoyed and 
baby looks shocked. Then she is quiet for just a split second and baby 
watches, as if to say, "What else are you going to do?" The mother smiles. 
The baby coos. The subtle facial expressions exchanged can express a vast 
range of emotions. There is an almost infinite variety of affective varia­
tions that can be employed in these interchanges. The exchanges also 
include sounds, movements, and problem-solving actions (reaching, tak­
ing, giving back, crawling, toddling here or there, searching). These ex­
changes of sound and movement are guided by the toddler's emotional 
"intent," his purposeful goals. 
These baby-caregiver exchanges, or circles of communication, can be­
come quite extended. We refer to long chains of emotional signaling as 
reciprocal, co-regulated emotional interactions. Each of these terms has a 
slightly different history in developmental psychology and carries with it 
a slightly different connotation. The term "interaction" is, perhaps, the 
oldest of the three, and can be traced back to Lev Vygotsky and Jean Pi­
aget, if not beyond.23 In Vygotsky's usage, which is the sense more com­
monly associated with child-caregiver interaction, the term primarily 
applies to social interaction.24 But by no means does it entail that the 
two individuals in a dyadic interaction are equal partners, and indeed, 
Origin o/SymboLs 
31 
more often than not the more experienced partner (the caregiver) moni­
tors the child's abilities and, one hopes, ever so subtly "raises the bar" to 
promote the child's cognitive, communicative, and social development. 
The term "reciprocal," which the developmental psychologists Bate­
son and Trevarthan began to highlight in the 1970s, draws attention to 
the back-and-forth nature of preverbal interactions between infant and 
caregiver.25 It is not just that the caregiver and infant are interacting, but 
that there is a certain "conversation-like" pattern to their interactions. Fi­
nally, the notion of "co-regulation," which developmental psychologist 
Alan Fogel has been most instrumental in clarifying, draws attention to 
how communicating partners continuously influence one another and 
together create new behaviors and meanings; for example, the toddler 
and caregiver make interactive sound patterns that become "funny."26 
. . Combining all three of these constructs-eo-regulation, reciprocity, and 
interaction-brings us closest to understanding the dynamics and the 
richness of what is involved when we speak more simply of "emotional 
interaction" or "emotional signaling." This rich history of emotional in­
teraction, however, never anticipated the truly vital role these interac­
tions would have for forming symbols and higher levels of reflective 
thinking abilities. 
A good, fully engaged conversation between adults has many of the 
same ingredients. Both partners initiate and respond to the other in a 
continuing manner. Each partner takes the initiative and influences the 
other. It's a co-regulated pattern in that the baby is an important initia­
tor and player in the drama. If the baby is not initiating and it's just a 
mother stimulating baby (tickling the tummy) or a father picking the 
baby up and getting the baby to give a big smile, that's a one-way street. 
The baby is not a full, initiating partner. For these experiences to lead to 
symbol formation, they must be "co-regulated," each party influencing 
the other, and "reciprocal" in that both participate. 
When a baby engages in these co-regulated affective exchanges, he is 
Dearning to signal with his emotions to convey intent rather than engage 
l[ a complete fixed action. For example, the baby who is angry and be­
gIns to make an angry expression through a grimace is conveying the in­
tent to bite or hit through the expression. If the caregiver responds before 
tٞe baby actually bites or hits, that is, responds to the intent, the baby is 
lIkely to respond in return with another intent. For example, the parent 
responds to the baby's angry looks with a soft soothing look of "what's the 

32 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
matter" and, with hands out, an offer to pick him up and cuddle or feed 
him. The baby responds with a softening of his grimace and anger and a 
look of expectation. The parent then responds with another gesture­
reaching closer to the baby-and the baby now begins to break into a 
smile as he reaches his hands towards the parent. A second later, the par­
ent is holding the baby, snuggling, and patting his back, and the baby re­
laxes. The tension in his body dissipates and he has a look of calm. 
Consider different examples. The baby looks angry, signaling his in­
tent to bite or hit; the mother, and the father, too, who is right there, ig­
nores the baby's emotional signal. The baby bites the father on the arm. 
Or the baby looks angry and the mother, instead of responding sooth­
ingly, yells angrily: "What do you want?" The baby immediately begins 
crying and biting his own hand. 
In the first example, we saw complex signaling interrupt a fixed ac­
tion. Mother responded to the baby's signal of intent. He responded 
back and together they negotiated an outcome characterized by shared 
soothing pleasure rather than a unilateral aggressive action. In the sec­
ond two examples, the baby went right from intent into actions because 
his intent was either not responded to or responded to in a way that did 
not interrupt his global response but simply intensified it and triggered 
fixed action. 
As his intentions are responded to, the baby becomes better and bet­
ter able to signal intent without escalating into direct action. During the 
middle and latter part of the first year of life, the baby's growing neuro­
logical development, in part, makes this possible. It is a necessary but 
not sufficient condition, however. It must be matched with a caregiving 
environment that enables the baby to learn back-and-forth emotional 
signaling. In other words, it won't develop on its own. Without learning 
and practice, the baby will remain locked into global emotional states 
(catastrophic emotions) and fixed actions. 
There are additional ways in which emotional signaling works to in­
terrupt the fixed action patterns and free perceptions from their associ­
ated actions. By having his intent responded to, the baby learns to 
modulate the intensity of his emotions. He is learning to regulate his 
mood. The baby is learning to show a little annoyance, to negotiate, 
and to get his needs met. There is, therefore, less of a tendency to ex­
plode into desperate action. For example, a toddler is pushing his botde 
away with an angry glance at his mom and is beginning to grow agi­
tated. She puts her hand out to take it from him and uses soothing 
Origin o/Symbols 
33 
tones to convey empathy and, in a slower rhythm (down regulating) of­
fers her finger to make contact. He squeezes it, feels a bit reassured, and 
looks expectantly as his mom holds up finger food to see whether he 
wants it. He waves his hand to convey yes. His anger and agitation is be­
ing responded to with soothing actions. If, on the other hand, the mom 
became agitated and used harsh vocal tones and a fast, abrupt arm 
movement (further up-regulating), in all likelihood her toddler would 
become more agitated and upset. 
Consider a toddler who is looking a little sad, subdued, and self­
absorbed. If his mom energizes up (up regulates) and pulls him into a 
joyful interaction, he learns to regulate in the other direction. Similarly, 
when his big smile wins a smile back he knows his joy is being re­
sponded to. He has a sense that he can regulate his mood and emotions 
through the regulating responses he gets from his environment. Infants 
and toddlers quickly sense that they and their caregivers are regulating 
one another when there is a back-and-forth, finely-tuned nuance system 
of affective interaction involving lots of mutual exchanges. It's not un­
usual to see infants or toddlers sometimes take the lead and flirtatiously 
pull a preoccupied dad (up-regulate) into a joyful interaction. 
In addition, the baby is learning that negotiation involves an interac­
tion between two people. He is not left to take action on the world 
alone. The perception of mother is not a static one leading automati­
cally to hunger or to the emotion of rage and biting or sucking behav­
ior. Once emotional signaling is learned, the perception of mother is 
associated with a complex pattern that involves negotiation and the 
promise of a slightly different outcome each time the negotiation oc­
curs. Rather than a fixed stimulus and response, the child now experi­
ences a variety of problem-solving interactions between two people. 
In this way, the baby learns that the person he is perceiving is not a 
simple "thing." Mother is not simply a feeder or comforter or a juicy 
person to bite. Now because of the complex signaling, the baby is en­
gaged in discovering that mother has many different characteristics. She 
feeds, soothes, excites, and limits. This emerging complex picture of 
ٟother, father, or others invites equally complex responses (rather than 
SImple fixed ones). 
Along the way, the baby learns to exchange emotional signals better 
for some emotions than others. Our barroom brawler may have nu­
٠nced ways of expressing affection, but he remains a brawler when feel­
Ing anger. 

34 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
In the second year of a child's life, caregivers and toddlers signal back 
and forth to solve more and more problems, which further favors affec­
tive signaling over impulsive action. The toddler is hungry, for example. 
Now he doesn't have to become catastrophic and yell and scream. His 
mother doesn't have to figure out why he's screaming ("Oh, you must 
want your milk. I'll go get it for you."). The child can go up to his 
mother, attract her attention with a little flirtation, and point and ges­
ture. Often, in response, mom smiles, looks expectantly, and gestures as 
if to say "Where?" The child takes her hand and starts walking over to 
the cookie jar. When they get there, the child bangs on it and mother 
looks and asks through her gestures and words, "Are you going to open 
it or am I?" The child points to her and she opens the jar. The child 
points to the cookie, and maybe even says "Coo." While the words are 
helpful, it's the gesturing that's most important. To obtain the cookie, 
the child has opened and closed many circles of communication with 
his mother, who has been a very interactive partner. 
Little Sally, fifteen months old, wants a book, so she goes and flirtS 
with dad. A dozen circles of communication later, dad's picking her up 
so that she can take the book off the shelf herself. This is another exam­
ple of shared social problem solving between a toddler and caregiver. 
During the latter part of the first year and into the second year of life, 
this ability is only beginning and there are still many occasions of crying 
and screaming. Just the same, a huge leap in human development has 
been taken. Interestingly, it is during this time of rapid improvement in 
back-and-forth emotional cueing and problem solving that the pre­
frontal cortex of the brain, the seat of our ability to sequence and plan 
actions and regulate emotions, is developing. 
THE ROLE OF THE CAREGIVER 
For the toddler to learn to take the initiative and enter into co-regulated, 
reciprocal emotional signaling, he needs caregivers who engage him in 
the steps we have been describing. They need to awaken him to the 
world outside of himself through regulated, synchronous interactions 
and pleasurable, interesting sights and sounds, touch, and movement. 
They need to "woo" him into a pleasurable, joyful, intimate relationship 
with themselves. They need to read and respond to his emotional signals, 
Origin o/Symbols 
35 
support his initiative, and facilitate a continuous flow of back-and-forth 
expressive signaling. 
In this process, caregivers elicit a range of emotions and motor and 
sensory capacities. For example, they facilitate joy, pleasure, assertiveness, 
and curiosity, and encourage looking, listening, smelling, touching, and 
movement all together and all as part of a relationship. (As we will de­
scribe later, this enables a child to integrate his different experiences and 
connect the different partS of his mind.) Because caregivers do all this ef­
fortlessly as part of having fun with their babies and toddlers, it's easy to 
overlook the many steps in this complex learning interaction. 
Engaging in co-regulated emotional interactions is just as important 
for the caregiver as for the child. Through these interactions, the care­
giver gradually learns at a very intuitive level how to negotiate with the 
. . child through different types of affective interaction patterns, such as 
when the child is angry, impulsive, sad, withdrawn, aimless, or needy. 
The more time the caregivers spend with the child, the more time there 
is to interact and become confident in their caregiving abilities. 
We have noted clinically that many caregivers who do not spend suf­
ficient time with their infants and toddlers in direct care may remain 
tense and anxious when their babies show strong affect. Because they 
have so little practice in entering into these patterns of co-regulated, 
emotional interactions, one consequence is that when a child does show 
strong affects, the caregiver may tend to be dysregulating, rather than 
regulating. This may lead to a higher likelihood of problems with the 
regulation of attention, mood, and behavior. 
We may be seeing more of these problems in today's busy societies 
because fewer parents are logging the hours to become confident in 
t?eir caregiving abilities. When caregivers are confident and early emo­
tional interactions are pleasurable and regulating, communication and 
symbol use can meet some of the infant's basic needs that were origi­
nCly met only through direct action. For example, back-and-forth flir­
tatious babbling and words can feel as good as a hug, and annoyed looks 
and angry vocalizations or words can satisfy a need to express anger. 
. Many caregivers do not engage in these learning interactions for a va­
nety of reasons, not simply because of a lack of opportunity or practice. 
If.a father is preoccupied and unavailable (tired or self-absorbed), he 
l.ght not keep up his part of the dialogue. If a mother is depressed and 
IVIng in her own world, she's not going to keep up her side. If a baby 

36 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
has processing or attentional problems, these can make it hard for him 
to initiate signals. He may have a hard time reading the parents' signals 
as well, and parents may then give up in their efforts. 
FROM CO-REGULATED, RECIPROCAL 
EMOTIONAL INTERACTIONS 
TO SYMBOL FO RMATION 
As humans, we're not unique in being able to form perceptions or im­
pressions. Most members of the animal kingdom can form images. Hu­
mans, however, can learn to engage in relatively longer, more continuous 
creative chains of emotional signals. They can then use this capacity to 
negotiate and solve problems, and, thereby, more fully separate percep­
tions or images from their fixed actions and construct higher and higher 
levels of internal symbols. A well-developed facial musculature supports 
our capacity for emotional signaling because it enables us to express a 
vast variety of subtle emotional gestures. While we also see many facial 
expressions of emotions and complex play and mating interactions in an­
imals, it's important to distinguish the degree to which these interactions 
are co-regulated and creative. In addition, our brains have a relatively 
more developed prefrontal cortex than those of other animals, which 
supports the regulating of emotions and planning and sequencing ac­
tions. As indicated, however, these "necessary" foundations are not suffi­
cient. Learning interactions of the type we have been describing are 
essential for the development of complex levels of emotional signaling. 
Humans are somewhat unique in their ability to separate perception 
from action. Most members of the animal kingdom can perceive stimuli 
(even reptiles perceive a stimulus). For the most part, however, reptiles 
are tied to very basic perceptual-motor patterns (attack the stimulus). 
Many mammals engage in some social and emotional signaling. Non­
human mammals, however, don't tend to engage in the long, affective 
signaling sequences needed to fully separate an image from its actions. 
For example, as we will describe in Chapter 3, nonhuman primates can 
exchange some affective signals, but they tend to do so in short bursts. 
When observing bonobo chimps, we saw that they looked, vocalized, 
gestured, and exchanged four to five quick emotional expressions and 
then went into action. Over time, we were able to help a few become 
Origin ofSymbo!s 
37 
more elaborate signalers. Although nonhuman primates clearly relate to 
each other and have many forms of covert communication, only some 
of which we likely have observed, in general, a continuous flow of overt 
reciprocal affect signaling is not readily observed. 
Through learning to transform emotions into long chains of interac­
tive signals, humans can form an image that's less tied to action and, 
therefore, can acquire meaning and become a symbol. Once the image 
is separated from its action-once food exists as an image separated 
from attacking the food source or crying-that image can serve a new 
purpose. Such an image can be used to plan, solve problems, and think. 
Human beings can also take a freestanding image and combine it with 
new and old experiences and other symbols. For example, they can 
combine the image of parents and siblings and construct a concept 
. . called "family." 
As we explore the development of symbols, we may wish to return to 
the question implied in the title of this book-The First Idea. What was 
the first idea? According to our hypothesis, an idea is an image that has 
been freed from a fixed, immediate action and is invested with affects or 
emotions (i.e., intent) to give it meaning. Many constructivist theories, 
including the pioneering work of Piaget, suggest that internal symbols 
or representations involve getting beyond action pattern problem solv­
ing. But these theories haven't been able to explain how this happens or 
the mechanism involved. They haven't identified the critical role of 
emotions and affect signaling. 
From our developmental studies, we suggest that the first idea is, 
therefore, the emergence of the capacity to invest a freestanding image 
with emotional meaning to make it into a meaningful multisensory, af­
fective image (i.e., an idea or symbol). Did the first idea also have spe­
cific content? Was the first idea of our ancestors of water, food, mama? 
According to our hypothesis of its origins, the content of the first idea 
was as varied as the emotional interests of the many early humans who 
Were constructing it. 
In summary, the answer to the question of how human beings form 
ɻymbols is that symbols come about by separating a perception, which 
IS the ability to form an image, from its action. This is achieved by co­
regulated, emotional interactions with other human beings. Ongoing 
c١-regulated emotional interactions provide emerging and later symbols 
WIth meaning throughout the course of life.

T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
FROM SYMBOL FORMATION TO LANGUAGE 
Symbol formation also makes it possible for language to develop and be 
used creatively and logically for communication, problem solving, and 
higher-level reflective thinking. Symbol formation, however, is only one 
of the foundations for language. The others also, interestingly, stem 
from co-regulated, affective interactions and, together with symbols, 
form a confluence of factors that enable language to develop. As we will 
discuss more fully in the chapters on evolution and the development of 
the mind, the confluence of these factors occurs in infants and young 
children during the first two years of life and thereafter. We will show, 
however, that, during the course of evolution, these same factors took 
many millions of years to evolve. The critical factors for language that 
stem from co-regulated, affective interactions include: 
• Motor capacities, including increasingly complex vocalizations, facial ex­
pressions, affect intonations, postural changes, and problem-solving ac­
tions. Co-regulated affective interchanges are the vehicle through which 
these increasingly complex motor skills are practiced and developed. The 
tongue and oral motor capacities, more generally, can express an enor­
mous range and subtlety of affective variations and, therefore, were and 
are an important centerpiece for the motor skills needed to express an al­
most infinite variety of experience. In comparison, hand or finger varia­
tions do not have nearly the motor flexibility of the tongue and oral 
motor area. 
• Increasingly complex social interactions that enable groups to move be­
yond communicating simply to meet concrete needs, such as food and 
shelter, and use communication for social goals. Social problem solving 
enables economies of scale that allow for free time beyond survival needs; 
it also stirs the creative use of communication. 
• The use of communication for communication itself rather than only for 
meeting concrete needs. Co-regulated affect signaling enables nonhuman 
and human primates to meet their basic needs for nurrurance and close­
ness with others (a basic need both groups require for survival) through 
complex, social, affective interaction. Holding, touching, and proximal 
smelling, and other forms of direct contact, which all rely on proximal 
and concrete modes of communication, can now be partially satisfied 
through distal communication across space because of the ability to use 
gestures to signal over longer distances. Feelings of closeness can now oc-
Origin a/Symbols 
39 
cur through presymbolic signal exchanges and, eventually, through sym­
bolic conversations. This means that communication in its own right be­
gins to serve the basic need for intimacy and nurrurance. Through serving 
this need, communication has the motivational system behind it to de­
velop to higher levels (that's one reason why some people just love to talk). 
As complex motor skills, including vocalization, combine with symbol 
formation, complex social signaling, problem solving, and the ability to 
find pleasure in communication for itself, all the factors needed for lan­
guage and speech are present. Guided by relationships and the different 
levels of emotional signaling, these factors work together during develop­
ment to create the capacity for language and speech. There is no evidence 
for a specific biological event either during the development of an indi-
. .  vidual infant and child or during the course of evolution (e.g., a muta­
tion that altered evolution). Rather, there is mounting evidence for this 
developmental hypothesis, which explains how biology and experience 
work together. In this hypothesis it is necessary for a child to be engaged 
in a series of affective interactions that give rise to the development of 
motor, sensory, and social capacities, which, when combined with sym­
bol formation, lead to language. The symbolic use of language, in turn, 
creates the foundation for more advanced social and intellectual capaci­
ties, including higher and higher levels of reflective thinking. 
EXPERIENCE- BASED LEARNING 
The theory of symbol formation presented in this chapter allows us to 
distinguish more clearly the respective contributions of genes and expe­
rience to higher levels of symbol formation and reflective thinking. Our 
genes and the changes in genetic structure over the course of evolution 
provided Homo sapiens with a unique adaptive ability: to learn from ex­
perience-based interactions with others and the environment. There is 
no scientific evidence that genes by themselves, however, can explain 
complex interactive behavior, problem solving, or thinking. This ability 
to learn enabled human beings to engage in interactive learning experi­
ences and to acquire the "tools" oflearning, including emotional signals, 
problem-solving capacities, and the use of symbols to organize and re­
flect on experience. We often take our abilities to think and reflect for 
granted and ignore all the years of learning that went into their mastery. 

40 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
We also tend to mix up the learned tools of learning with factual learn­
ing, which uses more memorizing than thinking. These learned tools 
enable H sapiens to master knowledge and wisdom, as well as facts. 
Each new learned tool is a basis for learning to construct additional 
new tools for even higher-level learning; for example, symbol formation 
leads to putting symbols together creatively to form new concepts. In 
this way, H sapiens' ability to learn leads to various levels of new learn­
ing. But this process, that is, the capacity to move from the hardwired 
ability to learn to acquiring the tools of learning (emotional signaling, 
problem solving, symbol formation, and thinking) and then on to vari­
ous levels of knowledge and wisdom depends on each new baby's learn­
ing how to signal with his or her emotions rather than taking global 
actions. This is just as true for helping bonobo chimps reach their high­
est levels of thinking, as we will see in Chapter 4, as it is for humans. 
The ability of each new baby to produce these signals depends on nur­
turing practices that must be provided anew for each new generation. In 
other words, although our potential for learning is genetically mediated, 
the development of emotional signaling, problem solving, symbol forٗ 
mation, and reflective thinking, that is, our intelligence, is a culturally 
dependent process that is as delicate as it is wondrous. 
In later chapters, we will draw on the mounting evidence that experi­
ence-based learning is an important line of evolution that dates back 
tens of millions of years. Because they are not fixed by biology, however, 
not only do these culturally mediated learning interactions have room 
to improve but they are also vulnerable to regression. In fact, we would 
postulate that the higher the mental level and the more sensitive it is to 
its environment (and, therefore, the more adaptive it is), the more vul­
nerable it is to regression. Perhaps this explains why some lower forms 
of intelligent behavior, such as that found in the cockroach, may help a 
cockroach survive a nuclear holocaust better than would a human be­
ing. Only a human being, however, can cause such a holocaust and fig­
ure out a way to prevent it.

Intellectual Growth and 
Transformations of Emotions 
During the Course of Life 
INTRODUCTION 
Before we explore the transformations of emotions and intelligence 
throughout the course of life, let's take a peek back and try to glimpse 
how emotional interactions and intelligence may have been working to­
gether at a critical stage in the history of intellectual development-the 
Renaissance. On the basis of various biographies and autobiographies, 
and the paintings of the period, historians of childhood have been able 
to identify a number of critical changes occurring in the caregiving prac­
tices during the Renaissance. l  Whereas in the Middle Ages a child was 
swaddled and given relatively little attention when it began to move 
about on its own, and childhood was not really seen as a distinct stage in 
human development,2 childhood was beginning to be seen during the 
Renaissance as a distinct period in human development: a period in 
which the child's mind could be developed with toys and special educa­
tional practices. But, as we have learnt from the case of the Romanian or­
phanages in the twentieth century,3 it takes more than just an interesting 
toy to stimulate a child's mind. Rather, we can envisage how, through 
their affect gesturing, Renaissance caregivers were communicating new 
attitudes and values to their children, even before they could speak. 
In fact, the pictures that are available tend to capture the dynamism 
of human interaction.4 According to our model of human development, 
41

capacities such as critical thinking that characterize the Renaissance 
could not arise from lecturing children or instilling values in them in a 
deliberate and conscious way. Rather, it comes from second-to-second 
and day-to-day interactions which create implicit mastery of this type of 
core capacity. This type of mastery is embedded in the very processes 
the child is challenged to use as part of his day-to-day interactions. 
These processes lead in turn to presymbolic and symbolic capacities and 
later attitudes and values that define the new trait. 
For example, when a 16-month-old toddler explores his mother's ear, 
looking at it, yanking on it a little bit, making interesting gurgling sounds 
of fascination, the mother might simply limit the child with a harsh "Stop 
that!" which throws the child off to do something on their own; or she 
might be fascinated with her toddler's curiosity and signal back to her 
toddler a sense of pride with a warm supportive vocal tone suggesting cu­
riosity and admiration for her toddler's curiosity. She might also lower her 
head to make it easier for him to look in her ear and point to his ear as 
though to show him the similarity. As he touches his own ear, and then 
again touches his mother's ear, acknowledging the similarity, she might 
show him her other ear, and so forth and so on. Through many of these 
back-and-forth "circles of communication," a mother and her curious 
toddler might explore ears and noses, knees and elbows, feet and hands, 
and a symphony of co-constructed affective exploratory interactions. If 
such a toddler developed an attitude and capacity to try to understand his 
world with a capacity for joyful but yet systematic exploration, including 
an uncanny scientific knack for seeing patterns, we wouldn't be surprised. 
In a similar way, when her curious toddler shakes his head "no," exer­
cising the critical prerogative of a toddler, the mother could get angry, 
scaring and squashing a budding critical attitude evidenced in the tod­
dler's experimenting with his first gestural "no"; or she could imitate his 
"no" with an enthusiastic shaking of her own head and then raise her 
arms in puzzlement with a matching facial expression and vocal tones 
that signal "Well, what do you want to do?" As her toddler responds to 
her welcoming gestures to communicate further his needs and wants, he 
might point to a different food or toy than that initially offered. His 
playful mother might then hold up two possible toys, hiding them both 
in her hand and letting him guess which one is in which hand and even­
tually select the one he wants. Here we have a pattern of interaction fa­
cilitating the toddler's ability to exercise his critical faculties and couple

it with discovery as well as intentionality, pattern recognition, and prob­
lem solving, all before he can speak. 
As the child progresses and learns to utter words and use symbols, the 
same types of interactions can play our to foster creative, critical, and sci­
entific thinking at the level of ideas. Therefore, while admittedly speculat­
ing from limited data on the Renaissance, it is nonetheless a reasonable 
speculation to consider that changing child rearing practices facilitated, 
through the processes described above, a much fuller implicit understand­
ing of the world which worked together with the larger social, cultural, 
and intellectual currents in a synergistic fashion to produce the Renais­
sance. The thesis of this book is that such a renaissance occurs in the life 
of each infant and child through the interactions he or she has with re-

sponslve careglvers. 
We will be describing the different stages through which affective 
learning interactions operate a little later on. We will also see how these 
same basic processes of different levels of affective signaling create the 
necessary capacities to understand and collaborate in complex social or­
ganizations during both childhood and adulthood. To understand the 
relationships between emotions and intelligence throughout the course 
of life, it's vital to examine how human beings have thought about this 
relationship over time. 
THE NATURE OF EMOTIONS 
The emotional transformations that support symbol formation and re­
flective thinking continue throughout the course of life, resulting in 
newer levels of intelligence and wisdom. The Western view of human na­
ture and emotions, however, dating back to the ancient Greek philoso­
phers, is that human behavior is governed by two opposing forces: the 
emotions versus Reason. In the modern version of this doctrine, intro­
duced by Descartes, emotions constitute the animal side of human be­
havior: the innate feelings, moods, and mental states that are involuntary 
and automatic. Reason resides in a completely separate realm of the 
mind: the part that is independent from emotions, and that, one hopes, 
comes to govern them. To this day, numerous researchers continue to 
study a child's emotional and intellectual development as if there were a 
bifurcation between these two elements of the human psyche; that is, as 

44 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
if a child's emotional and her cognitive or linguistic development were 
independent and autonomous. 
Recent attempts to develop a scientific theory of emotions have re­
mained tethered to the Cartesian view about the natute and function of 
emotions. Influential theorists such as Sylvan Tomkins, Carroll Izard, 
and Robert Ekman have developed rigorous methodologies for studying 
the facial expressions of emotions, and cognitive neuroscientists such as 
Joseph LeDoux and Daniel Schacter have deepened our understanding 
of the neural processes associated with the primary emotions.5 But the 
basic principles underlying these research programs remain those that 
were enunciated by Descartes. Even Antonio Damasio, a vocal critic of 
Descartes's bifurcation between reason and emotion, has nonetheless re­
mained committed to a Cartesian model of the biological origins and 
functioning of the primary emotions. Although he stresses the influence 
that emotions can have on information processing, he nonetheless sees 
the primary emotions as predetermined phenomena.6 
What, then, are the defining features of this Cartesian model of the 
emotions? Not simply that emotions are "passive," for this thought ex­
isted long before Descartes, dating back to the Stoics. Nor that the feel­
ings associated with emotions are some sort of private mental state, for 
this idea is prominent in the writings of St. Augustine. Nor that there 
are "basic" emotions; this idea can be found in Aristotle. Nor even that 
the basic emotions are indexed by facial expressions that serve predeter­
mined communicative functions, for this idea can be found in the 
Bible. But Descartes introduced a unique slant on all these themes by 
construing the "passivity" of emotions as signifying that they constitute 
a distinct class of involuntary mental states. 
That is, Descartes viewed emotions as complex reflexes that are triggered 
by internal and/or external stimuli. He believed they consisted of distinc­
tive bodily processes and sensations and are associated with characteristic 
behaviors and stereotypical facial expressions.? In the modern version of 
this argument, a "basic" emotion is defined as a complex process consist­
ing of neural, neuromuscular/expressive, and experiential aspects.8 To 
qualify as "basic," the emotion must be associated with a distinctive facial 
expression; with certain body movements and postures; with distinctive 
vocalizations, changes of voice, tone, rhythm, prosody, and stress; and 
with distinctive sensations and chemical changes in the body. 
The two most influential contemporary versions of this argument are 
elaborated by Ekman and Izard (both informed by the work of Sylvan 
InteLLectuaL GroUJth and Transformations of Emotions 
45 
Tomkins).9 Their theories maintain that all the various elements of 
emotional responses are coordinated and controlled by neural pro­
grams. Emotional responses are treated as a composite form of reflex; 
namely, a stimulus triggers a neural program that controls a neuromus­
cular/expressive, autonomic, behavioral, and experiential sequence of 
events. The essential difference between emotions and reflexes proper is 
thus seen as a matter of complexity, that is, of how many different ele­
ments are coordinated. Hence emotional reactions are, as Descartes ar­
gued, unconscious and involuntary, because, like other "automatic 
actions," they operate at a neural/physiological level that is "beneath the 
threshold" of introspection and conscious planning. 
The universality of the basic emotions is explained in psycho­
evolutionary terms as resulting from the selection of these affect pro­
grams, perhaps sometime during the Pleistocene, and possibly earlier. 
Cultural and/or cognitive components are "added on" to basic emo­
tional responses to produce the unique emotional behaviors stressed by 
cultural relativists. 1 0  These basic emotional programs may also be 
"blended" with one another to form new emotions, rather in the way 
that the primary colors can be blended to form new colors. ll But the 
key features of the Cartesian theory of emotions are that (1) the basic 
emotions retain their core features throughout an individual's life, and 
(2) these basic emotions might either facilitate or impede information 
processing, but the development and structure of our cognitive and lin­
guistic faculties are seen as autonomous phenomena. 
There have, of course, been many important behavioral researchers 
and clinicians who have challenged this Cartesian tradition and studied 
the dynamic processes in human development. During the 1 940s, '50s, 
and '60s some of the great theorists of early child development, such as 
Erik Erikson, Anna Freud, Rene Spitz, and John Bowlby, looked at the 
importance of early emotional experiences for subsequent personality 
functioning. 12 The 1960s, '70s, and '80s saw fruitful research on emo­
tional development by Mary Ainsworth, Jerome Bruner, Berry Brazel­
ton, Myron Hofer, Louis Sander, Allen Sroufe, and Dan Stern, all of 
whom made important discoveries about the types of interactive experi­
ences that promote strong attachment and healthy emotional function­
ing and encourage the child's emerging sense of self.l3 
Also highly important was the work done by Robert Emde, Mary Klin­
nert, and Joseph Campos on social referencing. These theorists showed 
that a caregiver's facial expressions of affect could have a powerful effect 

46 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
on the infant's emotional responses to strangers and to physical situa­
tions.14 In a particularly telling experiment, Ed Tronick showed that 
when caregivers assume a still-faced and unresponsive facial expression, 
the infant typically responds by trying to reengage her caregiver with ani­
mated facial expressions, vocalizations, and body movements. When her 
strategy fails, the infant turns away, frowns, and cries.15 As important as 
this research is for our understanding of the socialization of emotional ex­
perience, however, it does not explain how the basic emotions arise from 
early physiological experience, how they then develop and lead to symbols 
and intelligence, and whether intelligence is separate from the ongoing 
pathway of emotional development or an intrinsic landmark of it. 
Campos and his colleagues David Witherington and Matthew 
Hertenstein suggest that emotions can best be understood through the 
adaptive social interactive function they serve for an individual's interac­
tions with her environment.16 Extending these observations, we have 
been able to describe the central role and developmental transforma­
tions of emotions in the formation of many of the mind's most impor­
tant capacmes. 
In the approach we will be describing, an infant (and child) masters a 
number of functional emotional (jIe) developmental capacities. As we ex­
plained in Chapter I, and will explain further in this chapter and subse­
quent ones, the functional emotional developmental model explains 
how emotions enable a child to master symbols; the critical role that 
emotions play in the development of intelligence; how emotions pro­
vide purpose to the mind's different processing capacities, for example, 
motor skills and sensory processing, thus serving as the vehicle through 
which, like the instruments in an orchestra, all the mind's processing 
systems work together in integrated patterns; and how, at subsequent 
levels of transformation, emotions provide the mechanism through 
which social groups form and societies function. Thus, in our fie theory, 
affects play a vastly more important role in the development of the 
mind and society than has hitherto been imagined. They serve as the 
source of symbols, the architect of intelligence, the integrator of pro­
cessing capacities, and the psychological foundation of society. 
In recent years, dynamic systems theorists have begun to shed impor­
tant light on some of these issues. For example, studies by Dan Mes­
singer, Alan Fogel, and Laurie Dickson have found that different smiles 
become associated with different kinds of pleasurable activities, and in-
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
47 
deed, with different kinds of pleasureY There is the pleasure of anticipa­
tion; the pleasure of engagement; the excitement of a particular activity; 
the release from built-up tension (as in tickling) or suspense (as in peek-a­
boo); and, of course, the pleasure of enjoyable sensations. Furthermore, 
the infant experiences the pleasure of observing her caregiver's pleasure 
and of seeing the effects of her own behavior on her caregiver, including 
the effects of her facial expressions on her caregiver's facial expressions. 
And finally, there are the physical sensations that the infant experiences 
concerning the caregiver's own physical state (relaxed, tense, anxious). 
Thus, the significance of an infant's smile cannot be divorced from the 
context in which it occurs. The primary relevant factors here are the in­
fant's state of physiological arousal; the caregiver's emotional state; the 
activity in which the infant is engaged with her caregiver; the environ­
ment in which this activity is taking place; the direction of the infant's 
gaze; other muscular contractions in the infant's face; and the type of 
smile on the caregiver's face. 1 8 All these factors play an important role in 
the type of smiles that the infant develops. The emerging stereotypical 
facial expressions associated with the basic emotions should not, there­
fore, be viewed as a maturational phenomenon; nor should we assume 
that discrete emotions are indexed by discrete facial expressions. 
What is still missing in these enlightening attempts to move beyond 
the Cartesian model of emotions, however, is a dynamic account of how 
the child's basic emotions are formed in the first place and then develop, 
and what the later forms of emotions are and the mechanisms and steps 
in their developmental pathway that make symbols and intelligence 
possible. To answer these questions one of us (S.I.G.) developed, over 
the past twenty-five years, a developmental model that shows, first, how 
the basic emotions arise from physical processes and gradually take on 
signaling and social functions and subjective meaning, and how these 
emotions are then transformed and become a vital source and architect 
of the child's cognitive and linguistic development and the development 
of her higher reflective reasoning abilities. This work is described in the 
1979 monograph Intelligence and Adaptation, and has continued in sub­
sequent works. 19 
We have observed that infants initially experience a limited number 
oB global states, for example, calmness, excitement, and distress. A care­
gIver's nurturing, pleasurable, and calming interactions enable the in­
fant to experience soothing pleasure and interest in the caregiver's 

48 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
sounds and sights and in movements such as turning to look at the care­
giver. In this way, certain emotional proclivities, such as pleasurable in­
terest in soothing sounds, begin to differentiate from these global states. 
As their nervous systems develop, in part because of nurturing interac­
tions, and the capacity to discriminate differences and organize patterns 
develops further, infants begin to further differentiate and elaborate 
these global states. They do this through continuing interactive experi­
ences with their caregivers if the interactions provide enough subtlety 
rather than global reactions. For example, as caregivers respond to their 
infants' interests with their voices and faces using a range of emotional 
expressions (different types of smiles and joyful sounds), we often ob­
serve the infant expressing a range of pleasurable smiles and a deepening 
sense of joy and security. 
Through continuing human interactions of this type, infants associ­
ate more and more specific subjective qualities with selective physical 
sensations. For example, the sound of the voice registers as a sensation, 
but it's also either pleasurable or aversive. Mother's touch is a tactile sen­
sation that also may be soothing or overstimulating and upsetting. 
Every experience that a child undergoes involves this form of dual 
coding; that is, experiences are coded by their physical properties and 
the emotional reactions to them.20 Both these perceptions, the physical 
and the emotional, appear to be coded together. Similarly, a hug feels 
tight and secure or tight and frightening; a surface feels cold and aversive 
or cold and pLeasant; and a mobile looks colorful and interesting or col­
orful and frightening. These emotional reactions can have an almost in­
finite degree of subtle variation so that each person's sense of pleasure or 
security is unique and highly textured. 
In addition, infants and children differ in their basic perceptions of 
sensations. Certain types of touch, sound, or smell, for example, may be 
soothing to one infant and overstimulating to another (i.e., an infant 
may be hyper- or hypo reactive to a given sensation). The same sound­
for example, a violin being played in its upper register-can be stimu­
lating and pleasant for one child and piercing and shrill for another. 
These physical differences, which we have observed both in typically de­
veloping children and in those facing challenges, in turn can also be ex­
perienced with a near-infinite range of subjective affective coloring, 
depending on early caregiver-infant interactions. For example, how a 
caregiver soothes or overreacts to her infant's hypersensitivity to touch 
will influence his subjective experience of that sensation. 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
49 
Thus, as opposed to the Cartesian assumption that every individual 
responds in the same way to the same stimuli, we see that, for endoge­
nous and exogenous reasons, infants' responses to physical sensations 
are in part individual, subjective, and emotional. 
As an infant constructs a subjective emotional world, "experience" 
and physiologic expression continuously influence one another. Subtle 
reading and responding to an infant's emotional cues as part of a recip­
rocal interaction keeps refining her physiologic and emotional experi­
ence and expression. Growing central nervous system organization 
serves to organize and facilitate the expression of ever more complex 
and refined interactive emotional experiences. For example, if an infant 
is hungry and her cries go unheeded, her muscles may tense up, a re­
sponse associated with sensations of discomfort and tension. Through 
infant-caregiver interactions, as described earlier, reactions such as dis­
comfort and tension can become more refined or specific. If the care­
giver responds to these first signs of anger by scolding the child, or by 
coldly withdrawing, the physical sensations and the nascent feeling of 
anger that the child is experiencing may, over time, become bound up 
with feelings of hopelessness or even shame. These feelings may then 
serve to organize and give meaning to a variety of interactive experiences 
accompanied by frustration or discomfort. 
The caregivers' continual reading and responding to the infant's expe­
rience and expression of an emotion makes that emotional experience 
more and more "purposeful"-part of a pattern of purposeful interac­
tion. In this way, emotions become social and affective signals. They be­
come the instrument for problem solving. The continuous flow of 
purposeful interactions leads to complex social patterns. Together with 
increasing central nervous system organization, these complex social in­
teractions enable the toddler to perceive larger and larger patterns. He 
uses this ability to perceive his own physiologic and emotional patterns 
to form organized "subjective" emotional states. At the same time, com­
plex reciprocal emotional interactions are leading to the separation of 
perception from action and the formation of symbols, as described in 
Chapter 1. Once the child forms symbols, that is, can create ideas, he is 
now able to label these perceived emotional patterns. He is, therefore, 
able to experience the world of feelings at a symbolic level. As we will 
discuss in the next sections, this process of emotional signaling that leads 
to symbol formation and the organization of emotional patterns contin­
Ues to develop throughout life and leads to higher and higher levels of 

50 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
mental organization. We will describe the steps or stages in this process 
that lead to new levels of symbolic and reflective thinking,21 
Thus, emotions, which start off as a physiologic system receiving in­
put from the senses, become, through interactive experience, a complex 
social tool and a vehicle for creating internal mental life. We will see 
how emotions eventually serve as the architect of intelligence. 
In this section, we have described various critical early transforma­
tions of emotions: 
1 .  Physical and physiologic reactions become part of the infant's experi­
ence of a nurturing, pleasurable, calming relationship with a caregiver 
(if such a relationship is available). 
2. The relationship makes possible a new range of sensations based on 
human-to-human nurturing interactions. For example, these include a 
type of soothing, intimate, pleasurable sensation that is not available 
from impersonal environmental stimuli. 
3. These types of sensations, or "emotional" experiences, now make it pos­
sible for the infant to doubLe-code experience according to its physical and 
emotional properties; for example, mother's voice registers physically in 
a certain frequency range and "feels" pleasurable, secure, or frightening. 
4. As caregivers respond to the infant's experience and expression of emo­
tion, emotions become more differentiated and purposeful. 
5. As simple back-and-forth patterns of emotional exchange become more 
continuous and complex, they are increasingly used for social signaling 
and interpersonal communication and regulation. 
6. As interactions between caregivers and infants become more complex, the 
infant experiences a wider range of these unique sensations. A growing 
central nervous system, in part supported by these interactions and, in 
part, supportive of them, makes more differentiated interactions possible 
so that the infant improves her capacity to recognize patterns. The ability to 
recognize patterns enables the infant to "make sense" of these emotional 
interactions and begin to experience them as patterns and as part of a de­
veloping sense of self (as will be described more fully later in this chapter). 
7. As these types of co-regulated emotional exchanges continue, they en­
able the separation of perception from action (explained in Chapter 0; 
this in turn leads to symbol formation. 
8. As symbols are formed (described in Chapter 1), a child not only experi­
ences these emotional patterns but labels them according to their "felt" 
characteristics. 
IntellectuaL Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
51 
9. In this way, subjective emotions and feelings differentiate out of early 
physical and physiologic sensations. 
10. The continuation of increasing capacities for emotional signaling and 
symbol formation creates the basis for a progressive series of emotional 
transformations and leads to higher and higher levels of intelligence and 
reflective thinking, as outlined in the stages described below. 
1 1 . Through their progressive transformations, emotions, which can be ex­
perienced in an almost infinite number of subtle variations, can orga­
nize and give meaning to experience. They can, therefore, serve as the 
architect or orchestra leader for the mind's many functions. At each 
stage in the pathway to intelligence, emotions orchestrate cognitive, lan­
guage, motor, sensory, and social experience. 
12. The increasing capacities for emotional signaling also provide the means 
through which social groups form and societies function. 
THE STAGES O F  EMOTIONAL 
AND INTELLECTUAL GROWTH 
In the pages that follow, we map the mysterious and revealing journey 
from an infant's earliest emotional interest in sights and sounds to an 
adult's reflective wisdom. We will observe that, beginning with the dual 
coding described above, each stage of emotional and intellectual growth 
involves the simultaneous mastery of what are ordinarily thought of as 
emotional and cognitive (or intellectual) abilities. 
For example, as we discuss in more detail later, a baby first learns 
"causality" not through pulling a string to ring a bell or other similar be­
havior, as Piaget thought, but through the exchange of emotional signals 
(I smile and you smile back). Therefore, this early lesson is emotional 
and cognitive at the same time. At each stage, new cognitive skills are 
learned from emotional experiences. Even high-level symbolic and reflec­
tive thinking employs emotional awareness as part of its defining charac­
teristics. For example, one of the levels of emotional development we will 
discuss later involves reflective thinking based upon an internal standard 
and sense of self At this level, an individual can reflect and say, for exam­
ple, ''I'm angrier than I should be in this situation." Such an individual 
can also compare two authors and their treatment of an abstract concept, 
such as love or justice, in relationship to her own evolving experience of 
these concepts. She might observe that one author is far more insightful 

52 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
than another in exploring the complexity of "justice" in a situation of 
competing motives. 
To grasp concepts such as justice or love, however, or for that matter 
to understand the motives of a character in a novel, a person needs to 
have an internal sense of "self." Without a sense of self, there is no stable 
internal compass or frame of reference upon which to compare, con­
trast, or make judgments. It is not by chance that this sense of self be­
comes more organized and complex as the capacity for reflective 
thinking and making judgments about one's own behavior and thoughts 
and comparing them to the perspectives of others is emerging. The sense 
ofse/fis the agent of these judgments. As it further develops during the 
course of life, it enables an individual to observe, comprehend, and re­
flect on an ever widening view of the world. In contrast, no matter how 
strong one's memory, language abilities, or calculating skills, if one has a 
very rigid sense of self and personality, he will "see" and comprehend 
only a narrow piece of the world and draw very limited conclusions. As 
we will see in the sections that follow, our emotions and sense of self in­
fluence our "awareness," what we are consciously able to grapple with 
and attempt to comprehend. It influences the depth of our understand­
ing and ultimately our intelligence and wisdom. 
Therefore, memory and selected cognitive skills, which can peak dur­
ing the early adult years, may be sufficient for mathematical work, but 
it's difficult to be "fully intelligent" without experiencing deeply and 
profoundly the full range of many of life's essential, emotional experi­
ences, such as love, disappointment, and competition. These unfold 
gradually in a variety of contexts throughout life. Therefore, true intelli­
gence, such as wisdom, develops only over time. If we're fortunate, it 
does so throughout our lives. As we pointed out earlier, our genes are a 
key element in a biological system that prepares us to respond to and 
learn from experiences, but specific types of interactive emotional expe­
riences are needed for the development of symbols, concepts, and ab­
stract thinking. There are no known biological mechanisms that can 
fully account for the "meaningful" use of ideas. The description that fol­
lows of the stages of emotional and intellectual growth will demonstrate 
the seamless relationship between emotional and cognitive experience. 
We emphasize that as we describe the stages of emotional interac­
tions, we will also be describing and defining emotions in a particular 
way. We will not be looking simply at when a child smiles, frowns, 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
53 
shoWS a look of surprise, or expresses feelings such as happiness or sad­
ness. We will instead be looking at the child's overall emotional abilities, 
such as her ability to engage with others and exchange emotional signals 
so that she can understand others and communicate her own needs, her 
ability to elaborate emotions in play and with words and pictures, and 
her level of empathy. 
These overall emotional abilities can incorporate different feelings 
such as anger, love, and sadness. For example, fully engaging with others 
involves love as well as sadness or disappointment. Full imaginative play 
involves happiness and joy as well as anger. These overall emotional 
abilities are "functional" in that they enable the child to interact with 
and comprehend her world. Therefore, in earlier writings we have called 
these abilities Functional Emotional Developmental Capabilities. 
These abilities are functional in another sense as well. They orches­
trate many of the child's other developmental capabilities. For example, 
as a child is learning to signal with emotions in the first year of life, she 
is using her emotions to determine whether to reach-that is, she uses 
her motor system and muscles-as well as what she vocalizes about: one 
sound for "I like that" and another for "I don't like that." As indicated, 
back-and-forth emotional signaling establishes a sense of causality-an 
early cognitive skill: "I can make my mommy smile with my smile." 
Emotions also lead the child to search for and find the hidden toy in 
her mommy's hand. She will search only for a desirable toy. Such 
searching and finding leads to perceptual motor and visual-spatial 
problem-solving skills. From early on, therefore, the infant's emotions 
orchestrate many parts of her "mental team." Her emotions enable the 
"members" of her mental team to work together, much as the members 
of a wonderful ballet company or an outstanding basketball team work 
together. Therefore, the emotional stages we will be describing are the 
"overall emotional abilities," or Functional Emotional Developmental 
Capabilities, which are different from specific emotions such as joy or 
anger. They are fundamental emotional organizations that guide every 
a٘pect of day-to-day functioning, unite the different processing abili­
ties, and, as we will show in Chapter 1 1, orchestrate the different parts 
of the mind. 
As We will see, these emotional abilities build on one another. For ex­
:UUple, a baby must be engaged in a relationship with a caregiver for lov­
Ing feelings to become part of an emotional exchange of signals. Using 

54 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
emotional ideas-"I feel sad"-precedes building logical bridges be­
tween emotional ideas: "I feel sad because you didn't play with me." 
Emotional abilities and stages may be only partially mastered. When 
this occurs, emotional development may still proceed, but in a con­
stricted form. Like a house with a weak foundation, constricted emo­
tional development may be more vulnerable to a "strong wind," or less 
broadly mastered. For example, relationships may be more superficial 
and less intimate, and empathy for other people's feelings limited only 
to selected feelings. The functional emotional developmental capacities 
we will be describing below, which begin early in life and continue 
through the course of life, are mastered at various times as a human be­
ing develops. Through a field study, we have been able to show that the 
early capacities are mastered for the first time (and then continue to be 
further developed) during specific, predicted time intervals. Further­
more, we have shown that the mastery of the early capacities is associ­
ated with healthy intellectual, social, and emotional functioning. In 
contrast, compromises in their mastery are associated with developmen­
tal and emotional difficulties,22 
In the next sections, as we describe the stages of emotional and intel­
lectual growth, remember that these are but brief descriptions of more 
complex processes-the "tip of the iceberg." In addition, in actual de­
velopment, mental growth is continuous and is "categorized" only for 
purposes of description and discussion. 
Stage I-Regulation and Interest in the World 
Within the first few months of life, babies are learning to transform their 
emotions from their own inner sensations (e.g., focusing on a gas bubble 
in the tummy) to the outer world. They are learning to perceive the 
outer world-a mother's and father's face, voice, smells, and touch. But 
to perceive the outer world, they must want to look or listen. Although 
perhaps born with a tendency to perceive some basic patterns, they are 
enticed by the emotional rhythm of our voices, our big smiles and 
gleaming eyes-interesting sounds and sights. Rhythmic, almost syn­
chronous patterns between the caregiver's and infant's movements or vo­
calizations enable the infant to begin relating to and appreciating the 
outside world. These patterns, which are part of the emotional relation-
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
55 
ship between an infant and caregiver, begin prenatally. The mother-to-be 
relates to her baby's movement patterns and responses to sounds and 
other sensations, not to mention her fantasies about the new baby. The 
birth process itself and the time immediately after birth can be especially 
meaningful. Marshall Klaus and John Kennell have described how, when 
mother and baby are allowed to spend time together with direct physical 
contact immediately after birth (and an anesthesia has not been used), 
babies often crawl up their mothers' tummies to find the breast right af­
ter birth.23 Such direct physical and emotional contact appears to have 
both physiologic and emotional benefit, resulting in less crying and im­
proved mother/infant interaction in the early months oflife,24 
During these early months of parent and baby interactions, babies 
gradually become more and more interested in sights, touch, and 
sounds, and begin discriminating between what they see, hear, smell, and 
touch. To elicit a baby's interest in the outer world, the sensations care­
givers provide have to be emotionally pleasurable. If they are aversive, ba­
bies tune out or shut down and don't become invested in what is outside 
themselves. However, each baby has individual ways of responding to 
sound, sight, touch, smell, and movement. Some babies are very sensitive 
and require gentle soothing. Some are underreactive and require more 
energetic wooing. Some babies begin to figure out patterns of sights or 
sounds quickly; some slowly. Some readily turn toward sound or sights, 
but others take a while to notice. These responses happen more readily if 
adults tailor their approaches to each infant based on her individual pref­
erences and abilities. Therefore, even at this first and most basic stage of 
learning, the baby depends on a caregiver's ability to adapt her gaze, 
voice, and movements in a pleasurable, emotionally satisfYing manner to 
the baby's unique way of responding to and taking in the world. 
Intelligence is forming during the very first stage as a baby is learning 
to use all her senses to perceive the world and discriminate patterns, 
such as the difference between mother's voice and father's voice. 
The Dual Code. 
fu we shall see, emotions orchestrate this process from 
the very beginning. A baby can begin the lifelong task of learning about 
t?e world only through the materials at hand, which, initially, are the 
ɻlmplest of sensations, such as touch and sound. Years of investigation 
Into initial perceptions and cognition, on the one hand, and emotional 
development on the other, have left out a vital connection. In our clinical 

56 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
work with many infants-both typically developing and facing chal­
lenges-we observed that each sensation, as it is registered by the child, 
also gives rise, as we said earlier, to an affect or emotion;25 that is to say, 
the infant responds to it according to its emotional as well as physical ef­
fect on her. Thus, a blanket may feel smooth and pleasant or itchy and ir­
ritating; a toy may be brilliantly red and intriguing or boring, a voice 
loud and inviting or jarring. Mom's cheek might feel soft and wonderful 
or rough and uncomfortable. As a baby's experience grows, sensory im­
pressions become increasingly tied to feelings. This dual coding of experi­
ence is the key to understanding how emotions organize intellectual 
abilities and indeed create the sense of self. 
Human beings begin this coupling of phenomena and feelings at the 
very beginning of life. Even infants only days old react to sensations emo­
tionally, preferring the sounds and smells of their mothers, for example, 
to all other voices and scents. They suck more vigorously when offered 
sweet liquids that taste good. Older babies will joyfully pursue certain fa­
vorite people with their eyes and avoid others. By four months, children 
can react to the sight and sound of people who have scared them. 
However, as we said earlier, a given sensation does not necessarily pro­
duce the same emotion in every individual. Inborn differences in peoples' 
sensory makeup can make the sound of a given frequency and loud­
ness-say, a high-pitched voice-strike one person as rousing and ap­
pealing, but another as shrill, like a siren. Though we generally assume 
that we all experience sensations-such as sound and touch-in more or 
less the same way, significant variations are now known to exist in the 
ways individuals process even very simple sensory information. We have 
explored the emotional consequences of those sensory differences first 
described by Jean Ayres, a pioneer in occupational therapy.26 A given sen­
sation can produce quite different emotional effects in different individu­
als-pleasure, for example, in one person, bur anxiety in another. Each of 
us, therefore, quite unwittingly creates our own personal, and sometimes 
idiosyncratic, "catalogue" of sensory and emotional experience. 
To add further complexity and individuality to the young child's learn­
ing, each of her sensory experiences occurs within the context of a rela­
tionship that gives it additional emotional meaning. Nearly all her 
emotional experiences involve the persons on whom she depends totally 
for her very survival, and who care for her in a manner that can range 
from expansive nurturing to near-total neglect. Emotions help a child 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
57 
comprehend even what appear to be physical and mathematical relation­
ships. Simple notions such as hot or cold, for example, may appear to rep­
resent purely physical sensations, but a child learns them through 
experiencing baths and bottles. More complex perceptions-big or little, 
more or less, here and there-have a similar basis in feelings. "A lot" 
is more than a child expected. "Too little" is less than expected. "More" is 
another helping of something tasty, "no more" is a dose of nasty medicine. 
"Near" is snuggling next to mother. "Later" means impatient waiting. 
Even abstract, intellectual concepts, those that underlie theoretical 
scientific speculations, also reach back to a child's felt experience. Math­
ematicians and physicists may manipulate abstruse symbols represent­
ing space, time, and quantity, but they first understood those entities as 
tiny children wanting a far-away toy, or waiting for juice, or counting 
cookies. The grown-up genius, like the adventurous child, forms ideas 
through playful explorations in the imagination, only later translated 
into the rigor of mathematics. Before a child can count, she must pos­
sess this kind of emotional grasp of quantity and extent. When we 
worked with children facing developmental problems who could none­
theless count, and even calculate, we found that numbers and compu­
tations lacked meaning for them unless we created an emotional 
experience of quantity by negotiating over pennies or candies. 
Each sensory perception therefore forms parr of a dual code that has 
physical properties (bright, big, loud, smooth, and the like) and emo­
tional qualities (soothing, jarring, happy, tense). This double coding al­
lows the child not only to "cross-reference" each experience and 
subsequent memory in mental "catalogues" of phenomena and feelings 
but also to reconstruct them when needed. 
Anyone who pays attention to the subjective state of her body will al­
most always perceive within it an emotional tone, though it may often 
be subtle, elusive, or hard to describe. Our inner emotional tones, tense 
or relaxed, hopeful or glum, serene or anxious, constantly play out the 
countless variations that we use to label and organize and store and re­
trieve and, most important of all, make sense of our experience. 
We use our entire bodies to create, express, and bring to life our emo­
tions: the voluntary muscle systems of our faces, arms, and legs for 
smiles, frowns, slumps, and waves, as well as the involuntary muscles of 
the gut and internal organs-a thumping heart or a stomach full of "but­
terRies." Emotions such as excitement and delight reside primarily in the 

58 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
voluntary system; others, including fear, sexual pleasure, longing, and 
grief, reside mostly in the involuntary system. Some global emotions, for 
example, "fight or flight," belong to portions of the nervous system 
formed early in evolution. Those involved in emotional social reciptocity 
and that make symbol formation and thinking possible belong to more 
recently evolved parts of the nervous system and rely on many parts of 
the brain working together, including the highest levels of the cortex. 
In the earliest days and weeks, as a baby becomes aware of the world 
of sensation, a sense of "self" also emerges, but it is not yet a separate 
entity. The self is part of a global sense of the world of sensation and 
feelings. 
Consciousness is also developing. It is likely that a baby's earliest sense 
of consciousness is a global state of sensory and affective "aliveness" (i.e., 
sensations and their registration in the broadest sense define conscious­
ness). The baby's experience of consciousness is linked to the sights, 
sounds, touch, and, one hopes, pleasurable feelings she is experiencing. 
Stage 2-Engaging and Relating 
The second stage involves helping a baby use her emotional interest in 
the world to form a relationship and become engaged in it. With warm 
nurturing, the baby now becomes progressively more invested and in­
terested in certain people. No longer will just any face or smell do. It has 
to be the mother's face or smell. From day one, the baby begins distin­
guishing primary caregivers from others; from two to five months, this 
ability reaches a crescendo through joyful smiles and coos and a deep 
sense of pleasurable intimacy. 
In addition, higher levels of learning and intelligence depend on sus­
tained relationships that build trust and intimacy. This progress involves 
more than simply fulfilling concrete needs. The concrete person who 
just wants "things" never becomes a fully reflective thinker in life's most 
important areas. For example, if we look at other people just as "things," 
we will not understand how they think and feel. Understanding others 
and feeling empathy for them comes from investing other human be­
ings with one's own feelings. This ability, however, begins with first rela­
tionships. It depends on nurturing care that creates a sense of intimacy. 
When a baby becomes interested in her primary caregiver as a special 
person who brings her joy and pleasure, as well as a little annoyance and 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
59 
unhappiness, it is not only emotional interactions that begin flowering. 
A new level of intelligence is also reached. She is now learning to dis­
criminate the joys and pleasures of the human world from her interests 
of the inanimate world. Her joy and pleasure in her caregivers enables 
her to decipher patterns in their voices. She begins to discriminate their 
emotional interests, such as joy, indifference, and annoyance. She begins 
to figure out facial expressions as well. Thus begins the long journey of 
learning to recognize patterns and organize perceptions into meaningful 
categones. 
In forming a deeper, more intimate relationship, the baby is also 
learning her first lessons in becoming a social being, the cornerstone of 
being part of a family, group, or community, as well as, eventually, a cul­
ture and a society. Also, the baby's sense of self and consciousness is 
moving forward. Now that she is discriminating the human and inani­
mate worlds, the infant goes from feeling a part of a global world of sen­
sations to a sense of "shared humanity." There is no separate, defined 
sense of "self" yet, but from shared intimacy with caregivers, a growing 
sense of special "human" feelings is emerging. 
Stage 3-Intentionality 
The third stage goes beyond intimacy and engagement. As we saw in 
Chapter 1, emotions now become transformed into signals for commu­
nication. For this to happen, however, caregivers need to read and re­
spond to the baby's signals and challenge the baby to read and respond to 
theirs. Through these interactions, the baby begins to engage in back­
and-forth emotional signaling. We also describe this back-and-forth sig­
naling, which develops throughout infancy, but especially rapidly 
between four and ten months, as opening and closing circles of commu­
nication. The six-month-old smiles eagerly at her mother, gets a smile 
back, then smiles again. By smiling again, the baby is closing a circle of 
c?mmunication. Different motor gestures-facial expressions, vocaliza­
tions-become part of this signaling. By eight months, many of these ex­
ٙhanges occur in a row. As we saw, these emotional interactions help an 
mfant to begin separating perceptions from their fixed actions. 
Therefore, intelligence during this stage reaches an important new 
level. The beginnings of "causal" (logical) interactions, as the baby pur­
Posefully smiles to get a smile back, vocalizes happiness to get a happy 

60 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
sound back, and reaches for father's nose to get a funny "toot-toot" 
sound back, means that from now on, causaliry and logic can play a role 
in all new learning. For example, these new lessons in logic are gradually 
applied to the spatial world as well as to plan actions (motor planning). 
When the rattle falls to the ground, the baby follows it with his eyes as 
though he were looking for it. He looks at and touches his father's hand 
because it just hid his rattle. The beginning sense of causaliry marks a be­
ginning sense of "realiry" because an appreciation of realiry is based on 
understanding the actions of others as purposeful rather than random. 
A sense of self also now becomes more defined. There is a "me" doing 
something to a "not me" or a "you." (The baby smiles [the "me"] to get a 
smile back from the caregiver [the "not me"] .) But the "me" and the "not 
me" are not yet defined in the baby's mind as full persons. They are de­
fined only in terms of the smiles or sounds being exchanged. In other 
words, "parts" of "me" (the self) that become involved in causal inten­
tional interactions are forming. Each part of "me," or a self, is experi­
enced as a separate entiry. In the next stage, these parts of the self will 
come together. Consciousness is also growing. The baby experiences her 
own willfulness and sense of purpose more and more. Her consciousness 
of herself and of the world is gradually separating the physical world 
from the emotional world, the "me" from the "not me," and a sense of 
will, purpose, or agency from a sea of sensations, feelings, and responses. 
Stage 4-Problem Solving, Mood 
Regulation, and a Sense of Self 
In the explosive development that takes place between nine and eighteen 
months, a baby makes momentous strides. As we described in Chapter 1, 
she learns to engage in a continuous flow of emotional signaling and can 
use this abiliry to solve problems. For example, she may take her mother 
by the hand, gesture with her eyes and hands so that her mother will 
open the door to the yard, and then point to the swing; or she takes her 
dad to the car and shows him that she wants a ride. During this stage, 
true social problem solving emerges. As indicated earlier, however, care­
givers need to read and respond to their toddlers' emotional signals and 
engage in long chains of shared social problem solving for this to occur. 
She also learns to regulate her moods and behavior and perceive and or-
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
61 
ganize patterns to form a more complete sense of self. All this progress, 
which is built on increasingly elaborate emotional interactions, leads to 
higher levels of intelligence and social interaction. 
Problem Solving. 
During this fourth stage, through a wide range of 
emotional interactions that are part of daily life, a child learns how to 
predict patterns of adult behavior and act accordingly. She learns, for 
example, that when her father comes home and looks grumpy, it's best 
to stay out of his way. Hide behind the couch or he will snap at you. 
The child learns that before her mother has had her morning coffee, 
she'd better walk and talk softly. These savvy adaptations are based on, 
and facilitate, an ability to recognize patterns. Pattern recognition, 
which ideally is learned first through social interactions, can then be ap­
plied to solve problems in the physical world as well. 
The child who doesn't interact, however, won't experience or fully 
learn to recognize a broad range of patterns. The child who is taking a 
parent by the hand to search for a toy is coming to understand the ele­
ments of a pattern. These include her own emotional needs (what she 
wants), the action patterns involved in finding a toy, the visual-spatial 
patterns involved in going from ground level to upper-shelf level where 
the toy resides, the vocal pattern involved in attracting her father's at­
tention (whimpers at not having what she wants, then gleeful exclama­
tions of triumph), and the social patterns involved in working together 
with parents toward a common goal. In other words, pattern recogni­
tion involves seeing how the pieces fit together rather than just being in­
volved in piecemeal behavior. Elaborate negotiations or play with others 
make it possible to experience the world in larger integrated patterns. 
Recognizing patterns helps a toddler predict the behavior of others 
and adjust her own. She learns when to expect loving responses and 
when to expect anger, control, bossiness, or limit-setting. The child's 
moods respond to seeing the gleam in a parent's eye or the nodding ap­
proval for something well done. She's learning what respect feels like­
as well as what humiliation feels like when she's done something she 
shouldn't. All these patterns are learned in the second year of life and 
before language comes in to a significant degree. 
Regulating Mood and Behavior. 
In the daily loving exchanges and 
struggles with caregivers, the toddler learns to tame such catastrophic 

62 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
emotions as fear and rage (as described in Chapter 1) with the more regu­
lated and interactive use of emotions. Therefore, she learns to modulate 
and finely regulate her behavior and moods and cope with intense feeling 
states. Anger is explosive in a very young infant, and sadness seems to last 
forever and ever. Certain necessary experiences turn these extreme emo­
tional reactions into feelings and behavior that are finely regulated and re­
sponsive to the situation at hand. 
Once a child is capable of exchanging rapid signals with her caregiver, 
she is able to negotiate, in a sense, how she feels. If she is annoyed, she 
can make a look of annoyance or a sound or a hand gesture. A mother 
may come back with a gesture indicating "I understand" or "OK, I'll get 
the food more quickly," or "Can't you wait just one more minute?" 
Whatever her response, the child is receiving immediate feedback that 
can modulate her own response. The anger may be modulated by the 
notion that mother is going to do something, even if she can't do it im­
mediately. Just the sound of her voice signals that she is getting that 
milk bottle ready and it's coming soon. If she can use a soothing voice 
and gradually calm the baby or toddler, the child will learn not to be­
come so frantic. Adults often do this intuitively when someone they are 
close to is upset or angry. Some of us get nervous, however, and "up the 
stakes" by taking the other person's anger personally. If we can slow and 
soothe and calm via our emotional gestures (as well as our words-the 
gestures, however, are far more powerful), we can learn to better and 
better regulate our moods and behavior. 
With a fine-tuned reaction rather than one that is global or extreme, 
the child doesn't have to throw a tantrum to register her annoyance; she 
can do it with just a glance and an annoyed look. This ability comes 
gradually. Even if a toddler does escalate to a real tantrum, she will not 
go from 0 to 60 in one second. Different feelings, from joy and happi­
ness to sadness to anger to assertiveness, can become part of fine-tuned 
exchanges with patient, caring adults. 
A child may not gain this needed experience of nurturing exchanges 
for a variety of reasons. Perhaps she has a motor problem and can't ges­
ture or signal well, or maybe she has an unresponsive parent who is not 
signaling back. Perhaps she has a parent who is too intrusive and anx­
ious or too self-absorbed or depressed to respond appropriately. For any 
one of these reasons, we may see a compromise in this fine-tuned inter­
active system. For such a child, there are insufficienr regulated responses 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
63 
for her emotional expressions. Her expression of feeling is, therefore, 
not part of a fine-tuned regulated signaling system: It may be simply an 
isolated expression of feeling. 
Without the modulating influence of an emotional interaction, 
either the child's feeling may grow more intense or she may give up and 
become self-absorbed or passive. In either situation, the child may be 
left using the global feelings of anger or rage, fear or avoidance, which 
are characteristic of very young infants in the early months of life. One 
of us (S.I.G.) often sees such children in his practice. Not infrequently, 
when such children continually hit or bite, parents seek help, worried 
about "aggression," and often ask for "medication." When parents are 
coached on how to read the child's signals, respond consistently and 
calmly, and engage in long chains of regulated social problem solving, 
however, within a few months many of these children can become well­
regulated, cooperative, interactive toddlers. 
If, on the other hand, caregivers continue to respond inappropriately 
or not at all, the child can become even more vulnerable. With care­
givers who overreact to powerful emotions, a child often tends to be­
come more anxious and fearful. When caregivers tune out, freeze, or 
withdraw in response to fierce anger or other strong emotions from 
their infants and toddlers, the child may feel a sense of "loss"; this, in 
turn, may lead to an increased tendency to depression. When anger or 
impulsive behavior is dealt with by withdrawal or single intense puni­
tive, rather than regulating constructive, limit-setting responses and op­
portunities for social problem solving, we tend to see more aggression 
and impulsivity. 
Fonning the Earliest (Presymbolic) Sense of "Self" A sense of self be­
gins forming when a baby organizes her emotions and behavior into 
patterns. As a baby goes from islands of intentional behavior, such as a 
few vocalizations or one or two hand wavings or a few smiles, to a whole 
pattern of dozens of exchanges, which she uses to solve problems, she is 
learning that she and others can operate in larger chunks or patterns. 
This enables her to be even more intentional and to negotiate, rather 
than take piecemeal, episodic action. 
This process happens step-by-step. When an adult responds recipro­
cally, the baby makes a discovery: "I can make something happen." This 
teaches a baby to take initiative (do something and something happens 

64 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
in return; smiling gets a smile from mom or dad). As we indicated, from 
this process the infant is beginning to gain a sense of purpose and will 
and, very importantly, a sense of "self" (it's "me" making something hap­
pen, "me" getting that smile or getting that little red rattle by reaching 
out "my" hand). As a toddler's repertoire of emotional signaling grows 
richer and she begins to discern patterns in her own and others' behavior, 
she adds these observations to the map delineating herself as a person. 
Her mother usually responds when she makes friendly requests, but not 
when she's cranky. Her father loves to roughhouse, but not to sing lulla­
bies. Grandmother is a good deal less strict than either parent. Which ac­
tions get affection and approval? Which yield only rejection or anger? Is 
she worthy of care, attention, and respect? Are those around her also 
worthy? 
With the growing capacity to perceive and organize patterns, these 
types of experiences continue to define a developing sense of self even 
before words or ideas are used to a significant degree. In a similar way, 
the child is discovering how the physical world works-turning this lit­
tle plastic thing causes a funny animal to pop up, or pushing this · big, 
smooth, see-through object makes a loud noise and maybe even pro­
duces a splatter of little pieces and yelling from adults. Seeing the world 
in patterns increases understanding of how it works and leads to expec­
tations and mastery, a scientific attitude. 
The child uses this ability to discriminate, to distinguish among 
many patterns of emotions; she knows the difference between those 
meaning safety and comfort and those meaning danger. She can tell ap­
proval from disapproval, acceptance from rejection. Life's most essential 
emotional themes are identified and patterns of dealing with them 
formed. The child also begins to use this new ability in increasingly 
complicated situations. Is her mother's tense face a signal that she is an­
gry with her daughter? The child starts to use this awareness to respond 
to people according to their emotional tones, for example, and to pull 
away from a situation that seems undermining. 
The intuitive ability to decipher human exchanges and pick up emo­
tional cues before any words have been exchanged becomes a "super­
sense" that often operates faster than our conscious awareness. In fact, it 
is the foundation of our social life. 
Therefore, long before an infant can speak, personality and expecta­
tions are already being molded by the countless interactions between 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
65 
caregiver and child. However, no child's family or daily life affords 
equal interactions in all areas of experience. We may have many differ­
ent responses to love and pleasure and only two to anger, or vice versa. 
Some families avoid certain emotions entirely. No child's environment 
is perfect, and parents who try too hard to provide one often quash 
the emotional spontaneity that is so critical to the entire process of 
development. 
It is also important to remember that the developments of this form­
ative period, though influential, are not definitive. Many elements of 
personality form early in life, but daily interaction continuously rede­
fines it. 
The basic skills that enable a child to read caregivers' and family 
members' signals also enable her to learn about her culture. The re­
sponses of her caregivers provide an unspoken but expressive running 
commentary along a scale of approval! disapproval, anger/happiness, cu­
riosity/fear. Is defiance permissible? Is aggression or passivity sanc­
tioned? How do people greet each other? Picking up cues from this 
subtext, the child learns before she has gained significant amounts of 
verbal language and knows what is good and bad, what is done and not 
done, what is acceptable and unacceptable. 
During this period, co-regulated emotional signaling also has a role in 
gender differences. Our work observing very early interaction suggests 
that these differences may not be based solely on hormones or different 
brain structures. Learning experiences vary early in life and lead to im­
portant questions. For example, we have observed that many caregivers 
tend to engage female infants and toddlers in longer preverbal, affective 
"conversations" than boys. Does this contribute to girls developing ear­
lier language skills, and perhaps empathy, than boys? The longer we ges­
ture and signal back and forth to babies, the more we enable them to 
signal and negotiate with a large range of our emotions. Of course, indi­
vidual girls and boys vary considerably in their early experiences. Each 
one will have his or her own unique early interactions and eventual per­
sonalities. As a large group, however, boys tend to be more active as ba­
bies and, therefore, invite shorter bursts of affective signaling. In our 
culture, we often play differently with boys and girls, more roughhousing 
with boys and more back-and-forth dialogues with little girls. 
Is it any surprise that a child with more extensive early experience in 
navigating her emotional terrain will grow up better able to express how 

66 
T H E  F I R S T  I D E A 
she feels? Or that a child who tends to experience shorter emotional inter­
changes might develop some of the characteristics we think of as typically 
"male," such as an inability to acknowledge his feelings, the strong desire 
to separate his emotional world from his rational one, or even the disturb­
ing "all-or-nothing" discharge mode for these feelings, such as rage or 
withdrawal? At the same time, the action orientation and roughhousing 
may provide an opportunity to feel secure with his body and learn to be 
assertive and able to overcome obstacles. 
It's important to emphasize, however, that as we speculate about the 
role of early interactions in the behavior we commonly think of as "male" 
or "female," each child and his or her caregivers will negotiate their own 
unique patterns. Therefore, each boy and girl can be understood only in 
terms of his or her unique history. During Stage 4, the toddler progresses 
to significantly higher levels of intelligence. Because of her emerging 
ability for long exchanges of signaling, she is becoming a better and bet­
ter problem solver. Also, because growing problem-solving abilities 
involve signaling between herself and others, she is involved in an in­
creasingly creative endeavor encompassing the input of two or more par- , 
ties. For example, she may want to solve a problem one way and her 
father may gesture with a point, a puzzled look, or a big smile, suggesting 
either confirmation or an alternative. Through these types of interactions 
involving longer and longer chains of communication, new approaches 
are constantly being learned. 
The toddler is breaking new ground in all her different intellectual 
domains. More complex vocalizations are emerging. A private language 
may be forming as a prelude to learning the family's language. With her 
caregivers as interactive partners/explorers, a more elaborate sense of 
physical space and an ability to engage in visual-spatial problem solving 
(such as finding hidden objects or figuring out a new way to get to a toy 
on the shelf or mother's favorite jewelry) is rapidly emerging. This oc­
curs because physical space is now invested with emotional meaning 
through the pursuit of emotional goals. 
Similarly, the ability to plan and sequence actions-conducting a 
five-step maneuver with a new truck (loading and unloading it, moving 
it to one side of the room and then the other)-is also rapidly learned 
because of interactive play where emotional goals are used to guide ac­
tions. As discussed earlier, the toddler is also learning to regulate her 
mood and behaviors better because of interactive emotional signaling 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
67 
and, in this way, is also learning to modulate sensations. She is no 
longer as likely to become sensory overloaded or underaroused because 
she is now able to participate actively in the sensations modulating her. 
For example, she can seek out just a bit more sound or touch. She can 
slow down an interaction through her expressions, hand gestures, or 
body posture if it's becoming overloading. 
As the toddler becomes an interactive problem solver in all these do­
mains, she is literally becoming a multilevel, scientific thinker, figuring 
out and implementing new solutions all the time. This progress, in 
turn, makes her a better and better "pattern recognizer" and organizer, 
an ability that will underlie all her future academic skills. 
Many infant observers and researchers focus on the first year of life 
and then jump to a focus on language development in the latter part of 
the second and third years of life. In fact, it's in the second year of life 
that emotional signaling becomes more and more complex and sets the 
foundations for language and higher levels of intelligence through the ac­
complishments just described. As we described in Chapter 1, it is during 
this time that a toddler is learning to use affect signaling to separate per­
ception from action. This leads to freestanding images that the toddler 
can invest with emotional experiences. Such emotionally meaningful, 
freestanding images become meaningful ideas or internal symbols. 
New social skills are also developing at this stage. Social signaling en­
ables the toddler to handle multiple relationships at the same time, signal­
ing a mischievous grin to her father and an annoyed look at her mother. 
Reading these emotional signals is also part of this process and it helps the 
toddler inhibit aggression, cooperate, and copy altruistic behaviors. 
The ability to imitate also advances significantly. Now the toddler 
can copy large patterns, such as putting on her father's hat, lifting his 
briefcase, and imitating him as he walks about the house with a confi­
dent stride. As can be readily imagined, these abilities for social negotia­
tion, multiple relationships, and rapid learning of whole patterns 
through imitation are the foundations for participating in groups. We 
have observed toddlers forming friendships by copying each other, fol­
lOWing each other, enjoying some rough-and-tumble play together, and 
eventually, by eighteen months of age or so, hamming it up together 
and laughing at and with each other. Shared humor communicated via 
facial expressions and movements can become quite organized.27 Ini­
tially, there is the family group and then a community, a society, and a 

68 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
culture. Everything from simple tool use to attitudes towards aggression 
or closeness and intimacy are learned through complex interactive sig­
naling and imitative learning. 
Also, as we mentioned, long chains of signaling enable the presymbolic 
sense of self to become more integrated. Consciousness is, therefore, not 
simply made up of a "part me" (a smile getting a smile or a sound getting 
a sound). It's now made up of a more integrated sense of "me" as a whole 
person interacting with a more integrated sense of another (mother or fa­
ther) as whole people. In other words, the happy "me" and the angry "me" 
are now part of one person, as are the "nice mommy" and the "frustrating 
or mean mommy." This greater integration of the parts of "me" and oth­
ers occurs very gradually during the second year of life. During this time, 
islands of "me" gradually come together through longer and longer inter­
actions with caregivers that embrace such polarities of feelings as anger 
and love. Consciousness also expands to include larger and larger physical 
spaces, as well as language and motor domains. 
This stage of development figures importantly in the observations we 
have made regarding the developmental pathways leading to autism. As 
we will discuss in Chapter 1 1, children with autism (even those who de­
velop verbal abilities, score above average on IQ tests, and do well on 
school-based academic work) have difficulties with making inferences; us­
ing higher-level, abstract, reflective thinking; empathizing with others; 
and dealing with their own and other people's emotions. In studying such 
children over time and exploring their histories and videotapes of their in­
teractions during their formative years, we have found that the vast major­
ity, even those who seemed to be doing well and "regressed" only at age 
two or later, did not fully master these emotional interactions of the sec­
ond year of life and the skills that are based on them. Although some of 
the children could engage with caregivers and signal a little with emotions, 
they did not reach the point where they could take a caregiver to find a toy 
or engage in long exchanges or wordless dialogues of affective interaction 
to regulate their behavior and mood. They were, therefore, unable to de­
velop the full range of higher-level abilities. For example, using symbols 
meaningfully and negotiating emotional and social challenges require in­
vesting symbols with regulated emotions ("Mom" is understood as the to­
tal of one's emotional experiences with one's mother). This development 
can occur only through many emotional interchanges with mother. Simi­
larly, empathy requires a full sense of another as an emotional "other" and 
Intellectual Growth and Transformatiom of Emotions 
69 
can only be learned through the same process. In contrast, math or history 
facts can be learned largely by memorizing them. 
We have formulated a theory, the Afect Diathesis Hypothesis,28 which 
suggests that in autism co-regulated affect signaling is difficult because of 
a unique biological challenge. Children with autism, we believe, have a bi­
ologically based difficulty in connecting emotion to their emerging ability 
to plan and sequence their actions. Therefore, complex interactions that 
require many steps are not guided by needs or interests (emotions). As 
such, they stay simple or become repetitive. Fortunately, however, we have 
also found that this important developmental pathway involving emo­
tional signaling, although a challenge for children with autism, is often 
not completely blocked. As we will show in Chapter 1 1, extra practice 
with meaningful emotional interactions can often help children with this 
type of challenge develop more fully. Perhaps there are "side" pathways 
that can be mastered when the main one is blocked. Through a compre­
hensive program that worked with this experience and ability, we found 
that we could help most children become engaged and interactive and a 
subgroup of children with autistic spectrum disorders become meaning­
fully verbal, empathetic, creative, and reflective, and engaged in solid peer 
and family relationships (see also Chapter 12).29 
Stage 4 is an important stage that develops over several levels and ac­
cording to how complex and broad the interactive emotional signaling 
and problem-solving patterns become. These include: 
• Action Level-Affective interactions organized into action or behavioral 
patterns to express a need, but not involving exchange of signals to any 
significant degree. 
• Fragmented Level-Islands of intentional, emotional signaling and 
problem solving. 
• Polarized Level-Organized patterns of emotional signaling expressing 
only one or another feeling state, for example, organized aggression and 
impulsivity; organized clinging; needy, dependent behavior; organized 
fearful patterns. 
• Integrated Level-Long chains of interaction involving a variety of 
feelings: dependency, assertiveness, pleasure. These are integrated into 
problem-solving patterns such as flirting, seeking closeness, and then get­
ting help to find a needed object. These interactive patterns lead to a 
presymbolic sense of self, the regulation of mood and behavior, the capacity 

70 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
to separate perception from action, and investing freestanding perceptions 
or images with emotions to form symbols. 
Stage 5-Creating Symbols and Using Words and Ideas 
The emergence of formal symbols, of words and ideas, involves a mo­
mentous transformation. By this time, if there have been many oppor­
tunities for emotional exchanges, the child can now more easily separate 
action from perception and hold onto freestanding images and invest 
them with emotions. As children learn to regulate their tongues, other 
mouth muscles, and vocal chords, they can begin forming words to talk 
about these meaningful images or internal representations. If they have 
had lots of emotionally relevant experiences, they can create a broad 
range of meaningful symbols. 
When children haven't learned to create emotionally meaningful im­
ages but are neurologically capable of speaking, the effect is very differ­
ent. A child may see a picture of the table and say the word "table." She 
can label and perform rote memory tasks. But she won't be able to say 
"Mommy, play with me!" or "I don't like that!" Such a child won't have 
meaningful language later on. She won't fully comprehend written lan­
guage, either. The child might learn to read and parrot back "red ball, 
green ball, blue ball," but won't be able to tell you the meaning of a 
story or the motives of the characters. 
It is through emotional interactions that images acquire meaning. The 
child is learning what an apple is, what love is. She can use words or pic­
tures to convey the feeling of giving mom a big hug and by saying, "Love 
you." She can symbolize hitting and screaming by saying, "Me mad!" She 
can also use pretend play to symbolize real or imagined events, such as 
tea parties, monster attacks, and the like. In addition, a child can now 
use symbols to manipulate ideas in her mind without actually having to 
carry out actions. This allows her tremendous flexibility in reasoning and 
thinking because she can now solve problems in her own mind. 
To the degree that they refer to lived emotional experiences, the new 
words a child acquires become meaningful. The twelve or eighteen 
months of exchanges the child has already experienced with caregivers 
and the available world provide a foundation for the emergence of 
meaningful language. Continuous emotional interaction with others 
and the world maintains progress throughout life. 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
71 
This stage of developing ideas and language, which grows rapidly be­
tween eighteen and thirty months and continues thereafter, also moves 
through several levels based on the complexity of the ideas used and how 
the ideas are used to express wishes or actions or feelings. These include: 
• Ideas or words and actions are used together (ideas are acted out, but 
words are also used to signify the action). Ideas or words are not yet used 
instead of actions. 
• Action words are used instead of actions, and these action words convey 
intent ("Hit you!"). 
• Feelings are conveyed through words, but are treated as real rather than 
as signals (''I'm mad," ''I'm hungry," "I need a hug," as compared with 
"I feel mad" or "I feel hungry" or "I feel I need a hug"). In the first in­
stance, the feeling state demands action and is very close to action; 
in the second one, the words are more a signal for something going on 
inside that makes possible a consideration of many possible thoughts 
andlor actions. 
• Words are used to convey bodily feeling states ("My muscles are explod-
ing," "My head is aching"). 
• Words convey feelings, but they are mostly global feeling states ("I feel 
awful," "I feel okay."). The feeling states are generally polarized (all good 
or all bad). These polarized uses of words can also characterize the next 
stage, when logical bridges are created to link ideas together; if they per­
sist, however, they often indicate a constriction or limitation in the full 
mastery of using words and connecting ideas together logically. 
• Words begin to convey more differentiated feelings ("I feel sad" or "I feel 
angry") and, therefore, are beginning to represent more fully a specific 
feeling that is not tied to action. This more differentiated use of words 
characterizes the relative mastery of this stage and the next one. 
Intelligence has now reached the symbolic level. This is when we or­
dinarily think of intelligence as truly beginning. As we have shown, 
however, intelligence has already been on a long developmental journey 
and is now simply reaching a new level. Although we emphasized the 
acquisition of verbal symbols, which is a cornerstone of many intellec­
tual endeavors, the ability to construct symbols actually occurs in many 
domains and gives rise to higher levels of intelligence in all of them. 
This development includes the formation of visual-spatial symbols (the 
preschooler can build a house and elaborate about what goes on in each 

72 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
part of it) as well as planned actions, which serve symbolic goals (taking 
the toy bus from the house to the school to pick up some children). 
Now the child is able to solve problems in her mind. She can explore 
creative and novel possibilities through the manipulation of symbols 
(i.e., ideas). This new foundation for intelligence, like its antecedents, 
will be further developed throughout life. 
The ability to construct symbols also enables individuals to share 
meanings. This includes the common use of words and emerging con­
cepts-not only what's "nice" and "not nice," "fair" and "unfair," but a 
sense of justice and other concepts that can unite groups socially. Symbols 
also enable new levels of social negotiation. Basic needs, such as depend­
ency, curiosity, assertiveness, and aggression, can be dealt with by larger 
and larger groups. Preschoolers are still usually better at sharing meanings 
and symbols with one other person than with large groups of people. At 
big birthday parties, preschoolers tend either to organize into smaller 
gtoupS or play on their own in a more parallel way. Over time, however, 
the ability to use symbols in larger and larger groups emerges. 
The sense of self is also reaching a higher level. A sense of "me" and 
"not me" is forming, now at the level of internal images rather than sim­
ply integrated patterns of behavior, as was true at the prior stage. In other 
words, there is now a "symbolic sense of self" beginning to form. Con­
sciousness is, therefore, reaching an important new level as a symbolic 
awareness of the world is beginning to complement the presymbolic one, 
which had been materializing for some time. This symbolic awareness of 
the world builds on and incorporates the awareness of the world that had 
already existed. In other words, language does not create conscious 
awareness. It provides a new way of labeling and expanding conscious­
ness. It builds on a sense of the self and the outer world that is already 
well established. It now becomes possible to create new realities and new 
levels of consciousness through manipulating and creating symbols. Fan­
tasies and imagination blossom. 
Stage 6-Emotional Thinking, 
Logic, and a Sense of «Reality" 
Another momentous transformation occurs when children learn to con­
nect symbols together logically, making possible logical thinking and re-
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
73 
flection. We just described how, in addition to constructing new mean­
ings, the child has infused her formal symbols with the meanings already 
established, to some degree, in earlier and ongoing emotional experi­
ences. In the sixth stage, from approximately thirty to forty months, the 
child learns to connect these symbols together. She says, "I want to go 
out and play!" and you say, "Why?" and the child says, "Because it's fun," 
or "Because I want to go down that slide." Now the child offers reasons 
for her behavior. "Why are you so mad?" "Because Sally took my toy!" 
She can combine symbols together to think causally. 
The child learns to connect symbols in a variety of contexts, including 
an understanding of how one event leads to another ("The wind blew 
and knocked over my card house"), how ideas operate across time ("If 
I'm good now, I'll get a reward later" or "He was mean to me yesterday; I 
bet he'll be mean again"), and how ideas operate across space ("Mom is 
not here, but she is close by"). Ideas can also help explain emotions-"I 
got a toy so I'm happy"-as well as organize knowledge of the world. 
Connecting ideas logically is also the basis for reality testing, because 
the child now connects experiences inside herself with those outside and 
categorizes which are which (fantasy versus reality). Her ongoing emo­
tional interactions support this ability to form a category of reality be­
cause they continuously put a "me" in contact (through the interactions) 
with a "not me or you." This ongoing contact with someone who is "not 
me" provides constant contact with an external reality outside oneself. 
The emotional investment in relationships enables the child to recognize 
the difference between her fantasies and the actual behavior of others. 
While "reality testing" might appear to be a purely cognitive capacity, as 
we are describing, it requires an ability to organize an emotional sense of 
self that is distinct from one's sense of others. Such "reality testing" is a 
critical foundation for logical thinking. Without it, facts are often used 
to support irrational beliefs. 
Logical thinking leads to an enormous flowing of new skills, includ­
ing those involved in reading, math, writing, debating, scientific reason­
ing, and the like. The child can now create new inventions of her own, 
such as a new "game," and play games with rules. 
General "reasoning" emerges from understanding emotional interac­
tions and is applied to the more impersonal world. For example, cause­
and-effect thinking with symbols comes from dealing logically with 
someone else's intentions or feelings: "When I'm mean, my mom gets 

74 
T H E  F I R S T  I D E A 
annoyed with me." Once a sense of causality has been established at the 
symbolic level, a child can understand how the light from the sun causes 
"day time." A "reality sense" enables us to "think" realistically about 
many different things. Of course, purely cognitive skills enhance this 
core ability, but it is founded upon emotional interactions. 
The ability to build bridges between ideas leads to a new level of in­
telligence. The child can apply her new reasoning ability not only to ar­
guing about "why I should watch more TV" (because it's fun) but also 
to why certain letters make up a word (reading) or why adding numbers 
together can help you figure out how many apples you have. In other 
words, the concepts behind most academic abilities depend on this type 
of logical thinking. We often think about school readiness, intelligence, 
and academic abilities without regard to a framework for understanding 
the stages in thinking. However, this fundamental level of thinking is a 
vital component of intelligence because it is a precondition for all 
higher levels of intellectual functioning. 
New social skills emerge from the ability to connect ideas. The child 
can now understand why it's important to follow the rules of the group. 
The child can also participate in forming group rules. These new skills 
eventually provide the basis for participating in larger groups, communi­
ties, and societies, where individuals need both to follow and help define 
the rules that will enable a large number of people to live safely and se­
curely and solve challenges together. For example, the child can now un­
derstand why it's important not to hit (it will hurt someone else or 
because "I will be punished in the following way"). The child can suggest 
a "new rule": She gets to watch her show on TV and then her brother 
gets to watch his show. This type of social problem solving, as indicated, 
not only enables siblings to get along but enables entire groups and soci­
eties to negotiate ways to live and solve problems together. 
The sense of self is now defined at a higher level. Understanding the 
logical bridges between different feeling states enables the child to con­
nect the different parts of what she considers "me" or "you" together at a 
symbolic level. The mischievous or angry "me" and the nice and happy 
"me" are understood logically: "When you don't let me do what I want, 
I'm mad. When you're nice to me, I'm happy and nice back." 
Consciousness is also moving to a higher level because there is now a 
symbolic awareness of one's own feelings: ''I'm sad because you were 
mean to me." This is the beginning of what will be a monumental jour­
ney towards higher and higher levels of reRective self-awareness. 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
75 
Stage 7-Multiple-Cause and Triangular Thinking 
From simple causal thinking children progress to recognizing multiple 
causes, often experiencing a rapid growth in this capacity between four 
and seven years of age. If someone won't play, instead of just concluding, 
"She hates me," the child can say, "Maybe she has someone else she wants 
to play with today. Maybe her mother is making her come home after 
school." She can set up multiple hypotheses. Or, "Maybe she doesn't want 
to play with me because I have always played Nintendo. Maybe if I offer 
to do something else she'll want to come over." The child is now becom­
ing a multiple-cause thinker in many contexts. In school, she can now 
look at multiple reasons for the Civil War or why a storybook character is 
upset. With peers, she can compare two friends-"I like Sally better than 
Stephanie because she has great toys." Multiple-cause thinking enables her 
to engage in "triangular" thinking. At home, if mother is annoyed, the 
child can try to make her mother jealous by going to her father and being 
coy with him. She can become friends with Sally so as to get to know 
Sally's friend Judy. She can figure out how a character in a book pretended 
to like her vegetables so that she could get dessert. 
The child becomes a more flexible thinker as a result of multiple-cause 
thinking. Eventually she comes to understand more intricate plots in lit­
erature, the multiple causes for historical events, and a physical phenom­
enon that requires a scientific explanation. Therefore, multiple-cause 
thinking constitutes a higher level of reflective thinking in all spheres. 
To learn multiple-cause thinking a child not only needs to have 
learned the earlier levels discussed above, she needs to be able to invest 
emotionally in more than one possibility. For example, she may not be 
able to consider a second friend as a possible play partner if she is too 
dependent on the first friend. She may believe that she will "lose" that 
friend unless she plays only with her. She may not be able to woo her fa­
ther into playing with her, or even consider this possibility if she is too 
anxious about losing her mother. 
The child can now also understand her own family dynamics through 
relationships among different people rather than just by whether her 
own needs are met. For example, it's not simply a question of whether 
her mother is paying enough attention to her but how she competes with 
a sibling when they both want mother's attention. Similarly, she can ne­
gotiate social triangles and figure out that another child may prefer to 
play with someone else on a given day without necessarily disliking her. 

76 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
As the child's intelligence and social skills are advancing, her sense of 
self is expanding to include new horizons as well. She can now begin to 
look at herself as competitive and needy, mischievous and funny (multi­
ple dimensions) all at the same time. Her consciousness is gradually 
developing an awareness of how she can employ these different facets of 
herself in a variety of contexts-whether it's to compete with her sibling 
or to recruit a new friend at school. 
Stage 8-Gray-Area, Emotionally 
Differentiated Thinking 
The ability to engage in emotionally differentiated thinking enables a 
child to understand the different degrees, or "relative" influence, of dif­
ferent feelings, events, and phenomena. For example, often between 
ages six and ten she is rapidly learning that she can like other kids or be 
angry with them (and vice versa) to different degrees. In school, she not 
only looks at multiple reasons for events but can weigh the degree of 
their influence as well. "I think opinions about slavery were a lot more 
important than where people lived (the North versus the South) in 
causing the Civil War." With peers she can compare feelings in a gradu­
ated way: "I like Sally a lot more than Stephanie because she is much 
nicer to me when I'm upset." 
Gray-area thinking enables children to comprehend their roles in a 
group and deal with increasingly complex social systems (''I'm third best 
at spelling and fifth best at telling stories"). All future complex thinking 
requires mastery of this stage, whether it involves looking at the relative 
influence of variables in science and math or understanding one's social 
group and society. 
Intelligence now expands to include a more gray-area understanding 
of the world. She now not only can look at multiple reasons for an event 
but can also weigh how much each factor contributed. She can do the 
same with her own feelings (a little, a medium amount, or a lot of anger). 
Her reflectiveness, therefore, includes a new appreciation of both the 
world and herself 
Socially, the child is now truly able to negotiate the politics of the 
playground. She can figure out and participate in multiple social hierar­
chies involving everything from power or dominance and submission to 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
77 
athletic skills, academic abilities, and likeability. New ways to solve 
problems, especially group problems that involve multiple opinions, are 
now possible because the child can compromise in the "gray area." The 
ability to operate in social hierarchies and employ gray-area negotiation 
strategies creates the foundations for participating in the larger social re­
ality of one's community, society, and culture. 
The sense of self is now expanding to include a sense of being a mem­
ber of a social group. If there is sufficient security in the family, so that 
the child can take her "chicken soup" for granted, she can move out into 
the social group with full vigor and begin defining herself more and 
more through her peer relationships and these newly understandable so­
cial hierarchies. Her sense of self, therefore, is achieving a new level of 
organization and a truly social self (in comparison to the earlier family­
defined self) is emerging. This emerging sense of self in the social 
group, however, is often initially quite rigid and polarized: 'Tm the 
worst soccer player (or dancer)!" Interestingly, many social groups, as we 
will discuss in Chapter 13, are organized around rigid rules and hierar­
chies rather than reflective processes and institutions. 
Similarly, consciousness is also broadening. The comprehension of 
social hierarchies and relativistic intellectual concepts leads to new levels 
of awareness and self-awareness. The child is conscious, not only of her­
self in the group but also in a relativistic sense in the world. It's not sur­
prising, therefore, that we see greater concern with life and death at this 
time as the child becomes aware of the cycles of life. As indicated, chil­
dren may attempt to handle this broadening of their consciousness by 
becoming temporarily more rigid and compulsive. However, this is a 
temporary phase, adaptive in a sense, a way to slow down the progress 
a bit and so digest the new awareness. 
Stage 9-A Growing Sense of 
Self and an Internal Standard 
By puberty and early adolescence, more complex emotional interactions 
and thinking build a ninth level-an internal standard based on a grow­
ing internal sense of self. This process, which builds during the adoles­
cent and adult years, can begin as early as ten or twelve years as children 
gradually create a more defined sense of self. That sense of self, in turn, 

78 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
constitutes an inner standard by which to judge experience. For exam­
ple, they can say for the first time, "I shouldn't be so angry because the 
insult wasn't that great." Similarly, they can look at peers who are doing 
something naughty and say, "I shouldn't do that because it isn't the right 
thing for me to do. It may be okay for them." A child aged from ten to 
twelve and beyond can have a hard time on the playground and still feel 
like a good person. In contrast, an. eight-year-old might have felt like a 
bad person instead of being able to apply her inner standard. Using that 
internal standard, a child can now look at history and say, "I agree with 
the North (or the South) for the following reasons." Or, "In the First 
World War, I think that when people behaved that way, they were exer­
cising bad judgment." 
At this stage, children become able to make more inferences. Infer­
ences mean thinking in more than one frame of reference at the same 
time, or creating a new idea from existing ones. To use more than one 
frame of reference, one needs to have an "agency" that can do the looking 
and relating. One of the two frames of reference that are being compared 
must be based on an organized sense of self that is the product of mean­
ingful experience. Intelligent inferences involve all the developmental 
levels we have been describing as well as emotionally meaningful experi­
ence in the sphere of knowledge where the inference is being made. Both 
are required. Experience and knowledge in the area where the inference 
is made are necessary for sophisticated inferences rather than naOive ones. 
Cognitive, educational, and learning theory has not been able to 
develop an adequate model to figure out or explain how to promote 
the highest levels of reflective thinking because it has not focused on 
the role of emotion. In other words, the highest levels of thinking re­
quire combined emotional and cognitive development because they 
involve comparing frames of reference, which have to be based on on­
going emotional experiences and a complex internal sense of self. 
The new ability to think in two perspectives-objective reality and 
personal opinion-at the same time separates individuals who remain 
somewhat more concrete (they haven't yet mastered this level) from 
those who have. For those who have, the door is now open to the higher 
levels of intelligence and reflectiveness that will be characteristic of ado­
lescent and adult thinking. 
During the early adolescent years, the ability to consider the future as 
well as the past and present broadens the sense of self, an internal stan-
InteLLectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
79 
dard based on it, and the hypothesis-making abilities that lead to infer­
ence and other types of creative thinking. Probabilistic thinking about 
the future, however, can be more readily applied to areas such as math 
and science than others, such as one's personal plans. Emotionally in­
vesting in the future comes in the next stages. 
From a social point of view, values and ideals can now be constructed, 
debated, and argued. To be sure, there will be all kinds of trial balloons as 
teenagers experiment and argue for cultural norms that are different from 
those of their parents. Nonetheless, such debates signal a whole new level 
of social and cultural understanding. It creates the foundations not only 
for understanding values and ideas and pursuing them but also for invest­
ing institutions with stable personal beliefs that can sustain whole soci­
eties; for example, concepts and institutions that support justice. 
The ability to reflect an internal sense of self and standard may be 
viewed as one of the basic capacities required to support values and in­
stitutions commonly associated with representative democracies. Such 
forms of government require a certain percent of the population to in­
vest in abstract principles such as justice and the institutions that sup­
port it ("the consent of the governed," according to Jefferson). Only 
individuals who can think from an internal standard and sense of self 
can invest in abstract principles and institutions. Individuals unable to 
do this are more likely to adhere to a specific leader or a concrete belief. 
The sense of self now embraces a new agency as values and ideals 
gradually become an integral part of the self. The self has also expanded 
to include the two dimensions we've been discussing-the one that op­
erates in the emotions of the day-to-day events, and the one that can 
evaluate these events against a longer term based on a more integrated 
sense of the self over time. This creates an entirely new level of con­
sciousness, one in which self-observation is possible. Individuals can 
now evaluate how they feel, what they've done, and plan to change 
and improve. They can also use this new level of reflective awareness 
for self-directed criticism and anger as well as to praise or invigorate 
themselves. 
If children remain mired in all-or-nothing thinking, they are likely to 
take extreme positions about themselves. On the other hand, if they've 
progressed adaptively through the different stages, through gray-area 
thinking, they can use this new self-observing ability to take an honest 
look at their behavior and then plan accordingly. Because this process is 

80 
T H E  F I R S T  I D E A 
just beginning (as are values and cultural norms), there will be lots of 
experimentation. We will see a mixture of harsh or extreme attitudes 
alongside what appear to be very reasonable ones. Nonetheless, an en­
tirely new level of self-reflection and, therefore, conscious awareness of 
the world is now possible. 
THE STAGES OF ADOLESCENCE 
AND ADULTHOOD 
The nine stages we have been describing constitute basic functional 
emotional development and create the very "structure of thinking." 
From childhood on, these skills are applied to an ever broadening range 
of experiences. In adolescence and adulthood, we take the abilities for 
multiple-cause and gray-area thinking, and an internal sense of self and 
standards, and apply these to an even more ever-widening world. In ado­
lescence, this means biological changes, new emotions and social net­
works, new interests, and future-oriented probabilistic thinking about 
education and work. In adulthood, marriage or intimate relationships, 
having children, and/or career challenges create new demands for reflec­
tive thinking. Some of us can reflect maturely in some areas, such as our 
work problems, but not in family issues. Some of us can apply complex 
thinking skills around family, but not around work. Some of us can do it 
in scholarly work, but not in politics. We vary in how well we apply our 
thinking abilities because they are dependent on the range of our emo­
tional experiences, the breadth and complexity of our growing sense of 
self, and the scope and depth of our reflective abilities. 
As each one of us is simultaneously increasing the complexity and 
level of integration of a sense of self-for example, a self that can em­
brace intimacy with one's own children or spouse-we also broaden and 
further integrate our internal standards. This includes looking at actions 
from the perspective of not just oneself and family but community, cul­
ture, and society, and ultimately the world community. Each of these 
broader applications leads to a higher level of reflective thinking. 
Thinking, as well as its content, changes. For example, the ability to 
empathize simultaneously with one's children and their feelings, one's 
spouse and his or her feelings, and, at the same time, to be aware of 
one's own feelings without overidenti£Ying with those of one's children 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions

or spouse is not simply a very high level psychological achievement but 
a high level of abstract, reflective thinking. Just as thinking of a sense of 
self and internal standard is at once an emotional and cognitive ability, 
similarly at each higher level of reflective thinking the building blocks 
are at once emotional and cognitive. At these higher levels both are re­
quired for true reflective thinking. The reason we see so much pseudo­
reflective thinking at seemingly high levels, and why truly reflective 
thinkers are so rare, is because of the difficulty in mastering these com­
bined cognitive and emotional skills. 
The next seven stages will be described very briefly. Although a great 
deal of interest has been shown in the stages of adolescence and adult­
hood-for example, the work of Erik Erickson, as well as many 
others30-there is a great deal more to learn about these phases of hu­
man development. 
Stage 10-An Expanded Sense of Self 
During this stage, which begins in early and middle adolescence, the 
ability to reflect by using an expanding internal standard and a growing 
internal sense of self encompasses new learning experiences, including 
physical changes, sexuality, romance, and closer, more intimate peer re­
lationships, as well as new hobbies and tastes in art, music, and dress. 
Some adolescents become fragmented or rigid and constricted in an at­
tempt to cope with all these challenges. They may attempt to return to 
an earlier, narrower sense of self. In other words, as the complexity of 
new challenges and experiences expands, an individual may lose the 
ability to use gray-area, multiple-cause thinking, or an internal stan­
dard. When an adolescent is able to incorporate new challenges into an 
expanding sense of self, however, he or she gains broader reflective abili­
ties. No matter how good cognitive skills are (such as mathematical rea­
soning), a person's world can be narrowed by na'ive or rigid thinking 
that ignores the full complexities of life. 
As the self is expanding to include these new experiences, intel­
ligence is also broadening to include a greater appreciation of the world 
along with the new levels of reflection. For example, literature can be 
understood as an exploration of complex relationships between the 
characters in a novel or drama. Motives for historical events can be 

82 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
more fully understood. A broadening social reality facilitates an appre­
ciation of culture and society. 
As a consequence of these changes, one's consciousness and reflective­
ness is reaching higher levels. For example, one can think about thinking 
and observe one's own patterns of thought and interaction ("I tend to be 
quick-witted with the guys but slow-thinking with girls."). This is no 
small feat. Used adaptively, thinking about thinking creates new in­
sights about oneself and others. It can also, however, lead to overload 
and fragmented thinking. Nurturing support and the successful negoti­
ations of earlier stages support the adaptive pathway. 
Stage ii-Reflecting on a Personal Future 
A significant development in late adolescence and early adulthood is an 
ability not only to think about the future but also to become emotion­
ally invested in one's personal future. Although the ability for proba­
bilistic thinking often begins in early adolescence, the ability of a 
teenager to apply this skill to her own life becomes more firmly estab­
lished as she becomes emotionally invested in her future: leaving home, 
going to college, getting a job, and other such concerns. Without such 
an investment, probabilistic thinking may not fully develop. Too much 
anxiety about the future will discourage reflection and restrict cognitive 
and emotional development. The need to invest emotionally in the fu­
ture to develop probabilistic thinking in full is another illustration of 
how emotional and cognitive development work together. 
Investing in future-oriented probabilistic thinking is not only needed 
for mathematical and scientific reasoning, it also enables an apprecia­
tion of social patterns. One can look at the implication of social, politi­
cal, economic, and cultural patterns for the future in relationship to the 
past and present and future. This not only helps one plan but also leads 
to a more sophisticated and intelligent analysis of history, culture, and 
society. It enables one to be a more intelligent voter and economic par­
ticipant. One's sense of self now embraces a sense of the future and a 
more integrated sense of the past as well as the immediate present. At 
the same time, consciousness expands to include this new perspective 
on time as well as a continuously growing perspective on one's personal 
history and future. 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
83 
This perspective will continue growing as the psychological invest­
ment in the future (one's children's future, one's retirement, the future 
of the world) becomes more important. 
Stage i2-Stabilizing a Separate Sense of the Self 
This stage of early adulthood involves separating from the immediacy of 
one's parents and nuclear family and being able to carry the warmth, se­
curity, and guidance of those relationships inside oneself. It involves sta­
bilizing the sense of self and one's internal standards so that one can 
always set internal limits, use good judgment, and care for oneself, even 
when operating outside the immediacy of one's own nuclear family 
and/or related institutions. 
What was earlier a variable or relatively unstable sense of self and in­
ternal standard now must be more stable to hold firm in the face of 
growing independence at college or work. It also must be applied to ex­
ploring intimate relationships more deeply. 
Without such a stable, broad inner framework, intellectual judg­
ments and reflective thinking tend to be na'ive, limited, or fragmented. 
For example, young adults who retreat back into earlier adolescent 
modes of being may not be able to appreciate the nature of long-term, 
intimate relationships with a partner or a future family, let alone reflect 
upon them. A whole realm of life, literature, and culture that deals with 
intimate adult relationships, careers, and independence from parental 
figures may remain outside of, rather than under, the perspective of 
one's reflective thinking. 
Young adults can now often make judgments that "thoughtfully" in­
corporate and accept or reject the standards of their caregivers. The 
standards of one's caregivers, however, are not simply their values and 
judgments, but, through their good offices, the history of their culture 
as well as one's own-that is, one's heritage. There is, therefore, greater 
independence from daily reliance on one's nuclear family, greater invest­
ment in the future-mobilized in the prior stage-and greater ability to 
carry one's past inside oneself as part of a growing sense of self and in­
ternal standard. This stage ushers in the beginning of a long process that 
involves reflective thinking and that can use the past, present, and fu­
ture in a relatively more independent manner. 

84 
T H E  F I R S T  I D E A  
Stage i3-lntimacy and Commitment 
The ability for commitment and intimacy now builds on all the earlier 
stages of emotional development. It includes taking the initial steps in­
volved in life's major decisions. It calls on all the prior stages as well as 
new depth in the ability to reflect upon relationships, passionate emo­
tions, and educational or career choices. This challenge can deepen and 
further stabilize an expanding sense of self and broaden one's thinking 
(for example, with new levels of empathy). For example, the challenge 
of loving another person over a long period of time involves engaging in 
a relationship with deepening intimacy and growing respect for unique 
differences. This is not an easy feat, and it can lead to a narrowing of 
emotional investments, rigidity, and fragmentation or new levels of re­
flectiveness. 
Reflective thinking achieves a yet higher level as a new set of time and 
space dimensions are incorporated into educational, career, and per­
sonal relationships. For example, involvement with a potential mate and 
having a family of one's own inspires a shift from relative states of emo­
tional immediacy to increasingly longer-term commitments. Decision­
making involves greater lengths of time and more stable long-term 
commitments to different types of interpersonal space (work and school 
environments, setting up homes as opposed to living in dormitories or 
apartments). With this new level of reflection we may also begin seeing 
longer-term political and religious values consolidate, although these 
will often form and consolidate for some time. 
Stage i4-Creating a Family 
For those who choose to create a family of their own that includes rais­
ing children, the ability to reflect broadly and wisely is challenged by 
the experience of raising children, without losing closeness with one's 
spouse or partner. An even harder challenge, however, is empathizing 
with one's children without overidentifying or withdrawing. At each 
stage of a child's development there is an opportunity for caregivers to 
overidentify, pull away, or empathize with a balance of caring, under­
standing, and guidance. Meeting this challenge can significantly ex­
pand, deepen, and ripen one's reflective skills and sense of self. At each 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
85 
stage in the child's life it enables one to rework issues in one's own de­
velopment, as well as construct new empathetic capacities at a level of 
intimacy and depth, perhaps not attained in any other relationship. On 
the other hand, it can make a person pull back, wall off parts of the self, 
and become fragmented. As with all new demands and challenges, there 
is the risk that thinking will become concrete, narrow, or rigid when 
challenges are too great. 
An adult with all the early stages in place can now develop a new level 
of consciousness and reflective thinking because of the growing ability 
to view events and feelings from another individual's perspective, even 
when the feelings are intimate, intense, and highly personal. In other 
words, the empathy learned through taking care of children opens up 
new dimensions of feelings that were not possible at earlier stages of em­
pathy. As this ability develops, one is able to generalize it and look at 
and empathize with the goals, needs, and perspectives of other commu­
nities and cultures while maintaining a strong sense of one's own cul­
tural heritage, social values, and commitments. 
Stage i5-Changing Perspectives on Time, Space, 
the Cycle of Life, and the Larger World: 
The Challenges of Middle Age 
Middle age brings with it new perspectives and the need for an ex­
panded, reflective range. Often, the experience of accompanying one's 
child through various stages of development, including possibly grand­
children, has brought new insights into one's own developmental jour­
ney. Ideally, one has deepened one's relationship with a spouse or 
partner. During this stage, one is propelled into having to think about 
the next steps in work and family life. Unrealistic or wishful expecta­
tions and earlier fantasies about attainments are tempered with an ap­
preciation of accumulated reality-based experience and wisdom. 
One's perspective of time is also changing. As Jaques3l has pointed 
out, during the middle age years, the sense of time changes. The future 
is no longer infinite. Relative to one's own life, time appears to pass 
more quickly. In addition, one's allegiance often extends more and more 
into the world community and global concerns. When emotional in­
vestment moves beyond family, local community, or even nation, both 

86 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
the sense of self and consciousness further expand. Most important, 
however, this stage creates an ability to appreciate a new social reality, 
the global or world group. As we will discuss in Chapters 13 and 14, 
technological changes are challenging us all to embrace the global group 
as the new unit of survival. 
Therefore, at this stage, the elements of time and space take on an 
important new dimension that leads to yet a higher level of reflective 
thinking. If these adaptive processes do not occur, however, varying de­
grees of depression, pessimism, anger, rigidity, and/or "escapes" back to 
earlier themes are possible. 
As part of this stage, individuals frequently (either at a conscious or 
intuitive level) have a sense of where they are in their life's journey, in­
cluding their goals. Implicit in this appraisal is a sense of one's own pat­
terns in relationships to others, such as family and career. Most 
individuals operate within identifiable patterns related to their own 
prior experiences. For example, one gifted scholar shared that she had 
always tried to please a demanding, competitive, and "even more gifted" 
father and had operated that way throughout her seemingly successful 
adult life. In trying to please authority figures, however, she had inhib­
ited her own creativity for fear of revealing her true competitive feelings 
towards those authority figures, as well as revealing her fear of failing. 
She secretly fantasized that after absorbing all the wonderful guidance 
from these "knowing" authorities, she would have her day in the sun. 
Now, in midlife, however, she was sensing that the very pattern she had 
elected to reach her goals was not leading her there and that the prize 
she was seeking was not available from the strategies she had elected. 
To be sure, there were many other underlying dynamics related to this 
pattern. Illustrative of the point being made here, however, is the fact 
that this talented individual was now becoming depressed over the real­
ization of the limitations of her own strategies and the related sense that 
the prize she had sought would not be forthcoming. This individual ex­
perienced at least certain elements of her pattern consciously. Others 
experience it at more intuitive or less conscious levels. Regardless of the 
way it's experienced, however, it often contributes to a sense of loss, 
which can also lead to sadness and depression. 
Alternatively, however, this "awareness," which can be particularly 
poignant in midlife because the future is now finite rather than infinite 
(in a relative sense), can lead to a reappraisal and a decision to find an 
Intellectual Growth and Transformations of Emotions 
87 
adaptive pathway outside one's "pattern." Interestingly, this type of 
adaptive solution often involves a reappraisal of one's goals as well, since 
the original goals, like the pattern associated with them, may have been 
partially colored and limited by a variety of previous experiences, in­
cluding conflicts, and childlike solutions to family dramas. The rela­
tively new pattern and goals, based on a reappraisal, can lead to a 
surprisingly fresh and robust direction for life's next stages. The reflec­
tive skills involved in such a reappraisal-that is, the ability to under­
stand one's own patterns and make a "midcourse" adjustment-is an 
important component of an adaptive resolution of this particular stage. 
During this stage, the cycle of life, including death, can also now be 
thought about in a new emotional manner. This further definition of 
the sense of time and space and one's emotional investment in commu­
nity, society, and the world community can lead to an entirely new per­
spective of one's place in the world. 
Stage 16-Wisdom of the Ages 
The later stages of aging can be a time committed to true reflective 
thinking of an unparalleled scope or a time of retreat and/or narrowing. 
As Erik Erikson has pointed out, aging is a time of potential generativ­
ity,32 It brings with it the possibility of broader wisdom, free from many 
of the self-centered and practical worries of earlier stages. 
However, preoccupation with one's changing physical status, or a 
narrowing of interests and perspectives, accompanied by fear, anxiety, 
and depression, can lead to limited thinking. The decline of physical 
abilities, including memory and the ability to sequence actions and in­
formation, and the fear of terminal illness can either overwhelm or lead 
to further growth. 
If memory loss and sequencing problems are not severe, the aging 
process opens up new vistas. Life is much more finite. Goals have been 
either met or not met. Grandchildren or great grandchildren may be a 
part of one's life or on the horizon. A spouse or partner may be an even 
deeper ally in life's travels. One may be able to comprehend the cycle of 
life in a richer, fuller manner. 
. When the aging process and changes in one's own body become dom­
Inant, the appreciation and acceptance of the life cycle is juxtaposed with 

88 
T H E  F I R S T  I D E A 
the possibility of depression and withdrawal. New, almost impossible to 
anticipate feelings and experiences are generated. Time, space, person, 
and self have new dimensions and meanings. In other words, aging can 
bring not just a new insight but what some have called wisdom, an en­
tirely new level of reflective awareness of one's self and the world. 
ŵ 
This quick journey has described the transformations of emotions 
throughout life. During each of the sixteen stages, we observe the rela­
tionship between emotions, intelligence, and reflective thinking (see 
Table 2. 1 for a brief overview). 
But even more intriguing than attempting to figure out how each in­
dividual develops emotions and intelligence is the question of how this 
process first evolved millions of years ago. In the next section, we will 
present support for our hypothesis that cultural patterns dating back to 
prehuman societies and that support the developmental steps just de­
scribed have been passed on by each generation teaching the next gener­
ation. We will trace how different species of primates, prehumans, and, 
eventually, humans, over millions of years, achieved mastery of progres­
sively higher levels of emotional transformation and intelligence.

first instance, the feeling state demands action and is very 
close to action and in the second one, it's more a signal for 
something going on inside that leads to a consideration of 
many possible thoughts and/or actions

A TIMELINE FOR HUMAN 
EVOLUTIONARY DEVELO PMENT 
In recent years, paleoanthropologists have made striking discoveries that 
suggest the highest capacities we associate with human functioning, such as 
symbolic and logical thinking, emerged gradually and earlier than was pre­
viously thought. The saga is still unfolding, and evidence is mounting that 
supports this picture. For example, it has just been reported that an animal 
bone between 1.4-1.2 million years old was found in the Kozarnika cave in 
northwest Bulgaria. The bone has a series of parallel lines engraved in it, 
which, according to Dr. Jean-Luc Gaudelli of the University of Bordeaux, 
"were not from butchering; in this place there is nothing to cut. It can't be 
anything else than symbolism" (BBC News Online, March 16, 2004). 
Discoveries such as this support the hypothesis regarding symbol for­
mation during the course of evolution presented in this work. We have 
suggested that symbol formation results from a series of stages of affective 
transformations, which we have described as functional/emotional devel­
opmental levels. We have further suggested that although biological foun.: 
dations were necessary for this progression, the sufficient condition for the 
steps leading to symbol formation was culturally transmitted caregiving 
practices from one generation to the next, across species, over millions of 
years. These culturally transmitted learning processes enabled new genera­
tions to master more complex stages of affective interaction leading to 
symbol formation. If this hypothesis is correct, the fossil record should re­
flect a gradual process of symbol formation, the signs of its early stages dis­
covered over time. The alternative hypothesis, that genetic mutations were 
the sufficient condition for symbol formation, would lead one to expect the 
sharp emergence rather than the gradual unfolding of symbolic artifacts. 
Therefore, the current findings support our hypothesis of a continu­
ously unfolding biological/cultural process, in which formative caregiv­
ing practices were passed down from one generation to the next. In the 
future, we can expect to hear of further discoveries that show the devel­
opment of our higher capacities was even more gradual and emerged 
even earlier than the argument presented in this book, which is based 
on current paleoanthropological data. On the basis of this existing data, 
however, we can now outline, in general and schematic terms below, 
and discuss more fully in the next section, the timeline of the broad tra­
jectory of fie developmental capacities and related abilities for symbolic 
thinking, with a few examples that characterizes human evolution:

their eyes, and they engage in much back-and-forth vo­
calizing. As the infants grow older, they spend more and 
more time looking at their caregivers' faces and staring 
into their eyes. Much vocalizing goes on during these 
episodes of shared gaze, and when it is time to be 
weaned, the infant can be seen calling for food; the care­
giver responds by slowly extending something to eat. 
rhesus monkeys and other mammals 
-e.g., a rhesus baby spends a lot of time snuggling into 
its mother's body and looking keenly at her face; it visi­
bly relaxes and vocalizes happily while being rocked, 
and rhythmically moves its arms and legs. As adults, 
rhesus monkeys use back-and-forth emotional signaling 
to deal with danger, aggression, assertiveness, etc. 
baboons and other mammals 
-e.g., baboon infants engage in back-and-forth emo­
tional signaling with their caregivers. An infant might 
happily vocalize, receive the same vocalization from its 
caregiver, and then make the vocalization again. Recent 
research has shown that, as adults, baboons engage in 
extremely subtle back-and-forth signaling in both male­
male and male-female greetings whereby they work out 
such matter as friendship, mating, and coalitions. 
H. erectus (2-.4 mya) 
H. habilis (2-1.5 mya) 
Australopithecines (5.3-1.4 mya) 
Ardepithecines (5.8-4.4 mya) 
chimpanzees, bonobos and other primates 
-e.g., chimpanzees in the wild engage in organized 
hunting parties, demonstrating a sophisticated under­
standing of how the other hunters will behave in any 
given situation as well as how the different species of prey 
will behave. Particularly striking is the amount of com­
plex emotional communication that is involved. Through 
gestures, body movements, head nods, and facial expres­
sions, the hunters coordinate their actions and signal to 
one another who is to do what and when.

Archaic H. sapiens and Early Moderns 
(600,000-60,000 years ago) 
-e.g., over 300 fragments of pigment, believed to be 
between 350,000 and 400,000 years old, were found in 
a cave at Twin Rivers, in Zambia. These pigments had 
been ground up into a powder and ranged in color from 
brown to red, yellow, purple, blue, and pink. Paleoan­
thropologists believe that they were used for ritual body 
painting, and perhaps, for cave painting. That is, cur­
rent evidence points to the fact that Archaic H sapiens 
were mastering, through long and complex affective in­
terchanges, various elements of presymbolic communi­
cation and were even beginning to use symbols to 
convey abstract thoughts and feeling states. 
H. sapiens sapiens 
(Approximately 130,000 years ago) 
-e.g., evidence that early modern humans were at least 
at the stage of beginning to build bridges between their 
ideas and to think logically, if not higher, is provided by 
the first colonization of Australia that took place about 
60,000 years ago, which required them to build some 
sort of crude transport to cross the sea. Operating in 
this kind of complex group endeavor would have re­
quired the ability to perceive connections between natu­
ral events and plan their actions accordingly. 
Magdelenian Period (12,000-8,000 B.C.) 
-e.g., the Magdelenians were figuring out how to 
adapt to their hostile environment with more complex 
kinds of shelters and more protective types of clothing. 
Not only did they likely experiment with different kinds 
of structures, but they also experimented with different 
materials and techniques for fashioning cooking pots 
and for making protective clothing out of animal skins. 
Such technological advances reveal a flexible form of ab­
stract reasoning. The emergence of settlements at the 
end of the period also indicates that they were mastering 
the sort of gray-area thinking in which one compre­
hends one's role in a group and can deal with increas­
ingly complex social systems

Ancient Civilizations (3,500-72000 B.C.) 
-e.g., individuals in the Sumerian state were starting 
to think of their family's rights, and what sorts of public 
actions were available to them to avenge transgressions. 
Laws invested with our internal standards were insti­
tuted to ensure that women and vulnerable members of 
the society were protected by the State. Accomplishing 
this level of social development requires that the indi­
viduals involved master thinking from an internal stan­
dard and acquire a more integrated sense of self. There 
are different degrees here. At a fairly concrete level, the 
shared sense of reality that binds together the members 
of a group may simply be based around common words 
and concepts. At a more abstract level, a shared sense of 
reality may be grounded in institutions and practices 
that support a shared system of values. 
Ancient Greece (6th_3rd century B.C.) 
-e.g., in sixth century Miletus, thinkers such as Thales 
and Anaximander began to develop the first concept of 
science: i.e., the first attempt to explain natural phenom­
ena empirically. These early scientific advances were later 
followed by remarkable advances in abstract thought, 
e.g., in the development of metaphysics, logic, mathe­
matics, and geometry, as well, of course, as the elaborate 
forms of ethical, aesthetic, and political theories found in 
Plato, the Phytagoreans, and Aristotle. These fie ad­
vances are also reflected in the creation of the Polis: the 
city-state that was based on the idea that people should 
live in a community of individuals who were all con­
scious of their shared interests and common goals, and 
who would manage collective concerns by debating pos­
sible courses of action in a public setting. In order to 
reach consensus through public decisionmaking forums, 
individuals have to be able to recognize that there are dif­
ferent degrees of satisfying their interests and must also 
reconcile their personal wishes with the larger needs of a 
community that now includes members that one is not 
tied to by blood or possibly even customs.

A New Direction for Evolutionary Theory 
Introduction 
Asking what humans would be like without culture is like asking what 
a duck would be like if it had lips instead of a bill. It wouldn't be a 
duck; it would be something else. 
-JONATHAN MARKS, What It Means to Be 98% Chimpanzee 
T
HE EVOLUTIONARY HYPOTHESIS we are presenting in this book 
challenges a long determinist tradition in Western thought that 
dates back at least as far as the Enlightenment, if not beyond. Accord­
ing to this tradition, all human beings, apart from those who have suf­
fered some serious biological disorder, have the same mental capacities; 
only human beings have these capacities; and the nature and matura­
tion of these capacities is somehow fixed in advance. It is important 
to recognize just how deeply ingrained this determinist paradigm is 
in Western thinking about the mind. Long before Charles Darwin 
boarded the Beagle, Western scientists were thinking about evolution; 
and long before James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the struc­
ture of DNA, Western thinkers were thinking about evolution in deter­
minist terms. 
According to the great seventeenth-century philosopher Nicholas 
Malebranche: 
We may say that all plants are in a smaller form in their germs. By exam­
ining the germ of a tulip bulb with a simple magnifying glass or even 
97 

98 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
with the naked eye, we discover very easily the different parts of the 
tulip. It does not seem unreasonable to say that there are infinite trees in­
side one single germ, since the germ contains not only the tree but also 
its seed, that is to say, another germ, and Nature only makes these little 
trees develop. We can also think of animals in this way. We can see in the 
germ of a fresh egg that has not yet been incubated a small chick that 
may be entirely formed. We can see frogs inside the frog's eggs, and still 
other animals will be seen in their seed when we have sufficient skill and 
experience to discover them . . . .  Perhaps all the bodies of men and ani­
mals born until the end of times were created at the creation of the 
world, which is to say that the females of the first animals may have been 
created containing all the animals of the same species that they have be­
gotten and that are to be begotten in the future.l 
Malebranche's views were enormously influential and played a key 
role in the emergence of the doctrine known as Deism: the view that 
God meticulously designed all Nature at the beginning of time and then 
allowed His creation to operate independently. On this mechanist out- . 
look, the universe is like an extraordinarily complex clock that God 
fashioned and then left to run on its own. 
Twentieth-century evolutionary theorists mounted a vigorous attack 
on Deism, not because they objected to the mechanism but because 
they objected to the teleology that earlier mechanists had implicitly em­
braced. Perhaps the most influential of the neo-Darwinian critics of this 
teleological outlook was Stephen J. Gould. Gould documented consid­
erable evidence throughout his career to show why evolutionary change 
cannot be viewed as progressive. Thus Gould placed great emphasis on 
the nonadaptive consequences of genetic variation. In their famous arti­
cle, "The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Cri­
tique of the Adaptationist Programme," Gould and Richard Lewontin 
argued that biological adaptation is analogous to the spandrels in the 
cathedral of San Marco, which Venetian artisans decorated with de­
railed mosaics portraying biblical rivers. Just as the architectural space 
for these mosaics arose as the side effect of an engineering requirement, 
so too, according to Gould and Lewontin, certain biological structures 
are nonadaptive consequences of the demands of a local environment.2 
The anti-Deistic implications of Gould's neo-Darwinism have been 
most vigorously pursued by Richard Dawkins. According to Dawkins: 
Introduction 
99 
All appearances to the contrary, the only watchmaker in nature is the 
blind force of physics, albeit deplored in a special way. A true watch­
maker has foresight: he designs his cogs and springs, and plans their 
interconnections, with a future purpose in his mind's eye. Natural selec­
tion, the blind unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discov­
ered, and which we now know is the explanation for the existence and 
apparently purposeful form of all life, has no purpose in mind. It has no 
mind and no mind's eye. It does not plan for the future. It has no vision, 
no foresight, no sight at all. If it can be said to play the role of watch­
maker in nature, it is the blind watchmaker} 
But despite the considerable difference between the teleological view 
of Nature embraced by eighteenth-century Deists and Dawkins's "blind 
watchmaker" scenario, what is even more striking is how Dawkins re­
mains committed to the same determinist view of the human mind that 
the Enlightenment philosophers embraced. Indeed, modern genetic de­
terminists in general have remained committed to the view that human 
beings' higher reflective capacities are universal, unique, and innate. So­
ciobiologists and evolutionary psychologists insist that there is "a uni­
versal human nature [that] exists primarily at the level of evolved 
psychological mechanisms, not of expressed cultural behaviours," and 
that "the evolved structure of the human mind is adapted to the way of 
life of Pleistocene hunter-gatherers, and not necessarily to our modern 
circumstances."4 According to this outlook, if we want to understand 
how the human mind works, we have to investigate the "set of environ­
ments and conditions [that] defined the adaptive problems the mind 
was shaped to cope with: Pleistocene conditions, rather than modern 
conditions."5 
Such an argument rests on the same assumption as that made by 
eighteenth-century Deists: that the structure of the human mind 
evolved at the dawn of our existence-according to sociobiologists and 
evolutionary psychologists, sometime between 200,000 and 30,000 
years ago, as opposed to Bishop Usher's calculation that the world was 
created on October 26, 4004 B.C., and has stayed the same ever since. 
Civilizations may rise and fall, but this basic cognitive structure remains 
unchanged. It is as if Nature rather than God had somehow designed a 
mechanism-in its latest mechanist incarnation, a computer (the hu­
man brain)-together with a means for reproducing exactly the same 

1 00 
T H E  F I R S T  I D E A 
software over and over again in each individual (the human genome). 
Hence, the sociobiologist or evolutionary psychologist sees himself as 
resembling an archaeological computer scientist whose task is to strip 
away the layers of culture-the applications of those programs-and 
expose the bare bones of "How the Mind Works": a mechanist meta­
phor first coined by the nineteenth-century logician George Boole and 
repeated by mechanist thinkers ever since. 
There are, no doubt, many reasons why such a mechanist outlook has 
been so prominent in Western culture. One of the most important fac­
tors was the impetus that seventeenth-century mechanism received 
from the Newtonian revolution. Suddenly not just the movement of the 
planets and the stars but even the operations of the human body, and 
matter in general, could all be given a mechanical explanation. Perhaps 
the chief reason why this mechanist view of "how the mind works" has 
been so influential dates back to the Cartesian bifurcation between Rea­
son and the emotions. Convinced that the mind is a "rational machine" 
that is guided by Aristotle's Fundamental Laws of Logic, generation af­
ter generation of philosophers and psychologists have sought to explain . 
the operations of the mind in mechanical terms.6 What could be more 
natural than the assumption that there must be some innate mecha­
nism, namely, "genes," that contains blueprints for these mechanical 
processes that were selected in the Pleistocene and then passed down 
from one generation to the next in the same form? 
Sociobiology and evolutionary psychology provide us with some pen­
etrating insights into how the evolution of our biology, for example, the 
sttucture of our sensory organs, is intimately bound up with our evolu­
tion as social beings. But although natural selection may in part explain 
the evolution of our basic biological capacities, it cannot explain how 
we develop our higher-level reflective and social skills. The evolution of 
our higher-level capacities, which involve flexible problem-solving skills 
that use complex communicative and symbolic processes, depends on a 
very different process; for flexible problem solving needs to be sensitive 
to changing environments and cannot be structured into fixed biologi­
cal pathways. 
As we remarked at the beginning of the book, the assumption that 
natural selection alone can explain how such flexible problem-solving 
capacities evolved is based on a narrow paradigm that was originally ap­
plied to simple organisms. The reasoning here is quite similar to what 
was seen in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) forty years ago. Early 
Introduction 
1 0 1 
AI scientists were successful at modeling simple motor-visual and logi­
cal problems. They then assumed that the same computational proce­
dures used to simulate the simple processes involved in these "toy 
domain" problems could be applied to higher-order cognitive processes; 
that is, the latter are somehow "built up" out of these "atomic units."? 
One problem with this assumption, however, is that, for deep historical 
reasons, AI ignored the role of emotions in the growth and functioning 
of the mind. Indeed, it was for precisely this reason that AI scientists as­
sumed that higher cognitive functions could be simulated on a com­
puter. But as we saw in Chapters 1 and 2, emotions serve as the critical 
architect for the mind's higher-order cognitive processes. Hence it is not 
sutprising that AI failed to live up to its early expectations and was un­
able to advance beyond the level of modeling toy domains. 
The same problem has surfaced again in modern evolutionary psy­
chology. Given the assumption that the fixed behaviors of simple organ­
isms are genetically determined, evolutionary psychologists then assume 
that the same mechanistic explanation must apply to the much more 
complex behaviors displayed by higher social organisms. These modern 
determinists assume that there must be special genes governing our so­
cial capacities, for example, genes for "mindreading," for seeing one an­
other as intentional beings. Thus, just as AI scientists sought to account 
for the marked differences between following an algorithm and creative 
thinking in terms of the kind of heuristics embodied in a computational 
system, evolutionary psychologists seek to account for the difference be­
tween the "social behavior" of lower organisms-say, ant colonies-and 
the social behavior of humans in terms of the "programs" that are en­
coded in each species' genes and that dictate the manner in which they 
"process" information. 
But there is no algorithm, computer program, or scientifically vali­
dated biological mechanism to explain complex human symbolic and 
reflective thinking. The problem here, however, is not that technology 
has still not advanced far enough to answer this age-old question of how 
we develop our higher-level reflective skills. The problem is that for over 
four hundred years, Western thought has been drawn to a hypothesis 
that, at present, not only has no scientific data behind it, but is not con­
sistent with any known biological or physical mechanism. 
For a generation raised on determinist principles, the idea that the 
evolution of the human mind and of human societies was the result of 
formative cultural practices that guide caregiver-infant interactions 

1 02 
T H E  F I R S T  I D E A 
during the formative periods of development, and that these critical 
cultural practices were not genetically determined bur, rather, were 
passed down and thus learned anew by each generation in the evolu­
tionary history of humans, may come as something of a shock; indeed, 
it may seem not just a heretical bur, in some ways, even a sacrilegious 
idea. For such a hypothesis radically alters our view about the forces 
that brought about the evolution of human beings: It changes our un­
derstanding of the ongoing importance of those cultural practices that 
enable a child to develop his "species-typical" capacities, and it changes 
our understanding of the basic developmental processes and needs that 
enabled prehumans and early humans to form groups, societies, and 
cultures. 
Species-typical capacities-the differentiation of cortical and subcorti­
cal processes; our basic cognitive capacities, such as attention, the ability 
to inhibit nonsalient information, and short- and long-term memory; 
the emotions we feel and are capable of feeling; the thoughts we have 
and the beliefs, desires, and intentions we form; our ability to think logi­
cally and reflectively or imaginatively and creatively; our ability to com­
municate with others, both nonverbally and verbally; and our ability to 
understand what others are thinking and feeling-emerged, and can 
only emerge, in the context of the close nurturing relationships that a 
child experiences with his caregivers. No matter how much potential his 
brain may have, unless a child undergoes very specific types of interactive 
affective experiences that involve the successive transformations of emo­
tional experience and that are the product of cultural practices forming 
the very core of our evolutionary history, that potential will not be real­
ized in a traditional sense. For that potential does not reside in the phys­
ical structure of the brain, but is defined only in the types of complex 
interactions between biology and experience that we will be describing.

The Early Stages of Emotional 
Regulation, Engagement, and Signaling: 
Nonhuman Primates 
and the Earliest Hominids 
IN THIS CHAPTER WE look at the operation of nonhuman primates 
and early nonhuman hominids at different stages of functional/ 
emotional development. We will show how tamarins and marmosets 
are just starting to master the first fie stage, that of self-regulation; 
rhesus monkeys are at a higher level, where they are beginning to en­
gage and relate; and chimpanzees and bonobos, which may serve as a 
possible model for the behavior of the first hominids, are at a still 
higher level and able to engage in collaborative problem solving. 
Before we embark on this fascinating theoretical journey, it is impor­
tant to note that the term "hominid" has recently gone through an im­
portant transition. Traditionally the term referred to any member of the 
Hominidae family of erect bipedal primate mammals, and thus put re­
cent humans together with extinct ancestral forms. But in the last 
twenty or so years, we have learned that apes did not all descend from 
one ancestor, that chimpanzees and gorillas share a more recent ancestor 
with humans than do orangutans. This means that, at the strict taxo­
nomic level, chimps and gorillas are actually hominids. To avoid this is­
sue, scientists are beginning to use the term "hominin," which refers to 
those on the human lineage and once again excludes apes.! We have 
chosen in this work to retain the more familiar term "hominid" in the 
belief that the reader might find the newer term more confusing. But we 
1 03 

1 04 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
do so with an eye on how fluid the science of paleoanthropology is, 
given the major new discoveries that are constantly being reported. 
We saw in the opening chapter how a baby learns to take in the world 
around him, and that, for this to happen, the baby has to want to engage 
with his caregivers and explore his surroundings. To promote the devel­
opment of their child's capacity to attend to the outer world and to regu­
late his sensations, caregivers entice their babies with animated facial 
expressions, lively gestures, and soothing vocalizations. Right from the 
beginning, caregivers and infants are engaged in rhythmic, co-regulated 
patterns that enable the infant to begin attending to the outside world. 
As the baby becomes more interested in his world, he not only begins to 
discriminate what he sees, hears, smells, and touches, but, in the next 
stage, becomes more and more interested in interaction. In particular, he 
starts to develop a strong attachment to his primary caregiver, which pro­
vides the foundation for the development of the child's ability to engage 
in long chains of co-regulated emotional communication. 
The primates that we will look at in this chapter, especially chim­
panzees and bonobos, have mastered these first two stages of fie devel­
opment. But it is the third stage that appears to have been particularly 
important in early hominid evolution, for it marked the onset of a new 
range of social behavior that went significantly beyond preprogrammed 
biological templates. At this stage, we see the emergence of co-regulated 
emotional interactions, which involves flexible reading and responding 
to a great variety of multisensory cues (such as facial expressions, 
sounds, hand gestures, touching, body posture, and the like). The first 
two stages, having to do with regulation and engagement, while in part 
social, can be highly influenced by known biological mechanisms. But 
whereas engaging or bonding are affected, in part, by known biological 
factors (such as the effects of oxytocin on nurturing behavior),2 emo­
tional communication is a sufficiently complex social process that must 
go beyond its biological substrates. It can be developed only in the con­
text of early nurturing experiences. In whatever species uses this process, 
it must be carried from one generation to the next, through the social 
transmission of learned caregiving practices, if the species is to survive. 
The caregiving practices that nurture all three of these early stages of 
fl e development are not uniform but must be tailored to the individual 
strengths and weakness of the infant. Newborns vary significantly in 
how they respond to sounds, sights, touches, smells, and movements. 
Some are very sensitive and require soothing, others are underreactive 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 05 
and require energetic wooing. Some quickly turn towards the source of 
a sound, others take more time to develop this skill. Some begin to fig­
ure out visual or auditory patterns fairly quickly, others more slowly. 
Thus caregivers have to tailor their interactions to their baby's individ­
ual preferences and abilities.3 
Caregiving practices that promote fie levels are not unique to humans. 
Complex primates demonstrate comparable caregiving behaviors to a 
lesser or greater extent.4 According to our model of intelligence, the 
greater and more complex the emotional communication in which a 
species engages, the higher its intelligence. At the lowest end of the non­
human primate spectrum, in New World tamarins and marmosets, we see 
some emotional communication, but it is highly constrained, both in the 
number of modalities involved and the length of reciprocal interactions. 
At the highest levels, chimpanzee and bonClbo infants become able to en­
gage in long bouts of co-regulated, reciprocal interactions with early back­
and-forth facial expressions, vocalizations, and other motor gestures.5 
There is also some evidence that chimpanzees and bonobos are just start­
ing to establish conventionalized patterns of behavior that serve as the 
foundation for problem solving and, perhaps, even some symbolic com­
munication.6 One can situate nonhuman primates on a similar type of fle 
trajectory, therefore-although with different quantitative and qualitative 
features-that we have described for human development. For example, 
the "higher" the species the more complex its affect signaling. This "com­
plexity" can be seen both in the subtlety and the control that an organism 
has over its affect signaling apparatus (e.g. facial musculature), and in the 
number of modalities and the way these modalities are orchestrated in 
two-way communication (e.g., vision, auditory processing and vocaliza­
tion, and motor movements, including facial expressions). 
Our earliest hominid ancestors, the Australopithecines, may have 
been similar in varying respects to what we see in chimpanzees or bono­
bos today.? Thus, studying these nonhuman primates may afford us an 
insight into the caregiving practices that set us off on our evolutionary 
trajectory.8 
INSIGHT F ROM APE LAN GUAGE RESEARCH 
The belief that only humans have language, and indeed, that it is the 
possession of language that demarcates humans from animals, is one of 

1 06 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
the most entrenched of all modern philosophical ideas. While undergo­
ing formal training in the philosophy and psychology of language at 
Oxford in the late 1970s and early 1980s, one of us (S.C.S.) saw no 
problem in this assumption. The field at the time was deeply divided 
between two warring camps: the "Chomskeans" and the "Wittgen­
steinians." According to the former, children do not so much learn lan­
guage as have it grow in them. According to the latter, children learn 
language in much the same way that they learn other forms of complex 
social behavior. Despite the glaring opposition between these two posi­
tions, however, the one point on which both sides agreed was that only 
human beings are capable of acquiring language. 
So deeply engrained was this idea that, regardless of the side on 
which one stood in the language-development debate, few of us at Ox­
ford were prepared to treat seriously the claims coming out at the time 
that chimpanzees had acquired primitive linguistic skills. Certainly that 
was true for me. Asked by a colleague to write a review of some of the 
papers on ape language research by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, a primatolo­
gist who began working with bonobos in the 1980s, I was skeptical of 
the claim that these apes could have acquired language skills. Rather, I 
approached Savage-Rumbaugh's papers to see whether her research 
could shed light on the development of those communicative skills that 
enable a child to learn language. 
Sue responded to my article with an invitation to come down to the 
Language Research Center (LRC) in Atlanta and see for myself the 
work being done with the bonobos. It was an invitation that was to turn 
out to be one of the most momentous events in my academic career. It 
marked the start of my long and fruitful collaboration with Sue.9 It was 
the catalyst for the exciting work I am now engaged in with Barbara 
King on the nature of nonhuman primate communication as viewed 
from the perspective of dynamic systems theory. 10 And, most important 
for this book, it was the source of my deep interest today, both as a 
philosopher and as a psychologist, in the study of emotional gesturing 
in nonhuman primates and in the insight this research brings to our un­
derstanding of the growth of the human mind. I I 
My arrival that first day at the Language Research Center was event­
ful. The LRC is located on the outskirts of Atlanta in a heavily wooded 
area. The entrance to the center is hidden off a small side road with no 
signs announcing its location. After driving around in circles for some 
time, my taxi driver stumbled upon it quite by accident. Facing us was a 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 07 
high chain-link fence, a speaker off to one side. These were the days 
when NASA was funding some of the research being done at the LRC 
and insisted on fairly strict security. When I announced my presence, 
we had to wait for several minutes while my credentials were checked. 
Then the gate mysteriously swung open and we proceeded slowly down 
a forest road to a second gate, where we had to go through the same 
procedure. I will never forget the moment when my driver nervously 
asked me what sort of place this was and, on cue, as I began to answer 
that it was a research facility where they studied apes, we were passed by 
twO researchers in a golf cart with a bonobo sitting in the front seat. My 
driver was in such a rush to drop me off that I had to argue with him to 
wait while I paid for the trip. 
After signing in at the office, I was directed to the back compound 
where Sue was working with the star of her research, Kanzi. The com­
pound was a huge enclosure equipped with an oversized jungle set, vari­
ous climbing ropes, a child's plastic house, and a large wading pool. I 
could see Sue off in the distance; she was working with what looked like 
a large black chimpanzee wearing a bright orange sweatshirt. As soon as 
she saw me, she came running over and told Kanzi to follow. The first 
thing that shocked me was that Kanzi lumbered towards me bipedally, 
and, when he was just a few feet away, stood facing me gently swaying 
his arms. 
I was unsettled by his size, by his stare, and, most of all, by the fact 
that he was so comfortable standing upright. But even more unsettling 
was what Sue said: "Kanzi," she announced, "this is Stuart Shanker. Re­
member the airplane that went over our heads an hour ago, and I told 
you there was a scientist on board that was coming to visit you? Well, 
this is the person I was telling you about." This brief introduction left 
my mind spinning. Did this woman really believe that this ape knew 
what a scientist or an airplane was? I suspected that, to ease me into 
Kanzi's presence, Sue was doing the same sort of thing that Tracy Hogg 
describes in Secrets of the Baby Whisperer: In that work, Hogg counsels 
parents to speak naturally to their newborns and describe what's going 
on as if they were speaking to an adult. Today, I'm not so sure; Kanzi's 
comprehension of spoken English is so extraordinary that I would say 
exactly the same sort of thing to him and expect him to understand. 
After these introductions had been made, Sue turned to Kanzi and 
said, "I'm going to take Stuart around the lab. Could you please water 
the tomato plants for me while we're doing this?" And sure enough, I

watched as he trundled over to an outdoor water faucet, picked up a 
bucket that was lying beside it, turned on the spigot and filled the 
bucket, turned off the faucet himself, and then walked down to a veg­
etable patch at the far end of the compound, carrying the bucket in one 
hand. When he reached the vegetables, I watched as he poured the water 
on a small patch of tomato plants growing in the corner of the vegetable 
garden. Nothing at Oxford had prepared me for this sort of scene. 
Shortly after this, Sue led me into the group room where Kanzi had 
been joined by his sister, Panbanisha, and Tamuli, one of the controls at 
the LRC who had not been exposed to language instruction. My first ex­
perience of being in the midst of a group of bonobos involved a steep 
learning curve. Sue was orchestrating my every move: "Crouch down,"

"L 
" "S 
. 
h d "  "L 
k 
s e or ere ; t en,

up slowly," "Smile." I was oblivious of the problems involved in my intro­
duction into the group. To begin with, I am male: an immediate threat to 
Kanzi, the alpha male of the group. To make matters worse, I am quite 
tall; I towered over Kanzi, and, for that matter, over Sue. And worSt of all, 
because I had no experience with bonobos, I was blind to the subtle emo- . 
tional gesturing that was going on around me as the group sized me up. 
Afterwards, Sue asked me about my perception of how this initial 
meeting had gone. I replied, honestly, that the animals seemed indiffer­
ent to my presence. Fortunately, we had taped this initial encounter and 
I was able to see just how mistaken my first impression was. When I 
viewed the tape in slow motion, it was clear to me that a virtual flurry of 
emotional communication had been going on. All the apes were study­
ing me carefully out of the corner of their eyes. Even more striking was 
the way they were expressing their anxiety through slight fear-grins and 
raised hair, and then how they showed their acceptance of me with the 
slightest of head nods and subtle hand gestures. Their body posture and 
the hair on their backs gradually relaxed as they returned to the groom­
ing activities that I had interrupted. 
Over the years I have learned that bonobos are constantly communi­
cating with each other in a variety of ways: gestures, facial expressions, 
gaze, vocalizations, arm and leg movements, posture, and proximity. 
Some of the time they may communicate through one modality only, 
but more often than not this communication is multimodal. Moreover, 
their emotional gesturing in each of these modes can be even more sub­
tle than similar forms of gesturing amongst humans: so subtle, in fact, 
that it has led many casual observers to assume, mistakenly, that they 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 09 
are relatively passive and incommunicative creatures. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. To be sure, it takes time to tune in to their sub­
tle gestures; therefore, for someone who has not spent time studying 
these apes, it can be difficult to pick up on the emotional currents that 
are constantly swirling around a group. But then, this problem is not 
confined to human observers. 
A couple of years ago I witnessed a fascinating encounter when an 
adult male who had been raised in Japan was introduced into the colony. 
P-Ske was having a great deal of trouble integrating into the group. At 
first it was thought that this was simply because he had been the alpha 
male in his colony back in Japan and was having trouble adjusting to 
Kanzi's role as the alpha in the LRC group. But after a while, it became 
clear that the trouble went far deeper than this. Once, I was watching as 
Panbanisha and Tamuli were playing with a gorilla mask. Panbanisha 
had put the mask on and was chasing Tamuli around the cages, squeals 
of delight emanating from both. This is fairly unusual behavior for 
bonobos, and certainly P-Ske had never encountered anything like it. As 
he entered the cages, his hair immediately began to bristle, his nostrils 
flared, and he had a pronounced fear-grin on his face. His behavior be­
came aggressive as he responded to what he apparently regarded as 
threatening behavior. Moreover, he failed to pick up on the significance 
of the gestures and vocalizations that Panbanisha and Tamuli were mak­
ing to try to involve him in the game. Like a stranger who has been 
raised in a totally different culture with completely different social con­
ventions, he had trouble picking up on the emotional cues of the group 
and for a long time had to be somewhat isolated until he began to grasp 
the significance of the gestures, vocalizations, and facial expressions of 
the bonobos at the LRC. 
Seeing this, I realized just how critical it is for babies to be raised 
within a group if they are to absorb the group's distinctive manner of 
emotional communication. I have seen this over and over again with 
Nyota. When Nyota wants me to chase him he gestures in exactly the 
same way as Panbanisha. When he is happy, his smiles and soft vocaliza­
tions remind me of Kanzi. Over and over again, I am reminded of that 
passage in Philosophical Investigations in which Wittgenstein describes 
how "the various resemblances between members of a family: build, fea­
tures, colour of eyes, gait, and temperament, etc. overlap and criss-cross 
in the same way."12 But the family resemblances that one senses so 
strongly at the LRC are not so much physical as behavioral.

The very first time I met Nyota, I could see how strong these family 
influences are. Sue started sending me regular reports about Nyota's de­
velopment shortly after his birth. I couldn't wait to fly down to Atlanta 
to observe him first-hand. I knew from Sue that Nyota was a sheer de­
light; what I wasn't prepared for, however, was the family scene that 
greeted me the evening I arrived. Panbanisha was quietly grooming Ny­
ota, who was lying sprawled across her lap while Uncle Kanzi was sitting 
close by munching on some sugar cane. Every once in a while, Nyota 
would languidly reach over to touch Kanzi, perhaps in the hope that 
he'd be offered some of the sugar cane. All this time, Panbanisha was 
gently stroking Nyota's arms and abdomen and making a low chirping 
sort of sound, to which he would respond by nuzzling deeper into her 
arms and occasionally looking up and gently touching her face. Both of 
them had the most serene look on their faces. As I sat in the corner 
watching this tranquil domestic scene, I quickly began to share in the 
emotional sense of well-being that filled the room. 
Sue has written extensively about her own experiences with Kanzi 
and his mother, Matata. One vignette that I particularly like is Sue's de­
scription of "nest-building." Just like any human child, Kanzi was rarely 
ready to go to bed when Matata wanted. Still eager to play, he would 
flop on Matata with a full play face, smiling and laughing while waiting 
for Matata to play-bite and tickle him. Matata would indulge him in 
this way for fifteen to twenty minutes, at which point Kanzi would 
nurse and go to sleep while Matata groomed him.13 The reason I like 
this vignette so much is because I have watched my wife perform exactly 
the same ritual with our own son every night at bedtime. She would go 
through exactly the same routine, playing with him in the same way 
that Matata played with Kanzi and making the same sorts of vocaliza­
tions and facial expressions. And just as with Kanzi, these play bouts 
would always end with Sasha nursing and then suddenly falling asleep. 
The primatologist who has, perhaps, added most to our understanding 
of the dynamic process whereby the affective behavior of nonhuman pri­
mate infants is shaped in co-regulated interactions with their caregivers is 
Barbara King. The following are wonderful examples from her research of 
the co-regulated patterns that develop within primate families: 
Elikya, two months old, sits with her mother Matata. Her mother hands 
her over to Neema sitting nearby. From Elikya's facial pout, we can tell 
she is distressed by this transfer. Three times in succession, she extends 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 1 1  
her arm and hand, palm up, back toward her mother. Mter the third ges­
ture, her mother takes her back. Neema pats Elikya as Elikya relaxes 
against her mother. 
When eight months old, Elikya moves toward Neema; she may lightly 
touch Neema's ourstretched leg, it is hard to tell. Neema lowers her leg, 
then begins to stomp her feet on a platform as Elikya stands bipedally 
facing her; Elikya has a playface and raises her arms. Immediately, 
Neema moves to Elikya and hugs her, covering her with her whole body, 
then quickly moves back and resumes her previous position. 
Eleven months old, Elikya climbs up a chain-link fence outdoors and 
approaches Kanzi, her brother, who rests on his back in a hanging tire. 
Elikya stops, then extends one leg and foot to Kanzi. Kanzi opens his 
foot, spreading his big toe apart from the other toes, in Elikya's direction. 
Elikya climbs over Kanzi's body up to his face. Kanzi wraps his arms 
around Elikya and pats her. 14 
King uses material such as this to illustrate how infant bonobos (and 
in other examples, gorillas) begin to produce and comprehend commu­
nicative gestures as a means of coordinating their actions with their par­
ents and older siblings. Her work constitutes an invaluable analysis of 
the co-regulated process whereby infant great apes come to participate 
fully in their family groups.15 
CHIMPANZEES A N D  BONOBOS 
The first primatologist to investigate systematically the caregiving prac­
tices of nonhuman primates was Jane Goodall. Goodall has spent a life­
time studying an extended family of chimpanzees in Tanzania, called 
the "F" family. Through a series of books, films, and photographic 
records, she has enabled us to witness for ourselves the warm emotional 
bonds and rich emotional gesturing that characterize chimpanzee family 
dynamics. Presiding over the F family was Flo, an extraordinary matri­
arch who inspired great love in her infants Faben, Figan, Fifi, Flint, and 
Flame. The simple act of baptizing a chimpanzee with a proper name 
aroused a surprising amount of wrath amongst primatologists at the 
time. One of the first rules of studying nonhuman primates was that 
they should be referred to only by numbers and letters, never by names, 
for fear of committing the cardinal sin of "anthropomorphism." But 

1 1 2 
T H E  F I R S T  I D E A  
Goodall insisted on this practice. What Goodall most wanted was for us 
to recognize the "humanity" in these chimps: to see them, not as "savage 
brutes," but as creatures similar to ourselves who are capable of feeling 
deep love and affection for one another, display loyalty and trust, per­
form acts of kindness and self-sacrifice, experience sorrow and grief, and 
even feel awe at the mystery of life. 
Flo was between thirty-five and forty years old when Goodall started 
studying her in the 1 960s. You can easily tell from the films that Goodall 
made in the 1970s that this aging mother is finding child rearing exhaust­
ing.16 And yet she constantly pushes herself to care for her newest infant, 
Flint. It is clear that his needs always come first: He feeds before Flo even 
though she is hungry; she soothes him when he is frightened; is patient 
when he is fussy; tolerates his playful antics; and is always responsive to 
his overtures. In a way, one might almost say that she spoils Flint. It ap­
pears that she is simply too tired to fight with him when it is time for him 
to be weaned, and instead she allows him to continue nursing long past 
the point when it was no longer permitted for her other offspring. Sadly, 
this decision may have had dire consequences, for Flint was stricken by 
grief when Flo died. The bond between them was, Goodall speculates, 
just too strong for him to survive on his own. The scenes that show Flint 
pining over his mother's body, trying to tease a caress out of her lifeless 
arm, and then wasting away after her death, are profoundly moving and 
change forever one's perception of these creatures. 
What we have learned from Goodall's research is that, in chimps, 
infant development in all its aspects depends on a long-term caregiver. 
In the first eight months after birth, the mother satisfies the infant's 
physical and emotional needs. She remains the infant's primary source 
of security for at least the first five years. The infant suckles for around 
three minutes every hour and does not switch to solid foods until 
around his third year. At two months the infant is as helpless as a hu­
man infant, but his muscles for clinging and grasping develop quickly. 
In the early years, Flint would cling to Flo's ventrum when he was be­
ing carried. As he gained weight, he began to travel on Flo's back; later 
on, he crawled along Flo's body, which appears to have provided him 
with a secure playground for acquiring early motor coordination. Flo 
not only put up with all this but even encouraged it with gestures or 
by physically guiding his movements. 
At twelve weeks, Flint was strong enough to dangle from Flo by one 
hand, and soon after this he began to break contact with her. At four 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 1 3 
months, he could pull himself into a standing position beside Flo. He 
would attempt to walk on all fours but stumble, at which point Flo 
would quickly gather him up. At six months, he would venture a few 
steps away from Flo; at seven months, he started to move about on his 
own. Throughout these initial forays, Flint would constantly monitor 
his mother's face to provide himself with a sense of security. She encour­
aged him in his efforts and warned him when he began to stray too far 
through gestures, head nods, vocalizations, and facial expressions. 
Over the past thirty years, developmental psychologists have become 
fascinated with the phenomenon of attachment between caregivers and 
their infants and the factors that inhibit its healthy development. Watch­
ing these scenes of Flo caring for Flint, one realizes how important it is 
that John Bowlby's original paradigm be revised. Bowlby's studies on at­
tachment were informed by his readings in ethology: in particular, 
Lorenz's work on imprinting and Hinde's work on attachment behaviors 
in rhesus monkeys. 17 This led Bowlby to formulate his famous hypothe­
sis that attachment behaviors (in both infants and caregivers) were natu­
rally selected in order to protect the infant from predation.1s On this 
outlook, both "secure" and "avoidant" infant attachment behaviors can 
be seen as serving some predetermined evolutionary function. To be 
sure, Mary Ainsworth contributed a critical developmental dimension to 
this paradigm with her extensive research on the connection between a 
child's attachment behavior in the "strange situation" and prior measures 
of maternal sensitivity.19 But to this day, Bowlby's relatively narrow pic­
ture of the evolutionary origins of attachment behavior has continued to 
inform research in the area, as can be seen, for example, in the numerous 
attempts to reduce attachment to a psychobiological phenomenon.2o 
Given the climate in which he was writing, it is certainly understand­
able that Bowlby should have come up with his ethological view. After 
all, one need only think of the impact of Harlow's experiments on sepa­
ration and attachment to appreciate the reason why security should 
have been so uppermost in everyone's mind. But Bowlby extrapolated, 
from the behavior of care-deprived primates in fairly hostile conditions, 
to what conditions must have been like in our distant evolutionary past 
when attachment was "naturally selected." But Goodall's extensive re­
search on the "F" family presents a very different picture of the role and 
development of attachment. 
As with humans, chimpanzee mothers show a strong affection for 
their offspring and this bond persists throughout the life span. There is 

1 1 4 
T H E  F I R S T  I D E A  
just as much physical contact between Flo and Flint as between a hu­
man caregiver and her infant, and a considerable amount of emotional 
exchange involving gestures, facial expressions, body movements and 
posture, and vocalizations. Time and again we see Flo look at Flint with 
a gentle smile, and Flint responding with a wide grin. Flo smiles back, 
and then the two of them are off on a sustained bout of smiling, gestur­
ing, and vocalizing. Time and again we see the two of them engaged in 
gestural exchanges which Flint initiates as much as does Flo. 
Particularly interesting, as far as the present chapter is concerned, is 
how Flo dealt with her older daughter Fifi, who was fascinated by the 
new baby and was constantly trying to hold and handle him, to touch 
his face and gently shake him. In the beginning Flo would discourage 
this with a stern look on her face. But over time she allowed Fifi to have 
more contact with Flint, to hold him for longer periods, and to carry 
him while traveling with Flo. However, if Flint cried Flo would take 
him instantly. By playing with her baby brother, Fifi was learning and 
practicing maternal behavior, imitating what Flo did with Flint. When 
Fifi had her first baby her maternal style proved to be somewhat mote ·· 
relaxed than Flo's, as she allowed uncle Flint to touch baby Freud at 
only two weeks; but overall Fifi's maternal behavior, and even her facial 
expressions, were strikingly similar to Flo's. 
Goodall's research, together with that of Savage-Rumbaugh, King, 
and De Waal,21 provides us with a much richer understanding of the role 
of attachment behavior in nonhuman primates, and thus assuming that 
chimpanzees and bonobos may serve as a possible model for the behavior 
of the first hominids-a deeper understanding of the role of attachment 
in human evolution.22 Even more profound than its role in negotiating 
security is the role that attachment plays in the co-regulated affect signal­
ing that takes place between infants and caregivers. As we explained in 
Chapter 1, by the time we come to test infants in the "Strange Situa­
tion," they have already undergone a considerable amount of fie devel­
opment. It is through these attachment behaviors that nonhuman 
primate as well as human caregivers help their babies begin to learn to 
tame their catastrophic reactions and transform them into interactive sig­
nals. In both species we see the same sorts of vignette: For example, a 
mother smiles and the baby smiles back. She coos and the baby coos 
back. The baby smiles, raises his arms as if to say, "Hey!" and vocalizes 
emotionally needy sounds that convey "Look at me!" The mother looks 
his way. Baby then smiles and flirts and the mother flirts back. 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 1 5 
For this type of emotional signaling to occur, a baby needs to have 
been wooed into a warm pleasurable relationship with one or a few 
caregivers so that there is another being toward whom he experiences 
deep emotions, and, therefore, with whom he wants to communicate. 
Herein lies the deeper function of attachment. The baby needs opportu­
nities to be "intentional," to express an emotion or need by making a 
sound, using a facial expression, or making a gesture with his arm, and 
to have his efforts confirmed by being responded to. Of course, One key 
respect in which human beings are distinguished from nonhuman pri­
mates is the much longer period where the infant is fully dependent on 
his or her caregivers; for during this time, human infants continue to 
develop, use, and rely on nonverbal, gestural, emotional signals to meet 
their basic needs, interact, and communicate, which enables a child to 
develop language, reason, and higher states of consciousness (see Chap­
ter 2). But the important point here, as far as concerns the phenomenon 
of attachment, is that in nonhuman primates as much as in humans, at­
tachment provides continuous opportunities to learn and fine-tune the 
skills of emotional signaling that are used to communicate and negoti­
ate emotional states. 
By no means, then, is attachment confined to the sort of intense, 
even catastrophic emotions that we observe in nonhuman primate and 
human infants when they are exposed to stressful situations. But even in 
terms of survival, the role of attachment is more profound than is sug­
gested by Bowlby's narrow ethological point of view. For in order for 
both great apes and humans to survive, they not only had to protect 
their infants from predators; more fundamentally, they had to develop 
the capacity to live in groups. And, as we will see in Chapter 13, the 
very growth of this ability, and thus human survival itself, is derived 
from the same formative emotional processes that lead to symbol for­
mation and logical problem solving in the infant. 
Our work with nonhuman primates thus provides us with a striking 
insight into how critical the function of attachment must have been for 
the survival of early human groups, for it is through attachment with its 
caregivers that nonhuman primate babies, as much as human, come to 
absorb their group's distinctive manner of emotional communication. 
The upshot of this argument, as far as concerns our understanding of 
the nature of attachment, is that the full depth of this phenomenon 
cannot be gleaned from conditions that simply stress an infant's sense of 
security. Bowlby's attachment paradigm was based on the assumption 

1 1 6 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
that such conditions must have prevailed in our evolutionary past and 
that attachment developed as an adaptation to this challenge. To the de­
gree that these situations prevailed, Bowlby's ideas represented a truly 
pioneering contribution to our understanding one of the foundations of 
human relationships. However, modern studies of primates suggest that 
the original paradigm, as important as it was, was too narrow; that is, 
nonhuman primate dyads operate in a broad range of environmental 
contexts and ecologies, and under less threatening conditions we ob­
serve a broad array of attachment-type or relationship-type behaviors, as 
described above. 
In other words, even nonhuman primates are able to transform emo­
tions from the catastrophic level, which would be operative under condi­
tions of threat, to more differentiated affective expressions in a variety of 
patterns of co-regulation that typically permit- the complex social negoti­
ation of subtle affects dealing with themes of dependency, independence, 
and in between the two. What we glean from our fie approach to the 
study of attachment, therefore, is that, in the evolutionary sense, attach­
ment had to serve other purposes besides simply that of survival, of being . 
able to deal with catastrophic or threatening conditions. Attachment also 
had to serve as the foundation for co-regulated affect signaling, leading 
both to higher cognitive and communicative functions and to the forma­
tion and coherence of groups. 
It is not surprising, given the sorts of caregiving that we have looked at 
in this section, that chimpanzees are solidly established at the third level 
of fie development (see Chapter 2). They engage in sustained exchanges 
of emotional communication, and caregivers are sensitive to their infant's 
overtures, thereby developing the infant's capacity to initiate and re­
spond. In Chapter 4 we will see how, through co-regulated interactions, 
juveniles move into higher levels of fie development, including problem­
solving and recognition, and have a wide range of emotions. 
THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF 
FUNCTIONAL/EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
Tamarins and Marmosets 
As one would expect, we see far less co-regulating communication be­
tween caregivers and their infants in the so-called "lower orders" of non-
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 1 7 
human primates. A perfect example of this can be observed in the Cal­
litrichids, the New World tamarins and marmosets found in the tropical 
forests of Central and South America. Because of their small size and 
beautiful coloration, these creatures are perennial favorites at zoos all 
over the world. They can be as small as 5 inches (130 mm), their tails as 
long as 6 inches (150 mm). They look like other primates who cling 
vertically to trees, their forelimbs shorter than their hind limbs, but 
their hands and feet resemble those of squirrels and they have very sharp 
claws that they use to dig into the bark of trees. 
What is most interesting about the Callitrichids for our purposes is 
their style of caregiving, which is often a family enterprise. In species 
that routinely twin, fathers aid with the birth and carry the infants 
around fairly soon after birth while the mother forages, only transfer­
ring them back when the infants need to nurse. Pygmy marmoset in­
fants weigh only around 0.5 ounces ( 1 5  g) at birth and are completely 
helpless. They require constant care for the first two weeks and are 
nursed for up to three months. They generally become sexually mature 
between twelve and eighteen months and reach adult size by the age of 
two. The same thing is seen in the Emperor tamarin. A newborn Em­
peror is completely helpless. It weighs around 1 ounce (35 g) and has a 
coat of short hair. The mother needs to feed her baby every two or three 
hours for about a half hour each time, after which she returns the baby 
to the father. The babies ride around on the backs of their parents for 
six or seven weeks, and at around two or three months they go through 
a weaning period. Most tamarins become sexually mature from around 
sixteen to twenty months and the life span of the species is between ten 
and twenty years. 
Such a short infancy allows only a brief period in which the infant 
can develop its ability to engage in emotional communication. Immedi­
ately after birth, the baby clings tightly to its mother or father's back, its 
head buried in the crook of the parent's neck, or it is held tightly to its 
caregiver's body while being licked all over. As it grows older, the infant 
spends more and more time looking at its caregiver's face and staring 
into its eyes. A lot of vocalizing goes on during these episodes of shared 
gaze, and when it is time to be weaned, the infant can be seen calling for 
food, to which the caregiver responds by slowly extending something to 
eat. Tamarin and marmoset infants demonstrate a keen interest in sen­
sory experiences (sights, sounds, touch, and movement), poking their 
head up and looking around with very quick, darting movements. And 

1 1 8 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
they can be seen to calm down when held or nursed. We would thus sit­
uate Callitrichids as mastering the first stage of fie development; that is, 
infants learn to be relatively calm and focused. But there is little evi­
dence that they are capable of mastering the second stage of fie develop­
ment; that is, of experiencing deeper feelings of engagement. 
Rhesus Monkeys 
Rhesus monkeys, which are found throughout India, Nepal, and west­
ern Afghanistan, are up to 25 inches (62 cm) long with a 1 2-inch (30 
cm) tail. They live in troops of as many as a couple of hundred individ­
uals. Life in these troops is highly interactive: full of play behavior, 
grooming, and even, according to some, the first vestiges of gossip. The 
troops have a matrilineal hierarchical structure, even though the males 
are dominant. In recent years, primatologists have come to view these 
monkey societies as hives of political intrigue: To survive in this envi­
ronment, an infant has to acquire street smarts at an early age so that it 
can form strong political alliances. 
Much of our knowledge about the caregiving behavior of these mon­
keys comes from Carol Berman's studies of a free-ranging population on 
Cayo Santiago, a small island off the coast of Puerto Rico.23 Scientists 
collected data on the animals from 1974 to 1990 and found a direct cor­
relation between caregiving styles and the size of the group. The smaller 
the group, the less time mothers spent with their infants and the more 
those infants were allowed to interact with other adults; the larger the 
group, the more the infant's social network was restricted to kin mem­
bers and the more time mothers spent with their infants in close proxim­
ity. This finding suggests to us that the ability of rhesus monkeys to live 
in large troops is grounded in strong caregiver-infant ties. 
Although a baby rhesus doesn't express its positive affects with the 
same sorts of wide joyful smiles that we see in human infants between 
the ages of two and five months, in other respects it behaves in a man­
ner similar to that of a human infant. The rhesus baby spends lots of 
time snuggling into its mother's body or looking keenly at her face. It 
visibly relaxes while being rocked, and vocalizes happily when the 
mother plays with it. We can even see the baby rhythmically moving its 
arms and legs and vocalizing in time to its caregiver's movements and 
vocalizations. 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 1 9 
Perhaps the greatest source of our understanding of the similarity be­
tween a rhesus and a human infant mastering the second stage of engag­
ing and relating with a caregiver comes from Harry Harlow's infamous 
experiments on rhesus monkeys in the 1950s and '60s. Harlow's experi­
ments have been widely vilified as representing the cruelty to animals 
that scientists are capable of if their research is not carefully monitored. 
Pictures of baby rhesus monkeys clinging to a cloth "mother," or, worse 
still, one of the wire contraptions that Harlow built, are a standard fea­
ture in textbooks on child development. Deborah Blum's Love at Goon 
Park clarifies this picture, however, by situating Harlow's work within 
the context of mid-twentieth-century psychology.24 It would appear 
that Harlow set out to challenge the then-prevailing behaviorist hostil­
ity towards any mention of the role of affect in a child's development. 
Harlow was trying to build up a population of rhesus monkeys for 
experimental purposes-something that had never been attempted be­
fore-and was raising infants in very much the sort of sterile conditions 
that behaviorists were then prescribing for human infants. Despite the 
meticulous care they received, the animals were growing up afflicted 
with severe emotional, social, and physical disorders. Harlow intro­
duced his "cloth mothers" into the infants' cages to see whether the in­
fants might thrive if they had something comfortable to cling to. 
Harlow introduced the infamous wire "mothers" as a control to satisfy 
his critics that it was not the feeding that was drawing the animals but 
the comfort of the cloth "mother." Harlow showed that even when the 
food was placed only on the wire surrogates, the monkeys still spent the 
majority of their time on the cloth ones. 
Although it was clear that the infants were deriving great comfort 
from the cloth-covered surrogates, they still suffered from striking social 
and emotional disorders. They would rock back and forth to soothe 
themselves, stare into space, and compulsively suck their thumbs. Worse 
still, the appearance of other monkeys would startle them and cause 
them to stare at the floor of the cage. The latter behavior was disastrous, 
given Harlow's goal of building up a captive population for research 
purposes, so he set the surrogates in motion to see whether movement 
would further encourage the development of a healthy nervous system. 
This modification did result in some improvement, although still not to 
the extent of creating animals capable of breeding. 
What is so interesting about the latter modification is that, in addi­
tion to stimulating the rhythmicity of the infant's movements, these 

1 20 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
swinging surrogates may also have started to stimulate the infant's ca­
pacity for emotional communication. One of the most telling of all 
comments about these experiments came from a colleague of Harlow's: 
"I've come to realize that the mobile surrogate was more like a real mon­
key than we had expected . . . .  [The moving surrogate] provided a lim­
ited simulation of social interaction, which the stationary surrogate did 
not."25 Harlow's team may have inadvertently discovered just how im­
portant such interaction is-even the caricature of interaction that oc­
curred with the moving surrogate-for enabling a rhesus infant to 
develop the capacity to manage its way in a troop. 
For the model of fl e development that we are presenting in this book, 
we would argue that the outcome of Berman's studies and Harlow's ex­
periments reveals that, to survive in the complex world of a rhesus 
troop, infants develop the capacity to experience deeper feelings of en­
gagement (the second of our stages) only through warm emotional rela­
tionships with their caregivers. We would thus hypothesize that the 
longer period of infancy that we see in rhesus monkeys than in tamarins 
and marmosets-rhesus infancy lasts up to eighteen months-allows 
for more emotional communication. The infant thereby comes to de­
velop the particular emotions and behaviors that are favored by the 
group, and, indeed, that define it. That is, the enculturation of the in­
fant is inextricably involved in the growth of its mind. The types of ges­
turing that cultivate shared assumptions in a group, and that underpin 
the group's implicit processes for dealing with danger, aggression, and 
assertiveness, are literally bred into the infant in these formative early 
stages of development. Without these experiences, an infant rhesus will 
display the sort of stunted, autistic behavior that was observed in Har­
low's lab. 
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN 
LENGTH OF INFANCY AND 
FUNCTI ONAL/EM OTI ONAL DEVELOP MENT 
Building on Kathleen Gibson and Dean Falk's work showing that 
longer periods of dependency facilitated the extended learning that is 
associated with the evolution of bigger-brained and more intelligent pri­
mates,26 we would hypothesize that a direct connection exists between 
the length of infancy and the fie development of a species: The longer

the infancy, the more opportunity there is for an infant to engage in and 
thereby develop its capacity for emotional communication.27 With an 
extended infancy, infants and their caregivers spend more time in close 
emotional as well as physical contact with one another; more time com­
municating with each other through co-regulated gestures, body move­
ments, vocalizations, and, in the higher primates, facial expressions; 
more time engaging in joint activities such as food sharing, or acquiring 
problem-solving and tool-solving skills; more time playing with each 
other; and more time mastering the social behavior of their group. It is 
because of the impact these exchanges have on the growth of the mind, 
and, indeed, on the development of the brain, that comparative psy­
chologists have found such a striking correlation between a species' 
length of infancy and its scores on the sorts of intelligence tests that are 
administered to young infants. This correlation is demonstrated in the 
following chart and tables:

1 23 
As interesting as this Piagetian framework is, however, it provides us 
with little insight into the developmental factors that promote these 
kinds of cognitive advances. There has been something of a tendency­
which runs contrary to Piaget's own constructivist outlook-to view 
these charts in predetermined, linear terms; that is, as registering how the 
different primate species have a biologically fixed cognitive capacity that 
increases, for strictly genetic reasons, as the ratio of a species' brain-to­
body-size increases.28 For our purposes, the significance of these charts is 
the relation between length of infancy and levels of cognitive develop­
ment. Thus, rhesus monkeys demonstrate causal understanding, are cu­
rious and exploratory, and are purposive in their actions because of the 
time they spend as babies snuggling into mother's body, looking keenly 
at her face, and playing with and moving rhythmically in time to her 
movements and vocalizations. Apes have been able to count and sort and 
combine things, and even acquire symbolic skills, because, as we will see 
in the next chapter, their infants engage in long emotional exchanges 
that involve flexible reading and responding to multisensory cues (such 
as facial expressions, hand gestures, body posture, and the like). Further­
more, our model allows for a more complex profile of a species' cognitive 
skills than this Piagetian framework suggests. For example, monkeys may 
score on the fourth or fifth substage of sensorimotor development for 
problem-solving tasks but considerably higher on tasks involving spatial 
memory. Intelligence as such cannot be reduced to a single metric, nor 
can its development be explained as purely maturational. 
A MODEL FOR EARLY H O M INIDS 
Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and I (S.G.S.) have often discussed how the more 
time we spend with the bonobos, the more we feel we are glimpsing the 
dawn of our own species.29 It is so easy when you are with them to imag­
ine that here before you is a family of Australopithecines bound together 
by all sorts of rich attachment and communication. 
The truth is that we know very little about the earliest hominids, the 
Ardepithecines and Australopithecines. Indeed, after the remarkable 
discovery of the Chad skull and the so-called Millennium Man in 
2000, paleoanthropologists are now seriously debating whether the 
hominid lineage can be traced back even further, to Sahelanthropus 
tchadensis, a creature that existed between 7 and 6 million years ago, 

1 24 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
and Orrorin tugenensis, which existed approximately 6 million years 
ago. The former displays ape-like features (e.g., a small brain size) and 
some hominid characteristics (e.g., a brow ridge and small canines). 
There is no evidence that SaheLanthropus was bipedal, but there is evi­
dence that 0. tugensis, which was about the same size as the chim­
panzee, was bipedal. The debate over whether either of these creatures 
constitutes the first hominid is likely to be quite lively over the next few 
years, but what is already becoming apparent is that, because 0. tuge­
nensis was still living in a forested area, we need to reconsider our views 
about why hominids became bipedal (infra). 
The current thinking amongst paleoanthropologists is that the Ardep­
ithecines existed between 5.8 and 4.4 million years ago and the Australo­
pithecines between 5.3 and 1.6 million years ago. The fossil evidence 
indicates that both AustraLopithecus anamensis and A. aforensis were partly 
arboreal creatures, conclusions drawn from the shape of their feet, hands, 
and shoulders. Their skeletons reveal the same sort of strong sexual di­
morphism as is seen in chimpanzees and bonobos, and their first perma­
nent molar erupted at the same time as that of chimpanzees and 
bonobos, which suggests that they reached sexual maturity at the same 
time and had approximately the same infancy and life span. Paleoanthro­
pologists have concluded that the Australopithecines are best described 
as bipedal human-like apes. For this reason, we speculate that they had 
cognitive skills, communicative behaviors, and social organizations simi­
lar to those we see today in chimpanzees or bonobos. 
A few paleoanthropologists have suggested that some of the crude 
stone tools that have been attributed to Homo habiLis may, in fact, have 
been created by Australopithecines. If this were so, Australopithecines 
must have possessed a fair amount of foresight: Because only specific 
types of stone could be used to manufacture a hand-axe, they would 
have had to learn where these deposits were located. The archaeologist 
Nick Toth has shown that a considerable amount of practice and skill is 
required to produce the kind of stone tools that the earliest hominids 
left behind. 3D One particularly interesting experiment that Toth per­
formed on Kanzi certainly seems to bear out the possibility that Aus­
tralopithecus possessed this ability. Curious to see whether Kanzi could 
learn how to make stone tools, Toth baited a clear plexiglass trap with 
some food. The trap was bound by stout cord that was too thick for 
Kanzi to bite through, but he could easily sever it with a stone knife. 
Toth then demonstrated the art of stone knapping for Kanzi. After a 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 25 
few clumsy attempts to imitate Toth's actions-difficult for Kanzi, be­
cause of the shape of his hands-Kanzi hit on his own technique of 
throwing one stone against another to produce a flake with a sharp 
edge. Kanzi immediately proceeded to use this to cut the rope. Kanzi 
has since become a proficient stone knapper, unerringly choosing the 
sharpest of the flakes that he produces to use as his knife. 
Whether or not Australopithecines were capable of producing stone 
tools, it is almost certain that, like chimpanzees, they were constructing 
tools out of more perishable materials, such as wood and leaves. Chim­
panzees in the wild have been found making tools out of twigs to fish 
out termites, or using stones and large branches to crack open hard 
nuts, or using special types of leaves to collect or soak up water. For a 
long time it was thought that chimpanzees respond only to environ­
mental contingencies, but chimpanzees have been observed choosing 
appropriate tools well in advance of using them and transporting them 
to a tool-working site. It is highly likely that Ausrralopithecines would 
have shared these abilities, which for our purposes suggests that they 
would likely have had the same sorts of nonhuman primate caregiving 
practices that support the development of such skills. 
Both chimpanzees and bonobos continually assess relationships and 
maintain them at some cost, for they use relationships for various goals 
and negotiate over different aspects of the expression of their relation­
ships. Chimpanzees cultivate tense male-male relationships based on 
shifting dominance ranks, but females play a subordinate role. Amongst 
bonobos, however, the females form strong alliances, which, according to 
the primatologist Richard Wrangham, accounts for the more harmo­
nious and stable social existence that bonobos enjoy)! We are only just 
starting to understand the subtlety and importance that gestures, body 
movements, facial expressions, and posture play in creating and main­
taining individual social relationships and group cohesion amongst 
chimpanzees and bonobos)2 It is clear, however, that the social organiza­
tion of chimpanzees and bonobos is far more complex than was thought 
as little as a generation ago. 
Savage-Rumbaugh and others have reported that bonobos in the wild 
may follow rules as a means of maintaining their stable group behavior)3 
Such a phenomenon would be of the utmost importance insofar as it 
means that bonobos are starting to reach our fourth level of fl e develop­
ment, for rule following provides an essential foundation for the sorts of 
problem-solving abilities which, as we will see in the following section, 

1 26 
T H E  F I RS T  I DEA 
are the hallmark of the fourth stage. When we talk about rule following 
we are, of course, talking about more than merely patterned or condi­
tioned behavior. To claim that bonobos are capable of following rules, we 
need evidence of instruction directed to young or new members of the 
group about the nature of the rule and when and where it applies, as well 
as evidence of sanctions against those who break the rule, and perhaps 
even awareness on the part of the rule breaker that a rule has been bro­
ken. The bonobos studied by Savage-Rumbaugh and her colleagues at 
Wamba, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, present us with some 
intriguing signs of such behavior. 
The scientists working at Wamba regularly provide sugar cane at des­
ignated feeding sites so they can observe the bonobos close-up. It seems 
that when it arrives at one of these sites, the group has to wait for some 
sort of signal from the alpha male before his subordinates can commence 
feeding. In one sequence captured on a film made by the Japanese pro­
duction company NHK, a juvenile male can be seen taking a piece of 
sugar cane before the signal has been given by the alpha. As the juvenile 
surreptitiously reaches, he is caught in the act: An infant standing up­
right beside the alpha sees what the juvenile is doing and begins to vocal­
ize excitedly. The second the infant starts to vocalize, the alpha looks 
directly at the offending party. He then stands fully erect and, with a 
stern look on his face, slowly raises his right arm. The juvenile responds 
immediately by approaching the alpha submissively. As he approaches 
the alpha, he turns around and presents his back in a crouching position. 
In what looks like a symbolic act of punishment, the alpha steps on the 
juvenile's exposed back and then turns to the others. The juvenile retreats 
to the outer limit of the group, where he sits dejectedly waiting to be 
given permission to join the others in feeding. 
Does this small vignette offer us a glimpse into the kinds of rudimen­
tary social rules that bonobos in the wild might follow? Evidence to 
confirm such an interpretation has been documented by Sue in her 
work with the bonobos at the Language Research Center. For example, 
in one particularly striking scene in the video Kanzi: An Ape Genius, we 
see Kanzi's sister Panbanisha playing a little too boisterously with the 
family dog. At one point, she jumps with all her weight on its back, 
which sends the poor dog yelping into the bushes. Sue is not going to 
stand for this sort of behavior and immediately begins to berate Pan­
banisha. Panbanisha adopts a facial expression of utter contrition and 
then hits the lexigram key for "milk" on the board that Sue is carrying a 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 27 
sign that she intends to be good. Then Panbanisha quite deliberately 
goes over to the dog and gently pats his back. This isn't just an animal 
who has learned to appease Sue's anger; this is a social creature who, 
whether or not she is genuinely sorry, has clearly learned how to apolo­
gize for her actions. 
There are also accounts in the primatological literature of deception 
by a subordinate chimpanzee, demonstrated when a group member takes 
a piece of food or furtively mates while monitoring the movements or at­
tention of a more powerful conspecific. Again, in the film of the bonobos 
at Wamba made by NHK, there is an intriguing scene in which a juve­
nile male, eager to initiate sex with one of the alpha male's females, looks 
at her and gestures towards a tree at the edge of the clearing. She re­
sponds to this overture with a facial expression that can best be described 
as "demure." Shortly after, the male moves to the tree while she follows as 
unobtrusively as possible and, sure enough, the two mate, both of them 
clearly monitoring the movements of the alpha all the while. 
Does such behavior indicate that apes follow simple rules? Of course, 
one can always try to explain it as the result of some type of condition­
ing. But by categorically dismissing the possibility of nonhuman pri­
mate normative behavior, we rule out the possibility that the great apes 
participate in a community that follows social conventions. Moreover, 
we have all sorts of evidence from ape language research that apes can 
grasp and follow rules. Once again, a personal experience vividly illus­
trates this point. 
This question of whether bonobos are capable of following rules was 
one of the very first that I asked Sue when we began working together, 
for it make little sense to investigate whether bonobos can acquire lin­
guistic skills, however primitive these might be, if they cannot grasp 
simple rules. Sue's response was that Kanzi absolutely loved playing 
games that involve complex rules. Incredulous, I asked for an example, 
so she offered to have Kanzi play against me in a "Pac-Man" face-off. 
For readers who are not familiar with Pac-Man, it is a computer game in 
which the player operates a joystick to avoid being captured by aliens 
and at the same time eats as many cherries as possible, and also special 
bonus targets when these suddenly become available. I went first and 
did rather well. Then it was Kanzi's turn: With a look of rapt attention 
he sat before the computer screen waiting for the game to start, his hand 
poised on the joystick (which itself was an arresting sight). As soon as 
the game started, he began gobbling up the cherries, always careful to 

1 28 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
keep his player inside the lines, which, of course, is one of the basic rules 
of the game. He did his best to avoid the hungry aliens, vocalizing excit­
edly as they got near his player. Not only did he absolutely delight in the 
game, but, as Sue had predicted, he did indeed do better than I did. 
The possibility that bonobos in the wild engage in normative behav­
ior is especially important when we try to extrapolate from primatology 
about the possible social behavior of Australopithecines. We now be­
lieve that the Australopithecines lived in groups of from sixty to seventy 
individuals, which is approximately the size of bonobo troops in the 
wild. As we can see from the above, the evidence shows that the nonhu­
man primates who live in populations of this size have developed ad­
vanced social, cognitive, and communicative capacities. One of the 
most extraordinary of all suggestions in recent years, however, is that 
they may even have developed primitive symbolic abilities. Once again, 
the bonobos at Wamba present an informative example. 
When up to seventy individuals live in a troop, a feeding site is 
quickly stripped of all its fruit. So bonobos constantly have to travel to 
new feeding sites, just to meet their basic needs. But because traveling 
through the forest as a group can be a highly perilous endeavor, they 
split up into small subgroups and leave several hundred yards between 
them. This way, if there is an attack by predators or a rival troop, the 
risk of the entire group's being destroyed is lessened. But now consider 
the logistics involved: All these subgroups start from the same point and 
arrive at the same point at the end of the day after traveling through 
dense forest as silently as possible. How are they able to coordinate such 
a difficult task? Evidence reported by Savage-Rumbaugh and colleagues 
suggests that they accomplish this feat by leaving markers for each other 
along the way.34 For example, at a fork in a path, they might position a 
log or trample on the vegetation in a way that indicates which path to 
take or whether to climb a nearby tree. There are even indications that 
they leave signs for each other about a rich feeding site, perhaps where 
insects can be found at such-and-such a depth. 
The richer our understanding of chimpanzees and bonobos becomes, 
the more interesting it is to view these great apes as a potential resource 
for modeling the capacities of our early hominid ancestors,35 When pale­
oanthropologists made their first great discoveries of the Australo­
pithecines, they were primarily driven by the desire to find fossil evidence 
of the "missing link." But in recent years, we have begun to think seri­
ously about the sorts of cognitive, communicative, and social capacities 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 29 
that the Australopithecines might have inherited from earlier hominins.36 
The picture that is emerging is one of creatures that were able to maintain 
ever more complex forms of social organization. 
As we remarked earlier, for early hominids to live in relatively large 
and stable social groups, they had to acquire the ability to co-regulate 
emotional interactions by using facial expressions, vocalizations, and ges­
tures. When emotional signals can be rapidly exchanged, two or more 
parties can reciprocally communicate their intentions and negotiate, 
much as in the example above of the juvenile bonobo who is caught try­
ing to feed before the others. The great apes and humans can co-regulate 
emotions and intentions to a much greater degree than other animals. As 
we can see in the harmonious social existence that bonobos enjoy, the 
process of negotiation and co-regulation enables individuals to tame cata­
strophic emotions, such as fear and aggression, which tend to compel im­
mediate action (see Chapter 1). Through emotional communication, two 
parties can regulate each other's feelings and behaviors to reduce fear, cre­
ate a sense of safety, gradually modulate each other's aggression, and build 
cooperation.3? 
Co-regulated emotional interaction, which marks our third stage of fie 
development, enabled Australopithecines to communicate very rapidly 
with one another, which was vital for them to live in groups of sixty or 
seventy individuals. This progression to the third stage offle development 
may, in fact, be intimately connected to the emergence of bipedality. For 
over the course of hominid evolution, living together in groups increased 
efficiency and partially freed up individuals from full-time devotion to 
meeting basic needs (food, shelter), which, in turn, created opportunities 
for them to be more creative. Using nonverbal means of communication 
for purposes other than short-term survival permitted the development of 
ever more advanced forms of thought and language. The key question, 
then, is this: What were the evolutionary forces at work that enhanced 
this capacity to engage in co-regulated emotional interaction? 
THE ROLE OF CAREGIVING 
PRACTICES IN THE EVOLUTION 
OF EMOTIONAL INTERACTION 
In the evolutionary scenario that we are sketching here, if, as many 
paleoanthropologists currently speculate, the emergence of bipedalism 

1 30 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
resulted in a gradual increase in the brain size of adult hominids and 
correspondingly longer periods of what scientists refer to as the 
"neotony" and "secondary altriciality" of their infants, then the emer­
gence of bipedalism would have played a key role in the development of 
ever more sophisticated caregiving practices.38 ("Neotony" refers to the 
retention of juvenile features in the adult of a species and the slowing of 
development; "secondary altriciality" refers to the complete helplessness 
of a human infant.) Some have even suggested that our infants can be 
said to be born approximately nine months prematurely to accommo­
date our large brains with female bipedality. The more immature the 
newborn the more essential caregiving practices are for the development 
of its brain. This is because the more pronounced the neotony and sec­
ondary altriciality of a species, the more variable are its newborn's basic 
biological capacities, and thus, the more critical species-typical caregiv­
ing practices are for the development of species-typical capacities. 
We saw in Chapter 2 how these basic biological abilities can vary. Ba­
bies come into the world equipped with a wide range of sensory, infor­
mation-processing, and motor-control capacities. Caregivers have to . 
learn which rhythms, touches, and sounds calm an infant effectively; 
and, conversely, they must discover the sorts of animated voices, facial 
expressions, body movements, and gestures that will stimulate an in­
fant's desire to interact socially or to explore her world. Furthermore, we 
have to bear in mind the extraordinary spurt in brain growth that the 
infant is undergoing at this time. The more she can develop her senses, 
the more the connections in the cortex that integrate this information 
will be forged, thereby further enhancing the child's ability to explore 
her senses and her environment. The importance of this intricate dance 
can be seen in infants who do not receive the kind of soothing they 
need to become calm and focused; indeed, they quickly become listless 
and self-absorbed, and they even lose muscle tone. 
We would speculate that the challenges contemporary caregivers must 
deal with in this respect have much in common with the challenges that 
early hominid caregivers were faced with, and that the caregiving prac­
tices we enjoy are the product of caregiving practices that were developed 
over the long course of our evolutionary history. Perhaps even some of 
the most striking anatomical features of hominid evolution, such as the 
loss of facial hair and the development of a complex facial musculature, 
are intimately bound up with the growing helplessness and dependency 
Nonhuman Primates and the Earliest Hominids 
1 3 1  
of the hominid infant. For the more complex the emotional signaling, 
the more complex the facial muscles and the more subtle the expressions 
required to support this. Bur, as we saw in Chapter 2, although the ca­
pacity to develop species-typical facial expressions of affect rests on cer­
tain basic biological templates, the actual development of those facial 
expressions is contingent on species-typical experiences of emotional ges­
turing. The patterns of behavior that provide these experiences are cul­
turally, not biologically, transmitted from one generation to the next. 
Furthermore, the skills required to establish the shared rhythms and ges­
tures that calm an infant and create attachment are culturally transmit­
ted. No doubt many hominid groups were unable to maintain these 
cultural practices and died our, but others were able not only to transmit 
these skills but also to develop new practices that raised their infants to a 
higher level of emotional development, and thence, a higher level of cog­
nitive, communicative, and social development.

Problem-Solving Collaborations: 
Chimpanzees and Early Humans 
IN THIS CHAPTER, WE will explore the hypothesis that early hu­
mans were becoming established at our fourth stage of functional! 
emotional development. In this fourth stage, long chains of problem:. 
solving interactions start to emerge. Based on certain evidence from 
the fossil record, which we will discuss below, it appears that these early 
humans would have been capable of engaging in a minimum of fifty to 
sixty exchanges in a row. As we will see, the development of these basic 
psychological skills leads to more complex group behavior. 
PATTERN RECOGNITION 
AN D PRO BLEM SOLVING 
The fourth stage of fie development holds the key to one of the major 
problems raised by the field of Artificial Intelligence in the latter half of 
the twentieth century. One of the central insights of AI is that pattern 
recognition is essential for the development of the human mind. AI sci­
entists devoted considerable effort to exploring the processes whereby 
different sorts of pattern recognition skills-visual-spatial, auditory­
vocal, individual-social-are slowly built up out of simple discrete 
units as an individual interacts with the world. The great stumbling 
block for AI, however, was to explain the origins of these pattern­
recognition skills.

1 33 
Because AI was so firmly entrenched in the mechanist tradition of 
psychological explanation,l it completely overlooked the role of emo­
tions in the development of the mind. Instead, AI scientists sought to 
treat the development of pattern-recognition skills as a purely cognitive 
phenomenon: the result of certain strategies by which the brain pro­
cesses stimuli. According to AI, these strategies are part of the brain's in­
trinsic architecture. But this argument simply replaced one mystery 
with another: Where did these built-in strategies come from? The solu­
tion, which continues to inform modern evolutionary psychology,2 is 
that they must have been naturally selected at the "genetic dawn" of our 
species (whenever that might have been). But such a method of postu­
lating the necessary explanation represents, as Russell once put it, "all 
the advantages of theft over honest toil."3 
What we are arguing here is that the emergence of these pattern recog­
nition skills was part of a long evolutionary process that goes back to the 
Australopithecines, and even beyond them to earlier hominid species, 
and, indeed, to the Common Ancestor. In the critical fourth stage of fIe 
development, infants begin to engage in long chains of co-regulated af­
fective interactions, which enables them to recognize the various patterns 
involved in satisfying their emotional needs. Based on culturally trans­
mitted caregiving practices, they learn what different kinds of gestures 
and facial expressions signify. They learn that certain kinds of facial ex­
pressions, tones of voice, and behavior are connected with an individual's 
mood or intentions, or with certain sounds and actions, and so on. 
Moreover, as we saw in Chapter 2, this ability to recognize patterns is es­
sential if a child is to have and act upon expectations. Now the toddler 
knows when to expect different kinds of responses from her caregiver, or 
what love, anger, respect, and shame feel like. And just as a child is learn­
ing all these patterns in her second year, before she has developed signifi­
cant language skills, so too, we would speculate, early humans, and even, 
to some extent, nonhuman primates and early hominids, were develop­
ing these pattern-recognition skills-and the sense of self that results­
long before the explosion of symbolic thinking that is associated with 
anatomically modern human beings. 
In Chapter 2, we divided this important stage into four levels accord­
ing to how complex the emotional signaling and problem solving be­
come. These levels include an Action Level, without much two-way 
emotional signaling; a Fragmented Level, with islands of intentional, 

1 34 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
emotional signaling and problem-solving behavior; a Polarized Level, 
with patterns of emotional signaling expressing only one or another 
feeling state; and an Integrated Level, with long chains of interactions in­
volving different emotional patterns organized into problem-solving ex­
changes such as flirting, seeking closeness, and getting help. 
It is intriguing to consider whether we can see a similar progression 
reflected in the fossil record between the cognitive and communicative 
abilities of Homo habilis and Homo erectus. That is, it is intriguing to 
consider whether there is evidence to support the hypothesis that early 
humans were gradually moving up through these four levels of the 
fourth stage of fie development. 
In Chapter 3, we inferred, on the basis of what we know about the 
great apes and the fact that early hominids would have enjoyed greater 
freedom of movement and the use of their hands,. that these caregivers 
would have spent more time touching, massaging, and tickling their in­
fants, playing with their arms and legs, and holding them gently while 
rocking back-and-forth. It goes without saying that the same practices 
would have carried over into early humans. But, as we will see now, the 
emergence of early humans, who existed between 2.5 and 0.25 million 
years ago, was marked by the introduction of an important new range of 
caregiving practices. Indeed, these new caregiving practices were instru­
mental in the transition from prehuman hominids to the genus Homo. 
APE COLLABO RATIONS 
One morning, I showed up early at the lab to find Sue and Kanzi using 
a lexigram board and deeply engrossed in a conversation. When I say 
"conversation," I really do mean exactly that. As we will see in the fol­
lowing chapter, the apes at the Language Research Center have acquired 
quite remarkable symbolic skills by using a tool that Duane Rumbaugh 
developed in the 1 970s, when he was working with the chimpanzee 
Lana. Duane designed the lexigram board to circumvent some of the 
limitations of earlier studies in ape language. In the beginning, re­
searchers had tried to mold apes' vocalizations, but, as became clear 
from Virginia and Keith Hayes's research4 with the chimpanzee Vicky, 
the structure of the vocal chords and nasal cavity and the manner of 
breathing make human sounds very difficult for chimps to produce. Re­
searchers in ape language switched to working with a simplified form of 
Chimpanzees and Early Humans 
1 35 
sign language. The most famous of the latter studies was started by 
Beatrix and Allan Gardner with the chimpanzee Washoe, and then con­
tinued by Roger and Deborah Fouts over the past thirty years.5 This 
study was far more successful, yet, because signing was still a fairly diffi­
cult task for chimps (given the musculature of their hands and faces), 
Rumbaugh developed the lexigram board as an alternative way to assess 
an ape's communicative capacities.6 
Lexigrams are colorful iconic symbols arranged either on a computer 
keyboard or on portable laminated boards. By pressing the keys on the 
computer board in the proper sequence, Lana could turn on music, 
watch slides, open a window, dispense food and drinks, and invite 
people into her room to visit and play. To be sure, this technology is not 
without its own serious drawbacks. For one thing, it imposes a linear or­
der on communication; and for another, it can be extremely difficult to 
memorize all 250 keys on the board. In fact, it often takes new workers 
at the lab up to a year to become proficient, which only makes Kanzi 
and Panbanisha's facility with the board that much more remarkable. 
But the lexigram board does provide us with a way of circumventing 
some of the limitations of the earlier studies that were due more to 
anatomical than to cognitive factors. 
On the particular morning in question, what struck me most force-
fully was not Kanzi's mastery of the lexigram board but the incredible 
gestural dance that Sue and Kanzi were engaged in, which was centered 
on the portable board but not confined to it. Both were busy touching 
symbols, mostly taking turns, but occasionally pressing a key before the 
other had finished. All the while, as they argued about the day's activity, 
they engaged in a constant flurry of looks, gestures, facial expressions, 
head nods, changes in posture, and arm and leg movements. Sue wanted 
us all to go for a cookout in the forest, an idea that required a consider­
able amount of consultation about what we should have for our lunch 
and where we should have it. Scattered throughout the forest are sixteen 
sites, each with a different name, and each stocked with a different kind 
of food in a cooler. Kanzi selects the location he wants by pointing either 
to a lexigram symbol or to a photograph of the location, or by hitting the 
lexigram key for the distinct kind of food kept at a particular site. On 
this particular occasion, Sue had wanted to go to Treehouse, but Kanzi 
was quite insistent that we go to A-Frame, and he kept pushing away the 
Treehouse photograph. He then started pointing towards the key for 
"ball," shaking his head, knitting his brows, and even frowning. All this 

1 36 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
left Sue slightly confused because there were, to the best of her knowl­
edge, no toys at A-Frame. But when we arrived there, it turned out that 
Kanzi had indeed left a ball when he last visited A-Frame several days be­
fore with Mary, one of the scientists at the lab. 
Without question, my favorite activity at the LRC is going on these 
cookouts with Kanzi or Panbanisha. They will choose the location that 
they want to visit and then lead the way, either by gesturing when we 
come to a fork in the trail or else by taking one of us by the hand and 
leading us in the right direction. Along the way, they are constantly ges­
turing: sometimes to request a game of chase, or to point to an animal in 
the bushes, or even to chide you for being so slow. When we reach the 
site, a ritual begins, Kanzi chipping in by breaking the sticks for Sue or 
helping to cook the food. In the NHK video Kanzi: An Ape Genius, one 
incredible scene shows Sue asking Kanzi whether he wants to light the 
fire for her, and telling him that he can fish the lighter out of her pocket. 
He then inserts his hand, extracts the lighter, and after a couple of tries 
he succeeds in getting a flame. Gingerly he touches the flame to the twigs 
and, when the fire starts up, he drops the lighter and stares wide-eyed at 
the fire, on his face a look of fear mixed with surprise and sheer wonder. 
Although we have emphasized the way Kanzi's cognitive abilities 
match those of young children, Kanzi's abilities in some areas far exceed 
those you would find in a young child. For example, one can't help but 
be by struck by Kanzi's spatial memory on these walks. The forest is 
quite large and densely treed. But Kanzi always knows the fastest way to 
every location, no matter where he might be in the forest and regardless 
of whether he is on one of the trails or in the middle of the woods. 
Not only is Kanzi's and Panbanisha's knowledge of the forest impres­
sive, but their ability to communicate that knowledge is remarkable. 
Once when I was out with Panbanisha and Mary, Panbanisha took me 
by the hand and led me to a plant on the side of a tree and began shak­
ing her head and making guttural sounds: She was telling me not to eat 
the fungus. When I responded that I would be careful never to eat the 
plant in question, Panbanisha led me to another plant and did the same 
thing. What was happening, Mary told me, was that, aware of my lack 
of familiarity with the forest, Panbanisha was teaching me which plants 
to avoid and which were safe to eat. Each time she imparted her infor­
mation she would scan my face to make sure that I had understood the 
import of the lesson. Once I pretended that I hadn't understood the 
point: I asked her, when she was obviously telling me to avoid some par-
Chimpanzees and Early Humans 
1 37 
ticularly noxious looking weed, "Are you telling me that this is really 
good for you? That I should try to eat this every single day?" Her vocal­
izations became agitated and she actually stamped on the plant. Clearly 
she was determined to get her message across! At this point, she re­
minded me so much of a small child leading her father by the hand to 
show him something in the garden, and then stamping in frustration as 
daddy persists in looking in the wrong place. 
These sorts of long problem-solving interactions are an everyday ex­
perience with Kanzi and Panbanisha, but what about apes in the wild? 
Once again, Jane Goodall's research is invaluable. One of the first great 
discoveries that Goodall made when she arrived at Gombe was that 
chimpanzees hunt for meat. Her report shook the primatological world, 
for there was a tendency at the time to regard chimpanzees as akin to 
the "noble savages" depicted in eighteenth-century writings about the 
state of nature; that is, chimpanzees were thought to be gentle creatures 
living in a state of idyllic bliss, quietly spending their days eating nuts 
and fruits and grooming one another. This picture was shattered when 
Goodall observed a group of chimps hunt down a red colobus monkey, 
kill it, and eat it. She watched them carefully block off all of the possible 
escape routes. Then one of the chimps stealthily crept up to a monkey 
and successfully captured and killed it. Had he failed, he would have 
driven it into the waiting arms of the other members of the hunting 
party. After the kill, there was a sort of Bacchanalian frenzy in which the 
successful hunter doled out portions of his kill to the other males. 
At first, Goodall's critics objected that this must have been some sort 
of aberrant behavior, confined to the chimpanzees at Gombe. But over 
the past thirty years, hunting parties have been observed in most of the 
sites where chimpanzees are studied in Central Africa. Typically, these 
hunting parties, primarily composed of males, range in size from one 
lone chimp to a group of thirty-five. Solitary hunters are successful only 
about a third of the time, however, whereas large hunting groups are al­
most always successful. 
Craig Stanford has spent the past ten years studying these hunting 
practices in the chimpanzees at Gombe.7 He has concluded that meat is 
important to chimpanzees, not simply for the fat and protein, but also 
because chimps use meat to forge or cement political bonds, and even 
to solicit sex from receptive females. Interestingly, Sabater Pi has shown8 
that hunger alone cannot be the driving force behind these hunts, for 
the chimps usually form a hunting parry only after they have just had a 

1 38 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
long feed. Rather, there seems to be an urge to engage in a group activ­
ity driven by strong social forces as opposed to biological forces. 
Stanford has speculated that Ardepithecus ramidus, which lived around 
4.4 million years ago, likely engaged in similar hunting practices. These 
early hominids lived in the same sort of forested environment as the 
chimpanzees at Gombe, in which there would have been colo bus mon­
keys, small antelopes, and other ground-dwelling vertebrates. To be sure, 
it might have been a little more difficult for A. ramidus, which was 
bipedal but still climbing trees, to have caught these monkeys; but even 
so, they could easily have organized into hunting parties similar to those 
of chimpanzees. Indeed, Stanford even speculates that these hunting 
practices may have played a critical role in the evolution of patriarchal 
human societies. 
For our purposes, what is particularly striking about these chim­
panzee hunting parties is the amount of complex emotional communi­
cation that is involved. In The New Chimpanzees, a National Geographic 
film produced by Cynthia Moses,9 there is some remarkable footage of a 
hunt. Through gestures, body movements, head nods, and facial expres- . 
sions, the hunters carefully position themselves around a troop of 
colo bus monkeys and signal to one another about who is to climb 
which tree, and in what order. Their movements are carefully moni­
tored and, at just the right moment, the other members of the party 
start whooping and crashing branches, which sends the monkeys into a 
full-flight panic, many of them blindly crashing into the waiting arms 
of the other hunters. The hunt lasts several minutes. At first, the wild 
celebration that occurs immediately afterwards seems to be utter bed­
lam. But it soon becomes clear that the assembled members of the troop 
are adopting various food-begging positions; they are then awarded 
pieces of the kill in what appears to be a deliberate fashion, apparently 
determined by social status. 
Christophe Boesch and Hedwige Boesch-Achermann have added con­
siderably to our understanding of the sorts of sophisticated planning and 
collaboration that go on in these hunting parties. As they explain in The 
Chimpanzees of the Tal Forest, hunting is a complex activity that takes 
place in conditions of low visibility. To succeed, the hunters have to de­
velop a fairly sophisticated understanding of how the other hunters will 
behave in any given situation, as well as how the different species of prey 
will behave. Not surprisingly, it takes approximately twenty years to learn 
how to hunt. Youngsters carefully observe the most skilled hunters and 
Chimpanzees and Early Humans 
1 39 
model their own hunting techniques on theirs. What distinguishes the 
most skilled hunters is their ability to anticipate the actions of their in­
tended prey; and, still more complex, to anticipate the effect that the ac­
tions of the other hunters will have on the behavior of the intended prey. 
This "double anticipation" is especially impressive because the likely be­
havior of the intended prey varies according to the species. Only the two 
oldest and most experienced of the hunters at Ta·i were capable of such 
double anticipations. Boesch and Boesch-Achermann describe watching 
one of them, Brutus, "suddenly run away from a hunt in a direction 
where we could see no monkey. It was only by following him that we re­
alized that he was simply thinking further ahead, predicting precisely the 
further movements of the prey, estimating the time he would need to 
climb and very cautiously so as not to move any branches that could be-
. tray him, position himself high enough, and dart up in a perfect surprise 
attack when the prey entered his tree." 10 
HOMO HABILIS AND HOMO ERECTUS 
Early humans started to appear approximately 2.5 million years ago. So 
striking are the anatomical and behavioral changes seen in early humans 
that paleoanthropologists draw a fundamental distinction between pre­
human hominids and the genus Homo. The most important of the 
anatomical changes involved is a sudden jump in EQ: the ratio of brain 
size to body size. For example, Australopithecus africanus was from 1 . 1  to 
1 .4 meters tall and its brain was from 400 to 500 milliliters, whereas H. 
habilis was around 1.5 meters tall and its brain was from 600 to 850 
milliliters. Along with this jump in brain size, H. habilis is thought to 
have acquired a new range of cognitive abilities, which, as we will see 
below, is reflected in tool-making skills. 
Homo erectus existed between 2 million and 400,000 years ago. The 
fossil record for H. erectus demonstrates striking anatomic changes. 
Apart from its skull, which still retained many of the ape-like features of 
early hominids (although it is fascinating to see how, over the course of 
its existence, the face of H. erectus became increasingly flattened and its 
cranium increasingly rounded), the body of H. erectus was very similar 
to that of modern humans. As the name implies, H. erectus was fully up­
right, had similar body proportions to ours, a waist like ours, and even a 
stature similar to ours (adults were between 1.5 and 2 meters tall). Their 

1 40 
T H E  F I R S T  I DEA 
brains were the largest yet seen in hominids, ranging in size from 900 to 
1,200 cubic centimeters: twice the size of a chimp's brain, though still 
somewhat smaller than ours. One of the most extraordinary of all finds 
was that of the Nariokotome boy, 1.5 million years old, found on the 
banks of Lake Turkana, who may have been around fifteen at the time 
of his death. His nearly complete skeleton indicates that H erectus had 
the same slender, graceful frame as that of modern humans who live in 
the region; he also had little body hair, which suggests his skin had de­
veloped dark pigmentation to protect him from the sun." 
Paleoanthropologists have speculated that these early humans lived in 
small social groups and engaged in cooperative activities. Some have even 
speculated that pair bonding might have begun to emerge in these early 
humans. Much of the reasoning for such a hypothesis is highly specula­
tive. There is, however, one extraordinary discovery that has stimulated a 
great deal of controversy around the early pair-bonding hypothesis. 
Andrew Hill, a professor of paleontology at Yale University, was work­
ing at Mary Leakey's Laetoli site in Tanzania in the 1970s. As Hill tells 
the story, one day he and one of his colleagues were horsing around, 
throwing dried-up pieces of elephant dung at each other. Diving out of 
the way to escape one particularly accurate projectile, Hill quite literally 
stumbled upon a set of fossilized footprints, 24.6 meters long, left by two 
hominids walking side-by-side, close enough to have been touching. It 
seems that a volcano had erupted and scattered a fine layer of ash over 
the landscape approximately 3.6 million years ago. This had been fol­
lowed by a rainfall that turned the ash into a sort of cement, followed by 
another volcanic eruption that spread another layer of ash; thus, many 
bird and mammal footprints were preserved, as well as the pair of ho­
minid footprints that Hill discovered. According to some, the reason 
these footprints may provide evidence of early pair bonding is that one 
hominid was clearly larger than the other, and the smaller of the two 
bears signs that whoever left the prints was burdened on one side; this 
evidence has ever led to speculation that perhaps it was a female carrying 
an infant on her hip. 12 
ORIGINS O F  TOOL USE 
Assuming-and it remains an assumption-that these early humans 
were starting to hunt large animals, they needed some sort of tool to 
Chimpanzees and Early Humans 
1 4 1  
butcher their kills-if there were indeed kills, for in one popular sce­
nario, our early human ancestors were not the bold hunters it was once 
supposed but rather somewhat cowardly scavengers who had to develop 
tools to break open the heavy bones of animals that had been killed by 
larger predators and then picked clean. But whatever the truth, the one 
thing we do know for certain is that the habilines were creating stone 
tools and passing on the methods for creating these tools for thousands 
and thousands of years. 
Indeed, H habilis ("man the handy man") is so-called precisely be­
cause of his tool-making abilities. These stone tools, which are known 
as Oldowan, date back to approximately 2.5 million years ago. They 
were usually produced by striking one rock against another to create a 
sharp-edged flake that was used to butcher animals and to strip tough 
plants, or as a digger to unearth tubers and insects. But as we already 
know from Nick Toth's studies of stone knapping, these apparently 
crude stone tools not only required a significant amount of manual dex­
terity but also reflect a significant advance both in memory and in plan­
ning abilities insofar as these early humans had to learn which stones 
were best suited for knapping and where they were located.13 
How did these creatures acquire the skills required to create a stone 
tool? We have one intriguing clue about the origins of these skills in the 
extensive research that has been done on the chimpanzee nut-cracking 
site at the Ta'i National Park, in the rain forest of the Ivory Coast. In a 
groundbreaking study recently published in Science,14 Christophe 
Boesch, Julio Mercader, and Melissa Pranger reported that the chimps 
collect rocks and panda nuts from up to 300 meters away and bring 
them to wooden "anvils," where they bash them with stone "hammers" 
to get at the nutritious flesh inside. The stones are fairly large (weighing 
up to 1 5  kg) and have a distinctive shape. The chimps have to hit the 
nut with just the right amount of force: enough to crack the shell with­
out smashing the kernel. It can take up to seven years to master the 
technique. Young chimps first begin to bang on the nuts when they are 
still by their mother's side, and some have been observed hitting nuts 
with smaller stones, perhaps practicing the motions they have observed 
in their parents. 
Boesch has described in earlier work how chimpanzee mothers 
demonstrate the technique by performing the necessary actions in slow 
motion and carefully monitoring their infants' attempts. They have 
even been observed to adjust the angle of the log for their infants. All 

1 42 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
this amounts to what Boesch describes as a form of teaching. 15 Perhaps 
even more important, for our concerns here, is that the skills involved 
have been culturally transmitted over many generations, indicating a 
strong and stable social organization. 
Boesch, Mercader, and Pranger are quite insistent about describing 
this as a cultural phenomenon. For one thing, the nuts the chimps crack 
are available throughout tropical Africa, yet nut-cracking behavior has 
been documented only in the chimpanzees from Western Ivory Coast, 
Liberia, and Southern Guinea-Conakry. Hence they conclude that this 
nut cracking is a cultural behavior that distinguishes one population of 
chimpanzees from another. Furthermore, judging from the piles of 
shells and stone Rakes found around some of the tree stumps, the same 
site has been used to crack nuts for over a century. Indeed, Boesch, Mer­
cader, and Pranger believe that some of these stones may have been used 
over and over for many generations. 
Even more fascinating is the authors' report that some of the Rakes 
they found resemble those found at hominid sites in East Africa. In fact, 
they speculate that early hominids probably engaged in nut-cracking · 
practices just like those of the chimps, and that over time, early humans 
began to manufacture more complex tools of different shapes and sizes. 
Such a hypothesis draws support from the recent discovery of a 2.34-
million-year-old hominid "tool-making factory," possibly belong to H. 
habilis, in the Rift Valley in Kenya.16 Helene Roche and her colleagues 
of the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) discov­
ered three thousand stone tool fragments scattered over an area of 17 
square meters. They were able to determine not only that the tools were 
made on the site but also that these early human toolmakers carefully 
tested new rocks to see whether they produced the right kind of sharp 
Rake and discarded them if they didn't. Meticulous research also re­
vealed the order in which the Rakes were struck from a core and the di­
rection in which they were rapidly struck, the implication being that the 
toolmakers possessed a knowledge of the material and considerable 
manual dexterity. Interestingly, the tools were found with the bones of 
fish and mammals and therefore may have been used to cut up meat. 
The technological advances seen in H. erectus are even more striking. 
Paleoanthropologists have documented how, with H. erectus, we see the 
first evidence of the use and control of fire; the first record of the novelty­
seeking behavior that is characteristic of modern humans; signs of a more 
modern human social organization; and the first appearance of stone 
Chimpanzees and Early Humans 
1 43 
tools that demonstrate a conscious complex design.l7 These so-called 
Acheulean tools were formed by chipping the stone from both sides to 
produce a symmetrical cutting edge. To make such a tool required 
strength and skill because large shards were struck from big rocks or 
boulders, fashioned into bifaces, and then refined at the edges into dis­
tinctive shapes. Acheulean hand-axes can be extremely large and may 
have been used not just to butcher animals but also to cut up branches 
into firewood. Some have speculated that they may even have had a cere­
monial and a monetary use.IS 
Clearly, we need to explain the cognitive factors that would have en­
abled early humans to progress beyond the sorts of crude tool-making 
skills seen in the chimps at Tal, which the Australopithecines were proba­
bly also practicing; but, even more important, we also need to explain the 
social processes whereby these skills were passed on from one generation 
to the next for 2 million years. That is, we are concerned here not simply 
with the sorts of changes that may have been occurring in, for example, 
their processing capacities; we are also interested in the changes occurring 
in their social organization that would have led to the sort of stable social 
structure necessary to maintain and transmit the design and manufactur­
ing criteria of the Acheulean tool industry for over a million years. 
CAREGIVING PRACTICES AND 
THE ORIGIN OF EARLY MAN 
One of the most striking aspects of the Oldowan and Acheulean tool in­
dustries is how long they each lasted. Genetic determinists have seized 
on this point, maintaining that because we see so little technological 
innovation in H. habilis and H. erectus, their genomes must have re­
mained unchanged. But there is a very different way to view the en­
durance of Oldowan and Acheulean tools. The consistency can be seen 
as evidence that the skills for manufacturing these tools were handed 
down from one generation to the next for extraordinarily long periods 
of time, and that there were no significant social or environmental pres­
sures compelling them to acquire a new suite of tool-making abilities. 
Seen in this way, the transmission of such knowledge could have been 
possible only in long-enduring and continuous human societies, and 
the major question raised by the Oldowan and Acheulean tool indus­
tries then becomes: What was the source of the social stability that 

1 44 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
made possible the transmission of the necessary skills in H. habilis and 
H. erectus? 
The answer, as we see it, lies in the introduction of caregiving practices 
that enabled these early humans to establish deeper feelings of engage­
ment: to engage in longer exchanges, to understand one another better, 
and to develop more complex relationships. Such deeper emotional 
bonds are essential for the sort of continuous social cohesiveness that is re­
quired for stable social organization. This then raises the question of what 
would have enabled them to develop these deeper feelings of engagement. 
One highly significant anatomical development that occurred at this 
time might have been the loss of bodily hair. Current evidence suggests 
that the early hominids lived in wooded areas and that it wasn't until H. 
habilis that they began living in arid environments, at which time they 
probably acquired hairless skin. Naturally enough, paleoanthropologists 
assume that the loss of hair was connected to the need to cool the body. 
But this hypothesis has been challenged in recent years by physiological 
studies that question the overall benefit of hairless skin as a cooling 
mechanism. 
In particular, the loss of facial hair would have done little as a cooling 
mechanism; but it would have had an enormous impact on the role of 
facial expressions in the development of closer emotional bonds. So per­
haps the growing importance of attachment between caregivers and 
their infants was the reason that we lost some of our facial hair. For the 
more visible the face, especially the area around the eyes, the more 
prominent facial expressions become in emotional signaling. As Darwin 
was the first to note, humans have a much more developed facial mus­
culature than the great apes, enabling a wide range of subtly nuanced fa­
cial expressions. 
To appreciate just how facial expression of emotion could have led to 
more sustained relationships in human evolution, one need only consider 
a baby's responses to animated facial gestures. She reacts with full open­
mouthed smiles that reach up to the corners of her eyes; she makes happy 
vocalizing sounds; she imitates facial expressions; she moves her limbs 
and body to the rhythms of her caregiver. On the other side of the equa­
tion, given the variability of babies' sensory systems, information process­
ing, and motor control, caregivers have to interpret a baby's expression of 
particular likes and dislikes, her particular needs and aversions. 
Human caregivers also used facial expressions to entice their babies 
into an awareness of the world around them. A baby's first exploratory 
Chimpanzees and Early Humans 
1 45 
behaviors are to reach and touch the things that most interest and de­
light her: invariably, the caregiver's face, nose, hair, and mouth. What 
the baby most craves in the beginning is the caregiver's smile and atten­
tion. So strong is this desire that the baby begins to develop her motor 
control system so that she can turn and see her caregiver. Her need to 
engage with her caregiver drives her to strain her muscles to their very 
limits. Perhaps even more important, her need to engage with her care­
giver drives her to strain her ability to attend to its very limit. 
A baby's ability to attend for longer periods of time is very much a 
function of her emotional state; that is, her interest in what the care­
giver is saying or doing. This attention span is critical for the child's de­
veloping ability to solve problems. To solve a problem as simple as 
Piaget's classic example of an eight-month-old who eventually stops 
pulling on a string that causes a bell to ring if the bell is detached, the 
baby must first discover the causal relationship between her smile and 
her caregiver's response.19 Indeed, it is extraordinary to see how quickly 
a baby will stop smiling, and even become agitated, if a caregiver does 
not return her smiles.20 
Another significant aspect of focused attention is the ability to ignore 
nonsalient or distracting information.21 Researchers have now estab­
lished that controlled attention and inhibition develop significantly in 
the first five years oflife.22 But the origins of this ability lie in the child's 
focus on the emotional content of the caregiver's message and ignore the 
misleading elements. For example, a caregiver may make all the right 
noises when she holds the baby, but if she is anxious and her expression 
is tense, the baby will in turn become tense and agitated. These observa­
tions suggest that, through the more finely tuned emotional expressions 
and gesturing that hominids were developing, their infants were acquir­
ing much greater attentional and inhibitory control: basic skills that 
would have played a significant role in the ever-widening cognitive gap 
between the great apes and early humans. 
Moreover, herein lies one of the most critical of all aspects of the 
break between early humans and prehuman hominids. The importance 
of this shift becomes vivid when we compare the attention spans of hu­
man babies with those of nonhuman primates. To be sure, we see some 
fairly striking attentional abilities amongst the great apes. For example, 
the chimpanzee infants at Ta'i have been observed to attend closely to 
their caregivers when they are cracking open nuts with stone or wood 
tools. Even more striking is the attention span of language-enculturated 

1 46 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
apes. But great apes in the wild seldom appear to engage in interactions 
for more than a few seconds at a time. Given the kinds of attention nec­
essary to master the intricate skills involved in Oldowan and Acheulean 
toolmaking, it seems clear that early human infants were developing 
considerably more pronounced attentional abilities. 
This crucial psychological development was not, we would argue, the 
result of some random genetic change. Rather, on the hypothesis we are 
canvassing here, it would have been the result of ever more sustained 
bouts of emotional exchanges in which infants were engaging with their 
caregivers. Furthermore, we now know that the development of a child's 
attentional capacity is intimately connected with the growth of the pre­
frontal cortex. And, as we mentioned in Chapter 1 and will clarify in 
more detail in Chapter 10, the prefrontal cortex does not maturate ac­
cording to a fixed genetic timetable; rather, the development of the pre­
frontal cortical structures that enable a child to develop her basic 
cognitive abilities is fundamentally bound up with the nature and qual­
ity of her interactions with her primary caregivers. Thus, we would 
speculate that the origins of the genus Homo-mental, physical, emo­
tional, social, and communicative-lay in the development and trans­
mission of these critical caregiving practices. These early humans were 
learning how to entice their infants with different facial expressions and 
gestures and were engaging them in playful interactions. Perhaps they 
were beginning to vocalize in warm, enticing motherese.23 These more 
elaborate interactions laid the foundations for the acquisition of the 
cognitive skills manifested in Oldowan and Acheulean tools, as well as 
for the next stage of fIe development.

Symbols, Words, and Ideas: 
Archaic Homo sapiens and Early Moderns 
A GRADUAL TRANSITION 
We saw in the opening chapter how at the fifth stage of functional/emo­
tional development a child starts to use words in a meaningful manner. 
This exciting event depends upon a wealth of prior emotionally relevant 
experiences on which he draws. Without a lot of warm exchanges with 
caregivers, the child won't be capable of developing meaningful lan­
guage, even though he might be neurologically capable of speaking. 
When he is so emotionally deprived, the child is still able to memorize 
words or to label objects, but he can't explain what a story means or why 
the characters behave the way they do. It is only through emotional ex­
changes that words and images acquire meaning for a child. Only then 
can he use words to express his feelings, rather than acting them out. 
Only then can he think symbolically and solve problems creatively. 
The processes involved here develop gradually, through the following 
steps: 
• Ideas are acted out in action (the child raises his arms to be picked up), 
but words may also be used to signify the action (while raising his arms, 
the child says, "Up"); words are not yet used instead of actions. 
• Words referring to the body are used to convey feeling states ("Head 
huns"). 
• Action words are used instead of actions to convey intent ("Hit Mommy"). 
1 47 

1 48 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
• 
Feelings are conveyed through words but are treated as real rather than as 
signals ("Need a hug"). 
• Words are used to convey feelings, but they are mostly global feeling 
states ("I feel awful"). 
• Words convey polarized feeling states ("I feel sad"). 
• Words begin to be used to convey more differentiated, abstract feeling 
states ("I'm lonely"). 
These steps are particularly important for the argument that we will 
present in this chapter in regard to human evolution. A standard evolu­
tionary premise holds that there is a sharp distinction between Out earliest 
modern ancestors, Archaic Homo sapiens, and our own species, Homo sapi­
ens sapiens. Initially, paleoanthropologists believed that our more distant 
ancestors emerged some time around 0.5 million. years ago and survived 
for several hundreds of thousands of years; and then, for reasons that are 
unknown and will likely never be well understood, our own species 
emerged, relatively suddenly, some time around 200,000 years ago. Such 
an evolutionary scenario lent plausibility to the idea that the birth of our 
species was marked by some radical genetic mutation, frequently said to 
have been the selection of a language gene, or perhaps a mindreading gene. 
Instead, we suggest that the transition from Archaic H sapiens to H 
sapiens sapiens was a gradual process and not a sudden cataclysmic event. 
Admittedly, evidence in the archaeological record leads one to postulate a 
sharp break. But consider how children begin to look like totally different 
beings when they start talking, typically between the ages of eighteen and 
twenty-four months. Once a child gets beyond the stage of using just a 
few words and phrases and starts to speak in sentences, he really seems to 
take off. Within a few months he is talking, thinking, and imagining 
to an enormous extent. However, as we saw in Chapter 2, when we look 
at the process more closely, we can actually break the child's development 
down into gradual steps. His understanding of actions and agency and 
objects is gradually acquired through preverbal experience, especially the 
exchanges involved in solving problems and forming a sense of self. 
When the ability to speak and use symbols reaches the point where 
children can describe their experience, this looks like a new event; but, 
although in part this is true, it is also simply one more in a continuous 
series of developmental steps. Like a leaky faucet that we do not notice is 
dripping until the water finally overflows and we see it coming through 
the ceiling, so too the child's symbolic development is the result of many 
Archaic Homo sapiens and Early Moderns 
1 49 
gradual steps leading up to the "language explosion" that typically occurs 
between eighteen and twenty-four months. Similarly, we are suggesting 
that anatomically modern H sapiens evolved very gradually from early 
humans and needed to master various elements of presymbolic commu­
nication before using symbols to a large extent. Although the evidence 
for a "symbolic explosion" between 60,000 and 40,000 years ago is clear 
and seems momentous-and indeed it was-we should not forget that it 
was part of a very gradual process of fie development. 
Another reason why the appearance of symbolic abilities appears 
to be so sudden is that symbolic communication leaves a more visible 
record than presymbolic communication patterns. Now we have cave 
drawings, ceremonial beads, and more refined tools. But then, just as it 
has taken thousands of years of modern history to figure out that babies 
don't simply become people at age three or four when they more closely 
resemble adult humans in their ability to speak or understand human 
behavior, so too H sapiens sapiens did not suddenly become thinking, 
problem-solving creatures when they began drawing on cave walls. With 
human babies, we are discovering the road map of monumental devel­
opmental achievements in the first two years; so too we are starting to 
discover the road map of achievements in the life of Archaic H sapiens 
leading up to the appearance of modern humans. As science so often re­
veals, the processes of development are far more complex than they ini­
tially appeared, and once we look at them under a microscope, the 
pathways involved often have far more steps and are more gradual than 
was originally assumed. 
BONOBO COMMUNICATION 
My first week at the Language Research Center (LRC) was inspiring. I re­
member thinking about what it must have been like for some ancient 
mariner who, convinced that the earth was flat, had set out to see for him­
self the edge of the world. His doubts and uncertainties must have grown 
stronger with each passing day as the horizon remained just as far away as 
when he had set out. For someone trained in the dogmas of twentieth­
century linguistic theory, the idea that an ape could understand spoken 
English was every bit as preposterous as supposing that the earth is round. 
Only humans, we had been taught, had the neurological capacity to un­
derstand spoken language. 

1 50 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Each day at the LRC brought a new challenge to this belief system. It 
might have been Kanzi performing at the same level as a three-year-old 
child on a battery of language tests. Or Kanzi fetching Sue's keys from 
another room when he heard her shouting to me to ask whether I had 
seen them. Or when he responded to Sue's suggestion that they "go to 
the trailer and make a water balloon" by going to the trailer, getting a 
balloon out of the backpack, and then holding it under the water faucet. 
But it wasn't just a matter of coming to terms with Kanzi's extraordinary 
comprehension skills. Every day seemed to bring a new surprise in re­
gards to Kanzi's and Panbanisha's cognitive development. For example, 
one day I found Panbanisha drawing a picture of a clump of grapes on 
the wall of her bedroom; another day I watched her don a gorilla mask 
and chase the other apes around the cages in a fit of gleeful pretend play. 
Each of these sorts of events is so common a,t the LRC that after a 
while one scarcely sees them as at all unusual. But when you start to 
think about them carefully, it is remarkable to see how much complex 
communication is taking place. Take, for example, the day we spent test­
ing Panbanisha and Heather, Sue's three-year-old niece. My friend, Tal­
bot Taylor, who is the G. T. Cooley Professor of English and Linguistics 
at the College of William & Mary, had put together a very clever list of 
sentences that would enable us to ascertain Panbanisha's linguistic profi­
ciency. Tolly's idea was that we would ask one to perform an action and 
then the other to perform a similar action, but using slightly different 
words. So, for example, we might say, "Panbanisha, can you put the doll 
on the table?" and then, "Heather, can you put the bowl on the box?" 
This strategy would enable us to compare their comprehension skills in 
regards to various simple syntactical constructions as well as to vocabu­
lary. After an hour of this testing, it was clear that there was very little 
difference between the two of them as far as their understanding of the 
batch of sentences Tolly had put together. But that was really the least 
significant part of the experiment. What we found truly mesmerizing 
was how the two of them behaved with each other. 
Sue had arranged for the two of them to sit side-by-side on two plastic 
chairs. Watching them was like watching any two small children playing a 
game together. They were constantly exchanging glances, laughing with 
each other, and teasing one another. To keep them interested in the test, 
Sue rewarded them with a prize after each answer, a sweet or a small toy. 
At one point, Heather had just answered her question and Sue was about 
to give her a balloon when Panbanisha, with a mischievous grin on her 
Archaic Homo sapiens and Early Moderns 
1 5 1  
face, leaped forward and grabbed it out of Sue's hand. Heather was not 
about to stand for this. We watched in amazement as she leaped out of 
her chair and started pounding on Panbanisha's back, insisting she give it 
back. Like an older brother who wanted nothing more than to torment 
her younger sister, Panbanisha responded by chortling over the balloon as 
if it were the most wonderful of all the rewards they had been given that 
morning. At this point, Sue, who was concerned that the session not end 
in chaos, intervened and insisted in a firm voice that Panbanisha return 
Heather's balloon that instant. With a chastened look on her face, Pan­
banisha turned towards Heather and ever so slowly extended the balloon. 
Grabbing it with a look of triumph, Heather promptly returned to her 
seat. To maintain the peace, Sue then gently gave Panbanisha her own bal­
loon. The two of them then began to play with their balloons in such a 
way as to indicate, through loud vocalizations, that theirs was by far the 
better of the two. And every so often each would glance surreptitiously at 
the other to make sure that the other's was not in fact the better balloon. 
The day that Panbanisha put on the gorilla mask is just as illustrative 
of the rich variety of child-like emotions that the bonobos display. The 
morning session had started off peacefully enough as Kanzi quietly 
groomed Tamuli while Panbanisha lolled around on some blankets with 
what can only be described as a look of boredom on her face. Suddenly 
Panbanisha spied the gorilla mask that Sue sometimes wears with a go­
rilla suit when she wants to keep the bonobos away from certain areas of 
the LRC. In a trice, Panbanisha had donned the mask. Even more in­
credible, her behavior was transformed the instant she had the mask on: 
She started lumbering around the room in a remarkably convincing im­
itation of a gorilla, swinging her arms in a ponderous manner to suggest 
that they had suddenly become incredibly heavy, and moving in a stiff­
legged manner from the hips. Kanzi had a look of intense annoyance on 
his face and kept shooing Panbanisha away with his arm. But Tamuli 
was another matter. 
Tamuli was one of the controls at the LRC. She had never been ex­
posed to the lexigram board and was kept in another part of the com­
pound whenever Sue was doing language testing. Poor Tamuli's response 
to Panbanisha was of a completely different order: She was absolutely 
terrified! Unlike Kanzi, she couldn't grasp that all this was pretend play. 
Rather, she started scrambling around the room, desperately trying to 
elude this frightening creature who had somehow managed to invade 
their sanctuary. Her terror had the unfortunate consequence of making 

1 52 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Panbanisha double her efforts to be the most convincing gorilla ever. The 
two of them dashed around the room, Panbanisha making grunting 
noises and Tamuli squealing; all the while, Kanzi sat frowning in the cor­
ner, expressing his distaste for such juvenile shenanigans. 
I am often asked: Was there some critical point during that first visit 
to the LRC when I realized that I must either return to Toronto and 
somehow explain away everything I had seen or else press forward with 
my work with Sue and come to terms with the behavior I had witnessed? 
In retrospect, I suspect that my turning point occurred the first time we 
all went for a walk together in the woods. We had stopped in a clearing 
to pick wild raspberries when Kanzi decided it was time for a game of 
chase. Not that he was about to exert himself. No, Kanzi's idea of a fun 
game was to delegate Sue to do the chasing and one of us to be the 
chasee. For the latter, he slowly looked at me and then, to ensure that he 
had been understood, he hit the lexigram symbols for "visitor" and 
"man." As I was considerably taller than anyone else on the walk there 
was no mistaking his intentions. Unlike the other researchers, I had no 
"name" key on the board. So Kanzi had improvised a solution by COffi- . 
bining two different kinds of terms to pick me out. But there was some­
thing even more arresting than this creative use of symbols. In much the 
same way that a small child warily eyes a stranger, Kanzi had been glanc­
ing at me surreptitiously all morning. By choosing me to be the chasee, 
Kanzi was actually testing me out to see how I would respond. He was 
also deliberately drawing me into the group, both physically and psycho­
logically. And, of course, he was ordering me around, which effectively 
brought me down to size. 
What followed was exhausting and exhilarating. Through facial ex­
pressions and gestures, Kanzi expressed his delight and kept changing 
the players in the game to keep things interesting. Next I was the chaser 
and Tolly the chasee. Then Tolly became the chaser and Mary the 
chasee. This went on for some time, Kanzi all the while imperiously di­
recting the proceedings as if he were some Herbert von Karajan, slightly 
dizzy with his power, when all of a sudden he abruptly stopped and 
stared intently into the upper branches of a nearby tree. A look of con­
cern came over his face and the hairs on his back started to bristle. 
When Sue asked what was wrong, he pointed at the branches and vocal­
ized softly. We all stared intently and, after several minutes of this, with 
no one moving or speaking, there was ever so slight a rustling in the 
leaves. Almost immediately Kanzi relaxed and nodded at us, signaling 
Archaic Homo sapiens and Early Moderns 
1 53 
that we could now resume our walk. There was so much to absorb here. 
Obviously, there was the question of what he had seen that had caused 
him such alarm. Perhaps he had seen one of the mountain cats that are 
indigenous to the region; perhaps it was something completely differ­
ent. But whatever the animal, Kanzi clearly regarded it as a threat to our 
safety. What I found even more interesting was how quickly he had 
communicated his warning with his facial expressions and gestures and 
how quickly the mood of the group had changed from one extreme to 
another. One could not help but be struck by the role that Kanzi had as­
sumed on this walk. Inside the lab, there was never any question but 
that Sue was in charge. But the forest was Kanzi's domain, and he had 
stepped effortlessly into the role of the leader by watching over our 
safety and organizing our activities. 
At first, Kanzi was dismissed by the scientific community as some 
sort of aberration: the bonobo version of a genius who had fortuitously 
landed in Sue's lab. But when Panbanisha demonstrated the same cogni­
tive and communicative skills, it became clear that the explanation for 
their development lay in the language-enriched environment in which 
they were raised. At this stage of the research, it seems reasonable to 
conclude that the advances we see in the bonobos' modes of communi­
cation led to a confluence of events. Indeed, as is the case with infants, 
so too with Kanzi and Panbanisha: Not only have their interactive vo­
calizations, facial expressions, and other means of signaling all improved 
but so has their ability to plan and execute motor actions. It seems 
likely, then, that new central nervous system pathways were stimulated 
to deal with the challenges of their unique environment at the Language 
Research Center. 
Having said that, it is important to note that the more we have 
learned about nonhuman primate behavior the more we can recognize 
islands of comparable behaviors in great apes in the wild. As we saw in 
the foregoing chapters, the more a species can engage in long chains of 
emotional exchanges, as bonobos in the wild can, the more complex be­
comes their group behavior. Some have suggested that bonobos are able 
to maintain a state of fairly pronounced social harmony by establishing a 
much more matriarchal type of social structure and also by engaging in 
various kinds of sexual behavior that serve to defuse tensions.' Although 
there may, of course, be some truth in both of these hypotheses, we 
would speculate that there is a much more basic social process at work 
here. For the more advanced becomes the emotional signaling of a 

1 54 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
species, the more it can separate perception from action. This enables in­
dividuals to think before they act. It is this latter capacity that is critical 
for establishing and maintaining harmony in a more complex group, and 
to begin to communicate symbolically. We looked at some of the evi­
dence that apes in the wild can communicate symbolically in Chapter 3. 
This possibility is further corroborated by Christophe Boesch and 
Hedwige Boesch-Achermann's account, in The Chimpanzees of the Tar 
Forest, of the role that drumming plays when the chimps are moving 
through the forest in much the same conditions as the bonobos de­
scribed in Chapter 3.2 The males appear to drum on buttressed trees to 
indicate their position and the direction in which they are moving. But 
the scientists noticed that when Brutus, the alpha male, drummed, the 
group as a whole abruptly changed its travel direction. In fact, Boesch 
and Boesch-Achermann report that "on some occasions, Brutus' drum­
ming sequence appeared to transmit a specific message" either instruct­
ing the group about the direction in which it was to proceed or telling 
them they were to rest for a specific duration.3 
The Chimpanzees of the Tar Forest provides us with a rich catalogue of 
the social and cognitive capacities of chimpanzees in the wild. We will 
restrict ourselves here to just two of the remarkable anecdotes reported, 
which provide further evidence that chimpanzees in the wild may be ca­
pable of symbolic communication. The book is framed with two differ­
ent accounts of how the chimpanzees react when one of the members of 
their group is seriously wounded. In the first episode, Mognie, a six­
year-old female, has been the victim of an attack, probably from a leop­
ard, and has suffered severe wounds in her chest and belly; a piece of 
intestine is sticking out from one of the wounds and her respiration is 
audible through the hole in her chest. Her mother, Mystere, rushes over 
and licks some of the blood off the chest wound. Mystere remains with 
Mognie for two days, spending large amounts of time in a nest, al­
though the researchers could not see what she was doing. Mognie then 
remained on her own for seventeen days. When she rejoined her family: 
"Mystere ran towards her and they embraced screaming briefly. Mystere 
lifted Mognie's chin and looked at her wounds that looked fully healed 
except for a small pink spot in the largest wound."4 
Now contrast this with the episode reported at the end of the book. 
Tina, a ten-year-old female, had just been attacked by a leopard, and when 
the scientists arrived they found six males and six females sitting silently 
around the body, as if keeping vigil over it. A group of high-ranking 
Archaic Homo sapiens and Early Moderns 
1 55 
females arrived and each sniffed but did not lick Tina's wounds. A low­
ranking female and some infants tried to approach the body, but they 
were chased away. Three of the males then groomed the body, which is 
unusual insofar as none of them had ever been seen to groom Tina while 
she was alive. Later in the day, these males softly tapped Tina's chin and 
shook her hands and legs while looking at her face, as if testing to see 
whether there was any kind of reaction. Two and a half hours after Tina's 
death, her five-year-old brother, Tarzan, was allowed to "smell gently over 
different parts of the body and he inspected her genitals. He was the only 
infant allowed to do this. Then, Tarzan groomed her for a few seconds and 
pulled her hand gently many times, looking at her."s After this, the chim­
panzees slowly started to drift away from the body. 
Goodall has reported several sightings of chimpanzees mourning over 
a dead family member,6 but here we have a vivid portrayal of a group's 
collective response to the death of one its members. Unlike the first epi­
sode, where there is a deliberate attempt to heal the injured animal's 
wounds, no such attempt is made this time; on the contrary, the animals 
are clearly aware of the gravity of her condition, and, perhaps, of her im­
minent death. They may, of course, merely be waiting to ascertain 
whether or not she revives. But there appears to be something far more 
profound going on here: almost a sort of funereal rite complete with so­
cial conventions governing who is allowed to mourn over the body and 
who is prohibited from approaching the body; and then a special role as­
signed to Tina's closest relative, Tarzan, who would otherwise have been 
prohibited from touching the body (because of his age); he performs a 
ritual that seems to mark the closure of what almost strikes one as some 
sort of ceremony. 
THE ARRIVAL OF HOMO SAPIENS 
The appearance of anatomically modern human beings has long pre­
sented evolutionary theory with one of its greatest puzzles. Part of the 
problem concerns the question of where these creatures came from, and 
when. Even more perplexing is the extraordinary technological ascent 
of this new species. Prior to the emergence of modern human beings, 
the pace of hominid evolution-both morphological and behavioral­
was exceptionally slow. The changing anatomy of modern humans has 
conformed to this pattern, which suggests very stable conditions in the 

1 56 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
developmental matrix that is so critical for the expression of genes. But 
over the past 10,000 years, the pace of cultural change has been dizzy­
ing. What is it about this new creature that has enabled it, and it alone, 
to transform its environment-indeed, to transform the world-in 
what, in evolutionary terms, is the mere blink of an eye? 
For the latter half of the twentieth century, the prevailing explanation 
of this phenomenon was that some sort of "monster genetic mutation" 
must have transformed the manner in which the evolving human brain 
processes information. There are many reasons for why this Big Bang 
theory exercised the appeal that it did, but one of the chief was simply 
that there was no competing developmental explanation. The theory 
presented in this book, namely, that caregiving practices that were cultur­
ally transmitted and thus learned anew from one generation to the next 
and, indeed, across species promoted the fie development of prehuman 
hominids and then early and ultimately modern humans, provides a 
compelling answer to this question that is in close harmony with recent 
critical developments in genetic theory itself and the growing number of 
anthropologists who are incorporating aspects of sociality (in addition to 
natural selection) into their theories.? 
Originally, it was thought that H sapiens sapiens evolved from H 
erectus independently in several different parts of the world, that there 
was genetic exchange between these different populations, and that 
modern racial differences are the product of local environmental condi­
tions. Then paleoanthropologists speculated, from computer analysis of 
mitochondrial DNA, that H sapiens sapiens may have evolved in Africa 
about 200,000 years ago and then migrated around the globe. But re­
cent evidence suggests a more intermediary position between the Multi­
regional and the Out of Africa models. 
Scientists were able to extract some of the mitochondrial DNA from 
a H sapiens sapiens skeleton found on the shores of Lake Mungo in 
southeastern Australia. By comparing this DNA with that of nine other 
ancient Australian skeletons, two Neanderthals, and over three thou­
sand people from around the world today, it was discovered that so­
called Mungo Man had a unique genetic marker and indicates that a 
lost genetic line of H sapiens sapiens was living in Australia prior to the 
arrival of Australian Aborigines. Lending further support to this inter­
mediary model is Alan Templeton's recent genetic analysis indicating 
that there has been interbreeding between hominids living in Asia, Eu­
rope, and Africa for as much as 600,000 years, which suggests that suc-
Archaic Homo sapiens and Early Moderns 
1 57 
cessive waves of early humans expanded out of Africa over and over 
again and interbred with indigenous populations.8 
Such paleoanthropological evidence lends important support to our 
hypothesis that the transition from Archaic to modern H sapiens has 
been a slow process. If, as we argue, the underlying cause of the evolu­
tionary changes manifest in the fossil record-morphological, behav­
ioral, cognitive, and social-has been in part due to a series of advances 
in caregiving practices built on the practices of preceding generations, 
the emergence of H sapiens can only have been gradual. This culturally 
mediated process goes back to the Common Ancestor and beyond. To 
be sure, some sort of "representational explosion" occurred in modern 
H sapiens, but even here, the process whereby humans reached this crit­
ical threshold was gradual and not the result of some cataclysmic genetic 
event. 
Paleoanthropologists speculate that Archaic H sapiens began to ap­
pear sometime between 600,000 and 100,000 years ago. The skulls of 
these creatures were more rounded than those of H erectus, and they 
also had a less pronounced brow ridge; the forehead was relatively high 
and the chin increasingly pointed. They had a cranial capacity at the 
low end of the modern range (from 1,1 50 to 1,250 cubic centimeters), 
an expanded parietal region, and changes in the basicranium that some 
have tentatively linked to an elaboration of the larynx. They were start­
ing not just to look and possibly to sound more like us but even to act 
in ways that we would recognize as distinctly human. 
To some extent, the category of Archaic H sapiens is a grab-all for fos­
sils whose cranial vaulting and bone thickness suggests that there was an 
intermediary species between H erectus and H sapiens sapiens. Our fie 
model suggests that there must, in fact, have been intermediary steps 
between H erectus, who were entrenched at the fourth stage of fie de­
velopment, and H sapiens sapiens, who were firmly established at the 
fifth stage and starting to enter the sixth. Hence, we will adopt this con­
vention and assume that there was an archaic species of H sapiens who 
started to move through the steps outlined above up to the striking 
symbolic skills displayed by H sapiens sapiens. 
One might even speculate whether the emotional and cognitive ad­
vances that Archaic H sapiens were undergoing played a role in the ana­
tomical changes exhibited in the fossil record for Archaic H sapiens.9 A 
baby born 100,000 years ago would have had vastly more enriched emo­
tional signaling and symbol-formation opportunities than his counterpart

600,000 years ago. Could this phenomenon also explain a change in the 
physical structure of the face and skull? After all, there is evidence that en­
vironment affects skin pigmentation, height, stature, fat content, motor 
capacities, and, of course, the manner in which the brain is wired. Is it not 
possible that there is also a connection between interactive learning experi­
ences and facial muscles, and thus some of the differences observed in the 
shape of the skull? 
There are indications in the fossil record to support the view that Ar­
chaic H sapiens was slowly advancing through the early steps of the fifth 
stage. In the beginning they were still producing Acheulian tools, but we 
begin to see subtle refinements leading up to the next major revolution 
in stone tool technology: the Mousterian tool industry, which appeared 
around 200,000 years ago and lasted until 40,000 years ago. Mousterian 
toolmaking marks a significant technological advance. The whole pro­
cess of manufacturing tools was standardized into well-defined stages and 
became much more labor intensive, and far more time was devoted to re­
shaping and sharpening tools. Various shapes are found in the Mous­
terian tool kit: pointed (used for hunting); burins (used for cutting 
grooves); borers (used for making holes in soft material); drills (used with 
much the same twisting motion as modern drills); scrapers (used for tan­
ning hides); and hand axes and backed knives. These different shapes 
provide us with important indications of the cultural changes that were 
taking place, not just in hunting practices but also in the construction of 
shelters, the use of fire, the production of clothing, and, possibly, as we 
will see in the following chapter, the fashioning of ornamentation. 
As one would expect, there are also signs of important social develop­
ments in the fossil record. For example, there is evidence that not only 
was Archaic H sapiens using caves as shelters, but it is likely that these 
caves had inlaid stone floors. Furthermore, there is evidence that they 
were beginning to construct open-air structures. The remains of a 
400,000-year-old hut were found in Terra Amata, near Nice in France. 
The hut appears to have had a hearth in it, no doubt used for heat, but 
possibly also to cook food. Near the entrance of the Lazeret Cave, also 
near Nice, are the 20,000-year-old remains of a 36-by-1 1-foot structure 
that had two hearths in it, providing us with a possible glimpse of a co­
habiting extended family. 
Even more intriguing is the evidence that, around 300,000 years ago, 
Archaic H sapiens was starting to engage in burial rites, which suggests 
the beginnings of a more abstract belief system associated with the phe-
Archaic Homo sapiens and Early Modems 
1 59 
nomenon of death. At the site of Atapuerca in Spain-the so-called Sima 
de los Huesos-the bones of thirty-two dead humans were found. Lend­
ing credence to the possibility that this was some sort of burial ground 
are the numerous Neanderthal burial sites that have been discovered (al­
though some have warned that what appear to be tombs may simply be 
the consequence of accidental roof falls). We see a consistent pattern in 
these Neanderthal burial sites: Males and females were placed in small 
shallow graves with their knees bent, food and tools were placed beside 
them, and wildflowers were strewn about. Some have even suggested that 
we can see a pattern in the kind of objects that were buried with males 
versus females, which would suggest an early form of social organization 
based on sex, possibly akin to the models of early hunting-gathering soci­
eties thought to have emerged in the Pleistocene. 
Early moderns in Mrica (between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago) al­
ready had the same morphological features as modern humans, but they 
likely resembled Neanderthals in their behavior. We say this in part be­
cause paleoanthropologists now believe that Neanderthals had more so­
phisticated planning abilities than was previously thought, 10 and because 
of the recent evidence that Neanderthals were manufacturing beads dur­
ing the Chatelperronian Period (from 32,000 to 30,000 years ago) at 
Arcy-sur-Cure, and that they transported fire to the cave at Bruniquel, 
France, where they built a stone structure that contained a burnt bear 
bone. I I Early moderns were collecting iron and manganese compounds 
to use as pigments, most likely for body decoration; they built fires at 
will, buried their dead, and hunted large animals. 12 Also, like Nean­
derthals, they produced a relatively small range of stone artifacts that 
were stable over a long period. Most of the raw materials they used came 
from local sources, suggesting a small home range, a simple social net­
work, and a sparse population. They rarely if ever used bone, ivory, or 
shell, and there is no evidence of symbolic representation. 
Recent archaeological discoveries also show that the representational 
capacities of modern humans were developing over hundreds of thou­
sands of years and began before the appearance of anatomically modern 
humans. In May 2000, Lawrence Barham reported the discovery, in a 
cave at Twin Rivers, in Zambia, of more than three hundred fragments 
of pigment, believed to be between 350,000 and 400,000 years old. 
These pigments had been ground up into a powder and ranged in color 
from brown to red, yellow, purple, blue, and pink. Barham believes 
they were used for ritual body painting and, perhaps, for cave painting. 

1 60 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Indeed, Barham points out: "If we link pigments with group activities 
such as ritual, then language is part of the equation. Rituals are 
grounded in a shared understanding of the significance of the events 
and the rules that govern the performance . . . .  Perhaps the develop­
ment of ritual and language are linked, one expressed through the other 
with pigment left as the only material trace."13 As controversial as this 
last hypothesis will no doubt remain for some time, it is clearly time 
that we rethink the Big Bang hypothesis. 
THE DESCENT O F  THE LARYNX 
One of the great appeals of the Out of Africa model was that it seemed 
to provide a simple solution to the puzzle of modern cultural develop­
ment; for if a single species swept away all other living hominids, it 
must have been because they enjoyed some special advantage, either 
physical or mental. And since there is nothing particularly striking 
about the morphology of H. sapiens sapiens, then, according to this line 
of reasoning, they must have possessed some special mental capacity; 
that is, there must be something unique about the manner in which the 
brain of H. sapiens sapiens processes information, and if so, this accounts 
for the dizzying pace of modern human technology.14 
One significant problem for this Big Bang hypothesis is that, insofar as 
the difference between nonhuman primate and human cognitive capaci­
ties seems to be more a matter of degree than of kind, one would expect 
the same to hold true for the difference between the cognitive abilities of 
anatomically modern and earlier humans. To be sure, all our so-called ex­
ecutive functions-e.g., our attention span, our ability to inhibit non­
salient information, and our short- and long-term memory-are more 
advanced than those of nonhuman primates, but the more we learn 
about the nonhuman primate mind the more we can discern fundamen­
tal continuities between nonhuman primate cognitive capacities and our 
own. 15 All, that is, except for one: the capacity to speak. For only 
humans, according to many influential linguists and psycholinguists, 
possess the capacity to acquire language. Hence, what distinguishes ana­
tomically modern humans, according to the Big Bang hypothesis, is that 
they were the first hominid to speak. 
Herein lies one of the reasons why there has been so much heated de­
bate over the question of whether great apes are capable of developing 
Archaic Homo sapiens and Early Moderns 
1 6 1  
primitive linguistic skills. For according to the Big Bang theory of hu­
man evolution, modern human beings-and modern human beings 
alone-suddenly acquired the capacity to speak sometime in the Pleis­
tocene, for reasons that will remain forever unknown. 16 On this popular 
line of argument, the explanation for our remarkable development does 
not lie in enhanced cognitive abilities or an increased EQ; it lies in the 
unique properties that language provides for the communication of 
thoughts and the transmission of knowledgeY 
Such a hypothesis has a long philosophical pedigree to back it up, as 
Chomsky recognized early on. I S It was first articulated by the father of 
modern philosophy, Rene Descartes, and has been repeated by disconti­
nuity theorists ever since.19 The argument was given further support by 
modern linguistic analyses of the unique structural features of language, 
which, according to Chomsky's influential theory of Generative Gram­
mar, accounts for what Chomsky described as the uniquely creative as­
pects of human language; that is, the capacity of humans to understand 
and produce infinitely many novel sentences.20 In Chomsky's view, a 
child's brain automatically begins to process the complex linguistic data 
to which it is exposed at birth and spontaneously generates a grammar. 
Not surprisingly, Chomsky's hypothesis received considerable support 
from the computer revolution, for given the exciting advances being real­
ized in the development of natural language programs, it seemed plausi­
ble to view the human brain as a form of computer, biologically equipped 
with certain basic rules-what AI scientists refer to as "heuristics"-that 
enable it to acquire the grammar of the natural language to which a child 
is exposed at birth.21 
The Big Bang hypothesis received further support from archaeolo­
gists, who argued that the colonization of Australia 60,000 years ago 
would have required the construction of a boat, which takes considerable 
planning that is different in kind from the planning abilities seen in ear­
lier hominids or apes.22 How else, according to the Big Bang theorists, 
can we account for the sudden appearance of this cognitive capacity un­
less by postulating a genetic mutation? And how else, according to the 
archaeological argument for the Big Bang, can we explain the sudden ap­
pearance of representational art and the appearance of ornamentation 
and representational artifacts, such as jewelry and decorative clothing, 
unless the creatures in question had acquired representational capacities? 
Influential support for the Big Bang hypothesis came from Lieberman 
and Laitman's argument that the descent of the larynx in human beings, 

1 62 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
which occurred at roughly the same time as the appearance of represen­
tational art, serves as a sign of the recent evolution of language.23 A de­
scended larynx enables humans to produce a far greater range of distinct 
sounds, but it exposes us to the serious risk of choking if we attempt to 
eat and talk at the same time. Lieberman argued that such a potential 
risk would only have been selected if it was associated with some signifi­
cant adaptational advantage; that is, just the sort of benefit that would be 
bestowed by the advent of speech. 24 Thus, according to Lieberman and 
Laitman's hypothesis, we may conclude, based on the recent descent of 
the larynx, that anatomically modern humans were the first and only ho­
minids to speak. In fact, according to Lieberman and Laitman, the Ne­
anderthals might have been capable of making some verbal sounds, but 
because their larynx was not nearly as low as ours, these sounds would 
have been highly nasalized and indistinct and would have rendered spo­
ken language virtually impossible.25 To back up their claim that only 
anatomically modern humans could speak, they point out that Nean­
derthals became extinct even though their brains were slightly larger than 
ours and their stature more robust. What could be a more plausible ex­
planation for their demise than their lack of language, which provided 
this new intruder with an insuperable advantage? 
The obvious problem for this hypothesis is that the soft tissue of the 
larynx cannot be preserved in the fossil record. However, Lieberman 
and Laitman argue that one can infer the location of the larynx by 
studying the shape of the skull and the roof of the mouth. When 
Lieberman and Laitman first presented this argument, there was no evi­
dence in the fossil record that Archaic H. sapiens had the same shape as 
is seen in anatomically modern humans, but recent discoveries have 
provided such evidence. The Lieberman and Laitman hypothesis has 
been further challenged by the discovery in the Kebara Cave in Israel of 
an adult male Neanderthal, called Moshe, who apparently had been de­
liberately buried there (he was placed on his back in a shallow pit, his 
right arm folded across his chest and his left arm across his abdomen). 
This evidence of burial rites is a significant indicator of cultural prac­
tices; but the finding that has really sparked all the controversy was the 
discovery of his hyoid bone: an extraordinary find, given the fragility of 
this small horseshoe-shaped bone that rests freely in the throat. Accord­
ing to Arensberg and colleagues,26 the hyoid is proof that Neanderthals 
could speak. Indeed, they argue that not just the Neanderthals but pos­
sibly even H erectus had the capacity to speakP 
Archaic Homo sapiens and Early Moderns 
1 63 
To complicate matters still further, recent studies have shown that the 
widespread belief that apes are anatomically incapable of speech-because 
of the shape of their mouth, lips, and tongue and the location of their lar­
ynx-may not be the straightforward issue that was once assumed. Close 
analysis of the vocalizations that Kanzi makes when he uses the lexigram 
board reveals that his high-pitched sounds, which can be difficult for the 
human ear to distinguish, are similar to the English words that he is com­
municating when using the lexigram board.28 This is something that I 
had become aware of almost from the beginning of my work at the LRC. 
I was sitting one day with Tolly and watching as Kanzi chose something 
to eat from the variety of foods that Sue had laid out for him. Kanzi was 
making what, to me, simply sounded like inarticulate vocalizations. But 
to Tolly's highly trained ear, it was clear that Kanzi was saying the English 
name of the food that he was about to eat before he chose it. Once Tolly 
had pointed this out to me, I could hear it too. For example, Kanzi would 
say "onion" before picking up the onion; but, because of the high pitch of 
his vocalizations, this came out as "ofiynn." Equally interesting was our 
observation that he was engaging in this private speech in much the same 
way as a small child would. 
Also very important here is the work of David Armstrong, Bill 
Stokoe, and Sherman Wilcox, and, more recently, Michael Corballis, on 
the gestural origins oflanguage.29 Armstrong, Stokoe, and Wilcox point 
out that the greatest problem with Lieberman and Laitman's hypothesis 
is that it conflates speech with oral speech. Moving the larynx and lips 
is really just one type of gesture, and signing (moving the hands, arms, 
facial muscles, head, and torso) is another. To be sure, there are certain 
advantages to oral speech over signing (it is easier to communicate in 
the dark, or in heavily forested areas, or when one is using one's hands); 
but then, there are advantages to signing over oral speech because one 
can communicate simultaneously through facial expressions, posture, 
and movement as well as with signs, and one can also communicate eas­
ily in noisy environments. 
According to Armstrong, Stokoe, and Wilcox, whatever the reason ho­
minids shifted from gesture to oral speech, the origins of language lie in 
the former. Quite recently, Par Segerdahl has taken an intriguing step to­
wards explaining why hominids may have shifted from gestural to oral 
speech.30 Scientists have long been accustomed to think of gesturing as 
constituting a vestige of humans' earliest communicative behaviors. How 
else are we to explain why we gesture unconsciously while speaking, and, 

1 64 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
indeed, why we even gesture while speaking on the telephone? Or why 
so many aphasics are still able to communicate effectively through ges­
ture? Or why a baby's first communicative acts are gestural? 
In the standard view-which goes back to the eighteenth-century 
philosophies-hominids first communicated nonverbally, by gesture, 
and then they acquired language, which by definition was spoken.3l In 
the modern version of this argument, we continue to gesture while we 
speak because the newer parts of the brain that process language were 
superimposed on the older parts of the brain that control nonverbal 
communication. Gesturing is thus seen as a redundant element in lin­
guistic communication; in much the same way, communications engi­
neers build in redundancies that enable listeners to understand a radio 
or television broadcast given that various sounds or pixels will always be 
lost in a transmission because of signal degradation or interference. In 
fact, the prevailing view of linguistic communication today amongst 
linguists and psycholinguists is that it involves several modalities, each 
controlled by a different center in the brain: linguistic (spoken or 
signed); paralinguistic, which involves any part of vocal behavior that 
affects the communicative content of an utterance but is not part of the 
linguistic system (intonation, stress, rate, pauses, pitch, and rhythm); 
and nonlinguistic, which involves any part of bodily behavior that af­
fects the communicative content of an utterance but is not part of the 
linguistic system (gestures, posture, facial expression, gaze, head and 
body movement, and proxemics). 
Segerdahl's hypothesis casts a different light on the role that gesturing 
played in the evolution of language. Segerdahl suggests that gesturing 
with their hands may have enabled hominids to develop language skills 
very early on by helping them to clarify the meaning of their (presum­
ably indistinct) vocalizations. Consider, for example, how a caregiver 
can understand her infant while no one else around her can; or how a 
therapist can learn to understand a child with severe facial-motor 
apraxia once she gets to know that child; or how an ethnographer be­
gins to understand the language of a completely foreign culture by im­
mersing herself in that culture. Segerhdahl's hypothesis thus draws on 
Tolly's groundbreaking work showing that what singles out language as 
a communication system is its reflexivity.32 In Segerdahl's hypothesis, 
the evolutionary dynamic at work in the origins of language would have 
been the development of the capacity to engage in such reflexive acts. 
Archaic Homo sapiens and Early Moderns 
1 65 
We are taking this important hypothesis a step further here. So much 
of our mutual understanding depends on shared context, history, atti­
tudes, and emotions. Through emotional signaling, we clarify what we 
mean, intend, desire, and feel. A child begins to understand and perform 
these acts long before he can begin to speak. A similar phenomenon may 
have occurred with Neanderthals, and, indeed, with far older hominids; 
for even though they probably lacked the capacity to articulate clearly, 
they might have been able to clarify their vocal intentions with those acts 
of pointing, head nods, facial expressions, and hand movements that we 
continue to use to clarify what we mean, want, intend, and so on. With 
time, the location of the larynx may have shifted so that vocal modula­
tions could take over the reflexive role originally played by hand gestures, 
thereby freeing up the hands for such activities as making more sophisti­
cated tools, painting on caves, and fashioning jewelry and pottery. 
It is speculative, admittedly, but worth considering, that the in­
creased use of vocalizations was stirred by the increasing complexity of 
co-regulated affective communication. In other words, as we became 
more complex in our affective interactions, we had to include more and 
more subtle affective variations. The tongue and the oral motor cavity 
provided the motor capacity for humans to express this needed extra 
variation, that is, in greater flexibility and capacity for variation than 
possible in the hands or fingers. Therefore, it is possible that as we used 
this system more for this new purpose, it was further developed in the 
sense that function does affect neural pathways and that somehow its 
increased use may have been associated with the changing structure. 
The descent of the larynx may well be connected with a significant ad­
vance in human culture, therefore, including a sharp increase in language 
skills; but not because it marks the sudden appearance of language, fully 
formed, as it were, in the way that Athena is said to have emerged from 
the head of Zeus. For language skills would have been developing slowly, 
over millennia, and would have been passed down from one generation 
to the next through the sorts of caregiving practices that are now referred 
to as motherese.33 If there was a sudden representational explosion that 
occurred roughly contemporaneously with the descent of the larynx, per­
haps it was in part because their greater articulatory capacities enabled 
humans to engage in other types of activities while they were speaking: 
something that would have been far more difficult when gesturing was 
critical for mutual understanding. 

1 66

THE COHESION O F  THE GROUP 
We will return to this discussion of the origins of language in Chapter 9. 
For the moment, we wish to emphasize how a gradual improvement in 
emotional signaling leads to a confluence of events. The parts of the 
brain responsible for vocalization, facial expressions, and motor plan­
ning alter their wiring in a favorable direction. In human evolution, 
each generation would have showed the next, through infant caregiving, 
how to signal emotions and thus how to master preverbal and, ulti­
mately, verbal communication. As each new generation learned to do 
this better through environmental challenges, as well as new central ner­
vous system pathways that were spurred on by these challenges, it pro­
vided a relatively more culturally advanced or richer set of learning 
interactions for the next generation. 
The importance of the skills that the child is acquiring at this stage 
for his ability to join the group into which he is born cannot be over­
stated. Long before a child acquires his first words he is acquiring the 
ability to understand the meaning of someone's facial expression, posٖ 
ture, movements, tone of voice, and direction of gaze. Indeed, as we will 
see in Chapter 7, it is only on the basis of these skills that a child is able 
to take the momentous step into language proper. The child must also 
be able to recognize when the words of others are not consistent with 
the emotional signals that they are giving off nonverbally. To develop a 
truly shared sense of reality, the members of a group have to be able to 
understand what each other really feels as well as what each other says. 
To achieve the sort of social stability that is reflected in the fossil 
record and artifacts, humans had to develop cultural practices that en­
hanced their infants' emotional, cognitive, communicative, and social 
capacities. By learning how to enhance their infants' ability to engage in 
emotional exchanges, and how to read and respond to their infants' 
emotional overtures as well as responses, they were enabling their in­
fants to develop in a variety of ways. They became aware of themselves; 
they learned to attend; they became curious; they understood causality; 
they developed empathy and morality. In this way, babies became social 
agents: members of a group, albeit with their own distinct personality 
and sense of self.

Representation and the 
Beginning of Logic: 
Homo sapiens sapiens 
WE SAW IN CHAPTER 2 how the sixth stage of functional/emo­
tional development involves learning to connect symbols and 
form larger categories. The child who masters this stage can think 
causally and figure out how one idea leads to another. This ability sets 
the stage for advancements in thinking. The child becomes more reflec­
tive and forms a symbolic sense of "self" and "other" that provides the 
basis for reality testing. 
A parallel progression can be glimpsed in the fossil trail left by our 
early modern human ancestors. The earliest known Homo sapiens sapiens 
fossil dates from around 1 30,000 years ago and was found at Omo in 
East Mrica. By 40,000 years ago, H. sapiens sapiens had migrated into 
Europe, and between 20,000 and 1 0,000 years ago they migrated to the 
Americas. The Cro Magnon humans, named after the fossils found in 
the Cro Magnon cave near Les Eyzies in the Dordogne, France, lived be­
tween 40,000 and 1 0,000 years ago. They were different from coexisting 
Neanderthalers in various ways: They had a higher forehead, less promi­
nent brow-ridges, smaller teeth, less robust bodies, and reduced sexual 
dimorphism (with males around 1 .8 meters tall and females around 1 .7 
meters). Curiously, their average brain size was slightly smaller than that 
of the Neanderthalers (around 1,350 milliliters). 
The Cro Magnon were able to adapt to the severe conditions of the Ice 
Age; they battled large carnivores and successfully hunted the formidable 
1 1"7 

1 68 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
mammoths (which provided them with a source of clothing and fuel; 
even the bones were used for dwellings). In fact, the Cro Magnon were 
making advances across various domains. For example, they began to 
live in larger and larger groups, their social structures developing greater 
complexity; they cared for their sick and their elderly; they performed 
burial rites for the young as well as the old. Their technological advances 
are seen in the sealed dwellings that protected them against the ele­
ments; they were heating these dwellings and cooking their food; they 
were even using fuel as a source of illumination. They were developing 
complex tools and weapons for hunting, such as bows and arrows, 
spears, and animal traps; they wore clothing made from furs or hides 
that they sewed with bone needles; and there are signs that they were 
starting to trade. Jewelry and ornaments made from shells and bones are 
evidence of artistic representation. Bur the great expression of their cul­
ture is the remarkably sophisticated cave art created between 25,000 and 
13,000 years ago. Typically, these drawings are found deep under­
ground, far from the living quarters of the caves. The very inaccessibility 
of these drawings suggests that they had a sacred function. From the way 
that certain aspects of the animals are depicted, it seems clear that spe­
cific artistic conventions were being passed down from one generation 
to the next. 
The levels of emotional development that we've laid out help us to 
understand the factors underlying these social, cultural, technological, 
and personal advances. They also give us a new way of looking at one 
of the great mysteries in paleoanthropology: the dramatic appearance of 
cave art. Because of the sophisticated skills and concepts demonstrated 
in these paintings, evolurionary theorists of a determinist bent have 
been tempted to postulate that the humans who created them must 
have experienced some sort of genetic muration that suddenly endowed 
them with advanced representational abilities. We have already seen a 
similar Big Bang argument used to explain not only the origins of lan­
guage but also the "language explosion" that children typically experi­
ence between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four months. The 
comparison between a child's language explosion and the symbolic ex­
plosion that occurred during the Aurignacian period is illuminating. As 
we saw in Chapter 5, and will see again in Chapter 7, the factors leading 
up to each so-called explosion are very similar. Each time, there were 
long, slow advances in emotional signaling.

THE ALTAMI RA CAVE PAINTINGS 
In 1 879, one of the greatest of all discoveries in the history of paleoan­
thropology was made, not by an archaeologist, or even an amateur 
scientist, but by a five-year-old girl. Maria Marcelino Sanza de Sautuola 
had gone with her grandfather to explore one of the caves at Altamira, in 
Spain. Wandering off on her own, she walked about 30 meters into the 
cave and then simply looked up. What she saw above her on the ceiling 
were some of the greatest Paleolithic works of art ever discovered. 
These fifteen large bison (and other animals: deer, wild boar, a horse) 
were produced between 13,500 and 1 1,000 years ago, not all at once but 
over the span of several centuries. Drawn with ochre and zinc oxides, 
some of the remarkably detailed and realistic animals have as many as 
four colors. The artists also exploited the natural contours of the rock to 
create a three-dimensional effect. 
Psychohistorians of art have compared these paintings to the sort of 
visual realism (though created with much greater skill) that we see in the 
drawings of children between the ages of eight and twelve. For we see in 
these paintings the same attention to detail, form, and relative size, and 
an exploration of new techniques for representing depth and linear per­
spective, that we see in the paintings of children in the later stages of 
concrete operational and early formal operational thinking.1 
So developed are the skills manifest in these paintings that many 
evolutionary theorists were led to conclude that the humans who 
painted them must have crossed some great Cognitive Divide. The idea 
lent itself perfectly to the Big Bang hypothesis about the origins of lan­
guage and the idea that language, and symbolic capacities in general, 
suddenly emerged in human beings as the result of a genetic mutation. 
In fact, the cave drawings soon became one of the most important of 
all the arguments in the discontinuity thesis that anatomically modern 
humans were the first-and only-humans to possess language capa­
cities. Each year, however, has brought to light some new archaeologi­
cal discovery that challenges this argument. The picture that is now 
emerging contradicts simple genetic explanations. For it appears that 
hominids were developing representational skills very slowly; not, as 
one might expect, over thousands, but over hundreds of thousands, 
and possibly even millions of years, and that these skills were to a great 
extent culturally transmitted.

REPRESENTING THE B ODY: 
FROM THE MAKAPANSGAT COBBLE 
TO THE VENUS O F  WILLENDORF 
The possibility that representational skills originated with our earliest 
hominid ancestors was given a boost in 1998 when a dark red water­
worn piece of ironstone, approximately 3 million years old, was discov­
ered in the South African cave of Makapansgat.2 Apparently, it had 
been found by an Australopithecine in a site that was at least 30 kilo­
meters away and brought back to the cave. What is so striking about 
this stone is its resemblance to a human face. Was this the reason it was 
collected? 
In Chapter 4 we argued that the Australopithecines had probably 
reached as high as our fourth stage of fie development. Typically, a child 
of about eighteen months can recognize a family face in a photograph. 
Thus, the ability to recognize the stone as an image of a face, and fur­
thermore to collect it for that reason, would certainly bear out placing 
the Australopithecines at this high a level of fie development. But then, 
if we accept this argument, we must seriously begin to question the as­
sumption of a sharp discontinuity between the genus Australopithecus 
and the genus Homo.3 Perhaps the depiction at the American Museum 
of Natural History in New York of the pair of individuals who left the 
Laetoli footprints (see Chapter 4, note 12) is not so far-fetched after all. 
Numerous natural objects collected and carried because of some 
striking visual property (so-called manuports) have been found, al­
though none as early as the Makapansgat cobble. Two other finds indi­
cating the early development of symbolic skills are the Acheulian 
figurines found in Berekhat Ram, Israel, and Tan-Tan, Morocco.4 The 
former is a fragment of volcanic tuff measuring 35 millimeters that re­
sembles a female figure. Perhaps most striking about this figurine are the 
grooves around its neck and arms. Alexander Marschack has shown that 
these markings were deliberately put there, as much as 800,000 years 
ago. Not only did the Archaic humans who discovered this rock likely 
recognize its resemblance to a human female, but they may even have 
tried to enhance this aspect.5 
If, as these datings suggest, these manuports were collected by Archaic 
H sapiens, this would certainly seem to support our hypothesis in Chap­
ter 5 that these early humans had begun to acquire symbolic capacities; 
Representation and the Beginning of Logic 
1 71 
for the figurines apparently present us with a deliberate attempt to en­
hance the mimetic features of a natural object. One cannot help but 
wonder whether there is a parallel here to the manner in which children 
rum corncobs into dolls, or sticks into guns. 
Another intriguing sign of advancing symbolic skills in Archaic H 
sapiens is the pieces of ochre, discovered in many parts of the world, that 
were carried into settlement sites in South Africa between 900,000 and 
800,000 years ago. They may have been used for body painting, skin 
protection, or tanning hides. We have substantial evidence that the Ne­
anderthalers used pigments for some sort of funereal rite. For example, a 
Neanderthal skeleton found at Le Moustier had been sprinkled with red 
powder; red pigment was found around the head of the skeleton of La 
Chapelle and near two skeletons at Qafzed, Israel, and many others.6 
And a small ochre pebble with oblique striations was found in an 
Acheulian layer at Hunsgi, southern India. This pebble is between 
300,000 and 200,000 years old and seems to have been used as a crayon 
on a rock. 
As we can see, the picture that is emerging as the result of recent ar­
chaeological discoveries is one of gradually developing representational 
abilities. The skills manifest in the cave art drawings did not come about 
through a sudden mutation but rather through a prolonged process that 
led up to the flowering of these skills between 33,000 and 20,000 years 
ago, at the beginning of the Aurignacian period.? One of the most strik­
ing manifestations of this development is the appearance of the Venus 
figurines. 
These small representations of women (and a few men, too) were 
made of clay or carved in stone, ivory, and wood. Perhaps the most fa­
mous of these figurines is the Venus ofWillendorf, which, like many of 
its genre, is faceless and has large breasts, stomach, and thighs. The most 
popular of the many theories about the function of the Venus figurines 
is that they were fertility objects and possibly symbols of an earth god­
dess cult. Bruce Dickson has even suggested that these artifacts may 
present us with the first evidence of institutional forms of religious be­
lief and practice.8 Whether or not we can go this far, the Venus figurines 
clearly represent a significant step forward in the capacity of H. sapiens 
sapiens to engage in abstract causal thinking. For to use a representation 
of the human body in some sort of rite indicates an ability to combine 
ideas in a way that has meaning for a group.

THE FI RST DRAWINGS 
The first signs of drawing are two engraved ochre stones, between 
100,000 and 70,000 years old, that were found in the Blombos Cave 
near Cape Town, South Mrica. The Blombos Cave has pushed back our 
views about the cognitive abilities of early moderns in several key re­
spects. Among the kinds of evidence found there are 
• 
the oldest bone tools; 
• the earliest evidence for fishing; 
• sophisticated spearheads made with techniques comparable to those seen 
in Europe 20,000 years ago; 
• purposeful use of space within the cave, including distinct hearth areas 
and discrete areas where bone and stone were worked to manufacture 
tools; and 
• large pieces of ochre pigment ground into a fine powder.9 
The two engraved pieces of ochre found at the Blombos cave were 
first scraped and ground to create flat surfaces and then marked with 
cross hatches and lines to create a consistent geometric motif. The re­
sulting pattern is similar to the sorts of abstract patterns seen along with 
the animal drawings in the cave art of France and Spain (produced 
somewhere between 60,000 and 90,000 years later). Whether or not 
this engraving provides us with evidence that the persons who created it 
had fully syntactical language, as some have claimed, it seems likely that 
the intent behind these engravings was symbolic. 10 
Numerous bones and stones found in Europe are marked with simi­
lar engravings. Twelve horse bones from the French rock shelter of Abri 
Suard and a fragment of a bovine rib from Le Pech de rAze, around 
300,000 years old, have what appear to be intentional engravings com­
prised of a series of connected double arcs. And several bones from Bilz­
ingsleben, Germany, from around the same time have a series of parallel 
incisions. I I These designs are particularly intriguing because they sug­
gest that our early human ancestors were progressing through the same 
sort of representational development as children. Typically, a child's first 
drawings are scribbles. She then builds up a repertoire of twenty or so 
elementary units and begins to combine them into patterns. 12 The earli­
est identifiable drawings on bone or stone are composed entirely of inci-
Representation and the Beginning of Logic 
1 73 
sions or cup marks. To begin with, the incisions are simply a single ver­
tical line (seen on several of the bones from Bizlingsleben); but, dating 
from about 300,000 B.C., we see series of parallel incisions; and by 
54,000 years ago, a fan-like engraved motif on the Siga Phalange that 
was found in a cave in the Crimea. 
A child in the early stage of drawing does not have the sorts of fine 
motor control skills necessary to produce accurate mimetic representa­
tions. At the first stage of artistic development, the child-as-actor and 
the actual representation are undifferentiated; the child's bodily move­
ments, the trail of the brush on the paper, and the movement of the 
imaginary object are all compressed into a visual and motor act. 13 Some 
scribbles are clearly just random physical acts, but some are clearly in­
tended to be representational. It is really only from the context that we 
can discern whether a scribble was intended to be representational.I4 
The same point likely holds true for these first apparent drawings. 
Perhaps, like young children, these early humans also lacked the sorts of 
fine motor control skills necessary to produce accurate representations. 
As with a young child's scribbles, whether or not markings can be inter­
preted as symbolic depends on the context in which they were pro­
duced. For example, two bones, 1 1 0,000 years old, each with a hole 
bored through the top, were found in Bocksteinschmiede, Germany. 
These bones were probably used in ritual contexts, and, for that reason, 
the carving can be seen as representational.I5 A similar point applies to 
the first European example of cup marks, found at the French Mouste­
rian site of La Ferrassie. A Neanderthal child was buried underneath a 
large limestone rock with eighteen small cup marks on the surface, 
mostly in pairs, and placed in such a way that the cup marks were facing 
the child's body. Whatever the significance of the cup marks, it seems 
clear that the intention behind them was symbolic. 
Even more striking is the rock art discovered at Ubirr, in Australia. 
These paintings, which date between 60,000 and 40,000 years ago, are 
surprisingly advanced. They contain stick figures that, among other 
things, depict a running male figure carrying hunting gear. Many of the 
figures are arranged in groups that appear to depict ancient hunting 
practices, or, perhaps, ritual activities. 
The paintings thus serve as evidence of important cultural advances 
taking place at this time insofar as they clearly served an important 
symbolic function. They may also hint at the growing ability of these 

1 74 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
early modern humans to reflect on their self-identity both as a group 
and, perhaps, as individuals. Indeed, as we will see in the following sec­
tion, the representational advances displayed in these paintings were 
part of a striking development in the cognitive abilities of these early 
modern humans. 
BEGINNING TO THINK LOGICALLY 
Evidence that these early modern humans were beginning to build 
bridges between their ideas, and beginning to think logically, is pro­
vided by the first colonization of Australia, which required them to 
build some sort of crude transport to cross the sea about 60,000 years 
ago.16 By the start of the Aurignacian period, we see evidence that they 
were developing the capacity to think logically and to form a clear pic­
ture of reality; indeed, the social advances that occurred at this time 
would have demanded a significant advance in the capacity of early 
modern humans to build bridges between ideas. 
For example, the open-air settlements around Pavlov and Dolni Ve­
stonice in southern Moravia in the Czech Republic date from this period 
(around 27,000 years ago). In the Dolni Vestonice settlement, which 
housed between 1 00 and 125 inhabitants, pit houses have been discov­
ered in which the floor had been sunk a meter into the ground to facili­
tate sealing between the roof and floor for protection against winter 
storms. The walls, built of wooden posts, were covered with animal 
hides. The planning and knowledge required to build such complex 
structures certainly suggest a capacity to think logically. There is even ev­
idence that they were using fuel derived from mammoths to heat their 
structures. 17 
The discoveries made at the settlements of Sungir, on the outskirts of 
Moscow, provide similar evidence. The remains of surface dwellings re­
veal hearths and pits of various sizes, work areas where sophisticated 
stone and bone implements were manufactured, and four tombs be­
tween 25,000 and 20,000 years old filled with tools, jewelry, weapons, 
and clothing. These tombs contained the remains of two men, a boy, 
and a girl. It appears that the males were clad in shirts, long pants with 
attached footwear, over-the-knee boots, short outer cloaks, and fur hats; 
the girl wore a hood. One of the men's clothing was decorated with 
Representation and the Beginning of Logic 
1 75 
3,000 ivory beads and his hat was circled with perforated arctic fox 
teeth. Five thousand beads were sewn into the boy's clothing and he 
wore a belt made of more than 250 drilled arctic fox canines. 1 8  
The full significance of these finds remains to be established, but it 
seems likely that the Sungir tombs present us with evidence of a com­
plex social hierarchy, possibly hereditary, given the boy's clothing;19 
complex funereal rites associated with social status; sophisticated mil­
linery skills; and even advanced hunting techniques.20 Thus, from a fie 
perspective, the archaeological evidence of dwellings and tombs suggests 
that these early modern humans were able to perceive connections be­
tween natural events and plan their actions accordingly, and to develop 
cultural and religious practices that would have fostered a shared sense 
of reality amongst the members of the group. 
REPRESENTATION AN D LOGICAL 
THINKING IN NONH UMAN PRI MATES 
One of the more fascinating questions to surface in comparative re­
search over the past decade is whether great apes are capable of inten­
tionally creating artistic representations. There has been a fair amount 
of controversy over the paintings done by Koko and Michael, the goril­
las studied by Penny Patterson. These paintings are all highly abstract 
and easily dismissed as the random creations that result when a gorilla is 
armed with a paint brush. Yet the paintings display several noteworthy 
features: the striking and harmonious use of color; the control shown in 
the strokes; and, most important of all, the presence of mimetic fea­
tures. For example, in the painting Bird, which Koko made of a blue­
bird that used to visit her, there is a definite sense of a bird in flight; and 
in the painting Toy Dinosaur, made by Michael, one can discern what 
looks like a deliberate attempt to represent the scales on the dinosaur 
that was one of Michael's favorite toys. 
I have seen Kanzi do something very similar myself. To begin with, 
his attempts at drawing were very much like those of a young child, that 
is, scribbles that were probably just random physical acts. But soon after 
this, the scribbles started to become more purposive and to be com­
bined into very simple patterns. When I returned to the lab a year later, 
I could see that an important advance had taken place in Kanzi's artistic 

1 76 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
abilities. I watched as he carefully tried to make a painting of one of the 
lexigram symbols. He first looked carefully at the lexigram and then 
produced very slow and controlled strokes on his paper. At one point, 
his line became a little wavy and I watched as he tried to rub the line 
out with his hand and then redrew it. 
The resulting picture did indeed bear a striking resemblance to the 
lexigram. My most memorable experience in this regard, however, was 
the day that Mary took me in to look at Panbanisha's bedroom. There on 
the wall were several paintings; intention was unmistakable. 
Are these representational skills an aberration, an island of expertise, 
as it were, in an animal that is incapable of thinking logically? To be 
sure, there are many cases of so-called autistic savants who are signifi­
cantly cognitively impaired yet capable of executing the most remark­
ably sophisticated drawings. One might thus be tempted to conclude 
that something similar is applicable here: that Kanzi and Panbanisha 
possess remarkable representational skills, far in advance of their mental 
abilities. But, in fact, there is also evidence that they have the ability to 
build bridges between their ideas. 
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a number of psychologists 
set out to prove that animals are incapable of such a feat. Perhaps the 
most famous of these studies are Thorndike's experiments on the "learn­
ing curve."21 Thorndike designed a puzzle box to measure the number of 
times a cat placed inside would randomly pull on chains and levers in or­
der to escape. He found that when practice days were plotted against the 
amount of time required to free itself, a learning curve emerged; it fell 
rapidly at first, and then climbed gradually until it approached a hori­
zontal line that signified the point at which the cat had "mastered" the 
task. According to Thorndike, his results showed how animal "learning" 
takes place in a series of brute repetitions that gradually "stamp" the cor­
rect response into the animal's behavior. If one should happen to see the 
cat for the first time at the very end of this process, one might naturally 
assume that the cat was exhibiting some form of insight in its ability to 
free itself so quickly from the box. And so, too, with any of the other 
known examples of so-called animal intelligence: We are tempted to 
credit an animal with the capacity to reason only because we have not 
witnessed the "stamping in" process. 
Thorndike's experiments received their first serious challenge in the 
1920s when Wolfgang Kohler set out to ascertain whether chimpanzees 
Representation and the Beginning of Logic 
1 77 
are capable of insightful problem solving.22 Kohler's famous studies of the 
chimpanzees Chica, Grande, Konsul, and Sultan on the island of Tener­
iffe played a pivotal role in the development of ape research. Kohler 
would place a chimp in an enclosed area in which a bunch of bananas 
had been hung out of reach. To reach the bananas, the chimp had to use 
an object as a tool. Scattered around the area were various wooden boxes 
and sticks of different lengths. The chimpanzees were quite adept at us­
ing the sticks as rakes to pull in bananas that had been placed out of 
reach; they would drag the boxes to a point underneath the bananas, 
stack them one upon another, and climb up to reach the bunch. But the 
star of Kohler's experiments was Sultan. In one experiment, Sultan was 
given two sticks, neither of which was long enough to reach the bananas. 
After several frantic attempts to knock the bananas down by leaping with 
one of the sticks in his hands, Sultan sat down and could be observed 
reRecting quietly on the ptoblem. Suddenly, he leaped up and pushed the 
thinner stick into the hollow of the thicker one, thereby creating a pole 
that was long enough to pull in the bananas. 
Our understanding of chimpanzee tool-use has grown by leaps and 
bounds over the past few decades. We now know that different chim­
panzee cultures have different toolmaking practices, depending on the 
materials at hand and the problems that need to be solved. The chim­
panzees of the Tat forest have been observed to select their hammers ac­
cording to the type of nut that needs to be opened, and to collect and 
carry the appropriate type of hammer to a site where those nuts are 
found. They also select the twigs they use to extract food from various 
types of nest according to the appropriate thickness, and chew the twig 
to the appropriate length for a given site. Indeed, as Boesch and Boesch­
Achermann point out, it is hardly surprising that they are able to engage 
in this sort of causal reasoning given the sort of complex social life they 
experience. 
In my work with Kanzi, I have often wondered whether he hasn't 
reached as far as the seventh stage of multicausal thinking. For example, 
one morning Sue showed up at the lab having slept only a couple of 
hours. The day before had been insane, one person after another assail­
ing her with some crisis that urgently needed to be handled. When I left 
her at 1 :30 in the morning, she was heading back to her office to answer 
the day's e-mails and then check that everything at the center was fine. 
She was looking a little worse for wear when she showed up at 6:30 the 

1 78 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
next morning. When he saw her, Kanzi came bounding over as he usu­
ally did, but Sue simply didn't have the energy to play. In fact, she was 
so tired that, for the very first time in my experience, she went to fix 
herself a cup of coffee. This seemed to alarm Kanzi as well. In a flash, 
his mood changed completely; he rushed over to Sue and, very gently, 
began to poke and prod her to make sure that she was alright. Mter she 
had passed this physical, he began to explore other possible problems. 
He pointed at the lexigram for bad and then stared intently in her eyes. 
He appeared to be asking Sue whether she was angry with him, and cer­
tainly Sue interpreted it in this way because she quickly assuted him 
that she wasn't. Then Kanzi hit the key for Panbanisha: Was he asking 
whether Sue was angry with one of the other bonobos? This was how 
Sue interpreted it, for she quickly assured him that she wasn't upset with 
anybody. But Kanzi still wasn't satisfied. He had been eating cereal 
when we came in, which he now fetched and offered to her. When Sue 
declined this, he went and fetched his toy doggie, which Sue cursorily 
patted. It was incredible to see how concerned he was about her; but 
even more extraordinary was how systematically he was trying to figure 
out what the problem was.23 
I have never seen Kanzi try to solve a problem by trial-and-error. 
Rather, he always studies a problem before he acts, and he always assesses 
and adjusts his actions. Maybe most interesting of all, he comes up with 
innovative solutions to problems. For example, he once wanted to ask 
Mary where I was, but there is no lexigram for my name on the board. I 
had been carrying a rucksack around all day, which I'd left in the corner 
of the group room. Seeing this, Kanzi rushed over and pointed to it, and 
then looked around. When Mary asked him whether he was looking for 
"Stuart," he immediately vocalized "uh huh." 
We saw in Chapter 3 how Kanzi became quite adept at playing Pac­
Man. It is really not surprising that Kanzi should perform so well on this 
sort of visual-spatial task. After all, consider the chimpanzee hunting prac­
tices that we looked at in Chapter 4. We saw there how Brutus, one of the 
chimpanzees that Boesch and Boesch-Achermann have studied in the Tii 
forest, is able to anticipate the direction in which a prey will flee and even 
project how long it will take it to arrive at a certain point. When one 
thinks about the sorts of visual-spatial skills involved in these complex 
problem-solving interactions, it makes sense to place the chimps at still a 
higher level of fie development. Indeed, one might argue that, at least in 
some domains, chimps have reached our sixth stage of f/ e development. 
Representation and the Beginning of Logic 
1 79 
The real lesson here is not that great apes should be ranked higher on 
the sort of Pia get ian stage-model scale that we looked at in Chapter 3; it 
is that we should adopt another of Piaget's important concepts for our 
assessment of great ape intelligence, the concept of decalage. In Piaget's 
structuralist theory, once a child has acquired a construct-say, the seri­
ation scheme-it should apply to all domains; but in practice, a child 
may master seriation in one domain (e.g., length) a couple of years be­
fore she does so in another domain (e.g., weight). This is what Piaget 
meant by horizontal decalage: You cannot infer from a child's ability to 
solve seriation problems in one domain that she can solve seriation 
problems in all domains. 
A similar phenomenon applies to the great apes. The capacity of great 
apes in the wild to solve visual-spatial problems is as high as Level 7 of 
our fie framework. This is a consequence, given their environmental 
contingencies, of their visual-spatial system having developed first. They 
had to become sophisticated visual-spatial thinkers in order to deal with 
the problems they faced involving space and movement. Visual-spatial 
problem solving reaches Level 7 when it involves planned actions that 
can flexibly accommodate or be altered to the challenge at hand. With 
Kanzi we see a transition from visual-spatial to verbal logical thinking; 
but this transition was only possible because of his latent capacity for 
advanced visual-spatial reasoning: a capacity that the lexigram board ac­
tually capitalized on. 
The same point must apply to our earliest human ancestors. As we 
have seen in the foregoing chapters, these early humans were making 
tools and perhaps even building shelters long before they had a fully de­
veloped language. These creatures could not have survived for the length 
of time that they did unless they were capable of some sort of nonverbal 
logical thinking. As we will see in Chapter 7, this nonverbal building of 
bridges between ideas may then have led the way to early humans' ability 
to engage in verbal bridge building between ideas and, indeed, to form 
larger and larger groups. 
We have hypothesized that advances in affective communication not 
only fostered the ability to create and build bridges between symbols-it 
is affective communication, after all, that enables symbols to be used in­
teractively and facilitates this logical bridge-building pattern-but also 
enabled early modern humans to communicate with one another very 
rapidly and to negotiate, almost implicitly, the basics of group survival 
(such as safety and danger, approval/disapproval, dominance/submission). 

1 80 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Living in larger and more stable collectives provided individuals with the 
opportunity to be more reflective and creative and may have been a criti­
cal factor in our extraordinary technological ascent. Because we have be­
come so conditioned to think reductionistically, we assume that, if there 
was a turning point in human evolution sometime in the Pleistocene, it 
must have been produced by a genetic mutation. The real engine in our 
evolution, however, was affect signaling, which underpins the develop­
ment of the shared sense of reality on which a large group structure 
depends. As we will show more fully in Chapter 12, "The Cohesion of 
the Group" may not be nearly as catchy a slogan as "The Survival of the 
Fittest," but it comes much closer to capturing the essence of the human 
evolutionary dynamic.

The Engine of Evolution 
T
HE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF evolutionary logic, to which we alluded 
in the introduction to this book, is that, in Charles Darwin's fa­
mous words, there must be some "organisation" on which "the whole 
has progressed."! But, as McShea has documented,2 there have been 
many fruitless attempts over the years to define this organizing principle, 
each of them failing to capture all the subtle nuances or anomalies in 
evolution. Time and again evolutionary theorists have attempted to re­
configure the Great Chain of Being, with some principle of complexity 
assuming the role that medievalists assigned to Divine Intention. But, as 
McShea shows, apart from a subtle tendency to define complexity tauto­
logically-as that which is naturally selected-there are many examples 
where one might argue that simplicity is really the driving mechanism. 
The failure to operationalize Darwin's nebulous concept of organiza­
tion indicates that evolutionary theorists may have to consider distinct 
"organizing principles" governing the progression of different genera. 
Such a point, we have argued, is particularly important regarding the 
evolution of humans; for our central hypothesis is that, in the higher 
primates and hominids, there is a second fundamental mechanism that 
is not hard-wired but culturally transmitted. 
In other words, we are challenging the continuum picture that lies at 
the heart of any attempt to find a universal construct or unitary mecha­
nism underlying evolution. Furthermore, we are challenging the princi­
ple that the basic mechanism of evolution is simply the survival of an 
organism's genes. As we have seen over the past few years, when this ar­
gument is applied to human nature, it turns out that, no matter what 
1 Q l

1 82 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
the behavior, one can always find some way of explaining why it would 
have been selected for its role in enhancing reproductive success. 
To be sure, an organism's ability to promote the survival of its genes is 
a necessary condition of evolution, but it is not a sufficient explanation 
for the evolution of the higher-level reflective thinking skills and com­
plex social behaviors seen in human beings. We have proposed an alter­
native hypothesis for the evolution of these capacities that not only fits 
with the existing paleoanthropological and biological data but also ac­
cords with our current understanding of the factors involved in the de­
velopment of these higher capacities. In our alternative hypothesis, the 
growth of greater ability in co-regulated emotional communication 
along with changes in the developmental manifold are the primary or­
ganizing principles of evolution in higher primates. Indeed, these two 
primary factors are inextricably connected. 
When an organism is involved in a continuous flow of back-and-forth 
communication, it is constantly sampling subtle variations in its environ­
ment. As we saw in Chapter 2, in humans, affects mobilize the ability to 
focus on and process these sensory variations. Each time the organism re­
sponds, it also changes that environment ever so slightly. As it changes 
the environment, the organism creates variation that it must then pro­
cess. In higher-level biological systems, that is, the primate and human 
brain, this continuing exposure to greater variation challenges the organ­
ism to discriminate more subtly among these variations. Each more dis­
criminated perception leads to a slightly altered response that in turn 
alters the environment further, resulting in a cycle of increasing differen­
tiation. For this to occur, however, the organism must be involved in a 
continuous flow of co-regulated communication. Only a continuous 
flow permits a continuous sampling of subtle variations. 
Such an expanding range of environmental variations would likely 
have occurred in the rearing environment of hominid infants as gradu­
ally more complex caregiver-infant interactions took place. This process 
may have occurred in the following manner: As the infant gestured or 
vocalized to its caregiver, the caregiver's response changed ever so slightly 
to deal with the infant's affective overture. In turn, the infant now had an 
opportunity to process an ever so slightly novel affective response from 
the caregiver. As this process repeated itself, their co-regulated communi­
cation became more and more differentiated. Therefore, once an infant 
begins two-way communication with affective signaling, there is a ten-
The Engine of Evolution 
1 83 
dency (with an adaptive caregiver) to become part of an increasingly 
more differentiated interactive system. 
The functional capacity for co-regulated emotional communication 
ultimately led to the ability to operate in triads, extended families, and 
small groups, as we described in Chapters 2 and 4. Thus, as these social 
patterns were forming, there was an intricate interaction between cul­
ture and individual and social differentiation, all at the same time. That 
is, culture itself was an integral part of the organism's changing sensory­
affective world as it emanated from and, in turn, enriched intra- and in­
terpersonal development. 
In all likelihood, as we shall see in Chapter 10, this type of learning 
interaction also facilitates new neural pathways in the brain. Interest­
ingly, the pathways that have to do with subtle sensory affective discrim­
ination, pattern recognition, and ever more complex subtle response 
patterns are part of important functions (and related central nervous sys­
tem structures, such as the prefrontal cortex) that in part distinguish 
modern humans from nonhuman primates and earlier human species. 
We can see, therefore, that the pathway towards human intelligence in­
cludes gradually increasing functional capacities in co-regulated com­
munication that enables problem solving, social organization, and the 
like. Simple reproductive success does not appear, therefore, to be an ad­
equate explanation of higher levels of intelligence and high levels of so­
cial organization. 
To be sure, one might still want to insist that higher levels of intelli­
gence enable organisms to influence their environments and thereby per­
petuate their genes; but a more reasonable organizing principle for the 
evolution of humans' higher reflective abilities is to think in terms of 
greater functional/emotional capacity, which we define as the ability o/the 
organism to engage in co-regulated affective communication, where this com­
munication becomes more and more difirentiated over time. This definition 
of complexity is different from other proposed definitions of complexity, 
including general information-processing models,3 and avoids the sorts 
of methodological problems that plague these other definitions.4 
Co-regulated emotional communication that gets ever more subtly 
differentiated enables the organism to respond to and, in the process, al­
ter its environment, and then respond to these new contingencies. As we 
saw in Chapter 2, this capacity to respond to and alter one's environment 
can be seen as a general definition of intelligent behavior. Therefore, our 

1 84 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
hypothesis holds that the evolutionary line leading to human intelligence 
may have been characterized by a gradually increasing functional capac­
ity for co-regulated communication, culminating in a nervous system 
with the capacity for affective reciprocity. As we discussed in Chapter 2, 
it is the affective system that brings physiology and emotional and social 
functioning together. In a newborn baby, physiologic reactivity is the 
foundation for the development of the affective signaling system, which 
emerges as physiological reactivity takes on affective qualities through in­
fant-caregiver interactions. As we saw in Chapter 2, it is this enhanced 
signaling system that enables the infant to construct patterns that even­
tually take on meaning and leads to different levels of emotional and in­
tellectual organization.

The Development of 
Language and Intelligence 
Introduction 
I
N T H I S  S E CT I O N  WE look at the development of language and intel­
ligence. Significantly, for all the attention that the evolution of lan­
guage and intelligence has received, the role of emotions in their 
development has received relatively little consideration. As we will see, 
there are interesting historical reasons for this glaring omission; these 
have been perpetuated in the Western view of language and intelligence 
as autonomous faculties. By looking at the evolution and development of 
language and intelligence through the lens of our functional/emotional 
framework, we introduce a critical new dimension into the important 
body of work examining the relationship between emotional, commu­
nicative, cognitive, and language development. Through this lens, we are 
better able to understand the complex interrelationships between the dif­
ferent aspects of a subject's development, including early emotional inter­
actions and the formation of neuronal pathways in the brain and the 
development of new cognitive capacities. We are also able to frame a new 
hypothesis about the origins of speech. In the final chapter of this section, 
we present our most recent work on understanding the pathways to and 
from autism and explore how the remarkable progress of a group of chil­
dren has helped to reveal the relationship between emotions, language, 
and cognition.

The Origins of Language 
I
N T H E  P RE C E D I N G  C HAPTERS , we concentrated on the develop-
. ment of intelligence and social skills and paid relatively little atten­
tion to what many would regard as the most important of our higher 
human attributes: language. Indeed, for a large contingent of evolution-" 
ary theorists, it was the acquisition of language that made us human, 
and not our larger brains or our ability to walk on two legs. Their argu­
ment is that, because of its unique structure, language enables human 
beings to develop complex and novel thoughts that can be communi­
cated at a speed and with an economy unrivalled by any nonhuman 
communication system.l This line of thinking adds that the power un­
leashed by language accounts for the explosion of representational arti­
facts 30,000 years ago; our species' extraordinary technological advance 
ever since; our domination of all other species and our conquest of 
Homo neanderthalis; the emergence of agriculture around 10,000 years 
ago; and the development since that time of civilizations and complex 
social institutions. Meanwhile, the great apes are said to have remained 
in the same ecological niche that they inhabited 3.5 million years ago, 
and in much the same state. The only explanation for this overwhelm­
ing disparity, according to this discontinuity theory, must be that we 
possess language, whereas the other primates are constrained by their 
linear forms of gestural communication.2 
As it turns out, this argument has quite a long history in Western 
thought. In the eighteenth century, it was widely argued that what sets 
humans apart from animals is that we are the only species that possesses 
speech. Speech was said to enable us to exercise voluntary control over the 
1 87 

1 88 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
ideas coursing through our minds. According to the influential writings of 
the Abbe de Condillac, speech forces us, because of its unique structure, 
to analyze our thoughts: to break complex ideas down into their compo­
nent parts, which can then be named, recognized, recalled, reflected 
upon, recombined, and, of course, communicated. At some point in our 
prehistory, primitive humans could communicate only nonlinguistically 
and thus were incapable of thinking. What remained an utter mystery for 
Condillac, however, and for eighteenth-century philosophers in general, 
was how primitive humans took that first prodigious step from what was 
called "natural language"-communicating by gestures and facial expres­
sions-into the realm of speech, which provided early humans with the 
mental capacities necessary to form societies. 
This mystery has remained with us ever since. Noam Chomsky made 
famous the so-called Big Bang hypothesis, according to which language 
must have emerged from a monster genetic mutation sometime during 
the Pleistocene. Given the preeminent cognitive, social, and commu­
nicative advantages bestowed by language, such a "language gene" 
would have been naturally selected. Chomsky has been assailed from . 
many quarters for advocating such a miraculous thesis. But really, his ar­
gument simply implies that the origins oflanguage are fated to remain a 
mystery forever. All that one can safely say is that language could not 
have evolved from prelinguistic communication systems, given the pro­
nounced structural differences between language and those systems; any 
scenario one might sketch would fall victim to the cardinal sin in evolu­
tionary theory of "Just-So" reasoning. Hence, for all intents and pur­
poses, one might just as well settle for an evolutionary myth such as the 
Big Bang hypothesis.3 
THE DEVELOPMENTAL VIEW 
In the preceding chapters we have presented an evolutionary scenario 
that shows how language, along with our higher cognitive and social ca­
pacities, could have emerged through the interaction of biological and 
cultural processes over millions of years. As we have seen, the advances 
taking place in emotional signaling were building over the millennia 
through the consolidation and extension of caregiving practices. These 
signaling systems employ not only gestures and movements but also 
vocalizations, body movements, and facial expressions of emotion 
The Origins of Language 
1 89 
which, judging from the increasing complexity of hominids' facial mus­
culature over the millennia, played a critical role in co-regulated emo­
tional signaling. Moreover, just as complex as facial expressions are the 
intonations we can make with the voice, enabling us to produce a range 
of different sounds that can convey endless varieties of intent. 
This gradual improvement in the range and complexity of signaling 
led to a confluence of events. In Chapter 1, we discussed how emotional 
signaling enabled the formation and manipulation of symbols: a key in­
gredient for the complexity and abstract use of language. But using 
symbols for thinking can occur through pictorial representations and 
complex gestures. Language as we ordinarily think about it also involves 
speech and rapid interactive abstract communication. To look at how 
full language as we know it evolved and developed, we need to look at 
how other factors came together with symbol formation to create this 
wondrous human ability. 
As interactive vocalizations, facial expressions, and other means of 
emotional signaling improved, the abilities to plan, to attend to salient 
information and inhibit nonsalient information, and to execute motor 
actions all improved. We see the full significance of this point when we 
compare children who are developing typically with those who struggle 
with various biological challenges. As children develop, they usually be­
gin to use more detailed facial expressions and to use their arms, hands, 
and fingers in a more purposeful manner, for example, to point out 
things when they're walking, or to lead you places and show you what 
they want. It is these advances in emotional signaling that lead to the 
improvements that we see in attention, planning, and motor sequences. 
When because of some biological challenge children do not develop the 
capacity to enter into these sorts of long co-regulated interactions, we 
do not see these other systems developing. Thus it is the emotional sig­
naling that drives these other systems to develop. And so, too, with our 
hominid ancestors: The parts of their brains as well as the musculature 
responsible for vocalization and facial expression of emotions were al­
tered and enhanced as their signaling capacities advanced, and other 
parts of the brain-the parts of the prefrontal cortex that enable us to 
develop our executive functions-likewise began to develop. 
How did language emerge from this process? To answer this question, 
we need to look at how, in early infancy, emotional signaling occurs 
through touching, holding, smelling, and rhythmic rocking. As the sig­
naling becomes more complicated and children begin to enter into 

1 90 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
co-regulated emotional interactions with a caregiver, they start to 
achieve the same sense of closeness and feelings of nurturing thtough 
distal communication, such as vocalizing across space or reading each 
other's facial expressions, body posture, and movements. In other words, 
through a still preverbal dialogue, the need for dependency and nurtur­
ing closeness can now be achieved in a new way.4 As Harlow and Suomi 
showed us in monkeys,5 or Savage-Rumbaugh and King in great apes,6 
or Spitz and Bowlby in humans,7 this need for dependency and nurtur­
ing closeness is one of the most basic of all needs of higher primates. 
Once this basic nurturing can be satisfied across larger spatial ter­
rains, the child starts to develop the ability to communicate her desires 
and intentions, and to engage in communication for its own sake. This 
pleasurable aspect of distal communication frees vocal patterns from 
their use of meeting basic needs, such as the needs for food and protec­
tion. Just as emotional interactions enable the separation of perception 
from action, now they enable the formation of symbols that are freed 
from concrete utilitarian functions and can be used for showing things 
to others, sharing observations, communicating ideas and insights, and 
gossiping. This more advanced use of symbols has its roots in the plea­
sure and security provided by basic nurturing social interactions. 
In summary, a confluence of events enabled language (as well as 
speech; see later in this chapter) to form. All these events had common 
roots in the complex co-regulated emotional signaling as described in 
Chapter 1. These critical language-forming events include the improved 
motor skills needed to produce more complex and subtle facial expres­
sions, gestures, and vocalizations; symbol formation itself; complex 
problem-solving and group behavior; and the evolving ability to use 
communication as a vehicle for closeness and dependency (pleasure in 
communication in its own right, not tied to meeting basic needs). Once 
these were met, the opportunity arose for more interesting and creative 
communications. As we showed in Chapters 3 to 6, we can trace this 
chain of events over millions of years through the fossil record of differ­
ent epochs in our prehistory, as well as in observations of nonhuman 
primates today. We demonstrated how each stage of fie development 
corresponded to observable epochs in the evolution of our human ca­
pacities. This process didn't stop with the early forms of speech and lan­
guage but advanced, and in all likelihood is continuing to advance, to 
higher and higher levels of reflective thinking. 
The Origins of Language 
1 91 
This developmental model of language represents a striking departure 
from one of the main themes in Western views about the origins and de­
velopment of language, namely, the idea that language is a form of tele­
mentational system.8 The telementational view of language, which dates 
back to Descartes, is the idea that language is a rule-governed system for 
transmitting ideas from one mind to another; in the modern version of 
this view, a system for encoding and decoding thoughts. What is so striking 
about this view of language, apart from its failure to acknowledge the 
role of language in the day-to-day affairs of human beings,9 is that it ex­
cludes any consideration of the role of emotion in the origins-or devel­
opment!-of language skills. Rather, language is treated as a mechanical 
process for transmitting thoughts, which is the reason we see modern 
theorists likening linguistic communication to two computers, or even 
two faxes, "communicating" with each other. 1 0  
Closely connected to this point is the bias towards competence in 
theories about the origins of language-that is, the focus on what adult 
speakers know and do when they speak a language. With this as one's 
starting point, it is no wonder that so many contemporary theorists are 
drawn to genetic explanations to account for how adults could possibly 
have acquired this ability. For just as emotion is absent from this sce­
nario, so is development. 
Our theory of the origins of language addresses both these omis­
sions. Advances in emotional signaling were culturally transmitted 
from one generation to the next, each generation learning from the pre­
vious one through infant/caregiver interactions how to convey emo­
tions, ideas, and intentions, and thence, how to master preverbal and 
ultimately verbal systems of communication. Such striking phenomena 
as the development of the representational skills manifest in the cave art 
drawings, or the technological advances seen in the rise of agriculture 
and civilizations, were not the result of a genetic mutation but rather 
were developed through a series of gradual increments in complex emo­
tional gesturing leading to representational thinking. 
THE CONTINUITY/DISCONTINUITY DEBATE 
Since the 1990s, there has been an explosion of articles and books on 
the origins of language. 1 1 This literature has seen the emergence of a 

1 92 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
debate between two opposing camps: the so-called discontinuity and 
continuity theories. The former maintains that language must have 
evolved relatively quickly sometime during the Pleistocene as the result 
of a monster genetic mutation, or a fortuitous series of genetic muta­
tions,12 whereas the latter insists that language must have evolved very 
slowly, over millions of years, as the result of behavioral modifications in 
response to changing environmental contingencies.13 The debate be­
tween these two theories has reached an impasse, neither side willing to 
embrace the opposite's view of language itself, much less of the forces 
that brought about the emergence of language. Our approach intro­
duces a new dimension into this debate in a manner that enables the 
continuity approach to address some of the most pressing concerns 
raised by the discontinuity theorists. 
There are several reasons why this debate over the origins of language 
has received so much attention. One is simply because the "generativist"14 
school of linguistics founded by Chomsky seized on this issue as a way of . 
supporting the discontinuity view that a child acquires language automat­
ically sometime between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four months as a 
result of genetically controlled factors.15 Another reason is because the 
large contingency of discontinuity theorists, known as "nativists," who re­
gard our species-typical abilities as innate, saw in Chomsky's Big Bang 
hypothesis a paradigm for the genotypic view of evolution. That is, if lan­
guage, long regarded as the quintessential higher human capacity, was the 
result of natural selection, it seemed that much more compelling to argue 
that less complex human capacities could also be construed as the result of 
genetic mutations in our recent evolutionary past.16 
On a deeper level, the generativist view of the origins of language 
tapped into the resurgence of mechanist thinking that took place during 
the middle of the twentieth century as a result of the birth of Artificial In­
telligence. The so-called postcomputational mechanist revolution prom­
ised to disclose the hidden operations of the mind by mapping mental 
processes onto computer programs. I? This new model of the cognitive 
unconscious-heuristic algorithms said to be embodied in the brain­
represented a strong reaction against the Freudian view of the uncon­
scious; for AI promised to replace Freud's vision of a powerful and 
mysterious force underlying human behavior with a computational 
model of neurological processes that lie "beneath the threshold of con­
sciousness."IB That is, in place of the challenging task of grappling with 
unconscious motives, wishes, desires, and intentions, scientists could ana-
The Origins of Language 
1 93 
lyze the operations of genetically selected "programs of the brain."19 
Hence, the computational revolution would bring the science of the 
mind into line with other biological sciences in terms of things that can 
be objectively measured and concretized.20 
The generativist explanation is said to resolve the question of why 
human knowledge, technology, and society have made such extraordi­
nary advances over the past 20,000 years, whereas apes have remained 
in the same state for millions of years. Because of a sudden genetic mu­
tation, Homo sapiens sapiens migrated around the globe rapidly and sub­
jugated the Neanderthals, who, on this line of argument, were no match 
for this new breed of humans because they could communicate only 
nonlinguistically. Some of the other factors cited to support this idea 
that language must have appeared quite suddenly, sometime between 
200,000 and 40,000 years ago, are marked innovations in tool use and 
the appearance of representational artifacts (we examined these in 
Chapter 6), and the existence of categorical perception and the descent 
of the larynx, which we will look at in greater detail in the following sec­
tion. But most important of all is the argument that, given its complex­
ity (syntactic, morphological), its capacity to refer to abstract ideas and 
to spatio-temporal distal events, and its creativity, language differs cate­
gorically from all nonhuman primate communication systems. 
Using an analysis of the "design features oflanguage,"21 however, con­
tinuity theorists argued that primatologists have discovered evidence of 
several key elements of human language in nonhuman primate commu­
nication.22 Moreover, a great deal of primatological research refutes the 
discontinuity argument that monkeys and apes live in the immediate 
present and can respond only to immediate stimuli, or that they have no 
control over memory of events and are unable to weigh alternatives, 
make predictions, or plan for the future.23 The big problem for continu­
ity theory, however, remains the discontinuity objection that there is a 
fundamental distinction between language and "purely functional and 
stimulus-bound animal communication systems." This distinction is said 
to lie in the fact that "language, being free from control by identifiable 
external stimuli or internal physiological states, can serve as a general in­
strument of thought and self-expression rather than merely as a commu­
nicative device of report, request, or command."24 Hence, primate 
research cannot shed light on the origins of language because no matter 
how subtle and advanced these gestural/vocalization systems might be or 
become, they cannot be compared to the complexity and creativity of the 

1 94 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
language system. And it is precisely here where our theory of the devel­
opment of language steps in. 
A NEW THEORY OF 
LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 
We saw in Chapter 4 how early humans were learning, through amusing 
facial expressions, animated vocalizations, and rhythmic movements, to 
extend the brief encounters that characterize the early stages of develop­
ment into longer and more complex exchanges. That is, they were learn­
ing how to create all sorts of opportunities to communicate: through 
structured routines, in which familiarity would have been combined 
with novelty; through highly responsive and modulated behaviors; and 
through action-response games that would capture children's attention 
and help develop all their senses. No doubt peek-a-boo, or some variant 
on this simplest of games, has an incredibly long ancestry. Early humans 
would have been developing the "formats" that Bruner · describes, in 
which a caregiver and child engage together in a task, such as "peek-a­
boo," getting dressed, bathing, or playing with toys,25 
Formats, according to Bruner, are a means of entering language and 
culture simultaneously; indeed, the two cannot be meaningfully sepa­
rated. They are simple game-like microcosmic versions of the everyday 
means by which competent members of a culture cooperate in integrating 
their vocalizations and actions for the purpose of achieving some shared 
goal. But the formats of childhood are not always so purposive. Some for­
mats may have a particular purpose, such as bathing or dressing, but 
many formats are performed simply to amuse a child, or to occupy him, 
or just for the fun of it. Formats, for Bruner, serve as the nursery for lan­
guage/cultural development. Formats are crucially adaptable to the child's 
developing skills; indeed, this adaptability is exploited by the caregiver as 
she encourages the child, step-by-step, to try more sophisticated commu­
nicational means of participating in their interactions. 
To engage in these formats, early humans had to learn how to read 
their infants' signals; for as Lev Vygotsky said, the caregiver may be the 
more experienced partner in these interactions, but the infant plays just 
as important a role in setting the tone and rhythm of the interactions. 
Hence, the caregiver is the one who "raises the bar," but only to the ex­
tent that the infant is ready to have it raised. Moreover, not only did 
The Origins of Language 
1 95 
caregivers have to learn how to read their child's physical state, they also 
had to learn how to read his burgeoning emotions, intentions, and de­
sires. One of the most important consequences of a child's developing 
communicative abilities is the effect this has on the emotions he is capa­
ble of experiencing and expressing, and the impact this has on his cog­
nitive development. But then, caregivers had to learn how to respond to 
these new and different emotions. 
Long before hominids had begun to speak, therefore, they would 
have been acquiring the communicative skills required to engage in 
these sorts of proto-conversations with their infants. Bateson26 and Tre­
varthan27 coined the term "proto-conversation" to refer to the early 
stages of dyadic interaction. They had in mind the idea that the mem­
bers of a dyad are involved from the beginning in shared gaze and vocal­
ization dialogues that maximize the optimal levels of arousal for the 
infant and minimize the infant's negative affects. Since the early 1970s, 
careful study has shown that language acquisition occurs through this 
prolonged process of preverbal communication that takes place in the 
first eighteen months of a baby's life.28 Typically, a child's language de­
velopment surges from eighteen to twenty-four months, an event no 
doubt tied to the maturation of prefrontal cortical structures. But this 
surge invariably occurs when the child reaches the fifth stage of func­
tional emotional development, made possible by the child's having pro­
gressed through the preceding four stages. And the essence of this 
progression is that it is a dynamic, social process and not an endogenous, 
maturational phenomenon. 
Interestingly, a similar surge can be seen in the early language re­
search conducted by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh with the chimpanzees Sher­
man and Austin. Sherman and Austin suddenly began to acquire 
symbolic skills after years of very little progress when Savage-Rumbaugh 
shifted from a behavioral modification program and began instead to 
use lexigrams in the ordinary day-to-day activities that engaged the 
chimps' attention and interest. The more Sherman and Austin were able 
to engage in long chains of co-regulated affective gesturing, the more 
advanced became their receptive and productive skills.29 One of us 
(S.I.G.) has observed a similar phenomenon countless times, using very 
similar techniques, in work with young children who have severe lan­
guage deficits,3O 
As far as concerns the origins of language, what we would argue here 
is that, whereas a baby needs from eighteen to twenty-four months of 

1 96 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
affective gesturing to reach the point of being able to speak in sen­
tences, prehistoric humans needed 2 million years to reach this point. 
The advances taking place in their affective signaling were continuously 
building over the millennia through the consolidation and extension of 
caregiving practices. These affect signaling systems employ not only 
hand gestures but vocalizations, body posture, and numerous subtle fa­
cial expressions, and offer an almost infinite variety of subtle commu­
nicative possibilities. Consider, for example, how many different facial 
expressions can convey the various degrees of pleasure, delight, scintil­
lation, and amazement. And each one of these seemingly discrete af­
fects has different textures and tones to it. Equally as complex as facial 
expressions are the intonations that can be made with different sounds 
that also convey an infinite variety of affective intent}! 
Herein lies the source of the linguistic creativity that Chomsky 
sought to account for in mechanist terms. That is, linguistic creativity 
arises not from some sort of generative mechanism but rather from the 
continuous flow of back-and-forth emotional signaling that provides a 
constant source of new affects or emotions to stir the next sequence of 
ideas or words. As we saw in Chapter 4, the preverbal gestural problem­
solving interactions create the context for mastering meaningful verbal 
symbols. Without this basic level of knowing through doing, words may 
be used instrumentally, but they have no other intrinsic meaning for the 
user. We often see this phenomenon in children with a severe language 
deficit who have undergone intensive behavioral therapy. Through con­
stant repetition and operant conditioning, they can be brought to use a 
large number of words to obtain certain goals; but they have a great deal 
of trouble generalizing the use of these words to novel circumstances, let 
alone combining them with other words in creative utterances. 
Co-regulated, emotional interactions are thus essential for many as­
pects of language development. The more emotionally charged their in­
teractions, the more motivated children become to master language 
skills. The more they develop these skills-and children vary consider­
ably in pace32-the more meaningful and socially appropriate their 
language becomes. Grammar development, including the alignment 
of verbs and nouns, also appears to depend upon the presence of spe­
cific experiences. But just like phonological or pragmatic skills, these 
specific experiences also grow from emotional interactions: Emotion 
fuels planning and sequencing abilities, and is eventually invested in 
words. For as the child's feelings become more complex, he searches for 
The Origins of Language 
1 97 
more complex ways to express those feelings. To be sure, this is very 
much a symbiotic process; language development itself comes to play a 
role in the child's emotional development. But the critical point here is 
simply how critically involved the child's emotional development is in 
her development of grammar. Thus, the thirty-month-old sharing his 
observations about the world isn't simply imparting information; he is 
articulating-and indeed, starting to work out-what he feels about 
people, places, and objects. 
One reason generativists missed this point was simply because, in most 
families, the kind of interactions we are talking about occur ordinarily 
and routinely. Unless one is looking for them, they are easily overlooked. 
It was by studying children suffering from language problems, autism, 
and deprivation syndromes (children from orphanages or multi risk fami­
lies) that we were able to see what happens when these processes are miss­
ing, either for biological reasons (as in autism) or for environmental 
reasons (when a family or institutional caregivers cannot supply them). 
For virtually all children who develop language problems, a biological or 
social factor is preventing them from undergoing the sorts of specific ex­
periences that need to be present for language-learning to occur. 
The same point applies to the complexity of language. Discontinuity 
theorists were deeply impressed by the young child's ability to process 
complex auditory and visual cues in the early stages of language acquisi­
tion. They were unaware-for good reason, as we are only just starting 
to understand these mechanisms-that there's a developmental process 
or pathway that enables the growing baby to process more and more 
complex perceptions, including sounds and sights. This developmental 
process involves the gradual perception of emotional variation in sounds 
and also in facial expressions and body movements, gestures, and the 
growing ability to enter into reciprocal interactions around these vocal 
and visual emotional signals. Eventually, this leads to ever more refined 
differentiation of perception and thence the use of words. 
As we argued in the early chapters, emotional signaling brings to­
gether the different processing domains-including auditory and 
visual-spatial, as well as olfactory, tactile, and proprioceptive-and en­
ables them to function as an integrated whole, as well as to become dif­
ferentiated, which builds to higher and higher levels of complexity. The 
levels described in Chapter 2 characterize these progressively higher lev­
els of perceptual integration that occur during emotional interactions. 
Part of the reason why it is so difficult to envision differentiation in 

1 98 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
human perception is because it occurs in almost infinite amounts, every 
split second of every waking moment every day of the growing baby's 
life. This process is so rapid and so ongoing that it's easy to take it for 
granted and notice it only when it reaches certain critical milestones or 
when it's been derailed. 
What biology brings to the table is not this whole interactive dy­
namic process of emotional and perceptual differentiation but a nervous 
system that is capable of being differentiated. In other words, the poten­
tial for perceptual differentiation is embedded in genetically mediated 
neurological structures, but these dynamic interactions we have been 
describing between caregivers and their infants are necessary for this 
learning process to take place. Furthermore, as the infant and caregiver 
are involved in these emotional interactions, this leads to new neurolog­
ical pathways being laid, as well as new skills that in turn support higher 
levels of differentiation and integration.33 
For example, the ability to master the first few words, which we de­
scribed in Chapter I, creates the opportunity for new levels of differenti­
ation and integration, that is, new tools of learning. But, as we showed, 
this capacity for symbol formation was itself the result of earlier emo­
tional interactions. Without this complex interactive process, no amount 
of neurological development would, in and of itself, create the ability to 
master the use of meaningful symbols. Rather, in circumstances where 
these interactions are missing, we tend to see patterns very similar to 
what we observe in many autistic children: limited sounds are tied to ac­
tions or are used repetitively or perseveratively rather than meaningfully. 
Therefore, our genes are part of a biological complex that in the appro­
priate social and physical context confers on us an initial capacity to 
learn and provides a neurological substrate for subsequent learning if, 
and only if, certain emotional experiences take place in a sequence that 
has evolved over millions of years. 
THE F UNCTIONAL/EMOTIONAL 
O RIGINS OF SPEECH 
So far we have talked about language in quite general terms; in this sec­
tion we will take a closer look at speech, because speech has been even 
harder to explain than language in general. For hundreds of years, the 
tide of this section would have been interpreted as a statement about 
The Origins of Language 
1 99 
the origins of language. Thanks to Armstrong, Stokoe, and Wilcox's 
Gesture and the Nature of Language, 34 few would make such an assump­
tion today; for speech, it is now widely recognized, is just one modality 
of language, possibly a later form of language that was made possible 
only by earlier, gestural forms,35 But that still leaves us with the major 
question of why humans began to speak and what significance this has 
for the evolution of the human mind; and intimately connected with 
these evolutionary questions, why children begin to speak and what sig­
nificance this has for the development of their minds. 
The first systematic response to these questions, mentioned earlier in 
this chapter, was articulated by the Abbe de Condillac in his Essai sur 
l'origine des connaissances humaines.36 Condillac argued that the evolu­
tion of the human mind and the growth of knowledge depended on the 
invention (Condillac's term) of language/speech. (Like all eighteenth­
century philosophers, Condillac treated these terms as interchangeable.) 
Speech, Condillac argued, isn't just a tool for the communication of 
ideas: Without speech, thinking as we know it would not have been 
possible. Therefore, to understand the origins of thought, we need to 
understand why and how humans started to speak. 
Why did Condillac, and eighteenth-century thinkers in general, 
place so much emphasis on speech? Why were they so convinced that 
"without speech no reason, without reason no speech" ? In large part, the 
reason was because the philosophes believed that gestures are a residue 
of our primitive linguistic origins and as such play only a tangential 
communicative role in spoken languages (e.g., to convey emotion). The 
reason why speech was accorded such preeminence in eighteenth­
century thought was because of the view that speech, unlike gestures, 
enables human beings to acquire voluntary control over the ideas cours-
ing through their minds. 
The philosophes believed that the so-called natural language of ges-
tures could be used to communicate thoughts but that such an iconic 
system was severely limited both in its capacity to represent abstractions 
and in the speed with which one could convey what one was thinking. 
The transition from this natural gestural language to speech was thus con­
sidered to be of the utmost importance for the emergence of the mod­
ern mind on the grounds that one can speak nearly as quickly as one can 
think as well as convey far more abstract concepts than is possible in 
(what they conceived of as) a purely mimetic system; and still more im­
portant, because they thought that speech, unlike the natural language

of gesture, forces one to analyze one's mental processes: to break com­
plex thoughts down into their component parts, which can then be 
named, recognized, recalled, reflected on, recombined, and expressed in 
novel ways.37 
Thus Condillac argued that "a man who has only accidental and nat­
ural signs, has none at all at his command . . . .  Hence we may conclude 
that brutes have no memory; and that they have only an imagination 
which they cannot command as they please."38 In other words, without 
speech, humans, like animals, were thought to be incapable of analyzing 
and ordering their ideas, incapable of summoning up ideas at will and 
hence recombining ideas to form new thoughts or recall past events. In­
deed, it was thought that, since they lacked speech, the deaf do not pos­
sess free will.39 Apparent counter-instances in which deaf adults, or, for 
that matter, animals, behaved in what appeared to be an intentional 
manner were explained away as instincts or the association of ideas. 
Condillac concluded that the mind of prelinguistic humans, like that 
of animals, was governed by involuntary, mechanical associations. But 
this created a formidable problem: Given that the essence of speech/ 
language was said to be that it is a voluntary creation, how was it that 
the primitive human mind was able to make the transition from natural 
language-the language of gestures, body movements, and facial expres­
sions-to the voluntary use of signs to refer to ideas? If language were 
an invention, didn't this require an act of free will? And if it is only 
speech that gives us free will, how were nonlinguistic humans able to 
take that first momentous step and invent language? 
The philosophes felt that, although science could only speculate about 
how the transition from involuntary to voluntary behavior might have 
occurred in the distant mists of early history (compare Rousseau's Second 
Discourse), it could more reasonably answer this question by observing 
closely how an infant makes exactly the same transition. For everything 
that has been said here about the lack of free will in animals and prelin­
guistic humans must apply to infants, because, as the very word "infant" 
betokens, they too lack speech. The infant's transition from cries and ges­
tures to verbal interaction was thought to mirror primitive humans' tran­
sition from natural language to speech. The philosophes thought that 
children first create meaningless sounds that their parents imitate, and 
then invent words that the parents incorporate into their own speech;40 
but because children learning how to speak are subject to the same sorts 
of social coercion as everyone else, they soon abandon their idiosyncratic 
The Origins of Language 
201 
words and increasingly conform to the verbal behavior of their society. 
What they never could explain, however, was how it was that society it­
self was able to acquire language. 
It is striking to see how little science has been able to add to this basic 
story over the past three centuries. To be sure, paleoanthropologists 
have come up with various reasons as to why speech may have come to 
supplant the older, gestural system; for example, speech, it is argued, 
freed up the hands and allowed humans to carry on other activities 
while communicating, such as hunting or cooking or making tools and 
clothes. Or to communicate over longer distances in impenetrable situ­
ations, such as the forest. Or to communicate at night.41 But whatever 
the precise reason, it has seemed clear to many that speech must have 
been genetically selected sometime between 1 00,000 and 40,000 years 
ago (see also the discussion of the descent of the larynx in Chapter 5). 
For how else can we explain how humans acquired the ability to speak? 
The fact that speech must have been genetically selected and came to 
supplant gesture is said to be reflected in the maturational timetable 
that just about every child goes through: the cooing beginning around 
the age of three months, babbling at around seven months, and first 
word around the age of twelve months.42 
Part of the problem with this argument is that it completely ignores the 
sociality involved in speech; that is, it treats the biological factors that un­
derpin the ability to speak as canalized, or somehow isolated from the 
social factors that are intimately, and indeed, inextricably bound up 
with a child's development of speech. After all, while children are going 
through these stages of vocal development, they are simultaneously 
going through important stages of gestural development: From six to nine 
months, a child will start to shake his head to indicate no; around nine 
months, start to gesture to request things; and by twelve months, inten­
tionally point at things. One cannot talk about the reasons children start 
to favor speech over gesture without considering the enormous influence 
of motherese on the child's linguistic development.43 And as we can see 
from Ellen Groce's fascinating book, Everybody Here Spoke Sign Language, 
a history of the sign/spoken English bilingual community that existed for 
such a long time on Martha's Vineyard (because of the unusually large 
number of deaf in the community), social conditions can render commu­
nicating by sign just as natural as communicating by speech.44 
At still a deeper level, however, the problem with the genetic determin­
ist explanation of the evolution and ontogeny of speech is that it rests on 

202 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
a tautology; for ultimately the evidence that speech must have been ge­
netically selected is simply that virtually every child speaks. But the inter­
esting question is why speech should have been so favored, and why it 
continues to be. Is there something about the activity of speaking that 
may explain its universality? Before one thinks about the origins of 
speech, however, one needs first to understand the evolutionary forces 
that brought about a vocal system that was sufficiently complex and 
finely regulated to support speech. The initial question that needs to be 
addressed, therefore, is why a more complex vocal system would have 
conferred an evolutionary advantage. Not only does our hypothesis about 
the role of emotional signaling in the human evolutionary trajectory en­
able us to understand the evolutionary advantages of a more subtly nu­
anced vocal system, but further, it shows how these same caregiving 
practices would have played a critical role in the subsequent evolution 
of speech. 
Once again, it is useful to start by considering the ontogeny of speech 
in a young child. As we saw above, children typically start to speak 
around the time of their first birthday: first in single words, and then, a 
few months later, in two-word combinations. During the ensuing lan­
guage explosion, they master as many as ten new words every day. This 
can be a constant source of wonderment and amusement as they begin 
using some word that their parents can barely remember uttering. From 
this point on, their language abilities seem to explode and, generally by 
the age of twenty-four months, they are beginning to speak in sentences. 
The tendency to view the child's development of speech in genetic 
terms is certainly understandable, therefore, given the regularity with 
which so many children progress through these milestones. But to begin 
mastering the use of spoken words, children must go through a great 
deal of development before and during their progression through the 
milestones. We are not simply referring to his advances in the gestural 
and receptive skills that, as many theorists have noted, provide the sub­
stratum for the child's subsequent ability to speak.45 Rather, we are re­
ferring here to the child's developing ability to separate perception from 
action. For, as we saw in Chapter 2, mastering symbols and the capacity 
to think require that the child move beyond fixed perceptual motor pat­
terns in which a stimulus evokes a response. By separating the percep­
tion from the action, the child can develop a "freestanding" perception 
or image that can become associated with experiences and form the ba­
sis for later use of symbols. As we have pointed out, this capacity to sep-
The Origins of Language 
203 
arate perception from action oCCuts only as a result of engaging in emo­
tional signaling with caregivers. Only when infants can use emotional 
signals to communicate and negotiate are they no longer at the mercy of 
fixed perceptual motor patterns. More important, they are also no 
longer at the mercy of "catastrophic" emotions, such as rage, fear, or 
overwhelming neediness, which tend to lead to fixed reaction patterns. 
Children cannot begin to speak, however, until they are capable of 
controlling the vocal system, which occurs only when they are capable 
of engaging in long chains of co-regulated emotional signaling involving 
all communicative modalities (the vocal system, facial expressions, ges­
tures, body movements). Out hypothesis is that our hominid ancestors 
had to go through the same stages of development to attain the same 
mastery over the vocal system before they could begin to speak. Thus, 
rather than viewing speech as evolving-suddenly or otherwise-as an 
alternative to the gestural system of linguistic communication, we need 
to consider the reasons why the vocal system developed alongside the 
gestural system, indeed, as an integral part of it, and eventually came to 
serve as the primary mode in linguistic communication. That is, we 
need to understand the factors that promoted not simply the transition 
from nonverbal to spoken language but more fundamentally the capac­
ity of nonhuman primates, the Australopithecines, and early humans to 
produce and discern an ever wider and more modulated range of 
sounds. What were the factors promoting the advancement of vocalizing 
to the point where it became complex enough to support a transition 
from nonverbal to spoken language? 
The first point that we need to bear in mind here is simply that the 
voice introduced a critical added dimension to emotional signaling. The 
more complex emotional interactions became, the more nonhuman pri­
mates and early hominids needed to augment their existing communi­
cation modes. A more subtly nuanced vocal system would have been 
recruited as part of this dynamic, and would have conferred a further 
evolutionary advantage as a natural consequence of the growing com­
plexity of the communication it made possible. When we look at bono­
bos, for example, we can easily see how their vocalizing is every bit as 
important an element in their emotional signaling as their gestures, fa­
cial expressions, and body movements. To be sure, we are a long way off 
from understanding the intricacies of their vocal exchanges. Yet one 
thing that is clear is how vocalizing allows for many more signals to be 
exchanged, and in wider circumstances, thereby enhancing the capacity 

204 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
of the group's members to negotiate relationships of power and submis­
sion, to tame catastrophic emotions and aggression, to deal with safety 
and threats, and, of course, to build stronger bonds of intimacy and 
group cohesion. Another thing that seems evident when observing 
bonobos is that they experience great pleasure in the very act of vocaliz­
ing. This is an important point, for any theory of the evolution of 
speech should proceed from the idea, mentioned earlier, that the very 
act of speaking is pleasurable: not only for the speaker, but for the re­
ceiver as well. The staggering success of the telecom industry is an indi­
cation of just how much we love to speak. 
The hedonic principle operating here, it would appear, is that the more 
differentiated the emotions and the more subtle the variations, the greater 
the pleasure one experiences in communicating these variations through 
vocalizations and other gestures. And the vocal system does indeed enable 
one to convey different and more subtle qualities of emotion than the 
purely visual system. Through the voice we can convey infinite variations 
in warmth and closeness, distance and anger, curiosity and disinterest. If 
you watch a silent movie you certainly feel some warmth, but it is not 
nearly the same as hearing the actors' voices. Or consider those telephone 
ads showing families separated for the holidays, or grandparents separated 
from their grandchildren: The "characters" are able to experience great 
feelings of closeness solely with their voices. These ads wouldn't be nearly 
as effective if the vocal system were not such a rich source of emotional 
signaling, such a powerful means of conveying warmth and intimacy. 
Thus, to understand the processes that are at work here, we need to 
situate the evolution of the vocal system in the context of the reciprocal 
emotional gesturing that had been developing for millions of years. As 
the ability to engage in interactive problem solving advanced, hominids 
became increasingly capable of taming catastrophic affects (see Chapter 
1) based on flight-fight and similar reactions, which are governed by rel­
atively more primitive parts of the brain. 
Significantly, some of the same neurological structures and pathways 
that are involved in emotional signaling also regulate the facial muscles, 
the muscles of the inner ear, and the pharynx and larynx (the throat and 
the voice box). The importance of this point cannot be overlooked, for 
it would appear that Mother Nature was operating with her usual zest 
for efficiency. Of the many neurological structures and pathways in­
volved in these complex processes, one that has been particularly well 
studied is the vagus nerve. It has been shown that the myelinated com-
The Origins of Language 
205 
ponents of the vagus (evolutionarily more advanced components than 
the unmyelinated component of the vagus, which deals with vegetative 
functions) regulate or control the facial muscles, the inner ear, and the 
pharynx and larynx. Furthermore, one of us (S.I.G.) collaborated in re­
search that showed the same pathway is involved in the interactive regu­
lation ofbehavior.46 It would thus appear that this important pathway is 
simultaneously influencing parts of the nervous system that have to do 
with the part of the middle ear used to decipher and discriminate 
sounds, the organs required for producing sounds, and the muscles used 
for facial expressions. 
If emotional interaction fostered the development of these neurologi­
cal pathways, it would simultaneously foster the ability of hominids 
to discriminate sounds (regulating the muscles of the middle ear) and to 
create sounds through new nerve pathways regulating the pharynx and 
larynx. Thus, what may have happened is that co-regulated emotional 
signaling fostered the ability of hom in ids to communicate in a variety of 
ways, ranging from facial expressions, with all the complexities inherent 
in that, to the greater and greater use of vocalizations from the receptive 
and expressive perspectives. In other words, a range of communicative 
systems may have been promoted efficiently by just a few pathways. 
That these pathways tend to regulate several of these interrelated sys­
tems also lends support to our hypothesis on the central importance of 
co-regulated emotional signaling for symbol formation, language, and 
intelligence. Here we have evidence that the same types of interaction 
that in all likelihood made symbol formation possible also enhanced the 
likelihood of more complex facial signaling, more finely nuanced vocal­
izations, and the development of spoken language. 
By no means do we wish to minimize the importance of the instru­
mental arguments that others have emphasized for the transition from 
gestural to spoken language (see above). Freeing the hands for other ac­
tivities would indeed have bestowed a considerable advantage for the 
SOrts of manual activities that paleo anthropologists have envisaged. By 
the same token, once we consider the importance of the hands for emo­
tional signaling, we can see how these same manual activities would 
have put further pressure on the vocal system to develop; for if the 
hands were occupied and one was staring at the task at hand, the vocal 
system not only would have had to take over basic communication but 
also would have had to pick up for the finer textures and nuances that 
would have been supplied by gestures and facial expressions.

S PEECH AS AN EXPRESSION 
OF NURTURANCE 
Initially, humans vocalized to convey hunger, anger, fear. How was vo­
calizing elevated beyond communicating basic needs to the pleasure of 
gossiping, relating some interesting discovery, or sharing one's amuse­
ment at something funny? In the development of each baby and child, 
we have observed that this transition occurs when the toddler discovers 
that vocalizations and/or words can be as much a source of closeness 
and shared pleasure as a warm hug. Toddlers begin experiencing greater 
closeness and the meeting of their basic needs for closeness and nurtu­
rance through the act of vocalizing itself 
In other words, in healthy human development, the need for nurtu­
rance is as basic as the need for food, but it is it basic need that comes to 
be filled in an ever more differentiated manner. The baby moves from 
hugs and caresses to shared vocalizations and communication through 
emotional signaling as a way of satisfying this fundamental need for 
nurturance. It is remarkable how, as adults, humans can feel the same 
nurturing warmth over the telephone with people thousands of miles 
away simply by hearing the warmth in their voices and basking in the 
meaning of their words. We've often wondered, also, whether the un­
derlying satisfaction for seemingly dull small talk isn't at least in part 
that it provides an excuse to hear each other's sounds, words, and simply 
to operate together as a group. In this way, a group may come to pro­
vide aspects of the nurturing that was originally provided in a more con­
crete way by caregivers. 
Another way to look at this point is that the critical feature in human 
evolution was-and is-the importance of nurturance as a basic need 
that is as pressing in many respects as the needs for food and protection. 
But the basic need for nurturance can undergo many developmental 
transformations towards higher and higher forms of expression, negoti­
ation, and satisfaction. In fact, the transformations we have described in 
co-regulated emotional interactions (the sixteen stages described in 
Chapter 2) can be viewed as transformations in the way we nurture one 
another. We appear to try to nurture each other at all the levels at the 
same time, up to the highest levels of which we are capable. 
The question we are left with, then, is this: Why did early humans 
make the important transition from using communication to satisfy ba­
sic needs to valuing communication for its own sake? It would be reason-
The Origins of Language 
207 
able to hypothesize that here, too, as emotional signaling enabled basic 
nurturing interactions to be more and more finely negotiated between 
adults, and between infants and adults, communication itself progressed 
beyond simple nurturing satisfaction. At that point, humans began to 
love speaking for its own sake. Gossiping and chatting, even arguing, can 
all be understood as providing different means of nurturance. 
In addition, there are all sorts of social conditions that would have 
enabled more opportunities for such forms of communication; for ex­
ample, when the members of a group spend large amounts of time to­
gether engaged in joint cooperative tasks, the opportunity is provided 
for such an advance to take place. And perhaps the anatomical changes 
in the vocal tract that occurred sometime between 100,000 and 40,000 
years ago (see Chapter 5) are closely associated with these changes. As 
we said earlier, such a phenomenon would hardly have been the result 
of a random genetic mutation that miraculously and fortuitously en­
abled modern humans to begin speaking. Rather, as emotional signaling 
was progressing, it was fostering pleasure in vocalization for its own 
sake. This, too, could have fostered favorable changes in the nervous 
system for more finely regulated motor control as well as the changes in 
the larynx, pharynx, and middle ear discussed earlier. What we are pro­
posing, therefore, is that co-regulated emotional signaling fostered the 
development of a dynamic system that came together and created a ba­
sis not only for language but also for speaking.

The Role of Emotions in 
Language Development 
T
H E  TELEMENTAT I ONAL VIEW OF language, dating back to Des­
cartes, as an abstract system for transmitting thoughts from the 
mind of one speaker to another (see Chapter 7) led, in the twentieth 
century, to different mechanistic views about how a child's brain must 
be programmed, either by experience or by genes, to process speech "in­
put." Conspicuously missing in all these accounts is the role of emotion 
in the development of language. The explanation for this lacuna also 
likely goes back to Descartes, who assumed that language and the emo­
tions are housed in different parts of the brain. Thus, emotional factors 
may impinge on language but have no intrinsic role in its development. 
In generation after generation over the past three centuries we see 
philosophers, linguists, and psychologists basing their theories of lan­
guage development on this fundamental assumption. But recent evi­
dence has shown that emotion lies at the very heart of language. In this 
chapter we will show how this perspective helps us understand the criti­
cal processes involved in the way we develop and use language. 
THEORIES OF LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 
The psychology of language is currently dominated by three main schools 
of thought: generativism, the theory developed by Noam Chomsky; 1 cog­
nitive linguistics, sparked by the work of Lakoff and Langacker;2 and 
?()R 
The Role of Emotions in Language Development 
209 
interactionism, inspired by the work of Austin and Bruner) Generativism 
looks at language acquisition as a biological phenomenon: a maturational 
process in which a child automatically acquires the grammar of the lan­
guage spoken in her culture. Language acquisition, in this outlook, is a me­
chanical process: a child acquires grammar as a result of information that is 
encoded in her "language gene," which controls how her brain processes 
speech. As its name suggests, cognitive linguistics looks at the role of cogni­
tion in language development. In this outlook, cognitive development pre­
cedes and enables linguistic development. Thus, instead of treating 
language and cognition as separate processes, cognitive linguistics seeks to 
explain the acquisition of the complex features of grammar that genera­
tivists have identified in terms of the concepts that a child constructs as she 
interacts with objects and people in her environment. And finally, interac­
tionism looks at language development as a social phenomenon. In partic­
ular, it studies the types of enculturated skills that a child acquires when 
she learns how to talk. In this outlook, verbal behavior emerges from and 
along with nonverbal communication to provide a new way of solving 
problems together with others. The child is "learning how to do things 
with words"; and the "things" that she is learning how to do are socially 
constructed acts, possibly unique to her culture. 
Each of these theories has illuminated different aspects of language ac­
quisition. Generativists, for example, have been able to chart interesting 
patterns in the syntactic constructions that children acquire.4 Cognitive 
linguists have been to explain the cognitive factors underlying the acquisi­
tion of many of these constructions.5 And interactionists have shed light 
on the linguistic/cultural skills that a child acquires.6 What all three of 
these theories have in common, however, is that none of them considers 
the role of emotion in language development. A rigorous literature search 
on the relationship between emotional and linguistic development over 
the past century turns up little, apart from the research of those working 
in the area of language disorders. The tacit assumption amongst psy­
cholinguists appears to be that emotional development is at best extrinsi­
cally related to language development; that is, it enters the discussion only 
as a motivational factor that may enhance or impede the linguistic, cogni­
tive, or social-communicative processes at work. Or else emotional devel­
opment is subsumed under language development as a separate domain 
of category terms that a child masters in her march towards acquiring a 
theory of mind. 7

T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
In this chapter we present a radical departure in Western thinking 
about the nature of language development, which dates back to the view 
of language instituted by Descartes,S by placing emotions at the very 
heart of the language development process. That is, we argue that emo­
tions serve not just as a motivational factor but as the critical architect of 
language development. A child's first words, her early word combina­
tions, and her first steps towards mastering grammar are not just guided 
by emotional content, but, indeed, are imbued with it. A child's capaci­
ties to speak fluently and creatively, to become a competent member of 
her sociolinguistic community, to use her burgeoning language skills to 
master more complex aspects of language, and to use language to enter 
other domains of knowledge are all the consequence of intrinsically emo­
tional processes. 
Language, in this view, is not acquired mechanically as some sort of ab­
stract system for transmitting one's private thoughts; nor is language de­
velopment the result of mapping words onto concepts that a child has 
constructed in the privacy of her mind. Language comes first from lived 
experience and is much more complex than (but fundamentally similar to) 
a child's smiles and frowns, gestures and head nods, cries of joy and shouts 
of anger, the meaning of which she learns through shared emotional expe­
riences with her caregivers. Likewise, the meaning of the verbal sounds or 
signs that a child masters are grounded in the long chains of co-regulated 
emotional interactions that, as we saw in Chapter 1, underpin the growth 
of the child's mind. In general, the more constricted a child's emotional 
development the more delayed and problematic her language develop­
ment. Indeed, as we shall see, the view of language acquisition as a me­
chanical process championed by generativist theorists is most aptly suited 
to children suffering from profound biological challenges that have seri­
ously impaired their emotional interactions with caregivers. 
Chomsky's generativist theory proceeds from a famous argument, 
known as the "poverty of the stimulus," which sought to establish that 
language acquisition would not be possible unless a child were endowed 
with knowledge of the possible forms that grammar can take. That is, a 
child must come into the world possessing a set of "super-rules" that 
make language acquisition possible; only thus can we explain how "chil­
dren's grammar explodes into adultlike complexity in so short a time. 
They are not acquiring dozens or hundreds of rules; they are just setting 
a few mental switches."9 
The Role of Emotions in Language Development 
2 1 1 
From a psychological point of view, the most important implication of 
this argument is that, strictly speaking, language-or at least, grammar­
is not something that can be learned In Chomsky's words, "[K]nowledge 
of grammar, hence of language, develops in the child through the inter­
play of genetically determined principles and a course of experience. In­
formally, we speak of this process as 'language learning.' It makes sense to 
ask whether we misdescribe the process when we call it 'learning.' . . .  I 
would like to suggest that in certain fundamental respects we do not really 
learn language; rather, grammar gtowS in the mind."10 Thus, the guiding 
principle in Chomsky's view of language development, as described by 
Steven Pinker in his book The Language Instinct, is that language "devel­
ops in the child spontaneously, without conscious effort or formal in­
struction, is deployed without awareness of its underlying logic, is 
qualitatively the same in every individual, and is distinct from more gen­
eral abilities to process information or behave intelligently."! ! 
We will not look here at the various arguments with which genera­
tivist psycho linguists have sought to back up this argument, such as their 
attempt to document language "universals," or to seize on various lan­
guage disorders as proof that language is an autonomous faculty.12 Nor 
will we consider the legion of criticisms that this theory has attracted,13 
or the impoverished view of language which it adopts. !4 Rather, our 
main concern here is to consider what's wrong with looking at language 
development as a mechanical or biological process. When we return to 
our discussion of Chomsky's theory in a later part of this chapter, it will 
be to try to understand the reasons why Chomsky, and indeed, his gener­
ation, could have been so drawn to a biological model that they com­
pletely overlooked the role of emotion in language development. 
To be sure, biology does play a critical role in early language develop­
ment, for a child needs a brain that has the capacity to recognize and 
organize affectively meaningful experience into patterns. However, al­
though the basic ability to construct patterns is present at birth, to 
some degree the ability to create. more complex patterns and higher 
and higher levels of organization depends on favorable emotional in­
teractions with the world, leading to new sequencing and pattern­
constructing abilities. Therefore, what we observe is a biologically 
endowed nervous system with lots of potential. But at each step this 
potential requires highly specific kinds of emotionally engaging interac­
tions, which in turn lead to new abilities and potentials. The human 

2 1 2  
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
nervous system is thus continuously being modified as the child inter­
acts in an emotionally meaningful way with her environment. We now 
need to consider the kinds of emotional experiences a child must un­
dergo to develop language. 
I MPLICIT OR PRO CEDURAL KNOWLEDGE 
The earliest stages of language learning lie in presymbolic processes that 
are outside conscious awareness. Such presymbolic, or subsymbolic, 
processes-for example, a toddler learning how to relate to a particular 
caregiver or learning the difference between acceptable or unacceptable 
behavior-are sometimes referred to as "implicit" or "procedural" 
knowledge. It is knowledge of the world that .is organized, for the most 
part, without the use of symbols. Most of us, for example, have a sense 
of what's dangerous or safe without necessarily thinking about it. 
Implicit or procedural knowledge, however, has not been sufficiently 
conceptualized or systematized. What are the different types? Are there 
different levels of such knowledge? 
The four presymbolic levels of emotional interchange we have de­
scribed in earlier chapters may constitute a useful framework for con­
ceptualizing and systematizing procedural or implicit knowledge. These 
include shared attention and regulation, engagement, two-way purpose­
ful communication, and complex, co-regulated, emotional problem­
solving interactions and the formation of a sense of self. 
Procedural knowledge can, therefore, become quite complex. Before 
being able to form symbols, a toddler develops a sense of self, forms ex­
pectations, and experiences emotional polarities. Well before symbols 
dominate the horizon, toddlers and preschoolers have developed an 
understanding of the basic themes of life, the nature of closeness and de­
pendency, the scope of acceptable assertiveness and aggression, the be­
havioral patterns that lead to approval versus disapproval, and the 
boundaries of safety and danger. We propose, therefore, that the proce­
dural or implicit knowledge that results from complex emotional inter­
changes between infants, toddlers, and caregivers leads to the stages of 
development that enable a child to separate perception from action and 
to form symbols. This in turn prepares the child for her entry into lan­
guage proper. 
The Role of Emotions in Language Development 
2 1 3  
THE EXPERIENTIAL NATURE 
OF EARLY LANGUAGE LEARN ING 
Preverbal gestural, social, and problem-solving experience precede the 
creation of meaningful verbal symbols. Without this basic level of know­
ing through doing, the child has no experience to draw on to render the 
use of words truly meaningful, when this becomes phonologically possi­
ble. We see the full force of this point in children with significant lan­
guage impairments, who, through intensive behavioral therapy, can be 
trained to say a certain number of words to obtain a selected object or 
goal, and even to generalize these words to some extent. But the meaning 
of these words is fundamentally tied to their instrumental uses; the 
words have no connection with any lived emotional experience. For a 
child developing typically, however, a word such as "peach" is bound up 
with the sweet delicious fruit whose juice dribbles down her chin. Simi­
larly, the child knows what "love" means through hugs, cuddles, and flir­
tatious glances; the meaning of the word is inextricably bound up with 
her loving experiences with her caregiver. So too with the words "open," 
"up," or "door," which are all grounded in their experiential contexts. 
Consider the following "representative list of early words" for chil­
dren learning English: 1 5  
JUICe 
mama 
all gone 
cookie 
dada 
more 
baby 
doggie 
no 
bye-bye 
kitty 
Up 
ball 
that 
shoe 
nose 
hat 
If one looks at this list in isolation from the context in which these 
wards are acquired, one might find it possible ta treat this monumental 
step that the child is taking into language either as a mechanical process 
(related to the child's evolving phonological skills) or as a strictly cogni­
tive process (reflected in the grammatical classification of the child's ac­
quisition of the fifteen concepts involved here). But consider how these 
first words are acquired. For example, consider the child who lights up 
with glee when her caregiver says, "Would you like to go outside?" and 
is then pulled from the door handle with "First we have to put your 

2 1 4  
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
shoes on, sweetheart"; "You know you can't go outside until you have 
your shoes on"; "Now we have to put your other shoe on," and so on. 
The child learns how to say "shoe" in the context of her excitement at 
being able to go outside and explore a whole new world. Otherwise, the 
incentive to learn the word is slight. Over time, the child may learn to 
dissociate "shoe" from this vivid emotional context and treat the word 
as what linguists call a "category term": the name of a class of objects 
that are defined by such-and-such features. (Or perhaps not? Perhaps 
this is one of the reasons why some adults continue to experience such a 
feeling of exhilaration when they shop for new shoes?) But to begin 
with, the meaning of "shoe" cannot be divorced from this or similar 
vivid interpersonal emotional experiences. 
Every one of the words on the above list will have similar stories associ­
ated with it. Think about something as simple as a child's saying the word 
"hi" to a person she meets. How do we teach that? Do we say, "We say 
hello to first-degree relatives and everyone who lives within a quarter mile 
of the house"? Or does the child associate the word "hi" with a warm, 
friendly feeling in her gut? Then with people who invoke that feeling and 
with whom they feel comfortable, she waves and says, "Hi." When a rela­
tive comes over who's a little cold, the child hides behind mother's legs. Is 
it the emotional cue or the memorized script that children rely on when 
they learn how to use the word "hi"? Clearly, it's the cue. 
The same point applies to the child's early word combinations and 
growing mastery of grammar. That is certainly not to say that we cannot 
identify important semantic-syntactic rules or significant phonological 
patterns in these early word combinations. 16 But underlying the learn­
ing of these possible rules and patterns is the child's advance through 
the first four stages of functional/emotional development. 
We came to see the full significance of this point in our work with chil­
dren with autism who had not progressed beyond the fourth stage of fie 
development. For example, they would say, "Door, door, door" or "Open, 
open, open, open . . .  " while standing before a door, indicating that they 
wanted to go out. There was no connection between the nouns and the 
verbs. We hypothesized that to link the nouns and verbs they needed to 
connect a strong emotion they were feeling with the action they wanted 
to perform. When a child said, "Open, open, open . . .  " we got stuck be­
hind the door. Now the children had to get rid of us to continue their ac­
tivity. The children pushed us away and we, in turn, would try to establish 
some back-and-forth communication. We'd go away a step and come 
The Role of Emotions in Language Development 
2 1 5  
back, saying, "Go, go?" and the child would give some purposeful gestures 
as if to say, "Go! Get out of here! I want to open and close that door." 
Eventually, after some time, we would say, "Go away? Go away?" and the 
child would make gestures to that effect. Once the child began purposeful 
gestures instead of random and repetitive ones, she was more intentional 
and emotions could direct his behavior. We helped her make this connec­
tion by being a pain in the neck (but a gentle, playful pain in the neck). 
Once children had this emotion and began connecting it to the word 
"go," guess what they did? They began using that verb and noun prop­
erly. They said, "Go away!" "Mommy, go!" and "Dad, stop!" Eventually, 
it was "Leave me alone." Within months, we would have meaningful 
sentences from children who had never before used language meaning­
fully. In fact, using this technique with the kids with echolalia (they al­
ready could say the words) led to a rapid use of meaningful language. It 
takes longer with children who can't form words because of motor­
planning problems. The kids who can already say the words do well 
quickly. We have to get the affect system hooked up. Neurologically, 
they can speak. The words are simply not hooked up to the emotions; 
but that connection, from our experience, is not very difficult to estab­
lish once the child has begun to use words, especially in young children. 
Our current theory of autism is that its basis lies in the biological 
problems that interfere with the children's ability to make this connec­
tion; that is, naturally hooking up the affect system to their sequencing 
system (motor planning), as well as emerging symbols. This is why the 
child who has some motor skills or has some ability to repeat words she 
hears begins rote and repetitive actions or words. These children line up 
their toys endlessly or repeat words because their motor skills or words 
don't become invested with meaningful emotional experience. 
Once kids can connect their own emotions to their sequencing ability 
and, eventually, to their symbols, they become motivated to use language 
meaningfully. Gradually (children vary in pace) their language becomes 
more meaningful and socially appropriate. They tend to decrease or stop 
echoing, lining up their toys, and generally being perseverative. Depend­
ing on the individual children and the environmental and neurological 
problems, they may or may not retain some autistic traits. However, they 
tend to communicate more meaningfully and flexibly than would be 
possible by using the older methods, which do not involve emotion. 
Thus, our work with autistic children constitutes further important 
evidence that contradicts a prewired language module. This work shows 

2 1 6  
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
how specific experiences need to be present for language development, 
including how different parts of speech are aligned. 
The meanings and the uses of words-the semantic and pragmatic 
aspects-are embedded in the gestural interactions that are used to ex­
plore and know the world. The ability to form a word is linked to what 
is already partially known through this exploration. A known object 
takes on additional meaning through context and further emotional ex­
perience with it. Therefore, the meanings of words emerge from emo­
tional exchanges that provide the foundation and context for their use. 
One might still argue that a child's ability to combine symbols in a 
systematic manner is genetically determined. However, as we can see in 
the example above, the ability to form grammatical connections also 
stems from emotional experience. That is, it was only when we created 
powerful emotional experiences (such as getting stuck behind the door) 
that the child began to say such things as "Go away from door." A 
child's growing ability to speak in sentences has to do with her expand­
ing experience. Various levels of intensity in emotional experience help a 
child define and categorize her thoughts and actions with the myriad emo­
tional nuances that accompany them (e.g., "happy mommy" or "yummy 
dessert"). Once we recognized the significance of this point, we began 
to develop a very different set of "language milestones" from what one 
finds in standard mechanistic theories of language development. 
A NEW SET OF " LANGUAGE M ILESTONES" 
Generativists stress how nearly all children develop the same language 
skills at virtually the same time in the same invariant sequence. Thus, 
children are said to "acquire language like clockwork. Whether a baby is 
born in Stockholm, Tokyo, Zimbabwe or Seattle, at 3 months of age, a 
typically developing infant will coo. At about 7 months the baby will 
babble. By their first birthday, infants will have produced their first 
words, and by 1 8  months, 2-word combinations. Children of all cul­
tures know enough about language to carry on an intricate conversation 
by 3 years of age." 17 The reason we see this regularity is said to be be­
cause the development oflanguage is "under maturational control"; that 
is, neurobiologically determined by "unitary timing constraints."18 
This argument presents a striking example of how, by narrowing 
one's vision, one can find data to validate one's theory. One thing that is 
The Role of Emotions in Language Development 
2 1 7  
missing here is the considerable variability that children display in the 
development of their linguistic skills: not simply in the age at which 
they master the various milestones listed above, but also in regards to 
which of the above steps they actually go through.19 It is not uncom­
mon for a child to go directly from babbling to multiword utterances, 
or for a child to "lose" a word or a construction that she seemed to have 
mastered. Also, in a significant number of cases, a child who had ap­
peared to be developing normal linguistic skills may suddenly, between 
the ages of two and three, revert to a nonverbal state (which is often the 
parents' first indication that their child is suffering from a pervasive de­
velopmental disorder). 
The real problem with this argument, however, is that it overlooks 
the preliminary stages of development that are vital to a child's language 
development. As we said earlier, before a child can develop language 
skills, she must first attend to the external world, and indeed, want to 
attend to the external world (first stage). She then has to become more 
interested in human interactions, and to become emotionally invested 
in interactions with her primary caregivers (second stage). She then has 
to start engaging in emotional interactions (third stage). Once the child 
can open and close small circles of communication, she can now ad­
vance to much longer and more complex problem-solving interactions 
(fourth stage). It is only when she has mastered these first four stages of 
fie development that the child can separate action from perception and 
begin to master the use of symbols and words. 
THE RHYTHMS OF LANGUAGE 
Vocal and motor interactions between caregiver and toddler exist in var­
ious rhythms, rapid exchanges, slow exchanges, simple rhythms, novel 
rhythms, and so forth. We all get bored and tune out when we hear a 
slow, even, monotone, but we perk up and listen to a rapid, novel, 
changing rhythm, particularly when these are in tune with the mean­
ings of the words being expressed (speeding up or slowing down to em­
phasize an emotional point). As infants and toddlers are identifying and 
using vocal patterns, there is an intimate relationship between what can 
be perceived (processed auditorially) and what can be articulated (a 
child hears sound patterns and tries to imitate them). A toddler or child 
who has a hard time planning and sequencing actions, and therefore 

2 1 8  
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
with reciprocal emotional cueing, may have a relatively more difficult 
time engaging in and recognizing the rhythmic patterns while listening 
to or using expressive language.2o 
These rhythmic, interactive patterns are a vital dimension of language. 
Research on the temporal aspects of auditory processing and language has 
produced such intervention strategies as slowing the presentation of 
sound sequences according to temporal dimensions.21 Another vital com­
ponent of the temporal system, however, is the rhythmicity of sound se­
quences. Different perceiving patterns are likely. Too slow a presentation, 
for example, may make pattern recognition more difficult. Research in 
progress on the Interactive Metronome is revealing an optimal rhythm for 
sound perception and its relationship to rhythmic motor activity.22 This 
research is also identifYing differences in the degree to which individuals 
with different processing challenges can perceive these patterns. 
Interest in rhythmicity and timing goes back centuries to the philo­
sophical arguments of Aquinas, Newton, Leibnitz, and Kant about the 
nature of time and how humans come to perceive it.23 Interestingly, fe­
tuses and newborns alike perceive time and estimate the duration of 
events.24 Newborns are able to discriminate the speech rhythms of dif­
ferent cultures.25 
Our own research shows that there is an intimate relationship be­
tween timing, rhythmicity, and synchrony on the one hand and the 
ability to plan and sequence actions and solve problems on the other. 
Through reciprocal emotional interactions with her caregivers, the child 
continues to be involved in timed and rhythmic communication. Back­
and-forth communications, which build on the capacity for timing and 
rhythmicity, in turn, give rise to these higher-level planning and se­
quencing capacities, ultimately involving complex reflective thought 
and verbal communication. 
There are various steps to the process by which rhythmicity and tim­
ing influence higher-level cognitive and academic abilities. First, timing 
and rhythmicity are necessary for learning to sequence and plan actions 
(to be purposeful with one's environment). This ability for motor plan­
ning and sequencing is a foundation skill in human development that 
begins in early infancy. The infant actually begins to learn to interact 
with her environment in a rhythmic and timed way in utero, when we 
can observe her responding to sounds and to types of rouch and move­
ment. She is also hearing her mother's heartbeat and sensing her breath­
ing rhythms. Almost immediately after birth, newborns will respond to 
The Role of Emotions in Language Development 
2 1 9  
sights and sounds and begin patterns of looking and listening. These 
early interactions with the world are organized in time and rhythmic se­
quences, as are the infant's cycles of alertness, sleep, and wakefulness, as 
well as other biological rhythms (which are partially endogenous and 
partially influenced by the environment). 
The infant uses her timed and rhythmic interactions with the world 
to begin two distinct patterns. One is to establish her synchrony with 
her caregivers, as we observe when babies in the early months of life are 
involved in shared looking, smiling, rhythmic motor activity, and a vari­
ety of emotional expressions with their caregivers. This capacity for syn­
chrony, based on coordinated rhythmic activity, keeps on developing 
through life. 
The second pattern, which builds on the first, is the growing ability to 
plan and sequence actions. Initially, this involves purposeful, back-and­
forth exchanges with caregivers through simple smiles, looks, expres­
sions, and other motor behaviors, such as reaching, taking, returning. 
Over time, this ability to plan and sequence is used to establish social re­
lationships, and the infant and toddler learns complex problem solving, 
for example, taking a parent by the hand and showing her the desired 
food. Later on, toward the middle part of the second year, the toddler 
uses this ability to plan and sequence to investigate and solve problems in 
her environment on her own. She may search for a hidden toy or figure 
out where her mother is when visiting a new house. Eventually, this same 
ability to plan and sequence becomes the basis for forming symbols and 
sequencing ideas (saying things such as "I want juice now" or "Where is 
Daddy?"). It then becomes the basis for thinking (answering questions 
such as "Why do you want to go outside?" with "Because I want to 
play."). Subsequently, it is the basis for sequencing ideas together into a 
complex logical pattern, such as writing an essay or performing other 
higher-level cognitive and academic tasks. In just about all advanced 
thinking and problem solving, the ability to plan and sequence behavior 
and thought is at the foundation.26 Throughout this process, there is an 
intimate relationship between timing, rhythmicity, synchrony and motor 
planning, and sequencing. 
Recent research supports this model. For example, the rhythmicity 
and timing of infant-caregiver interactions correlates with early cogni­
tive capacities.27 School-age children with better timing and rhythmic­
ity capacities have higher academic and cognitive capacities than those 
with weaker timing and rhythmicity capacities.28 Problems with timing 

220 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
and rhythmicity are associated with difficulties with modulating atten­
tion, behavior, and motor performance, and improving this capacity ap­
pears to improve attention and academic skills such as reading.29 
ENTERIN G  THE FLOW 
O F  CONVERSATION 
As an illustration of how co-regulated emotional gesturing orchestrates 
the higher levels of the mind, consider the seemingly simple yet puz­
zling everyday phenomena of how we decide what to say. In a back-and­
forth conversation with a close friend most of us can talk a blue streak. 
We're using words interactively at a very rapid rate. Surprisingly, during 
this process, if we're fortunate, we're being both creative and logical. 
How do we figure out what to say? Do we think of all possible words, 
phrases, or sentences and then decide which ones to use? In a rapid, 
spontaneous conversation with a close friend, there seems to be very little 
of this type of prior thinking. The words just seem to flow. We posed this 
question to a student who was attempting to master the theory presented 
in this chapter. The student thought long and hard and then explained, 
"You just have a sense or feeling about what you want to say and the 
words sorta flow." We responded, "Precisely!" For most of us, if we're not 
in a highly self-conscious state or having a conversation in which we are 
consciously anticipating our arguments, the words just "sorta flow." 
The question is, what enables the words to flow? We've noticed that 
children who are unable to engage in back-and-forth emotional gestur­
ing are often unable to keep up a conversation. For example, children 
who can exchange only three or four emotional signals in a row tend to 
have short bursts or islands of verbal exchanges and then either beat 
to their own rhythms, become self-absorbed, or idiosyncratically switch 
to another topic. They have a hard time with long conversations, 
whether it's a pretend-play conversation, a discussion about school or 
peers, or their favorite foods. 
Conversely, children who can easily engage in a continuous flow of 
emotional gesturing and signaling seem to have an easier time maintain­
ing long conversations. In fact, we tend to see certain parallels between 
the themes or emotional areas where the emotional gesturing is the 
strongest and where the verbal dialogue is the strongest. For some chil­
dren, this may be an area of particular interest, such as playing house, 
The Role of Emotions in Language Development 
221 
and for others, it may be certain types of feelings, such as intimacy and 
pleasure. 
How does emotional gesturing help a child maintain the flow of ver­
bal interaction? How do her emotions influence the words she uses? 
Most of us have had the experience of trying to come up with an idea, 
be it for a present to buy a friend or a topic for an essay. As we're trying 
to think, we may ask ourselves rhetorical questions such as "What does 
my friend like or enjoy?"; but there's another component that we can 
sometimes bring to consciousness, even though it operates largely at a 
preconscious or subconscious level. This involves what the student we 
referred to earlier called "a sense or feeling about what you want to say." 
For this discussion, consider how the emotional signaling going on be­
tween two people would support their spontaneous, creative, ongoing 
conversations. 
As one party initiates the conversation with an emotional gesture 
(tone of voice, facial expression), the other party experiences both the 
emotional gesture and the verbal content. The two together stir an emo­
tional reaction. This in turn leads to an emotional/verbal response. If 
they can maintain a continuous flow of such emotional gesturing 
through their vocal tones, body postures, and facial expressions, this 
rhythm can provide the substrate for the words each uses. In this way, 
two individuals remain tuned in to one another, responsive to one an­
other, and stir each other to remain creative and logical in their conver­
sations. The continuous flow of emotional signaling organizes and 
maintains the seemingly higher-level symbolic exchanges. 
This model of language and communication has important implica­
tions, not only for understanding the emotional basis of higher-level 
symbolic and language skills, but also for helping children who face 
challenges. For example, children or adults who have difficulties with 
"word retrieval" (finding the word they want to say) can be helped by 
creating highly emotional states that are motivating but not overwhelm­
ing. These states, we have found, enable the individual to find the word 
more easily. Over time, using heightened affect states enables the indi­
vidual to retrieve words more readily, even in more typical exchanges. 
Another important aspect of conversation that needs to be empha­
sized is the role of emotional gesturing in simultaneously supporting the 
creative and the logical and reality-based aspects of language. The con­
tinuous flow of emotional gestures provides a constant source of new 
emotions that can stir the next sequence of ideas or words. In this way, a 

222 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
conversation with a good friend is a shared creative enterprise. That's 
what makes it so much fun to just hang out and chit-chat. Because 
some individuals are less comfortable or gifted at expressing a full range 
of emotional gestures, their conversations often appear more formal and 
planned. Again this dynamic has been useful in therapeutic work. With 
children suffering from Asperger's syndrome, for example, we engage 
them in pleasurable emotional interactions containing more and more 
novelty and surprise, gradually accentuated, so that they feel secure 
while experimenting with new emotional exchanges. As we help a child 
laugh and giggle, and experience a wider range of emotions from coy­
ness and flirtation to curiosity and mild annoyance and assertiveness, we 
often observe that their spontaneous verbal exchanges become much 
more creative and humorous. As they become more creative, they also 
become more capable of making inferences and engaging in higher-level 
abstract thinking because these also depend on generating new ideas. 
The key in this process is a caregiver or clinician who can challenge a 
child gently and gradually to experiment with a continuous flow of 
a broader range of emotional signals. We have found that direct work 
with words and concepts divorced from the world of emotional gestur­
ing does not work nearly as well, and sometimes it's counterproductive 
because it leads the child more into scripts than into spontaneous and 
creative exchanges. 
Just as emotional communication facilitates the creative use of lan­
guage, it also facilitates the logical and reality-based use of language. Re­
ality, for a child, is established through being able to relate to someone 
outside of one's self in a meaningful way. It's the ability to communicate 
across the frontier of one's own psyche to someone else's psyche that es­
tablishes a psychological boundary between one's self and another. This 
enables individuals to determine what's subjective and inside themselves 
and what's objective and outside themselves. 
This process, however, is not a one-time event. The child must con­
stantly sample and communicate with what's outside herself She does 
this through a continuous flow of back-and-forth emotional signaling 
that uses all the sensory and motor capacities at her disposal to commu­
nicate a full range of emotional themes, from dependency and love to 
anger and aggression. As the child does this, she is also constantly sam­
pling the reality of another person. As she responds to that person's ges­
tures with gestures of her own, she is also building bridges between their 
emotions and her emotions, and between their associated words and her 
The Role of Emotions in Language Development 
223 
words. The dialogue is now not only creative, but logical and reality­
based because it involves communicating with someone outside herself. 
Reciprocal gesturing and motor planning and sequencing, particu­
larly its rhythmic dimensions, may also be especially important for oral­
motor sequencing capacities and overcoming oral-motor dyspraxia 
(children who find it hard to learn to speak), as well as stuttering and 
lack of expressive intonation. Improving reciprocal affective gesturing 
and the related capacities for motor planning and sequencing may, 
therefore, contribute in various ways to the processes that support lan­
guage development. These may range from the basics of auditory per­
ception and imitative production of sounds and words to symbol 
formation and meaning. 
THE APPEAL OF MECHANISTIC 
VIEWS O F  LANGUAGE ACQUISITION 
To understand why Chomsky's biological theory of language acquisition 
had the appeal that it did in the 1960s and '70s, we first need to under­
stand the reasons Chomsky himself was so drawn to a mechanistic 
model. In this respect, it is important to see how much his ideas were 
influenced by the climate that gave birth to Artificial Intelligence,3o 
and, perhaps even more important, the influence of his teacher at the 
University of Pennsylvania, Zelig Harris. 
In the late 1 940s, Harris was one of the leading figures in the school 
of linguistics called Descriptivism. Harris insisted that linguistics has 
two primary tasks: 
1 .  To establish the hierarchical structure of sentences 
2. To sort the units of this hierarchy into classes with equivalent distributions 
According to Harris, the study of linguistic form-that is, gram­
mar-should be kept completely separate from the study of semantics, 
or meaning. Linguistics, according to Harris, should be concerned only 
with the discovery of formal patterns. 
Language, in this view, can be treated as a formal system governed by 
a set of implicit rules that the linguist strives to discover by studying the 
speech patterns of native speakers. This view of linguistics was strongly 
influenced by the striking developments that were occurring in a branch 

224 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
of mathematics called "recursive function theory." In 1937, Alan Turing, 
the great English mathematician, showed that a "formal system" can be 
defined as any mechanical procedure for producing formulas. Turing's 
definition of a "mechanical procedure" was to become one of the driv­
ing forces in the creation of computers and the science of Artificial In­
telligence.3l The impact that these developments had on Harris is that 
he saw the linguist as trying, like the mathematician, to develop a for­
mal deductive system complete with axiomatically defined initial ele­
ments and theorems concerning the relations among them. 
In Harris's highly mathematized vision of linguistics, the two tests that 
a system must meet are, first, it should be able to generate utterances that 
a native speaker of the language will regard as well formed; and second, 
the system must be able to analyze novel utterances. To do this, the lin­
guist studies distributional regularities in speech. Morphemes-the 
smallest units of meaning in a language-are classified into groups that 
resemble one another with respect to their distribution. For example, by 
studying speakers' reactions to utterances, the linguist establishes that 
cat, dog, book, chair can each occur in the frame 
The 
is on the mat. 
Or, to take another example, good, bad, nice, clean can each occur in the 
frame 
The __ boy. 
These two examples present us with the members of two different 
"form-classes." Because the first form-class seems to be approximately 
the same as what we call nouns, this can be symbolized with N; and as 
the second seems to correspond to adjectives, this can be symbolized 
with A. The next thing we discover is that A N phrases, such as good boy, 
have the same distribution for the frame 
The 
is on the mat. 
This fact is recoded in the equation A N '= N. But Harris made it clear 
that he was not trying to defend the traditional parts of speech (e.g., 
"noun," "verb"), which typically appealed to the logical analysis of the 
The Role of Emotions in Language Development 
225 
meaning of words to identify parts of speech. Even though "form-classes" 
might to a considerable extent coincide with traditional parts of speech, 
the two are not identical. 
Chomsky's initial work was highly influenced by Harris. He adopted 
Harris's maxim that meaning must be completely separated from grammar, 
and that the goal of linguistics is "to formulate a general theory of lin­
guistic structure in which such dry and abstract notions as 'phoneme in 
L,' 'phrase in L,' 'transformation in L are defined for an arbitrary lan­
guage L in terms of the physical and distributional properties of utter­
ances of L and form properties of grammars of L."32 Like Harris, 
Chomsky approached the task of constructing a grammar mathemati­
cally; namely, just as an equation generates a class of infinitely many well­
formed formulae (wf), so too, according to Chomsky, we should treat a 
grammar as a set of rules generating all the wff sentences of a language. 
Meaning is not supposed to enter here at all. Hence the importance of 
Chomsky's famous example: "Colourless green ideas sleep furiously"; this 
was supposed to demonstrate that speakers will recognize this sentence as 
well formed, even though it makes no sense. Conversely, the grammar 
must not generate sentences-for example, "Furiously sleep ideas green 
colourless"-that speakers will recognize as ill-formed. If a grammar gen­
erates ill-formed sentences, it must be wrong. 
In Chomsky's initial treatment of what he called "Phrase Structure 
Grammar," S stands for sentence, NP for Noun Phrase, VP for Verb 
Phrase, D for Determiner, Aux for Auxiliary verb, A for Adjective, N for 
noun, and V for verb. Chomsky introduced the "rewrite" sign " 	 " 
in place of Harris's " ,= "  so that we would see the following formulae as 
rules for constructing sentences: 
S 
	 
NP + VP 
VP 
	 
Verb + NP

Det + N

T H E  F I RST I D EA 
This "phrase-structure grammar" generates a sentence such as "The man 
will hit the ball " and it provides a structural description for every sen­
tence that it generates. This structural description can be written either 
as a tree, or with brackets. The language generated by such a system is 
the set of all sequences that can be reached from the symbol S by fol­
lowing the rules and making a choice whenever one is offered. 
Chomsky's next move in Syntactic Structures was the crucial one: He in­
troduced the theme of syntactic universals. Chomsky's idea was that the in­
finite class of all possible grammars of the Harris/Chomsky type is well 
defined. We can define it as containing any finite set of rules, each of 
which is of the form ''A.'' A set of rules that conforms to this definition is 
known as a "context-free phrase-structure grammar." Then Chomsky 
proved mathematically that there are well-defined classes of morpheme­
sequences that can't be generated by any "context̤free phrase.,.structure 
grammar." In other words, the class of "context-free phrase-structure gram­
mars" is a subset of the class of all possible grammars or all possible lan­
guages. If one assumes, therefore, that "context-free phrase-structure 
grammar" is the appropriate tool for describing the syntax of human lan­
guages, then one is assuming that all human languages belong syntactically 
to a limited subset of the class of all possible grammars. In other words, 
there exist certain syntactic universals of human language; that is, language 
is NOT, as the Descriptivists had assumed, infinitely variable. Indeed, 
Chomsky argued that the Descriptivists were tacitly committed to this 
conclusion. Despite their overt commitment to unlimited linguistic diver­
sity, they were tacitly committed to the existence of syntactic universals; 
that is, to the idea that every human language can be represented using the 
above kinds of rules for constructing a sentence. 
The next thing Chomsky showed is that "context-free phrase­
structure grammar" is actually inadequate to generate human languages. 
The problem is, there are certain sentences, called "constructional

omynyms, t at context-rree p rase-structure grammar cannot ex-
plain without becoming hopelessly complex ("The shooting of the 
hunters''). According to Chomsky, this will have two different transfor­
mational derivations, either from the structure of "The hunters shoot" or 
"They shoot the hunters. " Chomsky concluded that "context-free phrase­
structure grammar" thus needs to be supplemented with "transforma­
tional grammar": transformational rules on phrase structures that we use 
to transform, for example, assertions into questions, or active sentences 
into passive sentences. In the above example, the underlying phrase "the

227 
shooting of the hunters" has two transformational derivations, one active, 
with "hunters" as the subject {"The hunters shoot") and the other passive, 
with "hunters" as object {"They shoot the hunters''). In other words, we 
have to distinguish between the surface structure of the sentence, "The 
shooting of the hunters, " and its deep structure (namely, "The hunters 
shoot" and "They shoot the hunters'). 
The point of formalization, according to Chomsky, is that once the 
linguist has discovered a grammar, he then needs to make it explicit and 
precise enough that it can be tested mechanically. And herein lies the 
key to the influence that Chomsky's early theories exerted on psycholin­
guistics: According to Chomsky, someone learning a language is in exactly 
the same position as the linguist; that is, the language learner has to "pre­
dict distributional regularities." Moreover, a language learner has to be 
able to produce and understand new utterances. So once the language 
learner has formulated a grammar, that language learner can be viewed 
as essentially a machine (a la Harris) that can "generate the sentences of 
her language." That is, the process that a child goes through in learning 
a language can, according to Chomsky, be likened to the analytic pro­
cess that the linguist goes through when constructing a grammar. Thus, 
when a child produces a novel utterance, "this is of course a kind of pre-
diction."33 
In retrospect, it seems clear that the success of this argument lay in 
its tapping into the computational revolution that was transforming 
psychology at the time. Chomsky capitalized on computational ideas in 
his attacks on behaviorism, especially when he argued that "in principle 
it may be possible to study the problem of determining what the built­
in structure of an information-processing (hypothesis-forming) system 
must be to enable it to arrive at the grammar of a language from the 
available date in the available time."34 This so-called "steady state" argu­
ment cast the behaviorist in the role of a neophyte programmer who 
was struggling to model one of the most complex of all human behav­
iors by using a relatively crude "Markov chain" technique. Thus, it is 
hardly surprising that the new breed of computationalists, all of whom 
were familiar with Shannon's proof that a "brute force" approach could 
not be employed to construct even the most basic of chess programs,35 
should so readily have accepted the idea that the brain must be 
equipped with certain "super rules" that enable a child to acquire the 
myriad "surface" rules of the natural language to which she is exposed 
at birth. 

228 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
As far as contemporary behaviorists were concerned, what Chomsky 
meant by "knowledge of language" was similar to what geneticists under­
stood by "canalization." And, as Pinker36 has shown, what Chomsky un­
derstood by "rule-following" was similar to what ethologists understood 
by "instinctive behavior." Thus, from a behaviorist perspective, Chom­
sky's early theory represented the convergence of the two primary ad­
vances taking place in behaviorism in the 1 950s; namely, Artificial 
Intelligence and genetic determinism. From AI, Chomsky took the idea 
that the brain of the child must be preequipped with a basic language 
program for it to arrive at a grammar of a natural language from the lim­
ited (and degenerate) data that is presented to a child. And from genetic 
determinism he took the idea that a gene or genes contain the "blue­
print" for the construction of this Language Acquisition Device. By mar­
rying these themes, Chomsky presented an argument that played a 
crucial role in the transition from precomputational mechanism, which 
eschewed all talk of the mind, to the postcomputational view that higher 
mental processes, as well as reflexes and conditioned behaviors, could be 
explained in mechanist terms. 
The essence of Chomsky's contribution to this transition from classi­
cal behaviorism to cognitive science was his idea that language acquisi­
tion is a maturational process, as this had been defined by Gesell; 
namely, one in which a child's development is directed by internal factors 
(genes) and always unfolds in a fixed sequence.3? Hence, we find the 
constant refrain in Chomsky's and subsequent generativist writings that a 
child acquires language in a fixed sequence that is under genetic control. 
In this maturational view of language acquisition, gene-environment in­
teraction amounts to a form of potentiation: "Language acquisition is a 
matter of growth and maturation of relatively fixed capacities, under ap­
propriate external conditions. The form of the language that is acquired 
is largely determined by internal factors."38 That is, the child must be ex­
posed to the "right" kind of environment (whatever that is) if all the in­
formation stored in the "language gene(s)" is to be activated (or, as 
Chomsky would later put it, for the "parameters" of any particular natu­
ral language to be set). Herein lies the reason why generativism so swiftly 
assimilated the idea that "the functioning of the language capacity is . . .  
optimal at a certain 'critical period' on intellectual development."39 For 
on the mechanistic view of language acquisition, it seemed straightfor­
ward to assume that the linguistic "information" that is "encoded" in the

229 
genes can be released only at specific junctures in the maturational pro­
cess, the timing of which is itself directed by the genes. 
THE FUNCTIONAL/EMOTIONAL 
VIEW OF INTERACTIONISM 
Chomsky's biological model of language acquisition was countered by 
the interactionist thinkers mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. 
Jerome Bruner in particular showed that his model overlooks the role of 
caregiver-infant interactions of a child's language development.4o Inter­
actionism highlights how exchanges between infants and caregivers are 
initially carried out with sounds and gaze to establish and maintain joint 
attention. These are then supplemented by natural gestures and then 
sounds to initiate or coordinate routines between the two. The infant 
starts to look where her caregiver wants and starts to attend to objects 
and situations. Soon after this, the infant begins to use gaze and gestures 
to direct her caregiver's attention, and then to use gestures and conven­
tionalized sounds to initiate exchanges. The child begins to use words in 
place of vocalizations and/or gestures. Remember that the child is trying 
to get her ball, to stand up, to be fed, to attract attention, to go to point 
B; and she is exploring means or soliciting help for attaining these ends. 
The gradual development of language skills is integral to the child's 
growing ability to satisfy her needs or expectations and to express her de-
sires or intentions. 
Our model of language development introduces a critical further di­
mension to this argument by clarifying the critical role of emotions in 
this interactional process of language development. Furthermore, our 
model shows how affective gesturing is the glue that binds biological and 
communicative processes together in the development of language skills. 
We explained at the outset of this chapter that for a child to develop 
language, she must possess a biologically endowed nervous system with 
a few rudimentary capacities and lots of potential. At each step of devel­
opment, this potential requires highly specific kinds of emotional inter­
actions, which in turn lead to new abilities and new potentials. Indeed, 
recent evidence shows that when the human nervous system is engaged 
in this type of emotionally mediated growth, it's also likely laying down 
new pathways; this happens as a result not of a genetic blueprint but of 

230 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
some fundamental capacities that are now being defined and redefined 
and organized and reorganized at new levels through interactions with 
the emotional world. 
This argument lies at the heart of a debate that has galvanized the 
psycholinguistic community. In 1 996, Saffran, Aslin, and Newport 
published a groundbreaking article in Science reporting that eight­
month-old infants can extract word-like strings of phonemes from the 
statistical properties of the input; that is, they can distinguish between 
syllables that regularly hang together from those that are randomly jux­
taposed.41 Here, as Bates and Elman argued in their commentary fol­
lowing the article, was clear evidence that young infants can identifY the 
structure of language simply by being exposed to it.42 
Not surprisingly, generativists responded en masse that Bates and El­
man had confused the mechanisms involved in word learning with 
those involved in grammar acquisition; that is, that language as such 
cannot be learned simply on the basis of its statistical properties. The 
problem raised by generativist critics here is essentially this: How does 
the infant bridge the gap between pattern recognition per se and as 
complex a phenomenon as language? As a pattern recognizer, the baby 
is able to recognize patterns in all sensory areas. These patterns can be 
visual, spatial, auditory, tactile, motor. Obviously the auditory-vocal ex­
periences for a child hearing and making sounds are critical for language 
development. But how does something as basic as recognizing patterns 
in the sounds that one hears and makes become the basis for meaning­
ful language? How does a child transform her basic recognition of and 
expression of patterns, some of which are instrumentally learned, into a 
meaningful system of rapid presymbolic and symbolic communication 
at various levels of meaning and reflection? 
It's this latter question that lies at the heart of the debate over the Saf­
fran et al. findings. This question highlights meaningful language as far 
more than the simple generalization of instrumental behavior. Mter all, 
various levels in shades of meaning and reflection would appear to tran­
scend any known mechanisms of learning. We have demonstrated, 
however, that there are several intervening steps that occur in the early 
months of life that lead a baby from simple capacities for pattern recog­
nition to a complex symbolic system. Specifically, we identified (see 
Chapter 2) four presymbolic levels and two early symbolic levels that 
are critical in this transformation from pattern recognition to full lan­
guage. It is therefore experience that is the critical factor, but it is a spe-

231 
cific type of experience: It is affective interactive experience. But it is 
more than simply such experience; it is six levels of interactive emo­
tional experience that, as we saw, have taken millions of years to evolve 
and are now part of each baby's experience in the first two to three years 
of life. 
The full development of language also requires the integration of au-
ditory and vocal patterns with visual-spatial motor and other sensory 
processing patterns (olfactory, tactile) . This is because language, and 
even presymbolic gestural systems, are bound up with the full range of 
one's sensory experiences. For example, when one talks about mother 
or, for that matter, an apple, under normal development one can feel 
that mother or, if one so chooses, visualize and almost taste, smell, 
touch that apple. Hence the symbol is bound up with a full and rich 
multisensory affective experience. This is what we mean by "knowing 
something," whether it's knowing mother or the apple. 
These six basic levels of affective experiences that characterize the 
pathway to language development not only transform sound perception 
and vocalization patterns into meaningful language but also, as we de­
scribed earlier (see Chapters 1 and 2), enable the child to integrate all 
her experiences-auditory, visual-into integrated patterns at the pre­
symbolic and symbolic level. Looking at the totality of these experiences 
affords a very different perspective, therefore, of the multiple factors in-
volved in language development.

Emotions and the 
Development of Intelligence 
O
U R  F OC U S O N  AFFECTIVE or emotional transformation has led 
not only to a new way of looking at the growth of intelligence but 
also to a new way of thinking about intelligence and the pathways to it. 
From our developmental point of view outlined in Chapter 2, intelli­
gence is the progressive transformation of our emotions from global re­
action to sensations to high-level reflective thinking. The early stages 
that we described, dealing with co-regulated emotional interactions 
leading to symbols, are the cornerstones of this process. This focus on 
emotional transformation redefines what we mean by intelligence. 
A D EVELO PMENTAL 
MO DEL OF INTELLIGENCE 
In theory and practice, we have tended to underfocus on the emotional 
generative aspect of intelligence, the creation of the intent and ideas. In 
addition, we focused more on putting intentions and new ideas into an 
analytical frame of reference without realizing that our very capacity to 
construct a logical frame of reference was itself a product of emotional 
interactions. 
Most modern cognitive theorists following a long tradition in educa­
tion and, to some degree, Piaget, have focused primarily on the imper­
sonal and analytic rather than the emotional generative or truly reflective 
232 
Emotions and the Development of Intelligence 
233 
thinking aspects of intelligence. The emphasis has been on putting in­
tentions and new ideas into an analytical frame of reference. For exam­
ple, schools place enormous emphasis on teaching children to organize 
and sequence their ideas. Children are expected somehow intuitively to 
come up with the ideas they are analyzing and framing or to judge the 
relative degrees of importance of the ideas they are sequencing. 
As we have mentioned before, we were first alerted to the importance 
of the generative aspects of thinking and intelligence in our observa­
tions of children with and without developmental challenges. When we 
observed and talked to children with strong self-awareness and reflective 
thinking skills, we realized that most of them also showed positive self­
esteem, demonstrated a capacity for moral judgment, were analytical in 
their reasoning, and did well in school and with their peers. We sought 
to understand what helped them become this way, and, therefore, spoke 
with them and also with children who exhibited opposite personal char­
acteristics. We learned that the traits we commonly label as intelligence, 
social skills, and morality were based on the child's ability to use his 
emotions to think out problems in various areas. 
For example, when we asked a group of eight-year-olds abstract ques­
tions, such as what they thought about justice or fairness, their com­
ments were revealing. Some of the children responded with a rote listing 
of people who behaved "fairly," such as a particular parent or teacher or 
television character. However, others gave far more reflective answers, 
for example, "Well, when I hit my brother after he hit me. It was unfair 
for me to be punished, but when I hit him first it was fair for me to get 
a punishment. If I bump into him by accident, it's not fair to be pun­
ished, but if I do it on purpose, it is fair." 
Not surprisingly, when we looked at the two groups of children more 
closely, those who gave us the rote list tended to be the ones who were 
experiencing more problems in their relationships and in their school­
work. The children who gave us more creative and reflective responses 
tended to do better in these social and intellectual areas. 
We then took a second look at the more reflective responses and dis­
covered that they had two components. This was true whether our test 
question focused on fairness or any other abstract quality, such as hon­
esty, friendship, or freedom. The first component was that the children's 
responses always started off with a personal anecdote, an account of 
lived emotional experience. The second component was that the children 

234 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
put these experiences with abstract concepts into some sort of analytic 
framework and context. 
When we later asked this same question of adolescents, they were 
able to list more categories (five different types of fairness, for example) 
and supplied an even more worldly-wise analytical framework. But in 
every instance, and at every age, this lived emotional experience was ev­
ident in the more sophisticated replies. The children who didn't have a 
lot of lived emotional experiences-due either to caregiver patterns or 
to biological challenges that interfered with interaction-tended to be 
the ones who responded with concrete lists. We also observed that even 
children with severe developmental problems, including autistic pat­
terns, could become more creative and reflective when they were ex­
posed to more one-on-one, affectively rich, and progressively more 
challenging affective interactions with their caregivers, which systemati­
cally led to these needed experiences. 
To help children with limitations, we discovered that we have to mobi­
lize their emotions and generative abilities to help them learn to create 
ideas and to become emotionally intentional and interactive. When we 
created or used natural situations of strong affect to generate intent and 
ideas, these children often became creative, logical, and reflective.l Among 
very competent adults, those who combine both generative and analytic 
thinking often make the most original contributions to their fields. 
Because generative ideas emerge from emotions and intentions, the 
historic dichotomy separating reason and emotion may be partly re­
sponsible for the lack of emphasis on the generative part of thinking. In 
the developmental model presented in this work, we attempt to redress 
this oversight and give proper weight to the generative component of 
intelligence. The logical, analytical aspect of thinking, however, also 
stems from emotional interactions, as we showed in Chapter 2. Mter 
all, logic and a sense of reality come from reciprocal emotional interac­
tions. These interactions establish the boundary between what's inside 
me and subjective and what's outside me and more objective; that is, the 
ability to separate fantasy from reality. 
The ability to create ideas from one's experience and to reflect upon or 
understand those ideas in a broader context or under logical scrutiny 
operates best in areas where one's actual emotionally meaningful experi­
ences are extensive. Intelligence, considered to be a high level of cognitive 
ability, is so often contrasted with talent, usually defined as outstanding 
Emotions and the Development of Intelligence 
235 
facility in an expressive field. However, highly accomplished musicians, 
writers, and visual artists can be every bit as intelligent in their fields of ex­
pertise-that is to say, as capable of understanding and reflecting on mu­
sic or poetry or painting-as a brilliant mathematician is in mathematics. 
Regardless of the field, fine differentiation and a grasp of relationships are 
the essence of intelligence. A person who is both intelligent and talented 
is skillful in some-and sometimes in many-areas of endeavor. Intelli­
gence, however, goes beyond talent in that it involves a systematic under­
standing of why and how things work-of how certain colors react with 
others, or why a particular equation describes a phenomenon, or why a 
given note produces the desired emotional tone. 
Nearly every field of human endeavor is thus susceptible to intelli­
gence, although standard IQ tests do not reflect skill in many of these ar­
eas. Some, like higher mathematics, law, or philosophy, involve ability 
for symbolic abstraction. Engineering and science permit the exploration 
of extremely complex relationships. Literature, music, and the visual and 
performing arts allow exquisite subtlety of emotional expression. Many 
other fields not generally considered "intellectual" or "creative"-every­
day endeavors such as carpentry or child care or gardening, for exam­
ple-can nonetheless draw considerable levels of intelligence from expert 
practitioners. 
To tap into high levels of intelligence, intelligence testers generally try 
to concentrate on cognitive skills in certain highly symbolic fields. High 
intelligence is thus equated with the ability to do well at manipulating 
words, numbers, or shapes. Over the years, testers have built up a huge 
body of data about a grab-bag of skills; indeed, the traditional tests stay 
in favor because of this useful history and its accumulated database. The 
tests are used not because they reflect the latest thinking on true intelli­
gence and its relationship to the skills measured but because more so­
phisticated yet quantitative measures of intelligence are very difficult to 
design. 
Individuals who possess great skills in narrow and often highly sym­
bolic fields often show great ineptitude in areas involving judgment, 
personal relationships, and aesthetics. Because these individuals have 
only a narrowly based intelligence, they embody neither the full range 
nor the highest levels of intelligence and are therefore limited in the ar­
ray of abilities that a humane and civilized society should encourage 
and extol. 

236 
T H E  F I RST I DEA 
DEFINING INTELLI GENCE 
Prevailing definitions of intelligence continue to evolve. The theorists 
Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg have shown that people can 
possess multiple forms of intelligence-musical, kinesthetic, and social. 
Their concepts are much more nuanced than definitions based on tradi­
tional IQ.2 There is a need, however, to develop our understanding of 
intelligence further so that we can elucidate the nature of intelligence in 
whatever field it is exercised. What are the critical mechanisms and pro­
cesses that lead to and constitute intelligence in its most basic form? 
The literature on the emotional and social roots of cognitive capacities, 
although supporting a relationship between emotions and cognition, 
has not identified the critical developmental pathways or processes that 
unite them.3 In this book and other works, we_have explored these rela­
tionships as a basis for a new framework and definition of intelligence. 4 
The ability to generate or create a full range of ideas in the areas of 
one's human emotional experiences and then reRect on them and orga­
nize them into a logical framework is, we believe, an appropriate defi­
nition of intelligence. Both this creative ability and reflective and 
sequential reasoning are necessary ingredients of intelligence and both 
are developed through emotional or affective experience. Rather than 
measuring intelligence with one cognitive yardstick, we must find ways 
to evaluate it according to its depth and breadth. 
For instance, an extensive and accurate vocabulary is a sine qua non of 
any writer or lawyer, as is outstanding manual coordination for a sur­
geon or sculptor, or excellent skills of spatial analysis for an architect or 
fighter pilot. But these abilities are only preconditions for developing 
high intelligence in those fields, not intelligence itself. They will become 
part of deep intelligence only when a person uses them to gain knowl­
edge and experience in a particular field and then operates creatively 
and reflectively in that field. According to our definition, therefore, a 
"gifted" dilettante will never, no matter how high his IQ scores, achieve 
a deep level of intelligence. Only deep and extensive knowledge based 
on extensive personal emotional experience and learning can generate 
high levels of creative and reflective thinking for that field. 
Depending on the degree to which the emotional and intellectual 
transformations we have been describing occur, we can observe varying 
degrees of breadth, creativity, and reflectiveness as well as varying degrees 
Emotions and the Development of Intelligence 
237 
of limitations or constrictions. When there are compromises, we may see 
significant deviations in the levels of emotional health and intelligence 
growth attained. These can include 
• magical and irrational thinking; 
• 
impulsivity rather than reflectiveness; 
• polarized (all-or-nothing thinking) rather than integrated reasoning; 
• 
rigid concrete thinking (where only a few possibilities are held onto) 
rather than broad-based reflection; 
• thinking restricted to considering only the "here and now" rather than 
thinking that takes the future into account; 
• various limitations in the breadth and scope of possibilities considered or 
analytic principles used; 
• 
thinking constricted to any limited or narrow domain. 
THE FUNCTIONAL/EMOTIONAL 
APPROACH TO INTELLIGENCE 
We have been discussing the central role of emotions in helping to cre­
ate the two capacities necessary for intelligence-(l) the capacity to 
create ideas and (2) the capacity to reflect on those ideas. We showed 
how emotions are essential for creating ideas because it's through our 
wishes or desires that we generate new ideas. We also showed how 
emotions are essential for reRective thinking because it's through the 
stages of emotional transformation described earlier that we develop 
the capacity to reflect on new ideas (to think). 
Emotions also enable us to use each of our cognitive or "processing" 
capacities in a functional, meaningful (intelligent) manner. For example, 
consider something as simple as an eight-month-old who is reaching for 
his father's nose to get him to make a "toot-toot" sound. This requires 
emotional intent, the wish to reach for that nose. Without such an emo­
tionally fueled desire, a child would have no reason to employ his motor 
skills in purposeful action. In other words, the early sense of intentional­
ity or causality stems from an infant's emotional intents. Similarly, the 
desire to vocalize back when his mother speaks or sings stems from a 
relationship that embodies the desire to have fun, make sounds, and re­
ceive another sound back. Similarly, searching for a hidden object to 

238 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
learn about physical space is also based on the emotional interest and in­
tent to discover where that rattle went when it fell to the floor. Such ac­
tivities are often the sign of a new emotion, such as curiosity. 
All the different aspects of human development that contribute to in­
telligence are integrated by the emotions. As we will see in Chapter 1 2, 
our emotions unite and integrate language, motor, perceptual motor, 
and visual-spatial processing capacities, as well as influence our ability 
to modulate sensations. Interactions that are emotionally meaningful 
usually involve using many developmental capacities at the same time. 
Not infrequently, a child will be reaching for Daddy's nose (motor pat­
terns), vocalizing in delight (vocal language patterns), and responding 
to Daddy's vocalizations and encouragement with more vocalizations 
and reaching. If, at the same time, Daddy is moving his nose from one 
side to the other and the child keeps finding it and reaching for it, he is 
also adding on a visual-spatial and perceptual motor component. Under 
the guidance of his emotional intent within one interactive sequence, 
the child is practicing language, motor, and visual-spatial capacities all 
at the same time. He is getting them all to work together as an inte­
grated "mental team." Such multicapacity interactions are the genesis of 
real intelligence. 
Just as we earlier defined emotions as "functional/emotional interac­
tions," we have defined intelligence as "functional/emotional intelli­
gence." It is functional because it employs the abilities (such as language 
and motor skills) that children need to function in a useful manner to 
master one's world. It is emotional because the emotions provide the ini­
tial intent and, later, through their various transformations, the complex 
interactions that lead to higher and higher levels of creative and logical 
reflective thinking. 
In Chapter 2, we demonstrated how emotional interactions progress 
through sixteen stages. Each stage transforms emotions and intelligence. 
We traced this process through different levels, from the catastrophic 
expression of intense emotions to higher levels of logical and reflective 
thinking. 
At each level of emotional transformation, emotional affective inter­
actions create a higher level of integration, or a coming together, of the 
different components, such as language, motor skills, perceptual motor 
capacities, and visual-spatial thinking. As indicated above, the compo­
nents are thus harnessed by our emotions to function as an integrated 
"team" (like a well-rehearsed ballet company or a first-rate basketball 
Emotions and the Development of Intelligence 
239 
team). Consider another example: A five-year-old engaged in pretend 
play might very well use lots of words to describe the actions of his char­
acters (language); build pretend forts, castles, and new weapons systems 
(visual-spatial and motor); and answer questions about why one group 
of characters represent the good guys and the other group the bad guys 
(reflective thinking). The whole process may well stem from the excite­
ment and pleasure of communicating and interacting with Daddy and 
conveying an inner fantasy, a personal emotional view about how good 
and evil interact in the world. In formulating and discussing a business 
plan with his boss, a young adult might very well be simultaneously us­
ing these same capacities-language, motor, visual-spatial, and reflective 
thinking. 
As functional emotional intelligence is building to higher levels, it is 
also broadening. Individuals with lots of experience in solving problems 
of a social and emotional nature may achieve a high level of intelligence 
in these realms. A mathematician or physicist may achieve high levels of 
intelligence in symbolic and conceptual realms. Some areas of intellec­
tual activity, such as literature and social science, require a fair degree of 
breadth of experience. Other endeavors can benefit from breadth of ex­
perience but may not require it to the same degree. 
Origins of a Shared Sense of Reality 
A critical component of functional intelligence is a strong sense of real­
ity. In Chapter 2 we saw that opportunities for continuous emotional 
signaling are essential for establishing a sense of reality, reality testing 
(the ability to distinguish fantasy from reality), the capacity for orga­
nized thought (rather than fragmented thinking), and an organized 
sense of "self." Children without this experience have only episodic real­
ity contacts with the world. Continuous emotional contact with the 
world outside us (with other people) occurs through ongoing emotional 
interactions. This process anchors us to external reality and to our inner 
world at the same time and enables us to tell the difference between 
them and separate the two. 
lt also leads to a shared sense of reality that makes joint endeavors with 
others possible. Even though there are differences in our nervous sys­
tems, there are many similarities in the way human beings process sensa­
tions such as sounds or sights. Human beings also have more experiences

that are similar than one might think. They tend to share certain features 
associated with each of the stages outlined earlier in Chapter 2. For ex­
ample, most people have relationships and interactions with others that 
promote purposeful emotional signaling and, therefore, a basic sense of 
"causality." As they negotiate with others, most people learn to sequence, 
to perceive patterns, to solve problems, and to use ideas. To some degree, 
most people interact with words in a way that supports some degree of 
the logical use of ideas. Although individuals differ in levels mastered, for 
the most part emotional interactions create similar structures for thinking. 
At the same time, the "content" of each person's logical ideas will differ. 
One person will think about food; another will think about anger. When 
individuals have significant dysfunction in the physical makeup of their 
nervous systems or in their families and the interaction patterns that un­
dermine these basic structural aspects of thinking, we generally see a de­
creased sense of reality and a decrease in a shared sense of reality. 
As we saw in Chapters 3 to 7, during the course of evolution, cultural 
practices gradually enabled prehumans and humans to master these 
structural features of thinking, thereby providing us with a shared sense 
of reality. In addition to our similar biologies, therefore, our similar 
emotional interaction, mediated by cultural practices dating back to 
nonhuman primates, maintains our capacity, in a relative sense, to see 
the world as others do and to solve problems together. 
This shared sense of reality, in turn, supports our social and political 
institutions. As we will see in Part IV of this book, however, if too many 
individuals grow up with deficits in the way their central nervous sys­
tems process information, or with extremely dysfunctional family and 
interaction patterns, the "consensus" of what constitutes reality could 
easily slip away. The very constructive, near infinite variations in the 
"content" of our lives can only survive in the context of shared struc­
tures for thinking and problem solving. 
Understanding Concepts 
As an example of the role emotions play in intellectual development, 
consider the way children learn or "could" learn new concepts. To give a 
concrete example, one of us (S.I.G.) worked with a little girl who was 
verbal and could read, but was having a hard time with more abstract 
reasoning. Her mother gave many examples of things her daughter 
Emotions and the Development of Intelligence 
241 
could not do. I asked whether or not the little girl would be able to un­
derstand a concept such as "taxes," and mother quickly responded, "No. 
That's exactly the type of thing she's having trouble with at school and 
at home. She doesn't seem to be able to understand abstract concepts 
like that." I made a bet with the mother that in five minutes we could 
enable this little girl to understand what taxes were. 
I asked her whether she liked pizza. She said she did. I then said, 
"Okay, if we're going to order pizza, how many pieces should we have in 
the whole thing?" She said, "Oh, 1 like to have eight pieces in the pizza." 
She could also do some basic adding and subtracting, so 1 said, "Okay, 
let's pretend you have a pizza!" and we took a piece of paper and drew 
the pizza, cut into eight slices. 1 then said, "Now, your brother [who was 
present at our session] wants to steal all your pizza! I'm going to be a 
make-believe policeman and protect your pizza, but you have to give me 
something if I'm going to protect you and your pizza from your brother, 
who wants to steal it. How many pieces of the pizza will you give me to 
protect the whole thing?" She said, "I'll give you two pieces." 1 said, 
"Okay, I'll take the two pieces and I'm going to protect the rest of the 
pizza." Then 1 said to her, "You know, what you're giving me, the police­
man [the two pieces of pizza], is called 'taxes.' That's what we give to po­
licemen in the real world to protect us from somebody coming in and 
robbing our house." She seemed to grasp it. To see whether she really 
had, 1 said, "What other things would you be prepared to pay taxes for 
besides getting your pizza protected?" She said, "I would pay to have the 
streets cleaned"; and because she was aware of the prominence of 
the military on Tv, she said, "I would also pay soldiers to protect us, 
too." When 1 asked how much of her pizza she would give for clean 
streets, she said, "One piece"; and for soldiers to protect us she said, 
"One piece." At the end of this brief exchange, the child's mother agreed 
that her daughter was now beginning to understand what taxes were­
that taxes were what you paid the government for certain services, such 
as police, soldiers, or clean streets. 
Now, of course, a child can't be quickly taught to abstract beyond his 
or her potential at a given moment, but it's hard to know the child's po­
tential until we invest the particular learning task with heightened af­
fect. The heightened affect provides the child with a personal stake and 
investment in thinking. The child will then apply the highest level of 
thinking he has available. When a child has a personal stake in the task, 
he can reason about that issue at a higher level than other issues where 

242 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
there isn't the personal stake. Protecting her pizza from her brother en­
abled all this child's available facilities to reason. These emotional stakes 
enable us all to understand certain concepts more quickly. Take the con­
cept of "plot." If you ask a young child just learning to react whether he 
knows what a "plot" is in a story he is reading, he will have only a vague 
notion. However, if you begin asking, "What is your favorite TV 
show?" Once he names it, you can ask, "What's that one about?" The 
child will probably get right to the core of it. A natural question such as 
"Hey, what's that about?" is the beginning of an experience that under­
lies understanding the concept of "plot." At retelling with relish the ac­
tion of some favorite shows and comparing them, it becomes easier for 
the child to understand what the word "plot" means. When he grasps 
that "plot" is simply another way of talking about what the story is 
about or what the author intended the story.to be about, he has mas­
tered a new concept. This approach we just described is derived from 
our understanding about how concepts are formed in the first place. 
Children, who have lots of affectively rich experiences in their families, 
can re-create their personal experiences to understand new concepts. If 
one asks a child how to solve a new problem in math or how he figured 
out what the author was saying in the novel, he will often reason it out 
through personal examples and general principles and then apply these 
to impersonal experiences. He will use two steps-a generative step, 
which is emotionally rich and creative, and an analytical step, which 
then makes sense out of this emotionally rich experience. Many chil­
dren carry out these steps on their own. We are all amazed by the gifted 
teacher who can bring physics, math, or literature down to a visceral 
personal level. This person can be contrasted with a teacher who just 
works on formulas and has children simply memorize mathematical op­
erations or word definitions without grasping exactly what the formulas 
or words are revealing about how the world works. 
In summary, understanding concepts involves a sequence of steps that 
begins with emotional interactions. Applying this insight suggests an em­
phasis for education that may enable children to achieve levels of reflec­
tive thinking of which they may not seem capable. Although each will 
still have his own limitations, we will never know where those limitations 
are or are not until we explore the most emotionally rich ways of present­
ing new ideas. Once again, the road to high-level logical thinking is not 
through containing our emotions, but through their regulation, differen­
tiation, and transformations during the course of development.

243 
Implicit or Procedural Knowledge 
Much of what we learn is outside conscious or symbolic awareness. 
Such presymbolic, or subsymbolic, processes-for example, a roddler 
learning how to relate to a particular caregiver or learning the difference 
between acceptable or unacceptable behavior-are sometimes referred 
to as "implicit" or "procedural" knowledge. It is knowledge of the world 
that is organized, for the most part, without the use of symbols. Most of 
us, for example, have a sense of what's dangerous or safe without neces­
sarily thinking about it symbolically. 
Implicit or procedural knowledge, however, has not been sufficiently 
conceptualized or systematized. What are the different types of proce­
dural or implicit knowledge?5 Are there different levels of procedural or 
implicit knowledge? 
We would suggest that the four presymbolic levels of emotional inter­
change we have been describing in earlier chapters constitute a useful 
framework for conceptualizing and systematizing procedural or implicit 
knowledge. These include shared attention and regulation; engagement; 
two-way purposeful communication; complex, co-regulated, affective 
problem-solving interactions; and the formation of a sense of self. 
Procedural knowledge can, therefore, become quite complex. For ex­
ample, it involves the patterns of co-regulated emotional interaction that 
lead to a sense of self and enable the toddler to integrate emotional polar­
ities as well as form expectations and conceptualize patterns of interac­
tion. Much of the toddler's and preschooler's understanding of the basic 
themes of life-the nature of closeness and dependency, the scope of ac­
ceptable assertiveness and aggression, the behavioral patterns that lead to 
approval versus disapproval, and the boundaries of safety and danger­
are all learned significantly before symbols dominate the horizon. Also, 
these implicit or procedural patterns make symbol formation possible 
because they involve co-regulated, reciprocal affective interchanges that 
enable the child to separate perception from action, tame and regulate 
catastrophic affect (that push for action), and form symbols. 
We propose, therefore, that procedural or implicit knowledge be 
thought of as involving the increasingly complex emotional inter­
changes between infants, toddlers, and caregivers that lead to the nego­
tiation and successful mastery of the four stages of presymbolic 
development we described in Chapter 2. It constitutes a much more im­
pOrtant component of human development than is often realized. 

244 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
Theory of Mind 
There has been growing interest in how children form a "theory of 
mind," that is, the ability to understand another person's perspective.6 A 
growing body of research has elevated this construct so that it is now 
considered an important cognitive ability. Understanding another per­
son's perspective can involve a fairly straightforward perceptual chal­
lenge, such as being able to use one's own perceptions and experience to 
imagine another person's perception and experiences and predict where 
another person would search for a hidden object. At a more complex 
level, having a theory of mind may involve understanding how another 
person feels in a situation and how that person might feel differently 
from oneself because of his or her unique emotional experiences. We all 
have different degrees of empathy (different degrees to which we can un­
derstand other people's feelings). 
How children develop a theory of mind and how they develop it at 
its highest level is a most interesting question. It is generally recognized 
that advanced cognitive capacities, such as taking someone else's per­
spective, have a developmental sequence and timetable (three-year-olds 
often only use their own perspective, whereas four-year-olds begin tak­
ing the perspective of others, at least with regard to simple perceptual 
tasks). Yet all the steps in this developmental sequence have not been 
sufficiently worked out. 
We would propose that the origins of a theory of mind are identical 
to the origins of symbol formation. As toddlers experience the exchange 
of emotional signals between themselves and another person, they are 
getting a sense of someone else's emotions in relationship to their own 
emotions. For example, the toddler feels and expresses annoyance with a 
loud grumbling vocalization. Dad responds with a slightly more an­
noyed tone, "What do you want?" Through this type of interaction 
with Dad, the child experiences a pattern of mild annoyance leading to 
slightly greater annoyance in the other person. Assuming this pattern 
continues and the child is asked, "How do you think Daddy feels when 
you are annoyed with him and grumble at him?" the child might well 
say, "I think he feels annoyed, too, or even a little more annoyed." The 
child's ability to understand his father's feelings will be based on his ex­
perience of his father's emotions in relationship to his emotions. With­
out such primary exchanges of emotional signaling, the child would 
have no idea-other than perhaps through some form of deductive 
Emotions and the Development of Intelligence 
245 
logic-how another person would feel in relationship to some behavior 
or emotional expression of his own. In other words, the ability to put 
oneself in another person's shoes emotionally is based on having some 
sense of how one's own emotional expression interacts with the emo­
tions of another person. During the second six months of the first year 
of life and the second year of life and thereafter, emotional interchanges 
are providing the substrate for these types of insights. 
Catastrophic emotions tend to disrupt the development of empathy 
rather than facilitate it. Because the catastrophic reactions lead to direct 
action, including immobilizing panic or withdrawal, they undermine 
co-regulated emotional exchanges and empathy. The intensity of the 
catastrophic emotions is often so severe that even the experience and 
recognition of a simple pattern, such as "I get angry and he gets an­
grier," may fail to materialize. To be able to conceptualize and reflect on 
the perspective of another person takes even more than just forming 
symbols of emotional patterns and being able to describe them verbally. 
Reflecting on the perspective of another person requires the child to 
form logical bridges between his emotions and ideas and the emotions 
and ideas of another person. It involves establishing reality testing and 
reflective thinking abilities, as described earlier. Reality testing, as we de­
scribed, emerges from a boundary forming between the child's emotions 
and the emotions of another person. The child constructs this boundary 
by experiencing his own emotional intentionality in relationship to the 
emotional intentionality of another person. Little disagreements, power 
struggles, and debates, as well as negotiations around feelings involving 
pleasure, dependency, or assertiveness, help the child define this emo­
tional boundary. The more parents and children negotiate their differ­
ent emotional intents in the context of a supportive, calm, intimate 
relationship, the stronger this boundary becomes. 
In general, constructing a theory of mind involves each of the levels 
of emotional exchange we have described. At the presymbolic levels, it 
involves the exchange of emotional signals. At the early symbolic levels, 
it involves the symbolization of interactive, emotional patterns and the 
forming of logical bridges between one's own emotional symbols and 
those of another person. At the more advanced levels, it involves reflec­
tions on one's own and other people's perspective and feelings. 
The highest levels of empathy and emotional perspective-that is, 
the highest levels of theory of mind-involve our highest levels of emo­
tional interaction. For example, to compare the feelings of oneself and 

246 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
another person involves multicausal and comparative thinking (Level 
7). Comprehending subtle differences in degree, texture, or tone of feel­
ing between oneself and someone else involves affectively differentiated 
gray-area thinking (Level 8). Being able to form a judgment about the 
appropriateness of one's own feelings and someone else's feelings in a 
given situation requires an even higher level. For example, deciding 
whether or not another person was angrier than expected in a certain 
situation and whether you were less angry than expected in that situa­
tion requires thinking from an internal standard and a sense of self, 
Level 9. To achieve even higher levels of empathy-for example, under­
standing what it feels like to have children or to make a lifelong com­
mitment to a spouse-requires new life experiences that will emerge 
only during various later stages in the course of life. In short, the psy­
chological and cognitive abilities involved in forming a theory of mind 
have their origins in the same processes that lead to symbol formation. 
Theory of mind reinforces an important principle that we have been 
stressing throughout this work. This is the principle that cognitive, or 
intellectual, skills cannot be thought of as simply impersonal problem­
solving abilities. From their earliest manifestations in infancy to their 
advanced level in adulthood, they stem from complex emotional inter­
changes at each of the stages of development we have been describing. 
Theory of mind has been presented as a mental ability in its own 
right, as opposed to simply being a part of a more general ability for re­
Rective thinking or empathy. It has been presented as if it were a purely 
cognitive construct. What is not realized in both of these assumptions is 
that theory of mind is actually a derivative of the developmental capaci­
ties described earlier. There are different levels of the "theory of mind" 
that are related to or derivative from the different levels of fie develop­
ment. But just as intelligence can be either broad or constricted and may 
involve some processing capacities but not others, similarly, theory of 
mind capacities have different levels and are exercised in various ways. 
For example, a child with very good visual-spatial capacity may be 
readily able to identify how another person would perceive a physical 
object from his vantage-point on the other side of the room. This same 
child, however, may be completely unable to anticipate how another 
person would feel in a given situation. The opposite also holds true. In 
other words, theory of mind tends to be a series of discrete cognitive 
and emotional skills geared to developmental levels and the different 
processing capacities organized at these levels, as well as the breadth of 
Emotions and the Development of Intelligence 
247 
emotional experience (e.g., the child who can empathize with love but 
not with anger, or anger but not with love). 
THE RO OTS AND BRANCHES 
OF INTELLIGENCE 
Our developmental perspective on intelligence suggests that many tradi­
tional skills which have been called "intelligence," such as having a good 
vocabulary or memory or being able to match designs, may actually be 
only roots or branches of intelligence. For example, an excellent memory 
certainly helps one think and, therefore, it might be a useful root. It is 
not the only root, however, and in its own right does not constitute intel­
ligence. Similarly, a memorized definition of a word or concept may be a 
useful branch on the intelligence tree. 
In recent years, emotional intelligence, popularized by Daniel Gole­
man,? has been added to the spectrum of multiple intelligences, men­
tioned earlier. Emotional intelligence used in this way refers to an 
individual's social and interpersonal skills. Such skills, however, are still 
only one branch on our intelligence tree. 
Concepts based on recent neuroscience research, for example the 
work of LeDoux and Damasio,8 which we will discuss in the next chap­
ter, also tend to describe different roots and branches of the intelligence 
tree. For example, they divide the subcortical emotional discharge of the 
passions or emotions from cortical reRective thinking processes. Our 
definition of intelligence, however, involves an integration of subcorti­
cal and cortical processes. The continuing separation of these processes 
most likely represents pathologic development. In contrast, the integra­
tion of these processes most likely represents adaptive, healthy develop­
ment. A failure to make this distinction and take into account the 
transformations emotions go through has contributed to these erro­
neous notions of what constitutes intelligence and emotions. 
True intelligence, what we are calling "functional/emotional intelli­
gence," integrates all the different roots and branches of the "intelligence 
tree," including social and emotional skills, language skills, and visual­
spatial thinking skills, as well as a range of cognitive and academic abili­
ties. It integrates these skills into creative and reflective thinking. The 
roots of the intelligence tree include basic capacities such as vision, hear­
ing, movement, memory, and selective features of perception. The 

248 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
branches of the intelligence tree include many of the different types of 
abilities described as intelligent behavior, such as social or relationship 
skills and mathematical or musical abilities. The trunk of the intelligence 
tree and what integrates the roots and branches together are the func­
tional/emotional developmental capacities. As described in Chapter 2, 
these developmental capacities progress to higher and higher levels dur­
ing the course of adaptive growth and, as they do, they define the indi­
vidual's intelligence. 
MODEL OF INTELLIGENCE THAT 
CAN BE APPLIED ACROSS S PECIES 
D URING THE COURSE OF EVOLUTION 
Understanding the emotional roots of intelligence suggests a more uni­
versal model of intelligence that can be applied across species. This 
model would look at the levels of emotional transformation in terms of 
the stages outlined earlier. The foundation for intelligence would lie in 
the basic ability for emotional signaling involving increasingly differen­
tiated interactions. There is thus a universal process in the development 
of intelligent behavior in different members of the animal kingdom. We 
suggest the following hypotheses: 
• Intelligent behavior involves the degree to which an animal (or group of 
animals), including humans, can exchange differentiated, emotional inter­
actions to communicate and solve problems in increasingly complex ways. 
• The more areas in which an animal can apply these problem-solving inter­
actions (e.g., visual-spatial problems, perceptual motor problems, vocal­
verbal problems, social problems), the greater the breadth of intelligence. 
• The greater the ability for a continuous flow of differentiated emotional in­
teractions, the greater the animal's ability to form complex social networks. 
• The greater the social networks, the greater the ability to deal with basic 
needs and, therefore, the greater the ability to employ mental resources 
for the development of higher levels of intelligent behavior, including the 
creation of new tools, technologies, and possibly even symbolic capacities. 
We see a graduated ability to enter into co-regulated, affective, 
problem-solving interactions among higher-level mammals, such as 
Emotions and the Development of Intelligence 
249 
dogs. Bonobo chimps have pretty elaborate systems for nonverbal cue­
ing, but not nearly as elaborate or continuous as those used by human 
beings. Bonobo chimps tend to have short bursts of affect signaling, but 
not a continuous flow, as many humans have. In addition, humans can 
make many more facial expressions, affect-based vocalizations, and fine 
motor gestures. Human thinking evolved from far more complex affect 
signaling systems. But the basics are there in bonobo chimps. In our 
work with bonobo chimps with colleagues in Atlanta, we are exploring 
whether we can help chimps to be more symbolic through more emo­
tional interactions. We've got them doing imaginative play and being 
more involved in long chains of signaling. Obviously, there will be limi­
tations. Human beings, however, are not different only because they 
symbolize to higher levels, they're different because they are more emo­
tionally nuanced and continuous in their interactions.

Sub symbolic and Symbolic Cortical Systems: 
Implications for Neuroscience and

G
ROW I N G  S U P P O RT F O R  T H E  notion that emotions play an impor­
tant role in aspects of cognition, such as decisionmaking, is emerg­
ing from many sources, including brain imaging studies and observations 
of individuals with central nervous system lesions. Based on these studies, 
emotions are, in part, viewed as providing goals for actions, expectations 
and related imagery for perceptions, and content for representations. 
They are also viewed as conflicting with rational thought at certain times. 
Emotional and cognitive capacities are thought of as separate bur related 
processes. 1 
Missing from this emerging emotional and cognitive framework has 
been an understanding of the developmental pathways and mechanisms 
through which an infant, child, and adult connects emotional and cog­
nitive processes at each stage of development-the how and why of this 
process. As we saw in Chapters 1 and 2, when we observed early devel­
opment in infants and young children, we found that emotional and 
cognitive processes were not part of separate but related systems, but 
part of the same basic process. In fact, we observed that at each stage of 
development, emotional interactions led to cognitive capacities and or­
chestrated their operation. 
250 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
251 
In this chapter, we will see how emotional signaling provides the miss­
ing link between what traditionally has been viewed as the world of emo­
tion and the world of cognition and what many modern neuroscientists 
are describing as the subsymbolic and symbolic systems. We will also ob­
serve how emotional interactions serve as a critical foundation for lan­
guage, visual-spatial thinking, motor planning and sequencing and 
executive functioning, and other aspects of sensory processing. Further­
more, we will explore how understanding the early stages of emotional 
development leads to a vital revision in Piaget's pioneering theory of cog­
nitive development and a model for consciousness that looks at its multi­
ple levels (i.e., multiple prerepresentational and representational levels). 
As discussed earlier, we will further show how emotions, which are often 
viewed as belonging to a part of the brain that evolved relatively early in 
evolution, evolved to new levels during the course of evolution. Simi­
larly, we will underscore an important theme of this book-that in the 
life of each individual, emotions develop to higher and higher levels of 
organization as an infant progresses through the stages of life. Under­
standing the transformations emotions go through during each stage of 
development can help guide and interpret a rapidly growing body of 
neuroscience research. 
Many researchers believe we process a number of emotional patterns 
subsymbolically outside of conscious awareness. We are also proposing, 
however, that emotions serve to integrate the different processing areas 
of the mind, such as attention and sequencing, visual-spatial thinking, 
sensory processing, and language. 
To understand this process, we must first examine a dilemma faced by 
current neuroscientists. How do subsymbolic systems that process emo­
tions such as fear, as well as others, become part of an integrated system 
with cortical symbolic processes? Joseph LeDoux, who has mapped out 
the subsymbolic neuronal pathways involving emotions such as fear, as­
serts that cortical symbolic processes are somewhat separate from the 
subsymbolic systems that mediate emotions. He believes that the sub­
symbolic systems have to be approached through direct biological or 
physiologic methods or, as he sometimes puts it, some types of "psycho­
logical tricks."2 
We have evidence to suggest that this view of the mind and brain is 
not correct, however. Instead, we propose that the emotional signaling 
system we have described in Part I integrates subsymbolic and symbolic 

252 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
mental processes and, therefore, may be the "link" between the subsym­
bolic systems of the amygdala and the symbolic systems of the cortex. 
EMOTIONS TAM ED 
INTO SIGNALS 
In the earlier discussion of the origins of symbols, we hypothesized that 
if a perception is freed from its fixed action pattern it can become a free­
standing image, acquire emotional experience, and become a symbol. 
We also hypothesized that catastrophic affects, such as fear or rage, push 
for direct action and are often part of these fixed perceptual motor or 
action patterns. As emotions become used for interacting with others, 
however, vital changes occur. First, perceptions no longer need to lead 
to direct action; they can become part of interpersonal negotiations. 
The other change is that catastrophic affects, such as fear and rage, 
which push for immediate action, can become "tamed," modulated, or 
regulated through reciprocal emotional signaling. Therefore, as we saw, 
emotions such as fear or rage needn't build up to higher and higher in­
tensities; at their earliest manifestation, a soothing emotional signal 
from a caregiver can modulate such an emotion. Further interaction can 
make the original emotion of fear or rage part of a modulated exchange. 
The fear or rage is now a regulated emotion, even though it may still re­
tain some of its distinguishing physical characteristics. 
Through such exchanges between a caregiver and a child, emotions 
such as fear or rage or anxiety can be used as "signals." Signals are very 
different from catastrophic emotions requiring direct action (such as 
"fight or flight," shut-down, and/or various associated physiologic 
states). These signals can generate emotional and social interactions. 
They can further the continuous flow of emotional interchanges. They 
can, as we saw, modulate and regulate emotions, behavior, and mood, as 
well as help form a sense of self. Signals can also be transformed into a 
mental representation or symbol (an idea). Constructing a symbol or an 
idea eventually enables infants to know consciously that they are scared 
or anxious; they can now reason and figure out the "why" of a feeling 
rather than let it overwhelm them. The ability to know an emotion-to 
study one's own perception of it-is proportional to the degree to which it 
is tamed and transformed into an interactive and representational form. 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
253 
If an emotion such as intense fear remains catastrophic, it pushes for 
direct action; there is awareness of the physiologic states or expectable ac­
tions, but not a deep awareness of the associated emotions or feeling. For 
example, someone might say, "My heart is beating fast. I need to get out 
of here because I'm scared" (and then the person runs). But people who 
can fully represent the emotion and reflect on the feeling can describe in 
depth how it feels to be scared and associate it with similar fears and 
other relevant feelings and experiences. Put another way, tamed, modu­
lated emotions enable the mind to use its working memory to process 
the feeling at a deep level, access related or associated long-term memo­
ries, and plan effective coping strategies. 
The key to the conscious awareness of emotions is, therefore, the 
human ability to tame the emotion through emotional signaling and 
make it into a signal. The degree to which this can occur also deter­
mines the degree to which the conscious perception of a "feeling" will 
be similar to the primary experience of the mong them LeDoux, make 
a distinction between an emotion that is a subsymbolic physical state 
and the conscious perception of that emotion, which is subjective and 
is called a "feeling."3 They believe that the feeling may not be a very 
accurate description of the original emotion, which can't be fully 
known consciously and may not be directly accessible. They conclude 
that talking therapies attempting to explore basic emotions verbally 
may therefore be of limited value and that the modification of basic 
emotions such as fear may need to occur through more direct biologi­
cal interventions. 
As we have discussed, however, if the original basic emotion can be 
transformed into an interactive signal and, thereby, be "tamed," it can be 
known. The key to psychotherapy is to understand the developmental 
pathways involved in processing emotions. In a previous work,4 one of 
the authors showed how, once an emotion is transformed into a signal, 
therapists can help patients use emotions for interactive signaling and, 
eventually, regulate, represent, and work with them. 
In addition, once emotions are not simply experienced or expressed, 
but are transformed into signals, they can also become part of a pattern, 
that is, an interactive, emotional pattern. In this way, complex emo­
tional patterns involving various modulated emotions can also be repre­
sented or symbolized and, thereby, become consciously known. "Fear" 
in this context is no longer a single emotion but part of an interactive 

254 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
pattern. This interactive pattern may involve fear and then soothing, 
and then less fear and more soothing, and then even less fear and more 
soothing. What was initially a catastrophic emotion-fear-is now an 
interactive emotional pattern that involves both the child's emotions 
and the caregiver's emotions. Just as a baby exists only in the social con­
text of a baby/caregiver relationship, as Winnicott pointed out,S simi­
larly an emotion that has become an interactive signal exists in the 
context of its interactive pattern. 
Transforming catastrophic emotions into signals enables a child to in­
tegrate subsymbolic and symbolic systems. This is more difficult in situ­
ations of stress. Stress hormones tend to weaken the functions of the 
hippocampus, the part of the brain that deals with conscious memories 
and communicates with the symbolic system of the cerebral cortex; at 
the same time, stress hormones tend to strengthen the functions of the 
subsymbolic systems dealing with emotions (such as fear) through the 
amygdala. Stress is, therefore, thought to lead to greater fear or anxiety 
and less awareness or conscious control. The ability to transform cata­
strophic emotions-for example, fear or rage-into signals, however, 
also tends to reduce stress and facilitate problem solving. 
EMOTI ONS IN CONTEXT 
Sometimes, emotions are studied outside their social settings. When 
we study a phenomenon, research reduces its complexity. But some­
times, reducing the complexity of a phenomenon can alter it to the 
point that it bears little resemblance to the phenomenon originally re­
quiring study. Emotions need to be understood as they ordinarily de­
velop. Within a few months of life, if not earlier, emotions are part of 
relationships and interactive signaling systems. This is true for many 
types of emotions ranging from fear and rage to love and respect. For 
example, higher-level emotional patterns, such as those involving 
"love" or "respect," almost by definition involve physiological states, 
social exchanges, and symbolic meanings. Complex emotional patterns 
or complex feelings can't be defined without all their critical features. 
Bonding, pleasure, and sexual excitement are very different from ma­
ture human love. Mature love and empathy can't be reduced to separate 
elements. 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
255 
This fact is more than just of theoretical importance. It provides an­
other clue to how emotions lead to symbol formation. k emotions be­
come part of interactive patterns, the child learns to perceive the pattern. 
She doesn't simply experience her heart beating or a desire to run away; 
she experiences fear, then soothing, and eventually mastery. These emo­
tional patterns include expectations and the anticipation of feelings. For 
example, a toddler learns that her joy leads to happiness in her parents. 
She also may learn that her anger leads to parental disapproval or dis­
quiet. These patterns now define the emotion. The emotion no longer 
exists as an isolated entity and, since affective interactions begin very 
early in life, perhaps it never really did. The notion of an isolated emo­
tion may be an artifact of our methods of investigation. 
Emotional patterns become more and more complex. As they do, 
they help the toddler further separate perception from action and form 
freestanding images, which become symbols. Over time, freestanding 
images and emerging symbols become associated with increasingly com­
plex affective interactions. In fact, it is because of this gradual process 
that a child of twenty-four or thirty months has a sense of what love is. 
Love is not an isolated emotion. It is not a feeling based on the interpre­
tation of a physically induced emotional state. It is a representation-a 
symbolization-of a complex emotional interaction that spans a fairly 
long time interval. As such, it captures the many aspects of the experi­
ence of love, the feeling tone, the memory of the relationship's physical 
sensations associated with interactions, the associated sensory, motor, 
and language experiences, and the family and social context. As our 
twenty-four- or thirty-month-old further develops, new emotional ex­
periences will contribute to a growing and changing definition of 
"love." "Love" will come to represent devotion, caring, anger, ambiva­
lence, and many other complex characteristics based on the unique ex­
periences of the person. Other complex feelings, such as empathy, 
respect, and compassion, will also be based on growing experiences. 
The representation of complex emotional patterns can occur at vari­
ous levels of consciousness, depending on the levels of emotional interac­
tion going on between caregivers and children. In fact, our naturalistic 
observations of developing infants and young children suggest a continu­
ous process of gradual increases in consciousness and awareness.6 The 
levels described in Chapter 2 are an attempt to capture various points in 
this continuous process.

The picture painted by modern neuroscientists such as LeDoux and 
philosophers such as Dennett of a symbolic system that perceives and in­
terprets subsymbolic systems that are outside of consciousness is not, 
therefore, consistent with what we observe during children's development. 
Interestingly, their view is very similar to Freud's early topographical 
model of the mind. This model posited three systems-the unconscious, 
the preconscious, and the conscious. He later abandoned this model for a 
more dynamic one. 
In summary, during the course of human development, emotions are 
not unitary, simple entities. They are part of dynamic interactions or 
systems. They are transformed from catastrophic affects into signals and 
eventually become represented or symbolized. There are many different 
levels of symbolization. Critical to the process of symbol formation, 
however, is the transformation of all types of basic emotion into interac-
tiْ sٓmb.

THE D UALITY BETWEEN 
EMOTIONS AND REASON 
The duality between emotions and reasoning, as described earlier, has a 
long tradition in philosophy and psychology and is preserved by many 
neuroscientists working on emotions today. For example, Antonio 
Damasio, M.D., Ph.D., states that "the creation of a body state (of emo­
tions) is automatic, largely preset by our genes." He elaborates that, in 
addition to conscious, rational thought, "another system, probably evo­
lutionarily far older, acts even before the first one. It activates biases re­
lated to previous emotional experience."7 
With regard to his study of patients suffering damage to certain re­
gions of the frontal lobe and who lost the ability to appreciate negative 
outcomes, Damasio states that "despite maintaining normal intelligence 
. . . and though they can reason logically, their decision-making ability 
is flawed . . . .  They can no longer sense, for instance, embarrassment, 
guilt, pride, or shame."8 
As we have been discussing, however, our observations suggest that 
the foundation for intelligence, including creative and logical thinking, 
stems from adaptive emotional functioning (also see Chapters 2 and 10). 
Individuals who are unable to experience basic feelings would, therefore, 
not be able to think logically or function intelligently. For example, logi-
Implications for Neuroscience and Pia get's Cognitive Psychology 
257 
cal thinking, which includes separating fantasy from reality, depends on 
the ability to use emotional signals to probe reality. Through emotional 
and symbolic signaling between a child and others, the child constructs 
the boundary between fantasy and reality and develops the ability to 
think logically.9 Deficits in emotional signaling tend to undermine our 
sense of reality and logical thinking. 
We would, therefore, propose for consideration an alternative and 
more clinically-consistent interpretation of Damasio's research findings 
on patients with frontal lobe damage. They have deficits in emotional 
regulating as well as deficits in sequencing and planning actions, both 
functions of the prefrontal cortex. As a consequence, they have difficul­
ties with fine-tuned, subtle, co-regulated emotional signaling, logical 
thinking, higher levels of reflective thinking, and overall functional 
intelligence. 
In clinical work, we observe that individuals vary in their ability to 
symbolize their emotions. Some can signal across the full range of hu­
man emotions, including love and fear and anger, and others can signal 
only with certain emotions, such as love but not anger or vice versa. 
Some can maintain emotional signaling and regulation even when un­
der stress. Others can't. Some individuals can label feelings but not re­
flect on them. Others can label and reflect on feelings. Still others can 
reflect at high levels and look at subtle shades of "gray" in their feelings; 
compare their feelings; and explore the relationship between their own 
feelings and those of others in the past, present, and future and in the 
context of a stable sense of self and internal standard (see Chapter 2). 
As an individual learns to represent the full range of emotions, he 
constructs a dynamic system that operates as an integrated whole. 
Therefore, the old view of emotions pushing for discharge and con­
scious logic or reason trying to deal with them is not what we see clin­
ically in individuals who have progressed to the highest levels of 
emotional organization . 
At the highest levels of emotional organization, for example, an indi­
vidual will experience a great deal of closeness with his spouse, empa­
thize with his children, be able to experience annoyance and even anger 
without yelling or hitting, and be able to handle a variety of stresses 
with a sense of awareness of the feelings generated, but without being 
overwhelmed. Such an individual will also be able to evaluate his feel­
ings, wonder to himself, "Gee, why am I feeling more loving to my wife 
today than usual?" or, alternatively, "Why am I more annoyed at my 

258 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
family today?" He'll be able to reflect on possible reasons, ranging from 
being annoyed at his own parents, or annoyed at people at work, and so 
forth. When such a person feels a strong emotion, like anger and rage, it 
doesn't overwhelm him and lead to hitting, but it operates at the differ­
ent levels we've been describing. It operates as part of a pattern, where 
anger and concern for others coexist as well as levels of representation 
and problem solving. 
The dualistic view of a separate symbolic-cortical system sitting on 
top of a subsymbolic system is based in part on a pathological model. 
When the connection between these two systems has not been made by 
the development of emotional signaling, the gap between them results in 
psychological problems. In Chapter 2, we showed that certain individu­
als who can't fully signal with their emotions tend to put intense emo­
tions into action (impulsive behavior), somaticize them (headache), or 
engage in polarized (all or nothing) thinking patterns or in fragmented 
thinking. For example, if they are impulsive, there is a greater likelihood 
they will diagnosed with a conduct disorder. If withdrawn, they have a 
greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a pervasive developmental 
disorder. If very fearful, a diagnosis of anxiety disorder may be likely. 
In contrast, individuals tend to evidence a high degree of emotional 
health if they have fully mastered the skills of emotional signaling and 
have progressed to age-expected level of symbolization and reflective 
thinking across the full range of emotional patterns. They tend to have re­
lationships characterized by warmth, intimacy, empathy, and flexible cop­
ing strategies. They can effectively pursue their goals, plan, and solve 
problems. These individuals tend to be more consciously aware of their 
emotions and there is less distortion or difference between emotional pat­
terns and their associated feelings (the conscious awareness of their emo­
tions). In other words, they are more aware of the physical aspects of their 
emotional patterns and can consciously interpret them. 
As indicated, healthier individuals tend to experience their emotional 
worlds as an integrated, dynamic system. Physical aspects of emotions 
such as a tightening of the stomach muscles or a quickening of the heart 
are not experienced as separate from the feeling that represents them. 
The physical sensation and the feelings are integrated characteristics of 
the same basic experience. These individuals are able to exchange emo­
tional signals with others while engaging in symbolic discussion that 
quickly regulates and modulates emotions (e.g., patterns of down- and 
Implications for Neuroscience and Pia get's Cognitive Psychology 
259 
up-regulating, as described earlier). In addition, in well-integrated indi­
viduals, the emotions tend to remain modulated and interactive and 
usually do not build to catastrophic levels. In rare circumstances when 
they do, the individual tends to regroup and, through emotional inter­
actions with others, get back into modulated, regulated patterns. In 
other words, even under intense emotions, their emotional systems are 
integrated and dynamic and show lots of homeostatic balance. 
It's understandable that many researchers would retain the duality be­
tween emotions and reason. Even though they believe, as Damasio does, 
that emotions are necessary for evaluating events and making decisions 
(for example, by weighing negative or positive consequences), primary 
emotions are seen as part of a different and evolutionarily earlier system 
than conscious, logical thought. This view fits the introspective experi­
ence of many individuals as they feel anger or lust and exert conscious 
control and try to figure out how best to behave. What's not always appre­
ciated is how much individuals vary in their ability to be aware of emo­
tions and reason and to integrate them. Individuals who have fully 
integrated emotion and reason use emotions and feelings as the instru­
ment of their reason; for example, when they use empathy or compassion 
or generate a creative solution to a problem. Of course, such individuals, 
like all human beings, can become angry or fearful, but these emotions do 
not conflict with their conscious reasoning. Rather, these emotions and 
their associated feelings become part of larger emotional patterns. Such an 
emotional pattern might involve a variety of emotions, anger, concern for 
others, empathy, and altruism. For example, an emotionally healthy, ma­
ture, reflective individual confronted by a competitive business colleague 
who is making a joke at his expense may respond by wondering why his 
colleague is feeling threatened that day, and might further think about 
how to put his feisty colleague in his place with a gentle joke and, at the 
same time, show some compassion for the as-yet-unidentified stress. This 
would be a complex emotional response involving competition, empathy, 
compassion, and strategic thinking. Alternatively, a less reflective, mature, 
or emotionally put-together individual might respond with rage and yell, 
or attempt to contain his anger by clenching his fists and mouth. This 
person would likely experience a conflict between the rage and the con­
scious need to be in control. 
These two brief descriptions illustrate an important point. Regulated 
emotions that are part of nuanced patterns of interaction are generally 

260 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
associated with more integrated patterns of emotional response and 
higher levels of reflective thinking. Less regulated emotions tend to be 
part of conflict situations and less reflective patterns. Often, the more 
fully the individual masters emotional signaling across the full range of 
human emotions, the more adaptive his emotional patterns and the 
more these patterns serve as a highly adaptive instrument of "reason." 
If these transformations that emotions go through in the pathways 
leading to symbol formation are not appreciated, it is understandable 
why the traditional dualistic view of emotion and reason would persist. 
Our model shows them to be integrated and working together, though 
at varied levels from one individual to another. In other words, both 
during the course of evolution and in the life of each individual, emo­
tions were and are transformed to new levels of organization. At their 
highest levels, they operate in complex, adaptive patterns that orches­
trate and define our intelligence.

I NTEGRATES THE D I FFERENT 
PROCESSING AREAS OF THE MIND 
In addition to integrating subsymbolic and symbolic systems, emotions 
also foster and integrate such capacities as attention and sequencing, 
visual-spatial thinking, language, and sensory modulation. As we said, in 
various types of developmental and learning disorders, including autism, 
antisocial behavior patterns, and various learning disabilities, this process 
may be compromised. Emotions begin their pivotal role by helping an in­
fant connect early sensory and motor patterns. For example, a baby turns 
toward the sound of his mother's voice in part because her voice is inter­
esting, pleasurable, and regulating. This sensory, affect, motor connection 
leads to patterns of engagement, purposeful communication, and shared 
social problem solving-all of which further integrate the infant and 
growing child's various "processing" capacities. Consider a few examples. 
Attention and Sequencing (Executive Functions) 
Our higher-level language and thinking, including theory of mind, are 
founded upon our basic abilities for attention and sequencing. Early 
ImpLications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive PsychoLogy 
261 
emotional interactions help a child learn to pay attention and plan and 
sequence actions, for example, executive functions. Many have won­
dered why we are seeing more children with attention and motor plan­
ning problems. One reason might be fewer opportunities for long 
chains of problem-solving interactions in child/caregiver relationships. 
The ability to carry out several action steps in a row, that is, to plan and 
sequence actions and, in that way, attend to and complete the task at 
hand, begins with simple reciprocal interactions. The emotional recog­
nition that one's actions can have an impact on someone else is the 
foundation for sequencing, that is, the ability to carry out many steps in 
a row where each one is related to the previous one. This is exactly what 
interactions are. Smiles lead to smiles, frowns to frowns, sounds to 
sounds, movement to movement. The harder it is for the child to con­
tinue a long chain of interaction, the more practice that child requires 
with long, regulated sequences of interactions. 
As a child graduates from simple interactions to more problem­
solving interactions, the ability to plan and sequence also improves be­
cause the child is now sequencing longer chains of emotional signaling. 
As a child learns to use ideas to regulate behavior, she can map out se­
quences with visual images and verbal ideas. As logical thinking comes 
in, the child can plan strategies for executing actions and consider the al­
ternatives. The entire system of planning and executing problem-solving 
strategies, though, depends on the child's ability to link many pieces of 
behavior together. 
The degree to which these patterns can be elaborated in different 
areas of life increases the degree to which the child can plan and execute 
actions and focus, attend, and solve problems in these different areas. 
For example, some children are very good at social negotiations, but not 
very good at fixing a toy, figuring out how to find a hidden object, 
dressing, or washing up. 
It would be useful to study caregiving patterns associated with differ­
ent abilities to attend and sequence. Our hypothesis would be that less 
reciprocal caregiving is associated with greater attentional and sequenc­
ing problems in children. Optimal attention and sequencing capacity 
would be associated with caregivers capable of long exchanges in many 
functional areas-for example, motor, language, visual-spatial, social­
and who tend to support the child's gradually increasing assertiveness. 
Such a caregiver would begin with a continuous response pattern, but 
gradually shift to a more intermittent pattern as the child became more 

262 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
self-sufficient. If the child is talking, the caregiver would gradually shift 
to letting the child say more and more before commenting or asking a 
question, even though the caregiver would be nodding rhythmically in 
a close emotional rapport all during the child's comments. 
Visual-Spatial Thinking 
Visual-spatial processing is obviously necessary for one's sense of direc­
tion and for feeling secure in relation to space. It is also vital for math 
and science reasoning, which involve spatial relations and seeing the "for­
est for the trees," or big-picture thinking, as well as for abstract thinking 
of any kind that requires "seeing" the whole pattern and how the parts fit 
into the whole. 
Hide-and-go-seek games, treasure hunts, and other search games 
strengthen this basic capacity. Take a child who goes on little nature 
hunts with her mom and dad. They explore the flowers, search for hid­
den toys, and find books around the house. All this is done with chatter 
or wordless signals back and forth. In this way, the child invests the spa­
tial world with meaning. A child with biologically very weak visual­
spatial processing skills will shy away from searching for a toy and will 
grow more frustrated because it won't be easy for her to search for 
things. She might go to a new house and get lost, but this problem im­
proves with more experience in visual-spatial tasks. A parent who says 
enthusiastically, "Let's find that toy! I know we can do it," or who picks 
a toy that makes a noise so that when he hides it, the child can hear the 
noise, can further the child's progress. The child receives two sensory 
inputs-seeing where the toy might be and hearing the noise. The plea­
sure the child feels with each success fuels the progress. 
The worse the processing ability, the more problem-solving interac­
tions are needed. Take the example of a child who can't see. She needs a 
picture of her world, but it will have to be a "picture" through other 
senses. Even though she doesn't have sight, the child can still be a good 
visual-spatial thinker. With toys that make noises or emit smells or pro­
vide interesting touches, and through exploratory trips around the 
room, the child will respond to a parent who says, "We're on the right 
track! We're heading there!" There are many members of the animal 
kingdom who work by sound or smell. They develop very good spatial 
road maps. 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
263 
For the hearing-impaired child, more visual, motor, and tactile sup­
port is needed. This same principle applies to children who have trouble 
understanding the spatial dimensions of their own bodies, for example, 
integrating their left and right sides. Here, too, back-and-forth emo­
tional interactions involving the human body, games such as "touch my 
nose and I'll touch your nose," facilitate body-oriented visual-spatial 
problem solving. 
For the active, inattentive child, attention will be mastered with longer 
and longer chains of interaction, coupled with modulation patterns in 
which a caregiver changes the rhythm of interaction or the intensity of re­
sponse. Clearly the more salient the content of these responses, the more 
these skills become integrated into the child's cognitive abilities. 
Sensory Modulation 
The ability to modulate or regulate sensations is also critical. Some chil­
dren (and adults) hold their ears and get overwhelmed with sound; others 
are sensitive to touch and get overloaded. Others still are underreactive. If 
you watch these who are oversensitive, you see that they panic easily and 
are overwhelmed. Those who can regulate their sensations remain in con­
trol, turn down the stereo, and say, "Shhh, it's too noisy in here." The 
more they move from catastrophic patterns to regulated interactive pat­
terns, the more adaptive they become. The more dysregulated the sensory 
system, the more regulation and soothing is needed through emotional 
interactions. Some caregivers just naturally fall into the pattern of reading 
the child's signals and helping the child. Others overwhelm the child's 
system. Some educators tailor their responses to the child's individual dif­
ferences, toning their voices down for the child who's covering his ears. 
Others confront the child and engage in power struggles. They make the 
noise louder and overwhelm the child, and they often believe the child is 
just "being manipulative." The more the caregiver creates opportunities 
for sensitive emotional interaction, the better the child learns to regulate 
and to engage in self-calming. 
When we put children who are very sensory overreactive into such in­
teractions, they do not remain at the mercy of catastrophic affects. When 
people are anxious and in a panic state, everything bothers them. They 
can't sleep at night. They hear that little noise outside. They hear the 
trucks loading and unloading. They're in a heightened state of vigilance. 

264 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Terrorism can put an entire country in the vigilant state, where many 
people are more overreactive. At any age, soothing interactions help a 
person go from catastrophic emotions to a more regulated state. 
Symbolization with All the Senses 
We have been describing the process of forming symbols predominantly 
from the point of view of a visual symbol, that is, an image, that ac­
quires meaning as perception is separated from action through emo­
tional interchanges and problem solving. This process, however, occurs, 
or we should say, can occur via each sensory pathway. As it occurs 
through a particular sensory pathway, the individual is able to symbolize 
that realm of experience. As it occurs through all the sensory pathways, 
the symbols that are formed become integrated, multisensory, emo­
tional symbols. If, however, only certain pathways become involved, the 
development of symbols is uneven; for example, a person can symbolize 
what he sees, but not what he hears or vice versa. 
If development is proceeding well, each realm of experience related to 
specific sensory, emotional, and motor skills can become involved in inti­
mate exchanges. For example, toddlers can exchange gestures, looks, and 
glances to express different emotions using primarily what they see. In the 
auditory-verbal realm, a toddler also, in all likelihood, is gesturing with vo­
calizations. Just as her facial expressions, body posture changes, and motor 
gestures convey intent, her vocalizations can be used in this way. Eventu­
ally, as she uses words, her words can be used to signal intent and respond 
to another person's overtures. As the vocal-verbal system becomes part of 
continuous interaction, the tendency for perceptions processed through 
this system to be tied to immediate action (hearing a sound and reacting 
immediately with actions, such as attacking, fleeing, or avoiding) can be 
replaced with registering the sound, holding it in mind, and using it as a 
signal or basis for additional mental operations. Just like the visual image, 
the sound and/or word not tied to immediate action can then acquire 
more meanings through experience and become a full-fledged symbol. 
Olfactory experiences involving various types and degrees of smell 
can undergo a similar process whereby, rather than serving as a stimulus 
for immediate action, they come to serve a signal function and have 
meanings associated with them. 
ImpLications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive PsychoLogy 
265 
Motor experience itself, the experience of one's body moving in space 
and carrying out sequences of actions, can undergo this same process. 
As it becomes used more and more in interpersonal exchanges, the ex­
perience of movement does not necessarily lead to further immediate 
movement (just as, for example, an athletic thrust towards the goal line 
in a football game simply leads to immediate acceleration). Instead, as 
movement becomes more regulated, and modulated, we see the mar­
velous feats of great athletes who seem to choreograph movements mid­
stream, stopping short, moving to the left or right, and circumventing 
the opposition. Human beings have an enormous capacity for elevating 
movement out of the realm of automatic action and into the realm of 
planned sequences. In fact, we would argue that the ability to plan and 
sequence complex actions is related to the basic ability to use actions in 
a co-regulated reciprocal problem-solving manner and then elevate it to 
the level of symbolizing actions. 
Visual-spatial experiences that go beyond the registration of affective 
and motor gestures and involve motor planning and complex problem 
solving also undergo a similar process. Typical toddler tasks, such as 
searching for the hidden toy, finding her mommy in a different room, 
copying shapes, and the like, can become part of varying degrees of co­
regulated problem-solving interactions. Consider the difference be­
tween a child who lines up her toys or does the same puzzles over and 
over again and, in that way, carries out very stereotyped visual-spatial 
problem-solving tasks; compare that child to one who engages her fa­
ther in a back-and-forth problem-solving adventure in building a city 
Out of blocks. In building the city with blocks, father and child interact 
in a back-and-forth way, figuring our new visual-spatial constructions. 
Here, too, rather than engaging in fixed visual-spatial problem-solving 
sequences, they operate in a flexible and creative manner, mediated ini­
tially through co-regulated, reciprocal visual-spatial interchanges. Ulti­
mately, such a child has the ability to create on her own, perhaps 
becoming a gifted architect. 
The pathway to symbolization and ultimately creative and reflective 
endeavors in each realm of the senses depends on this early experience 
of interchanges with others. It's difficult, if not impossible, to achieve 
these skills just by practicing them oneself with the inanimate world. 
Although some degree of mastery might be achieved this way, it won't 
have the same creative richness as when a reciprocal partner is involved. 

266 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Interestingly, when we look at visual-spatial experiences and motor 
coordination and planning experiences, we observe that some children, 
neurologically, have the tendency more towards fixed patterns. Some 
children, for example, retain some of their primitive reflexes and when 
they look right or left, they have to turn their bodies. They are unable to 
move their eyes without moving their heads, or move their heads with­
out moving their bodies. With practice, however, they can learn to sepa­
rate these actions and develop more adaptive motor strategies. Because 
of their neurological challenges, these children require even more op­
portunities for emotional interactions in which they can learn to use 
their motor and visual-spatial capacities in highly responsive and subtle 
ways. Adaptation demands a flexible system that can respond in a nu­
anced manner to its environment (rather than in a fixed, more global 
manner). One might argue, as we have in the chapter on evolution and 
primates, that the ability to engage the environment in a flexible, nu­
anced, reciprocal manner is what has separated human beings from 
nonhuman primates and other mammals. Most can engage in some in­
teractions involving gross motor activities and even some visual-spatial 
problem solving, but most do not have the capacity to exchange subtle 
emotional signals, maintain long chains of problem-solving interaction, 
and include a range of vocal signals as part of the process. In fact, as we 
argued earlier, human beings have far greater capacities for subtle tex­
tures of emotional signaling than even their nearest cousin. 
Typically, during early development, and fortunately so, human tod­
dlers are using all the skills described above-motor, visual-spatial, visual, 
auditory-verbal-in their daily relationships with adults. For example, in 
trying to ask for juice, or in flirting with a parent, the toddler is likely to 
flash a big smile, look a little needy, tug at the parent's hand, pull him 
towards the refrigerator, bang on the door, vocalize "j-j-j," and point to 
the juice. For their part, parents are likely responding with motor, visual, 
and vocal signals. Together, they're engaged in a complex, multisensory, 
emotional, motor-processing pattern of exchanges. In healthy families, 
these exchanges are continuously taking place so smoothly and effort­
lessly that they go largely unnoticed. Perceptual-action patterns give way 
to exchanges of symbols, and the participation of all the senses renders 
the symbols rich and many-faceted. We tend to take this integration of 
experience involved in symbol formation for granted; it seems simply a 
part of our nature to combine words, visual images, and motor actions. 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
267 
For many, however, the process doesn't occur in this optimal fashion. For 
example, children with delays or challenges in one sensory realm or an­
other may be able to elevate one sense to the symbolic level but not 
another and, therefore, experience uneven development. Many adults, for 
example, can use visual images symbolically, but not auditory-verbal 
ones; some adults, although highly verbal, easily get lost on their way to 
the bathroom. In working with children with autistic spectrum disorders 
and other special-needs conditions, as well as with children experiencing 
severe learning disabilities, we have found that the key to enabling them 
to make significant progress is to help them elevate the processing skill 
that is delayed or challenged into the realm of emotional interaction, and 
through this interaction into the realm of symbols. 
The process we are describing doesn't occur largely through a pre­
scribed and genetically mediated set of biological events. The biological 
events, to be sure, create a substrate. Highly complex experiences in­
volving all the senses, such as those we have been describing, are neces­
sary. These experiences involve all the senses in a critical step, that is, 
co-regulated, reciprocal, affective interchanges. 
From Attention and Engagement to Symbol Formation: 
How Emotions Organize the Diferent Parts of the 
Mind at Each Level of Development 
As we have been describing, symbols are formed for each type of sensory 
experience and motor capacity. We have also been describing how emo­
tions develop through stages or steps. They move from simple expres­
sions of annoyance, discomfort, and pleasure to complex emotional 
interactions involving empathy and mixtures of feelings, such as love 
and respect. As emotions are transformed from one stage to the next, 
they also organize a growing infant's and child's basic capacities to com­
prehend their sensory and motor experiences, that is, to take in and 
comprehend (process) sights, sounds, and movements, and to modulate 
sensation. As each new level of emotional (affective) transformation oc­
curs, the child's basic capacity to take in and comprehend sensations be­
comes organized at a higher level. 
For example, consider how the child organizes what he or she sees. 
Initially, the affective interest in the outer world enables the child to 

268 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
look at the caregiver's face and begin recognizing distinct features, such 
as a nose or mouth. Synchronous movements with caregivers, and the 
growing interest in the outer world this facilitates, enable the infant to 
begin using her senses-hearing, seeing, and movement {turning)-in 
coordinated ways. This occurs over time with greater and greater flexi­
bility, for example, turning the head without moving the whole body 
and, eventually, looking only with the eyes. By the second stage, the 
child invests particular images with specific emotions-for example, she 
invests her mommy's face with pleasure and joy. The pleasure and joy 
with the caregiver facilitates an emotional investment in constructing a 
picture of what will become a whole face and, eventually, a whole per­
son, imbued not just with visual images but with a whole range of feel­
ings and experiences. It is this pleasure and joy that motivates the 
construction of a more complete set of images because it indicates a live 
"other" outside oneself that's bringing such nice feelings to oneself By 
the third and fourth stages, the child is emotionally able to explore val­
ued objects in space by using purposeful back-and-forth emotionally 
mediated movements to judge distance and even to discover that what's 
temporarily out of sight still exists. Such cognitive feats depend on re­
ciprocal affective signals and motor gestures that create the foundation 
for the cause-and-effect exploration of the physical world. By the fourth 
stage, the infant can crawl and then walk to Mom across the room, take 
Daddy by the hand to find a favorite toy, recognize and feel a sense of 
warmth and security when seeing Mommy smiling and nodding in ap­
proval from across the room. The initial construction of space, a room 
in a house, or a playground in the neighborhood, is through the cre­
ation of a spatial road map based on multiple co-regulated, reciprocal 
emotional interactions-rich emotional experiences-in different 
spaces. In other words, the child creates a spatial map based on his or 
her ability for engaging in emotional multiple problem-solving interac­
tions with others and with objects in the different spaces of his world. 
The first picture of his spatial world is an affective one because the child 
invests his experience of what he sees with his desires and feelings. 
By the fifth and sixth stages, the child, while continuing these com­
plex emotional interactions, learns to create symbols or ideas made up 
of visual-spatial images based on wishes, desires, or affects. For example, 
she can make a corral for play horses or a special tea room for a tea 
party. Higher-level reflective visual-spatial thinking, such as coming up 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
269 
with a new design for a magical doll house that can change into a castle, 
will otten follow; later on, it may include creating new concepts in math 
or physics. All these capacities are based on origins involving affective 
investment of space at higher and higher levels of organization. 
The ability to plan and sequence actions also becomes transformed. 
Initially, the rhythmic, synchronous coordination of movement be­
tween the infant and caregiver, as well as the rhythmic, synchronous co­
ordination between the caregiver's voice and the infant's movements 
(and later vocalizations), creates a relationship between the infant and 
the outer world. Over time, these motor-mediated, synchronous actions 
convey shared affects, such as pleasure. The infant's ability to use his 
motor system to relate to the outside world enables him to go from the 
first steps involving turning and looking to find the caregiver's voice to a 
second step involving searching out the person who gives pleasure and 
organizing the facial muscles into a big smile to a third step involving 
two and three actions in a row, such as reaching for the toy on 
Mommy's head and offering it back to her. In a fourth step, the toddler 
goes to even more complex feats, such as pointing at Daddy as he walks 
in the door, running up to him, taking his hat and putting it on, and 
then gleefully putting it on Mommy (a four-to-five-sequence action 
plan involving considerable motor planning under the guidance of 
emotions, such as curiosity and assertiveness). As the child learns to cre­
ate symbols to express desires and feelings, he or she can now plan novel 
action sequences to solve new problems, for example, figuring out how 
to build a new Lego house that will serve as a good hiding place for the 
princess fleeing from the evil dragon. At subsequent stages, children can 
use their fertile imaginations to create even more complex action plans 
to solve a variety of challenges, such as creating a new invention to clean 
up their toys. 
Language and the comprehension of sounds also goes through this 
type of sequence. For example, sound and language are initially ex­
pressed through synchronous vocalizations as part of the first stage, self­
regulation. They then become part of an expression of pleasure as the 
baby responds with joyful sounds to the caregiver's pleasurable vocaliza­
tions (now part of the expression of a specific set of emotions). At the 
third level, vocalizations become more purposeful and part of two-way, 
back-and-forth, reciprocal interchanges. A variety of reciprocal vocaliza­
tions reflect not only the baby's growing ability to make more sounds 

270 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
(and process more sounds) but also the desire, mediated through affects, 
to communicate different needs, feelings, and interests. Why else would 
the baby use the different sounds, or later, the words she can make? In 
fact, as discussed, children with autism only begin using sounds and 
words meaningfully and with grammatically correct sequences after 
we've helped them learn to experience and express their affects and de­
sires in a purposeful manner-for example, they will push us from the 
door they're persevering to open or close with a "Go away, Daddy." By 
the fourth level, they're involved in long chains of back-and-forth prob­
lem-solving interactions (co-regulated, reciprocal, affective exchanges). 
These exchanges can be perceived as patterns, some of which constitute 
the baby's own beginning idiosyncratic language that he can use, for ex­
ample, as part of back-and-forth affective interchanges to communicate 
specific needs and desires. Eventually, these patterns can be used to con̤ 
struct words, which also can be used as part of back-and-forth inter­
changes ("Juice!"). At the fifth and sixth stages, the child can express his 
wishes and feelings symbolically in words or pretend play, and eventu­
ally create logical and abstract verbal concepts. 
In a similar fashion, at each level of affect transformation, the child 
learns to modulate sensations more effectively. For example, as she be­
comes emotionally invested in the outer world and engaged in her first 
pleasurable relationship, the baby is no longer at the mercy of her own 
catastrophic affects when being overloaded. There is now a soothing 
partner who can help calm her. Over time, her soothing partner can help 
her engage in affective exchanges, which enable the "up-" and "down­
regulating" of affective stateٔ and the maintenance of a more modulated 
pattern of reaction and mood. For example, as the child becomes excited, 
Dad's voice becomes more soothing and he mellows and softens his re­
sponsive gestures rather than intensifies or speeds them up (he helps the 
toddler to "down-regulate"). In other words, the toddler and his care­
giver are now dance partners where the caregiver can help maintain a 
more regulated rhythm of interaction. As the toddler creates symbols and 
expresses feelings, she can label and describe the feelings associated with 
different states of sensory arousal and, eventually, not just regulate but 
plan ways to create desired states. For example, now the child can say, 
"Let's play some soothing music" or "I need a back rub." 
As can be seen, the child is transforming each of these processing ca­
pacities into higher and higher levels of organization. In addition, the 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
27 1 
child tends to engage in these developmental levels, up to the highest 
one of which he is capable, at the same time. By looking, listening, relat­
ing' gesturing, solving problems, using ideas, and thinking all at the 
same time, the child is connecting the developmental levels of experience 
together. The child is also connecting or integrating all his capacities for 
information processing. In daily life, the child tends to use sight, sounds, 
movements, and sensory and emotional modulating capacities together. 
For example, when she is involved in lots of co-regulated, reciprocal ex­
changes, the child is often gesturing with motor actions, vocalizing, siz­
ing up what she sees, and co-regulating her state of arousal with her 
caregivers. As these occur together, the child is connecting or integrating 
her different ways of taking in and comprehending sensations and plan­
ning actions (information processing domains). Therefore, appropriate 
interactive experiences enable the child to connect all her processing do­
mains together at the same time she's organized them at higher and 
higher levels of emotional transformation and organization. In other 
words, rich interactive experiences help the child connect the different 
parts of her mind horizontally (across all the processing domains) and 
vertically (at the different levels of developmental organization). 
In contrast, children with special needs may, for biological reasons, 
have uneven ways of processing sensation and, therefore, have special 
difficulties in connecting or integrating all the ways they take in and un­
derstand information about the world. This is a problem that we see as 
especially prominent in autistic spectrum disorders, where it's hard for 
the children to integrate their emotions with their motor planning and 
sequencing capacities; therefore, it's hard for them to connect all their 
processing capacities together. That's why, in our treatment program for 
children with autism, we have created special experiences that support 
the connection between affect and the different processing capacities, as 
we mentioned earlier. 
Children with special needs, however, often are unable to engage 
Spontaneously and fully at all the developmental levels and with all the 
"processing" domains. In general, we have found that children with 
special needs do best when their interactive partners figure out what 
types of interactions and what levels of emotional interaction and types 
of information processing are particularly difficult and make a special 
effort to engage these areas as well as the ones that are more readily a 
part of the interaction. We try to inspire the child to look and listen to 

272 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
us, relate with pleasure, exchange emotional gestures, solve problems, 
and use ideas and words-at the same time. We also challenge him to 
look, listen, comprehend, and plan actions at the same time we are 
helping him connect his processing domains. 
In summary, in human interaction and all types of human learning, 
it's most useful to be engaging and interactive at all the developmental 
levels we have been describing. These include the following: 
1 .  Basic regulation and modulation, which often include taking in sensa­
tions and connecting sensations, affect, and motor patterns (e.g., turning 
toward a pleasurable voice), as well as rhythmic and timed synchronous 
motor gestures at a covert level (infants can readily be observed moving 
their arms and legs in rhythm with their caregivers' movements and 
voices as part of this basic level of interaction). 
2. Pleasurable affective engagement and a growing, shared sense of human­
ity with another person. 
3. Back-and-forth (reciprocal) affective and motor gesturing that convey 
intentions, needs, or desires. 
4. Long chains of co-regulated, reciprocal, problem-solving interactions 
that define a sense of "self" and "other" and enable the child to con­
struct and understand patterns and negotiate and further regulate be­
havior, mood, and attention. 
5. The creation of symbols that represent the experiences and "meanings" 
of all the previous levels and can now be used for symbolic interaction 
and the construction of new and creative levels of experience. 
6. The building of bridges between symbols to create the capacity for logi­
cal thinking and higher levels of reflective and abstract reasoning; this 
includes the capacity for testing reality, separating reality from fantasy, 
and organizing a sense of "self" and "other" at higher and higher levels 
involving a broad range of symbolic and presymbolic experiences. 
It's useful to harness all the sensory processing domains at the same 
time, as well. These include: 
1. Auditory processing and language 
2. Visual-spatial processing 
3. Motor planning and sequencing 
4. Sensory modulation

H OW EMOTIONAL SIGNALING MAY INCREASE 
NEURONAL CONNECTIONS IN THE B RAIN 
As the developmental processes we have been describing are occurring, 
it's interesting to note the likely parallel going on in the way the brain is 
growing. Parts of the brain register sensations and experience (looking 
or listening), and other parts of the brain organize experiences into pat­
terns. These include the parts of the brain that connect perceptions with 
the parts that sequence actions with the parts that generate and regulate 
emotions or affects. Development proceeds to include the higher corti­
cal centers that symbolize and interpret experience and enable further 
planning and anticipation as well as the creation of new experiences and 
imagery. From our clinical observations, it appears that emotional or af­
fective transformations serve as organizers of the central nervous system. 
They create connections between the lower and higher brain centers 
and coordinate the parts dealing with the registration of experience with 
the parts that plan and sequence actions and the parts that symbolize 
and interpret experience. (The chart below shows some of the parallels 
between the six basic stages of emotional or affective transformation 
and the growth of the brain.)

emotional relating, expressiveness, and 
signaling (i.e., parietal, temporal, primary 
visual cortical regions, frontal eye fields, 
basal ganglia, cerebellar hemispheres, 
beginning of cerebral cortex as well as 
continuation oflimbic system). 
As the baby processes patterns and 
initiates more selective responses to 
environmenral clues, growth in areas 
that support sequencing and reading and 
expressing gestures and emotion (rwo-way 
communication) are more active (i.e., 
increases in frontal cortex, including 
dorsal prefrontal areas). 
Cerebral cortex is more active and 
continues so. Left-sided neuronal 
branching surges as toddler sequences 
sounds and occasional word(s) to 
ptoblem-solve. Right-sided growth 
continues together with the ability 
to figure out larger patterns in the world 
and inreract with a wider range of 
emotions. 
Left-sided neuronal branching becomes 
denser as child comprehends, uses, and 
sequences more words and masters some 
of the basics of grammar. The visual­
imaging partS of the brain grow as the 
child begins to engage more and more in 
pretend play. Both sides of the brain are 
becoming more specialized as language is 
rapidly being acquired. 
Brain undergoes growth spurt, 
metabolizing glucose (sugar) at rwice the 
adult rate. Increased activity occurs in 
areas of the brain that deal with the 
creation and comprehension of words, 
and connections among words. Increased 
activity continues throughout childhood 
and then gradually shifts to adult rate. 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
275 
In our view, emotional signaling, which separates perception from ac­
tion and leads to the formation of symbols, also fosters the growth of 
new or better functioning pathways in the brain. There is considerable 
evidence for this hypothesis. A body of research in the neurosciences 
shows that experiences, especially early in life, but continuing through­
out life, influence the structure of the brain, especially neuronal connec­
tions and the chemical processes they involve. For example, in 2000, Eric 
Kandel of Columbia University won the Nobel Prize for his body of 
work revealing the changes that occur in neuronal connections as experi­
ence creates long-term memory. He showed how "experience" affects the 
regulator genes which, in turn, control gene expression and neuronal 
structure. 10 PET scans on adult musicians show that they have more 
neuronal connections in the area of the brain that controls the hand 
movements they use in playing their instruments. PET scans also show 
that emotionally meaningful experiences are associated with activity in 
many areas of the brain at the same time, in comparison to impersonal 
cognitive tasks, which are associated with fewer areas of the brain. Gree­
nough's well-known research with animalsl l  shows a direct connection 
between specific types of "enriched" experience and greater connections 
between neurons in areas of the brain related to that experience. Remark­
able research shows that enriched experiences can help an area of the 
brain that typically is used for one function to be used for another. 12 For 
example, the visual center can be used for language if the language cen­
ters have been removed. These are only a few examples of the growing 
body of evidence pointing to a relationship between "experience" and the 
physical structure of the brain. 
These emerging findings in neuroscience research prompt one to 
consider what would happen to neuronal connections if each new gen­
eration of children had more opportunities than the previous one for 
exchanging emotionally meaningful sounds and sights and movement 
patterns. This would not involve rote sensory stimulation, but only 
meaningful, pleasurable, well-regulated interactions. Would each gener­
ation develop more connections in critical areas of the brain within the 
range of their existing genetic potential? Of course, we have no way of 
knowing the upper limits of an individual's genetic range unless we cre­
ate an infinite number of environments to tease out the top of this 
range. Since we can't do this impossible experiment, it's reasonable to as­
sume from current evidence that during prehistoric times early men and 

276 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
women had more range than they were using. Today, we likely have 
more range than we are using. It's also reasonable to assume that during 
the course of evolution (and, currently, over long time intervals), our 
cultural practices-including child-rearing practices-involving the ex­
change of ever more complex emotional and meaningful signals, sights 
and sounds, and movements have been and are improving (with ex­
pectable, short-term vacillations). Have these practices, which improve 
the quality and variety of experiences, lead to expectable changes in the 
physical structure of the brain? Will such improvement continue? 
There is no evidence that such physical changes, if they have been oc­
curring, become encoded in our genes. Rather, to the degree they occur, 
they depend on each generation's having access to critical learning expe­
riences. If these learning experiences keep improving in the adaptive, 
balanced, regulated way described earlier-that is, .not simply stimulat­
ing memory-we may gradually be able to improve our critical intellec­
tual, emotional, and social skills. As long as favorable cultural and 
child-rearing practices continue, we may see the development of greater 
neuronal connections in the critical areas of the brain that support these 
skills. If, because of a change in family patterns or exposure to toxic 
chemicals that affect the nervous system and learning, vital interactive 
learning experiences stop or become compromised, we may very well 
see movement in the reverse direction. 
What are the parts of the brain most likely influenced by emotional 
signaling? Our hypothesis is the following: Emotional signaling initially 
supports increased neuronal connections in a number of areas (e.g., the 
cerebellum because it deals with rhythmicity and timing), but especially 
the prefrontal cortex because this area is directly involved in planning 
and sequencing actions, problem solving, and emotional regulation. The 
prefrontal cortex can, in turn, support longer and more complex patterns 
of sequencing and thus become better adapted to solving problems. Over 
time, meaningful emotional "experience" of this type and improved neu­
ronal connections probably facilitate each other in an adaptive cyclical 
process. 
The development of the prefrontal cortex and its functions, includ­
ing emotional regulation and signaling, also supports symbol forma­
tion. Symbol formation, in turn, may lead to neuronal connections in 
the area of the cortex involved with different types of symbols. For ex­
ample, the increasing use of visual images and symbols to solve visual-
ImpLications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive PsychoLogy 
277 
spatial problems likely leads to increasing connections between neurons 
in these cortical areas. Consttucting and using auditory-verbal symbols 
likely leads to increasing neuronal connections in the language areas of 
the cortex. Similar processes likely occur for touch, smell, taste, move­
ment, and emotions. 
Symbols are often used together. As this occurs, we would expect to 
see increasing neuronal connections between different symbolic cortical 
areas. In fact, as we explained earlier, we believe our emotions mediate 
the connections between different types of experiences and, therefore, 
between many different areas of the central nervous system. 
Even before symbols are formed to a significant degree, however, the 
higher cortical centers for such skills as language, visual-spatial process­
ing, and motor planning are probably already being supported (through 
increased connections between neurons) because of the nature of emo­
tional signaling. These often involve clusters of sounds and motor ges­
tures, touch, smell, and the negotiation of space (through vision). As 
these multisensory emotional signals are used for more elaborate prob­
lem solving, the child begins to decipher "patterns" and expectations. As 
these patterns of sounds, sights, and other sensory experiences are 
constructed, they would likely be supporting neuronal connections in 
the cortical areas concerned with pattern recognition, and vice versa. 
These developments likely precede what will occur as a result of symbol 
formation. 
We would, therefore, hypothesize that emotional signaling, and the 
pattern recognition and problem solving it facilitates, is involved in inte­
grating the pathways of the central nervous system including subsym­
bolic systems and cortical symbolic systems. 
As we mentioned earlier, emotional signaling also likely involves con­
nections between the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex as well as 
other areas. Signaling with regard to positive emotions may involve con­
nections with the left prefrontal cortex. Signaling with regard to nega­
tive emotions may involve connections with the right prefrontal cortex. 
The degree of these connections may contribute to a person's ability to 
Use positive and negative emotions to signal and, in turn, to modulate, 
make discriminations, and to represent as well as to reason about nega­
tive and positive emotions. 
Furthermore, we would hypothesize that those species that evidence 
greater ability to use emotional signals in problem solving have a more 

278 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
developed prefrontal cortex and more connections between the pre­
frontal cortex and limbic system and other areas. 
RESEARCH SUPPORT FROM 
COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE 
Recent neuroscience research supports elements of the theory we have 
been presenting. An important part of this theory is that the infant uses 
emotions to explore the world and that she double codes experience. 
She codes it according to both its visceral affective or emotional proper­
ties and its cognitive properties (which also involve affective aspects). 
Although Joseph LeDoux suggests the more traditional dualistic pic­
ture of emotions and conscious reasoning ability, 13 some of his specific 
research findings support the theory we are proposing. He has shown 
that when the emotion of fear is processed by the amygdala, which is 
part of the limbic system, the perception travels from the thalamus 
(where the perception is first registered) to the amygdala in 0. 1 5  mil­
liseconds. For the perception to travel from the thalamus to the cortex, 
however, it takes 0.25 milliseconds. According to LeDoux, this explains 
why we may react emotionally with fear to seeing a snake more quickly 
than we can become consciously aware of what we are reacting to. In 
other words, we feel scared before we know why or can find ideas or 
words to express it to ourselves and others. There are also more path­
ways from the limbic system to the cortex than from the cortex to the 
limbic system, suggesting that emotions such as fear influence thinking 
more than thinking influences emotions. 
This research on the primacy of the emotional pathway to "knowing" 
at a subsymbolic or subcortical level supports a major hypothesis in the 
theory we are presenting. It also supports our theory of the "double 
code."14 Because emotional pathways are faster and more direct, they 
become, as we said, the director or orchestra leader or architect of our 
cognitive capacities. Therefore, in healthy development these emotional 
pathways have a direct and rapid influence, but do not influence cog­
nition in the way LeDoux and others suggest. As we have discussed, 
emotions do not have to conflict with reason or logic. As they become 
transformed into emotional signals through co-regulated interactions, 
emotions can guide cognition. They can integrate different aspects of 
the mind and serve as its orchestra leader. 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
279 
Further support comes from the work of Jocelyne H. Bachevalier, 
Ph.D., who has shown that procedural or implicit memory, which in­
volves subsymbolic emotional systems, functions very shortly after birth, 
but declarative or explicit memory, which involves symbolic cortical pro­
cesses and conscious awareness, gradually starts operating by four years 
of age. 15 Therefore, as we have been proposing, subsymbolic emotional 
systems are operative in the early months and years of life and symbolic 
cortical processes become operative relatively later. What has not been re­
alized before, however, is how these subsymbolic emotional pathways 
can be used to "know and learn" from the world. We have been empha­
sizing how, as the infant learns to use her emotions as signals, she trans­
forms her emotions into modulated tools of knowing and learning way 
before symbols are formed. They enable her to "double code" informa­
tion, construct patterns, solve problems, form a presymbolic self, and 
over time develop higher and higher levels of intelligence. 
Using brain imaging studies, Richard J. Davidson, Ph.D., has shown 
that the left prefrontal cortex "may be important in inhibiting activity 
in the amygdala and dampening response to negative emotional events, 
and particularly in shutting off the negative response quickly once it has 
been activated."16 This would support our hypothesis that the pre­
frontal cortex is important for the type of emotional signaling that can 
regulate catastrophic or extreme emotions, as well as our hypothesis that 
such signaling involves pathways that integrate the prefrontal cortex and 
the limbic system. 
Mary Carlson, Ph.D., has conducted research that reveals important 
findings about the importance of early emotional interactions for cogni­
tive and social development,l7 She shows that touch and emotional nur­
turing support healthy development and that their absence undermines 
it. She also shows that the deprivation of needed emotional relation­
ships and interactions undermines healthy development and that chil­
dren cared for by parents who used state-run daycare showed similar 
patterns as children in depriving orphanage settings. This suggests that 
interferences in emotional nurturing interactions and regulation do not 
have to be as extreme as has been seen in some orphanages. 
For example, Carlson found that human touch and interaction were 
vital to keeping infant monkeys from developing autistic behaviors. 
They were also vital for the development of sensory, motor, and mem­
ory pathways and the functioning of hormonal systems that regulate 
stress responses. In addition she found that:

When we compared the levels of cortisol in the two institutional groups 
to that of family-reared children, we saw that both institutional groups 
had abnormally suppressed cortisol levels in the morning. When chil­
dren's cortisol levels at each time of day were correlated with their behav­
ioral development, we found that those with the highest morning levels 
showed the best performance on motor and mental tests. 
At later times of day, when cortisol should be low or almost unde­
tectable, the most deprived children-the control group-showed signif­
icantly more elevated cortisol levels at noon compared to the intervention 
group. High cortisol levels at noon and in the evening in both of the in­
stitutional groups were associated with poor mental and motor perfor­
mance. Cortisol levels measured by parents at home on weekends were 
similar to those of American children. 
The most surprising and disturbing finding came from measuring the 
cortisol levels of family-reared children while they were in the bleak and 
highly structured context of their state-run day care. We found abnor­
malities similar to those seen in orphanages, and again those with abnor­
mally elevated levels in day care were the ones who had the lowest 
behavioral scores. 
These findings, plus studies of children who experienced the Armen­
ian earthquake and adults suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, 
offer evidence of the relationships between abnormal cortisol secretion, 
hippocampal shrinkage, and related memory deficits. 
Clearly, the social networks in which children grow up bear on the 
development of the neural networks that mediate memory, emotion, 
and self 
In a study of American children in daycare, Megan Gunnar, Ph.D., of 
the University of Minnesota Institute for Child Development, found that 
they had higher cortisol levels (and stress-related behaviors) in the late af­
ternoon than home-reared children.18 Catastrophic emotions are associ­
ated with high levels of stress, which alters cortisol patterns. Regulated, 
interactive patterns of emotional signaling, in contrast, enable individuals 
to cope with and reduce stress and to negotiate and explore solutions. 
When a child does not learn how to regulate and signal with her emotions 
she may, therefore, be vulnerable to problems at the behavioral, cognitive, 
social, and hormonal levels. This type of dysregulation often has a nega­
tive impact on long-term development.

Bachevalier found that neuronal pathways involved in conscious or 
explicit memory are also affected by abnormal cortisol patterns, and if 
these patterns are compromised they can have a delayed long-term neg­
ative effect on deveiopment. 19 
Three additional studies on early development also provide a high de­
gree of support for our emotion-based model of symbolic thinking. Lois 
Bloom and Joanne Bitetti Capatides studied causal meanings in children 
between twenty-six and thirty-eight months of age. Children's initial sym­
bolic expressions of causality were related to social and emotional psycho­
logical phenomena more than to impersonal physical phenomena or 
events.20 Another study of mothers' responses to the emotional expres­
sions of children between nine and twenty-one months of age showed 
that mothers who responded to their children's emotional expressions in a 
reciprocal or interactive manner and tended to respond to the child's un­
derlying intentions, and the situation or context, as well as to what the 
toddler might do to change the situation provided a rich experience in es­
tablishing symbolic meanings.21 
A study of the parents of children with autism, by Michael Siller and 
Marian Sigman, found that caregivers of children with autism who were 
more responsive in their synchronization and continued interaction dur­
ing play with their children enabled them to develop better language and 
"joint attention" over a period of one, ten, and sixteen years than did 
children of caregivers who were less emotionally responsive and interac­
tive.22 Even though autism has clear biological basis, there is evidence 
that children with autism are sensitive to their emotional environments. 
Interestingly, we have found that children with a range of biologically 
based "processing difficulties" and special needs are especially sensitive to 
their environments because their biology makes it hard for them to pro­
cess and regulate sensations and to plan actions; they depend on their en­
vironments, that is, their caregivers, to help them learn these skills. As we 
have discussed, we have found that an "affect" -based developmental ap­
proach can help these children gradually learn how to relate, interact, sig­
nal, think, and communicate.23 
As can be seen, cultural and family practices lead to high levels of 
emotional, intellectual, language, and problem-solving capacities. They 
can also likely lead to changes in the physical structure of the brain. 
Experience-based learning and physical changes in the brain tend to 
support each other. Both depend on vital cultural and family-mediated

interactions that have enabled us since prehuman times to develop and 
sustain our vital capacity for emotional signaling. 
THE MISSING LINK IN PIAGET' S 
THEORY OF COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT 
As we examine the role of emotional signaling, it becomes more evident 
that Piaget, the pioneer of modern cognitive psychology, didn't suffi­
ciently explore the most important element in thinking-the role of af­
fect. While Piaget was interested in children's imaginations and pretend 
play and the parallels between emotional and cognitive development, he 
did not fully observe the critical role of affect in the pathways leading to 
intelligence. We have found that affect is vital for understanding all lev-: 
els of thinking as well as brain development. 
Affect is also crucial in trying to understand the processes that enable 
a child to construct progressively more complex mental operations that 
enable her to understand her world. As we have been demonstrating, 
progressively more complex modulated emotional signaling is a vital 
factor in these developmental processes.24 
Let's examine Jean Piaget's comprehensive theory of cognitive devel­
opment and explore its missing components. Piaget thought that the 
first steps in logic a baby mastered were means-ends relationships; that 
is, causal thinking at the level of sensory-motor interactions with the 
physical world. For example, a baby learned to pull a string to ring a 
bell. If one cut the string, the baby would stop pulling it because it 
didn't ring the bell. Piaget said that this showed that an eight- or nine­
month-old baby understood causality with what he called "means-ends 
relationships." What Piaget didn't understand was that causal thinking 
starts much earlier, when each time the baby smiles the mother smiles 
back. The first lessons in logic are not learned through motor actions, 
with one's arms interacting with the physical world, but through affec­
tive, emotional signals such as one's smiles and coos of delight and joy, 
and then further smiles or coos that lead to the caregiver's emotional re­
sponses. At every stage of development, these emotional interactions 
lead the way. 
Therefore, the first problem solving is not sensorimotor problem 
solving, as Piaget thought, but co-regulated, emotional interaction 
through the emotional system. In addition, meaningful symbol forma-

283 
tion (what Piaget called the "semiotic function") does not come about as 
an heir to sensorimotor processing, as Piaget postulated. As we de­
scribed earlier, it comes about because emotional interactions enable the 
child to separate perception from action. Freestanding perceptions be­
come invested with more and more emotional meaning. 
An emotion-based theory of intelligence, however, can incorporate 
important insights from Piaget's theory.25 Piaget brought the field of 
cognition to a more advanced plane by introducing a constructivist 
model. In this model, he emphasized that children learn through their 
own actions on the world (rather than passively). He described the par­
allel processes involved in cognitive and affective development but did 
not sufficiently explain the relationship between them. He was not 
aware of the observations or insights, as far as we can tell, that have led 
. us to conclude that emotions are the architect of intelligence. Piaget's 
work has influenced child care and education (not sufficiently) as well as 
research and theory development. 
Nonetheless, by focusing on external perceptual-motor behavior and 
later on perception, and by not fully appreciating the role of emotions­
for example, to consider aspects of their development but not as the in­
strument and architect of learning-Piaget missed a critical factor in hu­
man cognition. 
In Intelligence and Adaptation: An Integration of Psychoanalytic and 
Piagetian Developmental Psychology,26 Stanley Greenspan presented a 
model to conceptualize the emotional basis for cognition, along with its 
impersonal components, and suggested that such a model offers a much 
more complete theory of cognitive development. Since then, we have 
accumulated additional evidence for this position. We have observed 
that typically developing infants, infants with autism and various types 
of cognitive and learning deficits, and infants in high-risk environments 
(e.g., multiproblem families) all need to use emotions to learn about the 
world, and interactions that help them master early affective interac­
tions are especially helpfulP 
There is good reason for the infant's first using emotions to probe 
the world. The infant has control of her facial muscles before she can 
control her arm and hand muscles to make purposeful actions with 
them. The emotional expressions, therefore, become the first probes 
into the world and continue throughout life. The interactions that lead 
to symbol formation occur at the same time as the advanced stages of 
sensorimotor intelligence, as Piaget described. For each new cognitive 

284 
T H E F I RS T  I D EA 
structure, however, there are emotional interactions that lead the way. 
Emotionally learned "lessons" then become applied to the impersonal 
world. In other words, emotional knowledge of the world leads to 
principles that are applied to the impersonal world, rather than vice 
versa, as Piaget suggested. 
The emotional probes that the child uses to explore the world lead to 
cognitive capacities in many realms of experience, including verbal, 
visual-spatial, and motor. Interestingly, this model of cognition helps ac­
count for the unevenness of cognitive development that's been pointed 
out relative to different levels of experience. This fact is often pointed to 
in some critiques of Pia get's general model (e.g., why children with extra 
experience in certain areas, such as visual-spatial problem solving or ver­
bal problem solving, often do not fit with Piaget's hypotheses about a se­
quence of cognitive structures).28 We have observed that children differ 
in the degree of emotional interaction they have with caregivers in dif­
ferent processing realms (auditory, visual-spatial, perceptual-motor, 
tactile) as well as in their basic strengths in each processing realm and, 
therefore, in the relative development they attain in each processing 
realm. 
Therefore, there are differences not only between children but within 
each child in his different processing realms. 
H OW EMOTIONAL SI GNALING EXPLAINS 
PIAGET 'S CONCEPTS OF SYM B OLIC THINKING 
According to Piaget, the semiotic function involves the ability to repre­
sent something (a signified something: object, event, conceptual scheme) 
by means of a "signifier" that is differentiated and serves only a represen­
tative purpose: language, mental-image symbolic gestures, and so on.29 
Whereas in the sensorimotor period a thing could be represented by a 
part of itself (the mother's voice indicates the mother), symbols and signs 
are signifiers that are differentiated from their significants (e.g., the 
sound of a word or a visual design) and become available to the child 
with the appearance of the semiotic function.3° 
Piaget's theory of how the semiotic function comes about, however, 
does not explain why or how symbols develop. According to Piaget, the 
semiotic function, which makes representation possible, is heralded by

five earlier developmental patterns in the second year of life. These in­
clude deferred imitation; symbolic play, or pretending; the drawing, or 
graphic image; the mental image, or internalized imitation; and the ver­
bal evocation of events not occurring at the time of these processes. Im­
itation is especially important. According to Piaget, symbols are created 
by the same process that gives rise to deferred imitation. Piaget's de­
scriptions of these related developmental processes are useful, but of 
themselves do not explain symbol formation. 
Similarly, Piaget asserts that although symbols are generated by a pro­
cess in which accommodation outweighs assimilation, they are then 
placed at the service of a process in which a liberating assimilation out­
weighs accommodation. For Piaget, a symbol or thought is constructed 
from the coordination of actions and not from a figurative or linguistic 
base. The semiotic function, which finds its roots in imitation, liberates 
the child from the bonds of immediate space and time and enables her 
to begin manipulating signals to think. Therefore, for Piaget, the critical 
process involved in the formation of the semiotic function and the ca­
pacity to use symbols to think is the progressive differentiation of sym­
bols from their external points of reference and their use for interiorized 
operations. This is an eloquent statement of what thinking involves, 
that is, ( 1 )  the capacity to use symbols for "interiorized operations" 
(thinking) and (2) for creating meanings that are not fixed by an exter­
nal point of reference. Describing the processes of thinking, however, 
does not explain how or why it develops. 
Piaget's theory of assimilation and accommodation also describes ele-
ments in the process, such as the relative freedom from external points 
of reference, but doesn't fully explain the process. Similarly, Piaget's fo­
cus on imitation and deferred imitation, while identifying developmen­
tal steps in the process leading to thinking with symbols, doesn't explain 
the how and why of the process. 
As we have been describing, the construction of true symbols and their 
use in thinking depends on several stages of emotional transformation. 
These enable infants, toddlers, and children to use emotions to signal in­
tent rather than take full action; to tame and modulate catastrophic af­
fects pushing for fixed actions; and to move from fixed actions to 
problem-solving emotional interactions with meaningful persons and ob­
jects. These steps enable the child to separate a perception from its fixed 
actions and, thereby, construct a freestanding perception or image. The 

286 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
formation of freestanding images as they become invested with emotional 
meaning, in turn, becomes a foundation for symbolic thinking. As emo­
tional signaling becomes more complex and regulated, it leads to further 
and further separation of perceptions or images and their originally, rela­
tively-fixed emotions and actions. In this way, complex regulated emotional 
signaling leads to more and more diferentiation between the symbol and its 
external points of reference, allowingfor greater and greater interiorized oper­
ations. In our "affective" explanation of symbol formation and thinking, 
we offer an explanation for the how and why of this process. As affective 
signaling separates perceptions from actions, freestanding images become 
possible; that is, the structure for symbol formation and interiorized oper­
ations is now available. As further interaction associates meaningful expe­
riences with these internal images, symbols are formed. 
There is another feature of reflective thinking that needs to be acٕ 
counted for. It is responsible for maintaining the needed balance or equi­
librium (Piaget's model) between assimilation and accommodation. This 
involves being able to maintain a solid grasp of the external points of ref­
erence of "reality" while constructing a fuller and fuller thinking-based 
(interiorized) view of reality. In other words, it's easy to become so ab­
stract that one loses grasp of the external points of reference for reality­
that is, become lost in one's own logical system, however coherent it 
is vis-a.-vis it's own assumptions. Similarly, it's easy to be so tied to the 
external points of reference for reality that one becomes too "concrete 
and literal." 
How is this vital balance maintained between the external points of 
reference for reality and the interiorized differentiated processes in­
volved in thinking? We propose that continuous emotional signaling 
between people maintains this balance. The reciprocal emotional sym­
bolic responses of a caregiver to a child's symbolic play establish a 
boundary between what's inside the child and what's outside, leading to 
an initial symbolic capacity for reality testing. Reality testing is formed 
from the reciprocal affective interactions between the affective "intent" 
of "me," or the self, and the affective intent of another person, that is, 
the "not me."31 Similarly, these exchanges of emotional signals during 
symbolic play lead to the ability to connect symbols together in a causal 
manner, for example, "My angry dolls caused her sad doll to feel even 
sadder." Emotional signaling, as we have been discussing, therefore, not 
only leads to symbol formation but maintains the vital balance needed 
to sustain true symbolic thinking. 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
287 
Piaget's model identifies important steps and processes associated 
with impersonal thinking and cognition. The insufficient understand­
ing of the role of affect, however, is a "missing link." This missing link is 
most obvious in trying to understand the processes that enable a child 
to form symbols and progressively differentiate and yet maintain a vital 
balance between her internal world and the processes that enable her to 
think from her external points of reference. 
CONSCIOUSNESS: H OW AFFECTS 
CONNECT THE MIND AND B RAIN 
Exploring the phenomenon of consciousness provides further under-
. standing of the role of affects in the functioning of the mind and the 
brain. Suppose that a sleep lab equipped with all the latest technology in 
MRls and ECGs were to map every event that occurred during some­
one's dream. For the sake of argument, let us suppose that they could 
accurately determine when the dream began and ended, whether the 
dream was pleasurable or produced anxiety, even whether it was similar 
to a dream that the subject had had before. No matter how refined our 
technology might become, however, the one thing it will never be able 
to tell us is what the dream was about; for that we must rely on the sub­
ject's narratives. And therein lies the crux of the mind/body problem. 
The biggest obstacle to understanding the relationship between mind 
and brain has been to figure out how the twO interact. It is now very 
clear that the brain serves as a vital substrate for the mind. We say this 
on the grounds that brain injuries or lesions can affect selected mental 
capacities; or that stimulating parts of the brain can cause a subject to 
experience particular memories or influence mental phenomena in 
other ways; or that severing the corpus callosum results in the two 
hemispheres of the brain operating independently of each other, so that 
if an image is projected on the right visual field the patient can describe 
what they see but not if it is projected on the left visual field, even 
though they can point to a similar object. But the missing piece has 
been to understand how consciousness arises: how the biology of the 
nervous system relates to a human being's capacity for self-awareness, or 
for creative and reflective thinking. 
The problem here is that a person's conscious experiences can only be 
described in their own terms: They cannot be reduced to a description 

288 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
of neurophysiological patterns. We can only understand, say, a creative 
production as a product of a range of personal experiences, which, to be 
sure, are organized by contributions by the underlying biologically 
based nervous system. The key question, however, is: How does this 
process get started? How does consciousness itself come about? 
The problem here is to avoid getting stuck in age-old polemics that 
revolve around assumptions that simply stay as assumptions: for exam­
ple, that ultimately we will be able to explain the mind in terms of phys­
iological processes once our understanding of the brain is sufficiently 
advanced; or that understanding how the brain works will never enable 
us to understand the mind. The way out of this polemic lies, not in per­
severating on one side or the other, but in understanding the mecha­
nism through which consciousness and creative and reflective thinking 
come about. 
To understand this phenomenon, we need to understand the early 
transformations of affect. Affects bridge the two worlds. Affects are par­
tially physical, mediated, for example, in part through the sympathetic 
and parasympathetic nervous systems (e.g., a tightening of the muscles). 
Yet they are also mental or psychological, experienced as conscious feel­
ings, such as anger or sadness. Affects begin early in life in part as a 
physiologic process. We see newborn infants at various states of arousal 
and showing various types of physiologic reactions involved in distress, 
pleasure, etc. How do these global physiologic states begin to take on 
mental or psychological meaning? 
The answer, we believe, lies in what we earlier described as the dual­
coding of experience. For example, a baby touches its caregiver and regis­
ters both a physical sensation and pleasure; or she touches something hot 
and registers the physical sensation and a feeling of discomfort. Experi­
ence is, therefore, coded according to its physical and affective properties. 
The human nervous system has the capacity, even at birth, to perceive 
differences in these double-coded sensations. This capacity to discrimi­
nate or detect differences improves as the caregiver begins interacting 
with her infant, exchanging sights, sounds, touches, and other physical 
sensations and their associated affects because such interactions enable 
the infant to experience a range of subtle sensations. In addition to de­
tecting differences early, the infant's nervous system can organize sensa­
tions, and more broadly, experiences, into patterns. The formation of 
patterns, however, also depends on and improves with interactive experi­
ences, such as an interactive game with a caregiver. Such a game might 
Implications for Neuroscience and Pia get's Cognitive PsychoLogy 
289 
involve a pattern incorporating pleasurable touch, sound, and certain 
comforting rhythms of rocking. As the central nervous system of the in­
fant grows, it is better able to detect differences in physical and affective 
sensations and organize patterns, but only if interactions with caregivers 
are sensitively responsive to the different infant cues and are soothing 
and regulating at the same time. For example, stress can interfere with an 
infant learning to optimally discriminate among sensations and the for­
mation of central nervous system pathways having to do with emotional 
discrimination and regulation. 
The baby's motor responses are also double-coded because in order to 
respond, such as turn towards the sound of a mother's voice or to look 
for her smiling face, the baby has to experience some type of calming, a 
pleasurable affective component. Thus, a baby looks away from an aver­
sive sound and looks towards a comforting and pleasurable one. With 
growing motor control she reaches towards a pleasurable touch and 
away from an unpleasant one. Motor responses quickly move beyond 
reflexes and become part of an affective-motor pattern. Affect serves as a 
mediator between sensation and motor response, connecting the two 
together. This basic unit of sensory-affect-motor response becomes 
more and more established through infant-caregiver interactions. 
But how does the double coding of experience, coupled with sensi­
tive, regulating infant-caregiver interactions and the nervous system's 
capacity to detect differences and organize patterns, work together to 
create emotional psychological experience? As we indicated, the infant 
experiences sensations such as a caregiver's sound as a physical event 
and, at the same time, as an affect, such as pleasure or discomfort. As 
the infant detects more and more differences, one sound from another, 
she is detecting both different physical sensations, such as a louder vs. a 
quieter sound, and different degrees of pleasure or discomfort. At the 
same time, however, as indicated, she is detecting patterns. The quieter, 
more pleasurable sounds may come when she is being rocked, which is 
also pleasurable. A "pleasurable" pattern made up of experiences which 
are experienced with similar types of pleasure begin to emerge. As this 
occurs, she is able to gradually experience differences between this pleas­
urable pattern and another pattern which is less pleasurable or aversive. 
This is the beginning of a long process of experiencing more and more 
specific patterns of affects or emotions. 
As the infant separates these physical experiences with affective quali­
ties into more and more separate or subtle patterns, she is, in essence, 

290 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
creating "mental" or psychological phenomenon. The organization and 
detection of different patterns of physical and affective sensation is a 
mental or psychological phenomenon. The degree to which the affective 
qualities of the interaction have a depth, range, and subtlety to them, a 
very loving, warm, intimate touch, look, and "you are my sweetheart" 
set of sounds, as compared to a shallow, mechanical, hurried interac­
tion, is the degree to which the mental patterns and consciousness cap­
ture sensations that have what we commonly think of as a range of 
emotional qualities. Initially, the organization and detection of emo­
tional patterns is experienced without symbols or words (i.e., presym­
bolically). Later on, these patterns can be experienced and described 
symbolically. These constitute different levels of consciousness. 
However, an infant can only experience and, therefore, detect differ­
ences in and organize patterns of sensations they actually experience. 
Therefore, to perceive and construct a category of "intimacy" depends 
on the degree of nurturing pleasure an infant experiences with a pri­
mary caregiver. Superficial affection will be a very different type of expe­
rience and lead to a very different type of pattern. To construct a pattern 
of empathetic responses, later on a child will need to experience a care­
giver's empathy. In other words, the depth, quality, and subtlety of one's 
inner life depends on the depth, quality, and subtlety of one's relation­
ships and their emotional interactions. Infants who are deprived of 
emotional interactions, as often seen in some orphanages, often do not 
fully develop the capacity to detect different emotional patterns. 
Not just the quality of emotions, such as the depth of intimacy, but 
the subtlety of the pattern one constructs depends on the degree to 
which caregivers read and respond to subtle differences in an infant's be­
havior and emotional expressions. This is because the infant's capacity 
to detect differences and construct patterns depends on the responses 
and patterns she experiences to her own expressions. How sensitive are 
caregivers to her different overtures? If subtleties of pleasure or anger are 
missed or ignored, she will not be able to experience fine-tuned differ­
ences in these emotional states. 
Similarly, as indicated earlier, the very capacity to perceive a pattern it­
self beyond its rudimentary form also depends on emotional interactions 
with caregivers. There are two caregiver-infant interactional qualities that 
propel this process forward. One is the sensitivity with which the infant's 
cues are read and responded to and, in turn, the sensitivity with which 
the infant responds to the caregiver. The more "sensitive" these interac-
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
291 
tions are, the more subtle the sensations the infant learns to detect and 
organize. The other is the regulating nature of the interactions. Unregu­
lated interaction tends to maintain global physiologic states (e.g., fight or 
flight reactions or an overwhelmed versus a calm, alert infant). Only reg­
ulated interactions enable an infant to detect fine-tuned, subtle grada­
tions of sensations because such sensations only occur or are experienced 
as part of sensitive, regulated interactions. In other words, what we call 
emotions and the texture of consciousness is influenced by the qualities 
of distinctly human interactions characterized by regulation, sensitivity, 
and a variety of feeling states. Children deprived of these types of interac­
tions do not experience a range of subtle emotions, especially those deal­
ing with caring, love, and empathy. 
Therefore, through sensitive, regulating interactions with caregivers, 
the infant's global physiologic states become regulated and experienced 
more and more as both discrete physical and affective sensations (e.g., dif­
ferent types of pleasure or comforting). In this way, global physical or 
physiologic states take on the qualities we call emotions. As the infant experi­
ences and organizes these affective states (emotions) into patterns, a mental 
or psychological level of experience (consciousness) unfolds. 
Thus we see basic central nervous system processes that have a strong 
physiologic component become transformed into affective processes 
through the dual-coding of experience, the detection of differences, and 
the construction of patterns. As this process occurs, experience is forever 
changed as affects become more and more part of an internal world of 
patterns and ultimately subjective experience. We described in Chapters 
1 and 2 how children typically go through a number of levels of affec­
tive transformations leading to creative and logical thinking and then 
different degrees of self reflection. 
We can think of consciousness as existing on these different levels. 
Beginning with the basic level of physiologic, affective arousal (a sense 
of aliveness) and developing into subjective awareness of global internal 
affective states, such as pleasure and discomfort, it progresses into the 
internal experience of more differentiated affects, such as different de­
grees of pleasure, annoyance, and so forth. As symbols are formed as an 
outgrowth of separating perceptions from actions, through the capacity 
for emotional signaling, consciousness comes to embody self-awareness, 
including the capacity to label and reflect on affective states or feelings. 
Consciousness is, therefore, a growing dynamic process throughout the 
course of life. 

292 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
The following point is often missed, however. What is the necessary 
foundation for consciousness? Can computers be programmed to have 
it or any types of truly reflective intelligence? The answer is NO! Con­
sciousness depends on affective experience (i.e., the experience of one's 
own emotional patterns). True affects and their near infinite variations 
can only arise from living biological systems and the developmental 
processes that we have been discussingY 
SUMMARY OF H OW EMOTIONAL SIGNALING 
LINKS EMOTION TO COGNITION AND 
S UBSYMBOLI C  AND SYM BOLIC CAPACITIES 
We have shown how emotional signaling may explain the vital compo­
nents of the relationship between emotion and cognition in terms of the 
brain and cognitive theory. In healthy development, primary emotions 
such as fear and anger (more or less, depending on the degree of emo­
tional health) tend to be transformed from catastrophic emotions and 
fixed perceptual-motor or perceptual-action patterns into emotional sig­
nals and interactive emotional patterns increasingly in the second half 
of the first year of life and the second year of life and thereafter.33 
As this happens, more or less, emotions are no longer locked into 
global action patterns, such as fight or flight or withdrawal. As emotions 
are used to signal, they can be modulated through emotional interac­
tions with others. The perception of the emotion, such as fear or anger 
or joy, can be experienced as a freestanding perception or image. This 
image can then acquire meaning through further emotional interac­
tions. For example, as indicated earlier, the image of a mother becomes 
associated with a whole pattern of feelings-love, devotion, frustration, 
anger. As it acquires emotional meaning, the image and its associated 
emotional patterns become a symbol. As a growing symbol, it can be 
united with other symbols into concepts and ultimately become part of 
an integrated system of reflective thinking. 
What becomes conscious, therefore, is the pattern of emotional sig­
naling into which the primary emotions have been transformed. For 
healthy development, which progresses fully into the stage of a continu­
ous flow of emotional signaling, the primary emotions no longer exist 
in their original form. They are now part of an interactive emotional 
Implications for Neuroscience and Piaget's Cognitive Psychology 
293 
pattern. In healthy development, even when emotions are intense, they 
are experienced as part of complex patterns. As indicated earlier, during 
the second half of the first year and through the second year of life, ba­
bies increasingly shift from experiencing the world as discrete emotions 
and behaviors to perceiving and constructing patterns out of experience. 
Interestingly, this observation has been confirmed by many researchers 
looking at babies and caregivers from different perspectives, including 
cognitive, affective, social, and cultural.34 
To the degree primary emotions are transformed into interactive sig­
nals and patterns that are symbolized, the emotional system operates as 
an integrated unit. Each emotional experience has many components, 
all working together as a whole. These include visceral (heart throbbing 
or stomach churning) sensations, signaling (''I'm scared"), interactive 
patterns with expectation ("Mom will soothe me and I will feel better"), 
and symbolic meaning ("What could be scaring me so much?"). 
To the degree to which primary emotions are not sufficiently trans­
formed into interactive signals-that is, maladaptive functioning­
primary emotions may continue to operate in their original catastrophic 
mode in which perception is tied to global action patterns. This pattern 
would be associated with different types of disorders. 
FUTURE RESEARCH 
To build on LeDoux's and other neuroscientists' extraordinary work in 
mapping the pathways involved in primary emotions such as fear, we 
would encourage colleagues in cognitive neuroscience to look for the 
pathways involved in the system of emotional signaling we have been 
describing. We would suggest looking at the relationship between the 
emotional signaling system and integrating pathways between the dif­
ferent parts of the central nervous system. We would suggest studying 
emotionally healthy, well-regulated, reflective individuals in comparison 
to less emotionally healthy individuals to see whether they have better 
functioning integrative pathways (perhaps more neuronal connections 
and better regulatory dynamics) between the subsymbolic and symbolic 
systems. In such studies, we should look at the person's level of func­
tioning and individual profile of motor, sensory, and affective process­

As can be seen, the transformation of emotions into higher levels 
(emotions into signals that become symbolized) enables emotions to or­
ganize a vast array of cognitive operations, including reflective thinking 
and operational intelligence. This hypothesis can also enrich Piaget's 
model of intelligence. It is the transformation of emotions into interac­
tive signals that is the vehicle for the progressive differentiation of the 
self and the object world necessary for reflective thinking as well as 
the instrument for progressing from one level of thinking to the next.

Emotional Development Derailed: 
Pathways to and from Autism 
T
H E  T H E O RY WE HAVE been presenting in this work is put to its 
most rigorous test in our work with children with Autistic Spec­
trum Disorders (ASD) and children who evidence similar social, lan­
guage, and cognitive problems due to extreme emotional deprivation in 
institutional or home settings. Our theory of symbol formation, lan­
guage, and intelligence holds that a series of critical emotional interac­
tions early in life are responsible for these abilities. When these abilities 
do not develop, our theory suggests that these critical early emotional 
interactions have not been mastered. Biological factors can make it diffi­
cult for a child to participate in these emotional interactions (as in 
autism) or, as happens in institutional care, the caregivers themselves 
may not provide them. 
When we looked at children with ASD and children with early emo­
tional deprivation, we found that they had not fully participated in and 
mastered a number of these critical early emotional interactions.! 
We then asked a more difficult question. Would it be possible to help 
children who lack critical symbolic, language, and intellectual abilities to 
develop them with an intervention program that creates opportunities 
for these formative early emotional experiences? Would a subgroup of 
children with ASD whose biological challenges were not too great (but 
who nonetheless had a biological basis for not mastering these functional 
emotional developmental capacities) be able to engage in these critical 
emotional interactions and progress to high levels of relating, symbolic 
295

T H E  F I RST I D EA 
thinking, and empathy? We have been pleased to find that both these 
questions could be answered affirmatively.2 With an intervention pro­
gram that focuses on basic emotional interactions in the context of the 
child's individual processing differences, we have found that a subgroup 
of children with ASD are able to learn how to engage and communicate 
and, therefore, advance to symbol formation, expressive language, and 
reflective thinking, as well as to develop empathy and enjoy relationships 
with peers and adults.3 The fact that providing critical emotional interac­
tions can enable a subgroup of children who typically do not develop 
high levels of symbolic thinking to develop them in spite of their biolog­
ical challenges provides important support for the theory of human in­
telligence presented in this work. 
AUTISM AND AUTISTIC 
SPECTRUM DISO RD ERS (ASD) 
As is well known, autism is a complex developmental disorder involving 
delays and dysfunctions in social interaction, language, and a range of 
emotional, cognitive, motor, and sensory capacities. Empathy and cre­
ative and abstract reflective thinking (including making inferences), 
reading emotional signals, and engaging in emotional interactions are 
generally believed to be particularly difficult for individuals with this 
disorder. Many professionals believe these abilities are beyond the reach 
even of a subgroup of individuals with autism, even if they make the 
maximum progress possible in an intensive therapeutic program. As in­
dicated, we believe and have demonstrated, however, that this belief is 
incorrect. Understanding the role of emotional signaling in the develop­
mental pathways associated with ASD has led to strategies leading to 
levels of creative and reflective thinking and empathy formerly thought 
unattainable. 
Although there are no definitive national data, a variety of studies es­
timate that the rate for autism is from 2 to 4 per 1,000, and for ASD, 
higher. In some locations, however, the rates are at the higher end of 
this range. For example, in one study conducted by the CDC, the rate 
was 1 per 250 for autism and approximately 1 per 1 50 for ASD. 4 In 
comparison to these current estimates, the rates ten or fifteen years ago 
were considerably lower. Although they tended to vary a great deal by 
the study conducted, the most widely cited rate then was 1 per 2,000 to 
Pathways to and from Autism 
297 
2,500 for autism. Estimates from ten to fifteen years ago are not as read­
ily available for ASD. Although some believe these increasing rates are 
due to better identification and diagnosis, many investigators believe 
there is an alarming increase in autism and ASD. 
It has been assumed that autism is a unitary disorder related to an as­
yet unidentified genetic pattern. It is further assumed that there may be 
multiple forms of expression (i.e., phenotypes) related to this genetic 
pattern. Current research, however, may suggest consideration of an al­
ternative hypothesis-that of multiple pathways, each with a different 
genetic pattern and set of clinical features. These different pathways 
may also, however, share some common features, much like many dif­
ferent medical problems involve "fever" or "inflammation." Therefore, 
it may be useful to consider a multipath, cumulative risk model. In sup­
port of such a model is research showing a range of biological, develop­
mental, and clinical patterns (e.g., different genetic neuroanatomical, 
neurophysiological, neurochemical, and clinical patterns).5 Within such 
a model, perhaps different genetic patterns and prenatal and postnatal 
developmental processes create vulnerabilities to cumulative prenatal 
and postnatal risks or challenges. 
Current research suggests there may be multiple factors involved in 
the pathways leading to ASD. Therefore, it may be useful to consider a 
cumulative risk model. There is a great deal of research supporting ge­
netic influences. Genetic factors and prenatal developmental processes 
are likely to predispose a child to autism or create vulnerabilities to pre­
natal and postnatal challenges that have the same effect. These chal­
lenges may include infectious illnesses; toxic substances such as lead, 
methylmercury, PCBs, organophosphates, nicotine, and endocrine dis­
rupters such as Dioxin; and factors that precipitate active autoimmunity 
in genetically predisposed children, for example, viral infections, vac­
cines, and allergies. Clinical observations suggest that postnatal factors, 
although not causative, may also include experiential or physical stress 
as a contributor to some of the observed behavioral patterns. For exam­
ple, children with severe sensory hyper- or hyposensitivities, motor 
planning, and auditory processing problems that are biologically based 
will tend to be more likely to withdraw from relationships and become 
perseverative and self-stimulatory in a noisy and chaotic setting. Re­
search should focus on multi path cumulative risk models and explore 
the mechanisms of action among different etiological and precipitating, 
intensifying, and! or ameliorating factors. 

298 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
In our view, the clinical features of ASD are best understood in terms 
of primary and secondary features. The primary features involve deficits 
in the ability to engage in interactions involving emotional signals, mo­
tor gestures, and vocalizations; difficulty in maintaining these exchanges 
to solve problems; and difficulty in processing auditory, visual-spatial, 
and other sensory input and planning and sequencing actions. The sec­
ondary features that derive from the more primary impairments involve 
the well-known language, cognitive, and social problems, as well as ten­
dencies toward self-absorption, perseveration, and self-stimulation. 
These challenges can be intensified by inappropriate or inadequate in­
terventions and improved by appropriate interventions and individually 
tailored family and educational environments. An appropriate interven­
tion must be based on an understanding of a child's unique developmen­
tal profile and unique pattern strengths and weaknesses. Research to 
better understand causes and improve interventions should focus on im­
proved methods to identifY individual differences and describe and clas­
sifY clinical subtypes. Without adequate understanding of individual 
differences and clinical subtypes, important findings are often missed be­
cause there is no way to know to which children they apply. 
THE CORE PSYCHOLOGICAL 
DEFICIT IN AUTISM 
When children with autism are compared to children without autism, 
and their level of intelligence, as measured with IQ tests, is controlled 
for, there are various autism-specific developmental deficits. These in­
clude deficits in the ability for empathy and seeing the world from an­
other person's perspective in both physical and emotional contexts 
(theory of mind);6 higher-level abstract thinking, including making in­
ferences;? and shared attention, including social referencing and problem 
solving.8 In addition, deficits in the capacities for emotional reciprocity9 
and functional (pragmatic) languageIO also appear specific to autism. 
As we looked at these various deficits, we began asking whether they 
might stem from a common pathway. We also looked at neuropsycho­
logical models that have been suggested to account for the clinical fea­
tures of autism to see if the deficits described in these models might also 
stem from a common pathway. These include models that focus on plan­
ning, sequencing, and problem-solving (i.e., executive functioning), in-
Pathways to and from Autism 
299 
formation processing, shifting frames of reference (i.e., set theory), and, 
as described above, the capacity to understand the thoughts and feelings 
of other people (i.e., theory of mind).!l Our clinical work with infants 
and children has shown that all these abilities (i.e., to empathize, form a 
theory of mind, think abstractly, and solve problems with others, as well 
as use language functionally and engage in emotional reciprocity) stem 
from the infant's ability to connect emotions or intent to motor planning 
and emerging symbols.12 Relative deficits in this core ability, we found, 
led to problems in higher-level emotional and intellectual processes. The 
core psychological deficit in autism, we reasoned, may, therefore, involve 
an inability to connect emotions and intent to motor planning and se­
quencing and to emerging symbols. We further hypothesized that bio­
logical differences (genetic and developmental) associated with ASD may 
express themselves through the derailing of this critical psychological 
process, which, in turn, leads to the symptoms and cognitive, language, 
social, and motor deficits seen in autism. In other words, this vital inter­
mediary process may stand between the biological factors and the mani­
fest symptoms associated with ASD. 
As discussed earlier, a child's capacity to connect emotions to motor 
planning and emerging symbols begins to become more apparent be­
tween nine and eighteen months of age as the infant shifts from simple 
patterns of engagement and reciprocity to complex chains of emotional 
reciprocity. Consider a fourteen-month-old child who takes his father by 
the hand and pulls him to the toy area, points to the shelf, and motions 
for a toy. As Dad picks him up, and he reaches for and gets the toy, he 
nods, smiles, and bubbles with pleasure. For this to occur, the child needs 
to have a desire or wish-emotional intent-for what he wants. He then 
needs to connect this desire or intent to an action plan. The desire and the 
action plan together enable the child to create a pattern of meaningful, so­
cial, problem-solving interactions. Without this connection between de­
sire or emotions and action plans, complex interactive problem-solving 
patterns are not possible. Action without desire or meaning tends to be­
come repetitive (perseverative), aimless, or self-stimulatory, which is what 
is observed when there is a deficit in this core capacity. 
It is hard for a child to get beyond simple motor patterns if he cannot 
connect them with his desires. When we create high states of affect or 
motivation to help children with autism learn to use their motor actions 
purposefully, exchange emotional signals, and connect with others, we 
see their motor planning improve. Under states of high motivation, a 

300 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
child who is capable only of repetition can embark on a two-step se­
quence. For example, consider a child who obviously wanted to go out 
the door but was vacillating between touching it repetitively and aimless 
spinning around near it. When the child was helped to open the door a 
little to heighten his affect in terms of his desire to go out the door, the 
child responded immediately. He began gesturing toward the doorknob 
as if to say, "Hey, open the door." He did this by touching the door and 
then moving his caregiver's hand toward it. He went from repetitive ac­
tions to a purposeful, two-step touch. If the desire or affect becomes too 
intense, however, it can lead to a tantrum. 
If this connection between emotional intent and purposeful action 
can be established, it can enable the child to begin participating in back­
and-forth emotional signaling. If emotional signaling, in turn, becomes 
sufficiently complex, it can enable the child to separate perception from 
action, tame overwhelming emotions, and use freestanding images to 
create symbols. The meaningful use of symbols usually emerges from 
the meaningful emotional problem-solving interactions that enable a 
toddler to understand the patterns in his world. Without this connec­
tion between emotions and motor planning, symbols are often used in a 
repetitive manner (e.g., scripting, echolalia). 
When a child is able to interact with emotional signals, he can modu­
late emotions and action; this in turn permits flexible scanning of the 
environment. The child gets feedback from what he sees and, based on 
that feedback, explores further. In this way, his visual-spatial world and 
motor functioning becomes integrated. 
The ability to interact flexibly with others and the rest of the environ­
ment also makes for associative learning. Associative learning (building 
up a reservoir of related experiences, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors 
which give range and depth to one's personality, inner life, and adaptive 
responses) is necessary for healthy mental growth. Its absence leads to 
rigid and mechanical feelings, thinking, and behavior patterns, as are of­
ten seen in ASD. 
Reciprocal, affective interactions and affectively guided problem­
solving interactions and symbols are necessary for the unique capacities 
research has shown to distinguish individuals with autism from individ­
uals without autism (as outlined earlier). The unique capacity for social 
reciprocity depends on affect guiding interactive social behavior. The 
ability for shared attention, which includes social referencing and shared 
Pathways to and from Autism 
301 
problem solving, depends on affect guiding shared social problem solv­
ing and explorations. Empathy and theory of mind capacities (see 
Chapter 10) depend on the ability to understand both one's own affects 
or feelings and another person's affects or feelings and to project oneself 
into the other person's mindset. This complex emotional and cognitive 
task begins with the ability to exchange affect signals with another per­
son and, through these exchanges, emotionally sense one's own intent 
and the other person's intent (a sense of "self" in interaction with "an­
other"). Similarly, higher-level abstract thinking skills, such as making 
inferences, depend on the ability to generate new ideas from one's own 
affective experiences and then reflect on and categorize them. 13 
In observing infants and toddlers heading into autistic patterns and 
in taking careful histories of older children with autism, we noted that 
they did not fully make the transition from simple patterns of engage­
ment and interaction into complex emotional and problem-solving in­
teractions. Even affectionate children who were able to repeat a few 
words or memorize numbers and letters, but who went on to evidence 
autistic patterns, did not master, for the most part, this early continuous 
exchange of signals. They were unable to develop empathy and creative 
and abstract thinking without an intervention program that helped 
them learn to engage in this flow of emotional exchanges. 
In a review of the developmental profiles of two hundred children 
with ASD, we observed that most of the children shared the unique pro­
cessing deficit we have been describing. Approximately two-thirds of the 
children who developed ASD had this unique type of biologically based 
processing deficit that involved the connection of emotions and intent to 
motor planning and sequencing capacities as well as to emerging sym­
bolic capacities. 14 At the same time, however, the children differed with 
regard to other processing deficits involving their auditory, motor plan­
ning, visual-spatial, and sensory modulation abilities. These differences 
accounted for the variety of social, language, motor, and cognitive prob­
lems and impairments that accompany this fundamental deficit. 
We have labeled the hypothesis that explores the connection between 
affect and motor planning and sequencing, as well as other processing ca­
pacities, the Afect Diathesis Hypothesis. This hypothesis asserts that a 
child uses his affect to provide intent (or direction) for his actions and 
meaning for his symbols or words. Typically, during the second year of 
life, a child begins to use his affect to guide intentional problem-solving 

302 
T H E  F I RS T  I DEA 
behavior and, later on, meaningful use of symbols and language. Through 
many affective problem-solving interactions, the child develops complex 
social skills and higher-level emotional and intellectual capacities. 
THE EARLY ROOTS O F  AUTISM 
Because the unique processing deficit we are proposing as part of the 
pathway leading to ASD occurs early in life, it can undermine the tod­
dler's opportunity for expectable learning experiences essential for many 
critical emotional and cognitive skills. For example, he may have more 
difficulty eliciting ordinary interactions from his parents and the people 
in his immediate environment. He may perplex, confuse, frustrate, and 
undermine purposeful, interactive communication even ifhe has compe­
tent parents. Without such experience, he may not be able to compre­
hend the rules of complex social interactions or to develop a sense of self. 
The child may not learn social "rules" or develop friendships and a sense 
of humor, which are learned at an especially rapid rate between twelve 
and twenty-four months of age.IS By the time this child receives profes­
sional attention, his stunted interaction patterns with caregivers have, 
therefore, excluded him from important learning experiences and may be 
intensifying his difficulties. The loss of engagement and intentional re­
latedness to key caregivers may cause him to withdraw more idiosyncrat­
ically into his own world and become even more aimless and/or 
repetitive. What later looks like a primary biological deficit may, there­
fore, be part of a dynamic process through which the child's lack of emo­
tional interactions has intensified specific early biological processing 
problems and derailed the learning of critical social and intellectual skills. 
The early roots of these problems may make early identification pos­
sible. For example, most babies will move rhythmically to the sound of 
their mothers' voices.16 We are currently conducting studies to see 
whether children at risk for ASD evidence a difference in these rhyth­
mic emotional-motor patterns. At each developmental level, there may 
be opportunities for early identification and preventive intervention. 
To foster such efforts we have further developed our theory on the re­
lationship between affect and motor planning. This relationship begins 
very early in infancy as sensations, affects, and motor responses are used 
together. 
Pathways to and from Autism 
THE SENSORY-AFFECT-MOTOR 
CONNECTIONS 
303 
In healthy development, as the infant progresses through the first year 
of life, she's continually connecting the sensory system to the motor sys­
tem. As this occurs, the sensory system provides direction and purpose 
to the motor system. For example, an infant sees his caregiver's face and 
turns toward it. 
Even early in infancy, however, these sensory-motor patterns have a 
special sensory component: affect. As indicated earlier, affect operates 
like an additional extra sensory capacity. A person touches a surface and 
it feels cold, but also aversive or scary or pleasurable. As we have shown, 
all sensation or perception is double-coded according to its physical and 
affective qualities. 17 There are infinite variations to the affective coloring 
of sensation. For example, there are many subtle variations in the expe­
rience of pleasure, excitement, joy, rage, and fear. This degree of varia­
tion enables us to use affect to code and store a near infinite amount of 
information as well as retrieve it later on. 
As infants progress during the first year, the capacity to create links 
between the physical and affect qualities of sensation and motor behav­
ior enables the infant to go beyond basic sensory-motor reflexes and op­
erate more and more in terms of patterns. He can perceive patterns, as 
well as organize his own behavior into patterns. For example, the baby 
perceives the pacifier sitting on his mommy's head. She experiences in­
terest and pleasure in this sight and the novelty of its location. She 
reaches for it. We now have a purposeful motor pattern. As the infant 
develops, he is able to bring together one or two purposeful units into 
larger patterns. He sees a toy, experiences delight, points to it, and takes 
his father by the hand and, through multiple back-and-forth interac­
tions involving perception, affect, and action, persuades his dad to pick 
him up so that he can reach for the toy. By the second year of life, these 
patterns lead to a sense of self (the affective, intentional agent of the 
pattern) and a sense of others (the perception, expectation, and associ­
ated affects of the "others"). As we have discussed, this developmental 
progression enables the child ultimately to form and give meaning to 
symbols as well as develop higher levels of thinking. 
What happens, however, when biological factors (or severe depri­
vation or abuse) interfere with the formation of a primary connection 

304 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
between the sensory system and the motor system? In such a case, mo­
tor behavior is not tightly linked either to the physical or the affective 
qualities of sensation. When this happens, we observe that infants evi­
dence more aimless motor behavior. Instead of hearing or seeing the 
caregiver (i.e., a perception) and turning towards her (a motor behav­
ior), the infant may move his head aimlessly. There is more or less no 
perception or sensation guiding motor behavior. Similarly, instead of 
hearing his mother's voice and kicking his legs in a rhythmic move­
ment (in synchrony), the child may move his legs more randomly. 
The relative lack of a connection between sensation and motor be­
havior interferes with connections forming between affect and motor 
behavior. Therefore, as the infant perceives the pacifier on his mommy's 
head and experiences pleasure in the sight, he is unable to connect it to 
a motor action, such as reaching for the pacifier. 
If the infant could reach for the pacifier, this behavior would let the 
caregiver know of the baby's perception and pleasurable interest and cre­
ate the first step in a back-and-forth pattern of communication. The 
caregiver would likely hold the pacifier closer and, after the infant took 
it, gesture for it back with an outstretched hand, a big smile, and a wel­
coming sound. 
When a baby is unable to create a back-and-forth pattern of com­
munication, she is unable to fully participate in the primary units of 
purposeful interaction that give rise to complex interactive patterns. 
Complex interactive patterns (i.e., a continuous flow of back-and-forth 
communication) are necessary if a child is to understand the world's so­
cial, language, and physical patterns. Such complex interactions enable 
ptoblem solving, the construction of a sense of self, symbol-formation, 
and higher levels of thinking. 
When biological factors interfere with the formation of the critical 
sensory-affect motor connection, the infant and child has difficulty in 
successfully negotiating the developmental pathways leading to these 
emotional and intellectual capacities. Our observations suggest that this 
is what happens in many children with autistic spectrum disorders. In 
children with autistic spectrum disorders, there may not be a total lack of 
connection between the sensory-affect and motor system but rather a rel­
ative one. This relative lack of sensory-affect-motor connections makes it 
difficult for affect to guide motor actions and, therefore, we observe a 
compromised ability for complex, purposeful, meaningful behavior. For 
example, an infant with this challenge may evidence some purposeful 
Pathways to and from Autism 
305 
and even reciprocal interactions, but often will not progress to initiating 
and sustaining complex, continuing, reciprocal interactions and shared 
purposeful problem-solving behavior. 
As indicated, we call the model, which formulates the role of affect 
and sensation in creating purposeful, meaningful behavior (and then 
symbols), the Affect Diathesis Hypothesis. In this model we formulate a 
number of stages through which the relationship between sensation, af­
fect, and motor behavior progresses. 18 Understanding these stages has 
enabled us to identify infants at risk for developmental problems and 
autistic spectrum disorders early when interventions are likely to be more 
successful. 
At each stage in the sensory-afFect-motor connection, we are able to 
look for the presence, absence, or compromise in this critical capacity. For 
example, in the first six months, we look for different types and degrees of 
aimless rather than purposeful, coordinated or synchronous motor activ­
ity. We also look for aimless rather than synchronous or purposeful inter­
actions between infants and caregivers. In the second half of the first year, 
we look for a lack of initiative and multiple reciprocal affective interac­
tions in a row (i.e., back-and-forth patterns of perception, afect, and ac­
tion). In the first half of the second year of life, we look for a toddler 
demonstrating a lack of initiating and sustaining a continuous flow of 
back-and-forth complex social problem-solving. Then we look for the 
lack of the meaningful use of emerging symbols and a lack of progression 
to the meaningful and creative use of symbols (i.e., affect-directed conver­
sations) as well as a continuation of the earlier presymbolic difficulties. 
This developmental model also informs an approach for early inter­
vention and preventive work. Because the sensory-affect-motor connec­
tion in children at risk of autism and related developmental problems is 
not an all-or-nothing phenomenon (i.e., involves relative degrees of in­
terference in the connection), there is potential for interventions to 
strengthen the sensory-afFect-motor connections. The main "highways" 
may be relatively blocked, but the side roads are often available to be de­
veloped. The way to develop the side roads is to strengthen the connec­
tion between sensation, affect, and motor action. 
As we have discussed, to strengthen this connection, we have found 
that creating heightened affect states is especially helpful. As heightened 
affects are connected to simple motor actions, infants and young chil­
dren can often become more purposeful. For example, a toddler is mov­
ing a little train back and forth repetitively. If the caregiver puts the train 

306 
T H E  F I R S T  I DEA 
on his head, the child may reach for it and vocalize with delight. As affect 
connects more and more to motor actions, it also connects motor pat­
terns to sensations (affect is part of the double coding of sensations). As 
the sensation-affect-motor connection is strengthened, we observe more 
and more purposeful affective behavior. Purposeful affective interactions 
and motor patterns, in turn, lead to reciprocal affect signaling, a sense of 
self, symbolic functioning, and higher-level thinking skills. 
To function in the ways described above, affect must be relatively pleas­
urable and regulated (a little annoyance can be helpful, but a disorganized 
tantrum is not). With pleasurable, regulated affect, there's an opportunity 
for many purposeful interactions in a row, such as when a baby takes a 
pacifier, hands it back, takes it again, and so forth. An overwhelming and 
fearful response, on the other hand, will tend to lead to a one step action, 
an avoidance response, and, in all likelihood, if the fear were gre.at 
enough, to fragmented or aimless behavior. Overwhelming negative af-
-
fects, while leading initially to a purposeful behavior, often overwhelm the 
infant and child and lead to more disorganized patterns. 
Therefore, heightened affect is required to create the connection be­
tween sensation and action and help the child move into complex inter­
active patterns. As indicated, when we have been able to create emotional 
interactions involving heightened pleasurable affect with infants and 
children evidencing the early symptoms of ASD, we've observed enor­
mous progress in the most essential capacities-relating and responding 
to emotional signals and creating meaningful ideas. 19 
The goal of creating the sensation-affect-motor connection is usually 
approached through a comprehensive, intensive intervention program 
that tailors pleasurable, regulated interactions to the child's individual 
processing differences (including sensory over- or underreactivity, audi­
tory processing and language challenges, and visual-spatial and motor 
planning and sequencing difficulties). 
In summary, the difficulty in connecting affect to motor planning and 
sequencing begins with a challenge in connecting sensory and motor 
patterns and, as the infant develops, includes creating the sensory-affect­
motor linkages that make complex interactive patterns possible. If affect 
is unable to provide direction and meaning to motor patterns, the child's 
capacity to engage in a continuous flow of reciprocal affect cueing as part 
of social problem solving is severely compromised. Because complex af­
fective cueing is a critical step in symbol formation, the creation of 
Pathways to and from Autism 
307 
meaningful symbols (i.e., symbols invested with affect) also becomes 
compromised. The steps in this process are summarized below: 
• Compromises in simple sensory-motor connections; seen in a baby who 
is having difficulty moving to the rhythm of his caregiver's voice and 
with other synchronous rhythmic activities; 
• Compromises in purposeful emotional interactions and complex sensory­
affect-motor linkages; seen in a baby who is having difficulties in vocaliz­
ing to a caregiver's vocalization or in his reaching for a caregiver's nose; 
• Comptomises in reciprocal affect cueing (circles of communication) and 
complex sensory-affect-motor linkages that enable complex interactive 
and perceptual patterns; 
• Compromises in the continuous flow of affect signaling, shared social 
problem solving, and the complex sensory-affective-motor planning 
linkages that make an early, organized sense of self and the early mean­
ingful use of symbols possible; 
• 
Compromises in the formation and use of meaningful complex symbols 
because of compromises in linkages between affect, action, and emerging 
Images. 
There are many children who do not evidence autism but have devel­
opmental problems, for example, severe motor problems, in which in­
tentionality or purposeful action is difficult in its own right. Such 
problems result in less practice at using intentional behavior and in par­
ticipating in intentional interactions. In these circumstances, creating 
purposeful interactions around any motor skill (even head or tongue 
movements) may strengthen the intent-motor connection and reduce 
aimless, repetitive behavior. Recent MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) 
studies suggest that practicing and improving motor skills may enhance 
the developmental plasticity of neuronal connections.2o 
SECONDARY DEFICITS 
In our review of two hundred cases of ASD, although many children 
shared the primary deficit of connecting affect to processing capacities, 
their differences in other processing skills tended to create a variety of 
symptoms and splinter skills, such as whether a child lined up toys 

308 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
(which requires some motor planning) or just banged them, or scripted 
TV shows (which requires some auditory memory) or was silent. Chil­
dren with relatively stronger processing skills in one or more areas 
tended to make rapid progress once they were helped to connect emo­
tions or intent to these stronger skills. Children with numerous process­
ing problems tended to make more gradual progress and required 
specific therapies, such as speech and occupational therapy. 
These observations are consistent with recent neuroscience studies 
suggesting that different processing skills may compete for cortical ac­
cess, depending on functional use,21 They are also consistent with neu­
ropsychological studies of individuals with autism-but without mental 
retardation-that show that "within affected domains, impairments con­
sistently involved the most complex tasks dependent on higher-order 
abilities" (concept formation, complex memory, complex language, and 
complex motor abilities),22 Higher-level abilities tend to depend more 
on "meanings" that, in turn, depend on emotional interaction with the 
world. These observations are also consistent with work on the shifts to a 
more complex central nervous system organization, including hemi­
spheric connections that occur at the end of the first year of life and the 
early part of the second year.23 They may also help us understand why 
many children with ASD use peripheral vision (they don't look directly 
at caregivers but seem to look from the side) rather than central vision to 
scan their environments. The neuroanatomy of the visual tracks is such 
that peripheral vision requires only one hemisphere, the left or right one, 
to function. Central vision, however, requires that both hemispheres 
function together (because some of the pathways cross over and others 
do not). It would be reasonable to explore the hypotheses that problems 
in integrating the two hemispheres may contribute to ASD. Integration 
of the two hemispheres would likely facilitate emotional interaction and 
integrated central vision, and it's possible that complex emotional inter­
action with a continuous flow of emotional signaling may facilitate using 
both hemispheres together. Work showing that the limbic system and 
hippocampus are developing and forming cortical connections at around 
eighteen months is also consistent with these clinical observations on the 
increasingly purposeful and meaningful use of actions and ideas in the 
second year of life. 24 
We have seen that, during the first year of life, many infants who later 
evidence autistic patterns could focus on objects, experience some affec­
tion and warmth, and even enter into simple reciprocal interactions. 
Pathways to and from Autism

Perhaps they are able to perform these tasks because the basic patterns 
can be carried out by either side of the brain alone,25 Complex, goal­
directed, reciprocal, emotional patterns, however, may require that both 
sides of the brain work together for optimal functioning, especially dur­
ing the early years. Although children appear able to learn to engage in 
complex social interactions with only one functioning hemisphere, they 
may require special learning to do so. As we discussed in Chapter 9, 
emotional interactions enable the child to use all his senses, as well as 
motor and language abilities, together. These may, therefore, be neces­
sary for integrating central nervous system pathways to form. 
This model may also explain why some children make rapid progress 
and even evidence precocious capacities once they can connect emo­
tional intent to other skills. Perhaps the component parts of their ner­
vous system are developing quite well but lack only the direction and 
coordination of affect or intent. Other children may have deficits in sev­
eral component parts. For them, connecting emotional intent to the 
component parts is only a first step that begins a slower pattern of 
progress. In all likelihood, the pathways that connect emotion and in­
tent to sequencing of motor, verbal, and visual behavior involve many 
different tracks of the central nervous system. 
Our model of the core deficit can be contrasted with hypotheses pro­
posing that the primary deficit in autism is the child's inabiliry to con­
struct a theory of mind, to understand or imagine another person's state 
of mind, and to empathize with the feelings of others.26 In our view, this 
inabiliry may very well be a product of the more primary difficulry in 
connecting emotions and intent to motor complex and interaction with 
others. In our population, the children who made very good progress 
learned to empathize gradually as they became more emotionally in­
volved in other people's lives. The children who were unable to become 
involved with others and communicate emotionally in a continuous and 
Spontaneous manner, and who instead relied on scripts or prompts, did 
not develop the abiliry to appreciate the emotions of others. 
There is also recent research suggesting that children with autism tend 
to employ different perceptual strategies, such as looking at another per­
son's mouth rather than the eyes, and have difficulties in reading another 
person's facial expressionsP These findings, however, may be a develop­
mental consequence of the more primary, earlier deficit that we have de­
scribed. Infants and toddlers who do not engage in reciprocal affective 
gesturing do not have the experiential foundation for understanding the 

3 1 0  
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
emotional cues of another person, including facial expressions, tone of 
voice, body posture, and the like. The ability to comprehend emotional 
gestures comes from many months of practicing this interactive experi­
ence. Furthermore, infants and toddlers without this experience may be 
unable to regulate their emotions and, therefore, tend to be overloaded 
by emotional cues. If these children are oversensitive to sensations-as 
many children at risk for ASD are-, they experience such cues in an es­
pecially intense manner. The eyes tend to convey more emotion than the 
mouth. Children with these sensitivities may find looking at someone 
else's eyes too overloading. Therefore, the preference for the mouth over 
the eyes may, in part, be related to the broader difficulty in modulating 
emotIons. 
Research in progress by Morton Gernsbacher and colleagues at the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison supports this thesis. She has recently 
shown that individuals with autistic spectrum disorders who were found 
to have different brain imaging patterns when looking at pictures of the 
human face had the expectable brain imaging patterns when they were 
encouraged to look at the face (i.e.; their "abnormal" brain imaging pat­
terns were due to their not looking, rather than processing the experience 
differently). She further showed that these individuals, when encouraged 
to look at, for example, the expressive eyes, showed a physiologic stress re­
sponse indicating that it was difficult for them to experience this type of 
emotion. Dr. Gernsbacher's work, therefore, shows that individuals with 
ASD may have heightened sensitivity to emotions and, therefore, may at­
tempt to cope by not looking at the source of those emotions. This work 
beautifully illustrates the complex interplay of perception, emotion, and 
interaction in human development and functioning.28 
CLINICAL OUTCOMES WITH THE 
DEVELO PMENTAL M ODEL OF INTERVENTI ON 
In the chart review mentioned above, the children's patterns and clinical 
course were based on an experienced clinician's observations; detailed 
notes were organized according to a scale we devised called the Func­
tional Emotional Assessment Scale,29 The children described in this 
study were treated with methods based on our developmental model­
methods known informally as the "Floor Time" approach, or formally 
known as the Developmental Individual Relationship-based model 
Pathways to and from Autism 
3 1 1 
(OIRrM).30 The DIRTM approach is a comprehensive program that in­
volves harnessing a child's affect, tailoring interactions to his profile of 
motor, sensory, and language processing strengths and weaknesses, and 
facilitating all his functional/emotional developmental capacities (en­
gagement, affective signaling) up to his highest levels and helping him 
move to the next level. It often includes intensive home, educational, 
and therapeutic components. 
To describe outcomes, we divided the children's progress into three 
broad groups. A "good to outstanding" outcome group included children 
who, after two or more years of intervention, evidenced joyful relating, 
including preverbal gestures with a variety of emotional cues (appropri­
ate, reciprocal smiling, frowns, looks of surprise, annoyance, glee, happi­
ness, and the like). They were able to engage in lengthy purposeful and 
well-organized social problem-solving interactive sequences (over fifty cir­
cles of spontaneous communication), and share attention on various so­
cial, cognitive, or motor-based tasks. They could use symbols and words 
creatively and in pretend play and conversation. They could construct 
logical bridges between their ideas and hold a logical, two-way conversa­
tion, separate fantasy from reality, and anticipate consequences. Most im­
portant, in this group, the children's symbolic activity was related to their 
underlying emotional intent and desires, rather than to memorized or 
rote sequences. They progressed to high levels of abstract thinking, in­
cluding the capacity to make inferences and experience empathy. In gen­
eral, these children mastered basic capacities, including reality testing, 
impulse control, the organization of thoughts and emotions, a differenti­
ated sense of self, and an ability to experience a range of emotions, 
thoughts, ideas, and concerns. They no longer showed self-absorption, 
avoidance, self-stimulation, or perseveration. On the Childhood Autism 
Rating Scale (CARS), a standard way of indicating the degree of autism, 
all the children in this group shifted into the nonautistic range. 
Some children in the "good to outstanding" group became precocious 
in their academic abilities, reading or doing math two or three grade lev­
els above their ages (some perhaps developed their visual-spatial abilities 
early when auditory processing lagged). Some, even though they had in­
tact basic personality functions, still evidenced auditory or visual-spatial 
difficulties, which were improving. Most of the children in the "good to 
Outstanding" group, even those with precocious reading or math skills, 
had some degree of motor planning challenges in penmanship or draw­
ing or in complex, gross motor activity.

T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
A second group made significant gains in their ability to relate and 
communicate with gestures. They became related to their parents, often 
seeking them out in a joyful, zestful, and pleasurable manner. Parents 
commented, "I've discovered a little person inside my child." They could 
enter into longer sequences of purposeful emotional cueing and interac­
tions, but did not necessarily become capable of a continuous flow of in­
teraction. They could also share attention and engage in social, cognitive, 
and motor problem solving. In this group, however, the children were 
still having significant problems in developing their symbolic capacities. 
Some had the partial ability to use symbols in pretend play and language, 
but it was significantly below age levels. For example, in this group many 
children could engage in concrete pretend play sequences, such as driv­
ing a car or feeding a doll, and use words for some simple negotiations of 
their desires ("I want to go outside" or "I want juice"), but were not yet 
able to construct long, creative, symbolic exchanges; that is, they couldn't 
have a conversation or elaborate an experience in a play sequence. This 
group, like the first group, no longer evidenced self-absorption, avoid­
ance of relating, self-stimulation, or perseveration. 
A third group continued to have significant difficulties in both the 
presymbolic and the symbolic realms. They had difficulty with atten­
tion and with simple and complex sequences of gesturing. If they were 
using some concrete symbols in pretend play when props were available, 
or could use language when they wanted something, this was coupled 
with a significant degree of self-absorption, avoidance, self-stimulation, 
and perseveration. In this group, those who had some symbolic capacity 
(e.g., to sing songs or work puzzles) were unable to imitate and use these 
abilities in an interactive, communicative manner. Many in this group 
were making slow progress in their basic ability to relate with warmth to 
others, but some alternated between progress and regression. 
One hundred sixteen of the two hundred children (58 percent) were 
in the "good to outstanding" outcome group, fifty (25 percent) were in 
the "medium" outcome group, and thirty-four (17 percent) continued to 
have significant difficulties. Some of the group with significant continu­
ing difficulties were making very slow progress. In a subgroup of those 
with significant difficulties, eight (4 percent) were vacillating or losing 
capacities. It is important to emphasize, however, that this was not a rep­
resentative population of children with ASD. Although the families who 
came to see us represented a broad range of challenges, they were also 
motivated and may have seen some special strengths in their children.

3 1 3  
Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a "subgroup" of children 
with ASD can make enormous progress. Only future "clinical trial" stud­
ies, however, will be able to confirm this hypothesis and determine what 
percent of children are in this subgroup.

Children who made progress with this treatment model tended to im­
prove in a certain sequence. First to improve was the child's expression of 
emotion and pleasure in relating. Within the first three to four months we 
would usually see greater joy and positive emotions, along with more con­
sistent relatedness (e.g., seeking out parents and caregivers). Even children 
who had been extremely avoidant and self-absorbed would, after parents 
were playfully obstructive for periods of time, begin going over to their 
parents and signaling them with a look, smile, or pat on the knee. Some 
parents worried about being too playfully obstructive. "Won't he get mad 
at me if I get stuck behind the door?" These parents were pleasantly sur­
prised when their children after a while would push them to get stuck be­
hind the door so that they could play the same game again. By creating 
problems for their children to solve through playful obstruction, they 
made it possible for the children to "undo" the parents' actions. This was 
very important for children who could not initiate and sequence purpose­
ful behavior and interactions because of difficulties in motor planning. 
Contrary to stereotypes of autism, the children seemed eager for 
emotional contact, but initially couldn't figure out how to achieve their 
goal. They seemed grateful when their parents helped them find ways to 
engage in greater social interaction. 
Eighty-three percent of the children, which included children who 
progressed very slowly, initially showed improvement in the range and 
depth of their engagement and their pleasute and emotions. Once 

3 1 4  
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
engaged, many made further gains and moved from simple to complex 
emotional and motor gestures. 
Long sequences of emotional interaction led to the third area of gain­
the emergence of functional symbolic capacities. Creative and imaginative 
symbolic elaboration and the expressive use of language always followed 
presymbolic emotional cueing and communication. Many children went 
through a transitional stage in which they used words from video or book 
scripts and then became more and more creative with their behaviors and 
gestures. If we overfocused on the words rather than the gestures and af­
fects, we slowed progress. Children who remained rigid and stereotyped 
in their gestural interactions were often rigid and stereotyped as they 
learned words; for example, using scripts and ritualized language. Once 
the children became more flexible and creative in nonverbal interac­
tions-a big smile, trick Dad by hiding the cookie in her hand-they 
would begin to use symbols more spontaneously and creatively. 
As children became more symbolic, many could not stop talking or 
flitting from one idea to another. It was as though they were excited 
about their newfound gifts. There was a mixture of fragmented and il­
logical ideas, islands of fantasy, and some scripting, such as repeating 
words heard on Tv, as well as repeating words to get needs met. Over 
time, however, 58 percent of the children were able to use their emerg­
ing symbolic skills creatively and logically. 
Most of the children could express their own ideas much more quickly 
than they could comprehend the ideas of others. Even children who ini­
tially had some understanding of others' language-for example, of 
simple commands-still had more trouble with incoming information 
than in their ability to express ideas. They knew what they wanted to say 
but understood others inconsistently. Even when they could tell you 
what they wanted ("Go out play" or "Give me juice") or do pretend play 
sequences with the dolls hugging and kissing, they would find it difficult 
to answer the abstract "what," "where," and "why" questions ("What do 
you want to do next?" or "Where do you want to go?" or "Why do you 
want to go outside?"). 
Eventually, with a great deal of interaction and dialogue, the ability to 
abstract and comprehend the ideas of others emerged. Children did not 
get to this level unless their parents and the therapists focused on rapid, 
two-way, symbolic communication. For example, it wasn't sufficient to 
listen to a verbal child and repeat what he said. Caregivers had to chal­
lenge the children to process incoming ideas; for example, they used 
Pathways to and from Autism 
3 1 5  
affective tones, visual clues, multiple choices, and statements that in­
spired complex verbal responses to help the children deal with more ab­
stract dialogues. It required long back-and-forth exchanges rather than 
short, thirty-second conversations: "Oh, you want to go outside? To do 
what? To play or kick the ball? Which one would be more fun?" Pretend 
play in which the caregiver became a character who enjoyed verbal inter­
change was very helpful as well: "I'm hungry! I need something to eat!" 
The children with good-to-outstanding outcomes who became cre­
ative and logical were able to hold spontaneous, affect-driven, two-way, 
symbolic communication. As a consequence, they were able to learn to 
differentiate their internal worlds)l Logical thinking, impulse control, 
and an organized sense of self emerged. 
For many, there were two steps in this process. First, they learned to 
hold short creative dialogues that lacked a cohesive, integrated capacity 
for thinking or an organized sense of self (islands of logical dialogue). 
Over time, they learned to integrate and expand. The islands became 
continents and a cohesive, integrated sense of self and capacity for logic 
emerged. As a consequence, their academic abilities also improved as 
they became more flexible, were able to learn how to use functional logi­
cal exchanges, to engage in two-way thinking, to solve problems, and to 
work together with others. Their peer relationships also improved, but it 
required a great deal of practice-four or five play dates a week and ac­
cess to very communicative peers in preschool and school programs. 
With dynamic, interactive academic learning in a warm, secure, orga­
nized setting, many of the creative and logical children developed aca­
demic abilities that ranged from average to superior. When they were in 
overly structured academic settings for most of the day, however, their 
academic progress was slower and they tended to remain more rigid, 
concrete, and rote. 
For some children, the augmentative use of pictures, signs, and other 
symbolic equivalents was very helpful. For a small group of children 
who were unable to make the transition into the symbolic realm, we 
added more structured techniques to improve skills, gestures, and then 
Use of words. When we combined these with the dynamic, interactive 
"Floor Time" approaches, these structured strategies were more effective 
than when used alone.32 
The pattern of progress described above occurred in the context of 
a comprehensive intervention program that involves many elements. All 
the elements are guided by the DIRTM model of facilitating fie capacities

through interactions that are tailored to a child's individual differences. 
These elements are outlined in the following table. It should also be 
mentioned that the National Academy of Sciences in their report "Edu­
cating Children with Autism" pointed out that there is growing support 
for the developmental, relationship-based models, with a number of 
programs, including the DIRTM model, showing positive results for chil­
dren with ASD.33

CHILDREN DEPRIVED OF FORMATIVE 
EMOTIONAL INTERACTIONS 
3 1 7  
Going back to the well-known studies of Rene Spitz, H .  McV. Hunt,34 
and others, the results of severe emotional deprivation (a lack of nurtur­
ing interactions) during the early months and years of life have been 
well documented. Severe deficits in critical social, cognitive, and lan­
guage capacities can result. Some children fail to thrive and may not 
survive. Some become very self-absorbed and aimless, with little or no 
language, cognitive, or social capacities, and others become socially 
promiscuous, antisocial, and relate to other people as "things." Even 
though the effects of emotional deprivation have been well known for 
the past forty to fifty years, in recent years we have seen children with 
these patterns who had been in orphanages in Eastern Europe. We also 
see children with these patterns who were reared in multiproblem fami­
lies where mental illness or a variety of other risk factors interfered with 
nurturing interactions.35 
The intervention program we developed for children who have suf­
fered this emotional deprivation was fundamentally similar to the pro­
gram we developed for children with ASD. Although the reasons for the 
children's deficits were very different in both instances, the goal was to 
create opportunities for the children to engage in formative interactive 
emotional experiences. A critical difference in the intervention ap­
proaches, however, was that the children in multiproblem families re­
quired substantially more family support and intervention in the 
dysfunctional family patterns. We have described the details of this 
component of the intervention model elsewhere.36 We found a clear sta­
tistical relationship between our ability to help the caregivers develop 
their own ability to engage in formative interactions and the outcomes 
we saw in the children. For example, as caregivers began to learn how to 
form intimate relationships, their children were able to do so as well. As 
caregivers were able to learn to engage in emotional interactions, their 
children became better problem solvers. As the caregivers engaged in 
symbolic thinking and building bridges between their ideas and sym­
bols (e.g., describing their feelings and reflecting on their feelings), their 
children showed higher degrees of language development and intelli­
gence,37 All such findings strongly support the theory presented in this 
work that formative emotional interactions are critical for symbol for­
mation, language, and intelligence. 

3 1 8  
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Many of the children who were adopted after having experienced 
emotional deprivation in orphanages often became part of families that 
could offer a great deal of nurturing care and could readily engage in 
these formative types of emotional interactions. With these children 
and their caregivers, our intervention focused on educating and sup­
porting the caregivers regarding the best ways to tailor these interactions 
to the children's differences in sensory processing, sensory modulation, 
motor planning and sequencing, and existing emotional capacities. 
Some children and families progressed very quickly. Others progressed 
more slowly because either the children presented severe challenges or 
the abilities of the new caregivers or families were wanting. Overall, we 
observed patterns of progress very similar to those we saw in our work 
with children suffering from ASD. When emotional deprivation occurs 
very early in life, it appears to affect basic processing capacities in ways 
that are very similar to biologically based challenges. 
Perhaps the most important finding regarding children with ASD 
and severe emotional deprivation is that in both groups the children's 
progress was proportional to their ability to engage in the six primary 
types of formative emotional interactions that our model hypothesizes 
leads to symbol formation, language, and intelligence. 
We have also been able to describe the developmental pathways asso­
ciated with depression, anxiety, aggressive behavior and antisocial pat­
terns, and attention and learning problems. We have developed the 
DIRTM model treatment programs for each type of challenge. 
The developmental model described in this chapter provides a new 
way of conceptualizing mental illness as well as mental health. It en­
ables us to look at the pathways (and steps) to healthy or adaptive emo­
tional functioning as well as see problems in terms of the stages of 
emotional growth outlined in Chapter 2. It then helps us look at chal­
lenges in terms of the biological contributions (expressed through mo­
tor, sensory, or language processing difficulties and environmental and 
interactive contributions). These challenges are looked at in the context 
of the goals of each of the stages in the developmental pathway. Each 
stage in the pathway, therefore, constitutes an intervening developmental 
organization that organizes biology and experience. The identification of 
these intervening organizations, in turn, makes possible improved in­
terventions and new models for research.

The Development of Social Groups 
Introduction 
I
N T H I S  S E C T I O N  WE propose that our developmental model pro­
vides us with a framework for integrating studies of group formation 
and behavior with studies of a child's cognitive, linguistic, emotional, 
and social enculturation. This framework is not intended to replace 
but rather to support, and indeed, unify, existing approaches in anthro­
pology and the social sciences. Moreover, the model that we present 
here will continue to evolve as we acquire further insights into how hu­
mans, individually and in groups, develop many of their most vital hu­
man capacities. 
In the chapters that follow, we trace the developmental needs and ca­
pacities of groups and then consider how this framework provides an 
important additional lens through which to study large group behavior 
and gain a deeper understanding of cultural and social processes, in­
cluding the great debate in anthropology between relativists and univer­
salists. In the following chapter, we show how this model provides us 
with a new way to conceptualize the developmental origins of early hu­
man history from the Magdelanian period to the rise of civilizations, as 
well as a new understanding of the history of history. Finally, we turn 
our attention to the nature of the challenges that the global community 
currently faces and the new psychology that is needed to deal in an 
adaptive and reflective manner with the fact of global interdependency. 
As we will see, the developmental model of evolution that we have pre­
sented in this book helps us understand not only the types of capacities 
that need to be inculcated for future survival but also the forces that are 
presently impeding this process.

The Developmental Levels of 
Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
With Elizabeth Greenspan 
T
H E  D EVELO P M ENTAL F RA M EWORK T HAT we have outlined in this 
book focuses on a few essential questions that standard approaches 
in anthropology and the social sciences do not consider, or at least not 
to the same degree. The issues that this framework highlights involve 
the following fundamental questions: 
What are the developmental needs of social groups, societies, and cultures? 
Are there certain fondamental needs that have to be met for a group to exist and 
for an individual to operate in a social or cultural context? 
How do groups cohere to form a stable entity? 
What are the processes that enable the members of a group to come together 
around common beliefi, shared institutions, kinship or bloodlines, and preju­
dices or biases? 
Does coming together involve participating in some shared practical endeavor, 
such as providing the essentials for survival (food, shelter, and protection)? 
What about the communicative processes of the group: How do they negotiate 
basic needs with one another? 
How does a group mediate its shared sense of reality such that it can maintain a 
state of harmony in the foce of both internal and external stressors? 
321 

322 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
There is, of course, a very rich literature in anthropology and the so­
cial sciences on the characterization of large groups, cultures, and social 
organizations. But the question of how individuals acquire the ability to 
form groups and societies, and how children acquire the unique charac­
teristics of their culture, has largely remained a mystery. Moreover, the 
needs of groups vary according, for example, to the size of the group, its 
internal complexity, external conditions (physical and political), and so 
on. Our functional/emotional framework enables us to explore the basic 
developmental needs of groups and how they meet these needs in order 
to cohere and function under varying conditions. 
Consider one example: For a group to exist, individuals must be able 
to relate to and engage with one another. Without this ability, individu­
als will operate as isolated entities. But how do these basic patterns of 
relating and engaging express themselves in different groups, cultures, 
and societies? Similarly, a group cannot exist without having a way of 
exchanging affective signals that enable rapid communication around 
issues of survival and relationships, such as safety, danger, approval, dis­
approval, acceptance, dominance, rejection, cooperation, aggression, 
caring, and affection. These communicative processes, even more basic 
than the verbal expression and negotiation of these issues, are a defining 
characteristic of all groups and societies, yet evidence different charac­
teristics in different groups and societies. Some groups have much more 
refined preverbal affective signaling systems for certain issues than oth­
ers. Indeed, this is one of the areas in which ethnographers have 
recorded remarkable variations. 
In the pages that follow we will show how developmental needs must 
be met for groups to exist, maintain themselves, and survive. We will 
further show how these developmental needs provide a framework with 
which to understand how groups function and adapt to different chal­
lenges. The developmental framework we are proposing is not intended 
to be a way of classifying or putting values on group processes. Our in­
tention, rather, is to explore the relationship between these processes 
and some of the major concepts that have been used in anthropology 
and the social sciences to characterize groups and societies. 
Our developmental framework enables us to move beyond certain 
polarizing debates that have hitherto dominated anthropology and the 
social sciences. By enabling us to see the universal processes under­
pinning how a group meets its developmental needs, we are also able to 
account for the near infinite diversity or differences among group mem-
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
323 
bers and among groups and societies. Further, our developmental analy­
sis of groups leads to a new way of conceptualizing the relationship be­
tween the invariant and endlessly diverse aspects of human societies. 
Various modern schools of thought have argued that certain uniquely 
human traits account for social and cultural advances, and that insofar as 
such traits are uniquely human they must be biologically innate: en­
coded, perhaps, in the human genome. For many years, the leading can­
didate for such a trait was language, but in recent years theorists have 
searched for a more basic capacity that can account for our development 
of language skills and our complex social behavior. The leading candi­
dates today are "mindreading" and "imitation"; that is, the idea that 
children are preprogrammed to engage in joint attention and to imitate 
their caregivers at some predetermined age, from whence follows their 
ability to communicate symbolically and to perceive social behavior in 
ways that are different from their perceptions of inanimate beings or 
objects.l But we have already seen how a child's capacities for "min­
dreading" or imitation are themselves a product of earlier stages of devel­
opment. That is, only once children have progressed through the earlier 
levels of self-regulation and attention, engaging and relating with care­
givers, becoming two-way communicators and then communicating in 
more complex affective exchanges, do they start to display these joint at­
tentional and complex social imitative behaviors (as compared to earlier 
basic motor imitations). Thus, far from being genetic traits, these, too, 
are learned capacities. 
THE DEVELOPMENTAL FOUNDATIONS 
OF CULTURAL P RACTICES 
In an important cross-cultural study in language development, Kather­
ine Nelson identified two kinds of language-learning styles in American 
and Japanese children; she called these styles "referential" and "expres­
sive."2 Referential children largely use common nouns, whereas expressive 
children use words marking actions or interactions. What was particu­
larly interesting about Nelson's research was her discovery that the dif­
ference between these early language styles reflects a difference that 
Occurs, even before words are spoken to any great degree, in the manner 
caregivers interact with their children, which in turn is a reflection of 
cultural attitudes and practices involved in child rearing. That is, the 

324 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
origin of the difference between referential and expressive language­
learners lies in the different values and related practices that American 
and Japanese cultures use to inculcate in a child a strong sense of indi­
vidualism versus a strong emphasis on social harmony. 
A vivid example of this sort of enculturation is a fascinating experi­
ment conducted with young Japanese and American children in which 
the child was asked to select a colored chip from a pile of blue chips con­
taining a single yellow one in it. Young Japanese children consistently se­
lected a blue chip, whereas young American children consistently chose 
the yellow one. Such behaviors are the result of the countless interactions 
that these children have had with their caregivers: The Japanese children 
have learnt, through the cold stares and unresponsive behaviors of their 
parents in response to behaviors that might draw attention to themselves 
in social situations, that individualistic behavior should be avoided; 
American children learn, through the warm smiles and vocalizations of 
their parents in similar contexts, that such behaviors are highly valued. It 
is through thousands of these sorts of interchanges that the child learns 
what is acceptable, what is felt, said, and done, and what is unacceptable, 
not said, and not done. 
In recent years, social anthropologists have added considerably to this 
picture by showing how such cultural practices shape how a child speaks, 
and intimately connected with this, how a child conceptualizes reality.3 
For example, Penny Brown and Steve Levinson showed how different 
groups employ different frames of reference to organize their spatial ex­
perience. This is not simply a matter of using different terms to carve up 
space; it is literally a matter of seeing space in radically different ways. 
For example, according to our spatial frame of reference, if someone is 
sitting to my left at a dinner table, that person will continue to be on my 
left no matter what might happen to the room in which we are sitting. 
But in the spatial frame of reference of the Tzeltal Indians studied by 
Brown and Levinson, if two individuals from this culture should happen 
to be eating in a revolving restaurant, they would see the spatial relation­
ship between them as constantly changing as the restaurant revolved.4 
Our developmental model adds to this important line of research the 
crucial missing piece linking the child's cognitive, linguistic, emotional, 
and social enculturation with the development and functioning of her so­
ciety. As a child is mastering the successive levels of fIe development, she 
is at the same time becoming a part of her social group in a progressively 
more differentiated way. In other words, the growth of a child's mind and 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
325 
her social development are inextricably tied together. Indeed, the growth of a 
child's mind and the formation of groups are inextricably tied together. 
Early in life, a child's exposure to her group comes largely through her 
parents and immediate family members. As she grows older she engages 
more directly in the larger social group. The processes of emotional dif­
ferentiation and the movement to higher levels of reflection occur in pro­
gressively larger social contexts. But it's the basic intertwined processes 
involved in the child's emotional and intellectual development and her 
social enculturation that tie the individual to the group psyche. This en­
culturation process is not a matter of learning how to use genetically de­
termined abilities according to the specific conventions of the society 
into which one is born; rather, as we have seen throughout this book, the 
development of these abilities, and indeed, the very development of the 
brain, is shaped by these culturally mediated caregiving practices. 
As the child negotiates the early developmental levels through count­
less emotional exchanges with her caregiver, she develops an implicit 
understanding of her society's attitudes towards beliefs and social prac­
tices, norms and values, power hierarchies and the kinship system, and 
so on. In other words, as we described in Chapter 2, long before sym­
bols are used, affective interactions enable the infant and toddler to con­
struct all sorts of patterns; these include the social expectations that 
define the child's sense of self and reality. Symbols, in part, acquire their 
initial meaning from this earlier affective reality. As she slowly expands 
her realms of social experience, from the relationship with her primary 
caregiver into multiple relations with the members of her family and her 
peers, the child forms an ever more complex identity until eventually 
she acquires an identity as a member of her society. 
Throughout this process of enculturation, her early emotional gestur­
ing continues to develop. As the child masters symbols and language, 
she is still communicating at the preverbal level. Symbols keep forming 
and reforming, amplifying and enlarging, because the emotional signal­
ing system continues to operate in ever new meaningful social contexts. 
Even as adults, the beliefs, desires, and intentions that we embrace, the 
institutions, institutional processes, and political figures that we sup­
port, are all informed by implicit emotional processes that in themselves 
define the group's social identity and become a function of it. 
The processes at work here are not uni-directional; rather, our devel­
opment is very much a dynamic process in which levels of reflective 
thinking are influenced by the complexity of emotional interactions 

326 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
that continue to broaden and to differentiate, becoming more accom­
modating and adaptable. The better an individual can discern and ex­
press subtle nuances of meaning, the more complex and differentiated 
her social identity. Therefore, individuals are tied to the social group by 
their emotional gesturing and affect probes; these put group members 
into a constant relationship with their dyadic partners and their nuclear 
and extended families, as well as with larger emerging social groups. 
This vital presymbolic equilibrium is a constant source of the emotions 
that serve as the architect for each person's mind, and equally impor­
tant, as the architect for the institutions and practices that govern the 
larger social groups, which, to exist and sustain themselves, must reflect 
these same affective interests. But because the emotional range of each 
individual and each group is highly distinctive and endlessly diverse, 
within the broad range of universals (such as affect cueing, symbol for­
mation, and relating to others) there are near infinite variations. 
The larger the group or society, the more it must develop a group iden­
tity that can cohere around these variations. For every time a group ex­
pands-that is, from dyad to nuclear family to extended family to small 
community, village, and so on-it becomes more challenging for the 
group to maintain an equilibrium, simply because it has to contend with 
more and more individual differences and variations. Therefore, the larger 
and more complex the society, the more it requires flexible affect gesturing 
to achieve security, governance, and cohesion. 
Not all groups with the same degree of internal complexity possess the 
same degree of flexibility in their affect gesturing. The more constricted a 
group's fie development, the less flexible is its affect gesturing, and thus, 
the less it can tolerate a wide range of individual variations and differ­
ences. Such societies can maintain cohesion in a limited or polarized 
manner; for example, by investing in a charismatic leader, or around 
racial stereotypes, or in superficial physical traits. For a modern multicul­
tural society to achieve cohesion, it needs a flexible range of affect gestur­
ing that creates ways of maintaining security, cohesion, and functioning 
in the midst of the welter of individual and group variations that it en­
compasses. The society can meet its basic developmental needs in such a 
condition, however, only if it attains a high level of reflective symbolic 
functioning and reflective institutions that, by necessity, are informed by 
the ongoing affects that invest those symbols and institutions. 
A good example of the connections between individual development 
and cultural variations can be found in E. T. Hall's autobiography, west 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
327 
of the Thirties.5 Hall recounts how, as a young man in the 1 930s, he 
worked on the construction of dams in the Navajo reservations. He de­
scribes how, when they greet each other, 
White males (and now most white females) grip the proffered hand 
firmly . . .  looking the other party directly in the eye, all of which is in­
tended to convey interest, honesty, and sincerity. But when we would do 
this to the Navajos, it conveyed quite a different message; a direct, unwa­
vering gaze meant anger. . . .  The Navajo greeting does not center on 
showing relative strength and dominance (as it does with two Anglo 
males) but is instead a communication in which there is a mutual assess­
ment of feelings and expression. As two men approach each other, eye 
contact is broken-at about the point where it is possible to begin to 
pick up the details of facial expression. Once this boundary is crossed, 
they look past each other, holding the approaching figure in their periph­
eral field of vision. To look directly at the other is tantamount to swear­
ing at them.6 
But Hall did not learn this lesson from a textbook or by taking field 
notes. Rather, Hall tells the story of how, a stranger in a strange land, he 
slowly began to learn the ways of the Navajo by being thrust into their 
midst. He was forced to abandon his cultural mindset if he was to suc­
ceed, not just in his job, but more fundamentally, in understanding and 
sharing in their unique mode of being-in-the-world. 
It was second nature for a young white male of the period-espe­
cially one who had been given the important job of supervising a road 
crew of Navajo workers-to try to impress them at their first meeting 
by pulling up smartly in his truck, slamming the door shut, marching 
over to the workers and, in a loud and firm voice, making sure to look 
everyone directly in the eye, introduce himself as the new boss. How 
else was he to establish his authority? And if this didn't work, he had to 
slam the door shut even louder the next time, raise his voice and stare 
more fixedly, and perhaps discipline one or two of the more recalcitrant 
workers. But far from obtaining the sort of respectful attention that he 
had expected, Hall's behaviors were met with a stony silence that was 
filled with tension. 
Hall slowly understood that his behavior was construed by the 
Navajo as highly aggressive and even a little bit unbalanced. The fact 
that all the white managers behaved in this fashion only confirmed for 

328 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
them that their supervisors all came from a somewhat deranged race. 
He learnt that, if he were to obtain the attention and cooperation he 
needed from his Navajo workers, he had to arrive at a work site as unob­
trusively as possible and allow everyone an opportunity to adjust to his 
presence before quietly beginning to discuss the day's work; he also real­
ized that he should keep his voice down and avoid direct eye contact. 
And he learned these lessons, but not by consciously employing the 
kinds of "participant observation" techniques that are currently taught 
to anthropology students, and certainly not from his superiors, who 
were oblivious-or perhaps indifferent-to the reaction that their be­
haviors elicited. Rather, he learned these lessons by being sensitive to 
the reaction that his behaviors produced: a disinterest in his presence ex­
pressed through impassive facial expressions and posture; indeed, it was 
so profound that, as Hall put it, "I could live o.r die, and it wouldn't 
have made a particle of difference."7 
It was only years later that, equipped with the tools and mindset of 
an anthropologist, Hall could articulate these fascinating insights into 
Navajo culture. At the time he was unaware of all that was going on. 
Thus, for example, he describes how he came to learn that even the way 
one walked was important: "The agency people clearly thought you 
should stride around like a white man, someone in charge. But I was 
spending most of my time with the Indians and, because I was fortunate 
enough to have what the linguists call a high adaptability factor, found 
myself walking as the Indians do without my being aware of it."8 In 
other words, because of his high adaptability factor, Hall was able to as­
similate the messages being signaled to him at the preverbal level. It is 
for this reason that, as he wrote in his autobiography, "Navajo culture 
became a part of my very being. Already, I found myself avoiding eye 
contact when close to others or talking to them. Already, I was synchro­
nizing my body movements with the Navajo rhythm and tempo, which 
I found to be smoother and more coordinated than my own (most 
whites move rather jerkily). Already, I was learning how to enter and 
leave situations and how to comport myself in ways congruent with 
those of the Navajos."9 
Hall's high adaptability factor is the sort of construct that every an­
thropologist can immediately resonate with, even though they are un­
able to explain precisely what is going on or how one acquires such a 
skill. Indeed, for anthropologists it is almost as if this were some sort of 
special gift possessed by only a few ethnographers for reasons unknown; 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
329 
maybe genetic! But the fie model of development enables us to see 
quite clearly why Hall was able to pick up, intuitively, on the subtle 
rhythms and cadences of Navajo life. The process that Hall was going 
through in his entry into Navajo society was exactly the process that a 
young child goes through in the early stages of development that we 
have outlined. That is, like a young Navajo child, Hall had to go 
through the early stages of attention and engagement, emotional signal­
ing, symbol formation-using Navajo symbols and words-and con­
necting symbols together to define reality in a Navajo fashion. Like a 
young child, he was going through these stages of Navajo enculturation 
by learning, unconsciously, through affect gesturing, which of his be­
haviors were met with stony silence and which were met with quiet ap­
proval or laughter; what could be talked about and which things were 
considered sacrosanct. 
As another example, Hall quickly learned that "to a Navajo, a person's 
name is sacred and is endowed with power; they do not abuse that 
power by calling people by their names to their faces."lo But he was 
never told this explicitly; such a spoken prohibition would, in fact, have 
been antithetical to Navajo norms of appropriate behavior. Rather, he 
learned from the tense facial expressions and avoidant behaviors that 
greeted his requests to be told someone's name that such a question was 
never to be asked in Navajo society. This is precisely what Navajo chil­
dren of the period had to learn. They had to learn that their ceremonial 
names were never to be told to others for fear of misuse, or even witch­
craft; that one should never mention the name of the recently deceased; 
and that it was very rude to ask someone directly, "What is your name?" 
And children were taught all these lessons through preverbal signals, 
long before they could even speak.1 1  
It was because Hall had very flexible affect gesturing skills (Level 4) 
and was so solidly entrenched in his capacity for emotionally differenti­
ated gray-area thinking (eighth stage) and his ability to think from a 
stable internal sense of self (ninth stage) that he was able not only to 
adapt to this completely new mode of being but also to become aware 
of this fact. As he himself remarked: "I did not see these adaptations as 
giving up any part of my own personality, which is a common fear of 
many Americans and their excuse for not taking other cultures seri­
ously."12 That is, because he was solidly entrenched at the lower and the 
higher levels of fIe development-although still a young man-Hall 
became aware that he was intuitively perceiving and responding to the 

330 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
preconscious affective signaling the Navajos conveyed through gestures, 
facial expressions, vocalizations, body posture, and even gait. 
The process that Hall went through applies not just to how one be­
haves, communicates, and perceives reality but also-and, perhaps, espe­
cially-to the more abstract social constructs studied by anthropologists, 
such as kinship. A Navajo child of the period had to learn that what 
marked a Navajo individual was the complicated matter of one's clan. A 
Navajo's clan affiliation came from the mother's line, but the child was 
born for the father's clan and in addition had the clan affiliation of his or 
her maternal and paternal grandfathers, for a total of four clans. One 
could not marry into one's clan (which was considered incestuous) and 
one was under considerable moral obligations to one's fellow clan mem­
bers to provide food and other subsistence items and to protect one an­
other. But the manner in which the child_ learned these norms was 
entirely "intuitive," which in our terms means through presymbolic affect 
gesturing. That is, a young child was not presented with a manual detail­
ing "How to Behave with the Members of Our Clan." Rather, the child 
learned implicitly, from the myriad interactions with clan members, the 
subtle obligations and expectations that extended to fellow clan mem­
bers.I3 One can easily imagine a child's experiencing the disturbingly im­
passive facial expressions that Hall experienced when he transgressed 
social norms; and similarly, the same sorts of subtle smiles, head nods, 
friendly gestures, and animated movements when, like Hall's, their ac­
tions conformed to their culture's sanctioned modes of kinship behavior. 
In this manner, our developmental model helps us perceive the differ­
ent stages or steps through which the enculturation process progresses. 
And as can be seen in Hall's memoir, or Mead's classic Coming of Age in 
Samoa, or Whiting and Edwards's Children of Diferent Worlds, such an 
argument applies not just to the implicit manner of communicating, 
walking, thinking, and behaving, but also to the emotions that they feel 
or the manner in which children think about their physical and social 
worlds. Hall remarks how the difference between the thinking of the 
Navajo and of ourselves is greater than "the difference between Homer's 
thought processes in The Iliad and those embedded in the script for Star 
Trek." But the problem for cultural relativism from the beginning has 
been that of explaining why it is that, underlying these extraordinary cul­
tural variations, children everywhere experience interest, happiness, sur­
prise, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear. Indeed, they all seem to display 
the same basic facial expressions of emotion, such as smiling or showing 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
331 
fear. Moreover, as mentioned in earlier chapters, joint attention and the 
social smile emerge in nearly all children around the age of two months; 
at around three months children everywhere start to react when they 
hear their names; and from six to nine months they start to shake their 
heads to indicate no, and so on. Without an explanation of how these 
steps develop, cultural relativists have failed to persuade a large contin­
gent of nativist theorists in psychology as well as anthropology that these 
very general traits and behaviors that are present in virtually every child 
in every known society are not biological phenomena. 
Our model supplies a critical foundation for cultural relativism by 
clarifying how the basic stages of development outlined in Chapter 2 
lead both to the various universals that have been identified by struc­
turalist anthropologists and to the endless cultural variations recorded 
by ethnographers. To see how such an argument works, consider one of 
the most basic of all universals: All groups engage in some form of com­
munication. Indeed, the very notion of a group whose members could 
not communicate with one another is a contradiction in terms. This 
was the basic insight that Thomas Hobbes articulated when he warned 
in Leviathan that should society ever be allowed to collapse its members 
would revert to a solitary state in which no one could communicate 
with anyone else. Where Hobbes was wrong, however, was in likening 
this condition to the natural state of animals, for as we saw in Chapters 
3 to 5, nonhuman primates do indeed possess quite sophisticated pre­
verbal communicative skills that are essential for the maintenance of 
their surprisingly complex societies. 
Such a point has greater significance for the debate between cultural rel­
ativists and structuralists than might at first appear, for it is precisely be­
cause preverbal signaling is such a primeval phenomenon-precisely 
because of the fact that these learned capacities predate the earliest human 
and even the earliest hominid groups-that this is a universal of human 
society. That is, the caregiving practices that promote the development of 
such universals have been passed down and thus learned anew, not just 
from one generation to the next but even from one species to another, over 
the course of millions of years. Hence, far from being irreducible, univer­
sals are themselves the products of more basic developmental processes. 
Furthermore, the very nature of the processes underpinning universal 
traits and behaviors are such that they allow for infinite cultural varia­
tions around different emotions, beliefs, and social practices. Consider, 
for example, how in American culture one discourages someone from 

332 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
having a conversation without looking one in the eyes by, for example, 
raising one's voice, adopting stern facial expressions, or making aggres­
sive gestures. But Navajo culture does exactly the opposite. Hence, the 
basic universal operating here, namely, co-regulated affect gesturing, 
provides the means for cultural variations. Similarly, consider the sortS 
of affirmative and affirming preverbal responses that greet a young child 
in America who seeks to be the center of attention versus the sorts of 
negative preverbal responses that would have greeted a Navajo child's at­
tempt to engage in similar behaviors. These looks and head shakes and 
vocalizations don't just convey to the child which behaviors are desirable 
and which are unwelcome; they become a core part of the child's personal­
ity. Throughout life, the individual will convey to others, through these 
same sortS of gestures and head nods and vocalizations, which behaviors 
or values or attitudes are desirable and which ِre not. 
The same point applies to the various universals identified by struc­
turalist anthropologists, namely, every society has language, or a family 
structure, or a kinship system, or a folk psychology. These are not some­
how innate traits of human society, behaviors programmed into the hu­
man genome that compel individuals to band together in groups 
around which they must then organize some kinship system or folk psy­
chology. Rather, such universals are the product of the core develop­
mental processes that enable individuals to exist in groups. 
In other words, it is the pattern of reciprocal, co-regulated affective in­
teractions in the early stages of development that helps the child diferentiate 
her own individual personality and helps the group determine its collective 
personality. Some emotional inclinations are part of long co-regulated 
chains that are creative in exploring new directions; others are part of 
shorter chains of interaction that tend to be more rigid and more lim­
ited. Thus, the fie framework looks at the range and stability of those 
interactional patterns that lead to catastrophic affects in a child versus 
those that lead to modulated and regulated affects; for example, where 
there is a cultural sanction to respond to certain behavior by withdrawal 
versus a cultural norm that encourages responses to other behaviors in a 
rewarding fashion. 
The way societal myths and rituals evolve from these implicit pro­
cesses is that, as individuals progress to symbolic levels, they need to 
provide symbolic meaning for what they already know implicitly. That 
is, implicit processes are elevated to the symbolic level where the cul­
ture's implicit beliefs are expressed and elaborated. For example, the 
The Developmental Levels o/Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
333 
culture that is anxious about themes of sexuality may form and invest 
meanings in certain symbols by creating stories or rituals that make sex­
uality taboo and that thereby justify and give meaning to what is already 
felt and maintained through affect gesturing to be a basic truth. The 
culture that creates affect gesturing to inhibit aggression or assertiveness 
and encourage dutiful behavior may create myths and stories that sup­
port that particular theme. A culture that exchanges emotional signals 
that support adventuresome behavior and curiosity often finds myths 
and stories to support a more adventurous outlook, such as the Horatio 
Alger story in American culture. 
Thus, our fie model will enable us to understand the constructs stud­
ied by anthropologists and social scientists, such as semiotic functioning, 
the content of rituals or myths, kinship systems, legalistic structures, and 
socioeconomic status, that have been formulated to characterize groups. 
By seeing the intertwined nature of individual and group processes, we 
can also shed light on one of the major problems that has long stymied 
social theorists: how to account for group behavior that is often quite 
foreign to how the individuals involved normally behave. For example, it 
is now widely documented that individuals can suffer a loss of their per­
sonal boundaries-a loss of control over their feelings and thoughts­
when they come together in a crowd, particularly in regard to certain 
emotions that seem to spread like wildfire, such as fear and anxiety, 
anger, or excitement. Thus we see crowds behave in an irrational manner 
even though the individuals involved normally behave in a perfectly log­
ical and coherent manner.14 Understanding the developmental needs 
and levels of groups provides another lens through which to comprehend 
why the group may function at a fragmented or polarized level, even 
when many individuals are capable of functioning at a reflective level. 
THE DEVELO PMENTAL NEEDS 
AND PROCESSES O F  GROUPS 
As we saw in Part II, at each juncture in human evolution, individuals 
not only developed new skills in communicating and thinking, they also 
deVeloped progressively more complex social relationships, social groups, 
cultures, and societies. The two processes involved here supported each 
other. The ability to relate, communicate, and think made social organi­
zations possible and workable. Complex social organizations provided 

334 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
economies of scale that fostered physical protection, more effective 
means of providing the basics (food and shelter, as well as safety and se­
curity), and allowed time for thinking to be used for innovations, such as 
new inventions or technologies that, in turn, led to more economies of 
scale and more time for thinking, planning, and implementing increas­
ingly complex social, cultural, and economic structures, as well as for ex­
ploring higher levels of reflective thinking. 
Traditionally, anthropologists and social scientists have thought 
about groups in terms of the macroprocesses and systems that enable 
these larger social organizations to function. These (including kinship 
systems, family structures, myths and rituals, classification systems, 
power hierarchies, and socioeconomic status), however, emerge from 
more basic elements in the formation of groups, cultures, and societies. 
We have seen in the preceding sections that we can begin to describe 
these more basic developmental foundations that help explain how 
groups, societies, and cultures evolve and maintain themselves around 
these systems and structures. 
The steps that we have seen in the development of higher-level, sym­
bolic thinking in individuals provide clues regarding the basic devel­
opmental foundations of groups. The links between these needed 
foundations and the levels of individual development, as well as the 
stages of human evolution laid out in Part II, will be readily apparent. 
1 .  First, to exist at all the individuals in a group have to perceive and relate 
to each other sufficiently to provide the attention, safety, and security 
that enables the group's mrvival. 
2. Second, to cohere, the individuals have to be able to form ongoing rela­
tionships that support some degree of a shared sense of reality. By defi­
nition a group is made up of multiple relationships that can sustain 
themselves. 
3. Third, to deal with the basics of safety, danger, acceptance, and rejec­
tion, those in a group need a way of communicating and negotiating 
with one another that's very rapid. The collective actions and interac­
tions required when there is imminent danger or conflict between group 
members requires very rapid "implicit" mutual understanding, made 
possible by rapid emotional gesturing. We saw in Chapter 4 how chim­
panzees, gorillas, bonobos, and even monkeys possess this capacity, 
which accounts for their ability to live in large troops with fairly com­
plex social dynamics. 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
335 
4. Individuals in a group need to be able to come together to solve prob­
lems and work collaboratively. We saw a particularly striking example of 
this phenomenon in our discussion of the sophisticated collaborative 
hunting strategies of chimpanzees in the wild (see Chapter 4). 
5 .  To advance to higher levels of social structure, the group benefits enor­
mously by having symbolic abilities that improve the complexity of 
communication. This enables them to move into higher levels of col­
laborative or reflective thinking. We saw evidence that bonobos in the 
wild possess the rudiments of this capacity, which strongly suggests 
that our earliest human ancestors had also arrived at this level of group 
development. 
6. After groups learn to symbolize, create bridges between symbols (think 
logically), separate fantasy from reality, negotiate rules, and create orga­
nizations, they begin to move up to a higher level where there is gray­
area, or differentiated and multicausal, thinking. In Chapter 5, we saw 
that Archaic Homo sapiens had reached this level of group development. 
Without this ability it's hard to have any sort of advanced social organi­
zation. If groups get stuck at this level and don't go beyond, they be­
come mired in rigid categorizations that lead to prejudice, bias, and 
polarized thinking. 
7. To move beyond this level, a group has to create a shared identity and 
internal standards or ideals as well as institutional processes that support 
these ideals. We will see in Chapter 14 how the peoples of the Meso­
lithic and Neolithic periods were already developing these characteris­
tics, and indeed, that this development was critical for their transition 
from small food-gathering groups to food-producing cultures in which 
larger groups of people (numbering in the thousands) began to live in 
one place in settlements that reflected a conscious design. 
These basic developmental steps do not compete with existing ex­
planatory models. Rather, as we will see in greater detail below, they 
provide a developmental road map to the formation of these important 
explanatory systems and fill in the missing pieces, such as how imita­
tion, language, or group identification develops in the first place. 
The selection of these specific group developmental needs is based on 
what a group requires for its own survival, adaptability, and growth. 
The ways in which groups meet these needs, however, should not imply 
a conscious group choice to pursue a particular goal, such as safety or 
security for its members. Rather, it reveals aspects of how the group 

336 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
functions implicitly. For example, a group that exposes its members to 
danger reveals the characteristics of the group's functioning with regard 
to safety and security. 
Each of these developmental functions that characterize a group can 
occur at varying levels of adaptation. For example, group cohesion and a 
shared sense of reality can occur around a narrow definition of common­
ality, such as skin color, or a broader one, such as being part of a race. 
The former leads to polarized beliefs ("us" versus "them") about other 
groups, whereas the latter is far more inclusive, but, of course, is far 
harder to organize and sustain. The developmental level or level of adap­
tation does not, however, imply a universal value judgment. Different 
patterns may be more or less adaptive. For example, a group that orga­
nizes around polarized beliefs may be quicker to mobilize for a war, 
whereas a group that organizes around reflective, democratic institutions 
may become involved in long debates and take a longer time to mobilize. 
What is clear, however, is that some societies struggle with the basics of 
regulating behavior and forming a cohesive group, but others work on a 
collective self-reflection that generates values and institutions that can ac­
commodate different beliefs and grow flexibly with emerging challenges. 
These group capacities are in part hierarchical in that some mastery of 
earlier capacities is necessary for more advanced ones, although there is of­
ten partial mastery of various levels. For example, security and cohesion 
are basic to the definition and survival of the group and provide a founda­
tion for reflective institutions. In addition, each capacity is applied to 
many societal and personal themes differentially. For example, individuals 
or groups may deal with dependency at an organizational-structural level 
that is more complex than the one they use for dealing with aggression. 
No specific member of the group-who may operate at a relatively 
adaptive or nonadaptive level-defines these societal structures or orga­
nizations, even though the level of individuals making up a group has 
an important influence. Rather, as individuals come together they form 
new organizations that have their own character and operate at various 
developmental levels. 
YARDSTICKS OF GROUP DEVELOPMENT 
A group, community, society, or several societies working together can 
be characterized according to the following developmental dimensions. 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
337 
Group Security 
Providing physical protection from attack is perhaps the most basic of 
all social functions. All the groups that we have looked at in this book, 
ranging from the marmosets and tamarins to modern nation-states, 
have developed preverbal affect gesturing to negotiate their safety. & we 
saw earlier, just as monkeys learn, through the behaviors and vocaliza­
tions of their caregivers and other adults, how to make distinct calls to 
warn the members of the troop of an impending attack,1 5  so, too, we 
warn our infants-and each other-with facial expressions, vocaliza­
tions, and behaviors that such-and-such an action or situation is poten­
tially dangerous. This is not a developmental milestone that, once 
mastered, is rendered redundant; rather, it remains necessary for sur­
vival and well being. 
Without this provision, other forms of social and cultural develop­
ment become difficult if not impossible. Societies range along this di­
mension from the chaos of civil war to the order of highly stable states. 
Within this large range we find various scantily governed nations and 
assorted police states in which citizens vanish without a trace for inde­
terminate reasons; the United States, where rates of murder and violent 
crime are exceptionally high for the industrial West; Canada, which is 
like the United States in many ways but substantially safer; and Japan, 
which sees a minuscule incidence of homicide despite what might seem 
to be an overwhelmingly dense population. 
Cohesion and Shared Allegiance 
Humans are remarkably sophisticated in the sorts of preverbal and ver­
bal techniques they employ to form bonds of common humanity. We 
use items of clothing, jewelry, and body decoration, distinctive ways of 
walking and talking, distinctive kinds of gestures and looks, and distinc­
tive kinds of belief systems and social structures to build our sense of 
shared allegiance. Nor are we the only species capable of such cohesion. 
As we saw in Chapter 4, chimpanzees also build a strong sense of group 
allegiance. 
In some societies, individuals feel a strong sense of mutual obligation. 
Aware of themselves as a society, they recognize a shared destiny and the 
duty of each individual to contribute to and, if necessary, sacrifice for 

338 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
the common welfare. In other societies, individuals feel no such sense of 
unity and shared commitment. Their allegiance may be to some small 
group, region, or subculture that is at odds with others or with the soci­
ety at large, or they may function as atomized individuals looking out 
for themselves and perhaps a small group of close relatives or friends. 
Intentions, Expectations, and Shared Assumptions: 
The Formation of a Collective Character 
Covert emotional communications define the shared assumptions a 
group uses to function successfully, such as the control of aggression, 
power, sexuality, and the like. These tacit or implicit processes under­
lie more overt communications and are a significant component of a 
group's character. Through its caregiving practices, a society communi­
cates these to its young. They deal with basic themes such as safety ver­
sus danger, security versus fear, acceptance versus rejection, approval 
versus disapproval, humiliation versus pride and respect, power and as­
sertiveness versus helplessness, and sexuality and respect for the body 
versus shame and embarrassment. 
We saw a fascinating example in Chapter 3 of how such preverbal 
communicative practices play a critical role in nonhuman primate soci­
eties. Recall what happened when a juvenile male bonobo was caught 
trying to take a piece of sugar cane before the alpha male had given the 
signal to commence feeding? What is so interesting in this example is 
how the alpha punishes the offending juvenile: He stands fully erect, 
has a stern look on his face, and slowly raises his right arm, but without 
making a sound. The juvenile responds by submissively approaching 
the alpha. He receives a token slap on the back, but this symbolic action 
clearly has its intended effect: not only on the juvenile, who forlornly 
retreats to the edge of the clearing, but on the other members of the 
group as well, whose mood becomes noticeably subdued. 
In humans, too, preverbal communication conveys to the rising gen­
eration a strong and lasting sense of what's "correct," thereby transmit­
ting the most fundamental features of its culture and beliefs to its 
youngest members. The learning at this stage is so profound that it re­
sults in something very close to what we think of as "values." To an im­
portant extent, it also structures an individual's sense of self. 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
339 
We are or are not, for example, people who show emotions openly, or 
who maintain a "stiff upper lip," or who adopt a decorous demeanor for 
the sake of propriety. We are or are not people who ask questions about 
why things are the way they are, or who permit sexual innuendo, or 
who place filial obligation above personal fulfillment. People who do 
these things differently are-well-different from us. 
Throughout life, the gestures and expressions of others in response to 
our behavior impart with a power greater than any words could have 
which areas are acceptable to discuss and which are not. Societies and 
subcultures lavishly embroider certain themes and pay only scant atten­
tion to others. The Yiddish-speaking communities of Eastern Europe 
developed a vast gestural and verbal vocabulary for complaint and dis­
paragement that allowed an oppressed people to release their anger, anxi­
ety, and disappointment through humor rather than action. Densely 
populated, socially stratified, and relatively homogenous, the island na­
tions of Britain and Japan instead evolved a finely graduated system of 
courtesy and protocol to lubricate social life. African Americans may ex­
press a gamut of emotions, from bitter sadness to spiritual exaltation, in 
their rich and exquisitely nuanced tradition of vocal and instrumental 
musIC. 
These covert processes, which are imbedded in group procedures 
dealing with basic needs, as well as in the content of emerging symbols 
(beliefs), are different in different cultures and they can lead to varying 
degrees of adaptive or maladaptive organization. For example, some 
groups or cultures employ complex gestures, elaborate procedures, and 
stable reflective institutions to regulate aggression and integrate this di­
mension of life with dependency and caring. Other groups do not have 
elaborate implicit communications involving affective signaling to deal 
with certain themes and so employ the mechanism of splitting emo­
tional polarities when confronted with intense affects; rather than see­
ing another group as sometimes good and sometimes bad and adopting 
an integrated perspective that unites the parts into a whole, these cul­
tures tend to split experience into one or another dimension (believing 
at that moment that only one dimension exists). Such splitting can jus­
tifY enormous hostility when another group is characterized as all evil. 
Groups that tend to maintain nurturing processes that support adaptive 
dependency in the face of intense affects (such as anger, fear, and humil­
iation) facilitate more integrative organizations. Other aspects of the 

340 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
collective character that are formed and maintained by covert processes 
include the degree of individual or group rigidity, the tendency to pro­
ject intentions onto others, the tendency for rapid unpredictable shifts 
in attitudes rather than stable perspectives, and the tendency towards 
impulsive action rather than delay and caution. 
Symbolic Expression 
The themes that are elaborated by a particular society in nonverbal ex­
pression also predominate at the level of symbols. Symbolic expression 
can occur at different levels. For example, a society's level of symbolic 
expression is partly reflected in the relationship of its symbols to its 
deeper values. Are symbolic objects perceived to carry power in and of 
themselves or as representations of important abstract values? Is the na­
tion's flag, for example, sacred in itself, or is it a symbol of "the republic 
for which it stands"? The difference is clearly seen in the contrast be­
tween the Nazi regime's burning of books to suppress ideas it found ob­
jectionable and the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that burning 
the American flag constitutes an act of protected symbolic speech. 
Though desecration of so dear an emblem deeply offends many Ameri­
cans, the Court nonetheless insisted upon separating the physical object 
from the ideas it represents. 
As we examine the levels of symbolic expression a society uses, we 
can see some of the following patterns. Symbols can be extremely con­
crete, barely separated from a direct bodily reaction to a situation or 
stimulus. Thus an individual might mutter "When he said that, I could 
have hit him" in place of actually taking the swing, or "My stomach 
feels tight" instead of taking flight. Shouting curses at an abortion doc­
tor may take the place of shooting him. Such uses of symbols, however, 
are so close to behavioral discharge and so polarized that they cannot 
support any subtlety. 
Only slightly more conducive to abstract thinking are symbols that 
are fragmented, inconsistent, idiosyncratic, and discordant with the re­
ality they purportedly represent. Such symbols do not fit any coherent 
system of significance but exist as islands of meaning separate from 
people's understanding of the world. Communist regimes, like others, 
literally rewrote hisrory-including the references made in official 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
341 
speeches and documents and the textbooks used in schools-to match 
current ideology rather than the common memory of those who had 
lived through the events in question, clearly violating citizens' shared 
sense of reality. Because families continue to transmit to their children 
a more basic nonverbal presymbolic emotional "truth," these symbolic 
fabrications vanish immediately upon the collapse of the dictatorships 
that enforce them. After three generations of Soviet rule, traditional 
elements in Russian culture supposedly extirpated decades ago-the 
church, for example, and nationalism-reemerged as if by magic. 
Older and more fundamental emotional verities had survived beneath 
all the symbolic manipulation and showed themselves again as soon as 
it had ceased. 
This sort of fragmentation and splitting contrasts with a far more inte­
grated system of symbols consistent with a society's pattern of values as 
well as with one another. In societies whose symbols cohere in this way, a 
rational approach to even controversial incidents becomes possible. For 
example, the Israeli government instituted an investigation into its mili­
tary's handling of the massacres of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila 
refugee camps. Although the killings were perpetrated by Lebanese fight­
ers, the Israeli military was in effective control of the large settlements of 
refugees. Israeli investigators came to the politically inconvenient conclu­
sion that Israel bore responsibility, if not direct blame, for the bloodshed 
because the officers in charge did not exercise due caution and discipline 
to ensure the safety of the civilians under their authority. 
The characteristics of a society's symbolic system can also be viewed 
according to its degree of polarization and rigidity, on the one hand, or 
flexibility and integration 011 the other. Southern slave society, for exam­
ple, viewed people with any degree of African ancestry as inherently in­
ferior to those of purely European ancestry. Such polarized thinking 
dissociates one's own group from certain undesirable qualities and proj­
ects these traits on the other, rendering its members frightening, loath­
some, or both. All forms of prejudice against groups of people perceived 
as undifferentiated masses defined by a single characteristic exemplify 
this kind of thinking. 
Slightly more adaptive than polarized symbol systems are those that 
allow a few strictly defined categories of thought and behavior. The 
American electorate's sharp swings in presidential preference reflect such 
constricted thinking. Candidates are perceived by voters as exemplars of 

342 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
particular ideas, ideologies, and character traits rather than as fully 
rounded human beings. However, few chief executives-and none in 
recent history-can fulfill the expectations raised by their campaigns. 
Voters then tend to overreact to a president's perceived failings and to 
choose his opposite as a successor, setting themselves up for yet another 
disappointment. The mass media reinforce such polarized notions by 
covering politics and government as a contest between rivals rather than 
as a set of problems that require solutions. 
At the symbolic level, therefore, we can observe the degree to which 
groups or SOCIetIeS 
1 .  use action rather than symbols to convey intentions (e.g., acting out ag­
gression rather than negotiating the aggressive, but symbolized, intent); 
2. use concrete symbols to represent intentions even when they are intense, 
but easily lapse into fragmented symbols; 
3. become solidified into polarized, all-or-nothing symbolic organizations; 
4. remain rigid in their beliefs in the face of change; or alternatively, 
5. symbolize the full range and intensity of collective intenti:ons in a flexi­
ble and stable manner. 
Institutions that Encourage 
Symbolic Expression and Reflection 
Symbolic expression permits groups to reflect on problems and deci­
sions. Some societies discourage self-critical evaluations, branding them, 
depending on the context, as unpatriotic, traitorous, heretical, or coun­
terrevolutionary. Others have elaborate procedures for weighing issues 
of importance to the society at large-consider, for example, the Koer­
ner Commission report that examined the causes of American racial un­
rest in the 1 970s, or the rigorous self-examination by which the 
German state has worked to rid itself of the remnants of Nazism. 
The legislative apparatus in many democratic states exists for exactly 
the purpose of making decisions by deliberation rather than by fiat. The 
process prescribed by certain European parliaments or the United States 
Constitution is explicitly designed to force reflection, to make it essen­
tially impossible for a nation to make an important decision without 
discussion, and to compromise among the various power centers of so-
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
343 
ciety. Although not always employed as intended, these reflective pro­
cesses involving debate, and often compromise, illustrate the direction 
of reflective societies. 
Functioning consistently at this level is not easy in large groups be­
cause it demands considerable social maturity. But stable reflective 
structures lead to a far more balanced and judicious approach to issues, 
as is obvious from the fact that democracies that require a majority vote 
before they can take action almost never go to war with one another. 
Economic Stability and Growth in 
Reflective Individuals and Institutions 
Even economic trends may be influenced by these patterns. Reflective 
innovators create economic opportunities and carefully weigh invest­
ment decisions. Followers, some of whom may be at less advanced levels 
of symbolic reflection (they are more concrete), may make less in­
telligent investment decisions, swayed by impulse and poorly thought­
out expectations. They can't weigh and integrate all the relevant factors 
as well as they should. Perhaps business cycles reflect the gradual entry of 
this second group, each member marginally less efficient than the one 
before. An atmosphere of economic success may further encourage this 
second group into the market, leading eventually to a downturn in the 
cycle. If a society becomes overly characterized by individuals and 
groups that lack high levels of reflection, economic instability may well 
lllcrease. 
An economic principle based on understanding human development 
can, therefore, be hypothesized. As a market becomes seasoned and the 
innovators take the best opportunities, the marginal utility of each sub­
sequent investment unit tends to go down because there are fewer op­
portunities available for profitable investments and fewer reflective 
individuals to weigh and judge subtle alternatives and make balanced 
decisions. This leads, ultimately, to a downturn. The rate of decline is 
related to the reflective abilities of the individuals and institutions in 
that society. Societies characterized largely by individuals and groups 
that are vulnerable to polarized, all-or-nothing thinking rather than 
subtle, balanced, integrated, reflective thinking will be at risk for more 
sharp downturns, particularly as investment opportunities decrease and 

344 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
the opportunities that are left demand more judgment. In contrast, so­
cieties characterized by reflective individuals and institutions will tend 
towards more gradual downturns and greater potential for corrections. 
If there are a large number of good investment opportunities, this factor 
also slows the downturns. Investment opportunities, however, are also a 
product of the reflective level of the society's individuals and institu­
tions. For example, creative reflective individuals and institutions tend 
to produce new ideas, technologies, and opportunities. This pattern 
therefore suggests that the developmental level of the individuals, 
groups, and institutions characterizing a society significantly influences 
the relative marginal utility of each new unit of investment, especially as 
markets become saturated. 
Stability Through Change 
Sustainable societies are able to change while retaining core values. 
Many modern nations have gone several times from peace to war and 
back while preserving democratic institutions and practices-for exam­
ple, holding elections in wartime and, in the most extreme case, in the 
midst of civil war. In a country that lacks the reflective processes that 
enable stability in a crisis, however, leadership changes only with the 
overthrow of the ruling clique. New policies arise not from electoral 
landslides but from radical upheavals that can result in a new constitu­
tion, flag, and sometimes even name. 
Breadth of Emotional Themes 
In addition to differences in the maturity of institutions, societies also 
vary in how they handle emotional themes. How rich and varied are its 
ideas for dealing with love, anger, competitiveness, obligation? How do 
its literature, art, music, movies, theater, television shows, and news 
coverage deal with these themes? If a group has a large number of words 
or symbolic images for representing and discussing an area of experi­
ence, clearly it can deal more precisely, and possibly more reflectively, 
with that array of feelings than a society able to avail itself of only a few 
roughly differentiated symbols. 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
345 
A group's capacity to deal with and symbolize emotional themes is 
especially evidenced in its child-rearing and educational practices, what 
attitudes it has toward dependency or aggression, and how it embraces 
differences embedded in both covert interactive and overt symbolic 
processes. 
UN IVERSALS VERSUS 
CULTURAL DIF FERENCES: 
COMMON FOUNDATIONS 
The model we have been presenting for the basic needs of groups helps 
us to fill in certain missing pieces in the vast literature that exists in an­
thropology and the social sciences concerned with the diversity and the 
universality of human societies. As the dichotomy between cultural rela­
tivism, which emphasizes diversity, and structuralism, which empha­
sizes universal patterns, attests, this polarized literature has left certain 
basic questions unanswered. For instance, how do the relatively univer­
sal features of human societies allow for variations-different social 
rules, different kinds of language, rituals, and myths-while retaining 
their "structural" features over the millennia? How can near infinite 
variations share stable structural characteristics? 
Refusing to accept the possibility that human behavior could be gov­
erned by biological imperatives, cultural relativists have focused on the 
cognitive, social, linguistic, and emotional variations that can be ob­
served in societies and cultures around the globe. Structuralists have 
focused on the constructs underlying cultural diversities. Because they 
lack a developmental perspective, however, structuralist schools have 
fallen back on a preformationist model of how these universal features 
of human thought and behavior were naturally selected and passed 
down from one culture to the next in the form of the human genome. 
Our developmental perspective addresses both of these questions, 
namely, how do these universals arise, and how do they lead to the myr­
iad cultural differences that have been observed? Each of the "univer­
sals" is itself a product of a developmental process that involves 
"learning" passed on from one generation to another through cultural 
patterns influencing family or small group interactions. To be sure, 
these learned patterns emanate from a complex interaction between 

346 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
biology and experience, each of them mutually influencing the other. 
But the biological contribution as such is not, as we have shown, a pre­
formed advanced behavior but the capacity for pattern recognition and 
construction, both of which develop through experience and learning. 
Endless variation occurs within each of these dynamic developmental 
processes leading to language, basic social patterns, or kinship systems. 
The following diagrams illustrate the contrast between our perspective 
and the sharp polarity that exists in anthropology and the social sciences.

Dynamic Developmental Perspective 
THE ANTHRO POLOGICAL SEARCH 
FOR THE NATURE OF H U MAN NATURE 
The origins of the diversity versus universality conflict in the history of 
Western thought are remarkably ancient. In the fifth century B.C., 
sophists argued that the differences in human cultures being reported 
by Greek travelers were not, as had previously been assumed by pre­
Socratic philosophers, the result of nature alone (physis)-that is, 
handed down by the gods-but were in part the result of custom 
(nomos), or the varying manner in which different societies responded 
to their unique conditions. Western thinking about human nature has 
been dominated by this issue ever since. 
During the Age of Reason, the physislnomos distinction was trans­
formed into the great Rationalist/Empiricist debate. The main source of 

348 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
contention between these views, exemplified in Descartes and Locke, is 
whether the human mind works according to innate built-in principles 
or is a blank slate written on by experience. Not surprisingly, the persist­
ent failure to resolve this issue has led many to search for a solution that 
combines the two; but then, that still leaves us with the same problem 
that the sophists grappled with: the problem of ascertaining which as­
pects of human nature are innate and which the result of environmental 
contingencies. Indeed, some modern thinkers are convinced that, 
armed with the tools of behavioral genetics, we can actually quantify 
how much of the mind is innate and how much is determined by expe­
rience.16 But the very picture of genes on which this thesis rests has been 
vigorously challenged in recent years by dynamic systems theorists,l7 
Despite the endless attempts to move beyond this polarizing frame­
work, the basic issue remains as compelling today as it ever was. I S  It sur­
faces in psychology as the nature/nurture debate; in biology as the clash 
between genetic determinism and dynamic systems theory; in linguis­
tics as the nativist/usage debate; in history as the determinist/pluralist 
debate; in political theory as the Marxistllibertarian debate. In this sec­
tion we will explore the ways our developmental model can resolve 
some of the dilemmas arising from these polarities in anthropology and 
the social sciences. 
In anthropology, the problem emerges in the attempt to account for 
the seemingly endless cultural diversity observed in different societies 
while at the same time constructing a unifying framework through which 
these cultural variations can be understood. It is not just a question of ac­
counting for the different customs and conventions that have been ob­
served, or for the different kinds of kinship systems, rituals, myths, social 
institutions, and cosmologies. At a deeper level, anthropologists have 
struggled with the question of whether, underneath the apparently end­
less diversity, there are certain universals that are a function of the innate 
structure of the human mind, or whether the very manner in which an 
individual thinks and feels as well as acts and speaks is a function of the 
society into which that individual is born. In other words, the great chal­
lenge for anthropology remains that of determining whether human na­
ture is in part innately determined or whether human nature, including 
our biology as well as our minds, is ineluctably enculturated. 
Franz Boas stands out as the father of modern cultural relativism in 
anthropology. Few figures in the history of anthropology have had as 
great an influence as he has had, and not just on their own field but on 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
349 
much broader intellectual currents. Boas, who trained some of the most 
influential of early twentieth-century American anthropologists (includ­
ing Ruth Benedict, Alfred Kroeber, Margaret Mead, and Ashley Mon­
tagu), is most famous for his claim that cultures differ in indefinitely 
many ways and that the variations between different groups are the re­
sult of historical, social, and geographic conditions. He came to this 
view as a result of his early research with the Inuit on Baffin Island. Boas 
was struck by how strongly the Inuit were bound together by a shared 
sense of destiny and reality. Par from seeing them as a "primitive" cul­
ture, he insisted that they displayed a complete and quite advanced cul­
ture that was admirably suited to their conditions. 
Boas was not just questioning the racist ideas dating back to the so­
called cultural evolutionists, such as the English naturalist Charles White 
whose Account of the Regular Gradation in Man, and in Diferent Animals 
and Vegetables; and from the Former to the Latter maintained that "the 
white European, who being most removed from the brute creation, may, 
on that account, be considered as the most beautiful of the human 
race."19 Boas was making the point that the ways in which human beings 
actually think are, like their social customs, endlessly diverse, and that no 
mode of thinking can be said to be more "primitive" than another. In­
deed, according to Boas, even the emotions that human beings experi­
ence or the values that humans embrace are forged by their culture. 
The great problem for Boas's theory, however, is that he had no co­
herent model of the processes whereby a culture influences how a child 
behaves, thinks, and feels; that is, an account, such as we have outlined 
above, of how, through the near infinite variations in the ways infants, 
young children, and their caregivers negotiate the basic six stages of fie 
development described earlier, the caregivers and adults of a group 
shape a child's development. Because Boas lacked a model of the pro­
cesses whereby a child becomes enculturated, his theory of cultural rela­
tivism failed to persuade the legion of social scientists who remained 
convinced that, because certain basic traits are present in virtually every 
society studied, there must indeed be human "universals" in the realms 
of social behavior, cognition, emotion, and language, and that these 
common human traits are universals precisely because they are innate 
biological phenomena. 
Under the influence of Boas's teachings, Benedict and Mead traveled 
to indigenous cultures and began to incorporate observations of human 
emotions, attitudes, and other psychological states into their fieldwork. 

350 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Here, according to Mead, is where anthropology steps in; for the anthro­
pologist can not only provide cross-cultural data, but can also test cur­
rent developmental theories about, for example, the relationship between 
cognitive development and family or social conditions in the template of 
an indigenous culture. Thus, it is through the union of anthropology 
and psychology that we can hope to discover the physis of human nature. 
The problem with this argument, however, is that it renders the psy­
chological anthropologist hostage to the developmental models avail­
able; and those developmental models remained woefully lacking 
throughout the twentieth century. One was forced to choose between a 
series of mechanist models, beginning with early behaviorist theories of 
classical conditioning, and then progressing through mechanist theories 
grounded in cybernetics and automata theory, followed by the sophisti­
cal algorithms of Artificial Intelligence, and culminating in the genetic 
determinist hypothesis that the development of the child's higher capac­
ities is not so much a matter of development as of biological maturation. 
Thus, without a proper developmental framework to work with, Mead's 
program for a psychological anthropology was doomed to remain a 
utopian vision (which, ironically, is the charge that was leveled against 
Mead by later cultural anthropologists). 
The attempt to discover the underlying physis of human nature by 
wedding anthropology to psychology enjoyed one of its greatest ad­
vances in the work of the Harvard anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn. 
According to Kluckhohn, the first task of the anthropologist is to record 
the variations that occur in human forms of life, which encompasses the 
differences seen in body types, languages, and the various sorts of things 
that people make and do. Only then can we identify what humans have 
in common-that is, glimpse the essence of human nature. The fact 
that all human beings undergo the same major life experiences, such as 
birth, helplessness, illness, old age, and death, accounts for some of the 
regularities seen in human societies: the differences between sexes, per­
sons of different ages, the varying physical states of individuals. But 
there are many ways in which social activities, such as daily habits of 
food intake, change biological processes. Thus, a field worker must 
record such diverse things as head shape, health practices, diet, motor 
habits, agriculture, animal husbandry, music, and language. 
Culture, in Kluckhohn's view, is fundamentally different from soci­
ety. The term "society" refers to a group of people who interact more 
with each other than with other individuals and cooperate with each 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
351 
other in the attainment of certain goals. But "culture" refers to the dis­
tinctive ways of being displayed by a group of people. Perhaps most sig­
nificant of all, "culture" refers to the manner in which the members of a 
society communicate with one another, nonverbally and verbally, and 
the things that are understood intuitively, or implicitly. 
Here we can begin to see a definite growing awareness of the impor­
tance of preverbal communicative processes in the structure and func­
tioning of a culture. The developmental forces at work are not simply a 
matter of socialization, that is, of adapting an innate cognitive, linguis­
tic, and emotional template to the particular contingencies of the soci­
ety into which one is born. Rather, what we have seen throughout Part 
III is how the process of co-regulated emotional signaling whereby the 
child develops her cognitive, linguistic, and emotional abilities is the 
very same as the process whereby the child learns which actions, values, 
and attitudes are valued by her society and which are discouraged or 
taboo. That is, the two processes involved here-the growth of the 
mind and the child's enculturation-are internally, not externally re­
lated; they are two different sides of the same developmental coin. 
In practical terms, the great problem raised by the approaches taken 
by Mead and Kluckhohn is that the ways of life being observed are 
completely foreign and can be interpreted only through one's own sys­
tem of values. Accordingly, anthropologists have to learn not just the 
language but also the customs and conventions of that society if they are 
to understand a child's development in that society; and as philosophers 
have shown, to learn a "form of life" by being immersed in it is an enor­
mously complicated matter. Indeed, philosophers have debated whether 
it is ever possible to understand completely a foreign way of life or 
whether our own enculturated modes of thinking and feeling constrain 
our capacity to understand a foreign mindset.20 Thus, it was imperative 
that cultural anthropologists refine the methodological principles devel­
oped by the founder of "functionalism," Branislow Malinowski. 
THE RISE OF FUNCTIONALISM 
Early in the twentieth century it became clear that cultural anthropol­
ogy desperately needed a formal methodology for conducting ethno­
graphic research. Such a methodology was developed by Bronislaw 
Malinowski, the so-called William the Conqueror of British Social 

352 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Anthropology, as Ernest Gellner so memorably described him.2l Over 
the course of his lifetime, Malinowski constructed general rules based 
on his considerable fieldwork for conducting "participant observation." 
That is, anthropologists don't just observe but actually enter the society 
they are studying; they must completely immerse themselves in an in­
digenous culture so that, over several years, they can learn how that 
community "functions" as a social system. 
The basic principle of such a "functionalist" framework is that one 
looks at the role that particular customs, beliefs, and institutions play 
within the social system as a whole rather than viewing them as isolated 
elements, for the function of any one of these items consists in the con­
tribution that it makes to the survival or maintenance of the system of 
which it is a part. Hence the anthropologist must identify the needs 
of the group to show how its particular customs, beliefs, and institu­
tions contribute to the satisfaction of those needs. In other words, when 
anthropology studies a culture, it has to approach it as an integral com­
posed of various institutions, values, and principles. A culture enjoys 
completeness and self-sufficiency when it satisfies the range of basic in­
strumental and integrative needs that confront that society. 
Challenges to this functionalist framework came both from the struc­
turalist school of anthropology inspired by the work of Claude Levi­
Strauss and from the hermeneutic tradition of social explanation, both 
of which we will examine below. A third challenge came from within 
the "functionalist" school itself. The great problem with this approach 
was that one had to show how these cultural items contributed to the 
functioning of the society before one could explain their purpose. After 
all, some particular custom or ritual might be very prominent and yet 
not play a role in the maintenance of that society. 
THE SYSTEMS VIEW O F  CULTURE 
In Steps to an Ecology of Mind, the English-born polymath Gregory 
Bateson argued that anthropologists should avoid constructing systems 
of categories to analyze a society until the actual problems that any such 
system is designed to elucidate have been clearly formulated. According 
to Bateson, familiar categories such as "religion" or "economic factors" 
are really ones that anthropologists make for their own purposes when 
they set out to describe cultures. In place of these familiar constructs 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
353 
Bateson proposed five types of unities that, he argued, afford a much 
clearer picture of the types of mechanisms holding a society together: 
1. The structural aspect of unity: The behavior of any individual in any con­
text is consistent with the behavior of other individuals in other Contexts. 
2. Affective aspects of unity: Behavior is seen as a mechanism oriented to­
wards the emotional needs of individuals. 
3. Economic unity: Behavior is oriented towards the production and dis­
tribution of material objects. 
4. Chronological and spatial unity: Behavior is schematically ordered ac­
cording to time and place. 
5. Sociological unity: Behavior is oriented towards the integration of a ma­
jor unit, the group as a whole. 
Bateson's systems theory introduced not just a much deeper level of 
complexity into cultural anthropology but, more fundamentally, a dif­
ferent manner of viewing the development of a child's cognitive, com­
municative, and social skills; for in his model, learning and teaching 
involve joint participation through social interaction. That is, Bateson 
postulated that a society coheres around fundamental dimensions that a 
child absorbs through her emotional interactions with her caregivers. 
What he was unable to explain, however, was precisely how this process 
of absorption occurs. 
Each of the unities that Bateson postulates demands exactly the sort 
of explanation afforded by our developmental approach to group behav­
ior. It serves to establish an underlying unity in Bateson's theory by clar­
ifying the formative role that specific types of affective interactions play 
in negotiating each of the six early functional emotional stages. In turn, 
the mastery of these stages provides a developmental road map for each 
of Bateson's unities. 
For example, the commonality of behavior across contexts comes 
from the relative mastery of Level 4, co-regulated affect gesturing, lead­
ing to pattern recognition and implicit cultural practices that define the 
"cultural group." Economic concepts involving the relative value of ma­
terial objects, as well as time and space constructs, emerge from all six 
levels as affective (basic needs) patterns and are formed and symbolized 
in quantitative spatial and temporal contexts. Similarly, the social group 
and its practices emerge from the development of engagement, affective 
interaction, and social problem-solving.

THE STRUCTURALIST SEARCH 
FOR CULTURAL UNIVERSALS 
In the search for universals, one figure who most stands out is the great 
French structuralist, Claude Levi-Strauss. Levi-Strauss argued that culture 
is made up of rules and systems the function of which is rarely understood 
by the people who follow them. Some of these conventions are the 
residues of traditions acquired from earlier social structures. Others have 
been unconsciously accepted or modified for the sake of a specific goal. 
In this approach, the anthropologist endeavors to formulate system­
atic laws in several aspects of human thought and action. Such laws, 
which Levi-Strauss regarded as unvarying throughout eras and cultures, 
enable the anthropologist to surmount the apparent anomaly between 
the universality of the human condition and the apparently inex­
haustible diversity of cultural forms. Thus, anthropology is both a struc­
tural and an empirical science, for each culture has to be observed in 
order to reveal the traits that vary from one culture to another as well as 
those that are constant. 
Levi-Strauss's view of methodology is almost the complete opposite 
from Malinowski's. During his field studies in Brazil, Levi-Strauss never 
stayed in one village for more than a couple of weeks; never mastered 
the language or customs of a culture; and relied heavily on interpreters 
for his information. But for Levi-Strauss, that was the whole point of 
the exercise: What one is trying to record, he felt, is precisely one's first, 
initial impression, untainted by the penumbra of anthropological 
theory. In fact, in an interesting twist on Mead's argument, Levi-Strauss 
argued that Western psychology is faced with a fundamental obstacle in 
its quest to disclose the innate principles of the mind, for the mind, ac­
cording to Levi-Strauss, is innately governed by a primitive logic of 
thought. But the Western mind is so thoroughly grounded in logical 
modes of thinking that it is virtually impossible to disclose the universal 
primitive logic of the mind. Hence one seeks to study primitive societies 
that have been as unaffected as possible by Western influences. 
The key to Levi-Strauss's theory is that it is based on what is known 
as the "inferential model of perception." According to this theory, what 
we really "see" are sense data that the mind must organize according to 
certain principles that are hardwired into the human brain. In Levi­
Strauss's anthropological version of this inferential model of percep­
tion,22 we can discover the kinds of principles that the brain uses to 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures

organize experience by examining kinship systems, mythologies, and 
primitive classification systems, for these cultural phenomena are said to 
display certain structural patterns that are a reflection of how the brain 
. 
. 
orgalllzes expenence. 
For example, the color spectrum is a naturally occurring continuum. 
But the brain organizes this phenomenon in discrete terms: It sees color 
as binary opposites (e.g., black and white, red and green). The brain 
then searches for intermediary positions to bridge the gap between these 
binary opposites (gray, yellow). There are various cultural phenomena 
that mirror the structural pattern of this experiential phenomenon, for 
example, the traffic light system, which represents binary actions (stop 
and go) with color opposites (red and green) and an intermediary action 
(proceed with caution) with the corresponding intermediary color (yel­
low). It is in this sense that the structural patterns observed by anthro­
pologists are said to be a reflection of underlying mental universals.23 
Thus, Levi-Strauss combines a realist view of nature with an inferen­
tial theory of perception to discover underlying structural patterns that 
can be observed in all cultures. These universal patterns, Levi-Strauss in­
sists, are not environmentally or socially determined phenomena, but, 
rather, they reflect the basic manner in which the mind organizes expe­
rience. These organizing principles are said to be prior to rather than a 
product of enculturation; that is, they are basic cognitive principles that 
make social existence possible.24 
To be sure, the "surface" differences between cultures can be so strik­
ing that they arrest our attention to the point that we cease to ask our­
selves about the underlying or "deep" universal features of experience. 
So even though different cultures may have what on the surface appear 
to be vastly different kinds of kinship systems, these are of no concern 
to Levi-Strauss; all he is interested in are the deep, structural regularities. 
That is, no matter how different kinship systems might appear, we will 
discover structural universals running throughout this diversity. And 
these structural universals, according to Levi-Strauss, are a function of 
the innate structure of the human mind. 
It is not surprising, given the nativist foundation underpinning Levi­
Strauss's argument, that in recent years the search for cultural universals 
has turned its attention to evolutionary psychology. The paradigm for 
this argument is Chomsky's generativist view of language (although, it 
must be stressed, Chomsky distanced himself from Levi-Strauss's use of 
language as an analogy for culture). But what appeals to contemporary 

356 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
cultural universalists is Chomsky's distinction between the "depth struc­
ture" of language and its "surface structure," where the former is the 
underlying abstract structure that is a reflection of the "forms of 
thought."25 Such a distinction offers an inviting paradigm for a corre­
sponding distinction between the depth structure of cultures and their 
surface variations. That is, every culture might adopt vastly different so­
cial conventions for what is regarded as appropriate behavior towards 
different categories of agent within the society, but what is universal is 
that each culture has some form of convention for regulating social be­
havior. Furthermore, as we saw in Chapter 9, Chomsky's argument is 
grounded in the genotypic hypothesis that sometime during the Pleis­
tocene a language gene must have been selected. Given the enormous 
success that his theory enjoyed in the late twentieth century, it is not 
surprising that structuralists and evolutionary psychologists appealed to 
Chomsky's "language gene" argument to support their adoption of the 
hypothesis that cultural universals were also genetically selected during 
the Pleistocene.26 Indeed, such an argument becomes self-reinforcing 
insofar as these cultural universals must encompass language. 
We can take a simpler example to illustrate how this argument works 
and why it resorts to genetic determinism to support the existence of cul­
tural universals. Consider the fact that every human culture has its own 
unique system of gestures. To be sure, some cultures gesture far more than 
others; but to a greater or lesser extent, every culture gestures. But despite 
extensive efforts to construct a universal "dictionary" of gestures, it turns 
out that even the simplest of gestures, such as those expressing consent 
and negation, can vary in quite significant ways between cultures.27 
Rather, what is universal are certain more general properties; for example, 
some gestures are purely indicative or declarative, some are mimetic, and 
so on.28 Thus, the evolutionary psychologist concludes that there must be 
some sort of genetic template for gesturing that is modified by social con­
vention from one society to the next. Different cultures may have differ­
ent conventions for expressing consent gesturally; but what every culture 
has in common is some gestural method of expressing consent. And the 
hypothesis that gesturing must be hardwired into the human brain can be 
further supported by the fact that we gesture unconsciously while we 
speak; we even gesture, completely oblivious of doing so, when there is no 
need to gesture, such as while speaking on the telephone. 
We have already seen, however, how the child's gestural capacities de­
velop through long sustained bouts of co-regulated emotional signaling, 
The DeveLopmentaL LeveLs of Groups, Societies, and CuLtures 
357 
and indeed, how the great apes go through similar stages of gestural devel­
opment (see Chapters 3 and 4). One of the most vivid examples of the de­
velopmental processes that are at work here can be found in deprivation 
studies. In a particularly famous experiment by Edward Tronick, caregivers 
were told to look at their four-month-olds with a completely impassive 
face and to resist all temptation to smile or coo.29 The babies responded by 
making an extra effort, through smiling and vocalizations, to coax their 
caregivers to reciprocate. When these actions met with no response, the ba­
bies soon became irritated and their gestures became increasingly disorgan­
ized and purposeless. At last they became withdrawn and listless, and when 
the caregivers were told to resume their normal interactive behavior, it took 
some time to reengage the child, despite the caregiver's energetic attempts. 
In the middle of the twentieth century, Bowlby described (and later 
James Robertson illustrated with remarkable films) what happens when 
a young child goes to a hospital and is separated from her primary care­
givers. Protest and anger give way to despondency and withdrawal and a 
loss of capacity for affect gesturing. Similarly, Spitz described and filmed 
the self-absorption and lack of affective gesturing that occurs in institu­
tional settings where infants are cared for physically, but not engaged in 
affective interactions. Harlow and Soumi have described similar pro­
cesses.3o Most important, we have found that deprived children can 
learn affect gesturing in a special therapeutic program.31 In addition, in 
our work with children with autistic spectrum disorders, who also have 
limitations in this system, but for different reasons (biological ones), we 
have found it is possible also to help them learn affect gesturing. 
There is thus considerable evidence that affective gesturing is learned­
not hardwired-and must progress through the stages we have outlined. 
LINKING THE UNIVERSALS OF H UMAN 
NATURE WITH CULTURAL D IVERSITY 
From the point of view of the cultural relativist, our model of group de­
velopment may seem to be too firmly ensconced in the structuralist fam­
ily of anthropological theories; and from the structuralist vantage-point, 
the argument might seem to be far too imbued with relativist ideas. The 
fl e developmental model does indeed have elements in common with 
both schools of thought. On the one hand, our model offers a way of 
understanding developmental processes that accounts for the endless 

358 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
cultural variations that ethnographers have observed and, on the other, a 
way of looking at the developmental steps that lead to relatively universal 
human processes that underlie the diversity. But, as we have shown, the 
relatively universal characteristics such as the capacity to communicate 
with gestures in general (rather than any specific gesture or "content") of­
ten has a learned, developmental sequence and is, therefore, not hard­
wired as often alleged. 
For example, consider the incest taboo. According to Levi-Strauss, the 
incest taboo is the defining feature of culture: It makes us human by reaf­
firming the separation of humanity and culture from nature.32 But al­
though most human societies have some form of incest taboo, not all 
these societies have the same incest taboo. Anthropologists have explored 
three basic kinds of explanation for this phenomenon: psychological 
(e.g., Freud's hypothesis that incest would disrupt the hierarchical au­
thority structure of a family and lead to rivalries and violence within 
small groups);33 sociological (e.g., Malinowski's argument that incest 
would impair the socialization of a child);34 and biological (e.g., the ar­
gument that incest avoidance serves to lower the incidence of congenital 
birth defects, and thus was naturally selected). Arguments for and against 
each of these hypotheses have been widely discussed and it is not our in­
tention to review here the pros and cons of each position. Rather, our 
concern is with how our developmental model suggests an alternative ex­
planation of the genesis of the seemingly near universal human aversion 
to incest and the mechanism involved in the transmission of each cul­
ture's version of the incest taboo. 
We have already seen how, to get to the fourth stage of fie develop­
ment, evolution favored those practices that enabled hominid infants to 
enter into long chains of co-regulated emotional signaling with their 
caregivers, and that for such an ability to develop, it was critical for in­
fants to learn how to tame their catastrophic emotions. In our discus­
sion of this process in Part II, we naturally focused on the sorts of 
practices that hominids might have adopted to facilitate this develop­
ment; but the converse side of this argument is to consider what sorts of 
practices early humans would have avoided to prevent provoking cata­
strophic reactions in their infants. And the overstimulation of an in­
fant's genitalia would naturally fall under the last category. 
Thus, we might see the incest taboo as part of the general process in 
human evolution of developing caregiving practices that would promote 
a child's capacity to regulate her mood and behavior, which, as we saw in 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
359 
Chapter 2, is a critical step on the path towards long chains of co­
regulated affect gesturing that, in turn, leads to developing symbolic and 
language abilities, including the basic capacity to produce finely regu­
lated motor-vocal patterns. Furthermore, the incest taboo would have 
been transmitted through these very same caregiving practices. Children 
would have acquired their culture's attitudes toward incest through sub­
tle emotional signals in which parents convey that one's private parts are 
different from the other parts of one's body and that they can't be 
brought into pleasurable interaction (e.g., tickling the tummy). That is, 
parents would have responded differently-through facial expressions, 
vocalizations, even aversive behaviors-both to touching their child's 
genitalia and to having their own genitalia touched. Many parents con­
vey their special feelings about the genitals by excluding them from rou­
tine interactive games that involve rubbing the hands, legs, or tummy. 
We can see precursors of the incest taboo in the avoidance of inbreed­
ing amongst different animal species. But what is particularly interest­
ing here is that, although we see mother-son avoidance in, for example, 
macaques and baboons, in chimpanzees and bonobos we actually see 
cultural variations in inbreeding behavior. Some groups of chimpanzees 
avoid inbreeding, others do not. A moderate amount of inbreeding has 
been observed in the chimpanzees at Gombe, perhaps because the 
chimps living there are so isolated that there is relatively little opportu­
nity for the sort of female migration that is normally seen amongst 
chimpanzees.35 Thus, whereas the avoidance of inbreeding appears to be 
a hardwired behavior in the lower primates in which this occurs, one 
can discern flexibility concerning this practice in the great apes, suggest­
ing the influence of culture and learning. 
What our developmental model draws attention to is that only in a 
species that has begun to master the fourth level of fie development 
could one expect to see such cultural variation. For only such a species 
possesses the ability, through its more subtle affective signaling, to 
change attitudes towards inbreeding or to adopt a variety of them. 
Thus, far from being forced to postulate some sort of fail-safe genetic 
mechanism to explain how it is that these apes are able to respond in 
such a manner to social isolation, we can see how the group is able to re­
define its attitude towards inbreeding. 
Furthermore, our developmental model suggests that the incest 
taboo, as it is known, is specific to species that have negotiated the fifth 
stage, 'mastering the creative use of symbols and words. Bonobo chimps, 

360 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
as indicated in Part II, only partially master Level 4 and, therefore, are 
limited in their symbolic capacities. Humans can engage in much longer 
series of co-regulated affective exchanges and, therefore, can "encultur­
ate" new offspring with far more complex social capacities and "norms." 
A similar approach can be applied to any of the basic universals and 
their cultural variations studied by anthropologists. Our developmental 
model provides a way of reinterpreting the observations that have led to 
the different schools of thought within anthropology and the social sci­
ences. It offers a new model for understanding the full complexity in 
the universal and relativistic features of human functioning in individ­
ual, group, and cultural contexts. As we have seen, the ability to form 
and give content to symbols, or to share in the collective stories that 
characterize a culture, depends on a series of developmental steps that 
both the individual and the society need to master, Family, kinship sys­
tems, and community structures-that is, the very ability to form rela­
tionships of any kind-also depend on how individuals and groups 
meet these basic developmental needs. 
As we apply our developmental lens to different groups, it is impor'­
tant to emphasize that a group may negotiate different fie developmental 
levels for different aspects of its experience. Dependency and nurturing 
care may be at a different level than dealing with aggression. The fie de­
velopmental model can, therefore, help us understand the ways in which 
different groups deal with certain themes, such as dependency or aggres­
sion. Are they reflective with that theme? Or do they tend to use impul­
sive actions with that theme? Do they integrate many different subtleties 
around that theme, such as the many nuances of intimacy, warmth, and 
love, or are they polarized ("You either love me or hate me")? In and of 
itself, however, this developmental perspective does not provide a value 
judgment. Rather, it provides a profile that helps to describe the different 
ways in which different experiences are handled in different groups. 
THE H ERMENEUTIC TRAD ITION 
Another of the great challenges to functionalist thinking came from 
within the ranks of cultural relativists and stemmed from the hermeneu­
tic tradition in the human sciences. We begin here with the thought of 
Emil Durkheim (1 858-1917), the great nineteenth-century French soci­
ologist. Durkheim set out to establish sociology as a science that as such 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
361 
studies a unique realm of human phenomena, different in kind both 
from the physical world (the province of the life sciences) and the mental 
(the province of psychology). Sociology is concerned with the analysis of 
"social facts"-laws, conventions, automatic actions-that can be treated 
as "things" just as much as material objects, even though they belong to a 
different logical category. "Social facts" are "ideas" (representations) in 
the "collective mind" (the arne collective, or conscience collective) of a so­
ciety; that is, something that exists over and above the individual mem­
bers of the society and that has concrete effects on the behavior of the 
members of that society. For example, we may not be conscious of 
the rules proscribing how to dress but we nonetheless follow them. Simi­
larly, different societies have different rules about how close to stand to 
one another in different circumstances. We all follow these rules quite 
unconsciously, unaware of how carefully we regulate the distance we put 
between one another, for example, when standing in a crowded elevator, 
standing in a line, or having an ordinary conversation on the street. 
Durkheim built up a Darwinian scenario about the evolution of soci­
eties based on this notion of the "collective mind." The simplest form of 
social organization is said to be the "horde," in which individuals are at­
tached to the group by their adherence to the same powerful set of col­
lective representations. The more complex a society becomes, the 
weaker is said to be its "collective conscience" and the more that society 
is bound together by the complex interdependence of small groups to 
which individuals are bound by their shared "collective representations." 
In these assertions, Durkheim is suggesting developmental steps leading 
to cohesion at different levels very similar to the ones we have proposed 
(earlier this chapter). 
What is missing in Durkheim's model is an account of how these 
"collective representations" are imprinted on the mind of the individual, 
a matter that Durkheim believed would eventually be resolved by psy­
chology. The same assumption carried through in the work of Ferdi­
nand de Saussure (1 857-1913), who in turn had a profound influence 
on Levi-Strauss. Saussure was heavily influenced by Durkheim's concep­
tion of social facts. According to Saussure, the linguist must distinguish 
between two different sorts of things: langue and parole. The former is 
the abstract system that, as social fact, exists over and above the individ­
ual speaker. Parole consists of the tangible speech sounds that the lin­
guist can observe. If two people speak the same language, then they 
must understand each other. If two people do not understand each 

362 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
other, then they cannot be speaking the same language. When a lan­
guage speaker speaks she is simply using the langue that is imprinted on 
her brain (and the brain of anyone else in her community whom she 
speaks with). Langue is thus a "social fact" in the sense spelled out by 
Durkheim; that is, something that exists over and above the individual 
members of the society. 
How langue comes to be imprinted on the mind of the individual 
was, Saussure believed, a matter for psychologists to address; the lin­
guist's task was solely to discover the rules the language speaker follows, 
even though the language speaker is not conscious of following those 
rules. The fie framework provides us with precisely the sort of psycho­
logical explanation that Durkheim and Saussure anticipated. We have 
already seen how the ability to use symbols to sequence and organize the 
world and form a higher level of pattern construction rests on a contin­
uous Row of affective interaction that enables a child to separate percep­
tions from actions and thereby form symbols (see Chapter 2). A baby is 
able to recognize patterns in all the sensory areas of her experience: vi­
sual, spatial, auditory, tactile, motor. Usage linguists have shown that 
these patterns can be grammatical; for when humans communicate lin­
guistically, they string symbols together into sequences. Patterns of use 
emerge from these co-regulated symbolic interactions and through con­
stant repetition become stable features of linguistic communication: a 
process that usage linguists refer to as "grammaticalization." In fact, as 
we explored in Chapter 7 on language, the fie developmental model 
emphasizes the role of affect and intent in creating operational gram­
mar. As we described, to convey affective intent, which is intrinsic to 
getting needs met through co-regulated, affective interactions, the child 
needs to combine verbs and nouns together in patterns-"I want juice." 
As needs and goals become more complex, so do affect gesturing and 
grammatical structures-"I want juice now" and, in adolescence, "I 
want more juice now, you turkey!" 
We have already seen such a phenomenon in Chapter 4 in our discus­
sion of the bonobo Kanzi's remarkable linguistic achievements. It was 
by being engaged countless times in the day-to-day activities of life at 
the Language Research Center, for example, fetching a botde of juice 
from the fridge or putting his toys back into the box, that Kanzi was 
able to understand grammatical sentences such as "Get the juice that's 
in the fridge" and "Put the toys into the box." At first this extraordinary 
breakthrough in ape language research aroused the concern that the 
The DeveLopmentaL Levels of Groups, Societies, and CuLtures 
363 
sorts of simple grammatical patterns that Kanzi was mastering could 
not explain the more complex kinds of linguistic constructions that 
young children master. But in recent years, usage theorists have shown 
that exactly the same picture applies to human language acquisition; 
that is, by constant exposure to grammatical patterns in the language 
that envelops her day-to-day activities with her caregivers, the child 
does indeed develop the sort of implicit knowledge of grammatical 
structure that Chomskeans thought could never be acquired but must 
rather be innately present at birth.36 
One of the great advances in the development of sociology was due 
to the thought of Max Weber (1 864-1920). Weber's basic idea-which 
he developed on the basis of Dilthey's argument about the nature of the 
"human sciences" as an interpretive endeavor-was that sociology must 
wed causal explanation with interpretive understanding. According to 
Weber, what makes an action social is the meaning attached to it by the 
actor. That is, just having an effect on another actor does not render an 
action social. For example, if I trip on a crowded sidewalk, thereby caus­
ing someone else to topple over, my action is not in itself "social." How­
ever, in one of Weber's examples, if two cyclists see that they are about 
to crash into each other and try to avoid this, then their actions have a 
social character. 
The meaning that we assign to the actions of others depends on our 
knowledge of the norms and standards regulating their behavior in 
such-and-such a context. So, for example, my knowledge that the driver 
ahead of me intends to turn right at the next intersection is grounded in 
my knowledge of the rules of driving (the use of turn indicators). Thus, 
when explaining social patterns, or regularities, the sociologist must ex­
plain the subjectively intended "meaning" of the actions for the individ­
uals concerned in order to arrive at a causal explanation of the causes 
and effects of actions. That is, in understanding the motive for an ac­
tion, one understands it both as a cause of the action and its meaning. 
Weber's argument raises a profound question, which was widely dis­
cussed by philosophers in the 1960s and '70s, about the relationship of 
motives, wishes, and intentions to actions. Weber construed this rela­
tionship as causal, on the paradigm of physical causality; but much care­
ful philosophical elucidation has explained the categorical distinction 
between physical causation and the sociological explanation of actions 
in which motives, wishes, and intentions are construed as the reasons as 
opposed to the causes of actions)? But such an argument does not obviate 

364

the problem that Weber was highlighting here, namely, that the very na­
ture of human functioning challenges us to use hermeneutic tools as 
well as methodologies developed by the natural sciences. 
BENEATH THE SURFACE OF GROUPS: 
CONTRIBUTIONS FRO M  DEPTH PSYCHOLOGY 
In addition to his work on individuals, Sigmund Freud also looked be­
neath the surface describing irrational forces operating in groups. In the 
early 1 900s, when Freud was formulating his basic themes, Wilfred 
Trotter was writing about the "herd instinct." He hypothesized a basic 
instinct for individuals to be part of a larger entity, akin to a multicellu­
lar organism. Gustav Le Bon was exploring the phenomena of crowds 
and observed that these groups operated irrationally with "contagion" 
and "suggestibility." William McDougal, in the 1920s, observed that in 
groups, the emotions of one group member tended to synergize the 
emotions of another, leading to intense irrational actions. 
Freud sought to clarify these hypotheses with a more comprehensive 
theory. He hypothesized that individuals projected components of their 
intrapsychic lives onto a leader (namely, their primitive ego ideal) and 
that this process, in which the standards of the leader replace those of 
society, provided the group with its force, its seeming immorality, its 
lack of reflectiveness, and its irrationality. These projected intrapsychic 
components were based on early primitive irrational processes. 
The primal horde with its feared, powerful leader was the model for 
Freud's concept of the group: The group's members work together 
through fear of aggression and destruction that destroys the leader and 
threatens the members. Suggestibility, identification, and other related 
phenomena were operative processes. 
Since Freud, psychoanalytic observers have further developed these in­
sights describing elements in a group's irrational infrastructure that relate 
to early developmental processes. For example, Wilfred Bion developed 
methods of exploring group processes and described the irrational inter­
active processes in groups that must be dealt with for rational problem 
solving to occur. He described how group members become dependent 
on the leader, develop fight/flight patterns with an imagined outside 
danger or foe, and form pairings with magical, grandiose expectations. 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
365 
Eliot Jaques saw the group as a social system to deal with potential irra­
tional persecutory feelings. Otto Kernberg explored the group process in 
relationship to the projection of early primitive aggression and the projec­
tion of related intrapsychic components (e.g., the super ego). Didier 
Anzieu and Janine Chassquet-Smirgel explored the processes of fusion as 
well as the projection of primitive intrapsychic contents and the concomi­
tant creation of illusions and ideologies. 
The developmental framework presented in this work looks at the ir­
rational elements in groups systematically in terms of contributions 
from different developmental levels. This framework integrates our un­
derstanding of irrational and rational elements in group processes as 
well as the contributions from other disciplines. Unlike much of the 
work just mentioned, it also looks at motives for group cohesion that do 
not derive from fear of aggression but emanate from the capacities for 
relating to others and empathy. 
UNITING THE DESCRI PTIVE (HUMANISTIC) 
AND NATURAL SCIENCE TRAD ITI ONS 
Traditionally, humanistic approaches that focus on subjective meaning, 
and natural science, which focuses on replicable experiments of measur­
able phenomena, have existed in independent realms. The former is 
part of literature, philosophy, and, more broadly, the humanities, 
whereas the latter has come to dominate the "hard" sciences. Depth psy­
chology (e.g., psychoanalysis), cultural anthropology, and sociology, 
however, appear to need both approaches. To illustrate this principle, 
we might return to the grammaticalization example discussed above. 
We saw how usage linguists have shown that a child develops her im­
plicit knowledge of grammatical structure through constant exposure to 
the grammatical patterns embedded in presymbolic and symbolic com­
munications. What we also need to bear in mind here is the point, dis­
cussed in Chapter 9, that recent evidence has shown that when the 
human nervous system is engaged in this type of affectively mediated 
growth it is also likely laying down new pathways; these are not the result 
of a genetic blueprint but of some fundamental capacities that are now 
being defined and redefined and organized and reorganized at new levels 
through interactions with the afective world. Such an argument would 

366 
T H E  F I RST I D E A  
apply to the formation of the so-called language centers in the left peri­
sylvan region of the brain. Thus, the fie developmental model also ac­
counts for the sorts of findings in aphasiology that further encouraged 
Chomskeans to postulate that the child must be born with a genetic 
blueprint containing the plans for her language centers. Also relevant to 
this blending of the subjective and the quantifiable is Terrence Deacon's 
interesting argument that the very structure of language is a reflection of 
the structure of the human brain-that is, natural languages evolved in a 
way that conforms to the natural pattern-recognition capacities of the 
human brain38-and Sonia Ragir's research showing that language genesis 
is constrained at three epigenetic levels: between cortical and subcortical 
structures, between the ontogeny of the brain and the activity of the in­
dividual, and between the development of the individual and the adapta­
tion of the group to its environment.39 
One of the primary figures in the development of the view that an­
thropology should not, as was argued by Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, be 
seen as a natural science but rather as a member of the Geisteswis­
senschaften was the Oxford social anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard. 
Where Radcliffe-Brown was interested in the role that institutions 
played in maintaining social structure and solidarity and in determining 
an individual's emotions, Evans-Pritchard sought to show how anthro­
pology should be seen foremost as an interpretative discipline. 
According to Evans-Pritchard, there must be uniformity and regular­
ities in social life that serve to establish some sort of order; otherwise, a 
group of diverse individuals could not live together. It is only because 
people know what kind of behavior is expected of them and what to ex­
pect from others in the various situations of social life that they can co­
ordinate their actions under the guidance of various rules and informed 
by the values of their culture. They can make predictions, anticipate 
events, and lead their lives in harmony with their fellows because every 
society has a moral form or pattern. Thus, the anthropologist is engaged 
in the study of normative, not natural, phenomena, which as such must 
be interpreted to be understood. 
But then, how do individuals come to know what kind of behavior is 
expected of them and what to expect from others? How do they come to 
make the predictions and to anticipate events that, as Evans-Pritchard so 
rightly stressed, enable them to live in harmony with their fellows? It has 
long been clear to social theorists of all persuasions that such knowledge 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
367 
is rarely taught, and, indeed, that such knowledge is rarely explicit. 
When an earlier generation of cognitive scientists sought to answer this 
question they assumed that, since such knowledge was not conscious, it 
must be preconscious: a construct that was heavily influenced by Artifi­
cial Intelligence models of the kinds of processes that the brain as com­
putational organ must go through while processing information. On this 
line of thinking, the brain must be primed to make predictions, be this 
of physical phenomena or social behavior. That is, the brain is like a 
powerful computer, programmed with some very general processing 
strategies, just waiting to be fed information. 
In contrast, in our developmental model, the ability to make predic­
tions, which begins to emerge at our third level of development in terms 
of pattern expectation, continues to develop throughout the following 
stages, and then to develop at a high symbolic level at the ninth through 
sixteenth stages in terms of affectively valuing and even quantifying fu­
ture possibilities, does not arise until the child is able to attend and self­
regulate and to engage and relate with her caregivers. Furthermore, the 
child's progression through these stages is not some sort of predeter­
mined maturational phenomenon but rather, as we saw in Chapter 2, 
depends vitally on the sorts of practices in which caregivers engage to 
promote the development of these capacities. 
Such an argument contributes a critical foundation to Evans-Pritchard's 
basic hypothesis that anthropology studies the sorts of practices and tech­
niques that the members of a society must master to manage social rela­
tions. The significance of such practices, Evans-Pritchard pointed our, 
cannot be explained without understanding what they mean to the partic­
ipants in the society. But then, the participants in a society may themselves 
be unable to explain the meaning of such practices. Hence, social anthro­
pology, as an interpretative discipline, must account for the different types 
of procedural and implicit knowledge that underpin a society and for how 
this knowledge is acquired. 
Furthermore, Evans-Pritchard's argument exemplifies how universals 
provide us with frames of reference within which there can be endless 
variations. For that is precisely the point of his "levels of abstraction." 
Along these lines, our developmental model suggests that each stage of 
fie development is a new, relatively universal feature of human func­
tioning. With each new stage and new "universal," there is a new lens 
through which to view the near-infinite variations that occur in social 

368 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
behavior. The very same emotional signaling that underpins these ubiq­
uitous social patterns allows for endless variations within those patterns, 
in much the same way that mixing pigments together enables us to 
paint, but the paintings we can make are infinitely diverse. The lens of 
"thinking off an internal sense of self and internal standard" affords near 
infinite variation in "content." 
The same issue arises in regards to the structural-functional theory de­
veloped by the Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons, who did so much to 
expound and develop the views of Durkheim and Weber. Parsons saw so­
cieties as open systems that are constantly responding and adjusting to 
changing environmental and political contingencies. Hence, the funda­
mental problem faced by any society is what he called "boundary main­
tenance": establishing a set of criteria by which individuals identify 
themselves as members of that society. This is precisely the point that we 
looked at earlier in this chapter when we considered the different prac­
tices that Japanese and American caregivers engage in with their infants. 
According to Parsons, societies are complex systems composed of 
many interdependent subsystems-cultural, political, economic-each 
of which is also bound together by a common set of values. Hence, "so­
ciety" as such is the highest order of the collective as defined by a set of 
values that enable its members to identify with each other as members 
of that "distinctive institutionalized culture."40 But conspicuously 
missing in his theory is an account of the developmental processes 
whereby the individuals in a collective come ro develop the shared 
sense of reality-what he referred to as a group's distinct mode of 
being-in-the-world-which, according to his theory, is the glue that 
holds society together. 
The same point applies to the work of one of the most important 
contemporary social scientists, the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. 
Bourdieu argues that modern society employs two primary systems of 
stratification: economic (one's status is determined by one's capital) and 
cultural (one's status is determined by one's "symbolic capital"). All human 
action, according to Bourdieu, takes place within social fields in which in­
dividuals, groups, and institutions compete for limited resources.41 
Bourdieu is perhaps most famous for developing the concept of habi­
tus: the idea that, through upbringing and education, an individual ac­
quires a system of dispositions that serve as categories of perception and 
organizing principles of action. This, of course, again leaves the ques­
tion of how the individual acquires this "system of dispositions." 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
369 
Indeed, it is this basic problem of how dispositions or other traits are 
acquired that, as we have seen in the foregoing sections, has dogged an­
thropology and the social sciences from their inception. And it is pre­
cisely this lacuna that our developmental model fills. The glue that 
holds a society together is not some set of concepts or an abstract ideol­
ogy; rather, it consists of the basic types of interactions that are embed­
ded in the functional emotional developmental stages described earlier. 
This preverbal communication becomes a core part of the individual's 
personality and thence the basis for the "distinctive institutionalized 
culture" and the individual's "system of dispositions." 
A DEVELO P MENTAL MODEL FOR MENTAL 
HEALTH AND MENTAL DISORD ERS 
The developmental model of groups that we have been proposing also 
provides a useful lens for looking at mental health and mental illness. 
According to this model, mental health is indicated by the levels of fie 
development achieved by an individual vis-a.-vis his society, and mental 
illness as deficits in these core capacities. For example, an individual 
may have a deficit in his ability to connect gestures together into pat­
terns (Level 4) and then, later, to connect symbols or ideas together 
with logical bridges (Level 6). If one or both of these fie levels are not 
achieved, an individual in most cultures will almost invariably have dif­
ficulty functioning in that culture; for such an individual is unable to 
read or respond appropriately to preverbal emotional and social signals 
or to participate functionally in a range of group activities, from the 
very simple, such as eating, to the complex, such as rituals. 
There is an important difference between an individual who "hears 
voices" as part of a religious experience or in a culturally sanctioned role 
but is otherwise capable of logical thinking and of following the rules of 
the group, and an individual who has difficulty connecting ideas to­
gether. In other words, in assessing mental health and mental illness, our 
developmental approach looks at the individual's ability to relate to oth­
ers, to communicate presymbolically, and to think and speak logically. 
Near infinite variations occur within these abilities, and many differ­
ent perceptual patterns are possible that may appear to represent signifi­
cant deficits in these fundamentals but in fact do not. But the individual 
who cannot master these fundamental abilities will usually evidence 

370 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
aberrant behavior, which is identified by that culture as not only differ­
ent but in some respects as defective. An individual who does not suc­
cessfully negotiate these stages experiences a personal deficit and a deficit 
in his or her ability to function at the level that the group has achieved; 
indeed, the two aspects of development are inextricably connected. 
Thus, the individual who is incapable of connecting symbols together 
logically will be unable to participate in the most basic social patterns 
that the group organizes to define its cultural uniqueness. 
This model of mental health and illness also helps us understand how 
biology and experience come together. There is an equilibrium at each of 
our developmental stages between biology and experience that underpins 
the individual's ability to operate at that level, be it relating, perceiving 
patterns, or creating and using symbols. Each level is an intermediary or­
ganization (a series of steps) in the developmental pathways towards 
mental health or mental illness. What we have, therefore, is a dynamic 
developmental model with a series of levels that brings together biology 
and experience leading to specific behavior or abilities. 
This type of developmental bio-psycho-social model enables us to 
look at human behavior in terms of its relatively universal features and 
its infinite variations, and to see the way in which biology and experi­
ence are inextricably interconnected as the building blocks and pathway 
towards mental health and mental illness. 
CONSTANCY AS THE SOURCE OF VARIATION 
The developmental model that we have outlined in this chapter is based 
on three basic principles: 
• The universals that exist in human societies are not somehow "encoded" 
in our biology but are embedded in yet more basic developmental 
processes. 
The most basic constants of human society-universals such as the 
fact that the members of every human society are able to attend to one 
another, or to engage in preverbal communication-are universals not 
because they are part of our biological makeup but because they are 
learned abilities that predate the earliest hominid societies. That is, the 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
371 
caregiving practices that promote the development of these universals 
have been passed down and thus learned anew from one generation to 
the next, and even from one species to another, over the course of mil­
lions of years. Thus, as we have seen throughout this chapter, postulat­
ing the presence of certain individual or social universals does not 
compel one to adopt a biological framework to explain their existence. 
Even though basic social behaviors such as mating and caregiving are 
found everywhere, this does not mean that these behaviors are hard­
wired. Rather, it suggests that these behaviors, which, like all our behav­
iors, are culturally mediated, occurred very early in our evolutionary 
pathways. To be sure, behaviors such as pair bonding or caring for our 
infants are such a standard feature of human functioning that individu­
als who do not engage in them have commonly been seen as dysfunc­
tional. But the fact that these behaviors are ubiquitous does not entail 
that they must in some sense be "instincts" (regulated by our genes); 
rather, it indicates that these behaviors proved to be fundamental to the 
development of our higher reflective capacities, and for that reason were 
culturally transmitted over aeons. But then, the very fact that these fun­
damental behaviors are all learned entails that they can all be unlearned. 
• Every universal affords endless cultural variations. 
The nature of these caregiving practices is such that it provides the 
means for near infinite cultural variations. Different cultures engage in 
different kinds of preverbal patterns of regulation, engagement, and af­
fect gesturing. There is, for example, different signaling around different 
Customs, beliefs, and values. These attitudes of the group are experienced 
from earliest infancy and form the psyche of the individual. Throughout 
her life the individual conveys to others, through the same sorts of affec­
tive regulation, patterns of engagement, gestures and head nods and vo­
calizations that promoted her own development, her culture's distinctive 
attitudes towards different customs, beliefs, values. Thus, both the uni­
versals and the variations come from culture. The universals-the highly 
stable features of human functioning-derive from very early develop­
ments in the cultural transmission process and provide the foundations 
for cultural variations-that is, the abilities to engage in co-regulated 
emotional communication, to form symbols, and to think logically and 
creatively all reflect interactive learning mediated through culture over 

372 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
millions of years, but the contents of these processes vary from group to 
group. 
• The very nature of human beings and human functioning challenges us 
to use tools developed by both the natural sciences and humanities. 
As we saw in Parts I and II, the techniques used to study the develop­
mental processes that result in the universals of human functioning and 
human societies are grounded in the traditions of the natural sciences. 
But the techniques that are used to study the near-infinite variations in 
human functioning and human societies are grounded in the great 
hermeneutic traditions of the human sciences, including literature, phi­
losophy, and psychoanalysis, as well as in traditions developed by the 
natural sciences, including the experimental method. The descriptive 
tools of the humanities are essential because the variations in human 
functioning include subtle differences in behavior, thoughts, beliefs, 
feelings, and relationship patterns. 
/ ( 
--=--
According to these basic principles, we can think of universals as the 
lens through which one looks at a large group or society. Each stable or 
structural feature that we highlight opens a door to understanding the 
near infinite variations that occur in human societies. In this chapter we 
have explored a new set of relative universals and a new set of near­
infinite variations in terms of the developmental levels and needs of so­
cial groups. Each basic developmental need is at once a new universal 
and a new lens through which to see infinite variations. For example: 
1 .  The first basic developmental need that a group must negotiate is its se­
curity. Some groups are able to negotiate their security with organiza­
tions and practices that maintain order without impinging on the 
rights and freedoms of the individual, whereas other groups can main­
tain security only through practices that infringe significantly on per­
sonal freedoms. 
2. The next developmental need that groups must negotiate is cohesion 
and shared allegiance. Some groups are able to cohere around reflective 
institutions and processes that promote a strong sense of shared identity, 
The Developmental Levels of Groups, Societies, and Cultures 
373 
whereas other groups can cohere around superficial traits only, such as 
skin color or ethnicity. 
3. Next, groups must develop a shared sense of reality at the presymbolic 
level. Some groups are able to do this by embracing practices that enable 
them to develop, through frequent interactions with a wide range of 
others, an implicit understanding of a broad range of differences and 
themes. Other groups may fragment into small subgroups that disengage 
from each other and become more and more isolated and self-absorbed. 
4. After this, groups must develop a shared sense of reality at the symbolic 
level. Some groups establish institutions and practices that promote a 
shared understanding amongst its various subgroups of each others' 
symbols, but other groups fail to establish the sorts of institutions and 
practices that promote mutual understanding, and thus, have subgroups 
that tend to dismiss each others' symbols as irrational. 
5. Beyond this, some groups go on to develop reflective institutions and 
practices that support logical reality-based problem solving, maintain 
stability through change, and promote the development of highly reflec­
tive individuals, but other groups tend to relinquish their capacity for 
reflective thinking under the pressure of strong feelings, and are unable 
to maintain their institutions and practices at the same level of reflec­
tiveness during periods of acute stress. 
All human societies have progressed through some way of negotiating 
the first six levels of our model of development, and many societies have 
progressed quite far into the higher levels as well. These core develop­
mental processes go back millions of years. It is for that reason that they 
are found in every human culture-not because they are biological but 
because they predate human culture and were a critical part of the care­
giving practices that generated human culture. 
Once we understand the developmental processes that underpin the 
various universals and variations discovered by anthropologists and so­
cial scientists-processes that extend back millions of years, long before 
the emergence of human societies-we can transcend the conflict be­
tween cultural relativists and structuralists that has hitherto dominated 
these fields. With the specter of biological determinism removed from 
the scene, social theorists can build on the search for developmental 
processes that provide a frame of reference within which there can be 
endless variations in cultural and social patterns.

A New History of History 
IN PART I I  WE presented a view of human evolution as a dynamic de­
velopmental process in which early prehuman, and even before that, 
nonhuman species underwent the stages of functional/emotional devel­
opment outlined in Chapters 1 and 2 and communicated these ad­
vances to succeeding generations. This cumulative social process was the 
result of cultural practices that promoted increasingly elaborate emo­
tional gesturing, passed down from one generation to the next, rather 
than genetic mutations that were biologically encoded and transmitted . 
These practices were taught over and over again. Sometimes they were 
expanded and embellished, leading to further cognitive, communica­
tive, and social advances; sometimes they lapsed and were forgotten and 
the very survival of the species was put into jeopardy. 
To borrow a mathematical figure, the human evolutionary trajectory 
can be viewed as a square-wave, not a continuous function, in which re­
gressions as well as developmental leaps occurred.l Although random ge­
netic mutations were surely instrumental in many cases of extinction and 
adaptation-especially for lower organisms, where, for instance, a signifi­
cant climatic change proved too taxing for the capacities of one organism 
yet spurred another to develop in some new direction-biology alone is 
not sufficient to explain the survival of higher social organisms that require 
flexible problem solving abilities in order to adapt to changing environ­
ments. The driving mechanism of evolutionary change for complex social 
organisms, such as the great apes and hominids, was primarily cultural. 
The predominant tendency in evolutionary psychology has thus 
been to view the human trajectory as a series of discontinuous advances 
375 

376 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
in the cognitive abilities of each successive species, as if a skill were 
somehow randomly generated and then naturally selected because of its 
adaptive benefits.2 How else, according to this way of thinking, is one 
to explain why some new hominid species suddenly started to demon­
strate a technological advance, in, say, tool manufacture? But consider 
the numerous accounts by famous scientists of the sudden "moment of 
insight" they experienced. Once examined, these experiences from "out 
of the blue" are anything but; they come after years spent developing 
skills and thinking about a problem, not to mention the social milieu 
that nurtured those skills or the temperament that drove the scientist 
in question. Likewise, there were no doubt countless "moments of in­
sight" in human evolution; but that does not call for the out-of-the­
blue mutations embraced by genetic determinists. Rather, it demands 
that we look at the sorts of practices that made such technological ad­
vances possible. 
But what about actual human history, from the end of the last ice age 
to the present? How is one to explain the extraordinary march of tech­
nology, or the rise and fall of human civilizations, or the unparalleled 
advances in science, medicine, and the arts? How did we go so quickly 
from hunting mammoths with spears to talking about cloning a mam­
moth from the residues of DNA found preserved in the ice? On the 
standard evolutionary map, human history is really something of an ap­
pendage. All the biological changes that produced the cognitive, com­
municative, emotional, and social capacities of humans are considered 
complete by the end of the late Paleolithic period, and after that it was 
just a matter of human history unfolding, given this mental platform.3 
In our view, evolutionary processes have continued to operate over the 
past 12,000 years, and indeed, are continuing today. 
In what follows, we will see how our developmental model presents 
us with a framework for conceptualizing the dynamics of history. Our 
goal here is to present only a sampling, not a comprehensive application 
of our approach, to illustrate the kind of new interpretation of historical 
events afforded by the fie developmental model. Obviously, given the 
sheer enormity of the material involved here, we cannot hope to cover 
this topic in a comprehensive manner. Rather, to illustrate the point 
that throughout human history the mind was continuing to evolve, and 
indeed, that the human mind continues to evolve, we will focus on a 
few selected periods. 
A New History of History 
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE 
STRUCTURE OF S OCIETY AND 
THE CONTENT OF ITS BELIEF SYSTEMS 
377 
What gets passed down in history-in addition to formative cultural 
practices, which, for better or for worse, are the cornerstone of human 
existence-are all manner of economic and political structures, scien­
tific and folk theories, customs and beliefs, internal and external rela­
tionships, and so on. Many historians have investigated how these 
factors relate to a society's achievements andlor failures, but their views 
have been highly influenced by the determinist paradigm that has 
largely governed thinking about history as well as evolution. We at­
tempt here to break free from this grip of determinist thinking by look­
ing at the evolving fie levels of societies as a whole and how these relate 
to each society's fortunes and to its own view of history. 
The key to this approach to the study of history is to consider the rela­
tionship between the structure of a society and the content of its knowl­
edge and belief systems-that is, its views about human functioning and 
society itself To understand how this relationship applies to societies as a 
whole, first consider the CEO of a large multinational concern whose 
thinking has advanced to a very high level of fie development. He regu­
larly makes multicausal gray-area decisions in the day-to-day manage­
ment of the company; is able to balance risks against rewards and plan 
the company's future investments accordingly; and he frequently ex­
presses judgments in the realm of politics that reflect a strong internal 
standard. Thus, he is never reluctant to explain why he disagrees with the 
administration's policies and what he would do differently, and why his 
policies and not the administration's are more consistent with the long­
term needs of the country. In showing this ability to think off an internal 
standard and to make informed judgments about international affairs, he 
evidences high levels of reflective skills, including the ability to apply this 
level of reflective thinking to a broader cultural context and to think in 
probabilistic terms about the future. 
In the realm of human relations, however, he operates at a much 
lower level of fie development, for he finds it very difficult to under­
stand other people's emotions and virtually impossible to deal with 
other people's emotional problems. In fact, he believes that all individu­
als are motivated by fear and greed and that the best way to manage a 

378 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
large corporation is through reward and intimidation. As it happens, 
this narrow view of human functioning has proved highly adaptive for 
his ascent through the corporate ranks. For where others might worry 
about offending coworkers' sensibilities, he bulldozes his way through 
delicate negotiations and forces others to acquiesce to his will. 
These rather undeveloped views of human functioning are particu­
larly evident in his family life. For example, should his spouse be "too 
busy to attend to his needs," he immediately assumes that she is out to 
control him, rather than considering the possibility that she may be ex­
hausted from taking care of their three children who have been making 
demands on her all day. In other words, in his understanding of human 
behavior and emotions, he is not able to embrace multicausal and gray­
area thinking and often regresses below even reality-based thinking as he 
grabs onto unproven assumptions fueled by his fears and anxieties. 
As it happens, this individual enjoyed a very successful tenure at the 
helm of his company for several years while the economy was going 
through a period of robust growth. Year after year, the company reported 
a 20 percent rise in earnings, and ev<;:ryone involved, from the lowest of­
fice worker to the highest executive, was content to work in the com­
pany's inhospitable climate. All this began to change dramatically, 
however, as the economy reached the end of the business cycle. With a 
serious recession looming, it was clear that significant retrenchments 
would have to be made, but for this to happen the company needed 
someone who could negotiate effectively with the unions. "Ruling with 
an iron fist" no longer had the same effect it once did; now it seemed 
only to stir up internal dissension and threatened to provoke the workers 
into crippling actions. Faced with an escalating crisis, the board of direc­
tors had no choice but to lay off the CEO, while paying tribute, of 
course, to his inspired leadership through the golden years of growth. 
When we study history, it is equally illuminating to compare the de­
velopmental level of the institutions and decision-making processes of a 
society with its views about human functioning and the nature of society. 
What we see is that the more a society's institutions and decision-making 
processes reflect high levels of fie development, the more stable that soci­
ety, for they are better able to deal with regressive beliefs and behavior in 
encapsulated or narrow areas. Moreover, the greater the number of indi­
viduals in a society who, because of their high levels of fie development, 
can support these institutions, the better those societies can withstand 
internal and external stresses: economic crises brought about by war, en-

vironmental catastrophes, serious declines in the business cycle. But the 
converse is also true, as was seen time and again in the twentieth century 
when attempts were made to impose democratic structures on nations 
whose citizenry had not yet developed the capacity to support them. A 
society's ability to sustain its advanced institutions and decision-making 
processes is always at risk, should a significant proportion of the popula­
tion cease to develop these higher reflective capacities. 
Hence, the historical process is not unidirectional; rather, history is 
marked by countless periods of stasis and regression. In place of deter­
minist models of this dynamic, however, our developmental view of his­
tory illuminates how the structurelcontent relationship shapes a society's 
capacity to deal with the internal stresses that are inherent to social exis­
tence and the external stresses with which all human collectives must 
contend. The basic principle here is that the more advanced a society's 
views of human functioning and the nature of society, as reflected in its 
science, technology, philosophy, art, and literature, the more these views 
support the structures that a society creates to govern itself. Thus, as we 
trace levels of fie development in selected periods of history, we will look 
at the changing content in all these areas as it shapes views of human be­
havior and society, and their influence on the structure of governance 
and related economic and political institutions. Our basic thesis is that 
the breadth and stability of the structures that determine the stability of 
societies are proportional to the degree to which higher developmental 
levels characterize their knowledge and belief systems, especially concepts 
of human nature. 
As we look below at some of the more striking features of a few of the 
major periods in history, our emphasis is not just on the growth of 
knowledge but on a society's concepts and belief systems in regard to hu­
man functioning and group behavior. In our view, a society's fundamental 
assumptions about human behavior underpin its institutional structures; 
these assumptions can have frightening effects, as seen in totalitarian 
regimes, or inspiring results, as can happen in democratic societies. Ad­
vances in understanding human nature come to be reflected in institu­
tions that contribute to the structure of the society. For example, as we 
shall see below, advances in Enlightenment philosophers' view of human 
beings came to play a critical role in the governmental and decision­
making structures that were established during the Enlightenment and 
were grounded in Enlightenment views of free will and human auton­
omy. From the proliferation of nineteenth-century Learned Societies, 

380 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
which were supported by the government and called upon to advise in all 
manner of policy decisions, to today's reliance on scientists for decisions 
pertaining to health, criminal justice, the environment, and the econ­
omy, the concepts developed in biological and social sciences influ­
ence-for better or for worse-government institutions and policies. 
ACCO UNTING FOR H U MAN PROGRESS 
Although on an evolutionary scale the past 1 2,000 years amount to just 
the blink of an eye, in technological and cultural accomplishments they 
represent an enormous period in human development. How is one to 
account for this explosion of human knowledge and technology? From 
the perspective of our developmental approach, the answer lies in the 
fact that, at some point near the start of recorded human history, large 
numbers of humans began to master abstract reasoning, multicausal 
thinking, gray-area differential thinking, and thinking according to an 
internal standard (Levels 6 to 9, as outlined in Chapter 2). The reason 
this is so critical can be observed in the study of child development, 
where it is clear that these higher reflective capacities constitute a critical 
threshold in a human being's cognitive, social, and moral development. 
A similar process took place over the past 12,000 years. Once hu­
mans began to think logically about the problems of survival and the 
problems of social existence, and, contingent on this, became able to 
frame multiple hypotheses, to think in matters of degree and make rela­
tivistic comparisons, and to make judgments according to an internal 
sense of self and internalized standards of behavior, they started to make 
remarkable advances. Not only did abstract thinking in technology and 
science flourish but so did much more complex social organizations, 
and there were striking developments in representational art, writing, 
literature, philosophy, and so on. 
These advances, however, cannot be charted as some sort of Pangloss­
ian linear ascent, a steady progression in which successive generations be­
came more flexible and abstract thinkers. Rather, when we look at the 
various periods of human history, the picture that emerges is much more 
complex. For example, we see elements of very high levels of fie develop­
ment in some areas, such as science and technology, alongside much 
lower levels of fie thinking in regards, for example, to the persistence of 
superstitious and magical thinking. Or we see some small sector of a 
A New History of History 
381 
society-a governing class, for example-advancing in their fie capaci­
ties while the vast majority of the society operated at a much lower level 
of development. Or we see a few individuals reaching quite high levels in 
a particular area of abstract reasoning-mathematics, science, philoso­
phy-yet their social and emotional development remained constricted. 
Furthermore, as we noted above, human history is marked by a con­
stant see-sawing between cultural advances and regressions. This is man­
ifested in all sorts of ways: by the rise and fall of civilizations; or, within 
civilizations, the rise and fall of enlightened social institutions, such as 
the first stirrings of democracy and the rule of an impartial legal code 
followed by periods of tyranny and lawlessness (as in the decline and fall 
of Rome). There have been, in fact, not just one, but many "dark ages," 
so-called because of the virtual disappearance of written historical 
records, sometimes brought about by deliberate acts (the burning of 
the library at Alexandria, for example) and sometimes by a collapse into 
anarchy. 
Nevertheless, when we look at the grand sweep of human history, we 
see a gradual progression from lower to higher levels of fie development. 
Indeed, one might argue that, although they certainly did not think in 
these terms, this is the reason why so many great thinkers-Hegel, 
Marx, Spencer-were drawn to a teleological view of human history. 
For that matter, even though classical evolutionary theory was first and 
foremost supposed to be a nonteleological theory, it has often slipped 
back into this way of thinking.4 In its own way, genetic determinism of­
ten seems to be an attempt to account for this sense of teleological or 
purposive evolution.5 
There is really a dual problem in human history, therefore, which needs 
to be explored. On the one hand, there is the extraordinary technological 
and scientific ascent of humans over the past 12,000 years, yet nonhuman 
primates, such as the great apes, have remained at the same level of tech­
nological development for millions of years;6 but on the other hand, hu­
man history is characterized by constant regressions as well as advances. 
Some teleological theories (Hegel and Marx) attempted to account for the 
latter, but for the most part theorists have tended to focus almost exclu­
sively on the reasons for the advance and ignored the phenomenon of re­
gressions. But virtually all teleological theories have tried to explain the 
dynamics of human progress deterministically, either in terms of a theo­
logical mechanism (e.g., Hegel's Spirit that "determines history ab­
solutely"); a social mechanism (e.g., Marx's modes of production); a 

382 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
biological mechanism (e.g., the selection of certain genes, such as a "lan­
guage gene"); or a psychological mechanism (e.g., the development of 
certain modules, or a "mindreading" mechanism)'? 
Our developmental approach to human history instead attempts to 
explain the progressive nature of human history in nondeterministic, 
nonlinear terms. Any such theory must at the same time explain the rea­
sons for the remarkable technological and social ascent of humans over 
the past 12,000 years and the constant swings between advances and re­
gressions. Rather than postulating a deistic hypothesis that some special 
mechanism must have begun to operate, miraculously, at the dawn of 
human history and has been steadily ticking away ever since, a convinc­
ing explanation must view human evolution as an ongoing rather than a 
completed process, a process always vulnerable to regression, rather than 
a one-directional progression towards some predetermined utopia (such 
as Marx's socialist state). 
Over the broad expanse of history, individuals were developing their 
higher levels of thinking in an expanding range-for example, emo­
tional, social, and linguistic development as well as technology, science, 
literature, and the arts-though not always at the same pace. We see a 
similar phenomenon here to what Piaget attempted to capture with his 
notion of decalage; that is, some particular group may have been at a 
fairly low level of fie development in regards to their emotions or their 
shared sense of reality yet have reached a fairly high technological level, 
or vice versa. This is a point that the great anthropologists stressed at the 
dawn of the twentieth century (see Chapter 12). The engine underlying 
the development of these complex mental processes over the past 
1 2,000 years was the same as the engine underlying the development of 
the more fundamental processes (those that we saw in Chapters 3 to 5). 
This engine has been operating for a million years, and dates back to the 
Common Ancestor and beyond. 
The reason human history has the teleological appearance that it does, 
therefore, is because, over the course of human history, there has been 
A. a gradual development in the kinds of complex emotional exchanges 
that underpin the growth of the mind's higher reRective capacities; and 
B. a gradual broadening in the number of children who experience these 
nurturing exchanges, and thus, a growth in both the proportion of soci­
ety and the number of societies operating at higher stages of fie develop­
ment. 
A New History of History 
383 
In other words, the fundamental dynamic operating in human history 
is neither biological nor material: It is the cultural transmission of caregiv­
ing practices that support the development of higher reflective capacities 
in individuals and groups. Precisely because this is a cultural phenome­
non, it is not predetermined and is highly vulnerable to regression. 
Our basic hypothesis, therefore, is that societies flourish and advance 
when they support the sorts of caregiving practices that we have been ex­
amining for the vast majority of their children; and societies decline and 
regress when vast numbers of children are deprived of these co-regulated 
emotional interactions (or, of course, exposed to various kinds of en­
vironmental toxins or nutritional deficiencies that compromise their 
nervous systems). This hypothesis differs in a fundamental respect 
from-but complements-the classic view of human development 
championed by John Stuart Mill and Isaiah Berlin; for it holds that 
broad cultural advances are not simply the result of enshrining funda­
mental rights, nor of providing individuals with the means and opportu­
nity to develop their minds. The greater the number of the members of a 
society that are capable of engaging in reflective thinking, the more 
stable the institutions in that society will be. But the development of 
such thoughtful individuals is a result of early interactive experience: 
Rights and opportunities are not sufficient. Hence the liberal-democratic 
vision put forth by Mill and Berlin needs to be grounded in a develop­
mental perspective. 
THE MAGDELENIAN PERI OD 
The Magdelenian period dates to between 1 2,000 and 8,000 years ago. 
The area we are particularly interested in is Europe, where temperatures 
hovered around minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit in winter. In addition to 
the cold and fierce winds, there was little sunlight during the winter and 
game was scarce. Yet the peoples who lived there not only survived but 
actually thrived. Indeed, there is no evidence of widespread disease, 
which did not appear until humans started to live in large settlements. 
These were a seminomadic people who lived in small tribes. Appar­
ently they were trading with one another (as is indicated by the presence 
of salt, bitumen, and nonnative plants). Mostly they survived by hunting 
large animals, such as caribou and mammoths, and by fishing. They likely 
spent the year tracking game according to seasonal patterns. They lived in 

384 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
tents that were conical in shape, apparently to prevent snow from collect­
ing, and easily assembled. 
Every part of the animals that they hunted was used for a different pur­
pose. They wore furs to keep warm, using different kinds of skins for the 
different parts of clothing (which included mittens, anoraks, and fur 
boots). By curing the skins they were able to create pots in which they 
cooked soups that were probably a mixture of meat and any vegetables 
they could find. Animal skins were also used to make leather containers in 
which they collected drinking water. Animal fat provided them with fuel 
for light and and heat lamps. And bones were used to make weapons, 
sewing needles, and even flutes and whistles. 
Particularly interesting is how they treated their dead. Bodies were 
placed in graves, sometimes in groups of two or three. They were placed 
on their sides, the legs slightly bent. In a camp on the shores of Lake 
Ushki, Siberia, a burial pit has been discovered covered with red ochre. 
Paleoanthropologists have speculated that this may have been because 
they used the ochre to simulate blood, or to provide the corpse with a 
life-like aspect. In addition, tools and ornaments were placed in the 
grave in a manner that reflects gender and social status. In a grave from 
this period in Monte Verde, Chile, plants with special medicinal proper­
ties have been found. 
To judge from these cultural advances the stage of fie development 
reached by the people of the Magdalenian period obviously involves 
making speculative assumptions, given the limited archaeological infor­
mation available. The standard way to approach such a problem in 
anthropology is to look for a comparable culture for which we have sub­
stantial information. When looking for a model for the people of the 
Magdalenian period, the important factor to be considered is just how 
harsh the living conditions were. Survival would have been a constant 
challenge. They had to find ways to keep warm and healthy and to ob­
tain sufficient food and water. And they had to construct shelters and 
protective clothing from very limited resources. 
One of the best models we have for a culture that has survived under 
similar conditions is that of the Inuit, the seminomadic peoples of the 
Arctic. Indeed, the Inuit were commonly described as still having a pre­
historic culture. To be sure, one significant difference between the two 
cultures is that the Inuit were largely a maritime people (although there 
were also inland Inuit communities), whereas the people of the Magde­
lenian period were living in the glaciated regions of Europe. But the tra-
A New History of History 
385 
ditional Inuit way of life probably bears a striking resemblance to that of 
the Magdelenians. There have, of course, been great changes in Inuit 
culture over the past few decades as a result of the introduction of West­
ern technology and the rapid urbanization that has taken place. But we 
have detailed historical records by late nineteenth-century and early 
twentieth-century explorers and anthropologists that may provide us 
with a penetrating insight into the lifestyle of the Magdelenian peoples. 
The Inuit lived on the tundra, which consists of low, flat, treeless plains 
with permanently frozen ground (permafrost). The primary social unit in 
the traditional Inuit way of life was the extended family. For much of the 
autumn, winter, and spring these families would hunt on their own, but 
during the late spring and summer months they would join together in 
base camps that were positioned close to rich feeding grounds. Historical 
accounts provide us with a vivid insight of what it was like to face each 
day in frigid conditions with the task of finding enough food to survive 
that day. The primary source of food for the Inuit was fish, eaten frozen or 
raw (hence the name Eskimo, which in one of the Northern Indian lan­
guages means "eater of raw fish"). The most prized sources of food were 
caribou, seal, walrus, and whale. Seal was perhaps their most important 
source of food. The meat was eaten raw, frozen, boiled, dried, and fer­
mented. The fat was regarded as a delicacy and also used as a fuel. The 
skins were used to make boots and outer clothing, and also to make umi­
aks, kayaks, tents, water floats, and cooking pots. 
The manner in which the Inuit capitalized on seals for so many pur­
poses is an example of fairly sophisticated multicausal thinking. They 
were experimenting with different ways of eating the flesh appropriate 
for different circumstances and mastering the techniques required for 
these different methods of food preparation. They were also figuring 
out such things as the way in which fat could be used as a dip, a source 
of fuel and lighting, and even as a medicine. These developments reflect 
the sorts of abstract logical thinking that we see at Level 6 of our scales, 
as well as the communication skills necessary to impart these techniques 
to the next generation. 
For example, to figure out that seal fat could be used as a medicine 
would have involved identifying a relationship between certain forms of 
illness and the effects of consuming seal fat. The Inuit had to figure out 
that it was the fat and not the meat that was producing the desired re­
sults; they also had to know how much fat to ingest, and when, and by 
whom, and for how long. Interestingly, this traditional knowledge about 

386 
T H E  F I R S T  I D EA 
the medicinal benefits of seal fat has recently sparked off scientific studies 
worldwide. We now know that seal fat is extremely rich in selenium, 
which is an important antioxidant and is vital for a healthy immune sys­
tem and thyroid. We also know that selenium is an effective agent in 
warding off arteriosclerosis. Selenium deficiency has been associated with 
numerous disorders, such as a compromised immune system, Keshan 
disease (enlarged heart and poor heart function), and arthritis. 
Although they certainly didn't have this level of explicit, technical 
knowledge, the Inuit had figured out the basic principles involved here. 
Similarly, the Inuit were figuring out the advantages of seal skin over 
other sorts of skins for various purposes. For example, they figured out 
that seal skin is ideal for making boots and outer clothing because it is 
water repellant yet porous, which allows for body humidity ro escape, 
and it is lighter than caribou skin. They also figured out that the intes­
tines were ideal for making parkas. Thus, the Inuit saw the seal as a 
complex natural resource. Not only does this use of the seal involve 
multicausal thinking-for example, figuring out that one particular 
thing, such as seal fat, could serve many different functions-but it 
even broaches gray-area thinking: figuring out that such-and-such 
amount of seal fat was needed in such-and-such circumstances, or that 
seal skin was better than caribou for outerwear but not for innerwear. 
We see planning and problem solving in their hunting. For example, 
the techniques used in seal hunting depended on the season; the hunters 
figured out different techniques depending on the weather, which, of 
course, was a constantly changing variable. Seals were hardest to hunt in 
the summer when they could swim out to open sea. Fall hunting was the 
most important of all the seasons because enough seals would have to 
be killed to last humans and dogs throughout the winter. To survive in 
the ice-bound water, the seals would develop "breathing holes," which 
they would carefully keep open throughout the winter. The hunters 
would track these breathing holes and, when they discovered one, stand 
over it, completely motionless, their spears poised, for hours on end as 
they waited for the seal to show its head when it needed to breathe. This 
was a solitary and remarkably disciplined pastime. A young boy would 
learn how to hunt seal by being taught by his father; first, he learned how 
to forge his weapons; then, how to track seals, and figure out where a 
breathing hole was most likely to be found; and, literally, how to stand 
and hold one's spear, how to capture the seal, and then what to do with it. 
A New History of History 
387 
A more illustrative example of their complex planning and organiza­
tion capacities can be seen in their whale hunting. Whales were perhaps 
even more highly prized by the Inuit, for their fat as much as their meat, 
which not only provided them with an essential nutrient, but also a crit­
ical source of fuel for cooking, heating, and illuminating their igloos. 
Whale hunting was a collaborative activity, and much more perilous. 
The hunters would camp out in the spring on promontories close to 
whales' migration routes. When a whale surfaced, they would jump into 
their umiaks and kayaks and wildly pursue it. The lead hunter would 
harpoon the animal. Seal-skin bags inflated with air were attached to a 
hunter's harpoon, which would slow the whale down and eventually ex­
haust it, at which point the hunters would all join in for the kill and 
then pull the carcass onto thick ice where it could be cut up and the 
pieces hauled back to the base camp. 
Fairly advanced multicausal thinking was required to plan for and co­
ordinate such a complex activity. Moreover, to function effectively, the 
hunting party had to adopt a hierarchical structure in which different 
hunters were assigned different roles. Given the perilous nature of the 
situation, they had to know exactly what each other was doing and how 
they would respond to various emergencies and to each other's actions. 
You might compare this to the sorts of lifeboat or surf life-saving drills 
that are still practiced. In dangerous situations, it is absolutely vital that 
each person involved knows at every moment what everyone else is do­
ing, and that only one person is in command. 
The other great source of food and skins for the Inuit was caribou. 
Caribou would migrate in huge herds along familiar routes. Inuit 
hunters would pursue these herds and divide up into beaters and an­
other group of hunters who waited with spears and bows and arrows to 
attack the stampeding animals. When a herd was found, it would be fol­
lowed for days and the hunters would collect large numbers of skins and 
as much meat as they could transport; but they would never kill more 
than they could use or carry. Here, too, we see complex problem-solving 
skills. They had to figure out the animal's behavior, for example, its mi­
gratory and feeding patterns and how it would respond when attacked; 
fashion appropriate weapons; assign different roles to different hunters; 
envision the problems that might arise and fashion appropriate strate­
gies in advance; and be able to function effectively together in what, 
once again, could be a very perilous activity. 

388 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
We know, from the hooks from bones and the nets that have been 
found, that the people of the Magdelenian period fished; we also know 
that they hunted for caribou. From the weapons that have been found it 
seems likely that they were using a similar hunting technique as that 
used by the Inuit. They were also using caribou skins to make the same 
sorts of clothing as the Inuit. To be sure, the people of the Magdelenian 
did not hunt for seal, walrus, or whale; but the manner in which they 
hunted mammoths was likely very similar to the manner in which the 
Inuit hunted whales insofar as it, too, would have been a complex, col­
laborative, and dangerous activity involving many families working to­
gether. And the Magdelenians' use of the mammoth appears to have 
had many things in common with the way that the Inuit used seals and 
whales. That is, the mammoth was a source of meat and fuel for them 
and they used its skin for their tents and other purposes. 
Furthermore, like the Inuit, the people of the Magdalenian period were 
experimenting with the different kinds of skins available for different pur­
poses-to make water containers and cooking pots, for example-and 
figuring out which skins were best for innerwear, for outerwear, for boots 
and hats; and how to prepare these skins so that they were supple and 
could be formed into clothing, as well as the techniques required to cut 
the pieces for the various parts of clothing, and how to prepare the sinew 
from the animals they hunted into a gut that could be used for sewing. 
When we look at the Inuit, we see just how much learning has to go into 
each of these skills. Just as the Inuit took great pride in decorating their 
clothes, it would seem from the archaeological evidence that the peoples 
of the Magdalenian were also decorating their clothing. So for all the rea­
sons given above, it seems highly likely that the Magdelenians were mas­
tering multicausal thinking and were even beginning to master the 
gray-area differentiated thinking that is required in any complex coordi­
native venture. 
To imagine what life might have been like for the Magdelenians we 
might consider a typical winter day for the Inuit. The day would begin 
before dawn with the females fetching water and preparing the morning 
breakfast (typically, frozen fish). The males would be busy packing up 
and strapping their belongings to their sleds and checking the dog lines. 
Older children would be responsible for caring for the younger infants. 
After breakfast, they would break camp early, harnessing the dogs to the 
sled and then setting out shortly after daybreak. With so little sunlight, 
every available moment of daylight had to be spent in travel because it 
A New History of History 
389 
was far too treacherous to travel at night. There are all sorts of crevasses 
in the ice into which a team of dogs and sled could easily fall. Depend­
ing on the size of the family, there would be anywhere from a couple to 
several of these teams. They'd be careful to travel in sight of one another, 
for in a blizzard, which can happen quickly, it is incredibly easy to be­
come disoriented and lost. When game was spotted, the males would 
quickly organize themselves into two groups: one to beat the animals 
towards another group waiting with bows and arrows and harpoons. To 
remain soundless, they would communicate with each other by arm and 
head movements. 
The day would be spent searching for game. It would come to a close 
at dusk, when temporary shelters, the famous igloos, would be con­
structed. Early explorers and anthropologists all marveled at how 
quickly and efficiently the Inuit could construct an igloo. Everyone had 
an assigned job: One person would carve large blocks of ice from the 
ground; another would carry these to the chosen site; another would 
position the blocks for the igloo; another would pack all the cracks with 
snow; still another would flatten out the floor; another would prepare 
the "beds"-literally banks of ice blocks covered with thick caribou 
hides; meanwhile, others would be busy unloading the sleds, gathering 
and boiling water, preparing the evening meal. Finally, before anyone 
could eat, the dogs would all be carefully checked, fed, and then bedded 
down in the snow for the night. 
The igloo represents an ideal solution for a seminomadic hunting 
people that had to construct a temporary shelter from the materials at 
hand as quickly and efficiently as possible. The domed shape of the igloo 
with its low narrow entrance was ideally suited to the Arctic because it 
could withstand the most severe of winter storms. Numerous explorers 
and anthropologists have described listening to such a storm raging 
about them, safe and snug in their igloos, and then digging out from sev­
eral feet of snow the following morning. For more permanent structures, 
several igloos would be joined together so that the members of an ex­
tended family could enjoy a surprisingly spacious shared living space. 
The Magdelenians were probably equally adept in their construction 
of shelters. Using the materials that were readily available, they figured 
out a solution that could have been transported easily and erected 
quickly, and that was able to withstand the storms that would have 
been constantly raging. As in the igloo, temperatures inside the tent 
would likely have hovered around the freezing mark; but these tents, 

390 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
heated, like igloos, with animal fuel lamps, would likely have felt snug 
and secure. 
As we can see from the above, the Inuit would have had relatively few 
opportunities to exchange any sort of emotional signaling during the 
day: for one thing, young children were bundled up and strapped 
tightly to the sleds. The signaling that did occur between adults would 
primarily have related to coordinating travel and hunting. The opportu­
nities for sustained exchanges would have occurred primarily at night, 
and, because of the scarcity of fuel oil, they would also have been lim­
ited. And there is every reason to believe that the same would have been 
true for the Magdelenians. 
There have been few accounts of what sort of life the Inuit experi­
enced during these intimate moments. There are some fascinating ac­
counts (see Knud Rasmussen's famous The People of the Polar North, 
published in 1908, and Vilhjalmur Stefansson's My Life with the Eskimo, 
published in 1 9 1 3).8 But one of the most valuable sources that we have 
is Jane Briggs's Never in Anger.9 Briggs had gone to study the Inuit in 
very much the capacity of an ethnographer, living in her own tent and 
staying as detached from them as possible. But the exigencies of their 
way of life proved too great and, somewhat against her will, she was 
forced to move in with the family of the headman, who adopted her as 
his honorary daughter. Because of this, she was able to participate in 
as well as observe their way of life in startling and intimate detail. 
The picture that she presented went against many of the stereotypes 
that had long proliferated. The Inuit have long been famous for pre­
senting a stoical and nonexpressive face to the world. This led many an­
thropologists to speculate that they do not experience the "basic" 
emotions, or at least not to the same degree as others; and that, unlike 
most of humanity, they do not speak in "motherese" to their infants. 
Briggs also shared many of these stereotypes in the beginning. But once 
she became a bona fide member of the family, she found that all the 
members were extraordinarily affectionate with one another. In fact, 
one could say that their primary activity once inside their dwelling was 
to engage in long chains of warm conversation with one another. Much 
time was spent cooking and eating while they joked happily with one 
another and gossiped about the other families. 
One of the most surprising elements of Briggs's account is to read 
about the behavior ofInuttiag in the privacy of his igloo. The Inuit have a 
strong convention in regards to concealing their emotions when interact-
A New History of History 
391 
ing with those outside the family. Much to Briggs's surprise, however, the 
chief who had adopted her as his honorary daughter was a completely dif­
ferent person when alone at night with his family. Because she had been 
made a member of the family, he was totally relaxed in her presence. 
Lounging about in his long undetwear, he delighted in playing with his 
children, especially with his newest infant. He would play with the baby 
in a high sing-song voice, holding it gently, calling it various endearments, 
trying to make it laugh by tickling and caressing it and making funny 
faces and sounds, playing peek-a-boo, and in general taking great delight 
in the baby's antics. Indeed, it was clear that there was absolutely nothing 
the baby could do that would have provoked a strong rebuke. Although 
the same liberties were not extended to the older children, the chief was 
equally loving and gentle with them, and with his wife. 
This loving behavior with young infants is a reflection of the Inuits' 
belief that a child younger than three years lacks ihuma-reason-and 
hence is not responsible for any of his actions. Once a child had ac­
quired ihuma, even a child as young as four, he was now responsible for 
his actions and for contributing to the family welfare. This belief is par­
ticularly interesting because it signifies that the Inuit had a conception 
of childhood as a distinct stage in human development. To be sure, their 
view of when a child should assume the responsibilities of an adult is 
considerably earlier from ours today. But what is significant here is that 
their conception of ihuma demanded that infants receive the sorts of 
warm emotional experiences that Briggs observed in addition to the ne­
cessities of nourishment and protection. We can only speculate how far 
our model extends here and whether the people of the Magdelenian 
period had a similar conception of childhood-a conception, inciden­
tally, that was quite widespread amongst North American indigenous 
peoples. If so, it would certainly be a potent factor to our argument 
about the sorts of changes that were taking place in caregiving practices. 
The sorts of loving behavior that Briggs observed in the privacy of 
the igloo were a far cry from how the Inuits dealt with conflict. Ras­
mussen told a famous story in his account of the fifth Thule Expedition 
(from 1921 to 1924) of how he had visited a camp composed of fifteen 
families in which every adult male had been involved in some sort of 
killing. Rasmussen even produced a list detailing how 
• 
Havgugaluk killed his wife in a fit of jealousy and was killed by her rela­
tive Makharaluk; 

392 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
• 
Angulalik took part in a murderous assault on some neighbours, a 
vendetta being the reason; 
• 
Uaquaq and Erfaluk killed Qudaq in revenging their relative Qaitsaq, 
the father of Netsit, who had been killed by him; 
• 
Norrahanaq stole a wife from Annernaq (there was a fight, but nobody 
was killed); 
• 
Portoq also stole a wife, and he, too, later fought with the woman's hus­
band-again no one was killed; 
• 
Kivgaluk lost both his father and a brother through murder; he was all 
ready to take vengeance, but for the present was only restrained on ac­
count of the mounted police, who came on patrol every winter and took 
all killers for trial; 
• 
Ingoreq in jealousy tried to kill both Arshuk and Orshoraq, but failed; 
• 
Erfvana killed Kununasuaq and also took part in the murder of Qudaq; 
• 
Kingmerut shot Mangigshalialuk, and was also one of those who shot at 
Halggiuhialuk, who escaped death, however; 
• 
Qaitalukaoq in anger struck down Maggararaq with a knife; 
• 
Pangnaq, a boy of about twelve years, shot his father because he was 
cruel to his wife, the boy's mother; 
• 
Maneraitsiaq fought a duel with Mangigshalialuk with bow and arrow, 
but neither was killed; and 
• 
Tumaujoq stabbed Ailanaluk with a knife because he had killed the for­
mer's relative, Mahik. 1O 
Thus, along with the sorts of warm affective gesturing that we see 
within the dynamics of the family, there is evidence that the Inuit would 
regress to a much earlier stage of polarized, all-or-nothing thinking 
when it came to dealing with interpersonal conflict. One could argue 
that they were regressing to presymbolic modes of behavior in which 
perception leads directly to action, rather as a toddler regresses to cata­
strophic behaviors when frustrated or angry. 
If the Inuit model holds, it seems likely that, while the people of the 
Magdalenian period were mastering abstract reasoning and multicausal 
thinking, their reflective abilities in regards to interpersonal relations 
were probably at a much lower level of development. Skeletons have 
been found with massive head injuries that would appear to have been 
inflicted by humans. When we look at the types of cultural advances 
that the Magdelenians were making, the thing that stands out most is 
how the problems they were grappling with primarily related to their 
A New History of History 
393 
means of survival: food, shelter, clothing, medicine, cooking and cook­
ing tools, hunting tools and techniques. Although these beginnings of 
human history are marked by some striking technological advances, re­
flective thinking in the domain of relationships and empathy almost 
certainly lagged far behind. 
To be sure, pretty much the same pattern has played our in virtually 
every human culture ever since, and it continues to be a pressing con­
cern in our own culture. As we shall see in the remainder of this chapter, 
the pattern in human history has essentially been one of a broadening in 
our higher-level thinking capacities, from areas largely concerned with 
survival to areas involving science, technology, philosophy, and the arts. 
Emotional and social development has, universally, lagged behind these 
other areas, which suggests that the emotional and interpersonal sphere 
must be one of the hardest domains in which to develop mature reflec­
tive capacities. What we see in the Magdelenians, therefore, is not just 
the first signs of this familiar pattern in human history, bur, indeed, the 
foundation for this pattern in human history. 
EVIDENCE O F  DEVELO PING MINDS 
Several kinds of evidence lead us to conclude that, in regard to their 
means of survival, the Magdelenians were mastering abstract logical rea­
soning and multicausal thinking (Levels 6 and 7 on our scale) and start­
ing to master gray-area differentiated thinking (Level 8): 
1. Some o f  the advances that we see here, such as figuring our how to 
adapt to their hostile environment with more complex kinds of shelters 
and more protective types of clothing, reveal a flexible form of abstract 
reasoning. For example, they must have experimented with different 
kinds of structures before they hit upon the advantages of a conical 
shape. They likely experimented with different materials and techniques 
before they figured out how to fashion cooking pots and protective 
clothing out of animal skins. 
2. There are also signs of a methodical process of inductive reasoning. For ex­
ample, they appear to have been starting to experiment with medicines as 
a means of enhancing their health, for skeletons have been found of what 
appear to be shamans buried with their medicine kits. Putting together 
such a medicine kit involves a long inductive process of gathering different 

394 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
kinds of herbs and tubers and testing them to see what sorts of physical re­
actions they produced. This involves some systematic reasoning and indi­
cates that knowledge acquired over generations was likely carefully passed 
down from elders to younger persons in a long line of shamans. 
3. Evidence of collective problem solving can be seen in the hunting tech­
niques they needed for capturing large and highly dangerous animals. A 
hierarchical set of relationships is needed for such endeavors. In carrying 
out such a kill, different individuals would have been assigned different 
roles and responsibilities and would have enjoyed differing stature 
within the group. These roles would have involved matters of degree 
and thus suggest differentiated, gray-area thinking. 
4. Signs of early settlements at the end of this period suggest the develop­
ment of further fie development. As we will see in the following section, 
living in a stable society requires being able to think according to an in­
ternalized standard (Level 9). The harmonious existence of a settlement 
depends on the existence of shared social rules and conventions. 
Thus, the Magdelenians were laying the foundation for the emer­
gence of settlements during the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods not 
simply because they were making important technological advances 
but, more fundamentally, because they were mastering the sorts of com­
plex thinking and internal standards that are absolutely critical for the 
gradual formation of social rules and conventions that sustain a settled 
community. 
Such evidence supports a view of the dynamics of human history dif­
ferent from what one sees in standard teleological theories. In the stan­
dard view, humans started out with an established cognitive architecture 
and the rise of civilization was due to a "ratcheting effect" in which one 
generation after another capitalized on the technological accomplish­
ments of the previous (e.g., how to harvest and store seeds, how to pre­
pare the materials necessary to build permanent structures, and so 
on) . 1 1  There can be no denying the importance of this "ratcheting ef­
fect" in human history. But to treat this phenomenon purely in terms of 
the storage and transmission of knowledge overlooks the manner in 
which a new generation takes in its stride concepts or technologies that 
its parents may have struggled with. 
One need only consider how much smaller the world feels today for 
young children navigating the Internet. But the psychological mecha­
nism operating here is not simply one of early exposure to new ideas or 
A New History of History 
395 
technologies, for it is not the ideas themselves, but more fundamentally, 
the manner in which they are communicated that determines how this 
knowledge is absorbed. The caregiver who communicates an idea with 
little or even negative affect is likely to constrict their child's interest in 
or facility with that concept. Conversely, the caregiver who communi­
cates a concept with facial expressions and gestures that convey lively in­
terest and excitement is likely to see the same response in the child. 
Indeed, herein lies a critical dimension in the growth of science itself 
The build-up of scientific knowledge is not at all comparable to the man­
ner in which, say, a computer program builds up its "knowledge base" 
through multiple applications. Above al, science is a human endeavor and, 
as such, driven by human affects. To return to the example that we pre­
sented in the Introduction to Chapter 2, consider the reaction of Renais­
sance thinkers to Galileo's famous acceleration hypothesis. Galileo did not 
simply report an experiment showing that a falling body accelerates uni­
formly, which was so logically compelling that Renaissance thinkers had 
no choice but to add to their growing understanding of physics. Rather, 
Galileo presented this idea in Two New Sciences in the form of a dialogue in 
which the official Church position (Aristotelianism) is put forward by 
Simplicio (who, as his name implies, is profoundly simpleminded). 
What Galileo was really arguing in Two New Sciences is that authority 
is irrelevant as far as concerns our knowledge of the physical world; that 
scientific assertions stand or fall by experimental test. And it was pre­
cisely because of its emotional overtones that Galileo's experiment had 
such a profound influence on the development of Renaissance culture; 
for, as we saw in Chapter 2, the generation of Renaissance thinkers who 
communicated this new knowledge to their children conveyed, through 
their facial expressions and gestures, those very values that came to in­
spire the basic principle of humanism that every individual has the abil­
ity to use his innate rational powers to discover the truth. That is, the 
foundations for the development of the toddler's creativity, pattern 
recognition, and problem-solving abilities would have been laid, long 
before he could speak, through the sorts of back-and-forth interaction 
patterns that we outlined in the introduction to Chapter 2, where we 
envisaged how a caregiver might have responded to her infant's refusal 
to eat a certain food by raising her arms in puzzlement with a matching 
facial expression and vocal tones that invited her toddler to communi­
cate further his needs and wants while offering him various alternatives 
between which to choose. 

396 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
In other words, the emergence of the humanist Weltanschaaung that 
marks the Renaissance, which led to the rise of skepticism and cultural 
relativism (as seen most notably in the writings of Montaigne), and even 
more fundamentally, to a growing challenge to the Church's authority to 
pronounce on matters pertaining to both the natural and the social 
world, would literally have been bred into the developing minds of Re­
naissance children. Such an argument thus provides the critical element 
that has hitherto been missing in historical accounts of the rise of human­
ism: namely, an account of how these new attitudes were inculcated. It is 
not simply that the Faculty of Reason, when presented with new truths, 
will immediately recognize and embrace these as such; there are far too 
many counterexamples to adopt such a rationalist oversimplification. 
Nor can one assert that there was some sort of contagion effect, without 
explaining why and how such a phenomenon should have occurred. 
These two theories, that reason automatically embraces a truth when it 
sees one, or that paradigm shifts occur as a sort of contagion, may both 
be true; but regardless of whether we believe in either-or neither-of 
these models, we still have to understand the mechanisms by which such 
a new ability can be learned on a mass scale: what common denominator 
could enable people to understand and embrace even a contagious idea. 
We need to understand what would lead to the appearance of an almost 
automatic embracing of a new truth, when that truth is a highly complex 
one. To answer these questions we need to understand the developmental 
processes that enable individuals to comprehend new ideas and become 
capable of a new and more complex basis of thinking. 12 
THE RISE OF CIVILIZATION 
"Civilisation," Matthew Arnold remarked, "is the humanization of man 
in society." But the question we have been building up to in this chapter 
is how civilization itself was possible. How were the small farming and 
hunting communities of the late Magdelenian period able to create the 
complex social and political structures on which a civilization rests? 
We would argue that over the course of millions of years humans at­
tained a level of fl e development that enabled them to start living in set­
tlements, and then a relatively rapid broadening of these abilities took 
place over the next 8,000 years that provided the foundation for the rise 
of civilizations. Although further technological advancements-say, 
A New History of History 
397 
grain storage or irrigation and writing systems or some other form of 
record keeping-were essential to the rise of civilization, such progress 
is not a sufficient explanation. Nor can Mesopotamia, Sumeria, or 
Egypt be explained by some hardwired biological instinct in human 
beings to congregate, as ants or large herd-dwelling creatures do, and 
then develop the modes of production necessary to sustain their large 
communities. 
A "State" isn't simply a larger community than an agricultural village; 
a State represents a whole new level of communal existence. In Gregory 
Johnson and Henty Wright's classic definition, a State consists of a 
decision-making hierarchy with at least three levels, together with spe­
cialized administrators and some effective means of preserving records 
and other forms of information.13 To understand what is meant by a 
. "decision-making hierarchy," consider a simple agricultural village in 
which decisions about what crops to plant, how much of the harvest to 
store, who gets what share of the land, and even who marries whom, are 
made by a village headman. Such a structure represents a first-level 
decision-making hierarchy in which the headman directs the activities of 
all the other members of the group, at least in the areas that affect the 
community as a whole. A second level of decision-making hierarchy 
would exist if there were a small group of people, such as village elders, 
with whom the headman had to discuss the various issues confronting 
the life of the village and implement decisions. Suppose that, above the 
headman there was a tribal chieftain to whom all the village headmen 
had to report, binding all the villages together into a larger community; 
this would be a three-level decision-making hierarchy. And so on. 
According to Johnson and Wright, the first of the great civilizations, 
the Mesopotamian State, had at least three such levels of specialized ad­
ministrators. Furthermore, the State possessed the ability to process and 
store information relevant to overseeing the society's day-to-day opera­
tions. Numerous administrative records have been found. These docu­
ments, which were impressed on clay, consist of commodity seals, which 
were used to certify the contents of a container (such as a vessel, basket, 
bale, or storeroom), and message seals, which were used to store facts 
about goods and people. Writing as such did not arise until after the 
emergence of the Mesopotamian State; but these stamps and seals con­
veyed a great deal of information and are the direct precursors of later 
written scripts. Thus, for Johnson and Wright, a civilization is essentially a 
hierarchical society governed by some sort of administrative bureaucracy. 

398 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
We need to go further than this classic view of what constitutes a 
State, however, and ask what forces could enable a disparate group of 
communities to establish and maintain such a burgeoning bureaucracy. 
When we look at the rise of the Mesopotamian State in the fourth mil­
lennium B.C., the feature that most stands our in the slow rise of urban­
ism that occurred is stratification: The larger the society became, the 
more stratified it became, and the more specialized each individual's role 
within that society. Everyone, from the king and priests down to the 
farmers, the soldiers, and the slaves at the bottom, acquired a specific so­
cial identity, and correspondingly, a highly circumscribed responsibility 
within the community. All were integrated with one another in the sense 
that all depended on one another to maintain their communal life. 
What held them all together? It can't have been simply necessity or self­
interest, for this would not explain why some civilizations flourished and 
others failed to take hold, or why thriving civilizations would ever 
decline. 
Sustaining this form of complex organization requires that the mem­
bers of a community acquire a shared sense of reality: a common set of 
values and, indeed, a sense of identity as a member of that society, as 
well as a narrower sense of identity as a member of such-and-such a 
family or clan or community. Accordingly, a majority of individuals 
must be able to regulate their behavior according to the overall society's 
complex codes of behavior in addition to their family's or clan's or com­
munity's codes of behavior. 
The point that we are making here is, of course, reminiscent of 
Durkheim's famous notiop of the collective conscience of a society: a 
"collective mind" that exists over and above the individual members of 
the society. According to the social anthropologist Max Gluckman, the 
mind of the individual is molded from the moment of his birth by 
the ideas and behavior of his parents and peers. In this sense, the indi­
vidual is said to inherit a "mind," and that this inheritance must be un­
derstood "in a social, not a physical sense."14 As we saw in Chapter 13, 
because they did not understand the developmental processes involved, 
structuralist theorists attempted to construe this inheritance of a mind 
on a model that was very similar to that of a physically oriented geneti­
cist explaining the inheritance of physical traits. What was not under­
stood was the actual developmental pathways through which the culture 
and the social context within which children are born influence the de­
velopment of their minds. 
A New History of History 
399 
In Chapter 1 3, we looked at the developmental pathways through 
which a culture exerts its influence. In this way we saw how, long before 
the new mind acquires symbolic meaning, it acquires information from 
its culture and social context through the way in which presymbolic in­
teractions, mutual regulation, engagement, emotional signaling, and co­
regulated emotional exchanges associated with the social group are 
being negotiated. For example, the way in which such basics as close­
ness, dependency, aggression, sexuality, gender, dominance, and sub­
mission are negotiated is related to presymbolic interactions that are the 
features of learning in the first years of life, way before symbols them­
selves become a dominant factor. In other words, the near infinite num­
ber of emotional interactions that occur between babies and their 
caregivers create a structure for determining what is important, permis­
sible, meaningful, and realistic-that is, for what will later become sym­
bolically interpreted values of the collective mind and culture. 
To establish a hierarchical society, its members must understand their 
roles in a truly relative sense. For example, there are different degrees of 
power or leadership, or different degrees of closeness and intimacy, or 
different levels of skills and responsibilities. The ability for this sort of 
relativistic thinking, which we have described as differentiated gray-area 
thinking, comes after basic causal thinking and multicausal levels of 
thinking. 
For complex hierarchical societies to sustain themselves, a reasonable 
number of its members must have achieved this level of grey-area differ­
entiated thinking. Otherwise, they will be unable to sustain flexible 
problem-solving strategies and group decisions that reflect compromise 
and reconciliation. In addition, to sustain a complex hierarchical society 
requires that its members share a common sense of reality: that they ac­
quire a collective identity based on values rather than primitive beliefs. 
Achieving this level of social development requires that the individuals 
involved master the next level of development, namely, thinking off an 
internal standard and acquiring a more integrated sense of self. Here, 
too, there are different degrees. At a fairly concrete level, the shared 
sense of reality that binds together the members of a group may simply 
be based around common words and concepts. At a more abstract level, 
a shared sense of reality may be grounded in institutions and practices 
that support a shared system of values. 
As we will see below, there is considerable evidence that, beginning 
around the fourth millennium B.C., societies were becoming increasingly 

400 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
based on these higher levels of development. In fact, we will see that so­
cial groups at this time were beginning to expand the application of these 
higher levels of reflective thinking by exploring such themes as sexuality, 
or by defining work and family roles. We will trace these developments 
in a summary way in the paragraphs that follow. 
SUMERIAN CITY-STATES 
Once a broad section of a society has developed the fie abilities that are 
necessary to support a State, this provides the foundation for further 
dramatic technological advances to occur. This latter phenomenon can 
be seen in the rise of Sumerian civilization, which flourished between 
3000 and 2350 B.C. We have a fairly detailed picture of what life was 
like in these Sumerian city-states because shortly after 3000 B.C. they 
began to develop a written language. The earliest known documents are 
the clay tablets and seals from early occupations at Uruk (c. 3400 B.C.). 
These documents include signs for carpenters, donkeys, boats, copper, 
and the word en-the title of the lord unken-which may have been a 
people's assembly. In all they had more than fifteen hundred symbols. 
In 2900 B.C., the Sumerians introduced a phonetic system that 
served to represent distinct syllables and words of the spoken language. 
The pictographic elements slowly lost their iconic character and eventu­
ally Sumerian writing consisted primarily of these abstract symbols. But 
the Sumerians never developed an alphabetic system. The first truly al­
phabetic written languages appear to have developed around the middle 
of the second millennium B.C. among Semitic-speaking peoples in 
Palestine and northern Syria. Then, in the tenth or ninth centuries B.C., 
the ancient Greeks adopted and adapted the Syrian or Phoenician vari­
ant of these alphabets. 
Children can begin to master reading and writing as early as the sixth 
stage of fl e development, when they start building bridges between 
ideas. One might argue that the precursors of writing, such as pic­
tographs, originated at a comparable stage of development. But to cre­
ate an alphabetic system of writing, the members of the society have to 
be capable of regulating their own and each other's behavior in various 
ways: how a sound should be represented; how a word should be 
spelled; how a sentence should be constructed; how different kinds of 
speech acts, such as asking a question or issuing a command, should be 
A New History of History 
401 
represented; how pauses and other so-called paralinguistic aspects of 
speech should be represented; and how different narrative forms should 
be constructed. IS Furthermore, a society cannot develop an alphabetic 
system of writing unless there is some significant proportion of the pop­
ulace who, on the one hand, are freed from the burden of meeting the 
daily needs for survival, and, on the other, from the burdens of govern­
ing. Thus, it is not surprising that writing should have originated in the 
sort of stratified society that we see in Sumerian civilization. 
At the pinnacle of Sumerian society was a king who was assumed to 
be a descendent of the gods and who remained in contact with them. 
Beneath him was a group of nobles. There was also a class of wealthy 
businessmen who lived in the larger, better houses of the city. Beneath 
them, in terms of wealth and prestige, were the many artisans and farm­
ers, including smiths, leather workers, fishermen, bricklayers, weavers, 
and potters. Scribes apparently held fairly important positions in the so­
ciety because literacy was an admired accomplishment. At the bottom 
of society were the slaves, often war captives or dispossessed farmers. 
Cities appear to have been divided into modern-like "wards," but we 
do not know on what organizing principles they were based. There is 
some evidence that people were still organized in clans and that kinship 
ties were instrumental in the formation of various social groups; for ex­
ample, the members of military units appear to have been based around 
kinship ties and perhaps place of origin. Many Sumerian states probably 
had a public assembly in which the upper and middle classes of the soci­
ety formulated policy and made decisions through consensus and even a 
form of simple democracy. Such political advances are an indicator that 
the Sumerians had developed refined reflective capacities and an ex­
panded sense of self, for to reach consensus through public decision­
making forums, individuals not only must be able to recognize that 
there are different degrees of satisfying their interests but also have to be 
capable of reconciling their personal wishes with the larger needs of a 
community that now includes members unrelated by blood or possibly 
even customs. 
The Sumerian extended family appears to have been a strong and 
durable unit that was protected by laws governing such matters as 
rights of inheritance and recompense caused by injuries. This involve­
ment of the State in the welfare of the family is yet a further indication 
of a widening sense of identity and internalized standard; for now indi­
viduals were starting to think of their families' rights, and what sorts of 

402 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
public actions were available to them to avenge transgressions. Simi­
larly, even though it was a patriarchal society in which women were 
viewed as inferior members (as is evidenced, for example, by their di­
vorce laws, which stated: "If a wife rejects her husband and says, 'You 
are not my husband,' they shall cast her into the river. If a husband says 
to his wife, 'You are not my wife,' he shall pay half a mina of silver"), 
nevertheless some laws were instituted to ensure that women were rea­
sonably well treated. The basis for the introduction of such laws would 
have been the emergence, amongst a large section of the populace, of a 
growing concern that potentially vulnerable members of the society 
should be protected, if necessary, by the State. 
Some aspects of the Sumerian way of life are still recognizable today. 
For example, there are records of children being shepherded to school 
against their will. Yet the Sumerians' view of reality is grounded in a 
magical way of thinking that is difficult for us to grasp fully today. In 
Sumerian mythology, the earth was viewed as a flat disk under a vaulted 
heaven. They believed that various gods controlled human destiny ac­
cording to well laid out plans, and that the world would continue with­
out end and with very little change. Mirroring society, the deities were 
hierarchically arranged in power and authority and were given to power 
struggles and many vices. Each god was in charge of something, such as 
the movements of the planets, or irrigation and brick making, and each 
one was immortal and inflexible. Almost every official Sumerian pro­
nouncement and inscription invoked the favor of the gods who oversaw 
the city's fortunes. 
When we look at the rise of Sumerian civilization from our develop­
mental perspective, therefore, the feature that stands out is how radi­
cally divorced their technological advances were from their views of 
reality and human functioning. Judging, for example, from how diffi­
cult it is for children to learn how to write despite the sophisticated 
methods we now employ, one can appreciate just how advanced their 
abstract reflective skills had to be in order to create an alphabetic system 
of writing. What was involved here was a whole new way of looking at 
and analyzing speech: breaking it down into a small number of pho­
netic units that could be represented in a simple combinatorial system. 
But for the Sumerians, writing was far more than just a technological 
advance; indeed, they saw writing as a symbol of their civilization, 
which as such was bound up with mystical power. Thus, King Shulgi 
proclaims, in the poem that was recently discovered (c. 2 1 00 B.C.): 
A New History of History 
403 
"Now, I swear by the sun god Utu on this very day-and my younger 
brothers shall be witness of it in foreign lands where the sons of Sumer 
are not known, where people do not have the use of paved roads, where 
they have no access to the written word-that I, the firstborn son, am a 
fashioner of words, a composer of songs, a composer of words, and that 
they will recite my songs as heavenly writings, and that they will bow 
down before my words." 
Despite their sophisticated technological advances, the Sumerians 
continued to believe in personalized gods who had a very direct involve­
ment in human affairs, causing triumphs because of some personal in­
vestment in the actors involved or crises because of their own petty 
feuds. Thus, the Sumerians continued to subscribe to a version of 
henotheism, according to which there were a large number of gods, each 
of whom was personally connected to a clan or a locality. Because the 
ways of the gods were so unpredictable, one could seek to appease their 
anger or gain personal reward only by one's loyalty. But as primitive as 
the content of these beliefs may have been, the rise of Sumerian orga­
nized religion reflects advances in fie development. On the one hand, we 
see a primitive belief system that in many respects was precausal; but on 
the other hand, the organizational structure for disseminating and sus­
taining those beliefs was remarkably sophisticated, demonstrating ad­
vanced levels of gray-area thinking and internalized standards. The 
sophisticated religious organization that they developed-the shrines 
and temples, the priestly hierarchy, the rituals and festivals-thus cre­
ated a rational vehicle that seemingly legitimated regressions into primi­
tive precausal ways of thinking. 
ANCIENT GREECE 
History as such really begins with the Ancient Greeks. We say this not 
for an anthropological reason but because of an argument made famous 
by Bishop Berkeley in his dictum esse est percipi. That is, for history to ex­
ist, a society must have a conception of history: of a past and a future and 
its place in the historical present. Herein lies one of the more interesting 
phenomena that separates humans from animals: We are the only species 
that has a history simply because we are the only species that has a con­
ception of history. That is not to suggest, however, that to be human is to 
possess a concept of history; not all human societies have possessed a 

404 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
concept of history, and not all societies possess the same concept of his­
tory. Indeed, the concept of history, and thus, history itself, has evolved 
over the past 2,000 years and provides us with one of our most potent 
indicators of the evolution of our reflective abilities. 
Before the Ancient Greeks, ancient civilizations, particularly the 
Sumerian and Egyptian, were keeping records of past events. But these 
ancient civilizations subscribed to cosmologies that were thoroughly 
grounded in magical thinking. Human existence was thought to have 
begun with an act of the gods, and, where it was believed that human 
existence would one day end, this would be Gotterdammerung-like, as 
the result of a cataclysmic conflict amongst the gods themselves. The 
lines between reality and subjectivity were blurred, and human existence 
was likened to a dream. As an inscription on an Egyptian tomb put it: 
Our people rest in [the land of eternity] since the earliest primordial 
tIme, 
and those who will be in infinite years, 
they all come to that place . . . .  
The time that one spends on earth is only a dream. But welcome safe 
and sound! 
One says to him who has reached the West. 16 
This picture of existence as infinite is not so much an expression of the 
view that time will never end-which is actually a somewhat abstract 
thought-as an indication that the beginning and end of time could not 
be conceptualized. According to these cosmologies, human existence is 
controlled by the gods at every point and in every respect. There is no 
making sense of human existence; the gods behave in arbitrary ways. All 
one can do is accept whatever happens and do one's best to appease the 
gods, which, in many early civilizations, included human sacrifice. Thus, 
as we saw in the preceding section, although these cultures were advanc­
ing well into the areas of gray-area thinking and beginning to form inter­
nalized standards in such areas as social organization and technology, 
their thinking in regards to reality remained at a fairly primitive, pre­
causal level of development that stressed resignation and acquiescence to 
the supernatural forces thought to govern life. 
The magical belief systems that we see in these early mythologies 
were transformed, in Ancient Greek culture, into a fatalistic view of his­
tory. Herodotus is commonly heralded as the father of history, even 
A New History of History 
405 
though he was preceded by a slightly older contemporary, Hecataeus, 
whose works seem to have had a historical element.17 Herodotus, and 
following in his footsteps, Thucydides, set out not just to record factual 
events but to make sense of these events, even if much of this material 
was gathered from hearsay and the memories of soldiers and travelers. 
But the view of history that they introduced continues to display many 
of the features of the magical thinking of these earlier mythologies, as is 
epitomized, for example, in the Iliad, the Odyssey, and of course, the 
myth of Oedipus. 
According to the myth of Oedipus, when Laius was the guest of King 
Pelops he was so captivated by Pelops's son Chrysoppos that he kid­
napped the young boy. Outraged, Pelops uttered a curse that Laius, who ' 
was childless, would one day have a son and then be killed by his son's 
own hand. Zeus heard Pelops's curse and decided to grant it. Here, it 
should be noted, is the reason curses were taken so seriously: In uttering 
a curse, one was invoking the gods to take a punitive action on one's be­
half. The danger posed by a curse lay not so much in the words them­
selves but in the possibility that the gods would listen and be moved to 
action by those words. 
Because of the magical power invested in curses, it came to pass that 
Laius did indeed have a son, but, to avert his fate, he had this newborn 
child crucified to a tree, nails driven through his feet, and left him there 
to be eaten by wild animals. But a shepherd came across the infant and 
delivered him to his own king, Polybus, who himself was childless. 
Hearing a rumor when he was a young adult that he was adopted, Oedi­
pus visited the Oracle at Delphi to discover his true roots. The oracle 
told him that he would kill his father, marry his mother, and sire a 
damned generation. Still believing that Polybus was his father, and 
wishing to avoid such a horrible fate, Oedipus fled Corinth and set out 
for Thebes. When he came to a crossroads, he was imperiously ordered 
by an old man to get out of the way. Infuriated, Oedipus got into a fight 
and ended up killing his true father, Laius. 
In King Oedipus, Sophocles raises an intriguing question as to whether 
the source of Oedipus's fate lay in his character; for Oedipus regresses to 
catastrophic behavior, becoming far too angry far too quickly. Not only 
does he completely distort the significance of the incident, but in the 
process he commits the cardinal sin of assaulting and mortally wounding 
an elder. Thus we are left to ponder the sources of one's destiny in life: 
Does it lie in the machinations of the gods or in one's temperament? 

406 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Such a question marks a significant advance over the magical thinking of 
earlier, more primitive cultures. And yet, the Ancient Greeks still viewed 
one's character as a matter beyond one's control. 
Sophocles never questions the fatalistic view of history. One might 
think that this is precisely what Sophocles wanted to challenge, insofar 
as the incident between Oedipus and Laius takes place at a crossroads; 
but the appearance of a crossroads is actually ironic, which perfectly en­
capsulates the Greeks' view of history. For Oedipus believes that he is 
controlling his own destiny, that he is traveling the road he has chosen 
of his own free will. But, of course, the audience knows that he is on the 
road he was predestined to choose and that it was carrying him un­
knowingly towards his predetermined union with his mother, Jocaste. 
That is not to say that the Ancient Greeks believed fate decreed every­
thing that happened to one; they believed only that how we behave at 
critical moments in our lives, such as Oedipus when he was at the cross­
roads of his life, is predetermined by some agency that we can neither 
control nor understand. 
The plot of Sophocles' King Oedipus is grounded in the Greeks' fatal­
istic view of human existence. And yet the play itself is quite complex, 
not just dramatically, but also in the institutional structure in which it 
appeared; the plays were performed during a religious festival in which 
the audience voted at the end for what they regarded as the best play. 
(Sophocles is said to have won eighteen times.) This element of compe­
tition is itself quite advanced insofar as it requires the members of the 
audience to make an aesthetic judgment. Viewing a play was regarded as 
a religious act rather than an entertainment (comparable, in some ways, 
to the medieval mystery plays). As such, the Greek plays represent a 
considerable advance over earlier primitive acts of obeisance to the gods. 
Yet the content of this practice still resonates with earlier views about 
the direct role that the gods play in human affairs, which is what de­
mands such public acts of obeisance. 
Perhaps the most important example of the fie advances taking place 
in the structure of Greek thinking concerns their views about the nature 
of psuche, or soul, which occurred in the fifth century B.C. Our under­
standing of the early Greek view of the mind is confined to what we can 
glean from the Iliad and the Odyssey, bearing in mind that one always 
has to allow for poetic license. Thus, for example, one might wonder 
whether the Ancient Greeks shared Homer's view of Dreaming as a god 
who stands next to the head of someone sleeping and instills a dream. 
A New History of History 
407 
But, as Bruno Snell showed in his classic The Discovery of the Mind, the 
very language that Homer uses reveals important insights into how 
the ancient Greeks viewed the mind. IS 
One of the most striking aspects of their mental vocabulary is that 
their use of perceptual and cognitive terms was fundamentally bound 
up with affective overtones. For example, as Snell showed, there is no 
abstract verb corresponding to our use of "to see," that is, solely refer­
ring to the act of perceiving. Rather, Homer's characters have "a particu­
lar look in their eyes," or "look with a specific expression," or have "a 
stare that commands attention"; they might "glare intently" or "gaze 
forlornly"; look with "pride," "joy," "fear," or "apprehension." In other 
words, every perceptual act is fundamentally bound up with an affect. 
Similarly, Homer's terms for the emotional and cogitative aspects of the 
mind (thymos and noos) overlap to such an extent that one cannot draw 
the sort of fundamental distinction between the emotions and reason 
that was to become one of the defining features of the great "rationalist" 
revolution that occurred in Greece in the fifth century B.C. 
It is not until the rationalist revolution, with its belief in a universal, 
uniform human mind compartmentalized into separate organs or facul­
ties, that we encounter the use of perceptual verbs with our familiar 
sense of "seeing" as a putely visual act: an indication that the great 
changes taking place in the philosophy of mind, as found in Anaxogo­
ras, Socrates, and Plato, were preceded by an important linguistic shift. 
Indeed, one might even argue that it were precisely because language 
speakers were starting to distinguish between body (soma) and soul 
(psuche) that the nature of psuche and its relationship to the body had 
become such a pressing philosophical issue. 
From a fie perspective, this shift from the Homeric to the rationalist 
language of the mind reflects an important advance. We saw in Chapter 1 
how, in impulsive humans, perception is closely tied to action: A percep­
tion triggers an action. This is very much the picture of action that we see 
in Homer. For example, the Iliad begins with the great quarrel between 
Agamemnon and Achilles that precipitates the ensuing drama. Agamem­
non is behaving in an unbelievably churlish manner (which itself is dic­
tated by the gods), and one fully expects Achilles, who immediately draws 
his sword, to strike Agamemnon down; and yet Achilles refrains from do­
ing so and places his sword back in its scabbard. He does so, however, not 
because of any fleeting concern about a possible civil war erupting be­
tween their two camps but because Athena suddenly appears to him (and 

408 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
him alone) in a vision, counseling him to curb his wrath. So right from 
the beginning we are presented with a picture in which perception would 
indeed immediately lead to (in this epic poem, calamitous) action were it 
not for the intercession of an external, higher force. Throughout the Iliad 
we see this pattern repeated: Perceptions trigger actions, and when charac­
ters do think reflectively, their "intentions," "motives," and "beliefs" are 
placed in them by external forces. With the rationalists, however, the 
psuche takes over the role of making rational choices and decisions (as in 
Plato's "Myth of Er" in Book X of The Republic). 
The shift that we see in the rationalist picture of the mind, therefore, 
with its bifurcation between reason and the emotions, is a reflection of 
what we described in Chapter 1 as the fie advance in which the child or 
impulsive adult is able to separate perceptions and actions. This separa­
tion between perception and action is reflected not simply in philosoph­
ical discourse on the tasks of the rational part of the psuche but on a 
much more subtle level in the introduction of mental terms that them­
selves separate perceptions, thoughts, and beliefs from affective actions. 
As we will see, this rationalist development was to undergo several im­
portant advances in Western thought, perhaps most notably in the great 
Cartesian revolurion that took place in the seventeenth century and that 
laid the foundation for our modern science of the mind (see below). 
Completing these advances in the rationalist view of psuche is the cre­
ation of the polis: the city-state that was based on the idea that people 
should live in a community of individuals who were all conscious of 
their shared interests and common goals and who would manage collec­
tive concerns by debating possible action in a public setting. However, 
we can see a significant disparity between the Greeks' view of human 
functioning and the democratic institutions that they were creating. As 
we saw earlier, during times of acute national stress such as occur, for ex­
ample, during times of war or natural disaster (famine, earthquakes), 
such disparities can undermine the stability of a society. Should internal 
stresses become too pronounced-should the thinking of large elements 
of the populace become too polarized-the society will no longer be 
able to sustain its more advanced institutions and processes. 
To be sure, there are areas in which the content of ancient Greek 
thinking was advancing into the realms of future-based probabilistic ' 
thinking (our eleventh stage) and reflective thinking according to a 
stable, broad inner framework (the twelfth stage). For example, in Mile­
tus in the sixth century B.C., thinkers such as Thales and Anaximander 
I 
A New History of History 
409 
began to develop the first concept of science: the first attempt to explain 
natural phenomena empirically. These early scientific advances were 
later followed by remarkable advances in abstract thought, for example, 
in the development of metaphysics, logic, mathematics, and geometry, 
as well, of course, as the elaborate forms of ethical, aesthetic, and politi­
cal theories found in Plato, the Phytagoreans, and Aristotle. 
Yet, as sophisticated as was the Greek canon of philosophical argu­
mentation, the great philosophers nonetheless believed that emotions 
are an irrational force. Indeed, Oedipus's belief in his own free will is 
represented by Sophocles as an act of hubris. Thus, as far as the Ancient 
Greeks were concerned, the causes of human events were irrational, or 
transcendental and ineffable: The things that humans do or that happen 
to humans are caused by forces over which we have no control. Thus an 
interesting question arises in regard to Greek history: Did the disparity 
between the evolved institutional structures and the primitive content 
of the society's beliefs about human functioning erode the former and 
render Greek institutions more and more vulnerable to the regressive 
content of those beliefs? Such a dynamic might help explain why an­
cient Athens, at the height of its institutional glory, regressed into the 
great Peloponessian wars with Sparta (from 43 1 to 42 1 B.C. and from 
414 to 404 B.C.) that ultimately culminated in the fall of Athens. 
THE AGE O F  REASON 
The seventeenth century is referred to as "The Age of Reason" because 
of the sweeping social, political, religious, scientific, and technological 
changes that took place, all in the name of rational principles. Towering 
over the many remarkable individuals of this period was Descartes. In 
the area of religion, Descartes helped bring about the advent of Deism, 
discussed later in the chapter. In science he introduced the method of 
doubt. He played a major role in developing the life sciences, particu­
larly optics, the biological study of the conservation of heat, and the 
anatomical study of reflexes. In mathematics he created analytic geome­
try. His views about the nature of the mind and its relationship to the 
body ultimately gave rise to the science of psychology. He also estab­
lished epistemology rather than logic as the foundation of philosophy. 
That one person could have had this broad an impact on his age is 
truly extraordinary, but it is also a source of some puzzlement. It is rare 

4 1 0  
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
for a thinker to have this profound an influence in so many different ar­
eas; one would perhaps have to go back to Aristotle to find a compara­
ble example. It was hardly because of his personality, for Descartes was 
something of a hermit who was quick to take offence and slow to forget 
a grudge. Nor is it because of the power of his arguments, for the truth 
is that they are often full of inconsistencies and omissions. Nor is it be­
cause his ideas were so novel; on the contrary, apart from his work in 
mathematics, many of the key ideas that he explored were being dis­
cussed by his contemporaries. So we are left with the fundamental ques­
tion: What exactly was it about Descartes's ideas that accounts for his 
remarkable impact? 
There have been countless attempts to answer this question, in disci­
plines ranging from philosophy and the history of ideas to theology and 
the sociology of knowledge. 19 To these we can add some insights pro­
vided by our developmental approach. What Descartes represented to 
his contemporaries, and the eighteenth-century school of Enlighten­
ment philosophers that followed him, was, as many have noted, the 
conflict between reason and authority. But Descartes went beyond sim­
ply championing the power of reason; after all, the great Scholastic and 
Renaissance thinkers had every bit as much claim to such a title. Rather, 
Descartes established reason as a revolutionary force, as is reflected in 
Thomas Paine's revolutionary text of 1793 in which he introduced the 
title The Age of Reason. But then, Descartes was not the political revolu­
tionary Paine was; on the contrary, his actions would suggest quite the 
opposite.20 But Descartes did amount to a revolutionary of the intellect, 
championing a significant advance in the higher reflective capacities 
that we have been surveying in this chapter. 
Descartes did not simply articulate the new ideas that were emerging 
in the seventeenth century in the diverse scientific fields in which he 
was active. Above all, Descartes represented the power of applying these 
new ideas to thinking about the human mind. That is, unlike earlier 
thinkers, Descartes did not simply look for patterns in mathematics, 
physics, biology, or anatomy; Descartes looked for patterns in the way 
we look for such patterns. In other words, he took the leap into meta­
cognition. What Descartes really represented for his contemporaries 
was, in effect, the sort of intellectual excitement that an adolescent feels 
as he develops his own internal standards and new reflective abilities in 
an expanded sphere (the tenth stage). Descartes broadened the higher 
A New History of History 
41 1 
reflective capacities that the thinkers of his age were mastering in a way 
that, for the first time, encompassed thinking about thinking. 
In this respect, Descartes's Discourse on Method is the paradigm of a 
modern revolutionary text. Not just the content, but the very style in 
which it is written marks a radical break from the past. Descartes tells of 
how "returning to the army from the coronation of the Emperor, the 
onset of winter detained me in quarters where, finding no conversation 
to divert me and fortunately having no cares or passions to trouble me, I 
stayed all day shut up alone in a stove-heated toom, where I was com­
pletely free to converse with myself about my own thoughts."21 We have 
grown so accustomed to the voice in which this is written that it re­
quires a conscious effort to appreciate the full significance of this "frag­
ment of autobiography" : that is, it is a fragment of autobiographyf22 
In what follows, Descartes makes it clear that he is deliberately chal­
lenging the central doctrine of Christian cosmology, the orthodox doc­
trine of the Great Chain of Being. He insists that there is an unbridgeable 
gap between animals and humans. The human body, according to 
Descartes, is a machine (which was itself a heretical view); but, unlike an­
imals, humans also possesses the capacities to reason, speak a language, 
control their actions, and be conscious of their cognitions and sensations. 
The reason we are said to know that animals don't have minds is because 
they lack the ability to describe their thoughts. For us to say that an ani­
mal is capable of speaking, the animal would have to respond appropri­
ately in varying situations, acquire words spontaneously, and combine 
words creatively. Only humans, according to Descartes, are born with 
such a capacity. 
That such an argument is so prescient of the skeptical attacks on ani­
mal cognition and ape language research that were to flourish in the late 
twentieth century is an indication of the subtlety of Descartes's thinking 
about language and cognition, and how these ideas might apply to 
lower organisms.23 His polarization in his thinking about animal capac­
ities is a reflection of the regressive elements in the content of his think­
ing. But in structural terms, even raising such an issue is an indication 
of the broadening that was taking place in his thinking. 
Descartes's universe, unlike that of the Ancients or the Scholastics, is 
bifurcated. And at its center stands neither the earth nor the sun, but 
the human being, who makes sense of reality by creating concepts. 
When Aristotle tells us that "man is by nature a political animal," or 

4 1 2  
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Seneca that "man is a reasoning animal," the emphasis is on "animal": 
one analyzes the human being as an "animal species."24 Bur all this is 
changed in the Discourse. Here we begin with Rene Descartes: the 
thoughts of a solitary individual who has come to distrust the teachings 
of the finest minds of his time; who has renounced the homage to Aris­
totelian thought that dominated medieval and Renaissance thought; 
who tells us that he decided to continue his studies by reading from the 
"great book of the world" rather than from the classics; and whose "real 
education" has taught him to accept as certain only those ideas that he 
can see for himself "clearly and distinctly." Spoken like a true adoles­
cent, brimming with confidence in his newfound sense of self. 
Indeed, like an adolescent overcome by a sense of the importance of 
his discovery, Descartes set our to convince his peers that they, too, 
needed to reform their intellectual habits. His argument is that thinkers 
are guided by two fundamental cognitive principles: They base their 
judgments either on the evidence provided by the senses or on the prod­
ucts of the intellect. When Descartes talks about being guided by a 
principle, he does not mean that one has to have explicitly formulated 
that principle; rather, whether or not one is guided by a principle is 
shown by how one reasons. Thinkers need not be aware of the princi­
ples that they follow, and probably are not aware of them. Nevertheless, 
Descartes insists that we are responsible for the principles that guide our 
thinking insofar as it is possible to find out what principles we uncon­
sciously follow. Hence, Descartes's goal in the Discourse is to persuade 
his contemporaries that they need to divorce their thinking from the 
immediacy of sense perception. 
Descartes is referring here to the importance of factors that are not in 
conscious awareness. In this regard, he anticipates the discoveries of 
Schopenhauer and Freud. But on a deeper level, he is appealing to the 
principle that the permanency or stability of phenomena may be incon­
sistent with the immediacy of moment-to-moment sensory experience. 
This sort of sophisticated reasoning, which looks beyond the immedi­
acy of the senses for truths that prevail across the dimensions of time 
and space, is characteristic of the higher reflective levels of thinking. 
For example, Descartes takes the debate over Copernicus's theory to 
an entirely new level. He is no longer talking about the merits of the 
geocentric versus heliocentric theory; rather, he transforms the issue 
into an investigation into the very nature of abstract reasoning. 
Descartes is saying that to challenge authority we need to understand 
A New History of History 
4 1 3  
the unconscious forces that render it so difficult to be guided by the fac­
ulty of reason. Such an argument takes us well into the higher stages of 
fl e development. Descartes is suggesting that because medieval and Re­
naissance thinkers never considered the operations of the mind-be­
cause they were unaware of what modern cognitive psychologists refer 
to as the "cognitive biases" that guide human thinking-they were 
drawn to defend the immediacy of their sense perceptions. 
The contrast that we have been making between structure and con­
tent is particularly illuminating when it comes to assessing Descartes's 
views about the mind. The basic principle of Descartes's view of mental 
functioning is that we are perceptually acquainted, through introspec­
tion, with the mental causes of our behavior. That is, introspection is an 
inner sense-a mental analogue of perception-and mental processes 
and states are said to be transparent (clear and distinct). Our knowledge 
of other minds, however, is confined to inferences based on the subject's 
behavior. Indeed, even the belief that there are other subjects is an infer­
ence. Thus Descartes argues in the Second Meditation: 
If I look out of the window and see men crossing the square, as I just 
happen to have done, I normally say that I see the men themselves, just 
as I say that I see the wax. Yet do I see any more than hats and coats 
which could conceal automatons? I judge that they are men. And so 
something which I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped 
solely by the faculty of judgement which is in my mind.25 
Descartes argues that, given that mental states are hidden, that you 
can only know the mental causes of behavior through behavior, all he ac­
tually sees are "mere movements." But he naturally assumes, on the basis 
of the similarity between these movements and his own, that these are 
human beings with minds, not automatons. Presumably, this is the result 
of inferences that he made as an infant, when he was just starting to fig­
ure our the way the world works and recording the differences between 
human beings and objects. Over time, these judgments became so en­
trained in his thinking that he was no longer aware that he was making a 
judgment when he observed humans acting. Bur through the discipline 
of doing science-by distinguishing between what one actually sees and 
what one infers-one is able to disclose these automatic inferential acts. 
The upshot of Descartes's argument is that, given that our under­
standing of mental functioning is grounded in introspection, it follows 

4 1 4  
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
that I can never know for certain that another human being experiences 
the same mental states as I do. Even when I see someone writhing on the 
ground, I can never be certain that the individual feels the same as I feel 
when I'm in pain. Indeed, I can never even be totally certain that other 
human beings exist. Hence, it follows that there can never be a science of 
the mind, comparable to the sciences of matter and motion; for there 
can never be an objective method for studying mental phenomena. 
It took over three centuries before Ludwig Wittgenstein, the great Aus­
trian philosopher, was finally able to overturn this extremely powerful 
skeptical argument.26 But far from being an impediment to philosophical 
and psychological thinking about the mind, Descartes's argument was 
quite the opposite. For his views about the epistemological asymmetry be­
tween first- and third-person psychological knowledge served as a catalyst 
for philosophical interest in the mind, and Jlltimately gave birth to the 
science of psychology. In structural terms, Descartes took a truly enor­
mous step here. In essence, he was attempting to extend scientific princi­
ples that had been worked out in the areas of the physical and life sciences 
to our thinking about thinking. Descartes wasn't guided by some perverse 
desire to frustrate his contemporaries with what has come to be known as 
the great Problem of Other Minds purely for the sake of inculcating a 
skeptical philosophy. Rather, Descartes was attempting to be completely 
logical in his analysis of the mind. He was trying to think objectively 
about the sources of our knowledge of the mind and thence establish the 
limits that such sources impose for our understanding of mental function­
ing. Descartes was applying more logical models to a range of phenomena 
that, from the vantage point of his period, had been dealt with in more 
magical or superstitious modes. 
In some respects, the content of Descartes's views of mental function­
ing was also quite advanced. The idea that when we look at human be­
ings we are constantly making inferences about the causes of their 
actions without being aware of it anticipates modern ideas about the 
cognitive unconscious. That is, Descartes envisages a realm of mental 
functioning of which we are unaware, but of which we can become 
aware through scientific reflection. Yet, in other respects, the content of 
Descartes's views of mental functioning lagged considerably behind the 
structural advance he was making, for despite his revolutionary attack 
on the Great Chain of Being, Descartes's thinking about human func­
tioning still remained grounded in this medieval dogma.

The fundamental principle of Descartes's view of human behavior is 
that reason and the emotions are bifurcated and belong to completely 
different modes of human functioning. Emotions constitute the basest 
level of human behavior: the instincts, the drives, and the passions that 
we share with animals. Indeed, emotions, for Descartes, are quite liter­
ally a species of involuntary reflex. Reason is completely independent 
from these mechanical processes, and, one hopes, comes to govern 
them. Thus, Descartes's view of mental functioning is actually quite 
limited because he doesn't allow for the role of environmental factors on 
the development of emotions; he doesn't recognize the variability of emo­
tional experience; he doesn't allow for the emotions to have a role in the 
operations of our cognitive capacities; and he doesn't consider the sig-
nificance of social factors on the growth of the mind. 
This contrast between the developmental levels of different aspects of 
Descartes's thought provides us with a new level of insight, not only 
into the reasons Descartes's writings had such a liberating impact on the 
Age of Reason but, equally, into the reason his views came to have such 
a constricting influence on subsequent generations. It took a consider­
able time before the content of philosophical and psychological think­
ing started to come in line with the structural advances that Descartes 
instituted. But then, this is the pattern we have seen throughout this 
chapter: Time and again we see structural advances opening the door 
for a subsequent broadening in the application of our higher reflective 
thinking. Indeed, no better example of this phenomenon can be found 
than in the next major historical epoch, the Enlightenment. 
THE ENLIGHTEN MENT 
The sections into which this chapter is divided are based on the stan­
dard view about what constitute the major epochs in Western history. 
But modern historians of ideas are divided about the legitimacy oflook­
ing at history as epochs. The problem is that by assigning a label we 
tend to focus on a few representative figures and ignore the many who 
do not conform to our narrow view of what defines the period in ques­
tion. Yet many remain deeply drawn to the idea of distinctive historical 
periods, if only because there is a striking difference between periods 
that are as close in time and culture as, say, the Age of Reason and the 

4 1 6  
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
Enlightenment. The problem is how to capture this: how to define the 
period in question in a way that encompasses as many of the complex 
social and intellectual cross-currents as possible. But here one runs into 
the problem that afflicts any attempt at essentialist theories: If the defi­
nition is too rigid, we run the risk of excluding far too many elements; 
and if the definition is too general, it loses any real function. The En­
lightenment has come to serve as something of a paradigm example of 
this problem in the history of ideas. 
The Enlightenment was an age of dramatic social change, marked by 
a continuing decline in the authority of the Church and the continuing 
social and political ascent of the bourgeoisie. Among the influential fig­
ures usually singled out in this era are Adam Smith, who argued for the 
principle of laissez faire on the grounds that unleashing individuals to 
pursue their own interests would ensure economic expansion; Charles­
Louis de Secondat Montesquieu, whose writings on the division of ex­
ecutive, legislative, and judicial power helped shape the framing of the 
U.S. Constitution; and, of course, Isaac Newton, whose demonstration 
that the natural universe is a realm of law and regularity inspired the 
great scientific revolution. 
During these years, a new sense of confidence arose in the powers of 
the human mind to mold the physical world for the material and moral 
betterment of humankind. The early exponents of this optimistic out­
look, the philosophes popularized the scientific ideas of the seventeenth 
century and worked to expose contemporary social and political abuses. 
They argued that reform was necessary and possible and that religion it­
self should be based on reason and lead to moral behavior. This enlight­
ened form of religious belief, known as Deism, continued to argue for 
the existence of God, which, according to the philosophes, could be 
empirically deduced from the contemplation of nature. Indeed, they ar­
gued that, because nature provides evidence of a rational God, He must 
favor rational morality. They consequently argued for the belief in life 
after death, when rewards and punishments would be meted out ac­
cording to the virtue a person had shown in this life. 
One of the greatest monuments of the philosophes' influence on the 
Enlightenment was the publication of the Encyclopedia, or a Systematic 
Dictionary of Science, Arts, and the Trades, under the leadership of 
Diderot and d'Alembert. The first volume appeared in 175 1  and eventu­
ally ran to twenty-eight volumes; it was comprised of articles on all man­
ner of current affairs ranging from politics, ethics, law, religion, and 
A New History of History 
41 7 
society to manufacturing, canal building, ship construction, and agricul­
ture. The Encyclopedia was based on the principle that the average person 
had every right to the same information as the ruling elite. The govern­
ment was fully aware of the revolutionary implications of the Encyclope­
dia and tried twice, unsuccessfully, to suppress its publication. The final 
volume appeared in 1771 and is often seen as one of the critical factors 
leading up to the French Revolution. As for the Encyclopedia, the struc­
ture (its being designed for the general public) and the content (the top­
ics surveyed and the manner in which they were expounded) represented 
a significant developmental advance. 
Enlightenment thinkers (e.g., Voltaire and Kant) were themselves 
aware that a small number of themes running throughout the writings of 
their era served to distinguish the Enlightenment as a distinctive epoch 
in Western development. The most important of these themes were the 
concerns with 
1. the autonomy of reason; 
2. the dangers of authority; 
3. the perfectibility of humanity; 
4. the ability of the human mind to discover the mechanical laws govern-
mg nature; 
5. the ability of the human mind to understand the forces governing man 
and society; 
6. the solidarity of enlightened intellectuals; 
7. the dangers of nationalism. 
We find writers returning to these issues over and over again, explor­
ing them from every possible angle in polemical debates that, for such 
an enlightened age, could be remarkably polarized. For that matter, 
some of the greatest thinkers of the period, among them Rousseau, pre­
sented so many different and often conflicting ideas that their views 
came to inspire diametrically opposed movements. Indeed, the princi­
ple reason historians of ideas have balked at trying to define the Enlight­
enment is because of the dizzying number of different theories and ideas 
pursued in every conceivable realm of intellectual inquiry. 
It is precisely here where distinguishing between the structure and con­
tent of what people were thinking becomes illuminating. To be sure, oth­
ers have touched on this important theme. For example, Lester Crocker 
suggests that "the common element" that unified the Enlightenment 

41 8 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
"lay more in how men thought than in what they thought."27 In develop­
mental psychology, Kohlberg based his stage model of moral devel­
opment on how a child responds to a story about a moral dilemma, 
where what matters is the structure and not the content of the child's re­
sponse.28 What our framework adds to these insights is the first system­
atic way of looking at the structure of thinking as an integrated 
emotional! cognitive process. That is, whereas earlier structuralist theo­
rists viewed cognition as a completely self-contained phenomenon, our 
approach looks at the structure of thinking in terms of its intertwined 
emotional and cognitive elements. 
Such a framework enables us to make sense of what is perhaps the 
most striking feature of the Enlightenment: the turbulent clash of polar­
ities. The tone of the period is captured in Swift's Battle of the Books, 
where Ancients are pitted against Moderns. Swift's satire is an attack on 
the endless conflicts that riddled the eighteenth century: In philosophy 
we see the great battle between Rationalists and Empiricists (the 
philosophes versus Locke, Berkeley, and Hume); in biology the fight be­
tween Vitalists and Materialists (Barthez versus la Mettrie); in politics 
the clash between republicans and monarchists, utopians and re­
formists, egalitarians and elitists; in ethics the fight between pantheists 
and cynics (Shaftsbury versus Mandeville). This is the period that cul­
minates in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights on the one hand 
and in the anarchy of the French Revolution on the other. 
Yet, as we saw in Chapter 2, it is precisely this capacity to grapple 
with abstract dichotomies that is one of the hallmarks of the higher 
stages of f/ e development. That is, once individuals have passed beyond 
the ninth stage, they become increasingly aware of abstract dichotomies 
and of the connection between the antinomies in their thinking in very 
different areas. The higher their development, the more individuals be­
gin searching for a resolution of these antinomies that is consistent 
across multiple domains. It is not until reaching the highest stages, how­
ever, that individuals acquire the integrated thinking required for this 
sort of synthesis. 
Our use of the term "antinomy" here is intended to draw attention to 
the thought of perhaps the greatest of the Enlightenment thinkers, Im­
manuel Kant. Reflecting the spirit of his age, Kant based his monumen­
tal Critique of Pure Reason on the significance of four fundamental 
antinomies-equally rational but contradictory views-dealing with 
space and time, the principle of atomism, the existence of freedom, and 
A New History of History 
4 1 9  
the existence of God. For example, the first antinomy presents the Thesis 
that "the world has a beginning in time, and is also limited as regards 
space" and the Anti-Thesis that "the world has no beginning, and no 
limits in space; it is infinite as regards both time and space." The content 
of these antinomies is a reflection of just how broad the application of 
the higher reflective capacities was becoming. But structurally, what is so 
striking about Kant's argument is his attempt to achieve a critical synthe­
sis by ascending to still a higher level of reflective thinking in which one 
recognizes the cognitive significance of these antinomies as such. 
Kant's famous argument is that when reason attempts to transcend ex­
perience, it falls into antinomies. He set out to resolve these antinomies 
by distinguishing between the limits of what we can know by experience 
and the a priori structures in the mind that determine the limits of what 
we can think. Kant's progression to this higher level of reflective thinking 
is an example of how the highest capacities of reflective thinking emerge 
only once one has passed beyond the ninth stage of development. For 
one can only begin looking for a way of reconciling the inconsistencies 
and dichotomies in one's thinking once one's thinking is grounded in a 
strong sense of self and internalized standards. This strong sense of self 
both drives and enables one to search for a way of reconciling the di­
chotomies in one's thinking, and, in Kant's argument, serves as the emo­
tional/cognitive foundation for his transcendental resolution of the 
antinomies. 
The sort of aspect shift that enables one to transcend a seemingly ir-
reconcilable conflict seen in Kant's self-proclaimed Copernican revolu­
tion is the hallmark of ascending to a higher level of reflective thinking. 
Indeed, one reason Kant had such a profound influence on German 
philosophy throughout the following century is because a thinker who 
has reached the highest levels of reflective capacities and is able to look 
at rational dichotomies orthogonally, as it were, is a source of profound 
inspiration to those who have advanced far enough to grasp the level of 
abstraction involved in such a synthesis and proceed from there in their 
own rational system building. 
Not surprisingly, it was Kant who came up with the name "Enlight­
enment" for this pivotal epoch in human history in his 1784 essay, "Was 
ist Aufklarung?" ("What Is Enlightenment?"), in which Kant explicitly 
spelled out that "Sapere aude! 'Have courage to use your own reason'" is 
the motto of the Enlightenment. This act of self-identification returns 
us to where we began this section, for it is interesting to reflect on the 

420 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
nature of the terms by which the major epochs in human history are 
commonly known. Most of the terms that we use are simply descriptive 
names. Originally the term "renaissance" simply referred to the rediscov­
ery of Roman styles of art (this was the sense in which the Italian writer 
Giovanni Bocaccio used the term), but through the writings of Voltaire 
and Jules Michelet (in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries respec­
tively) the Renaissance came to symbolize not just the extraordinary ad­
vances in architecture and art but also the beginnings of the modern age 
as represented by the great scientific, philosophical, and social revolu­
tions taking place. But of all the titles that we use, "The Age of Reason" 
and "The Enlightenment" are the only philosophical terms used to des­
ignate an historical epoch. Significantly, both were coined by Enlighten­
ment philosophers. 
Enlightenment thinkers felt that their era represented an intellectual 
apex in human history; yet they were deeply concerned, precisely be­
cause of this sense of historical importance, about succumbing to 
hubris. Alexander Pope, for example, in his highly influential Essay on 
Man (1 732-1734), warns that human beings are not the center of the 
universe, that man must learn to accept his intermediary position on 
the Great Chain of Being. Like so many Enlightenment thinkers, Pope 
argues that, even though life may seem chaotic and purposeless, it 
functions in a perfectly rational fashion. However vaunted our intelli­
gence might be, we can perceive only a small portion of this order. 
. Hence, reason ultimately teaches us the limits of reason and the impor­
tance of faith. 
From our developmental perspective, it is highly interesting to reflect 
on this interesting tension between medieval and Cartesian ideas. For all 
the emphasis on free will, Enlightenment thinking remains strongly de­
terministic. To be sure, the Great Chain of Being was now viewed more 
as a poetic device than a serious cosmological argument; but the very 
fact that it could serve this poetic role is a reflection of the strong fatalis­
tic elements that still suffuse eighteenth-century writings. Their think­
ing is also marked by a new form of determinism, one that is grounded 
in the science of mechanics rather than in mythology or theology. In­
deed, they continued to view history in the same sort of cyclical terms as 
the Greeks, but with a highly significant modification: Now we en­
counter the metaphor of the spiral (in the writings of the Italian 
philosopher Giambattista Vico). The spiral metaphor represents the 
idea that history does indeed repeat itself, successive generations going 
A New History of History 
421 
through the same cycles of ascent, consolidation, and decline, but with 
an overall movement upwards and outwards. Thus the Enlightenment 
view of history introduces an important new dimension in the Western 
view of history, which has become bound up with the idea of progress: a 
theme that was to dominate nineteenth-century thought. What we see 
here is how, through an expanding sense of self, Enlightenment thinkers 
were developing an expanding sense of history: a future filled with un-
known possibility. 
THE DEVELO PMENTAL 
MO DEL OF H ISTORY 
In the developmental model of history that we have outlined in this 
chapter, the sciences of human functioning take a special place in the 
historical process. It is not an historical accident that psychology did not 
emerge until the middle of the nineteenth century but rather a reflec­
tion of the need to reach a high level of fie development before we can 
begin thinking about thinking systematically. Also, science, technology, 
mathematics, philosophy, and literature had to reach high fie levels 
themselves before they could serve as the foundational platform for 
tackling the ultimate challenge, which is thinking about ourselves. 
There are twelve basic principles operating in this fie view of human 
history: 
1 .  The dynamics of human history are best understood in structuralist 
terms. 
2. Unlike Piaget's structuralist theory, however, the fie model places affect 
at the center of an integrated structuralist theory that accounts for so­
cial, emotional, cognitive, and communicative development. 
3. The model stresses that individuals, groups, and societies may develop 
higher reflective capacities in some domains (e.g., science, technology) 
while remaining at a lower stage of development in others (e.g., human 
functioning) . 
4. The model accounts for the overall progressive aspect of human history 
without postulating a unidirectional process of development. On the 
contrary, one of the key themes in this approach is that it is always pos­
sible for individuals, groups, and societies to regress to a lower develop-
mental level. 
. 

422 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
5. The advances and the regressions that mark human history are influ­
enced by the stages of affective transformation, including affect gestur­
ing, that characterize early formative and subsequent relationships (as 
described in Chapters 1 and 2). 
6. These advances and regressions are influenced by 
• culturally transmitted practices in co-regulated emotional signaling 
leading to symbol formation and higher-level reflective capacities, 
and 
• derivative group structures, institutions, and practices that pro­
mote or undermine an individual's continuing development and 
exercise of these emotional and reflective processes. 
7. 
By not focusing sufficiently on the importance of culturally mediated 
family practices and structures that promote the processes described in 6 
and 7 above, we run the risk of falling victim to the dictum of reliving 
history as proposed by the Spanish American philosopher George San­
tayana. That is, by not understanding the engine of human history we 
are in danger of sabotaging that engine with regressive practices, beliefs, 
and institutions. 
8. Higher-level reflective thinking, including derivative institutions and 
practices, leads to relatively more stable and technologically more ad­
vanced societies, which progressively frees up more time and interest in 
further improving these formative practices involving families and com­
munities. In turn, these adaptive processes support new technologies as 
well as even more advanced political and economic opportunities. All 
these favorable factors maintain a positive progression towards higher 
developmental levels and the processes that support them. 
9. The greater the number of individuals who master these higher reflec­
tive abilities, the more widespread the practice of science, literature, and 
philosophy becomes, and the more stable the society becomes; for the 
greater the proportion of the society that possesses these abilities, the 
more stable are the society's political and social organizations or the pro­
cesses by which the society negotiates conflicts. 
1 0. The more people who master these higher developmental levels, the bet­
ter able the society is to control its technology. The tendency in human 
history has been for a society's advances in science and technology to 
move ahead of its grasp of human emotions and human psychology. A 
problem occurs when a society's technology is way out in front of its 
ability to deal with it socially and emotionally (think of the dangers 
A New History of History 
423 
posed by a fanatical group or country that has acquired nuclear and bio­
logical weapons, or the problems relating to cloning). 
1 1. A similar point applies to a society's institutions. Attempts, either by a 
small group of advanced thinkers or even by a foreign power, to install 
advanced political and social institutions in a society that has not yet de­
veloped the base to support such institutions can also lead to instability 
or a regressive political movement. 
12. The process of fie development has not only been critical throughout 
human evolution, up to and including recent human history, but re­
mains critical. That is, we are continuing to develop, to move beyond 
the high levels we have reached in technology, science, philosophy, and 
the arts into the realm of human functioning; and we are seeing a 
broadening in the portion of society that is reaching these higher levels. 
This is a gradual process, however, and there are all sorts of regressive 
forces that we must contend with (both internal and external). 
It is important to emphasize that what we have presented in this 
chapter is not a theory of human history but rather a lens for looking at 
human history. The importance of this new lens lies in the sorts of ques­
tions that it leads us to ask in trying to assess the competing forces and 
ptocesses involved in the progressive-regressive pattern of human his­
tory, which, overall, trends not just towards more sophisticated tech­
nologies with a greater capacity to control nature but also towards 
greater social complexity and differentiation. One of the key features of 
this new lens is that it prompts us to look at the sorts of problems that 
earlier cultures were grappling with, for the nature of the solutions pro­
vides us with one of the most important tools we have for assessing their 
stage of fie development.

Future Evolution: 
Toward a Psychology of 
Global Interdependency 
D
ESPITE DARWIN'S WARNINGS AGAINST looking at evolution in 
teleological terms, there has been a consistent tendency to view 
the evolution of human beings as the final step in a long and orderly 
progression leading from the Common Ancestor up to Homo sapiens. 
On this line of thinking, what marks anatomically modern humans as 
the terminus of this progression is not our anatomy but our "cognitive 
architecture": that is, the ways in which we process information and 
communicate; the basic emotions that we experience and the cluster of 
physical and behavioral processes linked to these emotions; and the 
kinds of behaviors in which we are predisposed to engage, some of 
which may today seem irrational but whose function can be understood 
when viewed in the context of the Pleistocene conditions in which they 
were supposedly selected. 
To gain an understanding of the nature of human nature, we have 
also looked at the evolution of humans from nonhuman primates and 
hominids. But in the theory that we have presented in this book, hu­
man evolution is seen as an ongoing, not a completed process, and a 
child's language, emotional, cognitive, and higher reflective traits are 
seen not as predetermined but as developing as a function of her "expe­
riences." These experiences involve an ongoing dynamic, largely insepa­
rable, relationship between nature and nurture. Our goal has been not 
simply to understand the biological and cultural forces that have 
424 
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
425 
brought humans to where they are today but, equally important, to un­
derstand the nature of these processes so that we can better meet the 
challenges that confront us. 
As societies have grown larger and more diverse, encompassing more 
and more different cultural subgroups, they have had to develop ever 
more reflective capacities in meeting the challenges of their increasingly 
complex social existence. Now as never before, the challenge that hu­
manity faces in this respect is daunting: that of global interdependency. 
To meet this challenge, humans must ascend to still a higher level of re­
flection and empathy than has been attained in even the most advanced 
cultures if we are to avoid the fate of earlier societies that were unable to 
respond cohesively to the challenges they faced. 
As we look back through history, it's possible to observe that in re­
sponse to new challenges, human groups have evidenced a series of pat­
terns. One of these has been to narrow their focus and become more 
polarized in their thinking, or to shift into varying degrees of unrealistic 
or magical thinking, or to become increasingly fragmented and chaotic 
in their social organization and behavior. On the other hand, another 
tendency one can observe, a decidedly more adaptive one, is to develop 
a broader understanding of the challenges and then take an integrated 
approach based on reflective processes and social and political institu­
tions. As we will discuss later in this chapter, many nations are now be­
ing faced with a diminished sense of power relative to other groups, in 
part related to the growing interdependency of shared dangers as well as 
economics and communication. Are we currently observing shifts to­
wards polarized and unrealistic thinking? Or are we observing new, 
more reflective integrated approaches? 
To be sure, at present, there is a rapidly growing awareness of the 
enormous dangers and difficulties posed by global interdependency. But 
there is also a growing sense of helplessness at the magnitude of these 
challenges. 
We are certainly not the first group to face enormous challenges. 
Challenge is a cycle that has played out repeatedly throughout human 
history. Some groups rose to the challenges confronting them by evolv­
ing new levels of social organization, and some groups that were psycho­
logically unable to rise to the occasion went into serious decline. What 
sets us apart today is not the fact that we face such daunting challenges, 
therefore, but simply that our challenges are far more serious than those 

426 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
faced by earlier societies; indeed, the very continuance of life on this 
planet is now at stake. 
In this chapter we will briefly examine the nature of this social reality, 
especially the shared dangers involved in nuclear and biological weapons, 
and then outline the new psychology that is needed to deal in an adap­
tive and reflective manner with rapidly advancing global interdepend­
ency. The developmental model of evolution that we have presented 
provides us with a new lens to help us understand not only the capacities 
that need to be inculcated but also the forces that are presently impeding 
this process. It will help us understand how and why our growing inter­
dependency can lead to greater social fragmentation, more extreme types 
of polarized beliefs, and greater hostility; or new adaptive levels of per­
sonal and social organization. 
GLOBAL I NTERDEPENDENCY 
Terrorist events around the world over the past decade have forced many 
groups to face more fully a reality that had been emerging for some time: 
shared dangers-for the first time any one group can, through nuclear, 
biological, or ecological events, destroy life for all other groups on the 
planet-as well as shared communications and economies have brought 
individuals from all parts of the world together into a closer interdepend­
ency than at any time before in human history. 
Various Western governmental advisory groups warned of terrorist 
assaults before they became a prominent reality, but with little notice. 
They cautioned the public that, as weapons of mass destruction become 
more widely available, these assaults would become more dangerous. 
These warnings were consistently ignored. 
The interdependency of shared dangers, the knowledge that anyone 
can destroy everyone else, is a difficult concept to grab hold of psycho­
logically. During the Cold War, with only the United States and the So­
viet Union in a position to destroy the globe, there was mutual shared 
deterrence. Where will we be able to find some relative safety when 
hundreds of groups have massive destructive power? 
A small group could set off a biological weapon in its own nation 
that would destroy life on the entire planet. The seemingly private ac­
tion of a nation state within its own geographical boundary may, there­
fore, have far-reaching consequences that are anything but private. 
Toward a PsychoLogy of GLobaL Interdependency 
427 
Furthermore, technologies of mass destruction are likely to become 
more and more accessible, even with our best efforts at limiting them. 
Over the next fifty years, it is unlikely that the defensive systems we're 
currently working on-whether immunizations for biological weapons 
or antiballistic missile systems for nuclear missiles-will keep up with 
rapidly proliferating offensive technologies. If large numbers of terrorist 
organizations and outlaw nations gain access to these weapons, tradi­
tional military interventions will be less viable due to a new balance of 
power in which even small groups have world-threatening destructive 
power. 
The current challenge is further complicated by another worrisome 
fact. Due to the globalization of information and technology, groups no 
longer have as much autonomy in the evolution of their social, eco­
nomic, and political structures. In other words, the relative boundaries 
of groups have gradually been changing with the increased flow of 
people and ideas across social groups. Groups with very different types 
of beliefs, different concepts of humanity and reality, and different pro­
cesses of governance, thinking, and decisionmaking now have access to 
technologies of mass destruction, and this access will increase in the fu­
ture. These different beliefs and processes may result in very different 
ways of regulating or not regulating weapons of mass destruction. This 
is a frightening reality to confront. 
What is the solution to this dilemma? Can destructive technologies be 
kept out of the hands of groups lacking national and international insti­
tutions that can assure safety and global responsibility? It is no wonder 
that there is a growing sense of numbness in the face of these dangers. 
As humans look for a strategy to promote safety and security in the 
Context of the new reality of the interdependency, more can be done in 
the short term-such as immunization for small pox and better safety 
procedures on airlines. Improved international collaboration can reduce 
weapons of mass destruction and strengthen our defensive tactics. But 
in the long term, a very different process is needed to afford a measure 
of safety and security. 
The first step in this process is to realize that the interdependency of 
shared dangers means that nations are even more interconnected than 
ever before. Shared dangers exert an influence on interdependency that 
adds significantly to economic, social, and cultural factors. Therefore, 
collective action is more essential than ever before and will be even more 
so in the future. 

428 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
How do we create and maintain the collaborations that will be in­
creasingly necessary in the future? How can individuals and groups 
broaden their shared sense of humanity and reality to encompass a 
greater range of differences than ever before? How can a greater consen­
sus emerge among peoples on what defines another human being? How 
can such a consensus accommodate the enormous diversity of the 
world? How can various nations share a common reality and solve prob­
lems together when reflective problem-solving capacities vary, when 
there is a great deal of polarized thinking ("us" versus "them") , and 
when thinking often considers only the present rather than the long­
term future? 
RISING TO THE CHALLENGE 
OF GLOBAL INTERDEPENDENCY 
In Chapter 1 3, we saw how, at each level of group development, there 
are adaptive and maladaptive responses to the new challenges that a 
group faces. In addition to being reflected in the institutions and gov­
ernmental or social processes embraced by the group, these adaptive 
versus maladaptive responses have a significant bearing on the psycho­
logical functioning of the individuals in that group. 
For example, at the first level of group development, a group might 
respond adaptively to a threat to its security by instituting organizations 
and practices that maintain order without impinging on the rights and 
freedoms of the individual; or a group might respond maladaptively, 
maintaining security through practices that infringe significantly on 
personal freedoms. In a worse scenario, a group may actually fail to co­
here around a common set of practices and decline into a state where 
the safety of the individual is in constant jeopardy. 
At the second level of group development, a group that contains vari­
ous subgroups-such as we see in modern multicultural societies-can 
respond adaptively to this internal complexity by cohering around re­
flective institutions and processes that promote a strong sense of shared 
identity. Or it can respond maladaptively, unable to attain cohesion at 
the macro level. It may cohere around superficial traits only, such as skin 
color or ethnicity, or fall under the sway of a demagogue. In groups that 
respond adaptively, individuals are able to project themselves into the 
shoes of another while still maintaining their own sense of personal 
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
429 
identity. But individuals in a group that responds maladaptively tend to 
function as isolated entities. Such individuals typically regress into po­
larized thinking ("us" versus "them" mentality) when in conflict with 
other individuals or subgroups. 
At the third level of group development, groups faced with the chal­
lenge of assimilating a wide range of cultural diversity can strive to 
maintain a shared sense of reality at the presymbolic level by creating 
adaptive practices that enable them to develop, through frequent inter­
actions with a wide range of others, an implicit understanding of a 
broad range of differences and themes. As indicated earlier, this implicit 
understanding is through a continuous back-and-forth chain of prever­
bal affect signals. One can readily picture how these types of signals oc­
curring between many members of a group serve as a rapid system of 
cross-communication regarding the security and norms of that particu­
lar group. It's amazing to observe how quickly humans, and even non­
human primates, respond to the multiple facial expressions, looks, 
glances, and changes of body posture of several other group members at 
the same time. Most of this occurs without explicit conscious awareness. 
However, for such a system to develop and sustain itself and function 
on behalf of maintaining a group's security and identity, the group 
members have to have access to one another that allows for this rapid 
visceral type of communication. Without daily interactions, such im­
plicit understanding is often impossible. Therefore, a group can easily 
create maladaptive patterns by failing to develop the sorts of programs 
necessary to promote a great deal of interactions between the groups 
that need to come together. 
In such maladaptive responses, subgroups are likely to disengage 
ftom each other and become more and more isolated and self-absorbed. 
Individuals in a group that responds adaptively experience the immedi­
acy with each other that is needed to develop a shared sense of reality 
and humanity. Such individuals are better able to engage in cohesive, 
integrated thought patterns and problem-solving strategies. Individuals 
in a group that responds maladaptively to the challenge of assimilating a 
wide range of cultural variations tend to be constricted in the range of 
differences and themes that they can implicitly communicate. These in­
dividuals tend to become more rigid and fragmented in their communi­
cation and thinking, and to pursue impulsive, action-oriented attempts 
at solutions rather than the kinds of reflective, strategic ones seen in 
groups that respond adaptively.

Groups that respond adaptively to the challenge of achieving a shared 
sense of reality at the symbolic level are able to recognize and accept the 
symbols of others as meaningful while not sharing in the belief systems 
in which those symbols are embedded. Such a group establishes institu­
tions and practices that promote not just tolerance but, even more im­
portant, shared understanding amongst its various subgroups. Thus, for 
example, individuals can understand what is involved in a foreign con­
cept such as voodoo even though they reject some of the basic beliefs 
enshrined in this religion. But a group that responds maladaptively at 
this level of group development fails to establish the sorts of institutions 
and practices that promote mutual understanding, and because of their 
lack of familiarity with and knowledge of other cultures, individuals are 
unable to understand the true meaning of others' symbols. 
To respond adaptively at the higher levels of group organization, 
groups have to develop reflective practices and institutions that support 
logical reality-based problem solving, have stability through change, and 
promote the development of individuals capable of looking into the fu­
ture, of embracing a wide range of differences, and of engaging in truly 
dynamic thinking that involves sizing up a situation in its full complex­
ity and considering and weighing all the relevant factors and options. 
This is no small task. It demands a variety of emotional and cognitive 
skills. To begin with, it involves weighing what's important to oneself as 
well as to other parties. This is a difficult challenge because it demands a 
high level of empathy (putting oneself in someone else's shoes) as well as 
considerable knowledge of the other party's background, current situa­
tion, and future options. Decisionmaking then involves weighing the 
different factors, possible options, and related future probabilities. This 
requires judgment based on considerable emotional experience with and 
knowledge of the issues at hand. In addition, a high level of reflective 
thinking employs the processes just described in the face of intense 
emotions, such as rage, fear, and suspiciousness. Embracing these subtle 
reflective processes is even more challenging for groups than for individ­
uals because, as suggested earlier, the commonality that organizes large 
groups can often be associated with more polarized and less reflective 
practices and institutions. 
Groups that respond maladaptively tend to relinquish their capacity 
for reflective thinking under the pressure of strong feelings and are un­
able to maintain their institutions and practices at the same level of 
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
431 
reflectiveness during periods of acute stress. These groups may be con­
stricted in their range of empathy and frequently regress into polarized, 
narrow, here-and-now thinking during times of acute stress. For exam­
ple, such groups may be unable to project sufficiently into the future 
(i.e., considering only a five-year future consequence rather than a fifty 
or hundred-year future consequence); unable to characterize the current 
situation in terms of relevant historical or other current factors (i.e., cre­
ate a relevant context and internal standards); unable to look at subtlety 
or gray-area differences in the issues at hand; and unable to look at indi­
rect or multiple influences on the phenomenon at the same time. 
The level of individuals, practices, and institutions that characterize a 
group influences not only the integrity and type of governance structure 
it can embrace but also its system of justice and its potential for eco­
nomic growth. Reflective individuals tend to better assess the marginal 
value of the next unit of investment better than unreflective or polarized 
individuals who, therefore, tend to precipitate greater economic insta­
bility. As we look at how groups organize to meet their developmental 
needs, it's important to describe a feature of the relationship between 
the different developmental dimensions of groups. In general, the way 
in which a group meets its basic developmental needs serves as a foun­
dation for and, to a degree, fuels symbolic group processes. 
For example, a group may cohere around its need for security. Dur­
ing the course of evolution, we can readily imagine that a certain group 
size would enhance the security and survival of the group and its mem­
bers. But the ability of the group members to feel close to each other, 
trust one another, and exchange affective signals with each other to ne­
gotiate the basic issues of safety, danger, power, relationships, and the 
like would also, in part, determine the size of the group. For example, 
beyond a certain size, the intimacy of relationships within the group 
might be sufficiently compromised as to undermine the relationships 
and communication patterns that sustain the group. Therefore, the 
need for security and survival, in part, may motivate the formation of 
the group. Yet, its ability to maintain relationships and affective signal­
ing to negotiate basic group themes, in part, may determine the struc­
ture and size of the group. 
The group's capacity to create symbols and ultimately institutions 
that embrace these symbols may further determine the structure and 
size of the group. Shared symbols and institutions, such as those that 
-----

432 
T H E  F I RS T  I DEA 
represent concepts like "equality" or "justice," may make it possible for 
larger and larger groups to form and function. With such shared sym­
bols, individuals are less dependent on direct relationships and commu­
nication to negotiate basic group themes such as safety and danger or 
group norms. Therefore, shared symbols and institutions can, in part, 
serve the purposes that intimate relationships and direct, implicit affec­
tive communication serve. 
But shared symbols and the institutions that represent them obtain 
their saliency, in part, from the emotional investment of group mem­
bers in them. In times of heightened need for security, for example a 
threat of another group, a group might invest very intently in its shared 
symbols and institutions (e.g., a flag). In times where the need for secu­
rity is not high, the emotional investment in shared symbols may be 
lower. During these times, the trust between group members, the access 
they have to each other for implicit communication, and the strength of 
the traditions behind the shared symbols and institutions, as well as the 
nature of the symbols and institutions themselves, may be relatively 
more important for sustaining the group. The larger and more complex 
the group, and the less the immediate need for security, the more the 
group may depend on emotional relationships and communication pat­
terns to maintain itself and function. 
We can summarize this material with the following table:

Symbolic objects seen as

Societies characterized by 
reflective individuals and 
institutions tend towards more 
gradual downturns and greater 
capacity for corrections. 
Stable reflective societies have 
mechanisms that permit them 
to change while retaining core 
values; such societies can handle 
(literature, art, music, movies, 
theater, television shows, and 
news coverage) a wide range of 
emotional themes. They also 
continue to grow to higher levels 
of reflective practices that include 
taking into account a broader 
range of themes, longer term 
projections into the future, and 
wiser decisions that can support 
adaptive evolutionary pathways. 
Maladaptive 
Symbolic objects are seen as cartying 
power in and of themselves; symbol 
systems are fragmented, inconsistent, 
idiosyncratic, and discordant with the 
reality they purportedly represent; they 
allow for a few strictly defined categories 
of thought and behavior. 
Societies characterized by individuals and 
groups that are vulnerable to polarized, 
all-or-nothing thinking are at risk for 
more sharp downturns, particularly as 
investment opportunities decrease and 
those opportuni ties that are lefi: demand 
more judgment. 
In unstable societies that lack high-level 
reflective institutions, new policies only 
arise from social upheavals that can 
result in a new constitution, flag, and 
sometimes even name; such societies 
can only handle a limited number of 
emotional themes, generally in a 
constricted manner. Such groups also 
tend to operate in the here-and-now of 
becoming polarized, fragmented, and/or 
impulsive. 
DEVELOPM ENTAL PERSPECTIVES 
ON CONFLICTS BETWEEN NATIONS 
To illustrate the developmental lens we have just outlined, consider its 
application to one of the most pressing challenges that currently con­
fronts us: that of resolving conflicts among nations in an interdepend­
ent world. For it shows us how the level of group functioning influences 
the way the group deals with conflicts with other groups, as well as new, 
more adaptive ways worthy of consideration. 
As history so well documents, nations often deal with conflict by using 
strategies such as disengagement, lack of ongoing affective interactions, 

434 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
polarized thinking, and illusions of more definitive power than they actu­
ally have, given the interdependency among groups. Diplomats view such 
actions simply as moves on a chess board. In an interdependent world, 
however, an effect of a strategy such as disengagement may not be to in­
timidate or motivate another group to change, but to block communica-
tion at a number of levels and increase shared dangers. 
. 
As we look at the developmental needs of groups and apply this 
framework to conflicts within the larger scope of international relation­
ships, we see that an individual group may try to meet its own needs for 
safety and security and coherence with strategies that diminish the pos­
sibility of adaptive patterns in the larger international group. Later we 
will explore how national groups can meet their developmental needs 
and resolve conflicts with other groups while supporting, rather than 
undermining, the functioning of the larger international group. This is 
especially vital in an interdependent world. 
Polarized thinking, disengagement, and other similar strategies are 
often part of a mindset based on a time in history when there was rela­
tively less interdependency and, perhaps, a greater degree of relative 
power residing in the hands of one or a few nations. At present, because 
of the interdependency of shared dangers, such a mindset is no longer 
realistic. A denial of one's relative vulnerability, however, coupled with 
an unrealistic perception of one's relative power, may maintain earlier, 
but now unrealistic, mindsets. It can interfere with accurate current 
assessments. 
For example, an accurate perception of what an adversary needs, can 
accept, and will do if frustrated, as well as accurate information about 
oneself, is vital to maintaining a reflective stance and negotiating an 
agreement. Yielding to the temptation to regard the views and motives 
of others as all good or all bad prevents one from obtaining realistic in­
formation or devising effective strategies. For well into five decades, 
both sides in the Cold War were drawn into devastating military spend­
ing and two actual wars. The relations of the superpowers with coun­
tries around the world were distorted by categorizing them as allies or 
adversaries. This prevented efforts to understand each side's motivations 
and act on that understanding. 
Many nations repeatedly project overly simplified notions onto oth­
ers and repeatedly discover that foreign plans and aspirations are more 
complicated than were thought. Oversimplification has the deleterious 
effect of weakening internal institutions. If leaders give the public pat 
Toward a Psychology o/Global Interdependency 
435 
answers and polarized choices that do not represent the full complexities 
of challenges, they undermine not only people's confidence but their 
ability to think reflectively about world affairs. 
Moreover, when political leaders use the mass media to feed the pub­
lic misleading, polarized information, the public loses the capacity to 
make careful distinctions in the national discourse. Misinformation 
may serve the short-term political advantage of some individuals, but in 
the long run it cripples a nation's ability to govern itself. 
Modern polling techniques can exacerbate this situation. After public 
figures have framed issues in a polarized way, pollsters conduct surveys 
to determine which positions are popular. Leaders then justify their 
policies and actions by referring to public opinion polls that were ini­
tially shaped by their own misinformation. A cycle of escalating misin­
formation and polarization replaces informed debate. 
How can we construct a realistic picture of other groups and use it to 
deal with conflicts more effectively? Understanding the importance of 
experience at the level of implicit processes, including emotional ex­
changes and gestures as outlined earlier, is critical for grasping how to 
sustain realistic perceptions. Expressions and gestures that convey inten­
tions and values are essential in understanding how to create realistic in­
formation and perceptions. 
Experience with the broader range of ways we exchange notions of 
each other can be undermined in five ways: 
• 
First, people often prematurely substitute words for experience before 
they have developed enough common experience to comprehend each 
other's real intentions or trust each other's word. 
• 
Second, leaders may rely overly on mere verbal assurances and pay too 
little attention to actual behavior. 
• 
Third, when people try to force or to manufacture nonexistent accord, 
their interactions with others may be so structured as to prevent nonver­
bal cues from betraying their true feelings. 
• 
Fourth, as tensions rise, individuals and nations tend to minimize con­
tact and thus the possibility of many forms of implicit and nonverbal 
communICation. 
• 
Finally, individuals and nations often, and usually futilely, try to set lim­
its for others' behavior without the benefit of a broader relationship 
within which to mediate disputes and accurately gauge the results of var­
ious actions. 

436 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
When communication is undermined in these ways, a shift occurs to­
ward the tendencies or patterns outlined earlier, that is, for polarized 
thinking, where power is exaggerated and not seen in its fully relativistic 
context; where action is valued in its own right, regardless of its impact, 
because of the unrealistic belief that action and power will lead others to 
follow the "leader" or "leader group"; and/or where escapist, unrealistic 
beliefs and practices prevail. 
Looking at international affairs in terms of the developmental capaci­
ties of groups offers guidelines for evaluating different approaches. Con­
structive communication means 
1. maintaining nonthreatening engagement through international organiza­
tions (i.e., not using disengagement or isolation as a signal or sanction­
it doesn't work in an interdependent world) even at times of disagree­
ment, stress, and conflict; 
2. increasing interactions between leaders and citizens through such av­
enues as diplomacy and exchange programs; 
3. using sanctions and interventions to set limits that are realistically re­
quired and implementing these as early as possible and as firmly as 
needed (but these sanctions and interventions should not be used to iso­
late an adversary from the world community); 
4. tolerating the distortions others make of facts or situations and analyz­
ing these distortions for insights into the aims of others; 
5. negotiating differences by using accurate information and realistic as­
sessments of the other party, which includes avoiding personalizing or 
polarizing the other party's distortions (this includes fuller information 
about other groups and cultures); 
6. keeping a plan on the table towards which moderates can work without 
becoming impatient and regressive (so that the process can remain re­
flective); and 
7. offering respect and autonomy to other nations. 
As the world becomes more and more interdependent, these reflec­
tive strategies for dealing with conflict will become more and more es­
sential. The disrortions characteristic of existing methods of dealing 
with conflict will only create greater danger for the entire globe. More 
than ever we need to understand the nature of our new interdependency 
and the changes it necessitates in our behavior, perceptions, feelings, 
and thinking. 
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
THE NEED TO REVIEW OUR 
FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT 
INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS 
437 
Before we can consider what sorts of policies need to be adopted in or­
der to create reflective citizens capable of dealing with the challenges of 
interdependency, we first need to reassess our fundamental assumptions. 
Changing Assumptions About Power 
One of the first assumptions we need to come to terms with is how the 
dynamics of power have changed dramatically. In an interdependent 
world in which the smallest of splinter groups can wreak terrible havoc 
on the entire globe, power has become far more relative than it ever was 
before. Our enormous advantages in weapons systems and technology 
make it understandably difficult to accept this new reality. Why doesn't 
enormous military advantage still afford one a definitive advantage in 
power? But, as indicated earlier, when small groups can set off biological 
weapons in their own backyards that can engulf the globe, the interde­
pendency of shared dangers makes even overwhelming military advan­
tage much more relative. We may want to deny this fact because it is 
such a frightening and numbing prospect. Denial, however, can fuel the 
wish to continue to use intimidation as a major strategy. The problem is 
that intimidation breeds fear and contempt among those one is trying 
to intimidate, if not outright rage and hostility. Such feelings have new 
meaning in an interdependent world that includes shared dangers. 
It is not easy to shift from tendencies to use intimidation and main­
tain the illusion of absolute power. One of the hallmarks of power, how­
ever well intended its use, is its inherent tendency to maintain itself In 
short, it is hard to give it up. To be sure, power is frequently relinquished 
in family, community, and even national settings. Families relinquish 
power for the benefit of a new, more reflective organization as they learn 
to share decisionmaking with their late adolescent and young adult chil­
dren. Communities are able to develop flourishing centers that are run as 
cooperative enterprises. And there are many examples of nations that 
formed as a result of autonomous groups comprehending and advocat­
ing the greater good, relinquishing part of their individual powers to a 
national entity. 

438 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
But on the larger world stage, it is much harder to relinquish power, 
and not surprisingly so. It is easier to share power for a higher purpose 
with those you love, trust, or at least feel you know, or with whom you 
share common beliefs and principles. Sharing power is a much more 
difficult process when dealing with groups that are outside one's orbit of 
shared humanity and reality. In an interdependent world, however, all 
groups must share in decisionmaking. To make this possible, power 
must be used to support reflective institutions that enable collective 
decisionmaking. Investing in international bodies and relinquishing 
power after using it to create these reflective representative bodies will 
take time and will require greater respect for each others' national insti­
tutions than now exists. 
The principle underpinning this argument is not some utopian vision 
of international harmony, nor is it an attempt to inculcate classic liberal­
democratic ideals. This argument is grounded in an understanding of the 
changing dynamics of power and the nature of the practices we must em­
brace if we are to survive as a global community. For this same reason, we 
need to recognize the indirect ways we attempt to maintain powerّ For 
example, we need to recognize the shortsightedness of resorting to auto­
cratic tactics when implementing more advanced political ideals. One 
might argue that the means can justify the ends. But our developmental 
model suggests that, no matter how lofty the principles, autocratic pro­
cesses will lead to groups that cohere around polarized beliefs, or feared 
and aggrandized leaders, or other concrete images. In building more re­
flective societies, we have to look at the content we're espousing and the 
processes-that is, the means-we're using to promote these important 
ideas. For the means don't justifY the ends: The means define the ends. 
What sustains polarized and oversimplified perspectives? We're often 
unaware of the preconceived frames of reference we use to see the world. 
A frame of reference literally becomes a lens through which only certain 
patterns or shades are observed. The competitive lens is an example. 
Election debates illustrate this example. The media and the candidates 
are preoccupied with winning or losing the debate rather than explicat­
ing the issues. When the media augments this natural tendency with a 
headline indicating that this or that candidate won the debate rather 
than that the candidate did or did not fully explicate a complex issue, 
they are fostering the tendency to view the world through the compe­
titive lens. This reinforces an artificial reality. The public, already pre­
disposed to this lens, follows. It doesn't look for or demand enough 
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
439 
substance. As a consequence, politicians, the public, and the media re­
main preoccupied with winning or losing rather than with creating a 
long-term framework to resolve conflict. 
In resolving conflicts in an interdependent world, we're dealing with 
issues far more complex than simply the appearance of winning or los­
ing. Those nations and groups that have real power in military and eco­
nomic spheres are, and will be, perceived with a mixture of envy, 
suspiciousness, and anger, as well as respect and admiration. We need 
seriously to consider how mutual respect can be enhanced and suspi­
ciousness and anger lessened. 
Attempts at intimidation or destruction without offering hope and 
opportunities for collaboration will almost always move groups towards 
the side of the continuum that espouses fear and rage rather than re­
spect. Respect is born from firmness coupled with an understanding of 
the responsibility of power to work towards fair and reasonable long­
term solutions. This is not a utopian vision that ignores the reality of a 
harsh world populated by groups harboring many different beliefs and 
goals. Although it sounds utopian, ironically, it's a necessary reality in an 
interdependent world. 
The Global Group: The New Unit of Survival 
To resolve conflicts differently we need a new way of thinking about the 
social group and the survival of the group. A new way of thinking does 
not involve giving up our individual or group identity; rather it means 
acquiring the ability to operate at multiple levels of group identification. 
As we saw in the preceding chapter, it is the group, in its functions of 
security and its economies of scale, that permits the long-term rearing 
and education of the young and the creation of new technologies. 
The size of the group and the amount of diversity it needs to accom­
modate is in part based on the challenges surrounding it and what is 
necessary for survival and adaptation. In an interdependent world, our 
concept of the group must enlarge beyond previous concepts of a func­
tional group. The unit of survival in an interdependent world is the en­
tire globe. What does the global group require to function adaptively? It 
would need to embrace similar implicit rules that a family group, a 
community, or a tribal group embraces in guaranteeing the survival of 
the group and the individual. 

440 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
The larger and more diverse the group, however, the harder it is ro 
organize. To organize and maintain such a functional group, one that 
integrates many diverse elements, requires especially stable, secure, and 
reflective individuals and institutional processes. 
To be successful, the larger group identity needs to be an expression 
of individual self-interests. An example of this is the family group. Most 
individuals see their families as part of their own survival. As such, they 
equate their own interests with those of their families. In working to im­
prove themselves, they improve their families. Similarly, the large group 
and the global group can be seen as an expression of the individual sur­
vival based on the realities of survival. 
In other words, one's perception of the group dimensions necessary 
for survival will determine to what degree the group becomes an expres­
sion of individual self-interest. One can imagine different perceptions in 
different contexts. In a safe world with bountiful food and other basics, 
individuals and/or small groups may not find the need to congregate in 
larger groups. On the other hand, with hostile others nearby and/or 
food and shelter hard to come by, groups of a certain size may be essen­
tial for survival. In today's world, because of the degree of interdepend­
ency, we have argued that the unit of survival is the global group. 
Therefore, individuals will, one hopes, over time identify with other hu­
man beings across the globe the way they identify with their own indi­
vidualism and immediate families, communities, and national groups. 
One can picture a hierarchical relationship where individual self­
interest relates to the family, the community, the nation, and the global 
group. Each boundary, which is real and has its own integrity, also has a 
relationship with the next boundary, which provides another level of sur­
vival protection. For the large group to work, this hierarchical relationship 
must be strong at every level or boundary. Yet, it is expected that very dif­
ferent feelings will exist for one's family in comparison to one's nation 
and, in turn, for one's nation in comparison to the global group. While 
different, if there is true recognition of interdependency and a new unit of 
survival (the globe), we would expect a new ethic to emerge regarding 
others. In other words, individual self-interest is not to be given up. It's to 
be transformed into a hierarchical set of relationships where individual 
and collective needs are part of one integrated pattern. This will require 
highly reflective individuals who can attend to their unique individual 
and family patterns and the larger group patterns at the same time. 
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
THE MORALITY OF INTERDEPENDENCY: 
SUPPORTING A NEW ETH I C  OF 
SURVIVAL OR INCREASING THE 
LIKELI HOOD OF RAGE AN D DESTRUCTION 
441 
The global group will require a new morality consistent with changing 
global relationships. In an interdependent world, we all share each 
other's wish and need to survive. Respect for survival, however, cannot 
be limited to outlawing terrorism. As discussed, it must involve respect 
for the life and well-being of all members of the world, including those 
who are poor, hungry, or ill. If a new morality of survival is not applied 
to all peoples equally, those excluded and those who identify with the 
excluded may decide not to embrace the collective ideal of survival. 
They may support efforts to undermine it. In other words, in an inter­
dependent world, all human survival must be the goal of all groups and 
become part of a global effort. 
In this context, the failure of an interdependent partner to acknowl­
edge the importance of one's own existence may fuel rage and destructive 
action. This sense of disavowal had a very different meaning in a world 
where groups were relatively isolated from one another. When there 
weren't shared dangers, communications, or economies, peoples of one 
group didn't expect much from the peoples of another. In an interde­
pendent world, where cultures are intertwined and where it's nearly im­
possible to escape from the influence of "others," even if one wishes to, 
the feelings are quite different. Now, one's needs and very existence are 
being disavowed by another with whom one has a strong relationship­
whose movies and books are part of one's daily life, whose businesses are 
reaping profits in one's economy, and whose relative prosperity is being 
witnessed every day. 
Why should this closer, more intimate relationship among the 
world's peoples breed more rage and destructiveness? To understand this 
phenomenon, consider the metaphor of a family: How does the mem­
ber of a family whose basic needs are not attended to begin to feel? 
There are usually two feelings: enormous rage and enormous helpless­
ness, sometimes coupled with depression. These feelings can fuel the 
most destructive acts. The disavowal of another human being in an inti­
mate context is perhaps one of the strongest insults and humiliations 
human beings can suffer. 

442 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
In addition to the disavowal of the other's basic needs, the disregard 
of the other's culture, religion, or beliefs can also fuel outrage and de­
structive acts. The paradox is that the more interdependent the world, 
the greater the need to respect each peoples' unique needs and charac­
teristics while at the same time supporting a shared sense of humanity 
and reality through global reflective processes and institutions. 
The morality of interdependency can be characterized by five basic 
principles: 
1 .  The world is interdependent by the nature of its shared dangers as well 
as its shared economies and communications. 
2. Interdependency alters the expectations and the emotional reactions of 
individuals and groups to one another. 
3. In an interdependent world, one of the largest insults and humiliations 
an individual, community, or culture can suffer is the lack of acknowl­
edgment of its very existence (in terms of basic survival needs). 
4. Such disavowal breeds rage and hopelessness and increases the likeli­
hood of destructive acts and the support of destructive acts by even 
moderate groups. 
5. A new ethic and morality for an interdependent world must be based on 
the premise that the viability of the world-that is, its health, security, 
and very survival-is measured by how well it tends to the needs of its 
weakest members. This ethic may establish a more difficult standard 
than is apparent. Helping others cannot be based on handouts or even 
the most enlightened forms of altruism. Rather, it must stem from the 
basic realization of the interdependency of all individuals and groups to 
share in the survival of the world and each of its inhabitants. In addi­
tion, this new ethic must go beyond dealing with poverty and enhanc­
ing the survival of individuals and groups. It must also provide 
opportunities for individuals and groups to grow economically and so­
cially. This includes stable families and communities, educational op­
portunities, and economic opportunities. 
Working together on behalf of survival will, in the short run, cer­
tainly not immediately reduce all the reasons for conflict or terrorist 
activity. Different belief systems, a lack of economic growth and oppor­
tunities for meaningful personal and family improvement and careers, 
and poverty all need to be considered. Even if these factors are dealt

with, challenges will obviously still exist. If, over time, however, a new 
morality of interdependency can support the moderate elements in 
most groups, extremists will have a harder and harder time finding sup­
port and the moderates will be relatively better able to maintain safety 
and security. In short, the greater the interdependency, the greater the 
needed collaboration. There must also, however, be recognition that 
the equilibrium between thoughtful collective action on behalf of safety 
and security and global danger is a precarious one. 
BUILDING THE CITIZENS O F  THE FUTURE 
Currently, much of the world is still organized around simpler types of 
group structures in which power is concentrated in the hands of one in­
dividual or a small ruling elite. Such power structures seem to be a nat­
ural feature, not just of human, but indeed, of primate social groups. 
We saw in Part II how nonhuman primate societies are invariably dom­
inated by a physically dominating figure, an alpha male whose power is 
further buttressed by a small number of slightly less powerful allies. His 
control over the group only subsides when he can no longer fend off the 
physical challenge of a powerful rival. But the social structure of the 
group remains the same during such transitions; only the alpha himself 
changes, and perhaps his allies. Interestingly, a similar pattern can be 
observed in children's "playground politics," when the most competent 
kid at the activity at hand assumes the role of the leader who oversees a 
rigid hierarchical structure; for as long as he remains the strongest, he 
will be the one who decides who gets to play where or on which team.! 
As we saw in Chapter 14, this kind of simple power hierarchy was the 
mainstay of early human communities and civilizations, and still re­
mains characteristic of many tribal cultures that are ruled over by a 
powerful chief or cadre. Interestingly, such a form of social organization 
is also widely seen in the business world, particularly in the early days of 
large companies that are built up and run by a powerful dominating fig­
ure. As can be clearly seen in the business example, in certain conditions 
such a structure is highly effective insofar as it provides for rapid and 
centralized decisionmaking. Some of the most powerful corporations in 
America today were originally built up by charismatic figures that in­
spired a workforce with their vision and work ethic. But when these 

444 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
highly successful national companies started to make the transition to 
multinationals, the old style of autocratic governance proved to be 
much less adaptive; these companies then had to undergo the difficult 
adjustments involved in developing the kind of diffused decision­
making structure that is needed to deal with the exigencies of running 
an international conglomerate. 
We are faced with a very similar issue today on the political front: the 
problem of whether the simpler kinds of tribal structures that are very 
effective for certain kinds of social or economic conditions, such as 
when groups are highly homogenous, are sufficiently adaptive to deal 
with the challenges of global interdependency. If, as we have argued 
above, we need to develop more reflective kinds of structures to deal 
with the challenges of interdependency, then we need to consider how 
we can enable a significant proportion of the populace to develop . the 
sorts of reflective capacities that are necessary to sustain the kinds of in­
stitutions and decisionmaking processes that are necessary to deal with 
the exigencies of global interdependency. 
For more basic kinds of social structures, the individual only need be 
capable of relating to the other members of the group by cohering 
around some concrete dimension: the charismatic leader, a dominant 
belief But to support and participate in much more reflective types of 
group structure, including groups that cohere around abstract principles 
like justice or equality, the individual must be able to operate at a reflec­
tive level that permits thinking off an internal sense of self and an inter­
nal standard. As we described in Chapter 2, this involves the ability to 
operate in two frames of reference at the same time, one involving an 
awareness of one's own inner sense of self and the evolving standards or 
ideals associated with that. The other frame of reference involves one's 
immediate moment-to-moment experiences, which are compared to 
and judged or interpreted according to one's internal sense of self and 
standards. For example, in order to invest in a concept such as justice 
and an institutional court system that supports the concept of justice, 
one must be able to have developed an internal sense of self and stan­
dards that can resonate with these abstract concepts and institutions. 
In other words, to invest in institutions-the consent of the gov­
erned, according to Jefferson-requires a sophisticated level of reflective 
thinking that's considerably more complex than simply believing in a 
strong leader or a rigid set of principles. 
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
445 
What is often not clear to students of group behavior is the degree to 
which this level of reflective thinking or the departure from reflective 
thinking is an indication not just of the intellectual processes used by 
the individual or group but of their emotional processes. Reflective 
thinking of the type we have been describing requires well-developed 
forms of empathy (being able to project oneself into another person's 
shoes and understand a wide range of feelings and views without dis­
torting them), coupled with the ability for being realistic and having a 
firm assessment of reality. The ability to hold on to reality in the face of 
intense feelings and complex circumstances and to be able to balance re­
alistic appraisals with empathetic understanding is a complex emotional 
and intellectual task. It is especially difficult for groups and individuals 
to carry out this task when under extreme stress and/or influenced by 
strong emotions. When done well, however, these thinking processes 
seamlessly harness and integrate our emotional and cognitive capacities. 
But this integrated development needs to reach a level where individuals 
can think off an internal standard, and a sense of self, even when there 
are strong emotions, if the group is to have any chance of supporting 
concepts such as justice and equality or other elements of a representa­
tive government. Although one may argue from a purely theoretical 
point of view about the value of reflective institutions and processes ver­
sus less reflective ones in terms of a group's coherence and ability to 
carry out fundamental goals, it is clear that in an interdependent world 
the need for high-level reflective institutions to support collective prob­
lem solving is highly adaptive. 
From such a perspective, we have just as strong a vested interest in the 
emotional well-being of children in distant parts of the globe as we have 
in the emotional well-being of our own children and the children of our 
neighborhoods. Consider, for example, the reports that Palestinian chil­
dren as young as eight are expressing a keen desire for martyrdom. This 
development has been seized upon as proof that pleas for a negotiated 
settlement of the Middle East conflict are delusional because such young 
children are being indoctrinated with a terrorist mindset. But, of course, 
an eight-year-old child is incapable of grasping the concept of martyr­
dom. In fact, the studies by Palestinian psychologists on which these re­
POrts are based2 point to a very different phenomenon that needs to be 
addressed. Some of the children in question demonstrate alarmingly 
high levels of distress. In other words, the evidence suggests that some of 

446 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
these children may already be potentially suicidal and that all they need 
is a pretext to trigger their self-destructive inclinations. 
Similar reports are coming in from all over the world: stories of young 
children who, after being abducted and trained in guerrilla armies, take 
part in heinous genocidal acts without a trace of remorse; or children 
raised in a climate of violence who then participate enthusiastically in 
acts of sectarian violence. In an interdependent world, we need to take 
such reports as seriously as if they were happening in our own backyard. 
Indeed, we are seeing alarmingly high rates of difficulties in our own 
backyard as well. For example, from 1950 through 1990, the rate of sui­
cide for persons fifteen to twenty-four years of age increased from 4.5 to 
13.5 per 100,000 in the United States.3 With such a contagion of adoles­
cent distress spreading around the world, it is clear that urgent action 
must be taken if the next generation is to develop into the sort of reflec­
tive society that will be capable of supporting the kinds of institutions 
and decisionmaking processes that are necessary to deal with the exigen­
cies of global interdependency. 
THE PATHWAY TO EMPATHY, 
REFLECTIVENESS, AND INTERDEPENDENCY 
As can be seen, many new policies need to be explored. These policies, 
however, must not only reduce distress in children and families, but fa­
cilitate needed coping skills, especially for empathy and reflective think­
ing. Our recent understanding of the steps leading to high levels of 
reflection and empathy suggests the types of new policies that are 
needed for families and communities. Let's take a look at the steps lead­
ing to higher and higher levels of empathy and reflective thinking and 
explore the types of family patterns and educational practices that will 
support this progression. 
To begin with, children must learn .to engage emotionally with "an­
other. "This is the basis for a shared sense of humanity. It is promoted by 
consistent, nurturing care from loving caregivers who will be part of the 
child's life for years to come. It is undermined by full-time care from a 
series of caregivers and by caregivers having to care for too many babies 
(as happens in many busy daycare centers). It is also undermined by 
stressed caregivers and/or families, inadequate or inappropriate caregiv-
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
447 
ing, and/or exposure to dysregulating environments or toxic substances 
that affect the central nervous system. 
Next, the child must learn to interact and to signal with emotions and 
broaden their emotional range. This is the basis for being aware of the in­
tentions and feelings of "another." It is promoted by nurturing interac­
tions and lots of emotional exchanges: long, emotional dialogues involving 
such basic emotional themes of life as love, anger, and curiosity. It is un­
dermined by insufficient interactions, the misreading of a baby's emo­
tional signals, or interactions that are too intense, constricted, or short. 
Following this, the child must learn to care for, protect, share with, and 
behave altruistically toward another. This is the basis for cooperation. It is 
promoted by opportunities for long, playful, preverbal interactions and 
emotional dialogues with caregivers and peers, as well as supportive, 
firm limits. The limits should use lots of communicative gestures that 
teach a child to cope with frustration and learn patience and respect for 
others. It is undermined by insufficient interactive opportunities and 
overly punitive or inconsistent limits. 
Next the child must learn to broaden the range of "others" with whom 
one can relate, share, and respect. This is the basis for broadening one's 
future empathetic range and identifications. It is promoted by play and 
interactive opportunities with children from different cultural and eth­
nic backgrounds. These interactions need to occur, however, as part of 
one-on-one or very small group play opportunities in a context of ongo­
ing nurturing care with one or a few consistent caregivers (who provide 
a great deal of security). It is undermined by isolation, very busy child 
care settings that keep children in large groups (more than three or four 
children with a caregiver), or dysregulating environments. 
After this, the child must share emotions and ideas with others. This is 
the basis for feeling a part of another person's feelings and ideas, or inner 
world. It is promoted by shared pretend play with caregivers and peers 
and lots of verbal or pictorial "discussions" with others, and by bringing 
in the ideas and customs, including dress, music, games, and activities, of 
children from other cultures. It is undermined when children play 
mostly alone, engage only in action-oriented rather than imaginative ac­
tivities, and encounter overly rigid child care attitudes and practices. 
Sharing emotions and ideas enables the child to take the next step: 
that of seeing the world from another's perspective. This is the basis for 
identifYing with someone else (putting oneself in someone else's shoes). 

448 
T H E  F I RS T  I D EA 
It is promoted by challenging children to connect ideas together logi­
cally through opinion-oriented conversations and logical pretend dra­
mas with others. It is also promoted by setting firm but gentle limits on 
aggression while promoting its verbal or imaginative expression and un­
derstanding. It is promoted by teaching the value of respect and concern 
for others with actions (helping others, sharing in chores), as well as 
words. It is supported by relationships with peers from different cultures 
and opportunities to expand on the ideas and customs of others in play, 
stories, songs, and activities. This capacity is undermined by factual and 
memory-based dialogue, self-centered types of experiences, and narrow, 
rigid child care practices. 
A child is now in a position to understand the needs and wishes of oth­
ers. This is the basis for understanding that others may have different 
needs and feelings than we do and the reasons for these differences, It is 
promoted by logical discussions that look at the multiple reasons for 
events or feelings; compare people, objects, or feelings (different friends 
or foods); and explore the degrees to which one feels or believes a cer­
tain way ("I like Sarah much better than Allison because she is much 
nicer when I'm upset"). It is also promoted by the experience of being 
empathized with when angry, competitive, needy, or sad. It is also pro­
moted by real friendships with children from other cultures. (These can 
be promoted through increased diversity in schools and neighborhoods, 
as well as through relationships that result from communication and ex­
change programs with "brother" and "sister" communities and schools 
in other parts of the world.) It is also promoted by learning about other 
cultures and experiences with "others" that promote friendship, respect, 
and an understanding of fundamental similarities as well as differences. 
It is undermined by interactions that promote action over reasoning 
and polarized thinking over reflection, as well as punitive school or fam­
ily interactions. 
A child now begins to develop reflective empathy: experiencing how an­
other person feels and comparing it to one's own feelings. This is the basis 
for emotionally understanding the feelings of others and reasoning 
about the feelings of others in relationship to one's own personal experi­
ences. It is promoted by experiences that lead to a sense of self, comfort 
with a broad range of feelings, and the capacity to construct internal 
standards. It is also promoted by experiences and friendships with a 
range of "others" that challenge stereotyped views, stretch one's emo­
tional range, and promote reflective thinking. It is further promoted by 
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
449 
factual knowledge of other cultures through broad-based school pro­
grams and personal experience of other cultures through school and 
community diversity and special international programs. This capacity 
is undermined by experiences that lead to a fragmented sense of self, 
weak internal standards, impulsive or polarized thinking, and comfort 
with only a narrow range of emotions. 
Finally, the individual can progress from reflective empathy to interde­
pendency. This is the basis for increasing reflective empathy to include 
broader and broader identifications with others from around the globe. 
It is promoted by experiences that increase knowledge of the cultural, 
social, historical, geographical, and economic dimensions of other peo­
ples, coupled with increasing interaction with other peoples in a variety 
of contexts. These contexts may include work and service programs in 
other cultures, integrated schools, communities, community centers, 
and cross-cultural work and exchange programs. It is also promoted by 
the mastery of the developmental challenges during adolescence and 
adulthood that leads to higher and higher levels of reflective thinking. It 
is undermined by limited knowledge and experiences of other peoples, 
weak reflective thinking capacities, and poor mastery of the stages of 
adolescence and adulthood. 
The kinds of programs that we are outlining here have, of course, 
been the subject of lively political debate in recent years. What has been 
missing in these deliberations, however, is a larger purpose to determine 
the direction in which we should be moving. Our developmental model 
of evolution provides us not only with just such a goal but also with a 
psychological framework for considering the kinds of family and educa­
tional practices necessary to create a reflective citizenry and the reflective 
institutions that can rise to the challenge of global interdependency. 
THE ROAD TO DEMOCRACY-PAVED 
WIT H  AGGRESSION AND RESENTMENT? 
The levels of social groups described earlier can help us understand the 
challenges faced in trying to facilitate democratic forms of government. 
Nation building can be successful only if the underlying social and psy­
chological needs for a dictatorial regime are understood and the multiple 
steps required for democracy are anticipated. It is often taken for granted 
that dictatorships are somehow imposed on a populace, generally against 

450 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
their will, and then kept in power through the agencies of a secret police 
force. But groups with warring factions often lend their tacit if not out­
right support to a dictatorial regime in their efforts to contain emergent 
hostilities. Initially, such groups often do not have the collaborative rela­
tionship, trust, and reflective processes that are needed to invest in shared 
democratic practices and institutions. 
Consider two situations. In the first, a nation is made up of a cohesive 
social and cultural group where individuals have some degree of trust in 
one another and a history of democratic-type institutions. When such a 
group is liberated from a dictatorial regime, it can come together to sup­
port democratic reforms readily, as was observed in post-Communist 
Poland. 
In the second, a group has a long history of many separate factions. 
Each faction distrusts the others, and they all harbor polarized views 
about each other. What happens when this type of group is freed from a 
dictatorial regime? To answer this question, we first must look at why 
a group would embrace or tolerate a dictatorial regime in the first place. 
As discussed earlier, social groups have basic needs, including safety, 
cohesion, implicit survival-based communication, shared symbols, and a 
relatively shared sense of reality and humanity. Different social and polit­
ical groups, however, have different ways of coming together to meet 
these basic needs. Social groups that are chaotic and fragmented and in­
vested in polarized beliefs meet their basic needs in ways that are differ­
ent from those of social groups that are relatively integrated and share a 
sense of reality and humanity. 
For example, the fragmented and/or polarized social organizations of­
ten can come together only by adhering to a powerful feared leader or 
set of polarized beliefs or images. In a sense, the group feels that security 
is attainable only through a feared leader because no other structure 
could contain the imminent hostility and danger from the different fac­
tions. Paradoxically, fear of hostility is used to contain hostility and pro­
vide security for the group. 
The dictatorial regime, ironically, may also provide a familiar social 
structure. Dictatorial regimes tend to operate at a level of group function­
ing dominated by "all-or-nothing" thinking, concrete rules, extreme pun­
ishments, and little tolerance for flexible reflective thinking that would 
challenge an authoritative structure. 
Warring factions also tend to operate with "all-or-nothing" thinking 
("The other factions are all bad"). and rule by severe authority figures. 
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
451 
Therefore, the polarized thinking that characterizes a dictatorial regime 
feels familiar. In contrast, reflective thinking embodied in representative 
forms of government and concepts such as justice, equality, debate, and 
compromise feel alien. 
What is likely to occur when groups that have been fragmented or po­
larized into different warring factions are suddenly freed from the seem­
ing tyranny of a dictator? Will they be appreciative? Will they feel a sense 
of security from a potential governing process that seems alien to their 
basic needs? Or will they experience a collective anxiety and uncertainty 
because the proposed new governing structure, although supporting in­
dividual freedoms, does not provide an immediate sense of protection 
against factional hostilities or a familiar social organization? Not surpris­
ingly in such a circumstance, we can expect certain reactions: frank hos­
tility by those with very different objectives; anxiety, fear, and resentment 
by those for whom a new structure does not provide the security and co­
hesion of the former one; and a lack of appreciation by those who do not 
intuitively embrace the liberating power as representing goals that are fa­
miliar and attainable. 
The road towards democracy, therefore, often involves a considerable 
period of time and a number of steps. The different subgroups have to 
meet the challenge of beginning to work together and resolve underly­
ing hostilities. They have to trust each other enough to experience some 
relative degree of a shared sense of reality and humanity and invest 
in some type of representative governing structure. The groups have to 
develop the psychological and social capacities to embrace reflective in­
tegrated compromises rather than polarized beliefs. Achieving the psy­
chological level where differences are evaluated and debated is a long 
and arduous task. 
What policies will promote these processes? In addition to estab­
lished policies such as preparing for the long haul; establishing safety, 
security, and basic necessities; investing in schools and health care; and 
working with moderates toward self-governance, there are additional 
objectives. One is to anticipate the hostile reactions described earlier. 
Another is to realize that to cope with the anxiety of losing the relative 
security of a dictatorial regime, the liberated group needs a greater sense 
of safety than might be anticipated. Without this first step of "safety," 
there will be an enormous temptation to return to autocratic practices. 
In addition, the investment in human capital and family and edu-' 
cational programs to enhance the capacities of future generations for 

452 
T H E  F I R S T  I D E A  
reflective thinking, collaboration, and empathy will have to be far 
greater than is usually planned. 
As the United States was forming, Thomas Jefferson said that demo­
cratic processes can be only as strong as the capacity of the governed to 
invest in these processes. To invest in abstract democratic principles, 
however, requires high levels of personal and group functioning. 
BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE: 
FAM I LY AND INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES 
To help new generations become reflective and empathic at levels that 
support interdependency, we need to explore new national and interna­
tional policies. Creating the conditions for healthy human development 
and adaptive social organization requires enlightened policies. What are 
the societal policies and practices needed to promote the development 
of individuals and groups capable of coping with growing global inter­
dependency? 
In formulating these policies, it is important to realize that currently 
we are shepherding a delicate evolutionary process of group formation. 
Therefore, practical decisions must always take into account the long­
term needs of the global group. 
To support adaptive interdependency in both the short and the long 
term, we have to invest in a new type of capital, namely, human capital. 
Interestingly, many of the skills required for a successful labor force are 
the same ones required for supporting the infrastructures of complex 
adaptive social organizations and a shared sense of humanity and reality. 
But our developmental model of group development prompts us ro 
consider whether we should be considering a whole host of programs 
geared towards promoting the psychology of interdependency. 
To begin with, should we institute a public education campaign on the 
nature of global interdependency and the changes it means for individu­
als and groups? 
We certainly need to pursue policies that will promote the development 
o/safe and caring communities. Adaptive social organizations and political 
structures depend on our capacities for sustained relationships, compre­
hending our own and other's emotions, engaging in reflective thinking 
(even in the face of intense feelings), and supporting institutions that can 
interpret reality and mediate and resolve conflicts. As is well known (but 
Toward a Psychology of Global Interdependency 
453 
often overlooked), these critical capacities grow from nurturing human 
relationships between children and their caregivers, and can occur only 
in stable, secure families who live in safe, well-organized communities. 
This means that greater emphasis and, where necessary, appropriate 
types of support must be given to human development, families, and 
communities. The problem is, it may take many generations of signifi­
cantly enhanced child care, family functioning, and social policies to 
reach these goals. How, then, do we design and implement policies that 
employ the necessary long-term perspective? 
On still a more basic level, do we need to institute policies to support 
safety and protection? The problem here is that individuals or nations 
who are hungry, ill, in constant danger, or at immediate risk can hardly 
be expected to invest emotionally in others or the collective processes 
that sustain large groups. Therefore, one of the most basic principles in a 
psychology of interdependency should be that of making sure that every 
child and every family on the globe have the basics of physical protec­
tion and care. This includes adequate food and shelter, healthy water 
supplies, appropriate medical care, and safe environments. We have to 
be as concerned for a child in Africa who is afflicted with AIDS, or who 
lives in poverty, or who is suffering from neglect, abuse, or anxiety, as we 
would be for a child in our own extended family or neighborhood; for 
we cannot be at the highest level of personal, intrapsychic development 
if we turn a blind eye to impoverished child-rearing conditions in other 
parts of the world. 
It also seems vital that we address the nature of educational policies 
from the perspective of global interdependency. To be sure, educational 
policies, like culture and the media, have long been regarded as the pri­
vate preserve of autonomous nation states. But isn't it imperative that we 
strengthen international organizations and exchange programs that culti­
vate thinking skills and that look at issues from a broad geopolitical per­
spective? To foster a more shared sense of a common humanity, that is, a 
global identification where the primary unit is the global group rather 
than the individual, family, community, or national group (although 
these will continue to exist as foundations), isn't it critical that we help 
children see events from multiple contexts and frames of reference? In­
deed, the foregoing argument suggests that it is imperative we develop 
educational policies that support reflective thinking skills. In an inter­
dependent world, "intellectual isolation" and rote rather than reflective 
learning would pose a risk to future collaboration and understanding. As 

454 
T H E  F I RST I D EA 
part of a thinking approach to literacy, educational programs will need to 
help children further understand who they are as human beings and the 
psychological, social, cultural, and governmental processes that explain 
their behavior. 
One of the key issues raised by our developmental model is how chil­
dren deal with cultural and/or religious experiences. At their personal 
core, children will require a very strong grounding in their immediate 
cultural and/or religious values. This core will need to be strong enough 
to sustain and support cultural and/or religious values that foster a sense 
of shared humanity and reality as well as an ethic of survival that is 
shared with other peoples of the world. Because a shared sense of hu­
manity is only learned through personal experience with a range of 
"others," should we not be pursuing a number of programs that will fos­
ter this broader ethic? 
It goes without saying, perhaps, that we need to recognize the over­
whelming importance of providing economic opportunities to all 
groups. In an interdependent world, having the motivation and oppor­
tunity to succeed fuels all the initiatives we have been describing. What 
is not always appreciated, however, is how related these goals are. With 
growing technologies, there is a general consensus that the ability to 
take advantage of economic opportunities will depend more and more 
on being a "reflective" individual who can work with others as well as 
solve new challenges. Nations without large numbers of logical, reflec­
tive individuals who can learn and master new challenges generally do 
not progress economically in the same way as nations with large num­
bers of individuals who have these capacities. Therefore, we need to 
consider initiatives in which economic opportunities are coupled with 
an infrastructure of nurturing families, healthy environments, safe com­
munities, and cross-cultural, thinking-based, educational initiatives. 
But the heart of a family and children's program must be those child­
caregiver interactions, as described in the previous section, that lead to 
the types of personal characteristics that can support the higher level of 
reflection needed to meet the challenges of interdependency. 
CON CLUSION 
In an interdependent world, the unit of survival is no longer the indi­
vidual or even the small group, but the global group. Therefore, self-

interest and the large group interests are the same. But the dynamics of 
groups and individuals are such that groups and individuals operate at a 
number oflevels ranging from fragmented patterns and polarized think­
ing ("us" versus "them") to cohesive reflective thinking where problem 
solving and a truly shared sense of humanity and reality is possible at 
the individual, group, and institutional level. Understanding how 
groups meet their developmental needs for safety and security, cohesion, 
communication, and the creation of stable, reflective institutional pro­
cesses to solve problems and adapt to the future can enable us to move 
toward these more adaptive organizations. In an interdependent world 
that includes weapons of mass destruction, only shared reflective insti­
tutions can enable collective action to support safety and security. This 
will require an unprecedented investment in individuals, families, and 
communities around the globe; that is, it will require human capital. It 
will also require changes in the assumptions that guide economic, polit­
ical, and military goals. For example, to embrace the global group and 
unite the world, individuals will need to broaden their identifications to 
include not only their own families, cultures, or religions but also "oth­
ers" across the globe who subscribe to different beliefs and practices.

A new morality of interdependency will need to be defined by how 
well the global community deals with its weakest or neediest members. 
Therefore, the marginal value of the world's weakest members will define 
the new morality. However, helping others with the basics of survival 
cannot be based on the notion of "handouts," or even of enlightened al­
truism. The morality of interdependency must be based on a fundamen­
tal commitment and responsibility to work for shared survival. 
Interdependency can breed either destructive or constructive patterns. 
Destructive patterns are likely to the degree that the psychological pro­
cesses that come into play in an interdependent world are ignored, and 
rage, impulsivity, and polarized thinking are fomented. Constructive 
patterns are likely to the degree that a shared sense of humanity and real­
ity is constructed through the formation of global identifications, reflec­
tive institutions, and a true morality of interdependency. 
The support and maintenance of reflective individuals, processes, and 
institutions that contribute to a shared sense of reality and humanity 
depend on a series of critical developmental processes that characterize 
individuals and groups, as outlined earlier. These developmental pro­
cesses require significant investments in present and future "human cap­
ital," and educational, political, and economic initiatives.

are contributing to the revisions of the Bayley Developmental Scales for Infants and 
Young Children. A functional emotional developmental questionnaire that characterizes 
the early capacities has been studied as part of the Bayley Scales package and will be avail­
able, both as an independent assessment of emotional functioning and as part of the new 
Bayley kit. The results of field studies, including studies that demonstrate the validity of 
the age prediction and that show that the functional emotional developmental capacities 
can discriminate between healthy children and children with developmental and emo­
tional challenges, are available on request from the author and will soon be published.

14. Chomsky argued that the ability to understand and produce infinitely many sen­
tences that one has never heard before can only be explained if the "deep" structure of 
language is a generative system, in the mathematical sense that, like the axioms in an ax­
iomatic system, a limited number of basic "principles" generate infinitely many "values" 
(i.e., sentences). See Chomsky 1 966.

20. Such a mechanist paradigm was clearly needed to explain how we acquire our 
higher capacities. The problem was, however, that AI scientists were notoriously silent on 
developmental questions. But Chomsky's vision of a "language gene" offered a model for 
how a child acquires his higher capacities "automatically, uncomciously, and without efort"; 
that is, like a computer processing language. And the reasoning behind this thesis was, 
first, that just as a computer program cannot figure out language patterns from scratch 
but needs certain fundamental processing "heuristics," so, too, a child must have what 
Chomsky referred to as the "built-in structure of an information-processing (hypothesis­
forming) system" that enables him "to arrive at the grammar of a language from the avail­
able data in the available time" (Chomsky 1959); second, that children actually know 
things about language that they could not possibly have learned; third, that all known 
languages have the same abstract structure, and that all children go through the same 
maturational sequence when acquiring language; and finally, that children acquire lan­
guage without explicit instruction from their caregivers, and, indeed, despite the flagrant 
language mistakes that they are exposed to from birth. Hence, the capacity to speak must 
be innate in the sense that the child is born with a genetic program-what Chomsky 
called Universal Grammar-that controls the process of language acquisition.

have become more aware of a kind of electricity that goes on between people. I have ob­
served that when several people are together and having a good time, their speech and 
laughter follow a rhythm. They will all laugh together and then talk quietly until the 
next laughing cycle. I have always had a hard time fitting in with this rhythm, and I usu­
ally interrupt conversations without realizing my mistake. The problem is that I can't fol­
low the rhythm" (Grandin 1 960).

opment include the following: Shonkoff and Phillips 2000; Sameroff et al. 1 986; 
Sameroff et al. 1 993; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network 1 998, 1 999, 2000a, 
2000b, 2003; Greenspan et al. (unpublished work); Vandell and Wolfe 2000; Peisner­
Feinberg et al. 1 999. 
In addition, it is important to note that, historically, emotions or affects have been 
viewed in various ways: as outlets for extreme passion, as physiologic reactions, as subjec­
tive states of feeling, as interpersonal social cues (Campos, Campos, and Barrett 1 989; 
Greenspan 1 979, 1 997; Young 1 943). Beginning nearly six decades ago, the importance 
of emotions for aspects of learning was documented by psychoanalytic observers such as 
Rene Spitz and John Bowlby, who described the effects of emotional deprivation, and 
Heinz Hartmann and David Rappaport, who explored clinical and theoretical relation­
ships (Bowlby 1 95 1 ;  Hartmann 1 939; Rappaport 1 960; Spitz 1 945). Sibylle Escalona 
(1968) and Lois Murphy (1974) further explored affective development and described 
individual differences in infants and their relationship to psychopathology. Building on 
this work, the pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton systematized the observation of the infant's 
social and emotional repertoire (Brazelton and Cramer 1990). 
Neuroscience research has further documented the importance of the environment 
and "experiences" for the development of the central nervous system and learning. Dur­
ing the formative years there is a sensitive interaction between genetic proclivities and 
environmental experience. Experience appears to adapt the infant's biology to his or her

ever, not all experiences are the same. As described in the prior section, children seem to 
require certain types of experiences involving a series of specific types of emotional inter­
actions geared to their particular developmental needs. For example, as we will shortly 
explore, in the early months of life, babies require soothing, regulating synchronous in­
teractions. They can be observed to move their arms and legs in rhythm to their mothers' 
voices (Condon 1975; Condon and Sander 1974). These types of interactions enable 
them to begin integrating what they hear and see (Spelke 1 976). By four to five months, 
one can readily observe synchronous movement in rhythm with the mother's affective 
communication via her voice, facial expressions, or body movements. As development 
proceeds, reciprocal gestural, vocal, and verbal communication generally occurs in an in­
teractive rhythm (Greenspan, Jacokes, and Cassily 2003; NICHD Early Child Care Re­

24. One of Levi-Strauss's famous examples of such a universal structural pattern is his 
explanation of family systems. The essential drive behind marriage is said to be to estab­
lish interdependence between biological units. These rules express a basic human refusal 
Notes 
469 
to acknowledge the family as an exclusive or isolated reality. All systems, no matter how 
complicated they might be (e.g., by distinctions of terminology, prohibitions, prescrip­
tions, or preferences, are no more than a process for dividing families into rival or allied 
camps who can and must take part in marriage. Regardless of the society studied, the 
family construct is grounded in several invariable properties: The family originates in 
marriage. It includes a husband, wife, and children born from their union, forming a nu­
cleus around which other relatives gather. The members of the family are united among 
themselves by legal bonds. Rights and obligations are of an economic, religious, or some 
other nature. Incestuous marriages are prohibited.

12. An interesting speculation based on this model relates to the relative roles of men 
and women in the transformation leading to more reflective ways of thinking. There has 
been a striking tendency in the history of science to treat the growth of science as prima­
rily a male phenomenon. Indeed, there is even a widespread assumption that history re­
veals that, in general, women were not provided with the opportunity to develop fully 
their creative and logical faculties. But as we consider the types of emotional interactions 
that lead to critical thinking and problem-solving in scientific discoveries, which we 

470 
Notes 
described in Chapter 2, it is clear that mothers or other female caregivers were often pro­
viding these formative learning interactions. To accomplish this task, the caregivers must 
themselves have mastered these critical stages and have embraced these varying capacities 
and attitudes. We might speculate that through their vital role as caregivers, they were 
the hidden engines behind the great cultural and scientific revolutions occurring at key 
junctures in history. In fact, now that men and women are beginning to share the more 
public roles as leading scientists, business people, and so forth, we may be facing a crisis, 
in some families at least, in which this role involving formative caregiving is being left to 
others who lack adequate training or the intimacy of a loving relationship with the child 
that is necessary to develop these critical thinking and problem-solving capacities.

portions of the Hebrew Books of Samuel and Kings. The first Egyptian writer of histOry 
is Manetho (third century B.C.), on whose king lists, preserved in Diodorus, all our 
Pharaonic chronology depends. In the third century, there were an increasing number of 
historical writers in Egypt, including some on Jewish history. Berossus, who is contem­
porary with Manetho, wrote a history of Babylon, which is lost, but seems to have 
moved seamlessly from mythological times to historical chronicle. We are deeply in­
debted to Richard Stoneman for this information.
