Abstract
We study shapes of planar arcs and closed contours modeled on elastic curves obtained by
bending, stretching or compressing line segments non-uniformly along their extensions. Shapes
are represented as elements of a quotient space of curves obtained by identifying those that
diﬀer by shape-preserving transformations. The elastic properties of the curves are encoded
in Riemannian metrics on these spaces. Geodesics in shape spaces are used to quantify shape
divergence and to develop morphing techniques.
The shape spaces and metrics constructed
are novel and oﬀer an environment for the study of shape statistics. Elasticity leads to shape
correspondences and deformations that are more natural and intuitive than those obtained in
several existing models. Applications of shape geodesics to the deﬁnition and calculation of
mean shapes and to the development of shape clustering techniques are also investigated.
Keywords. Planar shapes, shape geodesics, mean shape, shape analysis, clustering shapes.

Introduction
Shapes and textures associated with a distribution of pixel values are two key elements in under-
standing the way an image is perceived. Many generative models attempt to capture the beautifully
intricate, yet very natural, interaction between these somewhat independent components of images.
Thus, the development of independent models of shapes and textures and the fusion of these to
model images are natural problems in computer vision. This paper introduces a novel representation
of plane shapes as curves obtained by stretching, compressing and bending elastic straight-line seg-
ments. Using basic techniques from diﬀerential geometry, shape metrics and morphing techniques
are developed to model energy-eﬃcient deformations of shapes taking elasticity into account. As
1

discussed in more detail below, the proposed shape model leads to shape correspondences and de-
formations that are more natural and intuitive than those obtained in many existing models making
it better suited for many problems in computer vision.
The quantitative study of shapes dates back to the work of D’Arcy Thompson in the ﬁrst half
of the 20th century [19]. Research in the area has gained new impetus in recent years due to a
large inﬂow of new ideas from areas such as computer vision and medical imaging. Applications
of algorithmic shape analysis include detection and recognition of objects in images and videos,
algorithmic analysis of MRI scans, automated interpretation of imaged scenes, and morphometric
studies of insects and ﬁsh. The seminal works of Bookstein [2] and Kendall [8] represent inﬂuential
contributions to the modern theory of shapes with the introduction of methods and techniques
derived from diﬀerential geometry. In their work, shapes are represented by collections of expert
landmark points; identifying sets of landmarks that diﬀer by shape-preserving transformations,
a quotient shape space is obtained whose geometry reﬂects properties of shapes.
For example,
geodesic distance is used to quantify shape divergence and as a basic tool for statistical shape
analysis. Despite diﬃculties encountered in the selection of landmarks and the dependence of the
resulting analysis of shapes on choices made, this approach has been used successfully in numerous
applications.
Of particular historical relevance is the fact that Kendall’s shape manifolds have
provided an environment for the development of a statistical theory of shapes via mean shapes and
tangent-space probability models [10, 5]. The techniques extend to the analysis of data in more
general Riemannian manifolds and have been used in various diﬀerent contexts. A similar approach,
known as active shape model, uses principal component analysis on landmark representations to
model shape variations. Despite its simplicity and ease of use, the fact that it does not account for
nonlinearity limits its scope [3].
Grenander takes a diﬀerent view and represents shapes using deformable templates [6] with
shape deformations modeled on the action of groups of diﬀeomorphisms. This approach has been
widely explored (see e.g. [1]), but typical computational costs tend to be somewhat high as com-
pared to those associated with shapes represented as curves.
This may represent a signiﬁcant
practical barrier in problems involving large collections of shapes.
In many applications, it is desirable that shape metrics and deformations respect certain shape
correspondences. For example, in medical imaging, a correspondence between contours is often
established to preserve some landmark points. Shape matching algorithms to produce correspon-
dences that seek to optimally align elements such as velocity ﬁelds or curvature functions of contours
have been investigated by Tagare et al. [17] and Sebastian et al. [13]. Such correspondences often
require that curves be stretched or compressed non-uniformly along their extensions. Work toward
a theory of shapes using elastic models has been carried out in [22, 21], where some shape descrip-
tors and metrics were derived. However, interpolation and statistical problems were only partially
addressed.
Although particular applications may sometimes involve only speciﬁc aspects of shape analysis,
modern vision problems require a unifying framework for the statistical study of shapes and the
development of computational strategies. This demand has spawned numerous studies of shapes
2

in recent years. As pointed out earlier, the Procrustean shape theory of Bookstein and Kendall
meets many of the requirements, but the use of landmarks is a drawback.
Additionally, while
the simplicity of the shape representation is very attractive from a computational standpoint, it
often leads to unsatisfactory interpolations, as illustrated below. In [9], Klassen et al. proposed
an approach where shapes of curves are represented via angle (or curvature) functions associated
with their arc-length parameterizations. The statistical approach to shapes of [10, 5] was extended
to this setting in [9]. However, as deformations of curves respect the arc-length parameter, stretch
elasticity is not incorporated to the model and resulting shape correspondences are sometimes far
from optimal. Other recent studies of planar shapes include work by Mumford and Sharon based
on conformal mappings [14], as well as several models involving representations of shapes as curves
with various diﬀerent metrics [12, 11].
In this paper, we develop an algorithmic approach to shapes of planar contours modeled on
elastic curves. Shape spaces will be constructed with geometric structures that will allow us to use
geodesics to quantify shape divergence and model shape deformations. One of the goals is to retain
some of the computational advantages associated with models such as the arclength-preserving,
bending-only model of Klassen et al. [9], while introducing elasticity to obtain improved, more
natural shape correspondences. Although bearing some philosophical similarities to [9], elasticity
raises a series of new delicate issues to be dealt with both at the theoretical and computational
levels. We present the heuristics of an inﬁnite-dimensional model of elastic shapes and focus the
discussion on ﬁnite-dimensional analogues that lead to a computational model.
A regular, parametric planar curve α: I →R2, where I = [0, 1], will be represented by a pair
(φ, θ) of functions that encode the velocity ﬁeld α′(t), 0 ⩽t ⩽1, of the curve, as follows. The
log-speed φ(t) = log ∥α′(t)∥captures the rate at which the interval I is stretched or compressed
at t to form α, and θ(t) measures the angle the velocity vector α′(t) makes with a horizontal axis,
thus quantifying bending. We consider the inﬁnite-dimensional manifold formed by all pairs (φ, θ)
representing shapes and form a quotient shape space by identifying those that diﬀer by shape-
preserving transformations and by reparameterizations. This space will be equipped with a metric
that captures the elastic properties of the curves. In this manner, we obtain an environment for
the development of a statistical theory of elastic shapes. A fundamental ingredient is an algorithm
to compute shape geodesics, which can be used to quantify shape divergence and to solve shape
interpolation and extrapolation problems. With these elements in place, methods of [10, 5, 15] can
be adapted to the study of shape statistics in the present context. Computational techniques for
estimating shape geodesics will be developed using diﬀerential geometric techniques and dynamic
programming.
A few words about the organization of the paper. In Sec. 2, we introduce the shape represen-
tation to be adopted in the paper and examine the eﬀect of shape-preserving transformations and
curve reparameterizations on the representation. The notion of pre-shape is introduced in Sec. 3. A
pre-shape represents a class of curves after identiﬁcations of those that diﬀer by shape-preserving
transformations of the plane. Manifolds of pre-shapes of arcs and closed curves are constructed
equipped with a Riemannian metric that encodes the elasticity property of the curves. An algo-
3

rithm to calculate geodesics in pre-shape manifolds is developed in Sec. 4 and several examples are
given. Dynamic programming shape matching is discussed in Sec. 5 and geodesics that preserve
shape correspondences are used to quantify shape divergence and interpolate shapes. Shape spaces
obtained as quotient spaces of pre-shape manifolds by identifying pre-shapes that diﬀer by param-
eterizations are introduced in Sec. 6, as well as shape metrics and geodesic morphing techniques.
Applications of geodesics in pre-shape space to the deﬁnition and calculation of mean shapes, and
to the development of shape clustering techniques are presented in Secs. 7 and 8, respectively. This
is followed by some concluding remarks in Sec. 9.

Shape Representation
We begin with the construction of a Riemannian manifold of plane curves, which ultimately will
allow us to model and analyze shapes of planar curves algorithmically. To guide the discussion, we
ﬁrst present a heuristic treatment of an inﬁnite-dimensional model for smooth planar curves since
a rigorous mathematical description would take us too far aﬁeld. Then, we discretize the model to
obtain the algorithmic representation of shapes that will be adopted.
Let I denote the unit interval [0, 1] and α: I →R2 a smooth, regular parametric curve in the
sense that α′(t) ̸= 0, ∀t ∈I. One may think of the mapping α as a prescription for stretching (or
compressing) and bending the interval I at varying rates to produce the curve. To quantify these
two rather independent notions of elastic deformation, write the velocity vector as
α′(t) = eφ(t)ejθ(t),
where φ: I →R and θ: I →R are smooth, and j = √−1.
Here, we are using the standard
identiﬁcation of R2 with the complex plane C. The function φ can be interpreted as the speed of
α expressed in logarithmic scale, and θ as a smooth measurement of the angle the velocity vector
makes with a horizontal axis. Alternately, φ(t) may be viewed as a quantiﬁer of the rate at which
the interval I was stretched or compressed at t to form the curve α, and θ(t) as describing how the
interval I was bent at t to produce the curve α. Note that φ(t) > 0 indicates local stretching near t,
and φ(t) < 0 local compression. The arc-length element of α is ds = eφ(t) dt. Curves parameterized
by arc length, i.e., traversed with constant speed 1, are those with φ ≡0. We shall represent α via
the pair (φ, θ) and denote by H the space of all such pairs. Note that the angle function associated
with α is only deﬁned up to the addition of integer multiples of 2π.
To obtain a discrete representation of the curve, we take n uniformly distributed points 0 =
x1 < x2 < . . . < xn < xn = 1 on I and sample both φ and θ at these points.
Thus, in the
discrete formulation, α is represented by (φ, θ) ∈Rn ×Rn ∼= R2n, where φ = (φ(x1), . . . , φ(xn)) and
θ = (θ(x1), . . . , θ(xn)). However, as we shall see in Sec. 2.3, the usual Euclidean metric on R2n is
not the most appropriate for the present study of elastic shapes. Throughout the paper, we abuse
notation and use φ and θ for both continuous and discrete representations, but the meaning should
be clear from the context.

2.1
Shape-Preserving Transformations
Parametric plane curves that diﬀer by the action of the group of transformations generated by (ori-
entation preserving) rigid motions and homotethies of the plane are to be viewed as representing the
same shape. Thus, we inspect the eﬀect of these transformations on the representation (φ, θ). Since
the functions φ and θ encode properties of the velocity ﬁeld of the curve α, the pair (φ, θ) is clearly
invariant under translations of the curve. The eﬀect of a rotation is to add a constant to θ keeping
φ unchanged, and scaling the curve by a factor k > 0 changes φ to φ + log k leaving θ unaltered.
Depending on the application, one may wish to include orientation-reversing transformations such
as reﬂections, as well (see further remarks on this below).
2.2
Reparametrization
We now examine the action of reparameterizations on (φ, θ). Reparameterizations of α that preserve
the orientation of the curve and the property that it is regular are those obtained by composing α
with an orientation-preserving diﬀeomorphism γ : I →I of the unit interval; the action of γ on α
is to produce the curve β(t) = α(γ(t)). Since
β′(t) = α′(γ(t)) γ′(t) = eφ(γ(t))ejθ(γ(t)) γ′(t) = eφ(γ(t))+log γ′(t)ejθ(γ(t)) ,
the curve β is represented by (φ ◦γ + log γ′, θ ◦γ), where ◦denotes composition of maps; note
that γ′(t) > 0 because γ is a diﬀeomorphism. Hence, reparameterizations deﬁne an action (a right
action, to be more precise) of the group DI of orientation-preserving diﬀeomorphisms of the interval
I on H by
(φ, θ) · γ = (φ ◦γ + log γ′ , θ ◦γ).
(1)
In the discrete formulation, diﬀeomorphisms will be replaced with a class of piecewise linear home-
omorphism of the interval I to be described in more detail in Sec. 5.
2.3
Riemannian Structure
In order to compare curves quantitatively, we assume that they are made of an elastic material and
adopt a metric that measures how diﬃcult it is to reshape a curve into another taking elasticity
into account. Inﬁnitesimally, this can be done using a Riemmanian structure on H. Recall that a
Riemannian metric on a manifold M consists of inner products ⟨, ⟩x on the tangent spaces TxM,
x ∈M, which vary smoothly along the manifold. Such structure allows us to deﬁne basic geometric
quantities such as length of curves, not only inﬁnitesimally, but also at larger scales via integration.
Since the tangent space to H at any point is the space H itself, for each (φ, θ), we wish to
deﬁne an inner product ⟨, ⟩(φ,θ) on H. We adopt the simplest Riemannian structure that will make
the diﬀeomorphism group DI act as transformations that respect the Riemannian structure on H,
much like the way translations and rotations act on standard Euclidean spaces. Given (φ, θ) ∈H,
let hi and fi, i = 1, 2, represent inﬁnitesimal (ﬁrst-order) deformations of φ and θ, resp. , so that
5

(h1, f1) and (h2, f2) are tangent vectors to H at (φ, θ). For a, b > 0, deﬁne
⟨(h1, f1), (h2, f2)⟩(φ,θ) = a
Z 1
0
h1(t)h2(t) eφ(t) dt + b
Z 1
0
f1(t)f2(t) eφ(t) dt.
(2)
This is a weighted sum of the standard L2 inner products of the h and f components with respect
to the arc-length element ds = eφ(t) dt. A simple change-of-variables argument shows that repa-
rameterizations indeed preserve the inner product, as desired. We sometimes omit the subscript
(φ, θ) from the notation.
The elastic properties of the curves are built-in to the model via the parameters a and b, which
can be interpreted as tension and rigidity coeﬃcients, respectively. Large values of the ratio χ = a/b
indicate that the material oﬀers higher resistance to stretching and compression than to bending;
the opposite holds for χ small. The discrete analogue of the inner product is given by

where hj = (hj

non-standard Riemannian structure will be denoted Hn to distinguish it from R2n with the usual
metric.

Manifolds of Elastic Pre-shapes
3.1
Open Pre-Shapes
As remarked in Sec. 2.1, the pair (φ, θ) associated with a parametric curve α is invariant under
translations of α, but the representation is sensitive to rotations and scale.
To make it scale
invariant, we restrict (φ, θ) to represent curves of unit length. To get rotational invariance, we ﬁx
the average value of angle functions with respect to the arc-length element to be, say, π. In other
words, we restrict shape representatives to pairs (φ, θ) satisfying the conditions
Z 1
0
eφ(t) dt = 1
and
Z 1
0
θ(t) eφ(t) dt = π,
(4)
whose discrete analogues are

i=1
eφi = 1
and

θi eφi = π.
(5)
Constraints (4) and (5) deﬁne subspaces A ⊂H and An ⊂Hn, resp. , which we refer to as pre-
shape spaces of open planar elastic curves. We adopt this terminology because we have eliminated
indeterminacies in the representation due to rigid motions and homotheties of the plane, but not
those due to reparameterizations.
A slightly more formal description of the pre-shape spaces will help elucidate some of their
geometric properties. Deﬁne a map F = (F1, F2): H →R2 by
F1(φ, θ) =
Z 1
0
eφ(t) dt and F2(φ, θ) =
Z 1
0
θ(t)eφ(t) dt,
(6)

and let F = (F1, F2): Hn →R2 given by

and
F2(φ, θ) =
n

(7)
be its discrete counterpart. The pre-shape spaces just introduced may be viewed as the level sets
A = F−1(1, π)
and
An = F −1(1, π) ,
respectively. An inspection of (8) shows that these two constraints on (φ, θ) are independent, so that
An is a submanifold of Hn. In particular, at any point (φ, θ) ∈An, the normal (or, perpendicular)
space to An in Hn is 2-dimensional and spanned by the gradient vectors
∇F1(φ, θ) = (1/a, 0) and ∇F2(φ, θ) = (θ/a, 1/b) .
(8)
Here, 1 denotes the constant n-tuple (1, . . . , 1), and similarly 0.
This description of the pre-shape space An has several useful practical implications. The explicit
calculation of gradient vectors in (8) yields a simple algorithmic procedure for projecting vectors
(h, f) ∈Hn orthogonally onto the tangent space T(φ,θ)An by subtracting normal components. This
will be needed, e.g., in numerical calculations of geodesics in An.
Algorithm 3.1.1 Orthogonal Projection of (h, f) ∈Hn onto T(φ,θ)An.
(i) Apply Gram-Schmidt to {∇F1(φ, θ), ∇F2(φ, θ)}, with respect to the inner product ⟨, ⟩(φ,θ), to
obtain an orthonormal basis {e1(φ, θ), e2(φ, θ)} of T(φ,θ)An.
(ii) The orthogonal projection of (h, f) is given by
Π(φ,θ)(h, f) = (h, f) −
2
X
i=1
⟨(h, f), ei(φ, θ)⟩(φ,θ) ei(φ, θ).
Our calculations of geodesics in pre-shape manifolds will also require a mechanism to project
points in Hn onto An. This is because, during numerical integrations of the diﬀerential equation
that governs geodesics in An, points on An typically evolve to points slightly oﬀthe pre-shape
manifold. The projection will then place them back on An. For (φ, θ) ∈Hn, the residual vector
r(φ, θ) = (1, π) −F(φ, θ)
(9)
quantiﬁes how far oﬀ(φ, θ) is from An and it is zero if and only if (φ, θ) ∈An. To project (φ, θ)
onto An, we use Newton’s method to search for a (nearby) zero of r, initializing the search with
(φ, θ), as explained next.
The diﬀerential of F at a point clearly vanishes along directions tangent to its level set, so
that interesting inﬁnitesimal variations of F occur along normal directions. Thus, we calculate
dF restricted to the normal space N(φ, θ) at (φ, θ). The Jacobian of the mapping F restricted to
7

N(φ, θ) can be expressed in the basis {∇Fi(φ, θ), 1 ≤i ≤2} of N(φ, θ) and the standard basis of
R2 as the 2 × 2 symmetric matrix J(φ, θ) whose (i, j) entry is
Jij(φ, θ) = ⟨∇Fi(φ, θ), ∇Fj(φ, θ)⟩(φ,θ) .
(10)
Let ϵ > 0 be a small number.
Algorithm 3.1.2 Projection of (φ, θ) ∈Hn onto An.
1. Compute F(φ, θ) and the residual vector according to Eqn. 9.
2. If ∥r(φ, θ)∥< ϵ, stop. Else, continue.
3. Use (8) to calculate ∇Fi(φ, θ), 1 ≤i ≤2, and the Jacobian matrix J(φ, θ) whose entries are
given by (10).
4. Solve the linear equation J(φ, θ)xT = rT (φ, θ), where x = (x1, x2) and T denotes transposi-
tion.
5. Update (φ, θ) = (φ, θ) + P2
j=1 xj∇Fj(φ, θ). Return to Step 1.
3.2
Closed Pre-Shapes
We now consider a similar manifold Cn of closed pre-shapes where, in addition to (4), curves satisfy
a closure condition. A curve α is closed if and only if
R 1
0 α′(s) ds = 0. If α is represented by the
pair (φ, θ), the closure condition can be expressed as
R 1
0 eφ(t) ejθ(t) dt = 0, or equivalently,
Z 1
0
cos θ(t) eφ(t) dt = 0
and
Z 1
0
sin θ(t) eφ(t) dt = 0.
This leads us to consider the mapping G: H →R4 deﬁned by
G1(φ, θ) =
Z 1
0
eφ(t) dt;
G2(φ, θ) =
Z 1
0
θ(t) eφ(t) dt;
G3(φ, θ) =
Z 1
0
cos θ(t) eφ(t) dt;
G4(φ, θ) =
Z 1
0
sin θ(t) eφ(t) dt.
(11)
As before, G1(φ, θ) = 1 and G2(φ, θ) = π ensure that curves have length 1 and angle functions
have average π with respect to the arc-length parameter, respectively. G3(φ, θ) = G4(φ, θ) = 0
guarantee that the closure condition is satisﬁed. The ﬁnite-dimensional analogue of G is a mapping
G: Hn →R4 obtained by discretizing (11). The pre-shape spaces of closed plane curves are deﬁned
as
C = G−1(1, π, 0, 0)
and
Cn = G−1(1, π, 0, 0).
The space Cn is a submanifold of Hn whose normal space is 4-dimensional at any point.
We
compute the derivative of G explicitly. The derivatives of G1 and G2 were computed in (8). In the
8

continuous formulation,
d G3(h, f) =
Z 1
0
h(t) cos θ(t) eφ(t) dt −
Z 1
0
f(t) sin θ(t) eφ(t) dt

(12)
The corresponding calculation for G yields:
∇G1(φ, θ) = (1/a, 0);
∇G2(φ, θ) = (θ/a, 1/b);
∇G3(φ, θ) = (cos θ/a, −sin θ/b);
∇G4(φ, θ) = (sin θ/a, cos θ/b).
(13)
As in the previous case, two projection algorithms can be derived from this calculation. The
extension of Algorithm 3.1.1 to closed shapes is straightforward, the only diﬀerence being that
Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization is applied to a set of four vectors instead of two.
We only
present the details of the calculation of the Jacobian matrix of G needed for the projection of Hn
onto Cn. Other than that, Algorithm 3.1.2 can be reproduced almost word by word.
The normal space N(φ, θ) to the level set of G at (φ, θ) is spanned by the vectors ∇Gi(φ, θ),
1 ≤i ≤4. The Jacobian of the mapping G restricted to N(φ, θ) can be expressed in this basis of
N(φ, θ) and the standard basis of R4 as the 4 × 4 symmetric matrix J whose (i, j)-entry is
Jij(φ, θ) = ⟨∇Gi(φ, θ), ∇Gj(φ, θ)⟩.
(14)
For implementation purposes, we write J more explicitly. Let
A(φ, θ) =

Geodesics in Pre-shape Spaces
Let p0 = (φ0, θ0) and p1 = (φ1, θ1) represent pre-shapes in An or Cn.
The geodesic distance,
d(p0, p1), between p0 and p1 is deﬁned as
d(p0, p1) = inf
γ ℓ(γ),
(16)
where γ ranges over all piecewise smooth paths in An or Cn from p0 to p1, and ℓ(γ) is the length
of γ deﬁned as
ℓ(γ) =
Z
I
∥γ′(t)∥γ(t) dt =
Z
I

γ′(t), γ′(t)

γ(t)
1/2
dt.
For any Riemannian manifold, it is well known that, locally, the geodesic distance is realized by a
geodesic. For ﬁnite-dimensional, complete Riemannian manifolds, the Hopf-Rinow Theorem asserts
that the same holds in general (see e.g. [4]). In the remainder of the paper, we will work under
the assumption that distances in An and Cn are realized by geodesics. Thus, our next goal is to
develop an algorithm to calculate geodesics in pre-shape spaces with prescribed initial and terminal
points. Our general strategy is similar to that adopted in [9], however, the arguments are much
more elaborate and the details diﬀer signiﬁcantly due to the facts that the inner product on the
ambient space Hn varies from point to point and reparameterizations involve an action of the
diﬀeomorphism group DI.
We give a detailed description of the construction of geodesics in the pre-shape space An; the
corresponding construction for closed pre-shapes only requires minor changes. We begin with the
simpler problem of constructing geodesics in An with prescribed ﬁrst-order initial conditions; that
is, initial position (φ0, θ0) ∈An and initial velocity (h, f) ∈T(φ0,θ0)An.
4.1
Geodesics wth Given Initial Conditions
Suppose p0 = (φ0, θ0) ∈An and (h, f) ∈T(φ0,θ0)An are given. Inﬁnitesimally, we approximate the
geodesic emanating from (φ0, θ0) with initial velocity (h, f) with a small straight line segment in
Hn = R2n. The terminal point of this segment typically falls slightly oﬀof An, so we use Algorithm
3.1.2 to project it back onto An to obtain (φ, θ). To iterate the construction, we need the velocity
vector at the new point, which is the parallel transport of (h, f) along the inﬁnitesimal arc just
constructed. As a numerical approximation to the parallel transport, we ﬁrst update the velocity
vector as
(˜h, ˜f) = (h, f) −δ
h2
2 −b
2a f2, hf

,
(17)
where multiplication of vectors is performed coordinate by coordinate. This update rule is derived
from the system of diﬀerential equations (27) satisﬁed by geodesics in Hn (see Appendix A). Using
Algorithm 3.1.1, project (˜h, ˜f) onto T(φ,θ)An and scale the vector to have the same norm as the
velocity vector at the original point to obtain the new (h, f). Scaling is used because geodesics
are parametric curves with no intrinsic acceleration; in particular, they are traversed with constant
speed.
10

We denote the geodesic starting at (φ0, θ0) ∈An with initial velocity (h, f) ∈T(φ0,θ0)An by
Ψ(φ0, θ0, h, f; t), where t represents the time parameter. The time-1 map expp0 : Tp0An →An given
by
expp0(h, f) = Ψ(φ, θ, h, f; 1)
is known as the exponential map at p0 = (φ0, θ0).
4.2
Geodesics with Given Boundary Conditions
Constructing a geodesic in An from p0 = (φ0, θ0) to p1 = (φ1, θ1) is equivalent to ﬁnding a direction
(h, f) ∈Ts0An such that the geodesic starting from p0 with initial velocity (h, f) reaches p1 in unit
time; that is,
expp0(h, f) = p1 .
(18)
To ﬁnd such direction, consider the functional E : Tp0An →R deﬁned by
E(h, f) = ∥exp(h, f) −p1∥2
p0.
(19)
Notice that E(h, f) = 0 if and only if expp0(h, f) = p1. Thus, the desired geodesic is determined
by the direction (h, f) that annihilates the functional E. The search for the zeros of E on the inner
product space Tp0An can be approached with Newton’s method. We outline the estimation of the
gradient of E needed in the implementation of Newton’s method.
The normal space to An in Hn at p0 is spanned by ∇F1(p0) and ∇F2(p0) given by Eqn. 8.
Deﬁne a linear map L: Hn ≃R2n →R2 by
L(h, f) =

⟨(h, f), ∇F1(p0)⟩p0 , ⟨(h, f), ∇F2(p0)⟩p0

.
Then, Tp0An = ker L.
Find an orthonormal basis {(h1, f1), . . . , (h2n−2, f2n−2)} of ker L using
standard methods. Then, any vector (h, f) ∈Tp0An can be written uniquely as
(h, f) = x1(h1, f1) + . . . + x2n−2(h2n−2, f2n−2).
Hence, (h, f) can be represented by the (2n −2)-tuple x = (x1, . . . , x2n−2) ∈R2n−2 and E can be
treated as a function of x. The partial derivatives of E can be estimated as
∂E
∂xi
∼E(h + ϵhi, f + ϵfi) −E(h, f)
ϵ
,
(20)
for 1 ⩽i ⩽2n −2. This gives a numerical estimation of the gradient of E needed in the implemen-
tation of Newton’s method.
As pointed out earlier, the calculation of geodesics in Cn can be approached with identical
methods. The only diﬀerence is that Cn is a (2n −4)- dimensional submanifold of Hn. An explicit
basis for the normal space at any point has been computed in (13).

Preliminary Illustrations
Fig. 1 shows examples of geodesics in the pre-shape space An computed with the methods described
above. A similar illustration in the pre-shape space Cn of closed curves is shown in Fig. 2. For each
curve, the labels represent points associated with 9 uniformly sampled points over the “time”
interval I. In each row, the initial and terminal frames display given pre-shapes to be interpolated.
The labels illustrate correspondences obtained during geodesic morphing. A low tension coeﬃcient
a was used to allow plenty of stretch elasticity.
In this model, shape correspondences obtained

during geodesic deformations look natural and intuitively correct. For example, the tip of ﬁngers
tend to be preserved, as well as some other geometric features shared by the curves. Comparisons
with shape geodesics in other models are provided below.
Although we provide no theoretical assurance that the geodesics minimize length, extensive
experimentation indicates that, for a vast collection of curves, the geodesics obtained are intuitively
correct. However, further investigations along these lines are needed.

Matching and Interpolating Shapes
As pointed out in the Introduction, in many applications, a correspondence matching points between
shapes to be compared is given. For example, in medical imaging, a correspondence between shapes
is often established to preserve some landmark points. In such cases, it is desirable that shape
metrics and morphing techniques be compatible with the given matching. The same applies to
situations where shape correspondences are established using matching techniques that seek to
12

optimally align elements such as velocity ﬁelds or curvature functions of contours, as in [17, 13].
The goals of this section are:
(i) to explain how geodesics in pre-shape spaces can be used to quantify divergence and interpo-
late shapes in the presence of a preferred matching;
(ii) to investigate a variant of the dynamic programming shape matching strategy of [17, 13] using
an energy functional that is more compatible with the elastic curve model adopted in this
paper.
5.1
Interpolations and Metric
We present the details of the case of general plane curves without the closure condition, but closed
curves can be treated in a similar manner. Let α0, α1 : I →R2 be parametric curves. The time
parameter t induces a correspondence between the curves, namely, α0(t) is matched with α1(t),
for every t. Conversely, it can be shown that for smooth plane curves with no self-intersections,
any diﬀeomorphic correspondence between them arises in this fashion. Moreover, if β0 and β1 are
parameterizations of the same curves inducing the same correspondence as α0 and α1, then the
parameterizations diﬀer by a diﬀeomorphism γ : I →I; that is,
βi(t) = αi(γ(t)),
for i = 0, 1. This motivates the following approach. Think of a correspondence ρ between two curves
C0 and C1 as given by a choice of parameterizations α0 and α1, and let (φ0, θ0), (φ1, θ1) ∈An be
the associated pre-shapes obtained after applying the normalizations discussed in Sec. 3. For a
given choice of elasticity constants a, b > 0, deﬁne the distance between the curves, under the
correspondence ρ, to be
dρ(C0, C1) = da,b ((φ0, θ0), (φ1, θ1)) ,
(21)
where da,b is the geodesic distance in pre-shape space. The length-minimizing geodesic between the
pre-shapes gives a natural interpolation that is compatible with the given correspondence. Notice
that the distance dρ(C0, C1) is well-deﬁned because any other choice of pre-shapes associated with
the given correspondence can be obtained by the action of a diﬀeomorphism γ on (φ0, θ0), (φ1, θ1)
(see Eqn. 1) and the diﬀeomorphism group DI acts on An by distance-preserving transformations,
as explained in Sec. 2.3. A similar fact applies to geodesics. Let (φ(t, s), θ(t, s) be a geodesic in
An between (φ0, θ0) and (φ1, θ1), where t and s denote the curve and deformation parameters,
respectively. Then, the corresponding geodesic between (φ0, θ0) · γ and (φ1, θ1) · γ is obtained by
the action of γ; that is, it is given by
(t, s) 7→
 φ(γ(t), s) + log γ′(t), θ(γ(t), s)

.
As a consequence, in computations of distances and geodesics with respect to given curve corre-
spondences, we can choose any parameterization for one of the curves and adjust the other to
be compatible with the desired matching. In particular, we can assume that one of the curves is
parameterized by arc length; i.e., φ0 ≡0.
13

5.2
Shape Matching with Dynamic Progamming
Given pre-shapes (φ0, θ0), (φ1, θ1) ∈An, elasticity constants a, b > 0 and a diﬀeomorphism γ : I →
I, the functional
E(γ) = ∥(φ0, θ0) −(φ1, θ1) · γ∥2
(φ0,θ0)
=

h

 φ0(t) −φ1 ◦γ(t) −log γ′(t)
2 + b (θ0(t) −θ1 ◦γ(t))2i

measures the compatibility of (φ0, θ0) and (φ1, θ1) · γ from the viewpoint of (φ0, θ0). For matching
purposes, we assume that the pre-shapes have unit speed parameteriztions and seek the diﬀeomor-
phism that minimizes E. In this case, φ0 = φ1 ≡0 and the energy simpliﬁes to
E(γ) =
Z
I
h

 log γ′(t)

(22)
More symmetric forms of the energy can be considered as in [18]. As before, each pre-shape is
sampled uniformly at n points on the interval I. Consider the uniform n × n grid on the square
I × I with grid points labeled (i, j), 0 ⩽i, j ⩽n −1. As indicated in Fig. 3(a), diﬀeomorphisms of
the interval I will be approximated by piecewise linear (PL) homeomorphisms whose graphs are
PL paths on the square I ×I from (0, 0) to (n−1, n−1), with each node a grid point. Note that all
segments in such paths have positive slope. The matching problem is now reduced to ﬁnding the

allowable path that minimizes (a discrete form of) the energy E(γ). Dynamic programming, DP,
is well suited for this problem since the cost associated with a path is additive over its segments.
Thus, it is natural to introduce a localized form of the energy E over a segment. For k < i and
l < j, let L(k, l; i, j) denote the line segment joining (k, l) and (i, j) and let
E (L(k, l; i, j)) =
Z
Iki
h

 log γ′

where Iki ⊆I is the subinterval determined by the points indexed by k and i, and γklij is the linear
diﬀeomorphism from Iki to Ilj whose graph is L(k, l; i, j).
14

To minimize the energy, in principle, one should consider all possible ways of reaching a node
(i, j) through segments of the form L(k, l; i, j), k < i and l < j. For computational eﬃciency, in
practice, we restrict the indexes (k, l) to a subset Nij. A possible choice of Nij is illustrated in
Fig. 3(b). Deﬁne the minimum energy H(i, j) needed to reach the node (i, j), iteratively, as follows:
(i) H(0, 0) = 0 ;
(ii) H(i, j) = E(ˆk, ˆl; i, j) + H(ˆk, ˆl),
where
(ˆk, ˆl) = argmin
(k,l)∈Nij
E(k, l; i, j).
The energy H(i, j) is computed sequentially, starting from (0, 0) and increasing i, j until all allow-
able vertices are visited. For nodes that cannot be reached, we preassign H(i, j) = ∞. This is the
case, e.g., for all (i, 0) and (0, j), 1 ⩽i, j ⩽n −1. Once H(n −1, n −1) has been computed, we
backtrack to ﬁnd a path of minimum energy that represents a PL homeomorphism of the interval
I.
Fig. 4(a) illustrates this shape matching strategy applied to pre-shapes initially parameterized
by arc length; i.e., φ0 = φ1 ≡0. We adopted a low value for the tension parameter a in order to
allow plenty of stretch elasticity. As stretching is essentially not penalized, this translates to the
fact that the matching diﬀeomorphism γ will attempt to align the angle functions θ0 and θ1 ◦γ as
much as possible to minimize E. Fig. 4(b) is an intensity plot of the energy H and the overlaid
path represents the optimal diﬀeomorphism γ estimated using dynamic programming. Fig. 4(c)
illustrates the improved alignment of angle functions after the action of γ on θ1.

The implementation for closed contours is similar, except that we also need to consider all
possible choices of initial points. Computational strategies to manage this extra degree of freedom
are discussed in [?, ?]. Examples of correspondences for closed shapes are shown in Fig. 5.
5.3
Geodesics
We conclude this section with several examples of geodesics between closed shapes that respect
optimal alignments obtained via the dynamic programming approach of Sec. 5.2. To illustrate the
15

improvement over geodesics in the more rigid, bending-only shape model of Klassen et al. [9] and
the landmark model of Kendall [8], we oﬀer a few comparisons of these three types of geodesics in
Fig. 6.
Figure 6: Geodesics in the fully elastic, bending-only and Procrustes models. In each group, the
ﬁrst row shows a geodesic between elastic shapes with low tension coeﬃcient, aligned with dynamic
programming techniques. For comparison purposes, the second and third rows in each group display
geodesics in the bending-only and Procrustes models, respectively.
Figure 5.3 shows an application of elastic shape geodesics to echocardiography. The ﬁrst and
last panels show the end diastolic (ED) and end systolic (ES) frames, taken from the apical four-
chamber view, during systole (the contracting part of the cardiac cycle). Overlaid on these frames
are expert tracings of the epicardial (as solid lines) and endocardial (as dashed lines) contours of the
left ventricle. Among other things, cardiologists are interested in the temporal evolution of these
16

contours. Geodesics in the pre-shape space of elastic curves with DP alignment were scaled and
positioned appropriately to estimate the contours for intermediate frames. Images were acquired a
rate of 30 frames per second; some of the frames are displayed in the ﬁgure. Modeling shapes on
elastic curves that can be stretched, compressed and bent in diﬀerent ways along the extension of
the curve has a series of advantages. For example, one can observe that the apex of both endocardial
and epicardial contours as well as sharp corners and edges are well aligned during the evolution.

dial contours of the left ventricle at end diastole and end systole to estimate their evolution during

Spaces of Elastic Shapes
Shape metrics and interpolations based on geodesics in pre-shape spaces and DP alignment, as
discussed in Sec. 5, are very attractive from a computational standpoint. Extensive experimentation
also indicates that matchings and interpolations so obtained tend to be intuitively correct; further
evidence of this fact will be provided below. Thus, in practice, this is the model we propose to
adopt. The framework that we have developed also allow us to deﬁne spaces of shapes as quotient
spaces of pre-shape spaces under the action of reparameterizations and compute distances and
interpolations without assuming any preferred shape correspondences; as a matter of fact, ﬁnding
an optimal correspondence becomes an intrinsic part of the problem of deﬁning geodesic distance
in shape space. However, the additional computational costs are signiﬁcant. For completeness, we
brieﬂy outline the construction of shape spaces, metrics, and morphing techniques.
6.1
Shape of Planar Arcs
17

The shape of a planar arc admits multiple representative pre-shapes, as deﬁned in Sec. 3.1, due to
all possible reparameterizations of a curve. Thus, we deﬁne the shape space S of planar arcs as the
quotient space of A by the action of DI, that is, S = A/DI. Deﬁne a (pseudo) metric on S by
d(s1, s2) =
min
(φ1,θ1),(φ2,θ2)d((φ1, θ1), (φ2, θ2)),
where the minimum is taken over all pre-shapes (φ1, θ1) and (φ2, θ2) representing s1 and s2, re-
spectively. Let (0, θ∗
i ) be the representative of si, i = 1, 2, parameterized by arc length. Then, any
pre-shape representing si can be written as (0, θ∗
i ) · γ, with γ ∈DI. Moreover, since DI acts on
A by isometries, we can ﬁx the representative of s1 to be (0, θ∗
1) and take the minimum only over
(φ2, θ2). Thus, the distance in S can be expressed as
d(s1, s2) = inf
γ∈DI
d ((0, θ∗
1), (0, θ∗
2) · γ) .
The cost function (19) used in the construction of geodesics in pre-shape spaces is now modiﬁed to
E(h, f; γ) = ∥exp(0,θ∗
0)(h, f) −(0, θ∗
1) · γ∥2
(0,θ∗
0).
(23)
to include the action of γ.
A path realizing the geodesic distance has the property that it is
orthogonal to the orbit of the diﬀeomorphism group at any point. Thus, in the construction of
geodesics, the search for the appropriate direction (h, f) to shoot a geodesic from (0, θ∗
0) is restricted
to those tangent to An and perpendicular to the orbit of DI at (0, θ∗
0) in Hn. The minimization
of E is carried out iteratively alternating between the variables (h, f) and γ. The optimization
over γ is done with dynamic programming as in Sec. 5.2. Gradient methods are utilized for the
optimization over (h, f).
6.2
Closed Shapes
Geodesic distance and morphing techniques for closed shapes can be treated in an almost identical
manner, with the extra closure condition enforced.
7
Mean Shapes
Observations of the shape of an object or shapes associated with a family of similar objects typically
exhibit signiﬁcant variations. For example, contours of objects in images are subject to variations
due to pose, perspective, noise, and partial occlusions. Hence, an important goal in the algorithmic
study of shapes is to develop tools for a statistical treatment of shapes. Tangent-space represen-
tation is becoming a standard approach to the analysis of data on Riemannian manifolds [5]. The
idea is to deﬁne and calculate the sample mean and lift the data to the tangent space at the mean
via the inverse exponential map. The data points are now represented as points on a vector space
equipped with an inner product where standard tools of data analysis can be applied. For example,
estimation of covariance in the tangent-space representation has been studied in many diﬀerent
18

contexts (see e.g. [5, 16, 20]). Thus, in this paper, we focus on the most basic notion needed, that
of mean elastic shape. We adopt the notion of Fr´echet mean shape that has been previously used
in the landmark and bending-only models [5, 9]. These are special cases of a more general notion
of mean on a Riemannian manifold studied by Karcher [7]. We present a formulation for closed
shapes, but shapes of elastic arcs can be treated similarly.
Let s1, . . . , sk be a collection of closed shapes. For a choice of elasticity constants a, b > 0,
deﬁne the scatter of the collection with respect to a shape s to be
V (s) = 1
2
k
X
i=1
d2
a,b(s, si),
(24)
where da,b denotes geodesic distance. A Fr´echet mean of the collection is deﬁned as a shape that is a
(local) minimum of V . In practice, we approximate da,b(s, si) by the geodesic distance in pre-shape
space after a DP alignment, as discussed in Sec. 5. To search for a Fr´echet mean of the collection,
we adopt a gradient-type strategy. For data on a Riemannian manifold, the (negative) gradient of
the scatter functional V is known to be given by
−∇V (s) =
k
X
i=1
vi ,
(25)
where vi is the initial velocity vector of the geodesic that runs from s to si in unit time [?]; that is,
exps(vi) = si. Motivated by this observation, initialize the search with s as one of the shapes in the
given collection and choose pre-shapes p = (φ, θ) and pi = (φi, θi) representing s and si, 1 ⩽i ⩽k,
with each pi aligned with p via dynamic programming. Find the geodesics in the pre-shape manifold
Cn from p to pi and calculate their initial velocities vi = (hi, fi). Then, inﬁnitesimally displace p in
Cn along a geodesic from p in the direction v = Pk
i=1 vi (see Sec. 4.1). The updated shape s is the
shape associated with the new pre-shape p. The process is iterated until the norm of v falls below
a set threshold thus yielding an estimation of a mean shape.
Figure 8 shows several examples of mean shapes computed with the algorithmic procedure just
described. For comparison purposes, we also display the mean shape in the more rigid bending-only
model of [?]. The examples illustrate well the fact that the ﬁner shape correspondences built-in to
the elastic model leads to more natural mean shapes. On the ﬁrst three rows, unlike the bending-
only means, the elastic means preserve the main features shared by the shapes. Similarly, on the
fourth row, more of the common sharp features of the sample shapes are retained by the elastic
mean.
8
Clustering
Alongside statistical modeling of shapes, clustering techniques are of basic importance in applica-
tions involving large collections of shapes. In [16], a variant of the classical k-Means Algorithm
was developed and implemented for clustering shapes using the bending-only model. The MCMC
techniques adopted in that paper for the construction of clusters apply to other shape metrics

since the shape model is only used to compute the pairwise distances between the sample shapes.
Thus, here, we just oﬀer illustrations of results obtained by replacing the shape metric with the
elastic geodesic distance with DP alignment. Figure 9 shows a collection of 50 shapes of hands at
various diﬀerent poses. Clusters obtained with the k-Means Algorithm with k = 10 are displayed
in Fig. 10.
The results of another clustering experiment with the elastic geodesic distance with
DP alignment are shown in Fig. 11. Here, the 50 smaple shapes were grouped into 8 clusters using
a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Starting with 50 clusters, each consisting of one of the given
shapes, clusters were combined successively using the nearest neighbor as merging criterion. For
comparison purposes, in Fig. 12 we show clusters obtained with the bending-only model. This ex-
periment illustrates well the fact that the elastic model produces more natural groupings of shapes.

Summary and Concluding Remarks
Motivated by problems arising in computer vision and image understanding, we developed a new
treatment of shapes of plane curves, where shapes are modeled on elastic strings that can stretched,
compressed and bent at varying rates along their extensions.
Shape spaces were constructed
equipped with metrics that reﬂect elastic properties of the curves, and geodesics were used to
quantify shape divergence and morph shapes.
Approximations of elastic shape geodesics using
dynamic programming alignment and geodesics in pre-shapes were presented that make the model
practically feasible. The techniques developed were applied to statistical modeling of families of

shapes and to the design of shape clustering algorithms. A distinctive advantage of the elastic
shape model presented in this paper is the more natural and intuitive shape correspondences asso-
ciated with shape distances and geodesics making it more suitable for various applications. Several
comparisons with existing models were oﬀered to illustrate this point.
