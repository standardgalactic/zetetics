Abstract 
11 
 
12 
Correctly identifying the meaning of a stimulus requires activating the appropriate semantic 
13 
representation among many alternatives. One way to reduce this uncertainty is to differentiate semantic 
14 
representations from each other, thereby expanding the semantic space. In four experiments, we test this 
15 
semantic-expansion hypothesis, finding that uncertainty averse individuals exhibit increasingly 
16 
differentiated and separated semantic representations. This effect is mirrored at the neural level, where 
17 
uncertainty aversion predicts greater distances between activity patterns in the left inferior frontal gyrus 
18 
when reading words, and enhanced sensitivity to the semantic ambiguity of these words in the 
19 
ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Two direct tests of the behavioral consequences of semantic-expansion 
20 
further reveal that uncertainty averse individuals exhibit reduced semantic interference and poorer 
21 
generalization. Together, these findings demonstrate that the internal structure of our semantic 
22 
representations is shaped in a principled manner: aversion to uncertainty acts as an organizing principle to 
23 
make the world more identifiable.

Introduction 
27 
Human life is rife with uncertainty, from the information we gather through our senses1,2 to the 
28 
unpredictable outcomes of our actions3–6. People intolerant to uncertainty find it especially aversive and 
29 
are therefore strongly motivated to reduce it7,8. When confronted with ambiguous situations that lack a 
30 
clear interpretation, those who are averse to uncertainty experience stress and will take action to avoid 
31 
any additional uncertainty9. Because these individuals are more sensitive to uncertainty and perceive 
32 
greater uncertainty than those who are uncertainty tolerant10, they are often better at remembering 
33 
concepts or cues that signal uncertainty11. In short, uncertainty aversion plays an outsized role in shaping 
34 
behavior across a range of domains12–15. Despite this, uncertainty is inescapable; it even imbues the 
35 
concepts we use to make sense of the world16. Take for instance the words “slip” and “lapse”, which have 
36 
similar, but subtly different meanings. When focusing on the similarities, both refer to some form of 
37 
mistake, which means that they can represented similarly in semantic space and it may not matter which 
38 
word one uses. Focusing on the differences, however, highlights that a “slip” is usually trivial and 
39 
accidental, while a “lapse” can be serious and imply responsibility, and this may cause an individual to

separate these concepts in semantic space. Here, we propose that individuals seeking to minimize 
41 
uncertainty distinguish concepts from one another by separating them in semantic space. 
42 
Semantic representations encode our conceptual knowledge about the world and influence how 
43 
we perceive incoming sensory information17, which enables us to ascribe meaning to stimuli16. However, 
44 
because stimuli typically activate more than one concept, there is always some uncertainty when 
45 
identifying meaning. The degree of uncertainty between a pair of concepts depends on their separation in 
46 
semantic representational space. Therefore, ensuring that concepts are sufficiently differentiated from one 
47 
another in such a space helps to reduce semantic uncertainty. This logic accords with classic work 
48 
demonstrating that the closer a pair of concepts are in psychological space (e.g., snow and cold), the more 
49 
confusable they are, while more dissimilar concepts are easier to discriminate and thus suffer far less from 
50 
semantic interference (e.g., cat and black)18,19. In short, the distances between concepts in semantic 
51 
representational space determine whether one’s everyday experiences are conceptually ambiguous or 
52 
fairly clear-cut. We hypothesize that individuals averse to uncertainty mitigate the effects of uncertainty 
53 
by making their semantic representations more distinct. Here we test whether this process, which we term 
54 
semantic expansion, causes increases in pair-wise distances between concepts in psychological or neural 
55 
space, thus rendering related concepts as more separable for a downstream readout mechanism.  
56 
The echo of such a strategy should also be detectable in the structure of neural representations. 
57 
Consider a brain region that encodes concepts in the activity of its neurons. Each concept is associated 
58 
with a distinct neural activity pattern, and separating the activity patterns from each other as much as 
59 
possible enables a downstream neuron reading out the representation to disambiguate each concept from 
60 
the others20–22. The greater the distance between neural activity patterns, the more separable the 
61 
representation is23,24, and, consequently, the less uncertainty there is in the representation—which would 
62 
be very useful to those who prefer to reduce the attendant uncertainty of a concept (Fig. 1). Simply put, 
63 
our semantic expansion hypothesis predicts that individuals who are averse to uncertainty should exhibit 
64 
more differentiated neural activity patterns.  
65 
While the need to discriminate between concepts encourages concepts to be separated from each 
66 
other, there is an opposing functional influence on the structure of the representational space: the need to 
67 
keep similar concepts closer to each other in psychological space. This promotes useful generalization 
68 
between similar concepts. In other words, the structure of a semantic representation reflects a trade-off 
69 
between the need for discrimination and generalization. We hypothesize that people averse to uncertainty, 
70 
through semantic expansion, privilege discrimination over generalization.     
71 
To test this semantic-expansion hypothesis, we conducted four experiments where we examined 
72 
the effects of individual differences in uncertainty attitudes on semantic distances between words in 
73 
psychological and neural space and their behavioral consequences. Results reveal that uncertainty

aversion promotes the separation of semantic representations at both the psychological (Experiment 1) 
75 
and neural levels (Experiment 2). We then tested the direct behavioral consequences of the semantic-
76 
expansion by examining how uncertainty aversion shapes the trade-off between discriminability and 
77 
generalization. We find that uncertainty aversion reduces semantic interference (Experiment 3) and leads 
78 
to poorer generalization (Experiment 4). In other words, people averse to uncertainty exhibit more distinct 
79 
semantic representations, which results in them prioritizing the need to discriminate between concepts, at 
80 
the cost of their ability to generalize.  
81

Results 
83 
Aversion to uncertainty is associated with more distinct semantic representations. In Experiment 1, 
84 
103 participants made semantic relatedness judgements between 16 target words and 42 comparison 
85 
words (see Methods and Fig.1). Similarity between the 16 target words was then estimated by correlating 
86 
the 42-element vectors of relatedness ratings across words. To calculate distances between words using 
87 
the same number of meaningful dimensions for each participant25, multidimensional scaling (MDS) was 
88 
applied. A four-dimensional partition was selected given that it was the lowest number of dimensions that 
89 
produced a good fit (stress = 0.09)26. In this four-dimensional space, the average distance between words 
90 
was computed for each participant and then correlated with individuals’ uncertainty attitudes, which were 
91 
captured by the well-validated intolerance of uncertainty scale (IUS). The IUS assesses uncertainty 
92 
aversion by asking people to rate to what extent statements like “the ambiguities in life stress me” 
93 
describe them9. Demonstrating a semantic expansion effect, we found greater aversion to uncertainty was 
94 
associated with an increase in the distance between concepts in psychological space (r = 0.35, p = 0.0003; 
95 
Fig. 2A). This relationship was not dependent on the number of dimensions selected when applying 
96 
multidimensional scaling since the same result also holds for three, five, and six dimensions (see 
97 
Supplementary Table 1). This effect was not driven by an increase in response variability in people with 
98 
higher IUS scores: there was no significant relationship between response variability and uncertainty 
99 
aversion (r = -0.03, p-value = 0.79, see Supplementary Figure 1), and the semantic expansion 
100 
effect remained significant after controlling for response variability in a regression (  = 0.001 ± 0.0002 
101 
(S.E.), p < 0.001). The effect also remains significant after controlling for global variables like IQ, age, 
102 
and gender (β = 0.001 ± 0.0003 (S.E.), p = 0.002, see Supplementary Table 2).  
103 
 
104 
Semantic neural representations expand as a function of the aversion to uncertainty. To test whether 
105 
uncertainty aversion is also associated with more distal neural representations, in Experiment 2 we 
106 
analyzed data from a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which 44 participants 
107 
read 60 words and were asked to think about their meaning (see Methods). We used representational

similarity analysis (RSA) to estimate the distance between words in neural semantic space.  
109 
Given previous work showing a role for the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), angular gyrus, middle 
110 
temporal gyrus, anterior temporal cortex, and perirhinal cortex in semantic representation27–32, we 
111 
hypothesized that the pair-wise distances between the neural representations of words in these brain 
112 
regions (localized to the left hemisphere33) would be sensitive to uncertainty aversion. We further 
113 
reasoned that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), as well as the precuneus—regions known to 
114 
process various forms of uncertainty6,34–38, and in some cases have also been implicated in semantic 
115 
processing (i.e., the precuneus)31—might be involved in indexing the relationship between uncertainty 
116 
intolerance and how words are represented.  
117

Figure 1. Dissimilar semantic representations and neural activity patterns are more identifiable. Each 
120 
word is associated with a semantic representation captured by judging the semantic relationship between 
121 
two sets of words (Experiment 1) or a unique neural pattern of activity captured by reading a list of

5 
words one at a time (Experiment 2). Semantic and neural competition increases as similarity between 
123 
neural activity increases. Neural representations that are more dissimilar on average would suffer less 
124 
neural competition and, as a consequence, be more identifiable.  
125 
 
126 
In any neural semantic representation, the neural pattern distance between a pair of concepts 
127 
should be proportional to their semantic dissimilarity. We reasoned that, under the semantic expansion 
128 
hypothesis, uncertainty aversion would increase the slope of the relationship between semantic 
129 
dissimilarity and neural representational dissimilarity, as people averse to uncertainty expand their neural 
130 
semantic space. To test this prediction, for each participant, a neural representational dissimilarity matrix 
131 
(RDM) was constructed for each ROI by computing the cross-validated Mahalanobis distance between all 
132 
word pairs39. A model RDM was also constructed containing the pairwise differences of the semantic 
133 
dissimilarity between words derived from Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe; see 
134 
Methods). For each of our regions of interest, a linear mixed-effect regression was run with the vectorized 
135 
lower triangle of the neural RDM as the dependent variable, and the vectorized lower triangle of the 
136 
semantic similarity RDM, an individual’s tolerance to uncertainty, and their interaction, all as predictors. 
137 
In the LIFG, we observed a significant positive interaction between semantic similarity and aversion to 
138 
uncertainty: increasingly dissimilar words exhibit increasingly dissimilar activity patterns, especially for 
139 
individuals who are averse to uncertainty (β = 0.02 ± 0.006 (S.E.), p = 0.005; Bonferroni-corrected for 
140 
multiple comparisons across seven ROIs, Fig. 2C). Including age, gender and level of education as 
141 
covariates did not change this result (see Supplementary Results Experiment 2). This effect was not 
142 
observed in any other ROIs (see Supplementary Table 3).  
143 
 We also tested the possibility that this neural semantic expansion effect was driven by increased 
144 
executive control exerted by participants with high IUS scores, which could in theory produce an online 
145 
reshaping of the semantic representation. To test this, we estimated the mean activity in the fronto-parietal 
146 
regions of the brain40, which are known to index executive control and mental effort40, and included them 
147 
as covariates in our regression. Again, the significant interaction between semantic similarity and IUS 
148 
remained significant (β = 0.03 ± 0.005, p < 0.001).

Figure 2. A. A significant correlation was observed between uncertainty intolerance and distances 
151 
between semantic representations. Shaded area reflects 95% confidence intervals, the result remains 
152 
significant even after removing the two outliers. *** p < 0.001. B. Uncertainty aversion modulates the 
153 
relationship between semantic similarity and neural similarity. Semantic representations were captured 
154 
by a reduced neural space for people tolerant of uncertainty, while the neural space was larger for 
155 
people averse to uncertainty. Cross-validated Mahalanobis distances between pairs of words plotted as a 
156 
function of beta estimates extracted from the regression model. C. This relationship between uncertainty 
157 
aversion and representational distance between words in the LIFG is further illustrated using two 
158 
representative participants that differed in their uncertainty attitudes. Multidimensional scaling was 
159 
applied to their average neural RDMs to transform the neural representational distances for all word 
160 
pairs into a two-dimensional space. Each word is represented by a point in the plane. Words are more 
161 
distant from one another for the uncertainty averse participant.  
162 
 
163 
Aversion to uncertainty is associated with greater neural sensitivity to semantic ambiguity. The 
164 
uncertainty associated with multiple semantic representations cued by a given word is higher for words 
165 
that have multiple meanings and are thus considered semantically ambiguous. For example, ‘run’ can be 
166 
used in a diverse array of contexts whereas ‘artichoke’ is typically only used in the context of food. A

7 
word that can be used in many different contexts has a larger number of referents and greater semantic 
168 
ambiguity41. For those intolerant to uncertainty, encoding this ambiguity would enable semantic 
169 
representations to be tagged as ones that must be structured more distally. To test this, we used RSA to 
170 
estimate the pair-wise neural pattern distances between each word. Given that each word is associated 
171 
with a certain degree of semantic ambiguity—estimated using a corpus that counts the number of contexts 
172 
a given word appears in41—we can interrogate whether our regions of interests6,34,35,37,38,42 track this 
173 
semantic ambiguity as a function of an individual’s aversion to uncertainty. We constructed a neural 
174 
RDM comprised of the pair-wise cross-validated Mahalanobis distances between individual words, and a 
175 
model RDM containing the pairwise differences of the semantic ambiguity between words derived from a 
176 
language corpus (see Methods). We then ran a linear mixed-effects regression analysis where the 
177 
vectorized neural RDM served as the dependent variable, and the vectorized semantic ambiguity RDM 
178 
and an individual’s tolerance to uncertainty (as well as their interaction) served as predictors for our 
179 
regions of interest.  
180 
Given the importance of semantic ambiguity to uncertainty-averse individuals, we expected 
181 
ambiguity to be encoded more strongly for participants with higher IUS. Indeed, in the VMPFC, we 
182 
observed a significant positive interaction between semantic ambiguity and aversion to uncertainty: words 
183 
that are similar in their semantic ambiguity exhibit similar activity patterns, especially for individuals who 
184 
are averse to uncertainty (β = 0.03 ± 0.006 (S.E.), p < 0.001; Fig. 3B). A similar effect, albeit of lower 
185 
magnitude, was also observed in the precuneus and LIFG, as indexed by a significant interaction between 
186 
intolerance of uncertainty and semantic ambiguity (precuneus: β = 0.02 ± 0.006 (S.E.), p = 0.03, LIFG: β 
187 
= 0.02 ± 0.006 (S.E.), p = 0.04—these effects, however, do not remain significant after controlling for 
188 
increased cognitive effort presumably associated with processing semantically ambiguous words (see 
189 
Supplementary Table 4 for the rest of the ROIs).

participant, a neural RDM was estimated, vectorized, and then correlated with the vectorized semantic 
194 
ambiguity RDM derived from the language corpus. For those averse to uncertainty, activity patterns in 
195 
the VMPFC are more dissimilar between words that are semantically ambiguous. Shaded areas reflect

Aversion to uncertainty improves semantic discrimination. The semantic-expansion hypothesis posits 
199 
that uncertainty-averse subjects reduce uncertainty by increasing the separation between concepts in both 
200 
psychological and neural space. A natural consequence of this hypothesized semantic expansion is that 
201 
for those intolerant to uncertainty, similar concepts can be more easily discriminated and are less likely to 
202 
produce semantic interference. To test for this reduction in semantic interference, we leveraged the classic 
203 
Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) false memory paradigm where subjects first encode lists of words 
204 
and are then asked to discriminate between old and new words in a surprise recognition memory test (Fig. 
205 
4A). A robustly observed effect within the literature is that lure words semantically similar to the initial 
206 
words (e.g., snow and cold) tend to be falsely endorsed as old15,16.  
207 
In Experiment 3, 206 participants first studied 50 words, and were then given a surprise 
208 
recognition memory task, with 100 words, 50 of which were the ones previously shown, and 50 of which 
209 
were novel (see Methods and Fig. 4A). Participants performed the task reasonably well, correctly 
210 
identifying the old words 72% of the time (hit rate) while misidentifying the new words 31% of the time 
211 
(false alarm rate). To test the prediction that uncertainty aversion would modulate the effect of semantic 
212 
interference, we focused our analysis on the false alarm rate. We first estimated semantic similarity 
213 
between the novel and previously seen words using an unsupervised learning algorithm trained on a large 
214 
language corpus (GloVe). The maximum similarity between previously seen words and each new word 
215 
was calculated and used as a regressor (alongside participants’ IUS scores, as well as their interaction) to 
216 
predict the false alarm rate. Results reveal that as the similarity between novel and previously seen words 
217 
increases, so too does the probability of falsely identifying a novel word as being already seen (β = -0.23 
218 
± 0.11 (S.E.), p = 0.03)—an effect that was modulated by one’s tolerance to uncertainty (interaction: β = 
219 
0.06 ± 0.02 (S.E.), p = 0.01, Fig. 4B). That is, the greater the aversion to uncertainty is, the better the 
220 
discrimination between similar concepts. This effect remains significant when adding average hit-rate as a 
221 
regressor in the model (β = 0.06 ± 0.02 (S.E.), p = 0.01, see Supplementary Figure 2).  
222 
 
223 
Aversion to uncertainty reduces semantic generalization. Classic work shows that generalization 
224 
between stimuli decreases as the psychological distance (i.e., discriminability) between the stimuli 
225 
increases43. By this logic, a direct consequence of semantic expansion—which is observed in those averse 
226 
to uncertainty—should be a reduction in semantic generalization. To test this, in Experiment 4, 197 
227 
participants first learned an association between four concepts (e.g., chair, wrench, which was cued by 
228 
images of objects) and four actions (pressing one of four possible keys). To learn the associations, 
229 
participants were presented with an image of an object and told to press one of the keys. Feedback about 
230 
whether the correct key was pressed was immediately provided. Once they learned which concept was 
231 
associated with which key, they moved to a generalization phase where they were presented with new

9 
pictures of other concepts (e.g., stool, screwdriver). This time, they were instructed to press whichever 
233 
key they saw fit (no feedback was provided during the generalization phase, see Methods and Fig. 4C). 
234 
For each of the four concepts presented during learning, two concepts were selected as stimuli in the 
235 
generalization phase, one which was semantically close to the initial concept (e.g., stool is conceptually 
236 
similar to chair) and another that was further away (e.g., curtain is conceptually distant to chair), but still 
237 
semantically closer than any of the other target concepts (e.g., curtain is even more distant to jellyfish 
238 
than chair). Pressing the same key associated with the concept during learning was coded as successful 
239 
generalization (=1), while any other response was coded as lack of generalization (=0). Semantic 
240 
similarity between the novel concepts during generalization and initial concepts during learning was 
241 
estimated using GloVe to predict the probability of generalization, alongside participant’s aversion to 
242 
uncertainty and their interaction. As expected, results reveal that the probability of generalization 
243 
increased as the similarity between novel and target concepts increased (β = -0.83 ± 0.042 (S.E.), p < 
244 
0.001), an effect that was modulated by uncertainty aversion (interaction: β = 0.08 ± 0.03 (S.E.), p = 
245 
0.01), such that semantically similar concepts supported a lower level of generalization as uncertainty 
246 
aversion increased (see Fig. 4D).

Discussion 
260 
Uncertainty is present in virtually all aspects of our lives, from perceptual judgments to decision 
261 
outcomes. A major source of uncertainty comes from deciphering meaning in a conceptually ambiguous 
262 
world. Not only are most stimuli associated with more than one meaning44, but a stimulus can also 
263 
activate multiple similar semantic representations45 (e.g., slip and lapse), which results in greater 
264 
uncertainty. Here, we directly tested one strategy for reducing this type of uncertainty, which is to expand 
265 
one’s semantic representations.  
266 
Behavioral and neural results illustrate the semantic-expansion hypothesis. Aversion to 
267 
uncertainty scales with more differentiated semantic representations (Experiment 1), which is also 
268 
associated with increasingly separated neural activity patterns in the LIFG (Experiment 2)—a region 
269 
classically involved with matching words with their appropriate semantic representation46–49. Two direct 
270 
behavioral tests of this semantic-expansion hypothesis demonstrate that uncertainty averse individuals 
271 
exhibit improved semantic discrimination during a surprise memory recognition test (Experiment 3) and 
272 
reduced semantic generalization for similar concepts (Experiment 4). As uncertainty becomes more 
273 
aversive, the structure of semantic representations becomes increasingly separated so that each concept is 
274 
more easily identified, and as a consequence, the mapping between stimulus and meaning becomes more 
275 
certain. Together, these findings demonstrate that personality needs, such as the need to reduce 
276 
uncertainty, can shape fundamental aspects of cognition, including how we represent meaning. Indeed, 
277 
our results suggest that an organizing principle of semantic representations might be the amount of 
278 
uncertainty people can tolerate.  
279 
The fact that we found that the expansion of neural activity patterns was localized to the LIFG—
280 
and not a broader neural network associated with uncertainty50–52—suggests that regions not traditionally 
281 
related to uncertainty processing also play a distinct role in helping to reduce semantic uncertainty. Taken 
282 
a step further, rather than relying on the arbitration of specific neural regions to encode various types of 
283 
uncertainty50–52, it is possible that the brain reduces uncertainty by shaping the geometry of neural activity 
284 
patterns associated with concepts (or stimuli). This account dovetails with current, broader theories of 
285 
neural activity that posit a relationship between distinct representations and reduced task 
286 
interference20,23,24. 
287 
 
Our findings also demonstrate that classic uncertainty regions, namely the VMPFC and 
288 
precuneus, are especially sensitive to semantic uncertainty in those averse to uncertainty—the first work 
289 
to link the neural encoding of semantic representation to regions involved in processing uncertainty27. 
290 
Considering that the semantic expansion result was localized to the LIFG, this finding suggests a neural 
291 
division of labor. In a situation devoid of context in which virtually any meaning associated with each 
292 
word could be retrieved, VMPFC appears to signal the differences in the number of possible referents that

could be retrieved. In contrast, the LIFG plays a role in biasing the structure of semantic 
294 
representations—through the alteration of the geometry of neural representations—which expands 
295 
depending on one’s aversion to uncertainty, thus avoiding semantic confusion. This accords with prior 
296 
work linking LIFG activity with the resolution of semantic ambiguity53.  
297 
Even though the specific role of the left IFG in language processing is still debated54, it has been 
298 
implicated in semantic control55,56. The fact that the observed semantic expansion effect was localized 
299 
only to the LIFG may suggest that semantic expansion does not occur in stable semantic representations, 
300 
but is instead produced online based on task demands. We caution, however, against interpreting the 
301 
LIFG as the sole player involved in processing semantic expansion for two reasons. First, the fact that we 
302 
did not observe semantic expansion in the anterior temporal cortex may simply be because our study was 
303 
not optimized to capture BOLD signal in this region. Second, the online account is hard to reconcile with 
304 
our finding in Experiment 3 that semantic interference is reduced in those averse to uncertainty (i.e.  since 
305 
there is no task demand to discriminate concepts during encoding when interference occurs, but only 
306 
later, during a surprise recognition memory test). Indeed, similar semantic interference effects have 
307 
previously been associated with medial temporal regions18 rather than LIFG. Future work should clarify 
308 
whether semantic expansion is a property of the stored representation, the result of an online computation, 
309 
or both. 
310 
Regardless, the resolution of semantic ambiguity through semantic expansion has behavioral 
311 
consequences that can be understood through the lens of a computational tradeoff between discrimination 
312 
and generalization23,43,57. The world would be impossible to navigate if we had to learn from scratch how 
313 
to engage with each new stimulus. Instead, we routinely generalize what we learn about from one 
314 
stimulus to other conceptually similar stimuli43,57,58. This sensitivity to the similarity between concepts, 
315 
however, comes at the cost of increased uncertainty and the possibility of interference. We are more likely 
316 
to confuse two similar concepts with one another, resulting in errors of discrimination. A natural 
317 
consequence of semantic expansion is that it shifts this tradeoff in favor of discrimination. Increasing the 
318 
separation of concepts in a psychological and neural semantic space would make concepts more 
319 
discriminable. We show that people averse to uncertainty are indeed less affected by interference between 
320 
similar semantic representations and show improved discrimination between concepts. Simultaneously, 
321 
they are also less able to generalize behaviors between similar concepts. In other words, uncertainty 
322 
aversion leads to people making their world more compartmentalized, trading off generalization in favor 
323 
of better discriminability and lower uncertainty.   
324 
Important open questions remain. First, does semantic expansion preferentially shape concepts 
325 
that are closer together, or generally influence the whole representation? When the structure of semantic 
326 
representation was measured (Experiments 1 and 2), we found no direct evidence that the expansion

13 
effect is greater for similar concepts. On the other hand, in Experiments 3 and 4, people averse to 
328 
uncertainty exhibited greater semantic discrimination (Experiment 3) and poorer generalization 
329 
(Experiment 4), especially for very similar concepts. It is possible that the different task demands in these 
330 
latter experiments made our measurements more sensitive for detecting the semantic expansion effect 
331 
with concepts that share increasing similarity, and future work can help arbitrate whether this is the case. 
332 
Second, might our findings be explained by expanding the dimensionality of the representation? Previous 
333 
theoretical work has argued that the dimensionality of a representation controls a tradeoff between 
334 
discriminability and generalizability23, and indeed, an increase in dimensionality would result in greater 
335 
separability. In line with this view, we found that those averse to uncertainty had higher discriminability 
336 
(and thus lower uncertainty) at the cost of poorer generalizability (Experiments 3 and 4). However, we 
337 
found no direct evidence that uncertainty aversion is associated with higher dimensionality (Experiments 
338 
1 and 2, see Supplementary Figures 3 & 4). It is possible that, given the low dimensionality of the 
339 
representational structures that we examined, and the poor sensitivity of current dimensionality measures, 
340 
our analysis was not sufficiently powered to detect higher dimensionality for people averse to uncertainty, 
341 
which leaves it as an open question for future work.  
342 
Research has investigated how diverse experiences alter mental and neural representations, 
343 
mostly by measuring different levels of expertise (e.g., trained musicians vs. non-musicians59). Rather 
344 
than showing how different experiences shape neural representations, the semantic-expansion hypothesis 
345 
proposes that differences can originate even when people share the same experience. Based on the notion 
346 
that those averse to uncertainty are more likely to adopt strategies that decrease uncertainty and increase 
347 
identifiability, we have demonstrated that this stable personality trait predicts a more distal structure of 
348 
semantic representations—a mechanism that could be applied across domains (e.g., animals, objects) and 
349 
cognitive processes (e.g., perception).

Methods 
352 
All experiments were approved by Local University’s Institutional Review Board. 
353 
 
354 
Experiment 1 
355 
Participants. 108 people participated in the experiment on Prolific. 5 participants were excluded after 
356 
they failed to pass an attention check at the end of the experiment, resulting in a final sample of 103 
357 
participants (47 women, 51 men, 3 non-binary, and 2 transgender; mean age 34, SD = 12).  
358 
 
359 
Word Stimuli. For consistency, we selected a subset of words that were also used in Experiment 2, which 
360 
were originally selected to address an orthogonal research question. Apart from these words, we identified 
361 
other words that the target words could be compared with. To do this, we searched through lists of 
362 
abstract words and selected 48 words that we i) classified as abstract (e.g., life, system), ii) were 
363 
comprehensible, and iii) varied in how similar they were to each other. A table with these words can be 
364 
found in the supplementary material with their summary characteristics. 
365 
 
366 
Procedure. Participants completed 672 relatedness ratings between 16 target words and 42 comparison 
367 
words on a scale from 1 (not related) to 9 (very related). The target and comparison words were presented 
368 
on the screen simultaneously and participants then judged to what extent they were related. The 
369 
instructions did not ask subjects to focus on a specific semantic domain. Words were selected to be 
370 
relatively abstract: freedom, family, choice (see full list in the Supplementary Material). Following this 
371 
task, participants’ uncertainty attitudes were captured using the 27-item Intolerance of Uncertainty scale 
372 
as well as demographic information. The experiment lasted around 40 minutes and participants received 
373 
$4.50 as compensation.   
374 
 
375 
Experiment 2  
376 
Participants. 44 participants, all of whom were right-handed (17 women and 27 men and; mean age 32, 
377 
SD = 14) participated in the experiment. The data analyzed here was collected as a part of a larger study 
378 
exploring the neural mechanisms of intolerance to uncertainty. Participants provided informed consent 
379 
and received $40 as monetary compensation.  
380 
 
381 
Procedure. Participants completed a battery of tasks inside and outside the MRI scanner. Before the MRI 
382 
scanning session began, participants provided basic demographic information and completed a list of 
383 
questionnaires including the 27-item Intolerance of Uncertainty scale9. The scanning session lasted 
384 
approximately 1.5 hours, in which they completed a Word Reading Task and a Video Watching Task (not

analyzed in this research). After the scanning session, participants completed other questionnaires and 
386 
tasks that were also not analyzed for this research.   
387 
 
388 
Word Reading Task. The word reading task was conducted inside the MRI scanner. The task consisted of 
389 
6 runs, each made up of 80 trials. In every run, 60 unique words were individually presented on the center 
390 
of the screen without any accompanying context. Each trial stimulus was presented for 2.5s with a fixed 
391 
inter stimulus interval of 2.5s during which only a fixation cross appeared on the screen. 20 null-trials 
392 
were added in which only a fixation cross was shown to improve the efficiency of the design for 
393 
estimating stimulus evoked activity to each word. The trial order was randomized, and the words were 
394 
presented in black font on a white background screen. To maintain participant’s attention, participants had 
395 
to indicate if they believed the word presented was political or non-political by pressing one of two 
396 
response buttons. Total run duration was approximately 6 minutes and each participant completed 6 runs.  
397 
 
398 
fMRI acquisition and preprocessing. MR images were collected on a Siemens Prisma Fit 3-Tesla 
399 
research-dedicated scanner. T2*-weighted functional scans were acquired using a multi-slice sequence 
400 
capturing three slices at once to ensure whole-brain coverage with short repetition time (TR = 1500 ms). 
401 
60 3-mm transverse slices were acquired, each with 64x64 voxels of 3.0 mm isotropic, building up a field 
402 
of view (FOV) that covered the entire brain except part of the cerebellum. The FOV was tilted upward by 
403 
25 degrees at the front of the brain to minimize tissue gradient-related signal dropout in the orbitofrontal 
404 
cortex. Contrast settings were optimized for cortical grey matter (TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 86°). T1-
405 
weighted anatomical scans were acquired using a standard MPRAGE sequence (160 sagittal slices with 
406 
256x256 voxels of 1.0 mm isotropic, TR = 1900 ms, TE = 3.02 ms, flip angle = 9°). Preprocessing was 
407 
performed using fMRIPrep 1.5.1rc260 (RRID:SCR_016216), which is based on Nipype 1.3.0-rc160,61 
408 
(RRID:SCR_002502). 
409 
 
410 
Anatomical data preprocessing. The T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity non-
411 
uniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection62, distributed with ANTs 2.2.063 (RRID:SCR_004757), and 
412 
used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow. The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a 
413 
Nipype implementation of the antsBrainExtraction.sh workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as 
414 
target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-
415 
matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast64 (FSL 5.0.9, RRID:SCR_002823). 
416 
Volume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed 
417 
through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), using brain-extracted versions of both 
418 
T1w reference and the T1w template. The following template was selected for spatial normalization:

422 
Functional data preprocessing. The following preprocessing was performed for each of the BOLD runs 
423 
per participant. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom 
424 
methodology of fMRIPrep. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using 
425 
FLIRT66 (FSL 5.0.9) with the boundary-based registration67 cost-function. Co-registration was configured 
426 
with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. Head-motion 
427 
parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation 
428 
and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt68 (FSL 5.0.9). 
429 
BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 2016020769 (RRID:SCR_005927). The 
430 
BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original 
431 
native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility 
432 
distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series referred to preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD time-series 
433 
were resampled into standard space, generating a preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym 
434 
space. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise 
435 
displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD and DVARS are calculated for each 
436 
functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype70. The three global signals are extracted within 
437 
the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks.  
438 
 
439 
Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise 
440 
correction (CompCor71). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed 
441 
BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: 
442 
temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the 
443 
top 5% variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is obtained 
444 
by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aCompCor, 
445 
components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and 
446 
WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run 
447 
(using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). Components are also calculated separately within the 
448 
WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the k components with the largest singular 
449 
values are retained, such that the retained components’ time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of 
450 
variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal)72. The remaining components are 
451 
dropped from consideration.

The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding 
454 
confounds file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were 
455 
expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each73. Frames that exceeded 
456 
a threshold of 1.0 mm FD were annotated as motion outliers. All resamplings can be performed with a 
457 
single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e., head-motion transform 
458 
matrices and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). The data were not susceptibility distortion 
459 
corrected in the absence of fieldmaps. The Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using 
460 
antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects 
461 
of other kernels74. Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer). 
462 
 
463 
fMRI data cleaning. For the word reading task, two exclusion criteria were used. First, we excluded runs 
464 
in which there were excessive motion artifacts, defined as a framewise displacement greater than 1 mm in 
465 
more than 10% of the repetition times. Second, runs in which participants did not press the response 
466 
button because of experimenter error or a lack of attention were also excluded. This resulted in a total 
467 
exclusion of 8 runs from 6 participants (on average 1.3 runs per participant and not more than 2 runs for 
468 
each participant, which leaves at least 4 presentations of each word for each participant) and the exclusion 
469 
of one participant all together, leading to a final inclusion of 43 participants for the statistical fMRI 
470 
analyses.  
471 
 
472 
Statistical fMRI analysis.  
 
473 
Regions of Interest (ROI). Based on previous research on semantic processing27–32, we defined our ROIs 
474 
as the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), angular gyrus (AG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), anterior 
475 
temporal cortex (ATC), and perihinal cortex. The LIFG was defined using the Triangular and Opercular 
476 
part of the LIFG, as stipulated by the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas75. The AAL atlas was 
477 
also used to demarcate the AG, MTG, and ATC. The perirhinal cortex was defined as Brodmann Area 35 
478 
and 36. We also had a priori ROIs related to uncertainty6,34–38, which included the ventromedial prefrontal 
479 
cortex (VMPFC) and precuneus—which were also demarcated using the AAL.  
480 
 
481 
Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). For every participant, a General Linear Model (GLM) was 
482 
constructed using SPM12 in MatlabR2017b, in which every word that was presented in the word reading 
483 
task was modelled as a separate regressor yoked the duration of stimulus display. Motion was regressed 
484 
using 6 motion directions, their first derivatives, their squares, and the first derivatives of the squares. In 
485 
addition, the CompCor physiological regressors described above were included as covariates for 
486 
denoising. Fitting this model to the data yielded a beta map per run, per word. The beta values for each

voxel were extracted for each ROI. The RSA Toolbox76 (http://github.com/rsagroup/rsatoolbox) was then 
488 
used to compute, for each participant and ROI, a neural representation dissimilarity matrix (RDM) using 
489 
the cross-validated Mahalanobis distance between all word pairs. This measure incorporates multivariate 
490 
noise normalization and cross-validation, which leads to higher reliability of the neural distance 
491 
estimates39.  
492 
 
493 
Testing for semantic expansion. To investigate whether intolerance of uncertainty expands the neural 
494 
representation of semantics, we adopted a linear mixed-effects model in which the neural representational 
495 
dissimilarity of each word pair was regressed by uncertainty attitudes and semantic dissimilarity as 
496 
captured by GloVe. A neural RDM by for each ROI was computed using the approach described above.  
497 
A model RDM containing the pairwise dissimilarity in semantic dissimilarity was created by computing 
498 
the difference between semantic similarity scores obtained from GloVe. The neural RDM was vectorized, 
499 
z-scored, and included in the regression model. All others factors included in the regression model were 
500 
also z-scored. The main effects of IUS and semantic dissimilarity and the interaction between the two was 
501 
tested predicting the vectorized, scaled, neural dissimilarity patterns in the ROIs, with participant included 
502 
as a random intercept77.  
503 
 
504 
Semantic ambiguity analysis. To investigate whether intolerance of uncertainty modulates how semantic 
505 
ambiguity is processed, we adopted a linear mixed-effects model in which the neural representational 
506 
dissimilarity of each word pair was regressed by uncertainty attitudes and semantic ambiguity. A neural 
507 
RDM for each ROI was computed using the approach described above.  A model RDM containing the 
508 
pairwise dissimilarity in semantic ambiguity was created by computing the difference between semantic 
509 
ambiguity scores obtained from the English Lexicon Project Web Site78 (https://elexicon.wustl.edu/). The 
510 
neural RDM was vectorized, z-scored, and included in the regression model. All others factors included in 
511 
the regression model were also z-scored. The main effects of IUS and semantic ambiguity and the 
512 
interaction between the two was tested predicting the vectorized, scaled, neural dissimilarity patterns in 
513 
the ROIs, with participant included as a random intercept77.

Words Stimuli. Concepts were selected to be relatively abstract and include a mix of relatively similar

(e.g., status-class) and dissimilar (e.g., ambiguity-peculiarity) new and old words.

Procedure. Participants were first presented with a word and a fractal and were told that these two stimuli 
525 
were associated. After this, participants were asked to judge the likelihood that 10 other words were also 
526 
associated with the same fractal on a scale from 1 (not likely) to 7 (very likely). Participants completed 5 
527 
blocks of this task. At the beginning of each block, a new fractal was associated with a new word, and 
528 
participants had to judge the association between the fractal and 10 new, comparison words. In total, they 
529 
completed 50 trials of this task for a total presentation of 50 comparison words. A surprise recognition 
530 
test was then administered. In total, participants were presented with 100 words (50 old, 50 foils, for a 
531 
subset of participants, a coding error made the presented foils to be only 48), and had to indicate whether 
532 
they had seen this word before (Yes or No). Finally, participants were asked to judge the similarity 
533 
between the 50 word-pairs that they saw in the associative task on a scale from 1 (not similar) to 7 (very 
534 
similar). Again, uncertainty attitudes were collected using the IUS scale together with demographic 
535 
information. The experiment lasted around 15 minutes and participants received $2 as compensation.   
536 
 
537 
Analysis procedure. A mixed-effect binomial regression was performed on the probability of falsely 
538 
recognizing a lure (1=yes, 0=no) predicted by the maximum similarity of the old words for each lure, 
539 
uncertainty attitudes, and the interaction between the two. Subject and word item were both added as 
540 
independent random intercepts. 
541 
 
542 
Experiment 4  
543 
Participants. 221 participants were run on Prolific. 13 participants were removed since they failed to pass 
544 
an attention check at the end of the experiment, 9 participants were removed because their average 
545 
accuracy in the learning phase was lower than 70%, and 2 participants were removed because their 
546 
average reaction time in the generalization task was lower than 500 milliseconds, totaling in 197 
547 
participants (94 women, 97 men, 6 non-binary; mean age 29, SD = 6). 
548 
 
549 
Procedure. The experiment consisted of two phases, a learning and a generalization phase. In the learning 
550 
phase, participants learned the association between four pictures cueing different concepts (e.g., jellyfish, 
551 
chair, canoe) and four keys (e.g., “d”, “f”, “j”, “k”). On each trial, a picture was presented and participants 
552 
pressed one of the four keys. Immediately after, participants received feedback regarding whether the 
553 
selected key was the one associated with the concept. Participants responded to 20 trials for each 
554 
association-pair in a pseudo-randomized order. After learning, participants completed the generalization

20 
phase, in which new pictures of other concepts were presented and participants had to decide whether to 
556 
select one of the old keys or the space bar that represented a “no response”. Two concepts were selected 
557 
for each of the four target concepts, one that was very semantically close to the target (e.g., chair-stool), 
558 
and another one that was semantically further (e.g., chair-curtain), for a total of eight pictures depicting 
559 
eight different concepts. Each picture was presented twice in a pseudo-randomized order. In total, 
560 
participants completed two independent blocks of learning and generalization phase for a total of 8 pair-
561 
associates (see Supplementary Material for the list of concepts presented). Presentation order was 
562 
counterbalanced across participants. At the end of the experiment, uncertainty attitudes were collected 
563 
using the IUS scale together with demographic information. The experiment lasted around 15 minutes and 
564 
participants received $2 as compensation.   
565 
 
566 
Analysis procedure. A mixed-effect binomial regression was performed on the probability of 
567 
generalization (1=yes, 0=no) predicted by the similarity of the new concept with the target concept, 
568 
uncertainty attitudes, and the interaction between the two. Subject and category were both added as 
569 
independent random intercepts.
