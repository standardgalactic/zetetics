INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following research is a historical and philosophical study on the birth and epistemology of a scientific 
hypothesis – the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis is a recently formulated scientific hypothesis advanced by the 
Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), a stratigraphy-oriented research group of multidisciplinary 
membership established by the Subcommission of Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) in the summer of 2009. 
The group was assembled to assess whether sufficient stratigraphic evidence exists to warrant formal 
ratification of an Anthropocene time unit in the geological time scale and international chronostratigraphic 
chart.1 Such a unit would be defined and characterized by the stratigraphic footprint of Homo sapiens in the 
geological records. The hypothesis that the group has been advancing is that, indeed, sufficient stratigraphic 
markers of anthropogenic origin do exist to grant formal recognition of an Anthropocene Epoch/Series. 
This would also imply ending the Holocene Epoch (and thus the Meghalayan Age) – the current and 
officially recognized geological epoch. The proposed beginning for this post-Holocene epoch would be 
located around the 1950s. This time frame coincides with a range of stratigraphic markers, in particular 
geochemical markers associated with nuclear and thermonuclear atomic bomb testing, detectable in core 
samples collected from environmental archives around the world. The hypothesis has ignited a wide range 
of debates across academia and among the public over the meaning, validity, utility, and broader social and 
ethical implications of formalizing the Anthropocene as an anthropogenically induced unit of geological 
time. 
 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis is the stratigraphic formulation or ‘variant’ of the broader 
‘Anthropocene’ concept. The term ‘Anthropocene’ has a long prehistory (and paleohistory), but in its 
modern usage it was first coined by chemist and Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen in late February 2000, during 
 
1 Since the present research will repeatedly engage with geological time, the latest version (i.e., v2021/07) of the 
international chronostratigraphic chart / geological time scale is provided in the Appendix for reference. 

INTRODUCTION

a Scientific Committee meeting of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme in Cuernavaca, 
Mexico. The term gradually made its way through academia, until after 2009 it generated a surge of interest 
that saw the proliferation of ‘Anthropocene’-related publications, initiatives, conferences, university classes, 
exhibitions, artistic expressions, and more. A large number of scholars, especially in the human and social 
sciences, have engaged with the term by dissecting and deconstructing its meaning, assumptions, and 
rhetoric. Some have reformulated the notion under different terminological variants, such as the 
‘Capitalocene,’ ‘Novacene,’ ‘Pyrocene,’ or ‘Technocene’ – to name only a few. The major outcome of this 
surge in interest is that the research that has emerged from this multidisciplinary interaction provides a 
broad spectrum of viewpoints for investigating the ‘Anthropocene’ as a polysemantic object.  
 
However, this remarkable swell in popularity has also made it problematic to define the 
‘Anthropocene’ in a multifunctional way – a problem this research frames as the ‘issue of definition.’ This 
is a particularly relevant predicament when contextualized in the broader discourse of a cultural chasm 
between humanities and social sciences on the one end, and the natural sciences on the other end – a divide 
similar to what physicist and novelist Charles Percy Snow famously described in the late 1950s in terms of 
‘two cultures.’ Indeed, ‘Anthropocene’ scholars (e.g., Bostic & Howey, 2017; Ellis, 2016a; Horn & 
Bergthaller, 2020; Toivanen et al., 2017) have already observed forms of disengagement, isolation, or even 
antagonism seemingly replicating this intellectual and cultural segregation. 
 
A solution to this problem (i.e., the issue of definition) is advanced in this research. The solution 
consists of distinguishing between the ‘Anthropocene’ as a boundary object and the Anthropocene Hypothesis: 
the former corresponds to a boundary object of multidisciplinary meaning and use, and the latter represents 
the particular stratigraphic (or geological) formulation of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Recent scholarship (Thomas 
et al., 2020; Zalasiewicz et al., 2018; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b; Zalasiewicz et al., 2021) has advanced a similar 
distinction to clarify the purpose and meaning of the ‘geological Anthropocene’ or ‘stratigraphical 
Anthropocene’ as a discrete and delimited research agenda. However, it is recognized that this distinction, 
and the semantic tension within it, has not yet been thoroughly examined – especially from the standpoint 
of the philosophical analysis of scientific knowledge. 
 
This distinction frames the central object of analysis of the present research – that is, the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. Justifying and articulating this conceptual separation in a way that is useful and 
replicable in academic as well as public discourse is one of the main targets of the present endeavor. Indeed, 
the study implements this distinction as a premise while simultaneously explaining the epistemic advantages 
and practical benefits of adopting this stance. 
 
Attempting to legitimize and delineate a theoretical separation between ‘Anthropocene’ and 
Anthropocene Hypothesis is the first goal of the research. The second goal is to answer two interrelated 
questions stemming consequentially from the first goal, namely, What is the Anthropocene Hypothesis? and What 
does it mean for the Anthropocene Hypothesis to represent a scientific hypothesis? 
 
The first question emerges naturally from the distinction advanced. If the hypothesis is to be treated 
as a discrete theoretical entity related to, but conceptually distinct from, the ‘Anthropocene,’ then those 

3 
 
epistemic properties defining the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a separate entity need to be identified. Such 
properties should warrant necessary and sufficient reasons for treating the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a 
discrete theoretical object distinct from the ‘Anthropocene,’ beyond merely representing an interpretation 
of the latter. 
 
The second question relates to the nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. It is argued that the 
hypothesis represents a scientific hypothesis, specifically a stratigraphic hypothesis. As a scientific hypothesis, 
it exhibits epistemic virtues (e.g., intelligibility, utility, explanatory power) traditionally discussed, defined, 
and ascribed by philosophers of science to scientific praxis and thought. As a stratigraphic hypothesis, it 
reflects the production of scientific ideas according to the specific epistemic context wherein the hypothesis 
situates – that is, stratigraphic research. These are among the epistemic characteristics that distinguish the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis from the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, and that make the hypothesis an object of 
interest in the philosophy of science – particularly the philosophy of geology. This is an important point, 
in that philosophy of science has fundamentally been only a minor voice both in the ‘Anthropocene’ and 
Anthropocene Hypothesis debates. In a way, this research encourages further commitment from the 
philosophy of science community to the epistemology of stratigraphic classification, and to the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific idea. 
 
Studying the birth and epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis is considered a suitable strategy 
for providing satisfactory answers to both questions. But what precisely does it mean to study the ‘birth’ 
and ‘epistemology’ of the Anthropocene Hypothesis? How can these aspects help answer the questions 
posed above? 
 
Reconstructing the birth of the hypothesis means identifying those circumstances that led a group 
of geologists to consider defining the ‘Anthropocene’ on stratigraphic grounds. This requires probing into 
the historical, intellectual, disciplinary, and social context in which the hypothesis was generated. As 
anticipated, the Anthropocene Hypothesis represents a particular interpretation of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept. This means that understanding the origins of the Anthropocene Hypothesis requires 
understanding how the ‘Anthropocene’ concept evolved across the academic, and particularly the scientific, 
landscape during the term’s early years of existence. It also requires understanding the broader context that 
the ‘Anthropocene’ has engendered over the past decade, namely, the new knowledge domain of 
Anthropocene Studies. Representing a discrete theoretical entity does not imply that the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis is entirely removed from the broader discourses gravitating around the ‘Anthropocene.’ On the 
contrary, it may be argued that the hypothesis is situated at the epicenter of such discourse and debate. 
Therefore, it is important to frame the context surrounding and preceding the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
to understand the nature and meaning of the hypothesis as a scientific and stratigraphic hypothesis. 
 
Studying the epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis means delineating those central 
knowledge statements underpinning the identity of the hypothesis as well as determining which (if any) 
epistemic virtues characterize the hypothesis. These knowledge statements can be extrapolated from 
research material articulating the methodological, theoretical, and empirical outline of the hypothesis, and

then reformulated in philosophical terms. They are expressed in various forms, from normative-
methodological (e.g., what constitutes geological evidence for the hypothesis, which norms of stratigraphic 
classification the hypothesis adheres to or challenges, etc.) to descriptive-observational (e.g., empirical 
evidence). Analyzing these statements grants deeper insight into their logical and semantic implications, 
providing conceptual and semantic clarification in addition to offering critical viewpoints of methodological 
and theoretical utility. Assessing whether a certain set of epistemic virtues can be identified ensures the 
theoretical legitimacy (sensu lato) of the hypothesis as a scientific hypothesis. This is particularly important 
because the very stratigraphic nature as well as scientificity of the hypothesis has been questioned from 
both inside and outside the stratigraphic and geological community. The research attempts to show that, 
indeed, the hypothesis does exhibit some epistemic virtues that allow it to be characterized (from a 
philosophical standpoint) as a scientific hypothesis. 
 
Philosophical analysis in the form of conceptual and linguistic analysis is the primary means to 
achieve the targets set in this research. However, as philosopher Wesley Salmon (1982) once stated, 
“philosophy which remains out of contact with other disciplines runs the great risk of becoming quite 
sterile” (p. 282). This means that philosophy alone cannot thoroughly investigate the range of factors 
characterizing the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific hypothesis without the risk of falling into 
abstract ideas of science detached from the ‘practical’ fabric of scientific knowledge. The hypothesis is part 
of a social, historical, and scientific context that has epistemic significance in informing and influencing its 
formulation as well as its scientific status. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach defines the operating method 
of the present research. This method incorporates quantitative and qualitative linguistics, methods of 
stratigraphic and geological classification, conceptual history, and history of science. Each of these 
disciplinary areas provides methods considered adequate means for investigating the birth and epistemology 
of the hypothesis in question. The particular methods used, and the problems they tackle, are discussed in 
their respective chapters and sections. 
 
The underlying tone of this research is primarily descriptive. It seeks to explore the origins and 
nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific hypothesis based on meticulously scrutinized data. 
It refrains from judging whether the proposed epoch should or should not be formalized, or whether formal 
ratification of an Anthropocene unit would be beneficial for science and society at large. However, because 
utter objectivity is methodologically unattainable, limited portions of the research make assertions whose 
intent surpasses description. This is particularly the case concerning accusations of ideological science 
behind the Anthropocene Hypothesis, but it also pertains to ascribing certain epistemic virtues to the 
hypothesis, the scope and aim of the hypothesis, its novelty in geological research, and its overall legitimacy 
as a scientific hypothesis. Here, some arguments are advanced that take a stance in favor of the recognition 
of Anthropocene Hypothesis as a legitimate, and unprecedent in its kind, scientific hypothesis. The 
implications of embracing this viewpoint are also discussed. 
 
The research is structured as five chapters, followed by the conclusion and an appendix. Each 
chapter raises questions whose answers are indispensable in tackling the central goals of this research. 

5 
 
 
Chapter 1 frames the broader multidisciplinary framework of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. The 
following questions are raised: What is the ‘Anthropocene’? What distinguishes it from the Anthropocene Hypothesis? 
What use is it to distinguish between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis? To answer these questions, 
the chapter investigates the recently established field of Anthropocene Studies and the main research 
trajectories informing it. Anthropocene Studies represents a multi- and interdisciplinary field of knowledge 
converging in the study of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a global phenomenon of an anthropogenic nature. After 
exploring the primary research trajectories informing this nascent field of inquiry, the theoretical and 
practical distinction between the ‘Anthropocene’ as a boundary object and the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
as a stratigraphic variant is advanced. This separation underpins the rest of the research, delimiting its scope 
of inquiry to the Anthropocene Hypothesis, but also enabling an analysis of the semantic tensions between 
these two theoretical units.  
 
Chapter 2 reconstructs the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis through complementary 
quantitative and qualitative analyses. The following questions are raised: What happened during the early history 
of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept? How was the term used, and by whom? How did the ‘Anthropocene’ engender the birth of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis? To answer these questions, the chapter probes into the early history of the 
‘Anthropocene’ by surveying a corpus of literature using the term during its first decade of existence (i.e., 
2000–2009). From a quantitative standpoint, the research uses text mining techniques to identify salient 
properties of a corpus of 670 written records. This analysis provides a quantitative overview of the early 
history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept in academic literature. From a qualitative viewpoint, a selected pool 
of texts is analyzed through discourse analysis. These texts are considered emblematic of the ways the term 
‘Anthropocene’ was perceived, assimilated, and used. Additionally, the qualitative analysis uses personal 
communication with authors who played a role in the assimilation and popularization of the term. 
Reconstructing the early history of the ‘Anthropocene’ is considered a necessary precondition for 
reconstructing the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Chapter 3 explores and discusses the empirical body that makes the Anthropocene Hypothesis a 
stratigraphic hypothesis, and it reviews alternative and competing hypotheses. The following questions are 
raised: What is the empirical body of the Anthropocene Hypothesis? What alternative stratigraphic, and broader scientific, 
proposals have advocated for a scientifically useful ‘Anthropocene’? The latest scientific evidence gathered by the 
research gravitating around the AWG is surveyed to answer the former question. The survey is paralleled 
to an examination of the basic definitions, principles, and procedures of stratigraphic classification which 
inform the epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Then, the panorama of extant scientific 
hypotheses about the ‘Anthropocene’ and its beginning is discussed. Locating the beginning of the 
proposed unit has been one of the most discussed aspects of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Therefore, 
discussing the spectrum of alternative proposals is considered a necessary ingredient in framing the 
epistemology of the proposal advanced by the AWG. 
 
Chapter 4 delineates an epistemological outline (in a strict sense) of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
The following questions are raised: What are the epistemological implications of considering the Anthropocene Hypothesis

a scientific hypothesis? Which epistemic virtues (if any) does the Anthropocene Hypothesis exhibit that are traditionally 
defined by philosophers of science? What does extant philosophical scholarship have to say about the ‘Anthropocene’ and the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis? Answering these questions requires first framing the reception of the 
‘Anthropocene’ in extant philosophical scholarship, assessing which philosophical domains absorbed the 
‘Anthropocene’ as a philosophical category. Particular attention is given to the apparent lack of interest 
from philosophy of science in either the ‘Anthropocene’ or the Anthropocene Hypothesis. After reasons 
informing this circumstance are given, a few contributions from the philosophy of science are discussed. 
Subsequently, influential models in philosophy of science are used to determine whether or not the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis exhibits epistemic characteristics and virtues commonly said to define science 
and scientific knowledge. These models focus primarily on the epistemology of historical hypotheses, and 
on the nature of scientific explanation and scientific understanding. 
 
Lastly, Chapter 5 focuses on the critical debates about the ‘Anthropocene’ concept and the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis that have emerged over the past decade. The following questions are raised: 
What arguments have been advanced against the ‘Anthropocene’ and its stratigraphic interpretation? What difference is there 
between arguments against the ‘Anthropocene’ and those against the Anthropocene Hypothesis? Which aspects of the hypothesis 
have been particularly contested? These questions are answered by converging and unifying independent lines of 
critique into single and easily identifiable arguments. The chapter explores how each of these identified 
arguments relates to the ‘Anthropocene’ or the Anthropocene Hypothesis, thus providing a roadmap to 
navigate the multiple lines of critique advanced in Anthropocene Studies. This is a useful endeavor not 
merely in strengthening the conceptual separation posited in this research, but also in asking whether 
arguments against the ‘Anthropocene’ equally hold against the Anthropocene Hypothesis. In particular, the 
arguments against the Anthropocene Hypothesis are scrutinized and discussed in light of their role in 
negotiating the evidence, and in light of the broader epistemology of hypothesis. 
 
The research aims to contribute mainly to three areas of academic scholarship. First, it is a 
contribution to the history and philosophy of science, for which it serves a twofold purpose. On the one hand, it 
represents a case study of the birth and epistemology of a scientific hypothesis, specifically a stratigraphic 
hypothesis. Several applications could emerge from it – for instance, by comparing it to the emergence of 
similar scientific hypotheses, or by framing it within larger theoretical discourses on science. On the other 
hand, it encourages scholars in the history and philosophy of science to contribute to the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis debates. In doing so, it also promotes interest in the philosophy of geology, a largely 
underrepresented discipline in extant philosophy of science. Indeed, this knowledge domain is considered 
crucial in developing philosophical analyses of the Anthropocene Hypothesis because of its focus on the 
epistemology of geology. Nevertheless, this domain still remains a largely uncharted territory. 
 
Second, it represents a contribution to Anthropocene Studies, a nascent field of inquiry gravitating 
around the ‘Anthropocene’ as a hub concept framing the present anthropogenic impact on the planet. The 
term has established itself as a successful category among academics as well as the public, which suggests 
that, regardless of the final outcome of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, the term may be here to stay. If this 

7 
 
is the case, then an analysis elucidating the conceptual relationship between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis can only be beneficial in providing tools to further explore the semantic 
territories this term has to offer.  
 
The third contribution is to interdisciplinary research. The interdisciplinary methods of inquiry adopted 
here make the overall endeavor an example of interdisciplinary work – and hopefully a successful one. 
Despite interdisciplinary research being “widely considered a hothouse for innovation, and the only 
plausible approach to complex problems such as climate change” (Bromham et al., 2016, p. 684), it still 
faces major difficulties primarily related to funding opportunities. University-based segregation of 
disciplines and issues inherent in developing functional models of interdisciplinarity (Heikkurinen et al., 
2016; Inkpen & DesRoches, 2019; Toivanen et al., 2017) are also major obstacles to launching 
interdisciplinary projects. Amidst these practical and theoretical difficulties, perhaps the best remedy is to 
trial and error. Therefore, this study attempts to converge interdisciplinary methods of analysis. This is done 
without the aim of developing an interdisciplinary framework, but rather as an experiment that converges 
methods and theories across the disciplines at the forefront of research on both the ‘Anthropocene’ and 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Lastly, it should be noted that the history of the Anthropocene Hypothesis is still history in the 
making. The AWG is still presenting findings and results in support of the hypothesis, and a formal proposal 
to the International Commission of Stratigraphy is yet to be forwarded. Research on the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, and on the ‘Anthropocene’ at large, is currently being conducted. Necessarily, this makes this 
overall effort somewhat incomplete in respect to the ultimate fate of the proposal of formal stratigraphic 
recognition of an Anthropocene Epoch (or other unit levels). Nevertheless, abundant empirical as well as 
theoretical research has emerged from the Anthropocene Hypothesis to make a discrete analysis of the 
hypothesis not only feasible, but also useful – if not necessary. The present research develops on this broad 
range of research literature. 
 
If Homo sapiens has truly become a geological agent capable of leaving an indelible sign in the Earth’s 
geohistory, then the scientific arguments supporting this idea need proper consideration. This effort has a 
broader societal as well as existential significance in highlighting (more or less implicitly) the ontological 
role of humans in the past, present, and future history of the Earth.

CHAPTER 1 
FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What is this world on which we live? How did life arise here? What is our future? 
Among the myriad subjects of human curiosity and endeavor, 
 our Earth – its restless oceans and atmosphere, its shifting layers of rock and ice, 
 and its extraordinary variety of life –  
has always been a center of our attention.

The Anthropocene Hypothesis is one among several variants of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept – specifically, 
its stratigraphic or geological variant. Connecting sensitive discourses on historical responsibility, climate 
change, global warming, sustainability, and humans, the ‘Anthropocene’ has become an overarching social, 
political, and academic category for framing and discussing the present human–Earth relationship. A large 
pool of disciplines from different knowledge domains have used their knowledge, methods, and experience 
to dissect, deconstruct, shape, readapt, and transform the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. The present chapter 
seeks to frame the Anthropocene Hypothesis within this particularly explorative and still unfolding research 
landscape. In doing so, the object of the overall research is also delimited and defined. 
Hence, section 1.1 introduces the research landscape gravitating around the ‘Anthropocene’ idea. 
It provides a condensed overview of the global ‘Anthropocene’ research agenda, whose multidisciplinary 
effort has engendered the nascent field of Anthropocene Studies. An analysis of this in-the-making field of 
study is conducted based on the multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary (Balbo et al., 2020) reach of the 
‘Anthropocene’ idea. Connected to the emergence of this field of study, this section also introduces the 
issue of definition – an issue pertaining the multidisciplinary understanding, use, and application of the 
‘Anthropocene’ concept. Indeed, with the ‘Anthropocene’ as a theoretical entity shared amongst a wide

spectrum of disciplinary fields of knowledge, it is now difficult to encapsulate its meaning into a 
standardized definition without the risk of losing some of its distinctive nuances. 
Section 1.2 focuses on broader historical and geohistorical research trends that have emerged 
within Anthropocene Studies. Four discrete research trajectories are identified as engendering the 
multidisciplinary historical study of the ‘Anthropocene,’ namely, its history as a geological time unit, as an 
Earth System singularity, as a historical rupture, and as a theoretical entity. Each trajectory is analyzed 
individually by reviewing existing literature and providing additional critical remarks to the debate. 
Examining this literature is functional to locating this research as an attempt to study the conceptual history 
and epistemology of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a scientific idea. 
Finally, section 1.3 outlines the methodological and theoretical premises that are implemented. 
First, it distinguishes two general ways the ‘Anthropocene’ concept is implemented in extant research: as a 
descriptive ‘Anthropocene’ and a normative ‘Anthropocene.’ After framing the present research within the 
limits of the descriptive ‘Anthropocene,’ a separation between the ‘Anthropocene’ concept and the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis is promoted. Lastly, an explanation of the methodologies used to approach the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis is given. 
The research systematically highlights the ‘Anthropocene’ (with apostrophes) as a broader and 
polysemantic conceptual and linguistic category (within or outside natural sciences) to distinguish it both 
from the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and from the Anthropocene (without apostrophes) as a proposed unit 
of geological time. This linguistic remark should facilitate the theoretical distinction underpinning the aim 
of this overall endeavor as well clarify what conceptual unit is being treated throughout the sections. 
 
 
1.1 The ‘Anthropocene’ and Anthropocene Studies 
 
 
What is the ‘Anthropocene’?  
The ‘Anthropocene’ is a term used to identify a proposed geological time unit with disputed 
meanings and starting dates. The concept encompasses a diversified range of scientific evidence suggesting 
a departure from the Holocene Earth System conditions. The term was first popularized by Nobel laureate 
Paul Crutzen in 2000, later gaining momentum after a dedicated stratigraphic research group, the 
Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), was established in 2009 by the Subcommission on Quaternary 
Stratigraphy (SQS), part of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), itself part of the larger 
International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). The AWG has been tasked to examine whether 
sufficient evidence exists to warrant the possible recognition of the Anthropocene as a distinct unit of the 
international chronostratigraphic chart, which serves as basis for the geological time scale. In simpler words, 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE' AND ANTHROPOCENE STUDIES 
11 
 
the group is assessing whether the Earth is entering a new phase of its geological history – one marked by 
of human activities.  
The term has also seen usage among other scientific communities, where it emphasizes other 
aspects of the human–Earth relationship. For instance, in the Earth System science community, the 
‘Anthropocene’ is understood as a time interval of considerable anthropogenic disruption of Earth System 
functioning, beginning (at least) with the Industrial Revolution, and increasing markedly after the 1950s 
(Steffen et al., 2016; Steffen et al., 2020; Steffen et al., 2018). In ecology and evolutionary biology, the term 
is often found in literature addressing the ongoing sixth major extinction event in life’s documented history 
– one considered anthropogenic (Ceballos et al., 2017; Pena Rodrigues & Lira, 2019). Across scientific 
disciplines, the term is often used to frame environmental research on the local and global impact of humans 
on the Earth. 
These opening paragraphs briefly summarize the scientific research revolving around the 
‘Anthropocene.’ This research provides a scientific understanding of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a geological time 
unit, as an Earth System singularity, or as an event in the Earth’s life history. However, the ‘Anthropocene’ 
debate is not utterly exhausted by and within the scientific research agendas. Scientific understanding 
constitutes but one form of understanding of the ‘Anthropocene’ among a landscape of possible 
‘understandings’ that authors have framed as the ‘Anthropo-scene’ (Castree, 2015; Lorimer, 2017). In the 
years following the popularization of the term, and the formation of the AWG, several disciplines outside 
the realm of the natural sciences have been critically approaching the term. This surge in multidisciplinary 
interest came especially from the humanities and social sciences, whose contributions to the ‘Anthropocene’ 
engendered a debate that has paved the way for additional narratives to those portrayed by the natural 
sciences (Bonneuil, 2015). Today, the term ‘Anthropocene’ does not merely reflect the geological signatures 
of humans on the planet – it mirrors the “general concept of accelerating human influences on Earth” 
(Chin et al., 2016, p. 1), and the social and cultural challenges that come with it. In the words of 
environmental historian Libby Robin (2014a), the ‘Anthropocene’ is not exclusively a scientific hypothesis: 
it has become a “metaphor for a changing society” (p. 19). 
Thus, understanding the ‘Anthropocene’ as a metaphor or ‘boundary object’2 requires an 
understanding of the disciplinary contexts, goals, and methods of analysis approaching this concept, and of 
how interplays within this network of knowledge shape its multiple definitions. During the past decade, 
this network has gradually begun to grow into a distinct field of study – namely, Anthropocene Studies.3 
This research zone is characterized, first and foremost, by its multidisciplinarity. As it will be explained in 
this subchapter, this aspect constitutes both a strength and a weakness. 
 
2 The term ‘boundary object’ is borrowed here from the traditional sociological sense provided by Susan Leigh Star 
and James R. Griesemer referring to an abstract or concrete object with different meanings in different social worlds, 
plastic enough to adapt to contexts but robust enough to maintain an identity (Star & Griesemer, 1989). The 
designation is not embraced to discuss the core object of this present research (the Anthropocene Hypothesis), but it 
considered suitable to explain the nature of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept (discussed later in section 1.3.2). 
3 The designation ‘Anthropocene Studies’ does not follow the apostrophizing criteria set at the beginning of the 
chapter. 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

1.1.1 Anthropocene Studies 
 
The trans-, inter-, and multidisciplinary4 study of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a broader geological, historical, 
cultural, and social phenomenon (Toivanen et al., 2017) is the central aim of the emerging academic field 
of Anthropocene Studies. This inchoate, “scholarship-in-the-making” (Swanson et al., 2015) research 
landscape aims at debating, researching, teaching, and representing the ‘Anthropocene’ in its every aspect, 
from geological time unit and Earth System disruption to socio-historical transition, intellectual 
provocation, and cultural, artistic, religious (Bedford-Strohm, 2017), and popular phenomenon. This 
multidisciplinary effort is horizontal, meaning no discipline sits on the sideline or as ancillary to another; 
political, meaning the research conducted does not passively describe the ‘Anthropocene’ but seeks to 
inform policy makers and the public (Bostic & Howey, 2017); and educational, insofar as it promotes 
educational programs advocating environmental awareness and societal transformation (Adorno, 2020; 
Leinfelder, 2013).  
 
Historian Christophe Bonneuil identifies four ‘grand narratives’ informing the ‘Anthropocene’ and 
its study, namely, (1) the naturalist, which he considers the mainstream one, portrayed by the natural 
sciences and media; (2) the post-naturalist, mainly represented by the eco-pragmatist school of thought 
(Dalby, 2016); (3) the eco-catastrophist, portrayed by predictions of worldwide ecological collapse; and (4) 
the eco-Marxist, portrayed by the link between the Anthropocene and capitalism. Another outline of 
Anthropocene Studies is provided by Toivanen et al. (2017), focusing on four approaches rather than narratives 
– that is, the geological approach (based on stratigraphic evidence), the biological approach (based on the 
long-term impact of humans on the biosphere), the social approach (based on the historicization of the 
biological and stratigraphic approaches into a social context), and the cultural approach (based on creative 
and speculative understanding of the ‘Anthropocene’). 
Yet to establish itself as a fully institutionalized disciplinary domain or field of knowledge, 
Anthropocene Studies is fueled not exclusively by individual thinkers engaging with the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept, but also by the formation of research communities, online and publishing platforms, and dedicated 
projects worldwide. For instance, between 2013 and 2014, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW) of 
Berlin5 hosted a pioneering event in Europe – the Anthropocene Project6 (HKW, 2014) – connecting 
academics, independent researchers, and the public in a multidisciplinary and non-disciplinary conversation 
on the Anthropocene. Its main long-term outcome, the joint HKW–Max Planck Institute for the History 
of Science Anthropocene Curriculum, is an ongoing project exploring “pathways toward a new interdisciplinary 
culture of knowledge and education” (HKW, 2013). The strong educational motif of the Curriculum may be 
considered an important moment in the development of Anthropocene Studies. In the so-called ‘Science 
Station’ of Unter den Linden in Berlin, sixteen artistic panels by graphic designer Nele Brönne have been

exposed as representative of the ‘Anthropocene,’ including a panel (both in German and English) shortly 
explaining the meaning and implication of the ‘Anthropocene’ to the several thousands of daily Berliner 
Verkehrsbetriebe guests.7 
In the years following the establishment of the AWG, the Anthropocene also became an object of 
interest for environmental humanists (Castree, 2014b). Their primary focus has been retracing the 
(environmental) history of this proposed epoch, for instance, by stressing its colonial and capitalist matrix 
– bringing scholars to coin conceptual alternatives such as (among many) the Thanatocene (Bonneuil & 
Fressoz, 2016), Plantationocene (Haraway, 2015), or Capitalocene (Moore, 2016b),8 to name only a few – 
to highlight the historical mechanisms that caused the ‘Anthropocene.’9 Scholars from ecocriticism and 
postcolonial theory joined the conversation by addressing normative issues such as the ethical and moral 
implications of living in the ‘Anthropocene’ (Zylinska, 2014), the seemingly generalizing notion of Anthropos 
(from the Greek ἄνθρωπος, meaning ‘human’) implicit in the term ‘Anthropocene’ (Emmett & Lekan, 
2016), or the question concerning responsibility (Dalby, 2007b; Neimanis et al., 2015) and colonial thinking 
(Simpson, 2020). Social scientists too have addressed the term by considering the cultural-ladenness of the 
‘Anthropocene’ concept, while also criticizing it as a Western product of social forms of inequality based 
on “huge social, cultural and technological differences across time and space” (Ellis, 2016a, p. 192). Literary 
theorist Heidi Bostic and anthropologist Meghan Howey summarize Anthropocene research in the 
humanities and social sciences as a matter of questions asked: “Although defining the ‘when’ of the 
Anthropocene is important, the who, what, where and why are equally, if not more, compelling and 
challenging questions we [in the liberal arts] must ask” (Bostic & Howey, 2017, p. 105). 
Scholarly interest in the notion of the ‘Anthropocene’ has not limited itself to the mere interest of 
experts in geology, environmental history, or other disciplinary domains. University departments and 
research institutes have also begun to explore this uncharted territory by establishing dedicated research 
centers. Examples of such initiatives are the AURA (Aarhus University Research on the Anthropocene) 
project, hosted by Aarhus University in Denmark from September 2013 to December 2018; the Centre for 
Biogeochemistry in the Anthropocene, under the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the 
University of Oslo, launched in 2018; a Center of Anthropocene Studies (CAS) opened in June 2018 by the 
Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daedeok, South Korea; the Leverhulme Centre 
for Anthropocene Biodiversity in York, the product of a partnership between four different universities,10 
operating since November 2019; and a ‘Biodiverse Anthropocenes’ research program was launched in 2021, 
hosted by the University of Oulu. Since 2017, Department I of the Max Planck Institute for the History of 
 
7 The initiative is a joint project of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Schiel-Projektgesellschaft, the exhibition 
agency TheGreenEyl, and the Office for Precarious Concepts. As of September 3, 2021, the panels are still exposed. 
8 The term ‘Capitalocene’ is discussed separately in section 1.2.3; ‘Thanatocene’ stresses the overall effects of the 
military–industrial complex to the environment; and ‘Plantationocene’ underscores the “power relations and 
economic, environmental, and social inequalities” (Moore et al., 2020) engendering the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
9 A useful source with some of the terminological variants proposed thus far in Anthropocene Studies is provided by 
literary theorist Steven Mentz (2020), who mockingly entitled his blog article “The Neologismcene.”

University of York. 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

Science of Berlin has been hosting a research group dedicated to ‘Knowledge in and of the Anthropocene.’ 
The Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge offers a 11-month Master of Philosophy 
degree in Anthropocene Studies covering a wide transdisciplinary selection of topics, from 
dendrochronology and climatology to climate engineering and human migration. An MSc. program 
‘Strategy and Design for the Anthropocene’ is offered by the ESC Clermont Business School in France. 
Courses addressing several aspects of the ‘Anthropocene’ are now being offered worldwide, especially 
among Anglo-Saxon universities. The educational aspect of the ‘Anthropocene’ has now gained 
momentum, especially in disciplines concerning human–environment interactions such as environmental 
history (Adorno, 2020). 
Dedicated publishing platforms have also been developed in the past decade, from peer-reviewed 
journals to blogs and virtual exhibitions. As part of its mission to promote planetary awareness and foster 
stewardship, the website Globaïa11 was launched in 2009. In June 2012, Globaïa opened the United Nations 
Conference on Sustainable Development (otherwise known as Earth Summit or Rio+20) with a three-and-
a-half-minute-long video introducing the ‘Anthropocene’ – a “new geological epoch dominated by 
humanity” (Globaïa, 2012). In cooperation with other research institutions, Globaïa also launched the 
website Anthropocene.info on occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos and COP21 in Paris in 
2015. The website provides visitors with an interactive list of proposed starting dates for the Anthropocene 
in the larger context of the history of the genus Homo.12 
The first issue of Anthropocene – a journal by Elsevier – was published in September 2013 to advance 
“research on human interactions with Earth systems” (Chin et al., 2013, p. 1). Elementa: Science of the 
Anthropocene begun publishing in December 2013, focusing on the interaction between humans and natural 
systems from a physical, chemical, and biological point of view. In April 2014, The Anthropocene Review 
published its first issue, promoting the necessity “to communicate among disciplines and conceptual 
frameworks” (Oldfield et al., 2014, p. 5), and to foster interdisciplinary research on the Anthropocene. 
None of these journals emerged directly in support of the quest to formalize the Anthropocene on the 
geological time scale. Rather, they commonly understood the ‘Anthropocene’ as a broader phenomenon 
requiring diversified and interactive knowledge and platforms of research. As such, they laid the foundations 
for the emergence of Anthropocene Studies as an academic phenomenon characterized by “an ample 
transdisciplinary background, major philosophical questions and huge challenges and debates” (Hardt, 
2017, p. 9). In 2017, an Encyclopedia of the Anthropocene was published, and the term now features in major 
encyclopedias as well.13

12 Timeline available at http://www.anthropocene.info/anthropocene-timeline.php (accessed on June 14, 2020). The 
website also provides additional information on the Anthropocene from an Earth System science perspective (e.g., 
Great Acceleration graphs, Planetary Boundaries, etc.). 
13 Encyclopædia Britannica is an example. Interestingly, the Anthropocene is visually represented on the geological time 
scale under the entry ‘Geologic time’ (https://www.britannica.com/science/geologic-time, accessed on June 30, 
2020). Some early appearances of the term ‘Anthropocene’ in various scientific encyclopedias are mentioned later in 
section 2.1.3. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE' AND ANTHROPOCENE STUDIES 
15 
 
It is hard to assess how evenly ‘Anthropocene’ research is now distributed among the academic 
disciplines involved in Anthropocene Studies, and how much each individual discipline has contributed in 
the ‘Anthropocene’ debates. Social scientist Judith N. Hardt seems to consider Earth System science and 
positivistic epistemology to heavily inform Anthropocene Studies, a challenge that social and political 
sciences must face in developing a form of “anthropocene thinking” (Hardt, 2017, p. 8). Whereas this claim 
seems to suggest that natural science is dominating the debate, as also argued by other critics of the 
‘Anthropocene’ narrative (Bonneuil, 2015; Moore, 2016c), the recent years have seen humanities, social 
sciences, and arts engaging and shaping the term more than the natural sciences. This is confirmed by the 
spawning of terminological variants, each following a discrete research trajectory within the broader 
‘Anthropocene’ category. Simply overviewing the results of Googling ‘anthropocene cfp’ (i.e., ‘call for 
papers’) also shows a predominantly humanistic interest in the term (as of 2021). 
Determining how the various forms of multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinarity in Anthropocene 
Studies should be conducted in practice has remained an open question that has hardly found a commonly 
accepted solution so far. This issue has been clearly outlined by a team of humanists and social scientists 
working on multidisciplinarity. Based on a threefold modality of interdisciplinarity outlined by Barry et al. 
(2008),14 Toivanen et al. (2017) find the agonistic-antagonistic mode, conceived not as synthesis nor as 
division of labor but as “criticism of or opposition to the intellectual, ethical or political limits of established 
disciplines” (Barry et al., 2008, p. 29), as the “best route toward a fruitful advancement of science and 
knowledge” (Toivanen et al., 2017, p. 4) in Anthropocene Studies. Much of the ‘Anthropocene’ debate has 
indeed been based on forms of antagonism, especially between the humanities and natural sciences, that 
encouraged rather than halted further research on both sides. 
Even among a broader, non-academic audience, the ‘Anthropocene’ has echoed through artistic 
forms and expressions – most notably, music and art exhibitions. “Anthropocene” is a 2016 song by former 
Pakistani rapper Shayan Afridi, or ‘Samsa,’ as well as the 2017 album title from US-American singer and 
songwriter Peter Oren. The term ‘Anthropocene’ appears in English musician Nick Mulvey’s song and 
music video “In the Anthropocene,” and also in Miss Anthropocene, the studio album title from Canadian 
musician Claire Elise Boucher, professionally known as Grimes.15 A key contribution to opening the term 
to a broader audience was Jennifer Baichwal, Nicholas de Pencier, and Edward Burtynsky’s documentary 
film The Anthropocene, premiered in 2018. The term saw increasing interest among museum and gallery 
exhibitions too, from the Deutsches Museum’s Welcome to the Anthropocene of 2014–2016 to the art exhibition 
Anthropocene held in Chelsea in 2018, curated by Elisabeth Johs. An Anthropocene exhibition is expected to 
take place in Tallinn in 2023. Symbolic of the non-academic interest in the term is a wristwatch from the 
 
14 The three modes of interdisciplinarity are ‘integrative-synthesis’ mode, ‘subordination-service’ mode, and ‘agonistic-
antagonistic’ mode. 
15 These offer just a glimpse of the musical reception of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Additional artistic and musical adaptations 
of the term are listed in Erle Ellis’s Anthropocene: A Very Short Introduction (Ellis, 2018, p. 142). See also Currier (2014) 
for a contribution in ecomusicology.

British watch company Christopher Ward named ‘Anthropocene,’ an opera from Stuart MacRae and Louise 
Welsh,16 and even a post-apocalyptic thriller directed by Emir Skalonja named Anthropocene. 
In fact, art has become a major contributor to Anthropocene Studies in recent years. Rather than 
a mere visual tool for personal interpretation and realization of the art object, ‘art in the Anthropocene’ is 
a tool “to share meaning and transform values” (Davis & Turpin, 2015a, p. 3) at the intersection of 
aesthetics, politics, environmental awareness, and knowledge (Davis & Turpin, 2015b). Such is, for example, 
the ‘Aerocene’ project initially launched by Argentinian contemporary artist Tomás Saraceno. His flying 
sculptures (Museo Aero Solar), fueled by wind or solar power, met the ‘Anthropocene’ idea in a 2014–2015 
art exhibition held in Toulouse to form an Anthropocène Monument – a solar sculpture made of reused plastic 
bags. The exhibition brought humanists and scientists together to discuss the meaning and representation 
of the ‘Anthropocene’ as object of sensorial interpretation, but also as a time calling for action (Latour & 
Davis, 2015; Saraceno et al., 2015). 
Among the main venues where the term gained attention and spread are academic journals as well 
as media outlets. Already in 2003, the editorial of Nature opened its 424th volume with a “Welcome to the 
Anthropocene” (Nature, 2003) – only the first of a series of many ‘welcomes’ to the epoch.17 In 2004, the 
term appeared in The New York Times, where it was stated that “[i]t is now clear that the Earth has entered 
the so-called Anthropocene Era” (Wallström et al., 2004). In 2008, it was BBC News’ turn to recognize the 
term (Pease, 2008), followed by the popular Economist headline “The geology of the planet: Welcome to the 
Anthropocene” (Economist, 2011). After a few appearances in The Guardian (Carrington, 2016; Sample, 
2014), its widespread adoption made it harder to track its use in media platforms. 
Over the years, the ‘Anthropocene’ has become more than an object of exclusive scholarly interest. 
The term has transgressed the boundaries of academia, resonating in many aspects of human society – from 
journalism and music to art and museology. However, on the edge of this exponential interest in the term 
in both public discourse and scholarly research, it has become hard to delineate a shared framework for 
defining the ‘Anthropocene’ in a multifunctional fashion. The semantics of the term has become blurred, 
oftentimes falling into relativism by merely becoming a matter of subjective interpretation. This recognized 
issue (Delanty & Mota, 2017; Jahn et al., 2015; Luciano, 2019; Semal, 2015; Stallins, 2020) is a central 
problem for the development of Anthropocene Studies, a field already facing problems related to its novelty 
and contested nature. In some ways, Anthropocene Studies seems to replicate the same issues that 
philosopher of science Peter Godfrey-Smith identified in the field of Artificial Life. This is a new field of 
knowledge that emerged during the 1980s and 1990s seeking to merge computer science and biology to 
model living systems. Discussing Thomas Kuhn’s idea of normal science, Godfrey-Smith (2003) argued 
that “there was not nearly enough work that built on” literature on Artificial Life (p. 85), halting further

17 The list (where “Welcome to the Anthropocene” appears in the title) includes: Nature (2003), Crutzen (2005), Baum 
(2008), deBuys (2008), Dalby (2011), Economist (2011), Anthropocene.info (2012), Clémençon (2012), Slaughter 
(2012), AESS (2014), Möllers et al. (2015), Dyer (2016), di Chiro (2017), Major (2017), and Lewis and Maslin (2018).

developments of the field. Another reason for Artificial Life not to transition into “anything resembling a 
normal science” was its “premature commercialization” (ibid.) – namely, the necessity of ‘selling’ the idea 
for academic rewards outside the rationale of genuine puzzle-solving typical of normal science. Although 
Artificial Life is now seeing new vigor thanks to increased computing power and efficiency of simulators, 
its original issues are to some degree analogous to those that Anthropocene Studies is currently facing. 
Not all scholars (either natural scientists or humanists) agree on the usefulness of the term. A 
recurrent line of accusation has been the seemingly ideological aspect of the ‘Anthropocene’ – that is, the 
term “provides the ideational underpinning for a particular view of the world” (Baskin, 2015, p. 10) that is 
self-legitimizing. This view questions the genuine ‘scientificity’ of the term, accused of being a political 
statement rather than a scientific commitment (Finney & Edwards, 2016). Further criticism addresses the 
very usefulness of the term, considering it unnecessary or useless because the extent of human action is 
already reflected “throughout the Holocene” (Morrison, 2015, p. 76), or because of the negligible effects 
of human civilizations on the geological record (Visconti, 2014). Sociologist Eileen Crist criticizes the poor 
choice of a name, for the term seems to offer “no added substantive content, no specific empirical or ethical 
overtones, no higher vision ensconced within it” (Crist, 2013, p. 142). Radical forms of criticism go as far 
as considering the term as an academic invention (Visconti, 2014), a form of supreme narcissism (Jensen, 
2013), a pop culture phenomenon (Autin & Holbrook, 2012), or simply nonsense, “a fad, a bandwagon, a 
way of marketing research as cutting-edge and relevant” (Scourse, 2016). Some of this criticism addresses 
the sociological aspect of Anthropocene Studies, redirecting criticism toward the very nature of some 
research conducted by the academic enterprise. A more thorough discussion of criticism of the 
Anthropocene (and the Anthropocene Hypothesis) is provided in Chapter 5. 
Despite fierce criticism, and regardless of the outcome of the proposal for formal recognition, it 
seems that the ‘Anthropocene’ is here to stay. As geologist David Rull (2018) has pointed out (with a critical 
overtone), for “non-geologists, formalization seems not to be relevant and the term is freely used” (p. 5). 
If this is the case, then the term may endure by embracing new meanings and trajectories (as is already 
happening) in the years ahead. 
 
1.1.2 The Issue of Definition 
 
The development of Anthropocene Studies as a multidisciplinary field of knowledge is a symptom of 
widespread interest among academic as well as public audiences in this captivating term. While this newborn 
research field has proven to be a creative hub for diverse disciplinary discourses, it faces a major hindrance 
in establishing a multifunctional framework for the involved disciplines to discuss and debate the 
‘Anthropocene.’ Such is the issue of definition – that is, how to define the ‘Anthropocene’ in a way that (1) 
it is not exclusively a matter of subjective interpretation, (2) it is not exclusive of a single disciplinary domain, 
and (3) it is a sharable and functional object among disciplines. This issue manifests in several ways, from 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
18 
 
multiple extant definitions (even within the same field of knowledge) to the relatively recent nature of the 
term attracting hasty attention through media coverage. 
Because the ‘Anthropocene’ concept diversifies primarily through and across disciplinary domains, 
defining it ‘Anthropocene’ heavily relies on the discipline one is situated in (if not even on one’s personal 
taste in music). Within the realm of the natural sciences alone, scholars have identified at least three 
definitions: a proposed interval in geological history, a rupture in the functioning of the Earth System, and 
the cumulative footprint of humans on the planet, from urbanization to resource extraction (Hamilton et 
al., 2015b). Social theorist and environmental humanist Ben Dibley (2012) finds seven units of meaning 
that the term ‘Anthropocene’ encapsulates, namely (1) a geological epoch and discourse, (2) a folding of 
historical and geological time, (3) a narrative of the consequences of globalization and modernity on the 
concept of freedom, (4) an ambivalent reiteration of the nature–culture dichotomy, (5) attachment, 
dependency and responsibility toward the Earth, (6) the financialization of the Earth System, and (7) the 
development of a common future outside the semantics of the modernist ideal of Progress. Crutzen himself 
cannot avoid noticing how defining the Anthropocene has now become “a more difficult task than giving 
a scientific talk” (Crutzen, 2015, p. 32). Geologist Whitney J. Autin (2016) surveyed possible meanings of 
the Anthropocene, focusing on the multiple conceptual dichotomies the concept has generated (e.g., formal 
vs. informal Anthropocene, good vs. bad Anthropocene, conservative vs. liberal politics, artistic nostalgia 
vs. dystopias) and perceptions of the ‘Anthropocene’ across disciplines.18 
 
Whereas interested scholars have perhaps acknowledged a common understanding of the 
underlying geological denotation of the ‘Anthropocene,’ they have been battling over what to consider the 
most pressing aspects to tackle in and about this newly proposed epoch – confirming the agonistic-
antagonistic multidisciplinary model of Anthropocene Studies suggested by Toivanen et al. (2017). Within 
this research model, the very first definition of the ‘Anthropocene,’ which emerged from the natural 
sciences, became contested. Is the ‘Anthropocene’ more than a geological epoch? What if its properties 
extended well beyond the realm of geology? To what extent did current modes of existence bring about the 
‘Anthropocene’? And which societies are more responsible for its dawn? Humanists and social scientists 
answer these questions by claiming the ‘Anthropocene’ cannot be defined exclusively in geological and 
Earth System science terms (Bostic & Howey, 2017; Ellis, 2016a; Lewis & Maslin, 2015a).  
 
This line of inquiry excludes the ‘easy’ solution of simply ascribing to the ‘Anthropocene’ its ‘true 
meaning’ based on the narrative of the natural sciences. For instance, ‘Anthropocene’ researchers and 
literary theorists Eva Horn and Hannes Bergthaller (who are mentioned again later in this chapter) provide 
an extended definition of ‘Anthropocene,’ whilst also highlighting the issues emerging in Anthropocene 
Studies: 
 
The Anthropocene is a concept which challenges the foundations of humanities scholarship as it is 
traditionally understood. It calls not only for closer engagement with the natural sciences but also

‘Anthropocene.’ 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE' AND ANTHROPOCENE STUDIES

for a synthetic approach bringing together insights from the various subdisciplines in the humanities 
and social sciences which have addressed themselves to ecological questions in the past. […] The 
difficulties of an introduction to the Anthropocene lie not only in the disciplinary breadth of the 
subject, but also in the rapid pace at which the surrounding debates have been, and still are, 
unfolding. (Horn & Bergthaller, 2020, p. III) 
 
Raising conceptual challenges in delineating the ‘ontology’ of the ‘Anthropocene,’ namely what makes or 
what are the properties of the ‘Anthropocene,’ is essential for advancing the global research agenda on this 
global phenomenon. However, the surge in academic and popular interest brought about the pragmatic 
necessity of having a shared definition of the ‘Anthropocene’ for cross-functional purposes. Furthermore, 
difficulties of communications between domains of knowledge has been exacerbating the ‘two cultures’ 
(Snow, 1959) to the point that “quite a few contributions from the humanities tend to either ignore the 
scientific debates or even reject the sciences as inherently technocratic and hegemonic” (Horn & 
Bergthaller, 2020), and vice-versa. On top of this, the ‘Anthropocene’ has been characterized in different 
ways, more commonly as idea, concept, or hypothesis, but also as thesis (Davis & Turpin, 2015b; Hamilton 
et al., 2015b), theory (Luciano, 2018), meta-concept (Oliveira, 2019), effect (GRAID, 2016), event (Bauer 
et al., 2021; Brannen, 2019a), interdisciplinary theoretical framework (Trischler, 2014), transdisciplinary 
project (ibid.), elevator concept (Crist, 2013, footnote 40), boundary object (Braje & Lauer, 2020), 
conjecture (Olsson, 2021), or threshold concept (Clark, 2015), therefore adding a semantic component to 
the issue of definition. 
These facts, when combined with occasional inaccurate or hasty media coverage (Carrington, 2016; 
Rull, 2016) and the lack of a broader theoretical framework, resulted in confusing, colliding, and mistaken 
interpretations of this new concept, with unavoidable and significant consequences for conceptual clarity. 
This is particularly true for the educational aspect of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
How, then, to provide a multidisciplinary and multifunctional definition of the ‘Anthropocene’? 
Posing this fundamental question in Anthropocene Studies serves two purposes.  
First, it warns about a core issue that reverberates in any research conducted in Anthropocene 
Studies – that is, the necessity of clarifying what about the ‘Anthropocene’ is being addressed. This simple, 
yet occasionally overshadowed, issue often results in contrasting methodologies of analysis (e.g., historical 
events used as primary data for stratigraphic research), proliferation of terminological variants (‘Phagocene,’ 
‘Anglocene,’ ‘Plantationocene,’ ‘Pyrocene,’19 etc.), or equalization of the ‘Anthropocene’ to other 
environmental discourses, such as global warming, ecological reflexivity, or climate change. This recurrence 
does not help, but rather muddies multidisciplinary research efforts, giving rise to suspicions or skepticism 
toward the value of the term (Visconti, 2014).  
 
19 The terms ‘Phagocene’ and ‘Anglocene’ were coined by historians Christophe Bonneuil and Jean-Baptiste Fressoz 
in their 2016 monograph The Shock of the Anthropocene. The terms indicate, respectively, the role of consumerism, and 
the outsized contribution of the United Kingdom and USA to the dawn of the Anthropocene. The term ‘Pyrocene’ 
was first coined by environmental historian Stephen J. Pyne (2015), highlighting the role of fires in the ‘Anthropocene.’ 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
20 
 
Second, it raises the question of whether it is necessary to have a cross-functional definition of the 
concept. Indeed, as it has been implicit so far, a cross-functional definition is essential for the field of 
Anthropocene Studies especially in facing relativism or interpretative anarchism – that is, any interpretation 
of the ‘Anthropocene’ being valid by virtue of being an interpretation. This is an especially pressing matter 
for the educational aspect of defining the term. For instance, one could consider any interpretation of the 
concept to be valid insofar as it provides a clear pedagogical understanding of it. Regardless of the criteria 
to determine the validity of any interpretation, the lack of a shared semantic framework must be 
acknowledged, for it constitutes a major theoretical point to address in the development of Anthropocene 
Studies. 
Acknowledging these difficulties in defining the term, the ecocritic and environmental humanist 
Jeremy Davies (2018) as well as the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 1.1; see also Zalasiewicz et al., 
2021) even attempted to define it based on what the ‘Anthropocene’ is not. That is because the word, already 
considered by many to be worn out, “has been tossed into debate much more frequently than it has been 
explained or defined” (Davies, 2018, p. 6). Despite the aims of this strategy are to counter some forms of 
criticism toward the term (such as its being ‘anthropocentric’), it might be insufficient to simply define the 
new epoch based on its criticism. That is because this approach still requires knowledge of the ontology of 
the ‘Anthropocene,’ which is implicit in the approach (otherwise, it would be impossible to assess what the 
‘Anthropocene’ is not). Delineating this implicit ontology is precisely the issue at stake. 
Another attempt to provide a unifying reference framework for Anthropocene Studies is given by 
plant ecologist Simon Lewis and Earth System scientist Mark Maslin (2015a, 2015b, 2018a). In a popular 
article published in Nature in 2015, the scholars advanced a definition of the ‘Anthropocene’ that would 
link humanities and geological research, hence providing a transparent framework (Lewis & Maslin, 2015b) 
for Anthropocene Studies. The link is established by considering the broader meaning of the starting dates 
to the epoch they propose, namely 1610 (coinciding with the European colonization of the Americas) and 
1964 (coinciding with a peak in nuclear testing fallout). These dates, they argue, reflect major anthropogenic 
signals of importance in geological research and, at the same time, turning points in the history of 
humankind. Their argument constitutes an attempt to link historical, social, and geological research by 
outlining multidisciplinary criteria to set the beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ (the importance of setting a 
beginning in geological and broader academic research is discussed in section 3.2; Lewis and Maslin’s 
proposals are discussed in sections 3.2.3.2 and 3.2.4.3). 
Anthropologists Todd Braje and Matthew Lauer (2020) suggest abandoning “the search for and 
debate over Anthropocene definitions” because “we risk losing out on the real power and promise of the 
concept” (p. 8). The potential and utility of the concept can best be grasped by considering it a ‘boundary 
object,’ ensuring “communication across disciplines by creating a shared vocabulary, and acknowledging 
that no one discipline has a privileged framework for describing the current epoch” (ibid.). In other words, 
attempting to define the term would only reduce underlying collaborative and multidisciplinary efforts 
informing Anthropocene Studies. As later argued, the broader ‘Anthropocene’ idea is in fact best 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE' AND ANTHROPOCENE STUDIES 
21 
 
represented as a boundary object. However, this understanding of the ‘Anthropocene’ differs from its 
stratigraphic or geological variant – namely, the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This theoretical entity does 
require definition, and should best be framed as a scientific (stratigraphic) hypothesis rather than a boundary 
object. 
There are many further attempts to clarify the term, or to provide a general operating framework 
for the ‘Anthropocene’ research communities worldwide. What is important to stress in this section is that 
the fundamental issue in defining the ‘Anthropocene’ is not so much the multidisciplinary nature of the 
term, or the debate surrounding it; nor exclusively the rapid pace at which the ‘Anthropocene’ has been 
spreading among disciplines outside the natural sciences. Rather, it is rooted in the lack – or difficulties in 
forging – a set of shared methodologies for multidisciplinary research among disciplines, particularly among 
different fields of knowledge, such as humanities and the natural sciences. Consequentially, no shared 
framework (linguistic, conceptual, or methodological) can ease the translation and operationalization of the 
term among knowledge domains. This issue – to some extent a contemporary replica of the ‘two cultures,’ 
but also, as it should be noted, a consequence of consistent low funding of interdisciplinary research 
(Bromham et al., 2016) – sits at the core of many of the conflicts between human and social sciences on 
the one hand, and natural and applied sciences on the other, and is vividly manifesting in Anthropocene 
Studies.  
What definition is adopted within this present research, then? As already highlighted in the 
introduction to this work, the present investigation adopts the definition of ‘Anthropocene’ shaped by the 
stratigraphic and geological discourse. Specifically, the object of research is the Anthropocene Hypothesis, 
or geological or stratigraphic formulation or variant of the ‘Anthropocene.’ A more accurate definition of 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis is provided in section 1.3, together with a description of the differences 
between the ‘Anthropocene’ concept and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Delineating the conceptual history 
and epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis is the primary target of this overall endeavor. Without 
necessarily considering it the answer to the issue of defining the ‘Anthropocene’ for a common, cross-
functional framework, this choice is rather based on the nature of the object and scope of the present 
research – that is, delineating the conceptual history and epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis to 
differentiate as a theoretical entity from the broader ‘Anthropocene’ category. 
It might be reasonable to believe that advancing a definition might vanquish the issue of clarity 
right away. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The definition hereby adopted is only a momentary and 
partial solution to the scope of the research. Providing an operating definition of the ‘Anthropocene’ is a 
necessary but insufficient requirement for conducting a sound analysis of the term. Humanists and natural 
scientists might agree on the definition of a ‘geological Anthropocene,’ but that would not solve semantic 
barriers behind their understanding of the ‘Anthropocene.’ That is because the term ‘Anthropocene’ has no 
meaning in isolation – in fact, its meaning is drawn from the determined semantic/conceptual network that 
implements the term. This form of ‘semantic holism’ – a central theme in the philosophy of language and 
theory of meaning of the 20th century – is another major challenge for the development of a 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
22 
 
multidisciplinary framework to understand the ‘Anthropocene,’ especially considering the novelty and 
contested status of the term.  
The polysemy of the term represents a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the term has seen 
much and diversified publicity. As a result, it seems to lack semantic depth to the point that, as an umbrella 
category, it means everything and nothing. This is an epistemic weakness. On the other hand, the plurality 
of definitions offered by scholarly engagement have transformed the term into a hub for critical discussions, 
connecting themes within the environmental agenda, but also among different disciplinary domains. This 
is an epistemic strength. Ultimately, the term ‘Anthropocene’ is a concept-in-the-making, so any last 
judgement on its utility, meaning, or fate is yet to be declared
 
 
1.2 Histories of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
 
 
A central heuristic in defining the ‘Anthropocene,’ and thus in framing the Anthropocene Hypothesis, is 
retracing its conceptual history because it provides key insights on the term’s semantics. A suitable starting 
point for such analysis is inquiring into the plurality of meanings the phrase ‘history of the Anthropocene’ 
entails. 
Section 1.1 highlighted the interest that the term has sparked in academia as well as in popular 
culture. This interest engendered a spectrum of research trajectories and criticism (discussed in Chapter 5) 
concerning multiple aspects of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Because of the transdisciplinary nature of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ encompassing scientific claims, moral and political claims, calls for social change, 
environmental activism, and artistic expressions, many of the themes developed within Anthropocene 
Studies overlap with one another – sometimes in a conflicting fashion. 
This is especially true in mapping the history of the ‘Anthropocene,’ where frictions between 
historians and natural scientists arose over the societal importance of selecting a starting date (Maslin & 
Lewis, 2020). Following this line of criticism, the geohistory of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit 
became contested, opening new parallel histories of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a scientific or broader concept. 
In fact, a spectrum of these can be traced depending on how the term is defined, and where the emphasis 
in ‘history of the Anthropocene’ is placed. Some are: 
• 
The history of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit 
• 
The history of the ‘Anthropocene’ as an Earth System singularity 
• 
The history of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
• 
The history of the ‘Anthropocene’ idea/term 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
23 
 
These four themes or ‘histories’ represent distinguishable narratives in Anthropocene Studies, each 
stemming from specific disciplinary or methodological approaches to the ‘Anthropocene.’ The following 
sections overview each of these separately, highlighting their crucial role in debates on the new epoch while 
also providing a ‘background’ history of it.  
It should be noted that these four clusters do not necessarily reflect the way that ‘Anthropocene’ 
research is conducted in practice. Geology, Earth System science, environmental history, and conceptual 
history often share literature, methodologies, and multidisciplinary efforts. The very textual cradle of the 
Anthropocene is an example of this. Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer’s seminal IGBP article (Crutzen 
& Stoermer, 2000) included elements of geology (i.e., redefining the Holocene), Earth System science (i.e., 
the proxies they provided), environmental history (i.e., the role of the Industrial Revolution), and conceptual 
history (i.e., terminological precursors such as the Anthropozoic) – in addition to an original normative 
connotation. The clusters outlined represent epistemic categories to help focalize discrete research trends 
within the larger research network engendering Anthropocene Studies. It is considered both linguistically 
and conceptually practical to distinguish between these approaches not solely for the purpose of locating 
the research hereby conducted, but also for providing a cross-functional outlook of the historical research 
landscape within the blurred field of Anthropocene Studies. 
 
1.2.1 The History of the Anthropocene as a Geological Time Unit 
 
Natural sciences read the history of the Earth through the eyes of radiometric dating,20 the basic technique 
upon which (broadly speaking) the disciplines of modern absolute geochronology and chronostratigraphy 
reconstruct the Earth’s history. Radiometric dating allows us to measure the absolute age of materials such 
as fossils or rocks buried in deep time. Geochronology and chronostratigraphy reconstruct and divides the 
Earth’s geohistory in the geological units of eon/eonothem, era/erathem, period/system, epoch/series, 
and age/stage.21 Currently, we are situated in the Phanerozoic Eon (last 541 million years), in the Cenozoic 
Era (last 66 million years), in the Quaternary Period (last 2.58 million years), in the Holocene Epoch (last 
11,700 years), in the Meghalayan Age (last 4,250 years). The Anthropocene Hypothesis locates the 
beginning of an Anthropocene unit to the 1950s – that is, the last 70 years. 
To put the history of humans in the context of geological time, the emergence of the genus Homo 
with our ancestor Homo habilis is believed to date back 2.1 Ma,22 representing around 0.046% of the Earth’s 
 
20 The metaphor implicitly assumes the Earth’s history as that represented by absolute time. 
21 The dual nomenclature reflects the duality adopted in geology between a geological time scale (based on 
geochronological units, i.e., those on the left side of the slash), and the parallel international chronostratigraphic chart 
(based on chronostratigraphic units, i.e., those on the right side of the slash). The meaning of ‘geochronology’ and 
‘chronostratigraphy’ is explained in more details in section 3.1.2.6. 
22 ‘Ma’ stands for ‘millions of years ago.’ There seems to be a debate in Earth sciences over the usage of the proper 
abbreviation to address geological time (see also Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myr, section ‘Debate,’ 
accessed on May 23, 2021. Last revision: March 1, 2021, 23:14 CET by ClueBot NG). This debate is confirmed by the 
existence of multiple variants across geological literature, such as ‘Ma BP,’ ‘MyBP,’ ‘myrbp,’ or simply ‘million years 
BP’ – where Before Present (BP) has been commonly assumed to be the year 1950 CE (dates using BP are more

history. About 1.8–1.7 Ma, Homo erectus began controlling fire. Our species, Homo sapiens, whose oldest 
fossils retrieved date to 300 ka (Hublin, 2017), coincides with roughly 0.0066% of the Earth’s history. The 
transition from hunter-gatherer forms of society to agriculture and domestication, known as the Neolithic 
revolution, began around 12 ka (Baker, 2009), only accounting for 0.00026% of the Earth’s history. The 
Great Acceleration (Steffen et al., 2015; Steffen et al., 2004c), namely, a period of surges in socio-economic 
and Earth System trends that followed WWII roughly coinciding with the dawn of the Anthropocene, has 
the duration of an average human lifespan. These figures are often cited by critics of the hypothesis as 
showing the geological insignificance of the proposed time unit, whose stratigraphic layer (i.e., 
anthropogenic sediments) is either too thin or not “sufficiently distinct, and adequately dated at the global 
scale, for a Holocene/Anthropocene boundary to be substantiated on stratigraphic grounds” (Gibbard & 
Walker, 2014, p. 7). On the other hand, advocates of a formal Anthropocene time unit have argued that, 
despite the short time scale, the pace and spatial distribution of anthropogenic sediments should redirect 
the focus on the magnitude of the proposed epoch rather than its relative geological length (Zalasiewicz et 
al., 2017b). 
But where does the Anthropocene figure within the Earth’s history? In other words, when does 
the history of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit begin? 
Several proposals have been advanced to determine the beginning of the Anthropocene – from as 
early as the use of fire and the Neolithic revolution, to the onset of the Great Acceleration. Surveying the 
extant literature reveals more than a dozen different starting dates that have been suggested by researchers. 
Based on how far back in time they extend, this spectrum of hypotheses can be clustered into four different 
categories – namely, paleoanthropocene hypotheses (1.8 Ma to 13.8 ka), early Anthropocene hypotheses 
(11 ka to 2 ka), modern Anthropocene hypotheses (1500 CE to 1900 CE), and contemporary Anthropocene 
hypotheses (1945 CE to 1964 CE). Some of these hypotheses set its beginning from as far back as 1.8 Ma 
(Glikson, 2013) to the beginning of the Holocene (Smith & Zeder, 2013). Others locate its beginning in the 
Industrial Revolution, or as recent as 1964, coinciding with a peak in 14C (radiocarbon) caused by nuclear 
bomb testing (Lewis & Maslin, 2015a, 2015b, 2018a). Discussions about the beginning of the proposed 
epoch bear a significant epistemic value for the Anthropocene research agenda. This epistemic value is 
discussed separately, along with a thorough discussion of each relevant proposed starting date, throughout 
section 3.2. 
One of the most discussed alternatives proposed so far is the Ruddiman Hypothesis, named after 
its originator William F. Ruddiman, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Virginia. The Ruddiman 
 
commonly used for the Pleistocene and the Holocene). The present research adopts the distinction proposed by Aubry 
et al. (2009b), while maintaining the year 2000 as a conventional signpost for defining the ‘present.’ The authors 
consider the 1950-CE-based definition of ‘before present’ a “misconception” (p. 103), and suggest using ‘annus’ and 
its multiples (e.g., ‘ka,’ ‘Ma,’ ‘Ga,’ etc.) to address geohistorical dates “as a point in time derived from the rock record” 
(p. 104). Parallelly, they recommend using ‘year’ and its multiples (e.g., ‘kyr,’ ‘Myr,’ Gyr,’ etc.) to express the duration 
of geohistorical times. This framework is also consistent with the guidelines of the International Stratigraphic Guide 
(Salvador, 1994), and with the terminology adopted for the geological time scale / international chronostratigraphic 
chart. 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
25 
 
Hypothesis, sometimes referred to as the Early Anthropocene Hypothesis,23 dates the beginning of the 
proposed epoch during the Neolithic revolution, around 7 ka or 5 ka (Ruddiman, 2003, 2017; Ruddiman et 
al., 2008; Ruddiman et al., 2014). This hypothesis is based on paleoclimate evidence of an increase in CO2 
(carbon dioxide) and CH4 (methane), between 7 ka and 5 ka respectively. This increase cannot seem to be 
fully attributed to natural forces, in that it appears to abruptly detour from the Earth-orbital–driven changes 
in CO2 and CH4 of the past 350,000 years. Furthermore, the Holocene, which represents a warmer period 
between glacial ages, seems anomalous in its late part compared to previous interglaciations of the past 
800,000 years. This evidence leads Ruddiman to the conclusion that “millennia ago farming began to 
transform landscapes sufficiently to emit greenhouse gases and extend the natural warmth of the current 
interglaciation that had been initiated by orbital variations” (Ruddiman, 2017, p. 4).24 
By stretching the beginning of the anthropogenic signature on the geological records to thousands 
of years, the Ruddiman Hypothesis provides a much longer history to the epoch in question compared to 
the current AWG stance which, following a vote held online on May 21, 2019, decided to locate the onset 
of the Anthropocene around the mid-twentieth century.25 This coincides with sudden widespread bomb 
testing that scattered artificial radionuclides (radioactive atoms) in the atmosphere, considered by the group 
majority to be a global and synchronous proxy for marking the beginning of the proposed epoch. The 
stratigraphic markers associated to this signal are discussed more thoroughly in section 3.1. 
Being the dedicated geological research group studying the Anthropocene in the international 
geological community (viz. the IUGS, the ICS, and the SQS), the AWG constitutes the leading voice in the 
scientific debate over the Anthropocene. Thus, the history of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit 
is largely dependent upon the group’s research trajectory and final goal – that is, to seek formal ratification 
of the proposed time unit on the geological time scale. The question of whether the Anthropocene’s 
geohistory is independent of formal recognition is an open one. It could be argued that, from an Earth 
System science perspective, the ‘Anthropocene’ as a state of affairs is happening regardless of the formal 
recognition attributed by the competent geological authorities. This would confer the Anthropocene a 
different ontological designation than a geological time unit, for example, an ‘event’26 (Bauer et al., 2021; 
Bonneuil & Fressoz, 2016; Brannen, 2019a; Hamilton, 2016; Horn & Bergthaller, 2020), ‘stage’ (in a non-
geological sense), ‘phase,’ or ‘singularity.’  
The geological time scale represents an interesting and much debated epistemological ground. 
Looking at the history of certain time units, such as the Quaternary or the Devonian Periods (or even the 
 
23 As later explained in section 3.2.2, multiple variants exist that can be identified as early Anthropocene hypotheses. 
Hence, it is considered more appropriate to address Ruddiman’s formulation as the Ruddiman Hypothesis rather than 
the Early Anthropocene (or Anthropogenic) Hypothesis, as it is sometimes referred to in extant Anthropocene 
literature.  
24 Interestingly, neither in his 2014 nor his 2017 papers does Ruddiman make explicit use of the term ‘Anthropocene.’ 
25 The vote results are available on http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/working-groups/anthropocene/ (accessed on 
May 23, 2021). 
26 The Greek etymology of the term ‘epoch’ is ἐποχή, notoriously known in philosophy and epistemology as 
‘suspension of judgement,’ but also meaning cessation, retention, or pause. Horn and Bergthaller (2020, p. 159) suggest 
it should be translated as ‘event’ or ‘break.’ 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
26 
 
Holocene, see Warde et al., 2017), the path of formal ratification is far from a smooth one. It often involves 
fierce clashes between subcultures in geological research, each promoting their own view of what does, and 
what does not, constitute appropriate geological evidence (Aubry et al., 2009a; Kerr, 2008; Rudwick, 1985). 
These circumstances, together with constantly improved data and research methods, have caused changes 
to the geological time scale many times throughout its history. However, from the point of view of 
philosophical realism, the geohistory of the Earth is utterly independent of us. All is left for us is signs that 
scientific research assembles into a coherent history of the Earth. Hence, what we call Phanerozoic, the 
current 541 million-year-old eon determined by an increase in complex multicellular life, existed independently 
of us – that is to say, a non-human civilization equipped with radiometric dating technology would observe 
approximately the same characteristics that distinguish the Phanerozoic Eon (e.g., the appearance of 
complex multicellular life).27 
This digression brings us to the following point: Would the ‘Anthropocene’ still exist independently 
of a formal approval? In other words, to what extent does the ‘Anthropocene’ exist, and exist outside the 
realms of mere geological classification? Unless dissolving the epoch into socio-constructivism, the 
possibility that the characteristics of this time interval could now be independent of social agreement should 
be discussed. In fact, this is what has been advocated by the AWG, which claims that if these characteristics 
“were driven by any other means – such as by meteorite impact, volcanic eruptions or the actions of another 
species – then they would have exactly the same importance geologically”; and that an Anthropocene Series, 
namely, a chronostratigraphic counterpart of a geological epoch, “can be dug into, sampled […] and hit 
with a hammer” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, p. 3). These statements seek to qualify the ‘Anthropocene’ as 
something substantially different from historical labels – such as the Renaissance or the Middle Ages – and 
confer the proposed time unit the same ontological status of other units on the geological time scale.  
Stressing these theoretical points is of fundamental importance in assessing the ontological status 
of an Anthropocene stratigraphic unit as something existing independently of us, yet caused by us. 
Considering the stratigraphy of this epoch as forever inscribed in the Earth’s history is surely a strong 
statement with important repercussions on the problem of definition stressed in 1.1.2. As will be explained 
in chapter 4, this kind of question should stimulate the necessity of a critical insight from the philosophy 
of geology, a much needed and underrated branch of philosophy of science. 
 
1.2.2 The History of the ‘Anthropocene’ as an Earth System Singularity 
 
Scholars have also suggested considering the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ from an Earth System science 
point of view (Bonneuil, 2015; Bonneuil & Fressoz, 2016; Hamilton, 2016, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2015b; 
 
27 Naturally, this is not to say that an alien civilization would use the same stratigraphic and chronostratigraphic features 
(e.g. GSSP, see section 3.1.2.6) to characterize what we recognize (and name) as the Phanerozoic. Nevertheless, they 
would recognize distinguished markers in strata that would suggest the proliferation of complex multicellular life. This 
mental experiment is also considered in section 5.2.1. 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
27 
 
Syvitski et al., 2020). This approach understands the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ as the interval in which 
anthropogenic activities became so significant as to alter the functioning of the Earth System. In this 
context, the ‘Anthropocene’ is not necessarily seen as a geological time unit, but rather as a time interval 
when humans became a predominant force in the functioning of the Earth System – representing a 
singularity or no-analogue state (Steffen et al., 2004b). Within this knowledge domain, the issue of geological 
formalization is less of a pressing epistemic concern. 
 
But what is the Earth System? And what is Earth System science? 
Earth System science is the multidisciplinary study of global cycles of key chemical constituents 
taking place in the interaction between the Earth’s ‘spheres,’ such as the biosphere, the atmosphere, or the 
hydrosphere. Due to their biological, geological, and chemical nature, these cycles are known as 
‘biogeochemical cycles.’ These global-scale processes, from the carbon cycle and the water cycle to the 
oxygen cycle, are what inform the Earth’s ‘metabolism,’ a cardinal concept explaining the planet’s 
functioning. Earth System science focuses on the different properties that the planet exhibits as a complex, 
nonlinear system,28 such as positive and negative feedback, self-regulating mechanisms, emergence, tipping 
points, and so forth. Eventually, Earth System scientists compare these properties to those of other known 
planets, or ponder the possible consequences of altering the Earth’s mechanisms – as is the case with the 
course of human action. 
A detailed history of the emergence and evolution of Earth System science is provided by Steffen 
(2020). Four crucial aspects can be observed in surveilling the history of the ‘Earth System’ concept: the 
application of system theory to the study of the Earth; the pioneering role of NASA; the formation of a 
multi-program Earth System Science Partnership; and the general increasing environmental awareness 
during the second half of the 20th century. 
Many prototypical conceptions of the Earth as a ‘system’ – whether as a conscious living being, an 
entity with an internal purposeful scheme, or a holistic whole – are to be found in the history of human 
civilizations. However, in the context of modern science, the term ‘system’ acquired a specific meaning 
during the 20th century with the development of system theory, namely, the interdisciplinary study of the 
nature and functioning of ‘systems’ as groups of interacting entities in an interconnected network. The 
application of system theory to the study of the Earth began during the 1960s and 1970s with the 
formulation of James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis’s popular Gaia Hypothesis.29 In fact, here is where Earth 
System scientist Tim Lenton (2016) places the very cradle of the modern discipline of Earth System science. 
The Earth’s functioning began to be considered as a dynamic complex system of interacting forces 
(especially the biosphere) whose properties cannot be reduced to, nor understood by, its elemental 
components. 
 
28 In system theory, a system is a set of entities that interact with one another. The properties emerging from this 
interaction cannot be understood by looking at the individual entities: this phenomenon is called ‘emergence.’ 
Nonlinearity is the property of a system where output changes are not proportional to changes in input. 
29 The Gaia Hypothesis was promoted by James Lovelock in 1972, and refined through the years together with 
biologist Lynn Margulis (Lovelock, 1990). The hypothesis posits that organisms interacting with their surroundings 
generate an adaptive self-regulating mechanism that can maintain the Earth in a state of homeostasis. 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
28 
 
 
A second important moment for the emergence of Earth System science was the establishment in 
1983 of an Earth System Sciences Committee (ESSC) by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA). The first chairman, mathematician Francis Bretherton, popularized the 
‘Bretherton Diagram,’ today still one of the most explicative illustrations of Earth System functioning. He 
also was part of the planning of the IGBP during the late 1980s, another crucial moment for the 
development of an international Earth System framework. 
In 1986, the ESSC published its report Earth System Science Overview: A Program for Global Change 
(Earth System Sciences Committee NASA Advisory Council, 1986), one of the earliest documents attesting 
the goals and method of the then-newborn field of Earth System science. Here, the concept of ‘Earth 
System’ is implemented to promote and encourage a shift in knowledge to the understanding of the Earth’s 
functioning. The report argued that such a shift is based on new parameters that observing the Earth System 
require, such as global observations programs, information systems, and numerical models to allow global 
measurements, documentation and prediction of global change, a unified information database, and 
worldwide political engagement.30 Noticeably, these points do not solely highlight new methodological 
principles in studying the Earth, but also broaden the Earth System science boundaries to include social, 
political, and economic research: scientific understanding goes “hand in hand” (ibid., p. 10) with improving 
quality of life toward sustainability – another central concept in Earth System science (and environmental) 
discourse. 
 
The multidisciplinary application of system theory to the study of the Earth brought about a 
profound transformation in the Earth Science communities – one that some contemporary scholars have 
compared to a Kuhnian-type paradigm shift (Hamilton, 2016; Hamilton & Grinevald, 2015). Research 
methods began to change. An educational program, the Earth System Science Education Program, was 
even created by a joint initiative of NASA and USRA (Universities Space Research Association) in 1991 
and lasted through 2006 (Johnson, 2006). Such a shift of knowledge was openly acclaimed and promoted 
by the ESSC, whose 1988 report Earth System Science: A Closer Overview, announced that 
 
Many of the traditional Earth-science disciplines have reached maturity, bringing new and powerful 
research tools to bear on the study of the Earth as an integrated system of interacting components. 
We can now measure directly the inexorable motion of the Earth’s crustal plates and their effects 
upon land topography. Global models of atmospheric circulation have permitted not only routine 
numerical weather prediction but also investigations of large-scale atmospheric dynamics, thus 
laying the foundation for climate studies. Three-dimensional models of global ocean circulation, building 
upon recent insights into the ocean-atmosphere interaction, will shortly be within our reach. 
Analyses of prehistoric ice layers and ocean sediments are revealing the range of past climatic variations 
and the cyclic influence of changing Earth-orbital parameters. The decisive importance of global 
biology in shaping many oceanic and atmospheric properties has also been recognized; forthcoming 
studies of ocean biota and terrestrial ecosystems will increasingly place these investigations on a 
firm, quantitative basis. Over the past 20 years, atmospheric chemistry has matured into a vigorous 
 
30 This is a major point for advocates of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a theoretical singularity in the genealogical debate 
explained in section 1.2.4. If the ‘Anthropocene’ emerges from an Earth System conceptual framework, then the 
characteristic features attributed by NASA could be easily transferred to the ‘Anthropocene’ core semantic unit.

research field, opening our awareness of interactions of the atmosphere with chemical and 
biological processes in the oceans and on the land surface. All of these activities reflect a consensus 
of the international scientific community on the importance of understanding the operation of the 
Earth as a system. (National Research Council, 1988, p. 2, emphases added) 
 
The 1988 Earth System Science report constituted a farsighted effort in expanding knowledge of the Earth 
both from a scientific and social perspective. It provided short- and long-term guidelines as well as 
recommendations for policymakers and scientists, and encouraged overcoming disciplinary boundaries to 
gain scientific understanding of the interaction among the Earth’s layers, from oceans to atmosphere and 
biological systems. Most importantly, it provided an international reference framework for the concept of 
‘Earth System’ that incorporated humans as a major component affecting and regulating it functioning in a 
seemingly equal way to other geophysical forces shaping the surface of the planet. This framework 
constituted the episteme (Foucault, 1970) of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept – that is, the conditions of the 
possibility for thinking the ‘Anthropocene.’ Not by coincidence, the disciplines and aspects emphasized in 
the above excerpt represent some of the main disciplinary domains wherein the concept of the 
‘Anthropocene’ most appeared (as discussed in Chapter 2). 
A third major step in the formation of a global research framework in Earth System science was 
the simultaneous development of four global change research programs, namely, the International 
Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP, 1987–2015), the International Human Dimensions Programme on 
Global Environmental Change (IHDP, 1996–2014)31, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP, 
1980–still active), and Diversitas (1991–2014)32 (Ehlers & Krafft, 2006b; Hamilton, 2016; Leemans et al., 
2009). Each of these programs focused on one or multiple aspects of global change. The IGBP pioneered 
the use of the Earth System framework to study the interaction between human systems and the Earth 
System (Uhrqvist, 2014), and played a crucial role in informing and popularizing the term ‘Anthropocene’ 
during its first decade of existence. The IHDP focused on the human dimension of global environmental 
change by promoting and coordinating research at the intersection of science and society. The WCRP (the 
only one of the four programs still active) aims at modelling and predicting climate and studies the possible 
consequence of human influence on it. Finally, as a joint UNESCO, SCOPE (Scientific Committee on 
Problems of the Environment), and IUBS (International Union of Biological Science) initiative, Diversitas 
focused on biodiversity and its link with sustainability and ecological research.  
The apparent necessity of overcoming the research boundaries of each of these programs, and the 
common research areas, scopes, methods, and goals shared by each, led to the formation in 2001 of an 
Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP) under the sponsorship of the International Council for Science. 
The partnership particularly focused on “human-driven changes, which are multi-dimensional and have a 
cascading effect on the Earth System.”33 The ESSP represented an opportunity to further extend the 
 
31 The IHDP succeeded the Human Dimension Programme, which ran from 1991 to 1996. 
32 On December 31, 2014, Diversitas ended its operations and transitioned into Future Earth – a 10-year program 
launched in 2012.

disciplinary base of global change research by facilitating the international flow of global change knowledge, 
developing an integrative ethical and methodological framework, and strengthening the links between 
science, politics, and the public. These were the guidelines drawn during the IGBP’s Challenges of a 
Changing Earth: Global Change science meeting held in Amsterdam in 2001 (Steffen et al., 2002), from 
which the ESSP initiative took shape. 
 
Lastly, through the second half of the 20th century, the increasing international awareness among 
politicians, the public, and scientific communities on the issue of human-induced global change and 
humanity’s destructive potential decisively embodied the fourth (social) driving force that defined the 
backbone of the emerging Earth System science. Seminal textual works such as Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring 
(1962), Paul Ehrlich’s The Population Bomb (1968), the Club of Rome’s report The Limits to Growth (1972), 
and the United Nation’s Our Common Future (1987) called for local as well as global environmental agendas. 
Episodes such as the ozone hole detection, the Chernobyl disaster, or oil spills across the world’s water 
bodies deeply impacted the social imaginary over the destructive potential of humankind. The years 
preceding and surrounding the birth of the concept of the Earth System were dense with increasing 
concerns over the influence of humans on the Earth, and the possibility of difficult (or even apocalyptic) 
future scenarios for human societies. To cope with this unwanted possibility, new knowledge at the 
intersection of science, politics, and economics was deemed necessary to understand the interaction 
between humans and the planet and to envision a sustainable future.  
 
Having clarified the history and meaning of Earth System science, how does the ‘Anthropocene’ 
fit into this framework? And why does it represent an Earth System ‘singularity’? 
 
Introducing Earth System science in one of Oxford’s popular Very Short Introduction series, Lenton 
(2016) identifies three revolutionary moments that transformed the Earth System throughout its history: 
(1) the appearance and spread of lifeforms; (2) the biologically induced transformation of the atmosphere 
from anoxygenic to one filled with oxygen through oxygenic photosynthesis (an event known as the Great 
Oxygenation); and (3) the appearance of complex life throughout the Cambrian Explosion.34 The 
‘Anthropocene,’ Lenton argues, constitutes a fourth revolutionary moment in the Earth System. 
Several figures and measurements have been implemented as proxies to illustrate the magnitude of 
this singularity in the Earth System. One of these is the popular Keeling curve, named  after atmospheric 
scientist Charles David Keeling (1928 – 2005). The curve (also used as their ‘symbol’ by the AWG) 
represents a daily-to-monthly record of global average of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations 
monitored by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego through the Mauna Loa 
Observatory in Hawaii. The curve shows a steady increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 315 
ppm in 1958 (when regular measurements began) to approximately 415 ppm in 2021.35 This increase, almost 
unanimously considered of anthropogenic origins by scientists, is significantly beyond the upper limit of 
 
34 The Cambrian Explosion designated a diachronic interval taking place approximately 541 Ma where life complexity 
increased, and many animal phyla began to appear (in present geological records).

the Holocene atmospheric CO2 concentration, estimated to be around 280-285 ppm (Indermühle et al., 
1999; Ramussen, 2020).  
The Stockholm Resilience Center’s ‘planetary boundaries’ chart provides an overview of Earth 
System processes and their associated thresholds, both delineating an optimal operating state of human 
society and possible consequences of transgressing these thresholds (Rockström et al., 2009a; Rockström 
et al., 2009b). The staggering numbers in the accelerated rates of extinction, often linked to an increased 
conversion of land for agricultural purposes and associated reduction of all but one (i.e., the desert, see 
Molles, 2016, section 2.3) of the terrestrial biomes, unveil the likelihood of an ongoing, human-induced 
sixth Major Extinction Event (Barnosky et al., 2012; Barnosky et al., 2011; Kolbert, 2014). The 58% 
decrease in wildlife abundance recorded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) using the Living Planet Index 
(LPI) bears witness to a homogenization process that sees humans and livestock as roughly 96%36 of all 
mammal biomass (Bar-On et al., 2018; Ceballos et al., 2017). 
Perhaps the most popular among proxies used to visualize the ‘Anthropocene’ is the joint Earth 
System and socio-economic trend graphs charted by IGBP members representing the social and historical 
phenomenon known as the Great Acceleration (Steffen et al., 2015; Steffen et al., 2004c). According to 
McNeill and Engelke (2014, p. 213, note 4), the term ‘Great Acceleration’ was first used during the 96th 
Dahlem Workshop Held in June, 2005.37 The term drew inspiration from Karl Polanyi’s 1944 book The 
Great Transformation. The designation reflects a surge in socio-economic and Earth System trends, from 
population growth, primary energy use, water consumption, and international tourism, to atmospheric 
concentration of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane, ocean acidification, tropical forest loss, and 
domesticated land, that characterized the second half of the 20th century. These changes of unprecedented 
pace and rate in the history of humanity saw their first visual representation in the IGBP’s most relevant 
publication, the 2004 report Global Change and the Earth System: A Planet Under Pressure (Steffen et al., 2004c). 
The report uses two sets of twelve graphs each to visualize the major Earth System and socio-economic 
trends from 1750 to 2000, and their common peaks after 1950. In 2015, a research article published by Will 
Steffen and others on the then newly formed journal Anthropocene Review revised the graphs by providing 
 
36 The percentage (appearing, but not explained, on a Guardian article by Damian Carrington in 2018) is obtained by 
using data from Bar-On et al. (2018). According to their estimates, livestock, humans, and wild mammals constitute, 
respectively, 0.1, 0.06, and 0.007 Gt C (gigaton carbon, namely 1015 g of carbon) of all the Earth’s biomass. Summing 
up the total, humans and livestock together constitute 95.8% of mammals’ biomass. 
37 The Dahlem Workshop Series (or Dahlem Konferenzen) was a series of prestigious workshops that ran from 1974 
to 2012 and were hosted in Berlin, originally funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research 
Foundation) and the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Donors’ Association for German Science), and 
later supported by the Freie Universität of Berlin. The workshops (held in English) had around forty participants of 
international provenance discussing and working collectively on predetermined topics (originally scientific, although 
later workshops included contributions from human and social sciences). Paul Crutzen contributed twice as organizer, 
in 1992 (together with environmental scientist Johann Georg Goldammer) and 2003 (with climatologist Hans Joachim 
Schellnhuber and William C. Clark, a professor of international science, public policy, and human development).

new proxies for the socio-economic trends. Together, these two sets of graphs provided a conceptual 
toolkit to visualize the trajectory of the ‘Anthropocene’ (Steffen et al., 2015). 
With the increasing transformative role of humans on the planet, it became clear that any study of 
the Earth as a system would be incomplete if did not include the human factor. Studies on the 
biogeochemical cycles, or on the geophysical forces shaping the land surface, can now barely do without 
modelling human influences too. Thus, the Great Acceleration constitutes a double singularity: one in the 
history of humankind, and one in the history of the Earth System. In the former meaning, as explained, it 
identifies a historical time in (some) human civilizations where energy consumption has grown 
exponentially, with all causes and consequences linked to it. In the latter meaning, it identifies the pace 
through which a species (Homo sapiens) has so rapidly affected the Earth System. For instance, it took 
humans roughly two hundred years to double the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, or to fix more 
nitrogen than is produced naturally, severely affecting (among others) the global nitrogen cycle (Sullivan et 
al., 2014). These are just basic proxies signaling a singularity in the functioning of the Earth System. Humans 
are neither the first nor the only species actively modifying the Earth on a global scale. Precambrian 
cyanobacteria took about two-and-a-half billion years to oxygenate the atmosphere to the present state. 
Humans’ signature on the planet is very far from this scale. However, the means and pace at which humans 
are not just affecting the atmosphere, but all of the Earth’s biogeochemical cycles is unparalleled across 
extant living biota. 
How does the Earth System science narrative differ from the geological one? Although research 
on the ‘human factor’ in the Earth System is conducted in close proximity with anthropogenic stratigraphy 
– often sharing research objects, methods, language, publication outlets, and academic figures (scholars 
who work on the ‘Anthropocene’ in Earth System discourse are also members of the AWG) – there is one 
important difference. The geological narrative focuses on the utility of formalizing the Anthropocene on 
the geological time scale, whereas Earth System science does not necessarily aim at achieving formal 
recognition of a geological (viz. geochronological and chronostratigraphic) time unit. Geologists look at 
what represents stratigraphic evidence. Not every mark and signal left by human activities can be considered 
to be stratigraphically significant. This is particularly the case if envisioning the temporal depth of such 
marks and signals to an order of magnitude of thousands to millions of years in the future (an argument 
discussed in section 5.2.1). Therefore, not all evidence of humans’ influence on the Earth System does 
immediately translates into stratigraphic evidence. Nevertheless, evidence of a human-induced singularity 
on the Earth allowed Earth System scientists to hold to the term ‘Anthropocene’ as a useful scientific 
category, regardless of its formal stratigraphic status.  
 
1.2.3 The History of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
 
The ‘history of the Anthropocene,’ whether intended as a proposed geological time unit or as an Earth 
System singularity, has common conceptual ground (besides stemming from the natural sciences). In both 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
33 
 
narratives, the emphasis is placed on the definition and use of the term ‘Anthropocene.’ However, shifting 
the emphasis on the term ‘history’ rather than ‘Anthropocene,’ a substantially different approach emerges 
– namely, that of the historical roots of the Anthropocene, either as a geological time unit, singularity in the 
Earth System, or global historical phenomenon. This shift in emphasis transforms the ‘Anthropocene’ into 
a historical category. 
Historical approaches to the ‘Anthropocene’ have become a major research trend in Anthropocene 
Studies. Their link with the natural sciences is exquisitely rendered by Horn and Bergthaller in their 2020 
book The Anthropocene: Key Issues for the Humanities: “[t]he problems of scale raised by the Anthropocene are 
by no means restricted to questions of magnitude and the spatial dimensions of human agency […]. The 
term denotes a geological epoch, but to the extent that it has now become an important issue for the 
humanities, it must [emphasis added] also be viewed as a historical one” (Horn & Bergthaller, 2020, p. 157). 
Indeed, a second meaning that can be given to the phrase ‘history of the Anthropocene’ is ‘history of human 
societies behind or during the Anthropocene.’ This historicization of the epoch – what Bruno Latour 
addresses as “geo-story” (Latour, 2015, p. 154) – does not simply mean recounting the passive collection 
of all the historical occurrences coinciding with the emergence of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Rather, it means 
identifying the very historical causes that engendered it, namely, the modes of energy consumption among 
human societies that made this new epoch possible.  
Why “must” the ‘Anthropocene’ also denote a historical epoch? A short answer is that 
understanding the ‘Anthropocene’ phenomenon requires a specific understanding of the historical, social, 
and economic conditions that caused it. The complex forms of social organizations behind the emergence 
of this time unit cannot be merely deduced from the category Homo sapiens – namely, from the set of 
biological properties that makes and identifies us as a species (Hornborg, 2015). Recognizing the historical 
drivers of the ‘Anthropocene’ is thus advantageous for both historical and geological research – for 
example, in understanding whether humankind will remain “the active geological force it is today, or whether 
it will be simply an inertial geological force subsequent to just a few decades of intensive fossil fuel burning” 
(Semal, 2015, p. 88).38 
 
This historical research trend stems from a recurring theme in humanistic and social science 
scholarship on the ‘Anthropocene’ – that is, the convergence of geological and historical time. This theme 
seems to have been discussed for the first time (in the context of ‘Anthropocene’ research) by historian 
Dipesh Chakrabarty (2009) in his seminal paper “The Climate of History.” His first of four theses, 
“Anthropogenic Explanations of Climate Change Spell the Collapse of the Age-old Humanist Distinction 
between Natural History and Human History,” argues that attribution of geological agency to humans 
unwittingly implies dissolving the boundaries between human and geological history. Humans as a 
geological force is a separate, and more profound, claim than humans as biological agents, which 
Chakrabarty argues we have always been. Reflecting on the meaning of this convergence, the historian 
 
38 Section 3.1.1 provides an important clarification of the agency of humans in geological terms. While academic 
literature seems to identify humans as geological forces and agents interchangeably, a theoretical distinction between 
these two connotations is advanced. 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
34 
 
identifies in a later contribution (Chakrabarty, 2015) a collision between three histories: the Earth System 
history, the history of life on Earth, and the history of post-industrial capitalist civilizations. The 
‘Anthropocene’ locates at the nexus between these histories, therefore requiring a special kind of 
multidisciplinary attention. 
 
An important theme emerged from historical and humanistic scholarship concerns criticism of the 
seemingly unifying notion of Homo sapiens or ‘humans as geological agent’ that the scientific narrative seems 
to convey. This usage seems to disregard individual contributions to the dawn of the ‘Anthropocene,’ and 
attribution of responsibility, especially from those on the colonizing side of history (Bonneuil, 2015; 
Bonneuil & Fressoz, 2016). Contextualizing the ‘Anthropocene’ (Biermann et al., 2016) is not spurred solely 
by the necessity of eluding an all-inclusive narrative, but also from a methodological requirement. As stated 
by human geographers Andreas Malm and Half Hornborg (quoting Lewis Gaddis), using Homo sapiens as 
an epistemic category “is like explaining the success of the Japanese fighter pilots in terms of the fact that 
prehumans evolved binocular vision and opposable thumbs” (Malm & Hornborg, 2014, p. 64). It is not 
false per se; it is rather a poor methodological choice. This criticism (discussed again in section 5.1.1) holds 
that the ‘Anthropocene’ is not to be understood as a direct product of human biology, but rather a product 
of specific modes of existences defined by the establishment of capitalism as the main driver of the world 
economy, and coincidentally as the main source of disruption of the Earth System. Further stressing this 
point, Malm and Hornborg consider the roots of this new epoch not to be anthropogenic, but rather 
sociogenic (ibid.). It is not humans that brought about the ‘Anthropocene’ by virtue of their being humans. It 
was a specific socially and historically established order that engendered it. 
 
Considering the rise of capitalism in the ‘Western’ world as a turning point in the history of the 
‘Anthropocene’ has had scholars coming up with terminological variants – which have been proliferating 
and extending, in large numbers, well beyond historical considerations. Probably, the most compelling 
alternative in Anthropocene Studies has been the ‘Capitalocene.’ The term was first coined by Andreas 
Malm when he was a graduate student at Lund in 2009, publicized by economist David Ruccio (2011, 
quoted in Moore, 2016), used by Donna Haraway (2015) since 2012, and finally popularized by Jason Moore 
in his 2016 edited volume Anthropocene or Capitalocene? Nature, History, and the Crisis of Capitalism.39 Due to its 
popularity among the many terminological variants proposed, and being the hub of the historical discourse 
on the ‘Anthropocene,’ it is essential to spend a few lines on it. 
As the term itself suggests, authors supporting this provocative idea do not focus on the 
stratigraphy of humans as a geological agent, but rather reflect upon the ‘stratigraphy of capitalism.’ This 
metaphor suggests looking at the environmental footprint of capitalism as a worldwide economic system 
(or as Moore suggest, as a ‘world-ecology’) whose fundamental strategy consists of the ‘cheapening of 
Nature.’ Nature (as he intends, capitalized) is an ad hoc ontological category at the core of capitalism’s modes 
 
39 According to German environmental and science journalist Christian Schwägerl (2014, pp. 65, footnote 132), the 
term Capitalocene was coined by Freie Universität professor Elmar Altvater using its German variant ‘Kapitalozän,’ 
during a discussion at the German Council for Foreign Relations in Berlin. However, the year when the meeting took 
place is not specified. 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
35 
 
of existence that served (and serves) instrumentally to distinguish humans among humans, and nature 
among nature. This ‘Cheap Nature’ (Moore, 2015, 2016b) has two interrelated meanings: the cheapening – 
i.e., the “work/energy and biophysical utility produced with minimal labor-power, and directly implicated 
in commodity production and exchange” (Moore, 2016c, p. 99) – of the economic value of ‘Nature’; and 
its ethical degrading functional to its exploitation. The emergence of capitalism, with its roots in 16th-century 
power relations, can be read as the creation and appropriation of such Cheap Nature – the commodification 
of Nature set by the emerging, capitalist-oriented economic elites – and the adoption of political strategies, 
economic premises, and even ethical systems (see for instance White, 1967) to justify, legitimize, and 
ultimately implement this world-scale organization of Nature. As much postcolonial literature has stressed 
(e.g., Emmett & Lekan, 2016; Keerer, 2020; McQuillan, 2016; Swanson et al., 2015; Yusoff, 2019), such a 
world-system developed within a framework of systematic segregation and/or oppression of classes, races, 
genders, or minorities, and the polarization of capital and energy consumption, perpetrated by certain 
economic powers, such as states and trading companies.  
Moore’s conceptualization of ‘Capitalocene’ seeks to bring to light the historical and existing 
relations of Cheap Nature – relations that consisted (among others) in unbalanced forms of energy 
consumption, and thus in different attributions of responsibility toward anthropogenic environmental 
degradation across nations and societies. It also looks at the origins of capitalism as a world-ecology system 
that set the premises of much of today’s organizational schemes of the web of life – including the ongoing 
sixth mass extinction event in the Earth’s history (Ceballos et al., 2015; Ceballos et al., 2017; also discussed 
in section 3.1.2.4 in the context of biostratigraphy; Kolbert, 2014). In doing so, it also poses a critique to 
the geological narrative of the ‘Anthropocene,’ especially to its seemingly implicit subsumption of human 
cultures under an all-inclusive definition of Anthropos. ‘Anthropocene’ scholars have denounced this 
conceptual maneuver (see section 5.1.1), warning against a subtle reintroduction of a Cartesian dualism in 
the form of Anthropos and Nature, or the narrative’s blindness to the relations between human societies and 
to capitalism as a ‘world-ecology.’ Moreover, the historical analysis challenges the historical account 
implicitly provided by the Earth System narrative, which locates the cradle of the ‘Anthropocene’ in the 
Industrial Revolution. Moore argues that in order to understand the origins of capitalism, and hence how 
we entered the ‘Anthropocene,’ we must look back to the 16th-century birth of Cheap Nature and Cheap 
Labor. Hence, locating (or limiting) the dawn of the ‘Anthropocene’ to the English Industrial Revolution 
implies ignoring centuries of capitalism-in-the-making, including the global-scale impact of colonialism.  
Criticism to an all-inclusive discourse opened up the possibility of multiple ‘Anthropocenes,’ such 
as ‘African Anthropocene’ (Hecht, 2018), ‘Asian Anthropocene’ (Chatterjee, 2020; Kwai-Cheung & Yeung, 
2019), or the ‘billion black Anthropocenes’ of Kathryn Yusoff (2019) – the latter introducing postcolonial 
black feminist literature into Anthropocene Studies. Integrating ethnographic approaches to social and 
historical analysis, these arguments provide alternative historical accounts that do not fall within an all-
inclusive and partial history of the world. Being already in the ‘Anthropocene’, all humans must face, in one 
way or another, the consequences of having entered this new Earth System state and/or geological epoch. 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
36 
 
However, how to experience it varies differently, hence not one but many experienced ‘Anthropocenes’ exist. 
This criticism is considered separately in Chapter 5. 
Moore, and advocates of the ‘Capitalocene’ idea, seem to propose the term in opposition to that 
of ‘Anthropocene.’ They do not necessarily promote this within the geological arena, but rather in the 
broader discussion of anthropogenic impacts on the planet. The term ‘Anthropocene,’ they argue, seems 
to dissolve this discussion by implementing a geological and Earth System narrative that unifies humanity 
under a unique, responsible agent. More importantly, the ‘Anthropocene’ is blind to the historical and 
ethical questions that it implicitly posits. However, the ‘Capitalocene’ idea should not be understood in 
opposition – neither as a contradiction nor as a semantically conflictual concept unit – to that of 
‘Anthropocene.’ Rather, the notions complement each other. Indeed, the ‘Capitalocene’ constitutes 
simultaneously an intellectual provocation and an integrative epistemic feature of the ‘Anthropocene.’ As 
an intellectual provocation, it challenges important aspects of the broader narrative developing from the 
scientific agenda, warning on issues at the intersection of science, politics, and the public sphere. As an 
integrative epistemic feature, it tells us what the ‘Anthropocene’ is and how it came to be through a historical 
lens – a focus that geosciences, in virtue of their own modes of knowledge-making, cannot fully reproduce. 
The historical approach unveils the social and cultural mechanisms (modes of relations, production, energy 
consumption, cultural drivers, etc.) that fueled the most environmentally transforming, and maybe most 
characteristically complex and peculiar, mode of existence in human history. The geological approach looks 
at the stratigraphic remnants of these social and cultural mechanisms. 
An example of this historical approach is John McNeill and Peter Engelke’s analysis of the 
environmental history of the ‘Anthropocene’ in their classic 2014 work The Great Acceleration (McNeill & 
Engelke, 2014). Without rejecting nor posing terminological alternatives to the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
– which places the beginning of the new epoch in the 1950s – the authors focus on what caused and 
characterized the surge in socio-economic trends that since 1945 have brought human societies into an 
unprecedent stage of energy production and consumption. The fossil fuel-based abundance of cheap energy 
that characterized many modern societies especially during the second half of the 20th century constitutes 
the center of the environmental history of the ‘Anthropocene,’ to the extent that “from almost any 
viewpoint energy seems to be at the heart of the new epoch” (p. 40). During this half-decade alone, global 
energy use increased fivefold with oil, coal, and natural gas representing 87% of global energy sources. This 
radical shift in energy production and consumption is co-amplified by an increasing world population, 
seemingly ever-expanding urbanization, and unprecedented global economic growth that set a path for 
“profound consequences for the world’s air, water, and soil, as well as for human health” (p. 38). Some of 
these consequences will last in the deep future of geological time, making them characteristics of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ Henceforth, the Great Acceleration, originally a term linked to an analysis of socio-
historical nature, also represents an (environmental) analysis of the causes and characteristics of the 
proposed concept. And it does so by complementing, rather than opposing, the scientific research 
conducted by the AWG. 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
37 
 
The analysis of McNeill and Engelke assumes the beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ to be that 
promoted by the AWG. Therefore, its environmental history is only limited to the second half of the 20th 
century. Unlike Moore’s, their analysis does not directly address capitalism and its roots as the main driver 
of the ‘Anthropocene,’ and only marginally extends to the onset of the Industrial Revolution. However, by 
locating cheap energy as the most characteristic feature of the new epoch, their approach resonates with 
the concepts of Cheap Nature and Cheap Labor drawn by Moore, implicitly considering these as 
characteristic features of the ‘Anthropocene.’ In doing so, McNeill and Engelke are addressing the link 
between capitalism and the ‘Anthropocene,’ providing a historically detailed and numerically explicative 
ontology of the epoch. Such analysis does not collide, neither conceptually nor linguistically, with the 
meaning the term ‘Anthropocene’ assumes within the scientific discourse. On the contrary, it provides 
further historical and sociological material to foster multidisciplinary research, compensating for levels and 
modes of analysis that the natural sciences, and in particular geological research, do not traditionally deepen 
into. Furthermore, by providing a localized environmental history of the ‘Anthropocene,’ McNeill and 
Engelke’s analysis shows how the term – a practical label more than a macro-category – does not commit 
the sin of unifying the diverse roles and responsibilities of human societies in engendering the epoch. This 
is clear once the work of environmental historians and scientists interested in the ‘Anthropocene’ is 
understood as one research trajectory. 
Considered from this perspective, the concepts of ‘Capitalocene’ and ‘Anthropocene’ are not 
opposed to one another, but are rather two faces of the same coin. They constitute different modes of 
approaching the same object – that is, humans’ geological agency. Their differences lie in the methodologies 
of analysis: the historical approach looks at the social, economic, cultural, and political drivers; the geological 
approach looks at the stratigraphic (among other) evidence, and translates it in the context of deep time. 
 
Capitalocene, Anglocene, Plantationocene, Technocene (López-Corona & Magallanes-Guijón, 
2020), Chthulucene, and so forth: this wide spectrum of wordplays is not strictly speaking part of the 
geological conversation on formal recognition on the geological time scale. Rather, these neologisms all 
constitute intellectual provocations or theoretical addition. They stress specific ontological features of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ highlighting one or more crucial social, ecological, or historical aspects that characterize 
the proposed epoch. In short, whilst the scientific narrative asks whether we are now living in the 
‘Anthropocene’ (Zalasiewicz et al., 2008b), the historical narratives asks how and why we are living in the 
‘Anthropocene’ (Moore, 2016c),40 and what can be done about it. The environmental-historical line of 
research, where most of these variants originate, does not just stress the ontological and epistemological 
plurality of the ‘Anthropocene’ – it also embraces profound normative claims and goals. This approach is 
 
40 Jason Moore (2016c) takes this point as a form of criticism of the ‘dominant argument,’ which he considers to be 
the scientific one. The historian argues that this argument is not capable of answering the very question of how the 
‘Anthropocene’ came to be without falling into a collection of data – such as demography, technological improvement, 
or energy consumption – that are supposedly blind to the common underlying organizational system that he traces in 
capitalism.

representative of what is defined in section 1.3.1 as the ‘normative Anthropocene,’ which differs in 
methods, scope, and aim from the ‘descriptive Anthropocene.’ 
 
1.2.4 The History of the ‘Anthropocene’ Idea 
 
A fourth approach to the ‘history of the Anthropocene’ is looking at the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ as 
theoretical and linguistic entity. This is a particularly pertinent approach for the present research because, 
if the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis ought to be reconstructed, then it is necessary to first consider 
the broader intellectual and conceptual history of the ‘Anthropocene’ idea. Before proceeding, it is 
important here to make a preliminary linguistic remark. 
The present chapter highlighted an issue of definition emerging within Anthropocene Studies, and 
the burden is poses on extant ‘Anthropocene’ scholarship especially in terms of outlining a multidisciplinary 
framework. A reflection of this issue is that existing literature often implements the term ‘Anthropocene’ 
as in ‘time unit,’ ‘Earth System singularity,’ ‘historical time,’ and as an ‘idea’ interchangeably. Although 
usually the ‘type’ of ‘Anthropocene’ is more or less implicitly defined in the research texts, it is still important 
from an analytical standpoint to clarify which meaning is adopted. In fact, this clarification is at the very 
core of the four interpretations of ‘history of the Anthropocene’ outlined in this chapter. As anticipated at 
the beginning of the chapter, quotation marks are used to identify the ‘Anthropocene’ as the broader 
boundary object or theoretical/linguistic entity, differentiating it from the Anthropocene a proposed 
geological time unit, and from the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
Similar linguistic remarks have been raised by ‘Anthropocene’ scholars. For instance, Ruddiman et 
al. (2015) argue that a lowercase ‘anthropocene’ would “allow for modifiers appropriate to the specific 
interval under discussion, such as early agricultural or industrial” (ibid., p. 39). Closer to the strategy adopted 
in the present research, geologist Valentín Rull (2018) noted the necessity of distinguishing the 
Anthropocene from other formal units on a linguistic level. His observation originated from the issue of 
implicitly assuming the epoch-scale of the Anthropocene by using the ‘-cene’ suffix, used for the seven 
epochs of the Cenozoic Era. He argues that, as the proposed time unit is not yet associated with a formal 
taxonomical level, its informal nature should be underlined by using quotation marks. However, using 
quotation marks does not aim at differentiating between formal and informal units, in that informal 
designations, such as ‘Precambrian,’ are commonly used in geological contexts without quotation marks. 
Rather, this distinction is functional to an historical-epistemological analysis of the term, such as the kind 
hereby being conducted. Henceforth the quotation marks to identify the ‘Anthropocene’ as theoretical 
entity, and boundary object. 
This simple, yet scarcely acknowledged, terminological differentiation is at the core of much 
misunderstanding on the meaning(s) of, and claims on, the ‘Anthropocene’ both as conceptual entity and 
proposed time unit. That is the case with criticism toward the Anthropocene (as in geological time unit) as 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
39 
 
an anthropocentric concept.41 This is an interesting line of argument, as the ‘Age of Humans’ (as it popularly 
translates) can be easily interpreted in the possessive genitive. Furthermore, as pointed out by posthumanist 
critics Astrida Neimanis, Cecilia Åsberg, and Johan Hedrén, naming a geological epoch after us “does not 
necessarily demonstrate the humility we may need to espouse” (Neimanis et al., 2015, p. 68). On the 
contrary, it might legitimize any techno-centered, managerial-like approaches (such as geoengineering, as 
commonly argued by humanists and social scientists) that ultimately express new forms of 
anthropocentrism. However, it is often unclear whether this criticism addresses the term, the idea, the time 
unit, the Earth System singularity, or the overall narrative associated with the ‘Anthropocene.’ Without 
proper clarification, criticism risks standing up a straw man. 
An additional example of this confusion is an article published by The Atlantic on August 13, 2019, 
by Peter Brannen. The author made an interesting statement against the Anthropocene time unit, 
advocating that it should be considered an event rather than an epoch. His criticism toward the term went 
even further, arguing that an Anthropocene unit is “evidence of little more than our own species’ 
astounding anthropocentrism,” serving to “inflate humanity’s legacy” by “promising eternal geological life 
to our creations” (Brannen, 2019a). Therefore, as his article’s title clearly states, the Anthropocene is a 
‘joke.’  
A quick response signed by AWG members (Wing et al., 2019) arguing how the Anthropocene is 
not hubris, but merely a recognition of facts, had Brannen changing his mind entirely. The AWG stressed 
the geologically deep mark left by humans especially on the biosphere, detouring the history of life on the 
planet by the action of a single species, over a very short (but yet to fully unravel) time span. This legacy 
will persist with or without us. Hence, Brannen’s original article, which he retracted in a subsequent 
publication in The Atlantic published later the same year (Brannen, 2019b), confused the actual state of 
affairs that humans have caused, and that will persist in the future, with claims of anthropocentrism. The 
‘Age of Humans’ does not make the ‘Anthropocene’ a state of affairs humans possess (i.e., the of is not 
possessive), but rather a state of affairs humans have left an imprint upon. 
There are other examples supporting the necessity of linguistic clarity in Anthropocene Studies. 
However, in the context of the present research, this digression serves to illustrate the intrinsic polysemy 
that the term has assumed, and therefore the necessity of clarity in any given research about which facets of 
the ‘Anthropocene’ are being addressed. This is particularly necessary when distinguishing among different 
interpretations and variants of the broader ‘Anthropocene’ concept.  
Linguistic and conceptual clarity is especially important in delineating the history of the concept. 
This research trend looks at the history of the concept, its conceptual roots, its evolution over time, and its 
present meaning. Generally, two positions are identifiable in terms of how a history of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept should be constructed, each approaching the ‘Anthropocene’ with different claims, intents, goals, 
 
41 In fact, even in this sentence it is hard to assess whether to use quotation marks or not, given that criticism often 
does not make explicit whether the concept or the epoch itself is anthropocentric.

and methodologies. These can be named continuism and discontinuism.42 In the context of the present doctoral 
research, understanding the differences between these opposing views is important in framing the 
birthplace and time of the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
 
1.2.4.1 Continuism 
 
The main argument of this position holds that the ‘Anthropocene’ has historical and conceptual precursors 
that date as far back as the late 18th century.43 This argument often derives the conclusion that the 
‘Anthropocene’ is not a properly new nor utterly original idea, but rather a theoretical revenant under the 
guise of contemporary geological and Earth System scientific language (Syvitski, 2012).  
 
Authors embracing this stance identify semantic continuities (hence ‘continuism’) between past ideas 
resembling, anticipating, or informing the ‘Anthropocene,’ and they do so by adopting a genealogical 
method of analysis. Some authors (Autin & Holbrook, 2012; Bonneuil, 2015; Bonneuil & Fressoz, 2016; 
Lewis & Maslin, 2018a; Morrison, 2015) trace a genealogy to prove the existence of awareness and 
reflexivity on the impact of humans on the environment from a local to global scale (hence rejecting the 
idea of the ‘Anthropocene’ being a totally new concept). Others genealogical endeavors simply look at 
conceptual and historical predecessors to enrich the humanistic contribution to the debate, identifying 
possible theoretical continuities or differences between the ‘Anthropocene’ and supposed antecedents, or 
to strengthen the theoretical foundations of the new epoch (Horn & Bergthaller, 2020, pp. 35-44; Steffen 
et al., 2011a). In each case, genealogy plays a central role in assessing the history of the term. 
But what does this method consist of? As a philosophical method, genealogy is a historical-
hermeneutical form of analysis focusing on the relationship between discourse and language on the one 
hand, and structures of power on the other (Sax, 1989) in an attempt to understand the emergence – either 
contingent or necessary – of beliefs, ideas, and particularly moral values. The genealogical method has been 
widely popularized through the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, especially in his 1887 book On the Genealogy of 
Morality. Here, the German philosopher and philologist sets out to find the origin of “our moral prejudices,” 
contraposing his theory of ressentiment44 to the genealogical hypotheses of the “English kind”45 (Nietzsche, 
 
42 A comprehensive overview of these two opposing stances is provided by Horn and Bergthaller (2020, chap. 3). 
Horn (author of the chapter) refers to the continuist and discontinuist stances as, respectively, the ‘historicizing’ and 
the ‘presentist’ approach, generally identifying historians Christophe Bonneuil and Jean-Baptiste Fressoz with the 
former, and philosopher Clive Hamilton with the latter. Interestingly, she argues that in many ways this divide reflects 
C. P. Snow’s ‘two cultures,’ in that it tends to polarize the role of the natural sciences and the humanities in 
conceptualizing the ‘Anthropocene,’ and thus in delineating its history. 
43 Horn (in Horn & Bergthaller, 2020) considers Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon’s 1778 text Epochs of Nature 
to be, on a speculative level, the “first document of Anthropocene thought” (ibid., p. 39). Buffon is also considered 
by Lewis and Maslin (2015a, 2018a) as the earliest conceptual precursor of the term. 
44 On ressentiment, Nietzsche argues: “The continuing and predominant feeling of complete and fundamental 
superiority of a higher ruling kind in relation to a lower kind, to those ‘below’ – that is the origin of the antithesis 
‘good’ and ‘bad’” (p. 12). This is a central statement in defining his theory of history and his genealogical approach. 
45 Nietzsche is referring to the “English psychologists,” namely, those of the English empiricist tradition, whom he 
considers to be “actually interesting” (p. 10) yet lacking “historical spirit” (p. 11). 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’

2006, p. 4). In Beyond Good and Evil, published in 1886, Nietzsche also contraposes his genealogical method 
to the logical systems of deduction of values developed by Kant and Hegel. Consistent with the continental 
style of philosophical inquiry (and with his own trademark writing style), Nietzsche’s genealogical analysis 
– whose primary focus is the genealogy of European moral values – should be understood as a unique 
hermeneutical approach to history based on a constellation of complex concepts that resonate throughout 
his entire work and personal life, rather than a strict analytical methodology. 
Nietzsche’s genealogical analysis became an object of interest of French philosophers during the 
second half of the 20th century, particularly Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault. In his 1962 book Nietzsche 
and Philosophy, Deleuze locates his considerations of Nietzsche’s account of genealogy at the very beginning 
of the text, providing the reader with the following definition: 
 
Genealogy means both the value of origin and the origin of values. Genealogy is as opposed to 
absolute values as it is to relative or utilitarian ones. Genealogy signifies the differential element of 
values from which their value itself derives. Genealogy thus means origin or birth, but also 
difference or distance in the origin. Genealogy means nobility and baseness, nobility and vulgarity, 
nobility and decadence in the origin. The noble and the vulgar, the high and the low – this is the 
truly genealogical and critical element. (Deleuze, 1983) 
 
Deleuze’s idea of genealogy gravitates around two concepts, those of ‘sign’ and ‘forces’ (Pearson, 2007). To 
him, phenomena do not appear in the form of absolute values, nor are they dissolved into relativism. 
Phenomena or ‘things’ appear in the form of signs, which are interpreted by the existing interplay of forces 
that appropriate “the thing, which exploits it, which takes possession of it or is expressed in it” to the extent 
that the “history of a thing, in general, is the succession of forces which take possession of it” (Deleuze, 
1983, p. 3). Therefore, the meaning – or, in Deleuze’s terms, the ‘sense’ – of a thing can only be understood 
in the relation to the forces that appropriate that thing. Consequently, ‘sense’ is always a plurality, a complex 
network of coexisting meanings whose histories are unveiled by genealogy. 
As for Nietzsche, it is not easy to frame a rigorous ‘methodology’ in Deleuze’s account of genealogy. 
Likewise, Foucault’s reading of Nietzsche and his genealogy takes a densely symbolical turn that escapes 
the common definition of ‘method.’ His definition of genealogy can be traced to his 1971 essay “Nietzsche, 
Genealogy, History,” in which Foucault argues that 
 
Genealogy is gray [emphasis added], meticulous, and patiently documentary. It operates on a field 
of entangled and confused parchments, on documents that have been scratched over and recopied 
many times […] [Genealogy] must record the singularity of events outside of any monotonous 
finality; it must seek them in the most unpromising places, in what we tend to feel is without history 
– in sentiments, love, conscience, instincts; it must be sensitive to their recurrence, not in order to 
trace the gradual curve of their evolution, but to isolate the different scenes where they engaged in 
different roles. Finally, genealogy must define even those instances when they are absent, the 
moment when they remained unrealized (Plato, at Syracuse, did not become Mohammed). 
(Foucault, 1977)46 
 
46 The English translation was published in 1977 (see bibliography). However, the original French article was published 
in 1971 in Hommage a Jean Hyppolite, a book edited by Suzanne Bachelard. 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
42 
 
 
The color gray, a metaphor which Foucault borrows from Nietzsche,47 epitomizes clearly the fieldwork of 
genealogists. According to the French philosopher, genealogies – to be distinguished from ‘histories’ – do 
not aim at unveiling an ultimate origin containing an immanent truth actively transmitting its properties 
from past to present (and nor does history). On the contrary, they walk through the labyrinth of history, 
filled with accidents, dead-ends, details, and fragments, “to dispel the chimeras of the origin” (ibid. p. 5, 
emphasis added). Genealogy in its historical sense, namely in its being parodic (meaning offering alternative 
identities by venerating the past), dissociative (meaning dissolving a uniform historical identity into a 
heterogeneous plurality), and sacrificial (meaning possessing the danger of sacrificing the subject to the ‘will 
to knowledge’), is to Foucault the “undermining of all forms of historically grounded truth claims” (Molina; 
Sax, 1989).  
Dwelling on the meaning of genealogy between Nietzsche, Deleuze, and Foucault is well beyond 
the scope of this section, and outside the overall goal of the chapter.48 For the present purpose, this 
digression is important to highlight the complex nature of genealogical research. What system of values 
must genealogical research be aware of when engaging with the ‘Anthropocene’ from a normative 
standpoint, and what system of values does it call for? What forces shaped precursors of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ and to what degree have they changed, and are changing, the plurality of its sense? What 
parodic, dissociative, and sacrificial elements can be found in the genealogy of the ‘Anthropocene’? These 
questions are crucial in the genealogical research of the ‘Anthropocene,’ and require additional research. 
Such is the task yet to be extensively tackled by philosophers and historians of ideas in Anthropocene 
Studies.  
Research on conceptual precursors has been an endeavor conducted since the very first article that 
popularized the term ‘Anthropocene’ in contemporary debate, namely, Paul Crutzen and Eugene 
Stoermer’s notorious IGBP Newsletter article published in May 2000 (Crutzen & Stoermer, 2000).49 A short 
genealogy of the term is provided at the beginning of this brief article. George Perkins Marsh and Antonio 
Stoppani are considered pioneers in recognizing humans as a geological and morphological force during 
the 18th century – with Stoppani using the term ‘Anthropozoic’ to identify a human-induced geological time 
unit. The Russian geologist Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky, together the French philosophers Pierre 
Teilhard de Chardin and Édouard Le Roy, are often mentioned (e.g., Crutzen & Stoermer, 2000; Lewis & 
Maslin, 2015a; Steffen et al., 2011a) for using the term ‘Noösphere’ during the 1920s – a term stressing the 
role of humankind’s brainpower in relation to its becoming a geological agent. 
 
47 “At any rate, I wanted to focus this sharp, unbiased eye in a better direction, the direction of a real history of morality, 
and to warn him, while there was still time, against such English hypothesis-mongering into the blue. It is quite clear 
which colour is a hundred times more important for a genealogist than blue: namely grey, which is to say, that which 
can be documented, which can actually be confirmed and has actually existed, in short, the whole, long, hard-to-
decipher hieroglyphic script of man’s moral past!” (Nietzsche, 2006, p. 8). 
48 On the differences between the two genealogical methods, see Sax, 1989. 
49 The term ‘Anthropocene’ seems to have first appeared on written records in English translations of Russian geology 
journals ("Paleontologicheskiy Zhurnal 1966, no. 1," 1966; Vinogradov et al., 1968). The term was informally used 
during classes by Eugene Stoermer, but was never given the weight it holds today. 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
43 
 
The genealogical approach gained momentum, and in later years it developed into a discrete 
research trend within Anthropocene Studies. In 2011, together with Paul Crutzen, Jacques Grinevald (a 
French historian of science and AWG member), John McNeill, and Will Steffen published a research article 
entitled “The Anthropocene: Conceptual and Historical Perspectives” in which a seminal overview of the 
‘Anthropocene’ genealogy was provided (Steffen et al., 2011a). This became the first of a series of dedicated 
genealogical analyses conducted in major publications in Anthropocene Studies that looked for historical, 
theoretical, and conceptual antecedents. Some examples are Lewis and Maslin’s (2015a) Nature article 
“Defining the Anthropocene,”50 and the introductory chapter of the AWG’s latest scientific summary The 
Anthropocene as a Geological Time Unit (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b). An interesting analysis conducted by 
Hermann Häusler traces a genealogical tree of the ‘Anthropocene’ in 19th- and early 20th-century Austrian–
German geological literature, especially with the development of the discipline of ‘anthropogeology’ 
(Häusler, 2017), formed during the 1950s and later replaced by environmental geology.  
 So far, many names, events, and ideas have been considered as precursors of the ‘Anthropocene,’ 
from Alexander von Humboldt, Buffon, Thomas Jenkyn, George Perkins Marsh, Joseph Le Conte (who 
coined the term ‘Psychozoic’), and Stoppani, to Vernadsky, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Édouard Le Roy, 
Aleksei Pavlov (who used the term ‘Anthropogene’ for the Quaternary), and Henry Bergson (Lewis & 
Maslin, 2015a; Steffen et al., 2011a). These names do not exhaust the list of past geologists, philosophers, 
and naturalists who seemingly foresaw the role of humankind as a geological and environmental agent. In 
more recent genealogies, precursors are found in events discussing humans’ geological agency, such as the 
1955 Princeton symposium Man’s Role in Changing the Face of the Earth, or in linguistically similar terms, 
such as ‘Anthropozoikum’ (Ehlers & Krafft, 2006b, p. 5, quoting Markl, 1986) or ‘Anthrocene’ (Revkin, 
1992).51 
Providing a short genealogy of the term (i.e., historicizing the ‘Anthropocene’) has by now become 
a common – if not almost mandatory – practice in ‘Anthropocene’-related publications, often introducing 
research articles, monographs, or even seeing entire dedicated book chapters. Master’s and doctoral theses 
are part of the list too. This is certainly a valuable contribution – especially from the humanities – to 
Anthropocene Studies that provides a background of ideas and genealogies against which the 
‘Anthropocene’ can be compared and discussed. However, the ‘dominance’ of the genealogical approach 
came at the expense of a more recently focused historical and epistemological analysis of the term. In 
addition, some scholars have questioned the validity and scope of this genealogical endeavor. This 
questioning is the starting point of the discontinuist stance. 
 
 
50 The article later turned into the first chapter of their 2018 book The Human Planet (Lewis & Maslin, 2018a). 
51 A useful visual illustration and comprehensive catalogue of important events, names, and conceptual precursors is 
provided by Sophie Yeo (2016) on her online exhibition Anthropocene: Journey to a New Geological Epoch, available online 
at https://www.carbonbrief.org/anthropocene-journey-to-new-geological-epoch (accessed on May 23, 2021). 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
44 
 
1.2.4.2 Discontinuism 
 
The underlying argument of ‘discontinuism’ holds that the ‘Anthropocene’ represents a theoretical 
singularity that has little or no semantic continuity with any past concepts, ideas, or narratives appearing to 
anticipate it in one way or another. Therefore, the continuist stance is wrong in identifying conceptual and 
theoretical antecedents in past ideas or narratives, for these are substantially different from that of the 
‘Anthropocene.’  
Philosopher Clive Hamilton has been championing this criticism toward the genealogical approach 
since his 2015 article “Was the Anthropocene anticipated?” was published with Grinevald in The 
Anthropocene Review (Hamilton & Grinevald, 2015). His arguments against the continuist stance are multiple. 
First, he argues that the ‘Anthropocene’ emerged in the context of Earth System science, a recent and 
revolutionary approach in the study of the Earth merging a diversified spectrum of disciplines. As also 
outlined in 1.2.2, this approach incorporated system theory in studying the Earth’s biogeochemical 
processes. This new set of methodologies and concepts engendered a new conceptual framework for 
assessing the impact of humans on the functioning of the Earth System. None of the proposed conceptual 
predecessors – especially those dating back to centuries ago – developed within this novel framework, 
which constitutes a distinctive feature of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
Second, the search for precursors is often misguided by what Hamilton and Grinevald see as a 
“deflationary move” (Hamilton & Grinevald, 2015, p. 2) – namely, the ‘downsizing’ of the importance of 
the ‘Anthropocene’ as an Earth System singularity and as a geological time unit. Whether unwittingly or 
intentionally, this move, they argue, does not reflect the epistemic novelty that the term entails, nor 
understands the scientific context informing it. Furthermore, as multiple normative claims have been 
attributed to the new epoch, diminishing its importance may implicitly detract from the call for action that 
much environmentalism has advanced in the past decades by reintroducing the logic of ‘nature-as-usual.’ 
Third, continuists are motivated by a fundamental misunderstanding of the science informing the 
‘Anthropocene.’ This argument follows from the first one, namely, the importance of Earth System science 
in defining the term. Hamilton argues that many scholars, including scientists, often misrepresent the 
‘Anthropocene’ as the global impact of humans on the world’s ecosystems, on its landscapes, or on the 
global environment (Hamilton, 2015, 2017). This is not what the ‘Anthropocene’ represents, as the terms 
‘environment’ or ‘world ecosystems’ do not entirely represent its ontological reality and specificity. Rather, 
the concept reflects the human influence on the Earth as a system, which is reflected both on the alternation 
of its functioning and in the stratigraphic signature – among others. Hamilton considers these aspects as 
something more profound and meaningful than the oversimplified ‘environmental impact’ category that he 
sees often associated with the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. 
Fourth, the quest for finding precursors is based on an epistemological fallacy not too rare in the 
history of scientific ideas – that is, confusing correlation with causation. To summarize this argument 
through the words of philosopher and historian of science Alexandre Koyré: 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
45 
 
 
We must not forget, moreover, that “influence” is not a simple, but on the contrary, a very complex, 
bilateral relation. We are not influenced by everything we read or learn. In one sense, and perhaps 
the deepest, we ourselves determine the influences we are submitting to; our intellectual ancestors 
are by no means given to, but are freely chosen by, us. (Koyré, 1957, pp. 5-6) 
 
In addition to Hamilton’s criticism, a fifth argument can be raised against continuism. It involves the 
terminological and semantic misuse of presumed theoretical precursors. This practice is often accompanied 
by misquotation among scholars in Anthropocene Studies generating historical anachronisms and 
inaccuracies. For instance, in a research paper by Hermann Häusler, the author states that the “geologist 
and priest Samuel Haughton (1821–1897) published a new Manual of Geology and introduced the 
Anthropocene as the epoch in which we live” (Häusler, 2017, p. 70). His bibliographical reference for this 
statement is Lewis and Maslin (2015a). Contrary to what is expressed by Häusler, Lewis and Maslin do not 
claim that Haughton introduced the term or the epoch, but rather that he “describes the Anthropozoic 
[emphasis added] as the ‘epoch in which we live’” (ibid., p. 172). In his 1865 Manual of Geology, Haughton 
proposed new terms for James Dwight Dana’s classification of geological time: 
 
Professor Dana proposed to divide the world into five ages, which might be called the age of 
Mollusks, the age of Fishes, the age of Reptiles, the age of Mammals, and the age of Man. / For 
These terms, I would substitute the following equivalents: The Malacozoic, Ichthyozoic, Saurozoic, 
Mastocoiz, and Anthropozoic Epochs. (Haughton, 1865, p. 138) 
 
Despite the terminological similarity, Haughton’s (as well as other authors adopting the term, including 
Antonio Stoppani52) Anthropozoic has a different meaning, time span, evidence, and conceptual framework 
than our present understanding of the Anthropocene proposed unit. Exchanging the two terms freely is a 
form of anachronism that should be avoided. 
Another example of this form of anachronism can be found in philosopher Ian Angus’s Fossil 
Capitalism (2016), where the author claims, “In 1922, the Soviet geologist Aleksei Petrovich Pavlov 
proposed Anthropocene or Anthropogene [emphasis added] as a name for the time since the first humans 
evolved about 160,000 years ago” (ibid., p. 27). Here, the anachronism is even more evident by explicitly 
taking the two terms as synonyms. In the foreword to Angus’s book, John Bellamy Foster writes, “The 
appearance of Vernadsky’s book corresponded to the first introduction of the term Anthropocene (together 
with Anthropogene) by his colleague, the Soviet geologist Aleksei Pavlov, who used it to refer to a new 
geological period in which humanity was the main driver of planetary geological change” (ibid., p. 11). 
Vernadsky’s book in question is The Biosphere, published in 1926. It is around those years, incidentally the 
last of his life, that Pavlov “used to speak of the anthropogenic era, in which we now live” (Vernadsky, 2014, 
 
52 Antonio Stoppani was an Italian priest and geologist of the 19th century. His work (Stoppani, 1867, 1873) has been 
recently rediscovered throughout the genealogical research on the Anthropocene because of his use of the term 
‘Anthropozoic’ (in Italian: ‘Antropozoico’). A translated excerpt from his work largely cited in Anthropocene literature 
is provided by Federighi (2013). For an overview of Stoppani’s contribution to the geosciences, see Lucchesi (2017).

p. 80). However, no bibliographical reference is provided by Foster for the claim that Pavlov used both 
terms – simply because the Russian geologist never used the term ‘Anthropocene’ in first place. Contrary 
to what Foster argues, Pavlov only introduced and characterized the ‘Anthropogene,’ and in a substantially 
different fashion than that of the present characterization of the ‘stratigraphic Anthropocene.’ 
Pavlov seems to have first introduced the term ‘Anthropogene’ in a 1922 article written in French 
for the geological section of the Bulletin de la Société des naturalistes de Moscou.53 The article (“Epoques glaciares 
et intérglaciaires de l’Europe et leur rapport à l’histoire de l’homme fossile”54) was based on a speech 
previously held for the annual session of the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg on December 29, 1921. 
It discussed, as the title suggests, the alternate glacial and interglacial phases from the Pliocene to the present 
day. It is in the conclusive section of the text that the French term ‘Anthropogène’ appears in the context 
of a proposed tripartition of the Tertiary Era: 
Je termine cet essai par un vœu. Il serait temps de renoncer à la nomenclature instable incommode 
et contre-historienne de la dernière ère géologique. Le nom tertiaire conviendrait mieux pour 
désigner l’ère (et le groupe) et non pas la période. Cela correspondrait au développement historique 
de la science (Arduino). L’ère tertiaire pourrait être subdivisée en trois périodes: Paléogène – période 
des anciens genres des mammifères, Néogène – période des nouveaux genre des mammifères et 
Anthropogène – période du genre humain. (Pavlov, 1922, p. 76)55 
 
In Pavlov’s proposal, the Anthropogene replaces the quaternary (lowercase by Pavlov) as the last period of 
the Tertiary, itself replacing the Cenozoic Era (which has been reestablished in today’s geological time 
scale). Whereas no (absolute) dating is provided along the text in terms of time range, Pavlov identifies the 
“période du genre humain” as commencing with alternate periods of glaciations, and the appearance of the 
first traces of humans in Europe. Notably, Pavlov cites stone tools, eoliths, and the Piltdown Man as proxies 
for the beginning of the quaternary/Anthropogene (ibid., pp. 72–73). All these proxies are deeply 
problematic, especially when a comparison between the Anthropogene and the Anthropocene is at stake. 
Already in 1905, skepticism toward the artificial nature of eoliths – flint mineral aggregates (i.e., ‘nodules’) 
believed to be ancient artifacts – begun to arise (Warren, 1905). The skepticism was confirmed during the 
20th century, proving eoliths to occur naturally rather than being a product of ancient craftmanship 
(O’Connor, 2003). The Piltdown Man, supposedly the missing link between humans and apes discovered 
by Charles Dawson in 1912, was exposed as a scientific hoax in 1953 (Webb, 2016), and is now considered 
one of the greatest scientific forgeries in the history of British science (Bartlett, 2011). 
 
The use of stone tools was a shared proxy for geological, paleontological, and archaeological 
communities in the 19th and early 20th centuries in separating the Stone Age from the Bronze Age.

group) and not the period. This would correspond to the historical development of science (Arduino). The tertiary 
era could be subdivided into three periods: Paleogene – period of the old genera of mammals, Neogene – period of the 
new genera of mammals, and Anthropogene – period of the human genre.” The emphasis in the French quote replaces 
letter spacing as occurring in the original text.

Nevertheless, an absence of established absolute dating techniques could not allow scientists to probe into 
the deep past – an issue that geologists were especially aware of. At the time Pavlov proposed a new 
distinction of the Tertiary, British geologist Arthur Holmes had just published his pioneering book The Age 
of the Earth in 1913, where he championed modern techniques of geochronology based on radioactive decay 
of elements. Pavlov was still part of the ‘pre-radiometric dating’ geological world, whose stratigraphy relied 
on relative dating techniques, and archaeological evidence (for the Quaternary). In fact, in addition to cycles 
of glacial and interglacial periods, much of what informs his Anthropogene is based on the prehistory of 
humanity: “[l]e progrès de l’étude des événements se rapportant aux derniers temps de l’histoire géologique 
et au commencement de la préhistoire de l’humanité présente un chapitre très interessant [sic] de l’histoire 
de la science”56 (ibid., p. 23). 
 
A further reason why ‘Anthropocene’ and ‘Anthropogene’ are sometimes interchanged, as just 
shown in Angus (2016) and Foster, is because the Russian term ‘aнтропоген’ had been translated (Shanster, 
1973) as both ‘Anthropocene’ and ‘Anthropogene’ ("Paleontologicheskiy Zhurnal 1966, no. 1," 1966; 
Shanster, 1973; Vinogradov et al., 1968). This translation needs further clarification. The current Russian 
translation of ‘Anthropocene’ is in fact ‘антропоцен,’ whilst now ‘aнтропоген’ translates only as 
‘Anthropogene,’ the proposed period substituting the Quaternary that was adopted following Pavlov’s 
recommendations. This extremely thin line of distinction (a matter of one single letter) is important to 
stress. Contemporary geochronological classification uses the suffix -gene for Periods/Systems, whereas the 
suffix -cene is used for epochs/series. This naming protocol was not yet established in Soviet 
geochronological research. For instance, when E. V. Shanster authored the entry ‘Anthropogenic System’ 
for the second volume of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, he equaled “Anthropogenic System” with 
“Anthropocene” because he adopted the same suffix for two Periods/Systems of the Cenozoic, namely the 
Paleocene (today Paleogene) and the Neocene (today Neogene). The translation was primarily a matter of 
terminological consistency. In our contemporary vocabulary, Shanster’s Anthropocene should be translated 
as ‘Anthropogene.’ But as previously explained, this period was substantially different from the 
Anthropocene as currently being advanced by the AWG. Henceforth, instances of ‘Anthropocene’ in the 
Soviet literature should be considered as homonyms of the present Anthropocene: they mean different 
things through the same word. 
The Anthropozoic, Anthropogene, or other terminological variants should not be so easily 
interchanged with the Anthropocene proposed unit. This is not a mere issue of nominalism. On the 
contrary, unruly equivalence between these two terms is exactly at the core of much misunderstanding 
within the genealogical approach, including the ‘deflationary’ move purposely or unwittingly put forward 
by it. It is also a general anachronistic mistake to overlap terms and concepts based on their semiotic and 
conceptual similarities. Research literature should consider these terms as separate instances of ‘geological 
reflexivity,’ as shall be explained later in this section.  
 
56 In English: “The progress concerning the study of the events relating to the last times of geological history and the 
beginning of the prehistory of humanity presents a very interesting chapter in the history of science.” 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

Hamilton’s ‘radical’ discontinuism, characterized by a rejection of the genealogical research tout 
court, has yet to be fully discussed in context of the history of ideas. That is because criticism on the meaning 
of ‘genealogy,’ as noted in 1.2.4.1, has not been extensively tackled yet either.57 An interesting summary of 
the debate has been outlined by Horn, who sees these two opposing views as complementary rather than 
conflicting (Horn & Bergthaller, 2020). By her account, discontinuism (which she labels as ‘presentists’) 
focuses more on the present impact of humans through the lens of Earth System science, whereas 
continuism (the ‘historicizing’ understanding of the ‘Anthropocene’) looks at the historical roots of the 
‘Anthropocene’ through culture to technology studies. Her preference toward continuism is made clear by 
addressing Hamilton’s view as a “narrow conceptualization,” an “extremely lean, epistemically 
homogeneous narrative” that excludes “any discourses that do not feed into the current [Earth System 
science] paradigm” (ibid., p. 37).  
 
Whilst it is reasonable to consider the genealogical analysis useful in providing an interesting and 
evocative pre-history (or paleo-history) of the ‘Anthropocene,’ the ‘Anthropocene’ situates in a substantially 
different conceptual and linguistic – as well as historical – framework informing the term with a specific 
and unprecedented meaning. To advance a critique: the broader scope of Anthropocene Studies, harboring 
and welcoming interpretations and discourses from the natural sciences to the arts, should not be confused 
with the specific historical and epistemological task of reconstructing the birth of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a 
theoretical entity – an interpretative and descriptive task requiring much rigor and analyticity. This task is 
necessarily exclusive or ‘sectorial,’ especially considering the lack of a shared methodological framework in 
Anthropocene Studies. The risk of including “any discourse” is that of incurring the same issues already at 
the core of research on the ‘Anthropocene’ underscored in section 1.1. 
 
At the core of Hamilton’s account of the ‘Anthropocene’ as stand-alone concept is the novelty of 
the Earth System framework. In addition to this conceptual and historical base, a watershed separating the 
‘Anthropocene’ from many presumed antecedents is the development of radiometric dating techniques in 
the early 20th century that set the foundation for modern absolute dating. These methods relied on 
radioactive decay, discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1896. Only a few years later, Ernest Rutherford and 
Frederick Soddy discovered in 1902 that radioactive elements decayed at specific rates, in fact delineating 
the concept of ‘half-life’ of chemical elements.58 Already in 1904, Rutherford suggested the application of 
radiometric dating to measure geological time (Elias, 2015). In 1907, Bertram B. Boltwood, a pioneering 
figure in radiochemistry, suggested: 
 
If the quantity of the final product occurring with a known amount of its radio-active parent and 
the rate of disintegration of the parent substance are known, it becomes possible to calculate the 
 
57 This is clear evidence of the increasing number of question marks raised in the ‘Anthropocene’ debate arena, all 
requiring dedicated analysis through educational and research programs developing under the disciplinary category of 
Anthropocene Studies (section 1.1). 
58 In nuclear physics, the concept of half-life expresses the statistical amount of time required for the nuclei of an 
unstable atom to undergo radioactive decay. The concept is particularly relevant in radiometric dating, and for 
assessing the chemostratigraphic signature of the proposed Anthropocene unit, discussed later in section 3.1.2.5. 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
49 
 
length of time which would be required for the production of the former. Thus, knowing the rate 
of disintegration of uranium, it would be possible to calculate the time required for the production 
of the proportions of lead found in the different uranium minerals, or in other words the ages of 
the minerals. (Boltwood, 1907) 
 
The rapid developments in physics and chemistry during the first half of the 20th century, from the 
development of mass spectrometers to the discovery of nuclear fission in 1938, saw the normalization of 
radiometric dating as the scientific method to probe into the geological deep past, finally providing an insight 
into the much-yearned-for absolute age of elements and setting the path for modern geochronology. This 
immensely important technique revolutionized the scientific world, particularly the geosciences, 
paleontology, and evolutionary biology. The development of radiocarbon dating (based on carbon-14) had 
also a remarkable impact on the human sciences as well, as in the case of archaeology. Humanity stepped 
out from a dark, inscrutable, and primarily Biblical understanding of time to a more and more precise 
characterization of geological time in absolute terms. 
 
Earth System science, modern geochronology, and stratigraphy inform the language, practices, 
evidence, and methods that shape the ‘Anthropocene’ in the scientific discourse. Borrowing Foucault’s 
(1970) popular terminology, they represent the episteme or conditions of possibility of the ‘Anthropocene.’59 
Proposed conceptual equivalents of the ‘Anthropocene,’ such as Stoppani’s ‘Anthropozoic,’ and authors 
whose thought supposedly anticipated the dawn of a human-driven epoch, are expressions of a different 
episteme. Rather, they hint of a general form of ‘geological reflexivity.’60 The example that could be provided, 
of interest in the history and philosophy of science, is that of Leucippus and his pupil Democritus. Their 
atomic theory of the universe, formulated around the 5th and 4th century BCE, has an outstanding resonance 
with our contemporary view on atoms as elementary constituents of reality. For this reason, it is not 
uncommon to consider them precursors of the modern conception of the atom, and mention them as such 
in high school of university textbooks. However, this is more a captivating move for readers than a claim 
of genealogical spirit. It would be unwise to argue that Leucippus and Democritus provided the episteme 
informing 19th-century particle physics, which is based on methods, techniques, a language, and also a social 
organization and production of knowledge radically different from that of ancient Greece. A genealogy of 
the kind is of valuable historical interest, but it expresses ‘atomic reflexivity’ only insofar as it is treated as a 
separate instance of atomic theory fundamentally different from our contemporary notion of ‘atom.’ 
 
Therefore, discontinuism looks at correlations and similarities with a suspicious eye, grounding its 
understanding of the ‘Anthropocene’ into revolutionary scientific developments – that of Earth System 
science and modern geochronology – rather than genealogical ancestries. Consequently, the historical depth 
 
59 On ‘silent’ revolutions that occurred during the 20th century with remarkable implications for the Earth sciences, 
see Allègre et al. (1999). 
60 While Bonneuil and Fressoz (2016) see the ‘Anthropocene’ as an instance of ecological reflexivity that has largely been 
anticipated during the 18th and 19th centuries, the ‘Anthropocene’ does not in itself entail ecological reflexivity, but 
rather geological reflexivity, a substantially different claim than recognition of human impact on the environment for its 
focus on humans as geological (rather than ecological) agents. A definition of ‘geological reflexivity’ is provided in 
1.2.4.3. 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

of the term is truncated. Hamilton locates the starting point of the conceptual history of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
in the 1980s and 1990s, coinciding with the establishment of international research entities dedicated to the 
study of the Earth as a system. However, if we consider modern geochronology as another pillar of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis, its pre-history could be traced to commence with the use of the term 
‘Anthropogene’ in Soviet geological literature during the second half of the 20th century. This literature 
seems to have implemented the ‘Anthropogene,’ occasionally translated as ‘Anthropocene’ (Shanster, 1973), 
to identify the Quaternary period – as Pavlov originally suggested. A dedicated analysis on the Russian 
definition of ‘Anthropogene’ in the context of Soviet geological research has not yet been conducted. 
Nevertheless, given the present status of the geological time scale, it is possible that geological evidence 
supporting the Anthropogene in Russian research literature may differ substantially from present evidence 
informing the Anthropocene unit (see also Gerasimov, 1978 for usage of the term 'Anthropogene' in Soviet 
geology). It is also important to consider the social and historical context in which this science was being 
produced, namely, a Marxist ideology blended with science as one overarching state-narrative.61  
Jai Syvitski (2012) identifies in 1990s Chinese geoscientific literature a research area anticipating 
the ‘Anthropocene’ in terms of formalizing scientifically the global impact of human activity. Such literature, 
gravitating around the Institute of Geology and Geophysics in Beijing – at that time under the direction of 
Chen Zhirong – made extensive use of the term ‘Anthroposphere.’ The literature systematically used the 
term ‘Anthroposphere’ in the context of Earth System science, considering it as an additional ‘sphere’ in 
the Earth’s function (Zhirong, 1993, 1997, 2006). 
 
Perhaps the closest terms preceding the modern ‘Anthropocene’ semantics are Hubert Markl’s 
‘Anthropozoikum’ (Ehlers & Krafft, 2006b; Markl, 1986), Andrew Revkin’s ‘Anthrocene’ (Revkin, 1992, 
2016) and Michael Samways’s ‘Homogenocene’ (Samways, 1999). Coming from trained biologists, both 
terms ‘Anthropozoikum’ and ‘Homogenocene’ stressed the role of humankind as biological agents, 
scattering species across the globe and deeply affecting biodiversity. On the other hand, Revkin’s 
‘Anthrocene’ appears to come the closest to our modern understanding of ‘Anthropocene’ in terms of 
foreseeing possible research studying the impact of humankind in geological terms. He informally coined 
the Anthrocene as a new, post-Holocene age that future Earth scientists and geologists will recognize as 
defined by human actions (Revkin, 1992). Around seventeen years later, those Earth scientists and 
geologists concretized in the AWG.  
 
 
61 This point was discussed through private correspondence with the historian and philosopher of science Jacques 
Grinevald, also a member of the AWG. He agrees that the use of ‘Anthropogene’/’Anthropocene’ in early and middle 
Russian scientific literature is substantially different from the AWG’s formulation, first and foremost because of its 
equivalence with the Quaternary, but also for its embeddedness in a deeply ideological science. The ‘myth’ of the 
Russian ancestorship was, according to him, launched by Marxist historian John Bellamy Foster in his preface to Ian 
Angus’s book Facing the Anthropocene (Angus, 2016). However, mention of Pavlov already appeared a year prior to 
Angus’s monograph in Lewis and Maslin’s (2015a) highly debated “Defining the Anthropocene” article, published on 
Nature.

1.2.4.3 Solving the Dilemma 
 
Continuism and discontinuism both have their strong and weak points. On the one hand, continuism 
enriches the historical and semantic background of the ‘Anthropocene,’ safeguarding the strength of its 
meaning and message against criticism of post-modernism or academic craftiness. However, in charting a 
history that extends hundreds of years, it risks losing the focus on the present defining qualities of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ deflating or minimizing – either purposefully or unwittingly – its theoretical relevance. On 
the other hand, discontinuism grounds the present meaning of the term on recent but fundamental changes 
in science (i.e., Earth System science and modern geochronology) that inform a substantially different 
theoretical and research framework – one informing the present notion of ‘Anthropocene.’ However, by 
eliminating any connection with past concepts, discontinuism risks disregarding consolidated practices in 
the history of science and the history of ideas, thus depriving Anthropocene Studies of a large portion of 
historical research that has been, and can further be, conducted. Approaching the history of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ and therefore understanding the Anthropocene, seems to pose a methodological dilemma: 
whether to consider it a revenant, or a theoretical singularity. 
One way to tackle this dilemma is by looking at the ‘Anthropocene’ as well as any proposed 
conceptual precursors as historically and epistemologically discrete instances of geological reflexivity. Let 
‘geological reflexivity’ be defined as a meta-historical epistemic category collecting and connecting each 
occurrence, either discursive or terminological, of descriptive and/or normative recognition of human 
impact on the Earth on a planetary scale. By subscribing to this meta-category of ideas and narratives 
highlighting the role of humans as geological agents (dating at least as far back as the late 18th century), the 
‘Anthropocene’ idea still constitutes a theoretical entity with its own discrete history and epistemological 
status. Such status is granted by the unique context and theoretical framework it draws its scientific meaning 
from, namely, modern geochronology techniques and Earth System science. Considered this way, not all 
the ‘Anthropocene’ properties can be deduced (nor deflated) by merely looking at its connection to a 
broader trend of geological reflexivity, nor can the term be utterly separate from any recognition of human 
as geological agents. It is an idea produced within a specific episteme. In this sense, it is independent from 
any genealogical precursors. Studying its relationship with other instances of geological reflexivity (e.g., the 
Anthropozoic) is a different endeavor than researching its peculiar epistemological status, which requires 
an understanding of its epistemological context. An in-depth analysis of the contextual characteristics of 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific hypothesis is provided throughout section 4.2. 
Solving the dilemma this way seems to suggest that the genealogical approach is mistaken in 
interpreting the ‘Anthropocene’ as the direct product of the meta-historical category of ‘geological 
reflexivity.’ Once again, ‘geological reflexivity’ should be understood more as a historiographical category 
allowing existing research to locate instances of recognition of humans as geologically relevant entities with 
their own stratigraphic signature. One research trajectory within Anthropocene Studies has been identifying 
possible correlations and causations among these instances. Nevertheless, by implicitly or explicitly 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
52 
 
considering the ‘Anthropocene’ as the latest instance of geological reflexivity, the genealogical approach 
traces a fruitful and historically rich research landscape that should not be disregarded too quickly. 
A second way to solve this dilemma is by differentiating between a paleo-history, pre-history, and modern 
history of the ‘Anthropocene’ (Figure 1.1). Anthropocene scholars (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b) have already 
been labelling the corpus of literature preceding Crutzen’s popularization of the term as ‘prehistory’ of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ followed by its ‘modern history.’ This way, rather than being utterly rescinded from the 
‘Anthropocene,’ the genealogical research promoted by continuists would then focus on the paleo-history – 
stretching from late 18th century (or prior) to the early 20th century – and pre-history of the term – from the 
application of radiometric dating in the early 20th century to the 1990s. Consistent with the revolutionary 
changes it brought about, radiometric dating constitutes the primary watershed between paleo-historical 
and pre-historical ‘precursors’ of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Such division would avoid any unwitting or voluntary 
dissolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ into past concepts.  
 
 
 
Figure 1.1. Threefold division of the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. (Illustration by the 
author) 
 
 
This approach would not solely highlight and discuss possible theoretical continuities, but also 
discontinuities between each instance – including the ‘Anthropocene.’ Reframing the genealogical debate 
in terms of geological reflexivity would preserve the uniqueness of the Anthropocene Hypothesis while 
acknowledging an extended tradition recognizing humans as geologically relevant agents on the Earth. 
 
Once the paleo- and pre-history of the ‘Anthropocene’ are located, the ‘modern’ history could 
unequivocally be traced back to Crutzen’s famous intervention at the International Geosphere-Biosphere 
Programme Science Committee meeting (or IGBP-SC) in February 2000. Indeed, this moment represent 
the genesis of the modern conception of ‘Anthropocene,’ and the starting point of the historical analysis 
conducted in the next chapter. 
 
Crutzen’s seminal intervention, and the ‘Anthropocene’ publications that ensued, prompted a 
discussion that slowly transformed the term from informal conjecture to a stratigraphic hypothesis. In 2009, 

HISTORIES OF THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
53 
 
the AWG was formed, and Chakrabarty published his seminal contribution “The Climate of History: Four 
Theses.” These two defining moments – the establishment of the AWG, and Chakrabarty’s Four Theses – 
could justify a further historical separation in the modern history of the ‘Anthropocene’ based on a pre- 
and post-AWG ‘Anthropocene.’ The years following the establishment of the AWG, and the inclusion of 
humanities in the ‘Anthropocene’ debate, saw a quantitatively documented surge in interest, culminating in 
documentaries, art exhibitions, and even songs and musical albums making use of the term. Christian 
Schwägerl (2014) reports that in 2003, Google would provide 413 results for the term ‘Anthropocene.’ In 
2011, results increased to 450,000; in 2013, to 1,070,000. By September 2021, results totaled 5,350,000. One 
can also observe such discrepancy between the amount of literature produced between the 2000–2009 
decade and the post-2009 years by also looking at research search engines such as ScienceDirect.com or 
Dimensions.ai – the latter providing for the year 2013 alone more than four times the amount of material 
provided between the 2000–2009 decade.62  
The distinction between a pre- and post-AWG ‘Anthropocene’ is one of the fundamental premises 
of the research hereby conducted. Indeed, the establishment of the AWG delimits represents the upper 
limit of the early research literature on the ‘Anthropocene,’ which it explored in detail in the following chapter, 
as well as the “stratigraphic turn” (Davies, 2018, p. 64) – that is, the formulation of the geological 
‘Anthropocene’ (i.e., the Anthropocene Hypothesis). It is argued that the first decade (2000–2009) of this 
recent history of the term has been largely overshadowed or often compressed in a handful publications 
and events. On the contrary, the following decade up to the present time has blossoming interest not just 
restricted to the work of the AWG. As illustrated in 1.1.1, the last decade witnessed the rise of dedicated 
‘Anthropocene’ journals within and outside the academic niche. This large increase in public and academic 
perception is important to highlight because in its wake, it generated the many trends of debate and lines 
of criticism toward the notion. Controversy was virtually non-existent during the decade hereby under 
scrutiny, and the term, as illustrated in Chapter 2, was largely used by scientists rather than humanists or 
social scientists. 
 
 
1.3 Defining the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
 
 
The previous sections provided a critical overview of the major research trends, critical debates, and 
theoretical issues in Anthropocene Studies. This multidisciplinary network of research has gained 
momentum in the past ten years. The term ‘Anthropocene’ seems especially effective in providing a hub 
for discourses of an environmental nature, from increased rates of extinction and Earth System changes to 
 
62 Estimates drawn from https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication as of September 17, 2021. The total number 
of results for the 2000–2009 timeframe is 1,311, whereas the total number of results for the year 2013 alone is 6,062.  

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
54 
 
planetary thresholds of climate change, environmental justice, geological agency, and more. This is because, 
rather than focusing on isolated issues of an anthropogenic nature, the ‘Anthropocene’ represents “not a 
problem, but a predicament” (Thomas et al., 2020, p. 3). It is a state of affairs that, according to historian Julia 
Thomas (2019), no technical fixes can provide solutions for, but that we can only acknowledge and navigate. 
If so, the extent of this predicament lies beyond disciplinary domains – if not beyond traditional knowledge 
organizations of academic settings (Heikkurinen et al., 2016). 
Yet, because of the novelty and sudden relative popularity the term benefitted from, more research 
on the philosophical and epistemological substrate of this notion needs to be conducted to assess its utility, 
validity, and legitimacy. Attempting to frame the multidimensional nature of the term into a single unifying 
definition seems to do no justice to the possible multiple meanings that it encompasses. This is even more 
pronounced with regard to how the ‘Anthropocene’ as a planetary phenomenon manifests itself in different 
modalities across human societies not just in geographical terms, but also in terms of race (Yusoff, 2019) 
and gender (Paulla & Anna, 2017) – as suggested by branches of humanistic scholarly research. This seems 
to add additional weight to the already existing burden of defining the ‘Anthropocene’ for multi- and 
transdisciplinary purposes. 
Therefore, instead of conducting conceptual engineering over such a multidimensional and 
multidisciplinary term in order to extract a strictly defined, but unavoidably limited, definition of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ a different object of research is considered. The object in question is the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, namely, the scientific – and specifically stratigraphic – expression that emerged amidst the 
‘Anthropocene’ debates. The Anthropocene Hypothesis is equivalent to what ‘Anthropocene’ scholars have 
occasionally addresses as ‘geological Anthropocene’ or ‘stratigraphic Anthropocene.’ Indeed, the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis represents the stratigraphic variant of the broader ‘Anthropocene’ concept. This 
scientific hypothesis of recent formulation has not yet been thoroughly scrutinized in philosophical terms 
– especially as an object of interest for the philosophy of science. Multiple reasons explain this research 
vacuum, some of which are outlined in section 1.3.3. 
In order to consolidate a preliminary conceptual separation between the ‘Anthropocene’ and its 
stratigraphic variant, first a distinction between a descriptive and normative ‘Anthropocene’ is advanced. 
This distinction should help in delineating the theoretical boundaries of the Anthropocene Hypothesis in 
terms of aim, methods, and scope. Secondly, the Anthropocene Hypothesis is properly defined by locating 
three fundamental claims that characterize its scientific core, and distinguish it from the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept. Lastly, section 1.3.3. discusses the methodologies adopted to study this scientific hypothesis. 
Because, as stated in the introductory remarks to this study, this work is set as an interdisciplinary effort, 
multiple methodologies of diverse disciplinary provenance are provided. Nevertheless, the main disciplinary 
matrix is considered to be the history and philosophy of science – itself a multidisciplinary effort.

1.3.1. The Descriptive and Normative ‘Anthropocene’ 
 
To say anything about the world requires the use of verbal language, which allows us to express statements 
in different ways. Language statements can be analyzed by using many epistemic categories. One way to 
look at how statements are expressed is by categorizing them as descriptive or normative. Because of the way 
they are formulated, some statements seem to be either true or false (or approximately true or approximately 
false) – that is, they can be verified or falsified sensu lato by looking at their evidence, logical consistency, or 
other proofing methods. The sentences ‘There are more than one billion human beings currently inhabiting 
planet Earth,’ ‘The Earth is 4.54 billion years old’ and ‘Dogs are reptiles’ are examples of such sentences. 
They can be verified or falsified by looking at the real world and determining the truth of their claims. These 
statements tell how the world is (or how it approximately is) by merely describing it. Because of this, they 
could be classified as descriptive statements. 
 Other statements do not entail any degree of truth (or falsity) because they express value 
judgements about the world – that is, they express one’s personal interpretation of a certain state of affairs. 
They do not describe how the world is, but rather how it ought (or ought not) to be. The claims ‘The Earth 
is beautiful’ and ‘Humans should foster cooperation to create better societies’ are examples of normative 
statements. Most, if not all, ethical claims could be considered normative statements: to claim that ‘life has 
an intrinsic value’ cannot be verified from a descriptive standpoint. It is based on the ethical and moral 
categories through which we attribute value to what we identify as life. Normative statements can be further 
classified not based on their syntax, but rather on their semantics (i.e., their content). Some statements deal 
with behavioral norms or the ethos one ought to observe in a given society (e.g., ‘You should not steal’). 
This type represents normative-ethical statements. Other statements deal with expected predictions based on 
past background knowledge that is taken as a norm (e.g., ‘It should be cold in February in Iceland’). This 
type represents normative-functional statements. A third class of statements deals with aesthetic judgements of 
a qualitative nature (e.g., ‘The book The Lord of the Rings is better than the movie’). This type represents 
normative-aesthetic statements.63 A fourth possible class of statements are prescriptive-procedural: they concern 
the established norms of executing any activity for whose performance those norms are (usually) 
implemented (e.g., ‘Stratigraphy should follow the guidelines of the International Stratigraphy Guide’). This 
type represents normative-methodological statements.64 
The distinction between descriptive and normative claims should not be taken too rigidly, as their 
boundaries are blurred and often intersect with one another (see Mylius, 2018, pp. 153-155). Mostly, the 
descriptive or normative nature of a statement is determined by its context. Claiming that ‘the Earth 
gravitates around the Sun’ in early 17th-century Europe may have been descriptive from our present 
 
63 The classification promoted here draws on the type of normative statements outlined in the online lecture “How to 
Build a Compelling Moral Argument,” available at https://criticalthinkeracademy.com/courses/moral-
arguments/lectures/655352 (accessed on March 2, 2021).

standpoint, despite the fact that it had tremendous political (viz. normative) implications during those times 
– as the Galileo affair bears witness. There is no logical nor linguistic property that can single-handedly 
classify language statements into sharply defined classes of sentences. Nevertheless, it seems feasible to 
distinguish some statements that, by virtue of how they are formulated and their context of formulation 
(e.g., the aim, the person stating the sentence, the historical time of utterance, etc.), entail either descriptive 
or normative claims about the world. 
The research areas established by Anthropocene Studies include both descriptive and normative 
considerations about the ‘Anthropocene,’ so that the term entails both descriptive and normative meanings. 
Common descriptive proxies used to describe the ‘Anthropocene’ in extant literature are the increase in 
Earth System and socio-economic trends during the Great Acceleration (Steffen et al., 2015; Steffen et al., 
2011b); the ongoing rates of extinction attributed to humans’ niche-constructing activities (Boivin et al., 
2016; Ellis, 2016b; Ersten et al., 2016) or hyper-dominance (Pena Rodrigues & Lira, 2019, p. 141); and the 
manifold types of stratigraphic evidence of anthropogenic sediments of present and future geological 
relevance (Waters et al., 2014a; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b). This literature, surveyed throughout section 1.2, 
provides a descriptive snapshot of the ontology of the ‘Anthropocene’ generally (though not exclusively) 
based on the language of the natural sciences. ‘Homo sapiens is the plausible cause of the sixth mass extinction 
event’ is either true or false regardless of one’s normative consideration or personal feelings on the matter, 
and regardless of its political implications. In its descriptive sense, the ‘Anthropocene’ is not a label to mark 
a period of human history, but a term designating a set of identifiable characteristics. As the AWG 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 1.1) argues, it is a phenomenon that happens to be driven by humans, and 
is inscribed in the Earth’s geological history – even if humans were to disappear suddenly. Philosophically, 
this is a strong claim because it asserts that the Anthropocene (as a geological time unit) exists independently 
from us (which is not to say that we are not the cause). This is a realist stance toward the Anthropocene. It 
claims that what makes the Anthropocene such has as much of an ontological raison d’être as the Cretaceous-
Paleogene meteor-driven extinction event, the Great Oxygenation event, or other episodes of the Earth’s 
geological history – with the fundamental (and perhaps most important) difference that humans are both 
the observer and the cause of this event. 
The social, political, artistic, or generally humanistic response to the ‘Anthropocene,’ either as a 
broader idea or as a proposed time unit or Earth System phase, informs the notion with normative value.65 
 
65 A Google search associates the designation ‘normative Anthropocene’ with environmental humanist and political 
ecologist Anne Fremaux. The search results redirect to an abstract of the second chapter of her 2019 book After the 
Anthropocene, entitled “A Critical Examination of the Naturalistic Narrative of the Anthropocene” (available at 
https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/a-critical-examination-of-the-naturalistic-narrative-of-the-anth/16574900, 
accessed on January 6, 2021). When asked about her theorizing of the normative–descriptive dualism of the 
‘Anthropocene’ concept, Fremaux (personal communication, January 5, 2020) provided the following answer: “The 
normative Anthropocene refers to the ecomodernist narrative that uses the pseudo ‘age of humans’ to justify a further 
artificialization and capitalization of the planet (this is what I develop in Chap 4) while the descriptive anthropocene 
is the scientific narrative that tries to be as objective as possible as far as human transformation of planet earth is 
concerned (describing therefore the destruction that humankind has caused and the critical situation in which we are 
– scientific facts).” The distinction promoted in this section aligns with Fremaux’s connotation of the normative and 
descriptive ‘Anthropocene’ – although additional types of normative statements are also recognized. 

DEFINING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
57 
 
As a broader term framing the human–Earth relationship, the concept has been invested with normative 
significance ever since Crutzen’s coinage of the term. Along with its descriptive content, the ‘Anthropocene’ 
has been implemented as a tool to broaden environmental discourse beyond the limits of climate change, 
biodiversity loss, or sustainability, by connecting the threads of these environmental narratives into one 
unifying framework. This literature – stemming especially from the environmental humanities, ecocriticism, 
or environmental and sustainability studies – tells what should be done in response to the ethical, political, 
social, and cultural challenges posed by the dawn of the ‘Anthropocene.’ It also stresses the plurality of 
diversified realities experienced by humans in facing this epoch. The epoch is not merely an analytical object 
of observation whose ontology is restricted by its scientific depiction: it also poses challenges to the very 
political, social, and economic means of subsistence of human societies. It asks for radical transformations, 
connecting a nexus of environmental narratives and at the same time extending beyond the limited yet 
dominant narrative of climate change (Crist, 2007; Thomas, 2019; Thomas et al., 2020).  
A symbolic example of normative framing of the ‘Anthropocene’ discourse is the ‘good 
Anthropocene’ idea promoted by environmental scientist Erle C. Ellis (2011b) and later championed by 
environmental journalist Andrew Revkin (2014b, 2014c). For Ellis (2011), human resilience expressed in 
technological advancements will ensure “a good, or at least a better, Anthropocene is within our grasp” (p. 
42). The idea – heavily criticized by philosopher Clive Hamilton (2014a; 2014b; see also Dalby, 2016) – is 
emblematic of normative attitudes toward the ‘Anthropocene’ as a state of affairs, but also as a conceptual 
framework for the present human–environment relationship. 
It should once again be noted that the difference between normative and descriptive statements is 
difficult to delineate purely on a linguistic and conceptual level. This is especially the case if the 
‘Anthropocene’ concept is understood as a dual character concept – that is, a class of concepts where both a 
normative and descriptive dimension are encoded that “are related but independent” (Reuter, 2019, p. 1) 
to one another.66 Nevertheless, it seems useful to pose such a distinction to delineate the different research 
trajectories undertaken by disciplines engaged with the study of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a broader conceptual 
category, or as a phenomenon (or set of phenomena) with distinctive and observable features. This 
distinction underpins much of the theoretical outline hereby proposed to study the geological or 
stratigraphic variant of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. It is shown throughout the following chapters that the 
core statements of this recent scientific hypothesis are fundamentally descriptive, meaning that the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis represents (in general terms) a descriptive statement about reality. However, it 
is also argued that the hypothesis also entails (1) normative-functional and (2) normative-methodological types of 
statements because (1) it contrasts with expected predictions within a Holocene framework (in stratigraphy, 
but also in Earth System science and biology), and (2) it challenges (directly and indirectly) in different ways 
 
66 Dual character concepts that have been recently investigated by philosophers, linguists, and cognitive scientists. For 
relevant literature, see Del Pinal and Reuter (2017), Knobe et al. (2013), and Leslie (2015). 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

traditional stratigraphic research.67 Two examples may be useful in clarifying the ways in which the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis (tackled in the next section) entails normative statements.  
Firstly, the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b) has provided mineralogical evidence associated with 
the lithostratigraphic characteristic of the Anthropocene time unit (section 3.1.2.1). The group has been 
stressing the important of human-mediated mineral-like compounds as a seemingly global and synchronous 
marker of the Anthropocene. However, the International Mineralogical Association (IMA) Commission on 
New Minerals and Mineral Names (CNMMN) does not regard human-mediated mineral-like compounds 
as minerals – despite having virtually the same chemical and structural components of naturally produced 
minerals. As of 2017, only 208 types of human-mediated minerals have seen formal approval by the IMA. 
The CNMMN decreed that no future human-mediated chemical compounds will be considered as minerals, 
because minerals are only those that have “been formed as a result of geological processes” (Nickel, 1995, 
p. 689). To argue that human-mediated mineral-like compounds represent substantial mineralogical (and 
lithostratigraphic) evidence implies challenging the norms established by the IMA of what makes a mineral 
such. 
Secondly, chemostratigraphy provides perhaps the most suitable primary marker for an 
Anthropocene to be placed around 1950 – that is, radionuclides fallout (section 3.1.2.5). However, 
chemostratigraphy is not formally recognized as an independent unit of stratigraphic classification, neither 
by the International Subcommission of Stratigraphic Classification (part of the ICS) nor by the North 
American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature (NACSN). When asked why this is the case, the 
chemostratigrapher and geologist Muthuvairavasamy Ramkumar (personal communication, September 30, 
2020) argued that “reasons for not having chemostratigraphy recognized yet may be 1. It is mostly used by 
a select group within petroleum exploration industry and fewer in academia, unlike sequence stratigraphy 
[and] 2. In order to push through the method to be recognized by NASC or international stratigraphic 
commission, a pressure group has to be formed and it is yet to take shape.” Whether or not the AWG has 
been directly investing in the role of a ‘pressure group’ for recognizing chemostratigraphic units in either 
the ISG or the NACSN, promoting chemostratigraphic evidence as primary marker for the Anthropocene 
represents a major challenge to the norms for defining a geological time unit. 
This theoretical clarification of the descriptive and normative scope of the hypothesis is important 
for framing the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a discrete theoretical entity, as well as for framing the limits 
of the present research. 
 
 
67 It should be noted that the AWG is not directly advocating for a restructuring of the epistemological foundations of 
stratigraphic classification to accommodate an Anthropocene Epoch. On the contrary, it is their aim to adhere to the 
standards and protocols of geochronological classification, and to promote a formal ratification within this framework. 
The epistemic challenges raised are rather a product of applying geochronological and stratigraphic methods and 
criteria to extremely recent geological times. These represents circumstances in stratigraphic research, as later observed 
in Chapter 4.

1.3.2. The ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
 
What, then, is the Anthropocene Hypothesis?  
 
Sections 1.1 and 1.2 provided an outline of the epistemological and ontological characterization of 
the ‘Anthropocene’ as boundary object – that is, an object “plastic enough to adapt to local needs and the 
constraints of the several parties employing [it], yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across 
sites,” and with “different meanings in different social worlds” (Star & Griesemer, 1989, p. 393). It is not 
uncommon that scientific terms and ideas are embraced and readapted by the humanities, social sciences, 
and arts before their full acceptance by the scientific community. Darwin’s theory of evolution through 
natural selection was shaped in a Marxist framework sooner than it was institutionalized into science, which 
only happened in the 20th century (Renn, 2020). Einstein’s general relativity had initially more repercussions 
in the humanities and arts than in physics (Hacking, 2012). Terms and ideas are exchanged, borrowed, 
redefined, reshaped, and reformulated from their original meanings, occasionally to a point unrecognizable 
from their original use. The Kuhnian term ‘paradigm’ is perhaps most emblematic of this scholarly 
occurrence – a term Kuhn had to clarify virtually for the rest of his academic life.  
The term ‘Anthropocene’ mostly developed and spread among scientific communities during its 
early phase (2000–2009). The term was mostly used informally, and had not yet received much attention 
from the humanities and social sciences. It was only after the formation of the AWG, and Chakrabarty’s 
(2009) publication of “The Climate of History,” that humanists and social scientists began to critically 
engage with the term. From 2009 onward, the ‘Anthropocene’ concept followed several different 
trajectories and purposes across the academic landscape as well as popular culture. One of these paths was 
the possibility of recognizing the Anthropocene as a distinct geological unit on the geological time scale. 
As detailed in Chapter 2, this research trajectory spurred from a few geologists interested in assessing the 
stratigraphic signature of Homo sapiens. This research trajectory developed throughout the years, 
accumulating research material and forging its own narrative and history – that is, the ‘geological’ or 
‘stratigraphic Anthropocene.’ As stated by Waters et al. (2016), this research trajectory has developed by 
following two leading questions: “Have humans changed the Earth system to such an extent that recent 
and currently forming geological deposits include a signature that is distinct from those of the Holocene 
and earlier epochs, which will remain in the geological record? If so, when did this stratigraphic signal (not 
necessarily the first detectable anthropogenic change) become recognizable worldwide?” (p. 1). Answering 
these questions is the central scope of the AWG, and of the ‘stratigraphic Anthropocene.’ 
 
Thus, to delimit the geological discourse on the stratigraphic nature of the Anthropocene, and to 
avoid the issue of defining a geology-exclusive ‘Anthropocene,’ a theoretical distinction between the 
‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis is advanced. The former constitutes the broader 
category or boundary object applied amongst different knowledge domains and investing different 
contextualized meanings. The latter specifically refers to the “stratigraphic Anthropocene” (Zalasiewicz et 
al., 2019b, p. 4), or the ‘Anthropocene’ as developed within geological – and more precisely stratigraphic – 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
60 
 
research. The Anthropocene Hypothesis is the scientific belief by the multidisciplinary group of scientists 
(mostly geologists) working with and within the AWG that the Anthropocene may represent a discrete unit 
on the geological time scale. Hence, the object of the effort hereby conducted is not the ‘Anthropocene,’ 
but the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a stratigraphic hypothesis. The theoretical core of this hypothesis could 
be summarized in the following three claims: 
 
Claim 1. Homo sapiens has left a discernible stratigraphic signature of significant magnitude 
in recent geological history. 
Claim 2. The stratigraphic signature left by Homo sapiens could be translated into a 
geochronological and chronostratigraphic unit of time.  
Claim 3. The proper unit level reflecting the magnitude of the stratigraphic signature of 
Homo sapiens on the geological time scale and international chronostratigraphic chart is that 
of epoch/series. 
 
Claim 1 is descriptive: it states that there exists such a thing as an observable stratigraphic record of an 
anthropogenic nature. Claims 2 and 3 are normative-methodological: the former acknowledges the 
possibility of formal recognition of an ‘Anthropocene’ geochronological and chronostratigraphic unit (the 
majority of the AWG also holds that formal recognition should be promoted); the latter suggests what 
hierarchical level should reflect the magnitude of this observed stratigraphic signature. The body of 
evidence, lines of reasonings, debates, and epistemology informing each of these claims is discussed over 
the course of the following chapters. In the present section, it is important to consider the several theoretical 
and linguistic benefits of distinguishing between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the ‘Anthropocene Hypothesis.’ 
 
First, this conceptual separation overcomes the issue of definition by simply avoiding the impasse 
of providing an all-inclusive ‘Anthropocene’ concept. Whereas multidisciplinarity is also a constitutive 
feature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, its aim is fundamentally restricted by the stratigraphic hypothesis 
of considering the Anthropocene as a discrete time unit. This implies that the focus given is on the epistemic 
actors, communities, and research material supporting or contesting the Anthropocene as a proposed 
geological time unit, and thus on the conceptual history, evidence, and epistemology of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. 
Second, such delimitation avoids ‘essentialist’ arguments – that is, claims that the ‘Anthropocene’ 
means something defined exclusively by a particular knowledge domain. It seems practical to consider the 
‘Anthropocene’ a fundamentally scientific term by considering its scientific (rather than humanistic) origins 
and spread across research communities (later illustrated in section 2.1.3). However, such a view is blind to 
the evolution of the concept. The widespread assimilation of the concept into humanistic scholarship seems 
a sufficient reason to now consider the term as belonging to the humanities and social sciences rather than 
the natural sciences. However, such a state of affairs does not seem to lay any solid foundation for a 
multifunctional use of the term. By postulating the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a separate theoretical 

DEFINING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
61 
 
entity, the issue of what the ‘Anthropocene’ really means is much easier to tackle because there is no ‘real’ 
‘Anthropocene.’ The Anthropocene Hypothesis simply identifies a particular variant of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
being discussed, and how this variant is best discussed. This is not the case, for instance, with the strategies 
of considering the ‘original’ or ‘true meaning’ of the Anthropocene. 
Third, this separation transforms the Anthropocene Hypothesis into an object of interest for the 
philosophy of science. This philosophical domain in inquiry has been largely silent in discussing the 
scientific substrate of the hypothesis. In the ‘Anthropocene’ research landscape, the concept has been 
tackled mostly by humanists and social scientists from environmental history, literary criticism, ecocriticism, 
STS, or postcolonial studies. Philosophy of science has seen much criticism, if not an overall decline in 
practice due to the now more common historical and sociological approach to science (Zammito, 2004, 
2011). Additionally, geology is a largely underrepresented disciplines in philosophical discourses, which 
have historically developed primarily around physics, and more recently around biology, medicine, AI, or 
cognitive sciences. This absence is considered unjustified from a theoretical viewpoint because the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis, as a scientific hypothesis of a highly contested nature, could and should represent 
an object worth philosophical commitment. Separating between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis is considered a step in this direction by delineating what object of analysis should primarily 
pertain philosophers of sciences in the ‘Anthropocene’ debates. 
Fourth, the separation overcomes the ‘undifferentiated Anthropos argument’68 – that is, the 
argument that the ‘Anthropocene’ is an all-inclusive term blind to human differences and responsibilities 
in engendering this proposed epoch – by reassessing the epistemic purpose of ‘Anthropos’ in the stratigraphic 
discourse. This is a particularly pressing line of criticism directed toward the ‘Anthropocene’ term (discussed 
in section 5.1.1). Beside the descriptive and functional-methodological nature of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, the epistemology of geochronology provides a sufficient reason for deflating the issue. In 
geochronology, most taxonomical units have historically been assigned names based on the location where 
their representing outcrops were first found – Devonian from Devon in England, Jurassic from the Jura 
Mountains, Permian from the Perm region in Russia, and so forth. Most of these ‘labels’ were products of 
18th- and 19th-century British geology. This terminology has persisted without impinging on existing 
research, despite the major theoretical and methodological revolution caused by the application of 
radiometric techniques to derive absolute ages of rocks and strata. The nominalistic nature of geological 
taxonomy is largely pragmatic, and does not constitute a theoretical burden within the geochronological 
and stratigraphic domain. Problems within one knowledge domain (e.g., postcolonial studies, ecocriticism, 
environmental humanities) may not be such in another domain – as appears to be the case with the 
‘Anthropocene’ term.  
The more pressing issue in the history of geochronology had rather been developing an 
internationally shared and consistent geological time scale / chronostratigraphic chart to avoid the use of 
multiple time scales across global scientific communities; to eliminate gaps and overlaps among time units; 
 
68 Literature advancing this argument is explored in section 5.1.1. 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
62 
 
and to establish a coherent and consistent language to facilitate effective communication among 
geoscientists. Institutionally, this was solved by the creation of dedicated entities, such as the International 
Subcommission on Stratigraphic Classification (formerly International Subcommission on Stratigraphic 
Terminology, founded in 1952 under the auspice of Hollis D. Hedberg, see Walsh et al., 2004), and 
textbooks like the International Stratigraphic Guide (and its abridged version). The aim of these entities and 
texts of “worldwide geographic spread” is to “promote international agreement on principles of 
stratigraphic classification and to develop an internationally acceptable stratigraphic terminology and rules 
of stratigraphic procedure—all in the interest of improved accuracy and precision in international 
communication, coordination, and understanding” (Murphy & Salvador, 2000, p. 232). 
The aforementioned arguments aim at separating conceptually the nature of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis from the broader discourse around the ‘Anthropocene.’ They provide a basis for claiming that 
the normative (viz. ethical, social, etc.) validity of the ‘Anthropocene’ (which is yet to be resolved by 
humanistic inquiry) is not an intrinsic aspect of the epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. The 
hypothesis primarily represents a descriptive hypothesis that, by virtue of its statements, also entails implicit 
types of normative-functional and normative-methodological statements. That is to say that, from a purely 
epistemological viewpoint, there is nothing descriptively good or bad about the fact that Homo sapiens is 
leaving a discernible stratigraphic signature in geological records of significant magnitude in recent 
geological history (Claim 1); that this signature could be translated into a unit of time on the geological time 
scale (Claim 2); and that the proper hierarchical level to reflect the magnitude of this stratigraphic signature 
is that of epoch/series (Claim 3).69 They are descriptive statements about a certain state of affairs, and can 
either be true or false. Naturally, there are intrinsic normative implications in stating each of these claims, 
which translate into broader social and ethical calls. Furthermore, to claim that the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis does not entail some types of normative statements does not imply that its approval or rejection 
does not have broader normative importance. While the fate of the hypothesis has yet to be determined, it 
is reasonable to believe the term will persist in the activist and academic environmental vocabulary. 
Once the descriptive nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis is discerned and separated from its 
parental conceptual entity (i.e., the ‘Anthropocene’), what remains is to assess how to approach this 
stratigraphic hypothesis in a way that is meaningful to understand its scientific core. 
 
1.3.3. Approaching the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
 
As a scientific idea, the Anthropocene Hypothesis can be investigated from multiple angles of analysis – 
from History and Philosophy of Science (HPS) and historical epistemology to Science and Technology 
Studies (STS), Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK), epistemology, and philosophy of science. The 
 
69 A different set of meta-normative statements about the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ hypothesis (as 
in being useful or not) are ultimately part of the geological community’s acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis.  

DEFINING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
63 
 
relationship between these disciplines is uneasy, and often conflictual. Yet the present endeavor aims at 
borrowing elements from each of these fields, hence including historical (i.e., the history of the hypothesis; 
Chapter 2), sociological (i.e., the debate the hypothesis ignited; Chapter 5), and traditional epistemological 
features to delineate the birth and epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Nevertheless, the central line of analysis remains primarily philosophical. Scientific ideas are always 
part of a historical and social context that grant them the very conditions of possibility for their formulation, 
and are largely “influenced by values, motives, social interests, and political agendas” (Howard, 2009, p. 
202). Within this context, philosophy of science is particularly keen on delineating the epistemology of 
scientific ideas – that is, the basic epistemic properties, such as empirical adequacy, logical consistency, 
explanatory power, or intelligibility, that make scientific knowledge particularly successful. Philosophy of 
science has always been concerned with the nature of science and scientific knowledge, with many of its 
questions overlapping with the field of epistemology (i.e., the study of the nature, structure, and value of 
knowledge), but also with metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind (Ladyman, 2019). 
The philosophical analysis of science can provide a useful conceptual toolkit to investigate the conceptual 
challenges and epistemic properties of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This is not simply because the 
hypothesis represents a scientific idea with a specific set of epistemic properties that can be analyzed, but 
also because understanding its epistemology is paramount for developing a multidisciplinary framework 
and successful communication among disciplines in Anthropocene Studies. 
 
This methodological driver is also a call for interest among philosophers of science in the 
‘Anthropocene’ debate. Philosophy has been an active discipline within Anthropocene Studies. However, 
its focus has been primarily directed toward the normative-ethical, normative-moral, and normative-
aesthetic aspects of the debate (Merchant, 2021; Polt & Wittrock, 2018; Raffnsøe, 2016; Zylinska, 2014). 
This has left a substantial gap in the more strictly philosophical analysis of the sciences engaged with the 
‘Anthropocene.’ This is particularly true for the ‘analytical’ philosophy of geology – a much 
underrepresented subdiscipline within philosophy of science. Attempts to reconcile a prototypical 
philosophy of geology of a ‘continental’ fashion with Anthropocene Studies have been conducted under 
the theme of convergence between historical and geological time (Chakrabarty, 2009, 2015). Although 
geology overall has long “received little attention from the humanities” (Frodeman, 2014, p. 71), it seems 
that the ‘Anthropocene’ has been a hub for discourses between the natural sciences and the humanities, 
despite reproducing forms of academic antagonism (Riesch, 2014; Snow, 1959; Toivanen et al., 2017). Yet 
a thorough analysis from philosophy of science (viz. philosophy of geology) has been almost utterly 
nonexistent. As of August 2021, five articles result by keyword-searching ‘anthropocene’ (case-insensitive) 
in Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A (part B and C are dedicated, respectively, to modern physics, 
and biology and biomedical sciences). Only one article (Santana, 2019a) has been just recently published on 
the topic of the Anthropocene by The British Journal of Philosophy of Science. One result appears under 
‘anthropocene’ in the journal Philosophy of science (Helgeson et al., 2021, the 'Anthropocene' is only mentioned 

FRAMING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
64 
 
once in the text), while no search results appear under ‘anthropocene’ in Synthese, Journal for General Philosophy 
of Science, or Erkenntnis – all well-established journals in philosophy of science.70  
 
Why have philosophy of science and the ‘analytical’ philosophy of geology not engaged with the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis? Multiple reasons can be determined. One has to do with the most recent history 
and developments within philosophy of science as a discipline itself (Ladyman, 2019). The dawn of new 
approaches challenging the traditionally language- and logic-oriented problems formulated by philosophers 
of science, such as HPS or SSK, seemed to threaten the very foundations of philosophy of science. More 
importantly, philosophy of science mutated into philosophy of sciences – abandoning the idea of a unified 
framework for all sciences and focusing on single disciplines, such as physics, biology, neuroscience, 
cognitive science, medicine, and so forth. Within this disciplinary rearrangement, geology – already a 
discipline largely overseen – did not gain substantial interest among philosophers of science. Consequently, 
the lack of a mature philosophy of geology resulted in the lack of commitment toward the philosophical 
study of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
A second possible reason is that the ‘Anthropocene’ concept simply did not clearly resonate within 
philosophy of science. Standing at the epicenter of Anthropocene Studies, it is easy to have the impression 
that the ‘Anthropocene’ buzzword has been the most popular term in recent scholarship – especially among 
the humanities. However, once one’s viewpoint is shifted outside the boundaries of Anthropocene Studies, 
the ‘Anthropocene’ becomes at best a word that has been ‘heard of.’71 Hence, it is feasible to assume that 
although they are probably aware of the existence of the term, philosophers of science have considered it 
a catalyst for environmental discourse rather than an object of scientific interest.  
Another reason concerns the nature and use of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. In the past decade, 
the term has been largely adopted and framed by environmental humanists and social scientists more than 
natural scientists (the latter mostly gravitating around the work of the AWG). This multidisciplinary 
appropriation transformed the term into an umbrella category framing many existing environmental 
narratives, leaving the impression that the term had few if any epistemic properties to be analyzed from a 
philosophy of science viewpoint. At best, philosophers engaged with normative aspects of the term – as 
later discussed in section 4.1. It is plausible that this multidisciplinary engagement – which saw the 
humanities and social sciences at the forefront in the past decade – had the ‘Anthropocene’ emerging as a 
social, political, and environmental message rather than a scientific hypothesis worth philosophical 
commitment (this is also consistent with criticism of the idea as a political statement; see section 5.2.3.3). 
 
Yet scientific ideas could also be politically engaged without ‘giving up the science’ supporting them 
– meaning that being potentially political does not immediately preclude any idea from being an object of 
 
70 It should be noted that only English-speaking publishing platforms have been surveyed to assess the reach of the 
‘Anthropocene’ debate in philosophy of science. However, as philosophy of science has been historically advanced 
predominantly by anglophone countries, this is feasibly a sign of overall lack of engagement on an international scale. 
71 Throughout formal and informal talks and email correspondence established with undergraduate, graduate, and 
doctoral students, and advanced academics of a multidisciplinary matrix, it became somewhat clear that the term 
‘Anthropocene’ represents a popular concept only within specific academic niches close to environmental discourse. 
The term is either unknown or at most heard of (generally up to Edward Burtynsky’s 2018 documentary The 
Anthropocene) in other disciplinary areas, and at different academic levels. 

DEFINING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

analysis within philosophy of science. However, as criticized by philosopher Don Howard (2009), most 
post-World War II philosophy of science disengaged with “the social and political concerns that shaped its 
earlier years” (p. 199). He notes that “by the end of the 1950s, thoughtful philosophical debate about the 
place of science in society had all but disappeared, replaced by a highly formalized philosophy of science 
pursued by a new generation of technically well trained young specialists whose inability to think carefully 
about science in context was disguised as disdain for irrelevant, non-technical questions” (p. 201). Without 
going deeper into this complex matter, is it feasible that this detachment may be one possible explanation 
for neglecting to investigate the broader ‘Anthropocene’ idea, and in turn the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
These and more explanations can account for the absence of philosophy of science, and particularly 
philosophy of geology, in Anthropocene Studies. This academic vacuum resulted in the theoretical 
difficulties in approaching the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a stratigraphic hypothesis. While this makes it 
impossible to build on preexisting philosophical literature, it also represents an opportunity to explore with 
the hypothesis in virtually unconstrained terms.  
 
To summarize and conclude the chapter, the present work aims at conducting an epistemological 
analysis of the Anthropocene Hypothesis based on multidisciplinary techniques gravitating around 
philosophy of science. In what follows, the Anthropocene Hypothesis is treated as a separate theoretical 
entity from the ‘Anthropocene.’ It could also be rightfully argued that this theoretical separation minimizes 
the multidisciplinary nature of the Anthropocene – both as a geological time unit and broader boundary 
object. For instance, the very definition of ‘geological Anthropocene’ has been contested even after 
specifying its meaning and scope. Substantial criticism has pointed out that defining a ‘geological 
Anthropocene’ still requires going beyond the natural sciences, including insight from the social sciences 
(Ellis, 2016a) and liberal arts (Bostic & Howey, 2017) because geology per se is built on a language of 
dispossession as well as practices of extractivism and colonialism (Yusoff, 2019). This kind of criticism 
unveils a deeper problem – namely, how to establish methodologically sound interdisciplinarity between 
the geosciences on the one hand and the humanities and social sciences on the other. This remains an open 
question in the broader context of Anthropocene Studies.  
A second point raised by this criticism concerns the blurred descriptive and normative nature of 
the ‘Anthropocene’. Some disciplines involved in ‘Anthropocene’ Studies merely describe some state of 
affairs and apply the label ‘Anthropocene’ to highlight its anthropogenic nature. This is the case for Earth 
System science, evolutionary eco-biology, and the spectrum of disciplines included under geology and 
stratigraphy. Other disciplines, such as ethics, ecocriticism, and environmental humanities, have used the 
term to communicate messages of environmental awareness, responsibility, and stewardship, promoting 
action in a normative sense as a response to a certain state of affairs. The boundaries between normative 
and descriptive statements about the ‘Anthropocene’ are often blurred, and no universal formula to separate 
the two can be obtained. Yet this distinction is considered useful in delimiting the application and meaning 
of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept across different disciplines, and in the context of the present epistemological 
analysis.

CHAPTER 2 
BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I said that we were already in the Anthropocene. 
My remark had a major impact on the audience. 
First there was silence, then people started to discuss this. 
—Paul Crutzen, The Anthropocene: The Human Era and How It Shapes Our Planet 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In his landmark publication The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn (2012) famously begins by 
reconsidering the role of history for the study of science. He writes: “History, if viewed as a repository for 
more than anecdote or chronology, could produce a decisive transformation in the image of science” (p. 
1). He continues writing that, “[i]f science is the constellation of facts, theories, and methods collected in 
current texts, then scientists are the men [sic] who, successfully or not, have striven to contribute one or 
another element to that particular constellation” (p. 2). If the Anthropocene Hypothesis is to be treated as 
a scientific hypothesis, then it is paramount to locate that constellation of facts, theories, methods, scientists, 
and people that contributed to transforming the ‘Anthropocene’ from an informal designation to a scientific 
hypothesis. This is achieved by conducting a historical reconnaissance of those texts that implemented the 
term, and that enable a recognition of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific formulation. In 
particular, a chronology is attempted here of the events leading the ‘Anthropocene’ to evolve from an 
informal, spur-of-the-moment conjecture to a pivotal concept for research agendas, conferences, and a 
dedicated working group (i.e., the AWG). 
 
Hence, section 2.1 explores the birth of the ‘Anthropocene,’ its spread, and its evolution across 
disciplines, fields of knowledge, and scholarly mediums. To do so, a corpus of literature of 670 texts using 
the term ‘Anthropocene’ and produced during the 2000–2009 decade is discussed from a quantitative as 
well as qualitative viewpoint. The quantitative approach dissects the corpus based on selected clusters 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
68 
 
representing properties of interest for analyzing the texts. The qualitative approach analyzes the corpus 
chronologically by surveying sample literature representing important sources in its process of 
dissemination and popularization, and epitomizing different uses of the term. The decade of analysis is 
considered vital in understanding the birth, survival, and evolution of the term in the scientific and academic 
world. The corpus provides an access point on texts as well as workshops, conferences, research initiatives, 
and personal insights from scientists that cumulatively shaped the early identity of the ‘Anthropocene’ – 
laying down the conditions of possibilities for the evolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ into a stratigraphic and 
geochronological hypothesis.  
 
After probing into the early modern history of the ‘Anthropocene,’ section 2.2 then focuses on the 
birth and evolution of the Anthropocene Hypothesis based on the findings retrieved in section 2.1. 
Geological literature using the term ‘Anthropocene’ during the 2000–2009 period is considered indicative 
of the evolution of the ‘geological Anthropocene,’ which engendered the preconditions for the evolution 
of the ‘Anthropocene’ into the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Indeed, the chapter concludes by exploring the 
process of institutionalization of the hypothesis through the establishment of the AWG. 
 
This chapter implements different methodologies to reconstruct the birth of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. Text mining techniques are deemed suitable means for reproducing how the term 
‘Anthropocene’ was perceived, implemented, and shaped over time across disciplinary domains, fields of 
knowledge, and mediums. This content-analysis–oriented method is particularly valuable in deriving 
quantitative data concerning the birth, survival, and spread of the term in academic literature – the primary 
type of literature analyzed. As a complementary methodology, a discourse analysis of sample texts is 
conducted to reconstruct and discuss chronologically the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. This 
method selects suitable textual samples that most represent how the term was implemented during the time 
frame considered. Lastly, the chapter also uses personal communication with the epistemic actors who used 
the term during its early research stages as a discrete and complementary source for reconstructing specific 
events or contextualizing material from the literature. This communication (primarily through email) is 
limited to recollection of the events and motives behind the use of the term by an epistemic actor, and it is 
considered (despite its theoretical and methodological limitations) as a valuable source for reconstructing 
the early history of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
69 
 
2.1 The ‘Anthropocene’ in Early Research Literature 
 
 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis represents a particular variant of the ‘Anthropocene’ – that is, the 
stratigraphic or geological variant. When this variant was formulated, the concept had already been 
circulating in academic literature, and specifically in scientific literature. Therefore, understanding the birth 
of the Anthropocene Hypothesis implies understanding the nature and evolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept across this literature. In turn, this means understanding the modern history of the ‘Anthropocene’ – 
a time period that laid the foundation for the stratigraphic interpretation of the term. This is achieved by 
probing into the very early research literature that pioneered use of the term ‘Anthropocene’ in the academic 
and public arena. 
 
The designations ‘modern history’ and ‘early research literature’ play an important role in 
delineating the approach pursued in this chapter. Therefore, they require some preliminary remarks. 
 
The term ‘modern’ delimits the time frame considered in exploring the history of the concept of 
‘Anthropocene.’ Section 1.2.4 showed that one of the possible ‘histories’ of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
corresponds to its history as an idea and as a term. Existing research on the matter has become somewhat 
polarized between those advocating for a genealogical lineage that extends the semantic roots of the 
‘Anthropocene’ to the late 18th century (‘continuism’), holding that the concept is one among several 
instances of geological reflexivity coined in the past few centuries; and those considering it a theoretical 
singularity based on an unprecedented epistemological setting (‘discontinuism’), holding that the 
genealogical approach fundamentally undermines and deflates the usefulness, importance, and uniqueness 
of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. A proposed solution to this dilemma is to consider the ‘Anthropocene’ a 
discrete instance of geological reflexivity, and to divide its history into paleohistory, prehistory, and modern history. 
This conceptual framework allows us to fit the ‘Anthropocene’ within a meta-historical tradition ascribing 
geological agency to humanity, while at the same time acknowledging the particular conceptual history, 
development, semantics, social context, and usage that distinguishes the concept from past instances of 
geological reflexivity. 
 
Adopting this framework steers us away from the genealogical analysis in order to study the 
modern history of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Genealogical approaches to the 
‘Anthropocene’ are useful in identifying a general trend of geological reflexivity dating as far back as the 
19th century, and to strengthen (or deflate, as argued by discontinuism) the conceptual ancestry of the term. 
However, they provide little insight into the particular modern history of the most recent ‘Anthropocene’ 
term. Instead, they develop a historical outlook on the paleohistory and prehistory of the term. The analysis 
hereby conducted locates the beginning of the modern history of the ‘Anthropocene’ – namely, the year 2000. 
This is virtually unanimously considered the cradle of the ‘Anthropocene’ as originally coined by Paul 
Crutzen during his popular IGBP-SC meeting intervention. Because scholarship around the 
‘Anthropocene’ is still ongoing, its modern history extends from 2000 to the very present.  

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
70 
 
 
The year 2000 also defines the lower historical boundary of the early research literature analyzed in 
this section. Upward, this period is delimited by the establishment of the AWG, and by the publication of 
Chakrabarty’s seminal article “The Climate of History: Four Theses” – both occurring in 2009, and both 
representing major turning points in Anthropocene Studies. Therefore, the early ‘Anthropocene’ research 
literature, or ‘early modern history’ of the ‘Anthropocene,’ comprises research material produced within the 
2000–2009 decade. This is literature characterized by the earliest appearances of the term ‘Anthropocene’ 
in written sources. Early ‘Anthropocene’ research literature serves as a valuable witness to the birth, survival, 
spread, and evolution of the term across disciplines, fields of knowledge, and research institutions over 
time. 
 
There are some drawbacks of a historical nature in the definition of modern history just provided. 
Most notably, the analysis hereby conducted excludes previous influences of crucial importance in 
understanding the conditions of possibility for the ‘Anthropocene’ to gain ground in the academic as well 
as public debate. Factors such as the dawn of the Earth System science approach through the late 1980s, 
the rise and institutionalization of environmental narratives and agendas, and the existence of genealogical 
precursors are intuitively key ingredients for a thorough historical epistemology (Feest & Sturm, 2011; 
Nasim, 2013; Renn, 1996; Sturm, 2011) of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
Presumably, the ‘Anthropocene’ did not emerge from a cultural and intellectual framework that was not 
able to produce it. Some of these aspects were tackled in the previous chapter, but are not considered within 
the modern history of the term. 
 
Nevertheless, there are some pragmatic reasons that justify the exclusion of pre-2000 social, 
cultural, historical, and genealogical factors. First, literature providing a detailed conceptual analysis of the 
prehistory (and birth) of the ‘Anthropocene’ is abundant (e.g., Bonneuil & Fressoz, 2016; Davies, 2018; 
Horn & Bergthaller, 2020; Lewis & Maslin, 2018b; Schwägerl, 2014; Steffen et al., 2011a; Thomas et al., 
2020; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 1.2).72 To provide yet another narrative of the prehistory of the 
‘Anthropocene’ would be redundant. Second, the methodology selected to explore the early research 
literature on the ‘Anthropocene’ focuses on literature produced within a specific time frame – that is, the 
2000–2009 decade. This decade has largely remained unexplored in extant Anthropocene scholarship, 
despite being crucial in understanding the modern history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. The appearance 
of the term ‘Anthropocene’ in written academic contexts since 2000 grants the selected literature 
outstanding value and insight that cannot be equally deduced from earlier textual sources, genealogical 
precursors, or from the broader social and intellectual climate. Lastly, retracing the early modern history of 
the ‘Anthropocene’ is only useful in delineating the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis – the latter 
representing the main object of this overall research. Therefore, an exhaustive conceptual and historical 
analysis of the ‘Anthropocene’ is a different trajectory than the one hereby pursued. 
 
72 There are other examples of conceptual history beyond monographs and research articles. Perhaps emblematic is 
the research group ‘Anthropocene Formations’ developed by the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science 
under Department I (see https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/project/knowledge-anthropocene, accessed on May 7, 
2021) to study the history (both as in ‘human history’ and ‘conceptual history’) of the ‘Anthropocene.’  

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
71 
 
 
The 2000–2009 decade represents a time period of great interest and value in the history of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis and the ‘Anthropocene’ – not least because it represents the time when the term 
first appeared in research literature with its modern connotation.73 Literature representing this time frame 
has often summarized it in a few crucial publications – namely, Crutzen and Stoermer’s (2000) seminal 
IGBP article; Crutzen’s (2002d) “Geology of Mankind”; Nature’s (2003) “Welcome to the Anthropocene”; 
Steffen et al. (2007) “The Anthropocene: Are Humans Now Overwhelming the Great Forces of Nature?”; 
Zalasiewicz et al. (2008b) “Are We Now Living in the Anthropocene?”; and lastly Chakrabarty’s (2009) 
“The Climate of History: Four Theses.” These represent crucial contributions in the history of the 
‘Anthropocene’ and are often used as ‘standard literature’ epitomizing the early modern history of the term. 
Whilst undoubtedly valuable, these publications cannot fully epitomize nor appreciate the reception of the 
‘Anthropocene’ among researchers and research communities. A more in-depth analysis is needed to 
understand the birth of the ‘Anthropocene,’ and thus of the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
The general trend in reconstructing the modern history of the ‘Anthropocene’ has been to 
summarize it through an exegesis of and commentary on the standard literature. A few examples of this 
trend are illustrated below. 
 
In his second chapter of The Birth of the Anthropocene, Davies (2018) conducts an interpretative 
analysis of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept as portrayed in Crutzen’s two landmark publications, namely, “The 
‘Anthropocene’” (2000) and “Geology of Mankind” (2002d). According to Davies, these texts provide 
archetypical versions of the Anthropocene which were foundational to later interpretations of the notion. 
Indeed, the chapter concludes with the “stratigraphic turn” (Davies, 2018, p. 64), consisting of the birth of 
the geological ‘Anthropocene’ with the establishment of the AWG, and the role of Chakrabarty’s paper for 
setting a ground base for humanist versions of the ‘Anthropocene.’ However, Davies does not discuss the 
very texts where ‘Anthropocene’ was being implemented during its early stages, and thus how different 
disciplines perceived and used the term. He briefly notes that the ‘Anthropocene’ concept “began to appear 
in articles about human geography and geopolitics and in books for general audiences by environmental 
writers” (Davies, 2018, p. 44). However, no bibliographic references are provided for the articles, 
disciplines, and books he mentions, and no further historical analysis is conducted on the early research 
literature. 
 
In his book The Anthropocene: The Human Era and How It Shapes Our Planet, Christian Schwägerl 
(2014) provides extensive valuable insights in terms of localizing the researchers, scholars, and general 
audience interested in the ‘Anthropocene’ by also narrating his first-hand experience with the process of 
institutionalization of the concept – especially in German scholarship. However, the history of the concept 
during its first decade of existence is summarized in roughly three pages (pp. 51–53), mentioning only a 
few publications of the ‘standard literature’ (i.e., Crutzen, 2002d; Crutzen & Stoermer, 2000; Steffen et al., 
2007). Thereafter, the book primarily focuses on the ‘state of affairs’ of the Anthropocene – that is, its 
 
73 As noted in section 1.2.4.2, the term ‘Anthropocene’ appeared as a translation of the Russian term ‘aнтропоген,’ 
but its connotation is substantially different from the modern ‘Anthropocene.’  

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
72 
 
underlying causes and political consequences from a social, technological, and environmental perspective. 
Again, a focused analysis of the ‘Anthropocene’ early research literature is absent. 
 
A third account of the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ idea is provided in the first and ninth chapters 
of The Human Planet: How We Created the Anthropocene, by Lewis and Maslin (2018a). The monograph 
constitutes a landmark in Anthropocene Studies, delivering a clear explanatory narrative of the convergence 
of historical, evolutionary, and geological time, while at the same time providing a critical and highly 
discussed hypothesis on the onset of the Anthropocene as a geological unit (see sections 3.2.3.2 and 3.2.4.3). 
However, the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ idea is once again reduced to the quest of finding genealogical 
predecessors. Chapter 1 (“The Hidden History of the Anthropocene,” pp. 19–41) recalls in just three pages 
(pp. 20–23) the “standard narrative” (p. 20) of the Anthropocene, condensing the 2000–2009 decade into 
Crutzen and Stoermer (2000), Crutzen (2002d), and Zalasiewicz et al. (2008).  
 
A survey of the main existing monographs and research items (Bonneuil & Fressoz, 2016; Ellis, 
2018; Hamilton, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2015a; Moore, 2016a; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b) shows that they 
exhibit the same general pattern – that is, a preference for seeking genealogical precursors of the 
‘Anthropocene’ rather than probing into its early research phase. Presumably, part of the reason behind 
this trend is the novelty of the term, especially in the context of the humanities and social sciences, which 
began to systematically engage with the term only after 2010. A second reason stems from the diversified 
areas of interest developed within Anthropocene Studies, some of which established primary focus areas at 
the expense of a conceptual history of the modern usage of the term.  
 
Therefore, the central goal of this section is reconstructing the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ during 
its early research stage (i.e., 2000–2009), which in turn enables a reconstruction of the cultural and research 
premises that engendered the Anthropocene Hypothesis. To achieve this target, one must investigate the 
concept’s birthplace and the context of its evolution by understanding how the term was used and by 
whom, and what research trajectories it undertook during its early appearance and spread among academic 
communities.  
 
2.1.1 Methodology: A Quantitative and Qualitative Overlook 
 
How, then, to reconstruct the early history of the modern ‘Anthropocene’? 
 
The methodology selected combines a quantitative keyword approach and text mining analysis of 
a selected corpus of literature with a qualitative discourse analysis of texts.74 Choosing a keyword approach 
was rather intuitive: if the main target is assessing how the concept had been used during its early research 
stage, then surveying the appearance of the term ‘Anthropocene’ across the very first published sources 
using it provides a valuable means to this end. In particular, the relative frequency of the term 
 
74 This methodology is only restricted to the study of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept during its early stages (i.e., 2000-
2009). 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
73 
 
‘Anthropocene’ in published texts provides a useful proxy for authors’ early engagement with the concept. 
Indeed, relative frequency is central in distinguishing between a qualitative and a quantitative approach to 
the identified corpus of literature – each discussed respectively in section 2.1.2 and section 2.1.3. 
 
Whilst text mining (which includes word frequency) has been a historically intrinsic aspect of 
quantitative linguistics studies (Popescu, 2009), keyword approaches are not very common in historical 
research. Baron, Rayson, and Archer (2009) note that “there are relatively few studies of historical data that 
make use of the key words approach. Several of these […] explore classic English literature, whilst others 
explore specific activity types such as the historical English courtroom […] or specific topics such as 
swearing” (p. 7). This is also reflected in most historical and philosophical studies on science – with the 
notable exception of the field of scientometrics, the quantitative study of science and science 
communication through texts (Leydesdorff & Milojević, 2015). For the present research, this condition 
represents both an obstacle and an opportunity. As an obstacle, it means that the research hereby conducted 
cannot build on preexisting studies of a similar nature. No text mining analyses functional to the study of 
scientific hypotheses or concepts and their birth have been identified to draw on or borrow methodology 
from, making the foundations of this study necessarily less corroborated.75 As an opportunity, it means that 
the method champions a novel approach – at least within Anthropocene Studies – to the study of the 
‘Anthropocene’ concept. This method can be integrated with further in-depth analyses (e.g., sociological, 
bibliometrics, scientometrics, data science, etc.) of the mechanisms and modalities behind the spread of 
scientific ideas (e.g., Jiang et al., 2021; Morgan et al., 2018). 
 
There are some identifiable epistemic benefits of choosing this unprecedented approach. The first 
benefits relate to its novelty. No quantitative analysis of this kind has so far been conducted in respect to 
the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. As such, it provides a unique overview of a substantial corpus 
of literature that has been largely dwarfed by ‘standard literature’ narratives. A second related benefit 
concerns the literature discussed. As anticipated, much ‘Anthropocene’ scholarship has primarily focused 
on the genealogy of the ‘Anthropocene’ idea. This has left a significant vacuum concerning the role of early 
research literature in engendering the ‘Anthropocene’ concept and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. The 
approach hereby pursued reconsiders the epistemic, conceptual, and historical value of this literature, all of 
which has been largely overlooked. A third benefit concerns the research trajectory that this methodology 
generates. Such an approach opens the possibility for further quantitative studies in this direction – for 
instance, by systematically surveying the term in other languages. Feasibly, such an approach could also be 
used for retracing the history of other scientific concepts and ideas. 
 
Conversely, this methodology necessarily has some limitations. Those relating to the technical 
aspects of the research (e.g., software accuracy, corpus completeness, etc.) are explained throughout the 
following subsections. As already stressed, one major limitation is that this method does not include within 
its range of analysis neither the paleohistory nor the prehistory of the ‘Anthropocene’ – that is, the historical, 
 
75 The only known exception in Anthropocene Studies is a linguistic study from Zottola and de Majo (forthcoming), 
who focus on use of the term ‘Anthropocene’ in newspapers between 2000 and 2018. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
74 
 
intellectual, and scientific contexts wherein the concept matured. However, this limitation is considered 
relevant only if a thorough conceptual history of the ‘Anthropocene’ is the primary target. Since this is not 
the case, the limitation is only partial. Another possible limitation is the applicability of this approach for 
longer time frames. The number of texts published using the word ‘Anthropocene’ during the 2000-2009 
decade is vastly outweighed by those published during the 2010–2019 decade, during which the term saw a 
steep increase in academic and public appearance. A keyword search on the online research dataset 
Dimensions (accessed on September 17, 2021) provides 1,311 results for the 2000–2009 decade compared 
with 63,104 results for the 2010–2009 decade, showing a substantial difference in literature produced during 
the two decades. While the total number of results for the former decade makes text mining analysis 
feasible, this is not the case for the latter decade. This means that a comprehensive analysis of sources 
implementing the term ‘Anthropocene’ throughout all years since its coinage cannot be easily conducted 
(at least on an individual-scale project) with the methodology hereby chosen. 
 
In the following subsections, the procedural steps to retrieve the early research literature and 
conduct a critical survey are outlined first. Then, section 2.1.1.2 explains the salient features of the corpus 
used in the analysis. Lastly, section 2.1.1.3 discusses the modality and purpose of retrieving the relative 
frequency of the term ‘Anthropocene’ in the textual corpus used to discuss the ‘Anthropocene’ in early 
research literature. 
 
2.1.1.1 Procedure 
 
The process leading from search and selection of literature to the organization and discussion of the corpus 
consisted of seven main steps, each discussed in the following paragraphs. 
 
Step 1 – Defining Search Tools. The first step was selecting the tools for retrieving texts using the term 
‘Anthropocene’ in the time period considered (i.e., 2000–2009). Given the recent production of the 
literature in question, almost all of the material was accessible online. This search has used three online 
search engines and bibliographic databases for scientific publications: ScienceDirect, WorldWideScience, 
and Dimensions. ScienceDirect is Elsevier’s search engine for peer-reviewed literature, and covers a corpus 
of more than 18 million articles and book chapters from over 2,500 journals and 42,000 electronic books.76 
WorldWideScience is a federated-search–based77 engine of multinational and multilingual reach released in 
2007. Dimensions is the world’s largest linked research information dataset, comprising 118 million 
publications and a network of 1.4 billion citations.78 Google Scholar was also partially used for the search, 
but the overabundance of results makes it largely impractical to survey all results in a reasonable timescale.

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
75 
 
These represent easily accessible and easy-to-use search engines and databases available on the Internet, 
and they are particularly valuable for retrieving literature produced in recent times. No particular criteria 
were predefined for selecting these search engines and databases (among the more than fifty available on 
the Internet) other than preexisting knowledge and acquaintance with these. However, the selection of 
multiple search engines ensured greater exhaustiveness of the corpus, meaning that the final corpus should 
incorporate an exhaustive portion of all material published during the decade analyzed implementing the 
word ‘Anthropocene’ in anglophone literature.  
 
Step 2 – Defining Search Criteria. Once the proper search engines were selected, keyword search was the next 
step to gather the corpus of literature. The search parameters were two: the keyword/unigram 
‘Anthropocene’ (case-insensitive) in all texts, and the time range of interest (i.e., 2000–2009). English-
language results was a third implicit parameter, considering that the keyword ‘Anthropocene’ is an English-
born term. However, sample records from languages other than English were also considered in developing 
the corpus. Each of the search engines and databases provided highly variable results: only ~117 results 
through ScienceDirect, but ~1,258 results through WorldWideScience, and ~1,311 results through 
Dimensions. As anticipated, Google Scholar provided a much higher number of results at ~11,900, making 
an extensive review of single results practically unfeasible.79 Intuitively, the algorithms delivering these 
results are not error-free. Indeed, scrutinizing the results showed multiple types of errors, such as multiple 
counting (i.e., same record in multiple results), incorrect time range, or missing keyword. Furthermore, 
search results may have excluded cases of misspelled variants (e.g., ‘Anthropocenne,’ ‘Antropocene,’ 
‘Athropocene’), meaning that the final corpus may exclude these occurrences (likely rare).  
 
Step 3 – Defining the Corpus. A further step consisted of defining the criteria used to navigate the search results 
obtained from step 2. As mentioned, not all results could be immediately translated into individual cases, or 
records, of texts using the term ‘Anthropocene’ (i.e., the ~1,258 WorldWideScience search results are not 
equivalent to 1,258 unique records). This required a dedicated analysis of every individual result from the 
total combined results (approximately 2,700, excluding Google Scholar) among the selected search engines 
and databases. Intuitively, the main criterion to ‘filter’ results and convert them into working data (i.e., 
records) for the corpus was the appearance of the word ‘Anthropocene’ (case-insensitive) in texts. However, 
appearance alone was not considered sufficient for representing a valid corpus of literature. Thus, material 
where the unigram appeared only in the bibliography (for instance, as a title of a reference) was excluded. 
While this material witnesses the spread of the term across literature, it does not directly use the term, and 
therefore cannot be interpreted as proxy of early usage of the concept. Any result referring to the 
‘Anthropocene’ either indirectly (e.g., the ‘Age of Humans’), or as a ‘meta-entity’ (i.e., identifying the same 
object with different words) was also excluded because of the practical difficulties in retrieving this type of 
 
79 The approximation symbols reflect the fact that results may vary over time – for instance, because search engines 
are improved, and search queries provide more (or fewer) results. The results for each search engine and database 
mentioned are current as of May 10, 2021. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

record. Results where the term appeared only as part of a project’s name or acronym (e.g., SOPRAN, 
Surface Ocean Processes in the Anthropocene) mentioned in the text were also excluded, as these texts did 
not engage with the term per se. The selection criteria did not discriminate amongst results in terms of 
format. However, priority was given to academic records. Following this preference, the reception and 
appearance of the ‘Anthropocene’ across newspaper outlets is not exhaustive, and only a few newspaper 
articles are included in the corpus (see Zottola & de Majo, forthcoming, for a study dedicated to the 
reception of the ‘Anthropocene’ in news and media). Similarly, the selection criteria did not discriminate 
based on language. However, the anglophone origins and context of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept as well as 
the search engines used limit the analysis of the reception of the ‘Anthropocene’ in non-anglophone 
literature (especially in languages that do not use the Latin alphabet). Only a sample of the non-English 
reception of the term is considered.  
 
Most of the material gathered was accessible for free. Material that was not readily available in 
online format (e.g., due to considerable monetary restrictions or other access limitations) was retrieved by 
contacting the authors, or through library access (mostly through the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek of 
Munich). After filtering all search results accordingly, the final corpus totaled 670 records. These records 
represent the basic working unit of the research conducted. They represent texts of various formats, 
languages, authorship, disciplinary provenance, and length, and define the corpus of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
early research literature.  
 
Step 4 – Organizing the Corpus. Each of the 670 records was stored as a discrete entry on EndNote X8(.2). 
Because the main target is assessing how the concept of ‘Anthropocene’ was used in early research literature, 
some salient properties of the corpus were identified and used to label each record. These properties are 
publication year, field of knowledge, discipline, language, format, and relative frequency of the term ‘Anthropocene.’ 
These clusters represent the backbone upon which the quantitative analysis of the literature is conducted, 
and their selection and purpose are discussed separately in section 2.1.1.2.  
 
Step 5 – Text Mining. An important cluster for organizing the corpus is the relative frequency (or normalized 
frequency) of the term ‘Anthropocene’ (case-insensitive) for each of the 670 records. Relative frequency is 
interpreted as a measure of authors’ engagement with the term. Texts with higher normalized frequency are 
considered texts exhibiting higher engagement with the term. Conversely, texts with lower normalized 
frequency are considered texts exhibiting lower engagement with the term. The meaning and purpose of 
this numerical value requires a distinct analysis, conducted in section 2.1.1.3. The relative frequency of the 
term was determined by using the software Voyant Tools – an open source online software designed for 
text analysis.80 This software was selected because of its focus on the digital humanities, because of its 
intuitive interface, and because it is open access. Text mining analysis required records to be readable as 
PDFs, and to have a software-readable text (i.e., scans of printed texts could not be readily mined by Voyant

77 
 
Tools). Texts that did not initially correspond to this format and requirement were converted through 
Adobe Acrobat X Pro (version 10.1.16.13). After determining the relative frequency for each record, two 
clusters were used to divide the corpus based on a selected threshold value. This value allowed the literature 
to be divided into central and peripheral literature, and to explore the former through a more insightful 
historical and conceptual analysis. 
 
Step 6 – Retrieving Findings. Approaching the corpus through the selected clusters revealed interesting 
information. From a quantitative viewpoint, several salient types of information could be retrieved, such as 
(1) the number of disciplines that have engaged with the term; (2) which disciplines used it the most (and 
least) among those engaging with it; (3) what field of knowledge saw the most interest; (4) the yearly increase 
in appearance in publication; (5) the main formats where the unigram appears; (6) which languages other 
than English engaged with the term; and (7) how much literature has a direct engagement with the term 
versus literature passively implementing it. These figures allow for a more thorough and qualitative 
discussion of the corpus. 
 
Step 7 – Discussion. The last step was to discuss and contextualize the numerical findings from a qualitative 
viewpoint. The discussion also looks at those texts whose relative frequency shows a high degree of 
engagement with the concept in question. This literature is analyzed to assess how the concept was being 
conceived by early authors during the very first years of its existence. It is recognized that some disciplines 
played a pivotal role in engendering certain conceptions of the ‘Anthropocene,’ especially in scientific 
literature. Oceanography, hydrology, and limnology are an example of this, with much of the literature in 
the corpus gravitating around it during the concept’s earliest years. Because a quantitative overlook can only 
get so far in delineating the early modern history of the ‘Anthropocene,’ a qualitative analysis is a necessary 
complementary effort. 
 
2.1.1.2 The Clusters 
 
Step 4 consisted of assigning to each of the 670 records defining the corpus specific ‘labels’ that represent 
some properties of interest in reconstructing the ‘Anthropocene’ in its early research phase. These labels 
form five main clusters – namely, publication year, field of knowledge, discipline, format, and language (Fig 2.1). 
Relative frequency is an additional property discussed separately in the next section. Each individual record 
was assigned one (in the case of publication year, language, format, and relative frequency) or more (in the 
case of discipline and field of knowledge) of these labels based on the record’s specific attributes. Once all 
records were labelled accordingly, the resulting clusters provided informative insights into the corpus.

Figure 2.1. The five main clusters used to organize the corpus. Each cluster is defined by a certain 
number of corresponding ‘labels’ (ten for publication years, five for fields of knowledge, etc.). Every 
record in the corpus has at least one of each type of label. 
 
 
Publication year reflects the year when a specific record was published. Intuitively, each record was assigned 
only one publication year.81 The sum of all records published in a given year between 2000 and 2009 
provides the records per year value (section 2.1.2.1). Records per year is an interesting quantitative measure, 
in that it provides information about the increase (or decrease) of the appearance of the term 
‘Anthropocene’ over time. As such, records per year can be interpreted as a proxy for usage increase (as is 
indeed the case for the ‘Anthropocene’ concept), which in turns means increased interest in the term. 
Indeed, a key epistemic assumption behind this particular cluster is that an increase (or decrease) in the 
term’s appearance in texts means an increase (or decrease) in interest.82 Naturally, this is because authors 
interested in the term may have reasons to use it (conversely, authors disinterested in the term may have 
no reason to use it). Additionally, dissecting literature based on records per year aids the qualitative survey 
on the corpus by providing a chronological setting. As later discussed in section 2.1.3, some years saw a 
particularly visible increase in records per years that grounds a conventional partition of the history of the 
‘Anthropocene’ in early research literature. 
 
Field of knowledge represents the particular knowledge domain that a record belongs to. Traditional 
scholarship recognizes five main fields of knowledge that constitute higher education – namely, humanities, 
social sciences, natural sciences, applied sciences, and formal sciences. Fields of knowledge are supersets of disciplines. 
Each encompasses a number of disciplines that are diverse in their methods and objects of research. They 
serve primarily an organizational purpose rather than delimiting a strict epistemological demarcation 
between knowledge domains. For instance, universities commonly organize (e.g., financially, educationally, 
 
81 Equal records (e.g., exact same article) republished in different years are not considered. 
82 This assumption is also a reason why texts including the term ‘Anthropocene’ only as part of a project’s name were 
excluded from the corpus (step 3), in that these do not provide valid data for interest in the term. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE

etc.) their faculties and departments through structures following this type of classification. Scholars and 
researchers locate themselves within disciplines that belong to one field of knowledge (or more, in the case 
of inter-/transdisciplinarity), so that terms such as ‘humanist,’ ‘social scientist,’ or ‘natural scientist’ express 
in a basic and loose way what methods, objects, or philosophies researchers endorse in pursuing their 
research interests.  
 
The methodology hereby developed adopts this five-fold system of classification to determine what 
fields of knowledge were predominant in the ‘Anthropocene’ early research literature. Each record is 
assigned one or more fields of knowledge. Multiple fields of knowledge for the same record are assigned if 
the particular record engages in any form of multi-/inter-/transdisciplinarity – for instance, if it represents 
a study merging geology (i.e., natural sciences) with sociology (i.e., social sciences). How records are assigned 
a given field of knowledge depends on the particular discipline it is assigned. Each discipline corresponds 
to one and only one field of knowledge in the way represented in Figure 2.2. Consequently, assigning a 
discipline also implies assigning one more field(s) of knowledge to a record. The distribution of disciplines 
across fields of knowledge follows the outline of academic disciplines as illustrated by the respective 
Wikipedia page,83 which provides a concise and useful organizational scheme of academic disciplines. The 
only major differences lie in the status of the disciplines of history, which is hereby considered part of the 
social sciences rather than the humanities, and physical geography, hereby classified as a natural science.

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
80 
 
 
The records per field of knowledge represents the sum of all records for a given field of knowledge (section 
2.1.2.2). Records per field of knowledge provides a coarse-grained overview of the knowledge domains that 
most engaged with the term ‘Anthropocene’ during its early research stage. Because records may be assigned 
two or more fields of knowledge, this type of clusterization also enables dividing the corpus into multi-
domain and single-domain records. A multi-domain record is a record merging disciplines from two or more 
fields of knowledge (e.g., an Earth System science and political science record). Conversely, a single-domain 
record is defined by one or more disciplines within a single field of knowledge (e.g., a climatology and/or 
oceanography record). Multi-domain is not equivalent to multidisciplinarity – the latter describing a form 
of interaction among disciplines rather than fields of knowledge. Multi-domain and single-domain are salient 
properties because they help assess the degree to which the ‘Anthropocene’ represented an object whose 
conceptual history was confined to a single domain or multiple knowledge domains. 
 
Discipline represents the particular disciplinary domain characterizing a record (e.g., geology, 
sociology, Earth System science, engineering, etc.). Disciplines are subcategories of fields of knowledge in 
a way illustrated in Figure 2.2, so that assigning one or more disciplines to a given record always implies 
assigning one or more field(s) of knowledge.84 The sum of all records for a given discipline provides records 
per discipline (section 2.1.2.3). While records per field of knowledge provides a coarse-grained lens of analysis, 
records per discipline provides a fine-grained overview of which disciplines engaged with the term, and 
which engaged the most. This makes a discipline-based division one of the most informative properties of 
the corpus. Additionally, disciplinarity distribution provides a measure of multidisciplinarity. Terms such as 
‘multidisciplinarity,’ ‘transdisciplinarity,’ and ‘interdisciplinarity’ define different ways of interaction and/or 
collaboration among disciplinary domains and fields of knowledge (for related literature, see Andersen, 
2016; Darian-Smith & McCarty, 2016; Youngblood, 2007). In the present context, multidisciplinarity is 
defined in its broadest sense as the occurrence of multiple disciplines in characterizing the disciplinary 
content and/or provenience of a record. Each record that is assigned two or more disciplines is immediately 
labelled as multidisciplinary – regardless of the disciplines’ respective fields of knowledge, or the particular 
type of interaction among disciplines. 
 
The disciplines listed in Figure 2.2 represent all disciplines that characterize the corpus of literature. 
They were not selected based on a preestablished pool of an arbitrarily large number of disciplines (unlike 
fields of knowledge, which were drawn from the Wikipedia outline). Rather, their selection emerged 
organically from the organization of the corpus conducted between step 3 and step 4. Thus, disciplinary 
classification of the corpus is not applied to records ex ante, but rather is a product of the records themselves 
ex post. This represented a way to remain faithful to the disciplinary content and provenance of each of the 
records.  
 
The main criterion used to assign each record one or more disciplines was crosschecking (whenever 
information was available) the record’s title, summary/abstract/preface, publication platform (e.g., journal,

publisher), and author’s academic affiliation (e.g., ‘Department of Geology’ indicating geology as discipline) 
or background. Wherever crosschecking was not entirely possible or clear (a very minute portion of the 
corpus defined primarily by records of non-academic format), the record’s title and author’s affiliation or 
background were given priority in determining the discipline. To avoid proliferation of stand-alone 
disciplines (and thus clusters), a second criterion was to group specialized disciplines into their largest 
disciplinary domain (e.g., historical geology, petrology, and physical geology are grouped under ‘geology’). 
In the case of disciplines resulting from the convergence of two or more disciplines, each of the converging 
disciplines is used to label the record rather than their converging product (e.g., a record recognizable as 
geochemistry is clustered under ‘geology’ and ‘chemistry’). 
 
Assessing the disciplinary provenance of each record was perhaps the hardest property to detect. 
Major difficulties in inferring disciplinarity derived from (1) the specific formats of some records (e.g., 
pamphlets, web pages, newspaper articles), (2) the specialized disciplinary provenance of some records, (3) 
the extra- or non-disciplinary nature of some records, and/or (4) the mixed disciplinary matrixes of records 
(i.e., authors with different disciplinary backgrounds x, y, and z, publishing in a journal p about the topics 
a, b, and c – all placeholders representing different disciplinary areas). These represented some of the major 
challenges in assigning disciplinarity to records in a way that would be faithful to the nature of the record 
itself. Each challenge was tackled respectively by (1) considering the content of the format in addition to 
crosschecking general information, (2) grouping specialized disciplines into their larger disciplinary area, (3) 
assigning a discipline based on content-proximity by analyzing the text, and (4) ascribing different 
disciplines to records of a multidisciplinary nature. 
 
Format represents the particular type of literature characterizing a record. Any type of format was 
included in the definition of the corpus conducted during step 3, meaning that the corpus is comprised of 
a variety of records of different formats (listed in Figure 2.1 above). However, primary attention was given 
to academic literature over non-academic literature (especially newspapers and websites, which are 
intrinsically difficult to track through the search engines used, and thus may not have been exhaustively 
accounted for in the final corpus). Similar to the selection of disciplines, the fourteen types of recognized 
formats emerged organically from the nature of the records themselves. Indeed, the very selection of format 
as a cluster mirrors the diversity among textual sources engendering the corpus. Format is an informative 
cluster for three main reasons. First, by assigning each record one (and only one) format, it is possible to 
assess what means of publishing the ‘Anthropocene’ concept spread most through. This assessment can be 
integrated with studies on science communication concerning what formats provide more visibility, or 
which are more effective in strengthening the scientificity or institutionalization process of scientific ideas.85 
Second, the existence of multiple formats witnesses the methods of propagation of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
across and beyond academic scholarship. This is a salient feature of the history of the concept that is to be 
drawn.  
 
85 The clusters used do not probe into the specific subtypes of formats – i.e., original research, short reports, and 
review articles (rather than book reviews) published in journals are all grouped under ‘journal articles.’ 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
82 
 
 
Lastly, each record is assigned one (and only one) language representing the specific language of the 
record. As anticipated, English has been the primary language of the ‘Anthropocene’ by an outstanding 
margin. This is not solely connected to the extant status of English as the language of international scientific 
communication, but also because it represents the mother language of the term itself.86 Accordingly, the 
tools used in step 1 and 2 were mostly English-focused databases and search engines, and the keyword 
search itself has been conducted by using the English unigram ‘Anthropocene.’ Therefore, the vast majority 
of records are in English.  
 
Despite these parameters, a few records in European (French, German, Italian) and non-European 
(Chinese, Japanese) languages are nevertheless included in the corpus. This literature emerged 
independently from cross-surveying search engines and databases. It is plausible that each language-cluster 
is not utterly indicative of the type of scholarship that a specific linguistic community was pursuing during 
the first decade of existence of the ‘Anthropocene’ (e.g., Chinese records cannot be confidently used as 
proxies for Chinese research on the ‘Anthropocene’ during its early phase). However, records in languages 
other than English are extremely informative in that they provide a condensed snapshot of the way the 
term was being received in the international scholarly audience,87 and they witness the reach of the term 
beyond linguistic and geographical confines. These are important aspects taken into consideration in the 
qualitative assessment of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
Once each record is assigned each of these types of labels, the clusters generated provide different 
numerical and visual proxies forming the basis for a quantitative analysis of the ‘Anthropocene’ in early 
research literature. Using these clusters also provides crucial insights in reconstructing the history and 
evolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept during its early phase. Notably, these selected clusters do not 
exhaust the spectrum of possible properties observable across the corpus. Author-focused analysis, word 
cloud analysis, social network analysis, inter-/trans-/multidisciplinary analysis, and more, could represent 
additional lenses of analysis for clustering the corpus. Delimiting the scope of the present analysis through 
the selected clusters only follows pragmatic and organizational motives. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
86 This is true only for the modern history of the ‘Anthropocene.’ When its paleo- and pre-history are considered, one 
could make the case that the term ‘Anthropocene’ first appeared in the Russian language, although the canonical 
translation from Shanster (1973) could be contested. See section 1.2.4.2. 
87 A linguistic barrier with some of the languages identified does not allow for a deep analysis of all the non-English 
records – especially for Chinese and Japanese literature. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
83 
 
2.1.1.3 Relative Frequency 
 
An additional salient property retrieved from each record is the relative frequency of the term ‘Anthropocene.’ 
Relative frequency is a measure commonly used in linguistics to compare texts or corpora of different sizes. 
Its numerical value is expressed according to the following formula: 
 
𝐹𝑛= 𝐹𝑜
106
𝑇 
 
Where Fn is the normalized or relative frequency (to a million, 106, and expressed in real numbers, ≥ 0), Fo 
is the observed frequency (i.e., total n-gram counts in a text), and T is text size (i.e., word count). 
 
An example may better illustrate the meaning of relative frequency. Suppose a text A has 50 
occurrences of the word ‘Anthropocene,’ whereas a second text B has 25 occurrences – so that Fo(A) = 50, 
and Fo(B) = 25. The observed frequency of ‘Anthropocene’ in text A is higher than that of text B. However, 
suppose A has a word count of 10,000, whereas B is only 2,500 words long – so that T(A) = 10,000, and 
T(B) = 2,500. In this case, the observed frequency alone will be insufficient to compare the texts because 
they have different text sizes. Therefore, it is necessary to normalize their frequencies by a common factor 
(i.e., a million), so that, according to the formula above, Fn(A) = 50 ∙ (106/10,000) = 5,000, and Fn(B) = 25 
∙ (106/2,500) = 10,000. While the term ‘Anthropocene’ appears twice as many times in text A than text B, 
the relative frequency of the term is half of that of text B – meaning that the term ‘Anthropocene’ is actually 
twice as frequent in B than A. 
 
The Fn for each record was retrieved by using the open source software Voyant Tools (step 5). 
Texts were individually uploaded as readable PDF files, and the relative frequency for each was 
automatically measured by the software through the above formula. This process requires a few 
methodological remarks.  
 
A first remark concerns one type of material uploaded for text mining. Edited volumes (labelled as 
‘book section’) with multiple authors were not uploaded in their entirety. Only those chapters from distinct 
authors where the term ‘Anthropocene’ appears were mined for obtaining the relative frequency. This 
criterion ensured that each record was faithful to its textual content, and the relative frequency was 
consistent with the text analyzed. The criterion also implied considering multiple sections in the same edited 
volume as discrete records in the corpus. The same criterion did not apply to monographs authored by one 
or more authors, where all text is representative of the author or authors’ engagement with the term. 
 
A second set of remarks concerns some methodological limitations related to the accuracy of the 
software implemented.  
 
The software mines the text in its entirety, meaning that each word in the text is counted regardless 
of the specific place in the text where a word appears (e.g., footer, header, bibliography, keywords, etc.). 
For example, the software counted each occurrence of ‘Anthropocene’ in the header or footer of a given 
text where the header or footer includes the publication’s title on each page (or every other page). This 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
84 
 
resulted in several occurrences of the word as a product of the publishing layout of a journal or book section 
(or any other similar format) rather than the text’s engagement with the term. Similarly, relative frequency 
accounts for the occurrence of the term in the bibliography section of a text (consistent with the search 
criteria defined in step 3, texts selected for the corpus must not occur exclusively in bibliography). However, 
a quick survey of each entry during the text mining step reveals that such occurrences are rare, and occurring 
in texts with low relative frequency. 
 
Additionally, the software often recognized numbers, DOIs, dates, URLs, HTTPs, or other written 
linguistic expressions of various types as ‘words,’ hence retrieving a total word count that did not entirely 
correspond to the exact total word count of texts – ‘exact’ implying that a (written) ‘word’ is understood as 
a single linguistic entity with meaning.88 However, because these represent a very minor set of written 
expressions compared to the main body of the texts, their impact on the total word count (and thus for the 
relative frequency) for each record is negligible. 
 
A similar software-related reading error related to the accuracy of distinguishing words in a way 
that affected the total word count (i.e., T). The software was not always able to distinguish all individual 
words as different words, occasionally merging (and thus counting) two words as one (e.g., ‘the 
humanimpact,’ ‘Theanthropocene,’ ‘anthropocenebegan’). This too represented a minor issue throughout 
the corpus (it only affected T, with a negligible effect on Fn), which was only relevant when Fo of 
‘Anthropocene’ needed to be assessed. In this case, the text mining conducted by Voyant Tools was 
crosschecked by a simple Ctrl-F search on the PDF of the text in question. If a higher Fo value was retrieved 
through the Ctrl-F search, then Fn was adjusted manually. 
 
Lastly, another software-related type of error in retrieving relative frequency derived from the 
misreading of words split at page end (i.e., An–thropocene, Anthro–pocene, Anthropo–cene, Anthropoce–
ne). These instances were not recognized by the software as occurrences of the word ‘Anthropocene.’ This 
error (very limited in the corpus) was corrected by first keywording various components of the word (e.g., 
‘cene,’ ‘anthr,’ etc.) to locate possible word splits, then adding the corrected errors to the total observed 
frequency of the term ‘Anthropocene’ obtained by the software, and lastly implementing the relative 
frequency formula to obtain manually the desired value (rounded up). 
 
The central idea behind implementing relative frequency for reconstructing the history of the 
‘Anthropocene’ in early research literature is that it represents a valid proxy for assessing each record’s 
particular engagement with the term. Intuitively, not all texts using the term ‘Anthropocene’ have the same 
type and degree of engagement with it. Texts where the term appears on multiple occasions are usually texts 
that actively engage with the term – for instance, by discussing its meaning, its implications, its usefulness, 
or more. Conversely, records with low relative frequency are typically texts where the term ‘Anthropocene’ 
is primarily a ‘background’ notion – meaning that the texts do not probe into its semantic, but merely 
mention it marginally, or use it as an introductory or conclusive metaphorical device. If relative frequency 
 
88 This definition is only pragmatic. As argued by the linguist Martin Haspelmath (2011), “we do not have a good 
answer to the question of how to define the notion of word in a clear and consistent way that accords with our 
intuitions and with conventional practice” (p. 32). 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE

is a proxy for textual engagement with the term, then those texts with higher relative frequency represent 
the main sources of historical value for reconstructing the history the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
Indeed, relative frequency is particularly relevant in distinguishing between central and peripheral 
literature. This is a key conceptual distinction in the methodology and discussion conducted throughout 
section 2.1. The central literature includes all records whose text actively engages with the term – for instance, 
by critically discussing it, or using it as an epistemic tool. The peripheral literature includes all records whose 
texts passively engage with the term – for instance, by marginally tackling, mentioning, or using the term as a 
‘background’ notion. Assessing each record’s degree of engagement (i.e., assessing whether a record belongs to 
the central or peripheral literature) is determined by the relative frequency value assigned for each record 
locating above (central literature) or below (peripheral literature) an arbitrarily selected value. The value 
chosen for this study was 2000, so that all records belonging to the central literature have Fn ≥ 2000, whilst 
all records belonging to the peripheral literature have Fn < 2000. This number reflects (1) a point of increase 
visualizable from the curve of all Fn values for each record (see Figure 2.10); (2) a value including all texts 
of the ‘standard literature’ in terms of relative frequency – namely, namely, Fn(Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000) 
= 2307, Fn(Crutzen, 2002) = 5800, Fn(Nature, 2003) = 5649, Fn(Steffen et al., 2007) = 2810, Fn(Zalasiewicz 
et al., 2008) = 2397, and Fn(Chakrabarty, 2009) = 2570;89 and (3) a round value of practical utility. 
 
The distinction between central and peripheral literature based on Fn should not be taken too 
literally. It is feasible that texts that substantially engaged with the term without frequently mentioning it 
may have also had a central role in shaping the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. Indeed, the qualitative analysis of the corpus (section 2.1.3) uses sample peripheral literature 
considered interesting for reasons beyond the relative frequency value of those particular records. Similarly, 
some texts may have had a propagating role due to their status in the social network of academic scholarship 
rather than their engagement with the term. Research using author-based or journal-based citation metrics 
(e.g., h-index, Journal Impact Factor, CiteScore, etc.) may easily complement the present analysis by 
showing which texts and publication platforms in particular had broader reach. 
 
Assigning a particular record to the peripheral literature does not diminish its importance in 
reconstructing the history of the ‘Anthropocene.’ On the contrary, the quantitative approach hereby 
conducted attributes outstanding value to textual sources previously unknown to Anthropocene 
scholarship. The distinction simply follows the pragmatic necessity of selecting some texts out of 670 for a 
 
89 Given their historical as well as methodological importance, Fn values for some texts (i.e., those with particular 
publishing layouts) exemplifying the ‘standard literature’ have been adjusted manually to provide more accurate Fn 
values. Fn(Crutzen, 2000) has been adjusted by copy–pasting relevant text into a Word document due to the software’s 
omission of the title in the Fo count, and because the page layout of the published text includes words from an 
unrelated article (it also excludes the bibliography from T, which was erroneously printed on page 16 of the full 
Newsletter issue; the bibliography is included in Fn). Fn(Crutzen, 2002) has also been adjusted manually due to the 
software’s misreading of two occurrences of ‘Theanthropocene’ rather than two distinct linguistic units (i.e., ‘The’ 
‘Anthropocene’). Fn(Nature, 2003) was adjusted by copy–pasting relevant text into a Word document due to the layout 
of the text, which includes words (substantially affecting T) from another distinct article published on the same page. 
Fn(Chakrabarty, 2009) gave Fo = 31 through a Ctrl-F search compared to Fo = 25 (+2 misreading of ‘Anthropocene’) 
through Voyant Tools. The disparity was adjusted accordingly.

qualitative analysis. The relative frequency approach provides the selection criteria to enforce this 
distinction. 
 
2.1.2 Exploring the Early Research Literature: A Quantitative Overlook 
 
The literature used to reconstruct the early (modern) history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept represents a 
corpus of 670 records published between 2000 and 2009. These are predominantly English texts of various 
formats and disciplinary provenance, and exhibiting different degrees of engagement with the term. The 
relative size and composition of the corpus enables a quantitative approach to retrieving relevant 
information for reconstructing the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ and of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. All 
records and their respective properties are listed in the Appendix at the end of this research. 
 
A preliminary question is whether the corpus is representative of the research material that was 
published during the decade of analysis in terms of (a) completeness and (b) content. These aspects arise from 
considering (a) the exhaustiveness of the corpus in respect to the literature using the term during the decade 
of analysis, and (b) the salient properties that make the corpus interesting (beyond the mere appearance of 
the term). Both conditions (i.e., completeness and content) need to be satisfied for the corpus to represent 
a valid pool of information. 
 
As previously explained, the corpus is a product of a cross-survey between three main databases 
and search engines for academic publications (plus Google Scholar, only partially used for cross-surveying). 
Using multiple databases ensures that the final corpus is semi-complete – that it, the corpus encompasses in 
principle all literature produced between 2000 and 2009 that is available to the public.90 This is ‘in principle’ 
because the completeness of the corpus cannot be verified (neither inductively nor deductively) with 
certainty. The corpus may have omitted literature that did not appear through search engines, especially 
since format-related restrictions are not applied (as is the case for the present approach). Furthermore, it 
might also be the case that some sources that used the term during the decade scrutinized are no longer 
available (e.g., webpages in particular91), resulting in missing records. 
 
However, it is unlikely that a significant number of records is omitted from the corpus of analysis 
such that it would not faithfully embody the early research literature, and the modern history of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ This is because (1) cross-surveying among different search engines and databases provides 
some warrants for the semi-completeness of the corpus; (2) the term had then been recently coined, 
meaning that its initial spread in literature is expected to be somewhat slow, and thus would exhibit a 
relatively low number of records per year (which is, in fact, consistent with the findings); (3) as an English-
born concept developed within a predominantly English-speaking context, it is reasonable to assume that 
 
90 Internal records (e.g., from organizations, institutions, etc.) using the term ‘Anthropocene’ are not accounted for in 
the corpus. 
91 See for instance Chakrabarty (2009), footnote 27. The original source from The Australian provided by the author is 
no longer an active link. No results are provided by searching for the article “Humans Creating New ‘Geological Age’” 
on The Australian (https://www.theaustralian.com.au/, accessed on May 27, 2021). 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
87 
 
the term did not spread faster in other languages beyond English, and thus no substantial non-English 
literature is expected to be missing; and (4) a survey of the bibliography of records (whenever available) 
does not point to any record that is not included in the corpus. Thus, if the corpus is semi-complete, then 
it exhaustively represents the (research) literature in a way that is faithful to the history of the 
‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. If so, then the (a) completeness parameter is satisfied. 
 
Intuitively, a quantitative analysis of a corpus of 670 records cannot be sustained based exclusively 
on the appearance of the term in literature. This number would be empty without considering the various 
salient properties that make this corpus interesting. These properties are analyzed through clusters as 
delineated in section 2.1.1.2. As shown in the following subsections, the selected clusters allow us to probe 
deep enough into the corpus to retrieve information of great value in understanding, on a macrolevel, the 
conceptual history of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Ultimately, this information is necessary to understand the 
context in which the Anthropocene Hypothesis came to be. If the selected clusters succeed in retrieving 
valuable information, then the selected corpus is faithful (content-wise) to the history of the concept during 
its early research stages. If so, then the (b) content parameter is satisfied. 
 
2.1.2.1 Records per Year 
 
The first property of interest for analyzing the corpus is records per year. This cluster reflects the number 
of texts published in a given year between 2000 and 2009 where the term ‘Anthropocene’ appears. Figure 
2.3 provides a visual cue and starting point for the analysis.

Figure 2.3. Graph (A) shows the number of records for the 2000–2009 decade, totaling 670 records. 
Graph (B) shows the number of results by keywording ‘Anthropocene’ (case-insensitive) between 
2010 and 2019 through the search engine Dimensions (as of September 19, 2021), totaling 63,590 
results (blue line); and the total amount of estimated records (green line). (NB: records and results are 
distinct entities that do not allow direct comparison. To compare between records during the two 
time frames, one could multiply the 2010–2019 results by a factor of 0.51 for each year, which is the 
ratio between records (670) and search results (1,311) for the 2000–2009 decade (via Dimensions.ai), 
and an estimate of ~32,431 records for the 2010–2019 decade. This is a practical solution to what 
would otherwise require surveying 63,590 total results from Dimensions.ai only). 
 
 
The initial frequency of the word across literature in relation to time was low if compared both to similar 
studies on the lifecycle and propagation of neologisms (Altmann et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2021),92 and to the 
late spread of the term during the 2010–2019 decade (Figure 2.3B). In fact, the term only propagates slowly 
in academic discourses, reaching more than 100 records per year only by 2008. It was only after 2009 – 
coinciding with the establishment of the AWG, and the publication of Chakrabarty’s (2009) seminal paper 
– that the ‘Anthropocene’ really witnessed a surge in interest across media outlets and diverse fields of 
academic inquiry. To place it in perspective: the totality of records representing the 2000–2009 literature 
amounts to 670. For the 2010–2019 decade, a (conservative) minimum of ~32,000 records are estimated. 
These sheer numbers suggest that the term did not immediately resonate across research communities, but 
took around ten years before it began to substantially appear in academic literature and other non-academic 
sources. If higher records and/or results implies higher interest (either positive or negative) among 
 
92 These studies should only be considered as inspirational for the present purposes. Comparisons with quantitative 
analysis of corpora for Internet neologisms are intuitively not one and the same as studies on the birth and evolution 
of scientific ideas.

epistemic actors, then publications per year provides a faithful proxy for assessing yearly increase (or 
decrease, e.g., between 2014 and 2015) in interest in the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
Many combined forces may have contributed to the post-2009 increase in interest, in addition to 
the formation of the AWG and the publication of Chakrabarty (2009). Reasonably, a central force was the 
transformation of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept into a vector and hub for environmental discourses. In the 
last decade, the inclusion of environmental-oriented humanities and social sciences into the shaping of 
Anthropocene Studies has mutated the term from a descriptive category within a primary matrix of Earth 
System science and the geosciences to a normative category. The term has been placed at the forefront of 
environmental agendas promoted by think tanks, environmental movements, research institutions, and 
international organizations, all of which have seen the ‘Anthropocene’ as a communicative means for 
change. 
 
The original slow propagation of the term may have been due to the restricted academic niche 
where the term saw initial spread. Crutzen’s status as a Nobel laureate as well as one of the most-cited 
scientists by the 2000s (Schwägerl, 2014) was a central factor in the early survival as well as the later success 
of the ‘Anthropocene.’ However, the term remained a neologism of a technical nature and restricted to a 
specific circle of disciplines, organizations, and epistemic actors during its first years of existence. Crutzen’s 
influence remained limited to disseminating the term primarily within the Earth System science community, 
whilst the term only sporadically appeared in neighboring disciplines. Although the term has always had an 
implicit normative overtone (see Dalby, 2016), it was only after the humanities and social sciences began a 
systematic engagement with the term that it transformed into a broader category for environmental 
communication and change. Prior to this ‘environmental turn,’ the term had been used primarily in the 
geosciences and Earth System science as an informal time designation marking the dawn of global-scale 
anthropogenic impact on the Earth System. The ‘Anthropocene’ mirrored global change, and “[t]he extent 
to which human activities are influencing or even dominating many aspects of Earth’s environment and its 
functioning” (Steffen et al., 2004c, p. 14). 
 
Records per year is a useful property for dissecting the corpus, providing a snapshot of the spread 
of the term over time. However, it should be noted that records per year does not account for the time 
difference between the writing, submission, and publication of a record. Academic publishing is a process 
that may vary from months to several years, depending on a series of factors such as format, the publisher’s 
editorial timeframe, the peer-review process, and more. For instance, a record published in 2006 may have 
been submitted for publication in 2003, meaning that three years elapsed between submitting the 
manuscript and publishing that given record. Records per year is a value indicative solely of the number of 
records published in a given year, and not those submitted. Therefore, records per year as a time-sensitive 
proxy for the spread of the term is necessarily lagged, meaning that it cannot represent the exact timing of 
the spread of the term. While this does not represent an obstacle for the methodology hereby developed, 
it is important to stress the purpose and function of records per year as a meaningful property of the corpus.

2.1.2.2 Records per Field of Knowledge 
 
Another interesting property for dissecting the corpus is records per field of knowledge – that is, what fields 
of knowledge mostly characterize the corpus. As outlined in the methodology section, records may be 
assigned one or more fields of knowledge (i.e., applied sciences, formal sciences, humanities, natural 
sciences, social sciences) depending on the particular disciplines it is assigned. This means that field of 
knowledge is a derivative property – that is, it is assigned only after a record is assigned a property, and as a 
consequence of the discipline assigned.  
 
 
 
Figure 2.4. Number of records for each field of knowledge (in blue). To exemplify: 233 occurrences 
of ‘social sciences’ means that there are 233 records labelled as social sciences, although some of these 
records may also be labelled as natural sciences, applied sciences, or humanities if their respective 
disciplines fall within other fields of knowledge. 
 
 
Figure 2.4 shows the total number of records per field of knowledge. High occurrence of records in a 
particular field of knowledge implies high reception of the term ‘Anthropocene’ within that knowledge 
domain. 
 
A central characteristic of the early history of the ‘Anthropocene’ is that the literature implementing 
the term mostly stemmed from the natural sciences. Out of the 670 records composing the corpus, 483 
records are recognized (at least) as natural sciences records. This represents almost three-quarters (72.1%) 
of the corpus. The second highest occurring field of knowledge is the social sciences, with 233 records 
recognized within this knowledge domain (34.8%), followed by the applied sciences with 46 records (6.8%)

and the humanities with 34 records (5.1%). No record was assigned a discipline representing the formal 
sciences (e.g., mathematics, logic, programming, AI, etc.). Presumably, this is because the concept was either 
irrelevant to the communities representing this particular knowledge domain, or its reach simply did not 
extend enough during the term’s early stages. 
 
The predominance of the natural sciences as primary field of knowledge can be correlated to the 
seminal influences of the original birthplace of the ‘Anthropocene’ – that is, the International Geosphere-
Biosphere Programme (IGBP), and the Earth System science community (see section 1.2.2). The IGBP 
was a research program that ran from 1987 to 2015. Its primary research focus was the study of the Earth 
System and its interaction with human systems with the intention “to provide essential scientific leadership 
and knowledge of the Earth system to help guide society onto a sustainable pathway during rapid global 
change” (IGBP, 2015a, para. 1). The IGBP connected researchers of different scientific provenance, from 
geoscientists, oceanographers, and marine scientists to chemists, atmospheric scientists, climatologists, and 
more. This science-oriented context was crucial in defining the early identity of the ‘Anthropocene.’ It was 
during a scientific committee meeting of the IGBP that Crutzen famously coined the term, and through 
scientific outlets (e.g., Nature, the IGBP Newsletter, Science, Scientia Marina, geosciences journals, etc.) that the 
term began to gradually appear and spread via publications authored predominantly by natural scientists. The 
prevalence of the natural sciences in characterizing the ‘Anthropocene’ early research literature is 
paramount in understanding the premises engendering the evolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ into the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. Indeed, the ‘Anthropocene’ concept was already embedded into a scientific 
context which invested it with an original scientific connotation – in addition to its scientific utility (a point 
later discussed in section 2.2.1). Arguably, the absence of this preliminary condition would not have equally 
prompted the formation of a research group (i.e., the AWG) and the hypothesis it has been promoting 
since 2009. This is also confirmed by the fact that a similar term proposed by Andrew Revkin in 1992 – the 
“Anthrocene” (Revkin, 1992) – did not equally resonate across scientific communities.93 
 
The IGBP (and the Earth System science community) was not exclusively concerned with the 
science behind the functioning of the Earth System. Its aim was to provide leadership and knowledge for 
the benefit of society overall in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System. This 
aim required the research program to include scholars from the social sciences and the humanities into the 
conversation. This is presumably a central reason behind the social sciences characterizing roughly a third 
(233) of all records of the corpus. This literature pioneered early social science approaches to the 
‘Anthropocene,’ engendering later research trajectories regarding the utility and meaning of the concept in 
the broader public discourse on the human–environment relationship. This was particularly vivid in 
literature linking the term with central questions of sustainability and global change that informed much of 
the environmentally oriented scholarship from the social sciences. Beside the pioneering role of the IGBP, 
the term ‘Anthropocene’ had a very early conceptual link with historical questions concerning the beginning 
 
93 Other factors may have played a role in the lack of spread of the ‘Anthrocene,’ including Crutzen’s higher academic 
prestige as a Nobel laureate and often-cited scientist, the proliferation of media outlets by the early 2000s, and the 
reach in relation to the publication format where the term appeared. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
92 
 
of the epoch. Historical periods such as the Industrial Revolution or the Great Acceleration were structural 
aspects in shaping the semantic identity of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept during its early research stages.  
 
Only a small portion (34) of the records fall under the humanities – a value lower (albeit marginally) 
than the applied sciences (46), which include fields such as engineering and resource management. 
Systematic engagement from humanistic disciplines only occurred after the term acquired broader 
popularity, during the second decade of the term’s existence. The humanities brought critical perspectives 
on the connotations and rhetoric of the ‘Anthropocene.’ This type of criticism was generally absent during 
the early research phase of the concept since the term had also yet to develop a ‘narrative’ clear and distinct 
enough to be an object of criticism. 
 
As stated, records composing the corpus may belong to one or more fields of knowledge. A record 
whose disciplinary provenance entails two or more fields of knowledge is considered a multi-domain record, 
whereas a record with one or more disciplines within the same field of knowledge is defined as a single-
domain record. Consequently, records can either be multi-domain or single-domain, but not both. Figure 
2.5 illustrates how single-domain and multi-domain records compose the corpus. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.5. Percentage distribution of the corpus based on single-domain records and multi-domain 
records. 
 
 
Dividing the corpus into single-domain and multi-domain records is a quantitative proxy to assess to what 
extent the ‘Anthropocene’ spread and evolved across fields of knowledge. Findings show that most records 
fall within the natural sciences, followed by social sciences, applied sciences, and humanities. Most records

(546) appear to be characterized by one of these domains rather than multiples – the latter representing 
almost a fifth (124 records) of the corpus. It is hard to assess whether these numbers provide any insight 
into the multi-domain nature of the ‘Anthropocene’ without a measure of comparison. Nevertheless, the 
chart above seems to suggest that most records engaged with the concept within the limits of their 
respective field of knowledge. This is not to say that the term did not have a multidisciplinary matrix, since 
multi-domain is not equal to multidisciplinarity – as previously stated. Presumably, the fact that most 
records are single-domain can be correlated to the large majority of records being from the natural sciences. 
If the term was a scientific neologism, then it is expected that the natural sciences were primarily (and 
individually) using the term without the necessity of multi-domain interaction. 
 
Dissecting the literature through fields of knowledge reveals that the natural sciences was the 
primary field of knowledge where the term ‘Anthropocene’ spread and construed its identity. This is an 
important finding because it tells that the ‘Anthropocene’ was coined within a scientific context, and its 
early history could be treated as the history of a scientific concept. Ultimately, this is an important step in 
reconstructing the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as the stratigraphic ‘variant’ of the broader 
‘Anthropocene’ object. The absence of the humanities as a field of knowledge substantially engaging with 
the term reflects the absence of that trademark critical thinking that distinguishes humanistic disciplines. 
This is consistent with the fact that the ‘Anthropocene’ concept and discourse was mostly unproblematic 
during its early history. Debate over the meaning, discourse, and hidden nuances of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
only began to appear systematically after 2009, when the term began to spread at a more rapid pace across 
fields of knowledge.

2.1.2.3 Records per Discipline 
 
Records per field of knowledge provides a coarse-grained proxy to assess what fields of knowledge most 
engaged with the term ‘Anthropocene’ during its early history. A finer-grain analysis is provided by records 
per discipline. Thirty-nine disciplines were identified according to the criteria defined in section 2.1.1.2. 
Figure 2.6 shows the number of records retrieved for each discipline.

followed the criteria delineated in section 2.1.1.2. Each color represents the field of knowledge each 
discipline belongs to (green for natural sciences, blue for social sciences, red for applied sciences, and 
orange for humanities; no records were retrieved for the formal sciences). 
 
 
Findings based on records per discipline are consistent with those related to records per field of knowledge, 
in that the disciplines with highest records value fall within the natural sciences – with the exception of

environmental studies (82), which is considered a social science. At the top end of the natural sciences, 
geology represents the discipline with the highest number of records (99),94 followed by Earth System 
science (87), oceanography (76), climatology (71), ecology (61), and environmental science (52). At the 
bottom end, Arctic studies (5) and astronomy (1) have the lowest records value among the natural sciences.  
 
Visibly, none of the disciplines with high records value stands out in terms of being exceedingly 
predominant (i.e., having double or triple the records of a following or preceding discipline). Indeed, 
geology precedes Earth System science only by a margin of twelve records. This means that no discipline 
was either predominantly or single-handedly using the ‘Anthropocene’ concept in a way indicating that the 
term belonged to a specific disciplinary domain. On the contrary, findings suggest that the concept was 
shared among a spectrum of scientific disciplines that used it interchangeably, and as an informal concept 
(as later discussed in section 2.1.2.6). This is further confirmed by the fact that ‘geology’ represents a pool 
of different subdiscipline (e.g., Quaternary science, Holocene science, historical geology, geomorphology, 
etc.), meaning that the term did not belong to a specialized disciplinary domain, but was a shared boundary 
object across the natural sciences – particularly the geosciences. 
 
This is an important finding: it tells that, while the ‘Anthropocene’ was mostly a scientific 
idea/neologism, it was not confined to a discipline-based area, and thus to a delimited epistemic use. While 
Earth System science has often been portrayed as the conceptual cradle of the ‘Anthropocene’ (e.g., Steffen, 
2021; Steffen et al., 2011a; Steffen et al., 2020; Zalasiewicz et al., 2021), and therefore as the original 
disciplinary domain of the term, early research literature is mostly characterized by a variety of scientific 
disciplines engaging with the concept. This is not to say that the Earth System science community did not 
play a key role in engendering future discussions on the Anthropocene. Indeed, it is exactly the 
multidisciplinary nature of Earth System science that allowed the term not to become technical jargon 
restricted to a single disciplinary domain. Nevertheless, a quantitative outlook based on records per 
discipline shows that Earth System science did not stand out as the discipline that most engaged with the 
term. 
 
In fact, geology is the discipline exhibiting the highest number of records. Feasibly, two major 
reasons behind geology being the top-ranked discipline are attributable to the nature of the word itself, 
whose suffix ‘-cene’ immediately distinguishes its geochronological denotation, and whose geological 
connotation was originally given to it when it was first formulated in a published medium.95 These are 
perhaps more relevant reasons (although not sufficient, as later explained in section 2.2.1) than the source 
where the term originally appeared (the IGBP Newsletter), or the authors’ provenance (Paul Crutzen, a 
chemist, and Eugene Stoermer, a marine biologist). From a quantitative viewpoint, it seems reasonable to 
 
94 Under ‘geology’ are grouped records that could also be represented under ‘Earth science’ or ‘geosciences.’ The 
terminological choice is only pragmatic. 
95 Crutzen and Stoermer (2000) wrote: “Considering these and many other major and still growing impacts of human 
activities on earth and atmosphere, and at all, including global, scales, it seems to us more than appropriate to 
emphasize the central role of mankind in geology and ecology by proposing to use the term ‘anthropocene’ for the 
current geological epoch” (p. 17). While the proposal was unofficial and informal, it represents the very first instance 
where the modern ‘Anthropocene’ is thought of as a possible geological epoch. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
96 
 
correlate the number of geology records with the interest that geologists and stratigraphers developed, by 
the later part of the decade, in the ‘Anthropocene’ as a possible geological time unit (Zalasiewicz et al., 
2018; Zalasiewicz et al., 2008b). If the relative number of records means relative interest (either positive or 
negative) in the term within a specific disciplinary domain, then the pre-existence of a discrete body of 
geological literature implementing the term may be interpreted as a historical precondition for the 
development of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. One could infer that if early research literature was not 
characterized by geology records, the ‘Anthropocene’ might not have resonated among geologists, and the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis would not have developed to its current state (or not developed at all) – although 
such counterfactual reasoning is purely speculative. The reception of the ‘Anthropocene’ in geological 
literature is considered an important ingredient for the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and is 
separately discussed in section 2.2.1.  
 
Records values for disciplines within the social sciences provide further interesting insights. 
Environmental studies (82) stands as the highest occurring discipline among records in the social sciences, 
followed by sustainability studies (41), human geography (27), history (26), sociology (24), and political 
science (23). At the bottom end, anthropology (7), psychology (2), archaeology (2), and gender studies (1) 
have the lowest records values among the social sciences. 
 
Unlike geology in the natural sciences, records in environmental studies stand out from other 
disciplines in the social sciences with more than twice the records of the second-highest–ranking discipline 
(sustainability studies).96 The reverse argument applies here: whereas the ‘Anthropocene’ in early research 
literature was somewhat equally shared among those disciplines most engaging with the term, the 
‘Anthropocene’ was primarily an object of interest of environmental studies among the social sciences. This 
is an interesting finding because it suggests that the term had already begun to be used for framing socially 
oriented environmental narratives portraying the present human–environment relationship. The term was 
more than technical jargon of a geological provenance: it was a conceptual tool to understand the temporal 
and spatial scale of anthropogenic modifications of the Earth. 
 
Findings related to the social sciences are particularly interesting for two disciplines – namely, 
history and archaeology. Notably, the records value for history (26) is relatively low. This may seem 
surprising, given the central role that history has played in forging a historical conception of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ and in advancing arguments against the seemingly ahistorical nature of the scientific 
‘Anthropocene’ (see section 1.2.3 and 5.1.3). The main historical impulse began after Chakrabarty’s (2009) 
seminal paper, which ignited interest in the ‘Anthropocene’ among environmental historians. Prior to that, 
focused historical contributions to the ‘Anthropocene’ were only limited, and the term only appeared 
sporadically, although with discernible relative engagement across historical literature (as later discussed in 
 
96 It is not easy to define environmental studies as a discrete discipline, mostly because its inter- and multidisciplinary 
nature encompasses a range of disciplines within and outside the social sciences. As a pragmatic choice, this discipline 
was defined to include all texts whose content explicitly address one or more aspects of the human–environment 
relationship (in a strict sense) – in addition to the criteria defined in section 2.1.1.2. In these terms, environmental 
studies differs from sustainability studies (a seemingly overlapping discipline) because its primary object of interest is 
not necessarily sustainability per se. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
97 
 
section 2.1.2.6). A remarkably low records value occurs for archaeology, with only two records appearing 
in the corpus. Archaeology has been a central discipline in post-2009 debates on the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, and has provided evidence for and against the formal recognition of the Anthropocene as a 
geological time unit (see section 3.1.3 and 5.2.2). However, it seems that the term did not resonate within 
archaeological research during the early history of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
Resource management (17) and engineering (13) have the highest records values among the applied 
sciences, representing almost two-thirds of the total records in their field of knowledge. Geoengineering – 
a discipline at the center stage of many extant debates on climate solutions (see Anshelm & Hansson, 2014; 
Vaughan & Lenton, 2011) – has a records value of only five, hinting that the ‘Anthropocene’ debate did 
not initially resonate within this specific discourse on mitigations of anthropogenic climate change. 
Nevertheless, the existence of a portion of literature from resource management and engineering hints that 
technically oriented solutions to anthropogenic environmental pressures were already considering the term 
as a valid reference framework for describing the present human–environment relationship. The term was 
not technical term exclusively restricted to the natural sciences: it denotated a state of affairs requiring 
practical solutions from the applied sciences too. Illustrative of the ‘practical’ dimension of the 
‘Anthropocene’ is the fact that, despite having only a handful of records, applied sciences such as medicine 
(4) and psychiatry (2) also took marginal note of the existence of this term. 
 
Lastly, an interesting finding is the remarkably low records value for disciplines in the humanities. 
Ecocriticism (12) and philosophy (12) are the top-ranked disciplines in their field of knowledge, followed 
by law (5), linguistics (1), and landscape architecture (1). Notably, the records value for disciplines with 
most records in the humanities (i.e., ecocriticism and philosophy) is extremely low when compared to the 
records value for disciplines in other fields of knowledge (except formal sciences). While this is only 
marginal compared to applied science (12 versus 17 records from resource management), it is substantial 
when compared to the social sciences (12 versus 82 records from environmental studies) and the natural 
sciences (12 versus 99 from geology). Especially compared to the latter, all the disciplines in the natural 
sciences except for Arctic studies (5) and astronomy (1) have higher records values than 
ecocriticism/philosophy. 
 
Two observations can be deduced from these findings. First, the fact that precisely ecocriticism and 
philosophy have the highest records values in the humanities signals an early interest in the term as a category 
of environmental, philosophical, and literary interest. Whilst philosophy of science has remained largely 
oblivious to both the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis, philosophical questions of an 
ethical drive (e.g., Raffnsøe, 2016; Schmidt et al., 2016; Zylinska, 2014) have been central in the post-2009 
‘Anthropocene’ debate. Equally, insights from ecocriticism have been crucial in critically dissecting the 
rhetoric of the ‘Anthropocene’ portrayed by the natural sciences (e.g., Clark, 2015; Crist, 2013; Merchant, 
2021; Neimanis et al., 2015). A second connected reason is that the absence of a substantial body of early 
humanistic literature mirrors the absence of that critical inquiry that typically distinguishes humanistic 
disciplines – philosophy in particular. This implies that, during the early research phase, the term 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
98 
 
‘Anthropocene’ was largely unproblematized – meaning that questions about its rhetoric, assumptions, 
discourses, and implications were yet to be raised.97 
 
Findings related to records per discipline are interesting because they are indicative of which 
disciplines most engaged with the ‘Anthropocene’ across fields of knowledge in terms of total numbers of 
records. This information can be used as additional proxy to reconstruct the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
based on the disciplinary trajectory undertaken by the term, anticipating many of the extant research hubs 
gravitating around it. Most importantly for the present research, the fact that geology represents the 
discipline with the highest records signals early interest in and use of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a geologically 
useful term. As discussed in section 2.2, this is a key factor in the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
 
Lastly, another interesting finding concerns the multidisciplinary origins of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept. The methodology outlined in section 2.1.1 allows records to represent one or more disciplines 
depending on several factors. Records representing one or more disciplines are considered multidisciplinary 
records. Conversely, records representing only one discipline are considered disciplinary records. Figure 2.7 
illustrates the division of the corpus based on multidisciplinarity and disciplinarity. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.7. Division of the corpus based on multidisciplinary and disciplinary records. 
 
 
 
97 This aspect could also be attributed to the term’s novelty, as it required time to develop identifiable narratives and 
discernible underlying assumptions.

The pie chart above shows that the records are almost equally divided between multidisciplinary and 
disciplinary records – the latter being higher by only a small margin. Whilst the concept was predominantly 
a single-domain one (see section 2.1.2.2), the ‘Anthropocene’ was multidisciplinary almost as equally as it 
was discipline based. First, this finding corroborates the idea that the term originally had a multidisciplinary 
impetus. While maintaining domain-specific applications, the term was not restricted to a single discipline. 
Second, this finding suggests that, if the natural sciences were the predominant field of knowledge engaging 
with the term, then it was primarily disciplines within the natural sciences that exhibited forms of 
multidisciplinarity. 
 
2.1.2.4 Records per Format 
 
Records differ in terms of publishing format. This is an interesting aspect of the corpus to analyze because 
it indicates which published mediums the ‘Anthropocene’ navigated as a concept during its early research 
phase, and which mediums most characterized its spread. Figure 2.8 illustrates the corpus divided by the 
formats.

Findings show that the primary textual format propagating the ‘Anthropocene’ was journal article (411), 
representing almost two-thirds of the overall corpus, followed by book section (108), book (37), book 
review (36), and abstract (25).98 Minor formats included conference proceedings (17), conference papers 
(9), encyclopedias (7), newspaper articles (7), and other formats with negligible records values. 
 
Journals have played a central role in academia since their beginning in the 17th century (Tenopir 
et al., 2011). With the advent of the World Wide Web, e-journals have proliferated, making access to 
resources and knowledge much easier than ever before. Today, academics spend an increasing amount of 
time reading journal articles,99 and “[o]ver a million articles are published each year in over twenty thousand 
peer reviewed journals” (p. 19) – making journal articles crucial to write and cite across all disciplines for 
“writing grant proposals, grant reports, and articles” (p. 4). Journals articles may be considered the primary 
medium of academic communication – considering also that they require less time to write (for the authors) 
and read (for the readers) than books. This enables ideas propagated mostly through journal articles to have 
higher reach (and impact) than those relying on other mediums, such as books, conference papers, etc. In 
turn, this means that if the ‘Anthropocene’ managed to spread widely during its early research stage, it is 
because its medium was primarily that of journal articles. Indeed, this is also confirmed by the high 
bibliometrics score of early journal articles such as Crutzen and Stoermer (2000), Sanderson et al. (2002), 
Crutzen (2002d),100 or Sabine et al. (2004). Combined with the fact that no discipline was overwhelmingly 
predominant in using the concept, it is reasonable to conclude that journal articles diversified across 
disciplines (especially natural sciences), enabling the concept to roam around different fields of knowledge, 
and thus to survive as a neologism and scientific idea. 
 
Books, book sections, and book reviews of an academic nature played a secondary role in 
propagating the concept of the ‘Anthropocene’ during its early stages. Together, these comprise 27.2% of 
the corpus – slightly more than a quarter of all records. It is hard to overstate the importance of books as 
a cultural, religious, academic, social, and political medium in the history of the human enterprise. However, 
recent scholarship has begun reconsidering the status of printed books in the era of digital electronic 
mediums (Chu et al., 2004; Noam, 1998; Seiler, 1992). While book publishing is often an academic 
requirement in academic career paths, it is intuitively a more time-consuming task for scholars who write 
and read books, and often necessitates hard-to-obtain funding to support a lengthy writing process.  
 
Other literary mediums that aided the propagation of the term in academia are related to 
conferences – either proceedings or presentations. Conferences are important and resourceful mediums for 
oral transmission of ideas in the academic world. Tracking the oral transmission of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
 
98 The majority of abstracts present in the corpus are abstracts for presentations or posters held for annual American 
Geophysical Union (AGU) Meetings. Some of these abstracts are discussed in section 2.1.3. 
99 For dedicated literature on the impact and importance of e-articles and journal publishing, see the work of Carol 
Tenopir and Donald W. King. 
100 For instance, bibliometric information regarding Crutzen (2002) is tracked through the Altmetric Attention Score, 
which is a metrics that “provides an indicator of the amount of attention that it [an article] has received. The score is 
derived from an automated algorithm, and represents a weighted count of the amount of attention we’ve picked up 
for a research output” (https://nature.altmetric.com/details/101691537, “About this Attention Score,” accessed on 
June 13, 2021). 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE

across epistemic actors requires a different methodological setting than analyzing textual sources. 
Nevertheless, the existence of papers, abstracts, and proceedings associated with conferences witnesses the 
existence of additional, unpublished mediums that aided the survival, propagation, and evolution of the 
‘Anthropocene’ as a scientific and academic idea. 
 
2.1.2.5 Records per Language 
 
A fifth property of interest is the language of records. This property can be interpreted in terms of the 
geographical reach of the term as well as the primary linguistic framework wherein the concept took shape. 
Records per language are illustrated in Figure 2.9. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.9. Pie chart showing the distribution of records per language. Six languages were identified 
using the term ‘Anthropocene’ (or an equivalent linguistic expression) during the 2000–2009 decade. 
Numbers in brackets represent the records for each language, while percentage expresses the records 
in respect to the entire corpus. 
 
 
As anticipated in section 2.1.1.1, three factors determined the predominantly English-language matrix of 
the corpus analyzed – namely, the English provenance of databases and search engines used for step 1; the 
status of the English language as the language of international communication; and the anglophone nature 
of both the original context and coinage of the term ‘Anthropocene.’ Combined, these three factors are 
sufficient to explain the huge disparity between English-written records (637), amounting to 95.1% of the

corpus, and non-English records (33), amounting to only 4.9%. These numbers cast no doubts that, while 
the corpus does not exhaust nor summarize the non-English literature produced during the 2000–2009 
decade, the ‘Anthropocene’ is an English-born, and English-based concept. 
 
A first interesting finding is which non-English literature received the term. French and German 
literature have the highest values for records per language among non-English records. This witnesses an 
early interest in the term for both linguistic contexts which developed into different local initiatives. For 
instance, in the case of Germany, this interest was cultivated through the years through the production of 
museum exhibitions such as Welcome to the Anthropocene, held at the Deutsches Museum between 2014 and 
2016, and the joint Haus der Kulturen der Welt – Max Planck Institute for the History for Science initiative 
Anthropocene Curriculum (see also section 1.1.1). This is indicative of the term’s reach beyond the anglophone 
intellectual landscape, foreshadowing a growing interest in the ‘Anthropocene’ as an object and 
phenomenon of global as well as local interest. 
 
Another interesting finding related to records per language is the presence of non–Indo-European 
languages – that is, Japanese and Chinese. This shows the geographical reach of the term which, while 
predominantly spreading in literature in English, was received in Japanese and Chinese literature alike. This 
aspect is further tackled in section 2.1.3, where the texts themselves are analyzed. 
 
Dissecting the corpus through language is only a minor property analyzed. Reasonably, tracing the 
reception and assimilation of the ‘Anthropocene’ among specific national academic cultures would require 
different criteria from those delineated in this research. Furthermore, the fact that the majority of records 
are in English does not imply that their reach did not extend beyond the anglophone world. A large portion 
of non-native English-speaking authors published material in English that was circulated among country-
specific communities – most notably Germany and Sweden (where the IGBP Secretariat resided). It is very 
likely that non-native English-speaking authors approaching the ‘Anthropocene’ were an important factor 
in the geographical spread of the term, and in introducing the concept to their respective academic cultures. 
 
2.1.2.6 Central and Peripheral Literature 
 
A central property of interest regarding the corpus is the relative frequency (Fn) of the term ‘Anthropocene’ 
in the texts analyzed. This property reflects each record’s particular engagement with the term. Each record 
has a Fn value that determines whether it belongs to the ‘central’ or ‘peripheral’ literature. For a record to 
belong to one or the other supercluster depends on whether Fn < 2000 or Fn ≥ 2000. The selection of this 
threshold value has been justified in section 2.1.1.3. Figure 2.10 shows the curve (blue line) showing all 
records composing the corpus in terms of their Fn value. Records with Fn ≥ 2000 (i.e., central literature) are 
interpreted as records whose texts exhibit high engagement with the term, whilst records with Fn < 2000 
(i.e., peripheral literature) are interpreted as records whose texts exhibit low engagement with the term. 
 
 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
103 
 
 
Figure 2.10. Graph showing the corpus of analysis based on Fn (normalized or relative frequency). 
The blue line represents all values for each record of the corpus. The dashed green line represents 
the arbitrarily selected threshold value, which distinguishes between central (light green) and 
peripheral (light blue) literature. The total records for the central literature are 83, whilst the total 
records for the peripheral literature are 587. 
 
 
The graph above shows that the vast majority (87.6%) of records belong to the peripheral literature (587), 
whilst only 12.4% of records belong to the central literature (83). These initial values suggest that the term 
was mostly ‘passively’ received across early research literature. Only a reduced amount of text engaged with 
the term ‘Anthropocene’ in an ‘active’ way – that is, by exploring its semantics or using it systematically. 
While these numbers would require a measure of comparison (e.g., with the spread of other scientific or 
academic ideas), it is reasonable to consider the spread of the ‘Anthropocene’ to diffuse following this 
pattern – namely, appearing predominantly in literature with less direct engagement with the term rather 
than higher engagement. Presumably, this is because peripheral literature ‘grounds’ upon central literature 
which provides the concept with an initial, plastic identity; and because not every record’s author(s) is either 
requested or willing to probe into semantic analysis of the term. The latter point is also corroborated by the 
later history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept (i.e., 2010–2019) – witnessing a rise in articles and books with 
‘Anthropocene’ in the title but not necessarily reflecting the analysis of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept as the 
primary object of inquiry.101 
 
101 It should be noted that this is not a form of criticism. Rather, it is a common practice in academic scholarship to 
borrow keyword terms with certain popularity to increase visibility, or to simply frame the context of a given research 
or subject matter. This is also consistent with the vast semantic reach and popularity that the ‘Anthropocene’ concept 
has acquired over the last decade.

Values related to central and peripheral literature are coarse-grained, and serve to define from a 
macro-perspective which records exhibit a high Fn value (and thus higher engagement) above or below the 
selected threshold value. This is of particular importance for selecting and analyzing literature for the 
qualitative analysis as well as for framing the literature in terms of total engagement. A more insightful 
property can be derived by integrating values from records per discipline to obtain the normalized engagement 
factor per discipline (En(D)). This is an informative property because it tells which disciplines mostly engaged 
with the concept not solely in terms of sheer numbers of records, but also in terms of the relative number 
of records with Fn ≥ 2000 (i.e., belonging to the central literature) per discipline. This is because disciplines 
with high records values are not necessarily disciplines whose records exhibit a noticeable engagement with 
the term. For instance, the fact that environmental studies has higher records per discipline value (82) than 
environmental science (52) does neither entail that it has the highest observed engagement factor (Eo(D)) nor 
that it has the highest En(D). In other words, En(D) tells which disciplines have the most records whose 
texts exhibit high engagement; or, simplified, which disciplines are most representative of the central 
literature.  
 
To retrieve the normalized engagement factor for each discipline, the following formula can be 
applied: 
 
𝐸𝑛(𝐷) = 𝐸𝑜(𝐷) 10
𝑅(𝐷) 
 
Where R(D) is the records per discipline value (defined for each discipline in section 2.1.2.3).102 For 
instance, En(D) for geology is 2.12, derived from an observed engagement (Eo(D)) of 21,103 and from a 
records value (R(D)) of 99. By applying the formula above to all thirty-nine disciplines composing the 
corpus, their respective En(D) values can be retrieved. The following table lists the obtained values. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
102 The formula is mathematically similar to the normative frequency formula described in section 2.1.1.3, but it should 
not be confused with it. The latter concerns the normative frequency of a word among texts of different sizes, whilst 
the normalized engagement factor per discipline concerns the frequency of a record with a specific normalized 
frequency value (i.e., ≥ 2000) among disciplines. 
103 The value 21 represents the number of ‘geology’ records with Fn ≥ 2000 (see Appendix).

discipline (Eo(D)), and normalized engagement factor per discipline (En(D)) for each of the disciplines 
representing the corpus. Values highlighted in bold black are disciplines with En(D) ≥ 1.00, whereas 
values highlighted in bold red are disciplines with En(D) ≥ 1.00 and R(D) ≤ 20. (NB: because a record 
may belong to more than one discipline, the sum of all Eo(D) (i.e., 119) is not equal to the number of 
records recognized as central literature (i.e., 83). This also implies that Eo(D) may include the same 
record with En ≥ 2000 for different disciplines. However, what appears as double counting does not 
constitute a fallacy because En(D) is retrieved for each discipline, and the same record is not counted 
twice for retrieving single En(D) values). 
 
 
 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
106 
 
Two arbitrarily defined parameters were set to consider any given En(D) value significant:  
 
p1. R(D) value must be ≥ 20. 
p2. En(D) value must be ≥ 1.00.104 
 
Disciplines with En(D) values highlighted in red do not satisfy p1 because their R(D) is too low for their 
En(D) value to be considered representative of the central literature. For instance, landscape architecture 
(En(D) = 10.00) and linguistics (En(D) = 10.00) both have the highest normalized engagement value among 
disciplines by an outstanding margin. However, both disciplines have only one record in the entire corpus 
(i.e., R(D) = 1). Hence, they cannot be considered faithful representatives of the central literature. Similarly, 
philosophy (En(D) = 2.50) and ecocriticism (En(D) = 3.33) have higher En(D) value than disciplines such 
as geology (En(D) = 2.12) or Earth System science (En(D) = 1.72), but their respective R(D) value (12) is 
too low according to p1. While these disciplines represent a valuable aspect of the corpus and of the early 
disciplinary engagement with the ‘Anthropocene,’ they cannot be used to epitomize the central literature 
because they exhibit low normalized engagement with the term.105 
 
Disciplines neither highlighted in red nor in bold in Figure 2.11 do not satisfy p2, meaning that 
their En(D) is too low for the discipline to be considered representative of the central literature. For 
instance, atmospheric science has an En(D) value of 0.00. This means that no records in atmospheric science 
belong to the central literature, and thus the discipline is not representative of the central literature at all – 
despite satisfying p1. Similarly, biology satisfies p1 because R(D) = 36, but it only has two records with En 
value ≥ 2000, resulting in En(D) < 1.00. This means that neither atmospheric science nor biology can be 
considered among those disciplines most engaging with the ‘Anthropocene’ concept during its early 
research stage. 
 
Ten disciplines satisfy both p1 and p2 – namely, geology (En(D) = 2.12), Earth System science 
(En(D) = 1.72), environmental science ((En(D) = 1.54), soil science (En(D) = 1.43), chemistry (En(D) = 
1.36), political science (En(D) = 1.30), oceanography (En(D) = 1.18), history (En(D) = 1.15), climatology 
(En(D) = 1.13), and human geography (En(D) = 1.11). The fact that geology represents the discipline with 
the highest normalized engagement factor supports the findings concerning records per discipline 
highlighted in section 2.1.2.3. Geology was not solely the discipline that saw most engagement with the 
‘Anthropocene’ in terms of total records implementing the term, but also in terms of the relative number 
of records actively engaging with it. This is an important insight because, as previously noted, a high R(D) 
value does not necessarily imply a high En(D) value. Such a finding can be considered as another 
 
104 The value R(D) = 20 for p1 is based on lowering the mean average of the sum of all records per disciplines 
(approximately 24.7). Similarly, the value En(D) ≥ 1.00 is retrieved through lowering the mean average of the sum of 
all En(D) values (approximately 1.5). Lowering the value in both instances is a conservative approach to allow more 
disciplines to be considered as representative of the central literature. 
105 It should be noted that this parameter does not say that the texts per se have little engagement with the term. The 
parameter only applies to disciplines rather than the particular engagement that a text exhibits. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
107 
 
precondition for the subsequent evolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ into a discrete scientific hypothesis 
developed by a dedicated research group (i.e., the AWG). 
 
Findings concerning the relative engagement factor are also consistent with the scientific origins 
of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept so far highlighted. Natural sciences have the highest records per field of 
knowledge, meaning that most early literature using the term ‘Anthropocene’ spurred from the natural 
sciences. This is an early sign that the ‘Anthropocene’ was primarily (although not exclusively) a scientific 
neologism and idea. Records per discipline (section 2.1.2.3) corroborated this early finding, showing indeed 
that most disciplines with a high R(D) value are disciplines within the natural sciences. By analyzing the 
records engagement through (1) selecting records with Fn ≥ 2000, (2) selecting records based on p1 and p2, 
and (3) by using the En(D) formula, results illustrate that seven of the ten disciplines most representative 
of the early research literature are disciplines within the natural sciences, with the top four disciplines based 
on engagement factor being natural sciences (i.e., geology, Earth System science, chemistry, and 
environmental science). This is a third sign further corroborating the claim that the ‘Anthropocene’ in the 
early research literature represented a scientific idea. 
 
Findings concerning the disciplines’ engagement factor also provide valuable insight concerning 
the social sciences. Indeed, three out of ten disciplines exhibiting the highest En(D) value are disciplines 
within the social sciences – namely, political science, history, and human geography. This finding is also 
consistent with previous findings concerning both records per field of knowledge and records per discipline. 
While the R(D) value of each of these disciplines remains relatively low (despite satisfying the parameters 
set), the fact that political science, history, and human geography exhibit a discernible engagement factor 
signals an early interest from the social sciences in the ‘Anthropocene’ as a concept beyond the boundaries 
of the natural sciences. Presumably, this early engagement was seminal in pioneering later approaches to 
the ‘Anthropocene’ as a historical and political object of analysis. 
 
2.1.3 Exploring the Early Research Literature: A Qualitative Overlook 
 
The previous section discussed salient properties and findings identified by exploring the early research 
literature from a macrolevel, quantitative viewpoint. A microlevel, qualitative analysis requires engaging with the 
actual texts that represent the literature composing the corpus of analysis. This is achieved by exploring (1) 
the contexts of use of the term, (2) the connotations and places the term is given in texts, and (3) the 
concept’s particular uses and applications in written sources. 
 
Intuitively, this analysis cannot be thoroughly conducted for all of the 670 records. A practical 
solution to exploring the corpus is selecting a certain portion of literature and discussing it based on the 
particular properties being analyzed (e.g., publication year, discipline, field of knowledge, etc.). The main 
criterion defining the selection of this sample literature is based on the distinction between central and 
peripheral literature.  

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
108 
 
 
As anticipated in section 2.1.1.3, this frequency-based distinction is implemented as a proxy for 
each record’s engagement with the concept. Central literature represents 12.4% of the corpus (83 records), 
and has primary value in reconstructing the early history of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. Central literature witnesses how the term was shaped by those epistemic actors engaging directly 
with the term. This type of engagement manifests in various ways – for instance, by providing a definition 
of the term, probing into the semantics of the concept, using the term as an epistemic concept for achieving 
certain research targets, or representing a pivotal concept for research proposals or a research program. 
The sections ahead will be particularly attentive toward this type of literature, shedding light on how the 
term evolved across mediums and contexts, and how such literature initiated archetypal research trajectories 
in Anthropocene Studies. 
 
Peripheral literature represents 87.6% of the corpus (587 records). Because of its size, only a minor 
portion of this literature can be analyzed through selected samples of interest. Notably, the fact that, by 
definition, peripheral literature includes all records exhibiting relatively low engagement does not diminish 
the individual importance and role these records played in the birth, spread, and evolution of the 
‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Indeed, this literature was crucial in the spread and 
survival of the ‘Anthropocene’ during its early existence as a neologism and scientific idea, and is therefore 
extremely valuable in reconstructing the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ and its stratigraphic variant. In these 
terms, peripheral literature is just as important as central literature in reconstructing the early history of the 
term. The following sections will utilize samples of peripheral literature based on factors beyond relative 
engagement – such as context of use, epistemic actor, discipline, or format. 
 
The distinction between central and peripheral literature is a key parameter in selecting sample 
literature. However, this distinction tells little per se concerning the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept 
during its early research stages. This is primarily because Fn values are unrelated to time (i.e., publication 
year). If reconstructing the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis means 
reconstructing a meaningful chronology of certain salient events, then selected literature is best surveyed 
chronologically – that is, from the year 2000 (when the term was coined) to the conceptual turning point 
occurring between 2008 and 2009. Therefore, the following sections discuss sample literature from a 
chronological viewpoint, using publication year (as well as month and day when deemed necessary and 
available) as a primary tool for a chronological reconstruction. As shown, this method consistently 
integrates the findings obtained from the quantitative analysis as well as discussing the texts in light of the 
salient properties identified.106 What emerged is a history rich of events, actors, places, initiatives, and 
publications engendering the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, and laying down the intellectual and 
historical condition of possibilities for the formulation of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
 
106 It should be noted that this chronological approach as a proxy for the spread and evolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept necessarily has a margin of ‘delay.’ This is due to the difference between the time elapsed since any author (1) 
encounters the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, (2) writes about the concept, and (3) publishes writings using the concept. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
109 
 
2.1.3.1 2000: Birth of an Idea 
 
In its modern connotation, the term ‘Anthropocene’ first saw light during the 15th International Geosphere-
Biosphere Programme Scientific Committee (IGBP-SC) meeting held at the Maximiliano y Carlota Hotel 
(today Mission Grand Cuernavaca Hotel) in Cuernavaca, Mexico, between February 22 and 23, 2000.107 
 
The Scientific Committee was a central body of the IGBP. It represented the main decision-making 
entity of the program, and its annual meetings decided upon future research trajectories and policies of the 
overall IGBP organization. Central figures participated in the meetings, including the chairs of the IGBP’s 
core projects, the executive directors, key stakeholders, and people appointed by the International Council 
for Science (ICSU, the sponsor of the IGBP).108 Among the members of the Scientific Committee was 
chemist and atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen (1933–2021), then vice chair of the IGBP and director of 
the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (since 1980); chemist Will Steffen, then executive director of the 
IGBP organization; and geochemist and limnologist Michel Meybeck, then a member of the scientific 
committee for BAHC (Biosphere Aspects of the Hydrological Cycle), and working on the GWSP (Global 
Water System Project).109 
 
The events leading Crutzen to coin the term are reported by Steffen (2013), who narrates that 
during a presentation from scientists of the IGBP’s paleoenvironmental core project (i.e., Past Global 
Changes, or PAGES), Crutzen was becoming “visibly agitated” (p. 486) about the use of the term 
‘Holocene’ to frame the context of their latest research. In a spur-of-the-moment exclamation, Crutzen 
reportedly said, “Stop using the word Holocene. We’re not in the Holocene anymore. We’re in the … the 
… the … (searching for the right word) … the Anthropocene!” (ibid.). As recounted by Crutzen in 
Schwägerl (2014), his remark “had a major impact on the audience. First there was silence, then people 
started to discuss this” (p. 9). A less ‘animated’ version of the episode is also recounted by Meybeck 
(personal communication, June 25, 2021), who recalls that 
 
Crutzen took the floor at the end of a presentation, or added one sentence after his 
intervention, remarking that: “I think we should no longer refer to the Holocene era, considering 
how Humans have influenced the earth system. I would suggest the term Anthropocene” (I cannot 
quote his exact words). I instantaneously made a small sketch about the Anthropocene in my 
notebook. 
 
 
107 An insightful and inspiring reconstruction of the Cuernavaca meeting and the years following it has been written 
by historian of science and AWG member Jacques Grinevald (2020), who considers Crutzen’s intervention a ‘Eureka!’ 
moment. 
108 See http://www.igbp.net/about/organisation.4.2709bddb12c08a79de780001044.html (accessed on June 20, 2021) 
for information concerning the organization of the IGBP. 
109 The BAHC was a phase one core project of the IGBP that lasted from 1991 to 2003. Meybeck was a member of 
its scientific committee between 1995 and 2000. The GWSP was a core project of the Earth System Science 
Partnership (ESSP), and a joint phase two project for the IGBP. It officially launched in 2004 under the collaboration 
of the International Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Programme (IHDP), DIVERSITAS, the 
IGBP, and the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
110 
 
Histories of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept state that the term first appeared in print in the popular IGBP 
Newsletter article published in May 2000. However, the term had already appeared a couple of months before 
in a much less-known outlet – the ASLO (Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, 
formerly American Society of Limnology and Oceanography) Limnology and Oceanography Bulletin, formerly 
known as the ASLO Bulletin. The term appeared in Volume 9, Issue 1 of the bulletin, published in March, 
in the candidate statement for ASLO presidency of Hugh W. Ducklow (2000), an American marine scientist 
researching bacterioplankton and their role in the ocean carbon cycle. Ducklow had been an IGBP 
Scientific Committee member between 2000 and 2003, and was present during Crutzen’s intervention in 
Cuernavaca. As he recalls (Ducklow, personal communication, August 7, 2019), “I was invited to run for 
the ASLO Presidency shortly after I attended the IGBP Meeting at which committee member Paul Crutzen 
argued for naming the present era Anthropocene. So it [the ‘Anthropocene’] was on my mind.” In his 
candidate statement, Ducklow (2000) wrote: 
 
In the post-Kyoto era, CO2 from fossil fuels permeates the depths of the ocean and threatens 
unprecedented rates of climate change, and the hydrological cycle is dominated globally by human 
activity. Recently I heard Nobel Laureate Paul Crutzen declare that Earth has passed from the 
Holocene into the Anthropocene Era – recognizing the dominance of H. sapiens in planetary 
dynamics. These issues indicate the rightness and great need of ASLO’s transition to a scientific 
society more engaged in earth system science, local, national and regional environmental policy 
issues. (p. 3) 
 
It is interesting how the ‘Anthropocene’ concept plays a role in his candidate statement. On the one hand, 
the term stresses the dominance of Homo sapiens in planetary dynamics, and as such it is invested with a 
descriptive meaning with an implicit normative overtone. On the other hand, the concept has a key role in 
the advocated transitioning of ASLO into a new research framework of closer proximity to Earth System 
science as well as policymaking. These connotations provided the ‘Anthropocene’ concept with an 
identifiable epistemic function – that is, as an entity describing a specific state of affairs requiring a transition 
from traditional epistemologies of sciences to include Homo sapiens as a central epistemic factor. While this 
is only marginally tackled in the text, such usage of the term is recurrent in central literature during the early 
research stages of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
The article cannot be compared to Crutzen and Stoermer (2000) in terms of weight in determining 
the future history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. Ducklow himself (personal communication, August 7, 
2019) states that the circumstances leading to his usage of the term were “just a coincidence.” Nevertheless, 
in addition to being the earliest written record of the modern ‘Anthropocene,’ the short article is also the 
earliest signal of interest among the oceanographic, hydrologic, and limnologic community that grew 
significantly throughout the early years of existence of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Indeed, the combined records 
per discipline value for oceanography (76), hydrology (35), and limnology (31) is 142, with a significant 
portion of records stemming from oceanography. Ducklow (2000) witnesses an early (if not the earliest) 
interest among scientists (in a particular disciplinary arena) in the social and epistemic potential of the term. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
111 
 
As a matter of fact, marine sciences were to become among the main disciplines using the term 
‘Anthropocene’ during its early history. 
 
In May 2000, the seminal article “The ‘Anthropocene’,” authored by Crutzen and Eugene 
Stoermer, was published in the 41st issue of the IGBP Newsletter. Crutzen contacted Stoermer immediately 
after realizing that Stoermer had been using the term for years, offering him to jointly publish the seminal 
article. Eugene ‘Gene’ Stoermer (1934–2012) was a limnologist, ecologist, and diatoms expert who had used 
the term independently from the 1980s during his classes. As he recalled, “I began using the term 
“anthropocene” in the 1980’s, but never formalized it until Paul contacted me” (Grinevald, 2007b, p. 243). 
Oceanographer and AWG member Jaia Syvitski (2012) recalls a 1995 email exchange with Stoermer where 
he “described terrestrial and neritic oceanic production during the Anthropocene” (p. 14, box 1). A former 
doctoral student of Stoermer’s at Colorado State University, geologist Sarah A. Spaulding (personal 
communication, June 7, 2020) provides first-hand experience with Stoermer’s context of use of the term: 
 
I recall Gene Stoermer using the term Anthropocene, but in such a way that it did not even seem 
new, or even novel. It was another way that he expressed what he had observed for decades. For 
most of his career, Gene worked on the sediment cores of lakes, investigating change in diatom 
assemblages over time. 
Primarily his research concerned lakes in the US, from Lake Okoboji in Iowa where he 
did his doctoral research while at Iowa State University, to the Laurentian Great Lakes. But he also 
worked in other large lakes, including Lake Baikal in Siberia. Gene often talked and wrote about the 
human record in these lakes. One does not need to be a scientist to see the differences between a 
slide of microscopic diatoms that dates from pre-human settlement to after human settlement. 
From his earliest work on lake sediments, his understanding of the dramatic impact of human 
presence was made clear. 
He was always an iconoclast, and to me, his use of Anthropocene was stated because it 
was obvious. 
 
An especially interesting aspect of Stoermer’s contribution to the concept is his disciplinary background 
and context of work – once again, oceanography and limnology. Quite possibly, Stoermer, who was an 
authority in his field, informed generations of students and researchers who heard him using the term. He 
taught for many years an influential field course, Ecology and Systematics of Diatoms, at Iowa Lakeside 
Lab. As noted by Spaulding (personal communication, June 22, 2021), “Most people in North America, 
and many internationally, trace their educational lineage to Stoermer in some way.” This could represent a 
major driver behind the concept’s particularly successful history within the oceanographic and limnological 
community – as witnessed by the joint number of records for both disciplines. 
 
Crutzen was already a well-established scientist by 2000. He was “one of the most cited natural 
scientists in the world” (Schwägerl, 2014, p. 10), and had been awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry (with 
Mario Molina and Frank Sherwood Rowland) five years before in 1995 for his contribution to 
understanding the formation and decomposition of atmospheric ozone. Considering that prestige is a 
determining factor in the spread and establishment of scientific ideas (Morgan et al., 2018), Crutzen’s 
successful profile undoubtedly played a key role not simply in the future spread of the term, but also in its 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
112 
 
initial survival and acceptance. As also recognized by Trischler (2016), neither Crutzen nor Stoermer 
predicted that the term would have such long-term success. If they had, “they would surely not have 
published their proposal in an internal newsletter, but rather in a prominent scientific journal in order to 
better reach the global scientific community” (p. 310). The fact that the term proliferated throughout the 
scientific world despite the original outlet further confirms that Crutzen’s established figure was a central 
force in the spread and adoption of the term in early research literature. Crutzen himself stated that “I think 
my impetus made it possible for the Anthropocene idea to take off in the public and scientific arena” 
(Möllers et al., 2015, p. 32). Indeed, his contributions in the following years through publications and 
presentations are a central thread to follow in reconstructing the early modern history of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
The IGBP Newsletter article is seminal in different regards. The most intuitive is the appearance in 
published form (and most of all in the title) of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a main object of research. In these 
terms, the two-page article represents the cradle of the “founding myth” (Trischler, 2016, p. 310) of the 
‘Anthropocene’ – a myth that has its origins in the Earth System science community. The article provides 
the first ontology of the ‘Anthropocene’ as an (informal) geological epoch determined by the impact of 
human activities. This characterization stretches from the expansion of humankind “both in numbers and 
per capita exploitation of Earth’s resources” (Crutzen & Stoermer, 2000, p. 17) and a tenfold increase in 
urbanization in the past century, to the release of large amounts of greenhouse gasses through fossil fuel 
combustion, the formation of the ozone hole in the Antarctic, and the anthropogenic impact on the 
biosphere. This impact, they argue, “will continue over long periods” (ibid.), hinting at the possible 
millennial-scale footprint that humans will leave in the future. The time depth of humans’ legacy in the 
stratigraphic record would become a major point of conversation around the stratigraphic significance of 
the ‘Anthropocene’ as a geological time unit (see section 5.2.1). 
 
After providing a preliminary ontology for a state of affairs seemingly requiring a new designation 
replacing the ‘Holocene,’ the authors gave their seminal definition of the newly introduced neologism: 
 
Considering these and many other major and still growing impacts of human activities on earth and 
atmosphere, and at all, including global, scales, it seems to us more than appropriate to emphasize 
the central role of mankind in geology and ecology by proposing to use the term “anthropocene” 
for the current geological epoch. (ibid.) 
 
Notably, the definition stresses the role of humanity in geology and ecology rather than Earth System science 
(which is never mentioned throughout the text). However, this does not imply that the Earth System has 
not been impacted by human activities. In fact, the Earth System is more implicitly addressed throughout 
the text by using proxies most commonly representing it (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane, population 
increase, fisheries impact, etc.) – the same proxies later used by Steffen et al. (2004c) to visually represent 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
113 
 
the Great Acceleration.110 Nevertheless, this seminal definition pioneered the earliest interest in the 
geological impact of humans, attributing to the ‘Anthropocene’ an original underlying geological 
connotation. The definition did not yet represent the formulation of a ‘stratigraphic Anthropocene’ (i.e., 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis), but set the foundations for later work to build upon this original and basic 
input. 
 
Crutzen and Stoermer assigned a starting date to the ‘Anthropocene’: the latter part of the 18th 
century. This is the time period coinciding with the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in England. As they 
argued, “[t]his is the period when data retrieved from glacial ice cores show the beginning of a growth in 
the atmospheric concentrations of several ‘greenhouse gases’, in particular CO2 and CH4” (ibid.), and that 
also coincides with James Watt’s invention of the steam engine in 1784. Interestingly, the two scientists 
anticipated future debate on the beginning of the Anthropocene by acknowledging “that alternative 
proposals can be made (some may even want to include the entire holocene)” (p. 17). This represents a rich 
aspect and ongoing debate that has spanned for over a decade, seeing scientists and researchers debating 
over methods, evidence, and meaning of selecting a starting date for the ‘Anthropocene’ (see section 3.2).  
 
Furthermore, the article suggests that without a global-scale catastrophe affecting the whole of 
humanity, humankind will “remain a major geological force [emphasis added] for many millennia, maybe 
millions of years, to come” (p. 18). Assigning humanity the status of ‘geological force’ has been a recurrent 
topos in Anthropocene Studies to the point that the ‘Anthropocene’ has often been interpreted as the time 
when humans have become a force equal to other geological forces shaping the planet. This aspect is 
separately discussed in section 3.1.1, as it constitutes a central characteristic separating the ‘Anthropocene’ 
from the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Lastly, Crutzen and Stoermer’s seminal article has an explicit normative nuance. The article 
concludes by stating: 
 
To develop a world-wide accepted strategy leading to sustainability of ecosystems against human 
induced stresses will be one of the great future tasks of mankind, requiring intensive research efforts 
and wise application of the knowledge thus acquired in the noösphere, better known as knowledge 
or information society. An exciting, but also difficult and daunting task lies ahead of the global 
research and engineering community to guide mankind [sic] towards global, sustainable, 
environmental management. (ibid.) 
 
This is an interesting remark because it signals that the ‘Anthropocene’ was not conceived solely as a 
technical term encapsulating a set of measurable properties (e.g., population increase, atmospheric CO2 
concentrations, etc.), but also as a normative warning against the challenges that this proposed epoch 
entailed. Indeed, it was Crutzen’s intention that the word would serve as a “warning to the world” (Dalby, 
2016, p. 40, quoting an email correspondence between journalist Elizabeth Kolbert and physicist and 
climate expert Joe Romm) rather than a descriptive category. At the very beginning of the history of the 
 
110 This also explains why Crutzen and Stoermer (2000) has been labelled as a record in Earth System science (see 
Appendix). 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
114 
 
modern ‘Anthropocene,’ a dualism between the descriptive and normative ‘Anthropocene’ (see section 
1.3.1) is already discernible, foreshadowing later developments in both trajectories. This dualism was 
reflected upon by Crutzen years later in an interview by Christian Schwägerl published in Welcome to the 
Anthropocene: The Earth in Our Hands (Möllers et al., 2015). When asked whether the ‘Anthropocene’ 
represented solely a scientific hypothesis, Crutzen acknowledged that the term “also develops into a 
metaphor about the relationship between nature and humankind, with the latter initially on the receiving 
end” (p. 34). The normative nuances of the ‘Anthropocene’ remained constant in Crutzen’s formulations 
of the term throughout the years. 
 
Visibly, many of the central themes later explored in Anthropocene Studies can be correlated to 
Crutzen and Stoermer’s seminal article. While neither scientist could have predicted the long-lasting history 
of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, their contribution ignited a series of debates, themes, and research trends 
and trajectories that substantially affected not solely the future history of the concept, but engendered the 
formation of a very discrete knowledge domain – namely, Anthropocene Studies. Yet, neither Crutzen nor 
Stoermer could have foreseen the long ‘Anthropocene’ history ahead of them. 
 
On October 13, 2000, in Volume 290, Issue 5490 of Science, two more articles appeared mentioning 
the term ‘Anthropocene.’ The concept made its official debut in a scientific, peer-reviewed journal.  
 
The first article (a review article under ‘climate change’), entitled “The Global Carbon Cycle: A 
Test of Our Knowledge of Earth as a System” (Falkowski et al., 2000), was authored by a team of seventeen 
researchers close to the IGBP community, including oceanographer Paul Falkowski (the lead author), future 
IGBP Executive Director and oceanographer Sybil Seitzinger, and Will Steffen. The presence of 
oceanographers among the contributors is yet another sign of early interest among the marine sciences in 
the ‘Anthropocene.’ A second remark concerns the use of the term ‘Anthropocene’ in the text. The article 
addresses anthropogenic changes to climatological and biogeochemical processes affecting the global 
carbon cycle, discussing state-of-the-art research as well as knowledge of carbon cycle couplings and 
feedback systems in the Earth System. The term ‘Anthropocene’ is mentioned once in the conclusion of 
the article, where the necessity of integrating knowledge from different disciplines among earth sciences is 
advocated for. The authors write: “As we rapidly enter a new Earth system domain, the ‘Anthropocene’ 
Era, the debate about distinguishing human effects from natural variability will inevitably abate in the face 
of increased understanding of climate and biogeochemical cycles” (p. 295). The ‘Anthropocene’ is 
interpreted as a new Earth System domain characterized by the pressing presence of human activities as a 
structural component of Earth System functioning. This unprecedented state is fraught with uncertainties 
related to a lack of integrated information, especially on the long-term scale, of human pressures on the 
planet. Another remark concerns the ‘Era’ designation. While the capitalization of ‘Era’ may suggest a 
geological denotation (geological units are capitalized), the designation is informal and does not reflect the 
original designation by Crutzen and Stoermer (2000, to whom Falkowski et al. cite as a reference). Rather 
than representing a formal geological time unit, the ‘Era’ stresses the magnitude of the ‘Anthropocene’ as 
a transitional phase characterized by a pre-human and a post-human Earth System. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE

The second article, entitled “The Ascent of Atmospheric Sciences” (Crutzen & Ramanathan, 2000), 
is authored by Crutzen himself and Veerabhadran Ramanathan, an atmospheric scientist and presently a 
distinguished professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. 
The essay provides a short history of the establishment and development of atmospheric sciences since the 
17th century, tackling central historical figures in chemistry and meteorology. The term ‘Anthropocene’ 
appears once in the conclusion, where future trajectories of climate change (especially in terms of the ozone 
layer, global warming, and possible alterations of El Niño) are hypothesized. The authors write: “It may 
well be argued that the environmental expansion of human activity has jolted Earth into a new geological 
era, the ‘Anthropocene’” (p. 303). Presumably, it was Crutzen’s suggestion to use the term, after he had 
used it some months before to define the present geological time. In the article, the ‘Anthropocene’ is an 
era intended not as much as a formal geological unit, but rather as the beginning of a new time period 
dictated by a significant shift in the state of affairs driven by a certain force – that is, the “environmental 
expansion of human activity” (ibid.). The article concludes by suggesting possible technical solutions (e.g., 
geoengineering) to this environmental expansion, without going deeper into the meaning and implications 
of the ‘Anthropocene’. 
 
Lastly, two abstracts appeared for two different presentations held on occasion of the American 
Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, hosted at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco 
between December 15 and 19, 2008. The AGU is a geoscientific and space-oriented society of international 
reach established in 1919 and headquartered in Washington, D.C. It has a wide range of peer-reviewed 
journals, and it is well-known for its annual meetings (i.e., the Fall Meetings) where thousands to tens of 
thousands of scientists participate by attending, presenting, and sharing their work through a vast number 
of panels and sessions. It is divided into twenty-five macrosections, each dealing with a specific aspect of 
Earth and space (e.g., Atmospheric Sciences, Biogeosciences, Aeronomy, etc.). In Lassey et al. (2000) – an 
abstract for a presentation under the Atmospheric Sciences section – the term appears in the abstract’s title 
“How has the Global Methane Source Inventory Evolved over the Anthropocene?”, and the 
‘Anthropocene’ is shortly defined as the anthropogenic era. In Moore (2000), the ‘Anthropocene’ is only 
hinted at once in relation to the necessity of developing an “international programme of Earth System 
Science” (p. 1.) to face the challenges posed by this novel geological epoch. Lassey et al. (2000) and Moore 
(2000) are the first in a series of abstracts that began to appear in the AGU meetings. Presumably, the term 
had already echoed (although limitedly) across scientific communities and epistemic actors – especially 
those around the Earth System sciences, and close to Crutzen himself.  
 
These early approaches to the ‘Anthropocene’ drew on Crutzen’s seminal suggestion, which 
provided an elegant and simple term to frame the state shift in the Earth System brought about by human 
activities. They also inaugurated a slow transition from the ‘Anthropocene’ as an informal scientific neologism 
to the ‘Anthropocene’ as an informal epistemic category.  
 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
116 
 
2.1.3.2 2001–2003: First Steps 
 
By the end of 2000, the ‘Anthropocene’ had reached a discrete academic audience. Besides the IGBP 
Newsletter article, the term had appeared only twice, and as a background concept, in a scientific peer-
reviewed journal (i.e., Science). In 2001, twelve records appear to have used the term, followed by twenty-
nine occurrences in 2002, and twenty-four in 2003. The vast majority of these early texts only marginally 
used the term, yet they provide valuable insight into how the term was received and interpreted across a 
spectrum of disciplines and epistemic actors. The ‘Anthropocene’ was beginning to take its first steps in 
the academic and scientific landscape as something more than a mere neologism. 
 
Crutzen was a main driver in popularizing the term in the early years. After the IGBP Newsletter 
article, Crutzen authored a series of publications centered around the ‘Anthropocene.’ Most notably, on 
January 3, 2002, Crutzen published one of the most quoted and distinctive publications on the 
‘Anthropocene’ – Nature’s popular article “Geology of Mankind” (Crutzen, 2002d). At that time, Crutzen 
was director of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, and held a professorship at the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography at UC San Diego.111 The article represents central literature as it engages directly with the 
‘Anthropocene,’ its meaning, its conceptual roots, and its normative intent. Crutzen provides a short 
genealogy of the term, mentioning past concepts recognizing “[m]ankind’s growing influence on the 
environment” (p. 23) such as Antonio Stoppani’s ‘anthropozoic’ and Vernadsky and Teilhard de Chardin’s 
‘noösphere.’ Then, he proceeds by delineating the ontology of the ‘Anthropocene’ using proxies such as 
the growing human population, land surface exploitation, dam building and river diversion, primary 
production removal from fisheries, per-capita energy use, rates of fossil fuel emissions, and release of toxic 
substances in the Earth’s environments. As in Crutzen and Stoermer (2000), Crutzen (2002d) locates the 
beginning of this post-Holocene epoch in the late 18th century, “when analyses of air trapped in polar ice 
showed the beginning of growing global concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane” (p. 23). 
 
An interesting nuance within the article is a change in tone from the previous IGBP Newsletter 
article. In the latter, the authors state that “[w]ithout major catastrophes […] mankind will remain a major 
geological force [emphasis added] for many millennia, maybe millions of years, to come” (Crutzen & Stormer, 
2000, p. 18). In “Geology of Mankind,” Crutzen (2002) writes: “Unless there is a global catastrophe […] 
mankind will remain a major environmental force [emphasis added] for many millennia” (p. 23). The emphases 
highlight the type of natural force that humankind is invested with. In the former article, humans are 
described as a geological force, whereas in the latter they represent an environmental force. There may be several 
reasons behind this shift in tone – for instance, the fact that the term ‘environmental’ is a much more 
normative term than ‘geological’; a retraction of considering human actions to be equal to geological forces; 
 
111 The fact that Crutzen was affiliated with one of the most important oceanographic institutions in the world may 
be considered as another vector behind the early success that the ‘Anthropocene’ had across the oceanographic, 
hydrologic, and limnologic communities. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
117 
 
or simply an editorial choice by the journal.112 This is a subtle, yet important distinction for framing later 
debates about the geological and stratigraphic depth of humanity (section 5.2.1), and the type of claims 
entailed in the Anthropocene Hypothesis (section 3.1.1). 
 
“Geology of Mankind” crystallized the ‘Anthropocene’ as a novel term in scientific literature, 
revisiting in a prestigious and more visible journal theses previously advanced in the IGBP Newsletter entry. 
As also observed by environmental scholar Jeremy Davies (2018), “[i]t is this article that best marks the 
emergence of the concept into widespread scientific awareness […] [the] Nature article is the canonical 
statement of the first version of the Anthropocene” (pp. 43–44). However, the article was not Crutzen’s 
only attempt to solidify his original version of the ‘Anthropocene.’ In the same year, he also published two 
other articles: one in the French Journal de Physique IV in November (Crutzen, 2002a), and one in the Journal 
of Environmental Science and Health, Part A on December 11 (Crutzen, 2002c). Both articles are introductions 
to the journals’ respective issues, and both include the term ‘Anthropocene’ in their title. Crutzen (2002a) 
– also entitled “The ‘anthropocene’” – reiterates and amplifies the definition and ontology originally 
advanced in Crutzen and Stoermer (2000), whilst Crutzen (2002c) – entitled “The Effects of Industrial and 
Agricultural Practices on Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate during the Anthropocene” – reiterates the 
environmental (rather than geological) impact of human activities over the past two or three centuries in 
defining the ‘Anthropocene’ through the atmospheric mark of greenhouse gasses.  
 
Still in 2002, Crutzen also authored a book chapter entitled “Atmospheric Chemistry in the 
‘Anthropocene’” (Crutzen, 2002b). The chapter is part of the IGBP’s Challenges of a Changing Earth, a volume 
following plenary presentations from “Challenges of a Changing Earth, a Global Change Open Science 
Conference” held in Amsterdam between July 10 and 13, 2001. Besides the title (and bibliography), the 
term ‘Anthropocene’ only appears in the introductory paragraph to denote a transitional epoch 
distinguishing the past two centuries. 
 
Another one of Crutzen’s major contributions to developing the concept of ‘Anthropocene’ came 
in a short article co-authored with Will Steffen for Climate Change, published on December 1, 2003. The 
article (an editorial comment to the journal’s issue), “How Long Have We Been in the Anthropocene Era?” 
(Crutzen & Steffen, 2003), reflects on the impact of human activities and on the unfolding of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ The article is seminal in different respects. First, the authors provide a preliminary 
snapshot of the famous set of twenty-four graphs that later became the symbol of the Great Acceleration. 
The graphs appeared ‘officially’ just a year later in the IGBP synthesis Global Change and the Earth System, at 
that time still in press. Second, the authors address (as the title suggests) the question over the beginning of 
the ‘Anthropocene.’ They suggest that the epoch has unfolded in time through several steps. A first step 
came at the dawn of agriculture and domestication. A second major step occurred between the late 18th 
century and 1950, during and after the Industrial Revolution. A third step coincided with the acceleration 
of Earth System and socio-economic trends after 1950 – a period shortly thereafter named the ‘Great 
 
112 While still possible, this last option seems less likely, given that Crutzen continued to address humans as an 
‘environmental force’ rather than a ‘geological force’ in the following years in other journals – as noted in the next 
section. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
118 
 
Acceleration.’ This diachronous understanding of the ‘Anthropocene’ sets the premises for an Earth System 
science interpretation of the ‘Anthropocene’ (Steffen et al., 2007; Steffen et al., 2011b), and foreshadows 
later debates over the implication of a time-transgressive ‘Anthropocene.’  
 
Lastly, the authors briefly comment on a research article published in the same issue of Climate 
Change authored by paleoclimatologist William Ruddiman (2003). The article, entitled “The Anthropogenic 
Greenhouse Era Began Thousands of Years Ago,” argues for a much earlier beginning to the 
‘Anthropocene’ – which Ruddiman originally located between 8,000 ka and 5,000 ka. The proposal 
represents the original expression of the Ruddiman Hypothesis (sometimes addressed as the ‘Early 
Anthropocene Hypothesis’ or ‘Early Anthropogenic Hypothesis’) – a hypothesis that the paleoclimatologist 
has developed for almost two decades, and one of the main contenders among ‘Anthropocene’ hypotheses 
in locating the (informal) beginning of the epoch. The hypothesis has had a central role in debates about 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and it is discussed separately in section 3.2.2.3. 
 
Crutzen’s work and prestigious aura was a central factor in the early survival and spread of the 
term. The fact that similar terminological alternatives, such as the Russian ‘Anthropogene,’ ‘Anthrocene’ 
(Revkin, 1992), and ‘Quinternary’113 (Berger & Loutre, 2001, 2002), did not survive in the academic and 
popular arena corroborates the idea that Crutzen’s position among the ‘high ranks’ of academia was a 
determinant in the survival (and spread) of the ‘Anthropocene.’  
 
By the beginning of 2001, the term started attracting several authors and appeared sporadically 
across scientific literature gravitating around the work of the IGBP. The term is only mentioned in passing 
by atmospheric scientist and climatologist Hans J. Schellnhuber (2001) in his contribution (the chapter 
“Earth System Analysis and Management”) to Understanding the Earth System, a volume edited by geographers 
Eckart Ehlers and Thomas Krafft. Ehlers and Kraft were pioneering figures in the German reception of 
the ‘Anthropocene,’ and later edited Earth System Science in the Anthropocene (Ehlers & Krafft, 2006a), one of 
the first books where the term ‘Anthropocene’ appears in the title.114 In Schellnhuber (2001), the term only 
appears in the caption for Figure 7 (p. 27), where the coevolution and coexistence of the ecosphere and the 
anthroposphere is illustrated. Schellnhuber was chairman of the Global Analysis, Integration and Modeling 
(GAIM) working group of the IGBP from 2000 to 2004, and was among the participants during Crutzen’s 
famous intervention at Cuernavaca.  
 
Schellnhuber was also among the authors (including Will Steffen) of the 4th issue of the IGBP 
Science Series (a series of executive summaries meant for policymaking and stakeholders),115 entitled Global 
 
113 The term ‘Quinternary’ was coined by French geologist and engineer Auguste Napoléon Parandier (1804–1901), 
and promoted in an article entitled “Notice géologique et paléontologique sur la nature des terrains traverses par le 
chemin de fer entre Dijon at Châlons-sur-Saône,” published on Bulletin de la Société géologique de France, series 3, 19, 794-
818. In its modern connotation, the term has been reproposed by André Berger and Marie-France Loutre (mentioned 
later in section 2.2.1) in 2001 to define a post-Quaternary period (rather than epoch) based on forecasting of the 
melting of Antarctica’s and Greenland’s ice sheets in the next millennia. In their proposal, the ‘Anthropocene’ 
correspond to the last epoch of the Quaternary.  
114 Ehlers went on to publish the German-language monograph Das Anthropozän: die Erde im Zeitalter des Menschen 
(Ehlers, 2008). 
115 The Science Series was a collection of five executive summaries meant for policymaking and stakeholders 
summarizing Earth System research conducted by the IGBP. For more information on the IGBP Science Series and

Change and the Earth System: A Planet Under Pressure (Jäger et al., 2001) – which later gave the title to one of 
the most comprehensive syntheses of the IGBP’s work (Steffen et al., 2004b). In Jäger et al. (2001), the 
‘Anthropocene’ appears in the title of the third contribution: “The Anthropocene Era.” The four-page 
entry identifies the major anthropogenic drivers behind global change and the altering of the Earth System. 
The term ‘Anthropocene’ is only briefly mentioned in the introductory section of the contribution, and 
defined (based on Crutzen and Stoermer’s article) as the era in which “human activities have become a 
significant force in the dynamics of the Earth System” (p. 11). 
 
Using the ‘Anthropocene’ as a background concept is a notable characteristic of peripheral 
literature. An early example of such use outside Earth System science appears in an article by ecologist 
Magnus Nystro and economist and environmental scientist Carl Folke (Nyström & Folke, 2001) published 
in Ecosystems in August 2001 (but available as early as February 25, 2000). The article focuses on coral reef 
resilience to anthropogenic disturbances. The term only appears twice in the text, featuring in the 
introduction and in a section’s title. The authors define the ‘Anthropocene’ as a post-Holocene “human-
dominated biosphere” (p. 406), and use it to frame the challenges posed against “the capacity of coral reefs 
to perform a number of critical ecosystem-level functions and to alter their ability to cope with disturbance” 
(ibid.). Thus, the “Anthropocene Era” (p. 408) is a state where human activities have become major drivers 
not solely for disturbances and stresses to coral reefs, but also for changing “ecosystem dynamics and 
resilience” (p. 409). As anticipated, this type of use – namely, using the term as a background notion (primarily 
in the introduction of a text) – is a distinguishing pattern across the entirety of the literature, exemplifying 
the use made of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept across records with low engagement with the term. Indeed, 
Folke (2003a, 2003b) continued to use the term over the next years as a background or ‘introductory’ 
concept,116 by defining the ‘Anthropocene’ as (on both occasions) the “era where most aspects of the 
structure and functioning of Earth’s ecosystems cannot be understood without accounting for the strong 
influence of humanity” (Folke, 2003a, p. 2027). 
 
Oceanography and neighboring disciplines (i.e., hydrology and limnology) also began to engage 
with the term. As anticipated, these disciplines showed an early interest in the ‘Anthropocene’ concept 
during its early existence, appearing in a substantial number of oceanographic texts between 2000 and 2009. 
Research material from geochemist and oceanographer Michel Meybeck (2001) witnesses this engagement. 
Meybeck had been a scientific advisor for the UN Global Environment Monitoring System for freshwater 
(GEMS/Water) between 1978 and 1998, and a member of IGBP scientific committees. The scientist notes 
(Meybeck, personal communication, June 24, 2021) that “the global hydrologists of IGBP were the first to 
use the Anthropocene concept in 4 or 5 papers.” Since his earliest publications, which were based on 
 
to access the issues, see http://www.igbp.net/publications/scienceseries.4.1b8ae20512db692f2a680001564.html 
(accessed on June 23, 2021). 
116 A survey of the peripheral literature seems to show that most texts using the term ‘Anthropocene’ do so within the 
introductory or conclusive remarks. However, this observation is not definitive and should be confirmed by a finer 
degree of analysis. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
120 
 
previous work on global change of world rivers, Meybeck has been using the ‘Anthropocene’ concept as 
an integral concept of his work and his research community. As he recalls, 
 
(i) from the Cuernavaca meeting until now the Anthropocene concept has been used by our 
community to analyse the complex and evolving interactions between Humans and their 
environment, particularly well addressed in river systems, where river quality and river fluxes are 
well suited to qualify (Who, why, where, when?..) and quantify (How much, when, where, ?..) these 
interactions. (ii) The concept occurred at the right time, we were already describing the global 
impacts on rivers since one or two decades (on nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfate, chloride, sediments, 
water runoff ...), but we were lacking a simple word and a clear concept to qualify this evolution. 
The IGBP-BAHC project clearly used the Anthropocene in its synthesis (Kabat et al, 2004)[117], and 
the Global Water System Project as well (2004–201x..). (ii) The hydrosystems (term used at for the 
Holocene) should now be conceived as socio-hydrosystems at the Anthropocene which can be studied 
at nested scales, from the small stream or the agricultural plot, to the global scale and the land to 
oceans inputs. (ibid.) 
 
This insight shows how particularly successful the concept of ‘Anthropocene’ has been for oceanographic, 
hydrologic, and limnologic research through the years. It also shows that the term immediately proved to 
be useful by providing to existing and developing research a timely and accurate term to describe a 
transitional state of rivers following anthropogenic impacts. This is valuable information for reconstructing 
the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis, especially viewed against the vivid 
debates across disciplines over the utility of the term that developed in the past two decades (see section 
5.2.4). It shows that the term was adopted, first and foremost, because of its utility in particular disciplinary 
domains. It elegantly framed a state of affairs which was dominated by human activities, and which 
requested new methodological approaches. 
 
One of the earliest contributions on the ‘Anthropocene’ by Meybeck is Chapter 17 of Science and 
Integrated Coastal Management, a volume edited by oceanographers Bodo von Bodungen and R. K. Turner. 
The volumed is based on the 85th meeting of the prestigious Dahlem Workshop Series held between 
December 12 and 17, 1999.118 The ‘Anthropocene’ appears in the title of Meybeck’s chapter, “River Basins 
under Anthropocene Conditions.” As is recurrent in the peripheral literature, the term appears (besides the 
title) only in the introductory section of the chapter, providing a preliminary context for the study. The 
author addresses the ‘Anthropocene’ as “the current geological epoch when the growing impacts of human 
activities on the Earth system are equal to the natural forcing” (Meybeck, 2001, p. 276), referring to Crutzen 
and Stoermer (2000) in the bibliography. However, Meybeck also comments: 
 
Although these authors [Crutzen and Stoermer] assign Watts’s invention of the steam engine (1784) 
as the starting point of the Anthropocene, I prefer to refer to 1950 as the key date for its full 
development, i.e., the point at which many indicators of human impacts (e.g., land use, dam 
constructions, urbanization, CO2 increase, waste release) reached a global extension. (ibid.) 
 
 
117 Meybeck is referring to Meybeck et al. (2004) and Vörösmarty and Meybeck (2004).  
118 See section 1.2.2, footnote 37 for information on the Dahlem Workshop Series. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
121 
 
This is an interesting remark because it not only anticipates the date later selected by the AWG to locate 
the stratigraphic beginning of the ‘Anthropocene,’ but it also represents an early instance of alternative 
starting dates of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Indeed, the proxies Meybeck provides embody some of the Earth 
System and socio-economic trends representing the Great Acceleration (a term coined four years later in 
2005; see section 1.2.2), whose graphs later became the iconic symbol of the ‘Anthropocene’ (Steffen et al., 
2015).  
 
While, in terms of relative frequency of the term ‘Anthropocene,’ Meybeck (2001) represents 
peripheral literature, the term ‘Anthropocene’ is given epistemic significance, encapsulating the set of 
conditions under which rivers, influenced by human activities, now operate. This state of affairs requires 
new typologies and modelling of river systems. Such epistemic use of the concept is reiterated in further 
publications by Meybeck. For instance, in a paper for the journal Aquatic Sciences entitled “Riverine quality 
at the Anthropocene: Propositions for global space and time analysis, illustrated by the Seine River,” 
Meybeck (2002) writes in the introduction that “[t]he term Anthropocene has recently been used to qualify 
this fundamental change in the Earth’s System, particularly regarding the climate” (p. 376). In a 2003 paper 
entitled “Global analysis of river systems: From Earth system controls to Anthropocene syndromes,” 
Meybeck (2003) lists a series of ‘syndromes’ that characterize rivers’ ontology under Anthropocene 
conditions, such as contamination, flood regulation, acidification, eutrophication, and more (Table 2, p. 
1942). Both articles share common technical features, such as the inclusion of ‘Anthropocene’ as a selected 
keyword, the appearance of the term in the introductory section of the text, and the peculiar (from today’s 
perspective) linguistic choice of the phrase ‘at the Anthropocene’ rather than ‘in the Anthropocene.’ 
However, they also share their use of the ‘Anthropocene’ as an epistemic category – that is, as a stage or 
‘era’ where anthropogenic transformations in the ontology of river systems have occurred worldwide at 
least in the past fifty years. Used as such, the term is not solely an informal designation, but has epistemic 
utility, identifying a particular set of conditions under which ‘Anthropocene’ rivers operate and need to be 
(re)considered. 
 
Meybeck was a central figure in championing the concept of ‘Anthropocene,’ not solely among the 
oceanographic, limnologic, and general water science community. He is among the authors who most used 
the ‘Anthropocene’ during (and after) the term’s early history in written records. As such, he was a major 
driver in spreading the term across diverse communities united by the international operations of the IGBP 
and the Earth System science community. As he recalls (Meybeck, personal communication, June 28, 2021), 
“in the next 5 years following Cuernavaca I tried my best to apply and circulate the Anthropocene concept 
in all the fields that could be connected to rivers: global sedimentology (sediment trapping in dams), global 
hydrology (BAHC synthesis), geochemistry, carbon cycle, aquatic ecology, land use change (Seine basin), 
and more generally in aquatic sciences (GWSP).” 
 
The ‘Anthropocene’ also had an early appearance in the title of a paper published in Scientia Marina 
in December 2001 by Codispoti et al. (2001) – namely, “The oceanic fixed nitrogen and nitrous oxide 
budgets: Moving targets as we enter the anthropocene?” While the paper shows a relative frequency value 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
122 
 
(i.e., 504) substantially below the selected threshold value, the paper seems to have had a remarkable reach. 
This is not only confirmed by its citation score,119 but is visible upon surveying literature in oceanography 
and limnology as well related literature excluded from the corpus of analysis.120 Consistently with the 
peripheral literature, the term appears in the article’s introduction. However, the term also appears in central 
portions of the text, where key questions on the discussed themes (i.e., steady-state ocean hypothesis, ocean 
denitrification, ocean nitrogen budget) are raised. In particular, the ‘Anthropocene’ is implemented multiple 
times to identify a transitional phase in assessing the deficit in the oceanic nitrogen budget and the 
functioning of the nitrogen cycle, both traditionally modelled without accounting for the human factor: 
 
Are we in a transition state as we enter the Anthropocene in which the deficit in the oceanic fixed N budget exceeds 
~200 Tg N yr -1, or are we significantly underestimating oceanic nitrogen fixation, or both? […] The large deficit 
(~200 Tg N yr -1) in our revised oceanic fixed-N budget […] could also rise because all studies bearing on this 
subject have been made during the climate transition from the Holocene to the Anthropocene. […] Trying to 
understand how the oceanic source term for N2O may change as we enter the Anthropocene is of 
more than casual interest. (pp. 91, 100) 
 
This epistemic use of the ‘Anthropocene,’ which the article hints to have commenced by the 1950s, is 
remarkably similar to the use of the concept by Meybeck (2001, 2002, 2003). It is a concept identifying a 
specific threshold in time (i.e., 1950) after which the ontology and epistemology of certain objects (i.e., 
rivers, oceans) need to be revised in light of escalating anthropogenic impacts on the Earth. Once again, 
this proves that the term was particularly useful in the oceanographic, limnologic, and hydrologic 
community – all disciplines playing a central role in spreading the term during its earliest years of existence. 
  
The ‘Anthropocene’ concept took its first step as a background notion and as an epistemic category 
in scientific publications in Earth System science, oceanography, hydrology, and limnology. In particular, 
water and marine sciences played a pivotal role in absorbing the term and transforming it into a functional 
epistemic concept within their disciplinary domain. This is also confirmed by the appearance of workshops 
featuring ‘Anthropocene’ in their title – such as the LOICZ (Land-ocean interaction in the coastal zone, an 
IGBP core project) “Coastal Change and the Anthropocene” workshop, held between May 29 and June 1 
at the Rosenstiel School for Oceanography, Miami (LOICZ, 2002; Talaue-McManus, 2004); or the theme 
“The Arctic in the Anthropocene: The North Atlantic Arctic in Focus,” chosen for the Second International 
Symposium of the Nordic Arctic Research Programme held in May 2002 in Akureyri in northern Iceland 
(Saarnisto et al., 2002). Moreover, the ‘Anthropocene’ soon became a key term for framing research 
initiatives of an international scale – such as the Sustainability Geoscope.  
The Sustainability Geoscope was a German-based proposal for a “global observation instrument 
and interpretation framework designed to meet the need for integrated natural scientific and socioeconomic 
data of a next-generation type and quality” (Lucht & Jaeger, 2001, p. 138). The idea was first championed 
 
119 See https://badge.dimensions.ai/details/id/pub.1071806898 (accessed on June 24, 2021). 
120 The latter point refers to literature quoting the article, and thus appearing under the keyword search ‘Anthropocene’ 
because of the paper’s title. Because of the parameters set in section 2.1.1.1, this literature is excluded from the corpus, 
and thus not taken into consideration for the present analysis.

by physicist and Earth System scientist Wolfgang Lucht, then a postdoc researcher at the Potsdam Institute 
of Climate Impact Research, PIK, and sustainability and climate change scientist Carlo C. Jaeger, also a 
researcher at PIK. The proposal appears in a report for the Nationalen Komitee für Global Change 
Forschung (NKGCF, National Committee on Global Change Research), a German advisory entity on 
global change research funded and co-sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German 
Research Foundation) and the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF, Federal Ministry of 
Education and Research).121 Jaeger was a member of the NKGCF, which organized a meeting at Bad 
Honnef near Bonn in January 2001 that brought together over a hundred scientists in the German global 
change community. The symposium produced a twenty-paper report entitled Contributions to Global Change 
Research: A Report by the German National Committee on Global Change Research.122 Lucht and Jaeger (2001) 
appears on this report as the last of the twenty papers with a contribution entitled “The Sustainability 
Geoscope: A Proposal for a Global Observation Instrument for the Anthropocene.” 
 
The paper mentions the ‘Anthropocene’ several times during the text. The authors address it as 
“[t]he currently emerging state of the planet, where there are no longer distant places to refer to as ‘fully 
natural’” (p. 139). This emergent state “is characterised by the fact that the human and the natural systems 
are inseparably intertwined in one earth system, in what may be called an emerging post-natural state” 
(ibid.). To observe and monitor this phenomenon, which interlinks human and natural processes in the 
functioning of the Earth System, an “observation system is to be constructed” (p. 140). This observatory 
system is the Sustainability Geoscope, meant “to be an instrument for observing the emerging 
anthropocene and the sustainability transition” (ibid.). Such an instrument would develop as a national and 
international effort, grounded on the theoretical and empirical work of Earth System programs such as the 
IGBP, IHDP, and ESSP (Earth System Science Partnership, see section 1.2.2). The ‘Anthropocene’ seems 
to play more than a background role in the proposal: it represents the very phenomenon that the 
Sustainability Geoscope means to observe. As such, it is a central epistemic object of the proposal. 
 
Workshops on the Sustainability Geoscope proposal followed after the Bad Honnef meeting. On 
October 25 and 26, 2001, a workshop sponsored by NKGCF and PIK was held in Berlin at the Hotel 
Intercontinental – a venue towering between the city’s zoological garden and the famous Großer Tiergarten. 
The workshop “aimed at introducing the idea of a Geoscope to the international global change community 
and preparing the ground for interdisciplinary research efforts for sustainability transitions” (Lotze-
Campen, 2001, p. 3). High-profile organizations were represented at workshop, including the IGBP-DIS 
 
121 The NKGCF was terminated in 2013 and replaced by the Komitee für Nachhaltigkeitsforschung (DKN, German 
Committee Future Earth). 
122 Thomas Krafft (previously mentioned) was among the editors of the report.

Earth System Atlas initiative,123 GMES,124 HELIO international,125 and more. Besides a strong German-
based presence, there were also participants from other European countries, the USA, the UK, Iceland, 
Pakistan, India, Cameroon, and more. The sessions and working groups were documented by agricultural 
economist Hermann Lotze-Campen (2001), who had just joined the PIK as a researcher. Lotze-Campen’s 
report has only one direct mention of the ‘Anthropocene’ in relation to the opening statements for the 
working group (cancelled “due to lack of interest among workshop participants,” p. 10), suggesting that the 
‘Anthropocene’ was not a primary object of conversation among participants during panels and sessions. 
Nevertheless, it is feasible that participants discussed the terms outside formal events, in that the term was 
already being actively used by some of the participants – including Thomas Krafft and Hans J. Schellnhuber, 
both of whom had already encountered and approached the term ‘Anthropocene.’ Considering the central 
role of the ‘Anthropocene’ in the previous proposals (as well as in the Sustainability Geoscope website), it 
is further likely that the ‘Anthropocene’ could have been a topic of conversation among participants, thus 
extending the reach of the term in the academic landscape. 
 
The ‘Anthropocene’ appeared in three further documents related to the Sustainability Geoscope 
initiative. The first document is an interim report submitted in January 2002 to NKGCF (Jaeger et al., 2002). 
The report stresses again the aim of the Geoscope as “an observation instrument for the anthropocene” 
(p. 1) in the first paragraph of the document, where the ‘Anthropocene’ (appearing only once throughout 
the text) is defined as “the era which humankind has just entered and where the tight interlinkages between 
human and natural environment have become obvious and are taken into consideration in an integrated 
worldview” (ibid.). The second document is a pre-circulated paper authored by Lotze-Campen, Lucht, and 
Jaeger (2002) meant for the Fifth Annual Conference for Global Economic Analysis, hosted in Taipei 
between June 5 and 7, 2002. The ‘Anthropocene’ is again mentioned once, borrowing the same definition 
given in Jaeger et al. (2002). The same use is reiterated in the last document retrieved on the Sustainability 
Geoscope initiative where the ‘Anthropocene’ appears. The document is a paper authored by Lotze-
Campen and Lucht (2002) on occasion of the Conference on the Human Dimensions of Global 
Environmental Change, held in Berlin on December 6 and 7, 2002. In all three documents, the 
‘Anthropocene’ plays a background role, identifying a state of affairs on which the Sustainability Geoscope 
focuses. 
 
123 The IGBP Data and Information Systems (DIS) was formed in 1993 “as a framework activity to improve the 
supply, management, and use of the data and information needed to attain IGBP’s scientific goals” (IGBP, 2015b). 
Earth System Atlas was the initial project launched by IGBP-DIS, and was later taken over by GAIM (Global Analysis, 
Integration and Modelling, one of the IGBP core projects) when IGBP-DIS was terminated at the end of 2001. 
124 The Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) was founded on May 19, 1998 (at that time with the 
name of Global Monitoring for Environmental Security) by the joint initiative of the European Commission and 
European space industry representatives, during a meeting held at Baveno, Italy. The day established the adoption by 
interested parties of the Baveno Manifesto, which promoted the creation of a European-based Earth monitoring and 
observation program. In December 2012, GMES changed its name to Copernicus. More information on the history 
of Copernicus is available at https://insitu.copernicus.eu/news/the-copernicus-in-situ-component-since-the-baveno-
manifesto#FTN2 (accessed on June 27, 2021), and on the respective Wikipedia page. 
125 HELIO (Hydro, Eolien, Light, Insulation, Organomasse) International was a French-based NGO comprising an 
international network of environment- and energy-oriented economists and experts, running from 1997 to 2015. More 
information on the initiative is available at http://helio-international.org/ (accessed on June 27, 2021). 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
125 
 
 
The Geoscope initiative did not launch, despite the reports and series of workshops held to 
promote the idea. Nevertheless, the initiative is one of the earliest implementations of the term 
‘Anthropocene’ in research-related projects. The ‘Anthropocene’ was the center of gravity of the initiative, 
representing the object or phenomenon of analysis the Geoscope was to analyze. This proves that the 
‘Anthropocene,’ despite being then only a newborn neologism, was fraught with epistemic potential. 
 
The echoing of the term across leading research institutions and initiatives, renowned researchers, 
journal articles, and other academic sources across a spectrum of scientific disciplines is a vertical and 
horizontal measure of the academic interest that the term ignited. In turn, this signals the epistemic potential 
that the term was immediately invested with, establishing itself as an informal, geologically charged 
designation for the time when humans became a significant planetary force. It was a boundary object that, 
while retaining central characteristics, was plastic enough to be readapted across disciplines (Braje & Lauer, 
2020; Star & Griesemer, 1989) – particularly areas of knowledge related to the environment. As early as 
2002, the term even appeared in study manuals. For instance, a terrestrial ecology textbook – meant to 
“introduce the science of ecosystem ecology to advanced undergraduate students, beginning graduate 
students, and practicing scientists from a wide array of disciplines” (Chapin III et al., 2002) – references the 
‘Anthropocene’ as a post-Holocene epoch defined by humans. In the third edition of Toxicological Chemistry 
and Biochemistry (Manahan, 2003), the ‘Anthropocene’ is mentioned in relation to the anthroposphere and 
green chemistry, and it appears in the “Questions and Problems” exercise section for students.126 
Interestingly, the term even appeared in the doctoral dissertation Inequality and Sustainability by Colin David 
Butler (2002) – co-founder of BODHI (Benevolent Organisation for Development, Health and Insight) –
where he defined the ‘Anthropocene’ as the “period, roughly coincident with the Holocene, marked by 
extensive human caused environmental change, global in scale” (p. 419).127 Apparently, the ‘Anthropocene’ 
was already beginning to be considered as something worth teaching to new generations of students, and 
as a suitable framework notion for postgraduate research. 
 
Moreover, the term slowly began to attract interest beyond the borders of the anglophone world, 
appearing in German environmental literature (Biermann, 2002; Ehlers, 2004; Fabian, 2002; Luhmann, 
2004) as ‘Anthropozän’; in early French publications (Caesau, 2002a, 2002b; Ramstein et al., 2004) as 
‘Anthropocène’; in Chinese literature (Tung Sheng, 2004; Zhu, 2001) as ‘人类世’; and shortly after in 
Japanese texts (Koji, 2004; Murakami et al., 2004) as ‘人新世.’ This shows the degree of interest the term 
ignited across the global environmental and scientific community. The ‘Anthropocene’ took its first steps 
 
126 The questions asked are “What is the anthropocene? Is Earth now experiencing the anthropocene? How will 
humans know if the anthropocene develops?” (Manahan, 2003, p. 58). 
127 This equation between ‘Anthropocene’ and Holocene is based on McMichael (2001, quoted in Butler, 2002). It is 
possible that Butler misunderstood McMichael’s claim that “[t]he foreseeable future of this planet will be human-
dominated. The Holocene is rapidly becoming the ‘Anthropocene’” (p. 344). McMichael did not equate the Holocene 
to the ‘Anthropocene,’ considering that he also cites Crutzen and Stoermer (2000) as a bibliographic reference. Rather, 
McMichael was stressing that the Holocene is transitioning to the ‘Anthropocene.’ It is relevant to stress that Butler did 
not (willingly) anticipate later debates on the beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ (see section 3.2 for a relevant discussion) 
by proposing a Holocene/Anthropocene boundary. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
126 
 
predominantly within the boundaries of the anglophone world. Its voice, however, echoed beyond those 
geographical and linguistic boundaries. 
 
The early years of the ‘Anthropocene’ show that the term was perceived and interpreted as more 
than a generic neologism doomed to a predetermined short lifecycle. On the contrary, it was the most 
suitable term for describing in a single and concise word the relationship between humans and the various 
components of the Earth System; it brought together existing research from various disciplinary areas by 
focusing the impact of human activities into a single semantic unit of practical as well as theoretical value; 
and it described a new phenomenon (or set of phenomena) requiring a revision of existing models and 
theories investigating humans as distinct entities from natural processes. The ‘Anthropocene’ was, to 
paraphrase historian John McNeill (2000), a term giving a name to that something which was new under 
the sun. The Nature (2003) editorial famously welcomed it in a short commentary published on August 14, 
2003, during an unusually warm summer. The scientific community, and later the broader academic world, 
also began to welcome the ‘Anthropocene’ as an emerging scientific concept. 
 
2.1.3.3 2004–2007: Spreading of the Term 
 
The year 2004 saw a discernible increase in records – up to forty-eight, compared to twenty-nine in the 
previous year. This increase could be used to establish a boundary between two phases in the history of the 
‘Anthropocene’: a phase when the ‘Anthropocene’ took its first steps across the academic and scientific 
landscape, and a phase characterized by a more rapid spread across fields of knowledge, disciplines, and 
formats. Records per year increase to fifty-four in 2005, eighty-one in 2006, and eighty-seven in 2007. As a 
consequence, this phase also demarcates an increasing engagement with the term from authors, witnessed 
by the emergence of more thorough analyses of the semantics of the ‘Anthropocene’ as well as an increasing 
appearance of the term in titles. 
 
Crutzen maintained his role as primary driver for the diffusion of the term across the natural 
sciences. He published abundantly in different venues (and languages), including a newspaper article for 
The New York Times (Wallström et al., 2004, para. 11) published on January 20, 2004; a book written in 
Italian (curated by Andrea Parlangeli) published by Mondadori in 2005 (Crutzen, 2005a), representing one 
the first books on the ‘Anthropocene’ meant for the public audience; and a 2007 French article for Ecologie 
and politique entitled “La géologie de l’humanité: l’Anthropocène” (Crutzen, 2007). Publishing was not his 
sole means of spreading the term. He also organized and attended workshops and conferences where he 
further solidified the ‘Anthropocene’ in academic contexts.  
 
A notable example is a workshop he attended in Vatican City, organized by geochemist and 
Director and Scientific Member at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry Meinrat O. Andreae jointly with 
the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (PAS),128 between October 31 and November 2, 2004, under the theme 
 
128 Crutzen had been a member of PAS since 1996. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
127 
 
“Interactions between Global Change and Human Health.”129 The primary aim of the workshop was to 
analyze the feedback and interactions among “three issues related to our well-being [that] figure 
prominently in the public concern: Socio-economic development, adverse changes in the environment, and 
human and animal health” (Crutzen, 2006c, p. xi). The workshop was overseen by Marcelo Sánchez 
Sorondo, Chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences since 1998. Many important figures in the 
scientific world were invited – including economist David E. Bloom (Chair of the Department of 
Population and International Health, Harvard University), Carlo Jaeger (PIK), Anthony J. McMichael 
(Director of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, Australian National University), 
and epidemiologist David L. Heymann (representative of the Director-General for the Polio Eradication 
Campaign, World Health Organization). Important figures in the early history of the ‘Anthropocene’ were 
also invited – notably, Will Steffen, Michel Meybeck, and William F. Ruddiman.  
 
From the written report of the workshop, the ‘Anthropocene’ seems only to appear as a 
background term. Steffen and Lambin (2006) mention the ‘Anthropocene’ only in their title, framing their 
discussion around the impact of humans on the functioning of the Earth System. Meybeck (2006) tackles 
the term briefly, defining it as “the new geologic era following the Holocene (the last 10,000 years), in which 
human control on Earth Systems dynamics, particularly climate, is now equal to or exceeds the natural 
forcing” (p. 62). Lastly, the term is only once mentioned by Andreae et al. (2006) in relation to global 
environmental change. 
 
Only a few days after the PAS workshop, Crutzen also attended a plenary session entitled “Paths 
to Discovery,” held in the same venue in Vatican City between November 5 and 8, 2004. The aim of the 
plenary session (also organized by PAS) was to discuss and share strategies, methods, and experiences of 
scientific discovery from a theoretical, practical, and existential viewpoint. This event too included 
important figures in the academic, scientific, and ecclesiastic world – including particle physicist Nicola 
Cabibbo (President of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences), Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later elected Pope 
Benedict XVI on April 5, 2005), and Rita Levi-Montalcini, neurobiologist and Nobel laureate in medicine. 
Here, Crutzen gave a talk in the afternoon session of November 6, entitled “The ‘Anthropocene’: The 
Present Era Influenced by Human Activity.” The corresponding paper was published in the conference 
proceedings under the title “The Anthropocene: The Current Human-Dominated Geological Era” 
(Crutzen, 2006b). The paper discusses “the consequences of human activities on the earth’s atmosphere 
and climate during the ‘Anthropocene’” (p. 201) by using the twenty-four socio-economic and Earth System 
graphs then recently developed by the IGBP (Steffen et al., 2004b; discussed later in this section) – which 
he notes are probably already the “most cited diagrams on the consequences of human activities on the 
atmosphere” (ibid.). 
 
129 When asked about why choosing to organize the workshop with PAS in Vatican City, Andreae (personal 
communication, October 2, 2021) stated that “[t]here were several reasons. One is that it is an extremely attractive 
and “exotic” venue, which is important if you want to attract prominent and busy participants, who have to make 
choices what meetings to attend. Second, it provides a secluded and relaxed atmosphere, which is conducive to 
intensive exchange. Third, the Academy provides funding for the participants. Finally, they have been producing a 
nice book series where the outcome could be published.” 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
128 
 
 
The ‘Anthropocene’ appeared as a background term during both events. However, the high-profile 
nature of the workshop and attendees witnesses the vertical reach that the term had already gained among 
the high ranks of international academia and scientific research – as early as 2005. The ‘Anthropocene’ was 
no longer to be treated as an informal designation, but as an epistemically useful term to frame a particularly 
discernible (and problematic) state of affairs. It was maturing into a discrete scientific concept identifying a 
discrete set of relevant problems. This is particularly confirmed by the plenary sessions, whose aim was for 
scientists to share their experiences in scientific discovery. Notably, Crutzen presented on the 
‘Anthropocene,’ thus considering it a scientific idea charged with epistemic potential. This is an important 
characteristic in identifying the original semantics of the term, and in reconstructing the future trajectory of 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Crutzen’s academic activity scattered across countries, institutions, programs, and academic 
publishing outlets – witnessing the geographical and academic extent of his production. He contributed (as 
an editor, program advisor, and writer) to Earth System Analysis for Sustainability, the report of the 91st Dahlem 
Workshop held in Berlin between May 25 and 30, 2003 which the atmospheric scientist co-organized. His 
contributions appear in three different chapters of the report. In the opening chapter, Crutzen – together 
with sustainability scientists and ecologists William C. Clark and Hans J. Schellnhuber (Clark et al., 2004) – 
places the ‘Anthropocene’ at the very beginning of the report, providing a history of the idea, its meaning 
for Earth System science, and a prognosis for the future. With an incisive tone, the ‘Anthropocene’ is 
defined as “a new geologic epoch in which humankind has emerged as a globally significant – and potentially 
intelligent – force capable of reshaping the face of the planet” (p. 1). Beside Crutzen’s personal influence 
on the term’s use, positioning the ‘Anthropocene’ in the very first section of the opening chapter signals 
the importance the term carried in framing the status of the Earth System. In Chapter 14, Crutzen and 
Ramanathan (2004) further develop themes on the role of chemistry and atmospheric science in the 
‘Anthropocene’ originally advanced in Crutzen (2002b).130 It also expands on the ‘Anthropocene’ concept 
in an appendix (section 14.1) delineating the major anthropogenic factors (e.g., population increase, fossil 
fuel consumption, land conversion, etc.) engendering this new era. Lastly, Crutzen appears among the 
contributors to Chapter 16 (a group report by Steffen et al., 2004a), where the idea of a non-analogue state 
of the Earth System is reinforced by that of the ‘Anthropocene’ – so that the ‘Anthropocene’ is the non-
analogue state the Earth has entered. 
 
By emphasizing climate change and global change in the Earth System, Crutzen was also one of 
the leading researchers in juxtaposing pressing issues of societal relevance with the notion of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ By the dawn of the 21st century, environmental narratives and international proactive and 
reactive efforts had their major focus on greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, and climate change – 
still today major hotspots for environmental debates. Inevitably, the ‘Anthropocene’ became enmeshed 
 
130 Notably, Crutzen (2002b) is entitled “Atmospheric Chemistry in the ‘Anthropocene,’” whilst Crutzen and 
Ramanathan (2004) adds ‘climate’ (and a subtitle) to its title: “Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate in the 
Anthropocene: Where Are We Heading?” Other than reflecting the themes tackled in the chapter, this choice also 
reflects the strong climate-oriented connotations given to the ‘Anthropocene’ in Earth System literature. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
129 
 
(though not yet publicly) with these preexisting narratives, especially through the work of the IGBP and 
the work by Crutzen. Indeed, a large portion of his work focuses on the role of greenhouse gasses emissions 
and their impact on the climate. For instance, in a 2005 article published by New Perspectives Quarterly – a 
journal (ceased in 2020) “that consistently engages the best minds and most authoritative voices in cutting-
edge debate on current affairs” (Gardels, 2021) – Crutzen (2005b) states: 
 
For the past three centuries, the effects of humans on the global environment have escalated. 
Because of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, global climate [emphasis added] may depart 
significantly from natural behavior for many millennia to come. It seems appropriate to assign the 
term “Anthropocene” to the present, in many ways a human-dominated, geological epoch. (p. 14)131 
 
Likewise, in his early geoengineering proposals he noted that “reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas 
emissions are clearly the main priorities” (Crutzen, 2006a, p. 217) in coping with the increasing “non-
analogue condition of the Anthropocene” (ibid.). Placing the ‘Anthropocene’ into a politically sensible 
context may have contributed to the success of the ‘Anthropocene’ and its popularity in the Earth System 
sciences (perhaps at the expense of other more focalized disciplines such as oceanography, hydrology, and 
limnology, whose interest and contribution to the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ had not been thoroughly 
recognized). 
 
Crutzen was also among the attendees of the 96th Dahlem Workshop “Integrated History and 
future Of People on Earth (IHOPE).” This was an influential workshop organized by ecological economist 
Robert Costanza (who was lead author of an often-cited article entitled “The value of the world’s ecosystem 
services and natural capital”; see Costanza et al., 1997) held between June 12 and 17, 2005. Among the 
participants were also Will Steffen, and historian John McNeill, who later became an AWG member. The 
workshop’s results are summarized in the popular report Sustainability or Collapse? An Integrated History and 
Future of People on Earth (Costanza et al., 2007). 
The Dahlem workshop was influential for two main reasons. The first is related to the very aim of 
the workshop – that is, inaugurating “the first steps in developing a fully integrated history of humans and 
the rest of nature and thus [serving] as a foundation for the ongoing Integrated History and future Of 
People on Earth (IHOPE) project” (p. 4). The IHOPE project was reportedly launched by Robert Costanza 
during the 3rd IGBP Congress “Connectivities in the Earth System,” organized in Banff between June 19 
and 24, 2003.132 Its primary goal was (before its digitalization) to deliver a “rich understanding of the 
interactions between environmental and human processes over the past hundred or so millennia on Earth” 
(IGBP, 2010, p. 1). IHOPE promoted the creation of an integrated framework to accomplish this goal:  
 
 
131 Visibly, this article reiterates the status of humans as an “environmental force” (2005b, p. 16) rather than a 
‘geological force,’ as originally stated in Crutzen and Stoermer (2000). This seems to corroborate a voluntary shift in 
tone (rather than an editorial choice) in Crutzen’s notorious “Geology of Mankind,” as previously anticipated. 
132 See also https://ihopenet.org/what-is-ihope/ (accessed on July 6, 2021) and the IGBP Report No. 59 (IGBP, 
2010) for more information on the historical roots of IHOPE. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
130 
 
To achieve this ambitious goal, new and existing data sources [will be used] to produce an integrated 
historical account of changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry and composition, ecosystem 
distribution, material and water cycles, species extinctions, land-use systems, human settlement 
patterns, technologies, patterns of disease, patterns of language and institutions, conflicts and alliances, 
and other variables. To achieve this ambitious goal, it will be necessary to create a framework that can 
be used to integrate perspectives, theories, tools and knowledge from a variety of disciplines spanning 
the full spectrum of social and natural sciences and the humanities. (ibid.) 
 
The project was consolidated through the 96th Dahlem Workshop, and it became a project of interest shared 
among IGBP core projects as well as IHDP, while remaining under the administration of the IGBP’s core 
project AIMES (Analysis, Integration and Modeling of the Earth System) until the program’s dissolution. 
IHOPE was originally hosted by the US National Center for Climate Research (NCAR) from 2003 to 2009; 
by the Stockholm Resilience Center from 2009 to 2011; and then by Uppsala University’s Department of 
Archaeology and Ancient History from 2011 to 2018. The project became part of Future Earth when the 
IGBP and IHDP dissolved in 2015, and is currently hosted online.133  
 
The second major outcome of the workshop was related to the term ‘Great Acceleration,’ coined 
by John McNeill during the event. The designation provided yet another semantic piece to the ‘puzzle’ of 
the ‘Anthropocene’ by giving a name to the post-1950 surge in socio-economic and Earth System trends 
that the IGBP had only recently (and so elegantly) illustrated. Indeed, the designation later became the title 
of a very popular book in environmental history that McNeil published (together with historian and energy 
expert Peter Engelke) in 2014 – namely, The Great Acceleration: An Environmental History of the Anthropocene 
since 1945 (McNeill & Engelke, 2014). Combined, the IGBP diagrams and the ‘Great Acceleration’ provided 
the ‘Anthropocene’ concept with a strong theoretical foundation. They integrated history, Earth System 
science, and the environmental research as intrinsic aspects of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a new phase of 
humanity. This had enormous repercussions for later debates (either historical, stratigraphic, or 
environmental) on the temporal nature of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
The respective experience and expertise of Crutzen, Steffen, and McNeill converged in one of the 
most popular publications in Anthropocene Studies – indeed, one often represented the ‘standard narrative’ 
of the early history of the Anthropocene. In December 2007, the journal Ambio published “The 
Anthropocene: Are Humans Now Overwhelming the Great Forces of Nature?” (Steffen et al., 2007). The 
article stemmed from the 2005 Dahlem workshop, and “marked the emergence of many key features of the 
Anthropocene concept in the peer-reviewed literature” (Steffen, 2021, p. 1).  
 
The authors explore the onset and development of the ‘Anthropocene’ by using atmospheric CO2 
as their primary proxy to track this development. They begin by considering the earliest impacts of the 
Homo genus on the planet, from the discovery of fire through the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions 
to the dawn of agriculture. These pre-Anthropocene events influenced and greatly shaped the Earth’s 
environments and biota. However, the authors argue that the impact of these events “remained largely local 
and transitory, well within the bounds of the natural variability of the environment” (p. 615). A fundamental

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
131 
 
transition “in the history of humankind, potentially of similar importance in the history of the Earth itself, 
was the onset of industrialization” (p. 616). This transition, with its roots in 18th-century England, represents 
Stage 1 of the ‘Anthropocene’ (ca. 1800–1945), characterized by “the enormous expansion in the use of 
fossil fuels, first coal and then oil and gas as well” (ibid.) associated with a six-fold population growth, fifty-
fold economic growth, and forty-fold energy use. It is during the Industrial Revolution that atmospheric 
CO2 concentrations reached and surpassed the natural variability of the Holocene. This signal is used as a 
proxy by the authors to locate the beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ at 1800 (see also section 3.2.3.3). Stage 
2 (ca. 1945–2015) coincides with the post-WWII Great Acceleration. The global population increased at an 
unprecedented rate, as did energy consumption, land conversion to agriculture, water use, and more aspects 
related to ever-growing and ever-demanding human societies. This period also witnessed an outstanding 
increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, outpacing any prior increase in human history. Lastly, Stage 3 
(2015–onward) relates to future scenarios of the ‘Anthropocene,’ mainly reliant on humans’ ability to 
develop strategies for developing sustainable means of living (e.g., through mitigation efforts or 
geoengineering options). The authors conclude by stating that “[w]hatever unfolds, the next few decades 
will surely be a tipping point in the evolution of the Anthropocene” (p. 620). 
 
The article encapsulates the meaning of the ‘Anthropocene’ in Earth System science, highlighting 
the transgressive onset of the epoch by dividing it into three main stages. Furthermore, it also provides a 
historical signpost for the status of the term at that time. By 2007, many environmentally oriented 
researchers worldwide (and not solely those close to the IGBP) had become aware of the term 
‘Anthropocene,’ which was more and more used either as a background term or an environmental category 
with normative in addition to descriptive significance. The term became entangled with politically, socially, 
and scientifically dense terms such as ‘sustainability,’ ‘global change,’ ‘climate change,’ and ‘global warming.’ 
This semantic network was crucial in shaping future trajectories of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a concept 
depicting the human–Earth relationship in recent times, and as a dual normative and descriptive concept. 
The article was also crucial in inserting the viewpoint of historians into understanding the social and 
historical mechanisms behind the ‘Anthropocene.’ But these research trajectories had yet to fully develop 
outside the natural sciences. 
 
If Crutzen was the main voice behind the spread of the ‘Anthropocene,’ the IGBP was the 
reverberant means through which the ‘Anthropocene’ echoed across researchers and institutions. Indeed, 
the IGBP remained a central vector in the spread of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept during this propagating 
phase. On April 11, 2004, the program published its landmark Global Change and the Earth System: A Planet 
Under Pressure, edited by Will Steffen and Hans J. Schellnhuber among others. The book synthesizes the 
research conducted by the IGBP during Phase One (i.e., 1987–2003), providing a 336-page snapshot of the 
present state of the Earth System and the pressure it faces under anthropogenic forcings. The 
‘Anthropocene’ has a special place in Chapter 3, “The Anthropocene Era: How Humans are Changing the 
Earth System.” Here, the concept is given a clear and distinguished Earth System connotation: “the Earth 
System is now in a no-analogue situation, best referred to as a new era in the geological history of Earth, 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
132 
 
the Anthropocene” (Steffen et al., 2004b, p. 81). While maintaining the original geological nuance attributed 
by Crutzen, the chapter discusses and characterizes the ‘Anthropocene’ in light of the anthropogenic drivers 
behind the altering of the Earth System during the past two hundred years, and their worldwide extent. 
Notoriously, these are illustrated through the famous set of twenty-four graphs, appearing for the first time 
– besides Crutzen and Steffen (2003) – in this synthesis. The ‘Anthropocene’ (appearing twice in the 
chapter’s title and abstract) sees humans as a force “approaching or exceeding in magnitude some of the great 
forces of nature,” operating “on much faster time scales than rates of natural variability, often by an order 
of magnitude” (Steffen et al., 2004b, p. 134). The resulting impact on the Earth System, generating a 
singularity or a no-analogue state, is the distinctive trait of the ‘Anthropocene’ from an Earth System 
viewpoint. The executive summary (Steffen et al., 2004c) provides a condensed ontology of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ described in the following excerpt: 
 
• 
In the last 150 years humankind has exhausted 40% of the known oil reserves that took several 
hundred million years to generate;  
• 
Nearly 50% of the land surface has been transformed by direct human action, with significant 
consequences for biodiversity, nutrient cycling, soil structure, soil biology, and climate; 
• 
More nitrogen is now fixed synthetically for fertilisers and through fossil fuel combustion than 
is fixed naturally in all terrestrial ecosystems; 
• 
More than half of all accessible freshwater is appropriated for human purposes, and under-
ground water resources are being depleted rapidly in many areas; 
• 
The concentrations of several climatically important greenhouse gases, in addition to CO2 and 
CH4, have substantially increased in the atmosphere; 
• 
Coastal and marine habitats are being dramatically altered; 50% of mangroves have been 
removed and wetlands have shrunk by one-half; 
• 
About 22% of recognised marine fisheries are overexploited or already depleted, and 44% 
more are at their limit of exploitation; 
• 
Extinction rates are increasing sharply in marine and terrestrial ecosystems around the world; 
the Earth is now in the midst of its first great extinction event caused by the activities of a 
single biological species (humankind). (p. 14) 
 
The ‘Anthropocene’ was already embedded in an Earth System context that forged its original identity. 
However, because of the broader importance that Global Change and the Earth System invested in recollecting 
and summarizing over a decade of research from the IGBP, the book can be considered a seminal 
contribution to the development of an Earth System science ‘Anthropocene.’ Indeed, the synthesis 
solidified a research trajectory seeing the ‘Anthropocene’ mutate from loose concept to Earth System 
concept invested with a specific ontology and purpose – that is, to epitomize the state of the Earth System 
(rather than any other particular object or aspect of the Earth), and the main drivers of its functioning over 
the past few centuries. This is an important step in the history of the ‘Anthropocene,’ in that it represented 
among the first instances when the term ‘Anthropocene’ acquired a discipline-based meaning, transitioning 
from loose neologism to actively implemented epistemic category. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
133 
 
 
Global Change and the Earth System was not the only contribution stemming from the IGBP where 
the term gained relevance. The water science community gravitating around the organization, and 
particularly the contributions of Meybeck, strengthened the inclusion of water-related issues in the 
semantics of the ‘Anthropocene’ as an epistemic category. In 2004, another publication of the IGBP Book 
Series appeared – namely, Vegetation, Water, Humans and the Climate: A New Perspective on an Interactive System 
(Kabat et al., 2004). Meybeck was among the editors and contributors of the book, which synthetizes the 
work of BAHC by reporting “more than a decade-long research and findings of a large number of scientists 
studying the Earth system in terms of the connection between the terrestrial biosphere, the hydrologic cycle 
and the potential anthropogenic influences” (p. v). The term is only mentioned once in the introduction of 
Chapter D.4 (Vörösmarty & Meybeck, 2004), but is given more attention in Chapter D.8, and particularly 
in section D.8.5, entitled “Continental Aquatic Systems and Emergence of the Anthropocene” (Meybeck 
et al., 2004). The authors define the ‘Anthropocene’ as the period since the 1950s where “anthropogenic 
influence has exceeded natural forcings in many parts of the world” (p. 456), emphasizing water-related 
aspects and consequences of global anthropogenic forcings. They illustrate the “progressive development 
in time and space of human pressures leading to the Anthropocene” (p. 462) through working hypotheses 
“on the occurrence of some major pressures on continental aquatic systems at the global scale and related 
environmental remediation responses” (p. 463, Figure D.98). These hypotheses were further developed by 
Meybeck (2005b) in a chapter for the edited volume Soil Erosion and Carbon Dynamics, published the year 
after in 2005. Lastly, Meybeck et al. (2004) observe the gap in present knowledge over fluvial systems under 
‘Anthropocene’ conditions, and how possible modelling strategies coupled with Earth System dynamics 
should be considered to fully understand the ontology of rivers and coastal zones in the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
Oceanography, limnology, and hydrology maintained their interest in the term, which became a 
regular background concept framing anthropogenic impacts on rivers, seas, oceans, and water bodies in 
general. The ‘Anthropocene’ momentum in water sciences was kept alive by the work of the IGBP – the 
center of gravity of much water-related work using the term. In particular, Meybeck continued his efforts 
in stressing the importance of water sciences within the Earth System framework by emphasizing water-
related aspects of the ‘Anthropocene.’  
For instance, in April 2004, he published an article in Water Science and Technology (a journal of IWA 
Publishing, a publisher specialized in knowledge about water) analyzing the dominant activities impacting 
continental aquatic systems (Meybeck, 2004). He defined the ‘Anthropocene’ as a new era “where 
continental aquatic systems are no longer controlled by earth systems processes but by human activities” 
(p. 73), illustrating the factors contributing to the shift from the Holocene to the ‘Anthropocene’ in 
continental aquatic systems. As in Meybeck (2001), the starting date for this transitional phase (and thus 
the ‘Anthropocene’) in continental aquatic systems is located at 1950 – a beginning consistent with the 
stratigraphic beginning currently assigned by the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
In early 2005, Meybeck and Vörösmarty (2005) published in Volume 337 of Comptes Rendus 
Geoscience (a journal of the French Academy of Sciences) an article entitled “Fluvial filtering of land-to-ocean 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
134 
 
fluxes: From natural Holocene variations to Anthropocene.” The article explores the evolution of river 
systems and fluxes over two time scales: the last 18,000 years (at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum), 
and over the last 50 to 200 years – the latter being the ‘Anthropocene.’ The authors explore the state-shift 
in river systems brought about by human activities, observing that  
 
[a]t the Anthropocene, land use and water use as well as wastes inputs or leaks generated by human 
pressures are deeply changing the production of river-borne material and its transfer across fluvial 
systems […] Increase in concentrations and fluxes is general: at the finest scale, most major 
biogeochemical cycles are accelerated (erosion, N2 fixation, metal transfers). […] Most natural filters 
are either removed or greatly reduced in their functionality by human pressures. […] [R]eservoir 
construction and expansion of modern irrigation works have been very rapid. […] Both reservoirs and 
irrigated areas should be explicitly considered in river flux modeling as they are very efficient filters for 
particulate matter and biogeochemical reactors. (p. 114, 116) 
 
This is a clear example of ‘epistemic use’ of the ‘Anthropocene’ in central literature. The term is not merely 
mentioned as a background notion, but it is actively used to identify a time period determined by a transition 
from natural variability of fluvial systems into a human-dominated state; and a state-shift requiring new 
methods to assess the state of river and aquatic systems under ‘Anthropocene’ conditions. It has ontological 
significance (i.e., concerning the set of properties of fluvial systems) as well as epistemic significance (i.e., 
concerning knowledge of fluvial systems), providing a concept that easily encapsulates the changes river 
systems have undergone during the recent past and may undergo in the near future. As such, the term is 
not just intelligible (i.e., it is easy to comprehend its semantics), but also useful for explaining the particular 
state-shift in river systems occurring in the past century. As tackled throughout section 4.2, intelligibility and 
explanatory power are epistemic virtues vital in assessing the epistemic legitimacy of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a 
scientific hypothesis. The fact that the term seemingly had these virtues as early as 2005 in a given disciplinary 
context is an important finding for reconstructing the evolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a scientific idea. 
 
Further publications adopted the term as background notion, defined mostly in terms of 
anthropogenic impacts on water systems. In the invited commentary section of an article published by 
Hydrological Process on February 15, 2005, Meybeck (2005a) states that “[h]uman influences on aquatic 
systems have now equalled or exceeded the natural controls, thus defining a new epoch: the Anthropocene” 
(p. 337). Similarly, in a coauthored paper published by Global Biogeochemical Cycles in December 2005, the 
authors (Dürr et al., 2005) define the ‘Anthropocene’ as a time when “changes in fluxes now match or 
exceed the natural fluxes particularly those to the atmosphere and the river systems” (p. 19). These papers 
contributed to the assimilation and use of the ‘Anthropocene’ in the water sciences, while maintaining the 
term’s inner Earth System connotation. They also exemplify a body of literature in a particular disciplinary 
domain that used the term (primarily as a background term) to frame present and future trajectories of 
oceans, river systems, and water bodies in the non-analogue state of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Most importantly, 
literature in the oceanographic, hydrological, and limnological communities acknowledge the importance 
of using the ‘Anthropocene’ category to recognize this state shift when studying water bodies and their role 
in the Earth System – for instance, in assessing the oceanic sink of anthropogenic CO2 (Sabine et al., 2004), 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
135 
 
or in developing new transdisciplinary frameworks for approaching this non-analogue state (Zalewski, 
2007).  
 
Literature was not the only mean through which the ‘Anthropocene’ concept grounded into water 
sciences. Research projects emphasizing the term were also emerging. A notable example is the SOPRAN 
(Surface Ocean Processes in the Anthropocene) project, a German-based initiative launched in February 
2007 as a contribution to the Surface Ocean – Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) international research 
project (Bange, 2015). SOPRAN aimed at understanding “how changing atmospheric composition (e.g. 
increased CO2, dust) affects the surface ocean ecosystem; how climate-related changes in surface ocean 
processes (upwelling, mixing, light, biology) alter oceanic emissions to the atmosphere; [and] the 
mechanisms and rates of ocean-atmosphere material exchanges” (SOPRAN, n.d.). The final SOPRAN 
meeting took place in Kiel on September 7, 2015, and the project ended in 2016. 
 
These spectrum of contributions, from research articles to projects, witness the spread of the term 
‘Anthropocene’ among water science communities, and particularly oceanography. They suggest that the 
term had a central role in encapsulating a certain state of affair. As noted by oceanographer and 
microbiologist David M. Karl (2007) in a review article for Trends in Microbiology, “we must remain vigilant 
about the sea around us as we enter the Anthropocene era” (p. 416). 
 
Other disciplines besides Earth System science and the water sciences began to take interest and 
engage with the term, and in doing so, they contributed to its spread. An interesting example is soil science, 
where the term seems to have appeared for the first time in a Journal of Soils and Sediments article published 
on June 1, 2004 by soil biologist and forest scientist Winfried E. H. Blum (among the editors of the journal 
for the section on soil and landscape ecology) and soil scientist Hariharan Eswaran.  
 
Both Blum and Eswaran were already established authorities in the international soil science 
community. Eswaran was a prominent figure in the American soil conservation landscape. He had been 
National Leader for World Soil Resources, USDA–NRCS (United States Department of Agriculture, 
Natural Resources Conservation Service), until his retirement in 2010. He was Fellow of the Soil Science 
Society of America in 1993, and was awarded the Guy Smith Medal for Soil Classification in 2012 for his 
contributions to the field. Blum had taught at BOKU (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, 
Vienna) from October 1979 until 2009, and held several important positions throughout his career – 
including a twelve-year mandate as Secretary-General of IUSS (International Union of Soil Sciences). He 
was awarded multiple prizes and decorations conferred by Austrian as well as international authorities.134 
Presumably, both Blum and Eswaran aroused interest in the ‘Anthropocene’ within the soil science 
community once they approached the term. Perhaps not by coincidence, soil science later became an 
important contributor to the empirical aspect of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
In their one-page editorial comment, Blum and Eswaran (2004) define the ‘Anthropocene’ as the 
“epoch when the impact of human activities on ecosystems has exceeded that resulting from natural forces”

(p. 71), adding that, from a soil science perspective, the ‘Anthropocene’ “can be described as an epoch of 
land and soil degradation, including desertification, leading to sedimentation and the creation of sediments” 
(ibid.). Moreover, the authors note that a framework was developed for understanding the ‘Anthropocene’ 
– that is, the DPSIR approach (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response). This is a framework originally 
developed by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor 
Volksgezondheid en Milieu, or RIVM) during the late 1990s for the European Environment Agency, which 
has been using it ever since for modelling the interaction between the environment and human societies as 
well as reporting and enabling feedback from policymakers (see Kristensen, 2004 for further information 
on DPSIR). While Blum and Eswaran (2004) is a short contribution, the ‘Anthropocene’ has a noticeable 
role in it. It represents a new transition state where soils (among other aspects of the Earth System) are 
being heavily affected and determined by human actions. Similarly to Crutzen’s originally proposal, Blum 
and Eswaran (2004) observe that locating the beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ by the 18th century “is 
certainly adequate, because the last three centuries have documented information on changes of the land 
and of the ecology in general” (p. 71). 
 
Blum did not seem to further engage with the ‘Anthropocene’ concept during the following years, 
except for in another editorial comment (Blum, 2008) for the Journal of Soils and Sediments published in 
February 2008. But the discipline of soil science did continue to engage with the term. In fact, all 
publications from the soil sciences retrieved in the corpus began to appear after 2004, witnessing a growing 
interest among researchers in this new, seemingly promising term. Soil scientists dealing with anthropogenic 
forcings on soils began to quote Crutzen’s popular “Geology of Mankind” (e.g., Blum, 2008; Janzen, 2004; 
Richter, 2007; Scalenghe & Certini, 2006),135 and to use the ‘Anthropocene’ primarily as a framework notion 
to locate the current status of soil sciences and of soils worldwide. The term gained significance in the soil 
science community, paving its way to the 18th World Congress of Soil Science, held in Philadelphia between 
July 9 and 15, 2006. Here, the term was used (and misspelled) to name the oral session 1.0b “Soil Change 
in Anthropocence [sic],” held on the morning of July 11. The session was chaired by soil scientist and 
geographer Victor Targulian, then an IUSS officer, and convened by Hariharan Eswaran, who had 
published his seminal article a year before with Blum. The three-panel session focused on past and present 
anthropogenic impacts on soils. One of the panels (number 27.2), held by a group of Russian researchers 
(Lyuri et al., 2006), was entitled “Self-Restoration of Post-Agrogenic Soils: Recent Process of Late 
Antropocene [sic].” Russian scientists were accustomed to using the ‘Anthropocene’/Anthropogene as a 
geological unit, which had been used primarily during Soviet research (see section 1.2.4.2). In their 
presentation (only an abstract is available), the authors discuss the process of self-restoration in previously 
agricultural lands by using the European part of Russia as a case study. No specific time coordinates are 
provided to define the ‘Late Anthropocene,’ although the authors seem to suggest that the Anthropocene 
 
135 Notably among these, soil scientists Riccardo Scalenghe and Giacomo Certini (2006) later published articles (Certini 
& Scalenghe, 2011, 2021) advocating for a soil-based marker for the ‘Anthropocene’ as a geological time unit. Their 
proposal is discussed as an Early Anthropocene hypothesis in section 3.2.2.5. Soil scientist Daniel D. Richter, whose 
use of the term dates back to 2007, became an AWG member in 2012.

Journal articles, abstracts, and conference presentations were not the only mediums acting as 
vectors for the spread of the ‘Anthropocene.’ The concept carved its way through encyclopedias as well. 
The term appears in the second edition of the Encyclopedia of Soil Science (Arnold, 2005) under the entry 
“Future of Soil Science: Role of Soils.” The term only appears once in the introductory paragraph, 
reiterating the background function of the term common across peripheral literature. The term also appears 
under the “Pedosphere” entry in the Encyclopedia of Ecology (Targulian & Arnold, 2008), coauthored by Victor 
Targulian (who had chaired an ‘Anthropocene’ session during the 18th World Congress of Soil Science). 
Here, the term is given more relevance, identifying a period of “extensive exploitation of soils by humans 
during the last two centuries” (p. 2670). What particularly stands out from this encyclopedia entry is the use 
of the term. Throughout the text, the ‘Anthropocene’ is considered as a geological time unit as if it was 
already established. Unlike in most peripheral literature, the authors do not address it as a ‘proposed’ or 
‘suggested’ epoch or era, but simply assume it as a time period identifying a qualitative shift in anthropogenic 
impacts on soils over the past two centuries. This is a remarkable use of the term, considering the 
importance of the format where it is being used. Another encyclopedia appearance is in the Encyclopedia of 
Ecology, under the entries “Paleoecology” (Birks, 2008) and “Noosphere” (Jaeger, 2008) – the latter edited 
by Carlo Jaeger, discussed in the previous section for his role in the Sustainability Geoscope initiative. 
 
While the ‘Anthropocene’ took its first steps primarily within the natural sciences, by 2004 the 
concept had begun to be received, slowly and gradually, by disciplines within other fields of knowledge. 
Social sciences took an interest in the term, most notably environmental and sustainability studies (generally 
represented by texts of a multidisciplinary nature), but so did political science (e.g., Dalby, 2007a; Lange & 
Schimank, 2004), human geography (e.g., Ehlers, 2004; James & Marcus, 2006; Turner II & McCandless, 
2004; Turner II et al., 2004), and history (e.g., Grinevald, 2007a; Grinevald, 2007b; Kennedy, 2006; Periman, 
2006; Robin & Steffen, 2007; D. P. Turner, 2005) – among others. Despite the relatively low number of 
history records (i.e., 26), the discipline was particularly successful in establishing an early partnership with 
the Earth System science community, becoming a valuable contributor in venturing into the historical 
mechanisms that engendered the ‘Anthropocene.’ The IHOPE project (previously mentioned) is an 
example of this partnership.  
 
By coupling human and Earth systems into an integrated historical and biophysical system over 
the past millennia, IHOPE intended to draft a global history of humanity in light of the Earth System. 
Intuitively, such global history necessarily required the discipline of history as a key ingredient for achieving 
this ambitious project, but it also needed the cooperation of other disciplines. As historian Libby Robin 
wrote with Earth System scientist Will Steffen in a seminal article published by History Compass on July 11, 
2007, “[g]lobal history has become the business of more than just historians” (Robin & Steffen, 2007, p. 
1694). That is because “[t]he Anthropocene defines the momentous and historical change in circumstances 
whereby the biophysical systems of the world are now no longer independent of the actions of people” (p. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
138 
 
1699), and therefore “[t]he idea of the Anthropocene demands an integration of biophysical and human 
history” (ibid.). This early perception of the role of history in studying the ‘Anthropocene’ anticipated many 
discussions of a historical nature that matured in the following decade – discussions that saw history among 
the most engaged disciplines in analyzing (and also criticizing) the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
Among the applied sciences, the term surfaced around 2006 – seeing only one mention in 2004 by 
environmental scientist Braden Allenby (2004) in an article entitled “Infrastructure in the Anthropocene: 
Example of Information and Communication Technology,” published by the Journal of Infrastructure Systems. 
Allenby had been Environment, Health, and Safety Vice President for AT&T from 1997 to 2004, before 
moving to Arizona State University as President’s Professor and Lincoln Professor of Engineering and 
Ethics, School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment. He made a significant number of 
contributions implementing the term ‘Anthropocene’ between 2006 and 2009. Most interestingly, these 
contributions spanned across disparate fields of knowledge, connecting environmental education and ethics 
to infrastructures, sustainable engineering, and Earth System science. Ethics and technology play a 
particular role in his writings. For instance, Allenby (2006) discusses the urgency of creating “macroethical” 
systems to face “the emergent behaviors and inherent unpredictability of the integrated 
natural/human/built complex adaptive systems of the Anthropocene” (p. 13). In particular, technology is 
crucial in the emergence of these complex adaptive systems, so that “perhaps the essence of the 
Anthropocene is technology” (p. 8). This a philosophically dense statement that, incidentally, also 
epitomizes the earliest instances of philosophical interest in the ‘Anthropocene.’ Indeed, philosophical (in 
a broad sense) texts implementing the term only began to appear in the later part of the decade. 
 
Humanities too took notice of the ‘Anthropocene’ during this stage of the concept. As early as 
2007, sociologist Eileen Crist (2007) expressed skepticism of the evolving rhetoric of the ‘Anthropocene,’ 
writing (in a section of the article entitled “Against the Anthropocene”) that “[t]he linguistic ushering in of 
the Anthropocene conceptually hardens modern humanity’s perceived entitlements, thereby reinforcing 
how human beings act within the biosphere” (p. 53). As such, “declaring the advent of the Anthropocene 
and the end of the Holocene is arrogant and premature, and it should be unmasked for what it is: enshrining 
humanity’s domination over the planet or, at best, capitulating to fatalism” (ibid.). This early criticism 
foreshadowed much of the critique that developed within the humanities and social sciences in the 
following decade – which is thoroughly discussed in Chapter 5. Questions of environmental ethics were 
framed in a new light shed by the ‘Anthropocene’ – a concept that “puts us indeed at a hinge point of 
history” (Rolston III, 2007, p. 3) where an “Anthropocene Ethics” (Dalby, 2007b) seems necessary. 
 
The literature, researchers, and events surveyed were combined vectors for the spread of the term 
across scientific communities in the middle of the 2000–2009 decade. Prestigious figures and institutions 
in the scientific world began to notice and engage with the term, which also became an object of discussions 
across workshops and conferences centered on the impact of humans on aspects of the Earth System. This 
increasing engagement exemplifies the ‘epistemic growth’ of the ‘Anthropocene’ – that is, from simple 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
139 
 
background concept and spur-of-the-moment neologism to epistemic category for identifying new 
ontologies and new epistemologies mirroring the human–Earth relationship in recent centuries.  
 
2.1.3.4 2008–2009: The Double Turn 
 
The year 2008 marked the beginning of an ongoing multidisciplinary and multi-domain surge in interest in 
the ‘Anthropocene’ – witnessed by the corpus as an increase from eighty-seven records in 2007 to 139 
records in 2008, and 190 records in 2009. Multiple disciplines from all fields of knowledge (except formal 
sciences) began using the term as an informal designation for the present, in many ways human-influenced, 
stage of the Earth System. Following this explosion in interest, the sheer number of records reached four-
digit figures during the next decade, and five-digit figures in 2020.136 The total records for the 2008–2009 
period almost equals the sum of all records for all previous years combined. This also means that almost 
half of the corpus is literature published at the end of the decade. As with the previous stages of the modern 
history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, this surge too can be used conventionally to delimit another stage. 
The substantial amount of literature produced during this time period makes navigating such literature (and 
thus the figures and events around it) a daunting task. Therefore, only a few selected publications are 
discussed, each providing a snapshot of the uses of the ‘Anthropocene’ across disciplines and fields of 
knowledge. The selected records do not fully epitomize the different trajectories the term was beginning to 
undertake. Nevertheless, they provide a practical snapshot of approaches to the ‘Anthropocene’ concept at 
the end of the first decade of the century. 
 
Additionally, this brief period at the end of the decade is also defined by a turning point in the 
history of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis – that is, the establishment of the AWG, 
and the publication of the seminal paper “The Climate of History: Four Theses” by environmental historian 
Dipesh Chakrabarty. Both events occurred in 2009, crystallizing a ‘double turn’ of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept – namely, a stratigraphic turn and a humanistic turn. These events are of crucial importance in 
subsequent developments and a surge of interest in the ‘Anthropocene.’ The former defines the moment 
of ‘detachment’ of the ‘geological Anthropocene’ (i.e., the Anthropocene Hypothesis) from the 
‘Anthropocene’ boundary object. This is traceable to the original case made by a group of authors in the 
seminal article published in February 2008 by GSA Today (the journal of the Geological Society of America), 
“Are we now living in the Anthropocene?” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2008b). The article (and the formation of the 
AWG that followed in 2009) was a central driver in the surge of interest that followed in later years. A 
thorough examination of the stratigraphic turn is conducted separately in section 2.2, whilst the humanistic 
turn is considered later in this section. 
 
Most literature produced between 2008 and 2009 exhibits the same pattern identified in previous 
peripheral literature – namely, implementing the ‘Anthropocene’ as a background time category for the past 
 
136 Estimates based on https://www.dimensions.ai/ (accessed on July 19, 2021). See also Figure 2.3(B) above.

200 to 50 years framing localized studies on reactions of fauna and flora to anthropogenic pressures. 
However, a distinct characteristic of literature from late in the decade is that several texts assumed the 
‘Anthropocene’ to be a commonly understood notion. The concept became shorthand for 
anthropogenically driven global environmental change (over the past 200 to 50 years) across a spectrum of 
disciplines – primarily those gravitating around Earth System science, but also environmentally oriented 
disciplines in the humanities, social sciences, and applied sciences. The ‘Anthropocene’ centralized 
previously disconnected and/or independent discourses into a simple and elegant conceptual unit. This is 
a very interesting finding, in that it tells precisely when and how the term transitioned from informal 
neologism to a shared boundary object, and into a functional scientific concept. The network of texts 
‘assuming’ the existence of the ‘Anthropocene’ had yet to fully mature into its present state, where the term 
has fairly wide recognition across academia. Nevertheless, it seems around 2008–2009 that the line between 
epistemic use and background use of the ‘Anthropocene’ blurred: an epistemic use of the term was implicit 
in its background use. 
 
As observed so far, Crutzen was a major force in spreading and popularizing the term throughout 
much of the 2000–2009 decade. Four records feature his name among 2008–2009 records. In 2008, he co-
authored an abstract (Steffen et al., 2008) for a presentation held at the AGU Fall Meeting in 2008,137 
together with Will Steffen, John McNeill, and terrestrial ecologist Kathy Hibbard. The 2008 Fall Meeting 
was held in San Francisco between December 15 and 19, and hosted more than 11,000 participants and 
15,800 presentations (Johnson, 2008). Steffen et al. (2008) was part of the “Earth System Science and 
Education for the Anthropocene II” session, one among plenty of sessions under the Global 
Environmental Change macrosection of the AGU. Geologist and paleobiologist Jan Zalasiewicz (who later 
became Chair of the AWG), paleoclimatologist Alan Haywood, and ecologist Erle Ellis (who became an 
AWG member) were conveners of the sessions. The presentation held by Crutzen and his colleagues 
restated much of what the authors had already advanced a year before in their popular Ambio article (Steffen 
et al., 2007). The session was preceded by a poster session entitled “Earth System Science and Education 
for the Anthropocene I.” Here, the term ‘Anthropocene’ appeared in the title of four abstracts or 
presentations (out of fourteen total) – namely, “Holocene = Anthropocene? The HYDE database for 
integrated global change research over the past 12,000 years” (Goldewijk, 2008), “Stratigraphy of the 
Anthropocene” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2008a), “Warming of the Continents in the Anthropocene” (Davis & 
Chapman, 2008), and “Organic Chemostratigraphic Markers Characteristic of the (Informally Designated) 
Anthropocene Epoch” (Kruge, 2008). The term also appeared in other sessions under different 
macrocategories.138 
 
137 The abstract is available online at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFMGC22B..01S/abstract (accessed

138 Davis (2011) observes that “[a]t its December 2008 Fall meeting in San Francisco, California, the American 
Geophysical Union (AGU) included nine sessions [emphasis added] with Anthropocene in the title, including 
‘Stratigraphy of the Anthropocene’ and ‘Stages Anthropocene: assessing the human impact on the Earth system’” (p. 
78). However, a search on the AGU Abstract Browser (https://abstractsearch.agu.org/about/, accessed on July 18, 
2021) finds only two sessions including ‘Anthropocene’ in the title (both in the Global Environmental Change section) 
– namely, the aforementioned “Earth System Science and Education for the Anthropocene I” and “Earth System 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE 
141 
 
 
The ‘Anthropocene’ had already appeared in previous AGU meetings as early as December 2000 
(see section 2.1.3.1). Presumably, the AGU had become another vector in the spread and popularization of 
the term across scientific discourse throughout the following years. A quick search on the AGU Abstract 
Browser reveals 308 search results for the keyword ‘Anthropocene’ across all abstracts submitted for the 
meetings.139 Despite being relatively low when compared to the number of abstracts submitted for AGU 
Fall Meetings, it still witnesses an increasing interest in and spread of the term through another major 
scientific organization. Most importantly, the AGU became a vector for popularizing the ‘Anthropocene’ 
as a geological concept, not just an Earth System concept. Indeed, by the end of 2008, the ‘Anthropocene’ as 
a possible formal geological unit was beginning to take shape. 
 
Crutzen continued his prolific scientific career by publishing and coauthoring important papers, 
such as a study on the impact of N2O (nitrous oxide) release from biofuel on global warming reduction 
published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (Crutzen et al., 2008; the 'Anthropocene' is not mentioned 
here), and the popular Nature article “A safe operating space for humanity” (Rockström et al., 2009a), 
coauthored with prominent researchers in the Earth System science community including Johan 
Rockström, Hans Schellnhuber, Will Steffen, Robert Costanza, and more. In the latter article, the term 
‘Anthropocene’ appears in the introduction as a background term – defined as the era “in which human 
actions have become the main driver of global environmental change” (p. 472) – and in relation to 
biodiversity loss. While the term is mostly marginal, the fact that it is used in a pioneering study is crucial. 
Indeed, the ‘Anthropocene’ represents that state toward which the Earth is transitioning due to human 
actions. This transition is signaled by overstepping natural ‘planetary boundaries’ – a central concept 
promoted by the authors to “define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the Earth system” 
(ibid.). Exiting this safe operating space (i.e., exceeding planetary boundaries) means entering the 
‘Anthropocene.’ Therefore, the concept of ‘Anthropocene’ found itself interlinked with the concepts of 
‘Earth System,’ ‘sustainability,’ ‘mass extinction,’ and now ‘planetary boundary’ – increasing its semantic 
and epistemic value in framing the most recent ontology of the human–Earth relationship. 
 
The Dutch chemist undoubtedly maintained his role in disseminating the ‘Anthropocene’ concept 
throughout the years. However, by 2008 the concept had acquired its own momentum, appearing in 
disciplines as disparate as medicine, ecocriticism, economics, biology, pedagogy, political science, and more. 
Mostly, the term was implemented by disciplines for time reference purposes. For instance, an article (Plant 
et al., 2008) published by Mineralogical Magazine in February 2008 refers to the “late Anthropocene” (p. 487) 
 
Science and Education for the Anthropocene II.” Presumably, Davis is using the term ‘session’ to mean ‘abstract’ or 
‘panel.’ In this case, eight abstracts or panels with ‘Anthropocene’ in the title appear rather the nine (i.e., Davis & 
Chapman, 2008; Goldewijk, 2008; Joo & Lerman, 2008; Kruge, 2008; Mortyn et al., 2008; Schertzer, 2008; Steffen et 
al., 2008; Zalasiewicz et al., 2008a). The ninth session (i.e., Alpers et al., 2008) alluded by Davis only mentions the 
‘Anthropocene’ in the abstract, but the term does not appear in the title. The original bibliographic reference provided 
by Davis (https://www.agu.org/cgi-bin/SFgate/SFgate) is no longer available. The sessions are discussed later in 
section 2.2.2.

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

as the second half of the 20th century while discussing the health hazards of endocrine disrupting substances. 
The idea that the ‘Anthropocene’ could have begun earlier than the Industrial Revolution had already been 
circulating before the Anthropocene Hypothesis was formulated. 
 
In biology, the term saw light as a background notion to frame localized studies on biota. More 
interestingly, the term also became associated with discourses surrounding a possible sixth major extinction 
event. For example, a research article (Wooldridge, 2008) for the Discussions section of Biogeosciences 
published in June 2008 refers to an “an impending Anthropocene extinction event” (p. 2414) as a possibility 
associated with current CO2 emissions. In Jackson (2008) – an article published by PNAS in August 2008 
– the author writes in the abstract that “the synergistic effects of human impacts are laying the groundwork 
for a comparably great Anthropocene mass extinction in the oceans with unknown ecological and 
evolutionary consequences” (p. 11458). In November 2009, conservationist and ecologist Rodolfo Dirzo 
(2009) stated that that “the Anthropocene is a planetary experiment of sorts, and the experiment is 
providing ample evidence that the human enterprise is an omnipresent driver of contemporary evolution” 
(p. 3041). Indeed, the evolutionary consequences of the ‘Anthropocene’ later became a major discursive 
hub in Anthropocene Studies as well as a marker for stratigraphic research (section 3.1.2.4). This is an 
important finding: the ‘Anthropocene’ was often associated with discourses on anthropogenically driven 
extinctions of biota, and later with research on the anthropogenic sixth mass extinction event. This use of 
the term added another piece to the ‘semantic puzzle’ of the ‘Anthropocene,’ expanding its semantic 
horizon in a way that soon became useful for encapsulating the extent of human impact over the past 50 
to 200 years.  
 
The conceptual link between anthropogenically driven extinction and the ‘Anthropocene’ was a 
gateway for the concept beyond the boundaries of the natural sciences. The humanities began to absorb 
the concept and critically dissect it. Ecocriticism is an example of this, expressing most of its interest during 
these final years of the decade (ten out of twelve records under ecocriticism are published between 2008 
and 2009). In April 2008, environmental humanist Deborah B. Rose published a short piece in The 
Australian Journal of Anthropology entitled “Love in the Time of Extinctions” (Rose, 2008), where she argues 
that “[a] key idea to emerge from the Anthropocene concept is the need for the ecological humanities: we 
need both science and humanities in dealing with the challenges of our time” (p. 82). This remark 
foreshadowed a systematic engagement from the environmental humanities with the ‘Anthropocene’ that 
emerged in the following years – often in the form of critique of its scientific rhetoric. Rose also contributed 
to Issue 47 of the Australian Humanities Review (published in November 2009), introducing the special issue 
Writing in the Anthropocene for the Ecological Humanities section (Rose, 2009). Beside the editors’ 
introduction (Rooney & Smith, 2009), the term appears only marginally in Bastian (2009) and Ryan (2009), 
but has a central role in Rigby (2009). The environmental humanist writes in the opening lines of her 
contribution:  
 
Two words haunt any ecologically attuned consideration of the historical hour in which our increasingly 
globalised world currently finds itself: one, which heads this special issue of the Ecological Humanities, 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN EARLY RESEARCH LITERATURE

is ‘anthropocene’; the other, lurking as a grim potential, or even an unfolding reality, within the notion 
of the anthropocene is ‘ecocide’. The former term implicates us all in a call to responsibility: the future 
of Earth, understood as a diverse collectivity of more-than-human life and the conditions in which such 
life either thrives or fails, we are told, now lies in our human, all-too-human hands. Awesome, and 
certainly burdensome, though the responsibility connoted by this word may be, the latter term is more 
troubling, implicating us, and some considerably more than others, as perpetrators of a crime against 
our Earth others that is at once historically unprecedented and morally unforgivable, and by which we 
too are now imperiled. (p. 173) 
 
The ‘Anthropocene’ represents a challenge “not only for philosophy, but also for literature and other forms 
of art” (p. 176). This challenge is particularly vivid in the relationship humans have established with more-
than-human and other-than-human life; a relationship expressed by increasing rates of anthropogenically 
induced extinctions – the ‘ecocide.’  
 
Philosophy integrated the ‘Anthropocene’ concept into ethical discourses. Allenby (2009) observes 
that emerging “built/human/natural systems of extraordinary complexity” will require an augmentation of 
traditional ethical frameworks, which are currently inadequate to grasp and tackle the degree of complexity 
the ‘Anthropocene’ poses. This reassessment should be conducted on three levels: the personal, the 
institutional, and the macroethical. Although few in number, some writings on environmental ethics found 
marginal use in the term. Botanist Matthew Hal states that “the turn away from arbitrary killing of plants 
helps foster the long-term relationships of care for nonhumans which are needed to counter the human 
appropriation of the Earth in the anthropocene” (p. 181). Indeed, the ‘Anthropocene’ became a key notion 
in subsequent discourses on how to confront ethical dilemmas and challenges posed by the ‘Anthropocene’ 
(e.g., Raffnsøe, 2016; Schmidt et al., 2016; Zylinska, 2014) – especially in the context of an increasing 
conflict between human presence and other living beings (particularly wildlife). 
 
This type of humanistic engagement began transforming the ‘Anthropocene’ into an ethical, social, 
and political category, de facto initiating the ‘humanistic turn’ of the concept. Overall, this turn saw humanists 
and social scientists engaging with the ‘Anthropocene’ as a cultural category. For environmental historians 
in particular, much extant work developed after the seminal contribution of Dipesh Chakrabarty (2009).140 
Published by Critical Inquiry in Winter 2009, the article has been considered “a primary text for 
understanding the problematic nature of the Anthropocene as a cultural category, one that describes a 
 
140 Asked about his first encounters with the concept of ‘Anthropocene,’ and the choice of using the term in his 
seminal publication, Chakrabarty (personal communication, September 6, 2021) recalls: “I was part of several 
conversations at once in the period c. 2003/4 - 2007: with my Australian friends re their unusually prolonged drought 
and water-shortage in the first decade of this century, the like of which I had never seen before in my long relationship 
with Australia since the 1970s; about the 2003 wildfires that destroyed a lot of Canberra and its environs; about the 
natural history of "bushfires" in Australia; reading Tim Flannery's The Future Eaters in that context and hearing a lot 
about climate change in the Australian media and observing how it became a key political issue in their 2007 national 
elections; and an Indian geologist friend directing me to the article "Are we now living in the Anthropocene?" 
published by the American GSA Newsletter in 2008. What had the biggest intellectual impact on me was the point 
then made by many geologists/earth system scientists that humanity had become a geological force changing the 
climatic system of the planet as a whole with devastating impacts on what we regarded as human civilization and 
freedoms. It made me rethink the idea of "human agency" that had, until then, remained a key category in the 
Anglophone social, cultural, and political history that constituted the core of my academic life and training. My first 
article emerged from this set of encounters and was a reflection on how these encounters challenged many of the 
conceptions that undergirded the intellectual traditions within which I worked.”

collective, if unintended, human project whose implications extend far beyond geological inquiries about 
stratigraphic dating” (Emmett & Lekan, 2016, p. 7). It develops four theses based on the idea that the divide 
between human history and natural history (or between human time and geological time) has collapsed with 
the dawn of the ‘Anthropocene.’ The concept appears in the statement of Chakrabarty’s second and third 
theses – namely, “The idea of the Anthropocene, the new geological epoch when humans exist as a 
geological force, severely qualifies humanist histories of modernity/globalization” (Chakrabarty, 2009, p. 
207), and “The geological hypothesis regarding the Anthropocene requires us to put global histories of 
capital in conversation with the species history of humans” (p. 212). In the former, the author discusses the 
notion of ‘freedom’ in light of humans’ geological agency, asking whether the ‘Anthropocene’ poses 
fundamental boundaries to the ‘modern,’ post-Enlightenment conception of freedom. In the latter, the 
author asks how (if any) the category of the ‘human species’ used in the geological ‘Anthropocene’ may 
relate to postcolonial theory – a field of inquiry notoriously skeptical of universal categories.141 Notably, 
Chakrabarty is addressing the “geological hypothesis regarding the Anthropocene” – that is, the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. Such word choice implicitly signals the existence of the stratigraphic variant as 
an entity loosely independent from the broader ‘Anthropocene’ boundary object. This seems to be confirmed 
by the parallel interest in the ‘Anthropocene’ that humanists were developing by the end of the decade, 
forging a notion of broader reach than Earth System science or geology. 
 
Chakrabarty’s paper is situated at the advent of an increasing interest from the humanities in the 
‘Anthropocene.’ It heralded much of the discourse developed within this field of knowledge – from the 
convergence of human and geological history, to the tension between Anthropos (as a cultural being) and 
Homo sapiens (as a biological being), to the role of faith in rationality and science in postcolonial 
historiography. As such, it can be conventionally used as signpost marking the beginning of an ongoing 
interest among humanists in the meaning of the ‘Anthropocene,’ and the predicament it entails. 
 
By the end of the decade, the ‘Anthropocene’ had journeyed vertically and horizontally across a 
spectrum of disciplines, organizations, conferences, journals, workshops, and newspapers. Crutzen’s 
original impetus – propelled by publications or prestigious venues where the term was shared and 
propagated – ensured the ‘Anthropocene’ neologism survived its earliest stages. The IGBP also played a 
crucial role in vitalizing the term, attributing it its original Earth System science connotation. Once the term 
had reached a discrete audience of academically established scholars, these main drivers – Crutzen and the 
IGBP – were no longer necessary for the term to survive and preserve its own momentum. This is also 
confirmed by the fact that the term’s popularity continued to rise after the end of the IGBP initiative. The 
wide news coverage of Paul Crutzen’s death on January 28, 2021 is likely to have further spread the 
‘Anthropocene’ into the popular and academic discourse. The strengthening of global warming and climate 
change narratives in the past two decades further fueled the environmental and social nuances the term 
entailed since its original coinage at the seminal Cuernavaca IGBP-SC meeting. What followed in the 2010–
 
141 The ‘species-talk’ has been a major point of criticism of the rhetoric of the ‘Anthropocene,’ according to several 
environmental humanists. This type of criticism is discussed in section 5.1.1.

2019 decade was an unprecedented growth of interest in the term, witnessed by the range of initiatives and 
publications bearing the ‘in the Anthropocene’ designation in their title. In the present context, this early 
history is crucial in framing the historical context from which the Anthropocene Hypothesis originated and 
evolved into its current status. Its particular history is discussed in the following section.
 
 
2.2 The Geological ‘Anthropocene’ 
 
 
The analysis conducted in section 2.1 provided some resourceful quantitative and qualitative insights 
concerning the historical and conceptual context that preceded and influenced the birth of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. The most relevant findings concerning the early modern history of the 
‘Anthropocene’ are: 
(1) The term did not immediately spread at a rapid pace during its first decade of existence; 
rather, it emerged gradually through different stages. 
(2) The appearance of the term in records primarily belonging to the natural sciences suggests 
a fundamental scientific characterization of the term, complemented by a 
multidisciplinary interest developed by the end of the decade. 
(3) The term had remarkable vertical as well as horizontal reach, appearing in high-profile 
academic events and publications across a wide spectrum of disciplines within the natural 
sciences, social sciences, applied sciences, and humanities. 
(4) Crutzen, the IGBP, and the water science community (i.e., oceanography, hydrology, and 
limnology) were among the main drivers in the survival, spread, and popularization of the 
term during its early research stages. 
(5) The discipline with most records using the term ‘Anthropocene’ is geology, which is also 
the discipline with the highest normalized engagement factor per discipline. 
Findings (2), (3), and (5) are particularly interesting in assessing the status of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept 
in geological literature before its stratigraphic formulation.  
 
Finding (2) shows that the ‘Anthropocene’ was originally conceived within a scientific context. The 
term was deployed in literature mostly as a background notion framing local as well as global studies on 
anthropogenic forcings. However, central literature shows how the term assumed an epistemic function by 
(a) locating a time threshold for a significant shift in the functioning of the Earth System; (b) defining a 
post-Holocene state where fauna and flora has been altered to an unprecedented degree; (c) bringing 
together previously disconnected scientific discourses on human impacts; and (d) stimulating an integration 
of the ‘human factor’ in extant epistemological frameworks for scientific disciplines, thus dispelling the 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
146 
 
human-nature epistemic divide and considering humans as a natural force or agent. These uses of the term 
show that the ‘Anthropocene’ had a particular function in scientific literature, and should therefore be 
treated as a scientific informal (in the literal sense of not being formally defined by any particular discipline) 
category. Only by the end of the decade did the term begin to attract substantial interest from other 
disciplinary domains, complementing the body of literature that was already developing within the natural 
sciences. The scientific origins of the ‘Anthropocene’ are considered a central historical factor in the 
evolution of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Finding (3) shows that the term was not a technical one restricted to a particular scientific niche, 
nor to a particular field of knowledge. While natural sciences deployed the concept more than other 
knowledge domains by a substantial margin, the spectrum of disciplines using the term is remarkable, 
making it a boundary object worthy of different angles of analysis. More importantly, the term was 
perceived as something worth using (either marginally or actively) across the top end of the academic 
hierarchy. Its appearance in high-profile events such as the AGU Fall Meeting, the Dahlem Workshops, 
and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences meetings, as well as in prestigious and high-visibility journals such 
as Nature, Science, PNAS, and more, shows that the term was almost immediately welcomed among the 
‘peaks’ of academia – a circumstance inevitably linked to Crutzen’s own contributions to the term. The 
‘prestigious status’ that the term had already acquired during its early history is considered another factor 
behind the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Lastly, finding (5) shows that dissecting the corpus into records per discipline results in a total of 
99 records for the discipline of geology. Among these, 21 have a relative frequency (Fn) ≥ 2000. This implies 
a normalized engagement factor per discipline (En(D)) of 2.12 – the highest value among disciplines within 
the parameters defined in section 2.1.2.6 (see also Figure 2.11). The margin between geology and other 
high-ranked disciplines (e.g., Earth System science, environmental studies, oceanography, etc.) is not wide 
enough to consider geology as a ‘dominant’ discipline in implementing the ‘Anthropocene’ in texts. 
Furthermore, the label ‘geology’ construed for the present research incorporates several subdisciplines of 
the geosciences that are diverse enough to render ‘geology’ a fundamentally vague category – a shortcoming 
offset by the practical value of using such a label. Nevertheless, because geology is the top ranked discipline 
in terms of records and the discipline with the highest engagement factor, it is worth dedicating a 
circumscribed analysis to this cluster of literature. Indeed, early literature from geology is recognized as 
foreshadowing the question of the utility and meaning of formalizing the ‘Anthropocene’ by showing 
indeed how the term was being used prior to the establishment of the AWG and the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. The question of the utility of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a geological time unit is a pressing one, and 
is tackled again in sections 4.2.3 and 5.2.4. 
 
Thus, section 2.2.1 starts from this body of literature from geology to reconstruct the pre-history 
of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. After this literature has been thoroughly explored, section 2.2.2 frames 
the social and epistemic context wherefrom the Anthropocene Hypothesis stemmed, emphasizing the role 
that the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London played in the formulation of the 

THE GEOLOGICAL ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
147 
 
stratigraphic variant of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Lastly, section 2.2.3 reconstructs the birth of the AWG, and 
summarizes its core activities during its mandate. The AWG represents the main body upholding the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis, and it is therefore a primary source in reconstructing the birth and formulation 
the hypothesis in question. 
 
2.2.1 The ‘Anthropocene’ in Early Geology Literature 
 
Section 2.1.2.3 advanced two main reasons behind geology being the discipline with the highest number of 
records – namely, (1) the geological nature of the term itself implicit in the suffix ‘-cene,’ and (2) the original 
connotation given by Crutzen as a possible (informal) geological epoch. Yet neither is sufficient to explain why 
any geologist would consider using the term. The appearance of a geological neologism does not 
immediately translate into interest in, nor usefulness of, the term in relevant research. If the term was being 
used, it is because it was generally considered suitable and/or useful for a given purpose – e.g., framing a 
particular research topic, providing some time coordinates, or circumscribing a particular state of affairs. 
The literature surveyed in this section aims at demonstrating this point, showing also how some major 
themes in extant ‘Anthropocene’ research emerged organically from the nature of the concept itself. (e.g., 
its beginning, its hierarchical level, etc.).

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
148 
 
 
Besides a slight decreasing trend by 2009, the appearance of the term in geological literature mirrors the 
pace of the term’s appearance in ‘Anthropocene’ early research literature (Figure 2.12). The term gradually 
appeared in a handful of publications during the first half of the decade, while occurring more substantially 
in the second half, especially in 2008 and 2009. 
 
The earliest geology records implementing the ‘Anthropocene’ appear in 2001. Notably, this 
implies that Crutzen and Stoermer’s (2000) seminal article is not defined as a geology record. Indeed, while 
the article is credited as the conceptual cradle of the modern history of the ‘Anthropocene’ – presenting 
for the first time the conjecture that the “the current geological epoch” (p. 17) could be renamed 
‘Anthropocene’ – its overtone and content as well as its publishing source and context are profoundly 
interrelated with the Earth System science framework. The IGBP Newsletter was the newsletter of an Earth 
System science community rather than a stratigraphic community. The article was a product of an informal 
intervention held during an IGBP-SC meeting, where scholars from the Earth System science community 
attended and participated. The proxies used by the authors to delineate a prototypical ontology of the 
‘Anthropocene’ share more with the Earth System and socio-economic trends of the Great Acceleration 
(Steffen et al., 2015) than the stratigraphic properties distinguishing the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
(surveyed in the following chapter), or any other geological time unit. These facts corroborate the 
hypothesis that Crutzen’s original formulation cannot be considered a formal request for stratigraphic 
recognition addressed to the international stratigraphic community. Rather, the suggestion was an informal 
call for scientists in the Earth System science community to address the past 200–250 years as the 
‘Anthropocene’ in order to stress the magnitude and extent of human activities. As seen throughout section 
2.1.3, the community responded positively to this call. 
 
One of the few geology records from 2001 using the term ‘Anthropocene’ is a conference paper 
presented for the joint conference V Reunião do Quaternário Ibérico (REQUI, Fifth meeting of the Iberian 
Quaternary) and I Congresso do Quaternário de Países de Línguas Ibéricas (CQPLI, First Quaternary 
Congress of Iberian Language Countries)142 hosted in Lisbon between July 23 and 27, 2001. The paper was 
authored by climatologists André Berger and Marie-France Loutre (currently the executive director of 
PAGES), at that time both researchers at the Georges Lemaître Centre for Earth and Climate Research 
(TECLIM) of the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. The paper (which analyzes the long-term impact 
of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on climate variability, especially in terms of variability in the 
Quaternary glacial–interglacial cycles) only mentions the ‘Anthropocene’ once in the subtitle – “The past 
and future climate at the astronomical time scale: The anthropocene, a transition between the Quaternary 
and the Quinternary.” The term is only used as a background concept. However, the paper provides results 
concerning “the modelling experiments using different CO2 scenarios both at the geological and human 
 
142 Both REQUI and CQPLI are Portuguese-based Quaternary events organized by Iberian geological organizations 
such as the Geological Society of Portugal (Sociedade Geológica de Portugal), the Portuguese Working Group for the 
Study of the Quaternary (Grupo de Trabalho Português para o Estudo do Quaternário) and the Spanish Association 
for the Study of the Quaternary (Asociación Española para el Estudio del Cuaternario).

time scale” (p. 6), suggesting that at least 40 ka will be “required for the climate system to be no longer 
sensitive to what could happen over the next few centuries” (p. 9). This is an interesting observation because 
it provides early research on the possible geological impact of humans. The human geological legacy has 
become a central topic among scientific debates over the Anthropocene Hypothesis,143 and represents one 
of the aspects distinguishing the hypothesis from the broader ‘Anthropocene’ concept.  
 
Berger and Loutre also published another paper in 2003 (Berger et al., 2003) suggesting that the 
‘Anthropocene’ could be a period-level transition “between the Quaternary and the next geological period 
– the Quinternary? – if the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets would disappear totally” (p. 135). 
Within this proposal, the ‘Anthropocene’ would represent the last epoch of the Quaternary Period, 
preceding the transition to the Quinternary as a new period of geological time. 
 
The ‘Anthropocene’ also appears in Jones (2001), the third chapter of the edited volume 
Geomorphological Processes and Landscape Change. The geographer tackles the term only marginally, but 
anticipating (with remarkable foresight) one of the central questions concerning the ‘Anthropocene’ – that 
is, its beginning:  
 
Exactly when such an Anthropocene should be seen to replace a truncated Holocene is a matter of 
debate, depending on the criteria adopted. Some would undoubtedly advocate ad 1000, which 
roughly equates with the beginning of the industrial cycle of global population growth (Whitmore 
et al., 1990), while others would prefer c. ad 1500, so as to conform with what Roberts (1998) refers 
to as the culmination of the ‘taming of nature’ phase and the commencement of ‘the modern era’. 
However, there is likely to be even greater support for c. ad 1750, approximately corresponding to 
the start of the Industrial Revolution, the commencement of anthropogenically enhanced 
greenhouse gas emissions and the beginning of the ‘The Great Climacteric’ (Burton and Kates, 
1986),[144] an ongoing period which has seen fundamental changes in the interrelations between 
sociotechnical systems and the physical environmental systems, resulting in profound effects on the 
latter […]. Irrespective of the details or the terminology used, it is abundantly clear that a time-span 
as short as the last 1000 years involves consideration of surprisingly great changes in environmental 
conditions due to human activities. (p. 62) 
 
Interestingly, the author does not quote nor cite Crutzen and Stoermer (2000), suggesting that the term was 
already circulating among geological communities as early as 2001. Another interesting aspect relates to the 
chosen starting date after which human activities began to substantially alter the global environment, dating 
at least to 1000 CE. Mentioning ‘The Great Climacteric’ as an ongoing post-industrial phase has an obvious 
similarity to the Great Acceleration, coined only a few years later – once again showing the remarkable 
prescience of this excerpt. 
 
A major contribution to the pre-history of the ‘geological Anthropocene’ is undoubtedly Crutzen’s 
(2002) “Geology of Mankind” (discussed in section 2.1.3.2). This is considered a record from geology in 
 
143 Section 5.2.1 reviews the debate over the geological significance of anthropogenic signals in rocks and strata.

addition to Earth System science. While the article reiterates and polishes some of the theses already 
advanced in the IGBP Newsletter article, stressing ‘geology’ in the title had a remarkable influence on later 
commentators who had used the Nature article as a bibliographic source.145 Indeed, not by coincidence, the 
seminal 2008 article authored by members of the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of 
London (Zalasiewicz et al., 2008b) – a major step in the formulation of the Anthropocene Hypothesis – 
directly mentions Crutzen’s Nature article rather than the IGBP piece, stating that “[i]n 2002, Paul Crutzen, 
the Nobel Prize-winning chemist, suggested that we had left the Holocene and had entered a new Epoch 
– the Anthropocene – because of the global environmental effects of increased human population and 
economic development” (p. 4). Crutzen’s seminal 2002 article is also mentioned in the first newsletter of 
the AWG as the locus of the original suggestion of a new geological time interval (AWG, 2009). It was 
Crutzen (2002) rather than the IGBP Newsletter article that resonated among members of the Stratigraphy 
Commission of the Geological Society of London. 
 
Geologists started using the ‘Anthropocene’ informally, and in different ways, but sharing the basic 
idea of a human-influenced period of time. For instance, in Higginson et al. (2004) – a study on geochemical 
evidence of changes in Arabian monsoons published in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta in 
October 2004 – the ‘Anthropocene’ (appearing once in the abstract) represents a set of conditions under 
which climate operates under the late Holocene. The authors write: “The causes of abrupt change have 
significant implications for understanding future manifestations of similar forcings under late Holocene 
(‘Anthropocene’) boundary conditions” (p. 3807). Interestingly, the ‘Anthropocene’ seems to be equated 
to the later part of the Holocene rather than a truncation of it – suggesting an informal and implicit usage 
of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a ‘sub-epoch’ or ‘age’ of the Holocene. A similar connotation seems to be given 
to the concept by Zielhofer et al. (2004) in a study published by The Holocene in September 2004. The authors 
write: “The synthetic profile comprises late-Pleistocene to mid-Holocene, but not late-Holocene, alluvial units, 
because – at least from antiquity on – distinct human impact (Anthropocene) [emphasis added] on the Medjerda fluvial 
system has to be considered” (p. 852). Technical language aside, the author seems to consider the 
‘Anthropocene’ as the late part of the Holocene, where a distinct human factor is discernible. Again, this 
witnesses a use of the ‘Anthropocene’ as an informal sub-unit of the Holocene (or simply a synonym of the 
Late Holocene).  
 
What is important to highlight about these excerpts is not just the implicit hierarchical level 
attributed to the ‘Anthropocene’ unit, but the utility of the term in identifying a particular time period 
(distinct from the Early to Middle Holocene). In both studies, this period highlights the time when the 
‘human factor’ has become an integral component in circumscribing a particular state of affairs or set of 
conditions – which the ‘Anthropocene’ embodies. In this sense, the concept is given a certain epistemic 
function: that of providing time coordinates for a state shift. 
 
145 This is not to say that the IGBP Newsletter article was less frequently quoted or had less value, but that evidently the 
Nature article had a much wider reach than the former. 

THE GEOLOGICAL ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
151 
 
 
This sample literature embodies much of the informal use geologists and scientists had made of 
the ‘Anthropocene’ during its early research stages. By the end of the decade, some authors were using it 
as a customary term in geological literature. For instance, a 2008 study by De Vleeschouwer et al. (2008) 
published in the Journal of the Chilean Chemical Society states that “very few articles have investigated Holocene 
or anthropocene reconstruction derived from peat bog geochemistry” (p. 1640). The fact that the authors 
neither define the ‘Anthropocene’ nor provide a bibliographic reference suggests that the term was no 
longer a relatively unknown neologism, but rather a term widely understood within their community (i.e., 
geochemistry). Similarly, a 2008 research article by Gabrielli et al. (2008) for Chemical Geology reads: “In 
general there are a lack of studies aimed at evaluating the occurrence of anthropogenic Pt and Ir in the 
atmosphere during the current Anthropocene” (p. 79) – this time citing Crutzen and Stoermer (2000) as a 
bibliographic reference. A striking similarity between these two articles is that they both stress the necessity 
of strengthening Anthropocene-related research. In doing so, they are explicitly demarcating between a 
Holocene and an ‘Anthropocene’ state of affairs – the latter establishing a new regime where humans are 
the central factor.  
 
The ‘Anthropocene’ also appeared in teaching mediums, confirming a sense of utility or suitability 
among researchers using the notion. The term occurs once in the second edition of Introduction to Organic 
Geochemistry (Killops & Killops, 2005) – a textbook for undergraduate and postgraduate students in organic 
geochemistry – in relation to increasing anthropogenic CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the atmosphere, 
where the authors write: “Such rapid changes over the past 200 years have led Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen 
to suggest that we are no longer in the Holocene epoch but the ‘Anthropocene’” (p. 291). In Tectonically 
Active Landscapes (Bull, 2009) – a book on tectonic activity written for graduate students “with an interest in 
geomorphic processes, landscape evolution, and tectonics of plate boundaries” (p. ix) – the author mentions 
the ‘Anthropocene’ twice in the introduction, writing that “[b]oth the Pleistocene and Holocene styles of 
climate change are now history, having been replaced by the Anthropocene” (p. 3). While these textbooks 
may not have been major individual contributors to the spread of the term by themselves, they are a valuable 
witness of the process of assimilation of the term in geological research as well as science teaching (a 
phenomenon observed in other disciplines as well; see section 2.1.3.2). Once again, the term is used to 
identify a transition to a certain state of affairs, from the climate to atmospheric concentrations of 
greenhouse gasses, suggesting that the term had a certain utility as an informal designation.  
 
Another noteworthy appearance of the term is in a 2008 book intended for a popular audience 
entitled The Earth After Us, authored by geologist and future AWG Chair Jan Zalasiewicz. The text 
(published unrelatedly only a year after Alan Weisman’s The World Without Us) explores the human legacy 
in rock records from the viewpoint of a hypothetical future civilization.146 The ‘Anthropocene’ is introduced 
at the end of Chapter 7. Here, the author also discusses the possible hierarchical level best representing the 
degree of changes brought about by human activities, commenting that 
 
146 The text is particularly important in the context of assessing the geological depth of the human footprint. This 
point has been a major hotspot for debate in extant stratigraphy debates on the impact of human activities, and it is 
discussed separately in section 5.2.1. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
152 
 
 
one would lay odds, right now, on the Anthropocene attaining the status of, at the least, a geological 
period. For those who are not completely hung up on our everlasting immortality, a reasonable 
interim aim might be to try very, very hard for the Anthropocene to develop into something no 
greater than an epoch-scale event. That might, just, save a few billion human lives. (p 157) 
 
The question of the hierarchical level of the ‘Anthropocene’ was beginning to take shape as a discrete 
research question, as later advanced by the seminal publication by members of the Geological Society of 
London (Zalasiewicz et al., 2008b). The Earth Without Us exemplifies the spectrum of mediums through 
which the ‘Anthropocene’ was navigating, transgressing the usual mediums of journal articles or newspapers 
to appear in science teaching and communication outlets. 
 
The ‘Anthropocene’ also resonated across geological communities internationally, particularly in 
Europe, but also stretching to the Far East. An article mentioning the ‘Anthropocene’ in Chinese literature 
dates as early as August 2001 (Zhu, 2001), whilst a 2004 contribution in the Chinese journal Quaternary 
Sciences (Tung Sheng, 2004) advocates for dedicated ‘Anthropocene’ research – somewhat foreshadowing 
the subsequent development of Anthropocene Studies. In Japanese literature, the term appears in a report 
(Koji, 2004) of the XVI International Congress of the International Union for Quaternary Research hosted 
in Reno, Nevada, USA between July 23 and 30, 2003; and in a 2004 research article in the Journal of the 
Geological Society of Japan (Murakami et al., 2004) that considers spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) and 
charcoal analysis as “effective techniques for paleoenvironmental study during the era of the 
‘Anthropocene’” (p. 11). While this sample literature is not exhaustive of the reception of the 
‘Anthropocene’ in Chinese or Japanese literature, they show the geographic extent of the spread of the term 
during its early research stages. 
 
The geology records so far surveyed embody ways of using the ‘Anthropocene’ that all share a 
basic property: the term’s utility. Studies on anthropogenic impacts of various types used the term in ways 
that stressed a state shift from previous, Holocene conditions, whether in terms of climate variability, 
atmospheric composition, or other Earth-related aspects. The term was considered useful in encapsulating 
this state shift in an elegant, simple way, simultaneously calling for new approaches in studying this state 
shift event. Being a useful category was a central factor in the assimilation and spread of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
across geological literature. Nevertheless, the term was never canonized in a sense that it was rigorously 
defined – not necessarily as a geological time unit, but as a geological concept in the first place. The 
‘Anthropocene’ remained an informal designation for a period of time that ranged from decades (i.e., 50 
years) to hundreds of years (i.e., 200–250 years) and even millennia (Ruddiman, 2003). Presumably, these 
two factors – namely, the term carrying some degree of utility in geological research and the lack of a formal 
geological definition of the ‘Anthropocene’ – were the implicit circumstances that led a group of geologists (the 
AWG) to consider the formalization of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit. The geological or 
stratigraphic variant of the ‘Anthropocene’ was about to take shape. 
 

THE GEOLOGICAL ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
153 
 
2.2.2 From the ‘Anthropocene’ to the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
 
At what point in the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ did the concept evolve into its stratigraphic variant, the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis? The shaping and emergence of the geological variant of the ‘Anthropocene’ is 
a process that occurred over the span of approximately three years – from the middle of 2006 (when 
discussions of formal ratification began among British geologists) to late 2009 (when the AWG was 
formed).  
 
A conventional date to delimit the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis may be set at a meeting 
of the Geological Society of London Stratigraphy Commission (GSSC) held on May 17, 2006, in the Council 
Room of the Burlington House, a Palladian-style building located at the heart of London and home to the 
five so-called Courtyard Societies of London147 – including the Geological Society (located in the east wing 
of the building). The Stratigraphy Commission (SC) is a national body representing the “appropriate 
professional interests of all British geoscientists” (Geological Sociey of London, 2021, para. 1). It operates 
in close association with the IUGS, and its largest and oldest constituent body, the ICS. The May 17 meeting 
was one of the three yearly meetings of the GSSC, traditionally held in February, May, and October. These 
meetings discuss topics in stratigraphy and provide advice to the Geological Society on various matters, 
while also bringing forth and exploring new ideas. The ‘Anthropocene’ question emerged as an item in 
three GSSC meetings, the minutes of which are hereby used as primary source.  
 
Among the twelve attendees of the May 17, 2006 meeting were Jan Zalasiewicz (then SC Chairman) 
and Colin Waters (SC Secretary). Zalasiewicz had taken interest in the term, having read Crutzen’s Nature 
article, and had begun discussing the term informally with his colleagues as a topic of conversation during 
the Commission lunchtimes. As recalled by Colin Waters (personal communication, October 27, 2020), 
“Jan had asked for this [i.e., a possible ‘Anthropocene’ paper] to be put on the agenda having read the 
Crutzen work on the Anthropocene and thought it might make for an interesting paper by the GSSC.” The 
‘Anthropocene’ was one of the items on the meeting’s agenda. The meeting minutes148 provide a short 
recollection of the final stages of the meeting, when the ‘Anthropocene’ was discussed: 
 
9.4 Anthropocene  
 
[A] raised the issue of overlap with archaeology and that the French had a term Poubellian (plastique 
et sans plastique). It was thought that this paper would be suitable for the Bicentenary celebrations 
of the GS. An alternative slant was proposed, that the term has been proposed, and the paper could 
concentrate on how we as geologists define the base of this epoch. [B] said [they] would circulate a 
paper in press about the definition of the Holocene, where a similar problem of many different 
indicators and the need to fix upon the most suitable.  
 
147 The five societies are the Geological Society of London, the Linnean Society of London, the Royal Astronomical 
Society, the Society of Antiquaries of London, and the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
148 The minutes of the GSSC meetings are not openly available. On request, the minutes discussed in this section were 
made available by the Stratigraphy Commission through the Secretary Colin Waters, and the authors have been 
anonymized by using placeholders (e.g., A, B, C, etc.). 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
154 
 
 
What emerges from the meeting minutes is that there was nothing intrinsically ‘special’ about the meeting, 
nor about the proposal of writing an ‘Anthropocene’ paper. The concept was one topic among many items 
(numbered 1 to 10) that were discussed, ranging from membership and the website to the research affairs 
and publications. The paper suggested by Zalasiewicz (item 9.4) is the last of four publications discussed 
during the ninth item of the meeting, which dealt with GSSC publications. Zalasiewicz’s suggestion to write 
a paper on the topic of the ‘Anthropocene’ was not discussed in detail, but only marginally. As 
acknowledged by Waters, “[t]he entry in the Minutes is far from inspiring, or suggesting it [i.e., the 
‘Anthropocene’] would develop to where we are today” (personal communication, October 27, 2020). 
However, what makes the event particularly important in identifying it as the birth of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis is that it laid the foundations for the groundbreaking GSA Today article later published in 2008, 
which itself prompted the establishment of the AWG. The meeting suggested (although marginally and 
quickly) that the ‘Anthropocene’ could be treated and properly defined as a geological entity. Indeed, Waters 
observes that, “[g]iven that the publication led to Jan being invited to establish the AWG, it could be seen 
as the very earliest stratigraphical discussion of the topic that we are aware of” (ibid.). Ex post, the May 17, 
2006 Burlington House meeting represents the birthplace of the geological ‘Anthropocene’ (Zalasiewicz et 
al., 2018). 
 
By the following GSSC meeting on October 19, 2006, the draft of the GSA Today article had already 
circulated. The draft was discussed as item 6.2 on the meeting’s agenda. The meeting minutes report the 
discussions and actions that ensued from the presentation of the first draft: 
 
6.2 Anthropocene 
 
[A] considered the manuscript was unacceptable and wished to have [their] name removed from 
the authorship. Firstly, Anthropocene means “dawn of man” and so is an unsuitable term. The 
more accurate Anthropogene is a term already used by the Russians for the Pleistocene. [They] also 
felt that the paper overemphasised the significance of what to [them] will become simply a 
stratigraphical marker band. [C] felt the paper was important, if only to demonstrate the deleterious 
impact mankind is having on the planet. [D] felt that the paper needed to be more objective, whereas 
the abstract gave the impression we supported use of the term. [D] also considered it should include 
more references to how the term has been used in recent publications. [E] suggested that mention 
of the atomic testing in the abstract as a possible source for a GSSP should be removed. 
 
There is a clear difference, documented both by the duration and content of the discussion, between the 
May and October meetings. The former only marginally anticipated the idea of drafting a paper on the 
‘Anthropocene.’ The latter saw geologists debating the meaning and importance of a geological 
‘Anthropocene,’ including [A]’s remarks of a terminological nature that foreshadowed one of the central 
lines of criticism against the Anthropocene Hypothesis (see section 5.2.3.1). [D]’s intervention anticipated 
a debate over the mandate and philosophy of the AWG, stressing the necessity of remaining ‘neutral’ in 
assessing the stratigraphic validity of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a geological time unit. A discussion over the 
beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ was also on the table, including the possibility of using atomic bomb 

THE GEOLOGICAL ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
155 
 
testing as a source for a GSSP (which [E] contested). These themes developed in the article published in 
2008. Paleobiologist Mark Williams (personal communication, August 1, 2021) recalls: “I remember strong 
consent in the room for writing such a paper, and only one person not wishing to be involved.” A distinct 
picture of an emerging concept of geological interest materializes from the October meeting, which 
represented another step toward the publishing of the GSA Today article. 
 
The last and final step before the article was submitted for publication was the February 7, 2007 
GSSC meeting. The ‘Anthropocene’ paper appears as item 6.2 on the agenda: 
 
6.2 Anthropocene 
 
It was felt that with some modification the paper could be submitted to Geology. However, there 
was also scope for a significantly trimmed version to go to Nature or Science. Comments on how 
to reduce the text would be appreciated. [F] indicated that the revised text would need to include 
findings from the IPCC 2007 report. [E] suggested that it should also refer to the Stern report 
(2006) and [they] offered to have the figure drafted. [B] would wish to submit the paper before the 
May meeting of the GSSC.  
 
The minutes detail the final actions and recommendations before submitting the article for publication. In 
particular, they recount the possible venues where the article could see light. Three journals were originally 
considered – namely, Geology (a journal of the Geological Society of America), Nature, and Science. Reportedly 
(Zalasiewicz, personal communication, August 9, 2021), the article was first submitted to Geology, which 
considered it to be too philosophical for the more empirical and technical style of the journal. Nature was 
also considered, but the GSSC members foresaw some difficulties in publishing in this journal, including 
the fact that the ‘Anthropocene’ might not have been an ‘exciting’ or news-worthy idea (Gibbard, personal 
communication, July 31, 2021). Ultimately, the GSA Today journal was selected due to its news-like 
approach, its broad reach, its focus on short articles, and for being open access (the latter feasibly a major 
factor in the article’s success). 
 
After editorial adjustments were made and a publisher was selected, the seminal four-page149 article 
“Are We Now Living in the Anthropocene?” by the members of the GSSC saw light in early February 2008 
in Volume 18, Issue 2 of GSA Today. The article denotes a turning point in the history of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ initiating the stratigraphic turn from ‘Anthropocene’ to Anthropocene Hypothesis.150 The 
authors crystallize the Anthropocene Hypothesis in its very first formulation, suggesting that a case could 
be made for the formal recognition of a post-Holocene geological unit – a unit determined by the 
stratigraphic footprint of human actions. The first few lines of the article exemplify this seminal 
formulation: 
 
149 Five pages including the bibliography, and an advertisement of Meiji ML Series Polarizing Microscopes of Meiji 
Techno American. 
150 Davies (2018) has also used “Stratigraphic Turn” as the title of a section of his book The Birth of the Anthropocene 
(pp. 64–68), ascribing this turn to the establishment of the AWG in 2009. In the present approach, the publishing of 
Zalasiewicz et al. (2008) is considered the moment best representing the beginning of the stratigraphic turn of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
156 
 
 
The term Anthropocene, proposed and increasingly employed to denote the current interval of 
anthropogenic global environmental change, may be discussed on stratigraphic grounds. A case can 
be made for its consideration as a formal epoch in that, since the start of the Industrial Revolution, 
Earth has endured changes sufficient to leave a global stratigraphic signature distinct from that of 
the Holocene or of previous Pleistocene interglacial phases, encompassing novel biotic, 
sedimentary, and geochemical change. These changes, although likely only in their initial phases, are 
sufficiently distinct and robustly established for suggestions of a Holocene–Anthropocene 
boundary in the recent historical past to be geologically reasonable. (Zalasiewicz et al., 2008b, p. 4) 
 
The are several aspects that make this article particularly important in the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
and its stratigraphic variant – that is, the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
 
First, there is the fact that the authors suggested that the ‘Anthropocene’ could be treated as a 
stratigraphic concept. As observed in section 2.2.1, geologists and researchers in the geosciences had used the 
term throughout the 2000–2009 decade. The term defined a recent time interval (i.e., generally the past 
200–250 years) characterized by a remarkable anthropogenic impact on the Earth. However, there were no 
institutional attempts in the geoscientific community to provide a formal definition of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
– either as a geological time unit, an event, or a geologically relevant phenomenon. The geologists of the 
GSSC were the first to promote at an institutional level the possibility of approaching the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept on stratigraphic grounds. Their claim was based on the stratigraphic significance of many of the 
anthropogenic forcings that were previously studied by the Earth System science international community 
and were now being translated into stratigraphic terms. Indeed, this claim became one of the three central 
claims of the Anthropocene Hypothesis delineated in section 1.3.2 – that is, Claim 1 (‘Homo sapiens has left 
a discernible stratigraphic signature of significant magnitude in recent geological history’). An ontology of 
the stratigraphic ‘Anthropocene’ was provided in support of this claim, based on a range of signals including 
an increase in human numbers, anthropogenic erosion and denudation rates, perturbation of the carbon 
cycle, temperature rise, biotic changes associated with accelerated anthropogenic extinctions, and an 
increase in ocean levels. This range of stratigraphically significant signals “makes clear that we have entered 
a distinctive phase of Earth’s evolution that satisfies geologists’ criteria for its recognition as a distinctive 
stratigraphic unit” (p. 6). 
 
Second, by advancing that the ‘Anthropocene’ could be treated as a stratigraphic concept, the 
geologists implied that stratigraphic criteria could be used to investigate the geological nature of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ These criteria used to treat the ‘Anthropocene’ as a stratigraphic concept are the same 
criteria used to propose and formalize any geochronological and chronostratigraphic unit on the geological 
time scale. They require assigning a possible unit level to the proposed stratigraphic unit, and locating its 
beginning, or lower boundary, through either a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) or a 
Global Standard Stratigraphic Age (GSSA). These represent chronological methods for selecting the 
beginning of geological units. Methodological technicism aside (discussed separately in section 3.1.2.6), 
what is important to highlight here is the type of criteria originally discussed during the earliest stages of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. These criteria differed from previous and parallel versions of the 

THE GEOLOGICAL ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
157 
 
‘Anthropocene,’ in particular from the original Earth System variant of the concept. They delimitated the 
space of inquiry and semantic horizon of the geological ‘Anthropocene,’ thereafter laying the path for an 
ongoing research trajectory. In doing so, they contributed to the conceptual separation of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis from the ‘Anthropocene’ boundary object, and from the variants that materialized in the 
following years. 
 
A third related fact concerns the unit level that the ‘Anthropocene’ was originally ascribed by the 
geologists of the Stratigraphy Commission. In geological nomenclature, the suffix ‘-cene’ is usually ascribed 
to epochs of the Cenozoic. Crutzen’s original coinage of the ‘Anthropo-cene’ seemed to imply that the 
proposed unit should be already treated like an epoch-level unit – an aspect that has been criticized by some 
geoscientists (see section 5.2.3.1). The geologists of the GSSC embraced this unit level, arguing that “[w]e 
consider it most reasonable for this new unit to be considered at epoch level” (p. 6). While discussions over 
the unit level of the proposed geological unit followed in the next years, the AWG maintained (as of August 
2021) its original stance, considering the epoch-level the most suitable one to represent the stratigraphic 
markers characteristic of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
A fourth aspect that made the GSA Today contribution particularly important is its resonance 
across the academic community as well as the public. The article made the news on several platforms such 
as BBC News (Pease, 2008), New Scientist (2008), Live Science (Britt, 2008), and The Guardian (Lewis, 2009), to 
name a few. Only a few days after the article was published, Zalasiewicz and Williams (also a GSSC member 
at the time) were hosts of a program on National Public Radio (Seabrook, 2008) in the US. The idea of a 
human-determined geological epoch found fertile ground in news and media amidst the increasing urgency 
of responding to anthropogenic environmental threats. Presumably, the article also resonated among 
humanists and social scientists.  
 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis was beginning to take shape, and thereafter to pave its way through 
the academic landscape. At the December AGU meeting in San Francisco (previously mentioned), 
members of the Stratigraphy Commission of London organized two sessions entitled “Earth System 
Science and Education for the Anthropocene I” and “Earth System Science and Education for the 
Anthropocene II” – the former convened by Williams and Andrew C. Kerr along with geographer Navin 
Ramankutty; the later convened by Zalasiewicz, paleoclimatologist Alan Haywood, and geographer Erle C. 
Ellis (who later became an AWG member). Among the posters presented was one entitled “Stratigraphy 
of the Anthropocene,” authored by GSSC members (except for Alan Haywood). In the abstract 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2008a),151 the authors promote the formation of an ‘Anthropocene’ Working Group to 
determine whether the ‘Anthropocene’ could be formalized as a geological time unit: 
 
The Anthropocene is currently an informal unit referring to the current interval of anthropogenic global environmental 
change. Yet, it is being increasingly adopted in scientific literature, and has also attracted widespread public interest 
in underscoring the scale of contemporary environmental perturbation. Possible eventual formalization is the

responsibility of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) and would be preceded by 
formation of an Anthropocene Working Group, best attached to the Subcommission on 
Quaternary Stratigraphy. Consideration of evidence pro and con formalization would take several 
years, and would enter novel territory for such discussions, such as comparison of both deep-time 
and near-present stratigraphic record with evidence of ongoing environmental process, and likely 
also forward-modelling (of sea level, ocean/atmospheric chemistry, biotic composition and so on). 
Consideration of an effective boundary needs also be made, whether or not linked to a Global 
Stratigraphic Section and Point (GSSP), and also of the hierarchical scale of the unit. We here ask the 
ICS to set up an Anthropocene Working Group, without prejudice to the eventual outcome.[152] As in past 
determinations of formal chronostratigraphic boundaries, focussing scientific debate on this 
question would provide valuable data and insights to the wider scientific, and not just to the 
geological, community. (p. 2, emphases added) 
 
The abstract stresses two connected points advanced at the end of section 2.2.1 – namely, the fact that the 
term was increasingly being used, implying that it was invested with some utility in the geological and 
scientific literature; and the fact that the term was still an informal designation, implying that a formal 
definition (as a geological time unit) would be beneficial for the geological and broader scientific 
community. Feasibly, these were epistemic preconditions that motivated geologists to formulate the 
stratigraphic variant of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
The GSA Today article, and the stratigraphic research that ensued, initiated the stratigraphic turn 
of the ‘Anthropocene.’ The short piece resonated across the public and academic circles, championing the 
hypothesis that humans might have left a stratigraphic mark in rocks and strata deep enough to define a 
new, post-Holocene unit of geological time. If this was the case, then a substantial amount of scientific 
research needed to be conducted to either corroborate or disprove the hypothesis. This task required the 
formation of a dedicated Working Group – the Anthropocene Working Group – within the 
Subcommission of Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS). 
 
2.2.3 The Anthropocene Working Group 
 
Working Groups (or Task Groups, capitalized according to the ICS statute) are stratigraphic entities 
appointed within the seventeen Subcommissions of the ICS that primarily focus on locating, characterizing, 
and defining the lower boundaries of geochronological/chronostratigraphic units (see section 3.1.2.6). The 
establishment of a Working Group by a Subcommission follows the general statute compiled by the ICS, 
which provides guidelines for the role, meaning, organization, administration, and functioning of the overall 
organization. Section 7 of the 2017 statute summarizes the structure and purpose of Working Groups: 
 
 
152 Technically, it is not a responsibility of the ICS to establish working groups on particular time units. The 
responsibility falls within the specific Subcommission – in the case of the ‘Anthropocene’ unit, the Subcommission 
of Quaternary Stratigraphy. However, the ICS statute (ICS, 2021) also states that “the Executive Committee also may 
appoint Task Groups for specific tasks that relate to its activities and responsibilities” (para. 7). This might explain 
why the abstract directly addresses the ICS for setting up an Anthropocene Working Group, although the AWG does 
not directly relate to the “activities and responsibilities” of the ICS. 

THE GEOLOGICAL ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
159 
 
Task or Working Groups are organisational bodies for limited, short-term stratigraphic tasks. Task 
Groups are generally organised under individual Subcommissions, but the Executive Committee 
also may appoint Task Groups for specific tasks that relate to its activities and responsibilities. 
Commonly, a Task Group is created for the selection and definition of the lower boundaries of 
chronostratigraphical/geochronological units. Task Groups may also be created for the purpose of 
replacing and/or selecting new boundary definitions, stage units or other stratigraphical units. Each 
Task Group will have a single scientific task. (ICS, 2021, para. 7) 
 
The “limited” duration of a Working Group is a four-year mandate that can be extended for an additional 
four years, making the usual lifecycle of such groups eight years. If additional time is needed, “the Task 
Group should be dissolved and then reconvened at the discretion of the Subcommission Chair” (para. 7.1). 
A Chairman (or leader) and, if needed, a Secretary are selected either by the ICS Executive Committee, or 
by the respective Subcommission, as officers of the Working Group. The number of members should 
“represent regional and/or methodological diversity in an appropriate manner” (para 7.2), and should not 
exceed forty. The terms for officers are four years, after which they can be re-elected and re-appointed for 
only one additional four-year term. Members also have four-year terms of office, which can be extended 
for two mandates of four years each (for a total of twelve years) (para. 9.1). Officers are elected by their 
respective Subcommission or Executive Committee through voting, whilst voting members “are elected by 
its executive, in consultation with existing voting members, and confirmed by the management or executive 
of the ICS body under which the Task Group resides” (para. 9.6). Decisions over scientific and 
organizational matters are made through internal voting, requiring “a sixty percent (60%) majority of 
delivered votes, provided that a quorum of 60% has been attained” (para. 9.7). Working Groups are 
dissolved once their task has been fulfilled (para. 7.5) – for instance, when a group successfully reaches 
formalization of a lower boundary of a geochronological/chronostratigraphic unit on the geological time 
scale. 
 
The idea of forming a Task Group to research the ‘Anthropocene’ as a geological time unit was 
first suggested by Quaternary geologist and current ICS Secretary-General Philip Gibbard, a GSSC member 
and former SQS Chair between 2002 and 2012. Gibbard was not present during the seminal May, October, 
and February meetings, when the ‘Anthropocene’ paper and idea were discussed. However, he had 
discussed the idea of ‘Anthropocene’ with his long-standing friend Jan Zalasiewicz, suggesting (between 
meetings) that he convene a group of individuals to assess whether or not the ‘Anthropocene’ had any 
stratigraphic meaning and value.153 Gibbard felt that the SQS should consider the stratigraphic status of the 
proposed unit, given that the ‘Anthropocene’ idea had gained substantial ground in scientific, and 
particularly geological, literature. As he states (Gibbard, personal communication, July 31, 2021), “if we are 
 
153 Gibbard could not convene the group himself, as his status as Chair of the SQS may have become a conflict of 
interest if he were to be appointed as an officer of the AWG. This is also the reason why Zalasiewicz stepped down 
as Chair of the AWG in 2020 upon being elected as Chair of SQS. 

BIRTH OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
160 
 
not going to do so, who will?”, meaning that no other entity within the ICS (and possibly in the IUGS) 
other than the SQS could have raised the question concerning the ‘Anthropocene’ in stratigraphic terms.154 
 
Formal approval to form an Anthropocene Working Group was granted in the summer of 2009 
(ICS, 2009). The group initially consisted of only three individuals: Jan Zalasiewicz as Chairman of the 
group, Mark Williams as Secretary, and Philip Gibbard as voting member. Gibbard suggested that 
Zalasiewicz be appointed as Chairman of the group. This was a rather intuitive choice, since he pioneered 
the ‘Anthropocene’ idea in the Burlington House meetings and promoted the publication of the seminal 
GSA Today article. Williams was appointed as Secretary “for reasons including practical ones (having the 
office next door to JZ [Jan Zalasiewicz])” (AWG, 2009, p. 3).155 The very limited size of the original group 
required Zalasiewicz and Williams to recruit new members. Williams (personal communication, August 1, 
2021) recalls “many discussions with Jan about who to involve, and as secretary I sent out many of the 
email invitations asking people to join.” By the end of 2009, the group grew to sixteen members, listed on 
the first newsletter of the newly established Task Group (AWG, 2009), published in December. The AWG, 
“the remit of which is to examine the status, hierarchical level and definition of the Anthropocene as a 
potential new formal division of the Geological Time Scale” (ibid.), had officially begun its operations. 
 
What followed from the establishment of the AWG is more than a decade of stratigraphic and 
broader multidisciplinary research on the Anthropocene Hypothesis. The group has been the gravitational 
entity around which discourses on the geological ‘Anthropocene’ have revolved over the past decade. Its 
research has launched multidisciplinary and international interest and critical debates over the meaning and 
utility of an ‘Anthropocene’ geological unit for stratigraphy, for science, and for society overall. The number 
of members has grown substantially over the years, including a diversified pool of researchers from the 
natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences (Lundershausen, 2019). As of August 2021, the group has 
thirty-seven members, including the current Chair Colin Waters, who replaced former Chair Zalasiewicz in 
2020, and Secretary Simon Turner, who succeeded Waters. Communication among members of the group 
has largely occurred through email.  
 
The AWG has had six main meetings at different times and in different locations since its inception: 
• 
Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin, October 16–17, 2014.  
• 
McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, Cambridge University, November 24–25, 2015. 
• 
Fridtjof Nansen Institute, Oslo, April 22–23, 2016. 
• 
Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, September 5–8, 2018.156 
• 
Center for the Gulf South, Tulane University, New Orleans, November 8–9, 2019. 
• 
Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin, September 22, 2021. 
 
154 This is also because the ‘Anthropocene’ was already implicitly being considered as an epoch-level unit, and therefore 
under the responsibility of the SQS.  
155 Both Zalasiewicz and Williams were (and currently are) located at the University of Leicester. 
156 Another meeting at the MPI for Chemistry was held on March 16, 2017. However, only a few members of the 
AWG attended the meeting, which was organized by Paul Crutzen at his home institution (AWG, 2017). 

THE GEOLOGICAL ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
161 
 
During the latest AWG meeting in Berlin, at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, researchers affiliated to the 
group presented preliminary and ongoing findings concerning valid GSSPs candidate for an Anthropocene 
chronostratigraphic unit.157 The meeting (hosted in hybrid form due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics) 
preceded the “Anthropogenic Markers” workshop, organized jointly by the HKW and the Max Planck 
Institute for the History of Science, and held in September 23–24. A major outcome of the meeting will be 
a special publication, to be submitted to Anthropocene Review in 2022, summarizing the major anthropogenic 
markers and signals as well as challenges around each of the proposed Anthropocene GSSP. This will 
constitute a crucial step towards submitting a formal proposal. 
 
The group activity – spanning longer than the normal eight-year lifecycle for Working Groups 
according to the ICS Statute – has produced a vast body of literature on the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
Many publications, volumes, initiatives, and conferences have been organized by members of the group, 
and by researchers gravitating around it.158 Recently, research exploring the organization and functioning 
of the AWG has also been conducted (Lundershausen, 2019; see also PhD research from Alexander 
Damianos and Fabienne Will), further corroborating the important position the AWG invests in the 
broader ‘Anthropocene’ debates.  
 
The research history of the AWG may be condensed in a few landmark publications produce since 
the group’s formation. On March 13, 2011, a volume of the Royal Society of London was published under 
the title “The Anthropocene: A new epoch of geological time?” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2011b), featuring thirteen 
papers focusing on the stratigraphic nature of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Two months later, on May 11, a meeting 
on the ‘Anthropocene’ convened by Mike Ellis, Jan Zalasiewicz, Mark Williams, and Alan Haywood, 
supported by the British Geological Survey, was hosted at the Burlington House. As reported by the AWG 
(2012) newsletters, “the meeting was widely regarded as a considerable success, and resulted in widespread 
publicity (including Nature, with a feature, an editorial and inclusion in their annual roundup of ‘highlights 
of the year’.” The meeting partially motivated the preparation of a special publication for the Geological 
Society of London (AWG, 2013), A Stratigraphical Basis for the Anthropocene (Waters et al., 2014a), published 
three years later in 2014. The volume provided the first extensive stratigraphic and scientific characterization 
of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, outlining the key stratigraphic signals that could ground a possible formal 
definition of the suggested ‘Anthropocene’ geological unit. More recently, the AWG published its latest 
comprehensive scientific summary of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, The Anthropocene as a Geological Time 
Unit (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b). The book provides preliminary scientific evidence in support of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis, which is discussed in the next chapter. 
 
The constellation of activities launched by the AWG is beyond the limits of the inquiry conducted 
in this chapter, whose primary focus was to reconstruct the early modern history of the ‘Anthropocene,’ 
and to frame the theoretical preconditions and social processes behind the birth of the Anthropocene 
 
157 A map of the proposed locations for an Anthropocene GSSP is given later in section 3.1.2.6.

Hypothesis. As such, a thorough investigation of the organization, structure, and operating methods of the 
AWG also falls beyond the reconstruction of the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
 
In the following chapters, the research emphasis is shifted from a historical reconnaissance to an 
investigation of the epistemological nature of the hypothesis. This is assessed based on the latest evidence 
provided by the AWG (Chapter 3), and by framing the epistemic virtues the hypothesis entails from a 
philosophical standpoint (Chapter 4). Lastly, the debate (Chapter 5) surrounding the ‘Anthropocene’ and 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis is framed.

CHAPTER 3 
ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
HYPOTHESIS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have managed to confuse ourselves for years  
with the jargon of lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, chronostratigraphy and the rest.  
In fact it can well be argued that basically there are only two concepts – rocks and time –  
with the rest just an obfuscation of the nomenclature.  
—Derek Ager, The Nature of the Stratigraphical Record 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A distinctive aspect of most scientific hypotheses is their empirical basis. Scientists formulate hypotheses 
based on available observations to explain a certain state of affairs or phenomenon. Observations that 
support a hypothesis attempting to explain a certain state of affairs or phenomenon are traditionally 
understood as empirical evidence for the hypothesis. Empirical evidence plays a central role in science, and it 
is often a major discriminant among scientific hypotheses competing to explain certain phenomena 
(because empirical evidence is never unequivocal) and distinguishes scientific from non-scientific 
hypotheses. It also involves a process of negotiation wherein a community of epistemic actors delimit what 
does, and what does not, constitute evidence for a given hypothesis. As such, ‘evidence’ is a deeply social 
category – in addition to being a philosophically dense concept.  
 
If the Anthropocene Hypothesis represents a scientific hypothesis, then one should expect an 
empirical base for its central claims supported by a certain community. Because evidence does not 
necessarily confirm one hypothesis but multiple hypotheses with conflicting claims – a condition known in 
philosophy of science as ‘contrastive underdetermination’ (Stanford, 2017) –, alternative hypotheses 
competing with the Anthropocene Hypothesis in explaining a certain state of affairs (i.e., the beginning of 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
164 
 
a global anthropogenic stratigraphic signature) are expected. What is, then, the empirical body of this 
hypothesis? What other hypotheses compete with the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and in what ways? 
 
This chapter seeks to answer these questions by exploring the evidence supporting the empirical 
structure of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and alternative and competing hypotheses to the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. Section 3.1 investigates the stratigraphic basis of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. The epistemic 
context of stratigraphic classification is illustrated, and the evidence gathered thus far (primarily by research 
revolving around the AWG) is discussed. This is accomplished by framing such evidence against the 
standards of stratigraphic classification defined by international guides and research protocols, and by 
surveying the different types of stratigraphic evidence supporting the claim for formal recognition of the 
Anthropocene as a geological time unit.  
Subsequently, section 3.2 tackles one of the most discussed and important aspects of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis, and perhaps of the overall ‘Anthropocene’ debate: the beginning of the 
Anthropocene as a geological time unit, and as a concept of scientific utility. While this aspect has been 
framed by humanists and social scientists in terms of its broader social, political, and ethical importance, 
determining the beginning of a time unit on the international chronostratigraphic chart (and geological time 
scale) represents a necessary epistemic requirement to the formalization of any chronostratigraphic and 
geochronological unit. As such, it follows strict stratigraphic guidelines and protocols – to which the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis must adhere in order to be considered a stratigraphic hypothesis. This aspect is 
tackled by conducting a critical survey of the proposed starting dates for the Anthropocene as a geological 
time unit. Each provides different methods and empirical evidence for promoting possible starting dates – 
some even challenging a chronostratigraphy-based definition of ‘Anthropocene.’ 
The central scope of this chapter is not to determine whether the Anthropocene Hypothesis is true 
or false – that is, whether or not a lower boundary of an anthropogenic stratigraphic nature could be located 
around the 1950s; nor is it to determine whether or not the evidence gathered by extant research justifies 
formal recognition on the geological time scale. Rather, it seeks to show how the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
represents a scientific hypothesis based on the type of empirical evidence it advances. This requires 
conducting ‘anatomical’ work – that is, dissecting the body of empirical evidence that informs the 
Anthropocene as a geological time unit, and discussing those alternative hypotheses at the center stage of 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis debate.  
 
 
 
 
 
 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
165 
 
3.1 Stratigraphy of the Anthropocene 
 
 
Chapter 2 illustrated how the ‘Anthropocene’ idea transitioned from a loose scientific term to an 
overarching category for environmental discourses among the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, 
and arts. One among the many research trajectories developed within Anthropocene Studies occurred 
within stratigraphy, or more precisely, within chronostratigraphy and geochronology – two interlinked 
branches of stratigraphy dealing (among others) with the reconstruction of geological time. The process 
leading to the formation of the AWG in 2009 provides a practical signpost delimiting the institutionalization 
of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, after which dedicated geological research has increasingly evolved into 
its present status. 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis is one of many different formulations of the ‘Anthropocene’ within 
Anthropocene Studies. It is also one among different formulations within the natural sciences. In Earth 
System science – the disciplinary cradle of the ‘Anthropocene’ – the term reflects the increasing 
anthropogenic impact on Earth System functioning, from the steep increase in socio-economic and Earth 
System trends of the Great Acceleration (Steffen et al., 2015; Steffen et al., 2011b; Steffen et al., 2004c) to 
the planetary boundaries for sustainability (Rockström et al., 2009a; Rockström et al., 2009b). As seen, the 
IGBP played a crucial role in circulating the idea among multidisciplinary communities of scientists and, 
later, humanists and social scientists as well. In this context, the ‘Anthropocene’ represents a phase or stage 
of the Earth System, perhaps best represented by the surge in energy consumption across human societies 
since the Industrial Revolution and particularly since the Great Acceleration along with its implications for 
the Earth System (Syvitski et al., 2020). This multidisciplinary approach, stemming from the relatively new 
discipline of Earth System science, allows us to consider human societies as an integral part of the Earth 
System – breaching an already contested but longstanding dichotomy of humans and nature by representing 
humans as part of nature itself.  
The ‘Anthropocene’ in Earth System science is very close to the stratigraphic Anthropocene. In 
fact, the AWG has argued that the “geological interpretation of the Anthropocene complements the ESS 
[Earth System science] interpretation” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019a, p. 324). This is not simply because 
members of the Earth System science community often share results, research material, platforms, and 
institutions with researchers on the Anthropocene Hypothesis (e.g., Steffen et al., 2016). It is also because 
anthropogenic activities altering the function of the Earth System may translate into geologically significant 
evidence. The AWG has stressed that “the significance of the Anthropocene lies not so much in seeing 
within it the ‘first traces of our species’, but in the scale, significance and longevity of change to the Earth 
system” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2015b, p. 201). More recently (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019a), the group stated that 
“[t]he Anthropocene as an ESS and a chronostratigraphic unit [emphasis added] recognizes dramatic changes 
to the Earth System, using the same criteria that delineates any other previous epoch” (p. 326). Both 
excerpts suggest that, while also adopting the traditional standards of stratigraphic classification (illustrated 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
166 
 
throughout this chapter), the Earth System science evidence plays a central role in defining the 
Anthropocene as a stratigraphic unit. The abrupt changes in the functioning of the Earth System that have 
occurred over the past 250, and especially over the past 70 years, represent a marked event horizon that is 
unprecedented in human as well as geological history, and in the history of the Earth System. This horizon 
may be used to locate a boundary in the stratigraphic record reflecting these changes. This means that 
aspects of recent shifts in the Earth System are reflected in stratigraphic research, and vice versa – 
witnessing the close conceptual partnership between stratigraphy and Earth System science.  
In evolutionary biology and ecology, the term has been widely associated with increasing extinction 
rates (Barnosky et al., 2011; Ceballos et al., 2015; Ceballos et al., 2017; Pimm et al., 1995), reportedly 
associated with increasing and global-scale human niche construction activities (Ellis, 2016b; Ersten et al., 
2016; Fox et al., 2017; Kendal et al., 2011a, 2011b; Laland et al., 2001; Smith & Zeder, 2013). This literature 
suggests that evolutionary processes have been dramatically altered by the establishment of “new 
evolutionary pathways created by human hyper-dominance as a ‘hyperkeystone’ species” (Pena Rodrigues 
& Lira, 2019, p. 141). Understanding the contemporary biosphere is not possible without including the 
human factor as a structural component of the present status of life on Earth – although the human-
biosphere-ecosystems represents a complex relationship that poses practical difficulties in modelling (Ellis 
& Ramankutty, 2008). While Homo sapiens, like any other organism, has been altering its environment 
throughout its existence as a species, it is only recently that its collective actions have become a driver for 
biological and ecological change. The first signs of anthropogenic influence on the biosphere can be dated 
to the extinction of the mammalian megafauna during the Late Pleistocene, between 50 to 12 thousand 
years ago (DeSantis et al., 2019; Doughty et al., 2010; Haynes, 2018). Forest clearance and land conversion 
to agriculture during the Neolithic Revolution further expanded human niche construction activities. With 
increasing population and energy demands over time, “[h]umans have fundamentally altered global patterns 
of biodiversity and ecosystem processes” (Ellis & Ramankutty, 2008, p. 439) and established new ecological 
domains that the environmental scientist (and AWG member) Erle Ellis and geographer Navin Ramankutty 
defined as ‘anthropogenic biomes’ or ‘anthromes’ (ibid.). As later discussed (section 3.1.1.4), the ‘sixth 
extinction event’ in the history of life (Kolbert, 2014) is relevant in the context of biostratigraphy – one of 
the types of stratigraphic records left by the human species.  
There is a necessary connection between different knowledge domains within the natural sciences 
in approaching the ‘Anthropocene.’ This is a consequence of the ontological breadth of this concept, 
encompassing a range of phenomena that can be observed, elaborated, and formulated based on the specific 
disciplinary stance one is located within. However, to investigate the very evidence and epistemology of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis, it is paramount to differentiate it from other similar or overlapping narratives 
from the natural sciences, or within Anthropocene Studies. One way of doing this is reiterating the 
argument that the Anthropocene Hypothesis represents specifically the stratigraphic formulation of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ Alternative scientific interpretations of the ‘Anthropocene,’ such as those from Earth 
System science and evolutionary biology, are not bounded to the claim of recognition of the Anthropocene 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
167 
 
as a geological time unit in the same way the Anthropocene Hypothesis is. The fact that Homo sapiens has 
left a discernible stratigraphic footprint (Claim 1), and that this footprint may see geological formalization (Claim 
2 and 3), are the central claims that distinguish the Anthropocene Hypothesis or stratigraphic Anthropocene 
from other scientific and non-scientific interpretations of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
Therefore, the following section delineates what evidence makes the Anthropocene Hypothesis a 
hypothesis of a stratigraphic nature. Rather than passively listing a collection of research material, the nature 
of the evidence so far advanced is also critically discussed. This analysis is particularly important for two 
reasons.  
First, by providing an overview of the actual research material and types of evidence, it shows that 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis – regardless of one’s personal position on it – is a scientific hypothesis 
worthy of philosophical, and especially epistemological, analysis. While this may seem trivial, the absence 
of a philosophy of science in Anthropocene Studies, and accusations of hidden political agendas (Finney & 
Edwards, 2016), make it necessary to stress this point. This analysis complements the theoretically oriented 
analysis later conducted in Chapter 4.  
Second, if the stratigraphic ‘Anthropocene’ constitutes a discrete instance of geological reflexivity, 
then its defining content and structure should be exposed in a way that makes it unique and substantially 
distinguishable from genealogical precursors – such as the ‘Anthropozoic’ or the ‘Noosphere.’ The 
historical (Chapter 2), empirical, and theoretical (Chapter 4) context of the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
suggests that this is the case. 
 
3.1.1 Geological Claim and Stratigraphic Claim 
 
Before moving on to surveying the material and research context of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, a 
preliminary remark concerning the nature of its claims is considered necessary. 
Two implicit and seemingly identical claims concerning the scope of the ‘Anthropocene’ have been 
formulated and adopted in Anthropocene Studies (whether in the natural sciences, social sciences, or the 
humanities). Let us identify them as the ‘geological claim’ and the ‘stratigraphic claim,’ and define them as 
such: 
 
Geological Claim (GC): Humans have become a significant geological force, equal in 
extent to the geological forces of nature, such as erosion, volcanism, seismic activity, or 
glaciation.159 
Stratigraphic Claim (SC): Homo sapiens has left (and is leaving) a discernible stratigraphic 
footprint that may be used to define the beginning of a new geological time unit. 
 
159 For examples of geological forces, see https://www.nps.gov/subjects/geology/geology-concepts.htm (accessed 
on August 8, 2021); and http://www.discovergrandteton.org/teton-geology/geologic-forces/ (accessed on March 24, 
2021). 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
168 
 
The first argument promoted here is that these two seemingly equivalent claims should be separated. 
Although they share a causal connection (SC is a consequence of GS), they mean different things. This has 
also been recognized by philosopher of science Carlos Santana, who argues that “[a]sking whether the 
Anthropocene should be designated a new epoch is not the same as asking whether humans are significant 
geological agents” (Santana, 2019a, p. 1075). Locating this subtle difference is difficult, especially since both 
claims often overlap or appear simultaneously in extant literature (Carrington, 2016; e.g. Crutzen & 
Stoermer, 2000; Steffen et al., 2007; Steffen et al., 2011a; Vaughan, 2016). SC is a consequence of GC 
because the stratigraphic footprint of Homo sapiens is a direct consequence of its geological action. In fact, 
most related literature has underscored that we have entered the Anthropocene because we have become a 
geological force – differing in opinion on when humans turned into a geological force. However, it seems 
they express different things about humans and their role on the Earth and in its history – GC interpreting 
human actions in terms of their broader geological significance, and SC interpreting human actions in terms 
of their specific stratigraphic magnitude. 
 
The second argument promoted is that SC (rather than GC) is the explicit claim of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. This is consistent with Claim 1 of the Anthropocene Hypothesis – that is, ‘Homo 
sapiens has left a discernible stratigraphic signature of significant magnitude in recent geological history.’ 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis does not directly advocate for GC, but rather considers GC as an empirical 
assumption to advance SC. In these terms, GC is a substantially different statement than observing that 
human activities are discernible on a stratigraphic (and particularly geochronological/chronostratigraphic) 
level because it centralizes the discussion over humans’ geological agency rather than stratigraphic footprint 
(and its utility as a geological time unit). It requires a different line of reasoning and investigation, and is 
thus assumed in the Anthropocene Hypothesis. It seems intuitive to infer that, in order to leave a stratigraphic 
signature, a species must attain some sort of ‘geological power’ to imprint such a mark.160 Yet, assessing 
whether a species holds geological agency is a different theoretical endeavor than defining its stratigraphic 
footprint in order to establish a geological time unit. Feasibly, a discrete discussion on the geological agency 
of Homo sapiens should be approached in terms of ‘theoretical geology’ – namely, by defining what represents 
a ‘geological force.’ 
 
Because GC informs SC as an assumption, GC requires a few additional remarks. 
GC is not an utterly new claim in the domain of geology. It had already seen light as early as the 
late 18th century, with the writings of Comte de Buffon. It saw early instances of recognition in the 
geological work of Thomas Jenkyn (Lewis & Maslin, 2015a) and Antonio Stoppani (Federighi, 2013), who 
both used the term ‘Anthropozoic’ during the 19th century. Within Anthropocene Studies, GC is rooted in 
Crutzen and Stoermer’s seminal IGBP article, where the authors claimed that “mankind will remain a major 
geological force [emphasis added] for many millennia, maybe millions of years, to come” (Crutzen & Stoermer, 
2000, p. 17). Crutzen further reiterated GC in later publications, writing that “[h]umankind is bound to 
remain a noticeable geological force, as long as it is not removed by diseases, wars, or continued serious 
 
160 This point may be inverted: that is, a species could be attributed geological agency because of its stratigraphic mark.

destruction of Earth’s life support system” (Crutzen, 2002a, p. 4).161 Together with Will Steffen and John 
R. McNeill, Crutzen wrote in 2007 that “[h]uman activities have become so pervasive and profound that 
they rival the great forces of Nature” (Steffen et al., 2007, p. 614). In his article “The Climate of History,” 
Chakrabarty (2009) also addresses humans as a “geological force” (p. 206). Later, in a 2018 interview 
conducted by Shiraz Sidhva for the UNESCO Courier, the environmental historian claimed that “[w]e have 
somehow acquired the role of a geological force [emphasis added] − thanks to our pursuit of technology, 
population growth, and our capacity to spread ourselves all over the planet” (p. 12). The claim that humans 
have become a geological force has been by then largely and almost passively assumed as a cardinal tenet 
in Anthropocene Studies, and literature implementing this label is abundant. It is plausible that this linguistic 
label is more than a metaphorical device. 
Is it true that humans parallel, if not exceed, the effects of geological forces? This statement seems 
quantitatively true, but it requires further considerations. Geological literature commonly recognizes plate 
tectonics, volcanism, erosion, glaciation, or heat from the Earth’s interior as examples of endogenous 
geological forces (examples of exogenous forces are the Sun’s radiation, gravity, or asteroid collisions). These 
are forces that have been operating on billion-year scales, and have shaped the life-hosting planet Earth as 
we know it. For instance, plate tectonics has been operating on the Earth’s lithosphere for the past 3.3–3.5 
Ga (Sobolev et al., 2019) and is the main force responsible for the creation of mountains and oceans, as 
well as being a crucial driver behind chemical cycles such as the carbon cycle (Poli, 2015). A strong link 
between plate tectonics and the origin of life has been suggested (O'Neill, 2016). Another example is 
volcanism, which has been operating even before the onset of plate tectonics. The action of volcanism led 
to modifications of soils, water, and the atmosphere that were crucial for the development of life, and its 
role in heat transfer from the Earth’s inner core is necessary in maintaining Earth System stability. Lastly, 
life itself, primarily through photosynthesis, has been an active geological force that has been shaping the 
Earth’s surface and atmosphere for billions of years. Without photosynthesis, most extant life would not 
be possible, meaning that life overall can be considered a geological force (Westbroek, 1991) – with some 
species, such as Homo sapiens, developing a more prominent, yet transient, role as geological actor. 
Geological forces are those structural forces operating on a planetary level on billion-year timescales, 
and that have made the Earth the only planet observed so far to harbor complex life. Thus, there is an 
intrinsic link between geological forces and life. Planets with no or few geological forces harbor no life – 
they are dead planets. To claim that humans have become a geological force means that humans hold the 
 
161 As previously noted in section 2.1.3.2, Crutzen (2002b) wrote that “mankind will remain a major environmental force 
[emphasis added] for many millennia” (p. 23), switching the tone from ‘geological’ to ‘environmental’ in a seemingly 
equivalent fashion. This difference has also been noted by philosopher of science Jay Foster (2018), who similarly 
questions the status of humans as geological forces. However, the use of ‘global environment’ or other ‘environment’-
related terminology in association with the Anthropocene has been criticized by Hamilton (2015), who sees Crutzen’s 
terms as open to possible misleading interpretations regarding the scope of the Anthropocene. However, Hamilton is 
not championing the geological nor the stratigraphic claim – his third view emphasizes the role of the Anthropocene 
in the Earth System framework. The reasons why Crutzen decided to use ‘environmental force’ rather than ‘geological 
force’ may be due to editorial choices, or a choice of reflecting the bigger environmental narrative – the latter being 
consistent with the normative content that Crutzen hoped to deliver with the new term (Dalby, 2016).

same ontological status as plate tectonics or volcanism. While this may appear to be the case from 
quantitative analysis (e.g. in terms of energy flow, see McNeill & Engelke, 2014; Syvitski et al., 2020), Homo 
sapiens does not have the same ontological significance as geological forces. The absence of plate tectonics, 
volcanism, glaciation, erosion, and so forth is not equal to an absence of Homo sapiens. Without ‘traditional’ 
geological forces, complex life – and thus the very existence of Homo sapiens – would not be possible. The 
Earth would very likely resemble other inhospitable planets of the Solar System. However, the same cannot 
be said of the absence of Homo sapiens. Although humans are agents of vast biological and evolutionary 
change, including the manipulation of genomes and human-induced speciation, they are (still) only a 
transient organism in the history of life on Earth. Therefore, to claim that humans equal and/or exceed the 
power of geological forces may be true only on a restricted time scale, and only where ‘geological’ implies 
an effect on the Earth System, and on the global environment. As a structural feature of the Earth, humans 
can hardly be considered a structural geological force. However, Homo sapiens could be considered as part of 
the geological force represented by biological life itself, and as a transient geological force capable of changing 
the direction of Earth’s geological history.162  
To claim that, strictly speaking, humans are not geological forces is not to say that humans are not 
geological/geomorphological agents, nor that they do not operate on the same scale as geological processes – 
a further distinction that needs to be made. The deliberate annual relocation of material by humans (570 
megatons/year) exceeds ocean sedimentation processes by rivers (220 megatons/year) by a factor of three 
(Douglas & Lawson, 2001). Landscape-forming is now conditioned by both natural and anthropogenic 
processes in terms of impact and rate (Price et al., 2011). Human-induced erosion corresponds to “an 
amount ~10 times that imposed by glaciers, rivers, and other natural processes combined” (Wilkinson, 
2005, p. 163), alongside significant rates of anthropogenic denudation mostly associated with agricultural 
practices (Wilkinson & McElroy, 2007). This data snapshot shows that humans in fact equal or exceed in 
quantitative measures the action of the geological forces that shape the Earth. Yet, because they are not an 
intrinsic driver of planetary changes on a billion-year scale, and thus are not necessary for life as such in the 
way some other geological forces are, humans should be considered geological agents rather than geological 
forces. Chakrabarty (2009) argues that “[t]o call ourselves geological agents is to attribute to us a force on the 
same scale as that released at other times when there has been a mass extinction of species” (p. 207). This 
attribution is quantitative, meaning that humans exhibit similarities to geological forces in the way they 
interact with the environment – as illustrated by the data above. However, the attribution is not qualitative, 
in the sense that humans are the same as geological forces.  
While extant literature (including Chakrabarty, 2009) often interchanges ‘agents’ and ‘forces’ 
(mostly using these labels as rhetorical devices or metaphors to convey a normative message, rather than a 
descriptive analytical category), the theoretical impasse has been recognized by a few scholars. For instance, 
Clive Hamilton (2017) argues that “[h]umankind is perhaps better described not as a geological force but 
 
162 This argument may also be another reason why Crutzen (2002) decided to use the term ‘environmental force’ rather 
than ‘geological force.’). 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE

as a geological power, because we have to consider its ability to make decisions as well as its ability to 
transform matter. Unlike forces of nature, it is a power that can be withheld as well as exercised” (p. 6). 
While he emphasizes the role of conscious agency, the attribution of geological agency hereby advanced is 
rather based on the ontological place of humans on the Earth, with particular regard to geological time. A 
similar distinction (aimed at tackling the question of causality in the Anthropocene) has also been advanced 
by Thomas et al. (2020), who distinguish between ‘forcing’ – a “perturbation in a system” that “does not 
suggest that there is will or intention behind the disruption” (p. 13) – and ‘forces’ – the normative and 
historically oriented category implying “happenstance, inevitability, and intention” (ibid.) – in analyzing the 
complex interplay of both in engendering the Anthropocene. This literature shows the epistemological 
advantages of delineating by means of conceptual clarity the ontological status of Homo sapiens. This is 
particularly useful to avoid criticism of ontological anthropocentrism, as shall be analyzed in section 5.1.2.163 
There are further characteristics distinguishing GC from SC. To represent a geological force does 
not immediately translate into the domain of stratigraphy. Geological forces have been active underlying 
processes throughout most of the Earth’s history (a theoretical postulate known in geology as the 
Uniformitarian Principle). They represent the cause of major global phenomena (e.g., massive volcanic 
eruptions, climate change, magnetism, migration of species, etc.) whose effects are left in the stratigraphic 
record. Ultimately, this record is used to divide geological time in a useful and meaningful way. Hence, 
geochronological/chronostratigraphical recognition is a different theoretical ground and endeavor than 
assessing what does or does not constitute a geological force. SC is mostly concerned with the stratigraphic 
basis of an Anthropocene time unit – namely, whether humans have left a substantial stratigraphic mark in 
geological records detectable by present or future geologists, and whether this mark should be represented 
on the geological time scale. Stratigraphy investigates a spectrum of several material and non-material 
properties of rocks and strata that can be correlated and used to reconstruct the Earth’s geological history. 
It does not (at least directly) raise questions of humans’ geological agency insofar as anthropogenic 
sediments represent the main object of analysis (i.e., there could be substantial anthropogenic sediments 
without ascribing humans the status of geological force).  
Another aspect distinguishing SC from GC is the question concerning humans’ geological legacy 
from a ‘future geologist perspective.’164 This is represented by a hypothetical scenario used to either validate 
or invalidate the Anthropocene Hypothesis by asking whether or not a future geologist (from hundreds to 
millions of years in the future) will detect a global and seemingly synchronous165 anthropogenic stratigraphic 
signature. The idea that future geologists might detect a boundary horizon in the stratigraphic record by the 
19th or 20th century is a recurrent argument in ‘Anthropocene’ literature. Yet this thought experiment does 
 
163 The descriptive statement that humans are not geological forces, but rather geological agents, should not be confused 
with the normative ‘No-Problem View’ (Leinfelder, 2013) – that is, the stance that “[h]uman behavior is irrelevant 
because natural processes such as volcanoes and weather patterns are claimed to be stronger than any of the effects 
that human industry might have” (p. 17). This view has been overwhelmingly considered detrimental to social 
environmental responsibility, and thus reject by scientific as well as humanistic scholarship. 
164 This mental experiment is discussed thoroughly in section 5.2.1. 
165 Synchronicity (i.e., the approximate same age of a stratigraphic unit) is a requirement for determining a new 
chronostratigraphic unit by using a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP; see section 3.1.2.6). 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
172 
 
not ask whether a future geologist will consider Homo sapiens as a geological force.166 Rather, it asks whether 
or not it is possible and plausible for a future observer to recognize a discrete and unique ‘Human Stratum.’  
One last note concerning SC may be due. The idea that humans may leave a stratigraphic footprint 
is also not completely new in geological literature. In the 19th century, geologists already used archaeological 
records as evidence for the latest strata of geological time (although they operated within a substantially 
different framework than present geological research). For instance, beer bottles and cans had been used 
by the American geologist Charles Butler Hunt (1906–1997) to date sediments in Western North American 
mining camps during the 1950s (his 1959 geology text goes by the title Dating of Mining Camps with Tin Cans 
and Bottles). As recalled by Ager (1973), a humorous French classification of the upper Holocene 
distinguished between an Upper Dustbinian (with plastic) and a Lower Dustbinian (without plastic).167 
Anthropogenic material constitutes a substantial portion of the evidence supporting the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. This evidence builds a case for official recognition of the Anthropocene as a geochronological 
and chronostratigraphic time unit. It also delineates the epistemological profile of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis – further corroborating the conceptual separation between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. Additionally, new and ‘unorthodox’ evidence – that is, evidence of a very recent 
and unprecedented nature, such as new anthropogenic minerals – has been provided by members of or 
researchers affiliated with the AWG, evidence whose epistemology has been criticized both by humanists 
and scientists. This aspect too further corroborates the claim that the Anthropocene Hypothesis constitutes 
an object of interest for the philosophy of science, specifically the philosophy of geology.  
The distinction between GC and SC is important in framing the purpose of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. The hypothesis does not seek to describe or explain whether or not Homo sapiens has become 
a geological force or agent, but rather if our species has left discernible and substantial stratigraphic evidence 
to locate the beginning of a new unit of geologic time. This is an important theoretical postulate to keep in 
mind when assessing the evidence gathered in support of the hypothesis.  
 
3.1.2 Context and Evidence 
 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis bases on a body of evidence defined within a certain disciplinary context. 
This epistemic context is represented by geochronology and stratigraphy. Like any other disciplinary 
domain, this context is characterized by rules, methods, and objects of research that, besides differentiating 
it from other epistemic contexts within and outside the natural sciences, also set the standards or ‘paradigm’ 
(Kuhn, 2012) for extant research. In the stratigraphic community, these standards are generally embodied 
 
166 If Homo sapiens will be extinct by the time of a future hypothetical observer, it will be unlikely that the observer will 
recognize our species as a geological force – given the definition and examples of geological forces previously outlined 
in the section. This does not imply that a future geologist will not detect any stratigraphic signals associated with Homo 
sapiens.

by the International Stratigraphic Guide (ISG, or simply Guide), which functions as an international reference 
framework for stratigraphic classification, terminology, and procedures. 
The first edition of the Guide was published in 1976 by the former International Subcommission on 
Stratigraphic Terminology (ISST, now the International Subcommission on Stratigraphic Classification, 
ISSC), and edited by the American geologist Hollis Dow Hedberg (1903–1988), a key figure in promoting 
a unified framework for international stratigraphy. A second edition edited by Amos Salvador (1923–2007) 
was published in 1994, including new sections and further strengthening the terminological and procedural 
framework. The principles provided in the Guide are implemented by the ICS and the IUGS, of which the 
ISSC is part of. As part of the ICS, the AWG adheres, among other things, to the guidelines advanced in 
the Guide to propose the ratification of a geologic time unit in the Geologic Time Scale. The goal of the 
Guide is briefly highlighted in its Chapter 1, section D: 
 
The Subcommission [on Stratigraphic Classification] offers its International Stratigraphic Guide as a 
recommended approach to stratigraphic classification, terminology, and procedure – not as a 
“code.” Individuals, organizations, or nations should not feel compelled to follow it, or any part of 
it, unless convinced of its logic and value. Stratigraphic classification, terminology, and procedure 
should not be legislated. Real and lasting progress will be achieved only as geoscientists voluntarily 
agree on the validity and desirability of certain principles, procedures, and terms. The purpose of 
the Guide is to inform, to suggest, and to recommend; it must continually evolve in keeping with 
the growth of geologic knowledge. (Salvador, 1994, p. 4) 
 
The Guide does not constitute a binding protocol, but is rather the outcome of long-sought efforts to create 
a coherent and consistent set of guidelines across geological communities worldwide. Because of its central 
role in creating a shared epistemology of stratigraphic research, the Guide (and its abridged version, Murphy 
& Salvador, 2000168) is hereby used as a first major source to investigate the epistemic context of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. Additionally, the definitions and principles stressed by the Guide have often 
been implemented both by supporters (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b) and critics (e.g., Gibbard & Walker, 2014) 
of the hypothesis – corroborating the central epistemological function played by the Guide. 
Alternative, nationally based guidelines exist among other scientific communities and nations. An 
example is the North American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature (NACSN) – a second source 
used here to investigate the epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Founded in 1946 (originally as 
the American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature, renamed in 1978), the organization has adopted 
a Code (last revised in 2005) to promote terminological, classificatory, and procedural consistency 
specifically among North American geologists and stratigraphers. While generally consistent with the 
guidelines set by the Guide, the Code maintains some terminological differences, such as the use of the term 
‘geosol’ in pedostratigraphy, the designation ‘allostratigraphic unit’ instead of ‘synthem’ in allostratigraphy 
(see note 27), or the naming of the Carboniferous Subsystems. The 2005 Code clearly states that a “guiding 
 
168 The abridged version of the 1994 Guide, edited by Michael Murphy and Amos Salvador, was published in 2000 to 
compensate for the lack of the Guide’s accessibility Guide for students and scholars internationally. It does not revise 
the original 1994 Guide, but only trims the text down to 36 pages.

principle in preparing this Code has been to make it as consistent as possible with the International Guide 
[i.e., the Guide], and at the same time to foster further innovations to meet the expanding and changing 
needs of earth scientists on the North American continent” (NACSN, 2005, p. 1556). Hence, while 
terminology, research methods, practices, and rules may differ among geologists and stratigraphers based 
on local customs and traditions, the fundamental principles and methods of geochronology and stratigraphy 
are embodied by the Guide. 
 
The Guide and the Code represent two sources from which to derive the methodological context 
of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. A third major source used in this chapter is the AWG’s (Zalasiewicz et 
al., 2019b) latest and most comprehensive monograph, The Anthropocene as a Geological Time Unit. This source 
summarizes a decade of work specifically oriented around the question of whether or not the Anthropocene 
could be recognized as a time unit. The monograph provides the very empirical backbone of the hypothesis, 
encompassing literature exploring the stratigraphic significance of human activities. Rather than a 
conclusive effort, the work represents preparation for a formal proposal to the SQS, the ICS, and finally to 
the IUGS. The work outlines the stratigraphic basis of an Anthropocene unit as currently (viz. March 2021) 
upheld by the vast majority of the AWG, de facto expressing the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a stratigraphic 
hypothesis. 
But what does it mean for the Anthropocene Hypothesis to represent a stratigraphic hypothesis? 
Answering this question requires probing into the methods and purpose of stratigraphic research. 
 
The Guide defines stratigraphy as the “descriptive science of rock strata” and “rock bodies forming 
the Earth’s crust and their organization into distinctive, useful, mappable units based on their inherent 
properties or attributes” (Salvador, 1994, p. 13). Stratigraphy is crucial not simply for describing, classifying, 
naming, and correlating rock units across the globe, but also for providing base material for reconstructing 
the Earth’s history by dividing it into meaningful taxonomical units (Figure 3.1).  
 
A central idea in stratigraphic research is the concept of the ‘stratigraphic unit.’ Stratigraphic units 
represent bodies of rocks with distinct recognizable properties (e.g., color, texture, age, fossil presence, 
position, residual magnetism, etc.) used for classification of the Earth’s rocks. Each stratigraphic unit is 
characterized by a set of unique properties that distinguishes it from others, and that allows correlation 
among synchronous but geographically distant sedimentary strata (i.e., strata of the same age may occur at 
distant locations as they were transported by action of plate tectonics). This uniqueness is due to the specific 
physical, biological, chemical, fossiliferous, or other properties that distinguish that unit. Multiple types of 
properties can be observed in a rock or strata, and based on which property is observed, a corresponding 
type of stratigraphic classification is used. For instance, lithological properties define and characterize 
lithostratigraphic units, biological properties define and characterize biostratigraphic units, and time-based 
properties define and characterize chronostratigraphic and geochronological (sensu stricto) units. 
Stratigraphic classification encompasses this diversified spectrum of material properties used to classify 
rocks and, together with radiometric dating techniques, to reconstruct geological time through meaningful 
time units.

Figure 3.1. Types of stratigraphic classification listed by the NACSN Code. Table I shows all types 
of material-based stratigraphic units. Table IIA lists material, time-based units (polarity 
chronostratigraphic units are chronozones based on magnetic polarity). Table IIB illustrates non-
material geochronological units. Units in IIB are not stratigraphic units, because only material units 
are part of stratigraphic classification. Italicized units are fundamental units according to the Code. 
The units listed by the Code have minor differences from the stratigraphic categories listed by the 
Guide (see Murphy & Salvador, 2000, p. 10, Table 1). (Readapted from the original source: NACSN, 
2005) 
 
 
Key concepts in stratigraphic classifications are those of stratotype (or type section) and type locality. A stratotype 
is a specific interval or point in a layered outcrop functioning as a standard for defining and characterizing 
a given stratigraphic unit. A type locality is the geographical locality of a stratigraphic unit (generally 
unlayered) or rock where that unit or rock was first identified, and that represents a standard of reference 
(e.g., Icelandite, a type of volcanic rock first found in Iceland). Stratotypes may be defined on a given 
boundary between two distinct stratigraphic units, in which case a boundary-stratotype is adopted as a standard 
of reference. The concept of boundary-stratotype – that is, a “specified sequence of rock strata in which a 
specific point is selected that serves as the standard for definition and recognition of a stratigraphic 
boundary” (p. 26) – is an important component in understanding chronostratigraphic units, and thus the 
GSSP method adopted by the AWG in locating the beginning of the Anthropocene. This aspect is discussed 
in section 3.1.2.6. 
 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis argues that human activities are leaving (and have already left) a 
discernible stratigraphic signature in rocks. This signature can be represented as a discrete stratigraphic unit 
based on the unique properties these rocks exhibit. These properties differ substantially from the 
stratigraphic profile of the Holocene (Waters et al., 2016), suggesting that the Anthropocene is a 
stratigraphically distinct unit of time – thus the reason the hypothesis is stratigraphic. 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
176 
 
 
To claim that the Anthropocene could be recognized as a discrete geologic time unit means that it 
could represent a geochronological and chronostratigraphic unit on the geological time scale. The Guide defines 
geochronology as “[t]he science of dating and determining the time sequence of events in the history of the 
Earth” (Salvador, 1994, p. 16), whereas chronostratigraphy is the discipline concerned with the study of the 
time of formation of rocks. Whilst the term ‘geochronology’ has only been used since around 1893 (Reiners 
et al., 2018, p. ix), systematic attempts to order and reconstruct time based on fossils, archaeological data, 
or rock layers can be traced at least as far back as the 17th century, when the Danish scientist and bishop 
Niels Steensen (commonly known as Nicolas Steno) delineated four fundamental principles (or laws) of 
stratigraphy.169 For the most part, geochronological and chronostratigraphic dating had been relative, 
meaning that it assigned a sequential order to events based on rock or fossil records without necessarily 
providing a corresponding numerical date.170 Critical theoretical and experimental developments during the 
20th century allowed measurements of the absolute age of rocks with different degrees of precision and 
accuracy. Many of the already existing geological time units (most of British coinage) were gradually 
assembled and coherently unified in a geological time scale, providing an increasingly thorough description 
and hierarchical classification of the Earth’s approximately 4.54 billion-year history (Dalrymple, 2001). 
 
Hence, the Earth’s history has been divided into chronostratigraphic and geochronological units 
dividing geological time in a meaningful and useful way. By arguing that a new division of time could be 
located in the Earth’s most recent history (one determined by the stratigraphic footprint of Homo sapiens), 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis establishes itself as a geochronological and chronostratigraphic hypothesis. 
 
 
169 The four laws are those of superposition, original horizontality, cross-cutting relationships, and lateral continuity. 
170 Relative dating is still a useful and common practice in geology, especially in fieldwork. Most stratigraphic units are 
not directly defined by their numerical ages, but only by the specific physical, chemical, or fossil properties that 
characterize their boundaries. Absolute dating techniques (e.g., radioisotope dating) are only later applied to provide 
numerical dates to stratigraphic units.

the Guide (based on Salvador, 1994).  
 
 
If the Anthropocene does possess a distinct stratigraphic profile – as the AWG has been arguing (Waters 
et al., 2016; Waters et al., 2014a; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b; Zalasiewicz et al., 2011a; Zalasiewicz et al., 2014c) 
– and if its stratigraphic signature is considered geologically important, then a case for its official recognition 
as a discrete geochronological/chronostratigraphic unit can be made. A formal proposal for official 
recognition of a unit can be forwarded by the unit-specific working group to their respective higher 
institutional bodies (in the case of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, the SQS), up to the ICS, and finally to 
the IUGS. The Guide highlights necessary steps to submit a formal proposal (summarized in figure 3.2). 
They cover several aspects of the proposal, from defining and characterizing a unit through the naming

protocol, to the publication procedure advised (including editorial procedure). In principle, these guidelines 
apply to all types of proposed stratigraphic units – thus including an Anthropocene unit. 
 
Requirements in (1) cover the definition, characterization, and description of the proposed unit. 
Murphy and Salvador (2000, p. 235) also provide functional definitions of the verbs ‘to define’ (to set “limits 
or boundaries to units in the classification,” ibid.), ‘to characterize’ (“to state what is unique, thus, a 
characterization of a stratigraphic unit specifies its unique attributes or unique combination of attributes,” 
ibid.), and ‘to describe’ (“to summarize the total content and relationships of the unit of the classification,” 
ibid.). Defining, characterizing, and describing a new stratigraphic unit “should include a clear account of 
its boundaries, diagnostic properties, and attributes” (Salvador, 1994, p. 17). This should also include a 
name (consistent with the requirements in (3)), a designated type section or type locality, the complete 
stratigraphic properties of the unit, correlation with other units, and more. The same guidelines established 
in (1) apply as well to subsurface units (i.e., units not exposed in an outcrop), which are less common than 
outcrop sections.  
Requirements in (3) concern the naming protocol for a proposed unit. This is an especially 
important point since, as previously stressed, the terminological choice of ‘Anthropocene’ has been 
contested by many, especially historians.171 Usually, names of formal stratigraphic units should follow 
geographic designations followed by their respective kind and rank – e.g., the Permian System represents a 
succession of rocks named (by Roderick Murchison in 1841) after their region, Perm, in Russia. The naming 
protocol varies across the types of stratigraphic properties considered (e.g., lithostratigraphic, 
biostratigraphic, etc.). Some chronostratigraphic units do not follow the geographical clause, and preserve 
long-established names (e.g., Quaternary Period, originally coined by the Italian geologist Giovanni Arduino 
in 1759; see Gibbard & Walker, 2013). Notably, requirement 3g provides ground rules for the preservation 
of traditional and well-established names for stratigraphic units. The requirement states: 
 
Although it is strongly urged that all new stratigraphic units be named according to the 
recommendations of this Guide, it is realized that there are many well-established and traditionally 
used stratigraphic units, particularly lithostratigraphic units, of long historical standing for which 
exception should be made […] Such units should not be abandoned merely because they lack 
geographic names. Tolerance and flexibility are advised. (Salvador, 1994, pp. 22-23) 
 
A ‘conservative’ understanding of this passage seems to suggest that this exception should only be allowed 
exclusively for well-established and official units with “long historical standing” – for instance, the Millstone 
Grit Group (also used as an example by the Guide), a lithological unit of the Carboniferous Period deriving 
its name from stones used in watermills rather than from a locality. Such units were established prior to the 
existence of international standards for stratigraphic nomenclature and classification, and their widespread 
recognition and use make terminological consistency superfluous. However, if the ‘Anthropocene’ term is 
to be considered well-established (as both critics and advocates agree) in terms of reception across the 
 
171 See sections 1.2.3 and 5.1.3. 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE

geological (and broader scientific) literature, then the geographic designation may not represent a major 
violation of terminological praxis – as otherwise observed by some critics (LeCain, 2015; Scourse, 2016; 
Suckling, 2014; Walker et al., 2015). Ultimately, the degree of tolerance and flexibility toward the naming 
of a proposed unit is decided within the geological community based on the usefulness and meaning of the 
proposed unit (in addition to other epistemic and social determinants). 
Requirements in (4) concern the ‘sociological’ aspects of proposing a time/rock unit – namely, the 
publication of a proposal in a recognized scientific medium, publication priority, and further editorial 
recommendations. Interestingly, the principle of priority outlined in 4b stresses that “[p]riority alone does 
not justify displacing a well-established name by one not well known or only occasionally used; nor should 
an inadequately established name be preserved merely on account of priority” (p. 23). This guideline may 
be useful in attributing a ‘priority principle’ to the ‘Anthropocene’ term against the array of terminological 
alternatives proposed by humanistic scholarship (assuming the term to be more popular than other variants 
across the scientific community). At the same time, 4b also ensures that terminological alternatives 
(consistent with the naming procedures set by the Guide) to the ‘Anthropocene’ may ultimately be adopted. 
This is an eventuality neither excluded nor rejected by the AWG. 
Lastly, requirement (5) provides guidelines for revisions or redefinition of previously established 
units. Once ratified – a process requiring the approval of the specific working group, Subcommission, ICS, 
and lastly IUGS – the chosen boundary (i.e., beginning) of the proposed unit cannot be modified for at 
least ten years (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b).  
The guidelines offered by the Guide provide a starting point for understanding the requirements 
and procedure of the AWG in assessing in what terms an Anthropocene stratigraphic unit should be 
characterized – that is, if there are significant markers that make the Anthropocene a substantially different 
stratigraphic unit from the Holocene (or the Meghalayan, if its proposal is demoted from epoch/series to 
age/stage172); and how it should be characterized (i.e., its hierarchical level, its primary and secondary 
markers, its beginning, etc.). They also afford insight into the epistemological ground wherein the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis is located. But what does characterize the Anthropocene? What boundary defines 
it? What evidence describes it?  
A range of scientific evidence has been gathered since the AWG began its operations (mostly 
unfunded) in 2009. This evidence ranges from evolutionary biology and ecology to Earth System science 
and geology. However, the primary evidence informing the Anthropocene Hypothesis is represented by 
stratigraphic evidence, embodied (in simplified terms) by core samples extracted by scientific research teams 
from several paleoenvironmental archives in several sites around the world, such as speleothems, ice, marine 
or freshwater anoxic basins, saline or cold lakes, delta or estuarine sediments, peat mires, and more 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para 7.8.4). This type of evidence is based on observable properties of rocks 
(either sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic) and strata, which include lithostratigraphy, 
 
172 As also shared by other members of the AWG, it is unlikely that the Anthropocene can see higher hierarchical 
recognition than the level of epoch/series.

magnetostratigraphy, 
pedostratigraphy, 
biostratigraphy, 
or 
chemostratigraphy, 
combined 
with 
chronostratigraphy (see figure 3.1). Each of these represents specific properties of stratigraphic significance 
used to characterize and define stratigraphic units. If the Anthropocene is to be recognized as a geological 
unit distinct from the Holocene, substantial evidence of its unique stratigraphic profile must be provided 
to justify its recognition as a geochronological/chronostratigraphic unit on the geological time scale. Thus, 
the following sections overview the stratigraphic evidence that the AWG has gathered so far by tackling 
each of these types of stratigraphic evidence.173 It will be illustrated that, across the spectrum of 
anthropogenic markers for an Anthropocene unit, geochemical markers such as δ13C or radionuclides (e.g., 
plutonium-239, carbon-14, caesium-137) associated to nuclear and thermonuclear bomb testing around the 
1950s are the most resolved, widespread, and correlatable signals across core samples analyzed (Waters et 
al., 2018).174 
 
3.1.2.1 Lithostratigraphic Evidence 
 
Lithostratigraphy is the “element of stratigraphy that deals with the description and systematic organization 
of the rocks of the Earth’s crust into distinctive named units based on the lithologic [emphasis added] 
character of the rocks and their stratigraphic relations” (Salvador, 1994, p. 31). Lithology is the description 
of the visible physical properties of rocks in an outcrop, such as color, grain, fabric, or texture. A 
lithostratigraphic unit is “[a] body of rocks that is defined and recognized on the basis of its observable and 
distinctive lithologic properties or combination of lithological properties and its stratigraphic relations” (p. 
32). Lithostratigraphic units are temporally diachronous, meaning that they are defined exclusively based 
on their physical properties and “not by their inferred age, the time span they represent, inferred geologic 
history, or manner of formation” (ibid.). The hierarchical subdivision of formal lithostratigraphic units 
(from lowest to highest) consists of flow (used for volcanic units), bed, member, formation, and group.175 
Other terms may be used for igneous and metamorphic rocks (e.g., ‘schist,’ ‘granite,’ ‘complex’) due to the 
non-layered nature of these. The primary formal unit of lithostratigraphy used for geological mapping is 
the formation. Formations are the only formal units (with groups, which constitute two or more formations) 
represented in stratigraphic columns – that is, stratigraphic representations of geographical areas based on 
the vertical succession of rock sequences. Formations may vary from less than a meter to kilometers in 
thickness, and their formal recognition varies depending on the geological complexity and specificity of a 
region.  
 
173 The AWG (Syvitski et al., 2020) has also provided a list of sixteen examples focusing on anthropogenic energy 
consumption since ~1950 of significance from an Earth System perspective. Some of the examples overlap with 
stratigraphic evidence. However, as stated at the beginning of the chapter, the relationship between Earth System 
evidence and stratigraphic evidence is not directly discussed in the present chapter.  
174 δ13C expresses the ratio between the stable isotopes 13C and 12C reported in parts per thousand. It is an isotopic 
signature widely used in archeology, paleontology, and paleoecology. 
175 Lithostratigraphic units are capitalized when associated with their respective designations, for example, Toroweap 
Formation or Supai Group. 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
181 
 
There are several requirements for the establishment of lithostratigraphic units. One is the 
possibility of grounding a geological map of the region the unit seeks to describe – that is, it must cover a 
significant portion of the area laterally. Lithostratigraphic units should also conform to the law of 
superimposition (in a succession of undisturbed strata, younger layers or rocks lie on older layers or rocks) 
and the principle of lateral continuity (layers extend horizontally in all directions, all things being equal) – 
both additional methodological requirements for proposing lithological units (Ford et al., 2014). Like other 
stratigraphic units, a designated lithostratigraphic unit must be based on its respective type section (i.e., 
stratotypes) or type locality (Figure 3.2, req. 1b). The stratotype should also be accessible, clearly visible, 
and preservable through time. If a single type section is not available (for instance, in the case of non-
layered rocks), locality or a ‘complex’176 may provide the stratotype for a lithostratigraphic unit. Units that 
do not surface in an outcrop are designated based on their lower and upper boundaries. 
Studies on the physical characteristics of anthropogenic rocks and strata177 have been conducted 
extensively in the past decades, and they inform much of the empirical basis of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. Zalasiewicz et al. (2011a) note that two main processes comprise anthropogenic modification 
of sedimentary patterns – namely, the modification of natural sediment patterns by damming, agriculture, 
trawling, or the modification of rivers and coastlines; and the creation of novel strata or novel sedimentary 
environments especially through built environments (e.g., construction of cities, excavation, transportation 
of geological material), where modified or new geological material forms layers up to several meters in 
depth and extends for as much as 90 km2 (as documented for the English West Midlands or ‘Black Country,’ 
a mining center active throughout and after the Industrial Revolution). Whilst the built environment is 
mostly characteristic of terrestrial land, coastal zones and sea floor associated with oil platforms (and spills) 
or fluvial waste discharge also comprise distinct anthropogenic deposits.  
Metal-enriched sediments and other anthropogenic sediments “from the Industrial Revolution 
onwards is a recurrent observation along […] industrialized areas of the world” (Irabien et al., 2015, p. 203), 
as suggested by a study on the chemostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic signatures of the Anthropocene 
on the eastern Cantabrian coast in northeastern Spain. A study by Wilkinson (2005) on the denudation178 
rate of natural processes in geological time compared to human-induced erosion of soils (from construction 
and agricultural practices) suggests that “human activity is many times the most important geomorphic 
agent acting on the surface of the modern Earth” (p. 163). This research seems further corroborated by a 
study from Douglas and Lawson (2001) showing how the deliberate anthropogenic flow of material (57,548 
megatons/year in 1995) exceeds the natural material transport to the world’s ocean by rivers (~22,000 
Mt/year) by a factor of almost three. Like Wilkinson, the authors conclude that human activity “is the most 
 
176 A complex is defined as a “lithostratigraphic unit composed of diverse types of any class or classes or rocks 
(sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic) and characterized by irregularly mixed lithology or by highly complicated 
structural relations” (Murphy & Salvador, 2000, p. 242). 
177 Strata (plural of stratum) are layers of rocks distinguished by their lithologic properties. They are usually visible to 
the naked eye as horizontal sequences of layers of different colors and widths. Other properties, such as fossil remains 
or remanent magnetism, can be detected in strata. 
178 Denudation is the processes of reduction of the topographical relief or ‘flattening’ of the Earth’s surface by the 
action of geological forces – for instance, by weathering or erosion through waves or wind.

efficient geological agent on the earth at present” (p. 24).179 A third study of interest by Hooke and Martín-
Duque (2012) stresses the extent of humans’ land transformation, which the authors estimate to surpass 
50% of the Earth’s total land surface distributed unevenly between urban areas, industrial complexes, 
agricultural land, pasture, and other parameters of human activity.  
Yet numerical expressions of humans’ overwhelming presence and agency on the planet do not 
necessarily translate into a discrete lithostratigraphic unit. Specific and clearly recognizable anthropogenic 
rocks need to be identified as possible anthropogenic rock types for lithostratigraphic classification. The 
AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 2.1-2.6) has found in mineralogical research a step toward the 
characterization, definition, and description of anthropogenic rock types. Minerals are defined as naturally 
occurring elements or compounds with discernible internal structure and chemical characteristics. 
Aggregates of one or more minerals180 compose rocks – the essential working unit of petrology and a 
structural component of geology and stratigraphy. A study by Hazen et al. (2008) divides the history of the 
Earth into ten stages based on the evolution and accretion of mineral species, grouped into three eras: the 
era of planetary accretion (4.56–4.55 Ga), the era of crust and mantle reworking (4.55 Ga to 2.5 Ga), and 
the era of bio-mediated mineralogy (2.5 Ga to present). According to the authors, while physical and 
chemical processes determined, respectively, the first and second eras of mineral evolution, the shift in the 
third and current era was determined by biologically induced mineral diversification mostly by atmospheric 
oxygenation through cyanobacteria photosynthesis – a process beginning at least in the Paleoproterozoic 
Era (2.5–1.6 Ga). The tenth and last stage of mineral evolution (< 0.542 Ga) is characterized by Phanerozoic 
mineralization, “when biology came to dominate the mineralogical diversification of Earth’s surface” (p. 
1709). 
Hazen et al. (2017), Zalasiewicz et al. (2014a), and Zalasiewicz et al. (2019b, 2.1)181 have advanced 
that a fourth new era or eleventh phase could be designated as “a time when mineral diversity is experiencing 
a punctuation event owing to the pervasive near-surface effects of human industrial society” (Hazen et al., 
2017, p. 595). Three features of stratigraphic (and particularly lithostratigraphic) importance can be derived 
from this new mineralogical era/phase.  
First, there is “the widespread occurrence of synthetic mineral-like materials” (p. 606), 
characterized by the production of approximately 180,000 inorganic crystalline (orderly structured) 
compounds – an event with unprecedented pace and scale in the entire solar system, vastly outweighing the 
biologically mediated rise of minerals during the Great Oxygenation Event (taking the total to 
approximately 5,700 minerals). These synthetic compounds are most pervasive in the built environment, 
and provide the basis for anthropogenic rock types of widespread spatial ramification such as concrete 
(cement), bricks, ceramics, or asphalt/bitumen (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b).  
 
179 Interesting to note is the wording used by Wilkinson as well as Douglas and Lawson to address humans as geological 
agents rather than forces, as suggested in section 3.1.1.

A second feature is represented by human bioturbation. Bioturbation is the disturbance of strata 
(mostly by burrowing) by living organisms. It is documented throughout the Phanerozoic Eon, and 
constitutes the primary marker for the Cambrian (and Phanerozoic) GSSP – represented by the burrowing 
of Treptichnus pedum in a stratotype at Fortune Head, Newfoundland, Canada. Researchers (Zalasiewicz et 
al., 2014b) have noted the unparalleled degree of bioturbation caused by humans, generally associated with 
mining, drilling, boreholes, or construction of subsurface storage facilities. These activities affect surface, 
shallow, and deep strata – the last being less exposed to erosion and weathering and thus “permanent on 
geological timescales” (p. 5).  
Lastly, a third feature concerns human-mediated, global-scale redistribution of minerals. 
Anthropogenic actions have not simply created new mineral-like compounds, but also rearranged and 
redistributed naturally produced minerals in a way comparable to the action of natural forces.182 This global 
redistribution of minerals is intrinsically linked to human modes of existence, such as the use of precious 
metals and stones, collections of mineral archives in museums, and other cultural, social, and industrial uses 
of minerals across human societies. The very collections housed in museums represent unique 
combinations of minerals that would not occur naturally and are thus in themselves culturally mediated 
assemblages of potential stratigraphic value. 
It is not a matter of conducting field research to retrieve anthropogenic deposits – widely 
documented across terrestrial, coastal, and maritime land – in order to characterize an Anthropogene 
lithostratigraphic type-unit. As seen, anthropogenic deposits or human-mediated mineral-like compounds 
are widely scattered on the planet’s surface. The more problematic issue is adhering to the formalisms of 
lithostratigraphic and mineralogical recognition. The International Mineralogical Association (IMA) 
Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (CNMMN) has defined ‘mineral’ as “an element or 
chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes” 
(Nickel, 1995, p. 689). The CNMMN has also considered anthropogenic substances or “synthetic 
equivalents” as “those produced by Man, and are not regarded as minerals” (p. 690). As of 2017, 208 types 
of human-mediated minerals with principally or exclusively anthropogenic origins have been approved 
(Hazen et al., 2017). These anthropogenic minerals (e.g., Laurium) were formed by the action of geological 
processes on anthropogenic substances. However, with the scarcely countable multitude of anthropogenic 
substances possibly interacting with geological processes and forming new mineral-like compounds, the 
CNMMN decreed that no future chemical compounds of the kind will be considered as minerals (while 
still retaining the mineral status of previous human-mediated minerals). Hence, the great majority of newly 
produced anthropogenic mineral-like compounds are not officially recognized by the IMA, and are likely 
not to fall under the extant regulations.  
This formal blockade generates a dilemma: that is, whether or not a change in characterization of 
minerals should be promoted. On the one side, one could consider whether the IMA classification and 
 
182 This comparison has led researchers to often compare humans to geological forces, as previously discussed in 
section 3.1.1. 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
184 
 
taxonomical schemes should undergo structural or partial changes to accommodate the extent of mineral-
like compounds and human-mediated compounds of anthropogenic origin – most sharing properties with, 
and having longevity equal to, naturally occurring minerals. On the other side, it may be simply sufficient 
to consider mineralogical markers as auxiliary evidence for the Anthropocene Hypothesis, without 
requesting their consideration as the basis for a discrete Anthropocene lithostratigraphic unit. An effort in 
the first direction has been conducted by Hazen et al. (2017) by providing an interpretative and prototypical 
taxonomy of human-mediated mineral-like compounds divided into anthropogenic compounds that are 
either indirectly produced or directly synthetized for industrial purposes. Interestingly, this division 
implements intentionality as a demarcation criterion between human-mediated mineral-like compounds – an 
unusual (and philosophically dense) epistemic parameter when seen in the context of traditional 
stratigraphic classification. 
The implicit demarcation postulated by the IMA between naturally occurring geological processes 
and human activities is philosophically interesting. As seen, this separation serves to discern minerals from 
human-mediated mineral-like compounds. If humans have truly become a major geological and 
biogeochemical agent in the functioning of the Earth System, then this epistemic division seems 
epistemically unwarranted. However, on a more practical level, the inclusion of anthropogenic ‘minerals’ 
would require a substantial revision and restructuring that would not be restricted to extant organizational 
schemes (taxonomy and classification), but would extend also to include the whole body of mineralogy 
(and adjacent disciplines), from textbooks to methods of research. In Kuhnian terms, it would consist of a 
paradigm shift. If sciences exhibit conservative responses toward structural changes, as Kuhn has noted, 
then ‘negotiating’ human-mediated ‘minerals’ for a structural disciplinary revision is perhaps not a bargain 
most scientists would be willing to take. Maintaining the human/nature divide is a practical choice, more 
than a strictly ontological and epistemological statement about the role and agency of Homo sapiens. 
This mineralogical issue is related to lithostratigraphy as well. This is because minerals form the 
basic ‘elements’ of rocks and strata, and characterize many of the lithological properties used to define 
lithological units. Consequently, researchers (Edgeworth et al., 2015; Ford et al., 2014) have noted that 
traditional standards and taxonomies in lithostratigraphy may no longer be capable of translating the level 
of anthropogenic deposits that have been sedimenting and layering across the Earth into lithostratigraphic 
units. An epistemic revision is required to accommodate the lithostratigraphic novelty characterizing the 
Anthropocene. For instance, Ford et al. (2014) argue that “the stratigraphy of such deposits [anthropogenic 
deposits of a lithological character] is not readily described by existing classification schemes, which do not 
differentiate separate phases or lithologically distinct deposits beyond a local scale” (p. 55). The request for 
the formalization of such classification schemes may encourage future research to dissolve the 
human/nature boundary in mineralogical, and thereafter lithostratigraphic, classification. 
In addition to the difficulties related to the nature of lithostratigraphic anthropogenic units, current 
lithostratigraphic hierarchies (group, formation, member, bed, flow) do not accommodate anthropogenic 
deposits. This is because anthropogenic deposits are characterized by an array of different lithological 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
185 
 
properties (often concentrated in the same deposit) that do not generally seem to match the language and 
method of lithostratigraphic classification – mostly because of the novelty of implementing a 
lithostratigraphic approach to anthropogenic sediments. Hence, Edgeworth et al. (2015) consider it 
necessary that “the archaeosphere should be recognized as a single lithostratigraphic unit (made up of 
multiple smaller units)” (p. 22). Similarly, Ford et al. (2014) consider it either “necessary to argue that 
lithostratigraphy needs to evolve as a classification scheme to consider the unique circumstances of artificial 
deposits, not currently considered in any scheme, or it be argued that lithostratigraphic definitions are fixed 
and cannot be modified to incorporate the vagaries of man-made stratigraphy” (Ford et al., 2014, p. 81). 
 
Although anthropogenic deposits seem to satisfy to different degrees the various lithostratigraphic 
criteria set by the geological community, recognition of anthropogenic sediments in traditional taxonomies 
(either stratigraphy or mineralogy) is ultimately a decision to be taken by the appropriate scientific bodies, 
and thus by scientific communities.183 Furthermore, the lithological and lithostratigraphic properties of 
anthropogenic deposits seem to suggest a diachronous onset of the Anthropocene – one defying a 
chronostratigraphic-based definition of the epoch (Edgeworth et al., 2019).184 
3.1.2.2 Magnetostratigraphic Evidence 
 
Magnetostratigraphy is the “element of stratigraphy that deals with the magnetic characteristics of rock 
bodies” (Salvador, 1994, p. 70). Due to their magnetic mineral compositions, some rocks have measurable 
magnetic properties. The most common property in stratigraphic research is “the change in the direction 
of the remanent magnetization of the rocks, caused by reversals in the polarity of the Earth’s magnetic 
field” (p. 69). The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of rocks represents the ‘trace’ left by the 
geomagnetic field at the time of their formation, and can be used to determine the history of the Earth’s 
axial dipole magnetic field in terms of direction and intensity as well as the movements of rocks across 
tectonic plates (and thus their place of origin). Types of NRM are thermoremanent magnetization (acquired 
during the cooling of magnetic minerals below Curie temperature, the threshold value of 570°C above 
which materials lose their permanent magnetic properties), chemical remanent magnetization (acquired by 
ferromagnetic minerals through chemical processes under certain conditions), viscous remanent 
magnetization (acquired by long exposure to a magnetic field, generally the geomagnetic field), and primary 
or characteristic remanent magnetization (acquired naturally during the formation of the rock).185 Since 
types of NRM may overprint or be superimposed over the history of a rock’s magnetism, NRM is usually 
 
183 Japanese geological research has been using the term ‘Jinji Unconformity’ to demarcate the boundary between 
artificial and natural deposits (Nirei et al., 2012).  
184 This is true only insofar as one equates anthropogenic deposits (as a lithostratigraphic unit) with the Anthropocene 
(as a geochronological/chronostratigraphic unit). The AWG has stressed that anthropogenic impacts should not be 
considered the same as the signals used to mark the beginning of the Anthropocene at ~1950s (Zalasiewicz et al., 
2017b; Zalasiewicz et al., 2021). 
185 For a concise summary of different types of remanent magnetization, see https://cse.umn.edu/irm/6-types-

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
186 
 
considered the vector sum of all the different magnetic components (i.e., all the magnetization acquired in 
different ways throughout a rock’s history).  
 
Among the types of NRM, primary or characteristic remanent magnetization is especially 
important because it records magnetic polarity of the geomagnetic field at the time of a rock’s formation. 
Polarity (i.e., the existence of magnetic poles) is a property of all magnetic fields. In the case of the 
geomagnetic field (generated by electric currents from the Earth’s outer core, made of a mixture of molten 
iron and nickel), polarity is the direction of the geomagnetic field in respect to the magnetic north pole and 
magnetic south pole. At apparently random intervals, the Earth undergoes geomagnetic reversals, and 
magnetic north and south are inverted (the last reversal, the Brunhes–Matuyama transition, occurred around 
781,000 years ago). A change in intensity and pole orientation in the geomagnetic field that is not associated 
with a reversal is known as an ‘excursion’ (e.g., the Laschamp excursion, ~41 ka). Reversals are recorded 
by rocks globally and synchronously because of the global extent of the geomagnetic field. Periods of 
alternate ‘normal’ or ‘reverse’ polarity are called chrons in geochronology, and chronozones in 
chronostratigraphy (currently, we are situated in the Brunhes Normal Chron). In magnetostratigraphy, they 
are equivalent to the polarity zones (or subzone and superzone) of rock bodies. Polarity zones are the basic 
unit of magnetostratigraphic polarity classification. They are defined by the magnetic polarity of rock bodies 
traceable to their remanent magnetism. Together with marine magnetic anomalies, the magnetostratigraphic 
record enables the reconstruction of the geomagnetic polarity time scales (GPTS) – an important addition 
to the reconstruction of the Earth’s history.186 
Since the geomagnetic field is independent (so far) of human influence (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b), 
no human-induced disruption nor polarity reversal can be used as a magnetostratigraphic marker for an 
Anthropocene unit. However, magnetism is still a relevant aspect of anthropogenic sediments and mineral-
like compounds. Artificial materials heated at high temperatures acquire thermoremanent magnetization 
when they cool below the Curie temperature, providing archaeomagnetic evidence. This means that 
anthropogenic rocks or human-induced mineral-like compounds may preserve (if undisturbed) remanent 
magnetism for geologically significant periods of time in the future because, as for other rock types, they 
record the Earth’s geomagnetic field direction. More importantly, mineral magnetism “responds directly to 
anthropogenic impacts on the environment and so does provide a potential marker for the Anthropocene” 
(p. 81). This is because changes in magnetic properties associated with anthropogenic activities will be 
recorded in magnetic minerals, providing an anthropogenic signature of a global extent. In this respect, the 
most significant anthropogenic modifications of the Earth’s surface documented in magnetic records are 
land use and the burning of fossil fuels (Snowball et al., 2014).  
Instances of high concentration of magnetic minerals associated with land use have been 
documented in Europe at least since 2.6 ka (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 2.6.2), with the largest signatures 
beginning around 1100 CE. They can be attributed to anthropogenic deforestation, water catchment, and 
 
186 Only a portion of the Earth’s magnetism has been recorded in the GPTS, which ‘only’ extends as far back as 160 
million years ago (Langereis et al., 2010). Due to difficulties in finding NRM in increasingly older rocks and establishing 
correlations among them, only scattered GPTSs or punctuated data is currently available for older time scales.

soil erosion. These changes in land use transferred and concentrated iron oxide (Fe-oxide) sediments in 
lacustrine and riverine systems as well as peat bogs. The concentration of iron oxides in aquatic systems 
have been used as proxies of environmental change by Holocene mineral magnetic studies because of their 
sensitivity to changes in soil (Snowball et al., 2014). Since the late 1970s, the study of the properties of 
magnetism in relation to both anthropogenic and natural pollution, climate change, and sedimentation has 
been the object of the field of environmental magnetism. 
 
A second source of mineral-magnetic signatures is from atmospheric pollution associated with the 
burning of biomass and fossil fuels (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 2.6.3). The combustion of hydrocarbons 
(the basic chemical compound of coal, petroleum, and natural gasses) has been considered as a potential 
marker for the Anthropocene, providing auxiliary evidence of stratigraphical value to the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. This marker is represented by the release of fly ash such as spheroidal carbonaceous particles 
(SCPs) containing iron oxides from oil burning, or magnetic inorganic ash spheres (IASs) from fossil fuel 
burning as well as iron and other metal manufacturing and smelting. Different techniques can be 
implemented to assess the magnetic properties (e.g., remanent magnetization) of these particles, which can 
be correlated among deposits worldwide to provide seemingly isochronous mineral magnetic pollution 
events. 
Magnetostratigraphy provides a pool of auxiliary evidence in support of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. However, such evidence does not constitute the primary marker for the Anthropocene. 
Magnetic markers have seen wide application in Cenozoic stratigraphy (< 66 Ma), especially for defining 
the base of the several series within the Neogene. The Gauss-Matuyama reversal (2.58 Ma) is also used as 
a defining marker for the Gelasian Age/Stage, and for the higher Quaternary Period/System. No magnetic 
reversal or excursion of equal magnitude has been recorded in recent times, nor has any anthropogenic 
activity been documented to substantially affect reversal or excursions of the geomagnetic field. 
Nevertheless, magnetic events of anthropogenic origin have been recorded. Snowball, Hounslow, and 
Nilsson (2014) have suggested that the 1890–1900 CE interval represents a mineral magnetic pollution 
event that is well recorded in mineralogical and magnetostratigraphic evidence, and that could provide an 
additional marker for the Anthropocene. 
 
Magnetostratigraphic research shows that not all functions of the Earth System are affected by 
human activities. The Earth’s geomagnetic field, and se the magnetosphere it produces, is largely 
independent of human forcings, and its reversals and excursions are related to the Earth’s inner 
composition and dynamics as well to its axial rotation.187 Nevertheless, magnetic properties of rock 
unrestricted to the polarity record are documented and provide additional data for an anthropogenic 
stratigraphic signature in rock records.

3.1.2.3 Pedological and Pedostratigraphic Evidence 
 
Pedology is a subdiscipline of soil science studying the formation and properties of natural soils. The 
discipline studying the relationship and stratigraphic properties of buried soils is pedostratigraphy. The concept 
of soil has different technical meanings depending on the discipline engaging with it. In pedological 
research, soil represents “the unconsolidated mineral matter on the surface of the Earth that has been 
subjected to the influence of genetic and environmental factors” (Chesworth, 2008, pp. 616-617), and is 
often represented as a ‘natural body’ or ‘organism.’ Soils are composed of different layers or soil horizons 
(usually identified with the letters O (organic), A (surface), B (subsoil), C (substratum), and R 
(bedrock/rockhead)) that are parallel to the surface, each having distinct properties (e.g., chemical, physical) 
that separate them from one another. The description of recognizable soil horizons is a necessary step for 
defining a pedostratigraphic unit. 
The North American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature (NACSN) has formally 
recognized pedostratigraphic units in 1961 (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 2.7.3), and has since provided 
terminological guidelines. The 2005 version of the North American Stratigraphic Guide does not attribute 
any stratigraphical significance to the term ‘soil.’ The term geosol has been instead proposed as the only 
fundamental unit of pedostratigraphic stratification (NACSN, 2005, Article 56). The definition of 
pedostratigraphic units provided by NACNS differs from that provided by the International Union for 
Quaternary Research (INQUA)188 – an international organization founded in 1928 that studies climatic and 
environmental changes during the Quaternary Period (2.58 Ma). The SQS has been using the term ‘paleosol’ 
as the basis for a pedostratigraphic unit, claiming that the acceptance and utility of the term ‘geosol’ is not 
universal.189 Nominalism aside, pedostratigraphic units have been recognized as additional time-
transgressive stratigraphic markers because of the distinct analyzable properties of soils as fundamental 
constituents of the Earth (NACSN, 2005, Article 55g). Nevertheless, neither North American nor 
international stratigraphy have extensively described anthropogenic signals in pedological and 
pedostratigraphic terms – until only recently. Similarly, the Guide does not provide any methodological nor 
terminological directives for soils and pedostratigraphic units, stressing that “[t]he stratigraphic treatment 
of soils needs additional consideration before attempting to formalize principles and procedures and to 
incorporate soil-stratigraphic units into the Guide. These units may be subject to future discussion by the 
ISSC” (Salvador, 1994, p. 2). 
Pedology endured major funding cuts among developed countries by the end of the 20th century 
(Basher, 1997). Recently, increasing anthropogenic modification of soils has caused pedology and 
pedostratigraphy to undergo new developments through attempts to integrate human actions into the study 
of soil formation and composition (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para 2.7.1). Traditionally, pedology has been

Quaternary geological times.

conceived as “the study of soils as independent [emphasis added] natural bodies” (Chesworth, 2008, p. 616). 
Eugene Woldemar Hilgard (1833–1916), a father of American soil science, saw the pedogenetic forces of 
‘virgin soils’ as the only object of interest to pedology (Richter, 2007). Soils as independent bodies did not 
merely define the object of study of pedology as a distinct discipline, but also demarcated epistemologically 
‘natural’ or ‘virgin’ soils from ‘non-natural,’ ‘artificial,’ or ‘managed’ soils (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 
2.7.1). Human actions had been considered disturbances rather than part of the natural processes of soil 
formation, and thus beyond the reach of pedology. Likewise, pedostratigraphic research has been 
conservative in integrating human forcings into the classification of pedostratigraphic units. 
An expression of this conservative stance toward the integration of anthropogenic forcings on 
pedogenesis is the ‘state factor theory.’ The theory was originally proposed by pedologist Hans Jenny (1899–
1992) in his 1941 textbook Factors of Soil Formation: A System of Quantitative Pedology. The model has been very 
influential in soil sciences and ecology. It provides a mathematical description of the functional relationship 
between soil properties and soil formation factors through the following equation: 
 
𝑠= 𝑓(𝑐𝑙, 𝑜, 𝑟, 𝑝, 𝑡,∗∗∗) 
 
Where s represents soil type, f stands for ‘function of,’ cl local climate, o organisms (or biotic factor), r 
topography (or relief), p parent material, and t time (Jenny, 1941). The asterisks represent one or more 
unknown variables that may have to be included in the equation. 
Notably, the human factor (definable as h-factor) is not immediately considered as an independent 
state variable. It is plausible that the h-factor in Jenny’s account is either (1) excluded a priori because of the 
focus on natural or ‘virgin’ soil formation; (2) implicit among one or more of the five given variables 
(arguably in o); (3) or included in the group of unknown variables. Its epistemic exclusion seems a feasible 
sociological factor, given that traditional pedology and pedostratigraphy has largely focused on the 
formation of non-human-altered soils. Jenny too notes that human interference has constituted a problem 
(rather than a variable) for soil classification in North American soils (p. 191). However, the scientist is fully 
aware of the extent of human impacts on soils, suggesting that human impact could be treated as an 
independent variable. For instance, he writes: 
 
Lands in all parts of the world are plowed and are subjected to numerous cultural treatments. Stable 
manure is added to the soil wherever cattle are raised. Crops are harvested universally. Deforestation 
occurs on all continents, and burning is practiced whenever needs arise. In all these enterprises, 
man acts, as far as the soil is concerned, as an independent variable or soil-forming factor [emphasis added]. 
(p. 203) 
 
A substantial overview of the human impact on soils is provided in Chapter 7, section C of his book. While 
the emphasis is placed on natural variables rather than anthropogenic forcings in soil formation processes, 
Jenny considers humans as no less soil-forming factors than natural ones. This seems to also exclude 
altogether both the possibility that humans represented, at his time, an unknown variable yet to be 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
190 
 
integrated into the state factor model, and that the h-factor is merely excluded a priori from consideration 
amongst soil formation variables. 
Jenny distinguishes between dependent and independent variables in biotic soil-forming – the former 
being a variable produced by a given soil (i.e., the dependence of an organism on its soil), the latter being a 
variable that produces a given soil independently of the soil properties, and without changes in other soil-
forming factors. He further postulates that “[i]f organisms are to be included among the soil formers, they must possess 
the properties of an independent variable” (p. 197). From the earlier excerpt, Jenny seems to attribute this status 
of independent variable or soil-forming factor to humans. However, despite the importance attributed to 
humans in soil formation and alteration, the fact that humans are considered “as an outstanding biological 
[emphasis added] soil-forming factor” (p. 232) leads ultimately to the conclusion that Jenny incorporates 
human activity into the o- (organism or biotic) factor.  
The subsumption of the h-factor into the o-factor, and thus its exclusion as a clearly distinguishable 
human factor in the state factor model, has been contested over the second half of the 20th century (Richter, 
2019). Proposals to fully integrate the human component into the state factor models have been developed 
(Dudal et al., 2002), also by Jenny himself (Amundson & Jenny, 1991, 1997). Some of these proposals 
emerged as research groups. For instance, a Soil Change Working Group was launched in 2009 as part of 
the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) and in cooperation with the International Union of Soil Sciences 
(IUSS). The group (no longer operating) aimed at fostering “interdisciplinary collaboration on soil issues 
affected by human forcings” (Richter et al., 2011, p. 2081) by (1) encouraging the institutional and 
disciplinary recognition of anthropedology as the science of human-soil formation, (2) advancing 
networking initiatives to study and model global soil change, and (3) establishing communication pathways 
to stress the social relevance of human-soil research. A second example is the International Committee on 
Anthropogenic Soils (ICOMANTH), formed in 1988 with the goal of integrating anthropogenic soils into 
the official soil taxonomy. Its recommendations were ultimately accepted in 2014 (Richter, 2019). 
As expressed by AWG member and soil scientist Daniel Richter (2007), many of these efforts 
spurred from the idea that “confining human influence within the biotic state-factor seems to underestimate 
humanity’s reach over ecosystems and soils worldwide” because “humanity has outgrown the biotic factor 
of soil formation” (p. 961). Modelling humans as merely one among many possible biological complexes 
that fill the biotic factor in the equation does not reflect the unparalleled scale and extent of anthropogenic 
pedogenesis and soil disruption. That is, the h-factor should be included in the state factor equation in 
addition to the o-factor. However, Richter and Yaalon (2012) also note that the question of understanding 
the relationship between humans and soils, and the polygenetic nature of soils, extends beyond 
mathematical formalism and traditional pedology because “(i) Human forcings take us well outside our 
scientific experience with soil as a natural body; and (ii) Human forcings deepen and broaden the dialog of 
our science, necessitating new interactions not only with the social sciences and the humanities but with 
the public at large” (p. 767). An effort in the direction of understanding human forcings on soils, and the 
switch of soils from natural bodies to human-natural bodies, has been encouraged by the institutionalization

of anthropedology and anthropedostratigraphy (Richter, 2007, 2019; Richter et al., 2015; Richter & Yaalon, 
2012). 
How is a discussion on the philosophy of pedology relevant to the Anthropocene Hypothesis? 
Homo sapiens, like any other terrestrial living organism, performs niche-constructing activities that inevitably 
change the Earth’s soils. Since the Neolithic Revolution, the human impact on soils has been remarkable – 
to the extent that authors have considered the dawn of anthropogenic cultivated soils as a possible GSSP 
for an Anthropocene Epoch (Certini & Scalenghe, 2011, discussed in section 3.2.2.5). In its most recent 
history, the extent of land modification has reached more than half of the total land surface of the Earth. 
Considering that around 98.6% of surface land is covered by soils (Richter, 2019, quoting Buol & al., 2011), 
this data intuitively translates into possible pedological and pedostratigraphic evidence for an Anthropocene 
stratigraphic unit.  
 
As seen, pedology connects with stratigraphy through pedostratigraphy. Reconsidering the 
epistemology of pedology by integrating the human factor has consequences in terms of characterizing and 
describing an anthropogenic signature in pedostratigraphic units. As also noted by Richter et al. (2015), 
NACSN requires pedostratigraphic units to rely on already formally defined lithostratigraphic or 
allostratigraphic units,190 and the Guide does not treat pedostratigraphic units as independent stratigraphic 
units. Because of the issues inherent in formalizing Anthropocene lithostratigraphic units, this seems to 
rule out ex ante any recognition of anthropogenic pedostratigraphic units (or anthropedostratigraphic units). 
However, Richter et al. (2015) note that the impact of humans on global soil, or the pedosphere, is reflected 
in signals of lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and chemostratigraphic nature. These signals reflect both a 
natural transition toward a new human-soil regime, and the epistemological transition toward 
anthropedostratigraphy. Equally to the issues encountered in most of traditional stratigraphy, scientific 
recognition of human forcings in traditional pedology and pedostratigraphy constitutes the major challenge 
in advancing (anthro-)pedostratigraphic evidence in support of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
3.1.2.4 Biostratigraphic Evidence 
 
Biostratigraphy is the “element of stratigraphy that deals with the distribution of fossils in the stratigraphic 
record and the organization of strata into units on the basis of their contained fossils” (Salvador, 1994, p. 
55). Fossils play an important role in providing paleoecological, paleogeographic, and paleontological 
records of the past, and represent a distinctive lithological feature of rock strata. Fossil presence in rock 
 
190 Allostratigraphy is “a stratigraphical method that subdivides geological sequences based upon a hierarchical 
framework of bounding surfaces or discontinuities that serve to compartmentalize discrete packages of sediment or 
rock” (Lee, 2018, p. 407). The term ‘allostratigraphic unit’ is used by NACSN (2005), while the Guide refers to 
allostratigraphic units as ‘unconformity-bounded units’ or synthem – namely, a “body of rocks bounded above and 
below by specifically designated, significant and demonstrable discontinuities in the stratigraphic succession” 
(Salvador, 1994, p. 46). 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
192 
 
strata is a precondition for biostratigraphic classification – namely, the “systematic subdivision and 
organization of the stratigraphic section into named units based on their fossil content” (ibid.). 
 
The term ‘fossil’ encompasses a vast range of different types of entities. The AWG has adopted 
the definition of ‘fossil’ provided by the International Code for the Nomenclature of algae, fungi and plants 
(ICN).191 This choice considers the ICN’s definition “the most flexible and useful” (Zalasiewicz et al., 
2019b, p. 110) because it distinguishes between fossils and non-fossils based on the stratigraphic relations of 
fossils with their sedimentary context. Most fossils preserved in sediments occur as trace fossils (or 
ichnofossils), namely, traces of organism activity (e.g., footprints, burrows, feces); or body fossils, namely, 
the decay-resistant skeletal or anatomical remains of a dead organism. A third kind is represented by 
chemofossils or biosignatures – that is, signatures of varying size and type that are preserved in nature 
suggesting evidence of life. Geological units throughout the Phanerozoic (< 541±1 Ma) are usually 
characterized by ichnofossils and body fossils, whereas signs of early life in Precambrian units are partly 
based on molecular biosignatures. Fossiliferous rocks are characterized by the presence of fossils of 
organisms that either originated and died in a particular site (biocoenosis), were brought together at the 
moment of their death (thanatocoenosis), or were relocated from their natural environment when alive. 
 
Biostratigraphic units are called biozones – that is, intervals of rock strata defined by their 
characteristic fossil record. Contrary to lithostratigraphic units, biozones are not defined by the lithological 
properties of rock strata, but only by the presence and characteristics of fossils. A stratigraphic boundary 
marked by a distinctive and significant change in fossil character in a rock section is known as a 
biostratigraphic horizon or biohorizon. Common examples of biohorizons are the first occurrence (FO) and 
last occurrence (LO) of a given biological taxon in the rock record – identified respectively with the lower 
and upper biohorizon of a biozone. ‘First’ and ‘last’ occurrence are determined upward (following 
superimposition) in a rock section rather than downward (following the direction of drilling for sampling). 
The total evolutionary history of a given taxon is determined by its First Appearance Datum (FAD) and 
Last Appearance Datum (LAD). FO and LO delimit, and thus define, the biozone of a taxon in particular 
sample or locality, whereas FAD and LAD define the biochronozone192 of a taxon (Saraswati & Srinivasan, 
2016). 
 
Biostratigraphic units differ from other types of stratigraphic units “in that the organisms whose 
fossil remains define them show evolutionary changes through geologic time that are not repeated in the 
stratigraphic record” (Salvador, 1994, p. 53). Because of the irreversibility of evolutionary changes, 
biostratigraphic units uniquely reflect the strata they correspond to, and greatly aid time correlation of strata 
– meaning that they are “more influenced by, and indicative of, geologic age” (p. 100). This is one of the 
reasons why biostratigraphic markers have been widely privileged as a primary marker for defining the base 
of geochronological/chronostratigraphic units. 
 
191 The ICN represents an internationally ratified set of rules and recommendations for botanical nomenclature. 
192 In chronostratigraphy, a chronozone is “the body of rocks formed anywhere during the time span of some 
designated stratigraphic unit or geologic feature” (Murphy & Salvador, 2000, p. 258). Accordingly, a biochronozone 
is the fossil taxa originating during a given time span. 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
193 
 
 
Biozones are not numerical time units. They do not provide a numerical age for absolute time 
correlation. However, given the unidirectional process of evolution and the law of superposition (i.e., 
younger taxa are enclosed in higher strata), fossils also provide the relative age of enclosing strata (NACSN, 
2005, Articles 48a). Application of radiometric dating to fossils (geochronometry) allows to obtain absolute 
numerical ages for fossils. In addition to their wide geological application – often being associated with 
other types of stratigraphic (especially chronostratigraphic), archaeological, or paleontological evidence to 
reconstruct planetary changes – biostratigraphic units or biozones are crucial for providing evidence of 
evolutionary change.

Biostratigraphic research utilizes five common types of biostratigraphic units or biozones to distinguish 
strata based on their fossil content – namely, range zone, interval zone, lineage zone, assemblage zone, and 
abundance zone (Figure 3.3). These biozones allow biostratigraphers to date and correlate stratigraphic 
sequences (Saraswati & Srinivasan, 2016). Unlike lithostratigraphic or chronostratigraphic units, biozones 
are not hierarchical, meaning that a single stratigraphic section can be explored through different zones 
simultaneously. 
• 
A range zone is defined as the “body of strata representing the known stratigraphic and geographic 
range of occurrence of a particular taxon or combination of two taxa of any rank” (Murphy & 
Salvador, 2000, p. 247). Range zones distinguish between taxon-range zones (boundaries defined by 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
194 
 
FO and LO of a single selected taxon) and concurrent-range zones (boundaries defined by overlapping 
segments of range zones between two selected taxa).  
• 
An interval zone is the “body of fossiliferous strata between two specified biohorizons […] defined 
and identified only on the basis of its bounding biohorizons” (p. 248). Its boundaries are arbitrarily 
selected biohorizons that do not necessarily coincide with the range zone of taxa (e.g., the highest-
occurrence zone (HOZ) is defined by the LO of two taxa; conversely, the lowest-occurrence zone 
(LOZ) is defined by the FO of two taxa). 
• 
A lineage zone is the “body of strata containing specimens representing a specific segment of an 
evolutionary lineage” (p. 250). It is determined by a selected segment in the evolutionary lineage of 
a taxon. Its boundaries are based on the biohorizons corresponding to the LO of successive 
phylogenetic taxa. Lineage zones are a unique type of biostratigraphic unit because “they require 
for their definition the reasonable assurance that the taxa chosen for their definition represent 
successive segments of an evolutionary lineage” (Salvador, 1994, p. 61). In most cases, this requires 
paleontological rather than biostratigraphic inference. 
• 
An assemblage zone is the “body of strata characterized by an assemblage of three or more fossil taxa 
that, taken together, distinguishes it in biostratigraphic character from adjacent strata” (Murphy & 
Salvador, 2000, p. 250). Its boundaries are established based on the specific fossil composition of 
the assemblage by arbitrarily choosing (yet providing a sound justification for the choice) the LO 
and FO of determined taxa. Assemblage zones provide valuable proxies for the paleofauna and 
paleoflora of particular regions or areas, and thus are good indicators of past environments and 
geologic age. 
• 
An abundance zone is the “body of strata in which the abundance of a particular taxon or specified 
group of taxa is significantly greater than is usual in the adjacent parts of the section” (p. 251). Its 
boundaries are determined by the notable (statistical) increase in abundance of one or more taxa. 
 
The fossil record is a primary means for reconstructing the Earth’s geohistory as well as the history of life. 
The vast majority of GSSPs used to define the lower boundary of geochronological/chronostratigraphic 
units make use of biostratigraphic evidence as a primary marker. Alternatively, biostratigraphic units can be 
implemented as secondary or auxiliary markers. For instance, all of the Cenozoic epochs (< 66 Ma) are 
characterized by paleontological distinctiveness – from the fifth major extinction event associated with the 
iridium anomaly resulting from an asteroid collision (i.e., the Alvarez Hypothesis) for the Cenozoic lower 
boundary, to the late Pleistocene megafauna extinction associated with the interstadial (i.e., warmer) period 
determining the beginning of the Holocene (11.7 ka). Consistently, a clearly distinguishable biostratigraphic 
marker should characterize the Anthropocene Epoch. 
 
Anthropocene researchers have been discussing what types of biozone would best represent the 
biostratigraphic signature of the Anthropocene (Barnosky, 2014; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 3.1). 
Besides the stratigraphic nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, these discussions stem from recent 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
195 
 
scholarship investigating the evolutionary impact of human niche-constructing activity (Boivin et al., 2016; 
Ellis, 2016b; Ellis & Ramankutty, 2008; Kendal et al., 2011a, 2011b; Laland et al., 2001; Odling-Smee et al., 
2003; Pena Rodrigues & Lira, 2019; Zalasiewicz et al., 2011a). Such extensive multidisciplinary literature 
has analyzed the biological and ecological pressures of human activities on the Earth’s biota, leading to the 
comparison between ongoing rates and magnitude of current extinctions and past mass extinction events, 
and to the conclusion that humans have triggered the Earth’s sixth major extinction event (Barnosky et al., 
2012; Barnosky et al., 2011; Ceballos et al., 2015; Ceballos et al., 2017; Dirzo, 2009; Dirzo & Raven, 2003; 
Kolbert, 2014). The presumed sixth mass extinction event represents an important biostratigraphic signal 
(or pool of signals) of an Anthropocene stratigraphic unit.  
 
But what is a mass extinction event? And how are past and present extinctions measured? Different 
techniques are used to retrieve extinction rates, depending on whether one is calculating past extinction 
rates or future rates. Most of our knowledge of past extinction rates is based on “only two kingdoms,[193] 
plants and animals, over the past 600 million years” (May et al., 1995, p. 2). These are the most documented 
kingdoms in fossil records, during a time period (the so-called Cambrian Explosion) seeing the proliferation 
of multicellular and complex life.  
 
The most common method to estimate future rates of extinction is the species-area relationship 
method, based on estimates of species (S) per area (A) and growth of expansion used inversely to deduce 
species decrease due to habitat loss (Smithsonian Insider, 2011), so that 𝑆= 𝑐𝐴𝑧, where c and z are 
constants (Pimm et al., 1995). 
 
Another technique involves comparing current rates of extinction against background extinction 
rates – namely, the expected rates of extinction during a timespan in the absence of human intervention on 
the Earth’s biota. These rates are derived from fossil records and are commonly based on the average 
lifespans of species per million years, or extinction per million species years (E/MSY). For the past 66 
million years (i.e., throughout the Cenozoic), background extinction rates have ranged from 0.1 to 1 species 
per million species per year (Dirzo & Raven, 2003), with species’ average lifespan between 5 and 10 million 
years (May et al., 1995). Background extinction rates allow us to compare past extinctions with the ongoing 
sixth mass extinction event.  
 
A third method uses the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of 
Threatened Species, or simply Red List, to assess how fast a species has ‘climbed’ the seven-category ladder 
of extinction threat.194 The Red List provides a vast database on the conservation status of documented 
species, and can be used to infer the likeliness of future extinction rates based on how fast a species has 
moved from one status (e.g., Near Threatened) to another (e.g., Critically Endangered). Şengör, Atayman, 
and Özeren (2008) have also distinguished between magnitude, intensity, and greatness of an extinction 
 
193 The term kingdom identifies the second highest taxonomy rank. Traditionally, biological taxonomic ranks are (from 
highest to lowest) domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Other ranks are also used to 
identify sub- or super-ranks (e.g., subspecies, superfamily). 
194 The categories falling under ‘adequate data’ are Extinct (EX), Extinct in the Wild (EW), Critically Endangered 
(CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU), Near Threatened (NT), and Least Concern (LC). Because of lack of data, 
some taxa may also fall under the categories of Data Deficient (DD) or Not Evaluated (NE).

event. Magnitude (M) “is a scalar number signifying the number of taxa constituting the total diversity 
decline” (Şengör et al., 2008, p. 13737); intensity (I) “is the inverse of the duration of the time interval, 
expressed in millions of years (Ma), in which the taxa contained in the M number have disappeared” (ibid.); 
and greatness (G) is the product of the magnitude and intensity of an extinction event, so that 𝐺=  𝑀× 𝐼. 
Whereas rate is not explicit in this equation, time is an implicit factor in I, so that rate and greatness are 
related, yet different, metrics for analyzing extinction events (Barnosky et al., 2011). 
 
Comparisons between the ongoing human-induced extinction and past mass extinction events are 
problematic for several reasons, mostly related to the nature of fossil records (Barnosky, 2014; Jablonski, 
1994). For instance, past extinction events are documented through fossils buried dozens to hundreds of 
millions of years in the past – primarily fossils of marine invertebrates. Conversely, present extinction rates 
are based mostly on terrestrial biota due to a substantial lack of knowledge of marine biodiversity (compared 
with terrestrial biodiversity). Paleontological databases tend to focus on “the more abundant, widespread, 
and geologically long-lived species, which will have the greatest total number of individuals and occur in 
the greatest number of localities and rock types” (Jablonski, 1994, p. 13). Modern rates of extinction based 
on loss of rarer species with limited geographical distribution may not be paleontologically or 
biostratigraphically detectable. Furthermore, modern rates of extinctions require different approaches than 
paleontological events – the former being assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature 
and its Red List, a different operating framework from paleontological studies on extinctions. 
Taxonomically, in these kinds of studies, fossils are usually analyzed at higher taxa than species (e.g., genus, 
family) because species-level fossils are very incomplete and “subject to sampling and preservational bias” 
(p. 11), whereas modern extinction rates are monitored on the species (i.e., phylogenetic species concept) 
taxon level. Barnosky et al. (2011) have highlighted these differences, suggesting possible comparative 
solutions such as “to examine regions or biomes where both fossil and modern data exist […] to use taxa 
best known in both fossil and modern records […] to standardize extinction counts by number of species 
known per time interval of interest,” or “to scale proportional extinction relative to the time interval over 
which extinction is measured” (p. 52).  
Despite methodological issues for comparative analyses, it has been suggested that the 
Anthropocene extinction event should be considered a major extinction event because current extinction 
rates “would produce Big-Five-magnitude mass extinctions in the same amount of geological time that we 
think most Big Five extinctions spanned” (p. 55). Projected into the future, ongoing rates of extinction will 
reach the 75% species loss threshold characterizing the other ‘Big Five’ extinction event in “as little as three 
centuries” (ibid.). However, the ‘Anthropocene extinction event’ has only very limited paleontological and 
biostratigraphic records because of its very recent nature (i.e., fewer fossils occur in younger strata). This 
means that, technically, the ongoing extinction event “does not yet qualify as a mass extinction in the 
paleontological sense” (p. 56) because its biostratigraphic and paleontological legacy is yet to fully unfold. 
For the same reason, characteristic Anthropocene biozones can mostly be defined on their lower limit. 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
197 
 
AWG member Anthony Barnosky (2014) has assessed which types of biozone would best 
represent biostratigraphic signatures of the Anthropocene – and which would not. Range zones are unlikely 
to be used under the current formulation of the Anthropocene Hypothesis because “no new species are 
known to have originated during the past few hundred years” (p. 152).195 If a species were to be selected, 
Homo sapiens would arguably be the most emblematic, both because of the epoch’s naming choice and the 
species’ remarkable stratigraphic footprint on the Earth. However, selecting the first appearance of Homo 
sapiens as the lower biohorizon of a range zone would require (1) extending the Anthropocene to ~300 ka 
– where earliest fossils of Homo sapiens are documented (Hublin et al., 2017) – and (2) locating an upper 
biohorizon that, since our species is not yet extinct, is impossible to locate. Given that neither condition is 
optimal nor satisfiable, a taxon-range zone cannot be used to define the biostratigraphic signature of the 
Anthropocene. Concurrent-range zones could be defined based on the concomitant appearance of a taxon 
of domesticated animals and plants (e.g., pig, cow, horse, sheep, dog, maize, etc.). However, locating the 
lower biohorizon at ~8 ka (i.e., the Neolithic Revolution) has not been considered an ideal biozone, given 
the primary chemostratigraphic signature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis at ~1950 (following section). 
The issues in characterizing Anthropocene range zones also apply in characterizing Anthropocene 
interval zones – that is, no documented species (of stratigraphic value) have originated in the last few 
centuries. Hence, no lowest-occurrence zones can be defined. Barnosky (2014) considers highest-
occurrence zones a possible, yet unlikely, option due to the difficulties in relating documented species 
extinctions in the past 500 years to single-taxon global synchronous biostratigraphic signatures (not to be 
confused with the global synchronicity of different species extinctions). None of the documented extinct 
species has so far provided a worldwide synchronous proxy as sound as other biostratigraphic marks in the 
past epochs. 
Lineage zones are not delimited by “the origin and/or extinction of species,” but rather “by rapid, 
morphologically significant changes within an evolutionary lineage (typically within species)” (p. 153), and 
might thus represent valuable biostratigraphic signatures of the Anthropocene. Changes in species have 
been extensively documented in plant species related to human agriculture. Corn (Zea mays subspecies mays, 
the only domesticated of the four documented Zea mays subspecies) has been considered as a possible proxy 
for delineating a biostratigraphic lineage zone of the Anthropocene because of its pollen and phytolith fossil 
record (Pohl et al., 2007, quoted in Zalasiewicz & al., 2019b, para 3.3.2.1) and because of its present global 
distribution (found on every continent except for Antarctica). However, Zalasiewicz et al. (2015a; 2019b) 
have observed that the diachronous timeline of corn spread documented in its sedimentary record does not 
meet the criteria for characterizing a biostratigraphic signature for an Anthropocene Series.  
Interesting and suggestive evidence of anthropogenically induced morphological changes in 
animals is the bone-size evolution of domesticated chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), the world’s most 
populous bird species. A study from Bennet et al. (2018) compared the red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus, 
 
195 If considered a morphospecies, the broiler chicken could in fact be used as a range zone marker for the 
‘Anthropocene.’ This point is further discussed below.

ancestor of the domesticus) and two broiler datasets with chicken bones collected from archaeological sites 
dating from the Roman era to the 20th century. It is generally after a surge in chicken production from the 
1950s onwards that the greatest morphological changes are observed, with a remarkable threefold width 
increase and twofold length increase of lower limb bones of domesticated chickens compared to red jungle 
fowls of the same age. In terms of body weight, “[b]roilers from a 1957 breed are between one-fourth and 
one-fifth of the body weight of broilers from a twenty-first century breed” (p. 6). Genetically Modified 
Organisms (GMOs) may be considered additional biostratigraphic signatures (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, 
para. 3.1) defined by lineage-type zone. Yet, the utility of lineage zones in characterizing an Anthropocene 
Series “remains to be proven” (Barnosky, 2014, p. 153). 
Barnosky finds assemblage and abundance zones to be the most useful biozones in delineating the 
biostratigraphic profile of the Anthropocene. Assemblage zones could potentially be discernible in the co-
occurrence of neobiota scattered directly (e.g., through domestication) or indirectly by humans worldwide, 
especially over the past two centuries. Essentially, Anthropocene assemblage zones would identify the 
presence of certain related groups of fossilizable species “that are unique associates with respect to the 
fossils of previous epochs” (p. 155). Ichnofossils (especially abundant at 1950 CE) may also provide 
paleontological records to define Anthropocene assemblage zones (Barnosky, 2014). Whilst assemblage 
zones are region-specific, invasive neobiota have been considered “very good Anthropocene markers” 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, p. 119) because they provide a global biostratigraphic signal of ‘alien’ species 
overlying native species in possible future stratigraphic records through biozonation (i.e., the formation of 
biozones). In other words, region-specific assemblage zones can be correlated globally based on the similar 
human-mediated introduction of ‘alien’ species – fulfilling the synchronicity requirement needed to formally 
locate an Anthropocene GSSP. Many neobiotic species have been documented in aquatic as well as 
terrestrial environments worldwide – for instance, Trochammina hadai (a foraminifera living in marine and 
brackish environments), translocated in the early/mid-20th century from coastal areas of the Pacific Ocean 
to the Western US coast, where it rapidly dominated the local environment at the expense of native 
foraminiferal fauna; or rats (Rattus rattus, Rattus exulans, Rattus norvegicus), translocated to all continents but 
Antarctica. The San Francisco Bay and Delta – one of the most invaded estuaries in the world (Cohen & 
Carlton, 1998) – and the Kaua’i island of Hawaii have been used to show biostratigraphic correlation among 
successions of geographically distant regions (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 3.3.3.1, 3.3.3.2). Assemblage 
zones for both successions can be drawn based on the introduction of invasive species (mostly by ship 
transit), the majority occurring during the 20th century. These represent distinctive biostratigraphic markers 
that, despite being limited in terms of time span, can be compared to earlier biostratigraphic signals of the 
Quaternary. 
Lastly, Barnosky (2014) considers abundance zones to be another useful biozone type for defining 
the Anthropocene. Whereas assemblage zones identify the quantity of different taxa in a rock succession, 
abundance zones identify the statistical quantity of individuals of one or more taxa in a rock succession. 
Again, human-introduced neobiota provide evidential support for defining Anthropocene abundance zones 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE

because invasive species can spread and multiply rapidly once introduced. For instance, the zebra mussel 
(Dreissena polymorpha), native to Eastern Europe, now spreads across parts of Western Europe, Britain, and 
North America, and can reach densities of 11,000 individuals per square meter (Aldridge et al., 2004, also 
quoted in Zalasiewicz & al., 2019b, para. 3.3.1; Himson et al., 2020) – displacing native species in the 
process. Cohen and Carlton (1998, also quoted in Barnosky, 2014) recognize that invasive species in the 
San Francisco Bay and Delta area “typically account for 40 to 100% of the common species, up to 97% of 
the total number of organisms, and up to 99% of the biomass” (p. 556). In addition to human-introduced 
neobiota, Barnosky (2014) has suggested that abundance zones could be characterized by “the number of 
specimens that represent human remains preserved in cemeteries or elsewhere, remains of domestic 
megafauna (cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, etc.) preserved in sediments, and remains of wild megafauna 
(animals such as deer, bighorn sheep, antelope, large carnivores, elephants, etc.)” (p. 158). 
 
Ecostratigraphy based on coral reef research has also been proposed as possible biostratigraphic 
marker of the Anthropocene, as reef ecosystems have been sensitive to global changes in marine settings 
throughout their evolutionary history (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 3.4). Humans have extensively 
impacted the world’s coral reefs through water pollution, overfishing, human-induced global warming, or 
alteration of the pH levels of specific water regions (para. 3.4.2) – leaving a mark on coral reefs in the 
process. Severe bleaching events have occurred in recent times, the most prominent occurring in 2016 
across the Great Barrier Reef, around Papua New Guinea and Queensland, Australia. Considering that reefs 
provide stratigraphic proxies for sea surface temperature (SST) during the Cenozoic, human disruption of 
coral reefs can provide an additional bio/ecostratigraphic marker of certain gravity – depending on future 
reef management scenarios. 
 
3.1.2.5 Chemostratigraphic Evidence 
 
Chemostratigraphy concerns “the characterization and correlation of strata based on geochemical 
composition of the sediments, rocks, and rock components of interest” (Saraswati, 2015, p. 93). It is located 
at the crossroads of stratigraphy and geochemistry – the latter being an interdisciplinary discipline 
implementing principles in chemistry to explain large-scale geological systems (Albarède, 2009). 
As of 2021, neither the NACSN (2005; see also Figure 3.1) nor the Guide treats chemostratigraphic 
units as an independent stratigraphic classification method. Different reasons can be conjectured for this. 
Firstly, the discipline itself is very young – the term ‘chemostratigraphy’ only appearing during the 1980s in 
publications on online scientific databases (Ramkumar, 2015). Secondly, chemostratigraphy, while applied 
by all stratigraphers large, is mostly used in the petroleum exploration industry (Ramkumar, personal 
communication, September 30, 2020). Thirdly, no sound group has been advancing the recognition of 
chemostratigraphic units by the North American Stratigraphic Code or the ICS.196 The NACSN mentions 
 
196 The latter two reasons have been suggested by the geologist and chemostratigraphy specialist Muthuvairavasamy

chemical (and physical) properties as characterizing pedostratigraphic (NACSN, 2005, Article 57b) or 
allostratigraphic (Article 58b) units, but litho- and biostratigraphic units also incorporate elements of 
(geo)chemistry (Irabien et al., 2015; Ramkumar, 2015). Chemical signatures are also used to informally 
distinguish lithodemic units (NACSN, 2005, Article 58b), which are bodies of “predominantly intrusive, 
highly deformed, and (or) highly metamorphosed rock, distinguished and delimited on the basis of rock 
characteristics” (p. 1570, Article 31). 
Despite the lack of official recognition of chemostratigraphic classification, analytical chemistry 
can provide useful insights in terms of characterizing and defining the Anthropocene as a formal geological 
unit. Various chemostratigraphic evidence has been advanced in this regard, connected to the various and 
widespread chemical traces left by anthropogenic activities. These traces are mostly recorded in stalactites, 
marine and freshwater sediments, ice cores, polar ice, corals, stalactites, and tree rings (Gałuszka et al., 
2017). For instance, stable Pb (lead) isotopes ratios and 137Cs (caesium-137) radioactive isotopes have been 
used by Irabien et al. (2015) as possible litho- and chemostratigraphic markers, signaling respectively the 
onset of heavy mining activities during the Industrial Revolution, and atmospheric nuclear testing. 
However, as the researchers note, the diachronous nature of lead concentrations and stable isotope ratios 
as well as the high transportability of 137Cs make these chemostratigraphic markers difficult to correlate 
globally (a necessary requirement for formal recognition). 
Another recent study from Gałuszka, Migaszewski, and Rose (2020) considers polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs) as a possible chemostratigraphic marker to define Anthropocene strata. PCBs are a group 
of 209 congeners (a term used to identify variants of a common chemical structure) sharing a basic chemical 
structure (C12H10–nCln). They are artificial chemical compounds first synthetized in 1876. Because of their 
properties (e.g., low flammability, high longevity, resistivity), they saw increasing industrial production and 
commercial distribution after 1929 (Elabbas et al., 2013). PCBs had been manufactured on the industrial 
scale throughout most of the 20th century before studies began to show potential toxic and hazardous 
effects for the environment and human health. They were thus banned in the US (one of the major PCBs 
producers) in 1978, and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001, and are 
now classified as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). 
 
PCBs are mostly detectable in sediments and animal tissues, and are present in lower but 
geographically spread concentrations in air and water. Their chemostratigraphic importance lies in their 
global distribution through atmospheric transport, their synchronous appearance and high persistence, and 
their interaction with microplastics. While PCBs clearly represent a novel sedimentary record, Gałuszka, 
Migaszewski, and Rose (2020) also note some drawbacks in using PCBs as potential stratigraphic markers 
– namely, (1) the uneven geographical distribution of lower- and higher-chlorinated PCBs in, respectively, 
low temperature (e.g., Arctic) and high temperature zones (e.g., the Equator); (2) the lack of sufficient data 
to assess sedimentary PCB longevity on a geological scale; and (3) the fact that environmental PCB archives 
 
and distinctly recognized method of 
plea to formalize chemostratigraphy as an independent 
also constitutes a 
classification.

may be disturbed by factors such as “potential mobility, post-depositional processes and biodegradation” 
(p. 151), resulting in much less clear and detectable markers in the geological future. Nevertheless, marine 
and lacustrine environments reflecting increased PCB concentrations during the mid-20th century may 
provide a valuable marker for an Anthropocene Epoch/Series as of the present. 
The AWG has undertaken extensive research on possible chemostratigraphic signatures of the 
Anthropocene – also “continuing the classic work of Charles Keeling” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, p. 161) 
on carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon-based compounds such as CO2 (carbon dioxide) and CH4 (methane) 
are major topoi of the global environmental discourse, in that they are associated with anthropogenic fossil 
and natural gas combustion, and consequently with the recently documented anthropogenic global warming 
and climate change. In Anthropocene Studies, they have been used as proxies for the ‘Anthropocene’ since 
Crutzen’s (2000) seminal article, and have also been used as evidence for the early anthropocene hypothesis.  
Measurements of atmospheric CO2 have been conducted since 1958 from the Mauna Loa 
Observatory in Hawaii, and may be linked with ice core records which provide a record for the past 800,000 
years (Lüthi et al., 2008). These latter measurements are based on air bubbles trapped within ice layers 
(mostly in Antarctica) and document the alternate glacial–interglacial phases characterizing the Quaternary 
Period (Lüthi et al., 2008). Since the Late Pleistocene (< 0.126 Ma), CO2 concentrations swung between 
~180 ppmv (parts per million volume) and ~260 ppmv. During the Holocene interglacial period (< 11.7 
ka), records from Taylor Dome (Antarctica) ice cores show limited variability – from 268 ppmv at 10.5 ka 
to 260 ppmv at 8.2 ka (Indermuhle et al., 1999). For about 7,000 years, the upper Holocene variability of 
CO2 stabilized at around 285 ppmv. Since 1850 CE, in conjunction with the latter part of the Industrial 
Revolution, CO2 concentrations have increased steadily, reaching 296 ppmv by 1900 and 338 ppmv by 
1978 (Etheridge et al., 1998). As of September 20, 2021, daily observations of atmospheric CO2 
concentration from the Mauna Loa Observatory have been documented at around 413 ppmv197 – a value 
decisively above the Holocene variability.198 
Increase in CO2 concentration is an important proxy of chemostratigraphic value because of its 
consequences, for instance, on the carbon cycle or on ocean acidification. In addition to an increase in 
carbon dioxide concentrations, changes to nitrogen, sulfur, and metal flows have been considered as 
characteristic of the Anthropocene chemosphere. The invention of the Haber-Bosch process for the 
production of NH3 (ammonia) by reaction of N2 (nitrogen) and H2 (hydrogen), and its subsequent 
application on an industrial scale (mostly for producing fertilizers), has had a significant impact on the 
global nitrogen cycle, contributing “double the natural rate of terrestrial nitrogen fixation, and […] around 
45% of the total fixed nitrogen produced annually on Earth” (Canfield et al., 2010, p. 195). This may

198 The reported excess in atmospheric CO2 concentration ppm outside the Holocene variability is an example of 
normative-functional statement (see section 1.3.1), in that documented measures locates the current concentrations 
outside the expected (or ‘normal’) Holocene atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. If these records are used as 
evidence (either auxiliary or primary) for the Anthropocene Hypothesis, then it is inferred that the hypothesis entails 
normative-functional statements – as anticipated in the first chapter.

constitute the greatest perturbance to the nitrogen cycle since its origin around 2.5 billion years ago, and is 
largely reflected in stable isotope ratios. Some consequences, such as the creation of vast hypoxic zones 
(i.e., dead zones) in marine environments, have biostratigraphic rather than chemostratigraphic value 
because species composition responds to these changes (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 5.4.1). Sulfate and 
atmospheric S (sulfur) from coal combustion (associated with commercial applications) has also been 
considered as a possible marker for the Anthropocene, given its dramatic increase during the 20th century 
(para. 5.5.2).  
Additional chemostratigraphic signals of the Anthropocene have been associated with metals and 
their production. Metals (para 5.6) have a long documented history in environmental pollution, with the 
first signs dating as far back as 30 to 40 ka. The global-scale enrichment of Pb (lead), Cu (copper), and Zn 
(zinc) among the Earth’s environments is considered “one of the most important stratigraphic markers of 
the Anthropocene” (p. 178). Their increased distribution since the mid-20th century has been considered as 
a suitable chemostratigraphic marker of the Anthropocene (para. 5.6.3). Researchers have coined the term 
‘anthrobiogeochemical cycle’ to include anthropogenic activity as a structural feature in the functioning of 
metal biogeochemical cycles (Rauch, 2012). 
Most of these signals, from PCBs to greenhouse gasses and metals, represent mostly auxiliary 
evidence in support of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. The most important chemostratigraphic marker 
seemingly matching several requirements for formal stratigraphic recognition is the sudden and widespread 
distribution in the mid-20th century of artificial radionuclides associated with nuclear bomb testing fallout 
(Sanchez-Cabeza et al., 2021; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 5.8). Such a signal is traceable in sedimentary 
material, and has often been mentioned as a global and isochronous signal of primary stratigraphic (and 
chronostratigraphic) value. This marker represents a “unique pattern of radioactive isotopes captured in the 
layers of the planet’s marine and lake sediments, rock, and glacial ice that can serve as a clear, easily detected 
bookmark for the start of a new chapter in our planet’s history” (Waters et al., 2015, p. 47). From July 16, 
1945 – when the first atomic bomb (the Trinity) was tested in the Jornada del Muerto Desert, New Mexico, 
USA – to 1998, when India and Pakistan last tested nuclear weapons,199 a total of 2,419 nuclear tests were 
conducted, 543 of which were in the atmosphere (UNSCEAR, 2000, Table 22). Especially the largest 
nuclear devices, based on thermonuclear fusion (e.g., the Tsar Bomba), left a widespread radionuclide 
fallout signal – generally in 90Sr (strontium-90), 137Cs (caesium-137), 3H (tritium), 14C (radiocarbon or 
carbon-14), and 239Pu (plutonium-239) – peaking during 1961–1962 (Waters et al., 2015), after which a 
decline in nuclear tests followed from international ban treaties. 
Not all radioisotopes generated from nuclear fallout are geologically relevant. This is because of 
their short half-lives – 28.81 years for 90Sr; 30.17 years for 137Cs; 12.43 years for 3H; 14.33 years for 241Pu – 
meaning that they will not be detectable by extant dating techniques in a geologically distant future. With a

half-life of 5,730 years,200 radiocarbon is one of the most “abundant radionuclides dispersed in fallout” 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, p. 198), but its high degree of transportability, its diachronous onset in the 
Southern Hemisphere, and its assimilation in the biotic carbon cycle makes it too weak to be a primary 
marker for the Anthropocene (Hancock et al., 2014). 239Pu has been considered a suitable marker because 
of its significantly long half-life (24,110 years). Its overall stability in sedimentary records will provide 
reliable (i.e., unaltered) archives for future geological records detectable as far as 100,000 years into the 
future (Hancock et al., 2014; Waters et al., 2015; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 5.8.2), after which it will 
decay into 235U (uranium-235), with a half-life of 703.8 Ma. 
Several types of chemical signatures are traceable for the Anthropocene – from POPs, metals, and 
mineral-like compounds to radioactive isotopes and anthropogenic greenhouse gasses. While detecting the 
anthropogenic causes of these chemical traces worldwide is not an issue per se, difficulties arise in 
recognizing them for a formal time unit – especially considering the lack of formal recognition of 
chemostratigraphy by the Guide and NACSN’s Code. Another major difficulty is the lack of knowledge of 
the full extent of anthropogenic alteration of the chemosphere and the Earth System, both in terms of 
composition and future consequences (Chiaia-Hernandez et al., 2017). 
 
3.1.2.6 Chronostratigraphic Evidence 
 
Chronostratigraphy is “[t]he element of stratigraphy that deals with the relative time relations and ages of 
rock bodies” (Salvador, 1994, p. 77). The purpose of chronostratigraphic classification is “to organize 
systematically the rocks forming the Earth’s crust into named units (chronostratigraphic units) 
corresponding to intervals of geologic time (geochronologic units) to serve as a basis for time-correlation 
and a reference system for recording events of geologic history” (p. 85). In simpler terms, 
chronostratigraphy concerns “the taxonomy and classification of geological time” (Lucas, 2018, p. 2) 
through meaningful and useful time units. 
 
The basic conceptual units of chronostratigraphic classification are chronostratigraphic units. These 
are the only time-dependent material categories among stratigraphic units (Figure 3.1) because they are 
based exclusively on the time (either relative or absolute) of formation of rocks, regardless of other 
properties that the rocks exhibit (e.g., lithology, fossil content, remanent magnetism, etc.). A 
chronostratigraphic unit is material in the sense that it represents a “body of rocks that includes all rocks 
forming during a specific interval of geologic time and only those rocks formed during that time span 
[emphasis added]” (Salvador, 1994, p. 78). The ‘time span’ corresponds to specific geochronological units – that 
is, “units of time during which chronostratigraphic units were formed” (p. 77). Unlike chronostratigraphic 
 
200 Measurements in carbon dating often assume radiocarbon’s half-life to be 5,568 years, which is the value originally 
set by chemist Willard Libby when he developed radiocarbon dating during the 1940s. Although more recent studies 
have reported a value of 5,730 years (the so-called Cambridge half-life), the Libby value is still used to avoid 
comparison errors with studies that used this value. For more information, see https://www.radiocarbon.com/tree-

units, geochronological units are abstract, non-material categories reflecting periods of time (i.e., an 
observer can see and touch a Jurassic System, but cannot see and touch the Jurassic Period, the latter only 
representing a time interval), and are therefore not stratigraphic units. Figure 3.4 summarizes the main 
chronostratigraphic units and their respective geochronological units.

Chronostratigraphic units form the basis of international chronostratigraphic chart (see Appendix), whereas 
their correspondent geochronological units define the geological time scale. The apparent redundancy of 
the existence of parallel timescales, as well as the counterintuitive relationship between geochronology and 
chronostratigraphy, have been object of debate in the past decades (Walsh, 2004; Walsh, 2001). Some 
authors (including Zalasiewicz himself) have questioned the utility of maintaining this dualism (Zalasiewicz, 
2004; Zalasiewicz et al., 2004), or proposed a realignment of the ‘dual’ hierarchy (Zalasiewicz et al., 2013). 
Nevertheless, it seems that the majority of geologists seem to endorse the dualism by considering it 
necessary and obvious (Finney & Edwards, 2016). 
 
The stage is the basic rank-unit of chronostratigraphy “because it is suited in scope and rank to the 
practical needs and purposes of intraregional chronostratigraphic classification” (Salvador, 1994, p. 77). The 
lower boundary of a stage is defined through its boundary-stratotype or GSSP (later in this section), which 
can also be used to define the lower boundary of chronostratigraphic units of higher rank (e.g., the 
boundary-stratotype/lower boundary of the Gelasian Stage at Monte San Nicola at Gela, Sicily, Italy, also 
defines the boundary-stratotype/lower boundary of the Quaternary System). Chronostratigraphic units are 
correlated to other types of stratigraphic units (especially biostratigraphic units) to reflect changes and 
events in the Earth’s history, and the higher the rank of a chronostratigraphic/geochronological units, the 
greater the magnitude of those changes. 
 
Chronostratigraphic units have been chosen as international point of reference among 
stratigraphers because they are defined on a universal property: time. The ultimate goal of 
chronostratigraphy is to provide a classification of all rocks in relation to time and, in doing so, to provide 
a comprehensive international scale serving as a reference system for time-correlation (i.e., the International 
Chronostratigraphic Chart). As stated by the Guide, chronostratigraphic units “offer the best promise of 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
205 
 
being recognized, accepted, and used worldwide and of being, therefore, the basis for international 
communication and understanding” (ibid. p. 90). By correlating with other stratigraphic units, 
chronostratigraphic classification “stands out as the basis to reach the ultimate goal of stratigraphy and to 
improve the knowledge and understanding of the Earth’s rock bodies and their history” (p. 103).  
A central concept and method for chronostratigraphic classification is the Global Boundary 
Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), informally known as the ‘golden spike.’ A GSSP is “the designated 
type of stratigraphic boundary identified in published form and marked in the section as a specific point in 
a specific sequence of rock strata and constituting the standard for the definition and recognition of the 
stratigraphic boundary between two named global standard stratigraphic (chronostratigraphic) units” 
(Cowie et al., 1986, p. 5). In practical terms, it is a bronze, spike-like mark (hence ‘golden-spike’) inserted 
in rock strata in a determined location defining the base of a stratigraphic unit and serving as an international 
standard of reference. For instance, the visible golden spike inserted in a Monte San Nicola section 
(stratotype section) in Sicily, Italy, is used to define the lower base (boundary) of the Gelasian Age/Stage 
as well as the Pleistocene Epoch/Series, and the Quaternary Period/System, and serves as a standard for 
global correlation for other Gelasian, Pleistocene, and Quaternary rocks.

The GSSP method has been promising for identifying internationally agreed-upon boundary-stratotypes in 
chronostratigraphy since the 1960s (Lucas, 2018). Currently, the great majority of Phanerozoic 
chronostratigraphic units are defined through this method.201 After a vote held online in May 2019, the

AWG chose the GSSP method to characterize the Anthropocene as a chronostratigraphic unit. A list of 
requirements necessary to propose a geologic section as a possible GSSP have been outlined by the ICS 
and the abridge version (Murphy & Salvador, 2000) of the Guide (Figure 3.5), which has been encouraging 
the standardization of this methodology in chronostratigraphic/geochronological research.202 
 
Requirement (1) establishes the rank-level at which GSSPs are placed, and the position of a material 
stratigraphic section (i.e., a layered rock exposure) where the golden spike is placed. As previously 
mentioned, the selected rank-level for the boundary-stratotype of a chronostratigraphic unit is stage (and 
age, its geochronological equivalent). This choice reflects epistemic gains of a practical and methodological 
nature (see Salvador, 1994, section 9.C.2). The selected position in a material stratigraphic section for 
locating a GSSP is its lower boundary (i.e., the lowermost end of a vertical chronostratigraphic section), 
which represents the boundary-stratotype of chronostratigraphic units. Indeed, chronostratigraphic units 
are not defined by their material content (or unit stratotype), but rather by their beginning (i.e., boundary 
stratotype), which is delimited upward by the lower boundary of the next chronostratigraphic unit (e.g., the 
upper boundary of the Pleistocene (2.58 Ma) is defined by the lower boundary of the Holocene at 11.7 ka). 
This choice followed from methodological issues in defining chronostratigraphic units based on their 
content (Remane, 2003; Walsh et al., 2004). 
 
Requirement (2) requires a GSSP to be defined by a primary marker – that is, the signal that is most 
distinctive of the geological section being considered. For most Phanerozoic units, the primary marker has 
been defined by the first (but also last) appearance datum of a species. This means that primary markers 
are usually of a biostratigraphic nature. Secondary markers of a different stratigraphic nature are also 
necessary to define a GSSP (requirement 2a), and both the primary and secondary markers need to be global 
and synchronous (requirement 2c). The synchronicity requirement is an important aspect of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, and has raised criticism among its detractors.203 Additionally, the selected rock exposure must 
present different characteristics, from having an adequate thickness (requirement 3), being unaltered 
(requirement 5), and being easily accessible (requirement 6). The ICS oversees the choice, evaluation, and 
placement of a GSSP (Lucas, 2018) by appointing working groups within their respective subcommissions. 
The AWG represents the group tasked with assessing whether an Anthropocene type boundary or GSSP 
can be characterized and defined.  
 
The nature of the GSSP methodology has been a debated theme in geological literature (Remane 
et al., 1996; Walsh et al., 2004). Philosopher of science Alisa Bokulich (2020c) has observed that a GSSP is 
not immediately “defined in terms of a numerical ‘absolute’ time age, but rather is defined stratigraphically 
as a precise moment in ‘relative’ time” (p. 53). A GSSP is not chosen based on a given date. Only if “there 
is suitable material at the boundary to be radiometrically dated, then an absolute age may be associated with 
 
202 Another comprehensive overview of the requirements for a GSSP in the context of Quaternary stratigraphy has 
been compiled by Head and Gibbard (2015, see Table 1). The authors also note that “[n]ot every global stratotype 
section will meet all requirements. Common sense and experience usually determine what compromises can be made 
in order to avoid eternalizing the search for the perfect section” (p. 3, Note 1). Indeed, rather than binding 
requirements, these criteria should be understood as more or less flexible research guidelines. 
203 Criticism against the Anthropocene Hypothesis is discussed in section 5.2. 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
208 
 
the boundary, but it is not taken to define the moment in time” (ibid.). This is an important and clarifying 
point for Anthropocene Studies. A GSSP is a conventionally stipulated point that identifies a clearly visible 
and easily accessible (requirement 6a, Figure 3.5) start of a chronostratigraphic unit. It does not immediately 
entail a numerical date, which can be assigned radiometrically ex post, but is rather assigned stratigraphically. 
A numerical date is not constitutive of a GSSP. What is constitutive is the recognizable and globally 
detectable presence of a distinct sedimentary layer, usually (but not exclusively) defined by the first 
appearance datum of a fossil species (requirement 2, Figure 3.5). Therefore, if a numerical date is only 
secondary to the identification of a recognizable sedimentary layer, the question concerning the political 
and historical convenience of locating a GSSP in the history of humanity – whether in the Neolithic 
Revolution, the colonization of the Americas, the Industrial Revolution, the Great Acceleration, or the 
Atomic Age – becomes only secondary to the identification of a distinguished Anthropocene Series. 
Another interesting aspect requiring further investigation here are the apparent epistemic 
challenges posed by the ‘Anthropocene’ to geochronology as well as to the GSSP methodology. In 
criticizing Lewis and Maslin’s (2015a) proposal to locate the beginning of the Anthropocene in either 1610 
or 1964, Clive Hamilton advances that the seemingly lack of a first appearance datum (FAD) as primary 
marker “ought to signal that identification of the new geological epoch can be like no previous one and the 
conventions will have to change (something the AWG is wrestling with)” (Hamilton, 2015, p. 105). This 
statement is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it argues that the lack of a biostratigraphic marker 
represents a unique instance to validate the Anthropocene on different stratigraphic (and perhaps extra-
stratigraphic, e.g., Earth System) grounds – granted that substantial evidence is provided to legitimize this 
exception. On the other hand, it explicitly states that an Anthropocene unit lacks a crucial characteristic of 
stratigraphic and chronostratigraphic units – that is, a valid biostratigraphic marker (such as FAD).204 
Furthermore, by locating a possible GSSP in the radionuclide fallout of atomic bomb testing during 
the 1950s (as currently proposed by the AWG), the ‘Anthropocene’ seems to bypass many of the traditional 
issues faced by geochronology, such as Cleland’s (2011) search for a smoking gun, the issue of precision 
and accuracy in radiometric dating (Schoene et al., 2013), and the uncertainty in retroductive reasoning and 
historical hypothesis (Kitts, 1978; Turner, 2007, 2013) – all these being common in geochronological 
dating.205 Perhaps the degree of consilience (i.e., the convergence of multiple independent explanatory lines 
toward a common explanation) of the evidence or traces shown in support of an Anthropocene unit may 
be one driver to promote changes in the perception of what constitutes geological evidence in the first 
place. On a purely speculative level, preservation of this evidence in the deep future will serve short- and 
long-term future geologists as a valid pool of knowledge to reconstruct the Earth’s late geohistory. Indeed, 
such a scenario has been a central discursive stratagem to either validate or invalidate the hypothesis – as 
later discussed in Chapter 5. 
 
204 Despite biostratigraphic markers play a central role in defining the base of chronostratigraphic units, it is not strictly 
mandatory for any proposed time unit to use biostratigraphic markers as primary makers. Indeed, neither the GSSP 
for the Quaternary nor for any of its subdivisions coincides with a primary marker of a biostratigraphic nature. 
205 These aspects of primarily a philosophical-epistemological nature are further discussed in section 4.2.

Lucas (2018, 2019, 2020) identifies several problems with GSSP-based chronostratigraphy.206 One 
of these is related to the inconsistencies in naming and defining chronostratigraphic units, which Lucas 
(2018) attributes to the diversified methods and practices of each of the twelve ICS Phanerozoic 
Subcommissions (one for every system/period in the Phanerozoic). Terminological inconsistency is an 
aspect also reflected in the different vocabularies implemented among geological cultures. The use of geosol 
versus paleosol in pedostratigraphy by the NACSN and the ICS, respectively, is an example of the lack of a 
unified vocabulary. With respect to chronostratigraphy, naming time units has been one of the first 
geological practices, and some of the names persist today either formally (e.g., Quaternary) or informally 
(e.g., Tertiary, Precambrian). When proposing new chronostratigraphic units, subcommissions may 
introduce new terms rather than using old ones for proposed units (as the Cambrian Subcommission did 
with the ‘Tommotian Stage,’ now ratified as Cambrian Stage 2), or simply used existing ones. Naming may 
also differ across geological cultures and institutions. For instance, in North America, the Mississippian and 
Pennsylvanian constitute two subsystems of the Carboniferous (358.9–298.9 Ma), while in Europe they are 
simply identified as Lower and Upper Carboniferous, respectively.207 Both units (Mississippian and 
Pennsylvanian) appear on the geological time scale and international chronostratigraphic chart.  
Defining time units has also been inconsistent since “other kinds of signals have been used as the 
primary signal of many GSSPs that are non-biotic and that are inherently not able to be uniquely identified 
without other (usually biotic) criteria” (Lucas, 2018, p. 10). This is not directly in contrast with the Guide’s 
second requirement (Figure 3.5), which states that lower boundaries require primary markers usually of a 
biostratigraphic nature. The problem stressed by Lucas is the weight given to a primary signal when 
determined only in relation to other signals. This weighting has not been consistent across 
chronostratigraphic units. Additionally, Lucas (2020) also argues that “we need something better than 
GSSPs with primary signals based on single taxon LOs, which are highly diachronous and subject to 
restricted distributions due to facies changes, taphonomic biases and/or provinciality” (p. 10).208 
Another interesting and problematic aspect of GSSP chronostratigraphy is the question of the 
arbitrary placement of GSSPs. This is an important epistemological aspect of the GSSP because it concerns 
its meaning, application, and its ultimate usefulness. Thus, it is also important for the general 
‘Anthropocene’ debate, where the GSSP has been in the spotlight in multidisciplinary research. As Ager 
(1973) puts it, the issue lies on “whether or not you think that the history of the earth is divisible into units 
by means of natural events (or revolutions) detectable by man. The alternative is a record without natural 
breaks, only divisible by arbitrary manmade decisions. It is, if you like, dogmatism versus pragmatism” (p. 
 
206 Lucas considers inconsistency, arbitrary decisions, reductionism, instability, locality, imprecision, and politics as 
inherent epistemic issues in defining GSSPs. Here, only inconsistency and arbitrary decisions are treated for their role 
within the Anthropocene debate. For additional literature on the history, philosophy, and criticism of the GSSP 
method, see Remane (1996), Walsh (2001), Walsh et al. (2004), Smith et al. (2015), and Bokulich (2018, 2020b). 
207 Interestingly, both the Mississippian and the Pennsylvanian are currently recognized in the 2021 geological time 
scale and international chronostratigraphic chart, where they stand out as the only subsystems/subperiods visible on 
both charts (see Appendix). The Guide does allow for the use of sub- and superunits at unspecified taxonomical level, 
but recommends this practice only when deemed necessary. 
208 Taphonomy is the study of decay and fossilization processes of organisms.

61). The pragmatic approach considers the selection of a GSSP only functional to correlation – that is, a 
GSSP does not have to reflect any particular event because it only needs to be correlatable.209 The Earth’s 
history can be arbitrarily divided as long as correlation of strata around the globe is possible and meaningful. 
Ager subscribed to the ‘pragmatic’ approach by arguing that “[i]t does not matter whether the golden spike 
is hammered in somewhere in England or in France or in China, so long as we can make an arbitrary 
decision” (p. 72). On the opposing side of the pragmatic approach, he identifies event-based 
chronostratigraphy – that is, GSSPs are reflections of events that are attributed significance for 
reconstructing the Earth’s history. Lucas (2018) has subscribed to this stance, arguing that the Earth’s 
history should be divided based on recognizable events, and he expands the definition of event by also 
recommending that non-biostratigraphic criteria be used more often in defining GSSPs (Lucas, 2019). 
Objecting to the ‘pragmatic’ approach, he claims that “[a]rbitrary decisions are random, based on personal 
choice or whim and thus are not based on any system or line of reasoning. Therefore, arbitrary decisions 
are not scientific decisions” (Lucas, 2018, p. 10).  
While Lucas (personal communication, September 10, 2020) agrees with Finney and Edwards 
(2016) that that the Anthropocene constitutes a social and/or political statement above and beyond its 
value as a scientific hypothesis, his observations on the nature of GSSPs are useful for understanding its 
philosophy and application. This is particularly valuable for Anthropocene Studies, where setting a 
beginning through GSSP has seen a substantial political turn. For instance, Lewis and Maslin (2015a, 2015b, 
2018a) have proposed 1610 as a possible GSSP candidate for the Anthropocene. Alongside the stratigraphic 
evidence they provide, the authors advocate that this date “highlights social concerns, particularly the 
unequal power relationships between different groups of people, economic growth, the impacts of 
globalized trade, and our current reliance on fossil fuels” (Lewis & Maslin, 2015a, p. 177). The authors 
make explicit that the broader social and political importance of selecting a beginning comes “only after” 
(Lewis & Maslin, 2015b, p. 142) the geological evidence they provide. However, in an article published on 
The Conversation, Maslin and Lewis (2020) state: 
 
In addition to the critical task of highlighting and tackling the racism within science, perhaps 
geologists and geographers can also make a small contribution to the Black Lives Matter movement 
by unflinchingly compiling the evidence showing that when humans started to exert a huge 
influence on the Earth’s environment was also the start of the brutal European colonisation of the 
world […] Defining the start of the human planet as the period of colonisation, the spread of deadly 
diseases and transatlantic slavery, means we can face the past and ensure we deal with its toxic 
legacy. (no page numbers)  
 
Maslin and Lewis’s (2020) statement is vividly normative – and legitimately so. However, it generates several 
epistemic issues as a statement concerning why and when to locate the beginning of the Anthropocene 
through a GSSP. Either from an event-based or arbitrary-choice–based GSSP, it is stratigraphic evidence 
that requires correlation rather than historical significance. This evidence may (or may not) leave certain 
 
209 This view seems to be shared by present geologists such as Gale and Hoare (2012), who note that “[p]erhaps the 
most important requirement of a GSSP is that it should be suitable for global correlation” (p. 1492). 

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE

marked signals in rocks and strata, and these only determine whether an outcrop can be used as a location 
to place a golden spike. The broader social and political implications of selecting one location and a specific 
time are only considered after a section is thoroughly examined – as is the case with the proposed 
Anthropocene unit. Considerations of a societal nature are not epistemic parameters in the process of 
validating and selecting a golden spike (although politics sensu lato does play a role). 
Postcolonial literature (e.g. Davis & Todd, 2017; Keerer, 2020) has repeatedly stressed the 
importance of using the colonization of the Americas as a possible beginning of the Anthropocene (and 
rejection of the Anthropocene Hypothesis). Yet, aside from Lewis and Maslin’s proposal, most of this 
literature has had little or no interaction with the basic science behind the stratigraphy of the Anthropocene. 
Thus, the empirical content of these proposals is difficult, if not impossible, to assess on purely stratigraphic 
grounds. Feasibly, the selection of one or more starting dates based on normative grounds may have 
generated a semantic overlap between overlap between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. As a consequence, geologists may have grown suspicious of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as 
a political, rather than scientific, idea (Finney & Edwards, 2016).  
An alternative technique only briefly considered by the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2015b) is the use 
of a Global Standard Stratigraphic Age (GSSA). The GSSA method was introduced in 1989 as an alternative 
boundary-type definition for Precambrian units, where fossil records are scarce and correlation more 
difficult. A GSSA defines boundaries in terms of absolute age, providing a conventional numerical date 
that separates time units, for instance, the Archean (4–1.5 Ga) from the Proterozoic (2.5–0.541 Ga). The 
‘conventional’ nature implies that “the numerical value of the boundary age is a theoretical postulate, 
independent of the method applied to obtain numerical ages” (Remane et al., 1996, p. 78). Currently, most 
of the pre-Edicaran (Proterozoic and Archean) time units are divided through GSSAs because of the lack 
of substantial fossil records and clear correlation – both fundamental requirements for locating GSSPs. It 
is a generally less preferred method than the GSSP, which is grounded on physical evidence reflecting 
changes or events that can be correlated. An active effort to replace GSSA-defined boundaries with GSSPs 
has been ongoing since the GSSP became an established methodology – for instance, with the base of the 
Cryogenian at c. 720 Ma (Shields-Zhou et al., 2016).

The AWG (2020) has considered twelve possible locations for defining the stratigraphic profile of an 
Anthropocene unit, and locating a GSSP. Figure 3.6 summarize them. Core samples have been extracted 
from each location and analyzed.210 Preliminary findings indicate that geochemical markers such as 
radionuclides associated to nuclear bomb testing are detectable virtually in all samples, corroborating the 
idea that locating a GSSP around the 1950s is the most suitable option in stratigraphic terms.  
 
A conference/exhibition at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt scheduled for May 2022 will present 
the research undertaken at each site, accompanied by a special publication to be submitted to Anthropocene 
Review in the same year. This will represent an important and necessary step towards the process of 
submitting a formal recommendation for recognizing the Anthropocene as a distinct, post-Holocene 
geochronological and chronostratigraphic time unit.

3.1.3 Remarks on Non-Stratigraphic Evidence 
 
The evidence surveyed in the previous sections does not exhaust the overall scientific and descriptive 
research on the Anthropocene as a possible geological time unit. That is not solely because research on the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis is ongoing, but also because dedicated scientific research extends beyond the 
domain of traditional stratigraphy. As observed at the beginning of the chapter, Earth System science and 
evolutionary biology and ecology are two examples of major disciplinary grounds providing additional 
supporting, non-strictly stratigraphic evidence for the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Earth System science has 
been both historically and conceptually close to the ‘geological Anthropocene,’ since the term primarily 
developed within this disciplinary context and later followed its independent research trajectory. The 
stratigraphic markers located around 1950s largely coincide with Earth System markers. However, as also 
observed by anthropologist Andrew S. Mathews (2020), the Earth System science ‘Anthropocene’ is “quite 
different from the Anthropocene of geologists” (p. 68) because they follow different methodological 
trajectories – notably, the geologists’ quest to locate a GSSP. 
Additional disciplinary domains describe the anatomy of the Anthropocene not solely as a 
reflection of the multidisciplinary nature of this hypothesis, but also of the ontological spectrum of 
phenomena that may characterize an Anthropocene unit. Archaeology and history are two examples of this.  
Archaeology is a discipline historically and methodologically very close to geology (Edgeworth, 
2014b). In 18th- and 19th-century geology, when the age of the Earth was believed much shorter, 
archaeological evidence was often invoked in geological handbooks and research. For instance, in chapter 
XV of his second volume of Note ad un corso annuale di geologia (Stoppani, 1867),211 Antonio Stoppani 
described the ‘Anthropozoic formations’ of the Neozoic Epoch mostly in association with archaeological 
findings across Europe. In the context of the Anthropocene, the recent deposition of anthropogenic 
stratigraphic signals makes them object of interest of archaeologists as well.212 Erlandson & Braje (2013) 
argue that “archeological records can be utilized by scholars to understand not just when humans dominated 
earth’s ecosystems, but the processes that led to such domination” (p. 3). In fact, archaeological research has 
advanced alternative starting dates from the AWG’s selected date, suggesting much earlier beginnings to 
the proposed epoch than the 1950s. Among the topics that emerged withing archaeological discourse, the 
nature of the ‘archaeosphere’ (Edgeworth, 2014a) and its relation to stratigraphy has established a strong 
link between geological and archaeological research – a link that, by the early 20th century (Harris, 1989), 
originated ‘archaeological stratigraphy’ as the application of stratigraphic principles to archaeological 
research.  
 
211 Note represents the first edition of the more popular (and retitled) three-volume Corso di Geologia, published between 
1871 and 1873. 
212 In 2013, the journal Anthropocene published a volume entitled “When Humans Dominated the Earth: Archaeological 
Perspectives on the Anthropocene,” edited by the archaeologists Jon M. Erlandson and Todd J. Braje. The volume 
includes eleven research articles from archaeology dedicated to the onset and definition of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
214 
 
A meeting point between geologists and archaeologists in describing the archeosphere has been 
the recognition of the existence of artificial ground. These are formed “by the excavation, transport and 
deposition of natural geological materials and the accumulation of novel materials […] related to urban 
development, mineral exploitation, waste dumping and land reclamation” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, p. 60). 
According to Edgeworth & al. (2015), the physical traces of artificial ground may provide evidence for a 
diachronous onset in defining the Anthropocene by marking “the division between humanly modified 
ground and natural geological deposits” (p. 1). However, as noted by the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b), 
this is a different research trajectory from considering the Anthropocene as a chronostratigraphic unit 
because “[a]rtificial ground is not in itself a marker for the Anthropocene […] but one that reflects the 
classification of physical deposits” (pp. 61-62). Yet artificial ground may provide a useful characterization 
of the anthropogenic deposits for a diachronous Anthropocene – for instance, by classifying technogenic 
grounds in relation to the properties and time.213 
As discussed in section 1.2.3, history has also provided evidence in support of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis by shedding light over the social and historical mechanisms behind the starting dates proposed 
by the AWG throughout the year. The historical (viz. causal) mechanisms behind global and seemingly 
synchronous anthropogenic signals are not intrinsically part the hypothesis, whose aim is fundamentally 
stratigraphic. Consequently, the explanatory expectations differ profoundly between historians and 
stratigraphers. History can bridge this explanatory gap by providing historical and social insights otherwise 
not accounted by the stratigraphic community – unequipped to deal with such short and human-
characteristic times. Such cooperation is especially beneficial for stratigraphers, in that a historical 
framework is provided for what would otherwise only represent descriptions of certain anthropogenic 
signals of mainly stratigraphic rather than historical interest. 
It is difficult to translate the whole array of anthropogenic influences and signals left on the Earth 
into the domain of stratigraphy – mostly because evidence of anthropogenic forcings is largely abundant 
and ongoing. Discerning what does represent stratigraphic evidence among this vast spectrum of signals is 
a fairly new circumstance for traditional stratigraphic research. Not all anthropogenic signals represent 
material of stratigraphic interest, and they will be even less so from a distant future – that is, from a ‘future 
geologist observer’ viewpoint. Most surface traces will deteriorate to complete dissipation. This is why the 
AWG has been looking for long-lived elements such as lead or uranium radionuclides with longer half-
lives, and thus higher preservation potential.  
The focus so far given has been to the stratigraphic evidence at the core of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. The next section discusses another major and highly debated aspect of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, which is closely connected to the stratigraphy (and particularly chronostratigraphy) of the 
Anthropocene – that is, its beginning.
 
 
213 One proposal on the classification of artificial ground is advanced by Peloggia & al. (2014). The proposal also 
provides an overview on past and present approaches in classifying artificial grounds in geological terms. 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
215 
 
3.2 The Beginning of the Anthropocene 
 
 
For any state of affair or phenomenon, multiple scientific hypothesis can be formulated to explain it. As a 
broader Earth System, geological, and evolutionary phenomenon, the ‘Anthropocene’ idea has engendered 
a pool of diversified hypotheses concerned with its beginning – a key ingredient in defining the 
‘Anthropocene.’214 These hypotheses compete with, challenge, complement, or expand upon the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. Understanding the context and interplay between the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis and its alternatives or ‘competitors’ is not just crucial in framing the broader arena of debate – 
it also represents an intrinsic epistemological aspect of the evolution of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
Therefore, this section scrutinizes this context by analyzing and discussing alternative ‘Anthropocene’ 
hypotheses based on their suggested beginning of the proposed time unit. The discussion builds on existing 
research cataloguing and discussing proposed starting dates of the ‘Anthropocene.’215 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis has been defined specifically as the hypothesis formulated by the 
AWG. Its stratigraphic basis has been summarized in section 3.1. As observed, a necessary requirement for 
proposing a formal time unit on the geological time scale is defining its lower stratigraphic boundary or 
GSSP (at a stage level), which also anchors the beginning of the corresponding geochronological time unit. 
Selecting a starting date is a task conducted only after substantial stratigraphic evidence has been submitted 
for recognition of a discrete stratigraphic unit in the geological records. This having been fulfilled, then a 
discussion over the chronostratigraphic beginning of the unit can take place. 
Following an online vote held in May 2019, the AWG has chosen the GSSP as the primary method 
to locate such a boundary, and the radionuclide fallout from nuclear and thermonuclear atmospheric tests 
during the mid-1950s has been considered a primary candidate to define the lower stratigraphic boundary 
of the Anthropocene. Zalasiewicz et al. (2015b) argue that assessing when to locate the beginning of the 
Anthropocene “is separate from whether the Anthropocene should be formalized or not” (p. 197). However, 
since formal ratification requires setting a beginning, and because the ‘Anthropocene’ would be an empty 
category if no beginning (whether diachronous or synchronous, formal or informal) would be assigned to 
it, setting a beginning is a particularly important task for both the AWG and the ‘Anthropocene’ research 
community. 
 
In fact, defining the beginning of the proposed time unit is perhaps the most crucial and most 
discussed aspect of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and of the overall ‘Anthropocene’ debate. In 
stratigraphy, this is because geological time units, either formal or informal, necessarily require a lower 
stratigraphic boundary or starting date determining the specific time they cover. In the broader 
 
214 Notably, hypotheses over the beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a political, historical, and social phenomenon 
have also been formulated by humanists and social scientists. These, however, are not the primary focus of this section. 
215 See for instance Edgeworth et al. (2015), Lewis and Maslin (2015a), Ruddiman (2018), Santana (2019a), Wagreich 
and Draganits (2018), Zalasiewicz et al. (2019b, Chap 7), and Zalasiewicz et al. (2014c). 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
216 
 
‘Anthropocene’ discourse, this has important historical and social implications for determining when and 
how humans became such a powerful geological agent. Discussions over the beginning and unfolding of 
the proposed epoch have been held among the natural, human, and social sciences using a range of different 
methods and aims that have resulted in several alternative hypotheses. Some of these hypotheses developed 
outside the strictly stratigraphic and scientific endeavor by either coining terminological alternatives with 
different starting dates, or by maintaining the term ‘Anthropocene’ but proposing starting dates based on 
non-stratigraphical parameters – for instance, by considering the political, social, ethical, or environmental 
consequences of a selected starting date. Jason Moore’s idea of the ‘Capitalocene,’ or the broader meaning 
of the colonization of the Americas in ‘Anthropocene’ postcolonial literature, are examples of these 
alternatives. They mostly focus on the historical roots rather than stratigraphic base of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
and locate its beginning in the 16th century by stressing the broader historical, but also the normative, value 
of selecting this time period. This type of hypotheses is not discussed in this section. 
 
Other alternative hypotheses seem to directly compete with the Anthropocene Hypothesis by 
virtue of the methodological and evidential patterns they follow (e.g., stratigraphic signals, GSSP, etc.). But 
what does it mean that these hypotheses compete?  
 
Competing ‘Anthropocene’ hypotheses are those hypotheses sharing the fundamental idea that 
anthropogenic activities may be recognized on the geological time scale, but suggest different beginnings 
from the one currently proposed by the AWG. They share approximately the same type of scientific 
evidence (pedological, chemical, stratigraphical, etc.) and methods (the GSSP or GSSA), or bring new 
evidence or methods relevant within the stratigraphic discourse. They do not implement terminological 
alternatives to the ‘Anthropocene.’ They are competing because, as is common in science, multiple mutually 
exclusive descriptions and/or explanation of a phenomenon or state of affairs may coexist before one 
emerges as the accepted description/explanation of the phenomenon or state of affairs at stake. Given that 
multiple lower boundaries (i.e., beginnings) cannot be located for geological time units, only one hypothesis 
can establish itself as the best description of an Anthropocene time unit.  
 
Not all the proposed starting dates surveyed in natural science strictly compete with the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. The ‘Anthropocene’ as developed within the Earth System science community 
(Syvitski et al., 2020), with its different ‘stages’ and signatures (Steffen et al., 2007; Steffen et al., 2008), is 
not inconsistent with the Anthropocene Hypothesis. It represents a different formulation of the 
‘Anthropocene’ sharing much of the evidence, epistemic actors, and research platforms with the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. In archaeological research, a diachronous onset of the ‘Anthropocene’ has been 
advanced that stretches for thousands of years before the present. Some proponents of a diachronous 
‘Anthropocene’ reject a chronostratigraphy-based definition of the proposed unit. Other proposals 
advocate for using the Anthropocene as an informal designation. 
 
Another way that alternative hypotheses compete relates to the very meaning and scope of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. Thus, competition occurs on three different grounds: (1) recognition of the 
Anthropocene as a formal geochronological/chronostratigraphic unit; (2) selection of the appropriate lower 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE

boundary reflecting the onset of the unit; and (3) determination of what methodology and/or pool of 
evidence (and thus discipline) best encapsulate the range of phenomena distinctive to the ‘Anthropocene’ 
(a task still occupying a central role in Anthropocene research literature). Discerning these levels of 
competition is important to grasp the extent to which the Anthropocene Hypothesis is being contested. 
 
What are, then, the alternative hypotheses to the Anthropocene Hypotheses? Because “[t]he start 
of the Anthropocene depends on the eye of the beholder and the sub-discipline of science being 
considered” (Syvitski & Kettner, 2011, p. 958), it is not easy to classify proposed starting dates in a perfectly 
consistent and exhaustive framework. Perhaps the best way to visualize this landscape of hypotheses is 
chronologically – that is, from the oldest to the most recent proposed starting date. This represents the first 
parameter of selection of a proposed hypothesis as well as the first criterion for organizing the corpus of 
alternative candidates. Because the sum of the hypotheses gathered in the following section covers different 
time periods of human history and prehistory (including one prior to the first appearance of Homo sapiens 
in the fossil record), the most practical and relevant classification divides them within a temporal frame. As 
a result, four clusters of hypotheses have been identified, namely paleoanthropocene hypotheses (1.8 Ma to 11.7 
ka), early Anthropocene hypotheses (11.7–2 ka), modern Anthropocene hypotheses (1500–1945 CE), and contemporary 
Anthropocene hypotheses (1945–1964 CE).216 Figure 3.6 lists all hypotheses for each of these clusters. 
 
 
216 This quadripartite classification adds ‘paleoanthropocene hypotheses’ as an extra cluster to a common tripartition 
of proposed starting dates in Anthropocene Studies literature (e.g. Wagreich & Draganits, 2018; Zalasiewicz et al., 
2014c).

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
219 
 
How have these hypotheses been selected? Finding a consistent method for including and/or excluding 
proposed starting dates is once again a difficult task. However, two main parameters have been used to 
approach extant literature on the beginning of the Anthropocene. The first parameter, as previously 
mentioned, is locating proposals that assign a precise date or time range. All the hypotheses discussed in 
the following section propose (with methods and arguments) a determined beginning to the Anthropocene 
coinciding with some particular important anthropogenic event – either evolutionary, environmental, or 
Earth System. Thus, eventual proposals that do not specifically address or consider a starting date are 
excluded (with the exception of proposed diachronous onsets of the Anthropocene that still specifically 
frame the epoch into discrete stages or phases).  
 
A second parameter distinguishes between descriptive hypotheses and normative hypotheses. As 
mentioned above, preferred starting dates or periods can be assessed based on normative claims of social, 
ethical, and political value. These are mostly based on the meaning and implications of selecting one date 
or another to define the beginning of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Their scope is primarily creating a socially-
oriented narrative of the ‘Anthropocene’ within existing discourses on environmental history, power 
relations, capitalism, and postcolonialism. However, this is a different task that unfolds on a different 
theoretical ground (i.e., the ‘Anthropocene’) than assessing the scientific nature of the Anthropocene as a 
stratigraphic unit (i.e., the Anthropocene Hypothesis). Thus, only hypotheses with discernible descriptive, 
and primarily stratigraphic content, are taken into consideration. While stratigraphic-oriented research is 
emphasized, this parameter does not exclude non-stratigraphic research tout court. Some scientific proposals 
outside the boundaries of ‘pure’ stratigraphy are also considered by virtue of their appeal to additional 
empirical evidence of a scientific nature.  
Lastly, two observations are due. The first concerns the nature of the very discussion concerning 
the GSSP. As anticipated at the beginning of this section, discussions over the lower boundary of an 
Anthropocene geochronological/chronostratigraphic unit via GSSP is a step that comes after a stratigraphic 
profile for the unit has been delineated. As noted by Stanley C. Finney and Lucy E. Edwards (2016), both 
geologists and critics of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, “focusing on the definition of the beginning of the 
Anthropocene can result in the lack of consideration of its stratigraphic content and its concept. It conveys 
the opinion that units of the geologic time scale are defined solely by their beginnings, rather than their 
content” (p. 7). Setting a beginning requires that a distinct stratigraphic profile of any unit is first recognized 
and acknowledged by the stratigraphic community. Selecting a lower boundary for a proposed 
chronostratigraphic unit only ensues after such a stratigraphic profile (characterized by the range of 
evidence discussed in section 3.1.2) is clearly identified. 
The second observation concerns the future outcome of the Anthropocene as a geological time 
unit. It is possible that none of the proposed alternative or competing hypotheses may see a successful 
outcome in the geological community, meaning that an Anthropocene time unit (or any other equivalent 
terminological variant) may not see formal ratification.  

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
220 
 
This would imply three things. First, that an anthropogenic signature cannot or should not (yet) be 
recognized as relevant in a stratigraphic and geological context (in addition to other political and sociological 
aspects involved in the ratification process). This could be either because scientific evidence is considered 
insufficient or unconvincing, or because of the stratigraphic community at large does not consider an 
Anthropocene unit useful for the purpose of stratigraphic research – among other reasons. Second, that no 
‘epistemic void’ (i.e., an unexplained/undescribed but observed phenomenon or state of affairs) would 
result by rejecting all of the competing hypotheses because, borrowing Kuhnian terms, the ‘Anthropocene’ 
would neither constitute a recognized scientific problem nor a puzzle.217 Third, that the ‘Anthropocene’ 
would be best represented as an epistemic category or general term in a non-stratigraphic context. Indeed, 
while rejection of formal ratification would imply rejection of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, the 
widespread use of the term ‘Anthropocene’ in the scientific, but also broader academic and environmental 
discourse, will likely maintain the concept. 
 
3.2.1 Paleoanthropocene Hypotheses 
 
The term ‘paleoanthropocene’ was introduced by Foley et al. (2013) “to mark the time interval before the 
industrial revolution during which anthropogenic effects on landscape and environment [emphasis added] can 
be recognized but before the burning of fossil fuels produced a huge crescendo in anthropogenic effects” (p. 
84). The authors define its timespan from the appearance of the genus Homo around 2.8 Ma (Villmoare et 
al., 2015) to the onset of the Industrial Revolution, which they set as 1780 CE. Their paleoanthropocene is 
considered a “transitional period” that is not intended “to compete for recognition as a geological epoch” 
(ibid.). Thus, it is not defined by a precise beginning (other than the appearance of Homo) and should not 
be related to any geological time unit. Additionally, the authors implement the term in a way that defines 
an interdisciplinary research area – that is, Paleoanthropocene Studies – that is not bounded to global 
change (as with the ‘Anthropocene’), but that focuses on regional scales emphasizing the spatially bound 
and time-restricted relationship of Homo species and Homo sapiens with their surrounding environments. 
 
The meaning hereby attributed to paleoanthropocene is similar to that given by Foley et al. (2013). 
The paleoanthropocene hypotheses surveyed in this section are mostly reflections of early anthropogenic 
landscape and environmental change. Nevertheless, they still provide certain evidence of possible stratigraphic 
interest. If so, then they might also exhibit a degree of indirect competition with the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis by locating a different and much older beginning of the contested epoch. Such competition 
would not occur in stratigraphic terms, but rather in the very meaning of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
Therefore, the term ‘paleoanthropocene’ is considered the most appropriate term to classify all 
pre-Holocene proposed starting dates, and to distinguish these from early Anthropocene hypotheses. 
 
217 Naturally, this does not exclude the possibility that anthropogenic signals may be stratigraphically and 
geochronologically relevant for future geologists (as many are presently arguing), and thus that an ‘epistemic void’ may 
manifest in the future. 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
221 
 
Distinguishing between paleoanthropocene and early Anthropocene hypotheses is important because 
locating an Anthropocene beginning that is precedent, equal, or antecedent to the Holocene has different 
implications for the geochronological reconstruction of the Earth’s recent geological history. 
 
Only two pre-Holocene or paleoanthropocene hypotheses have been identified in extant literature. 
Feasibly, this is because both discourses on the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis began 
by implicitly focusing on the most recent impacts of humans on the planet. Indeed, recent historical periods 
such as the Industrial Revolution, the Great Acceleration, and the Atomic Age have been at the center stage 
of such discourses. Seemingly fueled by the broader environmental narratives of the 21st century, these 
historical time periods gained considerable attention from the geological and scientific community.  
 
One of the hypotheses locates the beginning of the Anthropocene with the early mastery of fire, 
whereas the second places its commencement with the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions.  
 
3.2.1.1 Mastery of Fire (1.8 Ma) 
 
Paleoclimatologist Andrew Glikson (2013) has suggested that the roots of the Anthropocene may be located 
in the first use of fire by early humans around 1.8 Ma, which also facilitated the evolutionary transition to 
Homo erectus.218 His argument builds on archaeological, anthropological, and paleoclimatological evidence 
of discoloration of mammalian bones, charcoal, and ash remains. Glikson defines the Anthropocene as 
consisting of three stages, namely Stage A (Early Anthropocene),219 representing the early manipulation of 
fire by H. ergaster (an extinct species or subspecies of early humans of a debated nature) about 2 Ma; Stage 
B (Middle Anthropocene), representing the Neolithic Revolution; and Stage C (Late Anthropocene), 
coinciding with the beginning of fossil fuel combustion in the Industrial Revolution. Stage A is a 
“geologically fundamental step” (p. 91) because it represents the condition of possibility for the other stages 
to occur; because of its possible consequences in altering the glacial–interglacial Quaternary cycles; and 
because human-controlled fire has since then been increasing “planetary entropy to levels approaching 
those of global volcanic events and asteroid impact events” (ibid.). 
Additionally, Glikson stresses the evolutionary importance of the mastery of fire for the Homo 
genus, constituting “an essential anthropological development, with consequences related to bipedalism, 
brain size and the utilization of stone tools” (2013, p. 90). Control of fire is considered one of the most 
important skills acquired by humans, and it had cascading evolutionary as well as cultural consequences. 
Attwell et al. (2015) suggest a spectrum of the consequences of fire uses. The effects of firelight on the 
hormonal production of melatonin may have contributed to the development of sleep patterns (i.e., 
 
218 Literature has often described H. erectus as an evolutionary descendant of H. habilis through anagenesis (i.e., the 
evolution from one species to another implying the disappearance of the parent species). The relationship between 
the two taxa has been subject to debate, with authors (Spoor et al., 2007) suggesting that the two taxa evolved through 
cladogenesis (i.e., the evolutionary splitting of a parent species into two distinct species). 
219 Glikson’s use of ‘early Anthropocene’ coincides with ‘paleoanthropocene’ in the classification proposed in this 
section. 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
222 
 
photoperiodicity). The warmth and sheltering services of campfires allowed for larger and cognitively 
challenging social structures, which stimulated gathering together and having communicative interactions, 
hence increasing sociality. Northward migrations into cooler regions may have required populations to 
manipulate fire in order to survive colder temperatures during glacial phases, hence geographical spread 
could have been boosted by fire use. Cooking raw meat and plants had fundamental dietary consequences 
often associated with evolutionary responses, such as a decrease in jaw and tooth size, a less energy-
consumptive digestive apparatus, and an increase in brain size. Overall, fire manipulation ignited “the 
unique trajectory of hominin evolution toward modern human morphology, behavior and culture” (p. 13). 
Stratigraphically, signals associated with the early use of fire are only restricted to a few sites, and 
are often diachronous, since different stages of fire control (i.e., ignition, maintenance, etc.) were only 
achieved gradually (Attwell et al., 2015). Hence, they cannot be used as primary marker for a 
chronostratigraphy-based Anthropocene unit. Additionally, earliest instances of fire manipulation are 
difficult to distinguish from naturally occurring fires. While differentiating between anthropogenic and 
natural fires may be possible by calculating the fire temperature at the time it was burning, “there is little 
that can be done to identify naturally occurring fires that may have been utilized by hominins as and when 
they occurred prior to their ability to control it even for a short period of time” (p. 3). 
Glikson’s Paleoanthropocene Hypothesis provides a genealogical explanation of the Anthropocene 
by tracing its causal roots to one of the most fundamental steps in the evolutionary history of the Homo 
genus. The suggestion of predating the beginning of the Anthropocene to the discovery of fire is also 
supported by the political theorist and anthropologist James C. Scott (2017).220 In his book Against the Grain, 
the author suggests that the beginning of the ‘thin’ Anthropocene (versus the ‘thick’ Anthropocene, the 
more recent proposals considering human population numbers) could be dated “with the use of fire, the 
first great hominid tool for landscaping – or, rather, niche construction” (p. 3). Nevertheless, the AWG 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 7.3.2) has not considered its stratigraphic basis sufficient for any formal 
recognition on the geological time scale. Even more problematic is the rank level that such a beginning 
would imply for the division of the Quaternary in respect to other established time units. Therefore, while 
framed as a competing hypothesis, Glikson’s hypothesis is perhaps best understood as a broader study on 
the earliest signs of environmental modification by Homo. 
 
3.2.1.2 Pleistocene Megafauna Extinctions (∼13.8 ka) 
 
In a less deep proposal timewise, Doughty et al. (2010) associate a rapid increase in the plant genus Betula 
across Siberia, Alaska, and the Yukon, documented in pollen data at ∼14–15 ka, with the Late Pleistocene 
megafauna extinction, particularly that of mammoths. They hypothesize that climatic reasons alone cannot 
 
220 In his presentation “Anthropogenic Fire as the Hinge between Earth System and Strata,” held in occasion of the 
MPIWG Workshop “Anthropogenic Makers” (Berlin, September 23, 2021), social scientist and environmental scholar 
Nigel Clark has also advocated for an early beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ coincident with the use of fire. 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
223 
 
explain this increase in Betula, and that mammoth extinction was driven by the arrival of humans in those 
regions. Based on their model, which correlates Betula increase with changes in global climate, the authors 
conclude that “the human influence on climate began even earlier than previously believed […] and that 
the onset of the Anthropocene should be extended back many thousand years” (p. 4), namely ∼13.8 ka.221 
 
The Late Pleistocene extinction or Late Quaternary Extinction (LQE) was an extinction event 
documented between 50 ka and 10 ka (Burney & Flannery, 2005; Koch & Barnosky, 2006), with earliest 
extinctions dated around 130 ka (Sandom et al., 2014; van der Kaars et al., 2017). The event killed off about 
half of the Earth’s terrestrial mammal megafauna (i.e., mammals weighing > 44 kg). All continents except 
Antarctica were affected (DeSantis et al., 2019; van der Kaars et al., 2017; Villavicencio et al., 2016), with 
Africa showing the lowest rates of extinction.222 Extinct species included the giant beaver, saber-tooth cat, 
and giant ground sloth in North America; the glyptodont and the tree-toed liptoderm in South America; 
woolly mammoths and rhinoceros in Eurasia; and the largest marsupial ever documented, the Diprotodon, 
in Australia (Koch & Barnosky, 2006). The extinction was the most profound in South America, where 52 
genera and at least 66 species went extinct (Villavicencio et al., 2016, quoting Brook & Barnosky, 2012). 
LQE is not considered a mass extinction, yet it represents a unique occurrence because it unfolded “almost 
instantly on an evolutionary timescale and had a disproportionate bias for megafauna” (Haynes, 2018, p. 
219). 
Multiple hypotheses have attempted to explain the causes of the sudden and widespread 
disappearance of large mammals. Overall, these hypotheses either attribute the extinction to climate change, 
or to the widespread appearance of humans among regions where extinctions are documented (Burney & 
Flannery, 2005). More recently, combined models have been proposed, suggesting that “humans 
precipitated the extinction in many parts of the globe through combined direct (hunting) and perhaps 
indirect (competition, habitat alteration and fragmentation) impacts, but that late Quaternary environmental 
change influenced the timing, geography, and perhaps magnitude of extinction” (Koch & Barnosky, 2006, 
p. 240). Braje and Erlandson (2013) also suggest that the LQE and ongoing rates of extinction are part of 
a continuum that has unfolded over a multi-millennial time scale, and that defining a date “is less important 
than understanding that the mass extinction we are currently experiencing has unfolded over many 
millennia” (Braje & Erlandson, 2013, p. 20). 
 
The AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b) has not directly addressed the hypothesis advanced by 
Doughty et al. (2010). However, the AWG states that the LQE “suffers from being time transgressive over 
 
221 The authors do not explicitly state that this numerical starting date (∼13.8 ka) should be considered the starting 
date for the Anthropocene. In fact, the quoted statement includes a bibliographic reference to Ruddiman (2003), 
which dates the beginning of the Anthropocene to 7 ka or 5 ka (section 3.2.2.3). Furthermore, the authors are not 
directly engaging with the Anthropocene debate (aside from a brief mention in the concluding section of the research 
article), but are rather assessing possible early anthropogenic signals of global geographic and temporal relevance. 
Nevertheless, their analysis can be interpreted as an alternative, non-stratigraphic hypothesis in locating the onset of 
the proposed epoch. 
222 Compared to other continents, Africa represents an anomaly in documenting the LQE. Koch and Barnosky (2006) 
offer three possible explanations for this anomaly. First, small game hunting and food gathering was abundant, hence 
more remunerative than hunting larger prey. Second, African human population density was lower compared to 
human populations on other continents. Third, African ecosystems provided more refuge from human predation. 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
224 
 
some 50,000 years, and even setting a boundary at the youngest pulse of extinction mean that the 
Anthropocene largely overlaps the Holocene” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, p. 116). Therefore, the proposed 
starting date at ∼14–15 ka, being regionally restricted and part of a broader diachronous trend, cannot be 
used as a chronostratigraphic marker. 
 
3.2.2 Early Anthropocene Hypotheses 
 
Existing literature has often used the label ‘early Anthropocene hypothesis’ in two ways: broadly, to identify 
any suggested date predating the beginning of the Anthropocene of millennial scales (including 
paleoanthropocene hypotheses); or specifically, to refer to William Ruddiman’s hypothesis, which suggests 
the onset of the agricultural revolution as beginning of the Anthropocene. In this section, early 
Anthropocene hypotheses are defined as those hypotheses whose proposed starting dates are situated 
between the Holocene (11.7 ka) and the beginning of Modern history (as a category used in European 
historiography) at approximately the end of the 15th century. This cluster of proposed starting dates differs 
from paleoanthropocene hypotheses in recommending dates within the Holocene range, and from modern 
Anthropocene hypotheses in extending the proposed beginnings to thousands of years (rather than 
hundreds) in the past. 
 
Five proposed starting dates have been recognized in extant literature. One considers human niche 
construction as reference framework to assign a starting date. A second hypothesis provides archaeological 
and historical evidence supporting a starting date at 10 ka. A third one, the Ruddiman Hypothesis, focuses 
on the onset of the Neolithic Revolution, and has been a major competitor of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. A fourth hypothesis considers lead contamination during the Late Bronze Age, and the fifth 
hypothesis considers anthropogenic soils as a possible golden spike for the Anthropocene. 
 
3.2.2.1 Human Niche Construction (∼11–9 ka) 
 
In an article entitled “The onset of the Anthropocene,” archaeologists Bruce Smith and Melinda Zeder 
(2013) argue that significant human niche construction or ecosystem engineering associated with 
domestication provide a clear and unequivocal signal in both the archaeological and stratigraphical record 
to date the beginning of the Anthropocene at ∼11–9 ka. The authors recognize that the proposed boundary 
almost completely overlaps with the Holocene (11.7 ka), hence they believe it “more accurate, and more 
useful, to consider the two epochs to be one and the same or coeval […] and that the various boundary 
points that have been proposed over the past decade as marking the Holocene–Anthropocene boundary 
are more fruitfully recognized as defining successive phases within the Holocene/Anthropocene epoch” 
(p. 9). This proposed starting date aims at stressing the causes, rather than the effects, of human behavior 
by emphasizing the broader utility of an Anthropocene time unit for understanding “the long term and 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
225 
 
richly complex role played by human societies in altering the earth’s biosphere” (p. 12). Lastly, the authors 
suggest that a Holocene/Anthropocene time unit may be recognized by the ICS and IUGS to accommodate 
both the scientific context, where ‘Holocene’ would be employed, and the broader discourse, where 
‘Anthropocene’ has most seen interest. 
 
The authors’ reference framework is that of human niche construction (HCN) – an application of 
niche construction theory (NCT) to human evolution. NCT is a proposed extended version of standard 
evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the evolutionary role of organisms’ niche-constructing activities 
(Baedke et al., 2020; Matthews et al., 2014; Odling-Smee et al., 2003). Essentially, the theory states that 
every organism, by altering its and other species’ environments through niche-constructing activities, may 
actively modify natural selection pressures, so that “evolution by niche construction is a possible outcome” 
(Laland et al., 2016, p. 192). This implies that niche construction should be considered an evolutionary 
force in addition to natural selection, acting through both ecological and genetic inheritance (Odling-Smee 
& Laland, 2012) – a view not represented by the current evolutionary framework (where species passively 
adapt to the environmental pressures they are subject to). 
 
A HCN framework highlights the role of humans as land-forming organisms with highly complex 
cultural traits to understand the evolutionary and ecological consequences of their niche-constructing 
activities (Pena Rodrigues & Lira, 2019). Plant and animal domestication has been considered an important 
case study of evolutionary consequences of HNC (see Zeder, 2016, p. 327, Table 1). Laland et al. (2001) 
suggest that “[t]he persistent domestication of cattle and the associated dairying activities may have altered 
the selective environments of some human populations for sufficient generations to select for genes which 
today confer greater adult lactose tolerance” (p. 24). Zeder (2016) considers domestication an opportunity 
to reconsider the pace of evolutionary change as well as “an ideal system for exploring the role of acquired 
behaviors and cultural transmission in the profound evolutionary changes that transformed both plant and 
animal domesticates and human domesticators” (p. 341). Similarly, B. D. Smith (2011, 2016) recognizes the 
major evolutionary role that early anthropogenic domestication of plants and animals had on the Earth’s 
history. 
 
The AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 7.3.3) has primarily contested the diachronous nature 
of human niche construction associated with early domestication, the signals of which are mostly 
terrestrial.223 Both evolutionary eco-biology and stratigraphy share the basic idea that humans have become 
the ultimate niche constructor or ecosystem engineer (Smith, 2007). However, not all archaeological, 
biological, and ecological data associated with domestication can immediately be translated into a 
stratigraphic marker for the Anthropocene – which requires global correlation and synchronous evidence. 
Additionally, and consistently with their nature, the determination of geological units “hinges much more 
on effect than on cause, not least because of the importance of strata, which are the physical archives of 
 
223 Marine signals are better preserved because they are not subject to surface sources of erosion. This is also the Guide 
stresses the importance of marine settings for locating a GSSP. 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
226 
 
elapsed Earth processes, in their definition” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, p. 15). This goes against Smith and 
Zeder’s argument for stressing the causes of the Anthropocene, which is beyond the task of stratigraphy. 
 
3.2.2.2 Homo sapiens Diaspora (∼10 ka) 
 
Similarly to the time-range proposed by Smith and Zeder (2013), archaeologists Jon Erlandson and Todd 
Braje (2013) selected ∼10 ka as beginning of the Anthropocene. The date represents the moment “after 
anatomically modern humans spread beyond Africa and Eurasia to Australia and the Americas, then 
domesticated a variety of plant and animal species” (p. 1). The authors consider the time selected to be a 
possible historical landmark characterized by a widespread and diversified domestication of animals and 
plants associated with the diaspora of Homo sapiens across all continents except Antarctica. Domestication 
and agriculture were particularly important moments for the history of human civilizations, leading “to a 
fundamental realignment in the relationship of humans to their local environments” (p. 5). In addition to 
the archaeological evidence and historical relevance of the selected date, the authors provide a stratigraphic 
proxy for the year 10 ka: “the appearance of shell middens and other anthrosols in coastal, riverine, and 
lacustrine settings worldwide” (pp. 5–6).  
 
Because the proposed starting date suggested by Erlandson and Braje (2013) largely overlaps with 
the current time span covered by the Holocene Epoch, Braje (2016) has considered the best option “to 
merge the Holocene and Anthropocene into a single geological unit” (p. 509). He argues that, given that 
the Holocene already entails anthropogenic activities (e.g., the Pleistocene Megafauna extinction, 
deforestation), it would be more useful to officialize a Holocene/Anthropocene Epoch to include long-
term human impacts. This solution is also endorsed by Smith and Zeder (2013), discussed in the preceding 
section. 
 
3.2.2.3 The Ruddiman Hypothesis (∼7/5 ka) 
 
The Ruddiman Hypothesis (also known as the ‘Early Anthropocene Hypothesis’ or ‘Early Anthropogenic 
Hypothesis’) is a hypothesis originally proposed by paleoclimatologist William F. Ruddiman in 2003 
(Ruddiman, 2003; for a latest update, see Ruddiman et al., 2020). It is one of the most viable competitors 
of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and has found substantial support from archaeological research in recent 
literature (Edgeworth et al., 2019; Edgeworth et al., 2015; Erlandson & Braje, 2013; Ruddiman, 2017). The 
hypothesis locates the beginning of the Anthropocene (or informal ‘anthropocene,’ as later explained) 
within the Neolithic Revolution, when agricultural practices supposedly began to substantially impact land 
and climate. Specifically, Ruddiman associates the beginning of the proposed epoch with an anomaly in 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
227 
 
CO2 (carbon dioxide) and CH4 (methane) at 7 and 5 ka respectively.224 The steady buildup of these pre-
industrial greenhouse gasses caused warming of ~0.8 °C by 1800 CE, sufficient enough to delay the next 
ice age. If this is the case, then human actions became a significant global event thousands of years before 
the present. 
The hypothesis builds on three arguments. The first argument considers the anomaly inconsistent 
with the cyclic variations of the past 350,000 years driven by Earth-orbital changes as recorded in the Vostok 
ice core (Petit et al., 1999).225 CH4 and CO2 were expected to follow their natural downward trends. In the 
case of CH4, a match between methane and orbital insolation (i.e., the incident solar energy in a given time 
over a specific object or location) reveals a 23,000-year cycle mostly reflected in tropical monsoon changes 
(ibid.). According to this orbital-monsoon model, CH4 levels from 5 ka onwards should have continued 
following the downward trend. Instead, increasing CH4 ppb concentrations have been documented in ice 
records in Greenland (Blunier et al., 1995) and Antarctica (Indermühle et al., 1999; Monnin et al., 2001). 
Likewise, Ruddiman (2003) argues that an increase in CO2 documented at 8 ka (Indermühle et al., 1999) is 
also anomalous. Establishing ‘natural’ orbital-scale variations for carbon dioxide is more complex than 
methane because it follows multiple longer orbital insulation cycles whose origins are not fully understood. 
Hence, Ruddiman has suggested that it is essential to either compare the Holocene to previous interglacial 
periods, or “to examine the CO2 trends at each of the three major orbital cycles, define their natural phasing 
with respect to changes in the corresponding orbital parameters, and then project this average long-term 
phasing forward into the Holocene” (Ruddiman, 2003, p. 267). In both instances, the CO2 rise represents 
an anomaly. 
 
The second argument considers paleoclimatic evidence to reject explanations of the anomaly based 
on natural forcing. Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the apparent CH4 and CO2 anomaly 
(Ruddiman, 2017). Most have considered its cause a combination of natural factors. For instance, 
Indermühle et al. (1999) consider the anomaly “a combination of growth and decay of terrestrial biomass, 
and an increase in global mean SST, possibly with a contribution from the marine calcite cycle” (p. 125). 
Broecker et al. (1999) also associate the increase in CO2 beginning at 8 ka with natural causes related to 
cessation of forest expansion. Ridgwell et al. (2003) provide an explanation of the CO2 anomaly by focusing 
on shallow water carbonate buildup from coral reefs and other sources. Schmidt et al. (2004) suggest that 
CH4 emissions from boreal wetlands and river deltas may have increased over the last 5,000 years, adding 
up to tropical hydrological changes as expected by Ruddiman (2003), thus considering anthropogenic 
forcing inconclusive. Ruddiman (2003, 2017) considers none of the suggested explanations above to be 
suitable for explaining the CH4 and CO2 anomaly. By “process of elimination” (Ruddiman, 2003, p. 272), 
and by associating inefficient early rice farming with CH4 emissions by 5 ka (Ruddiman et al., 2008; 
 
224 Originally, Ruddiman (2003) proposed 8 ka as the date for the CO2 increase. However, later publications (Ruddiman 
& Ellis, 2009; Ruddiman et al., 2020) pointed to 7 ka as a more suitable marker. The former is date is based on Vostok, 
whereas the latter date is retrieved from Dome C – both drilling sites in Antarctica. 
225 Latest revisions of the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) Dome C records were able to 
reconstruct the history of atmospheric CO2 concentrations for the past 800,000 years (Bereiter et al., 2015), extending 
the analysis by Petit et al. (1999) on Vostok ice cores as originally used by Ruddiman. 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
228 
 
Ruddiman & Thomson, 2001) and forest clearance with CO2 by 7 ka (Ruddiman, 2003; Ruddiman & Ellis, 
2009; Ruddiman et al., 2020), Ruddiman considers anthropogenic forcing the most plausible explanation 
for the anomaly. 
 
This brings us to the third and final argument. Ruddiman (2003, 2005, 2017) draws on 
archaeological, cultural, historical, geographical, and geologic evidence to argue that anthropogenic signals 
associated with agricultural practice are the most suitable explanation for the CH4 and CO2 anomaly. This 
view is also opposed to locating the beginning of the Anthropocene (as a term defining the earliest global 
impact of anthropogenic activities) either at the Industrial Revolution or around the 1950s. The arguments 
rely on two points, the first of which is based on a ‘hare versus tortoise’ analogy.  
 
The analogy goes as follow. On the one hand, the average yearly GtC (gigaton carbon) emissions 
since the Industrial Revolution are an estimated 0.8 GtC/year, totaling 160 GtC over 200 years. On the 
other hand, pre-industrial average rates are estimated at 0.04 GtC/year, totaling 320 GtC over 7,800 years. 
Although slower, the pre-industrial ‘tortoise’ (the agriculture) started much earlier than the industrial ‘hare,’ 
and hence is ahead of the race (i.e., it has a larger cumulative GtC impact).  
 
The second point is based on the role of forest clearance associated with agriculture across Eurasia 
in contributing to the CO2 rise between 8 ka and 1800 CE. This point, Ruddiman argues, needs three forms 
of validation: “(1) clearance must begin near 8 ka (when the CO2 rise began) on a small, yet ‘non-negligible’ 
scale; (2) clearance must grow large enough by ∼2 ka to explain ∼80% of the pre-industrial CO2 anomaly; 
and (3) the negative CO2 oscillations of 4 to 10 ppm after 2 ka also need an explanation” (Ruddiman, 2003, 
p. 273). Ruddiman gathers evidence supporting all three tests, arguing that land clearance occurred alongside 
agriculture, that it constituted the major anthropogenic source of carbon, and that negative CO2 oscillations 
can be explained through plagues and consequent disease-driven reforestation. 
 
The Ruddiman Hypothesis is not intrinsically a stratigraphic hypothesis in the way the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis is formulated. This is confirmed by the author’s preference of an informal 
‘anthropocene’ (non-capitalized), which he considers more useful than a chronostratigraphy-based 
Anthropocene (Ruddiman, 2018). In fact, Ruddiman has argued “against any formal definition of the 
Anthropocene” (ibid., p. 457) because of the time-transgressive nature of anthropogenic alteration of the 
planet, which cannot be reduced to an isochronous marker such as the GSSP. 226 The original aim of the 
hypothesis is to explain an anomalous CH4 and CO2 increase at 7 ka and 5 ka respectively in paleoclimatic 
records – with special emphasis on carbon dioxide, which has seen a “much more vigorous” (Ruddiman et 
al., 2020, p. 2) debate over the years. The explanation suggested is that anthropogenic forest clearance 
associated with agriculture caused climatic anomalies, and thus pre-industrial anthropogenic activities 
should be accounted for in considering planetary alterations. Yet, because the hypothesis attributes 
anthropogenic causes to the anomalies, and stresses the higher order of magnitude of the cumulative 
anthropogenic CH4 and CO2 emissions in pre-industrial times compared to industrial cumulative emissions, 
 
226 Interestingly, Ruddiman (2018) addresses the AWG as Anthropogenic Working Group, further stressing his rejection 
of the use of ‘Anthropocene’ as a formal geological time unit. 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
229 
 
it also emphasizes the geological, stratigraphic, and climatic significance of early human societies in altering 
the Earth’s climatic trajectory. For this reason, its claims of anthropogenic planetary changes partially 
overlap with those of the Anthropocene Hypothesis in attributing geological and stratigraphical significance 
to a certain period of human history. Consequently, the hypothesis has been part of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
conversation almost since the term appeared among academic circles. 
 
Ruddiman’s rejection of a formal Anthropocene time unit implies that the Ruddiman Hypothesis 
does not, technically speaking, compete in locating a formal (i.e., GSSP-based) beginning of the 
Anthropocene, and generally in granting formal status to the proposed unit on the geological time scale. 
This is because the time-transgressive nature of the Anthropocene does not find in the GSSP a suitable 
methodology of study (Ruddiman, 2018, see also section 5.2.2). What other members of the AWG 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2019a; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 7.3.4) consider an epistemic weakness of the 
hypothesis (i.e., being diachronous) is, for Ruddiman, an argument against formal ratification of the 
Anthropocene as a chronostratigraphic unit. By his considerations, his suggestion of treating the 
‘anthropocene’ as an informal designation allows a more inclusive account of earlier anthropogenic 
activities. In turn, this enables scientists to use the term more flexibly to define different phases of the 
‘anthropocene,’ such as “the ‘early agricultural anthropocene’, the ‘pre-industrial anthropocene’, the 
‘industrial-era anthropocene’, the ‘post-nuclear (late 1900s) anthropocene’, and others” (Ruddiman, 2018, 
p. 457). 
 
3.2.2.4 Late Bronze Age Hypothesis (3/2 ka) 
 
Geologists Michael Wagreich and Erich Draganits (2018) consider two peaks in Pb (lead) contamination 
from early mining and ore smelting at 3 and 2 ka as a possible lower boundary for a GSSP-based 
Anthropocene unit. The peaks coincide with or follow the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age (~3.6–3 
ka). This represents a historical period seeing the development and spread of mining and smelting 
techniques for bronze and iron production across human societies. The authors use chemostratigraphic 
signals (specifically, changes in lead isotope ratios) recorded in ice cores in the Northern Hemisphere as a 
primary marker for defining a possible lower base of the Anthropocene. 
 
At present, lead is the most distributed toxic metal in the world because of its range of applications 
in human industry (Cheng & Hu, 2010). The possibility of using atmospheric lead contamination from ore 
smelting as a possible signal of an early Anthropocene had already been considered by Krachler et al. (2009), 
whose study is also used by Wagreich and Draganits (2018) in support of their hypothesis. Krachler et al. 
(2009) attempted a historical reconstruction of As (arsenic) and Bi (bismuth) based on ice cores from Devon 
Island, Canada, between 15,876 ka and 1870 CE. Because both As and Bi (in minor quantities) are often 
present in metals such as copper and lead, smelters produce both elements as particulates that can deposit 
in water bodies or rocks and can thus be used as a proxy for human activities. The authors determined 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
230 
 
background rates of As and Bi normalized to Sc (scandium)227 and compared them with Holocene rates, 
finding much greater values for the latter especially around 3 ka and 2 ka. The suggested explanation is 
correlated with historical and archaeological findings of mining and smelting of lead ores, which released a 
substantial amount of Pb but also As and Bi in the atmosphere. The authors advanced that “the 
environmental impacts of metallurgical activities undertaken by past societies and civilizations have been 
more extensive and had more profound impacts and greater implications than previously believed” (pp. 4-
5), and that this evidence should be included in the discussion over the beginning of the Anthropocene. 
 
Consistently with a study by Krachler et al. (2009), Wagreich and Draganits (2018) use a lowering 
of the 206Pb/207Pb ratio228 at 3 ka and 2 ka connected to increased lead concentrations from mining and ore 
smelting as chemical primary marker for a possible GSSP. This marker “can be found in several types of 
terrestrial and marine geological archives, such as ice cores, peat bogs, speleothems, fluvial, lake and marine 
records” (p. 180), although these archives are largely restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, 
they implement evidence from tephrochronology (a geochronological method based on the chronological 
reconstruction of the layering of volcanic ash from eruption) as well as paleoclimatology, 
magnetostratigraphy, and sedimentology as secondary markers for the Anthropocene. The authors argue 
that their proposal entails several advantages, such as allowing a larger pool of stratigraphic and 
archaeological evidence as well as conformance to the standard GSSP methodology. 
 
The AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 7.3.5) has considered the proposal as a valid practical 
candidate, in that it would include significant and time-comprehensive evidence for a Holocene–
Anthropocene boundary. However, they also consider the proposal problematic in respect to the Holocene 
subdivision, which has already been subdivided into the Greenlandian (11.7 ka), Northgrippian (8.15 ka), 
and Meghalayan (4.2 ka). Additionally, they consider early ore mining and smelting not representative of 
substantial Earth System changes. This is an interesting remark, stressing once again the close partnership 
between Earth System science and stratigraphic research. 
 
3.2.2.5 Anthropogenic Soils (∼2 ka) 
 
Soil scientists Giacomo Certini and Riccardo Scalenghe (2011) consider the anthropogenic alteration of the 
pedosphere as a possible marker for the Anthropocene, and locate a possible GSSP at around 2 ka (i.e., 
year 0 CE), “when the natural state of much of the terrestrial surface of the planet was altered appreciably 
by organized civilizations” (p. 1273). The authors contest the original proposal of locating the beginning of 
 
227 Normalization of chemical data is an important procedure in archaeological studies. Essentially, it compares 
concentrations of an element against a second proxy or surrogate element to verify, among other things, “whether the 
variation of elements in sediments is indeed the result of anthropogenic and/or natural activities”(Dias & Prudêncio, 
2008, p. 136). Scandium has been chosen as proxy element by Krachler et al. because it behaves “conservatively during 
chemical weathering and has no preference for specific mineral phases” (Krachler et al., 2009, p. 2), meaning it is 
relatively constant over time.  
228 The lead isotope ratio provides a method to identify the source of lead contamination known as ‘fingerprinting.’ 
For a technical explanation of the method, see Cheng and Hu (2010). 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
231 
 
the Anthropocene with the Industrial Revolution by using atmospheric composition as a primary marker.229 
Instead, they suggest that soils can be used as ‘golden spikes’ in a similar fashion as they are used in 
geological research because of the “clear memories of past, substantial, widespread, anthropic 
interventions” (p. 1271). 
 
The pedosphere encompasses the totality of ice-free soils on the outermost layer of the Earth. 
Many types of natural processes and soil formation processes contribute to the formation of numerous 
types of natural soils. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has provided a World Reference 
Base of Soil Resources (WRB) serving as an international reference point for the classification and naming 
of soils (FAO, 2015). Among the recognized types of soils, the WRB describes ‘Anthrosols’ as soils “that 
have been modified profoundly through human activities (p. 147), and ‘Technosols’ as soils “whose 
properties and pedogenesis are dominated by their technical origin” and contain “a significant amount of 
artefacts” (p. 177). Certini and Scalenghe (2011) implement this framework to consider ‘anthrosolization’ as 
an integral part of soil formation processes, which they argue has considerable geological significance. 
 
The AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 7.3.6) has provided four arguments against a soil-based 
Anthropocene, namely (1) the diachronous unfolding of anthropogenic soils, predating the proposed 
starting date by 8,000 years, which does not match the GSSP requirements; (2) the regional dependency of 
stratigraphic archives associated with soils; (3) the lack of a high-resolution stratigraphy of soils as required 
for a potential Anthropocene GSSP because of the substrate alterations entailed in the formation of soils; 
(4) and the chaotic and thus unreliable nature of ploughed soils. Criticism against a soil-based GSSP has 
also been raised by Gale and Hoare (2012), who also note how Certini and Scalenghe’s (2011) proposal 
does not match many of the criteria needed to define the base of a new stratigraphic unit. 
 
3.2.3 Modern Anthropocene Hypotheses 
 
A third cluster of Anthropocene hypotheses locate the beginning of the proposed unit within modern 
history. As a European historiographic category, the category of ‘modern’ history comprises human history 
from the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire (1453 CE) or the arrival of Columbus in the Americas (1492 
CE) to the present day (i.e., the late modern age), where it overlaps with contemporary history (1945 CE). 
 
The meaning of ‘modern’ has been much contested in the humanities, particularly within historical 
scholarship. In the context of Anthropocene Studies, to use a primarily Eurocentric historiographic 
framework to address a global event/geological boundary such as the Anthropocene seems to read it as an 
intrinsically European phenomenon. In fact, this is the same type of criticism that has been levied against 
a pool of starting dates locating the beginning of the epoch with the Industrial Revolution. Nevertheless, 
this framework maintains the term ‘modern’ for three main reasons – all of which answer to pragmatic 
 
229 When the article was published in 2011, the Industrial Revolution was still considered by the recently formed AWG 
to be a valuable candidate for marking the beginning of the Anthropocene. 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
232 
 
needs. First, the term simply represents a practical solution, consistent with the historiographical tradition, 
for representing the ‘Anthropocene’ in a time scale. It avoids clustering substantially different hypotheses 
within the Holocene range by using human history as a reference framework. Second, and as a direct 
consequence, it helps differentiate from other clusters of hypotheses, particularly the early Anthropocene 
hypotheses, which are situated within the Holocene but pre-date modern hypotheses on a scale of 
thousands of years. In purely chronological terms, modern hypotheses only differ on scales of hundreds of 
years, if not decades. Third, the term ‘modern’ has a descriptive rather than normative meaning. It is simply 
implemented as a category to differentiate among hypotheses based on the property of time. It does not 
imply any value statement or considerations beyond the organization of proposed hypotheses based on 
time. 
 
Therefore, this section surveys five proposed starting dates for the Anthropocene: namely, the year 
1500 CE, the colonization of the Americas, the Industrial Revolution – a time frame encompassing a pool 
of proposed starting dates mostly superseded in stratigraphic research – the Tambora volcanic eruption, 
and geomagnetic evidence by the dawn of the 20th century. 
 
3.2.3.1 Social Metabolism Hypothesis (1500 CE) 
 
Fischer-Kowalski et al. (2014) consider the year 1500 CE as a watershed between agrarian and fossil fuel–
based metabolic regimes, and thus as a starting point for the ‘Anthropocene,’ based on a socio-economic 
analysis using the concept of ‘social metabolism’ of human societies across time. The concept of 
‘socioeconomic metabolism’ (SEM) represents a pool of diversified methods implemented mostly in 
ecologically oriented social and economic sciences to understand the biophysical basis and functioning of 
human societies. In a recent publication, sustainability scholars Stefan Pauliuk and Edgar Hertwich (2015) 
define SEM as “the self-reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society” 
comprising “those biophysical transformation processes, distribution processes, and flows, which are 
controlled by humans for their purposes” (p. 85). Together, the biophysical characteristics of human society 
societies and the socioeconomic metabolism “form the biophysical basis of society” (ibid.). Early research 
on the biophysical basis of human societies and its metabolism dates to the late 1990s.230 
 
Fischer-Kowalski et al. (2014) use this framework to “focus on the socioeconomic aspects of 
defining the Anthropocene and investigate the interaction of the major drivers behind the observed 
environmental impacts, in particular population, its resource use patterns (or social metabolism) and 
technology” (p. 9). Their study draws on Paul Ehrlich’s popular IPAT formula (I for environmental impact, 
P for human population, A for affluence or wealth, and T for technology) to provide a “quantifiable 
description of how and when humans acquire the ability to dominate major features of the Earth System” 
(ibid.). Ehrlich’s original formula is readjusted to account for socio-metabolic regimes rather than a 
 
230 See Pauliuk and Hertwich (2015, para. 1.4, 2.1) for bibliographic references on seminal research on SEM. 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
233 
 
homogeneous population (P), whereas affluence (A) is considered the average per capita energy input into 
the respective socio-metabolic regime. Technology (T) is interpreted as “the coefficient by which one unit 
of affluence measured as material or energy use translates into a specific environmental pressure” (p. 10). 
This way, the formula is rewritten as 
 
𝐼= 𝑃1𝑡∗𝐴1𝑡∗𝑇1𝑡+ 𝑃2𝑡∗𝐴2𝑡∗𝑇2𝑡+ ⋯, 
 
where the subscript t represents a specific time and the numerical index (1, 2, etc.) a determined socio-
metabolic regime. The equation is then used by the authors to quantitatively assess the environmental 
impact, or pressure upon the environment (I), of the fossil fuel–based socio-metabolic regime (or industrial 
mode of subsistence), whose beginning is set at 1500 CE. This regime saw an increase in metabolic rates 
compared to the previous hunter–gatherer and agricultural socio-metabolic regimes, also associated with 
an overall increase in urban populations. Based on their model, the authors conclude that the year 1500 
constitutes a major historical divide as well as a starting point for a new socio-metabolic regime of global-
scale impact. 
 
Visibly, this alternative hypothesis does not address the stratigraphic signature of the 
Anthropocene as a geological unit. Instead, Fischer-Kowalski et al. (2014) aim at providing a quantifiable 
description of when and how humans acquired a dominant role in the functioning of the Earth System. In 
doing so, they locate an abrupt shift in social metabolism occurred at 1500 CE. While the hypothesis does 
not compete with the Anthropocene Hypothesis, it still considers a different beginning to the 
‘Anthropocene’ as a global phenomenon. 
 
3.2.3.2 Orbis Hypothesis (1610 CE) 
 
A widely discussed hypothesis has been advanced by Lewis and Maslin (2015a) in an article published by 
Nature in 2015, later revised and expanded in a chapter of their 2018 book The Human Planet (Lewis & 
Maslin, 2018a). The scientists consider two possible starting dates for the Anthropocene: one in 1610 and 
one in 1964 (the latter discussed in section 3.2.4.3).  
The year 1610 coincides with a 7–10 ppmv dip in atmospheric CO2 concentrations recorded in ice 
cores from Law Dome in Antarctica (Rubino et al., 2013) and from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) 
Divide (Ahn et al., 2012), both documented around 1600 CE and used by Lewis and Maslin (2015a) as 
ground evidence for their hypothesis. From a historical viewpoint, the year follows more than a century 
since the European arrival in the Americas, which “led to the largest human population replacement in the 
past 13,000 years, the first global trade networks linking Europe, China, Africa and the Americas, and the 
resultant mixing of previously separate biotas, known as the Colombian Exchange” (Lewis & Maslin, 
2015a). The authors label this 1610 dip as the ‘Orbis spike,’ and suggest their proposal be addressed as the 
‘Orbis hypothesis’ (ibid.). 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
234 
 
 
The studies on the Antarctic ice core records do not specify the causes of the sudden atmospheric 
CO2 dip. Rubino et al. (2013) advocate for further research to explain the sudden carbon uptake, whereas 
Ahn et al. (2012) consider it “unclear if the variation is really a signal of atmospheric CO2 change or 
experimental uncertainty and/or local variation of ice core quality” (p. 4). An earlier study from MacFarling 
et al. (2006, also quoted in Lewis & Maslin, 2015a) notes as well that “it is unclear whether the initial CO2 
decrease was driven by the terrestrial biosphere, and some changes to oceanic carbon exchange are 
possible” (p. 3). Lewis and Maslin (2015a) provide an explanation for the 1610 (± 15 years) dip in CO2 
associated with the hundred-year consequences of the European colonization of the Americas. The precise 
year is selected based on the lowest CO2 ppmv concentrations recorded in Law Dome records for the 
declining trend (MacFarling Meure et al., 2006, see Supporting Information, Table S1).  
 
The argument advanced by the two scientists from the University College London suggests that 
the European colonization of the Americas led to a significant decline in human populations, especially 
among peoples of the New World. They estimate the number of inhabitants of the continents ranged 
between 56 to 61 million by 1492, reduced to a minimum of 6 million by 1650 due to diseases, enslavement, 
famine, and war as a result of the European colonial enterprise. This dramatic reduction in local populations 
resulted in reduced agricultural practices and fire management, consequently allowing natural revegetation 
of around 50 million hectares of biomes and ecosystems. In turn, revegetation increased the terrestrial 
carbon uptake, which is reflected in the atmospheric CO2 decline recorded in the Antarctic ice core records. 
This primary marker for a possible GSSP finds additional secondary stratigraphic evidence in the global 
translocation of species (represented by the global extension of Zea mays fossil records), volcanic tephra, 
pollen, charcoal reduction, methane decrease, and additional climatic evidence. 
 
Lewis and Maslin (2015a, 2015b) argue that systemic changes in the Earth System represented in 
stratigraphic deposits and environmental changes are not suitably defined by early Anthropocene 
hypotheses, such as the Pleistocene megafauna extinction or the Ruddiman Hypothesis, nor by proposals 
locating the beginning of the epoch with the Industrial Revolution. An additional argument provided is that 
these events are not reflected in a global and synchronous fashion – a requirement for any GSSP proposal, 
and an argument often invoked by the AWG when reviewing competing hypotheses. On the contrary, the 
irreversible exchange of species that followed the colonization of the Americas is global and geologically 
synchronous, and its consequences “will be one of the few clearly visible changes to Earth over the typical 
timescale of an epoch of millions of years that can be recorded today” (Lewis & Maslin, 2015b, p. 139). 
Furthermore, the authors argue that the year 1610 is not just geologically significant, but has important 
historical and social meaning because it highlights the colonial roots of the Anthropocene as well as the 
impact of global trade, economic growth, and coal.  
 
As with the Ruddiman Hypothesis, the Orbis hypothesis has also been largely discussed, especially 
by AWG members. Zalasiewicz et al. (2015a) provide a list of critical points against the Orbis hypothesis, 
arguing that the 1610 dip (1) does not stand out as an anomaly, (2) falls within natural variation of the 
Holocene, (3) is not entirely consistent with human population decrease in the Americas, (4) does not

235 
 
account for global trends in human population decrease in respect to carbon uptake, (5) may be consistent 
with natural variations within the Little Ice Age,231 and (6) still requires further biostratigraphic research. 
Concerning the broader social and political value of selecting the Orbis spike as a GSSP, Zalasiewicz et al. 
(2015a) suggest that “that the positioning of a stratigraphic boundary should simply be pragmatically and 
dispassionately chosen” (p. 123). The pragmatic nature of stratigraphic and geological research is an 
important epistemological as well as historical ingredient for explanations in geology – as tackled again in 
section 4.2. 
 
3.2.3.3 Industrial Revolution (1780–1850 CE) 
 
The onset of the Industrial Revolution in England by the end of the 18th century – and its gradual spread 
across Europe, the United States, the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, and the rest of the world – was the 
first time period proposed to mark the beginning of the ‘Anthropocene,’ whether as a geological time unit 
or as an Earth System singularity. Because of the revolutionary transformations hatched from this period 
in terms of energy consumption, modes of production, population growth, and especially environmental 
transformation, the Industrial Revolution has been generally accepted as the birthplace of the 
‘Anthropocene’ by most early research literature. Most of the present ‘Anthropocene’ research in Earth 
System science and stratigraphy has now redirected its attention toward the 20th century, shifting the focus 
onto the Great Acceleration and/or the Atomic Age. However, the Industrial Revolution is still an 
important historical phase for Anthropocene Studies. Thus, is it relevant to the present analysis to highlight 
the major hypotheses related to the Industrial Revolution because of the way they have informed and 
shaped the ‘Anthropocene’ debates as well as the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
Rather than a single hypothesis, a pool of starting dates with diverse authorship have addressed the 
Industrial Revolution as the reasonable cradle of the Anthropocene. These proposals either pinpoint a 
precise year or a time period, or consider stages or phases of a longer and diachronous unfolding of the 
Anthropocene. This subsection briefly reviews a few of these proposals in light of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. 
 
As recollected in Chapter 2, Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer’s 2000 IGBP article represents the 
notorious cradle of the ‘Anthropocene.’ They first proposed locating the beginning of the Anthropocene 
at the end of the 18th century – conscious that alternative proposals could be made. In their view, this period 
reflected the time when “human activities [had] become clearly noticeable” (Crutzen & Stoermer, 2000, p. 
17), particularly in terms of emissions of greenhouse gasses such as CO2 and CH4. The authors suggest a 
date, namely 1784, coinciding with James Watt’s invention of the steam engine – implicitly stressing its 
importance for the dawn of the Anthropocene. The date was reproposed by successive publications by 
 
231 The Little Ice Age was a cooling period defined in terms of climate (1570–1900 CE) and glacierization (1300–1950) 
that followed a warmer trend (Matthews & Briffa, 2005). Scholars debate on the actual temporal extent of this colder 
period (see Kleeman, 2020). The Orbis spike locates within this cooler trend. 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
236 
 
Crutzen (2002a, 2002d; Crutzen & Steffen, 2003), but it was never given any formal stratigraphic attention 
prior to the establishment of the AWG (despite Crutzen’s recommendation of using the term 
‘anthropocene’ to address the current geological epoch).232  
 
A later appeal to locate the beginning of the geological Anthropocene at the end of the 18th century 
has been proposed by Foley et al. (2013), who also coined the term ‘paleoanthropocene’ for early and 
minimal anthropogenic environmental changes. They propose maintaining the Industrial Revolution as 
starting date for the Anthropocene, specifically around 1780 – a year marking “the beginning of immense 
rises in human population and carbon emissions as well as atmospheric CO2 levels” (p. 83). Interestingly, 
the authors consider the year 1780 as the onset of the Great Acceleration, despite this designation being 
used today to address the post-WWII surge in socioeconomic and Earth System trends. 
 
The Earth System science community, and especially the IGBP, widely adopted the Industrial 
Revolution as the starting date for the Anthropocene. The IGBP seminal report Global Change and the Earth 
System: A Planet Under Pressure (Steffen et al., 2004b, 2004c), discussed in section 2.1.3.3, considers the 
Industrial Revolution as a watershed between the pre-industrial localized and negligible anthropogenic 
influence on the Earth System, and the post-industrial “societal capacity to extract, consume, and produce” 
(Steffen et al., 2004b, p. 81) on a scale capable of affecting Earth System functioning. Hence, Steffen et al. 
(2007) consider the time frame 1800/1850 as the beginning of the Anthropocene’s ‘Stage 1,’ namely, the 
first of three stages followed by the Great Acceleration (Stage 2, 1945–present) and by future trajectories 
of the Earth System determined by human responses to this state of affairs (Stage 3, present–?). To assign 
a more precise date, Steffen et al. (2011a) argue that the year 1800 “could reasonably be chosen as the 
beginning of the Anthropocene” because “in 1750, the Industrial Revolution had barely begun but by 1850 
it had almost completely transformed England and had spread to many other countries in Europe and 
across the Atlantic to North America” (p. 849). Standing in between, the year 1800 provided a practical 
signpost to date the beginning of the new epoch.233 
 
Lastly, Williams et al. (2019) consider the development of underground metro systems to “provide 
an important signal of sedimentary deposits that may be associated with a potential Anthropocene Epoch 
of geological time” (p. 451). The first metro system opened in London on January 10, 1863, developing 
thereafter on each continent (except Antarctica) over the next 150 years. The authors associate geological, 
stratigraphical, and biological significance with metro systems as ‘trace fossils,’ namely records of biological 
activity. No date is explicitly considered as starting point for the Anthropocene. However, by considering

232 As pointed out at the beginning of section 3.1 and in section 2.2.1, the ‘geological’ claim in Crutzen and Stoermer 
(2000) is best understood within an Earth System science framework rather than a geological proposal. 
233 In a recent publication, Syvitski et al. (2020) suggest that “[h]umans became a geological force over the last 300 y, 
particularly after the start of the global industrial revolution in 1850 CE when excess energy (fossil fuel) became widely 
available” (p. 8, emphases added). The authors do not explicitly consider the date as the beginning of the 
Anthropocene (in fact, they argue for a starting date to be placed at 1950 CE), but rather a point marking the geological 
scale of human actions – which, as addressed in section 3.1, is a different claim from the stratigraphic one. Additionally, 
the authors stress the importance of the Industrial Revolution as a global phenomenon, rather than focusing on the 
later Anglocentric 18th- and 19th-century industrialization. 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
237 
 
and ontology of metro systems as a distinctive mark of the Anthropocene, the authors are locating its 
beginning within the late Industrial Revolution. 
The Industrial Revolution is still rightfully represented in Anthropocene literature as part of the 
historical roots of the epoch, laying out the conditions of possibility for the societal, technological, and 
economic developments for later stages of human history. Nevertheless, the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 
2019b, para. 7.4.3) has considered the beginning of discernible human impact to hold greater significance 
than the beginning of the underlying process. Considering that the “Industrial Revolution’s impact on the 
global cycle remained negligible for several decades after the deployment of steam engines” (p. 253), then 
its diachronous and regional nature has been rejected by most of the AWG as a valid stratigraphic marker 
for the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
3.2.3.4 Tambora Volcanic Eruption (1815 CE) 
 
A study by archaeologist Victoria C. Smith (2014) suggests that the 1815 eruption of the Tambora 
stratovolcano on Sumbawa Island, Indonesia, may be used as a starting date for the Anthropocene. The 
same event had already been briefly considered as a possible stratigraphic marker by Zalasiewicz et al. 
(2008b) one year prior to the formation of the AWG and the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This 
proposal is situated within the Industrial Revolution, but it stands out from other related starting dates by 
considering a natural event as a possible base for the Anthropocene. 
 
The Tambora eruption is one of the largest volcanic eruptions recorded in the past two thousand 
years. The relative explosiveness of a volcanic eruption is measured through the Volcanic Explosivity Index 
(VEI). The scale was created in 1982 by volcanologists Christopher G. Newhall and Stephen Self, who 
recognized the lack of a quantitative scale for measuring historical volcanic eruptions (Newhall & Self, 
1982). It represents a composite semiquantitative scale assigning a value from 0 (lowest explosivity) to 8 
(highest explosivity) based on different factors, such as type of eruption (e.g., strombolian or plinian), 
duration, dense rock equivalent (DRE, an estimate of erupted volume), or eruption column height (i.e., 
troposphere or stratosphere injection). Most of the documented eruptions have a VEI value of < 3, 
meaning that higher VEI eruptions are rarer.  
 
The 1815 Tambora eruption has been assigned a VEI of 7, and it is often considered the cause of 
the sudden decrease in global mean temperature and climate anomalies of 1816 – the ‘year without a 
summer.’ The eruption released approximately 53–58 Tg of SO2 (sulfur dioxide) which generated 93–118 
Tg of sulfate aerosols (Smith, 2014, quoting Self & al., 2004), and its ashes were reported as far as 1800 km 
away from the eruption site. Electrical conductivity measurements (ECM, a reflection of ice acidity) and 
sulfate peaks record the event in ice cores both in Antarctica and Greenland (as well as other sites in Bolivia 
and the U.S.), making the event virtually synchronous and global in stratigraphic terms. Considering that 
tephra layers offer both a relative and absolute chronology, and that accompanying archives of various 
scientific as well as historical natures provide additional stratigraphic evidence, Smith concludes that “[t]he 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
238 
 
1815 Tambora eruption is an ideal marker for defining the onset of the Anthropocene as it occurs just 
before major anthropogenic changes observed in key climate records” (p. 294). 
 
The Tambora eruption provides a seemingly isochronous and global signal with a possible GSSP 
marker for locating the beginning of the Anthropocene. Indeed, Lowe and Bostock (2015) have argued that 
“the Tambora eruption deserves serious consideration as the GSSP for the start of the Anthropocene 
because it generated a demonstrably globally synchronous signal that ties in with associated evidence of 
increasing human impact, namely the atmospheric greenhouse gas rise from the early 1800s” (p. 117). Whilst 
selecting a natural signal over an anthropogenic signals seems to undermine the basic idea behind the 
‘Anthropocene,’ the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 1.3) has noted that “an effective Anthropocene 
boundary […] need not be based on a human-made signal” (p. 16). Nevertheless, the 1815 Tambora event 
is recognized as too small (though not negligible) an event to be used for a GSSP, and difficult to correlate 
globally in stratigraphic record. 
 
3.2.3.5 AD 1900 event 
 
A paleomagnetic study from Snowball, Hounslow, and Nilsson (2014) considers anthropogenic traces in 
mineral magnetic records from fossil fuel burning and deforestation as a possible late base for the 
Anthropocene. They select the date of 1900 CE, reflecting “major fossil fuel burning in Europe and eastern 
North America, probably related to coal burning” (p. 132) and shifts in soil properties associated with 
deforestation.  
 
By the time the article was written and published, the Industrial Revolution was still considered the 
best candidate for locating the beginning of the Anthropocene. The evidence they provide has been 
assimilated by the AWG as paleomagnetic and magnetostratigraphic evidence for the Anthropocene, but it 
has only been considered as an auxiliary marker for determining the stratigraphic signature of the 
Anthropocene. Despite the Industrial Revolution having ultimately been rejected by the AWG as a possible 
time period to locate the beginning of the Anthropocene, the AD 1900 event hypothesis stands out as an 
autonomous, magnetic-based argument for locating the beginning of the Anthropocene. This makes it 
worth mentioning, although briefly, along the spectrum of scientific alternatives to the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. 
 
3.2.4 Contemporary Anthropocene Hypotheses 
 
Modern Anthropocene hypotheses have been defined as those hypotheses situated within the 
historiographic category of ‘modern history.’ Another cluster of hypotheses sharing even closer proximity 
to the present is situated after 1945 CE. This year is another important historiographic signpost. It marks 
the end of WWII as well as the beginning of the Atomic Age and the Great Acceleration. The development 

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
239 
 
of nuclear technology, and the testing of nuclear and thermonuclear devices amidst the international 
tensions defining the Cold War, hold particular importance in Anthropocene Hypotheses debates. This is 
not solely because the Anthropocene Hypothesis itself locates the optimal beginning of the proposed epoch 
within this time period. Abundant scientific literature has documented the scale and magnitude of human 
forcings on the planet during the second half of the 20th century. This footprint brings unprecedented 
evidence to the stratigraphic discussions over the Anthropocene as a geological unit, and over its broader 
significance. 
As mentioned, the post-WWII era has been assigned different labels, from the Great Acceleration 
and the Atomic Age to the late modern age and contemporary history. Selecting one label over another 
mostly depends on the specific features of time period being discussed – from historical events through 
political tensions to energy transitions. Consistent with the historiographical choice adopted for modern 
Anthropocene hypotheses, the following hypotheses are addressed as ‘contemporary Anthropocene 
hypotheses.’ This decision follows the same three principles of practicality, differentiation, and time-range 
similarity that justified the grouping of modern hypotheses. 
 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis locates the beginning of the proposed stratigraphic and 
chronostratigraphic unit at ∼1950. As such, it falls within this cluster of Anthropocene hypotheses. All of 
the hypotheses surveyed in this section share with the Anthropocene Hypothesis the basic belief that atomic 
bomb testing left a substantial stratigraphic (particularly chemostratigraphic) marker in sedimentary records 
that could be interpreted as a global and synchronous marker for the unit. However, this pool of hypotheses 
varies in terms of identifying the precise year that would serve as a geochronological threshold. Such a 
discussion may look trivial: what difference would it make, geologically speaking, whether the 
Anthropocene were to begin in the year 1945, during the 1950s, or in 1964? The meaningful differences 
among these proposals do not lie in the time frame or date selected, but rather in the methodologies chosen 
to select these dates. Therefore, to select one date or the other means establishing a preferred methodology 
to define the Anthropocene, and ensuring the selected methodology is given stratigraphic recognition. 
 
3.2.4.1 Trinity Test Hypothesis (1945 CE) 
 
Among the possible starting dates initially considered, the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2015b) had proposed 
to date the beginning of the Anthropocene with the use of the world’s first nuclear device. The Gadget was 
detonated at 05:29:21 a.m. (±2 seconds) Mountain War Time (-6 hours GMT) on July 16, 1945, at the 
White Sands Proving Ground (now White Sands Missile Range) in the Jornada Del Muerto Desert, New 
Mexico. The date represents the beginning of the Atomic Age, which in stratigraphic terms is defined by a 
seemingly global and synchronous radiogenic signal associated with the scattering of anthropogenic 
radionuclides by nuclear fallout, especially 137Cs (caesium-137), which is formed by nuclear fission of 235U 
(uranium-235). While radiogenic signals are more prominent in the two subsequent decades, the authors 
considered the date to represent a “clear, objective moment in time” (p. 200). 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
240 
 
Originally, the authors believed that a GSSP would not offer a “significant practical advantage over 
a GSSA” (p. 200) in defining a boundary. In fact, they considered a Global Standard Stratigraphic Age or 
GSSA “to be simpler and more direct than one based on a GSSP” (p. 201) because the historical 
observational record and stratigraphic evidence can be associated with a numerical (i.e., calendar) age with 
higher precision than a GSSP. As explained in section 3.1.2.6, a GSSA is a conventional numerical date 
used when stratigraphic evidence, and in particular the fossil record, is either absent, too scarce, or too 
difficult to correlate globally. This situation applies to most of the Precambrian (> 541 Ma), and thus 
virtually to most of the Earth’s history, when life was scarce and less complex. However, according to the 
AWG (Waters et al., 2014a; Zalasiewicz et al., 2011a), the Holocene was defined by a numerical age 
stipulated at 10 ka (although not officially recognized as a GSSA) before it was assigned a GSSP in May 
2008 based on ice cores from the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) reflecting signals in climatic 
warming (Walker et al., 2009).  
Already in 2011, Zalasiewicz et al. (2011a) had used the case of the formerly GSSA-defined 
Pleistocene–Holocene boundary to advance the possibility of defining a Holocene–Anthropocene 
boundary with a numerical age. Then, the authors had assigned its beginning at 1800 CE. This possibility 
was further considered by Waters et al. (2014b) in the Geological Society of London’s special publication 
A Stratigraphical Basis for the Anthropocene (Waters et al., 2014a). The authors argued that “[w]ith the definition 
of the base of the Anthropocene possibly at a time of tens to hundreds of years before present, the 
resolution of dating techniques is at least decadal if not annual, and definition of a GSSA at a specific year 
is feasible and arguably preferable to using a proxy indicator” (p. 7). Rather than assigning a numerical date 
at 1800 CE, Waters et al. (2014b) began considering different types of evidence exhibiting substantial 
stratigraphic signatures post-dating 1945, hence “leading to the suggestion that this date may be a suitable 
age for the commencement of the Anthropocene should it prove useful and necessary to define it” (p. 17). 
 
The proposal to define the Anthropocene based on its numerical beginning (at 1945 CE) rather 
than its stratigraphic base was contested by Stanley Finney, then Chair of the ICS, and Lucy E. Edwards, 
NACSN commissioner (Finney & Edwards, 2016). The authors, who advocate against the formalization of 
the Anthropocene, argue that “focusing on the definition of the beginning of the Anthropocene can result 
in the lack of consideration of its stratigraphic content and its concept” because “[i]t conveys the opinion 
that units of the geologic time scale are defined solely by their beginnings, rather than their content” (p. 7). 
That means that physical evidence of global and synchronous correlatability should determine a Holocene–
Anthropocene boundary, rather than a numerical date. Additionally, Finney and Edwards (2016) reported 
that a GSSA at 10 ka was never formalized by the ICS nor the IUGS for the Pleistocene–Holocene 
boundary, and hence cannot be used as an example of using a GSSA in recent times. According to Walker 
et al. (2015, also quoted in Finney & Edwards, 2016), the date was selected during the Holocene 
Commission meeting at the eighth International Union for Quaternary Research Congress held in Paris in 
1969, with participants agreeing that the Pleistocene–Holocene boundary should be placed 
chronometrically at 10 ka. But no GSSA was formalized at that time, nor afterward.  

THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE 
241 
 
 
The original proposal by Zalasiewicz et al. (2015b) to use the GSSA method to date the beginning 
of the Anthropocene at July 16, 1945 CE has been superseded by the current AWG research direction, 
whose members voted in favor of using a GSSP methodology to locate a possible lower boundary around 
the mid-20th century.234 The Anthropocene researchers realized that “[t]he 1945 detonation of the Trinity 
device would make a well-defined, historically important reference point, but a single detonation lacks a 
clear signature in the global geological record” (Waters et al., 2015, p. 49), which is necessary to consider 
the Anthropocene as a geological time unit. Nevertheless, the Trinity Test Hypothesis played an important 
role in the broader conceptual development of the Anthropocene Hypothesis because it transitioned the 
stratigraphic focus from the Industrial Revolution to the Atomic Age, which is currently the main area of 
focus for the AWG. 
 
3.2.4.2 Nuclear/Thermonuclear Bomb Testing (1950–1963 CE) 
 
Radionuclide signals associated with atomic bomb testing are currently the most promising marker for the 
Anthropocene and are advocated by the majority of AWG members. This time period, covering the 1950s 
and 1960s, also coincides with the onset of the Great Acceleration, thus providing a meeting point between 
stratigraphy and Earth System science. Several individual starting dates within this time frame have been 
advanced in research literature. These proposals do not necessarily compete with one another in the way 
other proposals do (e.g., Ruddiman Hypothesis, Orbis Spike Hypothesis), because they constitute possible 
‘options’ within the Anthropocene Hypothesis as currently formulated by the AWG (they also differ from 
the Trinity Test Hypothesis, in that the latter implemented a different methodological framework 
superseded by extant research). However, if a single date is required in the process of formalizing the 
Anthropocene, then only one can ultimately be chosen as an ideal starting date based on convincing 
stratigraphic evidence. A few of these proposals are reviewed in this section. 
 
The year 1950 has been a common date in Earth System science and geological literature (Waters 
et al., 2016) because it determines the onset of the Great Acceleration. While stating that defining a 
beginning is relative to the discipline undertaking the effort, geologist Jaia Syvitski and hydrologist Albert 
Kettner (2011) associate the beginning of the proposed epoch at 1950 with surface-temperature records 
based on evidence presented in the IPCC Climate Change 2007 synthesis report (IPCC, 2007).235 However, 
their study does not directly engage with the issue of determining the beginning of the Anthropocene.  
 
A more recent study by Syvitski et al. (2020) also proposed 1950 as the beginning of the 
Anthropocene. The study analyzes the geological impact of human energy consumption across Holocene

235 It should be mentioned that neither the synthesis nor the full report nor the summary for policymakers mentions 
the ‘Anthropocene.’ However, the report emphasizes the consequences of anthropogenic climate change (e.g., sea 
level rise, average temperatures, etc.) especially during the second half of the 20th century, hence logically creating a 
‘threshold year’ at 1950 CE. 

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

human history, showing that a number of factors characterize the post-1950 interval as a substantially 
different geological and historical epoch: the burning of fossil fuels in the past 70 years led to a 0.9°C 
increase in atmospheric temperature; the increase of atmospheric CO2 to above 400 ppmv in 2015 – a level 
unprecedented in the past 3 million years (Lindsey, 2020) – and the consequential cryosphere loss, sea-level 
rise, and ocean acidification; rapid growth of the human population, with an average growth rate of 1.63%/y 
(compared to 0.8%/y during the 1850–1950 CE interval) and 71 million new individuals per year; per capita 
energy consumption reaching ~61 GJ/y (range 40 to 75 GJ/y), against industrial levels of ~27.2 GJ/y 
(range 22 to 40 GJ/y) and pre-industrial (1670–1850 CE) average of 18.4 GJ/y (range 13.5 to 22 GJ/y). 
Furthermore, the authors provide a list of sixteen additional examples236 in support of the “Anthropocene 
Epoch thesis” (Syvitski et al., 2020, p. 5), discussing some of the trends of the Great Acceleration and 
highlighting further aspects not represented in the canonical twenty-four graphs. Lastly, they suggest that 
the evidence they provide “strongly underpin the trajectory of the Earth System away from a Holocene 
state of the system, substantially and globally, around the mid-20th century, circa 1950 CE” (p. 9). 
In a stratigraphic context, Zalasiewicz et al. (2014c) consider 1950 as a practical starting date for 
the Anthropocene, regardless of the means used to define it (GSSP or GSSA). The authors consider the 
Anthropocene not to “represent the detectable incoming of human influence […] but major change to the 
Earth system that happens to be currently driven by human forcing, and which may geologically soon be 
more significantly controlled by a number of secondary positive feedbacks, such as methane release from 
permafrost and ice-albedo changes” (p. 40). As a turning point in Earth System functioning, the year 1950 
is selected in combination with worldwide signals, from radionuclide fallout to sedimentation and changes 
to biota, that “are traceable by scientists living today, and not just by hypothetical ‘far-future’ geologists” 
(ibid.). Radiogenic signatures and radionuclides from nuclear and thermonuclear weapon testing fallout is 
considered by Waters et al. (2016) as “[p]otentially the most widespread and globally synchronous 
anthropogenic signal” (p. aad2622-5), and is in fact central evidence supporting the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. Waters et al. (2016) consider the mid-20th century as the most consistent time frame for the 
evidence provided in their analysis, essentially representing the AWG’s current position on the beginning 
of the Anthropocene. 
The year 1952 has been considered by Waters et al. (2015) as a possible candidate to locate the 
beginning of the Anthropocene. The date has been used by Davies (2018) in his monograph, The Birth of 
the Anthropocene, suggesting also that a GSSA could perhaps be used to date the beginning of the 
Anthropocene with the detonation of Ivy Mike, the first thermonuclear device, on November 1, 1952, 
07:14:59.4 (±0.2s) a.m. local time. Waters et al. (2015) associate the date with extensive thermonuclear 
testing that had begun by 1952, which “deposited large amounts of radionuclides in the environment and 
left a well-defined radiogenic signature” (p. 49). Whilst this signal is most evident in later years, it is a

industrial agriculture, release of POPs, coastal engineering, plastic production, creation of human mineral-like 
compounds, concrete production, water evaporation from warming, overfishing, total livestock biomass,

common practice in stratigraphy to place stratigraphic boundaries at the beginning of a determined 
excursion (e.g., chemical, but also fossil appearance) rather than its peak (Zalasiewicz et al., 2015a). Waters 
et al. (2015) do not explicitly mention a GSSP or a GSSA as a preferred methodology, although the emphasis 
on physical evidence (hence a GSSP-based boundary) over a chronologically established date is implicit. 
 
While only marginally considered, Zalasiewicz, Waters, Williams, et al. (2015b) also presented 1954 
as a possible Anthropocene GSSA, a year marking “the first widespread appearance of artificial radioisotopes 
in the geological record” (p. 201). The radioisotopes are particularly clear in caesium-137 in the Northern 
Hemisphere, appearing prominently in 1954 and peaking in 1963 – the latter year also corresponding to the 
Partial Test Ban Treaty, an international agreement setting strong limits to nuclear testing. 
 
3.2.4.3 Bomb Spike Hypothesis (1964 CE) 
 
Chronologically, the most recent starting date proposed for an Anthropocene time unit has been advanced 
by Lewis and Maslin (2015a, 2015b, 2018a) – also promoters of the Orbis Spike Hypothesis. The authors 
consider the year 1964 another possible beginning of the Anthropocene. The year corresponds to a peak 
in radionuclide fallout, specifically 14C (radiocarbon), recorded in tree rings.  
 
Tree ring (or growth ring) dating, or dendrochronology, is a useful dating technique with a wide 
spectrum of applications, enabling disciplines such as stratigraphy, paleoclimatology, forestry, chemistry, 
archaeology, and climate science to explain and/or correlate types of findings (e.g., age of a sample, traces 
of a chemical element, climatic conditions at a given time, age of wooden artifacts, etc.). Essentially, trees 
receive and react to environmental changes in their surroundings, and because trees are stationary 
organisms, they provide a reliable source of information for reconstructing the climatic or environmental 
history of a determined geographical area. Trees respond almost immediately to environmental changes, 
which are recorded in tree rings forming mostly on a yearly cycle (i.e., one ring per year). 
Lewis and Maslin (2015a) suggest that a GSSP could be placed at Niepołomice, a small village 25 
km east of Krakow, Poland, within tree rings of a pine tree (Pinus sylvestris) recording the radiocarbon peak 
at 1964 CE. This GSSP is based on a study on radiocarbon dating of CO2 emissions for environmental 
monitoring by Rakowski et al. (2013) that attempts to calculate CO2 emissions from combustion of fossil 
fuels. The authors use pine tree rings from Niepołomice as evidence for their study, showing a peak of 
894.3 Δ14C ‰ (radiocarbon per-mille) at 1964 CE attributed to nuclear weapon testing (see Rakowski et al., 
2013, Table 1). Among the pool of possible secondary markers, Lewis and Maslin (2015a, 2015b) consider 
plutonium isotope ratios (240Pu/239Pu), caesium-137, and iodine isotopes (129I) found among sediments, 
marine sediments, and soils as possible auxiliary markers for the proposed beginning. The authors believe 
that the year 1964 serves as an optimal starting date and GSSP because it allows “global correlation, can be 
dated to an unambiguously annual resolution, and provides the best correlation potential with other 
radionuclide species” (Lewis & Maslin, 2015b, p. 140).  

ANATOMY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
244 
 
In addition to meeting the criteria for a possible GSSP, the authors also consider the broader 
meaning of selecting this specific date, considering that “[c]hoosing the bomb spike tells a story of an elite-
driven technological development that threatens planet-wide destruction” (Lewis & Maslin, 2015a, p. 177). 
In the Correspondence section of Nature, Zalasiewicz (2015) briefly commented on the Bomb 
Spike Hypothesis, suggesting that the selected date is located beyond the commencement of the Great 
Acceleration. This implies that including this time frame in defining the Anthropocene should be 
paramount. In fact, such a statement is consistent with the close proximity established between stratigraphic 
and Earth System research – the former attempting to include the latter in a stratigraphic definition of the 
Anthropocene. Indeed, Zalasiewicz argues “that year 1964 is later than the near-synchronous upward 
inflections of many physical and socio-economic trends and their respective stratigraphic signals, which 
date to around 1950” (p. 436). The synchronicity requirement finds an additional issue in geographical 
terms. Waters et al. (2016) observe that “the peak is diachronous between hemispheres” (p. aad2622-5), 
suggesting that it cannot be used to locate the beginning of the proposed unit. 
Following internal voting opinions held on the occasion of the 35th International Geological 
Congress in Cape Town, South Africa, on August 29, 2016, 1.3 votes were issued in favor of selecting the 
year ∼1964 CE as a starting date, against 28.3 votes in favor of a ∼1950 boundary (Zalasiewicz et al., 2017a). 
This resulted in the AWG’s present research direction of locating the beginning of the Anthropocene by 
the 1950s. 
 
 
This chapter surveyed the empirical and methodological basis informing the Anthropocene Hypothesis as 
well as the landscape of alternative hypotheses conceptualizing, complementing, or contesting the 
stratigraphic variant of the ‘Anthropocene’ formulated by the AWG. These aspects are paramount in 
delineating an epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
A further aspect of epistemic significance is locating the hypothesis in the context of scientific 
knowledge at large. This aspect is explored in the following chapter, where a complementary analysis of a 
more ‘theoretical’ nature is conducted.

Scientific hypotheses say something about the world. The way scientists formulate and test hypotheses 
makes them different from mere conjectures, lucky guesses, personal beliefs, or popular opinions, in 
achieving (or failing to achieve) a kind of expected cognitive success (Steup & Neta, 2020). Different areas 
dedicated to the study of science and scientific knowledge confirm this – from studies on the social, 
historical, organizational, and financial dimensions of science, to philosophically oriented analyses of the 
epistemological, linguistic, or cognitive aspects of scientific ideas. The nature of scientific hypotheses differs 
(socially, epistemically, etc.) between sciences as well – meaning that hypotheses formulated, for instance, 
in geology differ from hypotheses formulated in other disciplines in the way that expected cognitive success 
is achieved (or failed to be achieved). If the Anthropocene Hypothesis is to be considered a scientific 
hypothesis, then, in addition to its historical and social context (Chapter 2) and empirical basis (Chapter 3), 
another key aspect to consider is its distinctive epistemological structure237 – that is, what particular epistemic 
properties and knowledge-statements make the hypothesis scientific in terms of how it is expressed and 
articulated. This is the central theme explored in this chapter, which develops on two main trajectories. 
 
237 In this chapter, ‘epistemology’ is intended in its strict sense as the philosophical analysis of knowledge-statements. 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
246 
 
 
The first trajectory explores the research status of the Anthropocene Hypothesis in extant 
scholarship in philosophy. To do so, section 4.1 first assesses how the ‘Anthropocene’ and its stratigraphic 
variants have been assimilated in philosophical discourses. Then, the research status of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis is considered within extant scholarship in philosophy of science. It is recognized that the 
discipline has had almost no interaction with the Anthropocene Hypothesis, with only a few contributions 
exploring the significance of the hypothesis. Reasons for this state of affairs are discussed together with 
extant contributions from the philosophy of science. 
 
The second trajectory directly engages with the Anthropocene Hypothesis by applying theories and 
models in philosophy of science related to the types of scientific hypotheses, scientific explanation, and scientific 
understanding. These represent major themes developed within the philosophical tradition, and have been 
crucial in distinguishing philosophical analyses of science from other approaches to science and scientific 
knowledge. While theories on the topics differ virtually from philosopher to philosopher, it is generally 
considered a desideratum, if not a fundamental epistemic requirement, that a scientific hypothesis should be 
able to explain something about the world, and to provide understanding of the thing it seeks to explain in a 
way that is considered useful. Therefore, section 4.2 considers what type of scientific hypothesis the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis represents, and what this implies in epistemological terms. It furthermore 
assesses whether the Anthropocene Hypothesis is (in principle) invested with any type of explanatory power 
and intelligibility, and if so, how. 
 
 
4.1 The ‘Anthropocene’ in Philosophy 
 
 
As illustrated in Chapter 2, humanistic engagement with the ‘Anthropocene’ began sporadically by the end 
of the 2000s. Between 2000 and 2009, only a dozen texts in the literature exhibited engagement of a 
philosophical nature, primarily raising questions of a normative nature. In the decade that followed, 
philosophy (like other humanistic disciplines) witnessed a surge in interest in the ‘Anthropocene.’ This 
interest has, to date, reflected the original trend, primarily focusing on normative aspects of the 
‘Anthropocene,’ but it has also touched upon other domains of philosophical inquiry.  
 
What knowledge areas pertaining to philosophy have become particularly interested in the 
‘Anthropocene’ as a philosophical category? Answering this question requires a preliminary understanding 
of the organization of philosophy as an academic discipline and space of inquiry. 
 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, philosophy is a discipline difficult to organize into rigidly defined thematic 
clusters. The task of delimiting and organizing the space of inquiry of philosophy (and human knowledge) 
has been a philosophical quest of its own at least since Ancient Greece. Today, at least four organizational 
schemes can be identified to separate philosophy into meaningful branches. The first fourfold scheme 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY 
247 
 
divides philosophy into metaphysics or ontology (the study of the ultimate principles of things), 
epistemology (the study of the nature, structure, and value of knowledge), axiology (the study of the nature, 
meaning, and purpose of ‘value’), and logic (the study of inferential reasoning and truth). A second twofold 
scheme distinguishes between theoretical philosophy (e.g., epistemology, metaphysics, logic, etc.) and 
practical philosophy (e.g., aesthetics, political philosophy, social philosophy, etc.). The third scheme 
distinguishes among seven main branches of philosophy – namely, aesthetics, epistemology, ethics, logic, 
metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science.238 Lastly, the fourth scheme is based on 
philosophical traditions rather than themes or knowledge areas, and distinguishes between analytical 
philosophy, continental philosophy, and pragmatism. These traditions differ in terms of the meaning and 
methods of philosophical inquiry, and have a strong geographical basis.239 Feasibly, the division of 
philosophy into knowledge domains often follows pragmatic and educational necessities and requirements 
posed by individual university departments.240 
 
Following the sevenfold scheme above, the ‘Anthropocene’ has become a category of 
philosophical interest particularly for two branches of philosophy – namely, ethics and aesthetics. Each of 
the two is discussed in the following sections.  
 
The concept has not resonated as an object of interest for epistemology, logic, metaphysics,241 
philosophy of mind, or philosophy of science. This is rather intuitive for some of these branches, such as 
logic, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind. It is unlikely that the concept (or any of its variants) provides 
any added value to the study of reasoning and truth. The same applies for the study of the ultimate principles 
of fundamental entities such as being, truth, time, mind, matter, necessity, and so forth. Issues concerning 
the mind–body problem, consciousness, or mental properties seem also not to grant the ‘Anthropocene’ 
any functional space within philosophy of mind. 
 
However, it seems that the concept – specifically, its stratigraphic variant, the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis – does have space within epistemology, and philosophy of science.  
 
Epistemology is the study of knowledge and its nature. It overlaps in many ways with philosophy 
of science as the study of scientific knowledge. While the Anthropocene Hypothesis has no utility in 
discussions on traditional epistemological problems (e.g., the Münchhausen trilemma, skeptical arguments, 
 
238 The latter systematization is also the one used for the Wikipedia page ‘Outline of philosophy’ 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_philosophy, accessed on August 12. Last revision: May 24, 2021, 13:51 
CET by Thi).  
239 Analytical philosophy developed within the Austrian-born tradition of logical empiricism, spreading especially in 
UK and USA as a consequence of events surrounding the rise of the German National Socialism. Continental 
philosophy (a category most used by analytical philosophers rather than ‘continental’ philosophers to distinguish their 
approaches) stems from mainland Europe (particularly Germany through German Idealism, and France through post-
structuralism and existentialism). Pragmatism is virtually the only American-born philosophical tradition, generated 
by the end of the 19th century through Pierce, James, and later Dewey. 
240 Each of the organizational schemes highlighted above can be found through a simple Google search within a 
substantial pool of different sources. 
241 If considered part of metaphysics, religion studies have also been a contributor in discussions on the 
‘Anthropocene.’ For related literature, see Bedford-Strohm (2017) and the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing 
Institute (a publisher of open access scientific journals) special issue “Faith after the Anthropocene” 
(https://www.mdpi.com/journal/religions/special_issues/Faith_Anthropocene, accessed on August 17, 2021). See

etc.), the fact that the hypothesis challenges traditional disciplinary boundaries (Inkpen & DesRoches, 2019; 
Luciano, 2019) has repercussions for the way that knowledge is (or should be) formulated. In turn, this has 
implications for how knowledge about the Anthropocene as a geological time unit is produced, and what 
knowledge describes it. This fact alone is sufficient to explain why the hypothesis is epistemologically 
interesting. 
 
Philosophy of science concerns questions dealing with the nature of scientific knowledge. As such, 
it seems intuitive that the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific hypothesis should represent an object of 
interest for philosophers of science. However, this has not been the case. Philosophy of science scholarship 
has been largely silent over the scientific debates revolving around the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Section 
4.1.3 explores a major historical and intellectual reason behind this circumstance, and discusses a few 
isolated contributions from philosophers of science engaging with the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
4.1.1 Ethics 
 
Ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with “systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts 
of right and wrong behavior” (Fieser, 2021). Philosophers traditionally divide ethics into normative ethics (the 
study of the principles of right and wrong conduct), applied ethics (the study of the application of ethical 
norms to specific issues of ethical and moral concern), and metaethics (the study of the origin, nature, and 
meaning of ethical standards). With the exception of metaethics, ethics is primarily a normative effort because 
it seeks to discern what is good and bad, and therefore what ought to be done or not done. 
 
Ethics has emerged as one of the branches of philosophy that has most inquired about the 
‘Anthropocene.’ Scholars have discussed the ‘Anthropocene’ as an object of ethical concern, and as a 
vehicle for reframing questions of a philosophical nature concerning the relationship between humans and 
the Earth in the context of deep time, mass extinctions, geological agency, or climate change – among 
others. As such, the ‘Anthropocene’ is situated at the intersection of normative ethics and applied ethics. 
 
The normative-ethical connotations associated with the ‘Anthropocene’ have been developing 
within preexisting discourses at the crossroads of the ethics of nature, environmental philosophy, and 
ecophilosophy (e.g., Leopold, 1981; Naess, 1989; Sessions, 1995; White, 1967). The emergence of these 
subdomains of ethics represented a reaction to increasing social and scientific awareness of the major 
environmental challenges of the present time, from anthropogenic climate change and global warming to 
increasing species extinctions and extreme weather events. This reaction has developed the discrete 
philosophical field of inquiry of environmental ethics. This constitutes an “interdisciplinary-oriented 
practical philosophy which reconstructs the essential types of argumentation that can be made for 
protecting natural entities and the sustainable use of natural resources” (Ott, 2020, p. 1). At the core of 
environmental ethics is the normative task of ascribing a specific set of ethical values to non-human natural 
entities. Environmental philosophers have raised questions on how to ascribe any ethical value (e.g., intrinsic 
values vs. extrinsic values); why such values should be ascribed in the first place (e.g., deontology vs. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY 
249 
 
consequentialism); which ethical values should precisely be formulated (e.g., protection, sustainability, care, 
etc.); and to whom these values should be conferred (e.g., living entities, non-living entities, bacteria, complex 
life, etc.). Answering these interrogatives is crucial in overcoming anthropocentrism – considered by “many 
environmental philosophers the ethical attitude the field [of environmental ethics] was created to 
overcome” (Minteer, 2008, p. 58, quoted in Dzwonkowska, 2018, p. 724). 
 
By the late 2000s, the ‘Anthropocene’ began appearing sporadically in environmental ethics texts 
(Dalby, 2007b; Hall, 2009; Rolston III, 2007), or in topics related to sustainability (Lapka & Cudlinova, 
2009), the concept of ‘nature’ (Drenthen et al., 2009), biotechnology (Crook, 2008), or the ethics of 
technology and infrastructures (Allenby, 2006a, 2006b, 2008, 2009). The term remained, however, an 
informal designation and background notion rather than an epistemically significant term, encompassing 
and encapsulating in a single semantic unity the spectrum of challenges posed by anthropogenic pressures 
on the Earth. Things changed after the ‘humanistic turn’ around 2009. The concept moved from mere 
background notion and informal neologism to a hub for philosophically dense discussions over the place 
and responsibility of humans in engendering a (proposed) new epoch of geological time. In particular, the 
term was assumed (and also contested) for its value in centralizing the role of humans in (re)shaping nature, 
and consequently in (re)shaping the system of values framing the interaction between humans and the rest 
of nature.  
 
Interdisciplinary ecologist Benjamin S. Lowe (2019) has reviewed sample literature (books and 
edited volumes on the ethics of nature) emblematic of the ethical commitment to the ‘Anthropocene’ 
developed in the past decade. He notes that “[t]he Anthropocene in general and climate change in particular 
are not just scientific or technical issues. They are also moral problems, requiring moral solutions” (p. 480). 
Ethical systems based on intergenerational justice and sustainability, on virtue ethics, on hope, on science 
communication, and on pragmatism offer specific solutions to these moral problems, emphasizing specific 
ethical and moral virtues important for facing and reacting to the ‘Anthropocene’ predicament. Lowe notes 
that, across the literature surveyed, particular attention is given to future generations as well as the role of 
virtue ethics.  
 
‘Future generations’ was notoriously a terminological choice selected by the United Nations 1987 
Brundtland Report (also known by its title, Our Common Future) in the definition of ‘sustainable 
development’ as the “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability 
of future generations to meet their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development, 
1987, p. 43). The concepts of ‘Anthropocene’ and ‘sustainability’ formed a close partnership during the 
former’s first years of existence.242  
 
‘Virtue ethics’ represents one of three major approaches in normative ethics – the others being 
consequentialism and deontology (Hursthouse & Pettigrove, 2018). Virtue ethics emphasizes the centrality 
of moral virtues as a fundamental normative category leading a moral agent to take a moral action, and it 
has been one of the ethical frameworks considered relevant for facing the ‘Anthropocene’ (e.g., 
 
242 See section 2.1.3. 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
250 
 
Dzwonkowska, 2018) because “it focuses on making us better people, regardless of the outcomes. As a 
result, it can serve as an intrinsic source of ethical motivation and action even when the future appears 
bleak, complex, and overwhelming” (Lowe, 2019, pp. 484–485). In turn, this “may help increase our 
resilience and enable our communities to sustain higher levels of stability and functioning as socio-
ecological stresses increase” (p. 485). 
 
Sustainability and virtue ethics are only a few of the topics explored by philosophers and scholars 
engaging with ethical and moral questions around the ‘Anthropocene.’ Writer and scholar Joanna Zylinska 
(2014) articulates the ‘Anthropocene’ as an “ethical pointer rather than as a scientific descriptor” (p. 19) – 
implicitly subscribing to a difference between a normative-ethical and descriptive-scientific ‘Anthropocene.’ 
As an ethical category, the ‘Anthropocene’ serves “as a designation of the human obligation towards the 
geo- and biosphere, but also towards thinking about the geo- and biosphere as concepts” (ibid.). These 
concepts would enable “a call for a return to critical thinking” (p. 20). Her proposal for a ‘minimal ethics’ 
for the ‘Anthropocene’ represents an updated version of environmental ethics starting from the premise 
that humans play a pivotal role in the rearrangement of the natural world. It aims at describing an ethics of 
life working at various scales – interactions among humans as well as human and non-human interactions. 
In this framework, the ‘Anthropocene’ designates an ethical form of thinking that is “strongly post-
anthropocentric […] in the sense that it does not consider the human to be the dominant or the most 
important species, nor does it see the world as arranged solely for human use and benefit” (p. 20), but 
simply appeals to the capacity of humans to shape the world and, in doing so, rearrange ethical interactions 
with nature. 
 
In his book (or ‘travelogue,’ as the author defines it) Philosophy of the Anthropocene, philosopher Sverre 
Raffnsøe (2016) frames the ‘Anthropocene’ as a time “characterized by the overarching importance of the 
human species in a number of respects. Closely related to this new role is a new heightened sense of human 
responsibility, but also the recognition of human dependence and precariousness” (p. xii). The philosopher 
locates an ongoing ‘human turn’ – that is, “a new, altered relationship between humankind and its 
surroundings” (p. xiv). This human turn is heralded by the dawn of the ‘Anthropocene,’ representing a state 
that “fundamentally changes the character of the world that we humans inhabit, and also our relationship 
with this world, be it on a local or a global scale” (p. xv). This fundamental change implies a change in the 
ethical norms governing human interaction with the world as well as humankind’s perception of itself. 
Philosophy (viz., ethics) can help in understanding this fundamental change and human turn, and provide 
answers to the ethical challenges these conditions pose.  
 
An interesting observation about Raffnsøe (2016) concerns the very title of his book – not ‘Ethics’ 
of the Anthropocene,’ but rather ‘Philosophy’ of the Anthropocene. This is emblematic of the implicit assumption 
that philosophy (which comprehends fields as diverse as logic, epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy 
of science) is invested with a normative-ethical responsibility when tackling the concept of ‘Anthropocene.’ 
This assumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it considers it necessary for philosophy to 
engage with discussions about the ‘Anthropocene’ as a boundary object of ethical and moral interest. On 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY 
251 
 
the other hand, it seems to implicitly delimit the space of philosophical inquiry exclusively to the ethical, and 
broader normative aspects, of the ‘Anthropocene.’ This implicit assumption leaves little space for extra-
ethical considerations of the ‘Anthropocene,’ and more precisely, of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. The 
absence of substantial literature from the philosophy of science seems to further corroborate the idea that 
philosophy has perceived the ‘Anthropocene’ primarily as a theoretical object confined within the domain 
of environmental ethics (or aesthetics). 
 
The ethics-oriented purpose of philosophy in ‘Anthropocene’ discourses is made explicit by 
philosopher Richard Polt and political scientist Jon Wittrock (2018) in their edited volume The Task of 
Philosophy in the Anthropocene – a collection of contributions “sensitive to concerns that are typical of the so-
called continental philosophy” (p. xiii). The authors observe that “[a]rt, literature, history, and the 
humanities at large are challenged to respond in their own ways to the Anthropocene by drawing on the 
accumulated reserve of human meanings and experiences to make sense of our new relationship with the 
planet” (p. x). To this end, philosophers are invested with “a special responsibility to participate in the 
discussion” (ibid.). Besides “understanding the Anthropocene and its roots,” the authors suggest, 
“philosophers may have a responsibility to ask whether there is anything that they, as philosophers, can do. 
Can we affect the future for the better [emphasis added]?” (ibid.). The task of philosophy, thus, is a normative 
effort striving toward an amelioration of the present and the future in the face of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Like 
other works in ethics engaging with the ‘Anthropocene,’ Polt and Wittrock also construe a notion of 
philosophy that starts from the observation of a fundamental, radical shift in the relationship between 
humans and the planet. The task of philosophy is, therefore, a task of a primarily ethical drive – that is, 
redefining the ethical norms for developing a sustainable and responsible relationship with the Earth. 
 
Another contribution from Schmidt et al. (2016) articulates a “research agenda regarding how 
ethics both remain relevant to the Anthropocene and at the same time necessitate thinking through 
transitions implied by the increasing human impacts on the Earth System” (p. 3). Here, ethics is once again 
evoked as an area theoretically and practically affected by the dawn of the ‘Anthropocene,’ a time “where 
previous ethical norms require reassessment and novel problems arise in what are often metaphysical blind 
spots” (p. 9). The authors advance a series of points that extant ethical discourses must face, from 
reconsidering present ethical norms to discussing new and unprecedented concerns. 
 
This sample literature provides a snapshot of the philosophical engagement with the 
‘Anthropocene’ within ethics (see also Callicott, 2018; Hamilton, 2017; Lowe, 2019; Merchant, 2021; 
Williston, 2015). What emerges is a picture of a concept that encompasses a range of phenomena generating 
questions of profound ethical value. These questions converge toward two seemingly central problems in 
contemporary ethics in and of the ‘Anthropocene’ – namely, whether a revision of traditional ethical systems 
is called for; and which ethical system (novel or old) is the most suitable solution for reframing humans’ 
relationship with the world. As an ethical category, the ‘Anthropocene’ functions as a catalyst for joining 
these discourses into a unified framework – although criticism addressing it ethical utility have been raised, 
as later addressed in section 5.1.4.

4.1.2 Aesthetics 
 
Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy encompassing a wide range of philosophical questions over the nature 
of sensorial perception and statements, particularly in relation to beauty and taste. The term assumes various 
designations, such as “a kind of object, a kind of judgment, a kind of attitude, a kind of experience, and a 
kind of value” (Shelley, 2020). Aesthetics is closely tied with philosophy of art, where aesthetic evaluation 
of artworks plays a central role. It also overlaps with and transcends the academically defined boundaries 
of philosophy, merging with academic and non-academic domains such as visual culture, music, art 
exhibitions, and museum expositions. 
 
Scholar Robert Emmett (2018) has stressed that the ‘Anthropocene’ concept “necessarily involves 
aesthetics” because it “travels not only as a scientific and political [and ethical] object of knowledge, but 
also as a call to artists, writers, and makers of many kinds to reflect on human un-making of living worlds” 
(p. 159). Over the past decade, the ‘Anthropocene’ has become an aesthetic phenomenon of vast interest 
for the artistic and visual community. Museum and gallery exhibitions, documentaries, and music 
performance and culture are among the ways in which the ‘artistic Anthropocene’ has manifested itself in 
a contemporary aesthetic sensibility. This constellation of contributions has engendered the ‘Anthropocene’ 
as an aesthetic category – one that narrates by visual, sensorial, and broader artistic means the meaning and 
implications of considering humans a novel geophysical agent. This heterogenous body of research has 
developed to answer fundamental aesthetic questions – namely, how can the ‘Anthropocene’ be visualized? 
What sensory experiences are most emblematic of the ‘Anthropocene’? What does it mean, aesthetically, to 
live in the ‘Anthropocene’ and, for humans, to be a geological agent? How does one ‘experience’ the 
‘Anthropocene’? 
 
The Anthropocene Slam is an example of aesthetic engagement with the ‘Anthropocene.’ This 
event was organized by the Nelson Institute’s Center for Culture, History, and Environment (CHE) at the 
University of Wisconsin–Madison, in cooperation with the Rachel Carson Center in Munich, and the 
Environmental Humanities Laboratory at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. It took place 
at CHE in November 2014, where scholars, artists, and scientists of international provenance were brought 
together to select a pool of objects best representing the cabinet of curiosities or Wunderkammer of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ Some of these objects were displayed months later as part of the collection of the 
Deutsches Museum exhibition Welcome to the Anthropocene, held between 2014 and 2016. The collection 
(Möllers et al., 2015) exposed objects as aesthetic mediums that could “summon all at once the past, present, 
and future, blending the global and local – and thus they can disrupt linear narratives, including those about 
the Anthropocene” (Mitman et al., 2018, p. xi). Some of these objects, from a trestle steam engine and a 
manual gasoline pump to a 1984 Apple Macintosh personal computer and a hairdryer, tell of “important 
technological milestones along our path into the Anthropocene” (Trischler, 2015, p. 130). This “Wall of 
Anthropocenic Objects” (ibid.) provided visitors of any occupation, background, and age with an aesthetic 
representation of the ‘Anthropocene,’ and what it means to live in it. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY 
253 
 
 
The idea that some objects could grant an aesthetic ‘body’ to the concept of ‘Anthropocene’ drew 
from designer and sound artist Yesenia Thibault-Picazo, who developed an Anthropogenic Specimens 
Cabinet in collaboration with Jan Zalasiewicz. The Cabinet is part of the Craft in the Anthropocene project, “a 
speculative design project which raises questions and stirs a debate around the novel theory of the 
Anthropocene.”243 The project (launched in 2013) began with Thibault-Picazo creating three household 
objects – a pestle made of Cumbrian Bone Marble (an imagined future rock resulting from the 2001 
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK), a mortar made out of PPC (Pacific Plastic Crust), and an 
aluminum vessel – reflecting future geological material of anthropogenic origin. Each object symbolizes the 
impact of humans not simply on the environment, but on the geology of the planet, foretelling of a 
stratigraphic footprint that humans will leave behind. As such, the project represents a speculative aesthetic 
visualization of the future rocks and soils on the ‘Anthropocene’ Earth, provoking reflection “around our 
conception of nature and ultimately to invite [us] to reimagine how we inhabit the world” (Yalcinkaya, 
2018). 
 
Art has been a pivotal aesthetic vehicle for communicating the ‘Anthropocene.’ Introducing their 
edited volume Art in the Anthropocene, humanist Heather Davis and philosopher Etienne Turpin (Davis & 
Turpin, 2015b) ask, “[W]hat does it mean for art to encounter the Anthropocene? […] [H]ow can aesthetic 
practices address the social and political spheres that are being set in stone?” (p. 3). In this aesthetics-based 
interpretation, art does not solely arouse individual sensory experiences in perceiving and visualizing the 
dawn of a new epoch. Art becomes a vehicle for social and political communication about the heavy burden 
posed by humans on the planet. Indeed, “art, as the vehicle of aesthesis, is central to thinking with and feeling 
through the Anthropocene” (ibid.). That is because, first, the ‘Anthropocene’ represents a sensorial 
experience – “the experience of living in an increasingly diminished and toxic world” (ibid.). Second, 
because aesthetic experiences complement and transgress satellite imagery, data visualization, and other 
modelling and visual techniques representing the Earth as a whole. Third, because art may also provide a 
“non-moral form of address that offers a range of discursive, visual, and sensual strategies that are not 
confined by the regimes of scientific objectivity, political moralism, or psychological depression” (p. 4).  
 
Visual culture theorist Nicholas Mirzoeff (2014) writes that “to visualize the Anthropocene is to 
invoke the aesthetic” (p. 213). Visualization has been a central theme in aesthetics, as it is the pivotal concept 
at the core of visual cultures. It constitutes a process of representing complex phenomena or entities by 
means of a wide array of visual techniques. Visualization has been a central aspect in science, where 
phenomena unobservable with the naked eye (e.g., subatomic interactions, black holes) are often 
represented through digital models and photographs; in art, through practices such as painting, sculpture, 
and architecture; and in society at large, where visual images play a crucial role in the mechanisms behind 
the functioning of modern societies – from simple commercials to ideological propaganda and military 
strategy. Mirzoeff observes that the goal of visualization “is to maintain the authority of the visualizer, 
above and beyond the visualizer’s material power” (p. 216). Just like “the Empire of nineteenth-century 
 
243 See https://yeseniatp.com/THE-ANTHROPOGENIC-SPECIMENS-CABINET (accessed on August 11, 2021). 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
254 
 
imaginations, then the West of the Cold War, and now the Market” (ibid.), the ‘Anthropocene’ entails a 
visuality whose authority “can be felt across the world” (p. 217) by means of human actions. This authority 
is left unchallenged, so that 
 
Anthropocene visuality allows us to move on, to see nothing and keep circulating commodities, 
despite the destruction of the biosphere. We do so less out of venal convenience, as some might 
suggest, than out of a modernist conviction that “the authorities” will restore everything to order 
in the end. […] Anthropocene visuality keeps us believing that somehow the war against nature that 
Western society has been waging for centuries is not only right; it is beautiful and it can be won. If 
this is certainly a Western imperial project, the shame and the crisis is that it has affected every living 
thing whatsoever. But, as we shall see, it does not do so evenly and equitably. (ibid.) 
 
Such aesthetics of the ‘Anthropocene’ has “emerged as an unintended supplement to imperial aesthetics” 
(p. 220). It legitimizes a visuality that does not simply hinder the search for solutions to the very problem 
it poses, but it also legitimizes a colonial relationship between the world’s superpowers (and top 
contributors to climate change) and the poorer countries. Escaping this visual framework requires a 
‘countervisuality’ that grounds on three claims: “a claim to move out of the ‘place’ allocated to one by birth, 
a claim to democracy on behalf of the part that has no part, and a means of sustaining these claims beyond 
the spontaneous moment of uprising” (p. 226). 
 
That the aesthetics (viz., visualization practices) of the ‘Anthropocene’ entails some aspects 
requiring problematization has been also advanced by T. J. Demos (2017). In his book Against the 
Anthropocene, the visual culture theorist asks, “How does the Anthropocene enter into visuality, and what 
are its politics of representation?” (p. 12). As a geological time period, the ‘Anthropocene’ stretches 
temporally and spatially, therefore presenting “major challenges to representation systems” (p. 13). Demos 
notes that  
 
Anthropocene visualizations, which seldom focus on environmental emergencies and attritional 
scenes of slow violence, introduce an added complexity in that they often do not employ 
photography as their visual medium of choice, but rather opt for high-resolution satellite imagery 
that provides photographic-like pictures, such as those employed by Globaïa[244]. […] Yet in most 
cases regarding lay usage, these images have not only been carefully edited in order to show generally 
positive examples of modern development, but they have also already been interpreted for viewers 
(or rather consumers), insofar as they have been packaged as pictures, but without typically offering 
access to location data, ownership, legibility, or source information. In other words, the images 
seem hyper-legible, but in fact they are far from transparent or direct. 
 
These visualization practices engendering the ‘Anthropocene’ complement the seemingly universalizing 
rhetoric of the concept – where all humans are equally responsible for the dawn of this new epoch. 245 Such 
practices developed within a “specific political and economic framework, comprising a visual system 
 
244 Demos is particularly referring to Globaïa’s website, https://globaia.org/ (accessed on August 12, 2021). 
245 On criticism of the implicit universalization of the anthropos in the ‘Anthropocene,’ see section 5.1.1. This has been 
a shared argument against the ‘Anthropocene’ concept and discourses among critics. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY

delivered and constituted by the post-Cold War and largely Western-based military-state-corporate 
apparatus” (p. 18). Deconstructing this visual representation of the ‘Anthropocene’ is paramount in order 
to engage with political effort for social change. This is a task akin to Mirzoeff’s idea of ‘countervisuality,’ 
except that, instead of providing an alternative imagery to the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, Demos renders this 
concept almost null, as it “can be roundly criticized for its assorted failings – terminological, philosophical, 
ecological, political” (p. 85). The only space left for the ‘Anthropocene’ is in “register[ing] the geological 
impact of colonial and industrial activities on Earth’s natural systems” (ibid.). This connotation (and the 
visual representations around it) may prove useful in confronting climate change denial, and the fossil fuel 
industry behind it. 
 
One last and well-known contribution to aesthetic representations of the ‘Anthropocene’ comes 
from Edward Burtyinsky. In 2018, the artist and photographer launched The Anthropocene Project – a 
“multidisciplinary body of work combining fine art photography, film, virtual reality, [and] augmented 
reality” (Burtynski, n.d.). The project included visualizations of the ‘Anthropocene’ through photographs 
of anthropogenically altered landscapes, a travelling museum exhibition (first opening on September 28, 
2018, at the Art Gallery of Ontario and National Gallery of Canada), and a documentary film. This work 
provides a comprehensive visual body for the ‘Anthropocene,’ while simultaneously stressing the magnitude 
of human impacts as a geophysical agent. 
 
As an aesthetic object, the concept of the ‘Anthropocene’ encompasses a broad range of artistic 
expressions (and critiques) at the intersection of visual culture, political commitment, science 
communication, and social call. Representing a spatially and temporally extended geological time unit is an 
aesthetic challenge, especially when defined in terms of deep time, but also in terms of social perception of 
this novel time period. The body of work surveyed in this section embodies an attempt in this direction, a 
discussion on the visual means, implications, and significance of the ‘Anthropocene’ as an aesthetic 
category. 
 
4.1.3 Philosophy of Science 
 
Philosophy of science “includes all philosophical questions asked about or within the sciences” (Ladyman, 
2019, p. 189). It largely overlaps with epistemology in raising fundamental questions about scientific 
knowledge in terms of its nature, justification, and purpose. From Bacon, Descartes, Leibniz, Hume, and 
Kant through Comte, Peirce, Mach, and Boltzmann to logical empiricism, Kuhn, and Quine, philosophy 
of science has historically been a structural component of ‘Western’ philosophical reflections on the 
methods, foundations, and purpose of science. As such, it represents an indispensable contributor to 
understanding the epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific hypothesis.

The ‘Anthropocene’ was not as successful in the philosophy of science as it has been in ethics (as 
an ethical category) or aesthetics (as an aesthetic category).246 Engagement with this hypothesis from 
philosophy of science has been scarce, and only a very limited number of philosophers of science have 
tackled the ‘Anthropocene’ as a scientific idea in recent years (Foster, 2018; Inkpen & DesRoches, 2019; 
Santana, 2019a). The lack of a substantial commitment from the philosophy of science represents a major 
research gap and, necessarily, a problem for discussing the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Why, then, is it the case that philosophers of science have had very little voice in debates 
surrounding the hypothesis? Section 1.3.3 anticipated some plausible reasons behind this fact, including 
recent developments in the philosophy of science in light of newly emerging approaches to the study of 
science; the fact that the term did not echoed among philosophers of science; or the seemingly ‘political’ 
nature of the ‘Anthropocene’ debate overshadowing the ‘analytical’ nature of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. Another possible reason is the institutional absence of a philosophy of geology (intended as 
‘epistemology of geology’) as a subdiscipline of philosophy of science.  
 
Throughout the 20th century, increased knowledge specialization engendered a transition from the 
philosophy of science to philosophies of sciences – such as philosophy of physics, biology, artificial intelligence, 
neurosciences, cognitive sciences, medicine, and so forth. As noted by philosopher Derek Turner (2013), 
“[r]ather than starting with a general picture of how science works (or is supposed to work) and then asking 
how well particular fields fit that picture – a top-down approach – many philosophers these days prefer to 
start at the bottom with a careful characterization of some limited domain of scientific practice” (2013, p. 
12). However, this transition did not fully materialize for the domain of geology, resulting in the institutional 
absence of a philosophy of geology as a discrete and autonomous field of inquiry. A resulting consequence 
of this academic vacuum is that the epistemology of an entire disciplinary domain has not been adequately 
framed, neither within traditional topoi in philosophy of science (e.g., scientific discovery, scientific progress, 
scientific explanation, etc.) nor within the specific epistemic aspects distinguishing geology as a discipline.  
 
In the following section, it is advanced that the circumstances leading to an institutional absence 
of the philosophy of geology are fundamentally related to the role that physics played as an exemplar science 
in the 20th-century philosophy of science. This aspect is worth probing more deeply as it represents a major 
hindrance insofar as discussing the epistemology of a geological hypothesis needs to be located within a 
philosophy of geology framework. After this brief detour, extant scholarship in the philosophy of science 
discussing the Anthropocene Hypothesis is examined. 
 
 
246 It seems that science-oriented philosophical analyses of continental imprint have had more success than traditional 
‘analytical’ philosophy of science in discussing the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Recently, 
several articles engaging with the ‘Anthropocene’ have appeared in the journal Foundations of Science (e.g., De Preester, 
2021; Lemmens & Van Den Eede, 2021; Pandilovski, 2021; Zwart, 2021). These articles draw on hermeneutics, 
Hegelian dialectics, and Heidegger to approach the ‘Anthropocene,’ science, and technology. Because of their 
methodological diversity, they are not discussed in the present context. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY 
257 
 
4.1.3.1 Physics as Paradigm 
 
As observed by geologist Victor Baker (2013), physics has been regarded (more or less explicitly) as the 
“exemplar for all science” (p. vi) in philosophy of science for most of the 20th century up to the present 
day. Philosophical theories and models of and about science have largely drawn on physics (particularly 
theoretical physics) as the discipline that most embodies the epistemic virtues of science. Similarly, 
traditional philosophical textbooks of seminal importance – from Popper’s The Logic of Scientific Discovery 
(1959) to Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolution (1962) – systematically draw on historical and 
philosophical examples from physics, in particular theoretical physics and astronomy. There are several 
reasons behind this.  
As part of philosophia naturalis, physics, and most notably astronomy, had already established itself 
as the main protagonist of the so-called Scientific Revolution. In fact, the very picture of the scientific 
method that emerged was largely sculpted around the epistemology and methodology of physics. Its 
popularity as ‘mother of all sciences’ was well-established not merely by the success of Newtonian 
mechanics (whose philosophical influence is exemplified by Kant’s conceptions of space and time), but also 
by the positions invested in society and research institutions by many father figures in natural philosophy, 
such as Isaac Newton,247 René Descartes, Tycho Brahe, and Galileo Galilei, to name a few. Furthermore, 
many physicists of the late 19th and early 20th century were also philosophers, and vice versa – from Ernst 
Mach, Henri Poincaré, and Ludwig Boltzmann, to Paul Feyerabend and Thomas Kuhn. Questions of 
physics were also questions of philosophy – to the point that philosophy of science in the 20th century “has 
come to be identical with philosophy of analytical physics” (Baker, 1996b, p. 197). During the 1950s, 
naturalistic philosophies began to approach philosophical problems by looking at answers from science, 
especially psychology (as famously advocated by Quine) or physics – somewhat inverting the ‘traditional’ 
relationship between philosophy and science. Philosophy of physics was certainly under the spotlight during 
the 20th century (Ladyman, 2019), only paralleled by philosophy of biology during the 1970s and 1980s.  
A second reason is connected to the nature of philosophical questions. Virtually since the inception 
of philosophy with the Ionian school in Ancient Greece (6th century BCE), philosophers began exploring 
the nature of things by posing fundamental questions that, with the development of modern science and 
specialized knowledge, were reformulated in terms of fundamental physics (Schrödinger, 1956). With the 
development of special and general relativity as well as quantum mechanics, philosophical and scientific 
questions became one entangled pursuit. For instance, logical empiricism contested Kant’s a priori 
conception of space-time based on the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries, notably the Minkowski 
spacetime implied by Einstein’s special relativity. Questions about the nature of reality seemed to shift from 
a matter of metaphysics or traditional epistemology to one of theoretical physics and astronomy – both 
 
247 Interestingly, during the last years of his life, Newton made a calculation of the age of the Earth based (as was 
common at that time) on biblical scriptures suggesting that the Earth was 6,000 years old (Leddra, 2010). Newton was 
in fact considered an exemplar scientist among the emerging natural sciences throughout the 18th and 19th century, 
including Earth sciences (Gould, 1987; Leddra, 2010, quoting Cadbury, 2000, p. 155). 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
258 
 
inquiring into the nature of the universe from the smallest to the largest scale by providing naturalistic 
explanations of reality. To an extreme, the enthusiasm and confidence in physics is embodied in caricature 
by Ernest Rutherford’s oft-cited claim that all science is either physics or stamp collecting (Birks, 1962). 
Related to this is the fact that physics has been attributed a ‘special’ epistemological status due to 
the nomological, abstract, immanent, deductive, and predictive structure of its knowledge domain (Moharir, 
1993), mostly due to its close and successful partnership with mathematics (a discipline highly regarded at 
least since Ancient Greece). These features – which are often “taken to be laudatory, but need not 
necessarily be so” (p. 285) – granted physics the status of the “most methodologically precise and 
theoretically convergent of the natural sciences” (Baker, 1999, p. 634). In opposition, historical sciences 
such as geology were considered rather concrete, historical, inductive, and descriptive – all epistemic 
attributes regarded as lesser than those of physics. 
A fourth reason is related to the success of physics during the 20th century – besides Einstein’s 
contributions and the development of quantum mechanics. Particle physics unveiled a whole new 
subatomic reality, whose array of properties and particles could no longer be encapsulated by the concept 
of ‘atom.’ Superconductivity, a property of certain materials of crucial importance for contemporary 
advancements in technology, was discovered in 1911 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. The cosmological model 
known as the Big Bang emerged, corroborated by the observations of galactic redshift by Edwin Hubble in 
1929, and by the (accidental) discovery of a cosmic microwave background in 1965 by Arno Penzias and 
Robert Wilson. Antiparticles, antimatter, and dark matter were discovered as additional components of the 
universe. The famous physicist Richard Feynman developed a revolutionary approach in representing 
subatomic interactions known as Feynman Diagrams. Lastly, a unified framework explaining three (out of 
four) of the fundamental forces of the universe was developed. These key developments, which informed 
and stimulated philosophical research as well as popular culture, do not exhaust the overall discoveries and 
restructuring of knowledge that physics brought about during the 20th century.  
A fifth reason explaining the role of physics in society and in philosophy during the 20th century 
concerns the broader social and political role that it played after the discovery of nuclear fission in 1938. 
Physicists were at the core of the Manhattan Project, which led to the creation, testing, and use in warfare 
of the first atomic devices. In the aftermath of World War II, physics stood at the forefront of the increasing 
political tensions between the so-called ‘Western’ and the ‘Eastern’ Blocs. The ‘Space Race’ and the arms 
race that characterized the Cold War positioned scientists at the center of the debate,248 and physicists at 
 
248 The importance of physics in the Cold War Science context does not diminish the importance of other disciplines 
involved in the scenario. As shown by historian and geologist Naomi Oreskes (1999), geology (viz., applied geology) 
itself played an eminent role in the Cold War period, in that geologists participated in intense mining practices that 
fueled the high military as well as social and economic demands. Historian Jürgen Renn (2020) also notes that the 
“development of the earth sciences in the second half of the twentieth century was driven by strong economic and 
military interests – in particular, by the search for natural resources and geostrategic advantages in the Cold War” (p. 
240). The environmental historian Andrea Westermann (2015) highlights the contribution of geology in generating a 
“systematic and international supply of mineral resources” (p. 152) by the late 19th and early 20th century. This 
scholarship is important for ensuring that geology’s societal role and impact prior to, during, and after the Cold War 
period are not diminished. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY

the very frontline. Physics was at the center stage of Cold War Science – namely, the politically, socially, 
and economically driven development of science under the pressure of tense international relationships 
between NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization. This was reflected by the massive economic and 
educational maneuvers that the United States implemented after the end of World War II. In fact, “[b]y 
1953, the level of spending for ‘fundamental’ physics research within the United States was 20 to 25 times 
greater than it had been in 1938” (Kaiser, 2000, p. 132). Spending was accompanied by a growth in graduate 
student enrollment to meet an increasing demand for “physicists-manpower” (p. 133). 
The annual number of doctoral degrees in physics granted by institutions in the United States saw 
an unprecedented and steady growth – to the extent that inconveniences such as “lack of office space, 
overcrowded laboratory conditions, proliferation of new bureaucratic procedures, a widespread feelings of 
‘facelessness,’ and a perilous loss of ‘intimacy’” (p. 136) were common among physics departments. 
Between 1945 and 1951 alone, the growth rate of PhDs granted in physics was 200% of the average growth 
rate across all fields (p. 136). This was unparalleled in any other field.  
 
The growth of physics in academic infrastructure affected other disciplines as well. After the almost 
sudden conversion of the international geological community to continental drift and plate tectonics during 
the 1950s and 1960s, physics began to play a major role in geology curricula, and “[g]eology departments 
began to hire physicists and to insist that their graduate students acquire much greater competence in 
physics than had previously been the case” (Laudan, 1982, p. 10). Accordingly, philosophy of physics 
became a central theme in philosophy of science (Ladyman, 2019). The necessity of discussing the 
knowledge provided by research in physics, but also its role in society, further forged the identity of 
philosophy of science as based upon physics. 
One last reason relates to the seminal role that logical empiricism played in the early 20th century 
in initiating a physics-oriented tradition in the philosophy of science. The movement gravitated especially 
around two circles – the Vienna Circle (including Moritz Schlick, Otto Neurath, Rudolf Carnap, Hans 
Hahn, and Kurt Gödel) and the Berlin Circle (Hans Reichenbach, Carl Gustav Hempel, and David Hilbert) 
– but it also included intellectuals from the UK, the US, Poland, and even as far as China (Creath, 2020). 
Figures associated with, but not directly part of, the movement included Albert Einstein, Ludwig 
Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russel, and Karl Popper. Although the movement diversified in terms of 
philosophical views, the members shared a common enthusiasm for natural sciences, logic, mathematics, 
and language, and an explicitly strong anti-metaphysical commitment – exemplified by the Wittgenstein-
inspired doctrine of ‘Verificationism,’ which considered most (if not all) the questions of traditional (viz., 
continental) philosophy as meaningless in virtue of not being (in principle) verifiable. Many members 
affiliated with the movement shared a training in physics, logic, or mathematics. These disciplines largely 
shaped the movement’s ‘scientific world conception,’ as outlined by their manifesto: 
 
especially since 1900, […] there was in Vienna a sizeable number of people who frequently and 
assiduously discussed more general problems in close connection with empirical sciences. Above all 
these were epistemological and methodological problems of physics [emphasis added], for instance Poincare’s 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
260 
 
conventionalism, Duhem’s conception of the aim and structure of physical theories (his translator 
was the Viennese Friedrich Adler, a follower of Mach, at that time privatdozent in Zurich); also 
questions about the foundations of mathematics, problems of axiomatics, logisticand the like. 
(Neurath, 1973, p. 303) 
 
Further reasons could be found for the ‘special’ role that physics has played in the 20th century, and that it 
still plays in contemporary debates on scientific knowledge. Assimilation in popular culture phenomena is 
also an example of this. Intriguing and fascinating Gedankenexperimente, such as Schrödinger’s cat (to illustrate 
quantum indeterminacy) or the twin paradox (to illustrate special relativity), have been major drivers for 
popular perception of science in recent decades – although this constitutes a product, more than a cause, 
of the popularity of physics. Perhaps the most emblematic example of popular assimilation of physics in 
very recent times is The Big Bang Theory, the famous twelve-season American sitcom with genius-but-
awkward physicists as the main characters of the show. Curiously, Season 7, Episode 20 (“The Relationship 
Diremption”) sees Sheldon Cooper, a theoretical physicist from Caltech and one of the protagonists, 
denigrating geology (something he is fond of doing) by labelling it as the “Kardashian of science.” While 
this is only fictional, a ‘derivative view’ (at times besmirching) of geology has been a shared belief among 
philosophers as well as geologists themselves even before the 20th century.249 
The reasons highlighted above quickly surveyed the general place and role of physics in 20th-century 
philosophy of science. An indirect consequence of the privileged epistemic and social position that physics 
enjoyed within philosophical discourses on science was the difficulty in developing a discrete tradition in 
the philosophy of geology. 
Geology has not been utterly unknown to philosophers of science, although it is hardly recognized 
compared to physics, biology, or chemistry. To illustrate this, comparing ‘philosophy of geology’ with 
‘philosophy of physics’ and ‘philosophy of biology’ by using the Google Book Ngrams Viewer shows that 
the former trigram has remained largely unused throughout the century (Figure 4.1). Notably, the graphic 
is consistent with the historical and political role of physics during the early and middle phase of the Cold 
War, and with the growing interest in biology in the 1970s that stemmed from Niles Eldredge and Stephen 
J. Gould’s theory of punctuated equilibrium (Eldredge & Gould, 1972).  
 
 
249 The idea of geology as a derivative science was not uncommon among theoretical discussions on the fundamentals 
of geology during the 20th century. The geologist David B. Kitts (1978) noted that “[t]he view that geological principles 
are comprehended by physical laws dates from the very beginning of geology in the 18th century” (p. 215). Writing in 
1989, the geologist and historian William Brice (1989) subscribed to this view, claiming that “concepts in geology can 
never be developed to the point where they would be independent of other sciences” (p. 85). This view seems to be 
endorsed (more or less explicitly) in the present by some philosophers of science. For instance, Nicholas Maxwell 
(2017) discusses the major problems of philosophy of science in the context of theoretical physics. He argues, “I do 
this because it is above all in this context that these problems arise in their most pristine form. All these problems 
arise for all branches of natural science, and for natural science as a whole, but when it comes to sciences other than 
physics, there is always some more fundamental science whose results are more or less taken for granted. This means 
that in chemistry, biology, astronomy, or geology, theories are never accepted on the basis of evidence alone: there 
are always the results of some more fundamental science which influence what is accepted. Only in fundamental 
theoretical physics, it seems, is it the case that there is no more fundamental science whose results may be taken for 
granted” (p. 7).

n-grams in the English corpus (2012) between 1900 and 2000. Results are case-insensitive and 
smoothed to a value of 3. (Source: Google Book Ngram Viewer, accessed on July 8, 2020) 
 
 
Even by looking at the number of results for each of the three fields on Google Scholar, philosophy of 
physics ranks first with 2.97 million results, followed by philosophy of biology with 2.73 million results. 
Only 384,000 results are associated with philosophy of geology.250  
These figures show quantitative evidence that philosophy of geology “has largely been 
underappreciated as 20th century philosophy of science pursued its successive fads of logical positivism, 
critical rationalism, relativism, and deconstructivism – for all of which ‘science’ is synonymous with 
‘physics’” (Baker, 1996b, p. 197; see also Baxter, 2003). This equivalence of ‘science’ and ‘physics’ is 
elegantly summarized by Stephen J. Gould in his popular 1987 book Time’s Arrow, where he states: 
 
Geology resides in the middle of this false continuum, and has often tried to win prestige by aping 
the procedures of sciences with higher status, and ignoring its own distinctive data of history. This 
problem, born of low self-esteem, continues to our day. Hutton pursued a chimerical view of rigor 
by deference to Newton, and hoped to assimilate time to Newton’s models for space. Today, this 
deference may be expressed in a fetish for quantification that leads psychologists to conceive 
intelligence as a single, measurable thing in the head, or biologists to classify organisms by computer 
without judging the different historical value of characters (the marsupial pouch as more 
informative than body length). Charles Lyell recognized the link between Hutton and Newton, but 
he also noted an unhappy comparison – the triumph of cosmology versus the limited success of 
Hutton’s world machine. […] Hutton’s rigidity is both a boon and a trap. It gave us deep time, but 
we lost history in the process. Any adequate account of the earth requires both. (Gould, 1987, p. 
97) 
 
The consequences are that philosophy of geology has remained largely unexplored and underdeveloped, 
when compared to other subfields within philosophy of science. Even in history of science, where geology 
has seen more attention, the discovery of deep time and the true age of the Earth is the least frequently

mentioned among scientific revolutions (Dodick & Orion, 2003). Post-WWII historiography of geology 
largely addresses the history of geology from the 17th to the 19th century (Oldroyd, 2002), and only until 
recently has 20th-century geology seen substantial historical research (Frankel, 2012; Oreskes, 1999). Yet its 
importance could be considered, to use Sigmund Freud’s famous words, another “great outrage” upon 
humans’ “naïve self-love” (Freud, 2014, p. 250): in addition to the heliocentric (Copernican Revolution) 
and the anthropocentric (Darwinian Revolution), there is the ‘chronocentric’251 wound inflicted by the 
discovery of the Earth’s true age (Rudwick, 2005). 
The lack of a sound philosophical commitment to geology has repercussions in understanding the 
epistemological setting of the discipline. This represents a particularly important issue in framing the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis as a stratigraphic hypothesis. Intuitively, if much of the discourse and concepts 
developed by philosophers of science to study science are stamped upon the image of physics, then it is 
plausible that these discourses and concepts (e.g., explanatory power, intelligibility, utility) may be unsuitable 
for conducting an epistemological analysis of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. While philosophical literature 
interested in geological research has been disjointedly emerging over the last few decades,252 developing a 
discrete traditional and institutionally sound philosophy of geology remains an open issue still to be tackled 
by the international philosophy of science community. 
 
4.1.3.2 The Anthropocene Hypothesis in the Philosophy of Science 
 
Three contributions from the philosophy of science have given particular attention to the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. None of these contributions explicitly articulates the ‘Anthropocene’/Anthropocene 
Hypothesis distinction in the way exposed and articulated throughout this research. Therefore, the two 
entities are at times interchanged and overlapped semantically. Nevertheless, a set of considerations over 
the stratigraphic nature of the ‘Anthropocene’ is distinctly identifiable. This makes it justifiable to recognize 
these considerations as implicitly addressing the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
The first contribution is Carlos Santana’s (2019a) “Waiting for the Anthropocene,” published by 
The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science in December 2019. The article was awarded the 2019 Karl Popper 
Prize, conferred annually to the best papers appearing in the journal. 
 
Santana explores the epistemic legitimacy of the Anthropocene Hypothesis by adopting a ‘future 
geologist perspective’ and a ‘synchronic perspective.’ The future geologist perspective projects the present 
stratigraphic footprint of humans far into the future to determine its geological significance. Invoking a 
future geologist perspective has been a recurrent topos in Anthropocene Studies research, and has been 
 
251 The term ‘chronocentrism’ was coined by media theorist Jib Fowles in 1974 to describe “the belief that one’s times 
are paramount, that other periods pale in comparison. It is a faith in the historical importance of the present” (Fowles, 
1974, p. 65). Whereas Fowles stresses the ethnographic matrix of this belief, the term is implemented in the present 
research metaphorically to characterize human’s history in the context of deep time. 
252 In particular, see the work of Claude Albritton (1952, 1963a, 1963b, 1975, 1988), David Kitts (1963a, 1963b, 1977, 
1978, 1982), and Rachel Laudan (1977; 1978, 1982, 1983, 1987, 1992). For more recent literature, see Carol Cleland 
(2001, 2002, 2009, 2011), Derek Turner (2005; 2007, 2013), and Alisa Bokulich (2013, 2018, 2020a, 2020c). 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY 
263 
 
implemented by both sides of the debate in rejecting or advocating for the stratigraphic significance of an 
Anthropocene Epoch/Series. The synchronic perspective assesses the present legitimacy and utility of 
formalizing the Anthropocene unit. This present-based perspective is grounded in a political standpoint: it 
asks whether ratifying the unit would be beneficial for the public in a way that “will convince the public 
and policy-makers that humans are having [a] significant effect on the environment” (p. 1088). 
 
The philosopher denies both that the Anthropocene Hypothesis holds sufficient arguments and 
stratigraphic evidence for formalizing an Anthropocene Epoch/Series; and that a ‘political’ recognition of 
the Anthropocene as a geological unit would result in increased public understanding and sympathy toward 
the environmental crisis. Concerning the former point, Santana holds that “extant geological changes don’t 
reach the thresholds necessary to define a new epoch, and predictions about the future are impossible given 
human capability to slow and reverse anthropogenic effects” (p. 1077). This argument draws on the future 
geologist perspective, which is separately analyzed in section 5.2.1.1. Concerning the latter point, Santana 
argues that “adopting the Anthropocene as a political tactic is unlikely to change perspectives on the 
environmental crisis, and may even make things worse” (p. 1090). This is particularly the case for climate 
deniers – an important social, cultural, and political obstacle in the resolution of environmental threats.253 
Santana’s thesis follows from three observations, namely, (1) recognition of the Anthropocene without a 
sufficient stratigraphic basis may fuel climate deniers’ “paranoia that the science they disagree with is driven 
by a liberal political agenda” (p. 1089); (2) extant work of climate denialism “casts serious doubts on the 
claim that we would change their minds by ratifying the Anthropocene” (ibid.); and (3) acknowledging 
publicly that humans have entered the ‘Anthropocene’ (as a concept or geological unit) “conveys no 
detailed, mechanistic facts about how humans affect the planet” (p. 1090). 
 
Santana’s contribution makes three valuable observations for delineating an epistemology of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
 
The first observation concerns the distinction between a Geological Claim and a Stratigraphic 
Claim. This distinction was advanced in section 3.1.1 to differentiate between humans as a geological force, 
and the stratigraphic footprint of humans. It was advanced that the latter was the claim underpinning the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis, whilst the former is an implicit assumption requiring a different theoretical 
ground for discussion. Santana (2019a) also recognizes this distinction, observing that “whether the 
Anthropocene should be designated a new epoch is not the same as asking whether humans are significant 
geological agents” (p. 1075). Intuitively, advocating for a geological time unit based on the actions of Homo 
sapiens requires the species to invest some degree of significance in its interaction with the natural world, 
upon which the species has been leaving its stratigraphic mark. Nevertheless, humans’ geological agency, 
whatever its degree, does not immediately translate into a claim for official recognition on the geological 
time scale.  
 
253 Santana addresses climate deniers as ‘climate skeptics.’ Here, the former designation is considered more suitable, 
as criticism raised by deniers does not exhibit skeptical means of inquiry as understood in traditional epistemology.  

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
264 
 
 
The second observation is also related to the epistemic identity of the hypothesis. Santana notes 
that “[t]he Anthropocene question runs deeper, involving both the kind of impact humans are having on the 
geological record, and the degree of that impact” (p. 1075, emphases added). Besides the author’s disagreement 
with claims advanced by the Anthropocene Hypothesis, he highlights two important aspects of epistemic 
significance in framing the hypothesis – namely, the kind and degree of impact that humans are having. The 
critical observations advanced by the author acknowledge the stratigraphic kind of the hypothesis. This is 
equivalent to Claim 1 – that is, ‘Homo sapiens has left a discernible stratigraphic signature of significant 
magnitude in recent geological history.’ Emphasizing the stratigraphic nature of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis (regardless of one’s personal stance on its claims) in light of the kind of impact humans are 
leaving is a basic epistemic characteristic of the hypothesis. It serves to distinguish it from other variants of 
the ‘Anthropocene,’ but also to delimit the epistemological domain wherein the hypothesis is situated (i.e., 
stratigraphic classification). The degree of impact relates to the appropriate translation into a stratigraphic 
vocabulary of the human stratigraphic footprint. The Anthropocene Hypothesis holds that that this degree 
of impact could be translated into a unit of geological time (Claim 2), and more precisely as a 
geochronological/chronostratigraphic epoch/series (Claim 3). Determining the stratigraphic kind and 
degree of human impact are fundamental heuristics engendering the epistemology of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. 
 
The third observation concerns the epistemological nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a 
historical hypothesis. Santana holds that “[i]deally, stratigraphers would apply [a] similar [stratigraphic] 
methodology to identifying a possible Anthropocene, but since we’re contemporaneous with the proposed 
epoch, we can’t” (p. 1076). This assumption leads the philosopher to infer that the stratigraphic legitimacy 
of the Anthropocene can be assessed, on stratigraphic grounds, only from a viewpoint of a future 
geologist.254 He argues that “[a]sking such a question is a radical shift for a historical science like geology, 
because it requires the historical science to become a science of prediction; to tell us not about what 
happened thousands or millions of years ago, but to tell us what the Earth will look like thousands or 
millions of years from now” (ibid.). In Santana’s account, the Anthropocene Hypothesis would represent a 
predictive rather than historical hypothesis. However, Anthropocene researchers have noted that sufficient 
stratigraphic evidence already exists, and can be documented widely in geological archives (Waters et al., 
2016; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019a; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b; Zalasiewicz et al., 2017b). If this is the case, the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis can still be treated as a historical hypothesis. This has implications for determining 
the epistemology of the hypothesis because historical hypotheses differ from predictive or experimental 
hypotheses in a number of ways, as later discussed in section 4.2.1. 
 
254 He also quotes geologist Eric Wolff (2014) in his contribution to the special publication of the Geological Society 
of London’s A Stratigraphical Basis for the Anthropocene (Waters et al., 2014a). The geologist wrote that the idea of 
formalizing an Anthropocene Epoch/Series “has to be considered from the viewpoint of a geologist viewing 
sequences thousands or millions of years in the future” (Wolff, 2014, p. 255, quoted in Santana, 2019a, p. 1076). 
However, the argument that being contemporaneous to the proposed epoch does not allow to use traditional 
stratigraphic methodologies does not seem to hold. Indeed, the AWG has been making extensive use of stratigraphic 
principles and methods (see section 3.1) to define and characterize the Anthropocene as a stratigraphic unit from a 
present perspective. 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY

The second contribution is Jay Foster’s (2018) “Let’s Not Talk About the Anthropocene,” 
published in a volume of Analecta Hermeneutica dedicated to the ‘Anthropocene.’ Whilst hermeneutics (the 
focus of the journal) is not traditionally understood as a branch of (nor a discipline close to) philosophy of 
science, Foster draws on literature from that field and advances arguments that could easily be considered 
to fall within the spectrum of philosophy of science. Thus, his contribution can be used as an example of 
engagement from the philosophy of science with the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Foster draws on preexisting work from Chakrabarty (2009) and Bruno Latour (2015) on the 
meaning and nature of the ‘Anthropocene’ in terms of human exceptionality. He argues that “[a]ssumptions 
and claims about human exceptionality are at work even in formal discussions of the Anthropocene carried 
out largely in the scientific community. […] [T]hese assumptions are often implicit in the discussions and 
debates that are focused on evaluating the Anthropocene as a formal geological unit” (Foster, 2018, p. 4). 
This process of evaluation, the philosopher observes, is deeply nominalistic. It is based on a voting 
procedure among AWG members deliberating over whether the Anthropocene (as a geological time unit) 
is stratigraphically real, if it should be formalized, what hierarchical level it should be assigned, when its 
beginning should be placed, what method should be used to place its beginning (i.e., GSSP or GSSA), and 
what best represents its primary marker.255 These votes are “quite literally voting for, or better nominating, 
an essence for a category” (p. 12). 
 
The idea of nominating an essence for a category draws explicitly on the work of 17th-century 
philosopher John Locke, who distinguished between real essence (what makes something what it is) and 
nominal essence (the conventional and abstract idea of shared similarities among objects). Foster 
implements this distinction (also through the work of philosopher and nominalist Nelson Goodman) by 
arguing that “members of the Anthropocene group are engaged in a process of evaluating the ways in which 
the Anthropocene is a ‘relevant kind’ not whether it is a natural kind” (p. 15). A ‘relevant kind’ is the 
conventional organization of knowledge according to that particular knowledge system, whereas a ‘natural 
kind’ is a “grouping that reflects the structure of the natural world rather than the interests and actions of 
human beings” (Bird & Tobin, 2018). To ensure that the Anthropocene represents a relevant kind, the 
AWG must “strike a balance between showing that the Anthropocene fits within established practices of 
geochronology and making a case for ‘evolving tradition’ to accommodate the new era” (Foster, 2018, p. 
15). This requires debating the practices of stratigraphy and geochronology. 
 
Among the variety of criteria used to establish geological time units, Foster locates three epistemic 
requirements the Anthropocene time unit must meet – namely, it must be manifest, persistent, and salient. The 
author considers being manifest the “easiest and least controversial of the three conditions” (p. 17). This is 
because of the wide spectrum of well-documented anthropogenic alterations of the Earth. A more difficult 
task is assessing which among this large pool of manifested anthropogenic signals will be persistent after a 
geologically relevant period of time. This is a similar line of inquiry as the one advanced by Santana (2019a) 
 
255 The specific questions and their voting results are exposed in Zalasiewicz et al. (2017a), which is based on a 
presentation held on occasion of the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa, on August 
29, 2016. 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
266 
 
concerning the epistemic shift from historical to predictive science that the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
seemingly entails. Foster (2018) notes that “evaluating the persistence of a rock signal clearly involves much 
more guesswork than establishing that a signal is manifest” (p. 18). This is because it is largely uncertain 
what signals will survive in a geologically distant future, leaving the question of the persistence of the 
Anthropocene unit open. Lastly, being salient faces the issue of “explaining why geological changes made 
by the human species are to be marked in geochronology while enormous changes produced by other 
species are not” (p. 20). This is especially the case, for instance, in light of the enormous impact that 
cyanobacteria had in creating an oxygen-rich atmosphere, but also in the evolution of plants and complex 
life (a line of critique also advanced by Finney & Edwards, 2016). If such large-scale and geologically 
significant events were not used to demarcate the beginning of a “Cyanobacteriocene” or 
“Seedlessvascularplantocene” (Foster, 2018, pp. 22–23), then it seems that an Anthropocene does not 
satisfy salience as a necessary epistemic requirement. 
 
Additionally, Foster argues that the naming choice of ‘Anthropocene’ breaks with the spirit of 
geochronological nomenclature by naming the causes (i.e., anthropos) rather than the effects. This nominalistic 
observation “is indicative of a more general propensity in the Anthropocene literature” (p. 25) in 
emphasizing human exceptionality at the expense of a variety of non-human species that “ongoingly change 
the Earth system – indeed, very plausibly maintain homeostatic states of the Earth system – at various 
scales and levels” (p. 27). Human exceptionality in the ‘Anthropocene’ concept is further reinforced by 
claims of the self-awareness and self-consciousness of human beings – the only species aware of their own 
impact on the Earth System. For Foster, this is a Cartesian approach that places humans in an 
unprecedented state of exceptionality, reversing Freud’s reading of the history of science (i.e., the self-
inflicted wounds to narcissism) by once again separating the ‘exceptional human’ from the rest of nature. 
 
Based on seemingly epistemic deficiencies and implicit claims of human exceptionality, Foster 
concludes that is best to “not talk about the Anthropocene” (p. 37). From a philosophy of science 
viewpoint, this is a peculiar conclusion, as the discipline has barely talked about the ‘Anthropocene’ (and 
less the Anthropocene Hypothesis) in the first place. 
 
The author’s critical analysis provides interesting insight into the perception of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis in philosophy. Similar to Santana (2019a), he identifies several issues with formally recognizing 
an Anthropocene unit. Some of these issues pertain to the epistemology of stratigraphy – such as the 
requirement of geological units to be manifest, persistent, and salient. Others pertain to the nominalistic 
nature of the term ‘Anthropocene,’ and the implicit anthropocentric remarks that the term entails, while 
also breaking with the traditional nomenclature praxis. Further issues relate to the broader portrayal that 
‘Anthropocene’ literature has given of the proposed epoch, reminiscent of Cartesian dualism and a Hegelian 
type of history. Besides the author’s personal take on the ‘Anthropocene’ debates, what emerges is a picture 
of a scientific hypothesis (i.e., the Anthropocene Hypothesis) requiring further consideration concerning 
the epistemological requirement it needs to meet in order to advocate for formal recognition of an 
Anthropocene time unit. If, however, further considerations are required – for instance, by envisioning the 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY 
267 
 
utility of an Anthropocene Epoch among the geoscientific community – then it is recommended, if not 
necessary, to talk about the Anthropocene Hypothesis from a philosophical viewpoint. It is paramount for 
developing a discrete analysis of the hypothesis, and for dissecting the epistemic contexts, virtues, and 
requirements engendering it. This is only possible, au contraire, by talking about the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
The third and last contribution hereby discussed is a short paper entitled “Revamping the Image 
of Science for the Anthropocene,” authored by philosophers Andrew Inkpen and Tyler DesRoches (2019) 
and published in Philosophy Theory and Practice in Biology. The authors do not probe into the epistemology of 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Rather, they reconsider the image of science given the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
The philosophers recognize that the “Anthropocene has become a uniquely powerful destabilizing 
force, and thus offers novel opportunities for rethinking science’s image” (p. 2). This image of science “is 
usually described in disciplinary terms” (ibid.) similarly associated with the Kuhnian picture of ‘normal’ 
science. Kuhn (2012) famously understood scientific change in terms of paradigm shifts. Any mature 
science evolves256 through phases of normal science and revolutionary or extraordinary science. During 
periods of normal science, an existing ‘paradigm’ dictates the methods and practices of science, providing 
puzzle-solution power to existing scientific questions. However, an existing paradigm may not provide 
solutions to one or more encountered problems or ‘anomalies,’ and thus those anomalies become 
untreatable by the existing paradigm. When this happens, scientific consensus over the paradigm is 
shattered, and a period of crisis follows. During this phase of revolutionary science, fundamentals (either 
conceptual or methodological) are questioned, alternatives research strategies are pursued, and multiple 
coexisting paradigms emerge. Among these competing paradigms, one (and only one) emerges as the most 
suited to provide solutions to the anomalies the science is facing. The paradigm shift that follows 
reestablishes a new phase of normal science, where the epistemological boundaries (i.e., methods and 
objects of research) of a discipline are (re)affirmed. 
Inkpen and DesRoches (2019) suggest that a discipline-based image of science is no longer tenable 
in the ‘Anthropocene,’ and that three issues underpin any characterization of the new ‘normal’ science in 
the ‘Anthropocene.’ The first issue is the fact that a new ontology requires a new epistemology. The 
‘Anthropocene’ does not solely “proclaim an abrupt and irreversible departure from the Holocene, it [also] 
posits an intermingling of the human and the non-human in systems at every scale” (p. 2). Despite this, the 
epistemological consequences of the new ontology brought about by the ‘Anthropocene’ are not yet fully 
appreciated in extant debates on science. The authors observe that “current debates over Anthropocene 
science leave unanalyzed the relation between the ubiquity of human-natural systems and current 
methodological standards – between what the world is like and how it should be studied” (p. 3). 
 
256 The term ‘evolved’ is not chosen by chance. Kuhn himself argued that “[t]he analogy that relates the evolution of 
organisms to the evolution of scientific ideas can easily be pushed too far. But with respect to the issues of this closing 
section [XIII, Progress through Revolution] it is very neatly perfect” (Kuhn, 2012, p. 171). By his account, competing 
paradigms are selected based on the fitness of their puzzle-solution power (for a Darwinian reading of Kuhn, see 
Paksi, 2007). 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
268 
 
The second issue concerns the boundary between descriptive and normative in science. The 
authors state that “[s]cience in the Anthropocene will increasingly involve discussions that inextricably link 
the normative and the scientific, where questions of how and what we should study imply questions of 
value” (ibid.). Indeed, this has been the case with discussions on the broader societal implications of 
formalizing an Anthropocene time unit, and the meaning of selecting a starting date (e.g., the Neolithic 
Revolution, the Columbian Exchange, the Industrial Revolution, etc.). In this framework, “Anthropocene 
science is not and cannot be divorced from social values” (p. 4), and will require scientists to cooperate 
with humanists and social scientists in dealing with a concept fraught with normative as well as descriptive 
value. 
The third issue pertains to the promotion of mechanisms of interdisciplinarity. This is a particularly 
relevant issue at the core of Anthropocene Studies (Toivanen et al., 2017). It is also a general academic 
burden, as interdisciplinary research has seen consistently lower funding success than disciplinary-based 
research (Bromham et al., 2016). Inkpen and DesRoches (2019) identify some of the issues hindering 
interdisciplinary research, such as the fact that “the norms governing its success are less codified than 
intradisciplinary work; tensions arising from the distinct goals of researchers from different disciplines 
hinders collaboration; ingrained cultural hierarchies privilege some sciences over others; and institutional 
features of funding structures” (p. 4). 
In Inkpen and DesRoches (2019), the ‘Anthropocene’ works as a cardinal concept in promoting a 
new image of science – one that overcomes traditional disciplinary boundaries as conceived both by 
philosophers of science and by institutions. Their analysis hints at the epistemic potential inherent in the 
term, without probing into the particular epistemic challenges and requirements the stratigraphic 
formulation of the ‘Anthropocene’ is facing. This epistemic potential is reflected in important aspects of 
Anthropocene Studies – for instance, in the spectrum of disciplines that have engaged with the 
‘Anthropocene,’ or in the multidisciplinary composition of the AWG. As such, the contribution also gives 
rise to possible research trajectories; it anticipates a new model, meaning, and purpose of ‘science’ and, 
consequently, reframes much of the traditional discourse within the philosophy of science. 
The three contributions analyzed here provide a springboard for possible research trajectories in 
philosophy of science concerning the Anthropocene Hypothesis. They do not exemplify extant scholarship 
within this domain – primarily because not enough scholarship exists for them to exemplify anything. 
Nevertheless, some themes of interest emerge from these rare approaches toward the ‘Anthropocene’ and 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
First, both Santana (2019a) and Foster (2018) are critical of the hypothesis. They both find the 
epistemic requirements necessary to validate the Anthropocene as a unit of geological time to be 
insufficient. This criticism is paralleled to an interpretation of the principles of stratigraphic classification. 
This may feasibly be understood as work in the philosophy of geology, and more precisely the philosophy 
of stratigraphy. Second, both authors identify a crucial temporal tension between geological past and 
geological future underpinning the arguments advanced by the Anthropocene Hypothesis. In Santana 

THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ IN PHILOSOPHY 
269 
 
(2019a), this is evident in the future geologist perspective, which he considers a necessary perspective to 
adopt when assessing the stratigraphic validity of the Anthropocene as a time unit. In Foster (2018), the 
persistence of extant anthropogenic signals in future geological records is regarded as a key epistemic factor 
for the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Third, the ‘Anthropocene’ as a broader metaphor for global change 
raises issues concerning scientific knowledge, and the meaning of science itself. While Santana (2019a) and 
Foster (2018) consider anomalies in naming, in the potential persistence of anthropogenic records, in 
adherence to stratigraphic classification, and in salience as an epistemic deficiency, a certain reading of 
Inkpen and DesRoches (2019) may help interpret these as early signs of an image and praxis of science that 
is changing. These aspects still remain to be thoroughly examined in philosophical discourses on science, 
and therefore remain open questions.
 
 
4.2 The Anthropocene Hypothesis as a Scientific Hypothesis 
 
 
A central goal of this research is discussing the implications of considering the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
a scientific hypothesis, and more precisely a stratigraphic hypothesis. Defining the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
as such is not solely useful in separating it conceptually from the ‘Anthropocene,’ but it also suggests that 
it can be approached as an object of philosophical, and specifically epistemological, interest.  
 
But what is a scientific hypothesis? And what kind of scientific hypothesis does the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis represent?  
Broadly understood, a scientific hypothesis is a proposed scientific explanation of one or more 
phenomena in the natural world that attempts to successfully deliver a form of cognitive success via scientific 
understanding. Scientific hypotheses are not isolated and atemporal theoretical entities. They are shared by 
small or large groups of individuals in a historically situated system of intellectual and cultural knowledge 
(Renn, 2020), providing (or attempting to provide) “satisfactory solutions to important problems” (L. 
Laudan, 1977, p. 13) within specific disciplinary domains. Scientific hypotheses differ within sciences based 
on varying epistemic goals and methods behind their aim and formulation (e.g., statistical hypotheses, 
logical hypotheses, experimental hypotheses, historical hypotheses, etc.), meaning that multiple types of 
scientific hypotheses exist. 
This extremely condensed and ready-made definition highlights three structural aspects of scientific 
hypotheses – namely, explanation, understanding, and type of scientific hypothesis. Each of these epistemic 
aspects is defined as scientific (at the cost of being repetitive). This is necessary to delimit the scope of a 
scientific hypothesis, and of the analysis hereby conducted on the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Extant 
epistemological scholarship agrees virtually unanimously that not every knowledge type that explains and 
delivers understanding is scientific. This is equivalent to saying that epistemic virtues such as explanatory 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
270 
 
power, usefulness, or intelligibility are not characteristics exclusive of science. However, philosophers of 
science generally agree that these aspects are epistemic virtues characterizing scientific knowledge, or that 
scientific knowledge ought to pursue. They are basic desiderata,257 and as such, require some consideration 
if the Anthropocene Hypothesis is to be recognized as a scientific hypothesis. 
Therefore, section 4.2.1 articulates what type of scientific hypothesis the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
represents. The research has multiple times stressed the stratigraphic nature of the hypothesis. Beyond 
delimiting the disciplinary and epistemic domain, this designation is also useful to frame the hypothesis in 
epistemological terms. Indeed, the nature and formulation of the hypothesis makes it a historical hypothesis, 
meaning that a certain set of epistemic properties and challenges commonly attributed to historical research 
should reflect the form and content of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Subsequently, section 4.2.2 
determines how (if at all) the hypothesis entails any explanatory power. This is done by surveying three 
main models of scientific explanation developed in philosophy of science literature. Then, section 4.2.3 
discusses the intelligibility of the hypothesis in light of recent models emphasizing the value of scientific 
understanding for scientific knowledge (de Regt, 2017, 2020; de Regt & Dieks, 2005; de Regt et al., 2009). 
Lastly, section 4.2.4 advances some remarks over a broader social and historical importance considered 
useful in framing further analyses of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
4.2.1 Historical Hypotheses 
 
Hypotheses differ in the way they are formulated within science. In particular, some disciplines formulate 
hypotheses about past events and phenomena. Philosopher Carol Cleland (2001) addresses these disciplines 
as historical sciences, characterized by “hypotheses that postulate particular past causes for currently observable 
phenomena” (2001, p. 987). Historical sciences differ from experimental and predictive sciences (such as 
physics) because the “main emphasis is on analyzing and sharpening traces [emphasis added] so that they 
can be identified and properly interpreted” (p. 989). Stratigraphy is an example of historical science: it seeks 
to reconstruct a meaningful timeline of the history of the Earth based on available ‘traces’ in rocks and 
strata. It does not seek to predict the geological future of the Earth, and it does not reproduce past events 
(e.g., the extinction of most dinosaurs at 66 Ma) in a laboratory setting, but it reconstructs them.258 Historical 
hypotheses are tested against available traces, rather than against future results. Ultimately, since effects 
 
257 It is intuitive to understand why some of these virtues are desiderata in science. It is unlikely that any hypothesis that 
does not explain has any scientific value. Any hypothesis that fails in delivering scientific understanding of some 
phenomena seems to undermine one of the very purposes of science – that is, understanding things scientifically.  
258 This epistemological aspect has raised criticism among the ranks of more ‘rigorous’ scientists who claim that “[n]o 
science can ever be historical” (Gee, 1999, p. 8, quoted in Cleland, 2001, p. 987) – a statement echoing Rutherford’s 
notorious claim on science as physics. Experimental sciences have been perceived as ‘superior’ to historical sciences 
because of their (predictive) ability to test and verify/falsify hypotheses – as testified by the perception of physics as 
exemplar science. Additionally, the claim of ‘superiority’ seemed to find philosophical justification in both 
verificationism (Baconian inductivism and logical empiricism) and falsificationism (Popper), where hypotheses need 
to be empirically verifiable or falsifiable in principle to be considered scientific. This point also raised concerns as to 
whether Popper’s falsificationism would rule out historical sciences from science (Moharir, 1993). 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
271 
 
often overdetermine their causes,259 the major challenge of the historical sciences is finding a ‘smoking gun,’ 
namely, “a trace(s) that unambiguously discriminates one hypothesis from among a set of currently available 
hypotheses as providing “the best explanation” of the traces thus far observed” (Cleland, 2002, p. 481).260  
 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis seems to exhibit epistemic traits common to historical hypotheses 
by (1) focusing on past events,261 (2) emphasizing ‘traces’ (Cleland, 2001) as anthropogenic signals, and (3) 
requiring a ‘smoking gun’ (Cleland, 2002) as the global and synchronous signals for a GSSP. Indeed, the 
hypothesis seeks to explain anthropogenic signatures left in the stratigraphic record in a way that is useful 
for geological research.  
 
Furthermore, historical hypotheses seek to “explain puzzling associations among traces discovered 
through fieldwork” (Cleland, 2011, p. 552), and are accepted or rejected based on their explanatory power 
(in addition to other epistemic and social variables). They differ from experimental hypotheses because their 
explanatory power does not coincide with their predictive power. The equation between predictive and 
explanatory power has been central in much philosophical literature on science influenced by physics during 
the 20th century. This resulted in experimental sciences, and thus predictive sciences, being “held up as the 
paradigm of successful (a.k.a. good) science” (Cleland, 2002, p. 474). Historical hypotheses do not aim at 
predicting certain phenomena; rather, they seek to explain past phenomena. In philosophical terms, they 
provide historical explanation, and thus deliver historical understanding of certain past phenomena. Since the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis constitutes a historical hypothesis, it thus provides a type of explanation and 
understanding that is historical. 
 
As such, the Anthropocene Hypothesis is an example of historical research262: it attempts to 
reconstruct a meaningful chronology of past successions of events. Examples of historical forms of research 
commonly occur in disciplines such as archaeology, paleontology, historical geology, and history, where 
 
259 According to philosopher David Lewis (1979), a ‘fact’ in a deterministic world is determined by some causes when 
“a minimal set of conditions [is] jointly sufficient, given the laws of nature, for [explaining] the fact in question. 
(Members of such a set may be causes of the fact, or traces of it, or neither)” (p. 474). Whenever two or more different 
determinants are available for a fact, each sufficient by itself to explain it, then the fact is said to be overdetermined. 
Conversely, when the available determinants are not by themselves sufficient for explaining a fact, then the fact is said 
to be underdetermined. Cleland borrows Lewis’s notion of ‘asymmetry of overdetermination’ to expand on the 
differences between historical and experimental hypotheses, upon which she believes they are founded (differently 
from Lewis, in probabilistic rather than deterministic terms). The ‘asymmetry of overdetermination’ is the condition 
where “most localized events overdetermine their past causes (because the latter typically leave extensive and diverse 
effects) and underdetermine their future effects (because they rarely constitute the total cause of an effect)” (Cleland, 
2011, p. 570). 
260 A ‘smoking gun’ can be understood as the historical counterpart of the ‘crucial experiment’ of experimental 
sciences. The ‘smoking gun’ thesis has been criticized by Forber and Griffith (2011), whilst Cleland’s (2011) use of 
Lewis’s asymmetry of overdetermination to justify the underlying epistemological equality between historical and 
experimental sciences is also criticized by Turner (2005; 2007). The latter also considers local underdetermination a 
bigger issue in historical sciences than experimental science, hence rejecting Cleland’s thesis that the two science 
clusters hold equal epistemic value. It is neither true, Turner argues, that “earlier causes are usually, or even very often 
epistemically overdetermined by their effects” (Turner, 2007, p. 45). 
261 Despite being extremely recent from a geological viewpoint, the anthropogenic markers considered to characterize 
and define an Anthropocene unit are still located in the past. 
262 Cleland (2001, 2002, 2011) distinguishes between historical sciences and experimental sciences rather than research. 
However, because sciences such as geology or astronomy entail both historical and experimental aspects or 
hypotheses, differentiation at the research level is considered more suitable for framing the present discussion. 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
272 
 
hypotheses explaining past events are formulated based on available evidence. The Big Bang theory, the 
evolutionary lineage of Homo sapiens, and the Alvarez Hypothesis are examples of historical 
theories/hypotheses. Historical research seems generally different in method and object of research from 
experimental research, mostly conducted in disciplines such as physics, biology, and chemistry, where 
hypotheses are tested through experiments (often in high-control laboratory conditions) and predictions 
about future outcomes are made (although historical aspects are not utterly absent from these research 
fields). General relativity, Boyle’s gas law, and conditioning experiments in psychology are examples of 
experimental theories or laws that can be tested and reproduced in laboratory settings by conducting 
experiments or by making predictions regarding some future phenomena based on certain premises. 
 
But what does it mean for the Anthropocene Hypothesis to be a historical hypothesis? Before 
tackling this question, a terminological elucidation is due. 
 
The term ‘historical’ is invested with particular significance in Anthropocene Studies. This is 
because, first, as observed in section 1.2, the ambiguity of the phrase ‘history of the Anthropocene’ opens 
up into different research trajectories on the ‘Anthropocene’ as an Earth System singularity, geological time 
unit, historical period, and term/idea. Second, the starting date currently located by the AWG around the 
1950s makes the beginning of the Anthropocene an object of interest both to history (in its historiographic 
sense) and geohistory. Third, the lack of a sound historical dimension entailed in the term ‘Anthropocene’ 
has been a major source of criticism toward the term and the hypothesis. These facts may generate 
confusion over the meaning and status of the designation historical hereby ascribed to the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis.  
 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis is not a historical hypothesis in terms of ‘human history.’ Being 
‘historical’ is an epistemological attribute: its knowledge claims concern past events whose traces (viz., 
anthropogenic signatures) are explained based on available evidence. Such epistemology is highly complex, 
and faces multiple types of uncertainties. As Kitts (1978) noted, “[s]tatements about the geologic past are 
generated within an immensely complicated inferential context” (p. 218) – reflected by the complexity of 
reconstructing, either empirically or theoretically, events or states that extend from hundreds of thousands 
to billions of years in the past. 
 
Forber and Griffith (2011) go deeper into some of the challenges posed by historical reconstruction 
– the most prominent being the ‘the problem of access.’ This issue concerns the uniqueness of historical 
events, which does not allow for certain past phenomena or events to be observed or reproduced in 
laboratory settings. In turn, this generates underdetermination problems263 that are particularly challenging 
for historical sciences. Although underdetermination is a common issue across all sciences, historical 
disciplines are bound to further problems that exacerbate underdetermination, such as the disturbance of 
available traces from heterogenous causes, the limited patterns of regularity observable (or supposed) in 
available data, or the action of “information-destroying processes” (2011, p. 2) – namely, processes that

hypotheses. 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
273 
 
erase traces of particular importance for historical reconstructions. The authors reject Cleland’s (2001, 2002, 
2011) notion of ‘smoking gun’ as a solution for discriminating among competing historical hypotheses, 
which they consider to primarily depend on historical and sociological contexts. Rather, they argue that 
“the main source of epistemic support in historical investigations comes from the consilience [emphasis 
added] of multiple independent lines of evidence on the chronology or key quantitative properties integral 
to causal history” (Forber & Griffith, 2011, p. 3). Consilience, they argue (by using the Cretaceous–
Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction boundary as a case study), is better equipped to test a hypothesis against 
issues of underdetermination as well as holism (i.e., the Duhem-Quine Thesis).264  
 
But what is exactly ‘consilience’? Broadly defined, a theory or hypothesis is said to be consilient if 
it is able to explain (i.e., if it is supported by) multiple independent lines of evidence. While the term is 
evocative of Edward O. Wilson’s ideal of unity of science, its use in philosophy of science is often dated to 
William Whewell (1794–1866), a polymath figure of importance in the history and philosophy of science 
(he is often attributed the coinage of the term ‘scientist’). In his first volume of The Philosophy of the Inductive 
Sciences, Whewell (1840a) argued that “The Consilience of Inductions take place when an Induction obtained 
from one class of facts, coincides with an Induction, obtained from another different class. This consilience 
is a test of the truth of the Theory in which it occurs” (1840a, pp. xxxix, XIV, also quoted in L. Laudan, 
1971, and Bokulich, 2020). A second definition with examples is given in his second volume: 
 
Accordingly the cases in which inductions from classes of facts altogether different have thus jumped 
together, belong only to the best established theories which the history of science contains. And as I 
shall have occasion to refer to this peculiar feature in their evidence, I will take the liberty of 
describing it by a particular phrase; and will term it Consilience of Inductions […] The theory of universal 
gravitation, and of the undulatory theory of light, are, indeed, full of examples of this Consilience 
of Inductions. (Whewell, 1840b, pp. 230, 232) 
 
Apparently, consilience was a “commonly held” (Ruse, 1978, p. 249) topic of discussion about sciences 
during the 1970s, when discussions about different reasoning patterns among the sciences began to emerge 
(for instance, Laudan, 1971). As more recently highlighted by Bokulich (2020a), what is epistemically 
interesting about consilience is that it is not just a product of agreement about any evidence. 
Underdetermination, testing holism, and observational biases would still represent substantial problems 
when assembling different evidence in support of a hypothesis. Rather, it is the independency of separate 
evidential lines and their unlikely convergence that provide support for a consilient hypothesis: “The greater 
the degree of independence (in respects that are relevant) of these evidential lines, the more unlikely it is 
that they would converge apart from H [H being any given hypothesis] being true, of independence (in 
respects that are relevant) of these evidential lines” (p. 435). Consilient hypotheses are particularly relevant 
 
264 The Duhem-Quine Thesis, named after French physicist Pierre Duhem (1861–1916) and American philosopher 
William van Orman Quine (1908–2000), is one of the major problems in the scientific theory of knowledge. As 
formulated by Quine (2003), “[s]ometimes also an experience implied by a theory fails to come off; and then, ideally, 
we declare the theory false. But the failure falsifies only a block of theory as a whole, a conjunction of many statements. 
The failure shows that one or more of those statements is false, but it does not show which” (p. 335).

in the discussion of past events, and are commonly held in disciplines such as geochronology, archaeology, 
and evolutionary biology. In the context of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, different stratigraphic evidence 
(e.g., lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, etc.) can be interpreted as independent lines of evidence. This is 
further corroborated by extra-stratigraphic lines of evidence independent from one another – from Earth 
System science and environmental history to oceanography and environmental studies. While their 
convergence may not seem unlikely (i.e., being caused by humans), consilience occurs in the widely 
documented array of anthropogenic impacts, some of which may be translatable into stratigraphic terms. 
 
To consider the Anthropocene Hypothesis a historical hypothesis means ascribing to it a set of 
epistemic qualities common in historical explanations of past phenomena. Cleland (2002) delineates a 
prototypical epistemology of the evidential reasoning applied in historical research (which she contraposes 
to experimental research): 
 
In the prototypical scenario, an investigator observes puzzling traces (effects) of long-past events. 
Hypotheses are formulated to explain them. The hypotheses explain the traces by postulating a 
common cause for them. Thus the hypotheses of prototypical historical science differ from those 
of classical experimental science insofar as they are concerned with event-tokens instead of 
regularities among event-types. […] [I]t is hardly surprising that historical explanations often have 
the character of stories that, lacking reference to specific generalizations, seem inherently untestable. 
Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to conclude that hypotheses about the remote past can’t be 
‘tested.’ (p. 480) 
 
 
Two considerations are drawn from this prototypical scenario.  
 
A first consideration concerns the meaning of ‘long-past events.’ Being long-past seems to 
represent a structural feature about historical conjectures in Cleland’s (2011) account. The ‘Anthropocene’ 
does not represent a long-past event, especially when compared to the temporal length of other geological 
time units. In fact, it represents a very recent265 event whose ontology is yet to completely unfold. This is a 
major epistemic peculiarity (and source of criticism) of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, in that the hypothesis 
seems to rather easily overcome traditional epistemic challenges of historical reconstruction – such as the 
search for a ‘smoking gun.’ Indeed, both the cause (Homo sapiens) and the effects (stratigraphic records) of 
the proposed epoch and its beginning are extensively documented, although precision and accuracy – two 
central epistemic factors in geochronology (Schoene et al., 2013) – are still not easy epistemic parameters 
to obtain in terms of defining the stratigraphic properties of the Anthropocene via core samples (Waters et 
al., 2018). 
 
Being a very recent time unit does not immediately rule out the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a 
historical hypothesis.266 Firstly, because time-depth is a function of traces and event-tokens rather than a 
 
265 Being ‘very recent’ is a relative epistemic property (just like an event being ‘long-past’) determined through 
comparison to other evidence used in geochronological and chronostratigraphic research. In fact, this is a major point 
of discussion within the scientific debate over the Anthropocene Hypothesis (see section 5.2.1). 
266 This statement diverges from Santana’s (2019a). The philosopher holds that, because we are contemporaneous to 
the proposed Anthropocene unit, we must consider the stratigraphic legitimacy of the Anthropocene from a future 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
275 
 
discriminatory epistemic quality per se (i.e., the older the event, the lower the traces and event-tokens). What 
makes an explanation historical is not time-depth, but rather the presence of traces with which the 
explanation of past causes is attempted. Secondly, time-depth is related to Cleland’s (2002) conception of 
a ‘smoking gun’ – namely, “a trace(s) that unambiguously discriminates one hypothesis from among a set 
of currently available hypotheses as providing ‘the best explanation’ of the traces thus far observed” (p. 
481). Retrieving a smoking gun is considered the goal of historical research, and “successful historical 
hypotheses explain traces by unifying them under a consistent causal story” (p. 482). The iridium-rich layer at 
the K-T boundary is an example of a smoking gun in support of the Alvarez Hypothesis. However, in the 
case of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, the search for a smoking gun is not a primary concern, in that the 
causal story behind the set of (anthropogenic) traces is already known from a stratigraphic viewpoint (i.e., 
Homo sapiens).267 Once again, this is due to the recent nature of the proposed Anthropocene lower boundary. 
Thus, the Anthropocene Hypothesis is a historical hypothesis despite not dealing with long-past events. 
A second consideration concerns the nature of the traces of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a 
historical hypothesis, and how these traces relate to ‘testing’ the hypothesis in a historical sense. It is a 
textbook assumption in scientific literature, as well as literature about science, that scientific hypotheses 
need to be testable (or falsifiable) in principle to be considered scientific (in addition to other epistemic 
requirements, such as sufficient empirical adequacy and logical consistency). Thus, to claim the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis represents a scientific hypothesis means somehow that it can be tested. This 
requires that at least one of its core claims should be testable. 
Anthropogenic signals in the stratigraphic record define the empirical body in support of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. In terms set by Cleland (2002), this stratigraphic record contains the traces that 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis seeks to explain and understand. The hypothesis identifies a common cause 
for these traces – that is, Homo sapiens. For Cleland, “[t]races provide evidence for past events just as 
successful predictions provide evidence for the generalizations examined in the lab” (p. 480). This implies 
that anthropogenic signals in stratigraphic records provide evidence for the Anthropocene Hypothesis in a 
way that the hypothesis is tested (in a historical sense) against this evidence. But how is the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis tested, and what about it is being tested? From an epistemological standpoint, Claim 1 (‘Homo 
sapiens has left a discernible stratigraphic signature of significant magnitude in recent geological history’) is 
the claim implicitly being directly tested. Indeed, Claim 1 is true if (1) substantial evidence of a recognized 
stratigraphic nature is retrieved from within the epistemic framework of stratigraphic evidence, and (2) if 
 
geologist perspective. This leads him to infer that the Anthropocene Hypothesis is a prediction rather than a historical 
reconstruction (“Would that future geologist see justification for driving a golden spike into a rock layer that was 
formed around the twentieth century? Asking such a question is a radical shift for a historical science like geology, 
because it requires the historical science to become a science of prediction,” p. 1076). However, since a lower boundary 
has been located in the past rather than the future, the Anthropocene Hypothesis can still be considered a historical 
hypothesis, despite its extremely short geological span. If the Anthropocene Hypothesis raised the question “Will 
there be a marked pool of stratigraphically significant anthropogenic signals in the future?”, then the hypothesis could 
be considered a predictive (rather than historical) hypothesis. 
267 A different discussion is required if the smoking gun is considered the earliest globally synchronous signal(s) of 
anthropogenic alteration of the Earth System. This discussion has been advanced in section 3.2 when surveying 
alternative and competing Anthropocene hypotheses. 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
276 
 
Homo sapiens (rather than any other species or natural event) is the cause of this stratigraphic signature. The 
fact that the evidence has to be recognized explicitly acknowledges the social dimension of stratigraphic 
evidence. 
 
Claim 1 does not merely seek social recognition: it advocates for the very existence of such traces, 
regardless of further claims of formal recognition on the geological time scale. Additionally, it does not aim 
to assess whether anthropogenic signals support further claims of formal ratification on the geological time 
scale. Claim 2 (‘The stratigraphic signature left by Homo sapiens could be translated into a geochronological 
and chronostratigraphic unit of time’) and Claim 3 (‘The proper unit level reflecting the magnitude of the 
stratigraphic signature of Homo sapiens on the geological time scale and international chronostratigraphic 
chart is that of epoch/series’) aim to do so, and thus they do not require any similar testing because they 
relate to the theoretical organization of knowledge about the Earth which, while grounded on empirical 
evidence, is mostly pragmatic and socially dependent. Rather, Claim 1 aims to (1) consider these traces as 
stratigraphic evidence, and (2) consider Homo sapiens as the causal agent behind the existence of these traces. 
Both these claims can be empirically verified (or falsified), so that only Claim 1 is testable – meaning that 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis overall is testable. 
 
Therefore, to test the Anthropocene Hypothesis (in its entirety) means first to assess whether there 
is any such thing as stratigraphic evidence of anthropogenic signals. If this happens to be the case (meaning 
that the empirical aspect of the hypothesis is verified), then Claim 1 is true. If this is not the case, then the 
hypothesis is falsified.268 If Claim 1 is verified, it must be discussed within the pertinent epistemic 
community whether these stratigraphic signals could see formal ratification with a chosen hierarchical level 
(stage/age, series/epoch, or system/period). These are aspects advocated by Claim 2 and Claim 3, which 
promote the formalization of this body of seemingly stratigraphic evidence into a unit of geological time 
on the geological time scale or international chronostratigraphic chart. If all three claims are accepted by 
the pertinent geological authorities (SQS, ICS, and IUGS), the hypothesis is accepted, and a new formal 
time unit defined by anthropogenic signals at its lower boundary is recognized on the geological time scale. 
Notably, Claim 2 and Claim 3 neither logically nor empirically follow from Claim 1. Recognition of the 
stratigraphic importance of anthropogenic signals does not immediately translate into the proposal of 
formal ratification. This also implies that an eventual rejection of the hypothesis will need to be considered 
in respect to what specific claim has been rejected (either Claim 1, or Claims 2 and 3).  
 
As a historical hypothesis, the Anthropocene Hypothesis is characterized by certain epistemic 
predispositions (as well as challenges).269 These predispositions are reflected in other epistemic aspects of 
major importance for science and philosophy of science, such as explanatory power and intelligibility. 
 
268 Notably, if Claim 1 is verified, only this claim is verified – not the hypothesis overall. On the contrary, if Claim 1 is 
falsified, then the overall hypothesis is falsified. This is not blunt falsificationism: it is a reasonable consequence of 
rejecting that there is any such thing as anthropogenic stratigraphic evidence, or that humans are a relevant geological 
agent. 
269 Turner (2005; 2007, 2013) highlights some of these challenges, such as local underdetermination (which he 
considers more widespread in historical sciences than experimental sciences, making the latter, contra Cleland [2001, 
2002], epistemically inferior in this respect) and information-destroying processes. 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
277 
 
Scientific explanation and scientific understanding have been important epistemic features (and for some, 
central epistemic aims) of science considered by 20th-century philosophy of science. However, as observed 
by Cleland (2001, 2002, 2011), much of the discussion about explanation and understanding in science has 
developed with experimental science (and thus physics) at the center. In the following sections, these 
themes are briefly explored and related to the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a historical hypothesis. 
 
4.2.2 Scientific Explanation 
 
A distinctive ingredient of scientific hypotheses is that they deliver cognitive success by explaining, in a 
logically consistent and empirically adequate way, the phenomena they seek to explain. Intuitively, a 
hypothesis that does not have any explanatory power has little to offer in terms of achieving cognitive 
success. The type of explanation expected in scientific hypotheses is scientific explanation. If the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis represents a scientific hypothesis, then it should, in principle, entail some degree 
of explanatory power. 
 
But what is a scientific explanation? What makes any explanation scientific? 
 
Answering these questions has been a defining task of philosophy of science, and at the core of 
much historical and sociological research at least since the second half of the 20th century. Generally 
speaking, a scientific explanation has been conceived in philosophical literature as an explanation of why 
certain phenomena happen (Weber et al., 2013; Woodward, 2019). Philosopher Bas van Fraasen holds that 
“[a] theory [or hypothesis] is said to have explanatory power if it allows us to explain; and this is a virtue” 
(van Fraasen, 1980, p. 97). Einstein’s general relativity provides a scientific explanation of the perihelion 
precession of Mercury (among other phenomena). Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection 
explains how species evolved and diversified through time. The Alvarez Hypothesis (i.e., meteor impact at 
66 Ma) explains the iridium anomaly at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, and also explains the main 
driver behind the K-Pg extinction event. These are examples of scientific explanations of natural 
phenomena: they provide convincing arguments, supporting evidence, and/or verifiable claims to answer 
an explanation-seeking ‘why’ question (i.e., Why is the Mercury perihelion advance anomalous?270 Why are there 
so many species, each seemingly adapted to its environment? Why is there an iridium anomaly at the K-Pg 
boundary/Why non-avian dinosaurs became extinct?). The nature of scientific explanation has been a 
central theme in philosophical discourses about science,271 especially during the second half of the 20th 
century. Philosophers have developed different models of scientific explanations, each emphasizing distinct 
– and at times contrasting – aspects of scientific explanation.  
 
 
270 The ‘anomaly’ is only such within a Newtonian framework. There is nothing intrinsically ‘anomalous’ about 
Mercury’s perihelion precession. 
271 It should be noted that scientific explanation is a vast theme not exclusively of a philosophical nature, stretching 
to the cognitive sciences, linguistics, science communication studies, and more.

division is only pragmatical, and does not entail any value judgment concerning non-scientific 
statements. Additionally, much of what is considered (or not) ‘scientific’ heavily depends on linguistic, 
social, historical, and epistemic factors, and escapes a rigidly defined characterization of language-
statements. The table only represents an oversimplification of the propositional consequences of 
assuming the existence of any such a thing as ‘scientific explanation’) 
 
 
The idea that there is any such thing as a ‘scientific explanation’ has at least two theoretical implications 
(Woodward, 2019). First, that there is any such thing as non-scientific explanation (Figure 4.2, b) – namely, that 
some things can be explained without recourse to science (in its broad sense). In his Tractatus, Wittgenstein 
(2019) affirmed that “[t]he totality of true propositions is the whole of natural science (or the whole corpus 
of the natural sciences)” (4.11). Inspired by this philosophy, logical empiricism argued that all meaningful 
sentences are only those from science. Within this philosophical framework, only scientific explanations are 
true and meaningful explanations. This view has been largely rejected, allowing a more inclusive view of 
explanation as something broader and unrestricted to the domain of science (and philosophy of science). 
Intuitively, one does not seem required to provide a scientific explanation for loving someone, for enjoying 
playing chess, or for one’s musical taste to justify their own passion for someone or something. In these 
circumstances, a non-scientific explanation may be satisfying enough to answer an explanation-seeking 
‘why’ question. Religious explanations, e.g., concerning reality, goodness and evil, or the meaning of life 
also fall under this category. 
 
The second implication is that there is something which is not an explanation – either scientific or 
otherwise. In propositional terms, this further implies the existence of non-explanatory scientific statements 
(Figure 4.2, c), and non-explanatory, non-scientific statements (Figure 4.2, d). 
 
Philosopher James Woodward (2019) defines (c) non-explanatory scientific statements as ‘merely 
description’ – namely, those statements that are “true, accurate, supported by evidence, and so on and yet 
unexplanatory” (Scientific Explanation, para. 1). He also argues that “[a] presupposition of most recent 
discussion has been that science sometimes provides explanations (rather than something that falls short 
of explanation – e.g., ‘mere description’) and that the task of a ‘theory’ or ‘model’ of scientific explanation 
is to characterize the structure of such explanations” (ibid.). In fact, philosophy of science has attributed 
explanation (viz., prediction) a higher epistemic value than the description of phenomena – as discussed in 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
279 
 
the previous section. However, primarily historical and descriptive sciences such as stratigraphy do provide 
descriptive analyses that are nevertheless epistemically useful and rich. Historical sciences are particularly 
keen on providing descriptions of past events that are also explanatory in relation to their respective 
epistemic expectations. They are simply grounded in different epistemological settings because they face 
different epistemic challenges and implement different forms of reasoning (e.g., retrodiction), and therefore 
deliver different cognitive success. If so, then historical hypotheses traditionally interpreted as ‘merely 
descriptive’ can also be invested with explanatory power – contrary to the idea that explanation only occurs 
in predictive statements. 
 
Is there any such thing as a (d) non-explanatory, non-scientific statement? This question could be 
rephrased as follows: is there any form of knowledge-seeking statement that does not seek to explain, nor 
to endorse the epistemic virtues commonly attributed to scientific knowledge? Subjective statements of a 
purely descriptive nature, such as ‘I am hungry’ or ‘I like to play chess,’ seem to fall under this category, in 
that such sentences simply state a specific state of affairs without recourse to further explanatory reasoning, 
and without necessarily drawing on epistemic virtues commonly associated with scientific knowledge (e.g., 
precision, accuracy, etc.). 
  
To prove that the Anthropocene Hypothesis represents a scientific hypothesis with explanatory 
power means (1) rejecting that its core statements are statements of type (b) and (d), and (2) showing that 
descriptive statements of the type (c) may still hold explanatory power (e.g., description of core samples 
may be informative in an explanatory way). This task is equivalent to determining that the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis entails some degree of explanation.  
 
Extant literature considering the explanatory status of the ‘Anthropocene’ provides a starting point 
for this analysis. For instance, in an article published in The Anthropocene Review, Rosol et al. (2017) write: 
 
for all its provocative force, the Anthropocene is first of all a descriptive concept, taking stock of 
the many indicators that speak for or against such a transition. It tells us where we are: sitting in a 
mobile home with few windows, rapidly curveballing down an unknown path at the end of which 
stands a new state of the Earth (and a finally definitive entry on the chronostratigraphic chart). But 
it does not tell us how we got on board this wildly moving vehicle, nor what powers and propels it. 
As a geological terminus technicus, the Anthropocene lacks explanatory power; it does not tell us what the driving 
forces behind the current, ‘real-time’ exodus from the Holocene are nor how these forces operate and function 
[emphasis added]. (p. 2) 
 
This point is further endorsed by one of the authors of the article, the historian of science and director of 
the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science Jürgen Renn (2020), who holds in his book The Evolution 
of Knowledge that 
 
it is important to remember, however, that the Anthropocene, with all of its provocative impact, is 
first of all a descriptive concept, a controversial geological terminus technicus. The question of 
when exactly the Anthropocene began as a stage in earth history is a specifically geological question, 
related to the characteristic tools, criteria, and standards used by this discipline to establish its 
temporal classification scheme. The concept therefore lacks explanatory power and does not tell us what the 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
280 
 
driving forces behind the current exodus from the Holocene are, nor how these forces operate and function [emphasis 
added]. How humanity became a geological force is a question that cannot be answered by the earth 
sciences alone. (p. 358) 
 
Both excerpts emphasize the claim that the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, or the Anthropocene as a ‘terminus 
technicus,’ lacks explanatory power. In both instances, the argument provided is that the ‘Anthropocene’ 
does not explain the driving forces (viz., causal-historical forces) behind the anthropogenic stratigraphic 
layer that has been depositing over approximately the past seventy years. This view seems to also be 
endorsed by members of the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 1.3), who assert that the definition and 
characterization of geological units “hinges much more on effect than on cause” (p. 15) – meaning that 
geological units aim at describing rather than explaining their content matter. 
This understanding of the term is in fact consistent with the nature of geological time units (formal 
or informal) intended as labels to classify and organize geological time in a meaningful and consistent way. 
Geological designations such as ‘Holocene,’ ‘Cretaceous,’ ‘Phanerozoic,’ or ‘Precambrian’ do not technically 
explain anything per se. They are merely signposts useful for geologists and stratigraphers to mark specific 
times on a stratigraphic basis. For instance, to say that a rock formation is a Holocene Series merely means 
to assign the formation some descriptive properties entailed in the definition of Holocene – that is, being 
formed in the past 11,700 years. However, to simply ascribe a rock formation the status of Holocene Series 
does not explain how that formation happened to be Holocene Series (rather than a Pleistocene Series, for 
instance). Similarly, the Anthropocene as a geological time unit aims at describing the stratigraphy that 
makes the epoch/series functionally and stratigraphically different from the Holocene (Waters et al., 2016), 
rather than explaining why and how this happens to be the case. 
 
While the ‘Anthropocene’ as a terminus technicus is a descriptive term with no inherent 
explanatory power, the explanatory virtues of the Anthropocene Hypothesis are more problematic to 
determine.  
 
First, this is because the lack of explanatory power of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a time label does not 
immediately translate into lack of explanatory power for the Anthropocene Hypothesis overall. Intuitively, 
these two entities are related, in that the ‘Anthropocene’ is the name given to the 
geochronological/chronostratigraphic entity described by the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Yet they 
represent different theoretical entities requiring separate considerations. Indeed, a consequence of this 
semantic overlap is that the lack of explanatory power in the term ‘Anthropocene’ has been sometimes 
perceived as an epistemic deficiency of the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
 
Second, epistemic virtues traditionally praised in philosophical research, such as explanatory power 
and intelligibility, have not yet been thoroughly discussed in light of this recent hypothesis. This is a direct 
consequence of the lack of commitment from extant philosophy of science and geology research to the 
study of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, as previously discussed.  
 
Third, the multidisciplinary nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, both detectable in its content 
and in the epistemic actors implementing this hypothesis, makes it difficult to frame within traditional 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
281 
 
epistemic categories. This difficulty is exacerbated by the seemingly contradictory fact that the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis represents a stratigraphic hypothesis of a nevertheless multidisciplinary nature – an 
aspect considered later in this chapter.  
 
Fourth, the Anthropocene Hypothesis has been accused of being a political statement (Finney & 
Edwards, 2016). This kind of criticism can be paraphrased as claiming the Anthropocene Hypothesis to be 
a non-scientific statement. If adjoined with the thesis that the Anthropocene Hypothesis lacks explanatory 
power (meaning that it is a non-explanatory statement), then it seems inferable that the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis is a non-explanatory, non-scientific statement. This type of criticism is addressed in the 
following chapter. 
 
These aspects inform much of the semantic tension between the ‘Anthropocene’ as a terminus 
technicus and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This tension needs to be untangled by looking at the core 
statements of the hypothesis by means of philosophical analysis. One way to go about it is discussing three 
models of scientific explanation of wide importance in philosophy of science; these are addressed in the 
following sections. First, there is Carl Hempel’s Deductive-Nomological (DN) model: this model pioneered 
the discussion on the nature of scientific explanation during the 20th century, and it also provided a reference 
framework for geologists to discuss the epistemological structure of their own discipline. Second is Wesley 
Salmon’s Causal-Mechanical (CM) model: this theory of scientific explanation rejected Hempel’s model and 
provided a philosophy of causality that is relevant in framing the causal forces of the Anthropocene – a 
discussion of major importance in the history of the Anthropocene as well. Third is Ban van Fraasen’s 
pragmatism: this account offers an example of pragmatic approaches to scientific explanation, and provides 
interesting insight into the contextual nature of scientific explanation to assess whether the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis entails explanatory power. 
 
4.2.2.1 The Deductive-Nomological Model 
 
For most of the second half of the 20th century, philosophical literature on scientific explanation was largely 
influenced by Carl Hempel’s Deductive-Nomological (DN) model of scientific explanation, often referred 
to as the ‘received view’ (Galavotti, 2018, para. 5.1).272 As a partial representative of logical empiricism, 
Hempel’s model (or covering-law model) of scientific explanation has been conceived once again around 
the rigorous standards of physics, and by emphasizing the logical or ‘formal’ properties of explanation in 
science.  
 
According to Hempel, for an explanation to be sound, (1) the explanandum (i.e., the thing to be 
explained) must follow deductively from the explanans (i.e., that which provides the explanation), (2) the 
explanans must contain at least one statement in the form of general law, (3) the explanans must be testable, 
 
272 Wesley Salmon (1998, discussed in the next section) notes that Hempel and Oppenheim’s original 1948 paper “was 
almost totally ignored for a full decade,” and that “[m]ost of the work on explanation during that period focused either 
on explanation in history or on teleological/functional explanation” (p. 68). 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
282 
 
at least in principle, and (4) the explanans must be true (Hempel & Oppenheim, 1948). An explanans that has 
not yet been empirically verified is a prediction. Otherwise, if the explanans has been empirically verified, 
the argument provides an explanation of some observed phenomena. This is called the 
prediction/explanation symmetry thesis (McGrew et al., 2009), for which to explain and to predict are 
structurally identical (hence not being able to predict means not being able to explain). 
The DN model was widely popular during the second half of the 20th century; it saw supporters 
such as Popper, who considered deductive reasoning to best represent theory building, both in normative 
and descriptive terms. This model has by now been rejected by most scholars in the philosophy of science, 
as its requirements appear too stringent and exclusive of other forms of scientific explanation from 
emerging natural sciences. The model also incurred seemingly unescapable forms of explanatory 
asymmetries and irrelevancies. Yet it is important to discuss it as the model that informed many 20th-century 
discussions within philosophy of geology concerning the role of explanation in geology. 
In his contribution to The Fabric of Geology (Albritton, 1963a), Claude Albritton’s landmark book in 
philosophy of geology, Wilmot Hyde Bradley (1899–1979), a prominent figure in the American geological 
community, considers scientific laws to be rare in geology. Based on mathematician Karl Pearson, he defines 
scientific laws as statements concisely expressing “a group of more or less complex interrelationships that 
have repeatedly been observed to be consistent,” or “convenient packages of knowledge” that “simplify 
our efforts to explain the phenomena we study” (Bradley, 1963, p. 13). According to Bradley, most of the 
field’s generalizations are extrapolated from knowledge of physics, biology, and chemistry, upon which 
geology is based (i.e., the derivative view on geology). To further stress this point, Bradley provides a 
graphical representation illustrating geology’s dependence on these disciplines in developing law-
statements. 
 
Bradley realized that among the root causes of this lack of law-statements might be the different 
reasoning geology undertakes, and thus the goals (i.e., degree of generalization) that geology, as opposed to 
chemistry or physics, wishes to achieve. The different reasoning strategies, and therefore the goals, of 
geology are partially conditioned by his ‘derivative’ nature – a view shared by geologists, but also by some 
philosophers of geology. However, Bradley locates a ‘hardcore’ or ‘spine’ in geology that is independent of 
other disciplines; its defining feature is the geochronological reconstruction of the Earth’s history and the 
relational study of its components, from rocks constitution to orogenesis. The methodological difficulties 
(e.g., testing procedures, observation of past phenomena, spurious data, inaccessibility of most of the 
Earth’s surface) that arise from pursuing this goal necessarily lead geologists “to reason analogically, 
inductively, and with imagination” (p. 15). These inferential patterns – ‘imagination’ representing the 
capacity of mentally visualizing past processes based on available and incomplete data – are not exclusive 
to geological research, but are considered by Bradley to be defining traits of geological reasoning (although 
Bradley’s conception of ‘induction’ is actually more similar to the definition of abduction, which has been 
particularly emphasized by geologists and philosophers of science for its role in historical reconstructions). 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
283 
 
To the American geologist, imagination – a virtue marginally stressed in traditional philosophy of science273 
– is an especially important property of geological reasoning: “A geologist who has no imagination is as 
ineffective as a duck without webs between his toes” (p. 16). 
 
Given the epistemic nature of geological reasoning, Bradley concludes that very few geologists seek 
to formulate general laws capable of providing deductive-nomological types of explanations. However, 
Bradley’s view does not imply that general laws are epistemically impossible in geology. Steno’s four law 
(Superimposition, Original Horizontality, Lateral Continuity, Cross-Cutting Relationships) could be 
considered as four foundational laws in geology. The processes of weathering and erosion might be 
conceptually formulated as universal laws if restricted to the Earth (although they could be explained in 
terms of entropy, and thus part of thermodynamics rather than geology). Bradley himself claims that 19th-
century geology was much more prone to identifying general laws than the geology of his time, and that 
advancements in geophysics and geochemistry may lead to a revision of the laws in geology. Besides trends 
in geological research, Bradley’s main argument is that geological explanation does not necessarily need to 
fit law-based models of scientific explanation (such as Hempel’s deductive-nomological mode), nor any 
other model built upon physics or chemistry as a model. This seems to be the case since “[h]istorical 
sciences also differ from experimental science in that they are studying unique occurrences whereas the latter 
may observe the same (or essentially the same) phenomena repeatedly” (Vann & Stewart, 2011, p. 23). 
 
Bradley’s view was also championed (among others) by the American paleontologist George 
Gaylord Simpson (1902–1984). Simpson was another contributor to Albritton’s Fabric. He argued that no 
laws can ever be drawn in historical sciences, and he rejected the cover-law model of science applied to 
geological sciences. However, the idea that geology does not aim at providing general laws, and thus that 
geological explanations do not adhere to the covering-law model of scientific explanation, was contested 
by Richard Allan Watson (1931–2019), an American philosopher and speleologist. Watson posed several 
questions, some of which are of importance for the present discussion – namely, (1) whether there are any 
irreducible geological facts, (2) whether geological laws are possible, (3) what kind of laws exist in geology, 
and (4) what kind of science geology is. 
 
The first question is given two meanings, namely, an ontological meaning (i.e., the existence in the 
world of geological facts which are irreducible to other entities or properties) and an epistemological 
meaning (i.e., the existence of descriptive linguistic and conceptual categories that cannot be further reduced 
without loss of meaning). Given that, ontologically speaking, the class of geological facts can always be 
broken down to more fundamental properties (e.g., minerals to atoms), only in the epistemological sense 
can geological facts be considered irreducible. A geologist engaging with the study of mountain ranges will 
 
273 This is especially the case given the underlying distinction between a context of discovery (i.e., the processes of 
generation of new hypotheses) and a context of justification (i.e., the formal verification and validation of the truth of 
the hypotheses) in 20th-century philosophy of science. Indeed, the implications of this distinction can “hardly be 
overestimated” (Schickore, 2018, para. 5). It informed the very identity of modern philosophy of science, whose 
domain was delimited by the study of the context of justification, and thus by the purely formal analysis of science in 
themes such as scientific discovery or scientific explanation. Presumably, imagination was conceived as a cognitive 
and psychological feature of the context of discovery, and thus beyond the scope of philosophical inquiry on science. 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
284 
 
not see these merely as a collection of atoms. Thus, the first question is answered positively because the 
“need of a ‘distinguisher’ is what is irreducible” (Watson, 1969, p. 489). 
 
The second question – whether geological laws are possible – is again given an ontological and 
epistemological meaning. If geological facts are ontologically reducible to fundamental properties or 
entities, then the seemingly geological regularities are functions of more basic regularities in the physical or 
chemical world. Thus, no geological laws exist, properly speaking. However, since there are regularities 
among geological facts of an epistemological nature, then there exist geological laws of a descriptive nature 
whose reduction to more fundamental entities or properties would result in a loss of meaning. Thus, Watson 
infers from an epistemological viewpoint that geological laws exist. 
 
But what kind of geological laws exist? Answering this third question, Watson identifies three 
possible kind of laws describing geological regularities, namely, cross-sectional laws (i.e., laws describing 
the “relationships among a number of factors at a given time,” ibid.), functional laws (laws describing the 
values for all factors at any given time), and historical laws (laws describing prevailing trends, possibly in a 
teleological fashion). Of these, only the first two are empirical and ultimately constitutive of geology – laws 
about orogenesis or petrogenesis being examples of these. 
 
To answer his fourth question concerning the nature of geology, Watson argues that “the 
description of particular things or sequences of events can be explanatory only if it relates them to the 
general way things and events of these given types regularly behave” (p. 491), because that is fundamentally 
the method of science – to extrapolate generalizations (laws) from particular circumstances. This stance, 
aligned with Hempel’s deductive-nomological model, rejects the view that historical sciences do not appeal 
to (nor are able to generate) laws because they merely describe the particular history of an outcrop, a 
location, or a geological time in the past. On the contrary, descriptions of past events or phenomena can 
be explanatory insofar as they are related to general laws that govern the existence of such events or 
phenomena. Translated into the present context, Watson’s view would argue that statements describing the 
Anthropocene (as for any other geological time unit) are explanatory if, and only if, they refer to law-like 
geological generalizations about the world. 
 
This brief excerpt from the philosophy of geology reveals once again the influence that physics 
had in shaping the 20th-century philosophy of science, which in turn affected discussions among geologists 
about the nature of geology and geological explanation (Turner, 2013). However, it also reveals the interest 
among geologists in understanding the epistemological nature of their own discipline, especially with regard 
to the kind of scientific explanation geology delivers differently from other natural sciences such as physics 
or biology. Besides the fact that Hempel’s model of scientific explanation has now largely declined, it seems 
a practical oddity to attempt to frame geological explanations, especially concerning the Earth’s taxonomical 
division, by researching more or less implicitly law-like statements.  
 
This is especially true in light of the seemingly pragmatic-oriented (Baker, 1996a, 1996b) and 
hermeneutical (Frodeman, 1995) style of geological reasoning. Indeed, philosopher Robert Frodeman 
(1995) argues that “[i]n geology, the goal is not primarily to identify general laws, but rather to chronicle 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
285 
 
the particular events that occurred at a given location” (p. 964), and even that “geologists practiced a type 
of earthbound phenomenology rather than an activity best described by the covering laws of the philosophy 
of science” (Frodeman, 2003, p. 14). Philosophers James Woodward and Christopher Hitchcock (2003) 
hold that “[f]ields of scientific inquiry that deal with complex systems – the life sciences and social sciences, 
as well as branches of the physical sciences such as meteorology and geology – seem to provide 
generalizations that are not truly exceptionless and which lack many of the other features standardly 
assigned to laws” (pp. 1–2). Lastly, philosopher Michael Friedman (1974) also argues that “[e]xplanations 
of particular events are comparatively rare – found only perhaps in geology and astronomy” (p. 5), hence 
suggesting the difficulty of generating law-like statements in geological (and especially historical geological) 
research. These seem more suitable views in representing the epistemological setting of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis as a stratigraphic hypothesis, and thus in answering whether the hypothesis entails any form of 
scientific explanation. 
 
4.2.2.2 The Causal Mechanical Model 
 
An argument against the explanatory power of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a terminus technicus is that it lacks 
knowledge of the “the driving forces [emphasis added] behind the current, ‘real-time’ exodus from the 
Holocene [and] how these forces operate and function” (Rosol et al., 2017, p. 2). A similar line of critique 
could be raised against the Anthropocene Hypothesis – that is, asking whether the hypothesis is oblivious 
to the causal forces (e.g., social, natural, cultural, etc.) behind the dawn of an anthropogenic geological time 
unit. This critique stresses the role of causality as a central aspect of scientific explanation, so that a lack of 
adequate explanation of the causal mechanisms engendering the Anthropocene as a geological time unit 
results in a lack of explanatory power for the hypothesis tout court. 
 
Causality is the central concept in the Causal Mechanical (CM) model of scientific explanation. 
This model emphasizes the role of causality in delivering adequate scientific explanation, and it provides a 
suitable starting point for considering the relationship between those ‘driving forces’ of the Anthropocene 
and the explanatory content of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Causality has been a central theme in the 
history of Western philosophical thought at least since Aristotle’s doctrine of four causes, and it gained 
prominence in David Hume’s deconstruction of causality. Its importance and meaning are hereby only 
discussed in its relation to scientific explanation, and in light of what possible explanatory form the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis conveys (if any at all).  
The CM model was developed in the 1980s by philosopher Wesley Salmon (1925–2001), a central 
figure in the 20th-century philosophy of science and empiricist tradition. Influenced by his mentor Hans 
Reichenbach (founder of the Berlin Circle and adherent to logical empiricism), Salmon originally developed 
a Statistical Relevance (SR) model that placed probability and statistics at the foreground of notions of 
truth, inductive reasoning, and scientific explanation (Galavotti, 2018). In his later work, he began 
developing an alternative model to Hempel’s covering-law model of scientific explanation, abandoning “the 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
286 
 
attempt to characterize explanation or causal relationships in purely statistical terms” (Woodward, 2019, 
para. 4.1), but without abandoning “the hope, perhaps vain, that reductive analyses within the framework 
of the logical empiricist (not logical positivist) program can be given” (Salmon, 1997, p. 477). Salmon’s main 
work on the subject, Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World, was published in 1984 and 
revised through a series of publications in order to respond to and include criticism during the 90s (Salmon, 
1994, 1997).  
At the core of Salmon’s causal mechanical model is the notion of ‘causal process,’ which he believes 
to provide “an acceptable answer to the fundamental problem Hume raised about causality[274]” (Salmon, 
1997, p. 469). Salmon defines causal processes as those “capable of transmitting energy, information, and 
causal influence from one part of spacetime to another” (Salmon, 1998, p. 71). Causal processes are 
ontological categories rather than epistemological categories, meaning that Salmon affirms a realist theory 
of causality. They differ from ‘pseudo-processes’ (e.g., a shadow of an object) because the latter does not 
involve any kind of ‘conserved quantity.’ Salmon (1994) borrowed the idea of conserved quantity from 
philosopher Phil Dowe (who had raised criticism of Salmon’s early attempt to develop a ‘mark theory’ of 
causal transmission) in order to build his notion of ‘causal interactions’ – namely, an intersection of two 
processes where both “are modified in the intersection in ways that persist beyond the point of intersection, 
even in the absence of further intersections” (Salmon, 1998, p. 71). Two balls colliding is an example of 
such causal intersection, where certain conserved quantities (e.g., momentum, kinetic energy) are 
exchanged. Hence, a process is causal if it is based on a causal interaction, namely, if it transmits or involves 
an exchange of conserved quantity. According to Salmon (1997), “[a] process transmits a conserved quantity 
between A and B (A≠B) if and only if it possesses [a fixed amount of] this quantity at A and at B and at every 
stage of the process between A and B without any interactions in the open interval (A,B) that involve an exchange of that 
particular conserved quantity” (p. 462). 
Thus, to explain anything (scientifically) means, according to the CM model, stating the causal 
mechanisms behind a determined causal process in a way that satisfies the question of why a determined 
causal process happened. While this may seem trivial, Salmon (1979) notes that the question of ‘why’ has 
not always been thought of as characteristic of science, which authors like Karl Pearson (who Salmon 
quotes) consider a descriptive and mostly predictive endeavor. Contrary to this view of science as merely 
descriptive, Salmon believes scientific explanation to offer “knowledge of the mechanisms of production and 
propagation of structure in the world. That goes some distance beyond mere recognition of regularities, and 
of the possibility of subsuming particular phenomena thereunder” (p. 422). To provide a scientific 
explanation in causal terms is the ultimate desideratum of science. 
Can this account of scientific explanation help locate the explanatory status of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis? The CM model seems to have been less noticed among philosophers of geology or geologists 
than Hempel’s DN model of scientific explanation. Salmon’s model subscribes to a research tradition 
dedicated to the study of scientific explanation that reflects the practices of language analysis and 
 
274 On Hume’s problem of causality, see Morris and Brown (2021, para. 5.1). 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
287 
 
epistemological research shared among many 20th-century philosophers of science – a tradition also sharing 
much enthusiasm for physics as exemplar science. This latter point is confirmed by the fact that Salmon 
systematically draws on examples from particle and theoretical physics to provide a fundamentally sound 
theory of physical causation, which underwrites his account of scientific explanation. In fact, Woodward 
(1988) considers Salmon’s Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World “a lucid and perhaps 
definitive statement of a distinctive conception of scientific explanation, a conception which clearly seems to capture 
important aspects of causation in many classical physical contexts [emphasis added]” (p. 323). However, this is not to 
say that for Salmon all explanations must be physical explanations of phenomena. For instance, Salmon 
(1998) considers functional explanations as legitimate explanations with a less fine-grained causal character 
than causal explanations due to the nature of the causal processes and interactions considered (e.g., biology). 
Nevertheless, it seems for Salmon that even complex mechanisms require fundamental causal processes 
that underwrite the explanation of those phenomena at the most fundamental (i.e., particle) level. 
A causality-based model may be suitable for explanations concerning the most fundamental 
components of reality, such as bosons and fermions (as Salmons hints at by providing multiple examples 
of these cases).275 However, this framework is impractical for assessing whether or not the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis provides scientific (causal) explanation. The subatomic or physical mechanisms behind the 
formation of anthropogenic strata play an important role in defining and characterizing a possible 
Anthropocene boundary-stratotype, especially in terms of its geochemical markers (e.g., radioactive 
isotopes). Nevertheless, the Anthropocene represents a phenomenon whose complexity requires further 
levels of causation and explanation beyond subatomic interaction. In fact, complexity of physical systems 
has been one kind of criticism developed against Salmon’s conception of causal process and scientific 
explanation (Woodward, para. 4.3). Scientific explanation requires criteria beyond simple causal 
mechanisms and interaction, as also observed by philosopher James Woodward (1988) in reviewing 
Salmon’s landmark publication: 
 
Consider also explanations in cognitive psychology of human inferential errors which make 
reference to patterns of information processing or the standard explanation in microeconomics of 
why a monopoly will raise prices and restrict output. It is unclear in what sense, if any, such 
explanations successfully trace continuous causal processes and even less clear how the causal/ 
mechanical model provides useful criteria for assessing such explanations. (p. 324) 
 
Furthermore, criticism against the explanatory status of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis is not so much about the lack of explanatory power connected to the physical causes of the 
Anthropocene, but rather to the historical causes that enabled humans to become the geophysical agent behind 
the Anthropocene. This implies, first, that different types of non-physical causation exist depending on the 
 
275 Philosopher Hank W. de Regt (2017) considers Salmon’s CM model to be highly problematic especially at the deepest 
level of subatomic interactions. According to de Regt, Salmon’s notion of causal chains (i.e., space-time continuums 
where conserved quantities are transmitted from one entity to the other) does not exist “according to the standard 
interpretation of quantum theory” (p. 61). 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

particular epistemic framework one adopts. Causation of a particular kind may be epistemically acceptable 
in one framework, but not another. Second, the supposed lack of explanatory power of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis must be addressed both in respect to its underlying physical causality and historical causality. That 
is because the ‘Anthropocene’ both is a physical entity and has historical roots (as historians have been pointing 
out), and a lack of either would result in the lack of explanatory power for the hypothesis. 
 
In physical terms, the body of evidence overviewed in Chapter 3 extensively documents the 
physical outcome (effects) of human activities (causes), and how they are relevant to stratigraphic research. 
Nuclear and thermonuclear bomb testing is known to be the cause of the radionuclide markers detected in 
ice cores, lake sediments, estuaries, and other paleoenvironmental archives (Waters et al., 2015; Zalasiewicz 
et al., 2019b). Human activities associated with hunting or land appropriation are considered the cause of a 
sixth major extinction event (and its biostratigraphic signature). Extraordinary human energy consumption 
(Syvitski et al., 2020) is considered the cause of the departure of the Earth System from its Holocene state. 
These examples show that the mechanisms of causation behind the descriptive ontology of the 
Anthropocene are actually known – although perhaps not to their full temporal and spatial extent. In fact, 
they are what make the Anthropocene Hypothesis a particularly unique, and also contested, stratigraphic 
hypothesis: the causes and effects behind the proposed boundary are clearer than any other geological 
boundary in the history of the Earth. 
In historical terms, causation has also been an important category for historical research, and 
historians and philosophers of history have long discussed the role and meaning of causation in history 
(Brien, 2013; Oldroyd, 1999). Philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen (1880–1947) considers causation “as 
equivalent to the sum of necessary and sufficient conditions,” noting that “[t]he application of this concept 
to the events which constitute human history is both a necessary ideal and yet inherently difficult of 
attainment” (Cohen, 1942, pp. 28-29).276 E. J. Tapp (1952) holds that “[a]mong the many problems that 
touch most nearly the field of history one of the most important is that of causation” (p. 67), to the point 
that “[w]ithout it there could be no history” (p. 68, also quoted in Brien, 2013). In his 1961 book What Is 
History?, historian Edward Hallett Carr (1892–1982) writes that “[t]he study of history is a study of causes” 
(Carr, 1990, p. 87), and the work of a historian is to continuously ask the question ‘Why?’ – the same 
defining question of scientific explanation in much philosophical research. He also recognizes multiple 
kinds of causes, from physical and biological to psychological and historical, and distinguishes historical 
methodology in terms of (1) determining several causes of single events, (2) establishing an order and 
hierarchy of causes, and (3) simplicity of explanation. As in philosophical research, causation has played a 
crucial role in historical research on explanation. 
 
276 Interestingly, Cohen (1942) considers the work of historians similar to that of geologists, in that both describe past 
events and causal links without appealing to general laws (this was considered by logical positivism a desideratum for 
science). He writes: “Though history must implicitly or explicitly involve laws if we are to pass from present data to 
past facts, the search for the latter as they actually occurred distinguishes truthful history from works of fiction. And 
it is a demonstrable error to suppose that anything in regard to specific existence can be deduced from purely logical 
considerations. In this respect history is like geology or any branch of applied rather than theoretic physics” (p. 25). 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
289 
 
Research on the (environmental) history of the Anthropocene has focused on the historical/causal 
roots of the Anthropocene, mostly explaining the proposed epoch in terms of the rise of Western capitalism 
and its worldwide institutionalization, the dawn of fossil fuel economies, the advent of a world market, and 
so forth. This kind of explanation is precisely what is lacking within the Anthropocene as terminus 
technicus, according to Rosol et al. (2017) and Renn (2020). As anticipated, this is true for the Anthropocene 
as a geological time unit, given the conventional and descriptive nature of geological terms used for naming 
time units. However, the most pressing question is whether the Anthropocene Hypothesis lacks explanatory 
power because it lacks knowledge of the causal (viz., historical) mechanisms behind the dawn of the 
proposed epoch. If the historical research is understood as complementary to the stratigraphic nature of 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis, then it seems reasonable to consider the hypothesis to entail a certain degree 
of causal-historical explanation. A case is made for this claim, argued later in section 4.2.2.4 after considering 
another model of scientific explanation. 
 
4.2.2.3 Pragmatism and Scientific Explanation 
 
Both the DN and the CM models share the idea that to explain something means to provide the correct 
explanation of phenomena, where ‘correctness’ lies more within the formal structure of the explanation 
rather than its specific context.277 For Hempel, to explain something essentially means to derive it 
deductively from law-like statements. For Salmon, to explain means to illustrate the causal mechanisms 
behind a given phenomenon. While pragmatic elements are traceable in both accounts, they “assume that 
there is a non-pragmatic [emphasis added] core to the notion of explanation which it is the central task of a 
theory of explanation to capture” (Woodward, 2019, para. 6.1). Philosopher Peter Achinstein (1984) 
highlighted this point by distinguishing between pragmatic-type sentences (such as ‘Account A explains fact 
X to person P’) and non-pragmatic-type sentences (such as ‘Account A explains X’). The former account 
for an explainer and an audience, whereas the latter only concerns the epistemic (and other linguistic and 
logical) properties of the explanation given. 
 
Theories that attempt to include ‘pragmatic’ aspects in models of scientific explanation as constitutive 
features are pragmatic theories of explanation. Pragmatism is an American-born tradition that originated in the 
1870s with the work of Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), a trained chemist and geodesy practitioner, 
and William James (1842–1910), a founding figure of American psychology. A third figure of great 
importance for American pragmatism was John Dewey (1859–1952), who advocated decisively for the 
social, political, and educational aims of philosophy.  
Virtually the only fully American philosophical tradition, pragmatism played a central role in 
American scholarship and society during the 20th century. Early pragmatism emphasized clarity of concepts 
and hypotheses by looking at their meaning in practice, providing what developed as a philosophical 
 
277 This is a form of reiterating the distinction between context of justification and context of discovery previously 
mentioned. 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
290 
 
alternative to the language- and logic-based approaches (later embodied by logical empiricism and analytical 
philosophy) and to the continental tradition (or between ‘tough-minded’ empiricism and ‘tender-minded’ 
rationalism, as formulated by James, 1922). Briefly summarized, the tradition emphasizes utility, simplicity, 
and empirical research as epistemic virtues to pursue in philosophical analysis, while also stressing the 
importance of juxtaposing philosophical research with scientific inquiry. Pragmatic views extend beyond 
the domain of philosophy, also reaching politics, education, and religion (Legg & Hookway, 2020). 
According to Baker (1996b), there is a continuity between this American philosophical tradition 
and the geology of the late 19th century. He considers writing from geologists and geographers in the early 
20th century (specifically, Grove Karl Gilbert, Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin, and William Morris Davis) 
as inspired by pragmatism, and as representative of the praxis-oriented methods of geology. This action-
oriented, empirical, fallibilistic, and antifoundationalist philosophical setting reflected geology’s “reverence 
for fieldwork, a humility before the ‘facts’ of nature” (Baker, 1996b, p. 197). Whilst “positivists were 
obsessed with theories and their logical verification or falsification in an ideal world of perfect objectivity, 
pragmatists were concerned with the process of inquiry in the real world of human beings and the natural 
environment that they sought to understand” (p. 208).  
It could be argued that, with the exception of the “mathematically oriented physical geologists” 
(Oreskes, 1999, p. 19) supporting a progressionist or catastrophist278 view of the Earth, pragmatism aligned 
with the overall tone of international geology of the late 19th century, a time where fieldwork in historical 
and applied geology (more than physical geology) was gradually established as the conditio sine qua non of 
geological research.279 In fact, past and present historiography of the geosciences define ‘armchair’ geology 
both as a watershed between the old, religion-based geology and the slow emergence of empirical and 
naturalistic approaches, and occasionally use this term as a derogatory label for scientists not engaging in 
concrete fieldwork. This pragmatic orientation defined different methodologies within geological research 
itself. As noted by geologist Michael Leddra (2010), “field geology looked (and still looks) at the physical 
evidence in the rocks and fossils and is therefore observational, qualitative, and inductive [or abductive], 
whereas physics, mathematics, chemistry, and geophysics are primarily quantitative” (p. 244). 
American pragmatism substantially influenced the development of 20th-century philosophical 
discussions on the discipline.280 If it is true that there is an underlying consistency between the pragmatic 
 
278 Progressionism is “the idea that the history of the earth was directional and controlled primarily by progressive 
cooling from an initially molten state” (Oreskes, 1999, p. 203). This idea was opposed to uniformitarianism (i.e., ‘the 
present is the key to the past’) and was instead close to catastrophism, which argued that the Earth’s history has been 
punctuated by abrupt and radical events. 
279 Interestingly, the perception of fieldwork was inverted in the 18th century – a time when “Hutton was scoffed at 
by his critics for ‘running about the hill-sides with a hammer to find out how the world was made’” (Lewis, 2000, p. 
16). 
280 The generalization that pragmatism mirrored the practice of geological research internationally should be made 
carefully. Whereas pragmatic components can be observed in the late 19th-century international geological community 
sensu lato, differences in theories, methods, and practices – and therefore in research cultures – existed between 
American, European, and British geologists (see also Fairchild, 1932). Some of these differences are made clear by 
historian and geologist Naomi Oreskes (1999) in her book The Rejection of Continental Drift. For instance, American 
geologists had different views on the origin and evolution of the Earth (championed by James Dwight Dana) than 
Europeans, mostly as a function of the kind of data they emphasized, and by Americans’ precautionary attitude toward 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
291 
 
philosophical tradition and the science of geology, then it seems appropriate to briefly consider pragmatic 
theories of scientific explanation to consider the explanatory status of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Woodward (2019) distinguishes between two meanings of the term ‘pragmatic.’ One meaning 
derives from the use of the word in association with values of utility and practicality. A second meaning – 
which is the meaning relevant in the context of theories of scientific explanation – concerns contextual, 
and especially psychological, factors as central features in the process of delivering and receiving scientific 
explanation. The former meaning is implicit in any theory of scientific explanation. It is hard to envision a 
scientific explanation that does not relate on any level to utility and practicality. The latter meaning seems 
to “resist incorporation into the sort of general theory” (para 6.1) sought after by traditional models of 
scientific explanation such as DN and CM, and is a distinctive mark of pragmatic theories of scientific 
explanation. It is in contrast to the idea of any ‘formal’ theory of scientific explanation, emphasizing its 
contextual factors as essential features of any characterization of explanation in science. 
 
An example of the pragmatic approach to scientific explanation is given by the Dutch philosopher 
Bas van Fraasen. His remarks on scientific explanation reach conclusions that are hereby regarded as useful 
in dissecting the epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. In his Chapter Five of The Scientific Image 
(van Fraasen, 1980) he considers scientific explanation in the context of his theory of constructive 
empiricism – a general anti-realist theory of science which is developed through his landmark publication. 
Constructive empiricism holds that “[s]cience aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and acceptance of 
a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically adequate” (p. 12). Empirical adequacy, rather than truth, is the 
ultimate aim of science, of which scientific explanation “is a pragmatic virtue” (p. 97) – not the defining 
characteristic of science. This stance is in opposition to Salmon’s conception of science (the latter arguing 
his view to be also shared by the majority of philosophers of science), who claimed “science can and does 
explain a wide variety of natural phenomena, and that to do so is one of the most basic goals of science” 
(Salmon, 1998, p. 79). To van Fraasen (1980), “explanation is something quite pragmatic, related to the 
concerns of the user of the theory and not something new about the correspondence between theory and 
fact” (p. 100). His discussion begins with an example very similar to the criticism raised over the explanatory 
power of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and it is thus worth considering:  
 
Why are there no longer any Tasmanian natives? Why are the Plains Indians now living on 
reservations? Of course it is possible to cite relevant statistics: in many areas of the world, during 
many periods of history, upon the invasion by a technologically advanced people, the natives were 
displaced and weakened culturally, physically, and economically. But such a response will not satisfy: 
what we want is the story behind the event.  
  
In Tasmania, attempts to round up and contain the natives were unsuccessful, so the white 
settlers simply started shooting them, man, woman, and child, until eventually there were none left. 
On the American Plains, the whites systematically destroyed the great buffalo herds on which the 
Indians relied for food and clothing, thus dooming them to starvation or surrender. There you see 
 
Europeans’ supposedly “unhealthy scientific authoritarianism and autocracy” (p. 136). American geologists advocated 
for a ‘static’ view of the Earth’s evolution, where “[c]ontinents were always continents, oceans were always oceans” 
(p. 19). European geologists advocated for a ‘dynamic’ view, where “[o]cean basins could be elevated into continents, 
continents could collapse to form ocean basins, and change occurred across the globe” (ibid.). 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
292 
 
the story, it moves by its own internal necessity, and it explains why. […] [I]t may be held that, to be 
an explanation, a scientific account must still tell a story of how things did happen and how the events hang together, 
so to say [emphasis added]. (pp. 112–113) 
 
If a scientific explanation requires a story (and not merely a chronology) of how things happened in causal 
terms, and if the Anthropocene Hypothesis does not entail a causal/historical account associated with its 
descriptive claims, then it seems that the Anthropocene Hypothesis does not just lack explanatory power, 
but it also lacks a requirement for being considered a scientific account tout court. Before reaching too hastily 
this striking conclusion (further tackled in the following section), it is useful to analyze Fraasen’s account 
of the relationship between causality and why-questions (two central concepts in philosophical theories on 
explanation), and their context – the latter constituting a central notion in his theory of explanation. 
 
Van Fraasen articulates his definition of ‘context’ in terms of use of natural language. He argues 
that “which proposition a given sentence expresses will vary with the context and occasion of use,” where 
the context of use “is an actual occasion which happened at a definite time and place, and in which are 
identified the speaker (referent of ‘I’), addressee (referent of ‘you’), person discussed (referent of ‘he’ [281]), 
and so on” (p. 135). While mostly focusing on language use, van Fraasen is not excluding extra-linguistic 
features defining the context of scientific explanations. A certain degree of background theory and factual 
information constitute additional defining feature of contexts, and these determine whether or not a specific 
why-question arises or is rejected “in one context and not in another” (p. 145). 
Contexts affect epistemic actors in selecting salient features within a complex net of causal relations 
underpinning natural phenomena that inform a determined scientific theory. The “salient feature picked 
out as ‘the cause’ in that complex process, is salient to a given person because of his orientation, his interests, 
and various other peculiarities in the way he approaches or comes to know the problem” (p. 125). All these 
represent contextual factors in characterizing scientific theories and explanations that require causality. 
Additionally, he argues that since counterfactual arguments (e.g., propositions such as ‘If X had not 
occurred, then Y would not have occurred’) play a central role in defining causality (and thus scientific 
explanation), we should conclude that “explanation harbours a significant degree of context-dependence” 
(p. 118). It is precisely the context that determines what causal processes are selected in a scientific 
explanation. 
 
Context-dependence also applies to explanation-seeking why-questions. Van Fraasen formulates 
these as “Why (is it the case that) P in contrast to (other members of) X?” (p. 127), where P represents a 
specific phenomenon, and X a set of possible alternatives that he names contrast-class. For instance, in asking 
‘Why is it the case that humans have become a geological agent?’, contrast-classes can be represented by 
other species that could have become geological agents (e.g., why is it the case that humans have become a 
geological agent rather than any other species?), or other types of natural agency that humans as a species could 
have embodied (e.g., why is it the case that humans have become a geological agent rather than any other type of

agent?). To provide an answer to these types of why-questions is, according to van Fraasen, to provide an 
explanation, and thus “a theory of explanation must be a theory of why-questions” (p. 134). 
 
The emphasis placed on context within van Fraasen’s general theory of science leads the 
philosopher to conclude that “scientific explanation is not (pure) science but an application of science” (p. 
156). Explanation does not entail any sui generis virtue above and beyond description, but is rather a different 
application of science. In fact, van Fraasen argues that there is little difference between explanation and 
description: “if you ask a scientist to explain something to you, the information he gives you is not different 
in kind (and does not sound or look different) from the information he gives you when you ask for a 
description” (p. 155). Theories and hypotheses vary from context to context because they represent answers 
to interrogatives that themselves vary between contexts, so that “explanation is essentially relative” (ibid.). 
Thus, is there is no such thing as sui generis explanation, and there can neither be “no question at all of 
explanatory power as such” (p. 156) – meaning for the present discussion that to answer whether the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis entails explanatory power depends on the context informing the question asked, 
and the answer given.  
 
Van Fraasen’s theory of scientific explanation is in contrast with the traditional account of 
explanation in 20th-century philosophy of science. However, despite his emphasis on the context of science 
and rejection of general tenets of science, his discussion of scientific explanation is still delimited and 
articulated within the traditional physics-oriented method of analysis of philosophy of science. This is also 
confirmed by his reiteration of scientific examples from physics – as observed, a shared practice among 
20th-century philosophers of science.  
 
4.2.2.4 Does the Anthropocene Hypothesis Lack Explanatory Power? 
 
Salmon (1998) wrote that “perhaps it is futile to try to explicate the concept of scientific explanation in a 
comprehensive manner. It might be better to list various explanatory virtues that scientific theories might 
possess, and to evaluate scientific theories in terms of them” (1998, p. 78). This is perhaps the best way to 
express the approach adopted in evaluating the epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis – namely, 
not in relation to pre-existing models of science often confined within a rigid logico-linguistic picture of 
science, but rather in terms of the specific epistemic virtues they possess. While this seems to undermine 
the very aim of philosophy of science, in fact it allows the epistemic categories developed within this 
research tradition to be applied in specific instances of scientific thought. This effort does not beg the 
question as long as the epistemology of science is understood within its broader social, historical, and 
cultural context. 
 
In the case of scientific explanation, it has been argued in the previous sections that neither the 
DN model nor the CM model provides a satisfying enough theoretical framework to answer the question 
of whether the Anthropocene Hypothesis entails any explanatory power. The emphasis given by the DN 
model on deductive mechanisms underpinning scientific explanation seems to poorly suit the 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
294 
 
epistemological status of the Anthropocene as a proposed geological time unit. Additionally, because the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis entails little (if any) predictive power, the underlying explanation/prediction 
symmetry thesis seems to rule out any explanatory potential retraceable in the hypothesis. While some 20th-
century geologists found in the received view a possible philosophical architecture with which to build their 
epistemological identity, this model is no longer held in extant philosophical discourse, and it is thus of little 
use in investigating the epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
One of its main alternatives, the CM model, provides a physics-based picture of causality that is of 
little use in understanding the driving forces (viz., causal mechanisms) behind the dawn of the 
Anthropocene (although its emphasis on processes as ontological categories may be useful in framing the 
ontological unfolding of the proposed epoch). These forces represent causal mechanisms of larger 
complexity than mere exchanges of certain physical quantities at a subatomic level. However, the analysis 
of this model led to considerations of the philosophy of causality that, in turn, unveiled the importance of 
distinguishing between physical and historical causes of the Anthropocene. The claim that the 
Anthropocene lacks explanatory power derives from the term’s technical blindness toward the historical 
causes of the proposed epoch, in that the physical causes have been largely documented across the planet. 
 
Nevertheless, it is argued that this is not the case for the Anthropocene Hypothesis. The thesis 
hereby promoted is that the Anthropocene Hypothesis does in fact entail forms of historical explanation. 
This means that the hypothesis entails explanations about the historical causes of determined stratigraphic 
evidence besides also describing the stratigraphy of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit. However, 
because the hypothesis is not strictly historical, but rather stratigraphical, the historical evidence is not the 
primary evidence required by the hypothesis in order to be validated or rejected.  
The thesis that the Anthropocene Hypothesis entails both historical and physical explanations of the 
raison d’être of the Anthropocene is based on three arguments.  
The first argument draws on the way that stratigraphic evidence (i.e., physical evidence) is 
presented, especially (though not exclusively) by the AWG. Historical considerations have been a structural 
component of the ‘Anthropocene’ narrative virtually since Crutzen and Stoermer’s (Crutzen & Stoermer, 
2000) seminal publication (see also Robin & Steffen, 2007). AWG members and Anthropocene researchers 
have often presented stratigraphic evidence supported by historical accounts (e.g., Steffen et al., 2011b; 
Waters et al., 2015; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b; Zalasiewicz et al., 2011a). Most notably, the current 
radionuclide signal adopted by the majority of the AWG to date the beginning of the Anthropocene is 
enmeshed in historical significance. Fallout from nuclear and thermonuclear bomb testing is the known 
physical as well as historical cause of the seemingly isochronous and global signal of radioactive isotopes. 
Another example is the morphological change of the broiler chicken, another candidate for a 
biostratigraphic marker for the Anthropocene. The history of Gallus gallus domesticus has been well 
documented, both in terms of physical and historical causes behind its increase in size during the second 
half of the 20th century (Bennett et al., 2018). An additional example is the history of anthropogenic 
minerals. The histories of some human-mediated mineral-like compounds (i.e., the lithostratigraphic 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
295 
 
signature of the Anthropocene) have been (and are being) documented in terms of their spread on the 
Earth’s surface, but also in terms of their historical and social utility among human societies (Hazen et al., 
2017). If the Anthropocene Hypothesis was merely descriptive, it would simply detect and describe the 
radionuclide peak without further inquiring into its causes. On the contrary, the hypothesis does explain 
why these signals exist within the limits of stratigraphic pertinence. For instance, a study published by 
Waters et al. (2016) states that “[t]he driving human forces [emphasis added] responsible for many of the 
anthropogenic signatures are a product of the three linked force multipliers: accelerated technological 
development, rapid growth of the human population, and increased consumption of resources” (p. 
aad2622-2). This shows awareness of the general (extra-stratigraphic) social and historical mechanisms 
behind the Anthropocene.  
The network of research generated by the Anthropocene Hypothesis presents its stratigraphic 
evidence in a way that is not disconnected from its historical counterpart – a view consistent with the idea 
that scientific hypotheses are rarely isolated entities, but part of a knowledge network.282 The hypothesis, if 
not directly involved, is at least indirectly inclusive of a historical account of its stratigraphic basis. This is 
also consistent with the complementary view of historical and geological research advocated in section 
1.2.3. The AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2021) itself, which includes historians, has stressed the complementary 
nature of non-geological research on the Anthropocene Hypothesis, arguing that, “given that the AWG 
considers human phenomena and time scales as well as geological processes, it includes representatives 
beyond, but for the purposes of the AWG work complementary to [emphasis added], the geological sciences” (p. 2). 
Observed as the focal point of a research network rather than in isolation, the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
extends beyond the domain of stratigraphy, while still maintaining its stratigraphic identity. If this is the 
case, then the Anthropocene Hypothesis entails explanatory power in historical as well as physical terms.283 
The second argument draws on the multidisciplinary nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis and 
the AWG. As anticipated, there seems to be a contradiction in claiming that the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
specifically represents a stratigraphic hypothesis of a multidisciplinary nature. Likewise, it seems contradictory 
to frame the AWG as a stratigraphic group of a multidisciplinary nature. The contradiction (i.e., being 
disciplinary and multidisciplinary at the same time) dissolves once the context of the hypothesis and the 
AWG is considered. The context can be analyzed by distinguishing between the aim and the methods of the 
hypothesis and research group.  
The aim of the Anthropocene Hypothesis is specifically stratigraphic. It provides a range of evidence 
in support of a formal ratification of the Anthropocene as a discrete geological time unit on the geological 
time scale. However, while maintaining traditional and necessary aspects of stratigraphic research (e.g., 
GSSP, stratigraphic evidence, formal requirements, core samples, etc.), its methods are multidisciplinary 
 
282 This approach is similar, yet not identical, to Quine’s conception of holism, which can be articulated in different 
ways but essentially claims that scientific hypotheses are never tested (and hence do not exist) in isolation, but are 
always part of a broad system of beliefs. 
283 It could be argued that the degree of historical explanation entailed in the Anthropocene Hypothesis is not in-
depth enough to make it historically sound. However, this is a different argument than claiming that the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis does not entail explanatory power tout court because it lacks any historical explanation. 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
296 
 
because several disciplinary domains are called upon to investigate the stratigraphic nature of the 
Anthropocene in a complementary way – from archaeology and environmental history to Earth System 
sciences and oceanography. For instance, historical studies have served to better frame the causes behind 
the presence of specific stratigraphic markers, in particular radionuclides associated to nuclear testing or 
disasters (e.g., Chernobyl), but also biotic markers (e.g., the San Francisco Bay). Similarly, Earth System 
science has laid the conceptual ground of the Anthropocene Hypothesis by framing it within the context 
of the Great Acceleration. The convergence of multiple disciplinary viewpoints in analyzing the same 
phenomenon reflects the multidisciplinary nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and of the methods 
informing its conceptualization. 
In the same fashion, the AWG is specifically one among many research groups recognized by the 
IUGS dedicated to the study of geological time units. Its aim is to assess whether sufficient stratigraphic 
evidence exist to warrant ratification of the Anthropocene on the geological time scale. However, the 
multidisciplinary composition of the group (including lawyers, philosophers, sociologists, and historians 
among the more traditional geologists and stratigraphers) reflects the plurality of viewpoints adopted by 
the group to investigate the stratigraphic nature of the Anthropocene. More importantly, such a 
multidisciplinary nature extends the semantic reach of the hypothesis by including forms of historical 
explanation for the existence of salient anthropogenic markers.  
Thus, if the historical ‘Anthropocene’ research is understood as complementary (rather than 
conflicting), then the Anthropocene Hypothesis does entail historical forms of explanation. If it does, then 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis entails explanatory power in historical as well as physical terms. 
A third argument draws on a comparative analysis between the Anthropocene Hypothesis and 
another geological hypothesis, the Alvarez Hypothesis.284 The Alvarez Hypothesis was first proposed in 
1980 by a team of scientists conducting geological research in the Umbrian Apennines in Italy (Alvarez et 
al., 1980). It posits that a large collision of an asteroid with the Earth in Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula 
(Chicxulub crater site) explains the high concentrations of iridium (Ir) present in clay at the Cretaceous–
Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary as well as the concomitant Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction event 
(Alvarez et al., 1980). Iridium is a very rare element on Earth, mostly depleted in the crust and upper mantle 
during early stages of the Earth’s formation. Because asteroids and debris from space were known to 
contain iridium concentrations, an asteroid impact was considered the most suitable explanation for the 
iridium-rich layer – later confirmed by refined paleontological studies and the discovery in 1991 of the 
impact crater in the Yucatán Peninsula (Wohl, 2007). As noted by Cleland (2002), the hypothesis provides 
“the greatest causal unity to the diverse and puzzling body of traces (fossil record of the dinosaurs, fossil 
record of the ammonites, etc., and iridium anomaly, shocked quartz, Chicxulub Crater, etc.)” (p. 483). This 
means that the hypothesis explains a vast range of traces by locating the causal mechanisms that brought 
them about – most notably, the iridium anomaly and the K-Pg mass extinction event (and the Alvarez 
 
284 The hypothesis is named after Luis and Walter Alvarez, the father-and-son scientists who, together with Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, first proposed the hypothesis (sometimes also termed 
the Asteroid Impact Theory). 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
297 
 
Hypothesis does so in a better way than competing hypotheses, such as the Supernova Hypothesis; see 
Alvarez & al., 1980, pp. 1102–1104). Likewise, the Anthropocene Hypothesis explains a vast range of 
anomalies in ongoing extinction rates, atmospheric greenhouse gasses, radionuclides in sedimentary layers, 
human-mediated mineral-like compounds, and so forth, by positing human activities as the unifying cause. 
As such, the explanation it provides is also of a historical kind. 
Lastly, van Fraasen’s pragmatic model of scientific explanation argues that there is no such thing 
as explanatory power of scientific hypotheses and theories without contexts defining them. This is a crucial 
point because it enables us to better frame the explanatory status of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. So far, 
the discussion has been advanced as if the hypothesis considered would have explanatory power only if it 
entailed historical (in the sense of human historical) explanation. In fact, this is the observation made by 
Rosol et al. (2017) and Renn (2020) on the Anthropocene as terminus technicus: it lacks explanatory power 
because it lacks historical depth. This consideration is consistent with the nature of geological units, as 
already stated multiple times. However, this line of criticism does not equally hold against the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. The arguments promoted above should already grant the Anthropocene Hypothesis with 
historical explanatory power.  
Nevertheless, if one assumes that the Anthropocene Hypothesis still lacks a sound historical 
explanation (i.e., lacking the human historical causes of the dawn of the Anthropocene as a geological time 
unit), then its context of formulation should determine its explanatory power. The context is determined 
by the geological, and specifically the stratigraphical, community, which is the community wherein the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis (and not the ‘Anthropocene’) was conceived and wherein its scientific fate is 
decided. Such a community of epistemic actors would assess the epistemic validity and explanatory power 
of the hypothesis based on its usefulness, relevance, robustness of evidence, and so forth. This implies that 
the depth of the historical explanation as a function of the hypothesis’ epistemic utility largely depends on 
the cognitive expectations of a particular group of epistemic actors or disciplinary domain. Within these 
epistemic grounds, what may appear as a deficiency in explanatory power from one community (e.g., 
historians) may not be such for another community (e.g., geologists and stratigraphers). This means that 
ultimately it is the epistemic context that determines what (and which theories and hypotheses) entail 
explanatory power. Since the Anthropocene Hypothesis is a hypothesis-in-the-making, the question of its 
context-dependent explanatory power is yet to be answered. 
 
4.2.3 Scientific Understanding 
 
A scientific hypothesis with explanatory power provides scientific understanding of natural phenomena. 
Undoubtedly, a hypothesis achieving scientific understanding is also scientifically useful: it helps scientists solve 
certain problems and achieve some understanding of the world. Achieving understanding of the world is 
often considered one of the central aims of the sciences. It is reasonable to consider as a desideratum the 
fact that scientific hypotheses deliver some type of scientific understanding: any scientific hypothesis H 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
298 
 
explaining a certain phenomenon P is preferable over any hypothesis Hn explaining P if H delivers some 
sort of scientific understanding and Hn does not – ceteris paribus. If the Anthropocene Hypothesis is invested 
with a certain kind of explanatory power, then it should also be able to deliver some sort of scientific 
understanding (and, consequently, useful). This section attempts to answer this question – that is, whether 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis entails any form of scientific understanding. 
A preliminary remark first. In English usage, the term ‘understanding’ (as with the term 
‘explanation’) encompasses a wide spectrum of cognitive capabilities (not restricted to humans). Multiple 
disciplines are involved in the study of the processes of understanding, from neurosciences, psychology, 
and linguistics to pedagogy and anthropology. The specific type of understanding hereby discussed is the 
kind of scientific understanding discussed within philosophical research on science. It is not claimed that 
scientific understanding is the only valid kind of understanding, nor that scientific understanding is a better 
form of understanding than any other kind. The Anthropocene Hypothesis constitutes a scientific hypothesis, 
thus scientific understanding is necessarily the type of understanding that needs to be taken into 
consideration. Since scientific understanding is an important topic in the philosophy of science, it is 
reasonable to consider this disciplinary domain in answering the question posed in this section. 
The discussion regarding the nature and importance of scientific understanding is a byproduct of 
debates over scientific explanation. The value of understanding varies across theories and models of 
scientific explanation developed by philosophers during the second half of the 20th century.285 Intuitively, 
while explanation and understanding seem connected (is an explanation that no one understands truly an 
explanation?), much of the philosophical work influenced by logical empiricism considered understanding 
as part of the psychological, historical, and social dimension of science (i.e., the ‘context of discovery’). For 
early logical positivists, these features were outside the boundaries of philosophical inquiry, which was 
delimited by the objective study of the logical and conceptual nature of science (i.e., the context of 
justification), and by the uncovering of the objective link between theory and evidence. This resulted in 
philosophers of science largely ignoring the theme of scientific understanding as an important aspect in 
philosophical debates on science and scientific explanation (de Regt, 2017, para. 2.1).  
For instance, Hempel considers understanding as expecting a phenomenon to occur under 
particular circumstances and under certain laws in question (Woodward, 2019). Essentially, to understand 
implies to grasp the laws under which phenomena are explained. However, he also believes that “such 
expressions as ‘realm of understanding’ and ‘comprehensible’ do not belong to the vocabulary of logic, for 
they refer to the psychological or pragmatic aspects of explanation” (Hempel, 1966). Understanding is 
excluded from his logically structured analysis of scientific explanation as a psychological rather than 
philosophical object of analysis. For Salmon, understanding means to comprehend the causal interactions 
and causal processes of phenomena. Causality is considered the standard for the intelligibility of theories, 
and causal explanations are the most desirable forms of explanations in science. In his essay “The 
 
285 A pioneering study in the role of understanding in philosophy of science is Michael Friedman’s (1974) “Explanation 
and Scientific Understanding.” Friedman rejects Hempel’s views on understanding as outside the boundaries of 
philosophy of science, acknowledging understanding as a pragmatic value of paramount epistemic importance. 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
299 
 
Importance of Scientific Understanding” (Salmon, 1998), he distinguishes between multiple types of human 
understanding – of which the scientific kind constitutes only but one, belonging to the understanding of 
natural phenomena. Salmon specifies that “[w]e come to understand a meaning when we can say what 
something means; we come to understand a phenomenon when we can explain why it occurred” (p. 83). In 
this view, to understand why a phenomenon occurred means to understand its causal mechanisms. 
The reference framework hereby adopted to assess whether the Anthropocene Hypothesis delivers 
any form of scientific understanding about the world draws on the recent work of philosopher Henk W. 
de Regt (2006, 2017, 2020; de Regt & Dieks, 2005; de Regt et al., 2009). His account emphasizes the nature 
of scientific understanding as “an essential ingredient of the epistemic aims of science” (de Regt & Dieks, 
2005, p. 141). It stresses the pragmatic and context-dependent nature of scientific understanding without 
being restricted to one or more epistemic virtues such as deducibility from general laws or understanding 
of causal mechanisms. Within this view, deduction of phenomena from laws and an understanding of their 
causal mechanisms constitutes some of the epistemic virtues of scientific understanding. They are applied in 
specific scientific contexts, but they reflect neither a universal structure of scientific explanation nor the 
nature of scientific understanding. More importantly, this stance does not solely recognize scientific 
understanding as a pragmatic virtue of science (as many logical empiricists also argued), but considers it 
one of the fundamental aims of science.286 It holds that “the pragmatic nature of understanding is not 
inconsistent with it being epistemically relevant” (ibid.), and should thus be a necessary element of the 
philosophical discussion on science (rather than simply a matter of psychology, history, or sociology). 
Additionally, this view contrasts with van Fraasen’s approach on scientific understanding, in that de Regt 
considers explanation (and similarly understanding) to be a pragmatic characteristic that is nevertheless 
epistemically irrelevant in terms of developing a theory of science and scientific explanation.  
De Regt’s (2017) theory of scientific understanding resonates with the underlying pragmatic 
philosophy informing geological research unveiled throughout this chapter. Thus, it is considered to help 
develop favorable grounds for a discrete epistemological analysis of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and 
doing so by providing the operating definition of scientific understanding herby adopted.287  
At the core of his definition is the notion of ‘intelligibility,’ which he defines as “the value that 
scientists attribute to the cluster of qualities of a theory (in one or more of its representations) that facilitate 
the use of the theory” (p. 40).288 De Regt argues that “[s]cientists prefer theories with properties that 
 
286 Theories of science and scientific explanation such as Hempel’s DN model also recognize understanding as a 
pragmatic virtue, but do not consider it an essential characteristic of science because it concerns the psychology of 
single individuals. Thus, the literature highlighted above does not stress the role of understanding as a pragmatic virtue, 
but as a defining virtue of science.  
287 One model that de Regt addresses multiple times in his work is the Unificationist Model of scientific explanation. 
The model considers scientific explanation “a matter of providing a unified account of a range of different 
phenomena” (Woodward, 2019, para. 5.1). Unificationist attempts have been promoted by philosophers such as 
Michael Friedman and Philip Kitcher. This model is not addressed in the present chapter as it is not considered 
relevant in assessing the explanatory and intelligible status of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
288 Concerning the different possible representations of a theory, de Regt (2017) specifies that “[i]t often happens that 
a theory can be represented in different ways (think of the various formulations of classical mechanics), and each of 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
300 
 
facilitate the construction of models for explaining phenomena, and that is the case if their skills are attuned 
to these properties. If such an appropriate combination of a scientist’s skills and theoretical properties 
occurs, the scientist has pragmatic understanding of the theory” (pp. 39–40). Pragmatic understanding is 
equivalent to intelligibility, so that “[i]f scientists understand a theory, the theory is intelligible to them” (p. 
40). This means that intelligibility is central to scientific understanding: a scientific theory or hypothesis 
delivers scientific understanding if it is intelligible (a theory that no scientists understand is unintelligible, 
and provides no scientific understanding). Intelligibility is considered a pragmatic virtue, and the standards 
for intelligibility (e.g., simplicity, aesthetic factors, causality, etc.) are always context dependent: they change 
across scientific communities and historical periods. Additionally, intelligibility “is not an intrinsic property 
of a theory but an extrinsic, relational property because it depends not only on the qualities of the theory 
but also on the skills of the scientists who work with it” (ibid.). A theory or hypothesis may (or may not) 
be intelligible for a particular group of scientists who endorse the epistemic qualities that the theory or 
hypothesis represents, meaning that intelligibility may vary from context to context “through time, across 
disciplines, or even within a particular discipline” (ibid.). 
De Regt distinguishes between three ways understanding relates to scientific explanation: the 
phenomenology of understanding (the feeling connected to understanding an explanation, e.g., Aha! 
Experience), understanding a phenomenon (having a satisfactory explanation of a phenomenon), and 
understanding a theory (being able to use it). The last constitutes the pragmatic aspect of a theory, which 
de Regt argues to be necessary to understand a phenomenon. Intelligibility concerns understanding a theory 
(rather than a phenomenon or the feeling of understanding), so that a theory or hypothesis is intelligible if 
it is able to be used (and understood). This implies that “understanding involves abilities, and that it is 
thereby pragmatic and context-dependent” (p. 26) – that is, it relies on skills and judgements from scientists, 
making it untenable to separate epistemic and pragmatic aspects of science. Epistemic virtues such as 
simplicity289 or visualizability allow scientists to select one or the other theory or hypothesis, and it is the 
context of these theoretical virtues that scientists value, and that determine the skills that scientists possess. 
In de Regt’s account, the notion of intelligibility entails the fact that a theory, other than being 
understood, should be able to be used (“skills cannot be acquired from textbooks but only in practice 
because they cannot be exhaustively translated into explicit rules,” p. 28). How a theory is used largely draws 
on how physicists, in particular, generate and use their theories. De Regt himself states that his work 
“focuses mainly on physics” (p. 31, note 17), meaning that using a theory mostly implies being able to make 
some predictions with it – which is a central aspect of physics.290 As observed in section 4.2.1, prediction 
 
these representations may have its own specific qualities, which may be relevant to the intelligibility of the theory” (p. 
40, footnote 25). 
289 According to Brice (1989), simplicity was one of the central characteristics that allowed continental drift and plate 
tectonics to become established as a paradigm in geological research. 
290 It should also be noted that de Regt addresses theories rather than hypotheses in developing his theory of scientific 
understanding. In philosophical literature, theories are usually understood as broader theoretical entities than 
hypotheses – the latter being delimited to either single phenomena or a restricted range of phenomena. Nevertheless, 
because hypotheses are also capable of conveying scientific understanding (because they provide scientific 
explanation), de Regt’s theory on scientific understanding is assumed to be equally functional for scientific hypotheses. 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
301 
 
is not considered an epistemic virtue of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This is because it is a historical 
hypothesis, concerned with reconstructing past and present events rather than predicting new ones.291 In 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis, predictions can relate to the possible geological length of the anthropogenic 
stratigraphic signature. However, the hypothesis represents a historical and descriptive292 hypothesis 
because it focuses on the past and present anthropogenic signatures. The intelligibility or kind of scientific 
understanding of the hypothesis under scrutiny should not be assessed based on its predictive power – as 
this represents one among many epistemic virtues of scientific theories and hypotheses. The Anthropocene 
Hypothesis is not used in the canonical sense of using a theory (e.g., plate tectonics, general relativity) to 
explain some phenomena within a bigger framework (despite the term playing such a role in the broader 
environmental discourse). Rather, the hypothesis promotes the use of a temporal label (i.e., the 
‘Anthropocene,’ or other equivalent terminological alternatives) to designate a specific boundary in 
geological time determined by anthropogenic signatures of a varying stratigraphic nature. Such usage is 
consistent with that of other geological time units used to divide geological time in a meaningful way. 
If hypotheses need be able to be used in order to be intelligible, and if intelligibility is always context 
dependent, then the context and use of the Anthropocene Hypothesis need to be assessed to consider 
whether the hypothesis is intelligible and, ultimately, capable of delivering some kind of scientific 
understanding. Presumably, the primary context of the Anthropocene Hypothesis is that of stratigraphic 
classification, in particular the definition of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a geochronological and 
chronostratigraphic unit. This is because of the nature of the hypothesis as a stratigraphic hypothesis, aiming 
to formalize an Anthropocene Epoch/Series on the geological time scale and international 
chronostratigraphic chart. Thus, the question concerning the intelligibility of the hypothesis is to be 
resolved within the stratigraphic community. 
While a separate theoretical entity, the Anthropocene Hypothesis is not immune to the larger 
debates over the ‘Anthropocene’ promoted by the broader academic landscape. This is particularly the case 
since the theoretical distinction between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis has not 
been fully appreciated among Anthropocene scholars and research from various fields of knowledge. The 
multidisciplinary composition of the AWG corroborates the idea that the stratigraphic variant is enmeshed 
in a larger debate that, in some ways, has affected the production of stratigraphic knowledge about the 
‘Anthropocene.’ Therefore, the broader ‘Anthropocene’ may be considered as the ‘outer context’ of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis – a context that plays a role in framing the hypothesis’ intelligibility. 
A related consideration regarding the context of the hypothesis in question (as with any scientific 
hypothesis) pertains to its historical embeddedness. The historicity of scientific ideas was not unknown to 
more ‘traditional’ philosophers of science. Salmon (1998) argued that “we can say that we have scientific 
 
291 Nevertheless, predictive elements are present, if not central, to the notion of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a broader 
conceptual unit. 
292 The fact that the Anthropocene Hypothesis is addressed as descriptive does not contradict the claim that the 
hypothesis entails explanatory power, as some traditional categories in philosophy of science would frame it. A 
description can entail explanatory power as well (i.e., all explanations are descriptions, whereas not all descriptions are 
explanations), as also argued by van Fraasen (see section 4.2.2.3). 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS

understanding of phenomena when we can fit them into the general scheme of things, that is, into the scientific 
world-picture” (p. 87). A scientific world-picture represents a historically determined system of knowledge 
granting the conditions of possibility for scientific understanding. The idea that scientific understanding 
relies on a general scientific world-picture is the tenet of historical research on science: “if we look into the 
history of science also with the aim to find resources for reflection on science in its present state, then we 
have to avail ourselves of this richer concept of science in context as an analytical tool in our historical 
investigations as well” (Renn, 1996, p. 1). The nature of scientific understanding cannot be extracted from 
its historical context. On the contrary, it is heavily dependent on the episteme or conditions of possibility of 
knowledge (Foucault, 1970) of that specific historical and cultural context, so that “the question of the 
nature of scientific understanding is also a historical question” (de Regt, 2017, p. 2). The quest for a universal 
theory of (unbiased) science (somewhat portrayed by critics of ‘science’ more than philosophers today) 
pioneered by the early 20th-century logical positivists failed with the realization that there is no such thing 
a one universal and static ‘science,’ but rather sciences whose languages and methods change over time. 
Thomas Kuhn (2012) famously pioneered this historical turn with The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Larry 
Laudan (1984), another pioneering figure in the historical turn in philosophy of science, observed that “we 
have seen time and again that the aims of science vary, and quite appropriately so, from one epoch to 
another, from one scientific field to another, and sometimes among researchers in the same field” (p. 138). 
As the aims of science (and science itself) change, so do the methods and forms of scientific explanation 
and scientific understanding of natural phenomena. This makes the historical context of any hypothesis a 
transient yet important feature for understanding epistemic values such as explanatory power or 
intelligibility. 
Indeed, to underline the historical context of the Anthropocene Hypothesis means to stress the 
historical nature of epistemic concepts and virtues such as ‘explanatory power’ or ‘intelligibility.’ This 
research methodology is promoted by historians of science who embrace historical epistemology as a 
method of analysis for epistemic concepts (Feest & Sturm, 2011), such as Lorrain Daston (1994, 2017) and 
Jürgen Renn (1996, 2020). In this account, epistemic categories such as ‘objectivity,’ ‘belief,’ and ‘knowledge’ 
are not ahistorical, but rather “emerge within specific practices and contexts, over time become transferred 
to new domains of application, and sometimes become so general that we think they have no history” so 
that “[i]t is the task of the historian-philosopher to study the backgrounds and contexts of these concepts” 
(Feest & Sturm, 2011, p. 289). Likewise, the explanatory power and intelligibility of scientific hypotheses 
or epistemic concepts rely on the defined historical and cultural meaning attributed to them. As shown in 
sections 4.1 and 4.2, much of the philosophical (but also historical) discourse on science assumed physics 
to be the measure for all of the natural sciences. Philosophical discussions on scientific explanation and 
understanding emerged from these settings, so that scientific explanations were mostly conceived as 
resembling explanations from physics. The “universalizing tendency in epistemology and philosophy of 
science” (p. 285) left little space to assess what explanation and understanding meant for a discipline like 
geology – not to mention the subdisciplines of geochronology and stratigraphy. Thus, to understand the 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
303 
 
historical context of the Anthropocene Hypothesis (from an epistemological viewpoint) means to consider 
the epistemic meaning of the categories of ‘explanation’ and ‘intelligibility’ within its disciplinary context.  
Another determinant of the context of the Anthropocene Hypothesis is related to its utility. How 
is this hypothesis used by the scientists endorsing it? That is, how is an Anthropocene Epoch/Series useful 
for science? 
As argued, the hypothesis is considered to entail explanatory power both in historical and physical 
terms. This claim is based on the way stratigraphic evidence is presented, the multidisciplinary 
methodologies adopted, and the range of signals the hypothesis encompasses in explanatory terms. To use 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis means, thus, to be able to translate the vast array of anthropogenic marks 
on the Earth into stratigraphic evidence. In turn, this evidence would be used by geologists and scientists 
to mark a new unit of time of the geological time scale – that is, the Anthropocene (or a stratigraphically 
equivalent terminological variant). Thus, the application of this hypothesis manifests in a twofold fashion. 
On the one hand, the hypothesis lays out a new epistemology of anthropogenic signals for stratigraphers 
and geologists to use. Anthropogenic alternations of the world’s environments and ecosystems had been 
extensively documented long before the hypothesis came to be. However, no other hypothesis, especially 
among competing and alternative Anthropocene hypotheses (surveyed in the previous chapter) explained in 
such a comprehensive manner the stratigraphic trace of Homo sapiens within the present knowledge system 
of stratigraphy and geochronology.293 On the other hand, the hypothesis promotes the use of the 
Anthropocene as a discrete time unit both on the geological time scale and the international 
chronostratigraphic chart, providing international standards of reference for the various types of 
stratigraphic evidence gathered so far.  
Is, then, the Anthropocene Hypothesis intelligible? Does the Anthropocene Hypothesis deliver 
any form of scientific understanding? According to de Regt’s (2017) model, “[a] phenomenon P is 
understood scientifically if and only if there is an explanation of P that is based on an intelligible theory T 
and conforms to the basic epistemic values of empirical adequacy and internal consistency” (p. 92). This 
constitutes his Criterion for Understanding Phenomena (CUP), which forms the basis of his theory of 
scientific understanding. Because intelligibility is included in the definition, CUP is also implicitly a 
pragmatic principle. CUP can be used to reformulate the questions above in the following way: Is there an 
explanation of P (the Anthropocene) that is based on an intelligible hypothesis H (conforming to the basic 
epistemic values of empirical adequacy and internal consistency) so that the phenomenon P is understood 
scientifically? A partial answer to this question is provided by the AWG itself (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, 
para 1.3) when discussing the utility (viz., what the hypothesis explains and what it can be used for) of 
formalizing an Anthropocene time unit. Its utility is considered in respect to geology (para. 1.4.1), the 
 
293 The existence of conceptual antecedents discussed in section 1.2.3 may suggest that the hypothesis does not provide 
any new epistemology that was not already developed or considered in stratigraphic and geochronological research. 
The argument promoted in that section is that the ‘Anthropocene’ concept represents a discrete instance of geological 
reflexivity. This argument can be reiterated for the purpose of stressing the singularity of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis within the extant stratigraphic and geochronological knowledge system. Seen thus, the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis does provide a unique form of explanation within a novel epistemological setting. 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
304 
 
natural sciences (para. 1.4.2), and beyond the natural sciences (para. 1.4.3). Because the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis is a stratigraphic hypothesis, its utility within the geological context is the most important aspect 
to consider, as such a context represents the epistemological background granting the conditions of 
possibility for the hypothesis to be intelligible.294  
The authors argue that the wide array of stratigraphic signatures, some of which have no prior 
counterparts in older geological time units (e.g., radionuclides, mineral-like compounds, plastic), “reflects a 
demonstrably distinct phase in Earth history” (p. 32). The Anthropocene is “clearly geologically ‘real’ both 
as a unit of time and process and as a distinctive stratal unit across a large range of environments” (p. 33). 
Based on these premises, the researchers first recognize the general usefulness of labelling the 
Anthropocene as a distinct phenomenon “to enable and facilitate scientific discussion” (p. 32). This aspect 
underlines the social utility of the Anthropocene Hypothesis – namely, its potential to ignite and fuel scientific 
discussions that are deemed useful in generating knowledge about the world within a given knowledge 
system (i.e., geochronology and stratigraphy). Then, the researchers suggest that “mapping distinct 
Anthropocene deposits” (p. 33) is useful in a local and global way. On a local scale, anthropogenic deposits 
serve not exclusively as a means of geochronological dating (both in terms of dating anthropogenic material 
and in establishing a boundary-section between the Holocene and the Anthropocene), but also as distinctive 
features in engineering geology, where “foundation design will require knowledge of the age of the 
underlying anthropogenic strata” (p. 34). On a global scale, a possible utility in formalizing the 
Anthropocene will lie “in producing a world map of Anthropocene deposits” (ibid.) to visualize highly 
complex processes (e.g., city building) of stratigraphic interest. These aspects underline the stratigraphic utility 
of the Anthropocene Hypothesis – namely, the recognition of Anthropocene strata for the purposes of 
geochronological dating and engineering geology. In addition, the AWG argues that “the process of 
investigating the definition of the Anthropocene […] may help geologists better navigate the process of 
defining GSSPs in deep-time successions” (ibid.). This last aspect underlines the theoretical utility of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis by stressing the general theoretical implications of adopting the GSSP 
methodology for setting a lower boundary for an Anthropocene time unit. 
Whether the Anthropocene Hypothesis does in fact entail social, stratigraphic, and theoretical 
utility has been a matter of debate in the past years. A definite answer on the matter would inevitably be 
anachronistic in respect to future decisions from the AWG and the geological community, insofar as the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis is a hypothesis-in-the-making. For the present analysis, it is only necessary to 
dissect the epistemology of the hypothesis to assess whether it entails forms of understanding, and whether 
it is intelligible in the epistemological framework of geochronology and stratigraphy. 
It seems reasonable to consider the Anthropocene Hypothesis intelligible based on three 
observations. First, intelligibility is a consequence of the link between explanation and understanding. If 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis entails explanatory power (meaning that it is capable of explaining something 
 
294 Notable, CUP applies for any other scientific variant of the ‘Anthropocene,’ such as Earth System science or 
evolutionary biology. 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
305 
 
about the natural world), it must also provide understanding of that thing it explains. An explanation that 
does not deliver any form of understanding (among the epistemic actors implementing such an explanation) 
can hardly be considered an explanation at all. Second, it must also be considered whether the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis explains something new – that is, if novelty constitutes one of its epistemic 
virtues. Novelty is a major epistemic virtue of modern research, whether scientific or humanistic. Novelty 
is not related per se to intelligibility (a hypothesis can claim to bring new knowledge, but fail to be intelligible), 
but rather to the phenomenon being explained. One of the criticisms raised against the hypothesis is that 
it restates something already known (Scourse, 2016): it does not introduce any new knowledge and thus is 
useless. However, Chapter 3 provided an overview of the empirical context of the hypothesis, casting doubt 
on this kind of criticism. Third, the social, practical, and theoretical utility advocated by the majority of the 
AWG confirms that, at least on a community level, the Anthropocene Hypothesis is intelligible – although 
further developments will weigh into this consideration. 
If the Anthropocene Hypothesis is intelligible (and if it conforms to basic empirical adequacy and 
internal consistency), then the hypothesis satisfies CUP and can be regarded as delivering scientific 
understanding of the phenomena that engender the Anthropocene. Additionally, it is argued that the 
hypothesis delivers scientific understanding (and is intelligible) regardless of its formal acceptance (i.e., 
recognition of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit) from the wider geological community. A 
rejection would necessarily cause geologists not to use (at least formally) the proposed time unit to 
differentiate specific anthropogenic strata and biota. This would imply a rejection of Claim 2 (and 
necessarily Claim 3) – that is, that the stratigraphic signature left by Homo sapiens could be translated into a 
unit of time on the geological time scale. However, rejection of formal ratification would not affect Claim 
1 (‘Homo sapiens has left a discernible stratigraphic signature of significant magnitude in the recent geological 
history’) because this represents an ontological rather than epistemological claim. It does not directly address the 
way geology divides geological time according to the methods of geochronology and stratigraphy. Rather, 
the claim states a determined state of affairs that, although caused by us, is now independent of us. If Homo 
sapiens were to disappear instantaneously, its anthropogenic signals would persist in the geological records. 
Lastly, while scientific utility is an epistemic and pragmatic virtue closely related to explanatory 
power and intelligibility, utility is much more reliant on social factors requiring further consideration from 
sociological analyses of science. Ultimately, the question over the scientific utility of an Anthropocene time 
unit is answered within the stratigraphic community – the main field of knowledge concerned with the 
division of geological time in a useful, meaningful, and consistent way. Debates over the utility of an 
Anthropocene unit are further discussed in section 5.2.4. 
 
4.2.4 Further Remarks 
 
The analysis conducted in this chapter attempted to apply models in philosophy of science by discussing 
the epistemological nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as scientific and historical hypothesis. It sought 

EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
306 
 
to shed light on its explanatory power, its intelligibility, its usefulness, and the type of understanding it seeks 
to convey. Each of these represents a major theme in the modern philosophy of science that, either 
unwittingly or deliberately, developed primarily within specific theoretical coordinates – that is, the overlap 
of ‘science’ with physics, the context distinction, the epistemic privilege attributed to predictive hypotheses, 
and so forth.  
 
As a scientific hypothesis, the Anthropocene Hypothesis is part of a social, cultural, and historical 
context that affect its premises (both methodological and theoretical), formulation, and content. One of 
the major forms of criticism that partially redirected research methods in philosophy of science in the past 
decade was the absence of historical depth. This was due to the methodological boundaries (i.e., context of 
justification and context of discovery) established under logical empiricism. The historical turn pioneered 
by Kuhn, Lakatos, and Laudan ensured that history became a conditio sine qua non of philosophical research 
on science. Following this trend, a philosophy of geology needs to be historically sound. How can 
philosophy of geology and epistemology thus meet history? 
 
 
A recent attempt to merge epistemological analysis and historical research has been named 
‘historical epistemology.’ Historian of science Lorraine Daston (1994) defines historical epistemology as 
“the history of the categories that structure our thought, pattern our arguments and proofs, and certify our 
standards for explanation” (p. 282). Renn (1996) provides a further definition of historical epistemology as 
conducted by the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, namely as an attempt  
 
to open up a space for exploring the relationship between all relevant dimensions of the 
development of scientific knowledge […] [by comprising] the reconstruction of central cognitive 
structures of scientific thinking, the study of the dependence of these structures on their experiential 
basis and on their cultural conditions, and the study of the interaction between individual thinking 
and institutionalized systems of knowledge. (p. 4) 
 
Such an approach “requires an integration of social, cultural, and cognitive studies of science” (ibid.). While 
cultural tensions between historical epistemology and philosophy of science exist (Brenner, 2016), historical 
epistemology may provide complementary tools of analysis to avoid reiterating a ‘formal’ (meaning 
ahistorical) philosophy of geology. First, this is because historical epistemology is “not interested in long 
dead concepts or styles, but with those that are active today” (Nasim, 2013, p. 23). Second, “if scientific 
concepts or styles all contain in them some trace of their origin” (ibid.), then the origin of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis must be traceable in the years prior to its formulation by the Anthropocene Working Group. 
These ‘traces’ are present in the concept’s most recent history as well as in its genealogical background, but 
also in less explicit forms of thinking about geological time developed within the geosciences – an aspect 
investigated in this chapter. Third, historical epistemology “wants to emerge from out of some 
transformation in history, so that one can determine whether or not before the period of transition there 
was such a concept or style possible” (ibid.).  
The ‘Anthropocene’ idea emerged from a process of reconfiguration of knowledge about the Earth 
and its history that was articulated through four main moments. First, the recognition of anthropogenic 

THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS AS A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS 
307 
 
signals expressed in geological (relative) units in 19th-century European and 20th-century Russian geology. 
Second, the revolution in geochronological sciences consequent to the discovery and application of 
radiometric dating in the first half of the 20th century, which allowed for the discovery of deep time. Third, 
the novel approach of Earth System science, which transitioned from environmental sciences to the study 
of the Earth as a system (Hamilton, 2016). Fourth, the increasing popular, academic, and institutional 
recognition of the anthropogenic impact on the Earth in the second half of the 20th century. These are 
important historical and theoretical moments that engender the very possibility of conceptualizing the 
contemporary ‘Anthropocene,’ and thus of formulating the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Sociological aspects are important to consider too when analyzing the ‘Anthropocene’ concept as 
well as the Anthropocene Hypothesis – despite the strong antagonism between sociological approaches to 
science and traditional philosophy of science. In epistemological terms, social epistemology may represent 
a third complementary approach in dissecting the knowledge claims of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
Challenging the ‘individualistic’ assumption of traditional epistemology (where notions such as truth, belief, 
and fact usually depend upon individual subjects), social epistemology configures “an enterprise concerned 
with how people can best pursue the truth (whichever truth is in question) with the help of, or in the face of, 
others” and with “truth acquisition by groups, or collective agents” (Goldman & O'Connor, 2019, para. 1). 
Social epistemic aspects, such as group acceptance, are structural for Claim 2 and Claim 3 of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. The claims advocate for a reconfiguration of knowledge that is heavily 
dependent on the epistemic actor (i.e., social groups) involved, namely the AWG itself, the Subcommission 
on Quaternary Stratigraphy, and the remaining parental geological bodies. 
 
Further research on the historical epistemology and social epistemology aspects of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis will be necessary for developing (or rather, initiating) discussions on the 
‘geological Anthropocene’ as a scientific hypothesis.

CHAPTER 5 
DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A discussion between people who share many views is unlikely to be fruitful, 
 even though it may be pleasant, while a discussion between vastly different frameworks  
can be extremely fruitful, even though it may sometimes be extremely difficult,  
and perhaps not quite so pleasant (though we may learn to enjoy it).  
—Karl Popper, The Myth of the Framework 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The birth, development, and acceptance or rejection of scientific ideas is not an uncontested process. In 
fact, constructive skepticism is a distinguished characteristic of (democratic) science – a characteristic 
allowing concepts, conjectures, hypotheses, and theories to flow and to be critically discussed prior (and 
subsequent) to their acceptance or rejection among scientific communities. In a sense, the absence of this 
social dimension of critical inquiry means the absence of science. Karl Popper notoriously champions this 
view, as evident by the opening quote of this chapter. Advocating against the problem of relativism (i.e., 
that mutual understanding among different frameworks is impossible), he argues that “the growth of knowledge 
depends entirely on the existence of disagreement” (Popper, 1994, p. 34). Without disagreement, and the critical 
debates that ensue thereafter, there is no possibility for scientific knowledge. If the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis truly represents a scientific hypothesis, then there must be some degree of scientific disagreement 
and debate concerning its claims and epistemology. 
 
Therefore, this fifth and final chapter surveys the debate gravitating around the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. More precisely, it explores two grand types of criticism raised within Anthropocene Studies – 
namely, against the ‘Anthropocene’ boundary object, and against the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Criticism of the ‘Anthropocene’ is discussed in section 5.1. This criticism stems primarily from the 
humanities and social sciences. It addresses multiple aspects of the ‘Anthropocene’ both as a concept and 
discourse, focusing mostly on the normative (i.e., ethical, social, political) implications that the term seems 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
310 
 
to entail – either unwittingly or explicitly. Surveying this criticism is crucial because criticism of the 
‘Anthropocene’ often overlaps semantically with criticism of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This is because 
much extant literature does not clearly distinguish between these two distinct theoretical entities. Therefore, 
it is necessary to consider whether arguments against the ‘Anthropocene’ equally hold against the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Criticism of the Anthropocene Hypothesis is discussed in section 5.2. This type of criticism – raised 
both by geologists and natural scientists, but also stemming from human sciences such as archaeology – 
engenders scientific discussions around the epistemic validity, epistemic legitimacy, methodological 
consistency, and usefulness of the hypothesis. Surveying this criticism is paramount in identifying the 
dialectical process that led the hypothesis to its current empirical and methodological formulation. This 
section aims at detecting the major theoretical challenges faced by the Anthropocene Hypothesis according 
to the scientific community. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.1. Summary of the main arguments against the ‘Anthropocene’ (green) and against the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis (blue). 
 
 
Both types of criticism are discussed by delineating central arguments in critical literature (Figure 5.1). These 
arguments are expressed in the form of single short statements summarizing the main theoretical points 
and discursive hubs advanced by critics of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This 
methodological choice reflects the necessity of (1) distinctively identifying the core criticism recurrently 
expressed by authors and researchers in Anthropocene Studies, (2) clarifying the central lines of arguments 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
311 
 
advanced by criticism, and (3) discussing the meaning and implications of criticism as formulated in each 
argument. 
 
This methodological choice is primarily descriptive in respect to the criticism surveyed. The chapter 
does not seek to shield the Anthropocene Hypothesis from criticism ex ante, nor to lean in favor or against 
of the hypothesis. The question over the epistemological status or validity of the Anthropocene as a scientific 
hypothesis is a different question from whether or not the hypothesis should see formal approval. The 
criteria adopted to discuss criticism only aim at connecting extant criticism with the purpose of thoroughly 
investigating the epistemological nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. As illustrated in this chapter, 
some criticism from the humanities is considered only marginally or not at all pertinent to the scientific 
core of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This is not so in virtue of the arguments advanced, but because of 
the object of criticism (i.e., one of more aspects of the ‘Anthropocene’). In a similar way, scientific debates 
of a technical nature are substantially different from the critique advanced by humanistic approaches to the 
‘Anthropocene.’  
 
However, some considerations expressed in this chapter take a step further from merely mapping 
and describing criticism. This is particularly the case for section 5.1, where it is argued that much criticism 
advanced against the ‘Anthropocene’ does not equally hold against the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Such a 
stance does not reflect a ‘preference’ toward the hypothesis, nor does it argue that such criticism is invalid 
per se. It simply clarifies what arguments directly concern the epistemological nature and status of the 
Anthropocene as a scientific hypothesis. This can be assessed by considering whether and how criticism 
addresses the system of knowledge of stratigraphy – the theoretical domain of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis – and by considering the logical and semantic implications of the arguments advanced. The 
nature of the arguments advanced necessarily side with specific viewpoints over the meaning, scope, and 
aim of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific formulation. Notably, taking any such side is a 
consequence of the argumentative legitimacy of the reasons proposed rather than a predefined desire of 
siding with one or other factions in extant debates. 
 
 
5.1 Against the ‘Anthropocene’ 
 
 
It is difficult to identify in detail the several lines of criticism that the notion of ‘Anthropocene’ has received 
since its coinage (and especially during the last decade). The difficulty arises not solely because of the 
amount and breadth of the criticism raised, but also because of the particular definition of ‘Anthropocene’ 
that each critique implicitly or explicitly provides. Such difficulty mostly arises from the issue of definition 
– one of the major hindrances to establishing a multi- and interdisciplinary functional framework for 
Anthropocene Studies, as observed in the opening chapter of this research. The multiple interpretations, 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
312 
 
meanings, and purposes attributed to the notion by recent scholarship make any attempt to thoroughly map 
criticism – while also doing justice to each individual argument – a daunting task. 
This predicament is particularly relevant in terms of framing criticism generating from the 
humanities and social sciences. Their engagement with the ‘Anthropocene’ begun around 2007-2009, 
escalating in the following decade to become the leading research fields in Anthropocene Studies. While 
maintaining a basic shared identity (as a global, emergent, and human-mediated environmental 
predicament), the term roamed and shapeshifted across disciplines – at times remerging as one among now 
many existing terminological variants. Either by criticizing, reformulating, or restating the new term, the 
‘Anthropocene’ has been quite a successful linguistic and theoretical device across humanists and social 
scientists, whose contributions made the term “the most influential concept in environmental studies” 
(Moore, 2016a, p. 2) in recent times. Yet the rapid interest in the term (witnessed by the increasing number 
of publications featuring ‘Anthropocene’ in the title or subtitle) does not often translate in defining what 
about the ‘Anthropocene,’ or even which ‘Anthropocene,’ is being considered. As a result, criticism 
unwittingly addresses conceptual ‘layers’ of the term, generating confusion over the specific issue at stake. 
Nevertheless, an attempt to chart these muddy waters is made. This effort is based on two 
premises. The first premise is normative-methodological. Charting criticism from the humanities and social 
sciences should be done because such criticism has had an influence in forging the very ‘scientific 
Anthropocene’ as concept and discourse. Most notably, this criticism urged the AWG to delineate the 
boundaries of the ‘stratigraphic Anthropocene’ to differentiate it from variants of the broader 
‘Anthropocene’ (a separation very close to the preliminary distinction grounding this research). In the 
group’s latest monograph (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b), it is clarified that the ‘stratigraphic Anthropocene’ 
“does not in any way restrict (or seek to restrict) the potential use of the word in other meanings, by other 
communities, as it has indeed been the case in the last decade” (p. 3). This statement does not merely 
witness the proliferation of multiple conceptual units of the ‘Anthropocene,’ it also witnesses the necessity 
of delineating the AWG’s mandate as well as the conceptual and epistemological identity and purpose of 
the “geological Anthropocene” (ibid.) in light of the term’s increasing polysemy. Thus, while maintaining 
the standpoint of the Anthropocene Hypothesis in order to survey criticism, it is considered paramount to 
address the broader discussions generated by the interplay of natural sciences, social sciences, and 
humanities in engaging with the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
The second premise is descriptive. Criticism advanced so far exhibits observable similarities in 
addressing theoretical flaws seemingly implicit in the term as conceived by the natural sciences as well as 
the broader normative implications of its rhetoric. These similarities have been noted by ‘Anthropocene’ 
scholars who have also attempted to map existing criticism by either endorsing existing lines of criticism or 
by simply shedding light on extant debates. For instance, literary theorist Daniel Hartley (2016) summarizes 
five problems that the geological discourse of the Anthropocene – which would be otherwise “relatively 
harmless” (p. 155) – entails when translated into the political arena. These are (1) a seemingly ahistorical, 
unifying, and abstract conception of humanity, blind to the historical and cultural differentiations across 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
313 
 
societies; (2) an Anglocentric and apolitical technological determinism that promotes a model of historical 
causality “inadequate to actual social and relational modes of historical causation” (p. 156); (3) the 
subsumption of historical time to a single, “homogeneous time of linear succession, which increasingly 
contracts as catastrophe approaches” (p. 157); (4) a Whig view of history based on endless progress and 
enlightenment; and (5) the promotion of strong technocratic, managerial, and apolitical solutions by 
“Anthropocene scientists [who] cannot see technology as a political force, [and] so they cannot see politics 
as a material force” (ibid.). 
Another attempt to navigate criticism and discussions of the ‘Anthropocene’ and its stratigraphic 
variant comes from Julia A. Thomas (2020). The historian defines three types of narratives or ‘stories’ of 
the ‘Anthropocene’ within Anthropocene Studies – namely, ‘Anything Goes,’ ‘Singular Story,’ and 
‘Democracy of Voices.’ The ‘Anything Goes’ approach295 sees disciplines engaging freely with the term by 
telling their own versions of the ‘Anthropocene’ with “little reference to the science” (Thomas, p. 43); the 
‘Singular Story’ perceives humans’ history as “integrated into the biogeophysical one” (p. 57) – that is, it 
sees human and Earth System history as an integrated continuum; and the ‘Democracy of Voices’ advocates 
for a “wider range of inventive possibilities” (p. 62) by exploring local stories and responses to the global 
‘Anthropocene.’  
 
A third interesting attempt in navigating ‘Anthropocene’ criticism appears in an article published 
by the editors of Scientific American (2018). The article highlights some problems that the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept and narrative entail. The first problem they identify is hubris, which they connect to the critique of 
anthropocentrism advanced by sociologist Eileen Crist (2013, but also present in other scholars, e.g., 
Mitman, 2018; Brannen, 2019). A second problem is the underlying unifying connotation of the 
‘Anthropocene’ concept that dissolves responsibilities in engendering the Anthropocene. A third critique 
they find among anthropologists and social scientists addresses the implicit role that human nature, rather 
than human culture, invests in causing the dawn of a new epoch – a critique parallel to that of the term’s 
supposed lack of historical (hence cultural) depth. 
 
One last instance worth mentioning is Christophe Bonneuil’s (2015) critique of the naturalist 
narrative. The historian finds three interrelated themes informing Earth System science and geosciences 
portraying the ‘Anthropocene’ within the natural sciences, namely: 
 
(1) the front-staging of ‘the human species’ as the undifferentiated causal force changing the Earth; 
(2) the recency of environmental consciousness thanks to Earth monitoring science, breaking with 
centuries of a modern dark age of unconscious impacts; and (3) the erasure of civil society and 
laypeople as producers of environmental knowledge and solutions, associated with a self-celebration 
of scientists as shepherds of humankind and of Earth and the advocacy of more science and green 
technologies to save the planet. (pp. 18-19) 
 
295 The terminology chosen to encapsulate this approach echoes Paul Feyerabend’s (1993) famous epistemological 
anarchism, for which “[s]cience is (and should be) an essentially anarchic enterprise: theoretical anarchism is more 
humanitarian and more likely to encourage progress than its law-and-order alternatives” (p. 9). Feyerabend’s approach 
suggested altogether abandoning the idea of a fixed scientific method and scientific rationality, and that only one ‘rule’ 
adapted to all circumstances in describing and directing science – that anything goes.

Bonneuil considers these aspects crucial in deconstructing the naturalistic narrative, which “tends to 
reproduce the grand narrative of modernity, that of Man moving from environmental obliviousness to 
environmental consciousness, of Man equaling Nature’s power, of Man repairing Nature” (p. 23). 
These excerpts provide a validating point for the premises set in this section – that is, the possibility 
as well as the necessity of mapping criticism. Notably, the criticism just surveyed seems to converge toward 
(at least) four specific arguments against the ‘Anthropocene,’ namely, (1) the unifying Anthropos argument, 
(2) the anthropocentrism argument, (3) the historical argument, and (4) the ethical argument. These are 
arguments at the forefront of humanistic and social science literature in Anthropocene Studies, engendering 
most of the discussions about and against the ‘Anthropocene.’ They share a common normative (viz. 
ethical, moral, aesthetic, political) matrix, as exemplified by Crist’s (2013) critique of the term: “If a new 
name were called for, then why not have a conversation or a debate about what it should be [emphasis added], 
instead of being foisted (for a very long time, I might add) with the Age of Man as the ‘obvious’ choice?” 
(p. 142). Because the Anthropocene Hypothesis does not entail these types of normative statements, these 
four lines of critique necessarily mean to contest the ‘Anthropocene’ as a concept fraught with ethical, 
social, and political significance. 
Before moving to an analysis of each of the arguments outlined above, two preliminary remarks 
are due. Firstly, it should be noted that arguments against the ‘Anthropocene’ are often semantically 
entailed. A clear example of this is T. J. Demos’s (2017) critique of the ‘Anthropocene.’ The visual culture 
theorist states that 
 
Anthropocene rhetoric – joining images and texts – frequently acts as a mechanism of universalization 
[i.e., UAA], albeit complexly mediated and distributed among various agents, which enables the 
military-state-corporate apparatus to disavow responsibility [i.e., EA] for the differentiated impacts of 
climate change, effectively obscuring the accountability [i.e., HA] behind the mounting eco-catastrophe 
and inadvertently making us all complicit in its destructive project. (p. 19) 
 
This excerpt shows three different arguments – that is, Undifferentiated Anthropos Argument (UAA), 
Ethical Argument (EA), and Historical Argument (HA) – relating to one another in a single paragraph. 
What this means is that separating each line of critique does not mean that each exists independently. 
Commonly, the main arguments against the ‘Anthropocene’ appear simultaneously in critical literature. 
Nevertheless, the rationale and purpose behind each argument justifies a basic and purely descriptive 
separation among different lines of critique. 
Secondly, as anticipated at the beginning of the chapter, the lack of a multidisciplinary framework 
makes it difficult to precisely frame whether criticism is addressing the ‘Anthropocene’ or the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. This distinction has not (yet) been established as an analytical tool in Anthropocene Studies. 
Criticism against the ‘Anthropocene’ often overlaps (explicitly or implicitly) with criticism against the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. Nevertheless, the normative-descriptive divide assumed in section 1.3.1 
provides an analytical tool for navigating different types of criticism based on content, assumptions, 
rationale, and purpose. 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
315 
 
5.1.1 The Undifferentiated Anthropos Argument 
 
Perhaps the most common (and intuitive) type of criticism against the ‘Anthropocene’ is the seemingly 
undifferentiated notion of Anthropos that the term conveys. This criticism rejects the notion of a single 
humanity acting as a synchronous and equally responsible agent for the dawn of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
Defining the Anthropos has been a central question for scholars from the humanities and social sciences 
contributing to Anthropocene Studies because its definition has implications “for how we collectively 
imagine the human place on the planet, who gets counted under that umbrella of humanity, and how that 
vison should dictate the future of our socioecological relations on this planet and beyond” (Hoelle & Kawa, 
2021, p. 1). 
Criticisms against universalizing notions of ‘humanity’ long precede ‘Anthropocene’ debates. The 
humanities and social sciences (especially in terms of postcolonial literature) have been meticulously 
deconstructing Eurocentric or Western-centric narratives of Anthropos in the past decades. For instance, in 
introducing their volume Rethinking Environmental History, Hornborg et al. (2007) make clear that rather than 
focusing on “the abstract accretion of landscape changes or technological inventions as a collective human 
experience over time, it [the volume] seeks to highlight how such changes are distributed in space. It 
acknowledges that humanity is not a single ‘we’ but deeply divided in terms of reaping the benefits versus carrying the burdens 
of development” (p. 1, quoted in Robin & Steffen, 2007). Bonneuil and Fressoz (2016) also note that “[f]rom 
the Marxist concept of class to the anthropology of Claude Lévi-Strauss, feminist and post-colonial studies, 
these works have attacked the old universalism of ‘Man’ and emphasized the equal dignity but also diversity 
of cultures, societies, social classes and sexual identities” (p. 23). This increasing skepticism toward ‘grand 
narratives’ or seemingly all-inclusive concepts, particularly addressed towards the natural sciences, has 
echoed throughout Anthropocene Studies. Environmental historians, sociologists, philosophers, and 
anthropologists have been particularly attentive to deconstructing the seemingly unifying notion of 
Anthropos in the ‘Anthropocene’ by unveiling its assumptions, implications, and rhetoric – especially within 
the normative (political and ethical) arena. Here are some examples. 
Sociologist Bronislaw Szerszynski (2012) asks “whose name [we would] be putting on the 
Anthropocene golden spike if one were ever placed in the great stone book” (p. 172). He argues that, 
similarly to biological nomenclature, the Anthropos in the Anthropocene represents a ‘onomatophore’ – 
namely, agreed reference points in biological typification represented by determined specimens whose 
characteristics embody the group they belong to.296 If the Anthropocene is to be represented by our species 
through golden spikes, then what Anthropos “would be the onomatophore of the Anthropocene?” (p. 173). 
Szerszynski surveys different ‘types’ of Anthropos to answer this question – namely, Homo faber, the goal-
oriented human whose ceaseless work has engulfed the Earth of its products; Homo consumens297 or Homo 
 
296 For an epistemological discussion on the nature of types in scientific nomenclature and typification in science 
(including geology), see Bokulich (2020b). 
297 A similar term recently used by social scientists is Homo consumericus. See related Wikipedia page (accessed on April

colossus, the consumerist human whose indirect actions are increasingly exhausting and degrading the Earth’s 
ecosystems; and Homo gubernans, the ‘helmsman’ whose actions will “inevitably become conditioned by 
those of the matter he attempts to steer, as he progressively entangles himself in the potentialities of matter” 
(p. 176).298 He considers these ‘syntypes’ rather than ‘holotypes’ of the ‘Anthropocene’ – the former 
representing multiple specimens equally representing onomatophores of their species, the latter 
representing a single specimen acting as an individual onomatophore for its species. Based on this analogy, 
Szerszynski concludes that the Anthropos “is dispersed into a series of syntypes, multiple subject and object 
positions,” meaning that no single Anthropos is representative of the ‘Anthropocene,’ but the plurality of its 
existential conditions. 
Bonneuil and Fressoz (2016) deconstruct the Anthropos in the ‘Anthropocene’ in the fourth chapter 
of their book The Shock of the Anthropocene. They argue that the ‘Anthropocene’ thesis “supports the idea of 
a totalization of the entirety of human actions into a single ‘human activity’ generating a single ‘human 
footprint’ on the Earth,” presenting “an abstract humanity uniformly involved – and, it implies, uniformly 
to blame” (pp. 65–66). This vision of an undifferentiated humanity ignores the multiple timescales of human 
societies under a generalist and quantitative view of human histories. It ignores specific questions of 
responsibility by attributing no weight to the uneven contribution to the environmental challenges 
characterizing the Anthropocene: 
 
But what is this anthropos, the generic human being of the Anthropocene? Is it not eminently diverse, 
with extremely different responsibilities in the global ecological disturbance? An average American, 
for example, consumes thirty-two times more resources and energy than an average Kenyan. A new 
human being born on Earth will have a carbon footprint a thousand times greater if she is born 
into a rich family in a rich country, than into a poor family in a poor country. Should the Yanomami 
Indians, who hunt, fish and garden in the Amazonian forest, working three hours a day with no 
fossil fuel (and whose gardens have a yield in energy terms nine times higher than the French 
farmers of the highly fertile Beauce) feel responsible for the climate change of the Anthropocene? 
(p. 70) 
 
The authors suggest that the term ‘Oliganthropocene’ (originally introduced by the geographer Erik 
Swyngedouw299) may better represent the reality of the ‘Anthropocene,’ in that it would attribute its dawn 
 
298 Homo faber is a term popularized by philosopher and political theorist Hannah Arendt to identify the goal-oriented 
and utility-driven existential condition of modern working humans. Homo consumens was coined by sociologist and 
philosopher Eric Fromm (1965), who defined it as “the man whose main goal is not primarily to own things, but to 
consume more and more, and thus to compensate for his inner vacuity, passivity, loneliness, and anxiety” (p. 214). Homo 
colossus was coined by the sociologist William Catton (1982), who used the term in his 1980 monograph Overshoot: 
“When the earth’s deposits of fossil fuels and mineral resources were being laid down, Homo sapiens had not yet 
been prepared by evolution to take advantage of them. As soon as technology made it possible for mankind to do so, 
people eagerly (and without foreseeing the ultimate consequences) shifted to a high-energy way of life. Man became, 
in effect, a detritivore, Homo colossus. Our species bloomed, and now we must expect a crash (of some sort) as the 
natural sequel” (p. 155). Lastly, Szerszynski attributes the designation Homo gubernans to the philosopher Michel Serres 
(1995, quoted in Szerszynski, 2012). 
299 The original source of Swyngedouw’s use of the term is a Power Point presentation held at the conference Sustained 
Unsustainability at the University of Bath on December 6, 2013. The presentation was entitled “Anthropocenic 
Promises. Interrogating Post-Democratization: Reclaiming the Political Environment.” Slide 6 provides a definition 
of the Oliganthropocene as “an epoch of few men and even fewer women.”

to a fraction of humanity (namely, the wealthiest and most energy-intense countries) rather than to all of it. 
They reject the use of ‘human species’ (viz. Homo sapiens) to identify the Anthropos of the ‘Anthropocene,’ 
denouncing “its effects on the type of ‘solutions’ that are proposed for ecological problems, whether they 
are legitimated or not in the narrative of the anthropocenologists” (p. 77).  
 
The rejection of the species-narrative had already been advanced by Bonneuil (2015) in an edited 
volume published the year before, together with philosopher Clive Hamilton and political scientist François 
Gemenne (Hamilton et al., 2015a). Bonneuil considers the Anthropos portrayed by natural sciences a 
“biological category, the ‘species’ or the ‘population’, rather than specific social groups bearing situated 
cultural values and taking particular socio-economic and technical decisions” (p. 19). In his view, Homo 
sapiens is implemented as a causal explanation of human history in a way that obscures the actual (historical 
and socio-economic) causal mechanisms that engendered the Anthropocene phenomenon. 
 
Criticism against attributing the dawn of the ‘Anthropocene’ to human nature has also been raised 
by human ecologists Andreas Malm and Alf Hornborg (2014). Examining the scientific literature on the 
‘Anthropocene’ (at that time still largely focused on the Industrial Revolution as a possible starting date for 
the Anthropocene), the authors deconstruct the notion of Homo sapiens arguing that “[s]team engines were 
not adopted by some natural-born deputies of the human species: by the nature of the social order of things, 
they could only be installed by the owners of the means of production,” who only represented “an 
infinitesimal fraction of the population of Homo sapiens in the early 19th century” (pp. 63–64). The bio-
geological portrayal of Anthropos given by the natural sciences is argued to be “oblivious to its [own] anti-
social tendencies” (p. 66), and to be ultimately analytically defective (other than ethically inefficient) because 
“[g]eologists, meteorologists and their colleagues are not necessarily well-equipped to study the sort of 
things that take place between humans” (ibid.). The Anthropocene is not causally determined by Anthropos 
(viz. Homo sapiens), but by specific societies, power relations, and modes of production related to a fossil-
based economy. 
A contributor to Moore’s (2016a) Capitalocene or Anthropocene?, Hartley (2016) observes that “[a]t 
the heart of the Anthropocene lies the Anthropos: the human. But what or who is this Anthropos? No clear 
definition is ever given” (p. 155). His argument, based on a Marxist reading of the ‘Anthropocene,’ 
denounces the historical blindness of the term, which presupposes an abstract notion of humanity “belying 
the reality of class struggle, exploitation, and oppression” (p. 156). In line with the criticism expressed by 
authors throughout Moore’s popular volume, it is the lack of historical depth – and the dangers entailed in 
burying the capitalist roots of the Anthropocene – that most concerns Hartley’s reading of the term. 
In addition to the historical and bio-geological questions, the issue of what Anthropos is represented 
in the ‘Anthropocene’ has also raised questions about gender. The archaeologist Alfredo González-Ruibal 
notes that, while humans need necessarily be acknowledged for their role, “we also have to acknowledge 
that the new geological era is not the work of generic humans, but of Man. It has been the Man of humanism 
– white, Western, male […] – that has created the critical conditions of our age. Yet the concept of 
Anthropocene conflates Man and human. It makes all humankind guilty of something for which many are

not – if anything, they are the victims” (p. 4). Similarly, the ecofeminist and environmental scholar Giovanna 
di Chiro (2017) stresses critically the predominantly male composition of the AWG, and the Global North 
provenance of most of its members300 – arguing that, “[m]irroring the race, gender, and class composition 
of other climate and environmental research and policy arenas, the Anthropocene might more appropriately 
be coined the Manthropocene” (p. 489). This type of discourse has consequences in terms of framing issues 
of environmental justice in ways that disregard the particular communities and groups historically and 
presently most afflicted by the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
 
All these examples converge in criticism of one or multiple implications of the portrayal of an 
undifferentiated Anthropos drawn by the natural sciences engaging with the ‘Anthropocene.’ To better frame 
and discuss this criticism in respect to the Anthropocene Hypothesis, it seems reasonable to express it as 
follows: 
 
UAA 
(Undifferentiated 
Anthropos 
Argument): 
The 
concept/discourse 
of 
‘Anthropocene’ postulates an undifferentiated and species-based notion of Anthropos that 
is historically inaccurate, ethically irresponsible, and analytically inefficient. 
 
There are several observations to be made about UAA, the first of which concerns the concept/discourse 
distinction. The humanities and social sciences have been addressing issues entailing both aspects of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ On the conceptual side, the term seemingly signifies too broad a category to provide any 
detailed representation of precisely who engendered the Anthropocene and how. However, there has been 
little research conducted from the perspectives of linguistics, philosophy of language, or theories of 
cognition and the mind regarding the status of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a concept. Since “[c]oncepts are the 
most fundamental constructs in theories of the mind,” raising “so many controversies in philosophy and 
cognitive science” (Margolis & Laurence, 1999, p. 3), further research in this direction in Anthropocene 
Studies is much needed – especially from critics of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. Multiple linguistic labels 
attributed to the term, from meta-concept to threshold concept and boundary object, make it even more 
problematic to represent the nature of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a concept.  
On the discursive side, it seemingly provides strong technical and managerial solutions to problems 
of mostly scientific rather than social, political, or ethical framing. For instance, Crist (2013) defines discourse 
as “the advocacy and elaboration of rationales favoring the term in scientific, environmental, popular 
writings, and other media. The advocacy and rationales communicate a cohesive though not entirely 
homogeneous set of ideas, which merits the label ‘discourse’” (p. 130). She then considers the 
‘Anthropocene’ discourse as “constituted by a blend of interweaving and recurrent themes, variously 
developed or emphasized by its different exponents,” noting that “the discourse goes well beyond the 
Anthropocene’s (probably uncontroversial) keystone rationale that humanity’s stratigraphic imprint would 
be discernible to future geologists” (ibid.). Her criticism of the ‘Anthropocene’ discourse as anthropocentric 
 
300 Di Chiro’s observations are based on the AWG composition as of February 4, 2016. 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
319 
 
is analyzed in section 5.1.2. Bonneuil (2015) also recognizes four different narratives or discourses within 
Anthropocene Studies, further proving the existence of the ‘Anthropocene’ discourse beyond its conceptual 
outline and perception among disciplines.  
 
The second observation concerns the exclusion of the past and present multiplicity of human 
modes of existence in defining the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, and informing its discourse, by postulating an 
undifferentiated Anthropos. This criticism does not simply address the apparent lack of a detailed socio-
historical and economic analysis of the Anthropocene phenomenon. It also concerns the past and present 
ways in which human societies have experienced (and are experiencing) the ‘Anthropocene’ – both as a 
concept and state of affairs. This is a particularly important question raised by anthropologists (e.g., 
Mathews, 2020) – that is, how do different systems of knowledge experience the Anthropocene? While 
every human society may not necessarily be engaging with the term or concept (which is, after all, a product 
of a specific knowledge system), the global extent of the phenomena that the ‘Anthropocene’ represents 
makes it a shared experience across human societies. Dissolving the past and present multiplicity of 
experiences under a single Anthropos means (according to UAA) privileging a particular viewpoint – that of 
a fundamentally Western Anthropos. 
 
A related, third observation addresses the species-based definition of Anthropos informing the 
‘Anthropocene’ concept/discourse. Many of the tensions between scientific and humanistic conceptions 
of the ‘Anthropocene’ stem from this specific framing. As criticized by Bonneuil (2015), “the ‘species’ or 
the ‘population’, rather than specific social groups bearing situated cultural values and taking particular 
socio-economic and technical decisions, is elevated to a causal explanatory category in the understanding 
of human history” (p. 19). This criticism aims at deconstructing the idea that Homo sapiens caused the 
‘Anthropocene’ in a deterministic, naturalized fashion. The historical and ethical implications of this 
criticism are explored in later sections. Here, it is important to note that UAA considers Homo sapiens the 
key conceptual tool making the ‘Anthropocene’ a defective concept/discourse.  
 
Does criticism raised by UAA also address the Anthropocene Hypothesis? That is, is the Anthropos 
postulated in the Anthropocene Hypothesis an efficient epistemic category? 
 
The Anthropocene Hypothesis is a stratigraphic hypothesis. As such, it adheres to the practices 
and methods of traditional stratigraphic classification. However, by posing the commencement of the 
proposed epoch as the 1950s, and by attributing humans causal and geological agency, the hypothesis 
necessarily merges with (recent) human affairs. This circumstance is at the core of much of the conceptual 
overlap between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Indeed, it seems that the 
hypothesis requires several layers of analysis – from history, anthropology, and sociology to economics, 
international law, and stratigraphy – that are far beyond the traditional epistemology of stratigraphy. These 
layers of analysis are also reflected in the broader ‘Anthropocene’ which, as a concept and discourse 
unrestricted to the quest of formal geological ratification, requires a broader understanding of the 
phenomenon beyond pure stratigraphy. Locating these layers of analysis is of primary importance in 
understanding the stratigraphy of the Anthropocene, and directing its research in a complementary way – 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
320 
 
as observed multiple times throughout this research. This is the case for the nuclear and thermonuclear 
bomb testing – an event associated with a substantial stratigraphic signal of major importance that has been 
also largely documented from a historical viewpoint. The recorded history of this event provides stratigraphy 
with additional explanatory power in framing phenomena of interest for the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
The multidisciplinary composition and method of the AWG has been one preliminary solution to 
the challenge of threading several layers of analysis together. This solution allows the generation of a 
research network around the Anthropocene Hypothesis that has been providing it with a certain degree of 
multidisciplinary explanatory power (as argued in section 4.2.2, the hypothesis does entail historical 
explanation as long as it is not taken in isolation, but within the research network that it has generated over 
the years). This network allows the AWG to explore research fields that would not (and could not) 
otherwise be part of traditional research interests within stratigraphy. Insofar as the historical research is 
seen as complementary, the Anthropos in the Anthropocene Hypothesis is not historically inaccurate. 
Another observation is also due. To argue that the Anthropos is historically inaccurate presupposes 
that the Anthropocene Hypothesis requires a high-grain and historically sound definition of Anthropos to 
achieve an explanation and understanding of certain phenomena. However, whether and to what extent the 
Anthropos should be historically accurate in order to achieve these epistemic goals is assessed against the 
epistemological framework of stratigraphy, rather than history. That is because the aim of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis is stratigraphic rather than historical. To request a thorough historical analysis 
within the Anthropocene Hypothesis is a knowledge-domain conflict: it is equal to requesting a stratigraphic 
classification of historical events such as the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Battle of Lepanto, the 
First World War, or the election of Donald Trump. Intuitively, none of these requires stratigraphy to be 
comprehended, because stratigraphy is an unnecessary epistemic framework for delivering an explanation 
and understanding of these phenomena and events. This is not to say that historical research should not be 
frameworks to use to comprehend the broader implications of the ‘Anthropocene’ phenomenon. Rather, 
it means that the ‘historical soundness’ of Anthropos in the Anthropocene Hypothesis is ultimately judged 
by the stratigraphic actors supporting (or rejecting) the hypothesis. 
Lastly, UAA claims that the notion of Anthropos in the ‘Anthropocene’ is ethically faulty, meaning 
that it avoids urgent questions of responsibility concerning both specific contributions to a certain 
undesirable state of affairs (i.e., the ‘Anthropocene’). This criticism holds for the ‘Anthropocene’ in the 
broader normative (viz. ethical and moral) arena, and has been a central theme in philosophical approaches 
to it (Dalby, 2007b; Polt & Wittrock, 2018; Raffnsøe, 2016; Zylinska, 2014). However, because the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis per se does not entail normative claims of an ethical fashion, ethical responsibility 
is not a necessary epistemic parameter for delineating the Anthropos in the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
Despite its implicit ethical overtone, amplified by popular culture as well as academic literature, the 
hypothesis does not provide any normative guidelines to follow, nor value-judgements connected to the 
stratigraphic signature of Homo sapiens. The hypothesis seeks to explain this anthropogenic signature, and 
to see possible ratification on the geological time scale – itself an organized system of knowledge that, 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
321 
 
disputes of a sociological nature aside, is not grounded on epistemic parameters of an ethical nature (i.e., it 
does not ask whether geological time units are ethically good or not). This is also one of the reasons behind 
the use of the broader epistemic category of Homo sapiens for delineating the Anthropos in the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis across literature (including the present research). This latter aspect needs further consideration. 
 
5.1.1.1 Homo sapiens in the Context of Stratigraphic Classification 
 
Does the species-based definition of Anthropos represent an analytical flaw for the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis? That is, is Homo sapiens an insufficient epistemic category, as argued by UAA?  
 
The answer to these questions depends on the type of explanation and understanding expected, 
which in turn depends on the specific disciplinary framework one is located within when raising such 
questions. Intuitively, Homo sapiens would be too broad a category in historical, sociological, or 
anthropological research – where the existence of a vast array of human cultures throughout the history of 
humanity is a defining epistemic premise that cannot be deduced from a broader, species-based category. 
However, because the Anthropocene Hypothesis seeks to explain the anthropogenic signature in 
stratigraphic terms, stratigraphy represents the reference framework determining whether or not the 
category of Homo sapiens is analytically flawed. This requires an understanding of the use of ‘Homo sapiens’ 
within stratigraphic classification. 
 Homo sapiens is the taxonomical label used in virtually all of the natural sciences, from evolutionary 
biology and genetics to comparative neuroanatomy and paleoanthropology, to separate (and locate in the 
larger ‘tree of life’) the anatomical and genetic traits that distinguish our species from other species, from 
other apes, and from earlier hominins301 (Carroll, 2003). The term was first used in 1758 by the Swedish 
botanist Carl Linnaeus (Tattersall, 2020) – renowned for developing the binomial nomenclature in 
biological taxonomy302 – in the tenth edition of his Systema naturae (Tattersall, 2020). Today, the term 
provides (not without debates on the matter) biological unity to all members of our species – so that all 
Anthropoi potentially share, in principle, the basic (descriptive) properties of Homo sapiens. 
Geology has never widely used the term – mostly because it did not need to. For instance, Charles 
Lyell’s (2003a, 2003b, 2003c) three-volume Principles of Geology does not seem to use the label ‘Homo sapiens,’ 
instead addressing humans simply as humans, or as the ‘human race’ or ‘human species.’ Discussions on 
the geological agency of humanity in 19th-century geological literature do not seem to engage with this label 
 
301 The term “‘hominins’ refers to humans and our evolutionary ancestors back to the separation of the human and 
ape lineages; ‘hominids’ to humans and the African apes” (Carroll, 2003, p. 849). 
302 Binomial nomenclature is a taxonomical system used to classify living organisms based on generic name (e.g., Homo) 
and specific name (e.g., sapiens). The system underpins the present nomenclature codes for algae, fungi, and plants 
(International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN)); animals (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature 
(ICZN)); bacteria and archaea (International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP)); cultivated plants (International 
Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP)); plant associations (International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature 
(ICPN)); and viruses (International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN)). See the Wikipedia page

either, despite the ‘proximity’ of geological time and historical time.303 With the discovery of the Earth’s 
true age, and the paleoanthropological research on humans’ lineage, geological and historical time further 
expanded, making Homo sapiens (either as a species or as a geological agent) somewhat ‘irrelevant’ in the 
reconstruction of the Earth’s history. Only with the onset of the ‘Anthropocene’ debates has the term Homo 
sapiens garnered substantial interest in the geological jargon.304 Why, then, select this category, given its 
seemingly scarce historical and theoretical application in geological research? 
One answer reiterates the fact that stratigraphy is not equipped “to study the sort of things that 
take place between humans” (Malm & Hornborg, 2014, p. 66) – as also recognized by critics of the 
‘Anthropocene’ concept. Because humans have occupied only an infinitesimal fraction of geological time, 
the study of the Earth’s history has mostly evolved (especially in the 20th century) without attributing to 
Homo sapiens any special role (except, perhaps, for biblical readings of geological time). Our species only 
represents one among countless species that have existed, and will exist, in the depth of the Earth’s history. 
While reconsidering humans’ geological agency through Homo sapiens perceived negatively by critics as “an 
attempt to conceptually traverse the gap between the natural and the social – already thoroughly fused in 
reality – through the construction of a bridge from one side only” (ibid.), it rather represents a condition 
grounded in the specific epistemology of stratigraphy. This supposed ‘deficiency’ is countered by 
establishing a research network that allows scholars to probe the multiple historical and cultural realities of 
Homo sapiens – something that stratigraphy alone does not (and cannot) do. 
Another possible answer looks at the historical epistemology of geology. Throughout the late 18th 
and 19th centuries, biology and geology formed a strong partnership. Both were at the forefront of 
imperialistic exploration (and colonial) initiatives. Especially during the 19th century, “the foundations of 
geology could scarcely be separated from biological concerns” (Davis, 2011, p. 79). Both geology and 
biology underwent major theoretical developments – uniformitarianism in geology, championed by Charles 
Lyell in his Principles of Geology,305 and biological evolution through natural selection, championed by Charles 
Darwin in his 1859 landmark publication The Origins of Species. Darwin himself was well versed in geology, 
and its role, contributions, and inspiration from and to the discipline have been recently revived (e.g., 
Herbert, 1986, 1991, 2005; Nature, 2009). Fossils represented material of scientific, philosophical, and 
theological interest for geologists, who speculated on the origins and age of fossils; and for biologists, who 
had begun to systematically classify past and present living organisms and speculate on the origins of life. 
Geology “provided the time scale and time frame in which evolution has been generated” (Leddra, 2010, 
p. 151) – a time frame consistent (after some initial resistance) with Darwin’s theory of evolution. 
Conversely, fossils provided geologists with the means to divide geological time, providing additional 
material to develop a relative time scale. This disciplinary partnership has continued to the present day. 
Indeed, modern chronostratigraphy uses biostratigraphic markers (usually the first appearance datum of a 
fossil species, see section 3.2.1.6) as primary markers for defining the base of chronostratigraphic units 
 
303 This does not mean that humans were not an object of geological discussion, which they were. See Davis (2011). 
304 With the exception of those instances of geological reflexivity briefly discussed in section 1.2.4. 
305 For a detailed history of geology during the 19th century, see Greene (1982). 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’

through GSSPs. Likewise, it is standard practice for evolutionary biologists (and natural scientists dealing 
with deep time) to use geological time as reference framework. This applies not simply to prehistoric 
species, but also to our very own Homo lineage – as exemplified by literature describing important 
evolutionary steps of Homo sapiens (e.g., a “marked increase in absolute brain size by the Early Pleistocene and 
again in the Middle Pleistocene,” Carroll, p. 851 [emphases added]). 
A third connected answer is that the use of Homo sapiens is a matter of frameworks. This point has 
also been noted by Chakrabarty (2009): 
 
It is clear that different academic disciplines position their practitioners differently with regard to 
the question of how to view the human being. All disciplines have to create their objects of study. 
If medicine or biology reduces the human to a certain specific understanding of him or her, 
humanist historians often do not realize that the protagonists of their stories—persons—are 
reductions, too. (p. 215) 
 
The ‘reduction’ of humans to Homo sapiens is only functional to the specific understanding that the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis aims at conveying. As long as this category is useful in providing “acceptable 
answers to interesting questions” (L. Laudan, 1977, p. 13), there is no reason for the hypothesis not to use 
this particular framing of humans. 
These short answers hint that selecting Homo sapiens as the preferred category underpinning the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis has been the most practical and natural choice by geologists and stratigraphers. 
The category resonates with the epistemology of stratigraphy, and with the linguistic developments in this 
field as a result of its partnership with other natural sciences, particularly biology. Nevertheless, attempts to 
employ a finer-grain lens of analysis while maintaining the Homo sapiens category have been advanced. For 
instance, ecological research authored by the environmental scientist and AWG member Erle Ellis (2011a, 
2015, 2016b; Ellis et al., 2009; Ellis et al., 2013; Ellis & Ramankutty, 2008) attempts to map the present 
relationship between Homo sapiens and ecosystems in terms of anthropogenic biomes or ‘anthromes.’ A 
biome is a basic ecological concept historically “identified and mapped based on general differences in 
vegetation type associated with regional variations in climate” (Ellis & Ramankutty, 2008, p. 439). 
Anthromes represent biomes shaped and characterized by human actions, and they “offer a framework for 
incorporating humans directly into global ecosystem models” (p. 446). They provide the stratigraphic 
category of Homo sapiens with ecological foundations (especially because anthropogenic stratigraphic signals 
are also ecological signatures) by implementing time-sensitive indicators such as population density, land use, 
and land cover. In fact, Ellis (2011a) hypothesizes that “changes in the terrestrial biosphere made directly 
by human populations and their use of land represent the emergence of a suite of novel geologic processes 
in the Earth system comparable in scale with those used to justify the major divisions of geologic time” 
(pp. 1010–1011). These changes include alterations of “patterns of soil erosion, soil and sediment chemistry, 
sedimentation rates, isotope signatures, charcoal, artificial substances, and plant and animal remains” (p. 
1017) – all of which may reflect stratigraphic evidence for the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
324 
 
As Ellis (2016b) argues, the “capacity of human societies to construct their ecological niche at 
increasing social and spatial scales” (p. 63) represents the explanation of why Homo sapiens (rather than other 
species) has become such a predominant geological agent. This explanation is grounded in the epistemology 
of stratigraphy (because of the emphasis placed on stratigraphic markers) and eco-evolutionary biology. 
Particularly, human niche construction (Boivin et al., 2016; Ersten et al., 2016; Kendal et al., 2011a, 2011b; 
Laland et al., 2001) provides a useful framework to ensure that the category of Homo sapiens (as used in the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis) does ultimately entail epistemic power beyond the mere taxonomical label 
because it poses central questions about the relationship between humans and their surroundings – which 
have now extended to planetary scales. While historians have criticized this deduction of human 
transformative power from humans’ outstanding niche-constructing capacities, this analysis neither 
contradicts nor contrasts with the historical analysis. It simply complements it from a different 
epistemological framework. This framework does not raise questions of a strictly historical, social, or ethical 
nature because Homo sapiens represents a descriptive category, implemented within a determined system of 
knowledge (that of the natural sciences). It is not meant to answer broader philosophical questions of an 
existential, social, or political nature (despite the fact that it might raise them) – lest it commit the naturalistic 
fallacy. 
Hence, if Homo sapiens can be further dissected in a way that aligns with the practices and language 
of stratigraphy (for instance, through evolutionary ecology) while also providing new knowledge, it seems 
reasonable to infer that Homo sapiens is not analytically flawed. If so, then based on the previous analysis of 
the sub-arguments informing UAA, it can be argued that UAA does not hold for the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. 
 
5.1.2 The Anthropocentrism Argument 
 
Another common argument against the ‘Anthropocene’ accuses the concept/narrative of being 
anthropocentric. This critique accuses the term of investing humans with an unjustified and alarming form 
of exceptionality. Authors have considered the ‘Anthropocene’ idea the “latest incarnation of 
anthropocentric thinking” (Suckling, 2014), or even “supreme narcissism” (Jensen, 2013). In what ways is 
the ‘Anthropocene’ anthropocentric? Should the Anthropocene Hypothesis also be considered 
anthropocentric? To answer these questions, one has to look at what makes any concept and/or narrative 
anthropocentric in first place.  
 
While anti-anthropocentrism has become a theoretical and methodological postulate and goal for 
the great majority of environmental scholars, the meaning of ‘anthropocentrism’ is in fact more problematic 
than is often acknowledged. This is mostly because many connotations of the term exist, rendering it 
difficult, if not vague, to contest ‘anthropocentrism’ without specifying which kind is being considered.306 
 
306 For a list of possible meanings of ‘anthropocentrism’ in academic literature, see Mylius (2018). 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
325 
 
Therefore, defining anthropocentrism is paramount in assessing criticism against the ‘Anthropocene’ and 
determining whether or not such criticism holds for the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
Debating and deconstructing ethical anthropocentrism – according to environmental ethics, the 
philosophical doctrine or “belief that value is human-centered and that all other beings are means to human 
ends” (Kopnina et al., 2018, p. 109) – has become an overarching goal across disciplines such as 
ecocriticism, environmental history, ethnography, postcolonial studies, and environmental philosophy. 
Debunking narratives of traditional humanism is also the purposes of recent intellectual movements such 
as posthumanism or neo-materialism. Particularly in contemporary environmental ethics, the discussion 
between anthropocentrism and non-anthropocentrism has been central at least since Lynn White’s (1967) 
radical article “The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis,” which famously criticized Christianity 
(especially in its ‘Western’ guise) as “the most anthropocentric religion the world has seen” (p. 1205) and 
modern science and technology as the “Occidental, voluntarist realization of the Christian dogma of man’s 
transcendence of, and rightful mastery over, nature” (p. 1206). The idea that anthropocentric worldviews, 
and particularly the Judeo-Christian tradition, were responsible for the present global environmental 
predicament “has been most enthusiastically received by environmentalists and environmental scholars” 
(Minteer & Manning, 2005, p. 164), who use it to construe alternative, more inclusive ethical systems (e.g., 
systems ascribing non-human animals ethical status).  
Ethical anthropocentrism is not the only type of anthropocentric. The environmental political 
theorist Tim Hayward (1997) considers anthropocentrism to be a problem that is largely misunderstood. 
He recognizes different types of anthropocentrism, noting that “there are some ways in which humans 
cannot help being human-centered” (p. 51). Based on Ferré (1994), he defines this view as perspectival 
anthropocentrism. This is the same type of anthropocentrism recognized by political philosopher Ben Mylius 
(2018) as a perceptual anthropocentrism – namely, an anthropocentrism that “is directly or indirectly informed 
by data received or gathered by the senses of the human body” (p. 166). It represents a type of 
anthropocentrism wired to the neurocognitive and evolutionary functions and characteristics distinctive of 
Homo sapiens, and therefore unobjectionable. Perspectival or perceptual anthropocentrism is descriptive – 
that is, it is a form of anthropocentrism that is neither good nor bad, but simply explains what makes forms 
of human-centeredness unavoidable; it is “it is ‘centered upon’ Homo sapiens or the concept of ‘the human’ 
in one (or many) ways” (ibid.). Hayward (1997) argues that recognition of the inescapability of some forms 
of human-centeredness makes the equation between human-centeredness and anthropocentrism untenable 
– if anthropocentrism is considered undesirable. Instead, he suggests using the terms ‘speciesism’ or ‘human 
chauvinism’ – the former representing arbitrary and unjustified discrimination on the basis of species, the 
latter representing the arbitrary, unjustified, and self-proclaimed superiority of human characteristics, 
functions, or capabilities (e.g., language, opposable thumbs, abstract thinking) in a way that favors humans 
themselves – as better representatives of “illegitimate ways of giving preferences to human interests” (p. 
53). 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
326 
 
 
Hayward also notes a second type of anthropocentrism (in addition to ethical anthropocentrism) 
usually criticized by environmental ethicists – that is, ontological anthropocentrism. This doctrine “assumes 
human-centeredness and the privileged position of human beings” and “claims a superior ontological 
position of human beings and perceives them as the pinnacle of creation” (Dzwonkowska, 2018, p. 724). 
Biblical geocentric cosmological models,307 the Intelligent Design argument, or human exceptionality in the 
universe are examples of ontological anthropocentrism. Ontological anthropocentrism does not necessarily 
entail ethical anthropocentrism, and vice versa (although they might support each other). To claim that 
humans are the physical center of the universe and creation does not imply that humans are the highest 
ethical subject. Conversely, being the highest ethical subject does not require that humans occupy a 
particular ontological position in the universe or creation. Hayward (1997) considers ontological 
anthropocentrism an “error” (p. 49) or “mistake” (p. 50). While his concerns mostly address ethical 
anthropocentrism, he also argues that the ontological “displacement of human beings from the center stage 
in the greater scheme of things has been made possible, above all, by developments in modern science” 
(ibid.) – characterized by a principle of objectivity and neutrality (sensu lato) that debunked humans’ 
ontological primacy and their place in the universe. Copernicus’s heliocentric model or Darwin’s theory of 
evolution by natural selection are common examples of such developments. 
 
A third kind of anthropocentrism concerns epistemological anthropocentrism. As defined by the 
ecologist and philosopher Dominika Dzwonkowska (2018), this type of anthropocentrism “is directly 
connected with our cognitive capabilities, which are limited to knowing the world from our perspective 
only” (p. 726), and thus cannot be overcome. This formulation seems to equate epistemological 
anthropocentrism to perspectival or perceptual anthropocentrism. However, because epistemology, by 
definition, concerns the nature, structure, and value of knowledge, to reduce knowledge only to perceptual 
or sensorial capabilities (only one of the characteristics of knowledge) does not intimately grasp the meaning 
of epistemology. Thus, epistemological anthropocentrism should not be equated to sensorial 
perceptual/perspectival anthropocentrism – despite the latter as a precondition for the former. Rather, 
epistemological anthropocentrism implies that all human knowledge (regardless of its specific historical or 
cultural system) is necessarily anthropocentric: “human beings are such that the limits and form of their 
knowledge necessarily takes a human reference” (Faria & Paez, 2014, p. 100). It takes a further step from 
delimiting the sensorial limits of humans to defining the epistemic limits of humans. Epistemological 
anthropocentrism shares similarities with Mylius’s (2018) descriptive anthropocentrism because they both 
emphasize knowledge claims of a descriptive nature (statements of fact rather than statements of value) – 
despite the fact that epistemological anthropocentrism may also include value judgements. Descriptive 
 
307 It should be noted that placing humans at the center of the universe does not immediately translate into ontological 
anthropocentrism. One has to first account for the historical and social context wherein certain geocentric 
cosmological models were formulated based on the evidence and observations available at the time. Likewise, placing 
the Sun at the center of the solar system may be based on extra-empirical considerations, or on intentionally biased 
accounts of a descriptive nature (see Mylius, 2018). Additionally, religious forms of anthropocentrism may perhaps be 
better characterized as metaphysical anthropocentrism, in that they postulate metaphysical causes for the ontological 
primacy of humans (e.g., humans are created after the image of a God). Ontological anthropocentrism, while 
conceptually (and historically) close to metaphysical anthropocentrism, does not necessarily entail metaphysical claims. 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
327 
 
anthropocentrism “begins from, revolves around, focusses on, takes as its reference point, is centered 
around, or is ordered according to the species Homo sapiens or the category of ‘the human’” (p. 168). 
Epistemological anthropocentrism represents a vast research theme shared across traditional and social 
epistemology, cognitive science, psychology, neurobiology, theory of mind, and more. For this reason alone, 
the definition hereby adopted is unlikely to encompass all existing formulations of epistemological (or 
epistemic) anthropocentrism identified by scholars. In the present context, it is only relevant to observe 
that (1) it is directly related, but not equivalent to perspectival/perceptual anthropocentrism; (2) it represent 
an unavoidable, but not immutable form of anthropocentrism (i.e., knowledge systems vary over time but 
remain human frameworks nevertheless); and (3) it may represent an epistemic obstacle if, and only if, 
enforced normatively (e.g., claiming that a determined human system of knowledge is better than any other 
human or non-human system of knowledge;308 or that only human knowledge is true knowledge). 
 
Ethical, perspectival/perceptual, ontological, and epistemological anthropocentrism represent four 
common types of anthropocentrism engendering discussions about the place of humans on the Earth. 
These should not be considered as conclusive, nor as reflecting all possible formulations of 
anthropocentrism recognized by scholars. Moreover, some authors (Dzwonkowska, 2018; Hayward, 1997; 
Mylius, 2018) warn that many of the discussions on anthropocentrism are substantially of a terminological 
nature: they depend on the semantic characterization and basic definition given to articulate discussions of 
anthropocentrism. Nevertheless, these considerations provide a basic conceptual toolkit for navigating 
criticism of the ‘Anthropocene’ based on claims of anthropocentrism. 
It was perhaps natural for scholars enmeshed in anti-anthropocentric intellectual, political, and 
social agendas to express concerns about the idea of naming the latest epoch of the Earth’s history after 
humanity. In practical terms, this skepticism has been fueled by translation of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
designation into the ‘Age of Man,’ ‘Age of Humans,’ or ‘Human Age’ – either by academics (e.g., Braje, 
2016; Kress & Stine, 2017; Monastersky, 2015; Neimanis et al., 2015) or in the media (e.g., Kolbert, 2019; 
Sample, 2014) – and by its association with technology- and economic-oriented solutions proposed within 
the broader social and political arena to face the current environmental challenges (e.g., geoengineering, as 
originally advocated by Crutzen). Skepticism soon transformed into criticism and rejections of the 
‘Anthropocene’ as a concept/discourse crystallizing anthropocentrism in geological terms. Here are some 
examples. 
 
308 This example touches on the vast research landscape conducted in the post-Kuhnian history and philosophy of 
science concerning the idea of scientific progress and the incommensurability of scientific theories. The term 
‘incommensurability’ was popularized in the philosophy of science by the work of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend. 
In short, the idea behind incommensurability is that different scientific theories, and especially successive theories, 
cannot be compared with one another because they share no common measure to allow comparison (see Hacking, 
2012, pp. xxx-xxxiii). No scientific theory is, properly speaking, ‘better’ than another because they may have a different 
set of problems, methods, and language that do not provide rational and equal ground for preferring one over the 
other. Within this framework, epistemological anthropocentrism is considering one theory or hypothesis T1 to be 
better than another T2 based exclusively on the internal values of T1 – which is equivalent to saying that T1 is better 
than T2 because it is T1 (circular reasoning). 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
328 
 
Crist (2013) argues that the ‘Anthropocene’ “has morphed into a discourse that is organizing the 
perception of a world picture (past, present, and future) through a set of ideas and prescriptions that is 
tenaciously anthropocentric” (p. 129). These ideas and prescriptions are articulated in a variety of ways 
among different knowledge contexts, from environmental ethics to the natural sciences. They emphasize 
the role of humanity (as a whole) in engendering today’s environmental challenges, and promote techno-
managerial solutions that adhere to the existing modes of production oriented toward economic growth 
and well-being. For Crist, these assumptions and prescriptions render the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept/discourse fundamentally anthropocentric. She argues that 
 
this name [the ‘Anthropocene’] is neither a useful conceptual move nor an empirical no-brainer, 
but instead a reflection and reinforcement of the anthropocentric actionable worldview that 
generated “the Anthropocene” – with all its looming emergencies […] By affirming the centrality 
of man – as both causal force and subject of concern – the Anthropocene shrinks the discursive 
space for challenging the domination of the biosphere, offering instead a techno-scientific pitch for 
its rationalization and a pragmatic plea for resigning ourselves to its actuality. The very concept of 
the Anthropocene crystallizes human dominion […] a name which has no added substantive 
content, no specific empirical or ethical overtones, no higher vision ensconced within it – beyond 
just Anthropos defining a geological epoch. (pp. 129, 141–142) 
 
This criticism addresses a range of descriptive and normative facets that the concept/discourse of 
‘Anthropocene’ seems to lack or obscure by promoting (an undifferentiated) Anthropos as central actor – 
both as causal agent and ultimate steward – of the ‘Anthropo-stage.’ 
 
Similarly, environmental historian Timothy J. LeCain (2015) has argued that, “[w]hile perhaps not 
the intent of its creators and advocates, the term itself is unapologetically anthropocentric” (p. 3). In his 
paper “Against the Anthropocene,” the author explores the concept/discourse of ‘Anthropocene’ from a 
neo-materialist perspective. Neo-materialism (or new materialism) is a type of post-humanist philosophy 
aiming at reconsidering materiality by challenging “the still dominant modernist belief that human culture 
is distinctly separate from the material world, suggesting that matter not only helps to create human 
intelligence, creativity, and culture, but may often be best understood as constituting these things” (p. 2). This 
stance considers human culture as a product of the material world, rather than as a dissociation from it. 
Consistent with this methodological assumption is a strong anti-anthropocentric agenda that rejects the 
traditional humanist philosophies (intended as human-centered systems of knowledge), but also rejects 
postmodern social constructivist theorizing.  
Through this theoretical framework, LeCain argues that the ‘Anthropocene’ “tends to encourage 
the hubristic modernist faith in the human ability to fix the resulting problems” (p. 4). According to the 
historian, this tendency is exemplified by the ‘Good vs. Bad Anthropocene’ dispute that occurred between 
environmental journalist Andrew Revkin and philosopher Clive Hamilton (Hamilton, 2014a, 2014b; 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
329 
 
Revkin, 2014a, 2014c).309 LeCain considers the eco-pragmatist arguments310 for a ‘Good Anthropocene’ “as 
a logical extension of the essential anthropocentrism of the concept itself” (p. 4), which is fundamentally 
possible by emphasizing humans’ geological agency. By doing son, LeCain argues that “we begin to 
overestimate human power and agency, tending towards a celebratory stance even when the intent is to be 
critical” (ibid.).311 This seemingly implicit celebratory stance parts ways with a neo-materialist perspective, 
which “argues that we humans derive much of what we like to think of as our power, intelligence, and 
creativity, from the material things around us” (ibid.). For LeCain, the intrinsic anthropocentrism of the 
‘Anthropocene’ does not decentralize humans, but rather emphasizes their agency at the expense of the 
material world. If so, then other terminological substitutes, such as Carbocene or Thanatocene, may provide 
“a more modest understanding of the human place on the planet” (p. 23).312 
 
In an essay published on the Law & Liberty website, environmental historian Paul Schwennesen 
(2020) criticizes the use of the term ‘dominance’ to address the relationship between humans and the 
Earth.313 He argues that defining the ‘Anthropocene’ in terms of human dominance over planetary 
processes “does two things: first, it gratifies our aching human desire to believe in our own centrality. 
Second, it opens the lid to a Pandora’s box of political controls – a field where dominance has more than 
abstract relevance.” Our centrality is exalted if compared to the biological, chemical, and geological 
‘dominance’ of organisms such as cyanobacteria, or by natural events such as volcanic eruptions which 
would have equal if not larger impact than human activity. For Schwennesen, the naming choice as well as 
the ‘dominance’ rhetoric are largely grounded on political convenience, so that “our ‘unprecedented’ 
impacts must be reined in by our governors, and quickly, there’s no time to lose.”  
 
309 The dispute saw Revkin advocating for the possibility of envisioning a ‘Good Anthropocene’ – one driven by a 
positive attitude and amazement about the possibility of tackling the current environmental issues, thereby generating 
a brighter ‘Anthropocene’ future; and Hamilton considering the idea of a ‘Good Anthropocene’ delusional and 
“unscientific” (Hamilton, 2014a). The dispute is exquisitely narrativized in a paper by the geographer and 
environmental scholar Simon Dalby (2016). 
310 According to Hamilton (2014b), eco-pragmatism is a ‘neogreen’ movement gravitating around the Breakthrough 
Institute – an environmental research center and think tank based in Oakland, California, that emphasizes technical 
solutions to environmental problems. The movement is enthusiastic about technological and scientific progress, and 
about the possibility of achieving a ‘Good Anthropocene’ by means of economic growth, innovation, and 
scientific/technological development. 
311 This argument seems to suggest that attributing Homo sapiens geological agency is an overestimation of the species’ 
geological relevance, and that necessarily implies a type of celebratory stance (exemplified by the eco-pragmatism 
movement and the ‘Good Anthropocene’ idea). While the latter point needs further consideration within the 
normative arena, overestimations of the geological significance of Homo sapiens are countered by distinguishing 
between geological forces and geological agents. This distinction (promoted in section 3.1.1) helps clarify what type of 
geological significance our species represents without falling into risk of overestimation. 
312 This criticism also suggests a problem of a nominalist nature. It is not solely the content of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept/discourse, but its signifier that represents an issue. 
313 Schwennesen is directly referring to an article published by Paul Crutzen and Christian Schwäger on the Yale School 
of the Environment website, where the authors define the Anthropocene as a reality characterized by “human 
dominance 
of 
biological, 
chemical 
and 
geological 
processes 
on 
Earth” 
(https://e360.yale.edu/features/living_in_the_anthropocene_toward_a_new_global_ethos, accessed on September

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
330 
 
 
The criticisms sampled here converge in arguing against the seemingly hubristic and 
anthropocentric connotation of the ‘Anthropocene.’ The following argument may summarize this type of 
criticism: 
 
AA (Anthropocentrism Argument): The concept/discourse of ‘Anthropocene’ 
promotes forms of ontological, epistemological, and ethical anthropocentrism by affirming 
the centrality of humans as a dominant (geological, biological, and ecological) force. 
 
Two observations clarify the thesis advanced by AA. The first observation concerns the types of 
anthropocentrism that AA attributes to the ‘Anthropocene.’ Elevating the status of Homo sapiens to a 
geological force is problematic in several respects, as also argued in section 3.1.1. To further claim that 
humans have become a dominant geological force is, for critics of the term, an evident sign of ontological 
anthropocentrism. It is a way to help assuage “our sense of yawning insignificance” (Schwennesen, 2020) 
in light of the depth of geological time – of which Homo sapiens only occupies an infinitesimal fraction.  
 
Epistemological anthropocentrism seemingly appears by humans’ placement at the center of 
knowledge production about the ‘Anthropocene.’ This is partially inevitable because, as previously 
observed, humans cannot avoid generating human knowledge. However, the epistemic anthropocentrism of 
the ‘Anthropocene’ concept/discourse manifests itself in (1) neglecting more-than-human types of 
knowledge (Haraway, 2015; Swanson et al., 2015), (2) flattening different experiences of the Anthropocene 
(Chatterjee, 2020; Hecht, 2018; Kwai-Cheung & Yeung, 2019), and (3) framing the discourse exclusively in 
geological terms (Bostic & Howey, 2017; Ellis, 2016a).  
 
Ethical anthropocentrism is closely tied to the seemingly hubristic rhetoric of stewardship – one 
that sees humans both as the fundamental threat to the Earth’s stability and at the same time its ultimate 
solution by means of technology and human-focused well-being (Dalby, 2007b; Neimanis et al., 2015; 
Robin, 2018; Zylinska, 2014). Concerns over the ethical usefulness of the term are considered separately in 
section 5.1.4. 
 
The second observation concerns the meaning of ‘dominant force,’ and more precisely the 
definition of ‘dominant.’ As also observed by Schwennesen (2020), the way ‘dominance’ is defined has 
several implications for what the ‘Anthropocene’ entails semantically. The Cambridge Dictionary314 defines 
the verb ‘to dominate’ as “to have control over a place or person.” Its etymology (from the Latin dominus: 
lord, master; and dominat-; ruled, governed) also suggests proximity with ‘control,’ generally to the advantage 
of the one who is dominating. These are common linguistic expressions in Anthropocene literature 
portraying the role and agency of humans with respect to the Earth System, climate change, the sixth 
extinction event, and in the geo-stratigraphical context. However, if exercising dominance with respect to 
something means to be in control in a way that those exercising control are better off, then humans (collectively) are 
clearly not dominating the Earth. The rationale is simple: if the ‘Anthropocene’ is a worse state for humans 
 
314 https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/dominate (accessed on July 5, 2021). 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
331 
 
than what came before, and if the ‘Anthropocene’ is a product of human actions, then humans are not 
controlling (and thus not dominating) the Earth or the Earth System – because dominating requires those 
exercising control to be better off as a result. An example may illustrate this point: a drunken driver is 
neither dominating nor controlling their car, nor are they better off (in principle) in driving under the 
influence of alcohol – although they represent the primary causal (and eventually legal) agent of the present 
and possible future state of the car. Furthermore, if dominating (and controlling) requires consciousness of 
the act of dominating (and controlling), then humans have been only indirectly influencing the Earth System 
both from a historical and present viewpoint. Recent reactive and proactive responses from international 
agencies, NGOs, governments, and movements worldwide may be interpreted as a step toward controlling 
the Earth’s status. 
 
Linguistic digressions aside, humans appear dominant in the same way they appear as a geological 
force, while instead they are best represented as a geological agent – as also argued in section 3.1.1. Feasibly, 
the ‘dominant’ designation represents a figure of speech fraught with normative value. Nevertheless, this 
note is important to understand much of the criticism against the ontological status of humans advanced 
by AA.  
Does criticism raised by AA also address the Anthropocene Hypothesis? 
 
The distinction between different types of anthropocentrism raises important questions concerning 
the very nature of human knowledge, and requires a separate analysis beyond the scope of this research. In 
virtue of the evolutionary history and basic cognitive capabilities that define our species, it is reasonable to 
argue that it is unavoidable to incur some form of perspectival anthropocentrism. That is true for the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis as for any other form of human thought. However, the more pressing matter 
concerns forms of ontological and epistemological anthropocentrism of the ‘Anthropocene,’ and how these 
may reverberate in the formulation of the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
 
Is the Anthropocene Hypothesis ontologically anthropocentric? As observed, accusations of 
ontological anthropocentrism raised by AA largely gravitate around considerations of humans as a dominant 
geological force. Scientists and scholars around the AWG (and the broader environmental discourse) have 
themselves repeatedly portrayed humans as such (Crutzen & Stoermer, 2000; Robin & Steffen, 2007; 
Rockström et al., 2009b; Steffen et al., 2011b; Steffen et al., 2004b; Zalasiewicz et al., 2011b; Zalasiewicz et 
al., 2008b). As mentioned, this label is more often used as an informal and normative-oriented metaphor 
than a precisely defined epistemic category. However, there are reasons for arguing that the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis neither presupposes nor implies ontological anthropocentrism.  
Firstly, because Claim 1 – that is, ‘Homo sapiens has left a discernible stratigraphic signature of 
significant magnitude in the recent geological history’ – is a descriptive statement. If descriptive statements 
are in principle value-free, and if ontological anthropocentrism entails value judgements, then it follows 
that Claim 1 is in principle not (ontologically) anthropocentric. Nevertheless, being descriptive alone does 
not shield Claim 1 (and thus the hypothesis) from being anthropocentric per se because descriptive 
statements are not always value-free. In fact, there are always degrees and types of value entailed in any 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
332 
 
description because they are always part of a determined system of beliefs that is never purely ‘neutral.’ It 
is because Homo sapiens so happens to be the species that has left a discernible stratigraphic signature in the 
most recent geological history that makes it non-(ontologically) anthropocentric.315 Homo sapiens is not 
attributed a certain status (in this case, geological agency) because of its being Homo sapiens (which is the 
characteristic sin of ontological anthropocentrism). Claim 1 could be reformulated as ‘X has left a 
discernible stratigraphic signature of significant magnitude in the recent geological history,’ where X would 
represent any other species whose stratigraphic signature were substantial enough to delineate a boundary 
on the geological time scale (in which case, probably the designation ‘Anthropo-cene’ would be replaced by 
‘X-cene,’ or by the standard stratotype designations for geological nomenclature). 
 
A second reason why the Anthropocene Hypothesis neither presupposes nor implies ontological 
anthropocentrism is because the hypothesis considers Homo sapiens a geological agent rather than a geological 
force. This distinction avoids the issue of ontological anthropocentrism because it does not elevate humans 
to the same ‘ontological class’ as those geological forces that have been shaping the Earth for millions to 
billions of years. Furthermore, the Anthropocene Hypothesis does not strictly require humans to represent 
a geological force as a theoretical postulate to advance its core arguments. It so happens to assume this 
designation within the broader recognition of stratigraphic anthropogenic patterns observed across the 
globe. Whether or not humans are considered a geological force, the stratigraphic basis for upholding each 
of the three central claims of the Anthropocene Hypothesis is the empirical body required to support the 
arguments advanced by the hypothesis. The same is true for considering humans a dominant biological and 
ecological force. Naturally, this does not negate nor diminish the spectrum and gravity of anthropogenic 
disruption of the Earth, its biota, and its ecosystems. 
 
A last reason concerns geologists’ awareness of humans’ existential contingency. This is particularly 
clear once Homo sapiens is placed in the context of geological and biological time – a time scale geologists 
are very accustomed with. A basic tenet of evolutionary biology is that the “morphological evolution in 
hominins was not special, but the product of genetic and developmental changes typical of other mammals 
and animals” (Carroll, 2003, p. 852). Darwin’s famous narcissistic wound was only doubled by the discovery 
of geological time during the 20th century. Transcriptions of the ‘Anthropocene’ into the ‘Age of Humans’ 
(or similar variants) have been considered by the AWG to be “in some respects misleading” (Zalasiewicz 
et al., 2019b, p. 3) in framing the Anthropocene as a geological time unit, in that the epoch “is considered 
as an epoch of Earth time, just like all Earth’s previous epochs” (ibid.). It is neither teleology nor necessity 
that defines the Anthropocene time unit – it “so happens its distinctive characteristics have up until now 
been driven largely by a variety of human actions” (ibid.). There is no ontological primacy ascribed to Homo 
sapiens in the Anthropocene Hypothesis, but rather observations of the stratigraphic effects of its (most 
recent) existence. 
 
315 It is important to note that the fact Homo sapiens so happens to be the species under scrutiny does not lead to any 
determinism. As historians have rightfully noted, it is not because of being Homo sapiens that certain social 
organizations, energy regimes, or modes of production have contributed (more than others) to the dawn of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
333 
 
 
Is the Anthropocene Hypothesis epistemically anthropocentric? Criticism of epistemological 
anthropocentrism raises the questions on (1) what framework generates the very knowledge about the 
‘Anthropocene,’ and on (2) the issue of reflexivity (i.e., humans studying human affairs) in assessing the 
stratigraphic footprint of our own species.  
 
The former point concerns who is advancing the hypothesis. This criticism has been raised against 
the ‘Anthropocene’ in light of exclusion of particular knowledge systems – e.g., the ‘African Anthropocene’ 
(Hecht, 2018) or the ‘Asian Anthropocene’ (Chatterjee, 2020) – or criticism against ‘White Geology’ 
(Yusoff, 2019). This criticism does not so much attribute anthropocentrism to the category of Homo sapiens 
or Anthropos, but rather to the mostly ‘Western,’ male, and white-dominant epistemology informing and 
implementing these categories. These are complex issues stemming from recent scholarship in feminist, 
black, or indigenous epistemology. However, there has not been (as of March 2021) substantial empirical 
work of a sociological, psychological, or educational nature to assess how these epistemologies would affect 
the methodologies of stratigraphy316 (e.g., how gender or ethnicity would affect the construction of the 
geological time scale and stratigraphic classification). This lack is reinforced by the general broader interest 
in the ‘Anthropocene’ rather than the Anthropocene Hypothesis, manifested in the humanistic engagement 
in Anthropocene Studies (also confirmed by the almost utter absence of a philosophy of science in the 
debating arena). Thus, any assessment on the matter would necessarily be premature – although crucial for 
a thorough analysis of the Anthropocene Hypothesis from multiple epistemologies. 
 
The issue of reflexivity concerns what the hypothesis is arguing. The issue occurs in measuring the 
stratigraphic footprint of Homo sapiens. How are humans to measure their own stratigraphic signature 
without risking over- or underestimating its empirical and epistemological significance? One way that 
research on the Anthropocene Hypothesis has overcome this theoretical dilemma is by comparing 
quantitatively the products of human activity with those of natural processes – for instance, in terms of 
energy flow (Syvitski et al., 2020), material flow (Douglas & Lawson, 2001), denudation rates (Wilkinson, 
2005), nitrogen fixation (Canfield et al., 2010), or niche-constructing activities of other species (Ersten et 
al., 2016; Kendal et al., 2011a, 2011b; Odling-Smee et al., 2003). These numerical proxies provide a basis 
for comparative analysis between human agency and geological (and biological) forces to assess the 
stratigraphic significance and importance of Homo sapiens. A second argument, which has been used both 
for and against the Anthropocene Hypothesis, is the ‘future geologist argument’ – that is, speculating how 
future geologists would assess present anthropogenic stratigraphic signatures. This argument is separately 
discussed in section 5.2.1.  
If epistemological anthropocentrism “begins from, revolves around, focusses on, takes as its 
reference point, is centered around, or is ordered according to the species Homo sapiens or the category of 
‘the human’” (Mylius, 2018), it seems at first plausible to consider the Anthropocene Hypothesis (in virtue 
of its claims) epistemologically anthropocentric. However, as previously noted, it is precisely the adoption 
 
316 If compared, for instance, to the examples of primatology (see Godfrey-Smith, 2003, para. 9.3) or developmental 
psychology (e.g., Carol Gilligan’s work on In a Different Voice, 1982).  

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
334 
 
of the evolutionary and taxonomical category of Homo sapiens that overcomes epistemological 
anthropocentrism of this kind. ‘Homo sapiens’ provides a sufficient epistemic detachment that allows us to 
study it from a geological and stratigraphic viewpoint in the same way it allows evolutionary eco-biology or 
genetics to study ourselves as a species. From this viewpoint, the hypothesis provides evidence suggesting 
an objective stratigraphic pool of signals that cannot be ignored in stratigraphic classification. Consequently, 
there is nothing ontologically special about Homo sapiens, its geological agency, or its stratigraphic signals, but 
there are rather characteristics that make it geologically and stratigraphically interesting. This point is 
articulated by Ellis (2011a): 
 
Humans differ profoundly from every other species in the way we transform ecosystems, and our 
differences are partly responsible for our large populations. Three differences stand out. First, 
humans are ecosystem engineers – species like the beaver that alter their environment by mechanical 
or other means. Second, we are capable of manipulating a wide array of powerful tools in this effort, 
including fire. Third, we are social creatures capable of collective action and social learning in our 
ecosystem engineering and other activities. Separately, none of these capacities is novel in the history 
of the biosphere. It is their realization within a single species that has driven the rise and evolution 
of human systems that are far more complex, powerful and novel in the biosphere than even the 
sum of their billions of individual human parts. Even with a population of seven billion, Homo 
sapiens is not an entirely novel force of nature. But human systems are. (pp. 1011–1012) 
 
Epistemological anthropocentrism is an issue that largely depends on terminology, and thus risks becoming 
a mere nominalistic dead end. What is important to highlight is that the Anthropocene Hypothesis does 
not seem to entail this type of anthropocentrism as long as the very epistemology upholding the hypothesis 
does not emphasize Homo sapiens solely because it happens to be the species we are, with implicit 
repercussions about who is advocating for the hypothesis, and what the hypothesis is advancing. While this 
may look trivial, the issue of reflexivity (which is often proportional to how close certain issues involving 
human affairs are to the present) is a problem that, while common in disciplines such as sociology, 
psychology, or history, is unprecedented in geological discourses. 
 
Lastly, AA states that the ‘Anthropocene’ also entails forms of ethical anthropocentrism. This 
criticism does not hold for the Anthropocene Hypothesis because the hypothesis does not entail any type 
of normative-ethical statements, and thus cannot be ethically anthropocentric. Discussions of the broader 
social value of scientific ideas are always present, especially when these ideas cross with human affairs of 
primary importance, such as the current global environmental challenges. The ‘Anthropocene’ is situated 
at the intersection of this discourse between ‘facts’ and ‘values’ – promoting a name that would serve as a 
‘warning’ to humanity in the geological arena. This argument has also been advanced by the AWG 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b). Yet, it is important to distinguish the social utility of an idea from its 
epistemology. In the case of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, it is not its normative-ethical claims that directly 
support its empirical claims. Rejection or ratification of the hypothesis is likely to have some degree of 
normative-ethical implications, but these options are (and should be) assessed based on the epistemic 
virtues (e.g., explanatory power, intelligibility, empirical adequacy, etc.) of the evidence provided in its 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
335 
 
support. An argument against the scientificity of the hypothesis based on normative-political motifs seemingly 
behind the hypothesis is discussed in section 5.2.3.3. 
 
Therefore, criticism raised by AA against the ‘Anthropocene’ does not seem to entirely address the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis as well – with the only exception of epistemological anthropocentrism, requiring 
further research concerning different epistemologies of geological time and how they would generate new 
useful knowledge. 
 
5.1.3 The Historical Argument 
 
A shared rationale underpinning both UAA and AA is the lack of historical soundness of the term 
‘Anthropocene’ as used in the natural sciences discourses. This criticism has been repeatedly considered 
throughout the present work and largely overlaps with other lines of criticism observed so far. Thus, it is 
hereby only briefly summarized.  
 
History became an important contributor to the semantics of the ‘Anthropocene’ during the late 
2000s. The multi- and interdisciplinary atmosphere gravitating around the pioneering work of the IGBP 
and the Earth System Partnership ensured that historical research was not neglected in contextualizing the 
Earth System – as exemplified by the IHOPE (Integrated History and future Of People on Earth) project 
(Robin & Steffen, 2007, see also section 2.1.3.3). The ‘Anthropocene’ did not emerge as a historical object, 
but its connection with human history was latent since its inception. Crutzen and Stoermer’s (2000) 
landmark article suggested the Industrial Revolution (a historical period) as a possible starting date for the 
Anthropocene.317 The Great Acceleration (also a historical period) was shortly afterward connected to the 
term as well (Costanza et al., 2007), followed by the Nuclear Age (Waters et al., 2015) and other alternative 
starting dates from hundreds to thousands of years in the past. This is not trivial: stressing historical times 
was not merely a practical necessity, but was the first sign that the ‘Anthropocene’ represented an object of 
historical concern. As stated by historian Libby Robin and chemist Will Steffen (2007), the “Anthropocene 
defines the momentous and historical change in circumstances whereby the biophysical systems of the world 
are now no longer independent of the actions of people” (p. 1699). Chakrabarty’s (2009) seminal paper The 
Climate of History argued that those circumstances deeply challenged the fundamental assumption of history 
“that our past, present, and future are connected by a certain continuity of human experience” (p. 197). His 
paper ignited a series of debates that have in particular engaged historians with the theses promoted – 
especially the convergence of human and natural (viz. geological) history through the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
The ‘Anthropocene’ became an established object of historical (and broadly humanistic) interest 
after 2009. Thereafter, historical scholarship (especially environmental history) began to systematically 
explore and question the rationale of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept/discourse. Questions concerning the 
beginning of the Anthropocene – i.e., the Neolithic Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, or the Atomic 
 
317 Crutzen was also a contributor to the IHOPE project. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
336 
 
Age – engendered discussions of a historical rather than a geological nature. In the normative arena, these 
discussions raised further questions concerning the meaning and implications of selecting a beginning that 
have been fraught with political and historical significance. To this day, historians remain divided on the 
utility of the ‘Anthropocene,’ some showing suspicion towards its assumptions, rhetoric, and implications. 
In particular, advocates of the ‘Capitalocene’ idea (Moore, 2016a) have criticized the seemingly oblivious 
nature of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept to its real historical roots, which they locate in the 16th century CE. 
Skepticism against the seemingly unifying Anthropos (as in UAA), or which historical subject(s) to include 
in the ‘Anthropocene’ (Emmett & Lekan, 2016), has had several historians rejecting the seemingly all-
inclusive notion of Homo sapiens used by the natural sciences to characterize the Anthropocene.  
Criticism against the historically oblivious nature of the ‘Anthropocene’ transformed into criticism 
against the explanatory power of the term, and thus against epistemic utility. Bonneuil and Fressoz (2016) 
observe: 
 
The entry into the Anthropocene was intrinsically bound up with capitalism, with the commercial 
nation-state and the genesis of the British Empire, which dominated the world in the nineteenth 
century and forced other societies to serve its model or to seek to follow it. Similarly, the Great 
Acceleration cannot be understood [emphasis added] without the Second World War, the Cold War in 
which two blocs rivalled one another in the mobilization of the globe, and – since it emerged 
victorious – without American imperialism. (p. 289)  
 
The Great Acceleration has been a key historical period in framing the ‘Anthropocene’ in the Earth System 
discourse. The period also coincides with the time window chosen by the AWG to locate a possible 
beginning of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit – that is, around the 1950s. If this time frame is 
insufficient to understand the deeper historical and social roots of the ‘Anthropocene,’ then the notion is 
epistemically insufficient. Delimiting the ‘Anthropocene’ concept/discourse to the Industrial Revolution 
or the Great Acceleration makes it fundamentally useless, if not historically inaccurate. This point is further 
reiterated by Malm (2014), who argues that “[t]heorists of the epoch have little to say about the actual causes 
of the rise of steam, but they do propound a general framework for understanding the transition to fossil 
fuels in the Industrial Revolution, which, for reasons of logical necessity, is deduced from human nature” 
(p. 63). Its lack of historical depth makes the ‘Anthropocene’ a term with little or no explanatory power 
concerning the causal mechanisms (e.g., social, political, cultural, economic, etc.) that engendered it. If so, 
then its epistemic utility is doubtful. 
While criticism of historical kind merges with other lines of criticism (as seen in UAA and AA), its 
relevance in Anthropocene Studies deserves a separate formulation that can be expressed in the following 
argument: 
 
HA (Historical Argument): The lack of explanatory power concerning the deeper 
historical mechanisms of the ‘Anthropocene’ phenomenon makes the concept/discourse 
of ‘Anthropocene’ epistemically insufficient. 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
337 
 
HA shares with UAA criticism against the epistemic utility of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept/discourse. 
Whereas UAA expresses historical, ethical, and epistemic concerns regarding the Anthropos postulated in 
the ‘Anthropocene,’ HA specifically addresses the lack of epistemic utility in relation to the historicity of 
the term. Because the concept/discourse does not explain the deeper historical mechanisms that 
engendered the Anthropocene, the term is considered to lack explanatory power – therefore providing an 
ahistorical, species-based narrative of the recent history of humanity and its relationship with the Earth. 
Ultimately, if the term lacks explanatory power, then it is epistemically insufficient because it fails to grasp 
the very thing it seeks to explain – that is, the impact of humans on the planet. This line of reasoning assumes 
historical research to be a necessary aspect of the geological, but also the broader natural sciences, discourse 
on the ‘Anthropocene.’  
Criticism connected to HA does not solely raise concerns regarding the historical validity of the term, 
it is also deeply embroiled in normative-ethical statements. It is crucial, critics argue, that historical 
mechanisms are properly discussed to frame subsequent questions of responsibility and attribution of recent 
anthropogenic environmental challenges. The question of identifying the historical causation behind the 
dawn of the ‘Anthropocene’ also means assigning historical and ethical responsibility. This argument is 
parallel to the ethical argument (EA), explored in the following section. 
Does HA hold for the Anthropocene Hypothesis as well? A partial and preliminary answer to this 
question was anticipated in section 1.2.3 by proposing a complementary (rather than antagonistic) view on 
the historical and geological research. Based on this premise, section 4.2.2 further explored models in the 
philosophy of science that would best frame and represent the explanatory power and intelligibility of the 
hypothesis. While as a technical (viz. stratigraphic) term, the ‘Anthropocene’ lacks explanatory power 
(Renn, 2020; Rosol et al., 2017) because it only serves as a signpost for classifying geological time (in the 
same way the labels chosen for other geochronological time units do not entail explanatory power), it has 
been argued that the Anthropocene Hypothesis does on the contrary entail explanatory power. Three 
arguments have been promoted in support of this thesis, namely (1) the way that stratigraphic evidence for 
an ‘Anthropocene’ unit is presented – which has had historians and stratigraphers discussing a common 
object from complementary angles; (2) the multidisciplinary nature of the research group promoting the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis (i.e., the AWG); and (3) a comparative analysis of the explanatory power of the 
Alvarez Hypothesis. These arguments showed that historical considerations have not been absent in the 
theoretical forging and development of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Rather, they complemented the 
necessary methodological deficiencies that stratigraphy, in virtue of its subject matter and epistemic context, 
cannot directly tackle. Thus, if the Anthropocene Hypothesis does entail explanatory power in the way 
highlighted, then the antecedent in HA is false, and the argument does not hold for the hypothesis. 
It must be observed that considering the ‘Anthropocene’ epistemically insufficient (i.e., not achieving 
a particular epistemic goal, such as explanation or understanding of a phenomenon) is a statement that is 
not true or false per se. Any concept is either sufficient or insufficient based on the epistemological 
framework implementing it. Hence, it is plausible that the ‘Anthropocene’ is too broad a category for 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
338 
 
historians, who otherwise engage with the particular technological, scientific, environmental, economic, 
political, or other aspects that the ‘Anthropocene’ may too quickly condense into a single and stratigraphy-
based conceptual unit. In the same way epistemic virtues such as explanatory power or intelligibility are 
always context dependent, being epistemically sufficient depends upon the specific epistemological 
framework in which one is situated. In the case of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, the empirical content 
(Chapter 3) and its epistemology (Chapter 4) are of a stratigraphic nature (although entailing 
multidisciplinary methods). Therefore, assessments of epistemic validity and utility of the hypothesis remain 
within this specific disciplinary and epistemic domain. 
 
5.1.4 The Ethical Argument 
 
A fourth (and here last) major line of criticism raised against the ‘Anthropocene’ comes from the normative-
ethical research within Anthropocene Studies. Because one of the central premises of this research is that 
the descriptive and normative-methodological/functional nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis neither 
entails nor presupposes normative-ethical claims, it follows that normative-ethical criticism against the 
‘Anthropocene’ cannot equally hold against the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Hence, this section only 
outlines the inchoate landscape of ethical discussions about the ‘Anthropocene.’ Nevertheless, because 
scientific hypotheses are always part of societal contexts characterized by the existence of certain value 
systems (including scientific values), questions of a normative intent are raised in terms of what (if any) the 
ethical implications might be of the hypothesis and its surrounding discourse. 
 
Ethical concerns inform much of UUA, AA, and HA. UUA considers Anthropos to be ethically 
irresponsible because it obfuscates questions of responsibility for the dawn of the Anthropocene. AA raises 
questions of anthropocentrism that include ethical anthropocentrism. HA implicitly stresses that, by lacking 
sufficient historical depth, the term necessarily fails to raise important questions of historical responsibility. 
These types of concerns have a longer history predating the dawn of the ‘Anthropocene’ debates. They 
originated in the increasing global environmental awareness that the second half of the 20th century 
witnessed through the formation of local and international institutions, think tanks, research programs, 
environmental movements, NGOs, and more. This global environmental movement has been championing 
initiatives to study, teach, prevent, and counteract the wide spectrum of social and environmental threats 
posed by anthropogenic activities. Because the ‘Anthropocene’ has been recently used as an umbrella term 
to frame this vast research and social landscape, it also absorbed the same ethical questions underpinning 
it.  
For instance, the paleontologist and AWG member Reinhold R. Leinfelder (2013) argues that, 
from an ethical standpoint, 
 
the Anthropocene emphasizes that all of us – from individuals to states to the United Nations – are 
collectively responsible for the future of the world […] As a conceptual framework, the Anthropocene 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
339 
 
could hence provide a solid basis for envisioning a sustainable human presence on Earth in which 
humans would no longer be “invaders” but rather participants in shaping the natural environment. 
(p. 9, emphases added) 
 
This statement locates two central themes in the environmental discourses that have been shaping the 
‘Anthropocene’ concept in the normative-ethical arena – that is, responsibility and sustainability. Invoking 
new responsibilities (Ellis, 2009), stewardship (AESS, 2014; Palsson et al., 2013; Steffen et al., 2011b), or 
ethical precepts (Polt & Wittrock, 2018; Zylinska, 2014) has transformed the ‘Anthropocene’ into more 
than merely a scientific term belonging to a discrete academic niche. The expression has become a vector 
for social change, used to inform the public about anthropogenic alteration of the globe through museum 
and gallery exhibitions, documentaries, and other forms of sensibilization and education. 
However, some scholars have raised criticisms against the ethical validity of adopting this term to 
frame the present discussions on anthropogenic modifications of the Earth. For instance, the 
environmental scholar and ecofeminist Giovanna di Chiro (2017) argues that “the pan-humanism of the 
concept of Anthropocene reflects and shores up neoliberal, individualist, entrepreneurial forms of 
‘resilience’, which trade on the notion that if ‘we’ (humans) are all to blame for the climate crisis, then no 
one is to blame and, therefore, no one is responsible, so we’re all left to our own devices to become more 
resilient” (p. 489). Resilience is one of the key concepts in environmental literature that has engaged with 
the ‘Anthropocene,’ and thus needs some additional remarks. 
‘Resilience’ is “[t]raditionally understood as a prevention of disasters or a capacity for individuals 
or systems to manage and rebound from a disruption” (Schwarz, 2018, p. 528), and has recently been 
embraced by a variety of disciplines, from psychology to national security and climate change. The term 
has also seen applications in ecology, originally defined as a “measure of the persistence of systems and of 
their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between populations 
or state variables” (Holling, 1973, p. 14). Dedicated research and initiatives have connected the 
‘Anthropocene’ with ecological (or generally environmental) discourses on resilience (Fox et al., 2017; 
Grove & Chandler, 2017; Kareiva & Fuller, 2016; Robin, 2014b; Rockström et al., 2009a; Steffen et al., 
2018). The Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC) was founded in 2007 to “advance the scientific 
understanding of the complex, dynamic interactions of people and nature in the Biosphere, train the next 
generation of sustainability researchers and leaders, and engage in collaborations with change agents” (SRC, 
n.d.). A research project entitled ‘Earth Resilience in the Anthropocene’ was promoted by the SRC in 
conjunction with the European Research Council for the “analysis of nonlinearity and abrupt shifts, and 
informing global sustainability policy processes” (ERA, n.d.). One of the Future Labs (i.e., research themes) 
of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research addresses the theme ‘Earth Resilience in the 
Anthropocene,’ attempting “to develop a framework to characterize the resilience of the Earth System in 
the Anthropocene” (FutureLab, n.d.). A journal entitled Resilience: A Journal of the Environmental Humanities 
was founded in 2014, merging ‘Anthropocene’ themes with the topic of resilience. A special issue of 
Resilience: International Policies, Practices and Discourses entitled ‘Resilience and the Anthropocene’ was published 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
340 
 
by the journal in 2017 – a clear sign of interest in establishing a dialogue between these two terms. As part 
of the book series ‘Routledge Research in the Anthropocene,’ Routledge published Resilience in the 
Anthropocene: Governance and Politics at the End of the World in April 2020. These are examples witnessing the 
close link between the two concepts of ‘Anthropocene’ and resilience in recent scholarship. 
Following di Chiro (2017), resilience – with its neoliberal, individualist, entrepreneurial 
connotations – favors an ‘invisible hand’ approach to the environmental challenges posed by humanity. 
This approach suggests that human systems (viz. the market) will eventually adapt to the stress they 
themselves impose on the Earth. Such adaptation will be an automatic response granted the way human 
societies (viz. the neoliberal market and technology) work. For di Chiro, such a narrative is supported by 
the ‘Anthropocene’ concept/discourse. The term does not reflect the realities of environmental justice and 
climate justice politics because it postulates an undifferentiated Anthropos that does not equally allocate 
responsibility, and thus does not assume a justice-based definition of resilience. Rather, it encourages 
‘bouncing back’ to the status quo – the very same conditions that engendered the ‘Anthropocene’ in first 
place. 
The environmental humanist and queer theorist Dana Luciano (2015) conceives the 
‘Anthropocene’ as essentially “a political strategy, notwithstanding its scientific verifiability; its intent is not 
simply to carve humanity’s name upon the stratigraphic map (humans, after all, invented the map in the 
first place), but to raise awareness of the negative planetary impact of certain human activities, with the intent 
of altering or mitigating them.” Within the very stratigraphic agenda is a social message of political power, 
one linked to the determination of the impact of human activities that distinctively marked the beginning 
of the proposed epoch. Rather than raising a criticism, Luciano points out the political and ethical 
implications of selecting one among possible starting dates, from the colonization of the Americas to the 
Nuclear Age. 
Adding to multiple lines of criticism, Crist (2013) argues that nothing about the ‘Anthropocene’ 
discourse, and much less the term itself, “offers an alternative to the civilizational revamping of Earth as a 
base of human operations and functional stage for history’s uninterrupted performance” (p. 140). Adding 
neither an empirical nor ethical overtone, the concept fails to provide a basis for defining the Earth as 
something more than a managerial affair, instead insisting on a techno-scientific and rationalizing pitch that 
obstructs any other alternative ethical or social-oriented endeavor. Additionally, Crist criticizes the idea that 
the term would serve as a warning to the world, rhetorically asking “[w]hy (and how) would a term with no 
content other than the brazen face of ‘anthropos’ stamped over the face of the Earth, be a warning to the 
world?” (ibid., footnote 42).  
Criticism of the term’s utility in science and environmental communication has also been raised by 
Santana (2019b, discussed in section 4.1.3.2), who has challenged the idea that official recognition of the 
Anthropocene Epoch would increase environmental awareness in the public sphere. He considers this claim 
wishful thinking. This criticism addresses the utility of the term in science communication and is based on 
the premise that scientific consensus on anthropogenic alterations of the Earth does not reflect the public’s 

AGAINST THE ‘ANTHROPOCENE’ 
341 
 
environmental sensibility. Santana draws on the example of climate change discussions in the United States, 
“where the public is neither aware of the consensus nor in general agreement with it” because of (among 
other things) misinformation campaigns. This occurs despite the broad consensus and publicity that climate 
change research has achieved through “activists, professional scientific organizations, and government 
agencies.” This fact alone suggests that the ‘Anthropocene,’ which has received far less attention in the 
public environmental discourse than climate change, would fail as an ethical device for science 
communication. 
These excerpts provide a sufficient basis for formulating the ethical argument as follows: 
 
EA (Ethical Argument): The concept/discourse of ‘Anthropocene’ is ethically 
insufficient because (1) it promotes forms of ethical anthropocentrism and neoliberal 
responses to the environmental challenges it encompasses; (2) it dissolves questions of 
responsibility; and (3) it fails to convey any valuable and useful normative message in the 
public arena. 
 
Criticism raised by EA addresses the ‘Anthropocene’ as generally portrayed by the discourse of natural 
scientists. As anticipated, EA intersects with the other arguments outlined in the previous sections. With 
them, EA contests the basic idea that the ‘Anthropocene’ could provide ethical as well as empirical content 
with broader normative utility, rather than representing a mere label or technical term of exclusively 
stratigraphic use. However, because the epistemological analysis of the Anthropocene Hypothesis so far 
conducted suggests that the hypothesis does not entail normative-ethical statements, EA does not apply to 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
Section 1.3.2 suggested that the statements that Homo sapiens has left a discernible stratigraphic 
signature of significant magnitude in recent geological history (Claim 1), and that this signature could be 
translated into the geological time scale (Claim 2) as a series/epoch (Claim 3), are not normative-ethical. 
Rather, Claim 1 is descriptive-observational (it states that something happens to be the case), whereas Claim 
2 and Claim 3 are normative-methodological (they state how the division of the Quaternary should be 
rearranged in respect of the empirical evidence provided). The societal relevance of these statements is a 
different set of statements that follows from empirical and theoretical recognition of a certain state of affairs 
(in the same way anthropogenic climate change and the ozone layer represent social issues after they have 
been recorded and documented). As also stressed by the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b), it is important 
to distinguish between the scientific usefulness and the societal utility of the Anthropocene Hypothesis: 
 
One is the potential usefulness for science, involving or facilitating a paradigm shift (and this is the 
matter to which the mandate of the AWG study is limited). The second is a broader societal 
relevance due to enhanced awareness raising (and therefore stretching into the sphere of political 
perception of the Anthropocene), and this is a fundamentally different consideration. (p. 39) 
 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
342 
 
Because scientific usefulness is always context dependent, it is determined within the original 
epistemological context of the hypothesis (i.e., stratigraphy), and assessed by the epistemic actors affected 
by the acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis (e.g., a non-geologist can hardly assess whether the 
hypothesis is useful or not for geologists). The societal utility of the Anthropocene Hypothesis beyond the 
natural sciences has been considered by using the cases of international law (para. 1.4.3.1) and public health 
science (para. 1.4.3.2). However, this represents a different analysis from the ethical points raised by EA – 
that is, the ethical utility of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. 
 
Szerszynski (2012, p. 169) has argued that “[i]n terms of environmental ethics, one might say that 
geology is brutally consequentialist – it does not matter what one does, or why one did it, just what 
consequences it will leave behind” (p. 169). Similarly, the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2021) has emphasized 
that “it is an important feature of the geological meaning of the Anthropocene in that it refers to the 
manifestation of human effects: the consequence in strata” (p. 6). This pragmatic tenet stresses the importance 
of the geological traces over the causal mechanisms that engender them in defining an Anthropocene Series 
in the stratigraphic record. Perhaps much of the ethical and historical controversy around the 
‘Anthropocene,’ and raised by EA and HA, gravitates around the implications (and interpretations) of this 
statement. Nevertheless, whilst the ethical utility of the ‘Anthropocene’ remains an open question to be 
answered within ethical discourses in Anthropocene Studies, it has been shown how the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis can be approached as an epistemic entity avulsed from internal considerations of normative-
ethical value. 
 
 
5.2 Against the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
 
 
Criticism against the Anthropocene Hypothesis reflects criticism against the evidence submitted, its 
stratigraphic significance, the proposed ~1950 boundary, the seemingly ‘unorthodox’ nature of the 
hypothesis and research methods of the AWG, and the overall utility of the Anthropocene in the scientific 
community. Such criticism has been advanced by scientists close, and even internal, to the Group. For 
instance, the archaeologist and AWG member Matt Edgeworth (2014b; Edgeworth et al., 2019; Edgeworth 
et al., 2015) has opposed a chronostratigraphic definition of the Anthropocene, advocating instead for a 
diachronous onset rather than a GSSP-based beginning. This view is shared by other AWG members, such 
as Ellis (2016a), who argues that “long-term reshaping of Earth systems by humans is being ignored in the 
group’s discussions” (p. 192). An important voice in the debate has been the Quaternary geologist Philip 
Gibbard, also Secretary-General of the ICS and himself an AWG member. He has also opposed formal 
recognition of the Anthropocene, advancing a series of theses intersecting with several of the arguments 
highlighted in this section.  

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
343 
 
 
Other relevant figures in the geological community who have raised important criticism against the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis are the geologists Michael Walker (Professor Emeritus of Quaternary Science at 
the University of Wales, UK), Stan Finney (Professor of Geological Sciences at California State University, 
Long Beach, US), Martin J. Head (Vice-chair of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy), Lucy 
Edwards (member of the United States Geological Survey), Whitney Autin (Professor of Geology at SUNY 
Brockport, US), John Holbrook (Professor of Geology at Texas Christian University, US), and William 
Ruddiman (paleoclimatologist at the University of Virginia, US). These figures of predominantly 
Anglophone provenance have contested the Anthropocene Hypothesis by advancing several types of 
critiques, publishing in geology-oriented academic platforms such as GSA Today, The Holocene, and 
Quaternary International as well as in newspapers and blogs. In turn, this mounting criticism has initiated a 
lively debate with promoters of the Anthropocene Hypothesis (i.e., the majority within the AWG) – who 
have absorbed or responded to criticism on several occasions (Zalasiewicz & al, 2012; Zalasiewicz et al., 
2017b). Published journal articles from these figures represent the primary sources for surveying criticism 
against the hypothesis. 
 
Aside from criticism of ideological science, most of the literature surveyed shares a common 
critique of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a stratigraphic hypothesis. This pool of criticism differs from the 
critiques advanced against the ‘Anthropocene,’ in that the broader normative aspects of the hypothesis are 
not the primary object of concern for scientists rejecting the hypothesis. Rather, the epistemological aspects 
that represent the main hubs of discussion are the possibility, plausibility, and significance of the 
stratigraphic footprint of Homo sapiens from a present as well as future perspective (section 5.2.1);318 the 
tension between diachronous and synchronous signals of the Anthropocene (section 5.2.2); the 
methodological and empirical consistency of the hypothesis in the context of stratigraphic classification 
(section 5.2.3); and the overall utility of the Anthropocene Hypothesis for and science (section 5.2.4). The 
disciplinary matrix (and thus content) of this type of criticism makes it substantially different than criticism 
against the ‘Anthropocene’ – despite the semantic overlap between the two theoretical entities (i.e., the 
‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis) that still occurs in scientific literature. 
 
Criticism against the Anthropocene Hypothesis is surveyed in a descriptive fashion. Whilst section 
5.1 aimed at assessing whether arguments against the ‘Anthropocene’ held equally against the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, no such aim is pursued in overviewing this criticism – besides remarks emerging organically 
from the way the arguments are expressed. This is because the primary target is neither to defend nor attack 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis, but to consider criticism because of its epistemological value for science. 
Exclusion of criticism in an epistemological analysis of the hypothesis would result in a substantial and 
unjustified research vacuum. Furthermore, criticism has played an important role for the historical-
conceptual development of the hypothesis. For instance, criticism against the GSSA methodology 
 
318 This section also explores an argument in favor of geological recognition of a human stratigraphic footprint (the 
Positive Future Geologist Argument). Delineating a profile of this argument aids an understanding of the arguments 
advanced against the plausibility that Homo sapiens will leave a discernible and significant stratigraphic mark from a 
future perspective. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
344 
 
persuaded AWG members to consider the GSSP a more suitable methodology for locating a possible 
beginning to the Anthropocene. Similarly, considerations over the diachronous nature of the Industrial 
Revolution shifted the attention to the more recent, and seemingly isochronous, signals of plutonium 
associated with the Atomic Age. 
 
The only exception from this methodological choice of ‘neutrality’ is represented in the discussion 
of the Ideological Science Argument, tackled in section 5.2.3.3. The nature of the argument(s) advanced 
through this type of criticism makes it necessary to consider whether it holds against the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis because it undermines a fundamental premise of the present work – that is, that the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis constitutes a scientific hypothesis. Thus, a solely descriptive approach cannot be 
maintained in the section in question.  
 
5.2.1 The Future Geologist Argument 
 
One of the most recurrent and compelling discussions concerning the nature of the Anthropocene as a 
geological time unit is whether or not its (anthropogenic) stratigraphic base will be detectable in a 
geologically distant future. Researchers and scholars of a multidisciplinary matrix have widely implemented 
the future geologist perspective to discuss the geological signature of the ‘Anthropocene’ and its broader 
implications. Emblematic of this research interest is a recently formulated hypothesis – the Silurian 
Hypothesis (Schmidt & Frank, 2019)319 – which aims to assess via a thought experiment the likelihood that 
an industrial civilization (e.g., humans) will be detectable in nature in future geological times.  
 
There are several instances in extant literature showing the interest and importance of a future 
perspective. The climatologist and glaciologist Eric Wolff (2014) argues that the Anthropocene “has to be 
considered from the viewpoint of a geologist viewing sequences thousands or millions of years in the 
future” (p. 255, quoted in Santana, 2019a). Writing for The Guardian, Damian Carrington (2016) writes that 
“[t]he domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future 
geologists.” Geographer Noel Castree (2014a) notes that formalizing the Anthropocene requires “robust 
evidence of changes that might, thousands of years hence, be considered clear stratigraphic markers by 
future geologists” (p. 439). Anthropologist and archaeologist Todd Braje considers the term 
‘Anthropocene’ useful for geologists “because it reflects a change in the Earth system so distinctive that 
future geologists, studying flora and fauna, ice cores, atmospheric records, stratigraphic layers and much 
more, will find clear human signatures” (p. 509). Braje and Erlandson (2013) write that “there is little 
question that the extinctions and translocations of flora and fauna will be easily visible to future scholars 
who study archaeological and paleoecological records worldwide” (p. 20). Environmental literary theorist 
 
319 The thought experiment was advanced by climatologist Gavin A. Schmidt and astrophysicist Adam Frank in a 2019 
paper published in the International Journal of Astrobiology. The authors ask whether it would be “possible to detect an 
industrial civilization in the geological record” (Schmidt & Frank, 2019, p. 142). The term ‘Silurian’ draws from a 1970 
episode of the science fiction TV show Doctor Who, where an ancient and Earthy species of the same name is awakened 
by humans. 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
345 
 
Pieter Vermeulen (2017) considers the future geologist perspective “one of the most popular tropes in the 
Anthropocene imagination” (p. 867), and one altering the very function of literary narrative. Lastly, 
geologist Stanley Finney (2014) states that “projection into the future is implicit in the concept of the 
‘Anthropocene’” (p. 26). These examples show how much of a common topos the future geologist 
perspective has become in recent multidisciplinary scholarship on the ‘Anthropocene’ and the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Whilst the future geologist perspective undertakes different trajectories, thus raising different 
questions reflecting different disciplinary takes, the question raised in the geochronological and stratigraphic 
domain is the following: Will anthropogenic stratigraphic signals be substantial enough for a future geologist to discern a 
‘Human Stratum’ event in stratigraphic records? If answered positively, then there is no legitimate reason not to 
formalize the Anthropocene on the geological time scale now – provided that other necessary and sufficient 
epistemic requirements are met (e.g., empirical work, explanatory power, consistency, usefulness, etc.). In 
other words, it seems intuitive to formalize a time unit if its stratigraphic base will likely be detected by a 
future geologist. If answered negatively, there is no legitimate reason to formalize the epoch/series other 
than extra-scientific motives (e.g., political, normative-ethical, etc.). In this case, it seems unnecessary to 
formalize an infinitesimally short time unit if its stratigraphic base is uncertain or unlikely to be detected by 
a future geologist. In both cases, the future geologist perspective is adopted by both supporters and critics 
of the hypothesis in support of their respective arguments, which can be formulated as following: 
 
FGA (Future Geologist Argument): The range of stratigraphic evidence supporting a 
proposed lower boundary for an Anthropocene Epoch/Series at ~1950 will/will not be 
detectable by future geologists, thus validating/invalidating the proposal of formal ratification 
of the time unit on the geological time scale. 
 
How is it possible for the same argument to support mutually exclusive theses? Besides how and for what 
purposes the argument is being formulated, much of the answer depends on the weight attributed to the 
possibility, plausibility, and significance of anthropogenic records to be preserved in strata.  
 
The two existential categories ‘possibility’ and ‘plausibility’ require some preliminary definition. 
Let’s define something S as possible if its existence does not entail an ontological contradiction, meaning that 
S may theoretically happen (e.g., it is impossible to throw a six-sided die and obtain more than six possible 
results, whilst it is possible that a meteorite might hit your car); and define S as plausible if there are reasons 
to believe that S will eventually be the case (e.g., it is possible to win the lottery, despite being very 
implausible).320 Plausibility logically entails possibility, but not vice versa – meaning that everything that is 
plausible is also possible, but the opposite is not the case.  
 
320 A third existential category addresses the probability of S if there are ways to establish numerically the chances of S 
to eventually manifest (e.g., the probably of obtaining ‘one’ by throwing a six-sided die is 1/6). Given the non-
mathematical nature of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, it is difficult to attribute a numerical probability to the chances 
that anthropogenic signatures will or will not be preserved in the geological future. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
346 
 
 
To argue that it is possible that anthropogenic records will be preserved in strata means that such a 
claim is consistent with the observable natural world (i.e., it does not contradict known natural laws). 
Conversely, to argue that it is impossible that anthropogenic records will be preserved in strata means that 
such a claim is inconsistent with the natural world – that is, it entails a contradiction. Similarly, to argue that 
it is plausible that anthropogenic records will be preserved in strata means that there are reasons to believe 
that this will be the case – that is, a future geologist will observe a discernable human stratigraphic signature. 
Conversely, to argue that it is implausible that anthropogenic records will be preserved in strata means that a 
future geologist will be unlikely to observe a discernable human stratigraphic signature, or a signature 
substantial enough to define a unit of geological time. 
There does not seem to be any contradiction (neither epistemic nor ontological) in claiming that 
humans may leave a stratigraphic footprint detectable in future geological records – not least because 
existing paleontological and stratigraphic records abundantly show that species may leave body321 and trace 
fossils in the stratigraphic record. Thus, it is unlikely to be ontologically impossible for humans to leave a 
discernible stratigraphic mark. Further, critics of the Anthropocene Hypothesis do not deny the possibility 
that anthropogenic stratigraphic signals may exist – as later shown. Rather, their major point of criticism 
concerns the plausibility that anthropogenic strata will be discernible from a future geologist perspective, 
and their epistemic significance. More precisely, criticism address the plausibility that a clearly marked 
boundary at ~1950 CE will be detectable in future stratigraphic records. 
Thus, from a theoretical standpoint, FGA gravitates around three hubs of discussion: 
(1) The plausibility that anthropogenic signals will be discernible in future stratigraphic records. 322 
(2) The plausibility that a marked ~1950 boundary will be discernible in future stratigraphic records. 
(3) The significance attributed to future anthropogenic stratigraphic records by a hypothetical future 
geologist. 
The stance one assumes concerning these three discursive hubs determines the specific formulation of 
FGA – leading to ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ formulations of FGA. The labels ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ are not 
value judgements. Both arguments provide epistemically rich and useful considerations regarding the 
plausibility that humans will leave a stratigraphically significant marker in the geological history. The choice 
simply reflects the positive and negative stance concerning the plausibility and weight attributed to the 
future anthropogenic stratigraphic record. 
The analysis of the ‘positive future geologist argument’ (P-FGA) draws on a thought experiment 
conducted by Zalasiewicz (2008) concerning how long the human geological footprint will last in the future. 
 
321 The possibility that body fossils will be discovered is nevertheless restricted. Schmidt and Frank (2019) observe 
that “[t]he fraction of life that gets fossilized is always extremely small and varies widely as a function of time, habitat 
and degree of soft tissue versus hard shells or bones […] species as short-lived as Homo sapiens (so far) might not be 
represented in the existing fossil record at all” (p. 143). 
322 Point (1) concerns both the plausibility that (a) anthropogenic signals will be detectable at all (this does not 
contradict the possibility of the existence of anthropogenic deposits, which could exist without being observed, from 
a philosophical realism viewpoint), or (b) that anthropogenic signals will be detectable as anthropogenic (rather than 
related to another species, for instance). 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
347 
 
The thought experiment anticipated much of the extant debate on humans’ geological legacy, and thus 
represents a valuable source when discussing FGA. It does not represent an argument against the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis, but rather (implicitly) in favor of it. Delineating it aims at clarifying opposing 
stances concerning the epistemic viewpoint of a hypothetical future observer. 
The ‘negative future geologist argument’ (N-FGA) draws on the formulation of the argument 
provided by Santana (2019a) – a rare contribution from the philosophy of science in discussing the 
epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis – and on criticism raised by geologists, stratigraphers, or 
researchers denying the plausibility of a ‘Human Stratum’ event in future geological records.  
 
5.2.1.1 The Positive Future Geologist Argument 
 
Prior to stratigraphic debates over the Anthropocene Hypothesis, the question of humans’ geological legacy 
on the Earth had already been tackled by Zalasiewicz (2008) in The Earth After Us. The book provides a far-
sighted thought experiment of great utility in framing the future geologist argument by asking what will 
remain of humans in geological records. The arguments it promotes suggest there will be traces of Homo 
sapiens in the distant future that an imaginative alien future civilization will be able to detect. The text does 
not engage with the ‘Anthropocene’ debate directly (which is only briefly addressed in just a few pages, i.e., 
pp. 154-157), but rather with the broader geological and stratigraphic significance of Homo sapiens and its 
appearance in the context of deep time. The arguments advanced anticipated some important theoretical 
aspects of the Anthropocene Hypothesis and the stratigraphic debates that ensued from its formulation. 
This is especially the case for assessing the significance of anthropogenic signals in future stratigraphic records. 
For this reason, the premises and arguments of the text provide a useful starting point for analyzing FGA. 
The Gedankenexperiment proposed by Zalasiewicz (2008) is based on seven assumptions relating to 
the temporal and epistemological viewpoint of a hypothetical future observer. These can be summarized in 
the following six premises: 
 
(P1) The future geologist studies the Earth in one hundred million years from the present (i.e., 
2008 CE),323 when Homo sapiens is extinct. 
(P2) The future geologist is represented by an intelligent and inquisitive alien civilization equipped 
with sufficient geological knowledge to conduct geochronological- and stratigraphic-like research. 
(P3) The future geologist applies existing (as of 2008 CE) geological principles “to studying the 
preservation potential of humans and their handiwork” (p. 4). 
(P4) Homo sapiens is considered “from the standpoint of a future paleoecologist” (p. 5) because 
Homo sapiens, and less its cultures, will not be immediately detectable if extinct. 
 
323 The year 2008 represents the year the book was published, and it is accordingly used to define ‘present’ for the 
thought experiment. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
348 
 
(P5) Geological forces and processes that have acted in the past and are acting in the present will 
be equally acting in the geological future (Uniformitarianism Principle). 
(P6) The geological records considered are based on Homo sapiens’ cumulative geological footprint 
as of today (2008 CE). 
 
Each one of these premises comports different theoretical aspects requiring further elucidation. 
P1 postulates a conventional time frame that is geologically minute (only 2% of the Earth’s 
geological history), yet significant enough in respect to the history of Homo sapiens. It also represents a time 
span adequate enough to browse and dive into stratigraphic records and geological time – which is mostly 
(though not solely) divided into million- and hundred-million-long time units (except for the sub-units of 
the Quaternary, which are hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands of years long). The premise implicitly 
hints that such a distant geological future represents a more suitable observation point to assess 
anthropogenic strata than any nearer future (e.g., a decade, a hundred years, or a thousand years). 
Interestingly, this point has often been evoked as an argument against the Anthropocene Hypothesis – that 
is, the idea that the stratigraphic consequences of human activities cannot be assessed in the present 
(especially if locating the lower boundary of the Anthropocene around 1950), but only in a geologically 
distant future. This point is further considered when discussing the negative interpretation of FGA. 
 
P2 provides minimal epistemic features defining the future observer viewpoint. It is irrelevant for 
the purpose of the arguments advanced by Zalasiewicz (2008) whether the future geologist is an alien 
species or another Earthly being that evolved into a highly intelligent species capable of geological 
knowledge. Theoretically, it is also irrelevant whether the observer is a human being as long as the observer 
adheres to P3 – although the thought experiment postulates a post-human Earth. However, choosing an 
alien civilization allows the consideration of anthropogenic stratigraphic signals to be objective (in a weak 
sense) – that is, detectable from a non-human observer. This is an important theoretical consideration to 
avoid issues of ontological and epistemological anthropocentrism. 
 
P3 provides the methodology adopted to investigate the potential of human remains to be recorded 
in stratigraphic material. The methodology chosen corresponds to extant principles in stratigraphic (and 
broader geological) research – especially radiometric dating, which “is something one can imagine as a 
standard inter-galactic technique” (p. 95) to determine the age of rocks and strata. Such methodology is 
projected onto the future alien civilization, meaning that the very same principles to study stratification and 
preservation of geological records (e.g., human fossils and technofossils) that apply now could be sufficient 
to detect human traces in stratigraphic records in one hundred million years.324 
 
324 Radiometric dating will be necessary (for the alien civilization) only to determine the absolute age of specific events. 
As explained in section 3.1, there exist several time-independent properties of strata successions that enable a relative 
geochronology. In this scenario, the alien civilization will perhaps only need knowledge of the Law of Superimposition 
(and will thus necessarily possess an understanding of gravity) and to observe certain properties (e.g., lithological, 
biostratigraphic) in sedimentary layers associated with the presence of Homo sapiens. 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
349 
 
P4 postulates that a future paleoecologist will be able to discern Homo sapiens (or whatever possible 
designation chosen for our species by the observer) as a distinct species. This postulate is necessary for the 
thought experiment to work since it is not taken for granted that Homo sapiens will be either immediately or 
clearly detectable in fossil records. Hence, a future geologist would implement this knowledge to establish 
a correlation between the appearance of Homo sapiens and global and synchronous signals in stratigraphic 
records. 
P5 – or the Uniformitarianism Principle – states that the very geological process that shape the 
Earth, and either destruct or allow preservation of geological records, will be invariantly active one hundred 
million years in the future. The principle is central in geology as well as in other natural sciences (e.g., 
physics, astronomy, chemistry), underpinning inferential strategies concerning reconstructions of the past 
(e.g., retrodiction) or predictions of the future (e.g., inductive reasoning). P5 is crucial to the thought 
experiment advanced. Without it, the very experiment would be unsubstantial, as it would be impossible to 
make any prediction or envision any universe inconsistent with known natural laws. 
 
P6 postulates what time period of the history (viz. evolutionary history) of Homo sapiens is 
considered. Zalasiewicz selects ten thousand years’ worth of stratigraphic section as a reasonable time 
span.325 This “represents the span during which human activities can be said to have left a detectable imprint 
upon the geological record – an imprint beyond the odd vanishingly rare bone of an obscure bipedal 
hominid” (p. 120). It begins with the late Pleistocene megafauna extinction, “humanity’s first real footprint 
upon the wider world” (ibid.) up to the present (2008 CE). However, Zalasiewicz also recognizes that “[t]he 
real global impact […] struck with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, when both human numbers 
and human exploitation of materials, energy, and land began to climb steeply” (ibid.), and that “[t]he longer 
the human species lasts, the deeper is likely to be the footprint” (p. 4). While necessarily relevant for 
assessing the stratigraphic significance of Homo sapiens, the future of humanity is not considered in the 
thought experiment. 
These premises delimit a scenario where it is possible and plausible for Homo sapiens to represent a 
geologically significant episode in the Earth’s history, and for a future geologist to assign epistemic (viz. 
stratigraphic) significance to anthropogenic signals. In fact, Zalasiewicz argues, 
 
The human empire may not represent a brief event, following which life on Earth, after our demise, 
goes back to normal. […] It represents a threshold, the transition between the world before humans 
and that to come afterwards. For our impact has been so great that we have already made Earth 
history. The world will, quite literally, never be the same again. (p. 125) 
 
The main question is how this threshold event will be recorded. Geological processes such as plate tectonics 
or sea level changes will dramatically alter the geography of the planet, and with it its climate, biosphere, 
 
325 The selection of this time span does not reflect a preferred starting date for the Anthropocene at 10,000 ka – as 
similarly proposed by B. D. Smith and Zeder (2013) and Erlandson and Braje (2013). As anticipated, discussions on 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis had yet to fully develop in stratigraphic terms, and the ‘Anthropocene’ is not the 
primary concern of the text.

and so forth. Human artefacts, from skyscrapers and particle accelerators to everyday tools, will be mostly 
eroded and dissolved almost to their basic chemical components. No aspect of human civilization will be 
left unscathed (as of P1). This is especially the case for those artifacts exposed to the surface (and thus most 
subject to erosion), whereas other artefacts will be drowned by sea level rise that, if fast enough, may provide 
the conditions of possibility for preservation in geological time. Nevertheless, it is plausible that traces of 
anthropogenic activities will be recorded in complex signals – for instance, in pollen or fossil records:  
 
The sudden appearance of floods of identikit pollen of crop plants around large parts of the globe 
is unlikely to pass unnoticed by our future observers […] The [biota] changes may well soon 
encompass such commonly fossilized creatures as the bivalve molluscs and gastropods, sea urchins, 
limpets, and barnacles of seashore and shallow sea floors. There are also potential microfossils – 
planktonic single-celled organisms such as foraminifera and diatoms, with preservable skeletons of 
lime or silica, which sink to the sea floor and accumulate in their billions in the bottom sediments 
after the organisms themselves have died. These are the fossils that really characterize strata. It now 
seems likely that some will show clearly the impact of human activities, while others will provide 
barometers of wider oceanographic changes. (p. 130, 132) 
 
The ongoing extinction events (Barnosky et al., 2011; Ceballos et al., 2015; Ceballos et al., 2017) will likely 
serve as valuable proxies for the Anthropocene. Most of the present extinctions will be geologically invisible 
(not insignificant), as they will “leave as little trace as the highland dinosaurs of the Jurassic have left – that 
is, virtually none” (Zalasiewicz, 2008, p. 133). However, watery sites such as coastal plains, deltas, river 
basins, lagoons, and ocean environments are likely to preserve fossilized remains of microbiota. The demise 
of coral reefs – hotspots of biological diversity and the center stage of many environmental discussions – 
“will leave an indelible and stark record in the Earth’s strata, perhaps the most striking of all our signals to 
the future” (p. 134). This strata record will be “the clearest possible message in the Earth’s strata: the 
simultaneous termination, worldwide, of the growth of massive white mountains of limy strata, and their 
replacement, and quite literally their burial, by layers of silicate mud and sand” (p. 138). These global 
extinctions in aquatic environments will not be as largely invisible as terrestrial extinctions. They are likely 
to be detected by the alien civilization depicted in P2. 
 
Anthropogenic emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere may also have consequences detectable from 
a future perspective. Oceans represent one of the Earth’s major carbon sinks, where ‘blue carbon’ (i.e., 
carbon removed from the atmosphere by ocean ecosystems) is stored. CO2 absorbed in the ocean reacts 
with seawater to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). In turn, carbonic acid interacts with water molecules to 
produce bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions. Hydrogen ions interact with existing carbon in water to 
produce further bicarbonate ions, which eventually contributes to reducing ocean pH. Increased ocean 
acidity is offset by dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) already present in the ocean. This has negative 
repercussions for shellfish and other aquatic organisms whose existence relies on the dissolved calcium 
carbonate for building and developing their shells and skeletons. As the anthropogenic carbon dioxide is 
further stored deeper in oceanic waters, calcium carbonate shells will dissolve and accumulate “as layers of 
ooze on the sea floor” (p. 143). This process will continue for several thousands of years until, “when a

351 
 
new chemical equilibrium is re-established, partly by this dissolution, and partly by the effects of weathering 
on land,” and “when the settling of carbonate skeletons resumes, this will be on a sea floor which has been 
dissolved away to a depth of perhaps tens of centimeters” (ibid.). A widespread marker horizon will be 
visible in the strata of oceanic deep-sea floors by future geologists (in a P1 scenario, but the layer will 
eventually disappear as ocean floors are recycled through tectonic processes), witnessing an increase in 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations. 
 
Body fossils of Homo sapiens will be just as rare as same-size fossils from one hundred million years 
ago. As surface rather than marine animals, our fossils will be more subject to erosion, thus decreasing the 
fossilization potential (but leaving enough body fossils for postulating P5). However, multiple types of trace 
fossils (e.g., footprints, burrows, nests) connected to Homo sapiens’ biological and cultural behaviors may be 
preserved in geological records. In fact, Zalasiewicz argues that Homo sapiens is “currently creating examples 
of the most amazing (and, in the far distant future, perhaps most puzzling) trace fossils likely to appear in 
the history of the planet” (p. 165). These ‘trace fossils’ or ichnofossils (i.e., fossilized traces) will not be 
classified “on the basis of the closeness of their relationship to other living organisms, but on the type of 
behaviour displayed” (p. 162).  
 
Paleontologist Adolf Seilacher (1964) originally distinguished five main behavioral activities for the 
classification of trace fossils, namely, Domichnia (dwelling burrows), Fodinichnia (feeding burrows), Pascichnia 
(feeding trails), Repichnia (crawling trails), and Cubichnia (resting tracks).326 The nomenclature parallels the 
binomial nomenclature used to classify of living organisms, but it is based on ethnological rather than 
biological principles. Ichnology (the study of trace fossils) uses this type of classification to reconstruct the 
behaviors of ancient (paleoichnology) and modern (neoichnology) species, complementing paleontological 
and stratigraphic research.  
 
Ichnological principles and methods will provide future geologist-observers in a P1 scenario with 
epistemic tools sufficient to detect the presence of Homo sapiens through traces, rather than through direct 
observation of artefacts or skeletal remains (which will be much harder to find). A P2-type of observer will 
follow five principles of trace fossils (to add to the methodological toolkit postulated in P3), namely, (1) “a 
single type of organism can make many different traces” (Zalasiewicz, 2008, p. 160), (2) “the same structure 
[e.g., a burrow] may look different when formed in different types of sediment” (ibid.), (3) multiple 
organisms may contribute to the same structure over time, (4) “different types of organisms can make 
similar traces” (ibid.), and (5) “the same organism has different behaviors in different environments” (p. 
163).327 
 
Most trace fossils will be remnants of the ‘Urban Stratum’ – that is, the “novel sedimentary 
environments and structures” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2011a, p. 1038) related to the excavation, transportation, 
 
326 An overview of the taxonomical classification of trace fossils and other more recent classes is available on the 
Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_fossil_classification (accessed on March 17, 2021. Last revision: 
December 5, 2020, 08:49 CET by Monkbot). 
327 The fifth principle is created ad hoc by Zalasiewicz (2008) for his thought experiment, and it is “not necessarily used 
by paleontologists” (p. 163).

and deposition of material (new and old) for urbanization (Barnosky, 2014). While not a direct marker of 
the Anthropocene, they still represent possible stratigraphic evidence of the existence of Homo sapiens from 
a P1 perspective. Urban agglomerates (cities and megacities) will represent potential sites for preservation 
of geological traces, as cities develop upon old ones, hence forming thick accumulated sedimentary sections 
made of different types of materials such as concrete, cinder, glass, plastics, iron, steel, copper, and more 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 2.5.2.1). These urban trace fossils will, “if buried in stratal successions, 
preserve distinctive structures, mineralogies and textures, and their nature and composition will provide a 
tool for distinguishing constructions from the Anthropocene from those that are older” (p. 65). These 
traces will be buried underground at different levels, depending on the pressure, temperature, region, and 
other variants contributing to the burial depth of anthropogenic sediments. Traces buried several kilometers 
in depth, and distant from orogenic regions, will have higher chances of preserving anthropogenic strata 
than those buried a few hundred meters below the surface. Those city remains observable by a P2 
civilization will preserve “meters-thick layers of rubble, of compressed outlines of concrete buildings […] 
of softened brick structures; of irregular patches of iron oxides and sulphides representing former iron 
artefacts […] of darkened and opaque remnants of plastics; of white, devitrified fragments of glass jars and 
bottles; of carbonized structures of shaped wood” (Zalasiewicz, 2008, p. 189). Fossils of Homo sapiens will 
also appear in proximity to trace fossils (although in much less abundance), thus enabling a link between 
the Urban Stratum and our species. 
 
Thus, trace fossils associated with Homo sapiens will leave for a P2 observer a sort of ‘Human Event 
Stratum’ that “will be a thin and patchy, albeit globe-encircling layer” (pp. 229–230). These fossil remains 
would gain significance once “set against the evidence of a perturbed global carbon cycle, of sudden global 
warming and sea level rise precisely synchronous with – as far as it will be possible to judge – the Human 
Event Stratum” (p. 230). Such a mark will have geological significance – being observable by a future 
geologist perspective. 
 
Zalasiewicz’s (2008) thought experiment provides a positive answer on whether or not humans 
will leave a distinct stratigraphic mark in the history of the Earth. The answer is not definitive. Predictions 
about humans’ stratigraphic footprint are fraught with uncertainties, especially in a scenario as distant as 
postulated in P1. Nevertheless, based on P1-to-6, it seems plausible that a future geologist will be able to 
detect significant anthropogenic stratigraphic markers.  
 
The thought experiment found academic ground in later years, when the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 
2017b) stated that 
 
the most important question with respect to duration becomes: even if all anthropogenic forcings 
ceased tomorrow, would the defining characteristics of the present stratigraphic signal continue to 
be detectable in geological strata? That is, in addition to the unique attributes of the stratigraphic 
record already identified and documented, has the stratigraphic record been set on an irreversible 
trajectory? The answer is clearly yes. (p. 214) 
 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
353 
 
Notably, the “important question” raised is equivalent to that raised by FGA, to which they provide a 
positive answer. Recent scientific literature has been endorsing this view, suggesting that “[h]umankind will 
remain a major geological force for many millennia, maybe millions of years, to come” (Steffen et al., 2007, 
p. 618); that “[i]n a deep-time perspective, long after humans have disappeared, sporadically distributed and 
exposed deep mine/boreholes traces in the strata of the far future might lie several kilometers 
stratigraphically below a stratified Anthropocene palaeosurface” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2014b, p. 7); that “[w]ith 
an ongoing source of CO2, this state of the Earth System could persist for millions of years, as similarly 
warm states have in the past” (Steffen et al., 2016, p. 338, box 1); and that “[i]f in a hundred million years’ 
time an alien civilization writes the history of the Universe, the Earth will be known as the Planet of the 
Humans” (Hamilton, 2017, p. 115). This literature leads to the formulation of the positive future geologist 
argument as follows: 
 
P-FGA (Positive Future Geologist Argument): It is plausible that Homo sapiens will leave 
a significant global signature in the stratigraphic record that will be detectable by a 
geologically distant observer. 
 
It should be noted that P-FGA does not directly address the proposed boundary at ~1950, but rather the 
very possibility and plausibility of anthropogenic records to be preserved in strata (as body fossils, trace fossils, 
etc.). Zalasiewicz (2008) observes that “the human takeover of Earth was, in effect, accomplished in perhaps 
10,000 years, and that interval, at a distance of 100 million years, will appear virtually instantaneous” (p. 
213).328 However, he also recognizes that “the takeover accelerated almost exponentially near the end of 
that brief span [i.e., since the Industrial Revolution], in that humanity has produced more body and 
(especially) trace fossils and environmental ripple effects in the last few centuries than in all of the preceding 
part of that span” (ibid.). While anthropogenic modifications spread slowly and diachronously during the 
Holocene, the last two decades saw accelerated changes reflected in the Earth System as well as in human 
energy regimes (Syvitski et al., 2020) that are an order of magnitude greater than any previous period in the 
history of humanity (Zalasiewicz et al., 2017b). Such changes are recorded in stratigraphic episodes of a 
qualitatively and quantitatively distinct nature than standard Holocene stratigraphy.  
 
How does P-FGA relate, then, in any way to the Anthropocene Hypothesis? P-FGA elucidates the 
conditions of possibility for the formulation of Claim 1 (i.e., Homo sapiens has left a discernible stratigraphic 
signature of significant magnitude in the recent geological history) – a fundamental claim of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. P-FGA argues that humans are capable of leaving a stratigraphic footprint in 
geological records. The Anthropocene Hypothesis argues that humans have already done so. The hypothesis 
asks what lower boundary would best represent this signature in the present, rather than in the future. 
Selecting primary and secondary markers for a GSSP to be located at ~1950 represents an expression of 
 
328 As explained in section 5.2.2, the argument that, one hundred million years from now, the previous 10,000 years 
will appear instantaneous has been implemented against the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
354 
 
our present knowledge of anthropogenic stratigraphic signals. It is a signpost that makes sense now, if P-FGA 
is true. AWG researchers have also indirectly stressed how P-FGA does not corroborate the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis per se. What corroborates the hypothesis is the present existence of anthropogenic stratigraphic 
signals: 
 
the key issue in determining whether or not the Anthropocene has begun is not how long epochs 
are, but whether the geological record that allows characterization and correlation of the 
Anthropocene is already sufficiently distinct and whether its distinctive features and their 
stratigraphic consequences will persist for at least many millennia […] We note here that the case 
being made for the Anthropocene rests solely on evidence documented within existing strata that 
represent past events, as it must. Deposits representing the Anthropocene, such as ‘made-grounds,’ 
are not imagined future deposits, but existing physical units that can be depicted on geological maps. 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2017b, pp. 214, 218) 
 
Thus, P-FGA is an argument indirectly supporting the Anthropocene Hypothesis. It is an argument 
supporting the plausibility (and thus possibility) that Homo sapiens will leave a significant geological signature in 
strata, and its significance as a global and synchronous threshold (from a geologically distant future). 
Formulated as such, it supports Claim 1 in warranting that the conditions for Homo sapiens to leave a 
significant signal in the geological record can occur in the first place.  
 
5.2.1.2 The Negative Future Geologist Argument 
 
It is an age-old view that humans invest much less significance in the natural domain than they attribute to 
themselves. Not a few thinkers throughout history have described human existence as transient, frail, and 
doomed to oblivion. This view of human existence has ancient roots in ‘Western’ culture and is manifested 
in various religious, philosophical, literary, and artistic forms throughout history. Perhaps an archetypical 
example can be found in the Book of Genesis: “By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return 
to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return” (English Standard 
Version, 3:19). This oft-cited passage from the Old Testament foreshadows a theme still traceable in many 
recent and extant belief systems and cultural expressions – from the arts to philosophies such as cynicism, 
existentialism, and nihilism – the perception of human existence as insignificant, or mere ‘dust.’ 
 
For instance, William Shakespeare has General Macbeth exclaim, upon hearing of the death of his 
wife: 
 
 
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, 
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, 
To the last syllable of recorded time; 
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools 
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle, 
Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
355 
 
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage 
And then is heard no more. 
It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, 
Signifying nothing. (Macbeth, 5.5.18–27) 
 
The ‘dust’ metaphor provides a rich exegesis of the human condition in the world as ephemeral, doomed 
to the abyss of entropy and deep time (and space). To be like dust, and to become dust, are vivid existential 
metaphors: humanity is but a blip in the history of the Earth and the universe, and its very own existence 
will leave no traces to safeguard its ontological mark upon reality.  
 
Friedrich W. Nietzsche notoriously shared this view of humanity’s place in the world. In the 
opening lines of the posthumously published On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense (1977), he states: 
 
In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, 
there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most 
mendacious minute of ‘world history’ – yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the 
star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die. 
One might invent such a fable and still not have illustrated sufficiently how wretched, how 
shadowy and flighty, how aimless and arbitrary, the human intellect appears in nature. There have 
been eternities when it did not exist; and when it is done for again, nothing will have happened. (p. 
42) 
 
Literati and philosophers were not alone in considering the meaning of human existence. Science certainly 
contributed to toppling humans from their self-appointed pedestal, as Freud (2014) famously observed. 
The Copernican revolution showed that humans were not at the center of the solar system, and modern 
astrophysics and cosmology show that the Earth is one among 1015 to 1019 planetary bodies in the Milky 
Way – which is itself one among an estimated two hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe. Since 
Darwin, modern evolutionary biology has provided an explanatory framework for the evolution of 
biological species that includes Homo sapiens as one among millions of existing species. One could add to 
these ‘narcissistic wounds’ the modern revolution in geochronology, which defied humans’ chronocentrism 
and teleologism by investing them with only an infinitesimal fraction of time in the Earth’s 4.54-billion-
year history. 
 
This inclination toward the role and agency of Homo sapiens has recently found new ground in some 
environmental fringes. Clive Hamilton (2017) has recognized nihilistic tendencies in contemporary 
environmental literature, arguing that “a new kind of existential defeatism finds expression in the thought, 
now often voiced, that if humans disappear in the next century or two, then the history of Homo sapiens on 
Earth would be a mere blip in the planet’s 10 [sic] billion-year history, whose signs would soon be erased 
by natural processes, and Nature would simply move on” (p. 115). These tendencies are vivid in radical 
social expressions in movements such as the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, a group advocating 
for the extinction of Homo sapiens by abstaining from reproduction. In the ‘Anthropocene’ geological 
discourse, this view is occasionally expressed by pointing out the apparent insignificance of the human 
stratigraphic footprint in light of the Earth’s deep history – thus denying the plausibility, or even the 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
356 
 
possibility, of an anthropogenic signature to be preserved in geological archives. The erosional effects of 
plate tectonics and other geological forces will reduce humans’ traces to dust, rendering them a mere blip 
in the vastness of past and future geological time. 
 
This deeply rooted tendency to deflate the importance (both ontological and ethical) of humans 
should not be directly linked to the negative interpretation of the future geologist argument. Such an 
argument (outlined later in this section) is not nihilistic in the sense of promoting the absence of any value 
concerning humanity’s agency and ontological status. The argument does not deny humanity’s role as a 
geological agent capable of dramatically altering the Earth System, nor does it discourage proactive and 
reactive measures to prevent its consequences. Rather, it reconsiders the geological significance of Homo sapiens 
in relation to deep time, and to the stratigraphic traces it will leave behind. It questions whether these will 
be abundantly detectable from a future geologist perspective to challenge the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
Advancing this type of criticism is not just crucial in developing a transparent and scientifically sound 
framework for assessing the possibility and plausibility of a ‘Human Stratum’ in sedimentary records. It is 
a necessary filter against types of anthropocentrism that, historically, have proven to be a recurrent 
epistemic hindrance when addressing humans, their nature, and their place on Earth. Nevertheless, a 
common denominator among criticism against the Anthropocene Hypothesis has been skepticism against 
the plausibility that a future geologist will clearly distinguish an anthropogenic boundary horizon, and the 
significance the observer would attribute to it. 
 
An insightful example of a negative future geologist perspective is offered by Santana (2019a) – 
partially discussed in section 4.1.3.2. The article briefly explores the methods of geochronology and 
stratigraphy before outlining a hypothetical future geologist’s perspective – which is used to endorse an 
informal use of the term ‘Anthropocene.’ He notes that hypothesizing a future geologist perspective “is a 
radical shift for a historical science like geology, because it requires the historical science to become a science 
of prediction” (p. 1076). Likewise, Santana finds the Anthropocene Hypothesis to evidence this radical shift 
because “[w]ere the Anthropocene to be ratified, it would be the unique division in geological time to be 
based on ‘projections into future millennia’ rather than on evidence of the past” (ibid.). This he defines as 
the ‘future geologist perspective,’ which he contraposes to the ‘synchronic perspective’ – that is, posing the 
scientific as well as political question of formalization of the Anthropocene as a reflection of humans’ 
relationship with the Earth. 
 
The philosopher of science argues against fully endorsing the Anthropocene as a formal unit of 
geological time – and particularly as an epoch-level unit. A central assumption in Santana’s arguments is 
that traditional stratigraphic methodologies cannot be applied for formalizing an Anthropocene 
Epoch/Series “since we’re contemporaneous with the proposed epoch” (p. 1076). This requires 
considering extant stratigraphic signals from a future geologist perspective from thousands to millions of 
years in the future, and determine whether the future geologist will be able to detect anthropogenic signals 
substantial enough to warrant ratification of an anthropogenic epoch-level unit. From this future viewpoint, 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
357 
 
Santana rejects extant evidence submitted by the AWG as sufficient for warranting formal epoch-level 
recognition. This rejection grounds on three main arguments – namely,  
 
(1) Many of our geological impacts can be mitigated by future human behaviour. To the future 
geologist, this may make them relatively insignificant, brief anomalies.  
(2) Some anthropogenic activities are best conceived as continuations of processes that originated 
in the Holocene, so the future geologist will not see them as marking a new post-Holocene 
epoch. […] 
(3) Many clear examples of human impact will be seen by the future geologist as local catastrophes 
rather than geologic events of global reach and long-term impact. […] [E]pochs are typically 
defined by long-term global change. (p. 1078) 
 
If none of these argument applies to a significant marker, “then a future geologist will still have grounds to 
ratify the Anthropocene” (ibid.). However, if the arguments apply for each of the evidence surveyed, then 
there are no sufficient reasons for formalizing an Anthropocene Epoch/Series. 
 
No specific coordinates are explicitly provided by Santana concerning the temporal location of the 
future geologist (i.e., a hundred years, a thousand years, or millions of years from the present). Nevertheless, 
he seems to imply that the year 2500 CE is the observation point for the hypothesized future geologist.329 
Selecting this date is a substantially different premise from P1 as postulated in Zalasiewicz’s (2008) thought 
experiment; it is a geologically minute time interval from the present, compared to one hundred million 
years from now. Logically, if in five hundred years a future geologist will not find sufficient evidence for 
warranting a post-Holocene epoch-level boundary, then there are no reasons to suspect that a more distant 
future geologist will detect such evidence. Furthermore, this also seems to imply that, if five hundred years 
is geologically irrelevant, then present geologists are also not justified in defining a post-Holocene 
Anthropocene Epoch – indeed, this being Santana’s main thesis. 
 
Besides preliminary conceptual implications, Santana (2019a) provides additional observations in 
support of his arguments. He considers whether or not common markers for the Anthropocene – that is, 
climate change, fossil records, human fossils, anthropogenic deposits, chemostratigraphic markers, and 
hydrological markers – are susceptible of (1) to (3). For instance, he notes that sea-level change and 
cryosphere loss associated with anthropogenic climate change “will leave clear markers in the sedimentary 
record” (p. 1079) that a future geologist will be able to observe. However, these markers will not reflect an 
epoch-scale change. For the first thing, sea-level changes exceeding current projections (Sweet et al., 2017) 
 
329 Indeed, when discussing the geological significance of anthropogenic climate change, Santana (2019b) writes: 
“Antarctica alone could contribute another fifteen meters of sea-level by 2500, if greenhouse emissions follow current 
trends. […] Nevertheless, we are not yet justified in predicting that the future geologist will see anthropogenic sea-
level rise as epochal” (p. 1079). Later, he concludes the paragraph by stating: “Come 2500, if the sea level really is tens 
of metres higher than the present, we can revisit the question [i.e., formalizing the Anthropocene], but for now, let’s 
treat that future as something within our power to prevent” (p. 1080). Likewise, the author also seems to refer to a 
geologically immediate future when addressing the fossil record as possible marker for the Anthropocene, suggesting 
that “whether the future geologist will see present-day extinctions as marking a new epoch will depend on our choices 
in the coming decades [emphasis added]” (p. 1081). Thus, the year 2500 CE can be reasonably assumed to be the 
standpoint of Santana’s future observer. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
358 
 
have been documented in paleoclimate studies (e.g., Dumitru et al., 2021; Voris, 2000, quoted in Santana, 
2019a). These changes do not define lower boundaries of epoch-level geological units. Second, projected 
sea-level changes will be largely dependent on future mitigation efforts, meaning that the respective 
stratigraphic traces will be less significant that one might expect. Likewise, future conservation efforts will 
determine the biostratigraphic signature of the Anthropocene. While the fossil record associated with the 
present extinction rates “will provide evidence of this to the future geologist” (Santana, 2019a, p. 1080), it 
is too soon to compare the present number of extinct species to past mass extinction events – which are 
characterized by a minimum of 75% of estimated species lost from observed genera (Barnosky et al., 2011; 
see also section 3.1.2.4). Body fossils of Homo sapiens cannot mark the onset of the Anthropocene, as its 
presence is part of the Holocene biota. However, ichnofossils associated with human civilizations 
(especially fossilized subways) will be “geochronologically significant because they evince novel animal 
behaviours” (Santana, 2019a, p. 1083). Nevertheless, ichnofossils will not be sufficient to define the base 
of the Anthropocene, in that they are an expression of human activities extending throughout the Holocene. 
Novel sedimentary material will represent too fine a grain for a future geologist to delimit a post-Holocene 
unit at ~1950. Furthermore, any future revolution in construction may deflate the lower boundary proposed 
by the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Hence, the proposed boundary is premature in respect to the future 
geologist observer. Lastly, the author grants that the chemostratigraphic marker associated with nuclear and 
thermonuclear bomb testing (especially 239Pu and 240Pu because of their relatively long half-lives) “will be 
an excellent candidate marker for the future geologist” (p. 1084). However, because no radical global change 
is associated with this marker, the future geologist will only be able to associate it with other human impacts, 
such as anthropogenic climate change or accelerated extinction rates – which are Holocene-type events. 
 
How does Santana’s analysis stand in terms of assessing the possibility and plausibility of 
anthropogenic signatures being recorded in stratigraphic sections? As shown, the scenario hypothesized by 
the philosopher admits that a future geologist will be able to detect distinct anthropogenic stratigraphic 
signals, from sea-level rise to plutonium fallout. This makes it plausible (and thus possible) for 
anthropogenic signals to be recorded in rocks and strata from a future perspective. The main point of 
divergence from P-FGA is the significance attributed to these signals. Santana argues that it is unlikely that “a 
future geologist would look back on humanity’s geological influence and see anything that would justify 
differentiating an Anthropocene epoch from the Holocene” (p. 1086). That is because: 
 
Some of our activity lacks the impact of other epoch-defining processes. Other activity is more 
significant, but continues trends of the Holocene rather than breaking with them. The potentially 
most significant human geological effects, however, aren’t inevitable. Mass extinction, nuclear 
winter, and geologically unprecedented global warming are all real possibilities, but it is still within 
our power to prevent them. (ibid.) 
 
The arguments advanced by the author against recognition of an Anthropocene Epoch/Series also find 
motivation in broader social and political considerations. These are beyond the theoretical boundaries set 
by the future geologist scenario (and thus beyond the scope of the present analysis). Within these 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
359 
 
boundaries, a central argument against the Anthropocene Hypothesis is the seemingly diachronous nature of 
the markers used to define the proposed epoch.  
 
As explained in section 3.1.2.6, synchronicity of signals is a requirement when determining the 
beginning of a chronostratigraphic unit, meaning that the events recorded in stratigraphic material should 
be approximately of the same age. However, researchers have observed that synchronicity is relative from 
a future observer standpoint. For instance, Braje (2016) notes that “[t]o geologists living a million years 
from now, it will make little difference whether the Anthropocene began in AD 1800, 10,000 years earlier 
or is marked by the invention of the steam engine or the first appearance of Neolithic tools” (p. 509). 
Similarly, LeCain (2015) rhetorically asks “what could justify doing so now based on changes that have 
occurred over the past 200 years, mere seconds in the vast ages of the Earth gone by?” (p. 19). Even AWG 
researchers (Waters et al., 2014b) recognize that “[v]irtually all stratigraphic boundaries are diachronous and 
spatially heterogenous to an extent that would make any of the potential Anthropocene bounding events 
seem effectively instantaneous, in a far-future perspective” (p. 15). As noted by Edgeworth et al. (2019), 
“the terms ‘diachronous–synchronous’ roughly correspond to the terms ‘near–far’ – not actually absolute 
terms with fixed meanings at all, but relative terms that can be applied to the same thing when viewed from 
variable distances away in time” (p. 338). Other than advancing an argument on diachronicity (explored in 
the next section), this literature suggests that a sharp ~1950 boundary will not be detected by a future 
geologist.  
 
Thus, based on Santana’s (2019a) thought experiment as well as similar literature, a way to concisely 
summarize the negative interpretation of FGA can be the following: 
 
N-FGA (Negative Future Geologist Argument): It is implausible that Homo sapiens will 
leave a significant global and synchronous signature (especially at ~1950 CE) in the 
stratigraphic record that a future geologist will be able to observe and use as a boundary 
horizon.  
 
This argument does not deny the possibility that humans will not leave any stratigraphic record at all; nor 
does it minimize the overall environmental impact of humans on the planet (i.e., it is not a climate 
skepticism argument). Attributing Homo sapiens geological agency is a different discussion than defining a 
stratigraphic unit based on the human footprint on the planet, and critics of the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
too are aware of this distinction (Autin & Holbrook, 2012; Baskin, 2015; Brannen, 2019a; Santana, 2019a, 
2019b). The core thesis of N-FGA is that it is implausible that Homo sapiens will leave a significant global and 
seemingly synchronous marker in the future stratigraphic record. If any trace will be observed by a future 
geologist, it will be unlikely to provide grounds for a chronostratigraphic boundary. 
 
It is an epistemic requirement that chronostratigraphic units should be correlatable on a global 
scale, and that these units be synchronous. Markers of various types (e.g., biostratigraphic, 
magnetostratigraphic, etc.) ensure that each chronostratigraphic unit has a clearly distinct ‘body’ that makes 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
360 
 
it unique from other units, ensuring a consistent and gap-free reconstruction of the Earth’s history. Versions 
of N-FGA deny that such a significant ‘body’ for justifying a clearly distinguishable Anthropocene 
stratigraphic unit will be detectable in future strata. An example is Visconti (2014), who argues that “[t]he 
basic assumption that Anthropocene is shaping the planet is challenged considering that natural processes 
are and will be operating on the planet and have the potential to obliterate any trace left by the human 
activity” (p. 381). Science journalist Peter Brannen (2019a) originally shared this view, stating that “[v]ery 
little of our handiwork will survive the obliteration of the ages. If 100 million years can easily wear the 
Himalayas flat, what chance will San Francisco or New York have?”330 The term seemingly inflates 
humanity’s geological agency “on an ever-churning planet that will quickly destroy – or conceal forever – 
even our most awesome creations” (ibid.). These arguments share a basic skepticism against the plausibility 
that humans will leave any significant stratigraphic trace in the geological record. 
 
By denying the plausibility of preservation of a global and synchronous boundary horizon 
associated with Homo sapiens (against Claim 1), and by drastically diminishing its hypothetical epistemic 
significance for a future (and present) geologist (against Claims 2 and 3), N-FGA is in fact rejecting the 
central claims defining the Anthropocene Hypothesis. N-FGA is diametrically opposed to P-FGA: it denies 
that the conditions of possibility for preservation of anthropogenic strata are met. Thus, if it is unlikely that 
an anthropogenic boundary horizon in the stratigraphic record will be observed by a future geologist, or if 
it is simply too soon to make any such predictive statement (Wolff, 2014),331 then there are no substantial 
reasons to formally recognize an Anthropocene unit at present. 
 
The critical viewpoint raised by N-FGA does not solely address the ~1950 boundary, but the very 
idea that humans may leave a distinct and significant stratigraphic footprint upon the Earth’s history. 
Consequently, this viewpoint also rejects alternative hypotheses attempting to translate anthropogenic 
activities into the domain of geochronological and stratigraphical classification.  
 
While N-FGA adopts a future observer viewpoint to delegitimize present recognition of the 
Anthropocene, other arguments against the Anthropocene Hypothesis consider a present standpoint to 
reject one or more claims held by the hypothesis. 
 
 
 
 
 
330 The author changed his opinion on humans’ stratigraphic footprint (Brannen, 2019b) after the AWG responded 
(Wing et al., 2019) to his initial criticism. See section 1.2.4. 
331 On whether or not it is too early to formalize an Anthropocene unit, Wolff (2014) has also argued “if it may be 
more sensible to describe ourselves as being firmly in the transition into the Anthropocene” (p. 262). A similar remark 
has been advanced by Ford et al. (2014), who argue that “the definition of type sections for anthropogenic deposits 
may be simpler in the distant future when they are preserved as rocks in the geological record and exposures are 
available for study” (p. 77). This particular expression of N-FGA does not argue that it is implausible that Homo sapiens 
will leave a global and synchronous mark, but rather that it is too early to define this mark.

5.2.2 The Diachronicity Argument 
 
At least since the Ruddiman Hypothesis was formulated, critics of the Anthropocene Hypothesis have 
questioned whether the beginning of the Anthropocene should be dated much earlier than the Industrial 
Revolution, and the currently proposed ~1950 CE boundary. One line of questioning lies in the seemingly 
diachronous nature of anthropogenic signals – extending for thousands of years before the present.332 This 
represents “one of the pervasive problems with the ‘Anthropocene’ concept” (Walker et al., 2015, p. 205) 
because the primary and secondary markers used for defining the base of a geological time unit need to be 
synchronous according to the GSSP methodology. The main line of argument is that anthropogenic signals 
typically used to define the proposed unit (e.g., increased extinction rates, ichnofossils, emissions of 
greenhouse gasses) extend throughout the Holocene, so that the Anthropocene is somewhat already 
encompassed in the Holocene. If so, then (1) the Anthropocene designation should remain informal 
(Ruddiman, 2013, 2018; Ruddiman et al., 2015), (2) a Holocene-Anthropocene unit could be officially 
recognized (Braje, 2016; Braje & Erlandson, 2013), or (3) there is neither practical nor theoretical utility for 
the scientific community in formalizing an Anthropocene unit (Walker et al., 2015). The argument is closely 
tied to N-FGA because the farther the future, the more diachronous anthropogenic signals will appear. 
However, it differs from N-FGA in arguing that diachronicity is already visible from a present perspective. 
 
The earliest instance of attribution of diachronicity to the Anthropocene is traceable in the 
Ruddiman Hypothesis, originally advanced by Ruddiman in 2003.333 The hypothesis, which suggests that 
anthropogenic changes of global significance preceded the Industrial Revolution (and later in the debate, 
the Atomic Age) by thousands of years, has been a major competitor of the Anthropocene Hypothesis by 
promoting an informal usage of the term. The debate between the majority of the AWG and Ruddiman 
(who declined an invitation to join the group) has spanned over a decade, and provides an illuminating 
example of the debate over the diachronous nature of the Anthropocene. Recently, the debate was 
articulated in a series of three articles published in Progress in Physical Geography where Ruddiman (2018) 
criticized the Anthropocene Hypothesis, the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019a) responded to criticism, and 
finally Ruddiman (2019) provided a further reply to the group. 
 
In his first paper, Ruddiman (2018) highlights three main flaws in the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
The first flaw is that its proposed boundary (i.e., ~1950) ignores millennia of anthropogenic changes of a 
greater cumulative magnitude. This argument draws on three major pre-Atomic Age changes of global 
reach: (1) the extinction across continents of large mammals in the Late Pleistocene associated with human 
migration, and the extensive forest clearance associated with spreading agricultural practices (< ~12 ka); (2) 
increased methane-emission associated with domesticated livestock and the spread of irrigated rice farming 
 
332 Another early proposal of diachronous attribution to the Anthropocene also appears in Periman (2006), who argues 
that “[t]he Anthropocene begins to emerge when we consider human-environmental activity at a local level, 
compounded by thousands of years, affecting vast areas of interlocking landscapes” (p. 562, quoted in Edgeworth, 
2014b). 
333 See section 3.2.2.3. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
362 
 
across southern and southeast Asia (< 5 ka); and (3) the development of novel agricultural practices during 
the Industrial Revolution, such as the John Deere plow, the McCormick reaper, and later fossil-fuel based 
tractors. These changes represent the “largest transformations of Earth’s surface to date by human 
activities” (p. 456). If the Anthropocene unit is defined by the impact of human activities, then there is no 
point in formalizing a unit that would not account for these massive transformations. 
 
The second flaw is methodological. The AWG (Waters et al., 2018, also quoted in Ruddiman, 2018) 
has argued that “the choice of markers should not be to provide an indication of the start of 
anthropogenically driven effects, but to give the most pragmatic marker that will allow global correlation 
of the chosen boundary, being geographically extensive, temporally abrupt and providing a permanent 
record” (p. 381). This stance reflects the methodological requirements set by the stratigraphic community 
for locating a GSSP – whose primary marker needs regional and global correlation in synchronous outcrops. 
Within the methodological framework, the AWG has considered the ~1950 peak in radionuclides to be a 
suitable candidate for marking the beginning of the Anthropocene. This methodological choice also implied 
rejecting megafauna extinctions, domestication of livestock and crops, and the Industrial Revolution as 
markers for the Anthropocene because of their diachronous nature. Ruddiman (2018) has accused this 
methodological choice of neglecting millennia of significant and global anthropogenic changes. Rather than 
proposing a stratigraphy-based marker, Ruddiman has argued “against any formal definition of the 
Anthropocene precisely because of its basic time-transgressiveness” (p. 457). If a stratigraphy-based definition 
of the Anthropocene ignores millennia of anthropogenic alterations of the Earth, then it is more convenient 
to treat the Anthropocene (or ‘anthropocene,’ without capitalization, as Ruddiman proposes) as an informal 
designation. 
 
The third flaw is practical: scientists will make little if any use at all of a formally designated 
Anthropocene unit. Ruddiman argues how this is already the case for some existing formal units, such as 
the stages dividing the Pleistocene Epoch – the Gelasian (2.588 Ma to 1.8 Ma), the Calabrian (1.8 Ma to 
0.781 Ma), the Ionian (0.781 Ma to 0.126 Ma), and the Tarantian (0.126 Ma to 11.7 ka). Paleoclimate and 
paleoenvironmental research barely ever implement these terms in published research and textbooks. 
Improved radiometric techniques allow probing into recent (i.e., Quaternary) geological time with higher 
and higher precision, essentially bypassing the need for using recent formally recognized time units of low 
hierarchical status. Considering the extremely short time span of the unit advanced by the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, Ruddiman concludes that “most practicing scientists will refer to the ‘anthropocene’ and its 
various [and diachronous] phases in an informal way and ignore any formal late-1900s ‘Anthropocene’ 
designation” (p. 459). 
 
The AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019a) responded to Ruddiman (2018) by considering a formal 
Anthropocene compatible with diachronous anthropogenic variants. First, the group argues that an early 
“Anthropocene as defined stratigraphically should not be equated with ‘anthropogenic’. The Anthropocene 
[…] is not synonymous with anthropogenic activity” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019a, p. 325). This does not imply 
deflating the significance of millennia of anthropogenic impacts, but it denies them the status as the largest 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
363 
 
transformations of the Earth’s surface – as recent global road network development, damming, or global 
loss of wildlife witness. The group considers the steady Holocene atmospheric CO2 and CH4 increase as 
natural rather than anthropogenic – contrary to what is argued by Ruddiman. Additionally, the group 
justifies a ~1950 boundary by recognizing it as a “marked intensification […] of anthropogenic change, taking 
the Earth System beyond the envelope of Holocene conditions” (p. 324). The boundary represents a decisive 
threshold concerning human alteration of the Earth System – an episode of unprecedented magnitude in 
human and Holocene history. 
 
Second, the AWG denies that locating early anthropogenic impacts either in the Holocene or the 
Anthropocene diminishes or downgrades the historical and environmental importance of these impacts. 
An Anthropocene boundary at ~1950 is only consistent with the abundant stratigraphic evidence 
converging by that time, particularly geochemical markers, and the methodological necessities of grounding 
a proposed unit on global and synchronous signals. The mandate of the AWG is “to identify a practical 
stratal and time marker as point of reference in the formal classification of geological time” rather than 
providing “another prism through which to reinterpret human history and environmental impact” 
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2019a, p. 320). Thus, “whether a particular phenomenon lies above or below a 
chronostratigraphic boundary has no significance to its inherent or perceived worth or significance” (p. 
327). 
 
Third, the group claims it is not true that recent (i.e., Pleistocene) geological time units are largely 
useless and unused among scientific communities. The purpose of dividing time into geological units is to 
afford “effective means of arranging and communicating a wide range of phenomena within time and space 
on Earth” (ibid.). Scientists of different provenances will have different ideas of formal time periods (e.g., 
the Greenlandian, 11.7 ka to 8.186 ka), rather than adopting informal and ambiguous designations (e.g., 
Early Holocene). Contrary to Ruddiman, citation metrics show that formal geochronological/ 
chronostratigraphic units of recent time are “arguably more, and not less, widely used by scientists other 
than geologists” (p. 328). While paleoceanographers and paleoclimate researchers may use different 
reference frameworks for studying the recent geological past, correlation of frameworks with the geological 
time scale is a long and well-established practice among Earth science communities. Moreover, the group 
notes the Ionian and Tarantian (used by Ruddiman as examples) are not officially recognized by IUGS 
because they are not yet defined by a GSSP – hence why they have not seen much use among scientists. 
 
Ultimately, the AWG states that Ruddiman’s ‘Anthropocene’ represents a different theoretical 
entity from the Anthropocene Hypothesis. It is a concept representing “the time when human impact 
became significant, the definition of which can vary from author to author and the recognition of which 
can vary from place to place to reflect both individual interpretation of significance and the diachronous 
spread of human influence” (p. 330). This concept is different from the Anthropocene Hypothesis – a 
geochronological and chronostratigraphic interpretation of the ‘Anthropocene.’ If so, then the argument of 
diachronicity does not hold because it is attacking a straw man – that is, it attempts to confute a different 
argument than the one originally advanced by the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
364 
 
 
Ruddiman’s (2019) reply to the group (restricted by the journal editors to 2000 words) reiterates 
and clarifies some of the points advanced in his first article. The reply also appeals to the very research 
practices implicit in the AWG. For instance, it claims that “lead papers by multiple AWG authors did not 
mention several key publications that document large early anthropogenic changes” (p. 347), and that this 
“pattern” (ibid.) omits crucial research produced in recent years focusing on key anthropogenic 
transformations, while only selecting early criticism of Ruddiman (2003). Such criticism essentially attributes 
confirmation bias to research practices of the AWG. Another example concerns the mandate of the AWG. 
Ruddiman (2019) criticizes the a priori methodological stance of the group, setting a disciplinary limit that 
ignores or downgrades “viewpoints from other fields” (p. 349). This criticism seems to view the 
multidisciplinary face of the AWG as simply window-dressing, hiding the strictly geological mandate that 
the AWG in fact attributes itself. While the points raised in this reply represent a rich hub for sociological 
discourse, the main object of this paragraph is the question of diachronicity – which is not raised in the 
reply. 
 
Another major instance of the diachronicity argument comes from archaeology. Archaeological 
research has been especially involved in underscoring the seemingly diachronous nature of the 
Anthropocene as a geological unit (Braje, 2016; Edgeworth, 2014a; Edgeworth et al., 2019; Edgeworth et 
al., 2015; González-Ruibal, 2018; Periman, 2006; Pétursdóttir, 2017). Archaeology (especially archaeological 
stratigraphy) and geology share an early history and practices, but increasing specialization of both 
disciplines led to a separation in their object of study – archaeology dealing with shallow deposits and time 
depths, and geology dealing with the underlying rocks in a time frame of a much greater order of magnitude. 
Nevertheless, this separation recently found renewed convergence in the Anthropocene Hypothesis debate 
– where the extremely recent nature of geological and stratigraphic evidence makes it also archaeological 
evidence.  
 
The AWG member Matt Edgeworth (2014b) has located such convergence in the notion of 
artificial ground,334 arguing that “for artificial ground to be reliably used to inform debate on the proposed 
new epoch, stratigraphical evidence from pre-industrial and even prehistoric periods should be included in 
its classification” (p. 93). Archaeological evidence associated with millennia of human–nature interaction 
leads to three conclusions: first, that Zalasiewicz’s (2008) hypothetical future observer will detect a Human 
Stratum event of a diachronous nature (i.e., diachronicity from a FGA perspective); second, that this event 
should be “broadened out to include Neolithic tells, plaggen soils, sediment built up behind early dams, 
Roman occupation debris, mediaeval castle earthworks, and so on, together with later industrial age 
deposits” (Edgeworth, 2014b, p. 105); third, that from an archaeological (present) perspective, the lower 
boundary of the Anthropocene (identified by Edgeworth as ‘Boundary A’) identifies “the first surviving 
traces of human activity in the material record at any given location” (p. 106) – meaning that the 
Anthropocene represents a diachronous temporal unit. 
 
334 The AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 2.5.1) does not consider artificial grounds as a marker in itself for a 
chronostratigraphic Anthropocene. 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
365 
 
 
The last point may appear as purely a matter of reference frameworks – that is, the ‘Anthropocene’ 
in archaeology differs from the ‘Anthropocene’ as a geological time unit, based on non-mutually exclusive 
methods of analysis and properties observed. In fact, this is the case for many scientific and humanistic 
variants of the ‘Anthropocene,’ each analyzing one or more specific aspects based on the framework 
adopted (e.g., historical, social, ethical, Earth System science, etc.). However, in addition to providing a new 
reference framework to approach the ‘Anthropocene,’ archaeological literature – and particularly literature 
authored by the Edgeworth (Edgeworth et al., 2019; Edgeworth et al., 2015) – seems to contest the very 
validity of a chronostratigraphic Anthropocene, and thus of the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
 
The main line of argument has been that anthropogenic stratigraphy reveals a diachronous 
beginning of the Anthropocene. Edgeworth et al. (2015) notice that a chronostratigraphic framework 
“contrasts with the diachronous character of much archaeological and geological evidence in the Earth’s 
sedimentary record” (p. 2) – which stretches as far back as 13.8 ka (i.e., the Late Pleistocene megafauna 
extinction). The authors argue that, if a geochronological and chronostratigraphic boundary should reflect 
“a substantial change in the Earth system” (Zalasiewicz et al., 2015b, p. 197) recognizable in the different 
physical, chemical, and fossiliferous properties differing above and below the boundary, then this change 
is represented diachronously in “the lower boundary of anthropogenic deposits” (Edgeworth et al., 2015, 
p. 2), or Boundary A. This boundary defines the onset of a spectrum of anthropogenically modified 
grounds, such as “artificial ground of industrial date, archaeological strata, buried infrastructure, quarries, 
landfill deposits, agricultural soils and surface layers of relevant material irrespective of depth” (p. 8). These 
represent parts of a larger stratigraphic entity – the archaeosphere – whose “lower boundary [i.e., beginning] 
can be understood to be a largely continuous [viz. diachronous] allostratigraphic [335] surface extending over 
considerable areas” (ibid.). Boundary A represents the primary stratigraphic marker of the archaeosphere, 
associated with secondary markers related to the appearance of human artifacts relative to their deposits 
below, to fossils of domesticated animals, different physical and chemical composition of soils, and notable 
changes in the character and complexity of stratification. The archaeosphere varies in thickness and 
geographic extension, and lower boundaries include marine deposits (those with higher preservation 
potential) such as “[s]poil and other waste from mining activity, material dredged from harbours and 
estuaries, dumps of ballast from ships approaching harbour, rubbish tipped overboard from boats, plastic 
debris from multiple sources” (ibid.) – among others. Artifacts and technofossils of various origins also 
characterize the lower boundary of the archaeosphere. For instance, pottery represents a novel material of 
wide geographical distribution, just like 20th-century plastic. It first appeared in China at ~20–19 ka (Wu et 
al., 2012), in Europe at ~17.5–15 ka,336 in the Middle East between 11 ka (Edgeworth, 2014b) and 9 ka 
(Gibbs, 2015), in Africa at 9.4 ka (Huysecom et al., 2009), and in South and Central America at 7–6 ka and 
4 ka respectively (Edgeworth et al., 2015). As such, pottery represents a diachronous marker of the 
archaeosphere. 
 
335 See section 3.1.2.3, footnote 190, for the definition and purpose of allostratigraphy. 
336 Early instances of pottery were retrieved in 2006 in an archaeological site located at Vela Spila Cave, Croatia. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
366 
 
 
The diachronous nature of the archaeosphere or Boundary A reflects the diachronous nature of 
the Anthropocene if its lower boundary (1) represents changes in the Earth System detectable in 
stratigraphic records, and (2) includes the appearance of anthropogenically modified grounds. These are 
diachronous aspects which challenge “the rationale of imposing a precise and globally synchronous date 
onto processes that stratigraphic evidence indicates were – and still are – manifestly diachronous in onset 
and development” (2015, p. 19). This methodological choice (i.e., considering the Anthropocene as a 
diachronous lithostratigraphic unit whose beginning is defined by Boundary A) rejects a GSSP-based 
definition of the Anthropocene as a chronostratigraphic unit, considering a diachronous Anthropocene a 
more comprehensive and useful unit for archaeological as well as geological research. This criticism has 
been recently reiterated by Edgeworth et al. (2019) in a paper entitled “The chronostratigraphic method is 
unsuitable for determining the start of the Anthropocene.” 
 
The paper endorses and expands upon Ruddiman’s (2018) ‘three flaws’ previously discussed in this 
section by questioning “the suitability of the chronostratigraphic method for the division of time on 
archaeological and historical timescales, which are several orders of magnitude shorter” (Edgeworth et al., 
2019, p. 335). The authors argue that the emphasis placed on the chronostratigraphic method impinges on 
a stratigraphically sound characterization of the Anthropocene – one that would include anthropogenically 
modified ground (i.e., the archaeosphere). By defining the Anthropocene as a chronostratigraphic rather 
than a stratigraphic (viz. lithostratigraphic) unit with a lower boundary at ~1950, the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis inverts the traditional ‘ground-up’ or ‘strata-led’ characterization of stratigraphic units. As a 
result, the hypothesis is a “case of ideas imposing their authority on strata, using the material record only 
as an index (through the use of stratigraphic proxies), for the date of 1950 has already been decided upon 
for non-stratigraphic reasons” (p. 337). This date, whose selection follows the synchronicity requirement 
of chronostratigraphy, “will be effectively unmappable on the ground” (ibid.) because it would reflect a 
concept rather than actual material strata.  
 
Furthermore, the authors note that diachronicity and synchronicity are relative, in that all GSSPs 
are somehow diachronous – entailing uncertainties of thousands to millions of years. The perceived 
diachronicity of the archaeosphere is only related to its proximity from the present perspective. If the GSSP 
method should be used to determine the beginning of the Anthropocene, then a diachronous lower 
boundary would be consistent with the average uncertainty of GSSPs – unless implementing ad hoc criteria 
for selecting a ~1950 boundary: 
 
different criteria are being applied to different sets of evidence used for boundary definition, 
according to how near or how far away these are in time from the chronostratigraphic observer in 
the present. […] [T]he closer the boundary is to the present, the greater the time-definition 
demanded and the more that so-called diachronous evidence (actually near-synchronous on a scale 
of deep time) is removed from consideration. […] The degree of time precision being asked of this 
latest boundary [i.e., the Anthropocene], within one decade, is over six orders of magnitude (106) 
greater than that of nearly all the boundaries marked by GSSPs in the earlier Phanerozoic. There 
has been a huge shift in the timescale of chronostratigraphic observations from deep geological 
time to the much shallower time frames used by archaeologists, historians, ecologists, geographers 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
367 
 
and other scholars investigating the dynamics of recent times, without any corresponding shift in 
methodological focus. (p. 339) 
 
The argument here outlined is that the AWG is arbitrarily bending chronostratigraphic criteria to justify the 
~1950 boundary without implementing complementary methodologies necessary for the very timescale 
considered by the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This arguments assumes chronostratigraphy (and stratigraphy 
in general) to be unequipped to deal with short timescales, especially when confronted with decade-long 
timescales. The selection of the ~1950 boundary reflects a seemingly synchronous and global signal 
(radionuclide fallout) that is interpreted by the AWG as a satisfactory chronostratigraphic marker. Edgeworth 
et al. (2019) contest this interpretation (and consequent methodological choice), arguing that the 
chronostratigraphic requirement of synchronicity hinders rather than improves a thorough and useful 
characterization of the Anthropocene in scientific discourses. Ultimately, the rejection of a 
chronostratigraphy-based Anthropocene translates into rejecting the formalization of the Anthropocene as 
a geological time unit (since this requires a chronostratigraphy-based boundary). 
 
An interesting and relevant insight is offered by a thought experiment conducted by Schmidt and 
Frank (2019). The experiment – named the Silurian Hypothesis – is very similar to FGA in that it assesses 
the likelihood that a future civilization will be able to detect signs of an industrialized civilization in the 
geological record. The authors consider the stratigraphic markers of the Anthropocene and compare them 
to previous Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cretaceous events of geological significance – e.g., Paleocene–Eocene 
Thermal Maximum (PETM), Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM-2), oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), and 
extinction events from the Late Devonian (380–360 Ma) through the Carboniferous (305 Ma) to the end-
Permian extinction event (252 Ma). They find “undoubted similarities between previous abrupt events in 
the geological record and the likely Anthropocene signature in the geological record to come” (p. 148) – 
such as warming, variations in atmospheric δ13C, disruption of the nitrogen cycle, carbon dioxide output, 
and the magnitude of changes. However, they question the possibility of detecting an Anthropocene event 
in a section only a few centuries old, so that “direct isolation of an industrial cause based only on apparent 
timing is also not conclusive” (p. 148). They do not deny that a clear signature of an Anthropocene event 
will be left in geological traces. In fact, they observe that multiple proxies (e.g., geochemical, 
biostratigraphic, lithological, mineralogical) of the Anthropocene located in ocean sediment layers will 
provide a unique combination demarcating “a clear transition of faunal taxa prior to the event compared 
with afterwards” (p. 146). Nevertheless, they note that, from a future perspective, “the Anthropocene will 
likely only appear as a section a few cm thick, and appear almost instantaneously in the record” (p. 144), 
and that its significance will likely depend on future scenarios. 
 
Further instances of the diachronicity argument are detectable across the Anthropocene scientific 
literature. For instance, Autin and Holbrook (2012) observe that a “global marker could be diachronous 
across millennia if human-accelerated sedimentation were the specific attribute used to mark the basal 
Anthropocene” (p. 60). This is because “[a] distinct stratigraphic marker [for the Anthropocene] should 
have been forming since anthropogenic change began” (p. 60). While this point is questioned by the AWG 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
368 
 
(as delineated in the recent Ruddiman debate), the authors – writing roughly three years after the formation 
of the AWG – invoke the diachronous nature of anthropogenic signals as a possible epistemic hindrance 
to the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Geologists S. J. Gale and P. G. Hoare (2012) recognize “serious 
difficulties in using stratigraphic methods to define the base of the Anthropocene,” partly because of the 
“worldwide diachroneity of human impact and the difficulty of establishing a single chronological datum 
for the epoch” (p. 1493). Similarly to Ruddiman (2018) and Edgeworth et al. (2015; 2019), defining a ~1950 
boundary would be of little use in characterizing anthropogenic impact on the planet. Consequently, a 
stratigraphic Anthropocene would be mostly “unnecessary, constraining and arbitrary” (Gale & Hoare, 
2012, p. 1494). 
 
The literature surveyed in this section converges toward diachronicity as a central problem in the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. This issue can be discretely analyzed as the following argument: 
 
DA (Diachronicity Argument): The diachronous nature of the stratigraphic markers 
characterizing anthropogenic impacts on the Earth makes any chronostratigraphic 
definition of the Anthropocene epistemically problematic or unnecessary. 
 
Notably, DA expresses the problematic or unnecessary nature of any chronostratigraphic definition of the 
Anthropocene. Because extant geological research favors the GSSP method (a chronostratigraphic method) 
for determining the beginning of most geological units in the Phanerozoic (Salvador, 1994), rejecting a 
chronostratigraphy-based definition of the Anthropocene means rejecting any formal definition of the 
proposed unit as a geochronological/chronostratigraphic unit. Thus, DA does not solely criticize the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis and its proposed ~1950 boundary, but also (1) the very methodology chosen 
for defining it (i.e., chronostratigraphy), (2) any alternative date based on such methodology, and (3) the 
general utility of formal recognition for the broader geological and scientific community (this latter point is 
also discussed separately in section 5.2.4). For these reasons, researchers advancing DA have suggested the 
informal use of ‘anthropocene’ (non-capitalized), or abandoning the Anthropocene Hypothesis in the 
context of stratigraphic and chronostratigraphic classification. 
 
 As anticipated at the beginning of the section, DA is very close to FGA because from the latter 
viewpoint, any timespan as geologically ‘short’ as the appearance of Homo sapiens will appear almost 
synchronous from a hundred-million-years future perspective. Therefore, diachronicity and synchronicity 
are not absolute properties, being always dependent upon a given temporal reference framework. This is 
not unknown to the AWG (Waters et al., 2014b), who also recognize that “[v]irtually all stratigraphic 
boundaries are diachronous and spatially heterogenous to an extent that would make any of the potential 
Anthropocene bounding events seem effectively instantaneous, in a far-future perspective” (p. 15). 
However, DA does not require a future perspective (either hundreds or millions of years in the future) 
because it argues that diachronicity is already visible from the present perspective. This is possible by noting 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
369 
 
anthropogenic impacts on the Earth through time, and correlating them to significant biotic, environmental, 
and climate changes recorded in stratigraphic signals.  
 
The rationale behind DA is that, if an Anthropocene time unit should be characterized by 
anthropogenic impacts globally detectable in stratigraphic layers, then millennia of anthropogenic 
modifications of land (associated with agriculture, livestock, urbanization, etc.) should be included in the 
definition of the unit. If not, then a selected chronostratigraphic boundary at ~1950 would create a 
seemingly ‘empty’ or ‘thin’ Anthropocene – not reflecting the (diachronous) signals that engendered it over 
the course of millennia of human history. While the AWG argues that this rationale does not mirror the 
practices of geochronology and chronostratigraphy, DA reiterates that such methodology is fundamentally 
incapable of dealing with the timespan it seeks to explain and translate in geological terms. In short, the 
epistemic gains of selecting a ~1950 boundary through a GSSP-based method are largely inferior compared 
to the gains of using an informal ‘anthropocene’ whose identity includes millennia of anthropogenic 
activities. 
 
DA is a powerful argument against the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and many researchers on the 
‘Anthropocene’ have endorsed this perspective – especially researchers involved in human history and 
paleohistory, where gradual, cumulative, and transformative changes (rather than sharp threshold events) 
are customary. Its importance for the Anthropocene Hypothesis as well as Anthropocene Studies is 
paramount – having ignited a range of intense and prolific debates over the nature of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
either as an Earth System singularity, geological time unit, or historical event. 
 
5.2.3 The Unorthodoxy Argument  
 
Another recurrent type of criticism against the Anthropocene Hypothesis concerns its methodological and 
procedural orthodoxy. The term ‘orthodoxy’ (ὀρθοδοξία) translates literally from the Greek as ‘correct 
opinion,’ and more generally as adherence to an established creed or norm. In this context, orthodoxy 
reflects adherence to the general protocols and norms established by the stratigraphic community, and 
criticism of unorthodoxy questions the adherence of the Anthropocene Hypothesis to such protocols or 
norms. This is an important line of criticism because it unveils the deeper normative-methodological aspects 
of the Anthropocene Hypothesis anticipated in section 1.3.1. Such criticism unfolds in several ways, from 
questioning the methods and practices of the AWG to disputing the stratigraphic nature of the evidence and 
claims supporting the hypothesis. The common denominator among this criticism is that the hypothesis 
(and the AWG) does not adhere to the traditional norms and procedures of geochronological and 
stratigraphic research (contra the AWG’s self-proclaimed adherence to such norms). In the words of 
environmental activist Kierán Suckling (2014), the ‘Anthropocene’ “immediately stands out as an anomaly.” 
If so, then the seemingly ‘unorthodox’ nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis casts doubts on the 
stratigraphic nature of the hypothesis. Such an argument can be summarized in the following way: 
 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
370 
 
UnA (Unorthodoxy Argument): The Anthropocene Hypothesis is not a stratigraphic 
hypothesis because it does not reflect the standard methods, practices, and evidence of 
stratigraphic classification. 
 
UnA represents a pool of diversified criticism rather than a single line of argument. This section explores 
three selected accusations of ‘unorthodoxy’ of particular relevance in debating the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, namely, (1) the seemingly wrong and misleading choice of the term ‘Anthropocene’ (Bonneuil, 
2015; Gale & Hoare, 2012; Gibbard & Lewin, 2016; Gibbard & Walker, 2014; Walker et al., 2015); (2) the 
unorthodox nature of Anthropocene evidence and scientific procedure (Finney & Edwards, 2016; Gibbard 
& Walker, 2014); and (3) the hidden activist and political agendas pursued within the call for formalization 
of the epoch (i.e., Claim 2) on the geological time scale (Finney & Edwards, 2016; Schneider, 2020; Visconti, 
2014). 
 
5.2.3.1 The Naming Argument 
 
Accusations of a terminological fault are abundant in ‘Anthropocene’ literature.337 The humanities and 
social sciences have primarily been concerned that the implicit Anthropos in the ‘Anthropocene’ term may 
have important implications for the way humanity is portrayed in engendering the proposed epoch. 
However, humanists also take notice of the seemingly unorthodox naming choice for geological research. 
For instance, LeCain (2015) observes that “none of the other officially recognized geological periods are 
named for a specific class or order of creatures, much less one species” (p. 19). Similarly, Bonneuil (2015) 
notes that “the naming practice is an anomaly in the stratigraphic nomenclature: until now, geological 
divisions were named after their main flora and fauna composition, not after any causal agent” (p. 19).338 
Foster (2018) also notes that “[i]f the nomenclature for the proposed new epoch were to stick with the 
tradition of mentioning only effects, then the anthropos should receive no explicit mention” (p. 24). This 
criticism suggests an unorthodox naming practice that breaks with the traditional norms of 
geochronological nomenclature. 
 
Within the geological community, researchers have advanced similar and additional criticism 
against the term. Walker et al. (2015) identify two reasons why the terminological choice is misleading. First, 
 
337 For a interesting insight on the philosophy of geological nomenclature, see Davis (2011). 
338 Bonneuil’s observation seems to confuse defining (in stratigraphic terms; see Murphy & Salvador, 2000, p. 235) 
geological units with naming them. Chronostratigraphic units are defined based on (preferably) marine fossiliferous 
records that reflect a given flora and fauna composition in a given time, but are not technically named after that 
composition (e.g., the terms ‘Jurassic,’ ‘Quaternary,’ and ‘Holocene’ are not chosen after species composition; see also 
Salvador, 1994, section 3.B.3). The confusion may arise from the fact that Bonneuil is probably considering Cenozoic 
epochs (i.e., Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene), which are defined on the 
relative abundance of molluscan taxa, and have historically established names that reflect this abundance in 
stratigraphic sequences. Yet, the ISG does not require the naming to follow the fauna and flora composition of a given 
fossiliferous stratigraphic sequence. In fact, it recommends naming a series after “a geographic feature in the vicinity 
of its stratotype or type area” (Salvador, 1994, p. 81). Nevertheless, Bonneuil is correct in noticing that no geological 
unit is named after a causal agent. 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
371 
 
they suggest that the etymology of the term ‘Anthropocene’ (from ἄνθρωπος, ‘anthropos,’ meaning ‘human’; 
and καινός, ‘kainos,’ meaning ‘new’) “makes no sense at all” (p. 205) once literally translated into ‘human-
new.’ The suffix ‘-cene’ has been used to characterize Cenozoic epochs (< 66 Ma), and are indicative of the 
relative abundance of molluscan taxa in stratigraphic records. Hence, terms like ‘Oligocene’ (‘few new’), 
‘Pleistocene’ (‘most new’), or ‘Holocene’ (‘entirely new’) reflect species composition in rocks. However, the 
authors note that, following this naming praxis, the term ‘Anthropocene’ suggests an epoch named after 
the appearance of Homo sapiens in stratigraphic records. This is incorrect for two reasons: first, because 
anatomically modern humans have a long biological history dating at least to the Late Pleistocene (~300 
ka); and second, because discernible anthropogenic forcings are already included in the definition of the 
Holocene. Similar observations concerning the misleading etymology of the term have been raised by 
Visconti (2014), who notes that the “etymology of the word is not consistent with the meaning of other 
geologic epochs” (p. 381). 
 
A second reason why the term ‘Anthropocene’ is considered misleading concerns its seemingly 
self-appointed status of epoch implicit in the ‘-cene’ suffix. Virtually ever since Crutzen’s seminal IGBP 
intervention and article, researchers have been treating the Anthropocene as an epoch, rather than any other 
lower hierarchical unit (e.g., sub-epoch, stage, sub-stage). This initial trend was further reinforced by the 
work of the AWG, which also assigned the Anthropocene the status of epoch as the most suitable 
hierarchical level to represent the scale and magnitude of the proposed period.339 Walker et al. (2015) 
contend that “[n]o consideration is given to the possibility that the ‘Anthropocene’ might be designated a 
unit of lesser rank, i.e. of stage, age, or even sub-stage/sub-age status,” and that “there is no question for 
Zalasiewicz et al. [2015] to consider regarding the status of the ‘Anthropocene’; the decision has already 
been taken” (p. 205).  
 
This type of accusation is very common among scientific literature critical of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, and often follows criticism over the chosen geological rank. For instance, Gale and Hoare 
(2012) note that “there would appear to be strong grounds for reviewing the accepted stratigraphic status 
[i.e., epoch] of the unit” (p. 1494, note 1). Gibbard and Walker (2014) also observe that the suffix ‘-cene’ 
implies, unwittingly or intentionally, that “the term would have Series or Epoch status” (p. 32). Regarding 
this epistemic assumption, they object that 
 
a change of this magnitude is not supported by the geological evidence, the Anthropocene episode 
being too limited in duration when viewed from the perspective of the present, and with too variable 
a global stratigraphic signature to justify its elevation to a time-stratigraphic unit of Series or Epoch 
rank within the internationally agreed geological timescale. (ibid.) 
 
 
339 During a personal interview with Zalasiewicz held on occasion of the ten-year anniversary of the Rachel Carson 
Center (personal interview, November 21, 2019), it transpired that the AWG is willing to consider the Anthropocene 
as an age/stage – if deemed appropriate by the larger geoscientific community. Nevertheless, the majority of the group 
holds to the idea that the epoch level best reflects the nature of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
372 
 
Head and Gibbard (2015) add to this criticism by stating that “it would make more sense to define the 
‘Anthropocene’ at the rank of stage or substage (if formalized at all), as this would maintain the Holocene 
in its useful, entire, traditional and historical contexts” (p. 33). As such, the ‘Anthropocene’ should be 
renamed with the ‘-ian’ or ‘-an’ suffix typical of age-level units (e.g., Meghalayan, Gelasian, Piacenzian, etc.). 
Different members of the stratigraphic community have expressed criticism against the implicit hierarchical 
status of the Anthropocene, suggesting a stage or substage definition, or simply as an event or episode of 
the Holocene.340 
 
An argument summarizing this type of criticism can be formulated as following: 
 
NA (Naming Argument): The term ‘Anthropocene’ is not consistent with the naming 
of traditional geological time units, and reflects an a priori methodological choice 
concerning the status and rank of the proposed geological unit that is epistemically 
misleading. 
 
As observed, the a priori methodological choice is reflected in the adoption of the ‘-cene’ suffix, which leads 
to the assumption that the Anthropocene should be treated as an epoch-level time unit. NA argues this 
choice to be epistemically misleading because rank level is assigned only after a substantial and justified 
stratigraphic profile has been defined and characterized for the proposed unit. The proposed Anthropocene 
unit, critics argue, seems to have undergone the opposite transformation – from geochronological to 
stratigraphic unit. This unorthodox practice has also been noted by Barnosky (2014): 
 
Past definitions began with recognizing distinctive features of the material rock record, primarily 
the fossils contained therein and their implications for defining biostratigraphic and 
chronostratigraphic units. From those stratigraphic entities, geochronological units (epochs) were 
then recognized. The development of the Anthropocene has gone in exactly the opposite direction. 
An arbitrary unit of time (a geochronological unit), characterized as the time of intensified human 
impacts, was first proposed (Crutzen 2002a, b, c; Steffen et al. 2007), and now the material ‘rock’ 
record – deposits that have accumulated in the past few centuries – is being scoured for distinctive 
signs that could provide an objective material basis for an epoch. (p. 151) 
 
The AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2017b) has acknowledged that the term ‘Anthropocene’ is “not a carefully 
constructed neologism” (p. 208), but rather a spur-of-the-moment word that maintained its terminological 
integrity and impetus after Crutzen’s original formulation. Nevertheless, they also observe that “geological 
time unit terms in general are not the most rigorously constructed or consistent items of language” (ibid.) 
– using the case of the Silurian and Ordovician (named after Welsh tribes) as examples.  
 
Additionally, the AWG argues that ‘Anthropocene’ is a well-established term, citing bibliometric 
figures (i.e., citation scores) and inclusion of the term in English dictionaries. The ISG (Salvador, 1994, 
section 3.B.3, requirement g) allows tolerance and flexibility in choosing names for stratigraphic units, 
 
340 Biologist Valentí Rull (2018) provides useful insight through personal communication with geologists who have 
opposed the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
373 
 
including the preservation of well-established names. Both advocates and critics of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis agree that (for better or worse) the term ‘Anthropocene’ has become widely adopted in scientific 
communities as well as the humanities, the social sciences, and the broader popular and political discourse. 
If popularity is a synonym of well-established, then it seems that the current linguistic expression of 
‘Anthropocene’ is consistent with the ISG naming guidelines. However, popularity alone may not suffice 
to consider ‘Anthropocene’ well-established. The ISG does not provide a rigorous definition of ‘well-
established,’ leaning instead toward an interpretation of ‘well-established’ as holding a long-standing history. 
After more than twenty years, one could make the case that the ‘Anthropocene’ term can be ascribed such 
status.341  
 
Nevertheless, being well-established (either by popularity or historical tradition) does not 
immediately warrant formal recognition as an epoch. If the Anthropocene were to be discussed (or 
formalized) as an Age/Stage, then the ‘-cene’ suffix should accordingly be replaced by ‘-ian’ or ‘-an’ to avoid 
unnecessary epistemic confusion. What NA argues is that such discussion is not considered because the 
terminology implicitly assumes the Anthropocene to be treated and discussed as an epoch. If the term 
‘Anthropocene’ is epistemically misleading, then so is the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This is not merely 
because of the terminology it reiterates, but because it is a central claim of the hypothesis that the proper 
unit level reflecting the magnitude of the stratigraphic signature of Homo sapiens is that of epoch/series 
(Claim 3). It is possible that the content of Claim 3 may change with future research, perhaps attributing 
the ‘Anthropo-unit’ a lower rank than epoch (unlikely a higher one). Indeed, the main argument advanced 
by NA is not against the selected rank, but rather the selection of the epoch level implicit in the term’s 
suffix – suggesting an already widely established rank. While the majority of the AWG agrees on the epoch 
level, criticism surveyed shows that evidence is not conclusive in this direction. Ultimately, it often follows 
from NA that the term should be treated informally, given its seeming inconsistency with stratigraphic 
nomenclature protocols. 
 
5.2.3.2 The Unorthodox Evidence Argument 
 
Evidence for the Anthropocene Hypothesis ranges from traditional stratigraphic evidence and Earth 
System science to archaeology, history, and biology. In the context of formal ratification of the 
Anthropocene as a possible time unit, stratigraphic evidence represents evidence of primary importance, 
and thus the primary object of debate. Such debate is focused around two main discursive hubs, namely, 
(a) that the evidence submitted does not sufficiently warrant recognition of a distinct stratigraphic and 
chronostratigraphic unit; and (b) that the evidence submitted is not stratigraphic in a traditional sense. 
 
341 It should be noted that both popularity and history are relative parameters – relying on factors such as language 
and discipline. The term ‘Anthropocene’ may be popular in some languages (notably English) while not in others, and 
popular in some domains (notably the environmental humanities) and not in others. The central question is assessing 
popularity and history within the stratigraphic context – the defining context of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
374 
 
 
Hub (a) is defined by several arguments advanced against the evidence submitted by the AWG.342 
As also observed by Zalasiewicz et al. (2017b), most criticism of this type accuses the spatial and temporal 
scale of the Anthropocene to be too insignificant to allow correlation and recognition as a distinct unit. In 
his contribution to A Stratigraphic Basis for the Anthropocene (Waters et al., 2014a), Finney (2014) questions 
“how human-induced material bodies of an ‘Anthropocene’ will be shown on medium- and small-scale 
[geological] maps, if at all” (p. 26), given the extremely thin and recent nature of anthropogenic deposits. 
Finney and Edwards (2016) consider the 1945 boundary343 (and by association the 1950 boundary) as 
stratigraphically negligible. They also argue that most of the stratigraphic evidence supporting the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis is based on predictions of preservation of future records. In the present, this 
evidence (bioturbation, excavation, human stratum, etc.) cannot yet be used for defining a stratigraphic and 
chronostratigraphic unit. Anthropogenic records preserved in depositional settings such as lakes, marshes, 
speleothems, coasts, ice cores, and more, are only a few centimeters thick, making them hard to distinguish 
from the lower Holocene stratigraphic profile. Likewise, Gibbard and Walker (2014) consider the 
Anthropocene to be too limited in terms of its temporal span to demarcate a post-Holocene unit, and it is 
thus uncertain whether the proposed anthropogenic markers for the Anthropocene could distinctly and 
adequately represent a Holocene-Anthropocene boundary. This view is shared by Autin and Holbrook 
(2012), who consider an Anthropocene global marker “at best a bit premature” (p. 60). This discursive hub 
imputes the evidence for an Anthropocene stratigraphic and chronostratigraphic unit not to be sufficient 
for effectively (and usefully) recognizing a new time unit. 
 
Hub (b) encompasses criticism against the nature of the evidence submitted – primarily claims that 
the evidence supporting the Anthropocene Hypothesis is not consistent with the ‘standard’ evidence used 
in stratigraphic classification, or that such evidence is simply not stratigraphically relevant. For instance, early 
criticism against the hypothesis from Autin and Holbrook (2012) challenged the stratigraphic content of 
the proposed unit by claiming that “we are left to map a unit conceptually rather than conceptualizing a 
mappable stratigraphic unit” (p. 61). This criticism contested that the evidence so far advanced provided 
any substantial stratigraphic evidence for supporting claims of formal recognition on the geological time scale. 
A few years later, Finney and Edwards (2016) asserted that “[h]uman structures, excavations, boreholes, 
bioturbation of soils (agriculture) and the sea floor (drag net fishing) are not strata” (p. 7) and should 
therefore not be considered (and less treated) as such. This criticism seems to develop along the same 
conceptual line – that is, what is promoted as evidence by the AWG does not in fact represent stratigraphic 
evidence (and thus the ‘Anthropocene’ should be treated informally in a non-stratigraphic context, as many 
critics conclude). 
 
342 It must be noted that the debate is still ongoing, and most geological literature criticizing the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis has been written during developmental stages of the hypothesis (as seen in literature criticizing the 
proposal of using the GSSA method over the GSSP; see for instance Walker et al., 2015; Head & Gibbard, 2015). 
Hence, a systematic review of the evidence submitted by the group is still due (as of April 2021). Nevertheless, this 
comprehensive summary includes evidence already debated by critics of the hypothesis. 
343 The 1945 boundary was originally suggested by Zalasiewicz et al. (2015b). See section 3.2.4.1. 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
375 
 
 
Based on this sample literature, criticism of unorthodox evidence may be summarized in the 
following argument: 
 
UEA (Unorthodox Evidence Argument): The evidence submitted in support of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis does not warrant stratigraphic recognition because (a) it is 
largely unsubstantial and premature, and/or (b) is not relevant in stratigraphic research. 
 
The question of what does constitute stratigraphic ‘evidence’ is complicated, and is located at the 
intersection of history, sociology, and philosophy of science. This represents a meeting point yet to mature 
in extant scholarship. Nevertheless, one could feasibly conjecture that geologists and stratigraphers working 
within certain periods of the Earth’s history make use of different types of methods, and consider different 
types of evidence for interpreting and reconstructing the past. For instance, Quaternary stratigraphy makes 
vast use of (among other things) paleoclimatic research, radiocarbon dating (especially useful for the dating 
of organic material from the past 50,000 to 70,000 years), and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL, a 
technique for dating quartz minerals used in late Quaternary research344) to reconstruct the history of the 
past 2.588 million years. Not all of these techniques are applicable for much older time periods, which 
implement new methods and work on different types of evidence for reconstructing the past.345 This fact 
alone suggests that contextual factors of a sociological nature need to be considered in representing the 
epistemic category of ‘evidence’ in stratigraphic research. 
 
In the context of the Anthropocene, stratigraphic evidence has been recognized in the appearance 
of new human-mediated minerals, novel chemical compounds (radionuclide fallout from atomic bomb 
testing), or those anthropogenic activities connected to the formation of a Human Stratum (see section 
3.1.1 and 5.2.1). Because most of these signals are new both ontologically (i.e., are not naturally produced346) 
and epistemologically (i.e., are unprecedented evidence in stratigraphic classification), their epistemic status 
in stratigraphic classification, and particularly chronostratigraphy and geochronology, poses a challenge to 
traditional stratigraphic research – a field mostly unaccustomed with interpreting anthropogenic impacts in 
the context of reconstructing geological time. The fact that chemostratigraphic signals represent the primary 
marker adopted by the Anthropocene Hypothesis for basing a GSSP (despite chemostratigraphy not being 
recognized as an independent stratigraphic method), and the fact that the International Mineralogical 
Association Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names does not officially recognize anthropogenic 
rocks as minerals, are examples of such epistemic challenges to traditional stratigraphy. They also confirm 
 
344 See http://www.usu.edu/geo/luminlab/whatis.html for a short explanation of OSL (accessed on April 19, 2021). 
345 That is not to say that older time units are not defined within the general classification protocol for stratigraphic 
units. Indeed, fossil records provide evidence for life and changes in fauna and flora composition all throughout the 
Phanerozoic. The remark hereby advanced is that there exist different ‘cultures’ or perceptions of what represents 
geological evidence according to the specific time frame considered. 
346 This statement does not imply that humans are not ontologically part of nature, but merely that some materials are 
unprecedented in nature before they were produced and distributed by humans. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
376 
 
the normative-methodological nature of the hypothesis (which implicitly asks for these aspects to be fully 
recognized as stratigraphic evidence). 
 
5.2.3.3 The Ideological Science Argument 
 
NA and UEA question the orthodoxy of the Anthropocene Hypothesis in a way that denies it the status of 
a stratigraphic hypothesis, particularly in terms of establishing a formal Anthropocene geochronological and 
chronostratigraphic unit. In addition, critics have also expressed skepticism about the very scientificity of the 
hypothesis. This skepticism is grounded in the belief that political and ideological rather than genuine 
scientific motivations are major drivers behind recognition of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit. 
More specifically, such criticism considers Claim 2 (‘The stratigraphic signature left by Homo sapiens could 
be translated into a geochronological and chronostratigraphic unit of time’) to be a claim motivated by the 
broader environmental activist agenda rather than genuine scientific research.  
 
This type of criticism is part of a larger and longer debate between scientists and humanists (and 
social scientists) concerning the role of science in society. These debates manifest in different topics, such 
as relationships between scientists and their personal beliefs (e.g., political, religious), between methods and 
meaning of research, between epistemic truth and social good, or the nature of scientific knowledge. These 
topics of a social, philosophical, and historical nature informed conversations about science throughout the 
second half of the 20th century (especially in the 1990s, during the so-called ‘science wars’), and remain 
major topics of discussion in current international and interdisciplinary scholarship about science (especially 
in disciplines such as STS). Amidst these discussions, a hotspot for debate is establishing a boundary 
between politics, ideologies, and activism on the one hand, and scientific research on the other. This 
question can be briefly condensed as following: a hypothetical researcher working on any topic of scientific 
as well as social and political interest (e.g., anthropogenic global warming, cigarette smoke–induced cancer, 
the relationship between gender and sex, etc.) should not allow their own beliefs (e.g., religious, political, 
etc.) to interfere with the practices and methods of science – lest violating basic epistemic tenets of scientific 
research such as neutrality, objectivity, and truth. While this may appear trivial, the fact that scientists are 
always enmeshed within a socio-political and economic context, and may (legitimately) hold political and/or 
religious views influencing or conflicting with a given subject matter,347 makes any sharp threshold between 
scientific research and social values much harder to delineate. Accusations of ideological science or activist-
driven agendas against the Anthropocene Hypothesis stem from this cultural, intellectual, and historical 
background. 
 
As noted by Jedediah Purdy (2015), law scholar and author of After Nature: A Politics for the 
Anthropocene, “the Anthropocene is a political and ethical gambit” as much as a scientific concept. The fact 
 
347 Epistemic issues arising from this type of influence or conflict may take the form of different types of biases 
(selection bias, reporting bias, confirmation bias, funding bias, etc.). 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
377 
 
that the term ‘Anthropocene’ has been widely adopted by environmental narratives and agendas within and 
outside academia corroborates this assertion. Criticism against the normative usefulness of the term 
surveyed throughout section 5.1 further proves that the ‘Anthropocene’ has been invested with a political 
overtone. However, a fundamental premise of this work states that the Anthropocene Hypothesis does not 
entail the same type of normative-ethical (and likewise social and political) statement otherwise entailed in 
the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. Based on this premise, normative criticism, including the political meaning 
and implications of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, seems not to equally hold for the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. Yet, criticism has also accused the Anthropocene Hypothesis of prioritizing political over 
scientific considerations. It is thus paramount to understand whether or not criticism of ideological research 
levied against the ‘Anthropocene’ equally holds against the Anthropocene Hypothesis. A few instances of 
this criticism are hereby surveyed. 
 
Autin and Holbrook (2012) express criticism based on the nature and scientific credibility of 
stratigraphic research. They argue that “[s]cientific disciplines maintain their reputation by providing the 
credible voice a scientific community needs in public debate” (p. 61). The ISC and the discipline of 
stratigraphy provide credibility by meticulously assessing the scientific relevancy of stratigraphic terms 
based on a set of scientifically grounded guidelines (i.e., the ISG or the Code). Accordingly, grounding 
scientific concepts on motives beyond established and corroborated guidelines implies loss of credibility. 
If the Anthropocene Hypothesis were to be accepted by the stratigraphic community, this acceptance 
should be based exclusively on its scientific content and utility rather than the broader social message it 
conveys. However, the authors comment that scientists and environmental activists embracing the 
‘Anthropocene’ (and the Anthropocene Hypothesis) base their motives on the assertation that the 
“Anthropocene creates public awareness and formalizes the concept of human-induced environmental 
change” (ibid.). Against this motive, they contend that the term “may have greater importance in pop culture 
than to serious scientific research,” and that “pop culture does not have an interest in the stratigraphic 
implications of this debate” (ibid.).  
 
A notorious accusation of politically motivated research comes from Finney and Edwards (2016), 
who published an article in GSA Today provocatively entitled “The ‘Anthropocene’ epoch: Scientific 
decision or political statement?” They argue that the term has received wide attention, but that its value in 
chronostratigraphic research has been largely misinterpreted and left undiscussed. Because evidence is 
considered by the authors inconclusive for officially recognizing a chronostratigraphic unit (following 
UEA), they suspect whether the true motives behind formal recognition are political rather than scientific: 
 
When we explain the fundamental difference of the Anthropocene from the chronostratigraphic 
units established by the International Commission on Stratigraphy to proponents for its recognition, 
they often reply that the human impact on the Earth system must be officially recognized, if for no 
other reason than to make the public and governmental agencies aware of that impact. Or, as the 
editorial in Nature (2011)[348] argued, official recognition would encourage cross-disciplinary science 
 
348 The authors are addressing the stance of Nature (2011) concerning the normative-social value of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. The editorial argues that “the Anthropocene does deserve proper recognition. It reflects a grim reality on 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
378 
 
and a “mindset” to understand and to take control of the current transformation. […] Is the role 
of the ICS to make such a political statement? Would official recognition of the term Anthropocene 
as a unit of the ICS Chart realistically have any effect on promoting cross-disciplinary science or 
recognizing that we are in the driver’s seat as Nature editorialized? […] Perhaps promotion of the 
Anthropocene is anthropocentric as well as political? (p. 9) 
 
Similarly to Autin and Holbrook (2012), this excerpt hints that broader social utility (i.e., increasing 
environmental awareness) is implemented as an epistemic parameter among proponents of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. A first thesis advanced is that such a parameter should not be implemented in 
assessing the stratigraphic validity of the term – which Finney and Edwards (2016) question. That is because 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis should be considered exclusively on its scientific content, rather than its 
normative implications. A second thesis questions whether official recognition of an Anthropocene unit on 
the geological time scale / international chronostratigraphic chart would have any substantial effect in terms 
of increasing awareness of the impact of human activities among governments, environmental agencies, 
and the public. This thesis has also seen support by Santana (2019b), as well as by authors rejecting the 
ethical value and utility of the term ‘Anthropocene’ based on EA.  
 
A ‘radical’ example further proves the strong antagonism that the ‘Anthropocene’ and the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis have received from critics. In an article published in the journal The Market of 
Ideas, economist Henrique Schneider (2020) considers the Anthropocene Hypothesis349 to be “indicative of 
how activism is permeating academia, and even science; transforming both from an institutionalized 
skeptical method of discovery and creation of knowledge to a process of rationalization of opinions.” The 
author argues that the “separation of belief and science, or rather, the missing separation between them, 
lies at the heart of the Anthropocene fallacy,” considering the ‘Anthropocene’ a way to confirm the belief in 
climate change on geological grounds.350 His criticism goes so far as considering the ‘Anthropocene’ 
discourse a “totalitarian, or oppressive, project,” in that it undermines the axiom of skepticism that defines 
science by postulating truths of and about the ‘Anthropocene’ with a political rather than scientific drive. 
 
Based on these excerpts from the literature, this type of criticism against the scientificity of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis can be summarized in the following argument: 
 
 
the ground, and it provides a powerful framework for considering global change and how to manage it” (Nature, 2011, 
p. 254). 
349 The linguistic expression used by the author is ‘Anthropocene’ rather than Anthropocene Hypothesis. However, 
because he is accusing the concept of promoting politically motivated science, it seems implicit that he is not simply 
addressing the ‘Anthropocene’ boundary object, but the very stratigraphic hypothesis. 
350 Schneider’s (2020) equation between climate change and the geological ‘Anthropocene’ is dubious in some respects. 
First, anthropogenic climate change mostly (though not exclusively) relates to the discourse on global warming and 
emissions of greenhouse gasses. These only represent a minor aspect of the stratigraphic profile of the proposed 
epoch, as illustrated throughout section 3.1. This common conflation of the Anthropocene and climate change has 
also been noted by Thomas et al. (2020), who hold that “[t]he Anthropocene is sometimes held to be effectively 
synonymous with – or even merely to represent a repackaging of – the science of global warming. It is not that, and 
indeed in some respects global warming might be said to be – for now – a relatively minor, if rapidly growing, part of 
the array of phenomena that make up the Anthropocene” (p. 69). Second, the ‘Anthropocene’ concept stems from 
Earth System science rather than climate change studies. Climate change represents a fundamental component of the 
Earth System, but does not equate to it. 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
379 
 
ISA (Ideological Science Argument): The arguments supporting the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, and particularly its appeal for formal recognition (Claim 2), are primarily of an 
ideological and political nature rather than genuinely scientific. 
 
Implicit in ISA is the fundamental idea that science should be separated from ideologies or personal beliefs 
insofar as the latter are implemented as epistemic parameters for the production of scientific knowledge. This 
separation is traditionally understood as a cardinal aspect of science. On a macro-level, it warrants in 
principle351 that the production of scientific knowledge is not biased, ideologically manipulated, politically 
manufactured, or obstructed on a structural level for purposes outside the scope and aims of science. This 
separation is also considered to be beneficial for society overall. On a micro-level, it provides scientists with 
a prescriptive set of norms to conduct scientific research that delimits the discussions of scientific ideas, 
hypotheses, or theories within certain epistemic parameters (e.g., neutrality, objectivity, pursuit of truth) 
traditionally considered beneficial for (if not distinctive of) scientific knowledge. If such a separation holds 
true, then considerations of broader social utility (e.g., increasing environmental awareness) should not be 
used to assess the stratigraphic validity of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Because ISA imputes such 
consideration in assessing the epistemic validity of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, it follows that the 
hypothesis violates a basic tenet of science, and therefore that the hypothesis is not scientific.  
 
Not all criticism of an ideological nature follows the thesis advanced in ISA. For instance, 
sociologist Jeremy Baskin (2014, 2015) has argued that the Anthropocene Hypothesis “is not simply a 
neutral characterisation of a new geological epoch, but it is also a particular way of understanding the world 
and a normative guide to action” (Baskin, 2015, p. 10). However, because the hypothesis “provides the 
ideational underpinning for a particular view of the world, which it, in turn, it helps to legitimate,” (pp. 10–
11), the proposal is best understood as an ideology dressed as scientific discourse. Rather than a political 
ideology, the Anthropocene represents a scientific ideology based on a partial notion of humanity, on an 
anthropocentric worldview, on an uncritical technological and scientific vocabulary, and on a legitimatizing 
normative discourse promoting planetary management and technical fixes to the ‘climate emergency.’ 
Contrary to ISA, it is the absence of the social and political sphere that makes the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
an ideological discourse. 
 
Similarly, Santana (2019a) – himself a critic of the normative and scientific value of the hypothesis 
– has argued that a strong separation between ‘political’ and ‘epistemic’ parameters in scientific research is 
untenable. Grounded in literature from the sociology of science, he states that “we are sometimes [emphasis 
added] justified in including political motivations among our reasons to adopt a scientific position” (p. 
1088). What makes it the case that the Anthropocene Hypothesis should include a political dimension, 
according to the philosopher, is the fact the hypothesis touches upon issues of primary social relevance. As 
he writes, “[s]ince the environmental crisis is the most significant political situation humanity has ever faced, 
 
351 In practice, scientific research has always been part of a social and political context that influences (even positively) 
how research is conducted. 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
380 
 
we can’t tackle relevant scientific questions without considering the political dimensions” (ibid.). Thus, if it 
is the case that the Anthropocene Hypothesis should involve epistemic parameters of a political nature, then 
ISA does not hold because political claims do not necessarily undermine the scientificity of hypotheses. 
 
Does, then, ISA hold for the Anthropocene Hypothesis? Three considerations may help in 
answering this question. 
 
First, ISA-type criticism (i.e., arguments imputing the Anthropocene Hypothesis of being 
ideological science) exhibits a common semantic overlap between the two theoretical entities identified at 
the beginning of the present research – namely, the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, adopted and embraced also 
by the broader intellectual and activist environmental movement, and the Anthropocene Hypothesis of the 
AWG. As observed in Chapter 2, the term ‘Anthropocene’ was invested with strong normative and political 
significance during the last decade, transitioning from a loose scientific concept to an umbrella term for 
environmental discourse and activism in a very short period of time. During the same time period, the 
concept also developed independently in the stratigraphic context as the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
Reasonably, scientists (especially geoscientists in the Holocene and Quaternary stratigraphy community) 
upholding a separation between science and political activism grew concerned or suspicious of the term 
because (1) it reflected normative messages (propagated by scientists as well) about broader social concerns 
rather than a stratigraphic hypothesis; (2) it received media and public ‘approval’ prior to any discussion 
and eventual ratification within the stratigraphic community;352 and because (3) geologists and stratigraphers 
did not (and perhaps could not) immediately and thoroughly identify the discrete existence of (and thus 
differences between) an ‘Anthropocene’ boundary object and the stratigraphic Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
Thus, it is plausible that ISA-type criticism addresses the ‘Anthropocene’ rather than the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. 
 
A second point relates to the implications of stating that political considerations should not overlap 
with epidemic parameters of a scientific nature. This separation implies that there are some parameters 
delimiting the boundaries of scientific knowledge, and that these parameters are legitimate. Defining such 
parameters is not easy, in that it fundamentally means defining what science and scientific knowledge is – 
a vast and open topic of fundamental historical, philosophical, and sociological interest. Section 4.2 
illustrated how traditional epistemic virtues in the philosophy of science, such as explanatory power, 
intelligibility, and utility, can be implemented to develop a reference framework capable of assessing the 
epistemological status of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. The analysis conducted showed that the hypothesis 
is in fact invested with a certain kind of explanatory power (as a historical hypothesis), it delivers scientific 
understanding of a certain set of phenomena, and it can thus potentially represent a useful scientific 
hypothesis (also contra criticism of its utility, discussed in the following section). While these aspects only 
cover epistemological virtues ascribed by traditional philosophy of science, they suggest that the hypothesis 
satisfies basic epistemic requirements for being considered a scientific hypothesis – regardless of one’s 
 
352 An emblematic example of this informal approval in the media context is an article from The Guardian with the 
(misleading) title “The Anthropocene epoch: Scientists declare dawn of human-influenced age” (Carrington, 2016). 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
381 
 
personal consideration of the hypothesis. If so, then ISA does not hold because ‘genuinely scientific’ 
parameters used to assess the scientificity of the hypothesis corroborate its scientific nature. 
 
Another consideration concerns the relationship between political beliefs and scientific statements. 
In principle, statements such as “Homo sapiens has left a discernible stratigraphic signature of significant 
magnitude in the recent geological history” (Claim 1) may be broadly considered scientific because they are 
based on certain established scientific methods and practices for verifiability (e.g., empirical evidence, 
inferential strategy, methodological consistency, adherence to established norms, peer reviewing, etc.) 
implemented in a given scientific community (in the case of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, the stratigraphic 
community). These methods and practices also serve to validate the truth and falsity of any given scientific 
statement, such as Claim 1. Advocating the truth or falsity of Claim 1 based on political or other beliefs 
unrelated to, or disconnected from, the established epistemic criteria makes the statement unjustified, and 
likely unscientific. This is also the case for corroborated facts such as ‘the Earth is round’ or ‘the heart 
pumps blood through the human body.’ For instance, to claim that ‘the Earth is round’ is true because it is 
politically convenient to consider it true does not make the statement actually true – simply because there 
is neither logical nor semantic entailment between political convenience and the statement ‘the Earth is 
round’ (while there is such entailment in general relativity). Likewise, there is neither logical nor semantic 
entailment between political convenience and the stratigraphic signature of Homo sapiens – a statement (i.e., 
Claim 1) requiring stratigraphic criteria to be regarded as true or false. While this consideration may appear 
trivial, the fact that recent proposals concerning the beginning of the Anthropocene are also based on political 
and social commitments (Maslin & Lewis, 2020) reveals the necessity of clarifying the relationship between 
political beliefs and scientific statements. 
 
The claim that scientific statements should not be based on political beliefs does not imply that 
scientific ideas, hypotheses, or theories do not have political or broader societal implications. This is a very 
well-established circumstance, demonstrated by the virtually all-encompassing influence of science and 
technology throughout the history of human societies. Nor does it imply that scientists should not pursue 
scientific aims considered to be of broader social utility. Much scientific research in the healthcare and 
pharmaceutical sector is pursued (and funded) primarily for its broader social aims. Yet, the implications and 
motivations of pursuing a certain scientific idea should not be confused with the epistemic parameters 
assessing its legitimacy – an overlap not uncommon among ISA-type criticism (possibly due to the 
acceptance of the term ‘Anthropocene’ by the public and in academic discourse prior to an in-depth 
stratigraphic analysis). Positive and socially oriented motivations, and political implications, do not warrant 
sufficient justification per se for determining the truth and/or utility of a scientific hypothesis – such as the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
 The AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b, para. 1.4.4) has expressed opinions that may help in further 
discussing this latter consideration (see also Luciano, 2019; Zalasiewicz et al., 2017b). They suggest a key 
distinction between the broader societal relevance and the scientific utility of formalizing the Anthropocene 
in stratigraphic terms, and the scope of the Group. They state: 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
382 
 
The phrase ‘the scientific and societal utility’ of formalising the Anthropocene refers in fact to two 
profoundly different matters: One is the potential usefulness for science, involving or facilitating a 
paradigm shift (and this is the mater to which the mandate of the AWG study is limited). The 
second is a broader societal relevance due to the enhanced awareness raising (and therefore 
stretching into the sphere of political perception of the Anthropocene), and this is a fundamentally 
different consideration […] What is the point of the formalisation exercise for the society at large? 
– that is the question of societal relevance, which is a beyond the scope of, and independent of, the 
AWG mandate. (Zalasiewicz, Waters, Williams, et al., 2019, p. 39) 
 
The Group does not deny that formalizing (or, conversely, rejecting) the Anthropocene Hypothesis will 
hold political resonance. Yet, the members distinguish between the implications of the hypothesis, and the 
motives behind it – which they claim to be purely scientific: 
 
The final consideration here relates to the responsibility of stratigraphers in specific and scientists in 
general, when faced with geologically relevant evidence of change, to record that change and, if 
appropriate, to formalise it. Geologists, thus, would be in error if they saw a scientifically demonstrable, 
significant and substantial change and did not give it commensurate recognition. (p. 40) 
 
This statement seems to clarify concerns raised by ISA regarding the political motivations (rather than 
implications) of the Anthropocene Hypothesis (concerns which often quote Nature, 2011, as written proof 
of a politically motivated agenda, e.g., Finney & Edwards, 2016; Santana, 2019b; Schneider, 2020).  
 
Thus, if stratigraphic motivations lead the research behind the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and if 
stratigraphic methods and evidence is adduced to support its claims, then ISA-type accusations against the 
scientificity of the hypothesis do not hold. If this is the case, then the Anthropocene Hypothesis is a scientific 
hypothesis rather than a hidden political agenda. 
 
5.2.4 The Utility Argument 
 
One last and crucial argument advanced against the Anthropocene Hypothesis to be discussed in this 
chapter is its utility within stratigraphic research. Such criticism negates that an Anthropocene stratigraphic 
unit, and particularly a chronostratigraphic unit with a lower boundary at ~1950 CE, is a useful addition to 
stratigraphic and geological classification, and consequently to the geological time scale. 
 
Utility is a central parameter in the acceptance or rejection of a scientific theory or hypothesis. Not 
uncommonly in science, usefulness can be regarded as a more decisive parameter than truth itself for 
accepting or rejecting a scientific idea. Indeed, scientific theories or hypotheses may be fundamentally 
conjectural, less accurate, or even wrong to some measure, yet they are maintained as long as they enable 
scientists to tackle and solve certain problems or answer certain questions of epistemic significance. A 
textbook example of such a circumstance is classical mechanics – considered an incorrect description of 
the universe according to quantum theory and general relativity (both held to be true), yet still used for 
dealing with a certain class of phenomena because of its simplicity (and thus utility). This fact alone 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
383 
 
witnesses the important of usefulness as an epistemic parameter for assessing the legitimacy of hypotheses 
and theories in science. Therefore, if the Anthropocene Hypothesis is to be accepted by the stratigraphic 
(or broadly scientific) community, it must prove itself to be a useful hypothesis. 
 
Section 4.2.2.3 marginally mentioned an intellectual relationship between US-American 
pragmatism and US-American geologists by the end of the 19th century. While geographically delimited, 
this relationship hinted at a broader intellectual proximity between the epistemic values (including utility) 
uphold by pragmatism, and the praxis-oriented philosophy implicitly informing geological research. If such 
a relationship exists (at least theoretically), then considerations concerning the utility of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis should appear in critical literature. This is in fact the case, as illustrated by some examples hereby 
discussed. Notably, much of the criticism advanced stems from other arguments delineated throughout 
section 5.2, so that the utility argument is interwoven with different lines of critique of the hypothesis. 
 
In discussing the stratigraphic status of the Anthropocene, Gale and Hoare (2012) observe that 
“[a]ny definition of the start of the new epoch must ultimately pass the test of utility; does it have value to 
those working in the field?” (p. 1494). The authors answer this question in the negative by arguing that the 
stratigraphic approach for defining an Anthropocene unit “may eventually prove of limited practical use in 
studies of human environmental impact” (ibid.). This is because such a stratigraphy-based approach would 
exclude sources traditionally beyond stratigraphic research, such as “tree rings, landscape art and 
documentary records” (p. 1493). These environmental sources (of a diachronous nature) provide a more 
useful approach in defining the Anthropocene beyond the theoretical and methodological constraints of 
stratigraphy. Such an argument is linked to DA in advocating against the utility of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis – that is, it criticizes a GSSP-based view over the beginning of the epoch by advocating for its 
diachronous nature, and consequently rejects the chronostratigraphic (and stratigraphic) utility of the 
hypothesis. 
 
Autin and Holbrook (2012) endorse UEA by criticizing the empirical content of the proposed 
Anthropocene unit.353 They argue that the proposed unit only reflects a conceptual stratigraphic unit rather 
than a mappable unit. Since geological research overall heavily relies on geological mapping (i.e., the 
mapping of rock units or strata to show salient properties such as lithology or age), the usefulness of a 
‘conceptual’ rather than ‘practical’ unit is questioned. Indeed, the authors state that the “Anthropocene 
provides eye-catching jargon, but terminology alone does not produce a useful stratigraphic concept” (p. 
61). Similar criticism is also shared by Head and Gibbard (2015), who observe that truncating the Holocene 
(and consequently revisiting geological mapping) would be impractical and would diminish the utility of the 
Holocene, with many surficial deposits by necessity being labeled ‘Holocene–Anthropocene’” (p. 33). 
 
Gibbard and Walker (2014) have considered a formal definition of Anthropocene of little 
stratigraphic value, considering the ‘Anthropocene’ to be more useful as an informal designation: 
 
 
353 Criticism expressed by Autin and Holbrook (2012) is representative of early critique of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, which had been formulated only a few years before that. This criticism should be an object of revision in 
light of the recent summary of evidence provided by the Group (Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b). 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
384 
 
There is no doubt that the term ‘Anthropocene’ has caught the popular imagination […] However, 
the question remains as to whether or not the utility of the term will be as an informal designation 
for the period of recent enhanced human activity, or whether it can be defined in a geological sense 
as a formal time-stratigraphic unit of the GTS […] At best, the Anthropocene might become 
another name for the later Holocene (with a usage similar, perhaps, to ‘Dark Ages’ or ‘Middle Ages’), 
but in a geological context the term would remain informal. Indeed, this view has now been 
reinforced by the Geological Society of America, who have rejected the term from their 2012 
Geological Time Scale because it has no ‘internationally sanctioned standing.’ (p. 35)354 
 
This view does not question the utility of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a normative and descriptive concept 
mirroring the influence of humans on the Earth System. The authors are aware of the environmental 
pressures represented by human societies, and of the social message the term ‘Anthropocene’ has been 
invested with to encompass these pressures. Rather, they address the utility for stratigraphic classification 
of formally recognizing a stratigraphic unit less than a hundred years old (a geologically insignificant time 
span) and, consequently, of truncating the Holocene. This is also considered a major issue for Walker et al. 
(2015), who question the “practical value of a formally defined chronostratigraphic unit that began less than 
a single human lifetime ago” (p. 206). Its extremely short nature makes such a unit “effectively unresolvable 
in most marine sedimentary sequences” (ibid.), and no enhanced understanding of anthropogenic records 
is provided by a discrete chronostratigraphic unit. These precarious epistemic conditions make the term 
‘Anthropocene’ more useful as an informal category, rather than a stratigraphy- and chronostratigraphy-
based term.  
 
Finney (2014) considers the utility of the Anthropocene geochronological/chronostratigraphic unit 
one of the fundamental issues that the AWG needs to tackle. The geologist notes that a vast number of 
significant events in the Earth System history are not reflected as distinguished units in the geological time 
scale / international chronostratigraphic chart. The evolution and continental spread of vascular land plants 
is an example of organism-induced upheaval in the Earth System (vastly outweighing the impact of Homo 
sapiens throughout its history) that is not represented as a geochronological/chronostratigraphic unit. If 
such far-reaching changes do not define the base of any existing time unit, “[w]hy should human impact on 
the Earth system be different? Might the desire to establish the ‘Anthropocene’ as a formal unit be 
anthropocentric?” (p. 27). These rhetorical questions cast doubts on the practical utility (and epistemic 
validity) of an Anthropocene time unit as well as its basic epistemic assumptions.355  
 
Smith and Zeder (2013, see section 3.2.2.1), proponents of an early Anthropocene hypothesis, have 
contested the utility of placing the beginning of the Anthropocene at ∼1950 CE. Their hypothesis locates 
the beginning of the Anthropocene at ∼11–9 ka, coinciding with increasing human niche construction 
activities such as plant and animal domestication. The authors suggest that, “[i]n considering the practical 
 
354 While the Anthropocene did not appear in the 2012 geological time scale (nor in the later 2018 version, see 
https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/Education_Careers/Geologic_Time_Scale/GSA/timescale/home.aspx, accessed 
on July 5, 2021), the proposed epoch was included in the two-volume 2020 edition of Geological Time Scale, edited by 
Felix M. Gradstein, James G. Ogg, Mark Schmitz, and Gabi Ogg. 
355 A similar argument is advanced by Foster (2018), who also uses the case of the planetary changes caused by 
cyanobacteria as an example of a dramatic event with no linked chronostratigraphic unit. 

AGAINST THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
385 
 
or utility value of designating a new Anthropocene epoch, the emphasis […] should be placed on gaining a 
greater understanding of the long-term and richly complex role played by human societies in altering the 
earth’s biosphere” (p. 12). This criticism is similar to the issues raised by DA. It states that a ∼1950 CE 
boundary would dismiss millennia of human activities and impacts on the Earth, and would consequently 
be largely useless for framing the stratigraphic footprint of humanity on rock records. 
 
Based on this literature, criticism of usefulness can be summarized through the following argument: 
 
UtA (Utility Argument): The empirical body, rationale, and purpose of the proposed 
Anthropocene stratigraphic and geochronological/chronostratigraphic unit make it of 
little practical value in the context of stratigraphic classification. 
 
The argument is straightforward: geoscientists, and especially Quaternary and Holocene geologists, would 
find little utility in defining the beginning of a new series/epoch at ~1950 CE. Notably, UtA is specifically 
restricted to stratigraphic classification, and to geochronology and chronostratigraphy. It does not negate 
nor diminish any value (scientific or not) that the term ‘Anthropocene’ may hold in other knowledge 
domains. In fact, most critics seem to agree that the term may still have value in the broader social and 
environmental arena as an informal designation for the present time period (Edgeworth et al., 2019; 
Edgeworth et al., 2015; Finney & Edwards, 2016; Gibbard & Walker, 2014; Ruddiman, 2018). The term is 
widely used in disciplinary contexts such as Earth System science, where it reflects a dramatic transition of 
the Earth System associated with socio-economic trends; in evolutionary biology and ecology, where the 
term is associated with accelerated anthropogenic extinctions and increased human niche construction 
activities (Ceballos et al., 2015; Ellis, 2016b); and in archaeological research, where the term expresses the 
diachronous onset of the Human Stratum or Boundary A (Edgeworth et al., 2015). A shared feature among 
these knowledge domains is that the ‘Anthropocene’ is not bounded to the issue of formal ratification, 
representing indeed an informal threshold-event of broader semantic reach.  
 
The question of the utility of the Anthropocene has been tackled by the AWG (Zalasiewicz et al., 
2019b, para. 1.4.1). As discussed in section 4.2.3, the Group has advocated for the social, stratigraphic, and 
theoretical utility of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit. The stratigraphic (and broadly geological) 
utility of the proposed unit lies in the possibility of mapping anthropogenic deposits – both on a local scale 
(i.e., for engineering geology) and a global one (i.e., the Human Stratum developed by human dwellings) – 
in a way that reflects their significance and the magnitude of this sedimentary record. In other words, the 
Anthropocene would ‘explain’ (sensu lato) anthropogenic signals in stratigraphic terms – granted that this 
signature exhibits properties of unavoidable interest for geological research. Such a unit would reflect major 
short and long-term anthropogenic changes in the Earth System, from physical records of a 
lithostratigraphic nature to climate and, more permanently, the Earth’s biota. These changes “can already 
be reasonably said to be of long-term significance to the geological record,” making the Anthropocene 

DEBATING THE ANTHROPOCENE HYPOTHESIS 
386 
 
“geologically ‘real’ both as a unit of time and process and as a distinctive stratal unit across a large range of 
environment” (p. 33). 
 
Ultimately, the question of scientific utility is largely a social affair – that is, it is assessed within a 
certain community considering the hypothesis worth accepting or not. The history of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept shows that some scientific communities, such as Earth System science and water sciences, have 
found epistemic as well as practical utility in the term. It defined a time threshold after which natural systems 
(e.g., river systems, biogeochemical cycles, etc.) operate differently due to the overwhelming presence and 
impact of humans. As such, the term was perceived as useful in describing a particular state of affairs. In 
stratigraphy, and particularly chronostratigraphic classification, the AWG has advocated for the utility of 
formally recognizing the proposed time unit, but the hypothesis has not been unanimously accepted (not 
even by some members of the group). Validating the broader utility of the hypothesis will be assessed during 
the process of formal ratification of geological units set by the Guide, which lies in the judgment of the SQS, 
ICS, and finally IUGS.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This research attempted a historical and philosophical study of the birth and epistemology of the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
 
A central goal of this endeavor was to legitimize and articulate a conceptual distinction between 
the ‘Anthropocene’ as a boundary object, and the Anthropocene Hypothesis as the scientific, and 
specifically stratigraphic, interpretation of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Arguments for legitimatizing this distinction 
both theoretically and practically have been advanced, particularly in respect to delimiting the 
epistemological identity of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and in providing a solution to the issue of 
definition. Such a distinction would be beneficial for all parties involved in Anthropocene Studies, providing 
a conceptual and linguistic roadmap helpful for navigating heated and socially relevant debates over the 
nature, meaning, and scope of the ‘Anthropocene’ as concept and as a proposed geochronological and 
chronostratigraphic unit. This roadmap does not hinder any possible future analysis on the relationship 
between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis, nor does it aim to dissolve the semantic 
potential of the ‘Anthropocene’ exclusively into its stratigraphic variant. On the contrary, by clarifying the 
conceptual and semantic relationship between these, the research attempted to deliver a toolkit for 
‘Anthropocene’ scholars, researchers, and students alike to approach and/or contribute to this highly 
debated scientific hypothesis  
 
A related goal was to answer the questions What is the Anthropocene Hypothesis? and What does it mean 
for the Anthropocene Hypothesis to represent a scientific hypothesis? 
 
The first question was answered by probing the historical, empirical, epistemological, and social 
context of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This inquiry characterized the epistemology of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis as the epistemology of a scientific hypothesis. This seemingly trivial statement is in fact very 
informative: it answers what the Anthropocene Hypothesis represents not solely amidst the theoretical 
impasse of defining the ‘Anthropocene,’ but also in light of accusations of politically motivated science or

of being a pop culture phenomenon, and amidst otherwise ambiguous criticism (i.e., against the 
‘Anthropocene’ and/or the Anthropocene Hypothesis). Indeed, the research showed that attributes typical 
of scientific knowledge production are defining characteristics of the Anthropocene Hypothesis.  
 
The second analogous question was answered by scrutinizing the theoretical implications of 
characterizing the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific hypothesis. In terms of conceptual history, the 
predominantly scientific characterization of the ‘Anthropocene’ idea has been retrieved by surveying early 
research literature. Authors, texts, and communities within the natural sciences were the primary drivers in 
the survival, spread, and evolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. The research correlated this 
predominantly scientific history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept to the birth of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. In philosophical terms, considering the hypothesis as a scientific hypothesis means that it 
should exhibit those epistemic virtues traditionally ascribed to scientific thought. The research showed that 
the hypothesis, as a historical hypothesis (viz. dealing with past events), exhibits epistemic virtues not solely 
related to empirical adequacy or adherence to the standard norms of stratigraphic classification, but also in 
terms of explanatory power and intelligibility. These epistemic aspects of vast philosophical interest might 
need proper consideration when a formal proposal is submitted in the years ahead. 
 
The conceptual differences between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and 
the development of an epistemological identity of the latter, were delineated throughout each chapter. This 
was done by tackling salient aspects of the Anthropocene Hypothesis in terms of its core claims, its history, 
its empirical body, its epistemological structure, and the debate surrounding it. Here, the main findings of 
each chapter are highlighted. 
 
The analysis conducted in Chapter 1 framed the broader academic and intellectual scenario 
engendered by Anthropocene Studies. It showed that many research trajectories, often overlapping, but 
also differentiating from one another, gravitate around the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. These research 
trajectories transformed the term from much more than mere technical jargon of a geochronological and 
chronostratigraphic provenance. Indeed, over the past two decades, the term has assumed different nuances 
unified by the basic assumption and belief that humans have become an environmental force and geological 
agent to be reckoned with. While extremely beneficial in approaching the ‘Anthropocene’ as a polysemantic 
object, this multidisciplinary surge in interest caused an intrinsic challenge – that is, the issue of definition. 
This issue pertains to the formulation of an ‘Anthropocene’ concept that (1) is not simply reduced to 
personal interpretations, (2) is not restricted to a single disciplinary domain, and (3) is a shared category 
providing functional knowledge across disciplinary domains and fields of knowledge. 
 
A way to face this challenge is considering the conceptual history of the ‘Anthropocene.’ The 
statement ‘history of the Anthropocene’ is ambiguous, and opens up various interpretative avenues 
depending on the emphasis and nuance given to ‘history’ or ‘Anthropocene.’ Among the research areas that 
evolved within this semantic ambiguity, one in particular is useful for framing the stratigraphic variant of 
the ‘Anthropocene’ – namely, the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a concept and idea. Within this approach, 
scholars have been divided between ‘continuists’ and ‘discontinuists,’ with the former advocating for a 

 
389 
 
genealogical understanding of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the latter arguing for a seemingly theoretical 
singularity that the concept entails, broken off from previous conceptual antecedents. It has been observed 
that both stances provide interesting insights into the conceptual history and nature of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
However, they fail to properly recognize the ‘Anthropocene’ concept as a discrete instance of geological reflexivity 
– that is, a discrete and autonomous idea that subscribes to a meta-historical tradition of anthropogenically 
defined geological time units – by separating between a paleo-history, pre-history, and modern history of the 
‘Anthropocene’ concept. This framework enables the reconstruction of the birth of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis by looking at the modern history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept as a discrete occurrence of 
geological reflexivity over the stratigraphic footprint of humanity, and by reconsidering a historical period 
(i.e., 2000–2009) particularly valuable for this endeavor. 
 
The analysis further distinguished between normative and descriptive research in Anthropocene 
Studies. Approaching the concept this way allowed the separation of the ‘Anthropocene’ as a broader social 
category fraught with ethical, political, and aesthetic values, and the Anthropocene Hypothesis as the 
descriptive and normative-methodological stratigraphic formulation of the ‘Anthropocene.’ Three central 
claims were identified as characteristic of the hypothesis – namely, Claim 1, ‘Homo sapiens has left a 
discernible stratigraphic signature of significant magnitude in recent geological history’; Claim 2, ‘The 
stratigraphic signature left by Homo sapiens could be translated into a geochronological and 
chronostratigraphic unit of time’; and Claim 3, ‘The proper unit level reflecting the magnitude of the 
stratigraphic signature of Homo sapiens in the geological time scale and international chronostratigraphic 
chart is that of epoch/series.’ These represent the ‘hardcore’ (to borrow terminology from philosopher 
Imre Lakatos) of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. They condense the central aims and epistemic context of 
the hypothesis, and distinguish it in purpose and content from its parent concept of the ‘Anthropocene.’ 
The separation between the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis is considered beneficial for 
overcoming the issue of definition, avoiding diatribes over the ‘true meaning’ of the ‘Anthropocene,’ 
defining the object of analysis that philosophers of science should consider, and resolving naming-related 
issues raised by humanists and social scientists. In addition to these broader benefits, this distinction 
facilitates a discrete analysis of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, focalizing the relevant epistemological 
features pertaining to stratigraphic research (e.g., empirical evidence, epistemic context, debates, etc.). 
 
The birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis was explored in Chapter 2 by using complementary 
quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, this analysis required focusing on the early modern 
history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, and on how the academic context that emerged engendered the 
evolution of its stratigraphic variant. It was recognized that a genealogical approach is the predominant 
trend in reconstructing the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept. While of undoubtable value, this 
approach has largely overseen the more recent history of the term, particularly the 2000–2009 decade – a 
time span encompassing the birth, survival, spread, and evolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ idea. This time 
frame was considered of primary value and interest for reconstructing the birth of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. In analyzing literature produced within this time span, the research brings previously

unexplored literature into discussions over the genesis of the ‘Anthropocene’ idea. It also reconsiders the 
roles of individual disciplinary domains in engendering the ‘Anthropocene’ idea and in defining the 
preconditions for the birth of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Text mining techniques focusing on the appearance of the term ‘Anthropocene’ in early research 
literature (i.e., 2000–2009) were implemented for the quantitative approach. This method allowed the survey 
of a corpus of 670 written records based on the relative frequency of the term ‘Anthropocene’ for each 
record. This numerical value was used as a proxy for authors’ engagement with the term, and to separate 
between a ‘central’ and ‘peripheral’ literature. Additionally, the corpus was divided based on publication 
year, field of knowledge, discipline, format, and language – all clusters considered useful in reconstructing 
the early modern history of the ‘Anthropocene.’ The corpus is considered semi-complete, meaning that it 
is comprehensive enough to faithfully represent how early research literature assimilated and disseminated 
the term ‘Anthropocene’ (i.e., no ‘hidden literature’).  
 
Findings show that the term spread relatively slowly during its first decade of existence, while it 
surged remarkably in the following decade. The natural sciences were by a substantial margin the 
predominant field of knowledge where the term spread (483 records), followed by the social sciences (233), 
applied sciences (46), and humanities (34). Consistently with this finding, scientific disciplines were the 
primary branches of knowledge where the term appeared in the literature, particularly in geology (99), Earth 
System science (87), oceanography (76), climatology (71), and ecology (61) – among others. Among the 
social sciences, environmental studies (82) stands out as the discipline with the most records by a factor of 
two, followed by sustainability studies (41), human geography (27), history (26), sociology (24), and political 
science (23). Resource management (17) and engineering (13) were the primary recipients of the 
‘Anthropocene’ among applied sciences. In the humanities, ecocriticism (12) and philosophy (12) are the 
disciplines with the most records, representing more than two-thirds of all humanistic engagement.  
 
The vast majority of records are of English-language provenance (637), although non-English 
records (33) cannot be fully considered as emblematic of language- or geography-based assimilations of the 
term. Journal articles (411) were the primary academic vehicle for transmission and spread of the term by 
an outstanding margin, followed by book sections (108), books (37), book reviews (36), and abstracts (25). 
The vast majority of literature composing the corpus is recognized as peripheral literature (587), whilst only a 
minority constitutes central literature (83). Lastly, the disciplines most representative of the central literature 
(i.e., with high normalized engagement factor per discipline, (En(D)) are geology (En(D) = 2.12), Earth System 
science (En(D) = 1.72), environmental science ((En(D) = 1.54), soil science (En(D) = 1.43), chemistry (En(D) 
= 1.36), political science (En(D) = 1.30), oceanography (En(D) = 1.18), history (En(D) = 1.15), climatology 
(En(D) = 1.13), and human geography (En(D) = 1.11). 
 
These quantitative findings suggest that the early modern history of the ‘Anthropocene’ idea can 
be treated as the history of an informal scientific concept. The large (though not exclusive) presence of the 
natural sciences as a field of knowledge, and consequently the prevalence of scientific disciplines as main 
vectors in absorbing and spreading the term, corroborate this argument. The fact that seven of ten 

 
391 
 
disciplines with highest En(D) are natural sciences further proves the scientific origins and evolution of the 
term. An interesting finding concerns the substantially low engagement that humanities had during the first 
decade – a trend perhaps almost completely reversed during the 2010–2019 decade. This low engagement 
may explain why the term was mostly left unproblematized, with only a handful of publications addressing 
the ‘Anthropocene’ in terms of ‘narrative’ or ‘discourse.’ Another finding concerns the role of water 
sciences – namely, oceanography (76 records), hydrology (35), and limnology (31). The combined value for 
this macro-discipline amounts to 142, hinting at the pivotal position that the water science community had 
in absorbing and popularizing the term. This fact is also confirmed by analyzing the literature from a 
qualitative viewpoint. An additional important finding concerns geological literature, standing with the 
highest value in terms of records per discipline as well as normalized engagement factor. This is considered 
as a preliminary historical and intellectual factor in the evolution of the ‘Anthropocene’ into a stratigraphic 
hypothesis through the formation of a geological Working Group on the Anthropocene. In other words, it 
made it possible for the ‘Anthropocene’ concept to be an object worth considering in stratigraphic terms. 
 
The qualitative analysis explored the records through discourse analysis, focusing on records, 
authors, organizations, conferences, and other epistemic contexts from a chronological viewpoint. This 
analysis was based on selected records considered to be of notable historical and conceptual value. These 
records were selected primarily based on their respective relative frequency of the term ‘Anthropocene.’ 
However, records were also considered based on other salient factors, such as the context where the term 
appeared (e.g., journal, discipline, workshop, publication year, etc.), or how the term appeared (e.g., position 
in text, definition given, etc.). This literature was considered emblematic of some ways the term was 
perceived, conceived, and implemented across disciplines and epistemic actors. In particular, it was shown 
that the term was implemented for the most part as an informal scientific designation to delimit a time 
threshold related to certain aspects of human impacts. This type of use is recurrent in the peripheral 
literature, where the term mostly appeared ‘passively’ in the introduction or conclusions of research material 
as a background notion. In the central literature, the term saw more ‘active’ engagement from authors who 
used it as an epistemic category. This use of the ‘Anthropocene’ manifested in different ways, from designating 
a time boundary ranging from 1750 years to 1950 (anticipating discussions over the beginning of the 
‘Anthropocene’), to identifying and framing a new transitional phase of the Earth pushing towards new 
methods, models, and objects of analysis.  
 
A further interesting finding is the early vertical and horizontal reach of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept. Propelled by Crutzen’s highly esteemed academic figure, the ‘Anthropocene’ navigated as a 
neologism, concept, idea, and epistemic category across prestigious organizations, conferences, and 
workshops – such as the Dahlem Workshop, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences meetings, events and 
projects around the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, and more. Simultaneously, the term 
appeared in preeminent journals such as Science and Nature as well as in scientific graduate university 
textbooks, and it began to be mentioned and used by established figures across various disciplines, from 
sustainability and environmental studies to soil science, oceanography, Earth System science, and more. 

CONCLUSIONS 
392 
 
 
This vertical reach of the term was paralleled by its remarkably extended horizontal reach across 
fields of knowledge. While the term had an undeniable scientific imprint, it also aroused multidisciplinary 
interest for its captivating connotation – being able to condense and express in a simple and elegant 
semantic unit the array of anthropogenic impacts and forcings upon the Earth. Indeed, during the 2000–
2009 decade, the term began quickly to be absorbed into pre-existing discourses on sustainability, global 
change, and the Great Acceleration, transforming into a normative category in addition to retaining its 
descriptive connotation. The remarkable horizontal extension of the ‘Anthropocene’ is also visible 
linguistically (e.g., appearing in Chinese literature as early as 2001) and societally (i.e., appearing in non-
academic sources such as newspaper articles, nonfiction books, and websites, and across a different range 
of academic sources besides journal articles). These findings suggest that the use of the term was not 
restricted to a geographic region or confined to a disciplinary cohort of scholars and researchers. On the 
contrary, the term had substantial international reach as well as visibility among the public (although not as 
much as in the following decade). The vertical and horizontal success of the term, especially in the 
geoscientific community, can be treated as a historical and intellectual precondition for the geologists of 
the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London to take interest in the term on 
stratigraphic grounds. 
 
After reconstructing the early history of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the birth of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis, Chapter 3 dissected the empirical substrate of the hypothesis. This was accomplished by 
surveying, examining, and meticulously discussing the evidence (of a primarily stratigraphic drive) that the 
AWG has gathered so far in support of formal recognition of an Anthropocene geochronological and 
chronostratigraphic unit. In framing the Anthropocene Hypothesis, a useful preliminary distinction 
between a geological claim and a stratigraphic claim was advanced. This distinction was intended to parse out the 
primary epistemic goal of the hypothesis – namely, to assess whether Homo sapiens has left a discernible 
stratigraphic footprint that may be used to define the beginning of a new geological time unit, and not 
whether Homo sapiens has become a geological force. Then, it was suggested that Homo sapiens be understood 
as a geological agent rather than force because of an ontological asymmetry between geological forces and the 
actions of humans. These preliminary remarks were considered beneficial epistemic clarifications of the 
meaning, scope, and purpose of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 
 
Subsequently, the chapter explored the empirical context and evidence for the hypothesis. From a 
contextual viewpoint, the International Stratigraphic Guide and the Code of the North American Commission 
on Stratigraphic Nomenclature (NACSN) were used to delineate the epistemological standards of 
stratigraphic classification. These guidelines for stratigraphic procedures worldwide are used to frame the 
epistemological requirements that the Anthropocene Hypothesis must accommodate. As such, they also 
delimit the scientific debate on the hypothesis, distinguishing it from the broader debate arena on the 
‘Anthropocene.’ In terms of evidence, a wide spectrum was discussed – in particular lithostratigraphic, 
magnetostratigraphic, pedostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, chemostratigraphic, and chronostratigraphic 
evidence. This pool of stratigraphic evidence engenders the proposed Anthropocene stratigraphic unit. 

 
393 
 
Surveying the context and evidence of the hypothesis shows a fundamental adherence to the norms of 
stratigraphic classification, further corroborating the epistemic identity of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as 
an entity distinct from the ‘Anthropocene.’ However, by emphasizing anthropogenic signals and markers 
of an extremely recent geological nature, it was shown that the empirical evidence poses some challenges 
to traditional understandings of ‘geological records’ in stratigraphic praxis. This is the case, for instance, 
with human-mediated mineral-like compounds used as lithostratigraphic evidence, when these compounds 
are not recognized by the International Mineralogical Association Commission on New Minerals and 
Mineral Names as ‘minerals.’ Similarly, chemostratigraphic units (and thus chemostratigraphic markers, 
such as the radionuclide signal associated with nuclear and thermonuclear bomb testing) are not recognized 
as independent units by the Guide nor by the Code.  
 
The analysis of the empirical body of the hypothesis was followed by a reconnaissance of the 
alternative and competing hypotheses gravitating around the ‘Anthropocene’ as a scientific category. These 
hypotheses differ from the Anthropocene Hypothesis in locating a different starting date to the 
‘Anthropocene’ – either as a geochronological and chronostratigraphic unit or as a broader scientific term 
designating the earliest global impact of humans. In doing so, they challenge the proposed ~1950 CE 
boundary by implementing different scientific research methods (also beyond stratigraphy), by emphasizing 
the stratigraphic value of early anthropogenic signals, or by questioning the scientific value of a 
geochronological and chronostratigraphic characterization of the ‘Anthropocene.’ These hypotheses were 
divided into Paleoanthropocene hypotheses, Early Anthropocene hypotheses, Modern Anthropocene 
hypotheses, and Contemporary Anthropocene hypotheses.  
 
Locating a beginning of a proposed unit is a necessary requirement for the formulation of new 
geochronological and chronostratigraphic units through a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point 
(GSSP). However, the discourse on the beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ has ignited broader discussion of 
a historical and ethical nature. This discourse has raised questions about the meaning and implications of 
selecting a specific event or historical period (e.g., the Neolithic Revolution, the Colombian Exchange, the 
Industrial Revolution) in terms of historical responsibility and broader societal significance. As such, the 
beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ represents one of the densest hubs of conversation in Anthropocene 
Studies. Chapter 3 built on preexisting research by providing a detailed analysis of the main alternative and 
competing hypotheses in engendering the ‘Anthropocene’ as a scientific term. Beyond the practical value 
of visualizing the landscape of proposed starting dates, this roadmap can easily foster further comparative 
as well as individual studies in respect to this pool of existing hypotheses. 
 
Treating the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific hypothesis has certain implications 
concerning the analysis of its epistemology (sensu stricto). Chapter 4 discussed these implications in terms of 
the epistemic virtues the hypothesis holds that are familiar to philosophical analyses of scientific ideas. This 
analysis borrowed concepts and methods from the philosophy of science, attempting to develop a 
contribution amidst a field of knowledge that has had very little interaction with the ‘Anthropocene’ and 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis. 

CONCLUSIONS 
394 
 
 
First, the chapter explored how philosophy has perceived and assimilated the notion of the 
‘Anthropocene.’ It was recognized that ethics and aesthetics were the branches of philosophy that have 
displayed the most interest in the term. In ethics, and particularly environmental ethics, the term signifies a 
range of human-induced pressures on the planet that raise questions of an ethical drive. Related literature 
on the matter was surveyed, showing how the ‘Anthropocene’ as an ethical category converged with 
questions concerning the task of philosophy, and demonstrating which ethical models best provide 
solutions to the ethical dilemmas and challenges raised by the dawn of this new phase of the Earth. It was 
argued that ethics represented the philosophical field of analysis that most successfully translated the 
‘Anthropocene’ into an object of interest, but also of criticism. This argument was not solely supported 
historically by surveying the earliest instance of philosophical interest in the ‘Anthropocene,’ but also by 
assessing how philosophy’s role was perceived in the context of the ‘Anthropocene.’ This perception was 
largely that philosophy is a discipline tasked with normative-ethical concerns. 
 
In aesthetics, the ‘Anthropocene’ encompasses a range of artistic expressions – from art 
installations to museum exhibitions and documentaries – sharing the fundamental goal of representing this 
anthropogenic epoch from a visual standpoint. As such, the term was assimilated and connected to 
discourses of visual culture and the philosophy of art, igniting interest as well as criticism among theorists 
within this knowledge domain. This research landscape engendered the ‘Anthropocene’ as an aesthetic 
category at the intersection of art, politics, visual culture, society, and the environment. 
 
A central finding was the almost utter absence of the voice of philosophy of science in debates 
surrounding either the ‘Anthropocene’ or the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Because the latter represents a 
scientific hypothesis, it falls necessarily within the range of interest of philosophers of science. Consequently, 
one would expect such scholars to show a certain degree of participation in these debates – not least because 
of the widespread media attention and international recognition the term ‘Anthropocene’ has received. 
Nevertheless, a surprising research vacuum was identified in philosophical literature on science concerning 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis. Reasons for this vacuum were provided. In particular, it was advanced that 
an underlying research trend in philosophy seeing physics as the exemplar of science has had consequences 
for the assimilation of geology into philosophical research. In turn, this resulted in the lack of an institutional 
philosophy of geology, and therefore the absence of prompt philosophical responses to the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis. Besides these considerations, three noteworthy contributions from philosophers of science 
concerning the Anthropocene Hypothesis were discussed, highlighting the main theses and arguments. 
Two of these contributions raise criticism against the hypothesis – a type criticism of particular value in 
framing the perception of the hypothesis in philosophical discourses on science. 
 
After surveying the research landscape of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis 
in philosophical scholarship, Chapter 4 went on to develop an epistemology of the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis as a historical type of scientific hypothesis. This analysis showed that, indeed, the hypothesis 
exhibits a certain set of epistemic virtues traditionally ascribed to scientific knowledge – in particular, 
explanatory power and intelligibility (as in, providing scientific understanding of certain phenomena). These 

 
395 
 
epistemic virtues, generally assumed as desiderata for scientific knowledge, were considered through 
influential models of scientific explanation and scientific understanding in philosophy of science 
scholarship. While historically oriented scholarship has often raised the issue of the intrinsic lack of 
explanatory power the hypothesis entails, the chapter advanced that a complementary view of the network 
of research gravitating around the hypothesis renders this criticism null. In particular, the chapter argued 
that the explanatory power and intelligibility of the stratigraphic variant of the ‘Anthropocene’ is assessed 
in relation to the epistemic goals and expectations of the stratigraphic community, as well as its protocols 
and procedures. This emerged by analyzing the aim and methods in relation to the tension between 
stratigraphy-oriented aims and multidisciplinary methods of the research gravitating around the AWG. 
These findings further corroborate and elucidate the nature of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific 
hypothesis. This has two implications. First, the hypothesis demonstrates certain epistemological aspects 
common to scientific knowledge, regardless of its ultimate fate – that is, whether an Anthropocene unit is 
formalized or not. Second, the hypothesis does not represent ideological or politically motivated science 
(Finney & Edwards, 2016). While politics and ideologies play a permeating role in virtually all aspects of 
human society, the fact that the hypothesis can be arguably ascribed certain virtues characteristic of 
scientific knowledge make it a scientific statement rather than a politically motivated one. 
 
Lastly, Chapter 5 attempted a schematic outline of the major lines of critique against both the 
‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis advanced by recent Anthropocene Studies scholarship. 
The chapter showed that the separation between the ‘Anthropocene’ and Anthropocene Hypothesis can 
be beneficial in clarifying and organizing the arguments that have been advanced against either theoretical 
entity in the broader ‘Anthropocene’ research agenda. It was argued that criticism should be separated in 
respect to the two theoretical entities in question. Based on this premise, it was maintained that the main 
critiques against the ‘Anthropocene’ as a broader conceptual entity (i.e., the Undifferentiated Anthropos 
Argument, the Anthropocentrism Argument, the Historical Argument, and the Ethical Argument) do not equally hold 
against the Anthropocene Hypothesis. This is because they do not unfold within the epistemological ground 
of stratigraphic classification, but rather address aspects outside the mandate of the AWG, and thus of the 
theoretical reach of the Anthropocene Hypothesis. No judgement has been expressed toward this criticism, 
which was surveyed in order to extrapolate its core arguments and assess its limits. 
 
Criticism against the Anthropocene Hypothesis was mapped based on four major arguments – 
namely, the Future Geologist Argument (formulated differently both by advocates and detractors of the 
hypothesis), the Diachronicity Argument, the Unorthodoxy Argument (embodied by three sub-arguments: the 
Naming Argument, the Unorthodox Evidence Argument, and the Ideological Science Argument), and the Utility 
Argument. These critiques stemmed from the geological and broader scientific community, highlighting one 
or more particular epistemic aspects that the Anthropocene Hypothesis seemingly lacks. While this criticism 
was generally surveyed in a descriptive fashion, one particular line of critique – namely, the Ideological 
Science Argument – needed further normative considerations. This criticism denies the Anthropocene 
Hypothesis the status of scientific hypothesis by considering it a product of ideological and activist agendas 

CONCLUSIONS

dressed up as science. The relationship between science, politics, and society has historically been complex, 
often giving rise to cultural and intellectual tensions between socially oriented disciplines in the humanities 
and social sciences on the one hand, and the natural sciences on the other. Chapter 5 advanced that 
legitimate scientific claims inform the Anthropocene Hypothesis regardless of both one’s personal 
ideological beliefs and one’s personal view about the formalization of an Anthropocene time unit. These 
claims can be verified or falsified (in a broad sense) based on scientific methodologies, in particular by 
assessing the adherence of the hypothesis to the norms and practices of stratigraphic classification, and by 
weighting the epistemic significance of the evidence submitted. This is ultimately a task to be undertaken 
by the relevant epistemic community – that is, stratigraphy in particular, and geology in general. 
Additionally, Chapter 4 showed that the Anthropocene Hypothesis manifests epistemic virtues that enable 
a treatment of the hypothesis as a scientific hypothesis. Thus, the empirical and theoretical outline of the 
hypothesis corroborates its scientific – rather than ideological or political – nature. 
 
The research overall showed that separating between the ‘Anthropocene’ as a boundary object and 
the Anthropocene Hypothesis as the stratigraphic variant of the ‘Anthropocene’ is not only theoretically 
possible, but also useful, and thus encouraged for ‘Anthropocene’ researchers. At its core, this distinction 
overcomes the issue of definition afflicting a multidisciplinary framework for Anthropocene Studies. If the 
‘Anthropocene’ phenomenon calls for multi- and interdisciplinary attention of a descriptive and normative 
nature, then it is crucial that, first and foremost, disciplines are able to communicate using a common 
conceptual framework. This does not imply that there should be one vocabulary that all disciplines should 
adopt. This would contradict the very intent of multi- and interdisciplinary engagement in the 
‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis. However, without a minimally shared conceptual 
background, communication and cooperation amongst knowledge domains becomes difficult, if not 
incompatible and conflicting (Toivanen et al., 2017). This might lead the ‘Anthropocene’ to become an 
object of solipsistic interpretation, an undefined macro-category encompassing an undistinguished amalgam 
of phenomena and, ultimately, a floating signifier. Considering that the ‘Anthropocene’ concept has been 
at the forefront of key environmental narratives attempting to raise social and political awareness, it is 
paramount that its semantics, purpose, and scientific substrate are clarified. This research attempted to do 
so by focusing on the Anthropocene Hypothesis – perhaps the most relevant and debated variants of the 
‘Anthropocene’ in Anthropocene Studies. 
 
In achieving the target of separating between the ‘Anthropocene’ and Anthropocene Hypothesis, 
the research delineated an ‘epistemological profile’ of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific, and 
specifically stratigraphic, hypothesis. The absence of substantial scholarship from the philosophy of science 
(and the philosophy of geology) on the ‘Anthropocene’ and its stratigraphic variant was a major 
methodological obstacle toward this goal. However, this academic vacuum also provided fertile ground for 
experimenting with an interdisciplinary philosophical analysis of this scientific hypothesis. This analysis 
considered the conceptual history, empirical body, epistemic virtues, and key ingredients of the debate in 
considering the epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis as a scientific formulation. As such, the 

 
397 
 
research is posited as a contribution not solely to the history and philosophy of science, but also to 
interdisciplinary research in general. 
 
 Furthermore, this analysis paves the way for further complementary research trajectories, 
particularly in the sociology of science, but also in scientometrics (e.g., through an in-depth analysis of the 
means of spread of the ‘Anthropocene’ and the Anthropocene Hypothesis) and in the history of knowledge 
(e.g., relating the ‘Anthropocene’ idea to the broader intellectual, social, and political climate of the 21st 
century). Some of the aspects tackled along the way also give rise to further research questions – for 
instance, on the prehistory of the ‘Anthropocene’ in Soviet scientific literature; on the seminal role of NASA 
in developing Earth System science; on the nature and extent of human geological agency; on the 
underrepresentation of geology in 20th-century philosophy of science; on the history of the ‘Anthropocene’ 
concept term between 2010 and 2019; or on the future of the ‘Anthropocene’ if the hypothesis does not 
find approval by the broader geostratigraphic community. These aspects entail important underlying factors 
in framing the birth and epistemology of the Anthropocene Hypothesis, and have the potential to jump-
start further research venues in the study of the ‘Anthropocene’ concept, and its stratigraphic variant, within 
and beyond Anthropocene Studies. The present analysis encourages contributions in these directions with 
the aim of achieving an all-around understanding of the hypothesis and the epistemic mechanisms 
informing it. 
 
Whether or not the Anthropocene will see formal ratification as a geological time unit, the 
Anthropocene Hypothesis has undeniably placed geology, stratigraphy, and the geological time scale under 
the spotlight over the past years. This privileged position has allowed some ancient themes buried deep 
within ‘Western’ culture to reemerge under a different, stratigraphic guise. In particular, one may argue that 
at the heart of the hypothesis lies a deeper philosophical question, one situated at the very heart of religious, 
philosophical, and cultural thought: What is our place on the Earth?  
 
The Book of Genesis (3:19) famously states that we are dust, and to dust we shall return. It does 
not fall to science to answer questions of a metaphysical or existential drive. Nevertheless, science is part 
of the collective enterprise we name ‘human knowledge’; it has unavoidable effects on the way humans 
attribute meaning to reality, and on the answers to the questions they formulate. The Anthropocene 
Hypothesis argues that the stratigraphic footprint of Homo sapiens may be an indelible sign of the human 
enterprise in the history of the Earth, bearing witness to the geological agency of a single species with 
impacts on future civilizations, future species, and the future of the planet itself – before its inevitable end. 
As such, the hypothesis provides an answer – limited and circumscribed to a specific epistemic domain – 
to the ontological question of the place that humans are now invested with. 
 
Perhaps Homo sapiens – this “clever animal” who “invented knowledge” in “some remote corner of 
the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems” (Nietzsche, 1977, p. 42) – may be no 
more significant than dust when compared to the rise and fall of mountains, to the movement of oceans 
and continents, or to the inscrutable abyss of geological time.  
 
Still, as a Japanese proverb states, even dust if piled can become a mountain.

FORSCHUNGSTHEMA 
 
Die folgende Untersuchung ist eine historische und philosophische Studie über die Entstehung und die 
Epistemologie einer wissenschaftlichen Hypothese - der Anthropozän-Hypothese. 
 
Die Anthropozän-Hypothese ist eine vor kurzem formulierte wissenschaftliche Hypothese, die von 
der Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) aufgestellt wurde, einer stratigrafisch orientierten 
Forschungsgruppe mit multidisziplinär-arbeitenden Mitgliedern, die im Sommer 2009 von der 
Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) gegründet wurde. Die Gruppe wurde zusammengestellt, 
um zu beurteilen, ob ausreichend stratigrafische Beweise vorliegen, die eine formelle Ratifizierung einer 
Anthropozän-Zeiteinheit in der geologischen Zeitskala und der internationalen chronostratigrafischen 
Tabelle rechtfertigen.  Eine solche Einheit würde durch den stratigrafischen Fußabdruck des Homo sapiens 
in den geologischen Aufzeichnungen definiert und charakterisiert werden. Die von der Gruppe vertretene 
Hypothese lautet, dass tatsächlich genügend stratigrafische Marker anthropogenen Ursprungs vorhanden 
sind, um die formale Anerkennung einer Anthropozän-Epoche/-Serie zu gewährleisten. Dies würde auch 
das Ende der Holozän-Epoche (und damit des Meghalayum-Zeitalters) bedeuten - der derzeitigen und 
offiziell anerkannten geologischen Epoche. Der vorgeschlagene Beginn dieser postholozänen Epoche 
würde etwa in den 1950er Jahren liegen. Dieser Zeitrahmen deckt sich mit einer Reihe von stratigrafischen 
Markern, 
insbesondere 
geochemischen 
Markern, 
die 
mit 
nuklearen 
und 
thermonuklearen 
Atombombentests in Verbindung gebracht werden und in Kernproben aus Umweltarchiven auf der ganzen 
Welt nachweisbar sind. Die Hypothese hat in der Wissenschaft und in der Öffentlichkeit eine Vielzahl von 
Debatten über die Bedeutung, die Gültigkeit, den Nutzen und die umfassenderen sozialen und ethischen 
Auswirkungen der Formalisierung des Anthropozäns als anthropogen verursachte geologische Zeiteinheit 
ausgelöst. 
 
Die Anthropozän-Hypothese ist die stratigrafische Formulierung oder „Variante“ des 
umfassenderen ,Anthropozän‘-Konzepts. Der Begriff ,Anthropozän‘ hat eine lange Vorgeschichte (und 
Paläogeschichte), aber in seiner heutigen Verwendung wurde er erstmals Ende Februar 2000 von dem 
Chemiker und Nobelpreisträger Paul Crutzen während einer Sitzung des wissenschaftlichen Ausschusses 
des Internationalen Geosphären-Biosphären-Programms in Cuernavaca, Mexiko, geprägt. Der Begriff

setzte sich allmählich in der akademischen Welt durch, bis er ab 2009 eine Welle des Interesses auslöste, 
die sich in einer Vielzahl von Veröffentlichungen, Initiativen, Konferenzen, Universitätskursen, 
Ausstellungen, künstlerischen Ausdrucksformen und vielem mehr niederschlug, die sich auf das 
,Anthropozän‘ bezogen. Zahlreiche Wissenschaftler, vor allem in den Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaften, 
haben sich mit dem Begriff auseinandergesetzt, indem sie seine Bedeutung, seine Annahmen und seine 
Rhetorik analysierten und dekonstruierten. Einige haben den Begriff unter verschiedenen terminologischen 
Varianten neu formuliert, z. B. als ‚Kapitalozän‘, ‚Novozän‘, ‚Pyrozän‘ oder ‚Technozän‘ - um nur einige zu 
nennen. Ein fruchtbarer Aspekt dieses wachsenden Interesses ist, dass die aus dieser multidisziplinären 
Interaktion hervorgegangene Forschung ein breites Spektrum an Gesichtspunkten für die Untersuchung 
des ,Anthropozän‘ als polysemantisches Objekt bietet. Allerdings ist es dadurch auch problematisch 
geworden, das ,Anthropozän‘ in einer multifunktionalen Weise zu definieren. Dies ist ein besonders 
relevantes Problem, wenn man es in den breiteren Diskurs über eine kulturelle Kluft zwischen den Geistes- 
und Sozialwissenschaften auf der einen und den Naturwissenschaften auf der anderen Seite einordnet - eine 
Kluft, die dem ähnelt, was der Physiker und Schriftsteller Charles Percy Snow in den späten 1950er Jahren 
mit den Worten „zwei Kulturen“ beschrieben hat. In der Tat haben ,Anthropozän‘-Wissenschaftler bereits 
Formen des Rückzugs, der Isolation oder des Antagonismus beobachtet, die diese intellektuelle und 
kulturelle Segregation zu wiederholen scheinen. 
 
FORSCHUNGSFRAGEN 
 
In dieser Untersuchung wird eine Lösung für dieses Problem vorgeschlagen. Die Lösung besteht in der 
Unterscheidung zwischen dem ,Anthropozän‘ als Grenzobjekt und der Anthropozän-Hypothese: Ersteres 
entspricht einem Grenzobjekt von multidisziplinärer Bedeutung und Verwendung, während letzteres die 
besondere stratigrafische (oder geologische) Formulierung des ,Anthropozän‘ darstellt. In der jüngeren 
Forschung (Thomas et al., 2020; Zalasiewicz et al., 2018; Zalasiewicz et al., 2019b; Zalasiewicz et al., 2021) 
wurde eine ähnliche Unterscheidung getroffen, um den Zweck und die Bedeutung des „geologischen 
Anthropozäns“ oder des „stratigrafischen Anthropozäns“ als eine diskrete und abgegrenzte 
Forschungsagenda zu klären. Es wird jedoch eingeräumt, dass diese Unterscheidung und die ihr 
innewohnende semantische Spannung noch nicht gründlich untersucht worden sind - insbesondere vom 
Standpunkt der philosophischen Analyse wissenschaftlichen Wissens aus betrachtet. 
 
Diese Unterscheidung bildet den Rahmen für den zentralen Analysegegenstand der vorliegenden 
Untersuchung, nämlich die Anthropozän-Hypothese. Diese Unterscheidung so zu begründen und zu 
artikulieren, dass sie sowohl im akademischen als auch im öffentlichen Diskurs nützlich und 
nachvollziehbar ist, ist eines der Hauptziele der vorliegenden Arbeit. Die Studie implementiert diese 
Unterscheidung als Prämisse und erläutert gleichzeitig die eepistemischen Vorteile und den praktischen 
Nutzen einer solchen Haltung.

Der Versuch, eine theoretische Trennung zwischen ,Anthropozän‘ und der Anthropozän-
Hypothese zu legitimieren und abzugrenzen, ist das erste Ziel dieser Untersuchung. Das zweite Ziel ist die 
Beantwortung zweier miteinander verbundener Fragen, die sich aus dem ersten Ziel ergeben, nämlich: Was 
ist die Anthropozän-Hypothese? Was bedeutet es, dass die Anthropozän-Hypothese eine wissenschaftliche 
Hypothese darstellt? 
 
Die erste Frage ergibt sich ganz natürlich aus der getroffenen Unterscheidung. Wenn die 
Hypothese als eine eigenständige theoretische Einheit behandelt werden soll, die mit dem ,Anthropozän‘ 
zusammenhängt, sich aber konzeptionell von ihm unterscheidet, dann müssen die epistemischen 
Eigenschaften, die die Anthropozän-Hypothese als eigenständige Einheit definieren, identifiziert werden. 
Diese Eigenschaften sollten notwendige und hinreichende Gründe dafür liefern, die Anthropozän-
Hypothese als ein eigenständiges theoretisches Objekt zu behandeln, das sich vom ,Anthropozän‘ 
unterscheidet und nicht nur eine Interpretation des Letzteren darstellt. 
 
Die zweite Frage bezieht sich auf die Natur der Anthropozän-Hypothese. Es wird argumentiert, 
dass die Hypothese eine wissenschaftliche Hypothese darstellt, insbesondere eine stratigrafische Hypothese. 
Als wissenschaftliche Hypothese weist sie epistemische Tugenden auf (z. B. Verständlichkeit, Nützlichkeit, 
Erklärungskraft), die traditionell von Wissenschaftsphilosophen diskutiert, definiert und der 
wissenschaftlichen Praxis und dem wissenschaftlichen Denken zugeschrieben werden. Als stratigrafische 
Hypothese spiegelt sie die Produktion wissenschaftlicher Ideen in dem spezifischen epistemischen Kontext 
wider, in dem die Hypothese steht - also in der stratigrafischen Forschung. Dies sind einige der 
epistemischen Merkmale, die die Anthropozän-Hypothese vom ,Anthropozän‘-Konzept unterscheiden 
und die die Hypothese zu einem Gegenstand des Interesses der Wissenschaftsphilosophie machen - 
insbesondere der Philosophie der Geologie. Dies ist ein wichtiger Punkt, da die Wissenschaftsphilosophie 
sowohl in der Debatte um das ‚Anthropozän‘ als auch um die Anthropozän-Hypothese im Grunde nur eine 
Nebenrolle spielt. In gewisser Weise ermutigt diese Forschung die Wissenschaftsphilosophie zu weiterer 
Auseinandersetzung mit der Epistemologie der stratigrafischen Klassifizierung und der Anthropozän-
Hypothese als wissenschaftlicher Idee. 
 
FORSCHUNGSMETHODIK 
 
Die Untersuchung der Entstehung und der Epistemologie der Anthropozän-Hypothese gilt als geeignete 
Strategie, um zufriedenstellende Antworten auf beide Fragen zu geben. Aber was genau bedeutet es, die 
„Geburt“ und „Epistemologie“ der Anthropozän-Hypothese zu untersuchen? Wie können diese Aspekte 
dazu beitragen, die oben gestellten Fragen zu beantworten? 
 
Um die Entstehung der Hypothese zu rekonstruieren, müssen die Umstände ermittelt werden, die 
eine Gruppe von Geologen dazu veranlassten, das ,Anthropozän’ 
‚ auf stratigrafischer Grundlage zu definieren. Dies erfordert eine Untersuchung des historischen, 
intellektuellen, disziplinären und sozialen Kontextes, in dem die Hypothese entstanden ist. Wie erwartet, 

DEUTSCHE ZUSAMMENFASSUNG 
402 
 
stellt die Anthropozän-Hypothese eine besondere Interpretation des Konzepts ,Anthropozän‘ dar. Um die 
Ursprünge der Anthropozän-Hypothese zu verstehen, muss man wissen, wie sich das Konzept 
,Anthropozän‘ in den ersten Jahren seines Bestehens in der akademischen und insbesondere in der 
wissenschaftlichen Landschaft entwickelt hat. Außerdem muss man den breiteren Kontext verstehen, den 
das ,Anthropozän‘ im letzten Jahrzehnt hervorgebracht hat, nämlich den neuen Wissensbereich der 
Anthropozän-Studien. Dass die Anthropozän-Hypothese eine eigenständige theoretische Einheit darstellt, 
bedeutet nicht, dass sie völlig losgelöst von den breiteren Diskursen ist, die sich um das ,Anthropozän‘ 
ranken. Im Gegenteil, man kann sagen, dass die Hypothese im Epizentrum eines solchen Diskurses und 
einer solchen Debatte angesiedelt ist. Daher ist es wichtig, den Kontext, der die Anthropozän-Hypothese 
umgibt und ihr vorausgeht, zu erfassen, um das Wesen und die Bedeutung der Hypothese als 
wissenschaftliche und stratigrafische Hypothese zu verstehen. 
 
Die Epistemologie der Anthropozän-Hypothese zu untersuchen, bedeutet, die zentralen 
Wissensaussagen zu beschreiben, die die Identität der Hypothese untermauern, und zu bestimmen, welche 
epistemischen Tugenden die Hypothese charakterisieren (wenn überhaupt). Diese Wissensaussagen können 
aus dem Forschungsmaterial extrapoliert werden, das den methodischen, theoretischen und empirischen 
Rahmen der Hypothese absteckt, und dann in philosophischen Begriffen neu formuliert werden. Sie werden 
in verschiedenen Formen ausgedrückt, von normativ-methodisch (z. B. was geologische Beweise für die 
Hypothese darstellen; welche Normen der stratigrafischen Klassifizierung die Hypothese befolgt oder in 
Frage stellt usw.) bis hin zu deskriptiv-beobachtend (z. B. empirische Beweise). Die Analyse dieser Aussagen 
gewährt einen tieferen Einblick in ihre logischen und semantischen Implikationen und bietet neben der 
begrifflichen und semantischen Klärung auch kritische Gesichtspunkte von methodologischem und 
theoretischem Nutzen. Die Beurteilung, ob eine bestimmte Reihe von epistemischen Tugenden identifiziert 
werden kann, gewährleistet die theoretische Legitimität (sensu lato) der Hypothese als wissenschaftliche 
Hypothese. Dies ist besonders wichtig, weil die Wissenschaftlichkeit der Hypothese sowohl von außen als 
auch innerhalb der stratigrafischen und geologischen Gemeinschaft in Frage gestellt wurde. Die 
Untersuchung versucht zu zeigen, dass die Hypothese tatsächlich einige epistemische Tugenden aufweist, 
die es erlauben, sie (von einem philosophischen Standpunkt aus) als wissenschaftliche Hypothese zu 
charakterisieren. 
 
Die philosophische Analyse in Form einer begrifflichen und sprachlichen Analyse ist das primäre 
Mittel, um die in dieser Untersuchung gesetzten Ziele zu erreichen. Wie der Philosoph Wesley Salmon 
(1982) jedoch einmal feststellte, „läuft die Philosophie, die nicht in Kontakt mit anderen Disziplinen steht, 
Gefahr, ziemlich steril zu werden“ (1982, S. 282). Das bedeutet, dass die Philosophie allein nicht in der 
Lage ist, das Spektrum der Faktoren, die die Anthropozän-Hypothese als wissenschaftliche Hypothese 
charakterisieren, gründlich zu untersuchen, ohne Gefahr zu laufen, in abstrakte, von der „praktischen“ 
Struktur wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnis losgelöste Wissenschaftsvorstellungen zu verfallen. Die Hypothese 
ist Teil eines sozialen, historischen und wissenschaftlichen Kontextes, der sowohl ihre Formulierung als 
auch ihren wissenschaftlichen Status mitbestimmt und beeinflusst. Ein interdisziplinärer Ansatz bestimmt 

 
403 
 
daher die Arbeitsweise der vorliegenden Untersuchung. Diese Methode umfasst die quantitative und 
qualitative Linguistik, Methoden der stratigraphischen und geologischen Klassifizierung, die 
Begriffsgeschichte und die Wissenschaftsgeschichte. Jede dieser Disziplinen stellt Methoden zur 
Verfügung, die als angemessene Mittel zur Untersuchung der Entstehung und der Epistemologie der 
betreffenden Hypothese angesehen werden. Die verwendeten Methoden und die mit ihnen angegangenen 
Probleme werden in den jeweiligen Kapiteln und Abschnitten erörtert. 
 
Der Grundton dieser Untersuchung ist in erster Linie deskriptiv. Sie versucht, die Ursprünge und 
das Wesen der Anthropozän-Hypothese als wissenschaftliche Hypothese auf der Grundlage sorgfältig 
geprüfter Daten zu untersuchen. Es wird nicht darüber geurteilt, ob die vorgeschlagene Epoche formalisiert 
werden sollte oder nicht, oder ob die formale Ratifizierung einer Anthropozän-Einheit für die Wissenschaft 
und die Gesellschaft im Allgemeinen von Vorteil wäre. Da jedoch völlige Objektivität methodisch 
unerreichbar ist, werden in begrenzten Teilen der Forschung Behauptungen aufgestellt, deren Absicht über 
eine Beschreibung hinausgeht. Dies gilt insbesondere für den Vorwurf der ideologischen 
Wissenschaftlichkeit der Anthropozän-Hypothese, aber auch für die Zuschreibung bestimmter 
epistemischer Tugenden an die Hypothese, den Umfang und das Ziel der Hypothese, ihre Neuartigkeit in 
der geologischen Forschung und ihre allgemeine Legitimität als wissenschaftliche Hypothese. Im Folgenden 
werden einige Argumente angeführt, die für die Anerkennung der Anthropozän-Hypothese als legitime und 
in ihrer Art noch nie dagewesene wissenschaftliche Hypothese sprechen. Außerdem werden die 
Auswirkungen dieses Standpunkts erörtert. 
 
FORSCHUNGSSTRUKTUR 
 
Die Untersuchung gliedert sich in fünf Kapitel, gefolgt von der Schlussfolgerung und einem Anhang. Jedes 
Kapitel wirft Fragen auf, deren Antworten für die Erreichung der zentralen Ziele dieser Untersuchung 
unerlässlich sind. 
 
Kapitel 1 bildet den breiteren multidisziplinären Rahmen der Anthropozän-Hypothese. Es werden 
die folgenden Fragen aufgeworfen: Was ist das ,Anthropozän‘? Wodurch unterscheidet es sich von der 
Anthropozän-Hypothese? Welchen Sinn hat es, zwischen dem ‚Anthropozän‘ und der Anthropozän-
Hypothese zu unterscheiden? Um diese Fragen zu beantworten, werden in diesem Kapitel das kürzlich 
eingerichtete Feld der Anthropozän-Studien und die wichtigsten Forschungsrichtungen, die ihm zugrunde 
liegen, untersucht. Die Anthropozän-Studien stellen ein multi- und interdisziplinäres Wissensgebiet dar, das 
in der Untersuchung des ,Anthropozän‘ als globales Phänomen anthropogener Natur zusammenläuft. Nach 
der Erkundung der primären Forschungsrichtungen, die diesem im Entstehen begriffenen Forschungsfeld 
zugrunde liegen, wird eine theoretische und praktische Unterscheidung zwischen dem ,Anthropozän‘ als 
Grenzobjekt und der Anthropozän-Hypothese als stratigrafische Variante vorgenommen. Diese Trennung 
untermauert den Rest der Forschung, indem sie den Untersuchungsrahmen auf die Anthropozän-

DEUTSCHE ZUSAMMENFASSUNG 
404 
 
Hypothese eingrenzt, aber auch eine Analyse der semantischen Spannungen zwischen diesen beiden 
theoretischen Einheiten ermöglicht.  
 
Kapitel 2 rekonstruiert die Entstehung der Anthropozän-Hypothese durch ergänzende quantitative 
und qualitative Analysen. Dabei werden die folgenden Fragen aufgeworfen: Was geschah in der frühen 
Geschichte des ,Anthropozän‘-Konzepts? Wie wurde der Begriff verwendet, und von wem? Wie hat das 
,Anthropozän‘ zur Entstehung der Anthropozän-Hypothese beigetragen? Um diese Fragen zu 
beantworten, wird in diesem Kapitel die frühe Geschichte des ,Anthropozän‘ untersucht, indem ein Korpus 
von Literatur gesichtet wird, in der der Begriff in den ersten zehn Jahren seines Bestehens (d. h. 2000-2009) 
verwendet wurde. Aus quantitativer Sicht werden in der Untersuchung Textmining-Techniken eingesetzt, 
um herausragende Eigenschaften eines Korpus von 670 schriftlichen Aufzeichnungen zu ermitteln. Diese 
Analyse bietet einen quantitativen Überblick über die frühe Geschichte des Konzepts ,Anthropozän‘ in der 
wissenschaftlichen Literatur. Aus qualitativer Sicht wird ein ausgewählter Pool von Texten mittels 
Diskursanalyse untersucht. Diese Texte gelten als emblematisch für die Art und Weise, wie der Begriff 
,Anthropozän‘ wahrgenommen, assimiliert und verwendet wurde. Darüber hinaus stützt sich die qualitative 
Analyse auf die persönliche Kommunikation mit Autoren, die bei der Übernahme und Popularisierung des 
Begriffs eine Rolle gespielt haben. Die Rekonstruktion der frühen Geschichte des ,Anthropozän‘ wird als 
notwendige Voraussetzung für die Rekonstruktion der Entstehung der Anthropozän-Hypothese 
angesehen. 
 
In Kapitel 3 wird der empirische Korpus, der die Anthropozän-Hypothese zu einer 
stratigraphischen Hypothese macht, untersucht und diskutiert, und es werden alternative und 
konkurrierende Hypothesen geprüft. Es werden die folgenden Fragen aufgeworfen: Was ist der empirische 
Korpus der Anthropozän-Hypothese? Welche alternativen stratigraphischen und allgemeineren 
wissenschaftlichen Vorschläge gibt es für ein wissenschaftlich sinnvolles ,Anthropozän‘? Zur Beantwortung 
der ersten Frage werden die neuesten wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse aus der Forschung im Umfeld der 
AWG untersucht. Parallel dazu werden die grundlegenden Definitionen, Prinzipien und Verfahren der 
stratigraphischen Klassifizierung untersucht, die die Erkenntnistheorie der Anthropozän-Hypothese 
bestimmen. Anschließend wird das Panorama der bestehenden wissenschaftlichen Hypothesen über das 
,Anthropozän‘ und seinen Beginn erörtert. Die Lokalisierung des Beginns der vorgeschlagenen Einheit ist 
einer der meist diskutierten Aspekte der Anthropozän-Hypothese. Daher wird die Erörterung des 
Spektrums alternativer Vorschläge als ein notwendiger Bestandteil der Epistemologie des von der AWG 
vorgelegten Vorschlags angesehen. 
 
In Kapitel 4 wird ein erkenntnistheoretischer Abriss der Anthropozän-Hypothese skizziert. Dabei 
werden die folgenden Fragen aufgeworfen: Welche erkenntnistheoretischen Implikationen hat es, die 
Anthropozän-Hypothese als wissenschaftliche Hypothese zu betrachten? Welche epistemischen Tugenden 
(wenn überhaupt) weist die Anthropozän-Hypothese auf, die traditionell von Wissenschaftsphilosophen 
definiert werden? Was hat die bestehende philosophische Wissenschaft über das ,Anthropozän‘ und die 
Anthropozän-Hypothese zu sagen? Zur Beantwortung dieser Fragen muss zunächst die Rezeption des 

 
405 
 
,Anthropozän‘ in der bestehenden philosophischen Forschung untersucht werden, um festzustellen, in 
welchen philosophischen Bereichen das ,Anthropozän‘ als philosophische Kategorie aufgenommen wurde. 
Besonderes Augenmerk gilt dabei dem offensichtlichen Desinteresse der Wissenschaftsphilosophie am 
,Anthropozän‘ oder der Anthropozän-Hypothese. Nachdem Gründe für diesen Umstand genannt werden, 
werden einige Beiträge aus der Wissenschaftsphilosophie diskutiert. Anschließend werden einflussreiche 
Modelle der Wissenschaftsphilosophie herangezogen, um festzustellen, ob die Anthropozän-Hypothese 
erkenntnistheoretische Merkmale aufweist, von denen gemeinhin gesagt wird, dass sie Wissenschaft und 
wissenschaftliches Wissen definieren. Diese Modelle konzentrieren sich in erster Linie auf die 
Epistemologie historischer Hypothesen sowie auf das Wesen wissenschaftlicher Erklärung und 
wissenschaftlichen Verstehens. 
 
Kapitel 5 schließlich befasst sich mit den kritischen Debatten über das Konzept ,Anthropozän‘ 
und die Anthropozän-Hypothese, die in den letzten zehn Jahren entstanden sind. Dabei werden die 
folgenden Fragen aufgeworfen: Welche Argumente wurden gegen das ,Anthropozän‘ und seine 
stratigraphische Interpretation vorgebracht? Was ist der Unterschied zwischen den Argumenten gegen das 
,Anthropozän‘ und denen gegen die Anthropozän-Hypothese? Welche Aspekte der Hypothese sind 
besonders umstritten? Diese Fragen werden beantwortet, indem unabhängige Kritiklinien zu einzelnen und 
leicht identifizierbaren Argumenten zusammengeführt und vereinheitlicht werden. Das Kapitel untersucht, 
wie sich jedes dieser identifizierten Argumente auf das ,Anthropozän‘ oder die Anthropozän-Hypothese 
bezieht, und bietet so einen Fahrplan, um sich in den vielfältigen Kritiklinien der Anthropozän-Studien 
zurechtzufinden. Dies ist ein nützliches Unterfangen, nicht nur um die konzeptionelle Trennung zu 
verstärken, die in dieser Untersuchung vorgenommen wurde, sondern auch um zu fragen, ob die 
Argumente gegen das ,Anthropozän‘ auch für die Anthropozän-Hypothese gelten. Insbesondere werden 
die Argumente gegen die Anthropozän-Hypothese im Hinblick auf ihre Rolle bei der Verhandlung der 
Beweise und im Lichte der breiteren Epistemologie der Hypothese untersucht und diskutiert. 
 
FORSCHUNGSWERT 
 
Die Forschung soll vor allem zu drei Bereichen der akademischen Wissenschaft beitragen. Erstens ist sie 
ein Beitrag zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte und -philosophie, wofür sie einen doppelten Zweck erfüllt. Zum 
einen handelt es sich um eine Fallstudie über die Entstehung und die Erkenntnistheorie einer 
wissenschaftlichen Hypothese, insbesondere einer stratigrafischen Hypothese. Daraus lassen sich mehrere 
Anwendungen ableiten - zum Beispiel durch Vergleiche mit der Entstehung ähnlicher wissenschaftlicher 
Hypothesen oder durch Einordnung in größere wissenschaftstheoretische Diskurse. Andererseits werden 
Wissenschaftler der Wissenschaftsgeschichte und -philosophie ermutigt, sich an der Debatte über die 
Anthropozän-Hypothese zu beteiligen. Auf diese Weise wird auch das Interesse an der Philosophie der 
Geologie gefördert, einer Disziplin, die in der bestehenden Wissenschaftsphilosophie weitgehend 
unterrepräsentiert ist. In der Tat wird dieser Wissensbereich als entscheidend für die Entwicklung 

DEUTSCHE ZUSAMMENFASSUNG 
406 
 
philosophischer Analysen der Anthropozän-Hypothese angesehen, da er sich auf die Epistemologie der 
Geologie konzentriert. Dennoch bleibt dieser Bereich ein weitgehend unerforschtes Gebiet. 
 
Zweitens stellt es einen Beitrag zu den Anthropozän-Studien dar, einem im Entstehen begriffenen 
Forschungsgebiet, das sich um das ,Anthropozän‘ als zentrales Konzept für die gegenwärtigen 
anthropogenen Auswirkungen auf den Planeten rankt. Der Begriff hat sich sowohl in der Wissenschaft als 
auch in der Öffentlichkeit als erfolgreiche Kategorie etabliert, was darauf schließen lässt, dass der Begriff 
unabhängig vom endgültigen Ergebnis der Anthropozän-Hypothese auf Dauer Bestand haben könnte. 
Wenn dies der Fall ist, dann kann eine Analyse, die die begriffliche Beziehung zwischen dem ,Anthropozän‘ 
und der Anthropozän-Hypothese klärt, nur von Nutzen sein, um Instrumente zur weiteren Erforschung 
der semantischen Gebiete bereitzustellen, die dieser Begriff zu bieten hat.  
 
Der dritte Beitrag betrifft die interdisziplinäre Forschung. Die hier angewandten interdisziplinären 
Untersuchungsmethoden machen das gesamte Vorhaben zu einem Beispiel für interdisziplinäre Arbeit - 
und hoffentlich zu einem erfolgreichen. Obwohl die interdisziplinäre Forschung „weithin als Treibhaus für 
Innovationen und als einzig plausibler Ansatz für komplexe Probleme wie den Klimawandel gilt“ 
(Bromham et al., 2016, S. 684), steht sie immer noch vor großen Schwierigkeiten, die vor allem mit den 
Finanzierungsmöglichkeiten zusammenhängen. Die Trennung der Disziplinen an den Universitäten und 
die Probleme bei der Entwicklung funktionaler Modelle der Interdisziplinarität (Heikkurinen et al., 2016; 
Inkpen & DesRoches, 2019; Toivanen et al., 2017) sind ebenfalls große Hindernisse für die Durchführung 
interdisziplinärer Projekte. Inmitten dieser praktischen und theoretischen Schwierigkeiten ist das beste 
Mittel vielleicht Versuch und Irrtum. Daher wird in dieser Studie versucht, interdisziplinäre 
Analysemethoden zusammenzuführen. Dies geschieht nicht mit dem Ziel, einen interdisziplinären Rahmen 
zu entwickeln, sondern als Experiment, das Methoden und Theorien der Disziplinen zusammenführt, die 
an der Spitze der Forschung zum ,Anthropozän‘ und zur Anthropozän-Hypothese stehen. 
 
Abschließend ist anzumerken, dass die Geschichte der Anthropozän-Hypothese noch im 
Entstehen begriffen ist. Die AWG ist noch dabei, Erkenntnisse und Ergebnisse zur Unterstützung der 
Hypothese vorzulegen, und ein formeller Vorschlag an die Internationale Kommission für Stratigraphie 
steht noch aus. Die Forschung über die Anthropozän-Hypothese und das ,Anthropozän‘ im Allgemeinen 
wird derzeit noch durchgeführt. Dies macht diese Gesamtanstrengung notwendigerweise etwas 
unvollständig, was das endgültige Schicksal des Vorschlags einer formellen stratigraphischen Anerkennung 
einer Anthropozän-Epoche (oder anderer Einheitsebenen) angeht. Dennoch ist aus der Anthropozän-
Hypothese eine Fülle empirischer und theoretischer Forschungen hervorgegangen, die eine diskrete 
Analyse der Hypothese nicht nur möglich, sondern auch nützlich - wenn nicht sogar notwendig - machen. 
Die vorliegende Arbeit baut auf diesem breiten Spektrum an Forschungsliteratur auf.

The following table provides data concerning each of the 670 records composing the corpus analyzed and 
discussed in Chapter 2. The columns include the following information: author(s), year, title, journal, 
volume, issue, pages, publisher, place published, field(s) of knowledge, discipline(s), relative frequency (Fn), 
designation as central literature (CL) or peripheral literature (PL), language (LNG), and format. 
 
The records are listed in chronological order, from 2000 to 2009 (day and/or month of publication 
are not considered). Because the vast majority of records are labelled as journal articles, this format, and 
consequently ‘volume,’ ‘issue,’ and ‘pages,’ are given separate columns. Records that do not have this 
information because they constitute different formats (e.g., book, book section, conference paper) are 
marked with a double slash in the appropriate cell. This also applies for any other information that is not 
pertinent to a given record (e.g., place published, publisher, journal).  
 
The Fn column lists the relative frequency value of each of the records. Notably, each record is also 
labelled as central or peripheral literature in the adjacent column to the right. While this information is 
redundant, in that it is already suggested by the record’s specific Fn value, it ensures that the division of the 
corpus into central and peripheral literature is error-free.  
 
Lastly, languages are abbreviated according to the ISO 639-1 nomenclature, whereas discipline, 
field of knowledge, and format are labelled according to the categories defined in Chapter 2.
