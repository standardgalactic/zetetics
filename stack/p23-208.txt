Introduction
This report provides information about the 
characteristics of households and people 
who have and have not adopted use of 
computers and the Internet.  The Ô¨Åndings 
in this report are based on data collected in 
a supplement to the October 2003 Current 
Population Survey that included questions 
about computer and Internet use at home, 
school, and work.
1  The U.S. Census Bureau 
has asked questions in the Current Popula¬≠
tion Survey to assess computer use since 
1984 and Internet use since 1997.
The Ô¨Årst part of this report examines com¬≠
puter and Internet use in households.  The 
second and third parts of the report deal 
with computer and Internet use among 
children and adults, respectively.
COMPUTERS AND INTERNET 
ACCESS IN HOUSEHOLDS
Prevalence of Personal Computers 
and Internet Access
The majority of households have personal 
computers and Internet access.  In 2003, 
70 million American households, or 62 per¬≠
cent, had one or more computers, up from 
56 percent in 2001 (Figure 1).
2  In 1984, 
the proportion of households with a com¬≠
puter was 8 percent.
1 The data in this report are from the Computer and 
Internet Use Supplement to the October 2003 Current 
Population Survey.  The population represented (the popu¬≠
lation universe) is the civilian noninstitutionalized popula¬≠
tion living in the United States.
2 The estimates in this report (which may be shown in 
text, Ô¨Ågures, and tables) are based on responses from a 
sample of the population and may diÔ¨Äer from actual val¬≠
ues because of sampling variability or other factors.  As 
a result, apparent diÔ¨Äerences between the estimates for 
two or more groups may not be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. 
All comparative statements have undergone statistical 
testing and are signiÔ¨Åcant at the 90-percent conÔ¨Ådence 
level unless otherwise noted.

U.S. Census Bureau
Children‚Äôs access to a computer at 
home and at school has increased 
in recent years.  In 1993, 32 percent 
of children had access to a com-
puter at home and 61 percent used 
a computer at school.  In 2003, 
about three-quarters (76 percent) 
of all children 3 to 17 years lived in 
a household with a computer, and 
83 percent of the 57 million en-
rolled children used a computer at 
school, giving this generation more 
exposure to technology than their 
predecessors.  
Despite these increases, rates of  
access to and use of computers  
continued to vary among groups 
(Table C).  In 2003, the percentage 
of children living in homes with a 
computer ranged from 70 percent 
for young children (aged 3 to 5) 
to 79 percent for older teenagers 
(aged 15 to 17).  Among children 
who lived in a home with a com-
puter, older children were more 
likely than younger children to use 
the computer‚Äîusage was nearly 
universal among older children, 95 
percent, compared with 67 percent 
of younger children.
Rates of children‚Äôs home computer 
access and use varied by race and 
Hispanic origin.  Non-Hispanic White 
or Asian children (each about  
85 percent) were more likely to 
have a computer at home than Black 
or Hispanic children (each about  
54 percent). Among those who lived 
in households with a computer, the 
diÔ¨Äerences in usage rates within 
those households were 88 percent 
for non-Hispanic Whites and about 
82 percent each for Blacks, Asians, 
and Hispanics. 
Educational attainment of the 
householder continued to show a 
relationship to the presence of a 
computer in the household.  While 
47 percent of children living with 
a householder who had less than a 
high school education had a com-
puter, 94 percent of the children in 
households where the householder 
had a bachelor‚Äôs degree or more 
education had a computer available 
to them at home.  The diÔ¨Äerence in 
computer use rates between these 
at home and at school.  Among 
groups with access to a computer

Figure 5 illustrates a similar eÔ¨Äect 
among children by race and Hispan¬≠
ic origin.  The highest and lowest 
rates for computer use at home dif¬≠
fered by 33 percentage points, with 
80 percent of non-Hispanic White 
children using a computer at home, 
compared with about 48 percent 
each of Black children and Hispanic 
children.  At school, the diÔ¨Äerences 
diminished, with 89 percent of non-
Hispanic White children and about 
85 percent of Black and Hispanic 
children using computers there.

The 15-percentage-point diÔ¨Äerence 
between public and private school¬≠
children in home computer-use 
rates disappeared when the children 
were at school.  The percentage of 
students who used a computer at 
public school was marginally higher 
than that of children who used a 
computer at private school (87 
percent compared with 85 percent), 
reversing a historical trend.

Eighty-three percent of children 
aged 3 to 17 with a computer at 
home used it to play games, the 
most common single use, followed 
by school assignments (66 percent) 
and connecting to the Internet 
(64 percent, Figure 6).  Children 
used a broader range of computer 
applications as they aged.  Playing 
games was the most frequent activ¬≠
ity among the youngest children 
(85 percent).  For the oldest chil¬≠
dren, school assignments and 
accessing the Internet were more 
common activities (91 percent and 
86 percent, respectively).
Children who accessed the Inter¬≠
net, whether at home, school, or 
elsewhere, most often used online 
connectivity to complete school 
assignments (75 percent).  The next 
most common Internet use among 
children was playing games 
(65 percent), followed by e-mail or 
instant messaging (60 percent).

COMPUTER AND INTERNET 
USE AMONG ADULTS
Overall, use of computers by adults 
(people 18 years and older) was 
less prevalent than use by children. 
Sixty-four percent of adults used a 
computer at some location (home, 
school, or work) in 2003, compared 
with 86 percent of children (Tables 
C and D).  Due to the large propor¬≠
tion of very young children who

tivites on the Internet, see the 2003 Detailed 
Table 9A at <www.census.gov/population
/www/socdemo/computer.html>.
used a computer and did not use 
the Internet, a larger proportion of 
adults than children used the Inter¬≠
net at some location (60 percent 
compared with 56 percent).
Over the past two decades, the pro¬≠
portion of adults (people 18 years 
and over) using a computer any¬≠
where has grown, from 18 percent 
in 1984, to 36 percent in 1993, to 
Figure 6.

64 percent in 2003.  From 1997 
(the Ô¨Årst year in which the CPS col¬≠
lected information on Internet use) 
to 2003, use of the Internet among 
adults jumped from 22 percent to 
60 percent. 
Among adults, two-thirds 
(66 percent) had a computer at 
home, and among those, 83 percent 
used the computer.  Fifty-nine per¬≠
cent of adults had Internet access 
at home, and 82 percent of them 
used it.  More than half of working 
adults used a computer at work 
(56 percent), and 42 percent used 
the Internet on the job.  Among 
adult students, 85 percent said they 
used a computer at school, and 
66 percent used the Internet there.   
As was the case for children, adults‚Äô 
use of these technologies varied 
with their socioeconomic and demo¬≠
graphic characteristics.  Adults with 
an advanced degree, for example, 
had the highest rates of computer 
use anywhere.  Asian or non-His¬≠
panic White adults (about 69 per¬≠
cent each) were more likely to use a 
computer than Blacks or Hispanics 
(51 percent and 41 percent, 
respectively).
People 65 and older had lower 
rates of computer use (28 percent) 
and Internet use (25 percent) than 
was the case for other age groups. 
Adults 18 to 24 years of age were 
most likely to use a computer or the 
Internet someplace (75 percent and 
71 percent, respectively).
Computer Use by Sex
In 2003, more women than men 
used a computer at home by a small 
margin, reversing the computer 
use ‚Äúgender gap‚Äù exhibited during 
the 1980s and 1990s.
12  In 1984, 
men‚Äôs home computer use was 20 
percentage points higher than that 
of women (Figure 7).  This gap 
decreased to 3 percentage points in 
12 For more information on computer use 
by sex in the 1980s and 1990s, see Computer 
Use in the United States: 1984, Computer Use 
in the United States: 1989, and Computer Use 
in the United States: 1997, at <www.census
.gov/population/www/socdemo/computer
.html>.
1997 and reversed in 2001, favor¬≠
ing women by 2 percentage points.  
Similarly, women‚Äôs Internet use at 
home exceeded men‚Äôs in 2003.
At work, women have had higher 
rates of computer use than men 
since the CPS Ô¨Årst collected data 
on computer use in 1984, when 
29 percent of working women used 
a computer on the job, compared 
with 21 percent of working men.  
In 2003, 63 percent of women and 
51 percent of men used a computer 
at work.  Forty-seven percent of 
women and 39 percent of men used 
the Internet on the job in 2003 
(Table E).
Some of the historically higher rates 
of women‚Äôs computer use at work 
may derive in part from the type 
of jobs they have held.  In 2003, 
the technology use-intensive oÔ¨Éce 
and administrative support occupa¬≠
tions accounted for 23 percent of 
all working women and 6 percent 
of working men.  While oÔ¨Éce and 
administrative support occupations 
accounted for 7 percent of men 
using computers on the job, this cat¬≠
egory accounted for 29 percent of 
all women using computers at work.  
The percentages of women and men 
who use computers at work also 
diÔ¨Äer by occupation group.  Among 
men, the group with the highest 
percentage of workers using a com¬≠
puter was professional occupations.  
For women, the most computer us¬≠
ers were in the management, busi¬≠
ness, and Ô¨Ånancial occupations.
Internet Use for 
Communication and Commerce
Over the last few years, computer 
and Internet technologies have 
merged into a communications 
device for both home and work 
life.  By 2003, more adult computer 
users accessed the Internet than 
performed any other computing 
task: 89 percent of  home users and 
75 percent of those at work (Table 
F).  Nearly 9 in 10 adult Internet us¬≠
ers (88 percent) used the Internet to 
send or receive e-mail, and nearly 
8 in 10 (78 percent) used the Inter¬≠
net to get information on products 
or services.

The proportions of the population 
performing tasks online, and the 
activities they choose, demonstrate 
some of the ways the technology is 
aÔ¨Äecting society:
‚Ä¢ The Internet has become a major 
venue for the dissemination of 
news.  In 6 years, the proportion 
of adults who used the Internet 
to Ô¨Ånd information on ‚Äúnews, 
weather, or sports‚Äù increased  
from 7 percent in 1997 to 40 per-
cent in 2003 (Figure 8), and the 
proportion using the Internet to 
Ô¨Ånd information on government 
or health services increased from 
12 percent to 33 percent.
13 
‚Ä¢ The Internet is also changing in-
terpersonal communication.  More 
than half (55 percent) of all adults 
used e-mail or instant messaging 
in 2003, compared with  
12 percent of adults in 1997.
‚Ä¢ The Internet has become an  
integral part of the economy.  
Eighteen percent of adults con-
ducted banking online in 2003.  
Twelve percent of adults used the 
Internet to search for a job.  Near-
ly half of adults (47 percent) used 
the Internet to Ô¨Ånd information 
on products or services.  About 
one-third of adults (32 percent) 
actually purchased a product or 
service online, compared with  
2.1 percent of adults who used 
the Internet for ‚Äúshopping‚Äù  
in 1997.
SOURCE OF THE DATA
The population represented (the 
population universe) in the Com-
puter and Internet Use Supplement 
to the October 2003 Current Popula-
tion Survey is the civilian noninsti-
tutionalized population living in the 
United States.  The institutionalized 
population, which is excluded from 
the population universe, is com-
13 Data from 1997 derive from the answer 
‚ÄúSearch for information such as government, 
business, health, education‚Äù to the question 
‚ÄúWhat do you use the Internet for at home?‚Äù  
In 2001 and 2003, household members were 
asked about speciÔ¨Åc uses of the Internet any-
where, not  at home.

posed primarily of the population in 
correctional institutions and nursing 
homes (91 percent of the 
4.1 million institutionalized people 
in Census 2000).
Most estimates in this report come 
from data obtained in October 2003 
from the Current Population Survey 
(CPS).  Some estimates are based 
on data obtained from the CPS in 
earlier years, including October 
1984, October 1989, October 1993, 
October 1997, December 1998, 
August 2000, and September 2001.  
The U.S. Census Bureau conducts 
this survey every month.
ACCURACY OF THE 
ESTIMATES
Statistics from surveys are subject 
to sampling error and nonsampling 
error.  All comparisons presented 
in this report have taken sampling 
error into account and are signiÔ¨Å¬≠
cant at the 90-percent conÔ¨Ådence 
level.  This means the 90-percent 
conÔ¨Ådence level for the diÔ¨Äerence 
between estimates being compared 
does not include zero.  Nonsam¬≠
pling error in surveys may be attrib¬≠
uted to a variety of sources, such as 
how the survey was designed, how 
respondents interpret questions, 
how able and willing respondents 
are to provide correct answers, and 
how accurately answers are coded 
and classiÔ¨Åed.  To minimize these 
errors, the Census Bureau employs 
quality control procedures in sample 
selection, the wording of questions, 
interviewing, coding, data process¬≠
ing, and data analysis.
The Current Population Survey 
weighting procedure uses ratio es¬≠
timation whereby sample estimates 
are added to independent estimates 
of the national population by age, 
race, sex, and Hispanic origin. This 
weighting partially corrects for bias 
due to undercoverage, but biases 
may still be present when people 
who are missed by the survey 
diÔ¨Äer from those interviewed in 
ways other than age, race, sex, and 
Hispanic origin.  How this weighting 
procedure aÔ¨Äects other variables in 
the survey is not precisely known.  
All of these considerations aÔ¨Äect 
comparisons across diÔ¨Äerent sur¬≠
veys or data sources.

source of the data and accuracy of 
the estimates, including standard 
errors and conÔ¨Ådence intervals,

graphic Statistical Methods Division
