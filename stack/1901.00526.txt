Abstract
Classical mechanics is presented here in a unary operator form, constructed using the binary multiplication and Pois-
son bracket operations that are given in a phase space formalism, then a Gibbs equilibrium state over this unary
operator algebra is introduced, which allows the construction of a Hilbert space as a representation space of a Heisen-
berg algebra, giving a noncommutative operator algebraic variant of the Koopman–von Neumann approach. In this
form, the measurement theory for unary classical mechanics can be the same as and inform that for quantum mechan-
ics, expanding classical mechanics to include noncommutative operators so that it is close to quantum mechanics,
instead of attempting to squeeze quantum mechanics into a classical mechanics mold. The measurement problem
as it appears in unary classical mechanics suggests a classical signal analysis approach that can also be successfully
applied to the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. The development oﬀers elementary mathematics that
allows a formal reconciliation of “collapse” and “no–collapse” interpretations of quantum mechanics.

1. Introduction
An algebraic approach to Koopman’s Hilbert space formalism for classical mechanics gives us mathematical tools
that are powerful enough that we can obey Bohr’s stricture that we must describe an experimental apparatus classically
very closely indeed. The noncommutativity of the transformation algebra that is introduced by the Poisson bracket is
so natural for a classical physicist who fully exploits the Hilbert space tools available that not only can we classically
describe the experimental apparatus, we can also describe the analysis of the experimental raw data as eﬀectively as
we can in quantum mechanics.
Many discussions now appear in the physics literature that probe the relationship between classical and quantum
physics, within which Koopman’s 1931 introduction of a Hilbert space formalism for classical mechanics increasingly
appears. The approach here contrasts with traditional Koopman–type approaches by being more algebra–centric,
inspired by the algebraic approach to quantum mechanics[1] and to quantum ﬁeld theory[2], so that Koopman’s
Hilbert space formalism for classical mechanics becomes more a classical signal analysis formalism (which introduces
noncommutativity very naturally just in its free use of fourier and other integral transforms over time, which is not
permitted for classical mechanics). Experimental raw data is taken here to be a ﬁnite, lossily compressed record of an
arbitrarily detailed collection of possible measurements of noisy signal voltage measurements that could have been
recorded: even though we only actually perform a ﬁnite number of measurements, the set of measurements we could

have performed in the past and the set of measurements we might perform in the future are both arbitrarily large.
At the level of actual signals, signal level responses to the surrounding environment do not occur as instantaneous
“collapses”: they instead transition over very short but ﬁnite times that as much depend on the material and electronic
circuitry of the apparatus as on the surroundings. The positioning of the ﬁnite number of measurements we actually
perform into a continuously indexed set of possible measurements will give us a theory that discusses a ﬁeld of
measurements, represented by an algebra of operators, together with a relatively unstructured “state”, which gives us
information about what the results would be: it is helpful to think of the mathematics of quantum ﬁeld theory as a
continuously indexed ﬁeld of measurements, not as a ﬁeld that is measured.
The construction given here takes inspiration from many places: from quantum non–demolition measurement[3],
from the Koopman–von Neumann[4, 5, 6, 7] and similar approaches[8, 9, 10, 11] to classical mechanics, and from
generalized probability theory[12], and there is also a control systems literature that considers mixed classical and
quantum models[13, 14, 15]. Another inspiration —which is, however, rather ﬂawed because it is not statistical— is
the long use of the Wigner function and other time–frequency distributions in signal analysis[16]. This practical use of
the Heisenberg algebra[17], generated in the time–frequency case by [∂/∂t, t] = 1, with a complex structure provided
by fourier analysis, and the consequent approach to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, has become well–known
in popular science, and it may be a useful resource for some audiences, because there are several videos that present
a similar idea on much–followed YouTube channels[18, 19, 20, 21]. More closely, Wigner function approaches to
quantum mechanics are well–known and much developed[22][23, Ch. 15], putting classical and quantum mechanics
both into phase space formalisms, whereas Koopman–type approaches put classical and quantum mechanics both into
Hilbert space formalisms: the two approaches have diﬀerent merits, but Koopman–type approaches have thus far been
much less developed.
There is also much inspiration from “Geometric Quantization”[24], but there is an essential contrast with that ap-
proach: quantization valiantly attempts to construct a map from the commutative algebra generated by classical phase
space position and momentum observables q, p, to the noncommutative Heisenberg algebra generated by quantum
observables ˆq, ˆp, but, to say it bluntly, fails. Classical mechanics in a phase space formalism takes the observables
of the theory to be functions on phase space, which does not include unary algebraic operators that can naturally be
constructed using the Poisson bracket. In phase space classical mechanics the action of the Poisson bracket as a binary
operation is closed on the commutative algebra of functions on phase space —given two functions u and v on phase
space, {u, v} is also a function on phase space— but it is classically natural in a Koopman–type approach to use the
unary operators that can be constructed using the Poisson bracket not only as generators of transformations. A less
constrained unary classical mechanics formalism leads to a larger, noncommutative algebra of observables, which in
elementary cases amounts to allowing classical physics to use functions u(q, p, ∂/∂q, ∂/∂p) as observables, not just
functions u(q, p). A noncommutative algebra generated by q, ∂/∂q and by p, ∂/∂p is a classical mechanics that we
will call CM+, which, as an instance of the Heisenberg algebra, can be mapped to two copies of quantum ˆq, ˆp. The
paper shares with Wetterich[10] a concern to motivate and to justify the use of noncommutativity as a natural classi-
cal tool, but focuses on the use of the Poisson bracket and applying the methods of algebraic quantum mechanics to
classical mechanics. Given a Gibbs equilibrium state over the classical algebra we can construct a complex Hilbert
space (with a complex structure provided below by the use of characteristic functions), and use that Hilbert space to
model physics.
Cohn, in 1980, presented a comparable “Operator formulation of classical mechanics”[25], from which the present
approach diﬀers in notation, by using only Gibbs equilibrium states, and by taking it to be the measurement theory
that can be considered common between unary classical and quantum mechanics (despite the diﬀerence, discussed in
§8, between thermal and quantum ﬂuctuations.)
We will begin with the simple harmonic oscillator in §2, using the binary multiplication and Poisson bracket
operations to construct unary operators, and introducing a Gibbs equilibrium state, then §2.1 gives a signal analysis
approach to the simple harmonic oscillator by introducing an explicit time parameter. §4 introduces more general
Hamiltonians, but with the Poisson bracket structure still the same as for the simple harmonic oscillator, then §5
discusses a more general phase space, for which both the Hamiltonian and the Poisson bracket are nontrivial. §3 gives
a short discussion of the (Gelfand–Naimark–Segal) GNS–construction of a Hilbert space in a relatively elementary
way, focusing on states over algebras of operators, which usefully frees us from thinking of the Hilbert space as
necessarily pre–eminent, though the familiar Hilbert space formalism will remain the ﬁrst choice for practical use.
§6 shows how to construct states as modulations of the Gibbs equilibrium state and how to construct a noncom-
2

mutative algebra of operators in a way that is classically natural, particularly from a signal analysis perspective, which
can be used to model transformations that are performed either by experimental apparatus or by signal analysis al-
gorithms whenever such sophistication is needed. §7 develops and illustrates the consequences of Koopman–type
mathematics for the measurement problem in §7.1, suggesting a Joint Measurement Principle as a way to remove
the necessity for a “collapse” dynamics; for Bell–type inequalities in §7.2, applying the Joint Measurement Principle
and suggesting in §7.2.1 an investigation of the variation over time of the violation of Bell–type inequalities before
steady state statistics have been established; and §7.3 applies the thinking of the preceding sections in a contrasting,
ﬁgurative way to perhaps the most elementary and whimsical of examples, Schr¨odinger’s cat.
§7.1 discusses the measurement problem in a way that is natural relative to —but largely independent of— the
development of the mathematics of a Koopman–type approach to classical mechanics in §§2–6, to some extent fol-
lowing the idea of Belavkin’s approach[26]. After a measurement represented by an operator ˆA, the “collapse” of the
state can be modeled as two steps: the ﬁrst step, within the linear Hilbert space formalism, can be modeled by a pro-
jective superoperator action (known as a L¨uders transformer) on the density operator that represents a state, ˆρ 7→ˆρA;
the second step can be modeled as a stochastic jump, as in [26]. Excluding the second step greatly simpliﬁes the
relevant mathematics, and, in addition, stochastic jumps are both not part of classical statistical physics at the level of
the Gibbs equilibrium probability density and cannot be modeled as a linear operation. The superoperator action of
the L¨uders transformer on the state is equivalent to replacing the collapse of the state by a superoperator action of the
same L¨uders transformer on a subsequent measurement ˆX, a projection to the commutator subalgebra of ˆA, ˆX 7→ˆXA,
because of the identity, Eq. (39), Tr
h ˆA ˆX ˆρA
i
= Tr
h ˆA ˆXA ˆρ
i
, which is exactly enough to make the subsequent measurement
ˆXA jointly measurable with ˆA. When joint measurements are in fact performed, they must be modeled by mutually
commutative operators to ensure that in all states a joint probability density is generated by the quantum or classical
Hilbert space formalism: “collapse” very eﬀectively ensures, implicitly, that this is the case. As a partial resolution of
the measurement problem, excluding the ﬁnal stochastic jump that has usually not been a great concern for classical
physics, we can think of “collapse” of the state as ensuring a necessary property for joint measurements instead of as
a change of the state. The answer to the question ‘does this approach include “collapse”?’, which is a fundamental
bellwether for interpretations, is ‘this is how we can answer both yes and no,’ with the mathematics concerned making
it possible to reconcile interpretations that diﬀer over this hitherto rather metaphysical choice.
Koopman–type constructions can perhaps best be appreciated as oﬀering an alternative relationship between clas-
sical and quantum mechanics that is a signiﬁcantly more unifying approach than the quantization we are used to, not
as a replacement for the very eﬀective mathematics of quantum physics. With some subtleties, we can add a Koopman
picture to the physical Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures of Hilbert space mathematics. By understanding Koop-
man Classical Mechanics and its relationship with Quantum Mechanics, we can hope, a little, to gain an edge in our
understanding of Quantum Mechanics.
2. The Simple Harmonic Oscillator
We will ﬁrst work with a simple harmonic oscillator, for which an abstract “position” might perhaps be the dis-
placement of a pendulum, but might also be a voltage or any abstract degree of freedom that is subject to a linear
restorative “force”: we will take Hamiltonian mechanics to be an abstract formalism for generating a conservative
evolution equation, not a “particle” theory. The position may be a point in a many–dimensional vector space, but we
will work here as if it is one–dimensional, without indices (which can easily be added, however.) A subsection, §2.1,
introduces a signal analysis approach that brings the simple harmonic oscillator much closer to being a ﬁeld theory.
For the simple harmonic oscillator there are no constraints, so that the elementary observables of the system are
straightforward functions of position and momentum, u(q, p), for which we have, as well as the linear vector space
structure λu(q, p)+µv(q, p) = [λu+µv](q, p), the binary multiplication operation and the trivial binary Poisson bracket
operation,
· : u, v
7→
[u · v](q, p) = u(q, p) · v(q, p),

7→
{u, v}(q, p) = ∂u

3

with both operations being bilinear and with the latter being also a biderivation. This structure is not a straightforward
algebra, for which there is only the linear vector space structure and one other binary operation. We use these binary
operations to construct four linear unary operators that act on functions such as u(q, p),
ˆq : u(q, p) 7→q · u(q, p),
ˆp : u(q, p) 7→p · u(q, p),
ˆQ : u(q, p) 7→{p, u}(q, p) = ∂
∂qu(q, p),
ˆP : u(q, p) 7→{u, q}(q, p) = ∂
∂pu(q, p),
(3)
which can be used to construct a general unary operator as a function of ˆq, ˆp, ˆQ, ˆP, for which a product can be
deﬁned by composition, [ˆq ˆp](w) = ˆq( ˆp(w)), et cetera. For perhaps the most important example, the Hamiltonian
function both becomes a multiplicative unary operator, ˆH = 1
2(ˆq2 + ˆp2), and becomes the Liouvillian unary operator,
ˆL : u(q, p) 7→{H, u}(q, p), ˆL = ˆp ˆQ −ˆq ˆP. Note carefully that this is not quantum theory, because ˆq and ˆp commute and
because the Liouvillian unary operator, which generates evolution over time, is not a positive operator. The algebraic
structure is nonetheless closely comparable to that of quantum theory, because ˆQ and ˆP are both derivations, so that
[ ˆQ, ˆq] = 1 and [ ˆP, ˆp] = 1, which, except for the absence of a complex structure that we will introduce below, gives two
copies of the Heisenberg algebra. Note also that we cannot present the Liouvillian operator, nor any other generators
of transformations, if we do not introduce ˆQ and ˆP, which are essential elements of the unary algebraic structure
because of the Poisson bracket. We cannot omit ˆQ and ˆP in a fully construed presentation of classical mechanics in
a unary operator form: the functions u(q, p) do not exhaust the questions that can be asked of a classical mechanical
system, because, for example, it is reasonable for a classical physicist to ask whether a state is an eigenstate of the
Liouvillian operator.
For a measurement theory, we look for a linear, positive, normalized state over an algebra that is generated by
ˆq, ˆp, ˆQ, and ˆP, for which we also provide the adjoint operation ˆq† = ˆq, ˆp† = ˆp, ˆQ† = −ˆQ, ˆP† = −ˆP, and, for any
two unary operators, ( ˆA ˆB)† = ˆB† ˆA†. We interpret a state as giving the average value associated with any self–adjoint
unary operator in the given state, following an algebraic quantum mechanics framework[1], which is enough to make
some kind of contact with the statistics of a collection of experimental raw data. Other consequences can be derived,
such as the association of the spectrum of an operator with the sample space of a probability density, of projection
operators with a logic and with probabilities, and of average values of powers of a self–adjoint operator with higher
statistical moments, et cetera. If we wish to emphasize the experimental interpretation of a state —that the number it
generates for a given operator is in some practical way connected to an average value of ensembles of experimental
raw data— we can call it a statistical state.
To construct such a state, we ﬁrst note that the Gibbs equilibrium state over the phase space of the simple harmonic
oscillator at ﬁnite temperature T and Boltzmann constant kB results in average values

or ρ(qmpn) = 0 if either m or n is odd. This can be presented in a characteristic function form as a Gaussian
ρ(e jλq+jµp) = e−kBT(λ2+µ2)/2,
(5)
which can be thought of in more elementary terms as a generating function for moments. We can also use an inverse
fourier transform to return to a probability density, which we could write informally as

The imaginary j has been introduced in Eq. (5) as an engineering convenience to allow a characteristic function
to be constructed, but we will also use it as a central generator of a ∗–algebra C that is generated by ˆq, ˆp, ˆQ, ˆP, and
j, with adjoint j† = −j. This introduction —which an engineer can make carelessly for its usefulness in presenting
the sine and cosine components of the fourier transform systematically even if it might give a mathematician or a
4

philosopher pause— also allows us to use j ˆQ and j ˆP as self-adjoint unary operators, for which measurement is relative
to the fourier transform basis of improper eigenfunctions of j ˆQ and j ˆP. Other motivations for introducing a complex
structure are possible, but an elementary argument can be made for considering the use of characteristic functions to
be closely related to the use of complex Hilbert space methods[27].
A nonunique extension of the Gibbs equilibrium state to the algebra C can be constructed by using a raising and
lowering operator algebra, [a, a†] = [b, b†] = 1,

which ensures that [ ˆQ, ˆq] = [ ˆP, ˆp] = 1. If we introduce an appropriately scaled object

ρ( ˆA)∗, that is linear, ρ(λ ˆA + µ ˆB) = λρ( ˆA) + µρ( ˆB), and that is normalized for a unit element ˆ1, ρ(ˆ1) = 1. We obtain,

so that for an arbitrary number of factors, again using the same Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀidentity, we obtain for

The ﬁrst expression preserves the conceptual separation of the thermal noise term and the incompatibility term, as
labeled above, whereas the second expression, which applies a straightforward algebraic simpliﬁcation, is often easier
to use. From this generating function, we can use diﬀerentiation at λi = 0 or inverse fourier transforms to construct
the average value associated with any function of the ˆFfi. From Eq. (12), we can derive, for any operators ˆA and ˆB,
ρ( ˆAe jλ ˆFfe jµ ˆFg ˆB) = e−λµ[(f∗,g)−(g∗,f)]ρ( ˆAe jλ ˆFge jµ ˆFf ˆB),
(14)
so that Eq. (12) ﬁxes the algebraic structure, for the purposes of the state, as eﬀectively that of the Weyl–Heisenberg
group. Again using the same Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀidentity, we can reduce any product of exponential factors
to a single exponential of a sum,
ρ( ˆAe jλ ˆFfe jµ ˆFg ˆB) = e−λµ[(f∗,g)−(g∗,f)]/2ρ( ˆAe j ˆFλf+µg ˆB),
(15)
so we can in general work with terms only of the form e jλ ˆFf. Appendix A shows that Eq. (12) is a state in the abstract
sense given in §3.

2.1. A signal analysis approach to the simple harmonic oscillator
Taking a signal analysis approach, we can consider the simple harmonic oscillator over time by taking f to be
a function of time, f(t) = ( f1(t), f2(t), f3(t), f4(t)), with the algebraic structure still given by Eq. (12), but with the
time–translation invariant pre-inner product given as
(f, g) =
Z
(˜f(k), ˜g(k))2πδ(k2 −1) dk
2π.
(16)
The time–like evolution is restricted to fourier modes for which k = ±1, and under the fourier–mode integral we
have used the pre–inner product deﬁned above as part of the phase space construction, Eq. (10). This gives a 1+0–
dimensional random ﬁeld theory, which is better thought of as a ﬁeld of measurements, indexed by functions such as
f(t), instead of as a ﬁeld that is measured. The function f(t), which tells us where in time our measurement is most
focused, is known as a “window function” in signal analysis. As a simplest example, suppose that f(t) and g(t) have a
Gaussian focus at time t0 with parameter τ, f(t) = f0e−(t−t0)2/2τ2/
√
2πτ2, g(t) = g0e−(t−t0)2/2τ2/
√
2πτ2, so that
(f, g) =
Z
(f0, g0)e−τ2k22πδ(k2 −1) dk
2π = (f0, g0)e−τ2.
(17)
Unsurprisingly, the thermal noise is less apparent if we average over long intervals, with large τ, but we obtain the
same result as for the phase space formalism if we average over short intervals, with small τ. If the oscillator interacts
time–invariantly with an external time–like invariant noise, then we would expect all frequencies to be driven at
diﬀerent amplitudes, so that the time–translation invariant pre-inner product would be
(f, g) =
Z
(˜f(k), ˜g(k)) ˜G(k) dk
2π,
(18)
where ˜G(k) is the “noise kernel”: unless a model for a real–world system includes absolutely every degree of freedom,
we would have to expect that ˜G(k) will not be perfectly focused on a single fourier mode. An analysis that freely uses
mutually noncommutative integral transformations as needed —fourier analysis!— is a commonplace in classical
signal analysis, whereas noncommutative transformations have eﬀectively been banned from classical mechanics for
a hundred years by ﬁat, leaving classical mechanics as a straw man.
Anticipating §8, we can extend this structure to a Poincar´e invariant state over a classical Klein–
Gordon ﬁeld just by changing the pre–inner product to
( f, g) = ℏ
Z
˜f ∗(k) ˜g(k)2πδ(k·k −m2) d4k
(2π)4 ,
(19)
which can be shown to be equivalent to the quantized complex Klein–Gordon ﬁeld[7, Appendix B].
3. The GNS–construction
We have so far obtained only a single state over the algebra of unary operators associated with the simple harmonic
oscillator. The Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction allows us to construct a Hilbert space if we are given a single
state over a ∗–algebra, which is somewhat diﬀerent from a commonplace presentation of quantum theory, in which
a Hilbert space is prior to the states we can construct using vectors in the Hilbert space. With this approach, the
deﬁnition of a state replaces the introduction of the Born rule. We here abridge the elementary account given by
Haag[2, §III.2.2] (see also [28, §14.1.3]).
A state over a ∗–algebra A is a linear, positive, and normalized map, ρ : A →C, satisfying
ρ(λ ˆA + µ ˆB) = λρ( ˆA) + µρ( ˆB),
ρ( ˆA† ˆA) ≥0,
ρ(ˆ1) = 1,
(20)
and also commutes with the adjoint operation, ρ( ˆA†) = ρ( ˆA)∗. Such a linear form deﬁnes a Hermitian scalar product
for a vector space of operators | ˆA⟩, ⟨ˆA| ˆB⟩ρ( ˆA† ˆB)=
h
ρ( ˆB† ˆA)
i∗, which is positive semi–deﬁnite, ⟨ˆA| ˆA⟩≥0, and which
6

can be reﬁned to a Hermitian inner product over equivalence classes, because for unary operators ˆI and ˆJ for which
⟨ˆI|ˆI⟩= ⟨ˆJ| ˆJ⟩= 0, the Schwarz inequality, |⟨ˆA| ˆB⟩|2 ≤⟨ˆA| ˆA⟩⟨ˆB| ˆB⟩, ensures that ⟨ˆA + ˆI| ˆB + ˆJ⟩= ⟨ˆA| ˆB⟩.
We can take the vector corresponding to the unit element, |ˆ1⟩, to be the Gibbs equilibrium vector of the Hilbert
space, ρ( ˆA) = ⟨ˆ1| ˆA|ˆ1⟩, then we can construct new vectors in the Hilbert space as ˆA|ˆ1⟩= | ˆA⟩, using an arbitrary
function of ˆq, ˆp, ˆQ, and ˆP, with completion in the Hilbert space norm that is given by the Hermitian inner product.
The Gibbs equilibrium vector is thus an object that we modulate by multiplication, which makes it appropriate to
consider adopting |ˆ1⟩as an alternative notation for the Gibbs equilibrium vector (in contrast to the usual |0⟩for the
ground or vacuum state, as a zero eigenstate of all lowering operators, which greatly underplays the potency of an
equilibrium or vacuum state). New states, which should be contrasted with new vectors in the Hilbert space, can be
constructed as
ρ ˆA( ˆB) = ρ( ˆA† ˆB ˆA)
ρ( ˆA† ˆA)
= ⟨ˆA| ˆB| ˆA⟩
⟨ˆA| ˆA⟩
= ⟨ˆ1| ˆA† ˆB ˆA|ˆ1⟩
⟨ˆ1| ˆA† ˆA|ˆ1⟩
,
(21)
or as convex sums or integrals of this construction. For this construction, we do not necessarily need to know the
structure of the ∗–algebra A to construct the Hilbert space, if we are given or we can in whatever way show that ρ is a
state, as Appendix A shows for Eq. (12): the state ﬁxes a representation of a class of ∗–algebras. A state is necessary
for there to be a concrete connection between the algebraic structure and statistics of a ﬁnite set of experimental raw
data, so the structure of the particular representation given by a state is arguably all that is accessible.
A full account would be much more elaborate, however the bare bones of the GNS–construction are relatively
elementary, with the construction of new states and new vectors being largely familiar. The need to introduce equiv-
alence classes and to invoke completion in the norm introduce some diﬃculty, but they do not have to detain us at an
elementary level.
4. A modiﬁed Hamiltonian
A modiﬁed Hamiltonian function determines a diﬀerent dynamics than for the simple harmonic oscillator, but in
this section we continue using a Poisson bracket that is globally deﬁned as {u, v}(q, p) = ∂u

which has as generating function the fourier transform
ρH(e jλq+jµp) = ˜P(λ, µ).
(23)
If we extend this state to be also over the diﬀerential operators ∂/∂q and ∂/∂p, then it generates a representation of the
Weyl–Heisenberg group, which therefore must be unitarily equivalent to the representation generated for the simple
harmonic oscillator[28, §11.5.7], if the representation is irreducible. Consequently, for some unitary operator ˆUH,
using the state deﬁned for the simple harmonic oscillator by Eq. (12) (possibly for a diﬀerent value of kBT, depending
on the scale of the Hamiltonian function),
ρH(e jλ1 ˆFf1 · · · e jλn ˆFfn) = ρ( ˆU†
He jλ1 ˆFf1 · · · e jλn ˆFfn ˆUH).
(24)
If the representation is reducible, which in general will be the case if the state represents a system that is in mechanical
or thermodynamic contact with other systems, ρH will be equal to a convex sum or integral of such expressions for
diﬀerent values of kBT and for diﬀerent unitaries ˆUH. For our purposes here, therefore, we will consider in Section 6
only properties of the state and Hilbert space deﬁned by Eq. (12).
We can approach this mathematics more concretely: we can model any ﬁnite set of data by a probability density
PH(˚q, ˚p) that can be written as a convex sum of displaced Gaussian probability densities, at some temperature kBT′,

so that in characteristic function terms the convolution becomes a product,
˜PH(λ, µ) = ˜ΞH(λ, µ)e−kBT′(λ2+µ2)/2 = ˜ΞH(λ, µ)ρ[kBT′](ejλˆq+jµ ˆp),
˜ΞH(0, 0) = 1,
because we can always approximate that ﬁnite set of data in such a way that for a small enough choice of kBT′,
˜ΞH(λ, µ) = ˜PH(λ, µ)e+kBT′(λ2+µ2)/2
has an inverse fourier transform. This is a strong constraint on the fourier transform of PH(˚q, ˚p), but any ﬁnite set of
data is compatible with it. Because ˆQ and ˆP generate translations, we have for any function, eα ˆQF(ˆq)e−α ˆQ = F(ˆq + α)
and eβ ˆPF( ˆp)e−β ˆP = F( ˆp+β), so we can construct a state ρH as a convex sum of displaced simple harmonic oscillators,
ρH(e jλ1 ˆFf1 · · · e jλn ˆFfn) =
Z
ΞH(α, β)ρ[kBT′](eα ˆQ+β ˆPe jλ1 ˆFf1 · · · e jλn ˆFfne−α ˆQ−β ˆP)dαdβ.
(26)
which is a convex sum of elementary examples of Eq. (24). As for state tomography in quantum mechanics, however,
just knowing the probability density PH(˚q, ˚p) does not ﬁx the state ρH uniquely: we can, for example, generate exactly
the same probability density PH(˚q, ˚p) using
ρH(e jλ1 ˆFf1 · · · e jλn ˆFfn) =
Z
ΞH(α, β)ρ[kBT′](eα ˆQ+β ˆP+jF(α,β,ˆq, ˆp)e jλ1 ˆFf1 · · · e jλn ˆFfn e−α ˆQ−β ˆP−jF(α,β,ˆq, ˆp))dαdβ
(27)
(which is a convex sum of slightly less elementary examples of Eq. (24)), where F(α, β, ˆq, ˆp)† = F(α, β, ˆq, ˆp), any
self–adjoint function, commutes with ˆq and ˆp, but transforms the expected measurement results for j ˆQ and j ˆP. It
seems unlikely that a decomposition as a convex sum of displaced simple harmonic oscillators will be the optimal
construction for use in physics, but it is perhaps the simplest example.
5. A modiﬁed Hamiltonian and a modiﬁed Poisson bracket structure
If there are constraints, the elementary observables form a commutative, associative algebra A of functions on a
phase space manifold P, u : P →R, with a binary multiplication operation, together with a nontrivial binary Poisson
bracket operation, · : u, v 7→u · v, {, } : u, v 7→{u, v}, which cannot be written globally as in Eq. (2). We can use the
multiplication and Poisson bracket operations to construct two sets of unary operators,
ˆYu : A →A; v 7→ˆYu(v) = u · v,
(28)
ˆZu : A →A; v 7→ˆZu(v) = {u, v},
(29)
which satisfy the commutation relations
[ ˆYu, ˆYv] = 0, [ ˆZu, ˆYv] = ˆY{u,v}, [ ˆZu, ˆZv] = ˆZ{u,v}.
(30)
ˆZu is called the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld of u[29, §3.2], however this is a slightly unfortunate name insofar as only the
Poisson bracket is used in its construction. The whole algebra C is a semi–direct product of the ˆZu unary operators
acting adjointly on the commutative subalgebra CY that is generated by the ˆYu unary operators, with the latter being
naturally isomorphic to the multiplicative, non–Poisson bracket part of A, u 7→ˆYu, ˆYu( ˆYv(w)) = ˆYu·v(w), and λ ˆYu(w) +
µ ˆYv(w) = ˆYλu+µv(w), with ˆY1 as the unit element, ˆY1(w) = w.
C is not in general isomorphic to a Heisenberg algebra unless the classical dynamics can be written globally as
in Eq. (2), so we cannot proceed as we did in §4, leading to Eq. (24). Instead, we begin by using a nontrivial Gibbs
equilibrium state over A to construct a state over the commutative subalgebra CY, normalized so that ρ( ˆY1) = 1,
ρ : CY −→C; ρ( ˆYu) =
Z
P
u(x)e−H(x)/kBTdx
. Z
P
e−H(x)/kBTdx,
(31)
with an adjoint deﬁned as ˆY†
u = ˆYu, ( ˆA ˆB)† = ˆB† ˆA†, and with an imaginary j† = −j introduced as for the simple
harmonic oscillator as an eﬃcient way to discuss the fourier sine and cosine transforms of probability distributions.
8

This is enough to naturally construct a state over the whole algebra C if we introduce the Gibbs equilibrium projection
operator ˆV, which we can deﬁne abstractly by ρ( ˆA1 ˆV · · · ˆV ˆAn) = Q
i ρ( ˆAi) (in a more elementary approach, we can
deﬁne ˆV = |ˆ1⟩⟨ˆ1|.) A general element of the resulting algebra is ˆA + P
i ˆXi ˆV ˆAi, where ˆA, ˆAi ∈CY and each ˆXi may
include ˆV factors. For this general element

so that by induction a state over CY can be extended naturally to be a state over an algebra C+ of all transformations
that can be constructed as a limit (in a suitable topology) of forms such as P
i,j αi, j| ˆAi⟩⟨ˆAj|, with | ˆAi⟩a countable basis
of the Hilbert space H that is generated by the GNS–construction’s action of CY on |ˆ1⟩. C+ can include, for example,
the algebra of bounded operators acting on H, B(H). The superoperators that can be constructed using C+ includes
a representation of C as a subalgebra because C contains only CY and a subalgebra of adjoint actions on CY. As for
unconstrained classical mechanics, we can allow all of C+ as observables if it is empirically necessary or useful to
do so, and construct both pure and mixed states over the algebra of observables. It can be argued from a Dutch book
perspective that it is necessary to construct all such states to describe some circumstances adequately[30].
Note that we have here weaponized the Gibbs equilibrium projection operator in a very global way, because ˆV
does not commute with any operator in CY, which is anathema to, for example, a local quantum physics perspective[2]
but is a commonplace in practical physics: whenever we use the Born rule to generate a transition probability such as
|⟨ˆB| ˆA⟩|2, we implicitly use a measurement operator | ˆB⟩⟨ˆB| = ˆB ˆV ˆB† in a state with density operator | ˆA⟩⟨ˆA| = ˆA ˆV ˆA†.
Constrained classical mechanics can in any case be modeled in the ﬁrst instance as a limit of unconstrained clas-
sical mechanics, as in §4, for which the Hamiltonian function of systems that are not on the constraint surface (which
is taken to be embedded in an unconstrained phase space) becomes arbitrarily large, so that in the limit the Gibbs
equilibrium distribution assigns zero probability except on the constraint surface. At the level of experimental raw
data, we cannot conﬁrm that a real experimental apparatus always lies absolutely precisely on a singular constrained
surface. We also note that quantum ﬁeld theory has historically only constrained the algebra of observables to be
the commutant of the symmetries of the dynamics, which mathematicians typically also restrict to B(H), which for
classical mechanics we can construct as the double commutant of the Liouvillian, B(H) ⊃C = { ˆL}′′. For our purposes
here, therefore, we will consider below, as for unconstrained classical mechanics, only properties of the state and the
Hilbert space deﬁned by Eq. (12).
6. Measurements and states
We ﬁrst focus on ˆq and j ˆQ measurements for the simple harmonic oscillator, with ˆp and j ˆP measurements being
closely comparable. As above, for the Gibbs equilibrium state, Eq. (6),
ρ

δ(ˆq −˚q)

= ⟨ˆ1|δ(ˆq −˚q)|ˆ1⟩= e−˚q2/2kBT
√2πkBT
(33)
gives a Gaussian probability density that the position observable will be near ˚q. In classical mechanics, we can use the
Poisson bracket to generate unitary transformations such as ˆU = eκ ˆQ, which acts to translate the probability density,
giving a diﬀerent state, a modulated form of the Gibbs equilibrium state, for which
⟨ˆ1| ˆU†δ(ˆq −˚q) ˆU|ˆ1⟩= e−(˚q−κ)2/2kBT
√2πkBT
,
(34)
or we can say that this is a translated measurement of the Gibbs equilibrium state. We can further introduce convex
mixtures of such states for diﬀerent values of κ, such as ρB

δ(ˆq −˚q)

= P
i βi⟨ˆ1| ˆU†
i δ(ˆq −˚q) ˆUi|ˆ1⟩, with P
i βi = 1, or,
again, we can say that this is a more general measurement of the Gibbs equilibrium state. We can modulate the Gibbs
9

equilibrium state using arbitrary polynomials of ˆq, taking the fourier transform with respect to ˚q, diﬀerentiating a
three factor version of the generating function Eq. (12), and taking the inverse fourier transform back to the ˚q,
⟨ˆ1|ˆqn†δ(ˆq −˚q)ˆqn|ˆ1⟩
⟨ˆ1|ˆqn† ˆqn|ˆ1⟩
= 2nn!
(2n)!
˚q2n
(kBT)n
e−˚q2/2kBT
√2πkBT
,
(35)
so from this classical mechanics perspective we have constructed modulations of the Gibbs equilibrium state proba-
bility density, and indeed we can by superposition and mixture construct arbitrary positive multinomial modulations
of the Gibbs equilibrium state probability density, using
⟨F(ˆq, ˆp)|δ(ˆq −˚q)δ( ˆp −˚p)|F(ˆq, ˆp)⟩
⟨F(ˆq, ˆp)|F(ˆq, ˆp)⟩
= 1
N |F(˚q, ˚p)|2 e−(˚q2+ ˚p2)/2kBT

,
N =
Z
|F(˚q, ˚p)|2 e−(˚q2+ ˚p2)/2kBT
2πkBT
d˚qd ˚p,
(36)
provided the normalization constant N exists. Recalling §4, such states can also be thought of as the ground state
probability density associated with some diﬀerent Hamiltonian function.
For a random ﬁeld theory in operator form, such modulation of probability densities extends to there
being diﬀerent modulations of the Poincar´e invariant vacuum state in diﬀerent regions of space–time,
a higher order analog of modulating a single–frequency carrier signal[7]. Eq. (34), for example, can
be written using the pre–inner product, rather more abstractly, as
⟨ˆ1|e j ˆF†
gδ( ˆFf −v)e−j ˆFg|ˆ1⟩= e−(v−2Im[(f,g)])2/2(f,f)
√2π(f, f)
,
(37)
so that more or less displacement occurs depending on the imaginary part of the pre–inner product
(f, g). We can understand the vacuum state as a noisy, higher order carrier, for which the noise can
be considered a valuable resource for quantum computation purposes. Note that this way of working
with probabilities gives us a higher order mathematical structure than a classical ﬁeld.
We can also measure components of a transformed state such as ρB( ˆA). For the Gibbs equilibrium state component,
we can use the Gibbs equilibrium state projection operator ˆV = |ˆ1⟩⟨ˆ1|,
ρB( ˆV) =
X
βi⟨ˆ1| ˆU†
i ˆV ˆUi|ˆ1⟩,
or, using |v(ˆq, ˆp)⟩⟨v(ˆq, ˆp)|, we can measure any other component,
ρB(|v(ˆq, ˆp)⟩⟨v(ˆq, ˆp)|) =
X
βi⟨ˆ1| ˆU†
i |v(ˆq, ˆp)⟩⟨v(ˆq, ˆp)| ˆUi|ˆ1⟩.
This kind of construction is routine in quantum mechanics, but we can think of the Gibbs equilibrium state projection
operator as also a classically natural measure of how much a given state is like or unlike the Gibbs equilibrium state,
which we can use to construct comparisons with any modulated form of the Gibbs equilibrium state. We can construct
self–adjoint operators such as |v1⟩⟨v2| + |v2⟩⟨v1|, for two functions v1(ˆq, ˆp) and v2(ˆq, ˆp), as
|v1⟩⟨v2| + |v2⟩⟨v1| = 1
2

|v1 + v2⟩⟨v1 + v2| −|v1 −v2⟩⟨v1 −v2|

.
More generally, we can use arbitrary numbers of functions vi(ˆq, ˆp), or even more generally we can use limits in an
appropriate topology of sequences of such constructions, so that using the Gibbs equilibrium state projection operator
allows us to construct very general self–adjoint operators.
We can also use the well–known construction of a lowering operator aq as an unbounded operator for which
[aq, a†
q] = 1 and aq|ˆ1⟩= 0,
aq =
∞
X
m=0
√
m + 1 |Hm(ˆq)⟩⟨Hm+1(ˆq)|,
where Hm(ˆq) are orthonormal polynomials in ˆq for which ⟨Hm(ˆq)|Hn(ˆq)⟩= δm,n, constructed using |H0(ˆq)⟩= |ˆ1⟩,
ˆq|Hm(ˆq)⟩, and the Gram–Schmidt algorithm. Given this kind of construction, we can think of ˆq and ˆQ as complemen-
tary assessments of the physical state, as systematically weighted sums and diﬀerences of how much a given state is
like each of many possible states.
10

We can construct transformations of measurements and of states in many diﬀerent ways, where diﬀerent math-
ematical tools will correspond to diﬀerent physically available objects: apparatus such as diﬀraction gratings, half–
wave plates, et cetera. Transformations, which may or may not mutually commute, may be implemented in hardware,
where the experimental apparatus is engineered so that a single measurement result is a function of many mea-
surement results that could have been but are not performed, or in software, where a single measurement result is
computed as a function of the records of many measurement results that have been performed, as will be the case in
the Bell inequality–violating example in §7.2. The cycle of consecutive calibrations of mathematical models of new
measurement apparatus relative to well–understood state preparations and then of mathematical models of new state
preparations relative to well–understood measurement apparatus has a centuries–long history[31].
6.1. Minimal and extended classical mechanics
We can present the measurements that can be used in classical mechanics, for our purposes here, in three ways:
• Functions on phase space u(q, p), with multiplication (na¨ıve CM): this is a commutative algebra, with addition
and multiplication at a point.
• Functions on phase space u(q, p), with multiplication and the Poisson bracket: having three operations, this
is not a straightforward algebra at all. However, we can convert it into a straightforward associative, non–
commutative algebra of unary operators, generated by ˆq, ˆp, ˆQ, and ˆP, with [ ˆQ, ˆq] = 1 and [ ˆP, ˆp] = 1.
Now there are two choices:
– The Poisson bracket generated unary operators act only as transformations that leave the algebra of func-
tions on phase space invariant. We allow the use of exp(−κ ˆQ)·ˆq· exp(κ ˆQ)=ˆq −κ, but we do not allow the
use of, for example, exp(−κ ˆQ3)·ˆq· exp(κ ˆQ3)=ˆq −3κ ˆQ2 or any other construction that gives an operator that
is not a function of only ˆq and ˆp. The Poisson bracket binary operation phase space formalism for classical
mechanics only allows this case, because {u, v}(q, p) is indeed just another function on phase space. Call
this CM0.
– The Poisson bracket generated unary operators ˆQ and ˆP have the same standing as the ˆq and ˆp operators.
The general unary operator is a function u(ˆq, ˆp, ˆQ, ˆP), which is natural for a Koopman–type Hilbert space
formalism for classical mechanics. With this construction, Bell inequalities can be violated, for example,
because the algebra of operators is noncommutative[32, 33, 34]. Call this CM+.
Adopting CM+ steps outside of the CM0 that is natural for a phase space formalism for classical mechanics into what
is natural for a Hilbert space formalism for classical mechanics. A classical physicist can reasonably use CM+ as a
convenient, classical tool, and cannot reasonably be stopped from using it, but does not have to use it.
6.2. Modeling ﬁnite experimental data using matrix algebras for measurements and states
We can always present any ﬁnite amount of information about state preparations and measurements using a com-
mutative algebra of matrices, because if we use diagonal matrices of high enough dimension N we can always solve the
mn equations Aij = Tr[ ˆMi ˆρj] given, say, by a set of mn average values of experimental raw data {Ai j, i = 1..m, j = 1..n}
for the components of m diagonal measurement matrices ˆMi and the components of n diagonal density matrices ˆρj.
It is often much more convenient, however, indeed signiﬁcantly advantageous, as we know well from quantum me-
chanics, to solve for ˆMi and ˆρj as self-adjoint matrices of dimension≪N (this process can be made to work even if
we do not have averages for all mn cases). We can look for a dimension≪N for which the information looks “nicest”,
in some sense, and we have a lot of engineering information about what numbers of dimensions work well as a ﬁrst
approximation for a given experiment: this process is known as quantum tomography, where “the aim is to estimate
an unknown state from outcomes of measurements performed on an ensemble of identical prepared systems”[35].
Classical mechanics can equally well adopt this kind of construction and call it a system of contextual models.
In quantum mechanics in practice, we prepare many states and measure them in many ways, however in quantum
mechanics as a global metaphysics we more think of there being a single state measured in many ways, in which
case in solving Ai = Tr[ ˆMi ˆρ] there is at least one basis in which ˆρ is a diagonal matrix ρjδ jk, so that in that basis
Tr[ ˆMi ˆρ] = P
j Mi, jjρj. If there is only one state all measurements can be taken to commute because oﬀ–diagonal
entries in such a basis can be taken to be zero, so the one–state metaphysics of quantum mechanics can be taken to be
11

the same as the one–state metaphysics of the CM0 of classical physics: if we ever consider subensembles, however,
the possibility of it being advantageous to use CM+ re–emerges.
At a higher level, we might also ﬁnd it convenient to present information using Positive Operator Valued Measures
(POVMs), using a smaller Hilbert space, even though we know by Neumark’s theorem that we can always present the
same information using Projection Valued Measures (PVMs) by introducing an ancilla system to construct a larger
Hilbert space[36, §II.2.4], but again we do not as classical physicists have to use this construction, it is just there for
us to use if it is convenient to do so.
7. Classical thinking about states and measurement
We will develop here the idea that thinking in terms of CM+ can illuminate quantum mechanics, even if we never
use CM+. Many more aspects could be considered, but we will focus here on a partial solution of the measurement
problem in §7.1, the violation of Bell–type inequalities in §7.2, and Schr¨odinger’s cat in §7.3.
7.1. The measurement problem
We will take the measurement problem of quantum theory to concern the dynamics of “collapse” or “reduction”
of the state when a measurement happens, which can be thought an unwanted contrast to the unitary dynamics that
applies at all other times. For our purposes in this subsection, we will exclude aspects of the measurement problem
that concern the interpretation of probability, such as the relationship between probability and statistics and other uses
of experimental raw data such as Bayesian updating, because this is also an issue for classical physics. We will also
ﬁlter the extensive literature by insisting that whatever we say about measurement must seem natural to a classical
physicist who decides to adopt CM+. To that end, the principle we will apply is
Principle (JM): if we perform joint measurements that result in joint relative frequencies, then we must
use mutually commutative self–adjoint operators to model those measurements.
Principle (JM) is quite natural for a classical physicist who has previously always used CM0, and, as argued in §6.2, we
can always model ﬁnite experimental data using only commutative operators, but it is subtly not as natural in quantum
mechanics, partly because although at space–like separation measurement operators are required to commute, at
time–like separation measurement operators may or may not commute and we have instead become accustomed to
invoking “collapse” of the state. Principle (JM) is unnecessary, however, except as emphasis, if we insist that all
measurements must be modeled by self-adjoint operators, insofar as if ˆA†= ˆA and ˆX†= ˆX are both self-adjoint then ˆA ˆX
can only be self-adjoint if [ ˆA, ˆX] = 0. More explicitly, if ˆA†= ˆA, ˆX†= ˆX, and a density operator ˆρ†= ˆρ are all mutually
noncommutative, [ ˆA, ˆX] , 0, [ ˆA, ˆρ] , 0, [ ˆX, ˆρ] , 0, then

has an imaginary part. Unless we ensure that either ˆA or ˆX always commutes with the density operator, we cannot
model actual joint experimental results, which do not have an imaginary part, using operators that do not commute.
The concept of quantum non–demolition measurements, deﬁned as mutually compatible measurements at time–
like separation[3], is well–known to quantum physics, but it is not usually insisted on when modeling joint measure-
ments: a notable exception, however, is the Nondemolition Principle that is introduced by Belavkin[26], which is very
close in concept to Principle (JM). We will show below how Principle (JM) can be reconciled with the usual formalism
of “collapse”.
In the “collapse” literature in quantum mechanics, the elementary linear algebraic construction asserts that after
a measurement ˆA that admits a discrete spectral projection ˆA = P
i αi ˆPi, where ˆPi ˆPj = δi j ˆPi, P
i ˆPi = 1, for which
[ ˆA, ˆPi] = 0, a density operator ˆρ evolves instantaneously to a density operator ˆρA = P
i ˆPi ˆρ ˆPi, which is known as a
L¨uders transformer in the von Neumann–L¨uders measurement model[36, §§II.3.2-3].
This diﬀers a little in detail from an elementary textbook description such as
“If the particle is in a state |ψ⟩, measurement of the variable (corresponding to) Ωwill
yield one of the eigenvalues ω with probability P(ω) ∝|⟨ω|ψ⟩|2. The state of the system
will change from |ψ⟩to |ω⟩as a result of the measurement.”[37, §4.1],
12

which we can model as a measurement ˆPi ˆA that not only measures ˆA but also projects to (discards all
but) a single eigenspace of ˆA (although this does not model a stochastic transformation, as discussed
below). [[ See also Appendix B for a discussion that is less abstract than follows below. ]]
After a measurement ˆA with this prescription, the expected value for a subsequent incommensurate measurement ˆX,
[ ˆA, ˆX] , 0, will be given by

(39)
because of the cyclic property of the trace and because [ ˆA, ˆPi] = 0, so that the L¨uders transformer applied to the
state ˆρ 7→ˆρA is equivalent to that L¨uders transformer applied to the measurement ˆX 7→ˆXA. This forces mutual
commutativity and allows joint measurement in a minimal way, [ ˆA, ˆXA] = 0, Tr[ ˆA ˆXA ˆρ] = Tr[ ˆXA ˆAˆρ], with no change of
the state. In the quantum ﬁeld theory context, where microcausality is satisﬁed, this identity makes it very clear that
“collapse” only aﬀects components of measurements that are at time–like separation from the measurement that causes
the collapse: “collapse” is not instantaneous when considered in terms of measurements. After joint measurement of
ˆA and ˆXA, we can apply the same construction using the discrete spectral projection of ˆXA, Tr
h ˆA ˆXA ˆY ˆρXA
i
= Tr
h ˆA ˆXA ˆYXA ˆρ
i

et cetera. The discussion here focuses on joint measurement, in which context it is natural to consider the identity
Tr
h ˆA ˆX ˆρA
i
= Tr
h ˆA ˆXA ˆρ
i
, however we can also consider the identity Tr
h ˆX ˆρA
i
= Tr
h ˆXA ˆρ
i
, which shows more concisely that
a measurement ˆX after the collapse of the state after a measurement ˆA, ˆρ 7→ˆρA, is equivalent to a measurement ˆXA
without any collapse.
The L¨uders transformer applied to subsequent measurements instead of as a collapse of the state simply enforces
Principle (JM). For measurements that cannot be modeled by a discrete spectral projection, or when a state does not
admit presentation as a density operator, we will have to ensure that whatever measurement operators we use for
sequential joint measurement satisfy Principle (JM) without being able to use the L¨uders transformer as a tool. It
may in any case be best to be careful when using the L¨uders transformer, insofar as it may not be the best way to use
experience to choose an operator as a ﬁrst approximate model for a given measurement: the L¨uders transformer is
certainly not the only way to enforce Principle (JM). Note, however, that although idealized measurements are often
modeled as having continuous sample spaces, for real experiments there is always discretization by an analog-to-
digital conversion, so that real measurements can always be modeled by a discrete spectral projection. Any observable
ˆA can be discretized as a binary value, using the Heaviside function, as, for a simplest example, ˆAx = θ(x −ˆA) · 0 +
θ( ˆA −x) · 1.
The L¨uders transformer is a projection, ( ˆXA)A = ˆXA, that maps operators to the commutant of ˆA, [ ˆA, ˆXA] = 0. If |1⟩
and |2⟩are eigenvectors of ˆA, ˆA| j⟩= αj| j⟩, ˆPi| j⟩= δi j|j⟩, we have

The L¨uders transformer, as a linear operator, does not model a stochastic transformation of a density operator that
might be loosely written as
µ|1⟩⟨1| + (1−µ)|2⟩⟨2| 7→either |1⟩⟨1| or |2⟩⟨2|,
with probabilities µ and 1−µ respectively,
(40)
which steps outside the linear algebraic representation of expected values and probability densities and, indirectly, of
statistics that lossily compress the full details of the experimental raw data. Although we can model the discarding of
states for the purposes of joint measurements by using a measurement operator such as ˆPi ˆA, the L¨uders transformer for
this operator is ˆXPiA = ˆPi ˆX ˆPi + (1−ˆPi) ˆX(1−ˆPi), which is not the content of Eq. (40). Such a stochastic transformation
is also not modeled in the classical statistical mechanics of §2, §4, and §5, so we will not further address it here, as was
declared at the beginning of this subsection, despite its obvious interest. See Belavkin[26] for one way to introduce
stochastic transformations.
It might be thought that the perfect repeatability of experimental results requires collapse of the state, however the
mathematics already ensures perfect correlations of repeated measurements. If we perform a measurement modeled
13

by ˆA, followed by the same measurement at a later time, modeled by ˆB = ˆU†(t) ˆA ˆU(t), the joint probability density is

so that the results are perfectly correlated without any explicit collapse mechanism being required. This can be thought
no more than an elementary, very idealized, and somewhat unrigorous version of Mott’s result[38], that a track in a
Wilson cloud chamber can be modeled by correlations already contained in a state: there is no necessity to collapse a
state to model such correlations. Conversely, if perfect correlation is not observed, so that the results do not correspond
to the mathematics above, then we have not performed the same measurement twice and we should not model the two
measurements using the same operator.
The linear algebra above —the three equations (38), (39), and (41)— and Principle (JM) can be understood to
be as natural as a way to eliminate “collapse” of the state as a separate dynamics in quantum mechanics as it is in
classical statistical mechanics. If we actually record a sequence of instrument readings over time and construct joint
statistics using those records, those joint statistics will be consistent with a joint probability density, but they will not
be consistent with a quasiprobability distribution that is for some joint values negative or complex. Since for some
states noncommutative operators will generate joint distributions for real measurements that are negative or complex
(which might be thought embarrassing), the operators we use to model actually recorded joint measurements had
better be mutually commutative.
On this appeal to CM+, there is, for example, no need for decoherence, just as there is no need for decoherence in
classical probability theory when using statistics to model the throwing of a die. A die, unlike a sphere, is typically
engineered to almost always give one of six results, with care taken to use a material for which internal degrees of
freedom can be ignored for most purposes: an easily malleable die could be quite diﬀerent.
The idea that measurement of ˆA makes it in general not possible to jointly measure ˆA and ˆX if [ ˆA, ˆX] , 0, but
always possible to jointly measure ˆA and ˆXA (which we might call “ ˆX after ˆA”), is a form of contextuality, insofar
as what can be measured after ˆA has been measured is determined by the L¨uders transformer. We could instead,
however, jointly measure ˆAX (which we might call “ ˆA modiﬁed so it does not aﬀect ˆX”) with ˆX, because ˆXAX = ˆX. For
an elaborate discussion of joint measurement and the travails of noncontextuality, see [39], however Eq. (39) puts the
enforcement of Principle (JM) as equivalent to collapse of the state in a very compact form.
Although we can equally apply L¨uders transformers to subsequent measurements or to the state, which we choose
to do when modeling an experiment can be decided by what seems useful at the time: it is, in particular, often useful
to think of a measurement as a preparation of a state. If microcausality is satisﬁed by measurements, however, it is as
well to remember that applying the L¨uders transformer to a state is then to that extent not a nonlocal operation.
A comparable approach, using “multitime correlation functions”, is suggested by ¨Ottinger[40, §1.2.4.1, §1.2.9.3],
in a more elaborate formalism of quantum master equations that seeks also to model stochastic transformations of
a density operator, as also does Belavkin’s approach[26], which at the linear algebraic level explicitly uses quantum
non-demolition measurements.
For a lucid account of the history of the measurement problem and for other recent literature, see Landsman[29,
Ch. 11]. In such terms, as a counterpoint to the account above, Principle (JM) eﬀectively formalizes the Copenhagen
interpretation’s requirement that an experimental apparatus in the raw and its results must be described classically,
and Eq. (39) gives a concrete mathematical form to Bohr’s doctrine of Complementarity, an idea that measurements
aﬀect the possibility of other measurements as an alternative to an idea that measurements change the state, which
makes decoherence as (an example of) a mechanism to change the state unnecessary (see [29, pp. 4–5].) Note that we
have to distinguish between variants of the Copenhagen interpretation[41, 42], because Bohr rejected collapse of the
wave function, whereas Heisenberg, in particular, emphasized its necessity: Eq. (39) oﬀers a mathematically reasoned
resolution of this diﬀerence. Landsman introduces what he calls “Bohriﬁcation, i.e., the mathematical interpretation
of Bohr’s classical concepts by commutative C∗–algebras”[29, p. viii], which is rather close to Principle (JM) in spirit,
but, without Eq. (39) to attribute “collapse” to the enforcement of “Bohriﬁcation”, he
14

“describes measurement as a physical process, including the collapse that settles the outcome (as opposed to
reinterpretations of the uncollapsed state, as in modal or Everettian interpretations). However, in our approach
collapse takes place within unitary quantum theory.”[29, p. 14]
In contrast, we made no attempt here to discuss the ﬁnal stochastic process, insofar as this problem is shared with
classical statistical physics.
7.2. The violation of Bell–type inequalities
All raw data in modern experiments, whether described classically or quantum mechanically, comes into a com-
puter along shielded signal lines attached to exotic materials that are coupled to their local surroundings and that
are, furthermore, driven by support circuitry in carefully engineered ways. What may be an elaborate hardware and
software process cannot be perfectly described in a single sentence, but in outline the analog signal level is sampled
and converted into binary form and the data is saved in computer storage. There can be signiﬁcant variations in this
process: signal levels on many signal lines might each be stored as a 10–bit value every picosecond, say, but more
typically, applying a very substantial level of compression, one or many signal levels may be analyzed for “trigger”
conditions and information about a trigger event is stored only if a trigger condition is satisﬁed.
At the level of the signal picosecond by picosecond, there is in a sense no collapse, but if material properties and
electronic circuitry are engineered to give a signal that satisﬁes a trigger condition only occasionally, then we can
think of that moment as a collapse, but we can also think of it as very like the classical moment when we decide that
a die has ﬁnally settled after it has landed and rolled a few times, before we pick up the die to throw it again.
Crucially in what follows, an empiricist approach should not too quickly assume that the satisfaction of signal level
trigger conditions is caused by a “particle” or any other isolated system: from a classical signal analysis perspective,
the signal levels are more appropriately associated with whatever locally surrounds the exotic materials and circuitry
that directly drive the signal levels, with the whole experimental apparatus being driven in turn by other exotic ma-
terials and circuitry that are relatively remote, tens or thousands of meters away. Certainly an operator algebra may
include idealized operators that have a discrete spectrum (or, classically, a discrete sample space), as well as operators
that more realistically model the ﬁnite widths of real spectra, but we should not —or, again, not too quickly— assume
that a discrete spectrum implies that there are point particles that cause that discreteness.
For a review of the violation of Bell–type inequalities, see [43]. For a speciﬁc experiment that violates a Bell–
type inequality, we consider the measurements that were performed by Weihs[44, 45], for which see Fig. 1, which
we take to be a compressed description of six measured voltages, q1(t), q2(t), q3(t), q4(t), q5(t), q6(t), on signal lines
attached to four Avalanche PhotoDiodes (APDs), two for Alice, a1 = q1, a2 = q2, and two for Bob, b1 = q4, b2 = q5,
and to two ElectroOptic Modulators (EOMs), A = q3, B = q6. See [45, page 60] for a beautifully clear schematic of the
experiment. All six of these voltages are the output of electronic systems that both have complex dynamics of their
own and are externally driven in complex ways, enough that we cannot measure the associated momenta. The trigger
conditions, however, implicitly use crude assessments of the time derivatives of the signals over device appropriate
time scales. The APD signals are mostly near zero voltage, but, at random intervals, on average once every ∼100 µs
during the Weihs experiment, each APD signal becomes and stays near a larger voltage, which we will call “1”, for ∼1
µs (the “dead time”), so that each APD signal level averaged over long periods is ∼0.01. Considered over long periods
each APD is in a time–translation invariant thermodynamic equilibrium, whereas over short periods each APD is in a
thermodynamically metastable state that is engineered to be easily disturbed. The APDs, and the state of the whole
experimental apparatus, are driven by a single light source, through a relatively exotic crystal, in a way that results in

elaborate correlations between the signals a1, a2, b1, and b2. The two EOMs are driven by external voltages that are
as statistically independent as possible, so that the signal level at each EOM might or might not change between “0”
and “1” every ∼0.1 µs.
The raw signal level data, if it were recorded as six voltages averaged over a picosecond timescale and digitized to
10–bit accuracy, would be 8 Terabytes per second, so it was lossily compressed in hardware by recording the time at
which each APD signal changes from 0 to 1, as a 64–bit number, with accuracy ∼0.5 ns, together with the local EOM
signal (A for a1 and a2, B for b1 and b2), provided that the local EOM signal is not at the same time changing between
the values 0 and 1. The compressed data rate was therefore ∼100 kilobytes per second per APD.
This is all that was done during each experimental run, which was followed much later by signal analysis in
which signal transition times were compared and pairs of transition times that were close to coincident (within a few
nanoseconds) were collated into 16 categories, for events on the a1 or a2 signal lines and for the EOM signal line A
either 0 or 1, and similarly for Bob’s signal lines. For example, for data from the experimental run longdist35, which
can be obtained on reasonable request from Gregor Weihs, we can construct a table such as Table 1 (with general
properties as shown, but with the precise numbers depending on details of the algorithm and its parameters). The 16
observables in Table 1 are in four groups, corresponding to events post–selected according to the EOM settings, for
which we compute relative frequencies,
E00 = 320 −2006 −1780 + 364
320 + 2006 + 1780 + 364 = −0.694;
E10 = 1675 −300 −193 + 1212
1675 + 300 + 193 + 1212 = 0.708;
E01 = 439 −1658 −1741 + 374
439 + 1658 + 1741 + 374 = −0.614;
E11 = 293 −1463 −1200 + 181
293 + 1463 + 1200 + 181 = −0.698;
|E00 + E01 + E11 −E10| = 2.714.
(42)
The last expression exhibits the violation of a Bell–type inequality, which shows that the observables concerned cannot
be elements of a commutative algebra[32, 33, 34]. Ordinarily, this would be a death knell for classical mechanics, but
it is not for CM+.
We can apply Principle (JM) to this description of the Weihs experiment: measurements of the six qi(t) over time
are joint measurements, as is the lossily compressed data that is actually stored, so they should be modeled by mutually
commuting operators (even though the experiment as performed only records one instance at each time and place.)
The signal analysis algorithm, however, constructs statistics for events on the a1 or a2 signal lines and for the EOM
signal line A being either 0 or 1: we cannot make joint measurements of the occurrence of events on the a1 signal
line when the EOM signal line A is both 0 and 1, so such statistics may well have to be modeled by noncommuting
operators —which, again, can be done within CM+.
A typical quantum theoretical model for this experiment introduces two 2–dimensional Hilbert spaces, HAlice,
spanned by |HAlice⟩and |VAlice⟩, and HBob, spanned by |HBob⟩and |VBob⟩, and the 4–dimensional tensor product
HAlice ⊗HBob. Relative frequencies of a1 and a2 events can be represented by one pair of orthogonal projection
operators ˆA1 and ˆA2 acting on HAlice for A = 0 and by a diﬀerent pair of orthogonal projection operators ˆA′
1 and ˆA′
2
acting on HAlice for A = 1, and similarly for relative frequencies of b1 and b2 events for B = 0 and B = 1. ˆA1, ˆA2, ˆA′
1,
and ˆA′
2 generate a noncommutative algebra of operators A; ˆB1, ˆB2, ˆB′
1, and ˆB′
2 generate a noncommutative algebra of
16

operators B, all of which commute with all of A; and together they generate an algebra of operators A∨B. Following
Landau’s derivation[32] (but see also [43, §I.A]), deﬁne ˆa = ˆA1−ˆA2, ˆb = ˆB1−ˆB2, ˆa′ = ˆA′
1−ˆA′
2, and ˆb′ = ˆB′
1−ˆB′
2, for
which ˆa2 = ˆb2 = ˆa′2 = ˆb′2 = 1, and deﬁne
ˆC = ˆaˆb + ˆaˆb′ + ˆa′ˆb′ −ˆa′ˆb,
for which we ﬁnd eight terms in ˆC2 cancel, leaving ˆC2 = 4 + [ˆa, ˆa′][ˆb, ˆb′]. For CM0, we would obtain, in a state ρ,
because both commutators must be zero, |ρ( ˆC)|2 ≤ρ( ˆC2) = 4, whereas for CM+ and QM we obtain, because for the
spectral norm we have ∥ˆa∥= ∥ˆb∥= ∥ˆa′∥= ∥ˆb′∥= 1 and hence ∥[ˆa, ˆa′][ˆb, ˆb′]∥≤4, ∥ˆC2∥≤8, |ρ( ˆC)|2 ≤ρ( ˆC2) ≤8. An
extremal 4×4 matrix model of the above algebraic structure and a state for which |ρ( ˆC)| = 2
√
2 > 2 is given in Appendix
C. In Eq. (42) above, E00 ∼ρ(ˆaˆb), E10 ∼ρ(ˆa′ˆb), E01 ∼ρ(ˆaˆb′), and E11 ∼ρ(ˆa′ˆb′). Other Bell–type inequalities that
depend on whether the algebra of operators that are allowed in models is commutative or noncommutative can be
derived.
The above derivation is independent of locality, however a state over A ∨B that generates relative frequencies
close to those in Table 1 is nonlocal in the sense that it is not a product of a state over A and another state over B. As
superﬁcially perplexing as this is usually thought to be, a nonlocality that is determined by the boundary conditions
of the experimental apparatus is expected for a classical time–translation invariant equilibrium state, with equilibrium
being established more or less quickly depending on the dynamics at smaller scale. Such a 4–dimensional Hilbert
space model derives from an inﬁnite–dimensional Hilbert space that models the electromagnetic ﬁeld state of the
whole of the experimental apparatus, but we can as much take that Hilbert space and measurement operators that act
on it to be generated by a random ﬁeld[7] as we usually take it to be generated by a quantum ﬁeld; Bell inequalities
for random ﬁelds are also discussed in [46]. Note that taking APD events to be a result of coupling of the APDs to the
electromagnetic ﬁeld is an alternative to taking APD events to be measurements of particle properties.
7.2.1. An experimental proposal
For the experiment above, the statistics of events on the signal lines are time–translation invariant, in that we turn
on the power to a laser that drives the state, wait some reasonable length of time, then collect data, but if we waited
for a slightly longer or shorter length of time we would obtain a very similar violation of a Bell–type inequality.
A signal analysis approach to such data suggests that it would be both theoretically and technologically useful to
characterize how the violation evolves over time immediately after the power to the laser is turned on, because it
is surely not guaranteed a priori that the numbers of coincident events and the violation of the Bell–type inequality
will increase precisely as fast as the number of events on each signal line separately. Indeed, insofar as the violation
of Bell–type inequalities in such experiments is a time–translation invariant equilibrium condition, we would more
expect the approach to an equilibrium nonlocal state that results in the violation of Bell–type inequalities might be
slower than the approach to a local equilibrium of events on each signal line: it would be interesting to know by
precisely how much, or whether it is in fact just as fast. It may well be that for some applications we cannot leave
the power to the laser permanently on, in which case how the numbers of coincident events and the violation of Bell–
type inequalities change over time after power is supplied may also be technologically important. It may also be that
the numbers of coincident events and the violation of Bell–type inequalities will increase at diﬀerent rates when the
separation between Alice and Bob is increased or when diﬀerent optical components are used, or subtle universalities
may emerge even for apparently very diﬀerent experiments. It would seem signiﬁcant, for example, if it takes time
equivalent to some large multiple of the length of the whole apparatus before violation of Bell–type inequalities is
established.
To investigate such variation over time, we can turn on the power to the laser, wait a millisecond (or more or less,
if we discover this is shorter or longer than necessary), turn oﬀthe power and wait until the event rate decreases to the
dark rate, and repeat this process until we have enough statistics. From the resulting data, we can compute counts as
above for Table 1 for events in every 0.1µs time slice, say, after the power is turned on, and plot the increase of single
events on each APD signal line, the numbers of coincident events, and the violation of the Bell–type inequality over
time after the power is turned on. If we wish to understand the dynamics of such experiments, instead of essentially
static statistics, we should investigate the variation of coincidences and of the violation of Bell–type inequalities over
time. An alternative computation, which can be performed using the same data, would consider how the violation of
Bell–type inequalties is diﬀerent for an ensemble of the very ﬁrst coincident pairs after each time the power is turned
on, for an ensemble of the second coincident pairs, and so on, independent of the timings of the coincident pairs.
17

Consideration of electromagnetic ﬁeld observables as well as of avalanche event timings in APDs also suggests
that correlations between the detailed APD signal voltages averaged over, say, nanosecond or picosecond periods
(conditioned both on the EOM signals A and B and on which of the four APD signals a1, a2, b1, and b2 are currently in
their avalanche state) should be examined for whether correlations of avalanche timings and the associated violation of
Bell–type inequalities can also be detected in other, less compressed experimental raw data[43, §VII.C.2]. The APDs
are coupled to the electromagnetic ﬁeld that is driven by the electrically active components of the experiment and
modiﬁed and contained by exotic materials, wave guides, and other electrically inactive components of the experiment,
so that there should be some correlations between the detailed APD signal voltages and the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
It will be interesting to know, however, whether APD events are eﬀectively “rogue wave”–type events, for which
precursor conditions that allow prediction are typically very diﬃcult to identify.
7.3. Schr¨odinger’s cat: what’s the state?
Suppose a quantum physicist prepares a box and tells a classical physicist that in the box there is a cat that is in
a superposition of being alive and being dead. It’s a little whimsical to ask, as whimsical perhaps as thinking about
cats in the context of quantum mechanics is always bound to be, but how can the classical physicist be sure whether
the quantum physicist is telling the truth? Most often there is a song and a dance about decay of a nucleus that is
initially assumed to be in a pure state and about unitary transformation of the nucleus and cat[47, §I A], but idealized
claims about a state preparation have to be backed up with experimental veriﬁcation that all possible eﬀects of other
degrees of freedom have been completely enough eliminated[48]. Is the state a superposition or a mixture? We focus
here only on the extent to which the answer depends on whether we allow a noncommutative algebra of operators as
models for measurements.
Both classically and quantum mechanically, suppose that when we open the box and we measure whether the
cat is alive, using a projection operator that we can present as ˆA =
 1
0
0
0
!
, acting on a Hilbert space that is, as in
§7.2, spanned by two vectors, |Alive⟩and |Dead⟩, but that derives from a much higher–dimensional Hilbert space, in
either CM0, CM+, or QM. Then through some experimental sleight of hand —an ensemble of cats in boxes— we
obtain a probability α that the cat is alive. We can represent that result using a density matrix
 α
β
β∗1−α
!
, which is
consistent with either a mixed state such as ˆMα =
 α
0
0 1−α
!
or a pure state such as ˆS α =
 
α
√α(1−α)
√α(1−α)
1−α
!
, for
all of which we obtain precisely the same probability α that the cat is alive. To tell whether the quantum physicist
is telling the truth, the classical physicist must use other observables, such as what could be called the Lewis Carroll
operators, ˆC1 =
 0
1
1
0
!
and ˆC2 =
 0
j
−j
0
!
, each of which, in slightly diﬀerent ways, takes a live cat and kills it and
takes a dead cat and resuscitates it: a little strange and very diﬃcult to implement, but comprehensible to a Victorian
mathematician and in CM+. With these operators as well as ˆA, the classical physicist can determine β, which likely
eliminates both β = 0 and β = √α(1−α) as possibilities, which cannot be done if the classical physicist only uses
operators that are compatible with ˆA.
According to the usual account, a classical physicist’s measurements are always mutually commutative, which
can even be held up as the fundamental diﬀerence between classical and quantum. In that case, the classical physicist
cannot tell whether the alleged preparation is what the quantum physicist says it is or not. If the classical physicist
accepts that all their measurements are and must be mutually commutative, they can reasonably say, “Huh, it’s just a
mixture, which I understand well enough, you’re just muddying perfectly clear waters by saying that it’s a superpo-
sition”. In fact, however, the Lewis Carroll operators are classically well–enough–deﬁned. If the classical physicist
allows themselves to use the Lewis Carroll and similar operators, then they can tell whether the state is a pure state,
and they can conﬁrm all the quantum physicist’s claims, but with that expansion of what a classical physicist can do,
to CM+ instead of CM0, a quantum physicist is hardly diﬀerent from a “unary” classical physicist.
The question “Is the cat dead?” is embedded in a ﬁeld of questions: we can ask “Is the cat’s heart working?”, “Is
the cat’s liver working?”, “has a particular hair on the cat’s left rear leg fallen out?”, and so on and on, but CM+ allows
us also to ask diﬀerently integrative questions, such as “Is the cat between alive and dead, with its heart working
but with its liver not working?” As we ask more and more detailed questions, and discover answers, we construct
larger and larger Hilbert spaces that contain the Hilbert spaces we construct if we ask fewer questions (for quantum
18

ﬁeld theory, and for the equivalent mathematics in CM+, every detailed question has the possibility of more detailed
questions, ...) Perhaps most importantly, experimental apparatus we can actually construct allows us to ask some of
the possible integrative questions “in hardware”, not just by analysis of more detailed questions: we can construct
diﬀraction gratings to answer questions about the weighted average of the answers to many detailed questions without
knowing the answers to any of the individual questions.
Insofar as resuscitation of a long–dead cat is in practice impossible for either a classical or a quantum physicist, of
course no–one can prepare an eigenstate of the Lewis Carroll operators. If we can physically implement such reversals
for a given real system, however, which in practice for some we can[47], it can equally be modeled by a classical or
a quantum physicist, and such operations can be used as a computational resource. As a last word —though in CM+
there is arguably no last word— we have been wont to discuss “quantum systems” as distinct from “classical systems”,
according to whether we can implement multiple clearly incompatible measurements, but it seems better to discuss
“nontrivial systems of measurements”, which is more neutral both as to the distinction between CM+ and QM, and
also as to whether there is such a thing as a distinguishable “system”.
8. Discussion
We have here constructed a presentation of unary classical mechanics for which only the measurement theory is the
same as a reasonable, if rather minimal, measurement theory for quantum mechanics, a relationship between states–
and–operators and experimental raw data, which provides a conceptual bridge between unary classical mechanics and
quantum mechanics. We have deliberately made no attempt, however, to construct a more deﬁnite mathematical link
between them, of a formal quantization procedure. The informal connecting link is that for both there are statistical
states over ∗–algebras, or, more simply, that for both there are “Hilbert spaces” as a way to describe diﬀerent ex-
perimental contexts and diﬀerent signal analysis algorithms, but with diﬀerent states over diﬀerent ∗–algebras. The
change of perspective suggested here is almost no change at all: perhaps it might be as well to rename quantum com-
puting, say, as “Hilbert computing”, to demystify it, but the Hilbert space heart of the work is no diﬀerent, except for,
perhaps, a clearer understanding of measurement by analogy with classical measurement and signal analysis.
Although we can interpret unary classical mechanics in whatever way we interpret quantum mechanics, there is
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in that for unary classical mechanics Planck’s constant plays no part. In a more elaborate
framework of random ﬁelds and quantum ﬁelds, however, isomorphisms can be constructed for some cases, including
the physically important case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld[7, 49], for which a clear symmetry group distinction can
be seen between Poincar´e invariant quantum ﬂuctuations, with an action scale determined by Planck’s constant, and
thermal ﬂuctuations that are invariant under only the little group of the Poincar´e group that is deﬁned by a Hamiltonian
operator, with an energy scale determined by temperature and the Boltzmann constant[50]. Such a distinction is of
course not available in the absence of the 1+n–signature metric of Minkowski space. The algebraic connection
between the constructions given here for unary classical mechanics and quantum mechanics is nonetheless very close,
in that Eq. (12) for the Gibbs equilibrium state of a classical simple harmonic oscillator is equally satisﬁed for
the ground state of a quantized simple harmonic oscillator or the vacuum state of a free quantum ﬁeld if the pre–
inner product (f, g) is suitably replaced. For the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, in a manifestly Poincar´e invariant
construction[7], we have, as for Eq. (12),

with the metric tensor gµν being constant of signature (1,-1,-1,-1) and kα ˜fαµ
∗(k) and kβ˜gβν(k) are both space–like 4–
vectors orthogonal to the light–like 4–vector k. The algebraic structure is identical, the Weyl–Heisenberg group, but
with diﬀerent geometric structures.
There is a second diﬀerence, noted earlier, that although the Hamiltonian function of classical mechanics is positive
the Liouvillian operator that generates evolution over time is not a positive operator, in contrast to the Hamiltonian
operator that generates evolution over time in quantum theory, which is positive. This closely parallels the observation
19

that the systematic use of quantum non-demolition measurement operators within the quantum mechanics formalism
results in a generator of evolution over time that is non–positive[3, Eq. (12)]. This diﬀerence changes analytic
properties of the dynamics signiﬁcantly, however it does not change the abstract relationships between measurements
and operator algebras and between statistics of measurement results and states.
The traditional connection between classical probabilities generated by theoretical physics and statistics of exper-
imental raw data does not require a “collapse” of a state: the state reports probabilities, which are somehow related
to statistics of ensembles. We here suggest a pragmatic case-by-case agnosticism about that relationship, without any
stipulation that it must be Bayesian, frequentist, parameter estimation, or otherwise, although for those who have a
strongly held adherence to a particular metaphysical interpretation of quantum mechanics, the Hilbert space mathe-
matics for unary classical mechanics given here can be interpreted in that same way. As was shown in §7.1, “collapse”
of the state is also not required insofar as we can insist on the classically natural Principle (JM), that joint measure-
ments must be modeled by mutually commuting operators. Thirdly, as noted in §7.2, the electronic signals within an
apparatus are not essentially discontinuous when they are considered at suﬃcient resolution: it is only when signals
satisfy elaborate trigger conditions that we identify events. It should also be noted that Gibbsian states are subject to
question from a classical perspective[51]. Whatever interpretation one adopts, however, one cannot quite as easily
say, for example, that at small scales the world is quantum, at large scales the world is classical, insofar as the classical
is quantum too. If we understand the measurement problem for classical mechanics, then we as much understand it
for quantum mechanics.

Appendix A. Eq. (12) is a state
We can show directly for any operator ˆA that ρ( ˆA† ˆA) ≥0 (separately from the explicit construction of Eq. (12) as
the usual ground state for an algebra of raising and lowering operators), the other properties required being straight-
forward. ˆA can be written as a sum of exponential terms, ˆA = P
i αie j ˆFfi, so that, applying Eq. (12),
ρ( ˆA† ˆA) =

i e j ˆFf j) =

X
i,j
[αie−(f∗
i ,fi)/2]∗e(fi,f j)[α je−(f∗
j ,f j)/2] ≥0,
which is positive semi-deﬁnite because e(fi,fj) is a Hadamard exponential of (fi, f j), which is a positive semi-deﬁnite
matrix because it is a Gram matrix.
Appendix B. Joint measurement instruments
We give here a joint measurement instrument account that parallels the more abstract discussion in §7.1. Follow-
ing the account and notation given by Ballentine[52, §3.3], we consider measurements ˆA and ˆB that have discrete
degenerate eigenvalues ai and bj,
ˆA|aiλ⟩= ai|aiλ⟩,
ˆB|b jµ⟩= bi|bjµ⟩
(we will omit the degenerate eigenvector indices λ and µ except where necessary.) To implement these measurements,
we introduce measurement instruments A and B that are initially in vector states |A0⟩and |B0⟩and unitary evolutions
ˆUA|ai⟩⊗|A0⟩
=
|ai⟩⊗|Ai⟩,
ˆUB|bj⟩⊗|B0⟩
=
|bj⟩⊗|Bj⟩.
20

By linearity, for a general vector |ψ⟩,
ˆUA|ψ⟩⊗|A0⟩=
X
i
⟨ai|ψ⟩· |ai⟩⊗|Ai⟩,
and similarly for ˆUB. We apply ﬁrst ˆUA and then ˆUB,
ˆUB ˆUA|ψ⟩⊗|A0⟩⊗|B0⟩=
X
j
X
i
⟨b j|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩· |b j⟩⊗|Ai⟩⊗|Bj⟩,
from which, using the Born rule, we extract probabilities
P(A = ai |ψ)
=
|⟨ai|ψ⟩|2
P(A = ai & B = bj |ψ)
=
|⟨bj|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩|2.
The probability of a measurement result B = bj given that a measurement A has been made, but averaging over its
measurement results, is
P(B = bj |ψ and A measured) =
X
i
|⟨bj|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩|2,
(B.1)
which diﬀers from the probability of a measurement result B = bj given that a measurement A was never made,
P(B = b j |ψ) =

X
i
⟨b j|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩

2
= |⟨bj|ψ⟩|2,
by the omission of “interference” terms, unless ˆA and ˆB commute. We can rewrite Eq. (B.1), using a projection
operator associated with each eigenvalue ai, ˆPi = P
λ |aiλ⟩⟨aiλ|, as
P(B = b j |ψ and A measured) =
X
i
⟨bj| ˆPi|ψ⟩⟨ψ| ˆPi|bj⟩,
(B.2)
which corresponds, comparably to Eq. (39), to either
• a L¨uders transformed measurement P
i ˆPi|bj⟩⟨bj| ˆPi in the state |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, or
• a measurement |bj⟩⟨bj| in the L¨uders transformed state P
i ˆPi|ψ⟩⟨ψ| ˆPi,
so, following the algebra, either we can say that a measurement of B after a measurement of A is not in general
the same as a measurement of B alone, or we can say that the measurement of A changed the state. We can say
either that both descriptions are equally acceptable, or we can insist that one or the other description is preferred for
speciﬁc contexts. The third way, suggested by Principle (JM), is to require all operators that are used to model joint
measurements to commute, so that the L¨uders transformer has no eﬀect on subsequent measurements.
