Preface
A booklet, Symbols and Abbreviations for use in Electrical and Electronic Engineering Courses, was published by the Institution of 
Electrical Engineers in 1968 and 1971. To take account of the many revisions and additions to British and International Standards 
since then, a new and fully revised edition was published in 1979, with reprints in 1980 and 1983.
In 1985, the editorial panel reconvened and undertook a total review and update of the Symbols and Abbreviations booklet, prior 
to it being re-issued under its new title in the professional brief series, in 1986. Further reviews of the contents were undertaken in 
1991 and 1996. Any comments on the present content, or suggestions for additional material, will be welcomed. Please address 
comments to the Secretary of the Institution.
The booklet is for use by students and staff in colleges and universities, as a reference for authors of papers and books on 
electrical and electronic engineering and related subjects, and as a guide for draughtsmen and designers in industry.
Appendix A lists the standards which have been used in the preparation of this Guide.

Introduction
In the expression I = 16 mA, I is the quantity symbol for the physical phenomenon of electric current, and 16 is its numerical 
value in terms of the decimal submultiple (10–3) of a unit (ampere) of current; mA is the unit symbol for milliampere. Other 
symbols (such as j, exp, Cu) are used to indicate mathematical operations, chemical elements etc. Frequently occurring technical 
phrases are commonly rendered as abbreviations (such as e.m.f., p.d.). In circuit diagrams, graphical symbols identify network 
components and devices.
International letter symbolism is based on the Roman and Greek alphabets. There are fewer than 90 distinctive capital and small 
letters to represent some thousands of scientific and technical quantities, and extensive duplication is unavoidable. Priority is 
given here to electrical, electronic and manufacturing engineering, and quantities in associated fields are, where necessary, 
assigned alternative or second-choice symbols.
The units and symbols listed throughout this booklet conform to the recommendations of the International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC) and the British Standards Institution (BSI). Additionally, because of their common usage, in the Logic Symbols 
under Section 12 some distinctive-shape binary logic symbols have been used.

1.	Abbreviations for Words & Phrases
Well known abbreviations, such as those listed below, are set in small roman (lower-case upright) letters, except for proper names, 
the unit system (SI), at the start of a sentence (e.g. A.C., not A.c.), and in titles and table headings where preferred:
Alternating current*
Direct current*
Electromotive force
Per unit
a.c
d.c.
e.m.f.
p.u.
Phase†
Potential difference	
Power factor 
Root mean square
ph.
p.d.
p.f.
r.m.s.
*Adjective only, as in a.c. motor, d.c. circuit.
†As in 3-ph. Supply
Ad hoc abbreviations (such as s.s.b. for single sideband) may be employed subject to an initial use in context of the full 
expression. Some acronyms (e.g. radar, laser) are used as nouns. The use of capital letters without full points for some 
abbreviations is common, particularly in the fields of logic, computers and microprocessors (see Commonly used abbreviations in 
optical, logical and microprocessor curcuits in Section 13).

2.	Printing Conventions
For clarity, in scientific and technical literature, different types of object are printed in different typefaces. The normal printing 
conventions are as follows:
Object

Note: the four styles of typeface are (using the letter A as an example):
Roman (or ‘upright’):
Italic (or ‘sloping’):
A
A
Roman boldface: 
Italic boldface:
A

*this typeface also applies to phasor physical quantities
Letter symbols, subscripts
Letter symbols should be used with consistency (e.g. only L for self-inductance, only P for power), but distinguishing subscripts 
can be attached (e.g. L1 and L2). Upper-case letters (e.g. V, I) are used for steady, mean and r.m.s values; lower-case letters for 
instantaneous values which vary with time (e.g. V, i). Maximum, minimum and average are indicated by subscripts (e.g. Vmax, Vmin, 
Vav).

3.	Unit Symbols
Unit symbols are printed in upright roman characters and are used after numerical values (e.g. 10 A, but ‘a few amperes’). 
They are the same in singular and plural, and are not followed by a full point except for normal punctuation, e.g. at the end of a 
sentence. A space is set between the number and its unit symbol (e.g. 230V, not 230V). The decimal multiples and submultiples 
given below are prefixed, without a space, to the unit symbols (e.g. 6.6 kV). Compound decimal prefixes should not be used (e.g. 
pF, not μμF).

Powers in steps of 3 are preferred, but some others have common usage (e.g. centimetre cm, decibel dB).
Compound symbols
In a compound unit symbol, multiplication is denoted by either a dot or a space (e.g. N•m, N m). The last form may also be 
written without a space, provided that special care is taken when the symbol for one of the units is the same as the symbol for a 
prefix, e.g. mN means millinewton, not metre newton. Unit division may be indicated by a solidus (e.g. V/m). Not more than one 
solidus should appear in a combination (e.g. 5 m/s2, not 5 m/s/s). In some cases parentheses or negative powers may be used for 
clarity (e.g. 1/s or s–1; J/(m s K) or J m–1 s–1 K–1).

4.	Numerical Values
Numbers should generally be printed in roman (upright) type. To facilitate the reading of numbers with many digits, these may be 
separated into suitable groups, preferably of three digits, counting from the decimal sign towards the left and the right; the groups 
should be separated by a small space, and never by a comma or a point, nor by any other means.
The decimal sign
The IEC and the BSI indicate that a comma on the line is the preferred decimal sign. In most British Standards, most UK 
literature, and all USA literature it is the practice to use a dot on the line as the decimal marker. In order to avoid confusion the IEE 
adopts the convention of English literature publications and uses a dot on the line as the decimal marker.
Multiplication of numbers
In the UK the preferred sign for the multiplication of numbers is a cross (X); if a dot is used as the decimal sign, the cross must 
be used. (A dot half-high may be used as the multiplication sign for numbers, but in this case a comma should be used as the 
decimal sign.)

5.	The International System of Units
The International System of Units (SI) establishes three kinds of units: base, supplementary, and derived, discussed in the 
following sub-sections under Section 5. In addition, various other units, listed under the sub-heading Non-SI Units, are recognised 
for continued use alongside SI units. Many obsolescent non-SI units are listed in Section 11, where conversion factors are given.
SI base units and supplementary units
There are seven base units and two supplementary units, as shown below:
Base quantity
Name of SI base unit
Unit symbol
length metre m
mass kilogram kg
time second s
electric current
thermodynamic temperature kelvin K
amount of substance mole mol
luminous intensity candela cd
metre
kilogram
second
ampere
kelvin
mole
candela
m
kg
s
A
K
mol
cd
plane angle radian rad
solid angle steradian sr
radian
steradian
rad
sr
The definitions of these units are as follows:


metre (m): the metre is the length of the path travelled in vacuum by light during (1/299 792 458) second.


kilogram (kg): the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram.


second (s): the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine 
levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.


ampere (A): that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible 
circular cross-section, and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 x 
10–7 newton per metre of length.


kelvin (K): the unit of thermodynamic temperature is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple 
point of water (but see footnote*).


candela (cd): the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source which emits monochromatic radiation with a frequency 
540 x 10l2 hertz and whose energy intensity in that direction is (1/683) watt per steradian.


mole (mol): the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 
kilogram of carbon 12. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified and may be atoms, molecules, ions, 
electrons, other particles, or specified groups of such particles.


radian (rad): the plane angle between two radii of a circle which cut off on the circumference an arc equal in length to the 
radius.


steradian (sr): the solid angle which, having its apex at the centre of a sphere, cuts off an area of the surface of the sphere 
equal to that of a square with sides of length equal to the radius of the sphere.
The supplementary units ‘radian’ and ‘steradian’ are to be regarded as dimensionless derived units which may be used or omitted 
in the expressions for derived units.
* In addition to the thermodynamic temperature (symbol T), expressed in kelvins, use is also made of Celsius temperature (symbol t) defined 
by the equation t = T-To where To = 273.15 K by definition. The unit ‘degree Celsius’ is equal to the unit ‘kelvin’, but ‘degree Celsius’ is a special 
name in place of ‘kelvin’ for expressing Celsius temperature. A temperature interval or a Celsius temperature difference can be expressed in 
degrees Celsius as well as kelvins, but kelvin is to be preferred.

8.	Subscripts and other uses of Letters and Numbers
It is recommended as a guiding principle for the printing of subscripts that, when these are symbols for physical quantities, they 
should be printed in italic type. Numbers as subscripts should be printed in roman type; mathematical variables (e.g. running 
subscripts) should be printed in italic type. All other subscripts should be printed in roman type.
Some commonly used abbreviations, often occurring as subscripts, are as follows:

Semiconductors
To the incremental hybrid (h), admittance (y) and impedance (z) parameters, double subscripts are applied in the order (1) 
function, (2) common electrode:
(1) i or 11 input; o or 22 output; f or 21 forward transfer; r or 12 reverse transfer.
(2) b base; c collector; d drain; e emitter; g gate; s source (e.g. hoe, y12b).
The upper-case variant of the subscript is used for static (d.c.) or large-signal values (e.g. hFE, h21F).
The real and imaginary parts of a device impedance are shown, respectively, by Re and j Im (e.g. hie = Re (hie) + j Im (hie)).
Upper-case letters are used for the representation of electrical parameters of external circuits and all inductances and 
capacitances. Except for L and C, lower-case letters are used for electrical parameters inherent in the device (e.g. re). In equivalent 
circuits using 3-terminal devices, a third letter may be used to indicate the condition at the third terminal (e.g. VCBO where IE = 0), 
while the first subscript indicates one terminal of the device and the second subscript the reference terminal or circuit node.

Special remark on logarithmic quantities and units
The expression for the time dependence of a damped harmonic oscillation can be written either in real notation or as the real part 
of a complex notation
F(t) = A e–∂t cos(ωt) = Re(A e–(∂+jω)t)
This simple relation involving ∂ and ω can be obtained only when e (base of natural logarithms) is used as the base of the 
exponential function. The coherent SI unit for the damping coefficient ∂ and the angular frequency ω is second to the power 
minus one, i.e. 1/s. Using the special names neper, Np, and radian, rad, for the units of ∂t and ωt respectively, the units for ∂ 
and ω become neper per second, Np/s, and radian per second, rad/s, respectively. Neper and radian are special names for the 
‘dimensionless’ unit one, 1. The neper is used as a unit for logarithmic quantities; the radian is used as a unit for plane
angles and for the phase of circular functions.

21
Corresponding variation in space is treated in the same manner
F(x) = A e–αx cos(βx) = Re(A e–γx), γ = α+ jβ
where the unit for α is neper per metre, Np/m, and the unit for β is radian per metre, rad/m.
In ISO 31, the level of a field quantity is therefore defined as the natural logarithm of a ratio of two amplitudes, LF = ln(F/F0), and is 
hence a quantity of dimension one. The unit neper (= the number 1) is the level of a field quantity when F/F0 = e.
Since power is often proportional to the square of an amplitude, a factor 1/2 is introduced in the definition of the level of a power 
quantity Lp = (1/2) ln(P/P0) in order to make the level of the power quantity under these circumstances equal to the level of the 
field quantity.
In practice the non-coherent unit degree, …°, (1° = π/180 rad) is often used for angles and the non-coherent unit bel, B, [1 B = 
(1/2) loge
10 Np ≈ 1.151 293 Np] is based on common logarithms (base 10) for logarithmic quantities. Instead of the bel, its sub-
multiple the decibel, dB, is commonly used.
Some numerical conversion factors are:

1 dB
1 Np
1 octave
1 decade
0.05 loge 10 Np (=0.115 129 Np)
20 log10 e dB (≈8.686 dB

log2 10 octave (≈3.321 octave)

14.	 Letter and Digit Code for R & C Values
For resistors, R, K, M, G and T are used as multipliers for 1, 103, 106, 109 and 1012, respectively, of resistance values expressed 
in ohms, whilst for capacitors, p, n, μ, m and F are used as multipliers for 10–12, 10–9, 10–6, 10–3 and 1, respectively, of the 
capacitance values expressed in farads.
