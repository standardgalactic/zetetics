Abstract
Given a globally hyperbolic spacetime M, we show the existence of a smooth
spacelike Cauchy hypersurface S and, thus, a global diﬀeomorphism between M
and R × S.

Introduction
In a classical article published in 1970, Geroch [10] proved the equivalence,
for a spacetime, between global hyperbolicity and the existence of a Cauchy
hypersurface S. As he stated clearly, the results were obtained at a topological
level. In fact, he proved the existence of a continuous time function t : M →R
such that each level t =constant is a (topological) Cauchy hypersurface and,
then, M is homeomorphic to R×S. The improvement of these topological results
in smooth diﬀerentiable ones is important not only as a typical mathematical
challenge but also from the theoretical viewpoint: Cauchy hypersurfaces are the
natural subsets where initial conditions to diﬀerential equations (as Einstein’s
equation) are posed. Moreover, any achronal hypersurface N can be seen as a
graph on a Cauchy hypersurface; this allows to study several properties which

involve the diﬀerentiable structure of N (as mean curvature), provided that the
splitting is smooth; see for example, [7].
In general, continuous maps between smooth manifolds can be approximated
by smooth maps. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that, with some eﬀort, one
could ﬁll the details to strengthen the topological results. Some authors have
claimed that function t (and, thus, the Cauchy hypersurface) can be smoothed
and, therefore, M is diﬀeomorphic to R × S; for example, see the end of the
proof of Proposition 6.6.8 in the very inﬂuential book by Hawking and Ellis [12]
(or the more recent book [22, p. 209]). In fact, this has been assumed in very
diﬀerent contexts where smoothness seems unavoidable (see, for example, [8],
[13, Chapter 8] or [21]).
Nevertheless, as far as we know, general smoothing procedures have resisted
the attempts of formalisation.
Budic and Sachs [4] proved C1-smoothing of
time functions for deterministic globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Then, Seifert
[19] claimed the existence of a general procedure for smoothing time functions.
But his proof is complicated and seems unclear; no cleaner version of this result
has been published since then. Later on, Dieckmann [6, 5] clariﬁes some points
in Geroch’s proof, but cites Seifert at the crucial point for smoothing (see [6,
proof of Theorem]). In general, in spite of these two references, most specialists
in pure Lorentzian Geometry do not aﬃrm that a smooth Cauchy hypersurface
must exist, even when the context could suggest it (say, expressions such as
“consider a globally hyperbolic spacetime with a smooth Cauchy hypersurface
S” are commonly used, when necessary). For example, among our references
clearly posterior to Seifert’s article, see [1, 2, 7, 9, 14, 16].
Summing up, Sachs and Wu [18, p. 1155] claimed in 1977:
...This is one of the folk theorems of the subject. It is not diﬃcult to
prove that every Cauchy surface is in fact a Lipschitzian hypersurface
in M [17]. However, to our knowledge, an elegant proof that his
Lipschitzian submanifold can be smoothed out to such an N above
is still missing.
This “folk question” is regarded as open in the ﬁrst edition of the classical book
by Beem and Ehrlich [1, p.
31], and remains open in the second edition of
1996, with Easley [2, p. 65]. As far as we know, no formalisation of the quoted
result has been obtained since then. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning
that some properties of volume functions (which appear in Geroch’s proof) have
been studied in [5] (see also [2, pp. 65–69]), and some smooth splitting results
in diﬀerent contexts have been obtained, see for example, [14], [2, Chapter 14].
The aim of the present article is to give a simple, self-contained and detailed
proof of the following result:
Theorem 1.1 Any globally hyperbolic spacetime admits a smooth spacelike Cauchy
hypersurface S0 and, then, it is diﬀeomorphic to R × S0.
This paper is organised as follows. Among the preliminaries in Section 2, we
state what can be asserted from Geroch’s splitting theorem, Lemma 2.2, Propo-
sition 2.5. In Section 3 some technical properties of Cauchy hypersurfaces are
2

proven. We do not try to give general properties here; plainly, we give direct
proofs to the results needed later, for the sake of clarity and completeness. We
prove, essentially (compare with [3], [9]): any closed spacelike hypersurface N
which lies in one side of a Cauchy hypersurface is achronal (Proposition 3.7)
and, thus, if it lies between two Cauchy hypersurfaces, then it is a Cauchy hy-
persurface too (Corollary 3.11). The necessity of the hypotheses is discussed
in Remarks 3.8, 3.10. In Section 4 we prove Theorem 1.1, according to the
following two steps. Fix two Cauchy hypersurfaces, one of them, S1, in the past
of the other one, S2. Roughly:
(1) For each point p ∈S2 a smooth function hp with compact support can be
constructed such that ∇hp is timelike (or 0) in the past of S2 (Lemma 4.12). This
function is constructed from the square of time-separation, which is either null
or a quadratic polinomial in normal coordinates and, thus, essentially smooth
(see formula (7)).
(2) By using technical properties related to paracompactness (Lemma 4.13),
a locally ﬁnite set of these functions can be summed in such a way that the sum,
h, restricted to J+(S1) ∩J−(S2), admits regular level hypersurfaces which are
spacelike and do not touch each Si (Proposition 4.14).

Preliminaries. Geroch’s result
We will follow usual conventions in Lorentzian Geometry as in [2], [10], [16],
[17], [18]. In particular, a spacetime M will be a connected n−manifold n ≥2
endowed with a time-oriented Lorentzian metric g. Diﬀerentiability Ck, k ∈
N∪{∞}, (N = {1, 2, . . .}), will be assumed for both the manifold and the metric,
and the term “smooth” will mean “Ck-diﬀerentiable”. Sometimes an auxiliary
complete Riemannian metric gR (with associated norm ∥· ∥R) will be needed.
Recall that the existence of a Riemannian metric on any paracompact manifold
(as those admitting a Lorentzian metric, see the discussion above Lemma 4.13)
is well-known; it can be chosen complete by using Whitney’s embedding theorem
(moreover, any Riemannian metric admits a conformal metric which is complete
[15]).
M is globally hyperbolic if it is strongly causal and J+(p)∩J−(q) is compact
for any p, q ∈M. In this case, it is not hard to prove that, for any two compact
subsets K1, K2 the set
K = J+(K1) ∩J−(K2)
(1)
is compact too. A hypersurface H in M is a embedded topological (n −1)-
submanifold without boundary.
H can be regarded as a subset of M and,
then, H will be closed if it is a closed subset of M. A spacelike hypersurface
is a embedded Cr-hypersurface (r ∈{1, . . .k}) such that its tangent space at
each point is spacelike.
A Cauchy hypersurface in M is a subset S that is
met exactly once by every inextendible timelike curve in M. Then, S will be a
closed achronal connected (topological) hypersurface and it is intersected by any
inextendible causal curve [16, Lemma 14.29] (the intersection may be a closed
geodesic segment instead a single point, if the curve is lightlike there).
3

The following result should be well-known (see for example, [10, p. 444,
Property 7], [16, Proposition 14.31]), even though we include its proof for the
sake of completeness and further referencing.
Lemma 2.2 Let M be a (Ck-)spacetime which admits a Cr-Cauchy hypersur-
face S, r ∈{0, 1, . . .k}. Then M is Cr-diﬀeomorphic to R × S and all the
Cr-Cauchy hypersurfaces are Cr diﬀeomorphic.
Proof: It is well-known that any spacetime admits a smooth timelike vector ﬁeld
T . Moreover, T can be assumed to be complete (otherwise, choose any auxiliary
complete Riemannian metric gR and take the complete vector ﬁeld T/ ∥T ∥R).
Let φ be the ﬂow of T and consider the map:
Φ : R × S →M
(s, x) →φs(x).
As S is a Cauchy hypersurface, then Φ is bijective and, by construction, Φ is a
Cr diﬀeomorphism (in the case r = 0, Φ is a homeomorphism -use the classical
Brouwer theorem on the invariance of the domain).
Let S′ be any other Cr-Cauchy hypersurface. Putting
Φ−1(z) = (s(z), ρ(z)),
(2)
it is clear that the map S′ →S, z →ρ(z) is a Cr-diﬀeomorphism.
Remark 2.3 We emphasize that, in this result, each hypersurface at constant
s is not necessarily a Cauchy hypersurface.
Geroch proved in [10] (see Section 5, Theorem 11, plus footnote 26):
Proposition 2.4 Assume that the spacetime M is globally hyperbolic. Then
there exists a continuous and onto map t : M →R satisfying:
(1) Sa := t−1(a) is a Cauchy hypersurface, for all a ∈R.
(2) t is strictly increasing on any causal curve.
In the proof of this result, t is obtained by a famous argument: essentially,
choose a measure on M with ﬁnite total volume and put
t(z) = ln
 vol(J−(z))/vol(J+(z))

(3)
(see also Theorem 3.26 in [2] as well as pp. 65–72, for a discussion about the
admissible measures `a la Dieckmann [5]). Then, as a consequence one has:
Proposition 2.5 Let M be a globally hyperbolic spacetime and S one of its
Cauchy hypersurfaces. Then there exist a homeomorphism
Ψ : M →R × S,
z →(t(z), ρ(z)),
(4)
which satisﬁes:
4

(a) Each level hypersurface St = {z ∈M : t(z) = t} is a Cauchy hypersur-
face.
(b) Let γx : R →M be the curve in M characterized by:
Ψ(γx(t)) = (t, x),
∀t ∈R.
Then the continuous curve γx is timelike in the following sense:
t < t′ ⇒γx(t) << γx(t′).
Sketch of proof.
Deﬁne t(z) as in (3).
By Proposition 2.4 S := t−1(0) is a
Cauchy hypersurface, and one only has to choose ρ from Φ−1 as in the proof of
Lemma 2.2.
Notice that, if function t were smooth, then the property (b) would imply di-
rectly that ∇t is everywhere causal. Even more, if γ were an integral curve
of ∇t and γ′(t0) were lightlike, γ′ could not be lightlike on some open interval
containing t0 (as t is taken from Proposition 2.4, its item (2) holds).
Notice that Lemma 2.2 and Proposition 2.5 give two types of topological
splittings Φ, Ψ for M, being the curve s →(s, x) timelike and smooth for Φ,
and the hypersurface t =constant a Cauchy hypersurface for Ψ. In what follows,
the properties of the Cauchy hypersurfaces of a globally hyperbolic spacetime
M will be studied. Then, we will assume that a topological splitting either as
in Lemma 2.2 or as in Proposition 2.5 is ﬁxed, and we will drop Φ, Ψ writting
simply M = R × S.

Some properties of Cauchy hypersurfaces
First, recall the following technical result.
Lemma 3.6 Let M be a spacetime and N a closed connected spacelike hyper-
surface.
(1) A closed curve that meets N exactly once and then transversally is not
freely homotopic to a closed curve that does not meet N.
(2) If N separates M (i.e., M\N is not connected) then N is achronal.
Assertion (1) comes from intersection theory; it is a particular case of, for ex-
ample, [11, Sect. 2.4, Theorem in p. 78]. The proof of (2) can be seen in [16,
Lemma 14.45(2)].
Proposition 3.7 Let M be a spacetime which admits a Cauchy hypersurface
S. Then any closed connected spacelike hypersurface N which does not intersect
S is achronal.
Proof: By Lemma 3.6(2) it is enough to show that N separates M. Otherwise,
reasoning by contradiction, recall that there exists a closed curve γ : [−1, 1] →
M which intersects N exactly once and, then, transversally. In fact, it is enough
5

to take γ on some closed interval [−ǫ, ǫ], ǫ > 0 transversal to N. Then, use that
M\N is open and connected (thus, connected by arcs) to join γ(−ǫ) and γ(ǫ).
Consider the functions Φ and ρ : M →S in the proof of Lemma 2.2. In
order to obtain a contradiction with Lemma 3.6(1), it is enough to prove that
γ and ρ ◦γ are freely homotopic.
As the homeomorphism Φ is constructed
from the ﬂow φ of vector ﬁeld T , there exists a continuous function µ such that
ρ ◦γ(t) = φµ(t)(γ(t)) for all t ∈[−1, 1]. Then
H(s, t) = φsµ(t)(γ(t))
∀(s, t) ∈[0, 1] × [−1, 1]
is the required free homotopy.
Remark 3.8 Neither the hypothesis “closed” nor the hypothesis on the inter-
section (N ∩S = ∅) can be dropped, as one can check easily. In fact, consider a
cylinder R×S1 (S1 = R/2πZ), endowed with the Lorentzian metric −dt2 +dθ2,
which admits the Cauchy hypersurface S = {−1}×S1. For positive slope c < 1,
the curve t(θ) = c θ corresponds with a helix H, which is a non-achronal com-
plete spacelike closed hypersurface and crosses S. If the constant c is replaced
by a function c(θ) with 0 < ˙c(θ)θ + c(θ) < 1 and limx→±∞c(θ) = ±1 then the
corresponding helix H′ does not crosses S (in fact, it lies strictly between two
Cauchy hypersurfaces). But H′ fails to be closed and is neither achronal.
Recall that, as N is achronal, then it can be seen as a graph on an open subset
of the Cauchy hypersurface. In order to assume that this graph is deﬁned on
all the hypersurface, the following result gives a suﬃcient condition.
Proposition 3.9 Let M be a globally hyperbolic spacetime and S1, S2 be two
disjoint Cauchy hypersurfaces, with S1 ⊂J−(S2), that is, U = I+(S1) ∩
I−(S2) ̸= ∅. Consider the topological splitting M = R × S1 in Lemma 2.2.
Then, any closed connected spacelike hypersurface S ⊂U = I+(S1)∩I−(S2)
is a graph on all S1, i.e.: there exist a continuous function λ : S1 →(0, ∞) such
that S = {(λ(x), x) : x ∈S1}.
Proof: First, let us see that the Cauchy hypersurface S2 is a graph too. Consider
the canonical projections
ρ : R × S1 →S1 ,
πR : R × S1 →R,
where we have written ρ ≡πS1 consistently with (2). By the construction of
the topological splitting Φ in Lemma 2.2 from the (timelike) integral curves of
T , it is clear that ρ|S2 : S2 →S1 is continuous and injective. Interchanging the
roles of S1 and S2, ρ|S2 is a homeomorphism and S2 is a graph:
S2 = {(ρ|S2)−1(x) : x ∈S1} = {(λ2(x), x) : x ∈S1},
where λ2(x) = πR ◦(ρ|S2)−1(x) for all x ∈S1.
For the hypersurface S, as it is achronal (Proposition 3.7), the restriction
ρ|S : S →S1 is continuous and injective.
Thus, from the theorem of the
6

invariance of the domain, ρ|S yields a homeomorphism between S and an open
subset U1 := ρ(S) ⊆S1. Therefore, S is a graph on U1:
S = {(ρ|S)−1(x) : x ∈U1} = {(λ(x), x) : x ∈U1},
for some continuous function λ on U1. We only must prove that U1 is closed
in S1. Previously, recall that, from the construction of the topological splitting
R × S1 and the inclusion S ⊂I+(S1) ∩I−(S2):
x << (λ(x), x) << (λ2(x), x),
∀x ∈U1.
(5)
Now, let {xn}n be a sequence in U1 ⊂S1 which converges to a point x0 in
the closure of U1. In order to prove that x0 ∈U1, let
K1 = {xn : n ∈N} ∪{x0} ⊂S1,
K2 = {(λ2(xn), xn) : n ∈N} ∪{(λ2(x0), x0)} ⊂S2.
and deﬁne K = J+(K1) ∩J−(K2), which is compact (see (1)). From (5), K
contains the sequence
{(λ(xn), xn) : n ∈N} ⊂S.
(6)
As S is closed, this sequence is contained in the compact subset KS = K ∩S.
Thus, it converges, up to a subsequence, to a point (λ′
0, x′
0) of S. But
x′
0 = π(λ′
0, x′
0) = π(lim
n (λ(xn), xn)) = lim
n xn = x0.
That is, x0 = x′
0 ∈π(S) = U1, as required.
Remark 3.10 Even though, by Proposition 3.7, only one of the inclusions S ⊂
I+(S1) or S ⊂I−(S2) is enough to ensure the achronality of S, both inclusions
are needed for Proposition 3.9. The reason relies in the central role of inequality
(5), and it is not diﬃcult to obtain a counterexample if one of them is removed.
In fact, consider on R2 the warped metric g = −dt2 + f(t)2dx2 with f > 0 and
∂t future-directed. Each hypersurface t =constant is a Cauchy hypersurface,
because the spacetime is conformal to (I ×R, g∗= −ds2 +dx2), where I is some
interval of R and ds = dt/f. Now, the graph S of a smooth curve x →t(x) is
a spacelike hypersurface if and only if |dt/dx| < f(t(x)). But f can grow fast
enough in such a way that the inextendible domain of t(x) is a ﬁnite interval,
and S will be closed but not a graph on all S1.
As a concrete example, consider f(t) = cosh t for all t (the spacetime is
then isometric to the universal covering of 2-dimensional de Sitter spacetime),
choose S1 as the hypersurface t ≡−1 and put t(x) = tg2(x/4), which satisﬁes
the required inequality |dt/dx| =
√
t(1 + t)(x)/2 < f(t(x)). Recall that the
hypersurface S = {(tg2(x/4), x) : x ∈(−2π, 2π)}, which lies in I+(S1), is not
only closed but also complete (the g-length of the graph (t(x), x) restricted to
both x ∈(−2π, 0) and x ∈(0, 2π) is inﬁnity). Finally, notice that this example
can be easily modiﬁed to make S1 compact (take the quotient cylinder generated
from the isometry (t, x) →(t, x + 4π)).
7

Thus, as a straightforward consequence we obtain the following result (an al-
ternative proof can be found in [9, Corollary 2]):
Corollary 3.11 Let S1 and S2 be two disjoint Cauchy hypersurfaces of M with
S1 ⊂I−(S2). Then:
Any closed connected spacelike hypersurface S contained in U = I+(S1) ∩
I−(S2) is a Cauchy hypersurface.
Proof: From Lemma 3.7, S is achronal, and we only must check that each
inextendible timelike curve γ crosses it. As S is a graph on S1, it separates
R × S1 in two disjoint open subsets: W −= {(t, x) : t < λ(x)}, which includes
S1, and W + = {(t, x) : t > λ(x)}, which includes S2. As γ crosses the Cauchy
surfaces S1 and S2, it will cross S too.
4
Smooth Cauchy hypersurfaces
In what follows we will use convex open subsets of M. Recall that an open set is
called convex if it is a (starshaped) normal neighborhood of all its points; every
point p ∈M has a convex neighborhood Cp (Cp can be also chosen simple in the
terminology of [17], [5], i.e. convex with compact closure included in a bigger
convex set); some properties of this sets in relation to causality can be seen in
[16, 14.2]. When a convex set C is regarded as a spacetime, the time–separation
or Lorentzian distance on C has especially good properties. In particular, it
is not only continuous but also smooth whenever it does not vanish (see, for
example, [16, Lemmas 5.9 and 14.2(1)]).
Lemma 4.12 Let M be a globally hyperbolic spacetime with a topological split-
ting R × S as in Proposition 2.5. Let t1 < t2 and denote the corresponding
Cauchy hypersurfaces St1 ≡S1, St2 ≡S2. Fix p ∈S2, and a convex neighbor-
hood of p, Cp ⊂I+(S1).
Then there exists a smooth function
hp : M →[0, ∞)
which satisﬁes:
(i) hp(p) = 1.
(ii) The support of hp (i.e., the closure of h−1
p (0, ∞)) is compact and included
in Cp ∩I+(S1).
(iii) If q ∈J−(S2) and hp(q) ̸= 0 then ∇hp(q) is timelike and past-pointing.
Proof: Choose p′ ∈I−(p) ∩I+(S1) such that J+(p′) ∩J−(S2) ⊂Cp and deﬁne
hp on I−(S2) as the Ck function:
hp(q) =
 τ(p′, p)−2k · τ(p′, q)2k
if k < ∞
eτ(p′,p)−2 · e−τ(p′,q)−2
if k = ∞
(7)
where τ is the time-separation on Cp regarded as a spacetime (hp is regarded as 0
on I−(S2)\Cp). Now, construct any Ck extension of hp out of I−(S2) such that
8

the support of hp is included in Cp and hp ≥0.1 Obviously, conditions (i) and
(ii) are fulﬁlled and, in order to check (iii), take into account that the gradient of
−τ(p′, ·)2/2 at q is the velocity of the unique (timelike, future-pointing) geodesic
σ : [0, 1] →Cp from p′ to q.
Recall that the existence of a Lorentzian metric on M implies its paracompact-
ness, i.e., for any open covering W of M there exists a locally ﬁnite reﬁnement
[20, Vol II, Addendum 1]. We will need a technical property related to para-
compactness. Essentially, take any complete distance dR on M compatible with
its topology, and assume that there exist a dR-bound of the diameter of the
elements of the covering W. Then there exist a locally ﬁnite subcovering W′
of W. More technically, we will need:
Lemma 4.13 Let dR be the distance on M associated to any auxiliary complete
Riemannian metric gR. Let S be a closed subset of M and W = {Wα, α ∈I}
a collection of open subsets of M which cover S.
Assume that each Wα is
included in an open subset Cα and the dR-diameter of each Cα is smaller than
1. Then there exist a subcollection W′ = {Wj : j ∈N} ⊂W which covers S
and is locally ﬁnite (i.e., for each p ∈∪jWj there exists a neighborhood V such
that V ∩Wj = ∅for all j but a ﬁnite set of indexes). Moreover, the collection
{Cj : j ∈N} (where each Wj ∈W′ is included in the corresponding Cj) is locally
ﬁnite too.
Proof: Fix p ∈M and consider the open and closed balls, resp., Bp(r), ¯Bp(r) of
center p and radius r > 0 for the distance dR. As each closed ball is compact,
the following subsets are compact too:
Km = ¯Bp(m)\Bp(m −1),
(M ⊂∪mKm).
Sm = Km ∩S,
(S ⊂∪mSm),
for all m ∈N. From the compactness of Sm, a ﬁnite subset {W1m, . . . Wkmm} ⊂
W covers Sm. Then, take:
W′ = {Wkm : m ∈N, k = 1, . . . km}.
Clearly, W′ covers S, and W′ (as well as the corresponding collection of the
Cj’s) is locally ﬁnite because, if |m −m′| ≥3, then Wkm ∩Wk′m′ = ∅(use the
deﬁnition of the K′
ms, Sm’s and the inequality diam Wα < 1, for all α).
Proposition 4.14 Let M be a globally hyperbolic spacetime with topological
splitting R × S and ﬁx t1 < t2, Si, as in Lemma 4.12.
1This extension can be easily carried out because the support of hp on J−(S2) lies in the
compact subset K = J+(p′) ∩J−(S2) ⊂Cp. Fix an open neighbourhood U of K included
in Cp, consider the covering (U, Cp\K) of Cp, and take the subordinate partition of the unity
{µ, µ′} with support(µ) ⊂U . Then, hp can be chosen on all Cp as the expression in (7)
multiplied by µ.

Then there exists a smooth function
h : M →[0, ∞)
which satisﬁes:
1.
h(t, x) = 0 if t ≤t1.
2.
h(t, x) > 1/2 if t = t2.
3.
The gradient of h is timelike and past-pointing on the open subset V =
h−1((0, 1/2)) ∩I−(S2).
As a consequence, Sh
s = h−1(s) ∩J−(S2) is a closed smooth spacelike hypersur-
face which lies in I+(S1) ∩I−(S2), for each s ∈(0, 1/2).
Proof: Fixed a complete auxiliary distance dR as in Lemma 4.13, take, for
any p ∈S2, a convex neighborhood Cp with diameter smaller than 1 and the
corresponding function hp as in Lemma 4.12. Let Wp = h−1
p
((1/2, ∞)) (Wp ⊂
Cp). Obviously,
W = {Wp, p ∈S2}
covers the closed hypersurface S2 and lies in the hypothesis of Lemma 4.13. Now,
if W′ = {Wi; i ∈N} is the locally ﬁnite subcovering given by this lemma, and
for each Wi(≡Wpi), hi is the corresponding function with support Ci (Wi ⊂Ci),
we put:
h =
X
i
hi,
which is well-deﬁned and smooth because of the local ﬁniteness of the supports
of the hi ’s. Clearly, h satisﬁes the items 1, 3 because each hi satisﬁes them,
and item 2 is satisﬁed because each hi(p) > 1/2 for any p ∈Wi, and S2 ⊂∪iWi.
To prove the last assertion, notice that, by item 3, any s ∈(0, 1/2) is a regular
value of the restriction of h to I−(S2); thus, Sh
s is a spacelike hypersurface, and
it is also closed in I−(S2). Nevertheless, the closure of I−(S2) is S2 and, by
item 2, no frontier point of I−(S2) can be a frontier point of Sh
s . Thus, Sh
s is
closed in M, as required.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. To obtain the smooth hypersurface, apply Corollary 3.11
to any hypersurface Sh
s yielded by Proposition 4.14. For the diﬀeomorphism,
use Lemma 2.2.
