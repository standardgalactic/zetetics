Preface
The publication of the 19th edition of Nelson Textbook of Pedi-
atrics combines an important synthesis of clinical pediatrics with 
the major advances in genomics, diagnosis, imaging, and thera-
peutics. The 19th edition continues to represent the “state of the 
art” on the care of the normal and ill neonate, child, or adolescent 
by presenting both evidence-based medicine and astute clinical 
experiences from leading international authors.
The promise that translational medicine will improve the lives 
of all children is greater than ever. Knowledge of human develop-
ment, behavior, and diseases from the molecular to sociologic 
levels is increasing at fantastic rates. This has led to greater 
understanding of health and illness in children, as well as to 
substantial improvements in health quality for those who have 
access to health care. These exciting scientific advances also 
provide hope to effectively address new and emerging diseases 
threatening children and their families.
Unfortunately, many children throughout the world have not 
benefited from the significant advances in the prevention and 
treatment of health-related problems, primarily because of a lack 
of political will and misplaced priorities. Additionally, many chil-
dren are at substantial risk from the adverse effects of poverty, 
war, and bioterrorism. In order for our increasing knowledge to 
benefit all children and youth, medical advances and good clinical 
practice must always be coupled with effective advocacy.
This new edition of Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics attempts 
to provide the essential information that practitioners, house 
staff, medical students, and other care providers involved in 
pediatric health care throughout the world need to understand 
to effectively address the enormous range of biologic, psycho-
logic, and social problems that our children and youth may face. 
Our goal is to be comprehensive yet concise and reader friendly, 
embracing both the new advances in science as well as the time-
honored art of pediatric practice.
The 19th edition is reorganized and revised from the previous 
edition. There are the additions of new diseases and new chap-
ters, as well as substantial expansion or significant modification 
of others. In addition, many more tables, photographs, imaging 
studies, and illustrative figures, as well as up-to-date references, 
have been added. Every subject has been scrutinized for updating 
and improvement in its exposition and usefulness to pediatric 
health care providers. Although to an ill child and his or her 
family and physician, even the rarest disorder is of central impor-
tance, all health problems cannot possibly be covered with the 
same degree of detail in one general textbook of pediatrics. Thus, 
leading articles and subspecialty texts are referenced and should 
be consulted when more information is desired. In addition, to 
include as much information as possible and to take advantage 
of advances in providing background, pathophysiology, and lit-
erature citations, we have placed even more material on the 
website accompanying the printed text. This permits an unlimited 
ability to provide more detailed and updated information through 
our associated electronic media. Text vital to the care of children 
remains printed, but additional material will be provided to the 
reader at www.expertconsult.com, including links to Gold Stan-
dard’s premier online formulary for the most current information 
available on drugs and dosing.
The outstanding value of the 19th edition of the textbook is 
due to its expert and authoritative contributors. We are all 
indebted to these dedicated authors for their hard work, knowl-
edge, thoughtfulness, and good judgment. Our sincere apprecia-
tion also goes to Judy Fletcher and Jennifer Shreiner at Elsevier 
and to Carolyn Redman at the Pediatric Department of the 
Medical College of Wisconsin. We have all worked hard to 
produce an edition that will be helpful to those who provide care 
for children and youth and to those desiring to know more about 
children’s health worldwide.
In this edition we have had informal assistance from many 
faculty and house staff of the departments of pediatrics at the 
Medical College of Wisconsin, Wayne State University School of 
Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, and University 
of Rochester School of Medicine. The help of these individuals 
and of the many practicing pediatricians from around the world 
who have taken the time to offer thoughtful feedback and sug-
gestions is always greatly appreciated and helpful.
Last and certainly not least, we especially wish to thank our 
families for their patience and understanding without which this 
textbook would not have been possible.

Chapter 1
Overview of Pediatrics
Bonita F. Stanton and Richard E. Behrman
PART I  The Field of Pediatrics
Children are the world’s most important resource. Pediatrics is 
the sole discipline concerned with all aspects of the well-being of 
infants, children, and adolescents, including their health; their 
physical, mental, and psychologic growth and development; and 
their opportunity to achieve full potential as adults. Pediatricians 
must be concerned not only with particular organ systems and 
biologic processes, but also with environmental and social influ-
ences, which have a major impact on the physical, emotional, and 
mental health and social well-being of children and their 
families.
Pediatricians must be advocates for the individual child and 
for all children, irrespective of culture, religion, gender, race, or 
ethnicity or of local, state, or national boundaries. Children 
cannot advocate for themselves. The more politically, economi-
cally, or socially disenfranchised a population or a nation is, the 
greater the need for advocacy for children by the profession 
whose entire purpose is to advance the well-being of children. 
The young are often among the most vulnerable or disadvantaged 
in society and, thus, their needs require special attention. As 
divides between nations blur through advanced transportation 
and communication, through globalization of the economy, and 
through modern means of warfare and as the categorization of 
countries into “developed” or “industrialized” and “developing” 
or “low income” break down due to uneven advances within and 
across countries, a global perspective for the field of pediatrics 
becomes both a reality and a necessity.
The world population is growing at the rate of 1.14%/yr, with 
that of the USA growing at 0.88%/yr. Worldwide children younger 
than age 15 yr account for 1.8 billion (28%) of the world’s 6.4 
billion persons; in the USA, children younger than age 18 yr 
constitute approximately one quarter of the population.
In 2006, there were an estimated 133 million births world-
wide, 124 million (92%) of which were in developing countries 
and 4.3 million (3%) of which were in the USA.
Scope and History of Pediatrics and Vital Statistics
More than a century ago, pediatrics emerged as a medical spe-
cialty in response to increasing awareness that the health prob-
lems of children differ from those of adults and that a child’s 
response to illness and stress varies with age. In 1959, the United 
Nations issued the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, articu-
lating the universal presumption that children everywhere have 
fundamental needs and rights. Virtually all nations have practic-
ing pediatricians and most medical schools across the globe have 
departments of pediatrics or child health.
The health problems of children and youth vary widely 
between and within populations in the nations of the world 
depending on a number of often interrelated factors. These 
factors include (1) economic considerations (economic dispari-
ties); (2) educational, social, and cultural considerations; (3) the 
prevalence and ecology of infectious agents and their hosts; (4) 
climate and geography; (5) agricultural resources and practices 
(nutritional resources); (6) stage of industrialization and urban-
ization; (7) the gene frequencies for some disorders; and (8) the 
health and social welfare infrastructure available within these 
countries. Health problems are not restricted to single nations 
and are not limited by country boundaries; the interrelation of 
health issues across the globe has achieved widespread recogni-
tion in the wake of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) 
and AIDS epidemics, expansions in the pandemics of cholera and 
West Nile virus, war and bioterrorism, the tsunami of 2004, and 
the global recession beginning in 2008.
Reducing Child Mortality
Despite global interconnectedness, child health priorities con-
tinue to reflect local politics, resources, and needs. The state of 
health of any community must be defined by the incidence of 
illness and by data from studies that show the changes that occur 
with time and in response to programs of prevention, case finding, 
therapy, and surveillance. To ensure that the needs of children 
and adults across the globe were not obscured by local needs, in 
2000 the international community established 8 Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) to be achieved by 2015 
(www.countdown2015mnch.org). Although all 8 MDGs impact 
child well-being, MDG 4 (“Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 
and 2015, the under-five mortality rate”) is exclusively focused 
on children. Globally, there has been a 23% reduction in under-5 
mortality since 1990 (from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 live births), 
with a 40% reduction in developed countries (10 to 6) but only 
a 21% reduction in the least developed countries (180 to 142). 
In 62 countries progress was inadequate to meet the goals and 
27 countries (including most of those in sub-Saharan Africa) 
made no progress or declined between 1990 and 2006. There 
were nearly 13 million under-5 deaths in 1990; 2006 marked the 
1st year that there were fewer than 10 million deaths (9.7 million) 
with a further decrease to 9.0 million in 2007 and 8.8 million in 
2008. However, overall progress has not been on target to reach 
the goal (Fig. 1-1).
In the late 19th century in the USA, 200 of every 1,000 chil-
dren born alive died before the age of 1 yr of conditions such as 
diarrhea, pneumonia, measles, diphtheria, and whooping cough. 
In developing countries today, the leading causes of death remains 
diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and measles with much of the 
reductions in mortality that have occurred resulting from effective 
vaccine programs, oral rehydration therapy, early diagnosis and 
treatment of pneumonia, and, treated mosquito nets.
Neonatal (<1 mo) death contributes substantially to the 
under-5 mortality rate, growing in proportion as the under-5 
death rate decreases. Globally, the neonatal mortality rate of 28 
per 1,000 live births represents 62% of the infant mortality rate 
of 45 per 1,000 live births and 43% of the under-5 death rate of 
72. The proportion of neonatal deaths in industrialized countries 
is higher (60% of infant deaths and 50% of under-5 mortality) 
than in the least developed countries (49% of infant deaths and 
31% of under-5 deaths). In populations with the highest child 
mortality rates, however, just over 20% of all child deaths occurred 
in the neonatal period, but in countries with mortality rates 
<35/1,000 live births, >50% of child deaths were in neonates.
Across the globe, there are significant variations in infant 
mortality rates by nation, by region, by economic status, and by 
level of industrial development, the categorizations employed by 
the World Bank and the United Nations (Table 1-1). Most of the 
decline in infant mortality in the USA and other industrialized 
countries since 1970 is attributable to a decrease in the 
birthweight-specific infant mortality rate related to neonatal 
intensive care, not to the prevention of low-birthweight births

(Chapter 87). The majority of deaths of infants younger than 1 yr 
of age occur in the 1st 28 days of life, most of these in the 1st 7 
days; moreover, a large proportion of the deaths in the 1st 7 days 
occur on the 1st day. An increasing number of severely ill infants 
born at very low birthweight survive the neonatal period, however, 
and die later in infancy of neonatal disease, its sequelae, or its 
complications (Tables 1-2 through 1-4).
Causes of death vary by developmental status of the nation. 
In the USA, the 3 leading causes of death among infants were 
congenital anomalies, disorders related to gestation and low 
birthweight, and sudden infant death (Table 1-5). By contrast, in 
developing countries, the majority of infant deaths result from 
infectious diseases; even in the neonatal period, 24% of deaths 
are caused by severe infections and 7% by tetanus. In developing 
countries, 29% of neonatal deaths are due to birth asphyxia and 
24% due to complications of prematurity.
In the majority of countries, the most robust predictor of 
infant mortality is a poor level of maternal education (and  
therefore another of the MDG addresses the need for universal 
access to primary schooling for girls). Other maternal risk char-
acteristics, such as unmarried status, adolescence, and high parity,  
correlate with increased risk of postneonatal mortality and mor-
bidity and low birthweight.
Health Among Postinfancy Children
A profound improvement in child health within industrialized 
nations occurred in the 20th century with the introduction of 
antibacterial disinfectants, antibiotic agents, and vaccines. Efforts 
to control infectious diseases were complemented by better 
understanding of nutrition. In the USA, Canada, and parts of 
Europe, new and continuing discoveries in these areas led to 
establishment of public well child clinics for low-income families. 
Although the timing of control of infectious disease was uneven 
around the globe, this focus on control was accompanied by 
significant decreases in morbidity and mortality in all countries. 
The smallpox eradication program of the 1970s resulted in the 
global eradication of smallpox in 1977. The introduction in the 
1970s of the Expanded Program of Immunizations (universal 
vaccination against polio, diphtheria, measles, tuberculosis, 
tetanus, and pertussis) by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has resulted in 
an estimated annual reduction of 1 to 2 million deaths per year 
globally. Recognizing the importance of prevention of infectious 
diseases to the health of children, several countries among the 50 
currently ranked by the World Bank as among the poorest nations 
(per capita income <$750/yr) have invested heavily in infectious 
disease control through the development of internal vaccine pro-
duction capability. As diarrheal diseases continued through the 
mid-1970s to account for ≈25% of infant and childhood deaths 
in the nonindustrialized countries (∼4 million deaths per year at 
that time), attention turned to the development and utilization of 
oral resuscitation fluids to sustain children through potentially 
life-threatening episodes of acute diarrheal diseases. Oral rehy-
dration solutions are largely credited with the current reduction 
of diarrheal deaths annually to 1.5 million.
In the later 20th century, with improved control of infectious 
diseases (including the elimination of polio in the Western hemi-
sphere) through both prevention and treatment, pediatric medi-
cine in industrialized nations increasingly turned its attention to a 
broad spectrum of conditions. These included both potentially 
lethal conditions and temporarily or permanently handicapping 
conditions; among these disorders were leukemia, cystic fibrosis, 
diseases of the newborn infant, congenital heart disease, mental 
retardation, genetic defects, rheumatic diseases, renal diseases, and 
metabolic and endocrine disorders. Thus, in industrialized nations, 
the end of the 20th century and 1st decade of the 21st century have 
been marked by accelerated understanding of new approaches to 
the management of many disorders as a consequence of advances 
in molecular biology, genetics, and immunology.
Increasing attention has also been given to behavioral and 
social aspects of child health, ranging from re-examination of 
child-rearing practices to creation of major programs aimed at 
prevention and management of abuse and neglect of infants and 
children. Developmental psychologists, child psychiatrists, neuro­
scientists, sociologists, anthropologists, ethnologists, and others 
have brought us new insights into human potential, including 
new views of the importance of the environmental circumstances 
during pregnancy, surrounding birth, and in the early years of 
child rearing. The later 20th century witnessed the beginning of 
nearly universal acceptance by pediatric professional societies  
of attention to normal development, child rearing, and psycho-
social disorders across the continents. In the last decade, irrespec-
tive of level of industrialization, nations have developed programs 
addressing not only causes of mortality and physical morbidity 
(such as infectious diseases and protein-calorie malnutrition), but 
also factors leading to decreased cognition and thwarted psycho-
social development, including punitive child-rearing practices,

child labor, undernutrition, war, and poor schooling. Obesity is 
recognized as a major health risk not only in industrialized 
nations, but increasingly in transitional countries. Progress at the 
turn of the 21st century in unraveling the human genome offers 
for the 1st time the realization that significant genetic screening, 
individualized pharmacotherapy, and genetic manipulation will 
be a part of routine pediatric treatment and prevention practices 
in the future. The prevention implications of the genome project 
give rise to the possibility of reducing costs for the care of illness 
but also increase concerns about privacy issues (Chapter 3).
Although local famines and disasters, and regional and 
national wars have periodically disrupted the general trend for 
global improvement in child health indices, it was not until the 
advent of the AIDS epidemic in the later 20th century that the 
1st substantial global erosion of progress in child health out-
comes occurred. This erosion has resulted in ever-widening gaps 
between childhood health indices in sub-Saharan Africa com-
pared to the rest of the world. From 1990 to 2002, life expec-
tancy in sub-Saharan Africa decreased from 50 yr to 46 yr; 
although, as of 2008, it had returned to 52 yrs. Increasing rates 
of tuberculosis and continued problems with pandemics such as 
cholera further challenge many of these nations. Strains of drug-
resistant malaria are also a major concern in isolated areas 
around the world, but 90% of malarial deaths (the majority 
among children) are occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Diseases 
once confined to limited geographic niches, including West Nile 
virus, and diseases previously uncommon among humans, such 
as the avian flu virus, increased awareness of the interconnected-
ness of health around the world. Formerly perceived as a problem 
of industrialized nations, motor vehicle crashes are now a major 
cause of mortality in developing countries as well.
Enormous disparities exist in childhood mortality rates across 
the globe (see Table 1-1). Among the ∼8.7 million childhood 
deaths occurring worldwide, ≈50% occur in sub-Saharan Africa, 
home to <10% of the world’s population. Fifty percent of the 
world’s childhood deaths are occurring in 6 nations; 90% of 
childhood deaths are occurring in only 42 of the world’s 192 
nations. In 2008, the USA had an under-5 mortality rate of 
8/1,000 live births. Forty-two nations had under-5 mortality rates

lower than that of the USA, with Singapore, Finland, Luxem-
bourg, Iceland, and Sweden having the lowest rates at 3/1,000. 
The comparable child mortality rate in sub-Saharan Africa was 
144/1,000 live births. As of 2008, Afghanistan has the highest 
under-5 mortality rate of 257/1,000 live births, followed by 
Angola at 220/1,000 live births and Chad at 209/1,000 live 
births. In 1990 Afghanistan and Angola had an under-5 mortality 
rate of 260/1,000 live births, showing minimal improvement over 
2 decades. Causes of under-5 mortality differ markedly between 
developed and developing nations. In developing countries, 66% 
of all deaths resulted from infectious and parasitic diseases. 
Among the 42 countries having 90% of childhood deaths, diar-
rheal disease accounted for 22% of deaths, pneumonia 21%, 
malaria 9%, AIDS 3%, and measles 1%. Neonatal causes con-
tributed to 33%. The contribution for AIDS varies greatly by 
country, being responsible for a substantial proportion of deaths 
in some countries and negligible amounts in others. Likewise, 
there is substantial co-occurrence of infections; a child may die 
with HIV, malaria, measles, and pneumonia. Infectious diseases 
are still responsible for much of the mortality in developing 
countries. In the USA, pneumonia (and influenza) accounted for 
only 2% of under-5 deaths, with only negligible contributions 
from diarrhea and malaria. Unintentional injury is the most 
common cause of death among U.S. children ages 1-5 yr, account-
ing for about 33% of deaths, followed by congenital anomalies 
(11%), malignant neoplasms (8%), and homicides (7%). Other 
causes accounted for <5% of total mortality within this age group 
(see Table 1-5). Although unintentional injuries in developing 
countries are proportionately less important causes of mortality 
than in developed countries, their absolute rates and their con-
tributions to morbidity are substantially greater.
Morbidities Among Children
It is important to examine morbidities as well as mortality. Ade-
quately addressing special health care needs is important in all 
countries both to minimize loss of life and to maximize the 
potential of each individual.
In the USA, ≈70% of all pediatric hospital bed days are for 
chronic illnesses; 80% of pediatric health expenditures are for 
20% of children. In 2006, about 13.9% of U.S. children were 
reported to have special health care needs; 21.8 percent of house-
holds with children had ≥1 child with a special health care need 
(Chapter 39). Significantly more poor children and minority chil-
dren have special health care needs. Although there are multiple 
chronic conditions and the prevalence of these disorders vary by 
population, 2 of these morbidities—obesity and asthma—have a 
substantial and increasing presence worldwide and are associated 
with substantial health consequences and costs. In the USA, 
∼25% of children and adolescents are overweight, representing a 
2.3- to 3.3-fold increase over the past 25 yr. Similar rates have 
been reported from Australia and multiple countries in Europe, 
Egypt, Chile, Peru, and Mexico (Chapter 44).
Also increasing in prevalence among industrialized nations 
and in middle- and low-income nations with substantial urban-
ization are rates of asthma. In the mid-1990s, the USA reported 
an annual prevalence rate of wheezing of 57.8/1,000 among 
children ages 0-4 yr and 74.4/1,000 among youth ages 5-15 yr, 
approximately 2-fold higher than comparable prevalence rates in 
1980. In 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) estimated that 9% of U.S. children have asthma, including 
19.2% of Puerto Rican and 12.7% of non-Hispanic black chil-
dren. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Child-
hood has conducted a systematic review of asthma prevalence, 
with compelling evidence for a substantial global burden of child-
hood asthma, although rates vary substantially between and 
within countries. The highest annual prevalence rates are in the 
United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland, with the 
lowest rates in Eastern European countries, Indonesia, China, 
Taiwan, India, and Ethiopia (Chapter 138).
Chronic cognitive morbidities represent another substantial 
problem. Although different diagnostic criteria have been applied, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been identi-
fied in 5-12% of children in countries across the globe. Rates 
exceeding 10% have been reported in the USA, New Zealand, 
Australia, Spain, Italy, Colombia, and Great Britain. Variations 
in cultural tolerance and/or differences in screening approaches 
or tools may account for some of the differences in prevalence of 
the disorder by country, but genetic and gene-environmental 
interactions may also play a role. Despite variations in rate, the 
condition is universal. Beyond the personal and familial stress 
caused by the disorder, costs to the educational system are con-
siderable. It is estimated that in 2010 the U.S. drug treatment 
costs for ADHD will exceed $4 billion. In developing countries 
without resources for special education, these children are 
unlikely to fulfill their academic potential (Chapter 30).
Mental retardation affects ≈1-3% of children in the USA, 
with ∼80% of these children having mild retardation. Rates are 
several­fold higher among very low birthweight infants, although 
data from European cerebral palsy (CP) registries has revealed a 
significant decrease in the prevalence of CP in very low birth-
weight infants, from 60.6 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 39.5 
per 1,000 live births in 1996. In the USA, there is substantial 
variation in rates of mild retardation by socioeconomic status 
(9-fold higher in the lowest compared to the highest socioeco-
nomic stratum) but relatively equivalent rates of severe retarda-
tion. A similar income-related distribution is found in other 
countries, including some of the most impoverished countries 
such as Bangladesh. Lower overall rates have been reported in 
some countries, including countries ranging from Saudi Arabia 
to Sweden to China; the difference is primarily in the prevalence 
of mild retardation (Chapter 33).
The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) varies 
considerably around the globe, but in children with substantial 
exposure to violence, the rates may be very high. After the attacks 
on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon in 2001, 
33% of U.S. children had experienced 1 or more symptoms of 
PTSD. One half of Palestinian children experience at least 1 sig-
nificant lifetime trauma and >33% (66% of those experiencing

trauma) meet the criteria of PTSD. Natural disasters such as the 
tsunami of 2004 and the Haitian and Chilean earthquakes and 
Pakistani floods of 2010; war, including those in Afghanistan, 
Sudan, and Iraq; and urban violence all leave their indelible 
marks on the minds of children.
Special Risk Populations
In addition to the enormous differences in infant and child health 
between regions and nations, within countries there are substantial 
variations in morbidity and mortality rates by socioeconomic class 
and ethnicity. Most children at special risk need a nurturing envi-
ronment but have had their futures compromised by actions or 
policies arising from their families, schools, communities, nations, 
or the international community. These problems have several 
causes, whether the end result is homeless children, runaway 
children, children in foster care, or children in other disadvantaged 
groups. The most effective preventive approach involves allevia-
tion of poverty, inadequate parenting, discrimination, violence, 
poor housing, and poor education. Optimal care of these children 
requires reducing barriers to health care with organized programs, 
multidiscipline teams, and special financing.

6  n  Part I  The Field of Pediatrics
Children in Poverty
Family income is central to the health and well-being of children. 
Children living in poor families, especially those located in poor 
communities, are much more likely than children living in upper- 
or middle-class families to experience material deprivation and 
poor health, die during childhood, score lower on standardized 
tests, be retained in a grade or drop out of school, have out-of-
wedlock births, experience violent crime, end up as poor adults, 
and suffer other undesirable outcomes. In 2008, 20.7% of U.S. 
children <18 yr (21% of those less than 6 yr) lived in poverty 
(defined as income <$21,756/yr for a family of 4), a rate among 
the highest of developed countries. Seven percent lived in extreme 
poverty. The poverty rates are higher for children than adults and 
are highest for infants and toddlers. Children who are poor have 
higher than average rates of death and illness from almost all 
causes (exceptions being suicide and motor vehicle crashes, which 
are most common among white, non-poor children). Many 
factors associated with poverty are responsible for these illnesses; 
crowding, poor hygiene and health care, poor diet, environmental 
pollution, poor education, and stress.
Similar poverty-linked disparities may exist in countries with 
very high infant mortality rates (sub-Saharan Africa). In the low-
income developing countries, the rate of infant mortality among 
the poorest quintile of the population is more than twice that of 
the wealthiest quintile (Fig. 1-2).
Poverty and economic loss diminish the capacity of parents to 
be supportive, consistent, and involved with their children. Clini-
cians at all times but especially in the context of a national or 
global recession need to be especially alert to the development 
and behavior of children whose parents have lost their jobs or 
who live in permanent poverty. Fathers who become unemployed 
frequently develop psychosomatic symptoms, and their children 
often develop similar symptoms. Young children who grew up in 
the Great Depression in the USA and whose parents were subject 
to acute poverty suffered more than older children, especially if 
the older ones were able to take on responsibilities for helping 
the family economically. Such responsibilities during adolescence 
seem to give purpose and direction to an adolescent’s life. The 
younger children, faced with parental depression and unable to 
do anything to help, suffered a higher frequency of illness and a 
diminished capacity to lead productive lives even as adults.
Pediatricians and other child health workers have a responsi-
bility both to mitigate the effects of poverty on their patients and 
to contribute to efforts to reduce the number of children living 
in poverty. Clinicians should ask parents about their economic 
resources, adverse changes in their financial situation, and the 
family’s attempts to cope. Encouraging concrete methods of 
coping, suggesting ways to reduce stressful social circumstances 
while increasing social networks that are supportive, and refer-
ring patients and their families to appropriate welfare, job train-
ing, and family agencies can significantly improve the health and 
functioning of children at risk when their families live in poverty. 
In many cases, special services, especially social services, need to 
be added to the traditional medical services; outreach is required 
to find and encourage parents to use health services and bring 
their children into the health care system. Pediatricians also have 
the responsibility to contribute to and advocate for safety net 
services for impoverished children within and outside the bound-
aries of their own country. An increasing number of programs 
are available to help children of greatest need worldwide, such 
as Project Smile, CARE, Project Hope, and Doctors without 
Borders.
Children of Immigrants and Racial Minority Groups Including 
U.S. Native Americans
Eleven percent of the U.S. population is foreign-born; 1 of every 
5 children lives in an immigrant family. The USA is experiencing 
a wave of immigration larger than that occurring in the early 
20th century. There has been an increase in immigration from 
China, India, Southeast Asia, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, 
and the former Soviet Union nations. Until the mid-20th century, 
emigrants to the USA were primarily white and from Europe. 
Such individuals now represent only about 10% of immigrants; 
the remainder are overwhelmingly of color and from throughout 
the world. Although immigrants in the USA have faced discrimi-
nation and oppression throughout history, the potential for such 
discrimination is compounded by the racial differences repre-
sented in the current immigrant pool. In the USA, about 240,000 
children legally immigrate each year, and an estimated 50,000/yr 
enter the country illegally, although these numbers have been 
declining in the wake of the 2008 recession. Immigrants comprise 
>15% of the population in >50 countries, including many Western 
European countries.
The immigrant population constitutes a substantial propor-
tion of the low-wage labor market. Immigrants represent 14% of 
all U.S. workers but 20% of low-wage workers. Immigrants are 
twice as likely as U.S.–born citizens to earn less than minimum 
wage. The poverty rate of children in immigrant families is 50% 
greater than in U.S.–born families, with 50% of immigrant chil-
dren compared to 33% of children in U.S.–born families being 
below the 200% poverty level. Contributing to the lack of access 
to higher salaried jobs is the lack of proficiency in English (≈66% 
of immigrants) and the lack of education (40% have not com-
pleted high school). In the past decade, about 9 million immi-
grants attained permanent residency status. There may be 
850,000-1,000,000 illegal immigrant children.
Families of different origins obviously bring different health 
problems and different cultural backgrounds, which influence 
health practices and use of medical care. To provide appropriate 
services, clinicians need to understand these influences (Chapter 
4). For example, the high prevalence of hepatitis among women 
from Southeast Asia makes use of hepatitis B vaccine essential 
for their newborns. Children from Southeast Asia and South 
America have growth patterns that are generally below the norms 
established for children of Western European origin, as well as 
high rates of hepatitis, parasitic diseases, and nutritional deficien-
cies and high degrees of psychosocial stress. Foreign-born chil-
dren may surpass American-born children in some health 
outcomes, but their health deteriorates as they become accultur-
ated (Chapter 4).
Refugee children who escape from war or political violence 
and whose families have been subjected to extreme stress repre-
sent a subset of immigrant children who have faced severe trauma. 
These children have a particularly high incidence of mental and 
behavioral problems (Chapter 23).

age 5 than their wealthier peers. (From World Health Organization: World health

Chapter 1  Overview of Pediatrics  n  7
“Linguistically isolated households,” in which no one older 
than 14 yr of age speaks English, often present significant obsta-
cles to providing quality health care to children because of dif-
ficulties in understanding and communicating basic concerns and 
instructions, avoiding compromising privacy and confidentiality 
interests, and obtaining informed consent (Chapter 4).
The USA is home to multiple minority populations, including 
the 2 largest groups, Latinos and African-Americans. The non-
white minority groups will constitute >50% of the U.S. population 
by 2050 (Chapter 4). Nonwhite children in the USA dispropor-
tionately experience adverse child health outcomes (see Tables 1-2 
through 1-4). Infants that are born to African-American mothers 
experience low birthweight and infant mortality rates twice those 
with white mothers (Chapter 87). Rates of these 2 adverse health 
outcomes are also substantially higher among some groups of 
Hispanic infants and children, although there is great variation by 
country of origin. The rates are particularly high among those of 
Puerto Rican descent (≈1.5 times the rates for white infants). In 
2006, the overall infant mortality rate was 6.7/1,000 live births, 
whereas that for non-Hispanic African-America infants was 13.6; 
for Native Americans, 8.1; and for Puerto Ricans, 8.3. Mexicans, 
Asians, Pacific Islanders, Central and South Americans, and 
Cubans were below the national average. Latino, Native Ameri-
can, and African-American children are substantially more likely 
to live in poverty than are white children.
There are ≈2.5 million Native Americans (4.1 million in com-
bination with other races/ethnicities) and 558 federally recog-
nized tribes. With 840,000 children (1.4 million in combination), 
the Native American population has a much higher proportion 
of children (34%) than does the remainder of the U.S. population 
(26%). About 60% of Native Americans live in urban areas, not 
on or near native lands. Like their minority immigrant counter-
parts, they have faced social and economic discrimination. The 
unemployment and poverty levels of Native Americans are, 
respectively, 3-fold and 4-fold that of the white population, and 
far fewer Native Americans graduate from high school or go to 
college. The rate of low birthweight among Native Americans is 
more than the white rate but less than the black rate. The neo-
natal and the postneonatal mortality rates are higher for Native 
Americans living in urban areas than for urban white Americans. 
Deaths in the 1st yr of life due to sudden infant death syndrome, 
pneumonia, and influenza are higher than the average in the USA, 
whereas deaths due to congenital anomalies, respiratory distress 
syndrome, and disorders relating to short gestation and low 
birthweight are similar.
Unintended injury deaths among Native Americans occur at 
twice the rate for other U.S. populations; deaths due to malignant 
neoplasms are lower. During adolescence and young adulthood, 
suicide and homicide are the 2nd and 3rd causes of death in this 
population and occur at about twice the rates of the rest of the 
population. There may be significant underreporting of deaths of 
Native American children.
As many as 75% of Native American children have recurrent 
otitis media and high rates of hearing loss, resulting in learning 
problems. Tuberculosis and gastroenteritis, formerly much more 
common among Native Americans, now occur at about the 
national average. Psychosocial problems are more prevalent in 
these populations than in the general population: depression, 
alcoholism, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock teenage pregnancy, 
school failure and dropout, and child abuse and neglect.
Most other nations have indigenous populations who are sub-
jected to discrimination, social and economic sanctions, and/or 
physical maltreatment and who demonstrate the poorest child 
health outcomes. An estimated 300 million indigenous persons 
live in 70 countries (50% in Asia) and speak ≈4,000 languages. 
Such children endure lower vaccination rates, lower school entry 
and higher dropout rates, higher rates of poverty, and lower 
access to justice. Indigenous children in Latin America account 
for 66% of the deaths of children younger than age 2 yr.
In the USA, existing programs for meeting child health prob-
lems are not available to all families in need, with gaps between 
eligibility for public support and parents’ ability to pay for ser-
vices. Needed services for immigrants are often either nonexistent 
or fragmented among programs, agencies, or policies. Programs 
are often poorly coordinated, and the data collection is 
inadequate.
Children of Migrant Workers
Families facing economic, social, or political hardship have been 
forced to leave their land and homes in search of better oppor-
tunities; such migrations are often within a country or between 
neighboring countries. Both industrialized and developing coun-
tries experience these migrations.
In the USA, there are an estimated 3-5 million migrant and 
seasonal farm workers and their families. The eastern migration 
is primarily from Florida, whereas the western migration comes 
from Texas, other border states, and Mexico. Many children 
travel with their parents and experience poor housing, frequent 
moves, and a socioeconomic system controlled by a crew boss 
who arranges the jobs, provides transportation, and often, 
together with the farm owners, provides food, alcohol, and drugs 
under a “company store” system that leaves migrant families with 
little money or in debt. Children often go without schooling; 
medical care is usually limited.
The medical problems of children of migrant farm workers 
are similar to those of children of homeless families: increased 
frequency of infections (including HIV), trauma, poor nutrition, 
poor dental care, low immunization rates, exposures to animals 
and toxic chemicals, anemia, and developmental delays.
Among the most substantial migrant populations in the  
world is China’s “floating population,” an estimated 100 million 
(almost 10% of China’s population) of rural to urban migrants. 
The rapidly growing urban versus rural income gradient and a 
relaxation of restrictions on movement in the country has fueled 
this influx of rural residents who arrive in China’s urban areas 
without health, education, or employment benefits for themselves 
or their children. Similar patterns are seen in many countries in 
Asia, Africa, and South America. In most of these countries there 
are few legal or social programs to aid the families or their chil-
dren, spawning massive squatter settlements without provisions 
for water, sanitation, education, or basic health needs. Govern-
ment policies vary worldwide, but in some instances their response 
to such communities is to bulldoze the settlements and imprison 
or deport the residents.
Homeless Children
Families with children are the fastest growing segment of the 
homeless population in the USA. Children make up over 35% of 
the homeless population, over 40% of whom are under age 5 yr, 
with an estimated 100,000 children living in shelters on a given 
night and about 500,000 homeless each year. Many homeless are 
not in shelters (living in the street or with extended families), and 
thus these figures are low estimates. The population of homeless 
children has been increasing as a consequence of more families 
with children living in poverty or near poverty, fewer available 
affordable dwellings for these families, decreasing public assis-
tance programs for the non-elderly poor, and the rising preva-
lence of substance abuse.
Homeless children have an increased frequency of illness, 
including intestinal infections, anemia, neurologic disorders, sei-
zures, behavioral disorders, mental illness, and dental problems, 
as well as increased frequency of trauma and substance abuse. 
Homeless children are admitted to U.S. hospitals at a much 
higher rate than the national average. They have higher school 
failure rates, and the likelihood of their being victims of abuse 
and neglect is much higher. In 1 study, 50% of such children were 
found to have psychosocial problems, such as developmental 
delays, severe depression, or learning disorders. The increased

8  n  Part I  The Field of Pediatrics
frequency of maternal psychosocial problems, especially depres-
sion, in homeless households has a significant untoward impact 
on the mental and physical health of these children. Because 
families tend to break apart under the strain of poverty and 
homelessness, many homeless children end up in foster care. If 
their families remain intact, frequent moves make it very difficult 
for them to receive continuity of medical care.
Homelessness exists worldwide. There are an estimated 
3 million people in the 15 countries of the European Union  
who do not have a permanent home while in Canada there are 
200,000-300,000 homeless. In some nations in Latin America, 
Asia, and Africa, the distinction between rural-to-urban migrants 
and homelessness is blurred.
Provision of adequate housing, job retraining for the parents, 
and mental health and social services are necessary to prevent 
homelessness from occurring. Physicians can have an important 
role in motivating society to adopt the social policies that will 
prevent homelessness from occurring by educating policymakers 
that these homeless children are at greater risk of becoming 
burdens both to themselves and to society if their special health 
needs are not met.
Runaway and Thrown-Away Children
The number of runaway and thrown-away children and youths 
in the USA is estimated at about 500,000; several hundred thou-
sand of these children have no secure and safe place to stay. 
Teenagers make up most of both groups. The usual definition of 
a runaway is a youth younger than 18 yr who is gone for at least 
1 night from his or her home without parental permission. Most 
runaways leave home only once, stay overnight with friends, and 
have no contact with the police or other agencies. This group is 
no different from their “healthy” peers in psychologic status. A 
smaller but unknown number become multiple or permanent 
“runners” and are significantly different from the one-time 
runners.
Thrown-aways include children told directly to leave the 
household, children who have been away from home and are not 
allowed to return, abandoned or deserted children, and children 
who run away but whose caretakers make no effort to recover 
them or do not appear to care if they return. The same constel-
lation of causes common to many of the other special-risk groups 
is characteristic of permanent runaways, including environmental 
problems (family dysfunction, abuse, poverty) and personal prob-
lems of the young person (poor impulse control, psychopathol-
ogy, substance abuse, or school failure). Thrown-aways experience 
more violence and conflicts in their families.
In the USA, it is a minority of runaway youths who become 
homeless street people. These youths have a high frequency of 
problem behaviors, with 75% engaging in some type of criminal 
activity and 50% engaging in prostitution. A majority of perma-
nent runaways have serious mental problems; more than 33% 
are the product of families who engage in repeated physical and 
sexual abuse (Chapter 37). These children also have a high fre-
quency of medical problems, including hepatitis, sexually trans-
mitted infections, and drug abuse. Although runaways often 
distrust most social agencies, they will come to and use medical 
services. Medical care may become the point of re-entry into 
mainstream society and the path to needed services. U.S. parents 
who seek a physician’s advice about a runaway child should be 
asked about the child’s history of running away, the presence of 
family dysfunction, and personal aspects of the child’s develop-
ment. If the youth contacts the physician, the latter should 
examine the youth and assess his or her health status, as well as 
willingness to return home. If it is not feasible for the youth to 
return home, foster care, a group home, or an independent living 
arrangement should be sought by referral to a social worker or 
a social agency. Although legal considerations involved in the 
treatment of homeless minor adolescents may be significant, most 
states, through their “Good Samaritan” laws and definitions of 
emancipated minors, authorize treatment of homeless youths. 
Legal barriers should not be used as an excuse to refuse medical 
care to runaway or thrown-away youths.
The issue of runaway youths is very complex in many develop-
ing nations, where in many instances the youth may be orphaned 
and/or leaving situations of forced sex or other abusive situations. 
It is estimated that there are tens of millions of such youth world-
wide. Natural disasters such as the 2010 earthquake devastating 
Haiti also contribute to growing numbers of orphaned children. 
In 2007, there were an estimated 11-15 million HIV orphans in 
Africa; this number is estimated to grow to as high as 20 million 
by 2010. With school attendance <50% in many parts of sub-
Saharan Africa, children who are orphaned are 17% less likely 
to attend school. Humanitarian and international organizations 
have begun to focus on this very vulnerable group of youths 
across the globe. Rates are often uncertain, and in many coun-
tries, these children have not even been recognized as an at-risk 
group, so great is the social chaos and so massive are the unmet 
needs.
Children Directly Affected By War (Chapter 36.2)
Since the end of the Second World War, there have been ∼250 
major wars (defined as armed combat with over 1,000 casualties), 
the majority of which have been civil wars. Many of these con-
flicts have lasted over a decade; Angola has been engaged in civil 
war for nearly 3 decades. Sixteen of the world’s poorest 20 coun-
tries have endured a civil war in the past 15 yr. In modern wars, 
70-80% of casualties are among women and children. Direct 
mortality and morbidity to children account for only a portion 
of war’s destructive impact on children. In 1996 the United 
Nations commissioned a report addressing the full consequences 
of war on children entitled “Promotion and Protection of the 
Rights of Children: Impact of Armed Conflict on Children” 
including (1) the disruption of basic educational and child health 
pediatric care and services; (2) hardships endured as a result of 
refugee status; (3) the abuse of the 250,000 to 300,000 children 
under age 18 yr who are soldiers; and (4) the impact on children 
when 1 or both parents are deployed to serve.
Inherent Strengths in Vulnerable Children and Interventions
By age 20-30 yr, many children in the USA and other developed 
countries who were at special risk will have made moderate suc-
cesses of their lives. Teenage mothers and children who were born 
prematurely or in poverty demonstrate that, by this age, the 
majority have made the transition to stable marriages and jobs 
and are accepted by their communities as responsible citizens. As 
the numbers of risk factors increases for an individual, however, 
the odds for a successful adulthood decline.
Certain biologic characteristics are associated with success, 
such as being born with an accepting temperament. Avoidance of 
additional social risks is even more important. Premature infants 
or preadolescent boys with conduct disorders and poor reading 
skills, who must also face a broken family, poverty, frequent 
moves, and family violence, are at much greater risk than children 
with only 1 of these risks. Perhaps most important are the protec-
tive buffers that have been found to enhance children’s resilience 
because these can be aided by an effective health care system and 
community. Children generally do better if they can gain social 
support, either from family members or from a nonjudgmental 
adult outside the family, especially an older mentor or peer. Pro-
viders of medical services should develop ways to “prescribe” 
supportive “other” persons for children who are at risk. Promo-
tion of self-esteem and self-efficacy is a central factor in protec-
tion against risks. It is essential to promote competence in some 
area of these children’s lives. Prediction of the consequences of 
risk is never 100% accurate. However, the confidence that, even 
without aid, many such children will achieve a good outcome by 
age 30 yr does not justify ignoring or withholding services from 
them in early life.

Chapter 1  Overview of Pediatrics  n  9
A team is needed because it is rare for 1 individual to be able 
to provide the multiple services needed for high-risk children. 
Successful programs are characterized by at least 1 caring person 
who can make personal contact with these children and their 
families. Most successful programs are relatively small (or are 
large programs divided into small units) and nonbureaucratic but 
are intensive, comprehensive, and flexible. They work not only 
with the individual, but also with the family, school, community, 
and at broader societal levels. Generally, the earlier the programs 
are started, in terms of the age of the children involved, the better 
is the chance of success. It is also important for services to be 
continued over a long period.
The Challenge to Pediatricians
Concerns about the aforementioned problems of children 
throughout the world have generated 3 sets of goals. The 1st 
set includes that all families have access to adequate perinatal, 
preschool, and family-planning services; that international and 
national governmental activities be effectively coordinated at the 
global, regional, national, and local levels; that services be so 
organized that they reach populations at special risk; that there 
be no insurmountable or inequitable financial barriers to ade-
quate care; that the health care of children have continuity from 
prenatal through adolescent age periods; and that every family 
ultimately have access to all necessary services, including devel-
opmental, dental, genetic, and mental health services. A 2nd set 
of goals addresses the need for reducing unintended injuries and 
environmental risks, for meeting nutritional needs, and for 
health education aimed at fostering health-promoting lifestyles. 
A 3rd set of goals covers the need for research in biomedical 
and behavioral science, in fundamentals of bioscience and 
human biology, and in the particular problems of mothers and 
children.
The unfinished business in the quest for physical, mental, 
and social health in the community is illustrated by the dispari-
ties with which deaths due to disease, injuries, and violence are 
distributed among white, black, and Hispanic children in the 
USA and between and within nations. Homicide is a major 
cause of adolescent deaths and has increased in rate among the 
very young, in whom the increase may, in part, represent the 
more accurate identification of child abuse (Chapter 37). Among 
adolescents, homicide may reflect unresolved social tensions, 
substance abuse (cocaine, crack), and an unhealthy preoccupa-
tion with violence in our society (Part III and Chapters 36, 107, 
and 108).
Patterns of Health Care
In 2005, children younger than 15 yr made ≈211 million patient 
visits to U.S. physicians’ offices and hospital outpatient depart-
ments. This represents 34.8 visits per 100 children per year, up 
from 25.3 in 1995. Pediatricians report an average of 50 preven-
tive care visits per week, 33% for infants. The visits average 
17-20 min, increasing in length as children become adolescents. 
The principal diagnoses, accounting for ≈40% of these visits, are 
well child visits (15%), middle-ear infections (12%), and injuries 
(10%). Ambulatory visits by children and youth decrease with 
age. The opposite occurs with adults. Nonwhite children are 
more likely than white children to use hospital facilities (includ-
ing the emergency room) for their ambulatory care; the number 
of well child visits annually is almost 80% higher among white 
infants than black infants. Children with private insurance are 
more likely than children with public insurance who, in turn, are 
more likely than uninsured children to receive non–emergency 
room care. Insurance coverage increases outpatient utilization 
and receipt of preventive care by approximately 1 visit per year 
for children.
In the USA, between 70 and 90 children per 1,000 children 
are hospitalized per year. White children are less likely to be 
hospitalized than black or Hispanic children, but more likely than 
Asian children. Poor children are nearly twice as likely as non-
poor children to be hospitalized. Insurance coverage also appears 
to reduce hospital admissions that are potentially manageable in 
an ambulatory setting.
Health care utilization differs significantly among nations. In 
most countries, however, hospitals are sources of both routine 
and intensive child care, with medical and surgical services that 
may range from immunization and developmental counseling to 
open heart surgery and renal transplantation. In most countries, 
clinical conditions and procedures requiring intensive care are 
also likely to be clustered in university-affiliated centers serving 
as regional resources—if these resources exist.
In the USA, the hospitalization rates for children (excluding 
newborn infants) are less than those of adults younger than 65 yr 
of age, except in the 1st yr of life. The rate of hospitalization and 
lengths of hospital stay have declined significantly for children 
and adults in the past decade. Children represent <7% of the total 
acute hospital discharges; in children’s hospitals, ≈70% of admis-
sions are for chronic conditions, and 10-12% of pediatric hospi-
talizations are related to birth defects and genetic diseases.
Patterns of health care vary widely around the globe, reflecting 
differences in the geography and wealth of the country, the prior-
ity placed on health care vs other competing needs and interests, 
philosophy regarding prevention vs curative care, and the balance 
between child health and adult health care needs. The significant 
declines in infant and child mortality enjoyed in many of the 
developing countries in the past 3 decades have occurred in the 
context of support from international agencies like UNICEF, 
WHO, and the World Bank; bilateral donors (the aid provided 
from 1 country to another); and nongovernmental agencies to 
develop integrated, universal primary pediatric care with an 
emphasis on primary (vaccination) and selected secondary (oral 
rehydration solution [ORS], treatment of pneumonia and malaria) 
prevention strategies.
Planning and Implementing a System of Care
Through much of the 20th century, pediatricians were primarily 
focused on the treatment and prevention of physical illness and 
disorders. Currently, physicians caring for children, especially 
those in developed countries, have been increasingly called on to 
advise in the management of disturbed behavior of children and 
adolescents or problematic relationships between child and parent, 
child and school, or child and community. The medical problems 
of children are often intimately related to problems of mental and 
social health. There is also an increasing concern about disparities 
in how the benefits of what we know about child health reach 
various groups of children. In both developed and developing 
nations, the health of children lags far behind what it could be if 
the means and will to apply current knowledge were focused on 
the health of children. The children most at risk are disproportion-
ately represented among ethnic minority groups. Pediatricians 
have a responsibility to address these problems aggressively.
Linked with these views of the broad scope of pediatric 
concern is the concept that access to at least a basic level of 
quality services to promote health and treat illness is a right of 
every person. Among children in the USA, having health insur-
ance is strongly associated with access to primary care. The 
failure of health services and health benefits to reach all children 
who need them has led to re-examination of the design of health 
care systems in many countries, but unresolved problems remain 
in most health care systems, such as the maldistribution of phy-
sicians, institutional unresponsiveness to the perceived needs of 
the individual, failure of medical services to adjust to the need 
and convenience of patients, and deficiencies in health educa-
tion. Efforts to make the delivery of health care more efficient 
and effective have led imaginative pediatricians to create new 
categories of health care providers, such as pediatric nurse

practitioners in industrialized nations and trained birth atten-
dants in developing countries, and to participate in new organi-
zations for providing care to children, such as various managed 
care arrangements.
New insights into the needs of children have reshaped the 
child health care system in other ways. Growing understanding 
of the need of infants for certain qualities of stimulation and care 
has led to revision of the care of newborn infants (Chapters 7 
and 88) and of procedures leading to an adoption or to placement 
with foster families (Chapters 34 and 35). For handicapped  
children, the massive centralized institutions of past years are 
being replaced by community-centered arrangements offering a 
better opportunity for these children to achieve their maximum 
potential.
Without question, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act passed in 2010 will impact the organization of health 
care. In particular, the new relationships expected between physi-
cians and hospital systems through Accountable Care Organiza-
tions (ACOs) should streamline patient access.
Health Services for At-Risk Populations
Adverse health outcomes are not evenly distributed among all 
children, but are concentrated in certain high-risk populations. 
At-risk populations may require additional, targeted, or special 
programs designed to be effective with unique populations. All 
nations, regardless of wealth and level of industrialization, have 
subgroups of children at particular risk, requiring additional 
services.
In the USA, the largest vulnerable group is children living in 
poverty, representing about 14% of U.S. children. Substantial 
proportions of children in other industrialized countries are also 
living in poverty. The approach to addressing the needs of this 
group in the USA has been the establishment of a targeted insur-
ance program, Medicaid, which became law in 1965 as a jointly 
funded cooperative venture between the federal and state govern-
ments to assist states in the provision of adequate medical care to 
eligible needy persons. The federal statute identifies >25 different 
eligibility categories for which federal funds are available. These 
statutory categories can be classified into 5 broad coverage groups: 
children, pregnant women, adults in families with dependent  
children, individuals with disabilities, and individuals ≥65 yr old. 
Pediatric care in the USA is highly dependent on Medicaid; 
however, only a relatively small proportion of the Medicaid funds 
actually go to child health, with the remainder serving older adults. 
Following broad national guidelines, each state establishes its own 
eligibility standards; determines the type, amount, duration, and 
scope of services; sets the rate of payment for services; and admin-
isters its own program. Although Medicaid has made great strides 
in enrolling low-income children, significant numbers of children 
remain uninsured. From 1988 to 1998, the proportion of children 
insured through Medicaid increased from 15.6% to 19.8%, but 
the percentage of children without health insurance increased from 
13.1% to 15.4%. Minority children were disproportionately 
among those without insurance. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 
created a new children’s health insurance program called the State 
Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). This program gave 
each state permission to offer health insurance for children, up  
to age 19 yr, who are not already insured. SCHIP is a state-
administered program and each state sets its own guidelines 
regarding eligibility and services. There is great variation by state, 
but in many states, the SCHIP program has begun to reduce racial 
inequities in access to health care for children. In 2009, the percent 
of children without insurance had decreased to 9%.
Many industrialized nations have adapted different “safety 
net” systems to assure adequate coverage of all youth. Many of 
these programs provide health insurance for all children, regard-
less of income, hoping to avoid problems with children losing 
insurance coverage and access to health care due to changes  
in eligibility by providing a single form of insurance that all 
providers accept. The response of developing countries to the 
issue of universal access to care for children has been uneven, 
with some providing no safety net, but many having limited 
universal or safety net services.
To address the special needs of Native Americans in the USA, 
the Indian Health Service, established in 1954, has been the 
responsibility of the Public Health Service, but the 1975 Indian 
Self-Determination Act gave tribes the option of managing Native 
American health services in their communities. The Indian Health 
Service is managed through local administrative units, and some 
tribes contract outside the Indian Health Service for health care. 
Much of the emphasis is on adult services: treatment for alcohol-
ism, nutrition and dietetic counseling, and public health nursing 
services. There are also >40 urban programs for Native Ameri-
cans, with an emphasis on increasing access of this population to 
existing health services, providing special social services, and 
developing self-help groups. In an effort to accommodate tradi-
tional Western medical, psychologic, and social services to the 
Native American cultures, such programs include the “Talking 
Circle,” the “Sweat Lodge,” and other interventions based on 
Native American culture (Chapter 4). The efficacy of any of these 
programs, especially those to prevent and treat the sociopsycho-
logic problems particular to Native Americans, has not been 
determined.
Recognizing the health needs of migrants in the USA, the U.S. 
Public Health Service initiated in 1964 the Migrant Health 
Program to provide funds for local groups to organize medical 
care for migrant families. Many migrant health projects that were 
initially staffed by part-time providers and were open for only 
part of the year have been transformed into community health 
care centers that provide services not only for migrants but also 
for other local residents. In 2001, the ≈400 Migrant Health 
Centers served >650,000 migrant and seasonal farm workers; 
>85% were people of color. Health services for migrant farm 
workers often need to be organized separately from existing 
primary care programs because the families are migratory. Special 
record-keeping systems that link the health care provided during 
winter months in the south with the care provided during the 
migratory season in the north are difficult to maintain in ordinary 
group practices or individual physicians’ offices. Outreach pro-
grams that take medical care to the often remote farm sites are 
necessary, and specially organized Head Start, early education, 
and remedial education programs should also be provided. 
Approaches in other countries have also focused on business 
initiatives for migrant populations to enable them to overcome 
the cycle of financial dependency on their migratory lifestyle.
The USA has spent >$12 billion through the 1987 McKinney-
Vento Act to provide emergency food, shelter, and health care; to 
finance help for young runaways; to aid homeless people in 
making their way back into the housing market; and to place 
homeless children in school. Mobile vans, with a team consisting 
of a physician, nurse, social worker, and welfare worker, have 
been shown to provide effective comprehensive care, ensure deliv-
ery of immunizations, link the children to school health services, 
and bring the children and their families into a stable relationship 
with the conventional medical system. Special record-keeping 
systems have been introduced to enhance continuity and to 
provide a record of care once the family has moved to a perma-
nent location. Because of the high frequency of developmental 
delays in this group, linkage of preschool homeless children to 
Head Start programs is an especially important service. The 
Runaway Youth Act, Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delin-
quency Prevention Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-414) and its 
amended version (Public Law 95-509) have supported shelters 
and provide a toll-free 24 hr telephone number (1-800-621-
4000) for youths who wish to contact their parents or request 
help after having run away.
In Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain,

constitutions. The Finnish government has devised a multifaceted 
response to the problem, including house building, social welfare 
and health care services, and the obligation to provide a home  
of minimum standards for every homeless person. The number 
of homeless in Finland has been reduced by 50%.
Costs of Health Care
The growth of high technology, the increasing number of people 
older than 65 yr, the redesign of health institutions (particularly 
with respect to the needs for and the uses of personnel), the 
public’s demand for medical services, the increase in administra-
tive bureaucracies, and the manner in which the costs of health 
care are paid have driven the costs of health care in the USA up 
to a point at which they represent a significant proportion of the 
gross national product. Although children (0-18 yr) represent 
about 25% of the population, they account for only about 12% 
of the health care expenditures, or about 60% of adult per capita 
expenditures. Efforts to contain costs have led to revisions of the 
way in which physicians and hospitals are paid for services. Limits 
have been set on the fees for some services, capitated prepayment 
and various managed care systems flourish, a program of reim-
bursement (diagnosis-related groups [DRGs]) based on the diag-
nosis rather than on the particular services rendered to an 
individual patient has been implemented, and a relative value 
scale for varying rates of payment among different physician 
services has been instituted. These and other changes in the system 
of financing health services raise important ethical, quality of care, 
and professional issues for pediatricians to address (Chapter 3).
Health care costs have been better contained in most other 
industrialized nations, the majority of which also enjoy lower 
childhood mortality rates than does the USA.
Evaluation of Health Care
The shaping of health care systems to meet the needs of children 
and their families requires accurate statistical data and difficult 
decisions in setting priorities. Along with growing concerns about 
the design and cost of health care systems and the ability to dis-
tribute health services equitably has come increasing concern 
about the quality of health care and about its efficiency and 
effectiveness. There are large local and regional variations among 
similar populations of children in the rates of use of procedures 
and technology and of hospital admissions. These variations 
require continuing evaluation and explanation in terms of the 
actual impact of medical and surgical services on health status 
and the outcome of illness.
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a report, “Crossing 
the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century” 
in 2001. This report, challenging American physicians to renew 
efforts to focus not just on access and cost, but also on quality 
of care, has been furthered in several pediatric initiatives, includ-
ing but not limited to: specific initiatives for monitoring child 
health outlined in the IOM report “Children’s Health, the 
Nation’s Wealth”; challenge/demonstration grants funded by the 
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; and the National Initiative 
for Children’s Healthcare Quality. Importantly, each of these 
initiatives is calling for the establishment of measurable standards 
for assessment of quality of care and for the establishment of 
routine plans for periodic reassessment thereof. Efforts have been 
initiated at some medical centers to establish evidence-based clini-
cal pathways for disorders (such as asthma) where there exists 
sound evidence to advise these guidelines. Pediatricians have 
developed tools to evaluate the content and delivery of pediatric 
preventive “anticipatory guidance,” the cornerstone of modern 
pediatrics (Chapter 5).
Consistent with the increased focus on quality and lifelong 
learning, the Residency Review and Redesign in Pediatrics (R3P) 
project involving a broad-based pediatric constituency led by the 
American Board of Pediatrics, was undertaken to ensure that 
pediatric residency training meets the health care and well-being 
needs of children in the 21st century. The R3P and the follow-on 
program, the Initiative for Innovation in Pediatric Education 
(IIPE), are calling for a transformation of residency training that 
focuses on continuous evaluation, adaptation to the differing and 
changing needs of children, and the recognition that continued 
training throughout a pediatrician’s professional career will be 
necessary if the field of pediatrics is to best meet the needs of 
children. Increased attention is also being focused on the impor-
tance of providing pediatricians with the skills to communicate 
effectively with parents and patients and understanding the 
responsibilities of professionalism. These efforts are having an 
impact, with evidence that 66% of children are receiving good 
or excellent preventive care with no disparities according to race 
or income level. The increased focus on quality improvement in 
pediatric practice is reflected in the pediatric residency training 
competency requirements of practice-based learning and improve-
ment and system-based practice.
The Information Explosion of the 21st Century
Currently there are over 5,000 journals and 1 million papers listed 
on PubMed. With globalization, pediatricians in settings around 
the world must be familiar with health and disease and health 
practices across the globe. In earlier years, new information in 
any field of medicine was easily accessible through a relatively 
small number of journals, texts, or monographs. Today, relevant 
information is so widely dispersed among the many journals that 
elaborate electronic data systems are necessary to make it acces-
sible. To access 100% of the randomized clinical trials published 
each year requires access to over 2,000 journals.
The Internet is revolutionizing access to medical knowledge in 
developing and transitional countries. Previously, medical schools 
in these settings were highly dependent on slow and often unpre-
dictable mail systems to connect them with medical advances, 
new directions in medical practice, and medical colleagues in 
general. Now, many of the same schools have immediate access 
to hundreds of journals and their professional counterparts across 
the globe.
There is no touchstone through which physicians can ensure 
that the process of their own continuing education will keep them 
abreast of advancing knowledge in the field, but they must find 
a way to base their decisions on the best available scientific evi-
dence if they are to discharge their responsibility to their patients. 
An essential element of this process may be for physicians to take 
an active role, such as participating in medical student and resi-
dent education. Efforts in continuing self-education will also be 
fostered if clinical problems can be made a stimulus for a review 
of standard literature, alone or in consultation with an appropri-
ate colleague or consultant. This continuing review will do much 
to identify those inconsistencies or contradictions that will indi-
cate, in the ultimate best interest of patients that things are not 
what they seem or have been said to be. These difficulties may 
be exacerbated by commercially sponsored education programs 
and research projects that may, on occasion, put profit before the 
patient’s best interests. Physicians still learn most from their 
patients, but this will not be the case if they fall into the easy 
habit of accepting their patients’ problems casually or at face 
value because the problems appear to be simple.
The tools that physicians must use in dealing with the prob-
lems of children and their families fall into 3 main categories: 
cognitive (up-to-date factual information about diagnostic and 
therapeutic issues, available on recall or easily found in readily 
accessible sources, and the ability to relate this information to 
the pathophysiology of their patients in the context of individual 
biologic variability); interpersonal or manual (the ability to carry 
out a productive interview, execute a reliable physical examina-
tion, perform a deft venipuncture, or manage cardiac arrest or 
resuscitation of a depressed newborn infant); and attitudinal (the

physician’s unselfish commitment to the fullest possible imple-
mentation of knowledge and skills on behalf of children and their 
families in an atmosphere of empathic sensitivity and concern). 
With regard to this last category, it is important that children 
participate with their families in informed decision-making about 
their own health care in a manner appropriate to their stage of 
development and the nature of the particular health problem.
The workaday needs of professional persons for knowledge 
and skills in care of children vary widely. Primary care physicians 
need depth in developmental concepts and in the ability to orga-
nize an effective system for achieving quality and continuity in 
assessing and planning for health care during the entire period of 
growth. They may often have little or no need for immediate 
recall of esoterica. On the other hand, consultants or subspecial-
ists not only need a comfortable grasp of both common and 
uncommon facts within their field and perhaps within related 
fields, but also must be able to cope with controversial issues with 
flexibility that will permit adaptation of various points of view 
to the best interest of their unique patient.
At whatever level of care (primary, secondary, or tertiary) or 
in whatever position (student, pediatric nurse practitioner, resi-
dent pediatrician, practitioner of pediatrics or family medicine, 
or pediatric or other subspecialists), professional persons dealing 
with children must be able to identify their roles of the moment 
and their levels of engagement with a child’s problem; each must 
determine whether his or her experience and other resources at 
hand are adequate to deal with this problem and must be ready 
to seek other help when they are not. Among the necessary 
resources are general textbooks, more detailed monographs in 
subspecialty areas, selected journals, Internet materials, audio­
visual aids, and, above all, colleagues with exceptional or comple-
mentary experience and expertise. The intercommunication of all 
these levels of engagement with medical and health problems of 
children offers the best hope of bringing us closer to the goal of 
providing the opportunity for all children to achieve their 
maximum potential.
Organization of the Profession and the Growth  
of Specialization
The 20th century witnessed the formation of professional societ-
ies of pediatricians around the globe. Some of these societies, such 
as the European Board of Pediatrics and the American Board of 
Pediatrics (ABP) and the, are concerned with education and the 
awarding of credentials certifying competence and the continuing 
maintenance of competence as a pediatrician and/or a pediatric 
subspecialist to the public. In 2010, the ABP reported that there 
were ≈96,514 board-certified pediatricians. Among those present-
ing for 1st time certification to the ABP in 2003, 80% were 
American Medical Graduates (20% were International Medical 
Graduates) and 63% were women. Other societies are primarily 
concerned with organizing members of the profession in their 
country or region to dedicate their efforts and resources toward 
children. In the USA, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 
currently has a membership of ≈60,000 child health specialists in 
both academic and private practice. Most general pediatricians 
in the USA enter private practice; ≈66% are in group practices, 
5% enter solo practice, and 5% work in a health maintenance 
organization. There is an increasing shortage of primary care 
pediatricians, particularly those skilled to take care of children 
with chronic conditions and special needs. The AAP provides a 
variety of continuing educational services to pediatricians in mul-
tiple national and regional settings and tracks the professional 
activities and practices of its members. A comparable group in 
India, the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, was formed in 1963, 
and now has ∼16,500 members and 16 subspecialty chapters. 
Likewise, the Pakistani Pediatrics Association was founded in 
1967, the Malaysian Pediatric Association was started in 1985, 
and the Canadian Pediatric Society was founded in 1922. Estab-
lished in 1974, the Asian Pacific Pediatric Association includes 
20 member pediatric societies from throughout eastern Asia, and 
the International Pediatric Association established in 1910 
includes 144 national pediatric societies from 139 countries, 10 
regional pediatric societies, and 11 international pediatric spe-
cialty societies. The European Academy of Pediatrics is the pedi-
atric specialist organization for the member countries of the 
European Union and the European Free Trade Association, and 
the Pediatric Council of the Arab Board of Medical Specializa-
tions is the comparable institution for 19 of the world’s Arab 
nations These societies represent but a few of the many national 
and regional pediatric professional organizations around the 
world who seek to identify and bring treatments and approaches 
supporting child well-being to pediatricians worldwide.
The amount of information relevant to child health care is 
rapidly expanding, and no person can become master of it all. 
Physicians are increasingly dependent on one another for the 
highest quality of care for their patients. About 25% of pediatri-
cians in the USA claim an area of special knowledge and skill, 
including 20,138 who have board certification in 1 of the 13 
pediatric subspecialties with board certification. Each year about

Chapter 5  Maximizing Children’s Health: Screening, Anticipatory Guidance, and Counseling  n  13
The care of well infants, children, and adolescents is an essential 
prevention effort for children and youth worldwide. The con-
stantly changing tableau of a child’s development lends added 
value to regular and periodic encounters between children and 
their families and practitioners of pediatric health care. Health 
supervision visits from birth to age 21 yr are the platform for a 
young person’s health care: well care is provided in the medical 
home, fostering strong relationships between clinic or practice 
and child and family, and assisting in the provision of appropriate 
surveillance, screening, and sick care.
The evolution of this preventive health care approach is 
derived from the long-standing view that the science of pediatrics 
is a science of health and development. To assure the optimal

Pediatricians live and work in a multicultural world. Among the 
world’s 6 billion people residing in >200 countries, >6,000 lan-
guages are spoken. As the global population becomes more 
mobile and integrated, ethnic and economic diversity increases in 
all countries; from 1970 to 2000, the foreign-born population in 
the USA increased 3-fold. In the 2000 U.S. census, 25-30% of 
Americans self-identified as belonging to an ethnic or racial 
minority group. One or both parents of approximately 17 million 
children in the USA are foreign-born; 1 of every 5 children lives 
in an immigrant family. Whereas in 1920, 97% of immigrant 
families in the USA were from Europe or Canada; in 2000, 84% 
of U.S. immigrant children were from Latin America or Asia. 
Nonwhite children are projected to outnumber white children in 
the USA by the year 2030. Increased migration and diversity in 
the migrant pool is not limited to the USA; immigrants account 
for over 15% of the population in >50 nations.

Ethics in Pediatric Care
Eric Kodish and Kathryn Weise
Pediatric ethics is a branch of bioethics that analyzes moral 
aspects of decisions made relating to the health care of children. 
In general terms, the autonomy driven framework of adult 
medical ethics is replaced by a beneficent paternalism (or paren-
talism) in pediatrics. Pediatric ethics is distinctive because the 
pediatric clinician has an independent fiduciary obligation to act 
in a younger child’s best interest that takes moral precedence over 
the wishes of the child’s parent(s). For older children, the concept 
of assent suggests that the voice of the patient must be heard. 
These factors create the possibility of conflict among child, 
parent, and clinician. The approach to the ethical issues that arise 
in pediatric practice must include respect for parental responsibil-
ity and authority balanced with a child’s developing capacity and 
autonomy. Heterogeneity of social, cultural, and religious views 
about the role of children adds complexity. Children are both 
vulnerable and resilient, and represent the future of our society.

The Need for QualiTy improvemeNT
There is a significant quality gap between known and recom-
mended evidence-based care, and the actual care that is delivered. 
Adults receive recommended care slightly higher than 50% of the 
time and children receive recommended care only about 46% of 
the time. This quality gap exists due to a chasm between knowl-
edge and practice—a chasm made wider by variations in practice 
and disparities in care from doctor to doctor, institution to insti-
tution, geographic region to geographic region, and socioeco-
nomic group to socioeconomic group.

Quality and Safety in Health Care 
for Children
Ramesh C. Sachdeva
10% of the ≈3,000 pediatric residents training in the USA are 
enrolled in a dual residency training program that will lead to 
eligibility for board certification in both pediatrics and internal 
medicine.
The growth of specialization within pediatrics has taken a 
number of different forms: interests in problems of age groups of 
children have created neonatology and adolescent medicine; inter-
ests in organ systems have created pediatric cardiology,  
neurology, child abuse, child development, allergy, hematology, 
nephrology, gastroenterology, child psychiatry, pulmonology, 
endocrinology, rheumatology, and specialization in metabolism 
and genetics; interests in the health care system have created 
pediatricians devoted to ambulatory care, emergency care, and 
intensive care; and, finally, multidisciplinary subspecialties have 
grown up around the problems of handicapped children, to which 
pediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, psychology, nursing, physical 
and occupational therapy, special education, speech therapy, audi-
ology, and nutrition all make essential contributions. This growth 
of specialization has been most conspicuous in university-affiliated 
departments of pediatrics and medical centers for children. There 
is growing concern in the USA regarding the shortage of pediatric 
subspecialists in virtually all of the subspecialty areas and espe-
cially in rural states. This results in long waits for patients.
In the USA, most subspecialists practice in academic settings 
or children’s hospitals. Likewise, specialists are growing in 
number in other industrialized countries and in developing 
nations that are becoming industrialized. Reflecting the diverse 
cultures, organization of medical care, economic circumstances 
and the history of medicine within each of the ∼200 countries 
across the globe, is the great diversity in role of pediatricians 
within the health care delivery system to children in each country; 
Figure 1-3 illustrates the result variations in pediatricians per 
population among European nations.

Overview and Assessment of Variability
Susan Feigelman
Part II  Growth, Development, and Behavior
The goal of pediatric care is to optimize the growth and develop-
ment of each child. Pediatricians need to understand normal 
growth, development, and behavior in order to monitor chil-
dren’s progress, identify delays or abnormalities in development, 
obtain needed services, and counsel parents. In addition to clini-
cal experience and personal knowledge, effective practice requires 
familiarity with major theoretical perspectives and evidence-
based strategies for optimizing growth and development. To 
target factors that increase or decrease risk, pediatricians need to 
understand how biologic and social forces interact within the 
parent-child relationship, within the family, and between the 
family and the larger society. Growth is an indicator of overall 
well-being, status of chronic disease, and interpersonal and  
psychologic stress. By monitoring children and families over 
time, pediatricians can observe the interrelationships between 
physical growth and cognitive, motor, and emotional develop-
ment. Observation is enhanced by familiarity with developmental 
theory and understanding of developmental models which 
describe normal patterns of behavior and provide guidance for 
prevention of behavior problems. Effective pediatricians also rec-
ognize how they can work with families and children to bring 
about healthy behaviors and behavioral change.
Biopsychosocial Models of Development
A biologic model of medicine presumes that a patient presents 
with signs and symptoms of a disease and a physician focuses of 
diseases of the body. This model neglects the psychologic aspect 
of a person who exists in the larger realm of the family and 
society. In a biopsychosocial model, higher-level systems are 
simultaneously considered with the lower-level systems that make 
up the person and the person’s environment (Fig. 6-1). A patient’s 
symptoms are examined and explained in the context of the 
patient’s existence. This basic model can be used to understand 
health and both acute and chronic disease.
Critical to learning and remembering (and therefore develop-
ment) is neuronal plasticity, which permits the central nervous 
system to reorganize neuronal networks in response to envir­
onmental stimulation, both positive and negative. Overproduc-
tion of neurons, by creating a reservoir of neurons upon 
which to draw in the case of injury or learning, appears to be 
adaptive. The brain comprises 100 billion neurons at birth, with 
each neuron developing on average 15,000 synapses by 3 yr of 
age. The number of synapses stays roughly constant through the 
first decade of life as the number of neurons declines. Synapses 
in frequently used pathways are preserved, whereas less-used 
ones atrophy, through neuronal “pruning.” In addition to neu-
ronal pruning, changes in the strength of synapses and reorgani-
zation of neuronal circuits also play important roles in brain 
plasticity. Increases or decreases in synaptic activity result in 
persistent increases or decreases in synaptic strength. Thus,  
experience (environment) has a direct effect on the physical prop-
erties of the brain (genetics). Children with different talents 
and temperaments (already a combination of genetics and envi-
ronment) further elicit different stimuli from their (differing) 
environments.
Periods of behavioral development generally correlate with 
periods of great changes in synaptic numbers in relevant areas 
of the brain. Accordingly, sensory deprivation during the time 
when synaptic changes should be occurring has profound effects. 
Thus, the effects of strabismus leading to amblyopia in one eye 
may occur quickly during early childhood; likewise, patching an 
eye with good vision to reverse amblyopia in the other eye is less 
effective in late childhood. Early experience is particularly impor-
tant because learning proceeds more efficiently along established 
synaptic pathways. Traumatic experiences also create enduring 
alterations in the neurotransmitter and endocrine systems that 
mediate the stress response, with effects noted later in life. Posi-
tive and negative experiences do not determine the total outcome, 
but shift the probabilities by influencing the child’s ability to 
respond adaptively to future stimuli. Neurobiologic markers  
may predict morbidity following environmental changes. Certain 
genetic polymorphisms may be associated with later disease 
onset under certain circumstances. The plasticity of the brain 
continues into adolescence, with further development of the  
prefrontal cortex, which is important in decision-making,  
future planning, and emotional control; neurogenesis persists in 
adulthood in certain areas of the brain, including the subven-
tricular zone of the lateral ventricles and in portions of the 
hippocampus.
Biologic Influences
Biologic influences on development include genetics, in utero 
exposure to teratogens, the long-term negative effects of low 
birthweight (increased rates of obesity, coronary heart disease, 
stroke, hypertension, and type-2 diabetes), postnatal illnesses, 
exposure to hazardous substances, and maturation. Adoption 
and twin studies consistently show that heredity accounts for 
approximately 50% of the variance in IQ and in other personal-
ity traits, such as sociability and desire for novelty. The specific 
genes underlying these traits have begun to be identified. The 
negative effects on development of prenatal exposure to terato-
gens, such as mercury and alcohol, and of postnatal insults, such 
as meningitis and traumatic brain injury, have been extensively 
studied. Any chronic illness can affect growth and development, 
either directly or through changes in nutrition, parenting, or peer 
interactions.
Physical and neurologic maturation propels children forward 
and sets lower limits for the emergence of most abilities. The age 
at which children walk independently is similar around the world, 
despite great variability in child-rearing practices. The attainment 
of other skills, such as the use of complex sentences, is less tightly 
bound to a maturational schedule. Maturational changes also 
generate behavioral challenges at predictable times. Decrements 
in growth rate and sleep requirements around 2 yr of age often 
generate concern about poor appetite and refusal to nap. Although 
it is possible to accelerate many developmental milestones (toilet 
training a 12 mo old or teaching a 3 yr old to read), the long-term 
benefits of such precocious accomplishments are questionable.
In addition to physical changes in size, body proportions, and 
strength, maturation brings about hormonal changes. Sexual dif-
ferentiation, both somatic and neurologic, begins in utero. Behav-
ioral effects of testosterone may be evident even in young children 
and continue to be salient throughout life. Correlations between 
testosterone levels and such traits as aggression or novelty seeking 
have not been consistently demonstrated.
Temperament describes the stable, early-appearing individual 
variations in behavioral dimensions including emotionality

(crying, laughing, sulking), activity level, attention, sociability, 
and persistence. The classic theory of Thomas and Chess pro-
poses 9 dimensions of temperament (Table 6-1). These charac-
teristics lead to 3 common constellations: (1) the easy, highly 
adaptable child, who has regular biologic cycles; (2) the difficult 
child, who withdraws from new stimuli and is easily frustrated; 
and (3) the slow-to-warm-up child, who needs extra time to 
adapt to new circumstances. Various combinations of these clus-
ters also occur. Temperament has long been described as biologic 
or “inherited,” largely based on parent reports (although con-
firmed by some independent observational studies) of twins. 
Monozygotic twins are consistently rated by their parents as 
temperamentally more similar as are dizygotic twins. Estimates 
of heritability suggest that genetic differences account for approx-
imately 20-60% of the variability of temperament within a popu-
lation. It was presumed that the remaining 80-40% of the 
variance is environmentally influenced because genetic influences 
tended to be viewed as static. We know that genes are dynamic, 
changing in the quantity and quality of their effects as a child 
ages and thus, like environment, may continue to change. Lon-
gitudinal twin studies of adult personality indicate that per­
sonality changes largely result from non-shared environmental 
influences, whereas stability of temperament appears to result 
from genetic factors. Although associations between specific 
genes and temperament have been noted (a 48-base pair repeat 
in exon 3 of DRD4 has been associated with novelty seeking), 
such associations require replication studies before they can be 
viewed as causative.
The concept of temperament can help parents understand and 
accept the characteristics of their children without feeling respon-
sible for having caused them. Children who have difficulty adjust-
ing to change may have behavior problems when a new baby 
arrives or at the time of school entry. In addition, pointing out 
the child’s temperament may allow for adjustment in parenting 
styles. Behavioral and emotional problems may develop when the 
temperamental characteristics of children and parents are in 
conflict.
Psychologic Influences: Attachment and Contingency
The influence of the child-rearing environment dominates most 
current models of development. Infants in hospitals and orphan-
ages, devoid of opportunities for attachment, have severe devel-
opmental deficits. Attachment refers to a biologically determined 
tendency of a young child to seek proximity to the parent during 
times of stress and also to the relationship that allows securely 
attached children to use their parents to re-establish a sense of 
well-being after a stressful experience. Insecure attachment may 
be predictive of later behavioral and learning problems.
At all stages of development, children progress optimally 
when they have adult caregivers who pay attention to their verbal 
and nonverbal cues and respond accordingly. In early infancy, 
such contingent responsiveness to signs of overarousal or under-
arousal helps maintain infants in a state of quiet alertness and 
fosters autonomic self-regulation. Contingent responses (rein-
forcement depending on the behavior of the other) to nonverbal 
gestures create the groundwork for the shared attention and reci-
procity that are critical for later language and social development. 
Children learn best when new challenges are just slightly harder 
than what they have already mastered; a degree of difficulty 
dubbed the “zone of proximal development.” Psychologic forces, 
such as attention problems or mood disorders, will have pro-
found effects on many aspects of an older child’s life.

Social Factors: Family Systems and the Ecologic Model
Contemporary models of child development recognize the critical 
importance of influences outside of the mother-child dyad. 
Fathers play critical roles, both in their direct relationships with 
their children and in supporting mothers. As traditional nuclear 
families become less dominant, the influence of other family 
members (grandparents, foster and adoptive parents, same-sex 
partners) becomes increasingly important. In addition, children 
are increasingly raised by unrelated caregivers while parents work 
or while they are in foster care.
Families function as systems, with internal and external 
boundaries, subsystems, roles, and rules for interaction. In fami-
lies with rigidly defined parental subsystems, children may be 
denied any decision-making, exacerbating rebelliousness. In fami-
lies with poorly defined parent-child boundaries, children may be 
required to take on responsibilities beyond their years, or may be 
recruited to play a spousal role.
Individuals within systems adopt implicit roles. For example, 
one child may be the troublemaker, whereas another is the nego-
tiator and another is quiet. Birth order may have profound effects 
on personality development, through its influence on family roles 
and patterns of interaction. Families are also dynamic. Changes 
in one person’s behavior affect every other member of the system; 
roles shift until a new equilibrium is found. The birth of a new 
child, attainment of developmental milestones such as indepen-
dent walking, the onset of nighttime fears, and the death of a 
grandparent are all changes that require renegotiation of roles 
within the family and have the potential for healthy adaptation 
or dysfunction.
The family system, in turn, functions within the larger systems 
of extended family, subculture, culture, and society. Bronfen-
brenner’s ecologic model depicts these relationships as concentric 
circles, with the parent-child dyad at the center (with associated 
risks and protective factors) and the larger society at the periph-
ery. Changes at any level are reflected in the levels above and 
below. The shift from an industrial economy to one based on 
service and information is an obvious example of societal change 
with profound effects on families and children.
Unifying Concepts: The Transactional Model,  
Risk, and Resilience
The transactional model proposes that a child’s status at any 
point in time is a function of the interaction between biologic and 
social influences. The influences are bidirectional: Biologic factors, 
such as temperament and health status, both affect the child-
rearing environment and are affected by it. A premature infant 
may cry little and sleep for long periods; the infant’s depressed 
parent may welcome this good behavior, setting up a cycle that 
leads to poor nutrition and inadequate growth. The child’s failure 
to thrive may reinforce the parent’s sense of failure as a parent.

depression and child adjustment. (From Elgar FJ, McGrath PJ,

Problems
At a later stage, impulsivity and inattention associated with early, 
prolonged undernutrition may lead to aggressive behavior. The 
cause of the aggression in this case is not the prematurity, the 
undernutrition, or the maternal depression, but the interaction of 
all these factors (Fig. 6-2). Conversely, children with biologic risk 
factors may nevertheless do well developmentally if the child-
rearing environment is supportive. Premature infants with elec-
troencephalographic evidence of neurologic immaturity may be 
at increased risk for cognitive delay. This risk may only be real-
ized when the quality of parent-child interaction is poor. When 
parent-child interactions are optimal, prematurity carries a 
reduced risk of developmental disability.
Children growing up in poverty experience multiple levels of 
developmental risk: increased exposure to biologic risk factors, 
such as environmental lead and undernutrition, lack of stimula-
tion in the home, and decreased access to interventional educa-
tion and therapeutic experiences. As they respond by withdrawal 
or acting out, they further discourage positive stimulation from 
those around them. Children of adolescent mothers are also at 
risk. When early intervention programs provide timely, intensive, 
comprehensive, and prolonged services, at-risk children show 
marked and sustained upswings in their developmental tra­
jectory. Early identification of children at developmental risk, 
along with early intervention to support parenting, is critically 
important.
An estimate of developmental risk can begin with a tally of 
risk factors, such as low income, limited parental education, and 
lack of neighborhood resources. There is a direct relationship 
between developmental outcome at age 13 yr and the number of 
social and family risk factors at age 4 yr (Fig. 6-3). Protective 
(resilience) factors must also be considered. These factors, like 
risk factors, may be either biologic (temperamental persistence, 
athletic talent) or social. The personal histories of children who 
overcome poverty often include at least one trusted adult (parent, 
grandparent, teacher) with whom the child has a special, sup-
portive, close relationship.
Developmental Domains and Theories  
of Emotion and Cognition
Child development can also be tracked by the child’s develop-
mental progress in particular domains, such as gross motor, fine 
motor, social, emotional, language, and cognition. Within each 
of these categories are developmental lines or sequences of 
changes leading up to particular attainments. Developmental 
lines in the gross motor domain, leading from rolling to creeping 
to independent walking, are obvious. Others, such as the line 
leading to the development of conscience, are more subtle.
The concept of a developmental line implies that a child passes 
though successive stages. Several psychoanalytic theories are 
based on stages as qualitatively different epochs in the develop-

ment of emotion and cognition (Table 6-2). In contrast, behav-
ioral theories rely less on qualitative change and more on 
the gradual modification of behavior and accumulation of 
competence.
Psychoanalytic Theories  At the core of Freudian theory is the 
idea of body-centered (or, broadly, “sexual”) drives. The focus 
of the drives shifts with maturation from oral satisfactions 
(sucking in the 1st yr of life), to anal sensations (holding on and 
letting go during the toddler years), oedipal drives (possessiveness 
toward a parent in the preschool years), and genital drives (in 
puberty and beyond) (see Table 6-2). At each stage, the child’s 
drive can potentially conflict with the rules of society. Infants may 
want to suck longer than the mother wants to nurse, or toddlers 
may decide that they like making a mess. The emotional health 
of both the child and the adult depends on adequate resolution 
of these conflicts. Freud saw middle childhood as a period of 
latency, when the sexual drive is redirected (sublimated) to the 
achievement of social or external goals.
Freudian ideas have been challenged. Few believe that the 
manner of toilet training permanently shapes personality, and 
middle childhood is no longer seen as conflict-free. Moreover, the 
effectiveness of psychoanalytic therapy has been difficult to dem-
onstrate empirically. Nonetheless, the Freudian legacy includes 
concepts that are central to an understanding of emotional devel-
opment: the importance of a child’s inner life and sexuality, the 
normative existence of emotional conflict during childhood, and 
the possibility that emotional disturbance can have early roots.
Erikson’s chief contribution was to recast Freud’s stages in 
terms of the emerging personality (see Table 6-2). The child’s 
sense of basic trust develops through the successful negotiation 
of infantile needs, corresponding to Freud’s oral period. As chil-
dren progress through these psychosocial stages, different issues 
become salient. Thus, it is predictable that a toddler will be preoc-
cupied with establishing a sense of autonomy, whereas a late 
adolescent may be more focused on establishing meaningful rela-
tionships and an occupational identity. Erikson recognized that 
these stages arise in the context of Western European societal 
expectations; in other cultures, the salient issues may be quite 
different.
Erikson’s work calls attention to the intrapersonal challenges 
facing children at different ages in a way that facilitates profes-
sional intervention. Knowing that the salient issue for school-
aged children is industry vs inferiority, pediatricians know to 
inquire about a child’s experiences of mastery and failure and (if 
necessary) suggest ways to ensure adequate successes.
Cognitive Theories  Cognitive development is best understood 
through the work of Piaget. A central tenet of Piaget’s work is 
that cognition changes in quality, not just quantity (see Table 
6-2). During the sensorimotor stage, an infant’s thinking is tied 
to immediate sensations and a child’s ability to manipulate 
objects. The concept of “in” is embodied in a child’s act of 
putting a block into a cup. With the arrival of language, the 
nature of thinking changes dramatically; symbols increasingly 
take the place of objects and actions. Piaget described how chil-
dren actively construct knowledge for themselves through the 
linked processes of assimilation (taking in new experiences 
according to existing schemata) and accommodation (creating 
new patterns of understanding to adapt to new information). In 
this way, children are continually and actively reorganizing cog-
nitive processes.
Piaget’s basic concepts have held up well. Challenges have 
included questions about the timing of various stages and the 
extent to which context may affect conclusions about cognitive 
stage. Children’s understanding of cause and effect may be con-
siderably more advanced in the context of sibling relationships 
than in the manipulation and perception of inanimate objects. In 
many children, logical thinking appears well before puberty, the 
age postulated by Piaget. Of undeniable importance are Piaget’s 
focus on cognition as a subject of empirical study, the universality 
of the progression of cognitive stages, and the image of a child 
as actively and creatively interpreting the world.
Piaget’s work is of special importance to pediatricians for 3 
reasons: (1) It helps make sense of many puzzling behaviors of 
infancy, such as the common exacerbation of sleep problems at 
9 and 18 mo of age. (2) Piaget’s observations often lend them-
selves to quick replication in the office, with little special equip-
ment. (3) Open-ended questioning, based on Piaget’s work, can 
provide insights into children’s understanding of illness and 
hospitalization.
Based on cognitive development, Kohlberg developed a theory 
of moral development in 6 stages from early childhood through 
adulthood. Preschoolers’ earliest sense of right and wrong is 
egocentric, motivated by externally applied controls. In later 
stages, children perceive equality, fairness, and reciprocity in their 
understanding of interpersonal interactions through perspective-
taking. Most youth will reach stage 4, conventional morality, by 
mid to late adolescence. The basic theory has been modified to 
distinguish morality from social conventions. Whereas moral 
thinking considers interpersonal interactions, justice, and human

welfare, social conventions are the agreed-on standards of behav-
ior particular to a social or cultural group. Within each stage of 
development, children are guided by the basic precepts of moral 
behavior, but also may take into account local standards, such 
as dress code, classroom behavior, and dating expectations.
Behavioral Theory  This theoretical perspective distinguishes 
itself by its lack of concern with a child’s inner experience. Its 
sole focus is on observable behaviors and measurable factors that 
either increase or decrease the frequency with which these behav-
iors occur. No stages are implied; children, adults, and indeed 
animals all respond in the same way. In its simplest form, the 
behaviorist orientation asserts that behaviors that are positively 
reinforced occur more frequently; behaviors that are negatively 
reinforced or ignored occur less frequently. The strengths of this 
position are its simplicity, wide applicability, and conduciveness 
to scientific verification. A behavioral approach lends itself to 
interventions for various common problems, such as temper tan-
trums and aggressive preschool behavior, in which behaviors are 
broken down into discrete units. In cognitively limited children 
and children with autism spectrum disorders, behavioral inter-
ventions using applied behavior analysis (ABA) approaches have 
demonstrated their ability to teach new, complex behaviors. ABA 
has been particularly useful in the treatment of early diagnosed 
autism (see Chapter 28.1). However, in cases in which misbehav-
ior is symptomatic of an underlying emotional, perceptual, or 
family problem, an exclusive reliance on behavior therapy risks 
leaving the cause untreated. Behavioral approaches can be taught 
to parents to apply at home.
Theories Commonly Employed in Behavioral Interventions 
During the past few decades an increasing number of programs 
(within and outside of the physician’s office) designed to influence 
behavior have been based on theoretical models of behavior. 
Some of these models are based on behavioral or cognitive theory 
or in cases have attributes of both. The most commonly employed 
models are the Health Belief Model, Theory of Reasoned Action, 
Theory of Planned Behavior, Social Cognitive Theory, and the 
Transtheoretical Model, also known as Stages of Change Theory. 
Pediatricians should be aware of these models; similarities and 
differences between these models are shown in Table 6-3. Moti-
vational interviewing is less a theory of behavior and more a 
technique to bring about behavior change. The goal in using the 
technique is to enhance an individual’s motivation to change 
behavior by exploring and removing ambivalence. This may be 
practiced by an individual practitioner and is being taught in 
some pediatric residency programs. Motivational interviewing 
emphasizes the importance of the therapist (pediatrician) under-
standing the client’s perspective and displaying unconditional 
support. The therapist is a partner rather than an authority figure 
and recognizes that ultimately the patient has control over his or 
her choices.
Statistics Used in Describing Growth and Development  
(See Also Chapters 13 and 14)
In everyday use, the term normal is synonymous with healthy. In 
a statistical sense, normal means that a set of values generates a 
normal (bell-shaped or gaussian) distribution. This is the case 
with anthropometric quantities, such as height and weight, and 
with many developmental milestones, such as the age of indepen-
dent standing. For a normally distributed measurement, a histo-
gram with the quantity (height, age) on the x-axis and the 
frequency (the number of children of that height, or the number 
who stand on their own at that age) on the y-axis generates a 
bell-shaped curve. In an ideal bell-shaped curve, the peak corre-
sponds to the arithmetic mean (average) of the sample and to the 
median and the mode as well. The median is the value above and 
below which 50% of the observations lie; the mode is the value 
having the highest number of observations. Distributions are 
termed skewed if the mean, median, and mode are not the same 
number.
The extent to which observed values cluster near the mean 
determines the width of the bell and can be described mathemati-
cally by the standard deviation (SD). In the ideal normal curve, 
a range of values extending from 1 SD below the mean to 1 SD 
above the mean includes approximately 68% of the values, and 
each “tail” above and below that range contains 16% of the 
values. A range encompassing ±2 SD includes 95% of the values 
(with the upper and lower tails each comprising approximately 
2.5% of the values), and ±3 SD encompasses 99.7% of the values 
(Table 6-4 and Fig. 6-4).
For any single measurement, its distance away from the mean 
can be expressed in terms of the number of SDs (also called a z 
score); one can then consult a table of the normal distribution to 
find out what percentage of measurements fall within that dis-
tance from the mean. Software to convert anthropometric data 
into z scores for epidemiologic purposes is available. A measure-
ment that falls “outside the normal range”—arbitrarily defined 
as 2, or sometimes 3, SDs on either side of the mean—is atypical, 
but not necessarily indicative of illness. The further a measure-
ment (say, height, weight, or IQ) falls from the mean, the greater 
the probability that it represents not simply normal variation, but 
rather a different, potentially pathologic, condition.
Another way of relating an individual to a group uses percen-
tiles. The percentile is the percentage of individuals in the group 
who have achieved a certain measured quantity (e.g., a height  
of 95 cm) or a developmental milestone (e.g., walking indepen-
dently). For anthropometric data, the percentile cutoffs can be 
calculated from the mean and SD. The 5th, 10th, and 25th per-
centiles correspond to −1.65 SD, −1.3 SD, and −0.7 SD, respec-
tively. Figure 6-4 demonstrates how frequency distributions of a 
particular parameter (height) at different ages relate to the per-
centile lines on the growth curve.

6.1  Assessment of Fetal Growth 
and Development
The most dramatic events in growth and development occur 
before birth and involve the transformation of a fertilized egg 
into an embryo and a fetus, the elaboration of the nervous system, 
and the emergence of behavior in utero. The psychologic changes 
occurring in the parents during the gestation profoundly impact 
the lives of all members of the family. The developing fetus is

affected by such social and environmental influences as maternal 
undernutrition; alcohol, cigarette, and drug use (both legal and

these forces and the somatic and neurologic transformations 
occurring in the fetus influence growth and behavior at birth, 
through infancy, and potentially throughout the individual’s life.

blastocyst). By 2 wk, implantation is complete and the uteropla-
cental circulation has begun; the embryo has 2 distinct layers, 
endoderm and ectoderm, and the amnion has begun to form. By 
3 wk, the 3rd primary germ layer (mesoderm) has appeared, 
along with a primitive neural tube and blood vessels. Paired heart 
tubes have begun to pump.
During wk 4-8, lateral folding of the embryologic plate, fol-
lowed by growth at the cranial and caudal ends and the budding 
of arms and legs, produces a human-like shape. Precursors of 
skeletal muscle and vertebrae (somites) appear, along with the 
branchial arches that will form the mandible, maxilla, palate, 
external ear, and other head and neck structures. Lens placodes 
appear, marking the site of future eyes; the brain grows rapidly. 
By the end of wk 8, as the embryonic period closes, the rudiments 
of all major organ systems have developed; the crown-rump 
length is 3 cm.
Fetal Period
From the 9th wk on (fetal period), somatic changes consist of 
rapid body growth as well as differentiation of tissues, organs, 
and organ systems. Changes in body proportion are depicted in 
Figure 6-5. By wk 10, the face is recognizably human. The midgut 
returns to the abdomen from the umbilical cord, rotating coun-
terclockwise to bring the stomach, small intestine, and large 
intestine into their normal positions. By wk 12, the gender of the 
external genitals becomes clearly distinguishable. Lung develop-
ment proceeds, with the budding of bronchi, bronchioles, and 
successively smaller divisions. By wk 20-24, primitive alveoli 
have formed and surfactant production has begun; before that 
time, the absence of alveoli renders the lungs useless as organs of 
gas exchange.
During the 3rd trimester, weight triples and length doubles as 
body stores of protein, fat, iron, and calcium increase.
Neurologic Development
During the 3rd wk, a neural plate appears on the ectodermal 
surface of the trilaminar embryo. Infolding produces a neural 
tube that will become the central nervous system (CNS) and a 
neural crest that will become the peripheral nervous system. 
Neuroectodermal cells differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, oli-
godendrocytes, and ependymal cells, whereas microglial cells are 
derived from mesoderm. By the 5th wk, the 3 main subdivisions 
of forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain are evident. The dorsal and 
ventral horns of the spinal cord have begun to form, along with 
the peripheral motor and sensory nerves. Myelinization begins at 
midgestation and continues through the 1st yr of life.
By the end of the embryonic period (wk 8), the gross structure 
of the nervous system has been established. On a cellular level, 
neurons migrate outward to form the 6 cortical layers. Migration 
is complete by the 6th mo, but differentiation continues. Axons 
and dendrites form synaptic connections at a rapid pace, making 
the CNS vulnerable to teratogenic or hypoxic influences through-
out gestation. Rates of increase in DNA (a marker of cell number), 
overall brain weight, and cholesterol (a marker of myelinization) 
are shown in Figure 6-6. The prenatal and postnatal peaks of 
DNA probably represent rapid growth of neurons and glia, 
respectively. By the time of birth, the structure of the brain is 
complete. Synapses will be pruned back substantially and new 
connections will be made, largely as a result of experience.
Behavioral Development
No behavioral evidence of neural function is detectable until the 
3rd month. Reflexive responses to tactile stimulation develop in 
a craniocaudal sequence. By wk 13-14, breathing and swallowing 
motions appear. The grasp reflex appears at 17 wk and is  
well developed by 27 wk. Eye opening occurs around 26 wk. 
By midgestation, the full range of neonatal movements can be 
observed.
During the 3rd trimester, fetuses respond to external stimuli 
with heart rate elevation and body movements (see Chapter 96).

P II-8   n  Part II  Growth, Development, and Behavior
As with infants in the postnatal period, reactivity to auditory 
(vibroacoustic) and visual (bright light) stimuli vary depending 
on their behavioral state, which can be characterized as quiet 
sleep, active sleep, or awake. Individual differences in the level 
of fetal activity are commonly noted by mothers and have been 
observed ultrasonographically. Fetal behavior is affected by 
maternal medications and diet, increasing after ingestion of caf-
feine. Behavior may be entrained to the mother’s diurnal rhythms: 
asleep during the day, active at night.
Fetal movement increases in response to a sudden auditory 
tone, but decreases after several repetitions. This demonstrates 
habituation, a basic form of learning in which repeated stimula-
tion results in a response decrement. If the tone changes in pitch, 
the movement increases again, evidence that the fetus distin-
guishes between a familiar, repeated tone and a novel one. Habit-
uation improves in older fetuses, and decreases in neurologically 
impaired or physically stressed fetuses. Similar responses to visual 
and tactile stimuli have been observed.
Psychologic Changes in Parents
Many psychologic changes occur during pregnancy. An unplanned 
pregnancy may be met with anger, denial, or depression. Ambiva-
lent feelings are the norm, whether or not the pregnancy was 
planned. Elation at the thought of producing a baby and the wish 
to be the perfect parent compete with fears of inadequacy and of 
the lifestyle changes that mothering will impose. Old conflicts 
may resurface as a woman psychologically identifies with her 
own mother and with herself as a child. The father-to-be faces 
similar mixed feelings, and problems in the parental relationship 
may intensify.
Tangible evidence that a fetus exists as a separate being, 
whether as a result of ultrasonic visualization or awareness of 
fetal movements (at approximately 20 wk), often heightens a 
woman’s feelings, both positive and negative. Parents worry 
about the fetus’s healthy development and mentally rehearse 
what they will do if the child is malformed. Reassurances based 
on ultrasound examinations or amniocentesis may not completely 
allay these fears. Toward the end of pregnancy, a woman becomes 
aware of patterns of fetal activity and reactivity and begins to 
ascribe to her fetus an individual personality and an ability to 
survive independently. Appreciation of the psychologic vulnera-

Chapter 7
The Newborn
John Olsson
The newborn (neonatal) period begins at birth (regardless of 
gestational age) and includes the 1st mo of life. During this time, 
marked physiologic transitions occur in all organ systems, and 
the infant learns to respond to many forms of external stimuli. 
Because infants thrive physically and psychologically only in the 
context of their social relationships, any description of the new-
born’s developmental status has to include consideration of the 
parents’ role as well.
Parental Role in Maternal-Infant Attachment
Parenting a newborn infant requires dedication because a new-
born’s needs are urgent, continuous, and often unclear. Parents 
must attend to an infant’s signals and respond empathically. 
Many factors influence parents’ ability to assume this role.
Prenatal Factors
Pregnancy is a period of psychologic preparation for the pro-
found demands of parenting. Women may experience ambiva-
lence, particularly (but not exclusively) if the pregnancy was 
unplanned. If financial worries, physical illness, prior miscar-
riages or stillbirths, or other crises interfere with psychologic 
bility of the expectant parents and of the powerful contribution 
of fetal behavior facilitates supportive clinical intervention.
threats to fetal develoPMent
Mortality and morbidity are highest during the prenatal period 
(see Chapter 87). An estimated 50% of all pregnancies end in 
spontaneous abortion, including approximately 10-25% of all 
clinically recognized pregnancies. The vast majority occur in the 
1st trimester. Some occur as a result of chromosomal or other 
abnormalities.
The association between an inadequate nutrient supply to the 
fetus with low birthweight has been recognized for decades; this 
adaptation on the part of the fetus to the inadequate supply 
presumably increases the likelihood that the fetus to survive until 
birth. Also recognized for decades is the fact that for any poten-
tial fetal insult, the extent and nature of its effects are determined 
by characteristics of the host as well as the dose and timing of 
the exposure. Inherited differences in the metabolism of ethanol 
may predispose certain individuals or groups to fetal alcohol 
syndrome. Organ systems are most vulnerable during periods of 
maximum growth and differentiation, generally during the 1st 
trimester (organogenesis). Figure 6-7 depicts sensitive periods 
during gestation for various organ systems. (See also http://www.
criticalwindows.com/go_display.php for a more detailed listing 
of critical periods and specific developmental abnormalities.)
Fetal adaptations or responses to an adverse situation in utero 
(referred to as fetal programming or developmental plasticity) 
have lifelong implications for the individual. Fetal programming 
may prepare the fetus for an environment that matches that 
experienced in utero. Fetal programming in response to some 
environmental and nutritional signals in utero increase the risk 
of cardiovascular, metabolic, and behavioral diseases in later life. 
These adverse long-term effects appear to represent a mismatch 
between fetal and neonatal environmental conditions and the 
conditions that the individual will confront later in life; a fetus 
deprived of adequate calories may or may not as a child or teen-
ager face famine. One proposed mechanism for fetal program-
ming is epigenetic imprinting, in which two genes are inherited 
but one is turned off through epigenetic modification (see Chapter 
75). Imprinted genes play a critical role in fetal growth and thus 
may be responsible for the subsequent lifelong effects on growth 
and related disorders.
Teratogens associated with gross physical and mental abnor-
malities include various infectious agents (toxoplasmosis, rubella, 
syphilis); chemical agents (mercury, thalidomide, antiepileptic 
medications, and ethanol), high temperature, and radiation (see 
Chapters 90 and 699).
Teratogenic effects may include not only gross physical mal-
formation but also decreased growth and cognitive or behavioral 
deficits that only become apparent later in life. Prenatal exposure 
to cigarette smoke is associated with lower birthweight, shorter 
length, and smaller head circumference, as well as decreased IQ 
and increased rates of learning disabilities. The effects of prenatal 
exposure to cocaine remain controversial and may be less dra-
matic than popularly believed. The effects include direct neuro-
toxic effects and effects mediated by reduced placental blood 
flow; associated risk factors include other prenatal exposures 
(alcohol and cigarettes used in large amounts by many cocaine-
addicted women) as well as “toxic” postnatal environments fre-
quently characterized by instability, multiple caregivers, and 
abuse and neglect (see Chapter 36).
Psychologic distress during pregnancy can have serious conse-
quences on the developing fetus through both maternal be-
haviors, including substance use, diminished appetite, or sleep 
disorder, and physiological changes involving the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system 
(ANS). Dysregulation of the HPA axis and ANS may explain  
the associations observed in some but not all studies between 
maternal distress and identified negative infant outcomes, includ-
ing low birthweight, spontaneous abortion, prematurity, and 
decreased head circumference. Infants born to mothers experienc-
ing high rates of depression or stress have been found to have 
delays in motor or mental development, or both, and in some 
studies higher levels of escape behaviors. Maternal anxiety 
between wk 12 and 22 but not wk 30 to 40 has been associated 
with increased rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (see 
Chapter 30), suggesting that there may be critical periods in fetal 
development especially sensitive to maternal stress. Although the 
mechanisms of the effect of maternal stress remain to be eluci-
dated, the attributable load of emotional and behavioral prob-
lems in the infant due to antenatal stress, anxiety, or both is 
estimated to be about 15%.

preparation, the neonate may not be welcomed. For adolescent 
mothers, the demand that they relinquish their own developmen-
tal agenda, such as an active social life, may be especially 
burdensome.
The early experience of being mothered may establish uncon-
sciously held expectations about nurturing relationships that 
permit mothers to “tune in” to their infants. These expectations 
are linked with the quality of later infant-parent interactions. 
Mothers whose early childhoods were marked by traumatic sepa-
rations, abuse, or neglect may find it especially difficult to provide 
consistent, responsive care. Instead, they may reenact their child-
hood experiences with their own infants as if unable to conceive 
of the mother-child relationship in any other way. Bonding may 
be adversely affected by several risk factors during pregnancy and 
in the postpartum period, which undermine the mother-child 
relationship and may threaten the infant’s cognitive and emo-
tional development (Table 7-1).
Social support during pregnancy, particularly support from 
the father and close family members, is also important. Con-
versely, conflict with or abandonment by the father during preg-
nancy may diminish the mother’s ability to become absorbed 
with her infant. Anticipation of an early return to work may 
make some women reluctant to fall in love with their babies due 
to anticipated separation. Returning to work should be delayed 
at least until after 6 wk, when feeding and basic behavioral 
adjustments have been established.
Many decisions have to be made by parents in anticipation of 
the birth of their child. The most important choice is that of how 
the infant will be nourished. Among the important benefits of 
breast-feeding is the role of promoting bonding. Providing breast-
feeding education for the parents at the prenatal visit by the 
pediatrician and by the obstetrician during prenatal care can 
increase maternal confidence in breast-feeding after delivery and 
reduce stress during the newborn period (see Chapter 42).
Peripartum and Postpartum Influences
The continuous presence during labor of a woman trained to 
offer friendly support and encouragement (a doula) results in 
shorter labor, fewer obstetric complications (including cesarean 
section), and reduced postpartum hospital stays. Early skin-to-
skin contact between mothers and infants immediately after birth 
may correlate with an increased rate and longer duration of 
breast-feeding. Most new parents value even a brief period of 
uninterrupted time in which to get to know their new infant, and 
increased mother-infant contact over the first days of life may 
improve long-term mother-child interactions. Nonetheless, early 
separation, although predictably very stressful, does not inevita-
bly impair a mother’s ability to bond with her infant. Early dis-
charge home from the maternity ward may undermine bonding, 
particularly when a new mother is required to resume full respon-
sibility for a busy household.
Postpartum depression may occur in the 1st week (up to 6 mo) 
after delivery and can adversely affect neonatal growth and devel-
opment. Screening methods are available for use during neonatal 
and infant visits to the pediatric provider. Referral for care will 
greatly accelerate recovery (see later).
The Infant’s Role in Maternal-Infant Attachment
The in utero environment contributes greatly but not completely 
to the future growth and development of the fetus. Abnormalities 
in maternal-fetal placental circulation and maternal glucose 
metabolism or the presence of maternal infection can result in 
abnormal fetal growth. Infants may be small or large for gesta-
tional age as a result. These abnormal growth patterns not only 
predispose infants to an increased requirement for medical inter-
vention but also may affect their ability to respond behaviorally 
to their parents.
Physical Examination
Examination of the newborn should include an evaluation of 
growth and an observation of behavior. The average term 
newborn weighs approximately 3.4 kg (7 12 lb); boys are slightly 
heavier than girls are. Average weight does vary by ethnicity and 
SES. The average length and head circumference are about 50 cm 
(20 in) and 35 cm (14 in), respectively, in term infants. Each 
newborn’s growth parameters should be plotted on growth 
curves specific for that infant’s gestational age to determine the 
appropriateness of size. Likewise specific growth charts for condi-
tions associated with variations in growth patterns have also been 
developed. The infant’s response to being examined may be 
useful in assessing its vigor, alertness, and tone. Observing how 
the parents handle their infant, their comfort and affection, is 
also important. The order of the physical examination should be 
from the least to the most intrusive maneuver. Assessing visual 
tracking and response to sound and noting changes of tone with 
level of activity and alertness are very helpful. Performing this 
examination and sharing impression with parents is an important 
opportunity to facilitate bonding (see Chapter 94).
Interactional Abilities
Soon after birth, neonates are alert and ready to interact and 
nurse. This first alert-awake period may be affected by maternal 
analgesics and anesthetics or fetal hypoxia. Neonates are near-
sighted, having a fixed focal length of 8-12 in, approximately the 
distance from the breast to the mother’s face, as well as an inborn 
visual preference for faces. Hearing is well developed, and infants 
preferentially turn toward a female voice. These innate abilities 
and predilections increase the likelihood that when a mother 
gazes at her newborn, the baby will gaze back. The initial period 
of social interaction, usually lasting about 40 min, is followed by 
a period of somnolence. After that, briefer periods of alertness or 
excitation alternate with sleep. If a mother misses her baby’s first 
alert-awake period, she may not experience as long a period of 
social interaction for several days. Neuroimaging studies indicate 
that the hypothalamic-midbrain-limbic-paralimbic-cortical circuit 
of the parents interact to support responses to the infants that 
are critical for effective parenting (e.g., emotion, attention, moti-
vation, empathy, and decision-making).
Modulation of Arousal
Adaptation to extrauterine life requires rapid and profound phys-
iologic changes, including aeration of the lungs, rerouting of the 
circulation, and activation of the intestinal tract. The necessary 
behavioral changes are no less profound. To obtain nourishment, 
to avoid hypo- and hyperthermia, and to ensure safety, neonates 
must react appropriately to an expanded range of sensory stimuli. 
Infants must become aroused in response to stimulation, but not

so overaroused that their behavior becomes disorganized. Under-
aroused infants are not able to feed and interact; overaroused 
infants show signs of autonomic instability, including flushing or 
mottling, perioral pallor, hiccupping, vomiting, uncontrolled 
limb movements, and inconsolable crying.
Behavioral States
The organization of infant behavior into discrete behavioral 
states may reflect an infant’s inborn ability to regulate arousal. 
Six states have been described: quiet sleep, active sleep, drowsy, 
alert, fussy, and crying. In the alert state, infants visually fixate 
on objects or faces and follow them horizontally and (within a 
month) vertically; they also reliably turn toward a novel sound, 
as if searching for its source. When overstimulated, they may 
calm themselves by looking away, yawning, or sucking on their 
lips or hands, thereby increasing parasympathetic activity and 
reducing sympathetic nervous activity. The behavioral state deter-
mines an infant’s muscle tone, spontaneous movement, electro-
encephalogram pattern, and response to stimuli. In active sleep, 
an infant may show progressively less reaction to a repeated heel 
stick (habituation), whereas in the drowsy state, the same stimu-
lus may push a child into fussing or crying.
Mutual Regulation
Parents actively participate in an infant’s state regulation, alter-
nately stimulating and soothing. In turn, they are regulated by

P II-12   n  Part II  Growth, Development, and Behavior
Advances in imaging permit us to understand the anatomic and 
physiologic correlates of the physical growth, maturation, acqui-
sition of competence, and psychologic reorganization that char-
acterizes infancy and radically change the infant’s behavior and 
social relationships. Some activities previously thought to be 
“primitive” or “reflexive” result from complex systems. Swallow-
ing, rather than a simple reflex, results from a complex highly 
coordinated process involving multiple levels of neural control 
distributed among several physiologic systems whose nature and 
relationships mature throughout the 1st year of life. Substantial 
learning of the basic tools of language (phonology, word segmen-
tation) occurs during infancy. Speech processing in older indi-
viduals requires defined and precise neuronal networks; imaging 
studies have revealed that the infant brain possesses a structural 
and functional organization similar to that of adults, leading to 
the belief that structural neurologic processing of speech may 
guide infants to discover the properties of his or her native lan-
guage. Myelination of the cortex begins at 8 mo gestation and is 
nearly complete by age 2 yr; much of this process occurs during 
infancy. Given the importance of iron and other nutrients in 
myelination, adequate stores throughout infancy are critical (see 
Chapter 42). Inadequate dietary intake, insufficient interactions 
with caregivers, or both may alter experience-dependent pro-
cesses that are critical to brain structure development and func-
tion during infancy. Although some of these processes may be 
delayed, as the periods of plasticity close during the rapid devel-
opmental changes occurring in infancy, more permanent deficits 
may result.
The infant acquires new competences in all developmental 
domains. The concept of developmental trajectories recognizes 
that complex skills build on simpler ones; it is also important to 
realize how development in each domain affects functioning in

the infant’s signals, responding to cries of hunger with a letdown 
of milk (or with a bottle). Such interactions constitute a system 
directed toward furthering the infant’s physiologic homeostasis 
and physical growth. At the same time, they form the basis for 
the emerging psychologic relationship between parent and child. 
Infants come to associate the presence of the parent with the 
pleasurable reduction of tension (as in feeding) and show this 
preference by calming more quickly for their mother than for a 
stranger. This response, in turn, strengthens a mother’s sense of 
efficacy and her connection with her baby.
iMPlications for the Pediatrician
The pediatrician can support healthy newborn development in 
several ways.
Optimal Practices
A prenatal pediatric visit allows pediatricians to assess potential 
threats to bonding (a tense spousal relationship) and sources of 
social support. Supportive hospital policies include the use of 
birthing rooms rather than operating suites and delivery rooms; 
encouragement for the father or a trusted relative or friend to 
remain with the mother during labor or the provision of a profes-
sional doula; the practice of giving the newborn infant to the 
mother immediately after drying and a brief assessment; place-
ment of the newborn in the mother’s room rather than in a 
central nursery; and avoiding in-hospital distribution of infant 
formula. Such policies (Baby Friendly Hospital) have been shown 
to significantly increase breast-feeding rates (see Chapter 94). 
After discharge, home visits by nurses and lactation counselors 
can reduce early feeding problems and identify emerging medical 
conditions in either mother or baby. Infants requiring transport 
to another hospital should be brought to see the mother first, if 
at all possible. On discharge home, fathers can shield mothers 
from unnecessary visits and calls and take over household duties, 
allowing mothers and infants time to get to know each other 
without distractions. The first office visit should occur during  
the first 2 wk after discharge to determine how smoothly the 
mother and infant are making the transition to life at home. 
Babies who are discharged early, those who are breast-feeding, 
and those who are at risk for jaundice should be seen 1 to 3 days 
after discharge.
Assessing Parent-Infant Interactions
During a feeding or when infants are alert and face-to-face with 
their parents, it is normal for them to appear absorbed in one 
another. Infants who become overstimulated by the mother’s 
voice or activity may turn away or close their eyes, leading to a 
premature termination of the encounter. Alternatively, the infant 
may be ready to interact, whereas the mother may appear preoc-
cupied. Asking a new mother about her own emotional state, and 
inquiring specifically about a history of depression, facilitates 
referral for therapy, which may provide long-term benefits to the 
child. Pediatricians may detect postpartum depression using the 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at well child visits 
during the first year (Table 7-2).
Teaching About Individual Competencies
The Newborn Behavior Assessment Scale (NBAS) provides a 
formal measure of an infant’s neurodevelopmental competencies, 
including state control, autonomic reactivity, reflexes, habitua-
tion, and orientation toward auditory and visual stimuli. This 
examination can also be used to demonstrate to parents an 
infant’s capabilities and vulnerabilities. Parents might learn that 
they need to undress their infant to increase the level of arousal 
or to swaddle the infant to reduce overstimulation by containing 
random arm movements. The NBAS can be used to support the 
development of positive early parent-infant relationships. Dem-
onstration of the NBAS to parents in the 1st wk of life has been 
shown to correlate with improvements in the caretaking environ-
ment months later.

all of the others. Physical growth parameters and normal ranges 
for attainable weight, length, and head circumference are found 
in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts 
(see Figs. 9-1 and 9-2 on website). Table 8-1 presents an overview 
of key milestones by domain; Table 8-2 presents similar informa-
tion arranged by age. Parents often seek information about 
“normal development” during this period and should be directed 
to reliable sources, including the American Academy of Pediatrics 
website.
Age 0-2 Months
At birth in the full-term infant, myelination is present in the 
cerebellar hemisphere, the internal capsule, the corpus callosum, 
and parts of the subcortical white matter of the parietal, poste-
rior, frontal, temporal, and calcarine cortex. In this period, the 
infant experiences tremendous growth. Physiologic changes allow 
the establishment of effective feeding routines and a predictable 
sleep-wake cycle. The social interactions that occur as parents 
and infants accomplish these tasks lay the foundation for cogni-
tive and emotional development.
Physical Development
A newborn’s weight may initially decrease 10% below birth-
weight in the 1st wk as a result of excretion of excess extravas-
cular fluid and limited nutritional intake. Nutrition improves as 
colostrum is replaced by higher-fat breast milk, as infants learn 
to latch on and suck more efficiently, and as mothers become 
more comfortable with feeding techniques. Infants regain or 
exceed birthweight by 2 wk of age and should grow at approxi-
mately 30 g (1 oz)/day during the 1st mo (see Table 13-1). This 
is the period of fastest postnatal growth. Limb movements consist 
largely of uncontrolled writhing, with apparently purposeless 
opening and closing of the hands. Smiling occurs involuntarily. 
Eye gaze, head turning, and sucking are under better control and 
thus can be used to demonstrate infant perception and cognition. 
An infant’s preferential turning toward the mother’s voice is 
evidence of recognition memory.
Six behavioral states have been described (see Chapter 7). 
Initially, sleep and wakefulness are evenly distributed throughout 
the 24-hr day (Fig. 8-1). Neurologic maturation accounts for the 
consolidation of sleep into blocks of 5 or 6 hr at night, with brief 
awake, feeding periods. Learning also occurs; infants whose 
parents are consistently more interactive and stimulating during 
the day learn to concentrate their sleeping during the night.
Cognitive Development
Infants can differentiate among patterns, colors, and consonants. 
They can recognize facial expressions (smiles) as similar, even 
when they appear on different faces. They also can match abstract 
properties of stimuli, such as contour, intensity, or temporal 
pattern, across sensory modalities. Infants at 2 mo of age can 
discriminate rhythmic patterns in native vs non-native language. 
Infants appear to seek stimuli actively, as though satisfying an 
innate need to make sense of the world. These phenomena point 
to the integration of sensory inputs in the central nervous system. 
Caretaking activities provide visual, tactile, olfactory, and audi-
tory stimuli; all of these support the development of cognition. 
Infants habituate to the familiar, attending less to repeated stimuli 
and increasing their attention to novel stimuli.
Emotional Development
The infant is dependent on the environment to meet his or her 
needs. The consistent availability of a trusted adult to meet the 
infant’s urgent needs creates the conditions for secure attachment. 
Basic trust vs mistrust, the first of Erikson’s psychosocial stages, 
depends on attachment and reciprocal maternal bonding. Crying 
occurs in response to stimuli that may be obvious (a soiled 
diaper), but are often obscure. Infants who are consistently

picked up and held in response to distress cry less at 1 yr and 
show less aggressive behavior at 2 yr. Cross-cultural studies show 
that in societies in which infants are carried close to the mother, 
babies cry less than in societies in which babies are only periodi-
cally carried. Crying normally peaks at about 6 wk of age, when 
healthy infants may cry up to 3 hr/day, then decreases to 1 hr or 
less by 3 mo.
The emotional significance of any experience depends on both 
the individual child’s temperament and the parent’s responses 
(see Table 6-1); differing feeding schedules produce differing 
reactions. Hunger generates increasing tension; as the urgency 
peaks, the infant cries, the parent offers the breast or bottle and 
the tension dissipates. Infants fed “on demand” consistently 
experience this link between their distress, the arrival of the

parent, and relief from hunger. Most infants fed on a fixed sched-
ule quickly adapt their hunger cycle to the schedule. Those who 
cannot because they are temperamentally prone to irregular bio-
logic rhythms experience periods of unrelieved hunger as well as 
unwanted feedings when they already feel full. Similarly, infants 
who are fed at the parents’ convenience, with neither attention 
to the infant’s hunger cues nor a fixed schedule may not consis-
tently experience feeding as the pleasurable reduction of tension. 
These infants often show increased irritability and physiologic 
instability (spitting, diarrhea, poor weight gain) as well as later 
behavioral problems.
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
Success or failure in establishing feeding and sleep cycles deter-
mines parents’ feelings of efficacy. When things go well, the 
parents’ anxiety and ambivalence, as well as the exhaustion of 
the early weeks, decrease. Infant issues (colic) or familial conflict 
will prevent this from occurring. With physical recovery from 
delivery and endocrinologic normalization, the mild postpartum 
depression that affects many mothers passes. If the mother con-
tinues to feel sad, overwhelmed, and anxious, the possibility  
of moderate to severe postpartum depression, found in 10% of 
postpartum women, needs to be considered. Major depression 
that arises during pregnancy or in the postpartum period threat-
ens the mother-child relationship and is a risk factor for later 
cognitive and behavioral problems. The pediatrician may be  
the first professional to encounter the depressed mother and 
should be instrumental in assisting her in seeking treatment (see 
Chapter 7).
Age 2-6 Months
At about 2 mo, the emergence of voluntary (social) smiles and 
increasing eye contact mark a change in the parent-child relation-
ship, heightening the parents’ sense of being loved reciprocally. 
During the next months, an infant’s range of motor and social 
control and cognitive engagement increases dramatically. Mutual 
regulation takes the form of complex social interchanges, result-
ing in strong mutual attachment and enjoyment. Parents are less 
fatigued.
Physical Development
Between 3 and 4 mo of age, the rate of growth slows to approxi-
mately 20 g/day (see Table 13-1 and Figs. 9-1 and 9-2). By 4 mo, 
birthweight is doubled. Early reflexes that limited voluntary 
movement recede. Disappearance of the asymmetric tonic neck 
reflex means that infants can begin to examine objects in the 
midline and manipulate them with both hands (see Chapter 584). 
Waning of the early grasp reflex allows infants both to hold 
objects and to let them go voluntarily. A novel object may elicit 
purposeful, although inefficient, reaching. The quality of sponta-
neous movements also changes, from larger writhing to smaller, 
circular movements that have been described as “fidgety.” Abnor-
mal or absent fidgety movements may constitute a risk factor for 
later neurologic abnormalities.
Increasing control of truncal flexion makes intentional rolling 
possible. Once infants can hold their heads steady while sitting, 
they can gaze across at things rather than merely looking up  
at them, and can begin taking food from a spoon. At the same 
time, maturation of the visual system allows greater depth 
perception.
In this period, infants achieve stable state regulation and 
regular sleep-wake cycles. Total sleep requirements are approxi-
mately 14-16 hr/24 hr, with about 9-10 hr concentrated at night 
and 2 naps/day. About 70% of infants sleep for a 6-8 hr stretch 
by age 6 mo (see Fig. 8-1). By 4-6 mo, the sleep electroencepha-
logram shows a mature pattern, with demarcation of rapid eye 
movement (REM) and 4 stages of non-REM sleep. The sleep cycle 
remains shorter than in adults (50-60 min vs approximately 
90 min). As a result, infants arouse to light sleep or wake fre-
quently during the night, setting the stage for behavioral sleep 
problems (see Chapter 17).
Cognitive Development
The overall effect of these developments is a qualitative change. 
At 4 mo of age, infants are described as “hatching” socially, 
becoming interested in a wider world. During feeding, infants no 
longer focus exclusively on the mother, but become distracted. 
In the mother’s arms, the infant may literally turn around, prefer-
ring to face outward.
Infants at this age also explore their own bodies, staring 
intently at their hands, vocalizing, blowing bubbles, and touching 
their ears, cheeks, and genitals. These explorations represent an 
early stage in the understanding of cause and effect as infants 
learn that voluntary muscle movements generate predictable 
tactile and visual sensations. They also have a role in the emer-
gence of a sense of self, separate from the mother. This is the first 
stage of personality development. Infants come to associate 
certain sensations through frequent repetition. The propriocep-
tive feeling of holding up the hand and wiggling the fingers 
always accompanies the sight of the fingers moving. Such self 
sensations are consistently linked and reproducible at will. In 
contrast, sensations that are associated with “other” occur with 
less regularity and in varying combinations. The sound, smell, 
and feel of the mother sometimes appear promptly in response 
to crying, but sometimes do not. The satisfaction that the mother 
or another loving adult provides continues the process of 
attachment.
Emotional Development and Communication
Babies interact with increasing sophistication and range. The 
primary emotions of anger, joy, interest, fear, disgust, and sur-
prise appear in appropriate contexts as distinct facial expressions.

School of Public Health, Boston, MA. Compiled by Lieb, Buehl, and Pyle.
When face-to-face, the infant and a trusted adult can match affec-
tive expressions (smiling or surprise) about 30% of the time. 
Initiating games (facial imitation, singing, hand games) increases 
social development. Such face-to-face behavior reveals the infant’s 
ability to share emotional states, the first step in the development 
of communication. Infants of depressed parents show a different 
pattern, spending less time in coordinated movement with their 
parents and making fewer efforts to re-engage. Rather than 
anger, they show sadness and a loss of energy when the parents 
continue to be unavailable.
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
Motor and sensory maturation makes infants at 3-6 mo exciting 
and interactive. Some parents experience their 4 mo old child’s 
outward turning as a rejection, secretly fearing that their infants 
no longer love them. For most parents, this is a happy period. 
Most parents excitedly report that they can hold conversations 
with their infants, taking turns vocalizing and listening. Pediatri-
cians share in the enjoyment, as the baby coos, makes eye contact, 
and moves rhythmically. If this visit does not feel joyful and 
relaxed, causes such as social stress, family dysfunction, parental 
mental illness, or problems in the infant-parent relationship 
should be considered. Parents can be reassured that responding 
to an infant’s emotional needs cannot spoil him or her. Giving 
vaccines and drawing blood while the child is seated on the par-
ent’s lap or nursing at the breast increases pain tolerance.
Age 6-12 Months
With achievement of the sitting position, increased mobility, and 
new skills to explore the world around them, 6-12 mo old infants 
show advances in cognitive understanding and communication, 
and there are new tensions around the themes of attachment and 
separation. Infants develop will and intentions, characteristics 
that most parents welcome, but still find challenging to manage.
Physical Development
Growth slows more (see Table 13-1 and Figs. 9-1 and 9-2). By 
the 1st birthday, birthweight has tripled, length has increased by 
50%, and head circumference has increased by 10 cm. The ability 
to sit unsupported (6-7 mo) and to pivot while sitting (around 
9-10 mo) provides increasing opportunities to manipulate several 
objects at a time and to experiment with novel combinations of 
objects. These explorations are aided by the emergence of a 
thumb-finger grasp (8-9 mo) and a neat pincer grasp by 12 mo. 
Many infants begin crawling and pulling to stand around 8 mo, 
followed by cruising. Some walk by 1 yr. Motor achievements 
correlate with increasing myelinization and cerebellar growth. 
These gross motor skills expand infants’ exploratory range and 
create new physical dangers as well as opportunities for learning. 
Tooth eruption occurs, usually starting with the mandibular 
central incisors. Tooth development reflects skeletal maturation 
and bone age, although there is wide individual variation (see 
Chapter 299).
Cognitive Development
The 6 mo old infant has discovered his hands and will soon learn 
to manipulate objects. At first, everything goes into the mouth. 
In time, novel objects are picked up, inspected, passed from hand 
to hand, banged, dropped, and then mouthed. Each action rep-
resents a nonverbal idea about what things are for (in Piagetian 
terms, a schema). The complexity of an infant’s play, how many 
different schemata are brought to bear, is a useful index of cogni-
tive development at this age. The pleasure, persistence, and 
energy with which infants tackle these challenges suggest the 
existence of an intrinsic drive or mastery motivation. Mastery 
behavior occurs when infants feel secure; those with less secure 
attachments show limited experimentation and less competence.
A major milestone is the achievement at about 9 mo of object 
permanence (constancy), the understanding that objects continue 
to exist, even when not seen. At 4-7 mo of age, infants look down 
for a yarn ball that has been dropped but quickly give up if it is 
not seen. With object constancy, infants persist in searching. They 
will find objects hidden under a cloth or behind the examiner’s 
back. Peek-a-boo brings unlimited pleasure as the child magically 
brings back the other player. Events seem to occur as a result of 
the child’s own activities.

Chapter 9  The Second Year  n  P II-17
The child’s sense of self and others are shaped by the skills emerg-
ing in the 2nd yr of life. Although the ability to walk allows sepa-
ration and newly found independence; the child continues to need 
secure attachment to the parents. At approximately 18 mo of age, 
the emergence of symbolic thought and language causes a reor-
ganization of behavior, with implications across many develop-
mental domains.
Age 12-18 Months
Physical Development
Toddlers have relatively short legs and long torsos, with exagger-
ated lumbar lordosis and protruding abdomens. Although slower 
than in the 1st yr, considerable brain growth occurs in the 2nd 
yr; this growth and continuing myelinization, results in an 
increase in head circumference of 2 cm over the year.
Most children begin to walk independently near their 1st 
birthday; some do not walk until 15 mo of age. Early walking is 
not associated with advanced development in other domains. 
Infants initially toddle with a wide-based gait, with the knees bent 
and the arms flexed at the elbow; the entire torso rotates with 
each stride; the toes may point in or out, and the feet strike the 
floor flat. The appearance is that of genu varus (bowleg). Subse-
quent refinement leads to greater steadiness and energy efficiency. 
After several months of practice, the center of gravity shifts back 
and the torso stays more stable, while the knees extend and the 
arms swing at the sides for balance. The feet are held in better 
alignment, and the child is able to stop, pivot, and stoop without 
toppling over (see Chapters 664 and 665).
Cognitive Development
Exploration of the environment increases in parallel with 
improved dexterity (reaching, grasping, releasing) and mobility. 
Learning follows the precepts of Piaget’s sensory-motor stage. 
Toddlers manipulate objects in novel ways to create interesting 
effects, such as stacking blocks or putting things into a computer 
disk drive. Playthings are also more likely to be used for their 
Chapter 9
The Second Year
Susan Feigelman

Emotional Development
The advent of object permanence corresponds with qualitative 
changes in social and communicative development. Infants look 
back and forth between an approaching stranger and a parent, 
and may cling or cry anxiously, demonstrating stranger anxiety. 
Separations often become more difficult. Infants who have been 
sleeping through the night for months begin to awaken regularly 
and cry, as though remembering that the parents are in the next 
room.
A new demand for autonomy also emerges. Poor weight gain 
at this age often reflects a struggle between an infant’s emerging 
independence and parent’s control of the feeding situation. Use 
of the 2-spoon method of feeding (1 for the child and 1 for the 
parent), finger foods, and a high chair with a tray table can avert 
potential problems. Tantrums make their first appearance as the 
drives for autonomy and mastery come in conflict with parental 
controls and the infants’ still-limited abilities.
Communication
Infants at 7 mo of age are adept at nonverbal communication, 
expressing a range of emotions and responding to vocal tone and 
facial expressions. Around 9 mo of age, infants become aware 
that emotions can be shared between people; they show parents 
toys as a way of sharing their happy feelings. Between 8 and 
10 mo of age, babbling takes on a new complexity, with many 
syllables (“ba-da-ma”) and inflections that mimic the native lan-
guage. Infants now lose the ability to distinguish between vocal 
sounds that are undifferentiated in their native language. Social 
interaction (attentive adults taking turns vocalizing with the 
infant) profoundly influences the acquisition and production of 
new sounds. The first true word (i.e., a sound used consistently 
to refer to a specific object or person) appears in concert with an 
infant’s discovery of object permanence. Picture books now 
provide an ideal context for verbal language acquisition. With a 
familiar book as a shared focus of attention, a parent and child 
engage in repeated cycles of pointing and labeling, with elabora-
tion and feedback by the parent.
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
With the developmental reorganization that occurs around 9 mo 
of age, previously resolved issues of feeding and sleeping re-
emerge. Pediatricians can prepare parents at the 6 mo visit so that 
these problems can be understood as the result of developmental 
progress and not regression. Parents should be encouraged to 
plan ahead for necessary, and inevitable, separations (e.g., baby 
sitter, daycare). Routine preparations may make these separa-
tions easier. Introduction of a transitional object may allow the 
infant to self-comfort in the parents’ absence. The object cannot 
have any potential for asphyxiation or strangulation.
Infants’ wariness of strangers often makes the 9 mo examina-
tion difficult, particularly if the infant is temperamentally prone 
to react negatively to unfamiliar situations. Initially, the pediatri-
cian should avoid direct eye contact with the child. Time spent 
talking with the parent and introducing the child to a small, 
washable toy will be rewarded with more cooperation. The 
examination can be continued on the parent’s lap when 
feasible.

intended purposes (combs for hair, cups for drinking). Imitation 
of parents and older children is an important mode of learning. 
Make-believe (symbolic) play centers on the child’s own body 
(pretending to drink from an empty cup) (Table 9-1; also see 
Table 8-1).
Emotional Development
Infants who are approaching the developmental milestone of 
taking their first steps may be irritable. Once they start walking, 
their predominant mood changes markedly. Toddlers are 
described as “intoxicated” or “giddy” with their new ability and 
with the power to control the distance between themselves and 
their parents. Exploring toddlers orbit around their parents, 
moving away and then returning for a reassuring touch before 
moving away again. A securely attached child will use the parent 
as a secure base from which to explore independently. Proud of 
her or his accomplishments, the child illustrates Erikson’s stage 
of autonomy and separation. The toddler who is overly con-
trolled and discouraged from active exploration will feel doubt, 
shame, anger, and insecurity. All children will experience tan-
trums, reflecting their inability to delay gratification, suppress 
or displace anger, or verbally communicate their emotional 
states. The quality of the maternal-child relationship may mod-
erate negative effects of child care arrangements when parents 
work.
Linguistic Development
Receptive language precedes expressive language. By the time 
infants speak their first words around 12 mo of age, they already 
respond appropriately to several simple statements, such as “no,” 
“bye-bye,” and “give me.” By 15 mo, the average child points to 
major body parts and uses 4-6 words spontaneously and cor-
rectly. Toddlers also enjoy polysyllabic jargoning (see Tables 8-1 
and 9-1), but do not seem upset that no one understands. Most 
communication of wants and ideas continues to be nonverbal.
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
Parents may express concern about poor intake as growth slows. 
The growth chart should provide reassurance. Parents who 
cannot recall any other milestone tend to remember when their 
child began to walk, perhaps because of the symbolic significance 
of walking as an act of independence. All toddlers should be 
encouraged to explore their environments; a child’s ability to 
wander out of sight also increases the risks of injury and the need 
for supervision.
In the office setting, many toddlers are comfortable exploring 
the examination room, but cling to the parents under the stress 
of the examination. Performing most of the physical examination 
in the parent’s lap may help allay fears of separation. Infants who 
become more, not less, distressed in their parents’ arms or who 
avoid their parents at times of stress may be insecurely attached. 
Young children who, when distressed, turn to strangers rather 
than parents for comfort are particularly worrisome. The con-
flicts between independence and security manifest in issues of 
discipline, temper tantrums, toilet training, and changing feeding 
behaviors. Parents should be counseled on these matters within 
the framework of normal development.
Age 18-24 Months
Physical Development
Motor development is incremental at this age, with improvements 
in balance and agility and the emergence of running and stair 
climbing. Height and weight increase at a steady rate during this 
year, with a gain of 5 in and 5 lb. By 24 mo, children are about 
12 o­f their ultimate adult height. Head growth slows slightly (Figs. 
9-1 and 9-2; see also Table 13-1). Ninety percent of adult head 
circumference is achieved by age 2 yr, with just an additional 
5 cm gain over the next few years.

*Data derived from those of Gesell (as revised by Knobloch), Shirley, Provence, Wolf, Bailey, 
and others. After 5 yr, the Stanford-Binet, Wechsler-Bellevue, and other scales offer the most 
precise estimates of developmental level. To have their greatest value, they should be 
administered only by an experienced and qualified person.

Chapter 10
The Preschool Years
Susan Feigelman
The critical milestones for children ages 2 to 5 yr are the emer-
gence of language and exposure of children to an expanding 
social sphere. As toddlers, children learn to walk away and come 
back to the secure adult or parent. As preschoolers, they explore 
emotional separation, alternating between stubborn opposition 
and cheerful compliance, between bold exploration and clinging 
dependence. Increasing time spent in classrooms and playgrounds 
challenges a child’s ability to adapt to new rules and relation-
ships. Preschool children know that they can do more than ever 
before, but they also are increasingly cognizant of the constraints 
imposed on them by the adult world and their own limited 
abilities.
Physical Development
Somatic and brain growth slows by the end of the 2nd yr of life, 
with corresponding decreases in nutritional requirements and 
appetite, and the emergence of “picky” eating habits (see Table 
15-1). Increases of ~2 kg (4-5 lb) in weight and 7-8 cm (2-3 in) 
in height per yr are expected. Birthweight quadruples by 212 yr 
of age. An average 4 yr old weighs 40 lb and is 40 in tall. The

Cognitive Development
At approximately 18 mo of age, several cognitive changes come 
together to mark the conclusion of the sensory-motor period. 
These can be observed during self-initiated play. Object perma-
nence is firmly established; toddlers anticipate where an object 
will end up, even though the object was not visible while it was 
being moved. Cause and effect are better understood, and tod-
dlers demonstrate flexibility in problem solving (e.g., using a stick 
to obtain a toy that is out of reach, figuring out how to wind a 
mechanical toy). Symbolic transformations in play are no longer 
tied to the toddler’s own body, so that a doll can be “fed” from 
an empty plate. Like the reorganization that occurs at 9 mo, the 
cognitive changes at 18 mo correlate with important changes in 
the emotional and linguistic domains (see Table 9-1).
Emotional Development
In many children, the relative independence of the preceding 
period gives way to increased clinginess around 18 mo. This 
stage, described as “rapprochement,” may be a reaction to 
growing awareness of the possibility of separation. Many parents 
report that they cannot go anywhere without having a small child 
attached to them. Separation anxiety will be manifest at bedtime. 
Many children use a special blanket or stuffed toy as a transi-
tional object, which functions as a symbol of the absent parent. 
The transitional object remains important until the transition to 
symbolic thought has been completed and the symbolic presence 
of the parent has been fully internalized. Despite the attachment 
to the parent, the child’s use of “no” is a way of declaring inde-
pendence. Individual differences in temperament, in both the 
child and the parents play a critical role in determining the 
balance of conflict vs cooperation in the parent-child relationship. 
As effective language emerges, conflicts become less frequent.
Self-conscious awareness and internalized standards of behav-
ior first appear at this age. Toddlers looking in a mirror will, for 
the first time, reach for their own face rather than the mirror 
image if they notice something unusual on their nose. They begin 
to recognize when toys are broken and may hand them to their 
parents to fix. When tempted to touch a forbidden object, they 
may tell themselves “no, no.” Language becomes a means of 
impulse control, early reasoning, and connection between ideas. 
This is the very beginning of the formation of a conscience. The 
fact that they often go on to touch the object anyway demon-
strates the relative weakness of internalized inhibitions at this 
stage.
Linguistic Development
Perhaps the most dramatic developments in this period are lin-
guistic. Labeling of objects coincides with the advent of symbolic 
thought. After the realization that words can stand for things 
occurs, a child’s vocabulary balloons from 10-15 words at 18 mo 
to between 50 and 100 at 2 yr. After acquiring a vocabulary of 
about 50 words, toddlers begin to combine them to make simple 
sentences, the beginning of grammar. At this stage, toddlers 
understand 2-step commands, such as “Give me the ball and then 
get your shoes.” Language also gives the toddler a sense of 
control over the surroundings, as in “night-night” or “bye-bye.” 
The emergence of verbal language marks the end of the sensory-
motor period. As toddlers learn to use symbols to express ideas 
and solve problems, the need for cognition based on direct sensa-
tion and motor manipulation wanes.
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
With children’s increasing mobility, physical limits on their 
explorations become less effective; words become increasingly 
important for behavior control as well as cognition. Children 
with delayed language acquisition often have greater behavior 
problems and frustrations due to problems with communication. 
Language development is facilitated when parents and caregivers 
use clear, simple sentences; ask questions; and respond to chil-
dren’s incomplete sentences and gestural communication with the 
appropriate words. Television viewing decreases parent-child 
verbal interactions, whereas looking at picture books together 
provides an ideal context for language development.
In the office setting, certain procedures may lessen the child’s 
stranger anxiety. Avoid direct eye contact initially. Perform as 
much of the examination as feasible with the child on the parent’s 
lap. Pediatricians can help parents understand the resurgence of 
problems with separation and the appearance of a treasured 
blanket or teddy bear as a developmental phenomenon. Parents 
must understand the importance of exploration. Rather than 
limiting movement, parents should place toddlers in safe environ-
ments or substitute 1 activity for another. Methods of discipline, 
including corporal punishment, should be discussed; effective 
alternatives will usually be appreciated. Helping parents to 
understand and adapt to their children’s different temperamental 
styles can constitute an important intervention (see Table 6-1). 
Developing daily routines is helpful to all children at this age. 
Rigidity in those routines reflects a need for mastery over a chang-
ing environment.

head will grow only an additional 5 cm between ages 3 and 
18 yr. Current growth charts, with growth parameters, can be 
found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website 
(www.cdc.gov/nchs) and in Chapter 15. Children with early adi-
posity rebound (increase in body mass index) are at increased risk 
for adult obesity.
Growth of sexual organs is commensurate with somatic 
growth. The preschooler has genu valgum (knock-knees) and 
mild pes planus (flatfoot). The torso slims as the legs lengthen. 
Physical energy peaks, and the need for sleep declines to 
11-13 hr/24 hr, with the child eventually dropping the nap (see 
Fig. 8-1). Visual acuity reaches 20/30 by age 3 yr and 20/20 by 
age 4 yr. All 20 primary teeth have erupted by 3 yr of age (see 
Table 8-3).
Most children walk with a mature gait and run steadily before 
the end of their 3rd yr (see Table 9-1). Beyond this basic level, 
there is wide variation in ability as the range of motor activities 
expands to include throwing, catching, and kicking balls; riding 
on bicycles; climbing on playground structures; dancing; and 
other complex pattern behaviors. Stylistic features of gross motor 
activity, such as tempo, intensity, and cautiousness, also vary 
significantly. Although toddlers may walk with different styles, 
toe walking should not persist.
The effects of such individual differences on cognitive and 
emotional development depend in part on the demands of the 
social environment. Energetic, coordinated children may thrive 
emotionally with parents or teachers who encourage physical 
activity; lower-energy, more cerebral children may thrive with 
adults who value quiet play.
Handedness is usually established by the 3rd yr. Frustration 
may result from attempts to change children’s hand preference. 
Variations in fine motor development reflect both individual pro-
clivities and different opportunities for learning. Children who 
are seldom allowed to use crayons, for example, develop a mature 
pencil grasp later.
Bowel and bladder control emerge during this period, with 
“readiness” for toileting having large individual and cultural 
variation. Girls tend to train faster and earlier than boys. Bed-
wetting is normal up to age 4 yr in girls and age 5 yr in boys (see 
Chapter 21.3). Many children master toileting with ease, particu-
larly once they are able to verbalize their bodily needs. For others, 
toilet training can involve a protracted power struggle. Refusal 
to defecate in the toilet or potty is relatively common and can 
lead to constipation and parental frustration. Defusing the issue 
with a temporary cessation of training (and a return to diapers) 
often allows toilet mastery to proceed.
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
The normal decrease in appetite at this age may cause parental 
concern about nutrition; growth charts should reassure parents 
that the child’s intake is adequate. Children normally modulate 
their food intake to match their somatic needs according to feel-
ings of hunger and satiety. Daily intake fluctuates, at times 
widely, but intake during the period of a week is relatively stable. 
Parents should provide a predictable eating schedule, with 3 
meals and 2 snacks per day, allowing the child to choose how 
much to eat.
Highly active children face increased risks of injury, and 
parents should be counseled about safety precautions. Parental 
concerns about possible hyperactivity may reflect inappropriate 
expectations, heightened fears, or true overactivity. Children who 
engage in impulsive activity with no apparent regard for personal 
safety should be evaluated further.
Language, Cognition, and Play
These three domains all involve symbolic function, a mode  
of dealing with the world that emerges during the preschool 
period.
Language
Language development occurs most rapidly between 2 and 5 yr 
of age. Vocabulary increases from 50-100 words to more than 
2,000. Sentence structure advances from telegraphic phrases 
(“Baby cry”) to sentences incorporating all of the major gram-
matical components. As a rule of thumb, between the ages of 2 
and 5 yr, the number of words in a typical sentence equals the 
child’s age (2 by age 2 yr, 3 by age 3 yr, and so on). By 21 mo 
to 2 yr, most children are using possessives (“My ball”), progres-
sives (the “-ing” construction, as in “I playing”), questions, and 
negatives. By age 4 yr, most children can count to 4 and use the 
past tense; by age 5 yr, they can use the future tense. Children 
do not use figurative speech; they will only comprehend the literal 
meaning of words. Referring to an object as “light as a feather” 
may produce a quizzical look on a child.
It is important to distinguish between speech (the production 
of intelligible sounds) and language, which refers to the underly-
ing mental act. Language includes both expressive and receptive 
functions. Receptive language (understanding) varies less in its 
rate of acquisition than does expressive language; therefore, it 
has greater prognostic importance (see Chapters 14 and 32).
Language acquisition depends critically on environmental 
input. Key determinants include the amount and variety of 
speech directed toward children and the frequency with which 
adults ask questions and encourage verbalization. Children 
raised in poverty typically perform lower on measures of lan-
guage development compared to children from economically 
advantaged families.
Although experience influences the rate of language develop-
ment, many linguists believe that the basic mechanism for lan-
guage learning is “hard-wired” in the brain. Children do not 
simply imitate adult speech; they abstract the complex rules of 
grammar from the ambient language, generating implicit hypoth-
eses. Evidence for the existence of such implicit rules comes from 
analysis of grammatical errors, such as the overgeneralized use 
of “-s” to signify the plural and “-ed” to signify the past (“We 
seed lots of mouses.”).
Language is linked to both cognitive and emotional develop-
ment. Language delays may be the first indication that a child 
has mental retardation, has an autism spectrum disorder, or has 
been maltreated. Language plays a critical part in the regulation 
of behavior through internalized “private speech” in which a 
child repeats adult prohibitions, first audibly and then mentally. 
Language also allows children to express feelings, such as anger 
or frustration, without acting them out; consequently, language-
delayed children show higher rates of tantrums and other exter-
nalizing behaviors.
Preschool language development lays the foundation for later 
success in school. Approximately 35% of children in the USA 
may enter school lacking the language skills that are the prereq-
uisites for acquiring literacy. Children from socially and economi-
cally disadvantaged backgrounds have an increased risk of school 
problems, making early detection, along with referral and enrich-
ment, important. Although children typically learn to read and 
write in elementary school, critical foundations for literacy are 
established during the preschool years. Through repeated early 
exposure to written words, children learn about the uses of 
writing (telling stories or sending messages) and about its form 
(left to right, top to bottom). Early errors in writing, like errors 
in speaking, reveal that literacy acquisition is an active process 
involving the generation and revision of hypotheses. Programs 
such as Head Start are especially important for improving lan-
guage skills for children from bilingual homes. (Such parents 
should be reassured that although bilingual children do initially 
lag behind their monolingual peers in acquiring language over 
time, they learn the differing rules governing both languages. 
Bilingual children do not follow the same course of language 
development as monolingual children, but create a different 
system of language cues. Several cognitive advantages have been

repeatedly demonstrated among bilingual compared to monolin-
gual children.)
Picture books have a special role not only in familiarizing 
young children with the printed word but also in the development 
of verbal language. Children’s vocabulary and receptive language 
improve when their parents consistently read to them. Reading 
aloud with a young child is an interactive process in which a 
parent repeatedly focuses the child’s attention on a particular 
picture, asks questions, and then gives the child feedback. The 
elements of shared attention, active participation, immediate 
feedback, repetition, and graduated difficulty make such routines 
ideal for language learning. Programs in which physicians provide 
books to preschool children have shown improvement in lan-
guage skills among the children.
The period of rapid language acquisition is also when devel-
opmental dysfluency and stuttering are most likely to emerge; 
these can be traced to activation of the cortical motor, sensory, 
and cerebellar areas. Common difficulties include pauses and 
repetitions of initial sounds. Stress or excitement exacerbates 
these difficulties, which generally resolve on their own. Although 
5% of preschool children will stutter, it will resolve in 80% by 
age 8 yr. Children with stuttering should be referred for evalua-
tion if it is severe, persistent, or associated with anxiety, or if 
parental concern is elicited. Treatment includes guidance to 
parents to reduce pressures associated with speaking.
Cognition
The preschool period corresponds to Piaget’s preoperational (pre-
logical) stage, characterized by magical thinking, egocentrism, 
and thinking that is dominated by perception, not abstraction 
(see Table 6-2). Magical thinking includes confusing coincidence 
with causality, animism (attributing motivations to inanimate 
objects and events), and unrealistic beliefs about the power of 
wishes. A child might believe that people cause it to rain by car-
rying umbrellas, that the sun goes down because it is tired, or 
that feeling resentment toward a sibling can actually make that 
sibling sick. Egocentrism refers to a child’s inability to take 
another’s point of view and does not connote selfishness. A child 
might try to comfort an adult who is upset by bringing him or 
her a favorite stuffed animal. After 2 yr of age, the child develops 
a concept of herself or himself as an individual and senses the 
need to feel “whole.”
Piaget demonstrated the dominance of perception over logic. 
In one experiment, water is poured back and forth between a tall, 
thin vase and a low, wide dish, and children are asked which 
container has more water. Invariably, they choose the one that 
looks larger (usually the tall vase), even when the examiner points 
out that no water has been added or taken away. Such misun-
derstandings reflect young children’s developing hypotheses 
about the nature of the world as well as their difficulty in attend-
ing simultaneously to multiple aspects of a situation.
Recent work indicating that preschool children do have the 
ability to understand some causal relationships has modified our 
understanding of the ability of preschool children to engage in 
some abstract thinking.
Play
Maria Montessori considered play to be the work of childhood; 
she did not lend credence to the importance of fantasy and imagi-
nation (symbolic play). Play involves learning, physical activity, 
socialization with peers, and practicing adult roles. Play increases 
in complexity and imagination, from simple imitation of common 
experiences, such as shopping and putting baby to bed (2 or 3 yr 
of age), to more extended scenarios involving singular events, 
such as going to the zoo or going on a trip (3 or 4 yr of age), to 
the creation of scenarios that have only been imagined, such as 
flying to the moon (4 or 5 yr of age). By age 3 yr, cooperative 
play is seen in activities such as building a tower of blocks 
together; later, more structured role-play activity, as in playing 
house, is seen. Play also becomes increasingly governed by rules, 
from early rules about asking (rather than taking) and sharing (2 
or 3 yr of age), to rules that change from moment to moment, 
according to the desires of the players (4 and 5 yr of age), to the 
beginning of the recognition of rules as relatively immutable (5 yr 
of age and beyond).
Play also allows for resolution of conflicts and anxiety and for 
creative outlets. Children can vent anger safely (spanking a doll), 
take on superpowers (dinosaur and superhero play), and obtain 
things that are denied in real life (a make-believe friend or stuffed 
animal). Creativity is particularly apparent in drawing, painting, 
and other artistic activities. Themes and emotions that emerge in 
a child’s drawings often reflect the emotional issues of greatest 
importance for the child.
Difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality colors a child’s 
perception of what he or she views in the media, through pro-
gramming and advertising. One fourth of young children have a 
television set in their bedroom and watch many hours of televi-
sion per week, and much of what they view is violent. Attitudes 
about violence are formed early, and early exposure has been 
associated with later behavior problems.
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
The significance of language as a target for assessment and inter-
vention cannot be overestimated because of its central role as an 
indicator of cognitive and emotional development and a key 
factor in behavioral regulation and later school success. As lan-
guage emerges, parents can support emotional development by 
using words that describe the child’s feeling states (“You sound 
angry right now.”) and urging the child to use words to express, 
rather than act out, feelings. Active imaginations will come into 
play when children offer explanations for misbehavior. A parent’s 
best way of dealing with untruths is to address the event, not the 
child, and have the child participate in making things right.
Parents should have a regular time each day for reading or 
looking at books with their children. Programs such as Reach 
Out and Read, in which pediatricians give out picture books 
along with appropriate guidance during primary care visits, have 
been effective in increasing reading aloud and thereby promoting 
language development, particularly in lower-income families. 
Television and similar media should be limited to 2 hr/day of 
quality programming, and parents should be watching the pro-
grams with their children and debriefing their young children 
afterward. At-risk children, particularly those living in poverty, 
can better meet future school challenges if they have early high-
quality experiences, such as Head Start.
Preoperational thinking constrains how children understand 
experiences of illness and treatment. Children begin to under-
stand that bodies have “insides” and “outsides.” Children should 
be given simple, concrete explanations for medical procedures 
and given some control over procedures if possible. Children 
should be reassured that they are not to blame when receiving a 
vaccine or venipuncture. An adhesive bandage will help to make 
the body whole again in a child’s mind.
The active imagination that fuels play and the magical, animist 
thinking characteristic of preoperational cognition can also gen-
erate intense fears. More than 80% of parents report at least 1 
fear in their preschool children. Refusal to take baths or to sit on 
the toilet may arise from the fear of being washed or flushed 
away, reflecting a child’s immature appreciation of relative size. 
Attempts to demonstrate rationally that there are no monsters in 
the closet often fail, inasmuch as the fear arises from prerational 
thinking. However, this same thinking allows parents to be 
endowed with magical powers that can banish the monsters with 
“monster spray” or a night light. Parents should acknowledge 
the fears, offer reassurance and a sense of security, and give the 
child some sense of control over the situation. Use of the Draw-
a-Person, in which a child is asked to draw the best person he or 
she can, may help elucidate a child’s viewpoint.

P II-26   n  Part II  Growth, Development, and Behavior
Emotional and Moral Development
Emotional challenges facing preschool children include accepting 
limits while maintaining a sense of self-direction, reining in 
aggressive and sexual impulses, and interacting with a widening 
circle of adults and peers. At 2 yr of age, behavioral limits are 
predominantly external; by 5 yr of age, these controls need to be 
internalized if a child is to function in a typical classroom. Success 
in achieving this goal relies on prior emotional development, 
particularly the ability to use internalized images of trusted adults 
to provide a secure environment in times of stress. The love a 
child feels for important adults is the main incentive for the 
development of self-control.
Children learn what behaviors are acceptable and how much 
power they wield vis-à-vis important adults by testing limits. 
Testing increases when it elicits attention, even though that atten-
tion is often negative, and when limits are inconsistent. Testing 
often arouses parental anger or inappropriate solicitude as a child 
struggles to separate, and it gives rise to a corresponding parental 
challenge: letting go. Excessively tight limits can undermine a 
child’s sense of initiative, whereas overly loose limits can provoke 
anxiety in a child who feels that no one is in control.
Control is a central issue. Young children cannot control 
many aspects of their lives, including where they go, how long 
they stay, and what they take home from the store. They are also 
prone to lose internal control, that is, to have temper tantrums. 
Fear, overtiredness, inconsistent expectations, or physical dis-
comfort can also evoke tantrums. Tantrums normally appear 
toward the end of the 1st yr of life and peak in prevalence 
between 2 and 4 yr of age. Tantrums lasting more than 15 min 
or regularly occurring more than 3 times/day may reflect underly-
ing medical, emotional, or social problems.
Preschool children normally experience complicated feelings 
toward their parents that can include strong attachment and  
possessiveness toward the parent of the opposite sex, jealousy 
and resentment of the other parent, and fear that these negative 
feelings might lead to abandonment. These emotions, most of 
which are beyond a child’s ability to comprehend or verbalize, 
often find expression in highly labile moods. The resolution of 
this crisis (a process extending over years) involves a child’s 
unspoken decision to identify with the parents rather than 
compete with them. Play and language foster the development of 
emotional controls by allowing children to express emotions and 
role-play.
Curiosity about genitals and adult sexual organs is normal, as 
is masturbation. Excessive masturbation interfering with normal 
activity, acting out sexual intercourse, extreme modesty, or 
mimicry of adult seductive behavior all suggests the possibility of 
sexual abuse or inappropriate exposure. Modesty appears gradu-
ally between 4 and 6 yr of age, with wide variations among 
cultures and families. Parents should begin to teach children 
about “private” areas before school entry.
Moral thinking is constrained by a child’s cognitive level and 
language abilities, but develops as the child continues her or his 
identity with the parents. Beginning before the 2nd birthday, the 
child’s sense of right and wrong stems from the desire to earn 
approval from the parents and avoid negative consequences. The 
child’s impulses are tempered by external forces; she or he has 
not yet internalized societal rules or a sense of justice and fairness. 
Over time, as the child internalizes parental admonitions, words 
are substituted for aggressive behaviors. Finally, the child accepts 
personal responsibility. Actions will be viewed by damage caused, 
not by intent. Empathic responses to others’ distress arise during 
the 2nd yr of life, but the ability to consider another child’s point 
of view remains limited throughout this period. In keeping with 
a child’s inability to focus on more than 1 aspect of a situation 
at a time, fairness is taken to mean equal treatment, regardless 
of circumstance. A 4 yr old will acknowledge the importance of 
taking turns, but will complain if he didn’t get enough time. Rules 
tend to be absolute, with guilt assigned for bad outcomes, regard-
less of intentions.
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
The importance of the preschooler’s sense of control over his or 
her body and surroundings has implications for practice. Prepar-
ing the patient by letting the child know how the visit will 
proceed is reassuring. Tell the child what will happen, but don’t 
ask permission unless you are willing to deal with a “no” answer. 
A brief introduction to “private parts” is warranted before the 
genital examination.
The visit of the 4 or 5 yr old should be entertaining, because 
of the child’s ability to communicate, as well as his or her natural 
curiosity. Physicians should realize that all children are occasion-
ally difficult. Guidance emphasizing appropriate expectations for 
behavioral and emotional development and acknowledging 
normal parental feelings of anger, guilt, and confusion should be 
part of all visits at this time. Parents should be queried about 
daily routines and their expectations of child behavior. Providing 
children with choices (all options being acceptable to the parent) 
and encouraging independence in self-care activities (feeding, 
dressing, and bathing) will reduce conflicts.
Although some cultures condone the use of corporal punish-
ment for disciplining of young children, it is not an effective 
means of behavioral control. As children habituate to repeated 
spanking, parents have to spank ever harder to get the desired 
response, increasing the risk of serious injury. Sufficiently harsh 
punishment may inhibit undesired behaviors, but at great psy-
chologic cost. Children mimic the corporal punishment that they 
receive, and it is common for preschool children to strike their 
parents or other children. Whereas spanking is the use of force, 
externally applied, to produce behavior change, discipline is the 
process that allows the child to internalize controls on behavior. 
Alternative discipline strategies should be offered, such as the 
“countdown,” along with consistent limit setting, clear commu-
nication of rules, and frequent approval. Discipline should be 
immediate, specific to the behavior, and time-limited. Time-out 
for approximately 1 min/yr of age is very effective. A kitchen 
timer allows the parent to step back from the situation; the child 
is free when the timer rings.

Chapter 11  Middle Childhood  n  P II-27
Chapter 11
Middle Childhood
Susan Feigelman
Middle childhood (6-11 yr of age), previously referred to as 
latency, is the period during which children increasingly separate 
from parents and seek acceptance from teachers, other adults, 
and peers. Self-esteem becomes a central issue, as children develop 
the cognitive ability to consider their own self-evaluations and 
their perception of how others see them. For the first time, they 
are judged according to their ability to produce socially valued 
outputs, such as getting good grades, playing a musical instru-
ment, or hitting home runs. Children are under pressure to 
conform to the style and ideals of the peer group.
Physical Development
Growth during the period averages 3-3.5 kg (7 lb) and 6-7 cm 
(2.5 in) per year (see Figs. 9-1 and 9-2). Growth occurs discon-
tinuously, in 3-6 irregularly timed spurts each year, but varies 
both within and among individuals. The head grows only 2-3 cm 
in circumference throughout the entire period, reflecting a slowing 
of brain growth. Myelinization is complete by 7 yr of age. Body 
habitus is more erect than previously, with long legs compared 
with the torso.
Growth of the midface and lower face occurs gradually. Loss 
of deciduous (baby) teeth is a more dramatic sign of maturation, 
beginning around 6 yr of age. Replacement with adult teeth 
occurs at a rate of about 4 per year, so that by age 9 yr, children 
will have 8 permanent incisors and 4 permanent molars. Premo-
lars erupt by 11-12 yr of age. Lymphoid tissues hypertrophy, 
often giving rise to impressive tonsils and adenoids.
Muscular strength, coordination, and stamina increase pro-
gressively, as does the ability to perform complex movements, 
such as dancing or shooting baskets. Such higher-order motor 
skills are the result of both maturation and training; the degree 
of accomplishment reflects wide variability in innate skill, inter-
est, and opportunity.
There has been a general decline in physical fitness among 
school-aged children. Sedentary habits at this age are associated 
with increased lifetime risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease 
(see Chapter 44). The number of overweight children and the 
degree of overweight are both increasing; although the propor-
tion of overweight children of all ages has increased over the last 
half century, this rate has increased over four-fold among chil-
dren ages 6-11 yr (Table 11-1). Only 8% of middle and junior 
high schools require daily physical education class. One quarter 
of youth do not engage in any free-time physical activity, whereas 
the recommendation is for 1 hr of physical activity per day.
Perceptions of body image develop early during this period; 
children as young as 5 and 6 yr express dissatisfaction with  
their body image; by ages 8 and 9 yr many of these youth report 
trying to diet, often using ill-advised regimens. Loss of control 
(binge) eating occurs among approximately 6% of children of 
this age.
Prior to puberty, the sensitivity of the hypothalamus and the 
pituitary changes, leading to increased gonadotropin synthesis. 
For most children, the sexual organs remain physically immature, 
but interest in gender differences and sexual behavior remains 
active in many children and increases progressively until puberty. 
Although this is a period when sexual drives are limited, mastur-
bation is common, and children may be interested in differences 
between genders. Though still somewhat controversial, there is 
growing consensus that breast development and menarche are 
occurring at an earlier age among girls in the USA. Rates of 
maturation differ by geography, ethnicity, and country. These 
differences in maturation have implications for differing expecta-
tions of others about them based on sexual maturation.
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
Middle childhood is generally a time of excellent health. However, 
children have variable sizes, shapes, and abilities. Children of this 
age compare themselves with others, eliciting feelings about their 
physical attributes and abilities. Fears of being “defective” can 
lead to avoidance of situations in which physical differences 
might be revealed, such as gym class or medical examinations. 
Children with actual physical disabilities may face special stresses. 
Medical, social, and psychologic risks tend to occur together.
Children should be asked about regular physical activity. Par-
ticipation in organized sports or other organized activities can 
foster skill, teamwork, and fitness, as well as a sense of accom-
plishment, but pressure to compete when the activity is no longer 
enjoyable has negative effects. Prepubertal children should not 
engage in high-stress, high-impact sports, such as power lifting 
or tackle football, because skeletal immaturity increases the risk 
of injury.
Cognitive Development
The thinking of early elementary school-aged children differs 
qualitatively from that of preschool children. In place of magical, 
egocentric, and perception-bound cognition, school-aged chil-
dren increasingly apply rules based on observable phenomena, 
factor in multiple dimensions and points of view, and interpret 
their perceptions using physical laws. Piaget documented this 
shift from “preoperational” to “concrete logical operations.” 
When 5 yr olds watch a ball of clay being rolled into a snake, 
they might insist that the snake has “more” because it is longer. 
In contrast, 7 yr olds typically reply that the ball and the snake 
must weigh the same because nothing has been added or taken 
away or because the snake is both longer and thinner. This cogni-
tive reorganization occurs at different rates in different contexts.

P II-28   n  Part II  Growth, Development, and Behavior
In the context of social interactions with siblings, young children 
often demonstrate an ability to understand alternate points of 
view long before they demonstrate that ability in their thinking 
about the physical world. Understanding time and space con-
structs occurs in the later part of this period.
The concept of “school readiness” is controversial. There is 
no consensus on whether there is a defined set of skills needed 
for success on school entry, and whether certain skills predict 
later achievement. By age 5 yr, most children have the ability to 
learn in a school setting, as long as the setting is sufficiently flex-
ible to support children with a variety of developmental achieve-
ments. Rather than delaying school entry, high quality early 
education programs may be the key to ultimate school success. 
Separation anxiety, or school refusal, is common in the early 
school years.
School makes increasing cognitive demands on the child. 
Mastery of the elementary curriculum requires that a large 
number of perceptual, cognitive, and language processes work 
efficiently (Table 11-2), and children are expected to attend to 
many inputs at once. The first 2 to 3 yr of elementary school is 
devoted to acquiring the fundamentals: reading, writing, and 
basic mathematics skills. By 3rd grade, children need to be able 
to sustain attention through a 45 min period and the curriculum 
requires more complex tasks. The goal of reading a paragraph is 
no longer to decode the words, but to understand the content; 
the goal of writing is no longer spelling or penmanship, but 
composition. The volume of work increases along with the 
complexity.
Cognitive abilities interact with a wide array of attitudinal and 
emotional factors in determining classroom performance. These 
factors include external rewards (eagerness to please adults and 
approval from peers) and internal rewards (competitiveness, will-
ingness to work for a delayed reward, belief in one’s abilities, and 
ability to risk trying when success is not ensured). Success pre-
disposes to success, whereas failure impacts self-esteem and 
reduces self-efficacy, diminishing a child’s ability to take future 
risks.
Children’s intellectual activity extends beyond the classroom. 
Beginning in the 3rd or 4th grade, children increasingly enjoy 
strategy games and wordplay (puns and insults) that exercise 
their growing cognitive and linguistic mastery. Many become 
experts on subjects of their own choosing, such as sports trivia, 
or develop hobbies, such as special card collections. Others 
become avid readers or take on artistic pursuits. Whereas board 
and card games were once the usual leisure time activity of youth, 
video and computer games currently fill this need.
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
Concrete operations allow children to understand simple expla-
nations for illnesses and necessary treatments, although they may 
revert to prelogical thinking when under stress. A child with 
pneumonia may be able to explain about white cells fighting the 
“germs” in the lungs, but still secretly harbors the belief that the 
sickness is a punishment for disobedience.
As children are faced with more abstract concepts, academic 
and classroom behavior problems emerge and come to the pedi-
atrician’s attention. Referrals may be made to the school for 
remediation or to community resources (medical or psychologic) 
when appropriate. The causes may be one or more of the fol-
lowing: deficits in perception (vision and hearing); specific learn-
ing disabilities; global cognitive delay (mental retardation); 
primary attention deficit; and attention deficits secondary to 
family dysfunction, depression, anxiety, or chronic illness (see 
Chapters 14 and 29). Children whose learning style does not  
fit the classroom culture may have academic difficulties and  
need assessment before failure sets in. Simply having a child 
repeat a failed grade rarely has any beneficial effect and  
often seriously undercuts the child’s self-esteem. In addition to 
finding the problem areas, identifying each child’s strengths is 
important. Educational approaches that value a wide range of 
talents (“multiple intelligences”) beyond the traditional ones of 
reading, writing, and mathematics may allow more children to 
succeed.
The change in cognition allows the child to understand “if/
when” clauses. Increased responsibilities and expectations accom-
pany increased rights and privileges. Discipline strategies should 
move toward negotiation and a clear understanding of conse-
quences, including removal of privileges for infringements.

Chapter 11  Middle Childhood  n  P II-29
Social, Emotional, and Moral Development
Social and Emotional Development
In this period energy is directed toward creativity and productiv-
ity. The central Ericksonian psychosocial issue, the crisis between 
industry and inferiority, guides social and emotional develop-
ment. Changes occur in three spheres: the home, the school, and 
the neighborhood. Of these, the home and family remain the most 
influential. Increasing independence is marked by the 1st sleepover 
at a friend’s house and the 1st time at overnight camp. Parents 
should make demands for effort in school and extracurricular 
activities, celebrate successes, and offer unconditional acceptance 
when failures occur. Regular chores, associated with an allow-
ance, provide an opportunity for children to contribute to family 
functioning and learn the value of money. These responsibilities 
may be a testing ground for psychologic separation, leading to 
conflict. Siblings have critical roles as competitors, loyal support-
ers, and role models.
The beginning of school coincides with a child’s further sepa-
ration from the family and the increasing importance of teacher 
and peer relationships. Social groups tend to be same-sex, with 
frequent changing of membership, contributing to a child’s 
growing social development and competence. Popularity, a 
central ingredient of self-esteem, may be won through possessions 
(having the latest electronic gadgets or the right clothes) as well 
as through personal attractiveness, accomplishments, and actual 
social skills. Children are aware of racial differences and are 
beginning to form opinions about racial groups that impact their 
relationships.
Some children conform readily to the peer norms and enjoy 
easy social success. Those who adopt individualistic styles or have 
visible differences may be teased. Such children may be painfully 
aware that they are different, or they may be puzzled by their 
lack of popularity. Children with deficits in social skills may go 
to extreme lengths to win acceptance, only to meet with repeated 
failure. Attributions conferred by peers, such as funny, stupid, 
bad, or fat, may become incorporated into a child’s self-image 
and affect the child’s personality, as well as school performance. 
Parents may have their greatest effect indirectly, through actions 
that change the peer group (moving to a new community or 
insisting on involvement in structured after-school activities).
In the neighborhood, real dangers, such as busy streets, bullies, 
and strangers, tax school-aged children’s common sense and 
resourcefulness. Interactions with peers without close adult 
supervision call on increasing conflict resolution or pugilistic 
skills. Media exposure to adult materialism, sexuality, and vio-
lence may be frightening, reinforcing children’s feeling of power-
lessness in the larger world. Compensatory fantasies of being 
powerful may fuel the fascination with heroes and superheroes. 
A balance between fantasy and an appropriate ability to negotiate 
real-world challenges indicates healthy emotional development.
Moral Development
By the age of 5 or 6 yr, the child has developed a conscience, 
meaning that he or she has internalized the rules of the society. 
She or he can distinguish right from wrong, but may take 
context and motivation into account. Children will adopt family 
and community values, seeking approval of peers, parents, and 
other adult role models. Social conventions are important, even 
though the reason behind some rules may not be understood. 
Initially, children have a rigid sense of morality, relying on clear 
rules for themselves and others. By age 10 yr, most children 
understand fairness as reciprocity (treat others as you wish to 
be treated).
Implications for Parents and Pediatricians
Children need unconditional support as well as realistic demands 
as they venture into a world that is often frightening. A daily 
query from parents over the dinner table or at bedtime about the 
good and bad things that happened during the child’s day may 
uncover problems early. Parents may have difficulty allowing the 
child independence or may exert excessive pressure on their chil-
dren to achieve academic or competitive success. Children who 
struggle to meet such expectations may have behavior problems 
or psychosomatic complaints.
Many children face stressors that exceed the normal chal-
lenges of separation and success in school and the neighborhood. 
Divorce affects nearly 50% of children. Domestic violence, 
parental substance abuse, and other mental health problems may 
also impair a child’s ability to use home as a secure base for 
refueling emotional energies. In many neighborhoods, random 
violence makes the normal development of independence 
extremely dangerous. Older children may join gangs as a means 
of self-protection and a way to attain recognition and belong to 
a cohesive group. Children who bully others, and/or are victims 
of bullying, should be evaluated, since this behavior is associated 
with mood disorders, family problems, and school adjustment 
problems. Parents should reduce exposure to hazards where pos-
sible. Due to the risk of unintentional firearm injuries to children, 
parents should be encouraged to ask parents of playmates whether 
a gun is kept in their home and, if so, how it is secured. The high 
prevalence of adjustment disorders among school-aged children 
attests to the effects of such overwhelming stressors on 
development.
Pediatrician visits are infrequent in this period; therefore, each 
visit is an opportunity to assess children’s functioning in all con-
texts (home, school, neighborhood). Maladaptive behaviors, 
both internalizing and externalizing, occur when stress in any of 
these environments overwhelms the child’s coping responses. Due 
to continuous exposure and the strong influence of media (pro-
gramming and advertisements) on children’s beliefs and attitudes, 
parents must be alert to exposures from the television and Inter-
net. An average American youth spends over 6 hr/day with a 
variety of media, and 23 of these children have a television in their 
bedrooms. Parents should be advised to remove the television 
from their children’s rooms, limit viewing to 2 hr/day, and 
monitor what programs children watch. The Draw-a-Person (for 
ages 3-10 yr, with instructions to “draw a complete person”) and 
Kinetic Family Drawing (beginning at age 5 yr, with instructions 
to “draw a picture of everyone in your family doing something”) 
are useful office tools to assess a child’s functioning.

Assessment of Growth
Virginia Keane
A critical component of pediatric health surveillance is the assess-
ment of a child’s growth. Growth results from the interaction of 
genetics, health, and nutrition. Many biophysiologic and psycho-
social problems can adversely affect growth, and aberrant growth 
may be the first sign of an underlying problem. The most power-
ful tool in growth assessment is the growth chart (see Figs. 9-1 
and 9-2) used in combination with accurate measurements of 
height, weight, head circumference, and calculation of the body 
mass index (BMI).
Procedures for Accurate Measurement
Accurate measurement is a critical component of growth assess-
ment. Weight, in pounds or kilograms, must be determined using 
an accurate scale. For infants and toddlers, weight, length, and 
head circumference are obtained. These measures should be per-
formed with the infant naked, and ideally, repeated measures 
should be performed on the same equipment. Head circumfer-
ence is determined using a flexible tape measure run from the 
supraorbital ridge to the occiput in the path that leads to the 
largest possible measurement. Length is most accurately mea-
sured by two examiners (one to position the child), with the child 
supine on a measuring board. For older children, the measure is 
stature or height, taken without shoes, using a stadiometer. Mea-
surements obtained in alternative manners, such as marking 
examination paper at the foot and head of a supine infant, or 
using a simple wall growth chart with a book or ruler on the 
head can lead to inaccuracy that may render the measurement 
useless. It is essential to compare measurements with previous 
growth trends, repeat any that are inconsistent, and plot results 
longitudinally.
Derivation and Interpretation of Growth Charts
In 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
published new growth charts, replacing the 1977 version. Modi-
fications since then have not changed the data points. Set 1 
includes the 5th to 95th percentiles; set 2, the 3rd to 97th per-
centiles. These charts contain data from national surveys con-
ducted by the National Center for Health Statistics between 1963 
and 1994. Data are representative of the U.S. population, both 
demographically and in terms of breast-feeding prevalence. Meth-
odological steps have assured that the increase in the prevalence 
of obesity has not unduly raised the upper limits of normal. 
Several deficiencies of the older charts have been corrected, such 
as the over-representation of bottle-fed infants and the reliance 
on a local data set for the infant charts. The disjunction between 
length and height, when moving from the infant curves to those 
for older children, no longer exists. The charts include curves for 
plotting BMI for ages 2-20 yr rather than weight for height, 
facilitating identification of obesity.
The data are presented in 5 standard gender-specific charts: 
(1) weight for age; (2) height (length and stature) for age; (3) head 
circumference for age; (4) weight for height (length and stature) 
for infants; and (5) BMI for age for children over 2 yr of age (Fig. 
13-1; also see Figs. 9-1 and 9-2). The charts are available at www.
cdc.gov/growthcharts/.
Each chart is composed of percentile curves, representing the 
cross-sectional distribution of weight, length, stature, head cir-
cumference, weight for length, or BMI at each age. The percentile 
curve indicates the percentage of children at a given age on the 
x-axis whose measured value falls below the corresponding value 
on the y-axis. On the weight chart for boys 0-36 mo of age (see 
Fig. 9-1A), the 9 mo age line intersects the 25th percentile curve 
at 8.6 kg, indicating that 25% of the 9 mo old boys in the 
National Center for Health Statistics sample weigh less than 
8.6 kg (75% weigh more). Similarly, a 9 mo old boy weighing 
more than 11.2 kg is heavier than 95% of his peers. The median 
or 50th percentile is also termed the standard value, in the sense 
that the standard height for a 7 mo old girl is 67 cm (see Fig. 
9-1B). The weight-for-height charts (see Fig. 9-2) are constructed 
in an analogous fashion, with length or stature in place of age 
on the x-axis; the median or standard weight for a girl measuring 
110 cm is 18.6 kg.
For infants, the revised charts represent observed but not 
necessarily optimal growth because they still incorporate data 
from many bottle-fed infants. Rates of initiation of breast-feeding 
in the USA have more than doubled from 26% in 1970 to 74% 
in 2005, but only 12% of infants are exclusively breast-fed for 
6 mo and only 21% of infants receive breast milk for a yr. Com-
pared with current standards, an exclusively breast-fed infant 
would be expected to plot higher for weight in the first 6 mo, but 
relatively lower in the second half of the 1st yr. Awareness of this 
growth difference should prevent overidentification of growth 
problems in breast-fed infants.
In an effort to set an internationally usable standard for 
optimal growth in young children, in 2006 the World Health 
Organization released growth charts based on the Multicenter 
Growth Reference Study (MGRS). Rather than describing the 
growth of typical children, the MGRS describes the growth of 
children who are predominantly breast-fed and raised under 
optimal conditions. Six study sites representing 5 continents were 
included: USA, Brazil, Norway, Ghana, Oman, and India. Use of 
the new charts in developing nations results in identification of 
many more children as malnourished and eligible for therapeutic 
feeding programs. Their use in the USA results in many fewer 
infants being identified as underweight (comparison of curves 
shown in Fig. 13-2). Charts are available online at www.who.int/
childgrowth/standards/en/.
For adolescents, caution must be used in applying cross-sec-
tional charts. Growth during adolescence is linked temporally to 
the onset of puberty, which varies widely. By using cross-sec-
tional data based on chronological age, the charts combine 
youth who are at different stages of maturation. Normal varia-
tions in the timing of the growth spurt can lead to misdiagnosis 
of growth abnormalities. The data for 12 yr old boys include 
both early-maturing boys who are at the peak of their growth 
spurts and late-maturing ones who are still growing at their 
prepubertal rate. The net result is to artificially level off the 
growth peak, making it appear that adolescents grow more 
gradually and for a longer period than they do. When additional 
precision is necessary, growth charts derived from longitudinal

weight in kilograms/(height in meters)2 or weight in pounds/
(height in inches)2 × 703, with fractions of pounds and inches 
expressed as decimals. Values may be plotted on standard BMI 
charts (see Fig. 13-1). These calculations can be easily performed 
electronically using a variety of desktop and hand-held devices. 
BMI percentile varies with age over childhood: a 6 yr old girl 
with a BMI of 21 is overweight, whereas a 16 yr old girl with 
the same BMI is just above the 50th percentile.
Height velocity charts, which evaluate the rate of growth per 
yr, are considered by many to give a more sensitive and specific 
indicator of abnormal growth. They are used primarily by pedi-
atric endocrinologists.
Although many parents think it is important to see growth 
charts, a recent study shows they often misinterpret their meaning. 
Clinicians are cautioned to provide clear interpretation when 
using growth charts as visual aids.
Analysis of Growth Patterns
Growth is a process rather than a static quality. An infant at the 
5th percentile of weight for age may be growing normally, may 
be failing to grow, or may be recovering from growth failure, 
depending on the trajectory of the growth curve. Infants may lose 
up to 10% of their birth weight in the 1st wk of life and regain 
it by the end of the 2nd wk. They will then gain steadily at a rate 
of 20-30 g/day for the first 3 mo. Table 13-1 gives typical growth 
and calorie requirements for children through age 6 yr. Formulas 
are available for the estimation of average height and weight and 
height for children of various ages, but given their complexity 
and the easy availability of growth charts, use of the latter is 
preferable.
Despite the facts that the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS) charts represent cross-sectional rather than longitudinal 
data and that children tend to grow in spurts, most children tend 
to track along a percentile, referred to as “following the curve.” 
A normal exception commonly occurs between 6 and 18 mo of 
life. For full-term infants, size at birth reflects the influence of the 
uterine environment; however, size at 2 yr correlates with mean 
parental height, reflecting the influence of genes. Between 6 and 
18 mo of age, infants may shift percentiles upward or downward 
toward their genetic potential. Thereafter, most children will 
track along a growth percentile, with variation within two large 
percentile bands (a small infant might track between the 5th and 
25th percentiles, a large one between the 75th and 95th). This 
tracking often represents the mid-parental height and a corre-
sponding weight, where mid-parental height is calculated in 
inches as follows:
•	 Boys: [(maternal height + 5) + paternal height]/2
•	 Girls: [maternal height + (paternal height − 5)]/2
•	 13 cm (instead of ± 5 in) if using metric units
It is important to correct for various factors in plotting and 
interpreting growth charts. For premature infants, overdiagnosis 
of growth failure can be avoided by using growth charts devel-
oped specifically for this population. A cruder method, subtract-
ing the weeks of prematurity from the postnatal age when plotting 
growth parameters, does not capture the variability in growth 
velocity that very low birthweight (VLBW) infants demonstrate. 
While VLBW infants may continue to show catch-up growth 
through early school age, most achieve weight catch-up during 
the 2nd yr and height catch-up by 2.5 yr, barring medical com-
plications (see Chapter 91). For children with particularly tall or 
short parents, there is a risk of overdiagnosing growth disorders 
if parental height is not taken into account or, conversely, of 
underdiagnosing growth disorders if parental height is accepted 
uncritically as the explanation.
The analysis of growth patterns and the detection of aberrant 
growth patterns provide critical information for the detection of 
pathologic conditions. Calculation of daily and monthly growth, 
such as weight gain in g/day (see Table 13-1), allows more precise 
comparison of growth rate to the norm. Weight loss, or failure 
to gain normally, is often the first sign of pathology.
The diagnosis of failure to thrive (see Chapter 38), usually a 
diagnosis of children under 3 yr of age, is considered if a child’s 
weight is below the 5th percentile, if it drops down more than 2 
major percentile lines, or if weight for height is less than the 5th 
percentile. Weight for height below the 5th percentile remains the 
single best growth chart indicator of acute undernutrition. A BMI 
less than the 5th percentile also indicates that a child is under-
weight. Brief periods of weight loss or poor weight gain are 
usually rapidly corrected and do not permanently affect size. 
Children who have been chronically malnourished may be short 
(stunted) as well as thin, so that their weight-for-height curves 
may appear relatively normal. Chronic, severe undernutrition in 
infancy may depress head growth, which may be an ominous 
predictor of later cognitive disability. Low weight for age or 
height or weight loss may be referred to as wasting.
When growth parameters fall below the 5th percentile, values 
can be expressed as percentages of the median, or standard, 
value. A 12 mo old girl weighing 7.1 kg is at 75% of the median 
weight (9.5 kg) for her age.
Another way to evaluate weight is to determine the ideal body 
weight for height and compare the current weight to the ideal 
body weight for length or height. A 15 mo old boy who is 79 cm 
is at the 50th percentile. The ideal weight is 12 kg. If he weighs 
8 kg (<5th percentile), he is 67% of ideal body weight, an indica-
tion of severe wasting. Table 13-2 provides interpretation of 
percent ideal body weight from obese to severe wasting.
Extremes of height or weight can also be expressed in terms 
of the age for which they would represent the standard or median. 
For instance, a 30 mo old girl who is 79 cm (<5%) is at the 50th 
percentile for a 16 mo old. Thus the height age is 16 mo. Weight 
age can also be expressed this way.
Linear growth deficiency (stunting) is more likely to be due to 
congenital, constitutional, familial, or endocrine causes than to 
nutritional deficiency (see also Chapter 43). In endocrine disor-

ders, length or height declines first or at the same time as weight; 
weight for height is normal or elevated. In nutritional insuffi-
ciency, weight declines before length, and weight for height is low 
(unless there has been chronic stunting). Figure 13-3 depicts 
typical growth curves for 4 classes of decreased linear growth. In 
congenital pathologic short stature, an infant is born small and 
growth gradually tapers off throughout infancy. Causes include 
chromosomal abnormalities (Turner syndrome, trisomy 21; see 
Chapter 76), perinatal infection (TORCH), extreme prematurity, 
and teratogens (phenytoin, alcohol) (see Chapter 90). In consti-
tutional growth delay, weight and height decrease near the end 
of infancy, parallel the norm through middle childhood, and 
accelerate toward the end of adolescence. Adult size is normal. 
In familial short stature, both the infant and the parents are small; 
growth runs parallel to and just below the normal curves.
Obesity affects large numbers of children. Growth charts can 
confirm an impression of obesity if the weight for height exceeds 
120% of the standard (median) weight for height. According to 
the CDC, a BMI over the 95th percentile indicates obesity and a 
BMI between the 85th and 95th percentiles indicates overweight. 
Although widely accepted as the best clinical measure of under- 
and overweight, BMI may not provide an accurate index of 
adiposity, because it does not differentiate lean tissue and bone 
from fat. Measurement of the triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac 
skinfold thickness can be used to estimate adiposity; considerable 
experience is needed for accuracy. The American Academy of 
Pediatrics Nutrition Handbook, 6th edition, questions the use of 
fat folds to estimate total body fat, noting that the method has

not been validated in young children and that basic assumptions 
of the method, that subcutaneous fat is a marker of total fat and 
that measured sites represent average skin fat thickness, are not 
true. Other methods of measuring fat, such as hydrodensitome-
try, bioelectrical impedance, and total body water measurement 
are used in research, but not in clinical evaluation.
Other Indices of Growth
Body Proportions
Body proportions follow a predictable sequence of changes with 
development. The head and trunk are relatively large at birth, 
with progressive lengthening of the limbs throughout develop-
ment, particularly during puberty. The lower body segment is 
defined as the length from the symphysis pubis to the floor, and 
the upper body segment is the height minus the lower body 
segment. The ratio of upper body segment divided by lower body 
segment (U/L ratio) equals approximately 1.7 at birth, 1.3 at 3 yr 
of age, and 1.0 after 7 yr of age. Higher U/L ratios are charac-
teristic of short-limb dwarfism or bone disorders, such as rickets.
Skeletal Maturation
Reference standards for bone maturation facilitate estimation of 
bone age (see Table 8-3). Bone age correlates well with stage of 
pubertal development and can be helpful in predicting adult 
height in early- or late-maturing adolescents. In familial short 
stature, the bone age is normal (comparable to chronological 
age). In constitutional delay, endocrinologic short stature, and 
undernutrition, the bone age is low and comparable to the height 
age. Skeletal maturation is linked more closely to sexual maturity 
rating than to chronological age. It is more rapid and less variable 
in girls than in boys.
Dental Development
Dental development includes mineralization, eruption, and exfo-
liation (Table 13-3). Initial mineralization begins as early as the 
2nd trimester (mean age for central incisors, 14 wk) and contin-
ues through 3 yr of age for the primary (deciduous) teeth and 
25 yr of age for the permanent teeth. Mineralization begins at 
the crown and progresses toward the root. Eruption begins with

Developmental Screening  
and Surveillance
Frances P. Glascoe and Kevin Marks
Developmental-behavioral problems are the most common condi-
tions of childhood and adolescence. When combined with school 
failure and high school drop-out rates, prevalence reaches 1 in 4 
to 1 in 5 children. In inner-city low-income settings, drop-out 
rates often reach as high as 50%. If intervention is instituted prior 
to school entrance, many problems can be prevented, and all can 
be ameliorated. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(IDEA) coupled with the Head Start Act ensure a free national 
system to locate and treat young children deemed at risk for 
developmental-behavioral problems or who have established 
delays. Early intervention depends on early detection performed 
by primary care providers.
the central incisors and progresses laterally. Exfoliation begins at 
about 6 yr of age and continues through 12 yr of age. Eruption 
of the permanent teeth may follow exfoliation immediately or 
may lag by 4-5 mo. The timing of dental development is poorly 
correlated with other processes of growth and maturation. 
Delayed eruption is usually considered when there are no teeth 
by approximately 13 mo of age (mean + 3 standard deviations). 
Common causes include hypothyroid, hypoparathyroid, familial, 
and (the most common) idiopathic. Individual teeth may fail to 
erupt because of mechanical blockage (crowding, gum fibrosis). 
Causes of early exfoliation include histiocytosis X, cyclic neutro-
penia, leukemia, trauma, and idiopathic factors. Nutritional and 
metabolic disturbances, prolonged illness, and certain medica-
tions (tetracycline) commonly result in discoloration or malfor-
mations of the dental enamel. A discrete line of pitting on the 
enamel suggests a time-limited insult.
Structural Growth
Virtually every organ and physiologic process undergoes a pre-
dictable sequence of structural or functional changes, or both, 
during development. Reference values for developmental changes 
in a wide variety of systems (pituitary and renal function, electro-
encephalogram, and electrocardiogram) have been published.

Chapter 14  Developmental Screening and Surveillance   n  P II-35
Many young children at risk for school failure lack measur-
able delays but have markers in the form of multiple psychosocial 
risk factors that are strong predictors of future problems. Mea-
surable delays are common in children with a history of abuse or 
neglect. High-risk psychosocial risk factors such as these, typi-
cally present in foster children, warrant an automatic referral (no 
screen required) to an IDEA program. Other psychosocial risks 
include parents with less than a high school education, parental 
mental health problems (depression or anxiety), housing and 
food instability, ethnic or linguistic minority, ≥3 children in the 
home, or an authoritarian parenting style, (e.g., highly directive, 
rarely engaging verbally in children’s unique interests, punitive). 
Such risks, with or without apparent delays, typically result in 
children being held back in grade, dropping out of high school, 
teen pregnancy, unemployment, drug abuse, or criminality. Early 
intervention may reverse this cycle. Access to programs such as 
Head Start/Early Head Start for most children with psychosocial 
risk factors are based on federal poverty guidelines. Families 
often need parenting support groups, mental health referrals, 
housing, and social work services. Older children with risk 
factors, benefit from drop-out prevention assistance, including 
after-school tutoring, Boys and Girls Club, summer academic 
programs, and mentoring.
Of children with measurable delays or disabilities, the most 
common (and least well-identified) condition is speech-language 
impairment (17.5% at 30-36 mo) (see Chapter 32). Prevalence 
varies by age, but this is followed in frequency by attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (4-12%) (see Chapter 30), learning 
disabilities (6.5%), and cognitive disabilities/mental retardation 
(1.2% overall) (see Chapter 33). Less common conditions 
include autism spectrum disorder (0.67% overall), pervasive 
developmental disorder-NOS (0.27%) (see Chapter 28), cerebral 
palsy (0.23%) (see Chapter 591.1), hearing impairment (0.12%), 
and other forms of health or physical impairments (e.g.,  
Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, traumatic brain injury). 
Early detection of emerging deficits among very young children 
typically requires clinicians to screen with tools proven to be 
accurate.
Very young children with delays, (i.e., birth to 3 yr of age) do 
not require a specific diagnosis to receive IDEA services. They are 
eligible under developmental delay, defined as a 25% departure 
from typical performance in ≥2 developmental domains (e.g., 
receptive language, expressive language, fine motor, gross motor, 
social-emotional, cognitive/pre-academic, and behavior). Primary 
care providers need not make a diagnosis in very young children 
but instead should focus on detection and referral to IDEA pro-
grams. Nevertheless, clinicians can simultaneously refer to sub-
specialty services, particularly when autism spectrum disorder is 
suspected. Children over the age of 3 yr are served and tested by 
the public schools psychologists, and speech-language patholo-
gists will define disabilities more discretely.
Early Detection in Primary Care
Only about 25% of children with developmental delays are 
detected prior to school entrance when children have missed 
opportunities for early intervention. Although clinicians are effec-
tive at detecting severe disabilities associated with congenital, 
metabolic, or genetic abnormalities, clinicians are far less adept 
at discerning the more common conditions that typically lack 
overt symptoms (dysmorphic features, metabolic crisis).
Reasons for underdetection in primary care include (1) depen-
dence on nonstandard administration of standardized screens 
(including selected items from longer measures) and informal 
milestones checklists; both approaches lack proof of validity and 
criteria for making accurate decisions; (2) failure to continually 
check on developmental progress; (3) clinical judgment (because 
it tends to depend heavily on dysmorphology and organicity, 
which are not present in the majority of children with disabili-
ties); (4) requirement of repeated screening test failure before 
making a referral (due to lack of awareness that quality screening 
measures are highly reliable and that a repeated screen is likely 
to yield identical results); (5) false optimism about outcome (chil-
dren rarely outgrow developmental problems in the absence of 
intervention); (6) discomfort at delivering difficult news; (7) lack 
of familiarity with tools effective for busy primary care settings; 
and (8) problematic reimbursement for screening services (gener-
ally due to insurance non-reimbursement policies or ineffective 
use of procedure codes).
To improve better detection in primary care, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental screening and 
surveillance at well visits. Developmental screening refers to the 
administration of brief, standardized, and validated instruments 
that have been researched for their sensitivity in detecting chil-
dren with probable problems and specificity in determining when 
children probably do not have problems. Standards for screening 
test accuracy are 70-80% sensitivity and specificity. Although 
these figures are low compared to standards for most medical 
screens, developmental problems develop over time. Repeated 
screening is expected to compensate for underdetection of what 
is essentially a “moving target.” Over-referrals are less concern-
ing because research shows that most children with false-positive 
screens, while ineligible for special education services, are never-
theless in need of remedial programs (e.g., Head Start, after-
school tutoring, summer school, and quality preschool or day 
care,) due to psychosocial risk factors, including poverty and 
limited maternal education and below-average performance in 
the better predictors of school success (i.e., language, intelligence, 
and academic/pre-academic skills).
Table 14-1 shows a range of tools useful for early detection 
of developmental and behavioral problems. In addition, screening 
of for autism spectrum disorders should begin in the first and 
continued in the subsequent years of life (see Chapter 28). Well 
visits are brief and have enormous agendas: physical exams, 
immunizations, anticipatory guidance, safety and injury preven-
tion counseling, and developmental promotion. Developmental 
screens that rely on information from parents are ideal because 
they can be completed in advance of appointments, online, or in 
waiting or exam rooms.
In addition to repeated developmental screening, physicians 
are also encouraged to practice developmental surveillance at 
each well visit. Developmental surveillance provides a context for 
screening results and involves scrutinizing family functioning and 
risk factors, observing longitudinally child behavior and develop-
mental skills, eliciting and attending to parents’ concerns, and 
deploying knowledge of children’s medical history (Table 14-2). 
Information obtained through surveillance should never be used 
to override a positive screening test result, but it can be used to 
elevate suspicions about negative screening results. Surveillance 
is essential for determining service needs, and for selecting optimal 
methods to help parents promote positive development through 
written materials, hands-on parent training, and/or social work 
services.

Table 14-1  TOOLS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL-BEHAVIORAL SCREENING AND SURVEILLANCE
The following chart is a list of measures meeting standards for screening test accuracy, meaning that they correctly identify, at all ages, at least 70-80% of children with 
disabilities while also correctly identifying at least 70-80% children without disabilities. All listed measures were standardized on national samples, proven to be reliable, 
and validated against a range of diagnostic measures and diagnosed conditions. Not included are measures such as the Denver-II that fail to meet psychometric 
standards (limited standardization, absent validation, problematic sensitivity and specificity).
The first column provides publication information and the cost of purchasing a specimen set. The “Description” column provides information on alternative ways, if 
available, to administer measures (e.g., waiting rooms). The “Accuracy” column shows the percentage of patients with and without problems identified correctly. The 
“Time Frame/Costs” column shows the costs of materials per visit, along with the costs of professional time (using an average salary of $50 per hour) needed to 
administer each measure, but does not include time needed for generating referral letters. For parent-report tools, administration time reflects not only scoring of test 
results, but also the relationship between each test’s reading level and the percentage of parents with less than a high school education (who may or may not be able to 
complete measures in waiting rooms due to literacy problems and thus will need interview administrations).

Chapter 14  Developmental Screening and Surveillance   n  P II-37
Table 14-2  COMBINING SCREENING AND SURVEILLANCE: A PRACTICE ALGORITHM
1.  ENSURE A MEDICAL HOME.
Timely, equitable access to care logically correlates to well child care compliance rates and therefore, developmental delay identification rates. Children with 
developmental and behavioral problems or special health care needs use health care services at >2× the rate of other patients. Visits are often complex due to the need 
to make referrals, locate information from prior visits and services, make follow-up appointments, and coordinate with other providers. The AAP’s medical home model 
(www.medicalhomeinfo.org) is an essential guide to organizing practices to ensure continuity and coordination of care and to best meet the needs of children with 
disabilities and their families.
2.  REVIEW MEDICAL CHART FOR HEALTH RISK FACTORS.
Consider potentially harmful exposures including radiation or medications, infectious illnesses, fever, addictive substances, trauma, and results of neonatal screens, 
including phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism, and numerous other metabolic conditions. The perinatal history includes birthweight, gestational age, Apgar scores, 
and any medical complications (see Chapter 88.1). Postnatal medical factors that are sometimes overlooked include failure to thrive, abnormal growth curves for head 
circumference, neurological (e.g., seizure) disorders, endocrine disorders, amblyopia or other significant forms of visual impairment, chronic respiratory or allergic illness, 
conductive or sensorineural hearing impairment, congenital heart disease, iron deficiency anemia, head trauma, and sleep disorders (particularly obstructive sleep apnea 
[see Chapter 17]).
3.  DETERMINE PRESENCE OF PSYCHOSOCIAL RISK FACTORS.
This includes parents with less than a high school education, parental mental health or substance abuse problems, 4 or more children in the home, single parent, poverty, 
frequent household moves, limited social support, parental history of abuse as a child, ethnic minority, etc. Four or more risk factors tend to plunge developmental status 
into the below average range and suggest the need for enrichment or remedial programs regardless of screening results. An initial visit standardized intake measure, 
such as the Family Psychosocial Screen (see Table 14-1), and thereafter a standardized postpartum mood disorder screen, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression 
Scale or Patient Health Questionnaire-2/-9 (typically administered at the 2 wk and 2 mo) is often helpful for capturing psychosocial risk factors. When a concerning 
psychosocial screen occurs, the next step is to provide an appropriate community referral (e.g., mental health provider, domestic violence shelter, parenting or postpartum 
depression support group) and to contact (via a phone call or a courtesy copy note) the parent’s primary care provider. If parental suicidal/homicidal ideation or psychosis 
is identified, consider that a medical emergency. Not only does psychosocial screening allow for higher quality surveillance, it’s an early opportunity to ameliorate or 
prevent a future delay.

4.  ELICIT AND ADDRESS PARENTS’ CONCERNS.
This may be accomplished informally, although careful attention to wording is essential. The AAP’s Bright Futures guidelines contain helpful trigger questions. An 
alternative is to use a measure such as PEDS (see Table 14-1), which has empirically tested wording and offers a way to weight the types of concerns parents raise, 
assign levels of risk, and identify optimal responses. PEDS also functions as a broad-band screening and surveillance tool.
5.  PROVIDE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.
Points of particular importance include growth parameters and head shape and circumference, facial and other body dysmorphology, eye findings (e.g., cataracts in 
various inborn errors of metabolism), vascular markings, and signs of neurocutaneous disorders (café-au-lait spots in neurofibromatosis, hypopigmented macules in 
tuberous sclerosis). Vision and hearing screening should occur per the AAP’s guidelines. Examine closely for findings consistent with abuse/neglect (e.g., geometrically 
shaped bruises). A neurological exam (see Chapter 584), along with careful observation of the child’s behavior and the parent-child interaction, is a key part to any 
developmental evaluation. Does the parent interact appropriately with the child or does something “not feel right” during your exam? Does the child behave age-
appropriately around the parent? Is there a concern about the child being over or under attached to the parent?
6.  ADMINISTER AND SCORE THE DEVELOPMENTAL-BEHAVIORAL SCREENING TEST.
Use of parent-report measures, pre-visit or in the waiting/exam room reduces the amount of time needed for screening. Screening measures, particularly the ASQ and 
PEDS:DM also offer a way to track development over time via monitoring of milestones.
7.  RESPOND TO POSITIVE SCREENING TEST RESULTS.
Additional screens of social-emotional or social-communication functioning (e.g., ASQ-SE, M-CHAT) will further identify the areas of delay and types of services needed. In 
conjunction with surveillance, careful interpretation of a broad-band tool’s unique pattern performance profile helps clinicians to discriminate which children require a 
follow-up office visit for additional screening.
8.  WHEN INDICATED, RESPOND TO CONCERNING SCREENS WITH ADDITIONAL MEDICAL TESTS.
Iron deficiency and lead poisoning are common contributors to developmental delays and are easily detected through screening. Electroencephalograms and neuroimaging 
are not routinely indicated, but might be used if there is clinical suspicion of a seizure disorder, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, encephalopathy, neurofibromatosis, 
tuberous sclerosis, brain tumor, or other neurological problem (not including autism). Uncommonly, surveillance may indicate a need for additional metabolic screens, 
such as serum electrolytes and glucose, venous blood gas, serum ammonia, urine glycosaminoglycans, endocrine screens (e.g., TSH, free T4), genetic testing 
(chromosomal analysis, DNA for fragile X, etc.), or screens for an infectious disease (e.g., HIV antibody testing [see Chapter 273], TORCH infection testing [see Chapter 
103]).
9.  EXPLAIN SCREENING RESULTS TO PARENTS.
The primary medical provider should present the screening results to parents in person, emphasizing available community services and how to optimize a child’s (and 
family’s) outcome. It is advisable to use euphemistic terms for diagnosis, because the specific condition will not be known (e.g., “developmental delay,” “behind other 
children,” “having difficulties with….”) Offers to re-explain findings to other family members are helpful. Asking the parents if they know any families with children who 
have developmental differences may be helpful in understanding any strong reaction to the information being presented.
10.  MAKE REFERRALS FOR SUBSPECIALTY MEDICAL SERVICES.
If the record review or physical exam suggests the need, referral for further evaluation should be offered. (e.g., developmental-behavioral or neurodevelopmental 
pediatricians, psychiatrists, audiologists, otolaryngologists, occupational or physical therapists, neurologists, genetic or metabolic subspecialists, endocrinologists).
11.  MAKE REFERRALS FOR NONMEDICAL INTERVENTIONS.
This should include IDEA programs (www.nectac.org). Services are free to parents and generally provide high quality therapies, evaluations, remediation programs or high 
quality preschool for those with psychosocial risk factors (or when further evaluation reveals the screening results were false-positive). Referral forms or letters, which 
target the areas of concern, help IDEA programs to better assess and track children. To expedite assessments and eligibility placements, parental signatures should be 
obtained to release information back and forth between the medical provider and the IDEA program. Some children will be automatically eligible for services based on a 
condition highly likely to result in a developmental delay (e.g., Down syndrome, birth weight <1500 g). Referral forms or letters should include suggestions for the types 
of evaluations needed (e.g., speech-language therapy, occupational and physical therapy, social-emotional assessment, intelligence testing, academics) and 
documentation of hearing and vision status, because IDEA programs require this information before providing evaluations.
12.  PROVIDE DEVELOPMENTAL-BEHAVIORAL PROMOTION.
Helping parents encourage language and preacademic/academic development can be accomplished via written patient education materials, by encouraging parents to 
visit websites with quality information, or by parent training classes, group well visits, or social work services. A well-organized system for filing and retrieving parent-
focused materials is essential (see Table 15.3). Follow up with families, in 6-8 weeks to assess the effectiveness of promotion activities, especially in-office advice about 
behavior and social skills. If less than successful, encourage parents to engage in more intensive services (e.g., parenting classes, family therapy).
13.  REVIEW REPORTS AND OTHER FEEDBACK FROM REFERRAL SOURCES.
As with the importance of following up on the effectiveness of in-office developmental-behavioral promotion, surveillance does not end after a referral. Clinicians should 
carefully review (and when indicated, take action upon) reports from the IDEA programs and other subspecialists. IDEA programs should ideally give feedback to clinicians 
about whether the child followed up on the referral. Was the child lost to follow-up, screened out, placed on a monitoring list, or made eligible for services? Evaluation 
reports, eligibility statements and Individualized Family Service Plans should be reviewed. Tracking eligibility status with problem lists is helpful to clinicians at subsequent 
well visits. When reports show significant concerns, follow-up office visits might need to be arranged. Circle back to step 1.

Chapter 15  Child Care: How Pediatricians Can Support Children and Families  n  P II-39
With increasing movement of women into the workplace across 
the globe, child care is a primary developmental context for mil-
lions of young children. Child-care providers play a major role 
in the day-to-day safety, health, and developmental well-being of 
young children. Given the large proportion of young children in 
child-care settings, child-care providers are an important poten-
tial ally to parents and pediatricians. The provision of child care 
is complex, with enormous variation across the globe. Child care 
is affected by many factors including maternal leave policies. The 
U.S. federal leave program allows for 12 weeks of unpaid job-
protected leave during pregnancy or after childbirth, but compa-
nies with <50 employees, part-time employees, and those working 
in informal labor markets are exempt. By contrast, according to 
the national leave programs in Norway and Sweden, mothers 
may receive up to 42 and 52 weeks, respectively, of paid benefits 
after the birth of an infant. Countries vary in terms of the propor-
tion of children being cared for by the extended family. Pediatri-
cians need to understand how child care is structured and utilized 
and in their country or region appreciate the challenges parents 
face in finding and accessing high-quality child care and the chal-
lenges child-care providers face in maintaining a physically and 
developmentally healthy environment.
Provision and Regulation of Child Care in America
Child Care Usage
In the USA, about 11.3 million young children are regularly in 
care by someone other than their parents, largely due to the vast 
increase in employment of mothers of young children in recent 
decades. Fifty-eight percent of children 4 yr old and younger with 
employed parents are in regular child care. The largest increase 
in child care use is among infants and toddlers, with 53% of 
infants and 57% of toddlers in child care. Additionally, children 
are in care for long hours, with 42% of children age 4 yr or 
younger attending child care for 35 hr or more each week.
Child-Care Settings
These settings vary widely and fall into 4 broad categories, from 
the least to the most formal: relative care, in-home nonrelative 
care (e.g., nannies, au pairs), family daycare, and center-based 
care. Parents more often utilize home-based care for infants and 
toddlers, in part due to greater preference, flexibility, and avail-
ability, and sometimes due to lower cost. Almost 30% of infants 
and toddlers in care are in family daycare homes. Family daycare 
providers typically provide care in their home for up to 6 young 
children, often including children of mixed ages, siblings, or the 
provider’s own children. Use of center-based child care, provided 
in nonresidential facilities for typically 13 or more children, is 
greater among preschoolers (children 3-5 yr old). Early education 
settings for preschoolers (e.g., Head Start, prekindergarten) also 
may play an important role in child care. Although early educa-
tion programs may have a greater focus on educational activities 
and often only provide limited hours of care per days, the health 
and safety issues involved with early education programs are 
similar to those presented by other group child-care settings. 
Child-care centers and early education programs are adminis-
tered by a wide array of businesses and organizations, including 
for-profit independent companies and chains, religious organiza-
tions, public and private schools, community organizations, 
cooperatives, and public agencies.
Sick Children
When children are ill, they may be excluded from out-of-home 
arrangements, and settings under state licensure are required to 
exclude children with certain conditions. Guidelines for health 
and safety in out-of-home care from the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, and the 
National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care 
offer recommendations regarding the conditions under which 
sick children should and should not be excluded from group 
programs (Table 15-1). These include fever, vomiting, and diar-
rhea, as well as certain parasitic conditions. State laws typically 
mirror these guidelines but may be stricter in some states. Most 
families need to make arrangements to keep sick children at home 
(staying home from work). Alternative care arrangements outside 
the home for sick children are relatively rare but may include 
either (1) care in the child’s own center, if it offers special provi-
sions designed for the care of ill children (sometimes called the 
infirmary model or sick daycare); or (2) care in a center that 
serves only children with illness or temporary conditions. 
Although it is important that such arrangements emphasize pre-
venting further spread of disease, one study found no occurrence 
of additional transmission of communicable disease in children 
attending a sick center. The impact of group care of ill children

illness the facility can manage and how much and what types of illness will be addressed.
Severity level 1 consists of children whose health condition is accompanied by high interest and complete 
involvement in activity associated with an absence of symptoms of illness (such as children recovering from 
pinkeye, rash, or chickenpox), but who need further recuperation time.
Severity level 2 encompasses children whose health condition is accompanied by a medium activity level 
because of symptoms (such as children with low-grade fever, children at the beginning of an illness, and 
children in the early recovery period of an illness).
Severity level 3 is composed of children whose health condition is accompanied by a low activity level because 
of symptoms that preclude much involvement.

on their subsequent health and on the health of their families and 
community is unknown.
Child Care Licensing, Regulation, and Accreditation
Most child-care centers and preschools and many family daycare 
providers are subject to state licensing and regulation. Licensing 
and regulatory requirements for the most part mandate basic 
health and safety standards, such as sanitary practices, child and 
provider vaccinations, access to a health care professional, and 
facilities and equipment safety, as well as basic structural and 
caregiver characteristics, such as the ratio of children to staff, 
group sizes, and minimum caregiver education and training 
requirements.
The types of facilities that are subject to licensure vary by 
state. Most child-care centers in all 50 states are subject to state 
health and safety licensure, with Idaho being the last state to 
require licensure beginning in January 2010. Most states license 
some types of family child-care homes, although some states only 
license specific types of family child-care homes, and 3 states do 
not license these providers at all (Idaho, Louisiana, and New 
Jersey). Seven states (Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, New Jersey, 
Ohio, South Dakota, and Virginia) do not license small family 
child-care homes, and 11 states (Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, North Carolina, New Jersey, 
Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin) and the District of Colum-
bia do not license large/group family child-care homes. Louisiana 
has a registration process for family child-care homes with no 
more than 6 children, but registration is only required when the 
provider cares for children subsidized by the federal Child Care 
and Development Fund (which assists low-income families receiv-
ing temporary public assistance, or those needing child care in 
order to work or receiving training to transition off of public 
assistance). New Jersey has a voluntary registration process for 
family child-care homes that is operated by child-care resource 
and referral agencies in the state.
Many providers are exempt from licensing requirements (often 
programs operated by a religious organization or a public school), 
many others are out of compliance, and an unknown proportion 
of family daycare homes are unregulated and unknown to the 
public licensure system. Health and safety conditions may be 
unsatisfactory in unlicensed settings. Furthermore, in most states, 
licensing and regulatory standards have been found to be inade-
quate to promote optimal child development, and in many states 
standards are so low as to endanger child health and safety. There-
fore, even licensed providers may be providing care at quality 
levels far below professional recommendations. For example, the 
National Association for the Education of Young Children 
(NAEYC; www.naeyc.org) and the National Association for 
Family Child Care (NAFCC; www.nafcc.org) recommend infant-
to-staff ratios of no more than 3 to 1. But in 2007, requirements 
were 3 or 3.5 to 1 in only 3 states, whereas the legally allowable 
ratio was 5 to 1 in 9 states and 6 to 1 in another 5 states.
A small portion of providers become accredited by NAEYC, 
NAFCC, or other organizations by voluntarily meeting high-
quality, developmentally appropriate, professionally recom-
mended standards. The accreditation process goes far beyond 
health and safety practices and structural and caregiver charac-
teristics to examine the quality of child-caregiver interactions, 
which are crucial for child development, as described in the next 
section. Research indicates that child-care programs that com-
plete voluntary accreditation through NAEYC improve in quality 
and provide an environment that better facilitates children’s 
overall development. Less than 8% of providers are accredited; 
this is due in part to a lack of knowledge, resources, and incen-
tives for providers to improve quality, but it may also be due in 
part to expenses providers incur in the process of becoming 
accredited.
State child care licensing agencies are playing a larger role in 
various initiatives designed to improve the quality of child care 
working through the infrastructure of the early care and educa-
tion system. Several states’ licensing agencies are part of quality 
initiatives, such as tiered quality strategies (e.g., tiered reimburse-
ment systems for participating providers who achieve levels of 
quality beyond basic licensing requirements), public funding to 
facilitate accreditation, professional development systems, and 
program assessments and technical assistance.
Child Care’s Role in Child Health and Development
Characteristics of Child Care and Associations  
with Child Developmental Outcomes
High-quality child care is characterized by warm, responsive, and 
stimulating interactions between children and caregivers. In high-
quality interactions, caregivers express positive feelings toward 
their children; are emotionally involved, engaged, and aware of 
the child’s needs and sensitive and responsive to their initiations; 
speak directly with children in a manner that is elaborative and 
stimulating while being age-appropriate; and ask questions and 
encourage children’s ideas and verbalizations. Structural quality 
features of the setting, including ratio of children to adults, group 
size, and caregiver education and training, act indirectly on child 
outcomes by facilitating high-quality child-caregiver interactions. 
It would be difficult for even the most sensitive and stimulating 
provider to engage in high-quality interactions with each child, 
if she was the sole caregiver of 10 toddlers.
The quality, quantity, and type of child care experienced by 
young children contribute to child development. Child care use 
by itself does not affect maternal-child attachment. Only when 
combined with low maternal sensitivity and responsiveness does 
poor-quality child care, larger quantities of child care, or multiple 
child care arrangements predict greater likelihood of insecure 
attachment.
Adjusting for family factors (parental income, education, race/
ethnicity, family structure, parental sensitivity) the quality of 
child care is a consistent and modest predictor of child outcomes 
across most domains of development, whereas the quantity of 
child care is a consistent and modest predictor of social behavior. 
The type of child care setting, however, is an inconsistent, modest 
predictor of cognitive and social outcomes. Specifically in regards 
to quality, children who experience higher-quality child care 
perform better than other children on cognitive, language, and 
academic skill tests and, at some points in early childhood, show 
more prosocial skills and fewer behavior problems and negative 
peer interactions. Parenting quality, however, matters far more. 
Compared to the effects for child care, which are relatively con-
sistent and modest in magnitude, the effects of parenting quality 
on the same outcomes are very consistent and strong, being about 
twice as strong as the effects of child care quality.
The effects of quantity and type of child care on child develop-
ment are less strong and less consistent. Quantity of child care is 
related only to social outcomes. Children who spend more time 
in any kind of child care are rated or observed at some points in 
the preschool period to display more problem behaviors, more 
teacher-child conflict, and more negative behaviors in interac-
tions with friends. The magnitudes of these effects of child care 
hours on social outcomes are modest. Type of care shows mixed 
associations with child outcomes. Although findings vary across 
age, children who experience more center care have stronger 
cognitive, language, and memory skills and display more positive 
behaviors in interactions with a friend, but also show fewer pro-
social skills and more behavior problems. These effects of center-
based care on child outcomes are less consistent and more modest 
in magnitude compared to other reported effects.
Despite the importance of high-quality child care for child 
development, several large studies have found that most U.S. 
child care is of “poor to mediocre” quality. In one study, only 
14% of centers (8% of center-based infant care) were found to 
provide developmentally appropriate care, while 12% scored at

minimal levels that compromised health and safety (40% for 
infant care). In another study, 58% of family daycare homes 
provided adequate or custodial care, and only 8% provided good 
care. Children with the greatest amount of family risk may  
be the most likely to receive child care that is substandard in 
quality. Many children from lower-risk families also receive 
lower-quality care, and despite their advantages at home, these 
children may not be protected from the negative effects of poor-
quality care.
Affordable, accessible, high-quality child care is hard to find. 
Middle-class families spend about 6% of their annual income on 
child care expenses, while poor families spend about 33% (on 
par with housing expenses). Infant and toddler care is particularly 
expensive with fewer available slots. In addition to the stress of 
meeting such a high expense, many parents worry that their child 
will feel unhappy in group settings, will suffer from separation 
from the parents, or will be subjected to neglect or abuse. This 
worry is especially likely among low-income parents with more 
risk factors, fewer resources, and fewer high-quality options 
available. Parents are the purchasers but not the recipients of 
care, and are not in the best position to judge its quality. Many 
parents are first-time purchasers of child care with little experi-
ence and very immediate needs, selecting care in a market that 
does little to provide them with useful information about child 
care arrangements. In many states, efforts are underway to 
improve quality and provide parents with quality information, 
but most states do not have a quality rating and information 
system, and programs in states that do are still emerging, and 
testing of effectiveness is still underway. To inform their care 
decisions, parents may turn to their child’s pediatrician as the 
only professional with expertise in child development with whom 
they have regular and convenient contact.
Child Care and Child Health
A disproportionate number of sudden infant death syndrome 
(SIDS) deaths occur in child-care centers or family-based child-
care homes (approximately 20%). Infants who are back-sleepers 
at home, but are put to sleep on their fronts in child-care settings, 
have a higher risk of SIDS. Providers and parents should be made 
aware of the importance of placing infants on their backs to sleep.
Children enrolled in child care are also of an age that places 
them at increased risk for acquiring infectious diseases. Participa-
tion in group settings elevates exposure. Children enrolled in such 
settings have a higher incidence of illness (e.g., upper respiratory 
tract infections, otitis media, diarrhea, hepatitis A infections, skin 
conditions, and asthma) than those cared for at home, especially 
in the preschool years. However, a review of correlational and 
experimental research found that these illnesses had no long-term 
adverse consequences. Child-care providers that follow child care 
licensure guidelines for handwashing, diapering, food handling, 
and manage child illness appropriately can reduce communicable 
illnesses.
There is debate about whether child care exposure serves as a 
risk or protective factor for asthma. One cross-sectional study 
found that preschoolers in child care had increased risk of the 
common cold and otitis media, and children who began child 
care before the age of 2 yr had increased risk of developing recur-
rent otitis media and asthma. However, a longitudinal study 
found that children who were exposed to older children at home 
or to other children at child care during the first 6 mo of life were 
less likely to have frequent wheezing from age 6-13 yr, suggesting 
that child care exposure may protect against the development of 
asthma and frequent wheezing later in childhood. A 10-yr follow 
up of a birth cohort found no association between child care 
attendance and respiratory infections, asthma, allergic rhinitis, or 
skin prick test reactivity. Another study found that in the first 
year of elementary school, children who had attended child care 
had fewer absences from school, half as many episodes of asthma, 
and less acute respiratory illness than their peers who had never 
attended child care. These results are perhaps related to protec-
tion against respiratory illness as a result of early exposure or a 
shift in the age-related peak of illness, though selection of illness-
prone children into home care may play a role. Other factors may 
also be relevant to this issue, such as children in child care poten-
tially being less exposed to passive smoking than children at 
home.
Child Care and Children with Special Needs
The needs of children with mental, physical, or emotional dis-
abilities who, because of their chronic illness, require special care 
and instruction may require particular attention when it comes 
to their participation in most child-care settings. Guiding prin-
ciples of services for children with disabilities advocate support-
ing children in natural environments, including child care. 
Furthermore, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and 
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibit discrimi-
nation against children and adults with disabilities by requiring 
equal access to offered programs and services.
Although many child-care providers and settings are unpre-
pared to identify or administer services for children with special 
needs, child care could be utilized for delivery of support services 
to these children and/or for linking families to services, such as 
early intervention and doctor referrals. Further, pediatricians can 
draw upon child-care providers to help provide important evalu-
ative data regarding a child’s well-being, since these providers 
have extensive daily contact with the child and may have broad, 
professional understanding of normative child development. A 
child-care provider may be the first to identify a child’s potential 
language delay. Child-care providers are also necessary and valu-
able partners in the development and administration of early 
intervention service plans.
Children with special needs may be eligible for services under 
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The 
purpose of this law is to provide “free appropriate public educa-
tion,” regardless of disability or chronic illness to all eligible 
children birth to 21 yr in a natural and/or least restrictive envi-
ronment. Eligible children include those with mental, physical, or 
emotional disabilities who, because of their disability or chronic 
illness, require special instruction in order to learn. As a part of 
these services, a formal plan of intervention is to be developed 
by the service providers, families, and the children’s health care 
providers. Federal funds are available to implement a collabora-
tive early intervention system of services for eligible infants and 
toddlers between the ages of birth and 3 yr and their families. 
These services include screening, assessment, service coordina-
tion, and collaborative development of an individualized family 
service plan (IFSP). The IFSP describes early intervention services 
for the infant or toddler and family including family support and 
the child’s health, therapeutic, and educational needs. An under-
standing of the child’s routines and real-life opportunities and 
activities, such as eating, playing, interacting with others, and 
working on developmental skills, is crucial to enhancing a child’s 
ability to achieve the functional goals of the IFSP. Therefore, it 
is critical that child-care providers be involved in IFSP develop-
ment or revision, with parental consent. Child-care providers 
should also become familiar with the child’s IFSP and understand 
the providers’ role and the resources available to support the 
family and child-care provider.
Additionally, IDEA provides support for eligible preschool  
age children to receive services through the local school district. 
This includes development of a written individualized education 
program (IEP), with implementation being the responsibility of 
the local education agency in either a public or private preschool 
setting. As with IFSPs, child-care providers should become famil-
iar with the preschooler’s special needs as identified in the IEP 
and may become involved, with parental consent, in IEP develop-
ment and review meetings. In cases where children may have or 
be at risk of developmental delays, a diagnosis is important for

obtaining and coordinating services and further evaluation. To 
this end, pediatricians can partner with child-care providers to 
screen and monitor children’s behavior and development.
Role of Pediatric Providers in Child Care
Pediatricians can promote successful child care experiences for 
their young patients in several ways, including helping parents 
understand child-care issues, helping children with disabilities 
and their families have successful child-care experiences, and 
consulting to child-care/early intervention and education 
providers.
Advising Parents on Child Care Selection
Insufficient organized professional guidance in choosing child 
care is available. Pediatricians can help parents understand the 
importance for their child’s development of selecting high-quality 
care by describing how it looks and providing referrals and tips 
on how to find and select high-quality child care (Table 15-2). In 
addition, pediatricians can help parents determine how to adjust 
child care arrangements to best meet their child’s specific needs 
(e.g., allergies, eating and sleeping habits). For most parents, 
finding child care that they can afford, access, manage, and accept 
as a good environment for their child is a very difficult process 
and one many parents find distressing. Many parents are also 
worried about how their child will fare in child care, (e.g., Will 
their child feel distressed by group settings, suffer from separation 
from the parents, or even be subjected to neglect or abuse?). 
These worries are especially likely among low-income parents 
with fewer family and community resources to draw upon. A few 
parents may think of child care only as babysitting, and may not 
consider the consequences for their child’s cognitive, linguistic, 
and social development, focusing solely on whether the child is 
safe and warm. These parents may be less likely to select a high-
quality child care arrangement, which is especially problematic if 
the family is facing socioeconomic challenges that already place 
them at risk of receiving lower-quality care for their children. For 
these parents, it is vital to stress the importance of quality and 
its implications for their child’s cognitive, language, and behav-
ioral development and school readiness.
Advising Parents on Child Care Health Issues
Parents of infants should be advised to ensure that child-care 
providers put infants on their back to sleep to prevent SIDS.

Further, when children are ill, parents should be advised to follow 
guidelines for inclusion and exclusion (see Table 15-1). Parents 
may disagree with child-care staff about whether a child meets 
or does not meet the exclusion criteria. However, professional 
guidelines state that “if the reason for exclusion relates to the 
child’s ability to participate or the caregiver’s ability to provide 
care for the other children, the child-care provider is entitled to 
make this decision and cannot be forced by a parent to accept 
responsibility for the care of an ill child. If the reason for exclu-
sion relates to a decision about whether the child has a commu-
nicable disease that poses a risk to the other children in the group, 
different health care professionals in the community might give 
conflicting opinions. In these cases, the health department has the 
legal authority to make a determination.” Pediatricians should 
emphasize the importance of following vaccination schedules; 
most states require compliance for children to participate in 
licensed group child-care settings.
Helping Children with Special Needs
Pediatricians should work with parents and communicate with 
other service providers and early intervention staff to identify 
problems, remove access barriers, and coordinate service delivery 
for children with special needs. They should also encourage 
involvement of parents and child-care providers in IFSP or IEP 
plan development.
Consulting and Partnering with Child-Care Providers
Most state regulations mandate that licensed programs have a 
formal relationship with a health care provider. Pediatricians can 
provide consultation to child-care providers about measures to 
protect and maintain the health and safety of children and staff. 
This may include consultation regarding promoting practices to 
prevent SIDS; preventing and reducing the spread of communi-
cable disease; reducing allergen, toxin, and parasite exposure; 
ensuring vaccinations for children and staff; removing environ-
mental hazards; and preventing injuries.

P II-44   n  Part II  Growth, Development, and Behavior
All children will experience involuntary separations from, illness, 
and/or death of loved ones at some time in their lives. Parents 
and children may turn to their pediatrician and other health care 
professionals for help following various types of personal losses. 
Relatively brief separations of children from their parents, such 
as vacations, usually produce minor transient effects, but more 
enduring and frequent separation may cause sequelae. The poten-
tial impact of each event must be considered in light of the age 
and stage of development of the child, the particular relationship 
with the absent person, and the nature of the situation. As a 
trustworthy, familiar resource, pediatricians are uniquely posi-
tioned to offer information, support, and guidance, and to facili-
tate coping.
Separation and Loss
Separations may be due to temporary causes, such as vacations, 
parental job restrictions, natural disasters, or parental or sibling 
illness requiring hospitalization. More long-term separations 
occur due to divorce, placement in foster care, or adoption, while 
permanent separation may occur due to death. The initial reac-
tion of young children to separation of any duration may involve 
crying, either of a tantrum-like, protesting type or of a quieter, 
sadder type. Children’s behavior may appear subdued, with-
drawn, fussy, or moody, or they may demonstrate resistance to 
authority. Specific problems may include poor appetite, behavior 
issues such as acting against caregiver requests, reluctance to go 
to bed, sleep problems, or regressive behavior, such as requesting 
a bottle or bed-wetting. School-aged children may experience 
impaired cognitive functioning and poor performance in school. 
Some children may repeatedly ask for the absent parent and ques-
tion when he or she will return. The child may go to the window 
or door or out into the neighborhood to look for the absent 
parent; a few may even leave home or their place of temporary 
placement to search for their parents. Other children may not 
refer to the parental absence at all.
A child’s response to reunion may surprise or alarm an unpre-
pared parent. A parent who joyfully returns to the family may 
be met by wary or cautious children. After a brief interchange of 
affection, children may seem indifferent to the parent’s return. 
This response may indicate anger at being left and wariness that

the event will happen again, or the child may feel as if he or she 
caused the parent’s departure due to magical thinking. If the 
mother who frequently says “Stop it, or you’ll give me a head-
ache” is hospitalized, the child may feel at fault and guilty. As a 
result of these feelings, children may seem to be more closely 
attached to the other present parent than to the absent one, or 
even to the grandparent or baby sitter who cared for them during 
their parent’s absence. Some children, particularly younger ones, 
may become more clinging and dependent than they were before 
the separation, while continuing any regressive behavior that 
occurred during the separation. Such behavior may engage the 
returned parent more closely and help to re-establish the bond 
that the child felt was broken. Such reactions are usually transient 
and within 1-2 wk, children will have recovered their usual 
behavior and equilibrium. Recurrent separations may tend to 
make children more wary and guarded about re-establishing the 
relationship with the repeatedly absent parent, and these traits 
may affect other personal relationships. Parents should be advised 
not try to ameliorate a child’s behavior by threatening to leave.
Divorce
More sustained experiences of loss, such as divorce or placement 
in foster care, can give rise to the same kinds of reactions noted 
earlier, but they are more intense and possibly more lasting. Cur-
rently in the USA, about 40% of marriages end in divorce. 
Divorce has been found to be associated with negative parent 
functioning such as parental depression and feelings of incom­
petence, negative child behavior such as noncompliance and 
whining, and negative parent-child interaction such as inconsis-
tent discipline, decreased communication, and decreased affec-
tion. Greater childhood distress is associated with greater parental 
distress. Continued parental conflict and loss of contact with the 
noncustodial parent, usually the father, is common. Two of the 
most important factors that contribute to morbidity of the chil-
dren in a divorce include parental psychopathology and disrupted 
parenting before the separation. The year following the divorce 
is the period when problems are most apparent; these problems 
tend to dissipate over the next 2 yr. Depression may be present 
5 yr later, and educational or occupational decline may occur 
even 10 yr later. It is difficult to sort out all of the confounding 
factors. Children may suffer when exposed to parental conflict 
that continues after divorce, and in some cases may escalate. The 
degree of inter-parental conflict may be the most important factor 
associated with child morbidity. A continued relationship with 
the noncustodial parent, as long as there is minimal inter-parental 
conflict, was a factor associated with more positive outcomes.
School-aged children may respond with evident depression, 
may seem indifferent, or may be markedly angry. Other children 
appear to deny or avoid the issue, behaviorally or verbally. Most 
children cling to the hope that the actual placement or separation 
is not real and is only temporary. The child may experience guilt 
by feeling that the loss, separation, or placement represents rejec-
tion and perhaps punishment for misbehavior. Children may 
protect a parent and assume guilt, believing that their own 
“badness” caused the parent to depart. Outwardly blaming 
parents may be perceived by a child as fairly risky; parents who 
discover that a child harbors resentment might punish him or her 
further for these thoughts or feelings. Children who feel that their 
misbehavior caused their parents to separate or become divorced 
have the fantasy that their own trivial or recurrent behavioral 
patterns caused their parents to become angry with each other. 
Some children have behavioral or psychosomatic symptoms and 
unwittingly adopt a “sick” role as a strategy for reuniting their 
parents.
In response to divorce of parents and the subsequent separa-
tion and loss, older children and adolescents commonly show 
intense anger. Five years after the breakup, approximately one 
third of children report intense unhappiness and dissatisfaction

with their live and their reconfigured families, another one third 
show clear evidence of a satisfactory adjustment, whereas the 
remaining third demonstrate a mixed picture, with good achieve-
ment in some areas and faltering achievement in others. After 
10 yr, approximately 45% do well, but 40% may have academic, 
social, and/or emotional problems. As adults, some are reluctant 
to form intimate relationships, fearful of repeating their parents’ 
experience. Parental divorce has a moderate long-term negative 
impact on the adult mental health status of children who had 
experienced it, even after controlling for changes in economic 
status and problems before divorce. Good adjustment of children 
after a divorce is related to ongoing involvement with 2 psycho-
logically healthy parents who minimize conflict, and to the sib-
lings and other relatives who provide a positive support system. 
Divorcing parents should be encouraged to avoid adversarial 
processes and to use a trained mediator to resolve disputes if 
needed. Joint custody arrangements may reduce ongoing parental 
conflict, but children in joint custody may feel overburdened by 
the demands of maintaining a strong presence in 2 homes.
The primary care provider may provide an important role for 
divorcing and divorced parents and their children. When asked 
about the effects of divorce, parents should be informed that 
different children may have different reactions, but that the 
parents’ behavior and the way they interact with each other will 
have a major and long term effect on the child’s adjustment. The 
continued presence of both parents in the child’s life, with 
minimal inter-parental conflict, is most beneficial to the child.
Move/Family Relocation
A significant proportion of the population of the USA changes 
residence each year. The effects of this movement on children  
and families are frequently overlooked. For children, the move  
is essentially involuntary and out of their control. When such 
changes in family structure as divorce or death precipitate moves, 
children face the stresses created by both the precipitating events 
and the move itself. Parental sadness surrounding the move may 
transmit unhappiness to the children. Children who move lose 
their old friends, the comfort of a familiar bedroom and house, 
and their ties to school and community. They not only must sever 
old relationships but also are faced with developing new ones in 
new neighborhoods and new schools. Children may enter neigh-
borhoods with different customs and values, and because aca-
demic standards and curricula vary among communities, children 
who have performed well in one school may find themselves 
struggling in a new one. Frequent moves during the school years 
are likely to have adverse consequences on social and academic 
performance.
Migrant children and children who emigrate from other coun-
tries present with special circumstances. These children not only 
need to adjust to a new house, school, and community but also 
need to adjust to a new culture and, in many cases, a new lan-
guage. Because children have faster language acquisition than 
adults, they may function as translators for the adults in their 
families. This powerful position may lead to role reversal and 
potential conflict within the family. In the evaluation of migrant 
children and families, it is important to ask about the circum-
stances of the migration, including legal status, violence or threat 
of violence, conflict of loyalties, and moral, ethical, and religious 
differences.
Parents should prepare children well in advance of any move 
and allow them to express any unhappy feelings or misgivings. 
Parents should acknowledge their own mixed feelings and agree 
that they will miss their old home while looking forward to a 
new one. Visits to the new home in advance are often useful 
preludes to the actual move. Transient periods of regressive 
behavior may be noted in preschool children after moving, and 
these should be understood and accepted. Parents should assist 
the entry of their children into the new community, and whenever 
possible, exchanges of letters and visits with old friends should 
be encouraged.
Separation due to Hospitalization
Potential challenges for hospitalized children include coping with 
separation, adapting to the new hospital environment, adjusting 
to multiple caregivers, seeing very sick children, and sometimes 
experiencing the disorientation of intensive care, anesthesia, and 
surgery. To help mitigate potential problems, a preadmission visit 
to the hospital is important to allow the child to meet the people 
who will be offering care and ask questions about what will 
happen. Parents of children younger than 5-6 yr of age should 
room with the child if feasible. Older children may also benefit 
from parents staying with them while in the hospital, depending 
on the severity of their illness. Creative and active recreational or 
socialization programs with child life workers, chances to act out 
feared procedures in play with dolls or mannequins, and liberal 
visiting hours including visits from siblings are all helpful. Sensi-
tive, sympathetic, and accepting attitudes toward children and 
parents by the hospital staff are very important. Health care 
providers need to remember that parents have the best interest of 
their children at heart and know their children the best. When-
ever possible, school assignments and tutoring for the hospital-
ized children should be available in order to engage the child 
intellectually and prevent them from falling behind in their scho-
lastic achievements.
The psychologic aspects of illness should be evaluated from 
the outset, and physicians should act as a model for parents and 
children by showing interest in a child’s feelings, allowing them 
a venue for expression, and demonstrating that it is possible and 
appropriate to communicate discomfort in verbal, symbolic lan-
guage. Continuity of medical personnel may be reassuring to the 
child and family.
Parental/Sibling Death
Approximately 5-8% of U.S. children will experience parental 
death; rates are much higher in other parts of the world more 
directly affected by war, AIDS, and natural disasters (see Chapter 
36.2). Anticipated deaths due to chronic illness may place a  
significant strain on a family, with frequent bouts of illness, 
hospitalization, disruption of normal home life, absence of the  
ill parent, and perhaps more responsibilities placed on the  
child. Additional strains include changes in daily routines, finan-
cial pressures, and the need to cope with aggressive treatment 
options.
Children can and should continue to be involved with the sick 
parent or sibling, but they need to be prepared for what they will 
see in the home or hospital setting. The stresses that a child will 
face include visualizing the physical deterioration of the family 
member, helplessness, and emotional liability. Forewarning the 
child that the family member may demonstrate physical changes, 
such as appearing thinner or losing hair will help the child to 
adjust. These warnings, combined with simple yet specific expla-
nations of the need for equipment such as a nasogastric tube for 
nutrition, an oxygen mask, or a ventilator, will help lessen the 
child’s fear. The primary care provider can be of great help in 
addressing these issues. Children should be honestly informed of 
what is happening, in language they can understand, allowing 
them choices, but with parental involvement in decision-making. 
They should be encouraged, but not forced to see their ill family 
member. Parents who are caring for a dying spouse or child may 
be too emotionally depleted to be able to tend to their healthy 
child’s needs or to continue regular routines. Children of a dying 
parent may suffer the loss of security and belief in the world as 
a safe place, and the surviving parent may be inclined to impose 
his or her own need for support and comfort onto the child. 
However, the well parent and caring relatives must keep in mind

that children need to be allowed to remain children, with appro-
priate support and attention. Sudden, unexpected deaths lead to 
more anxiety and fear, because there was no time for preparation 
and uncertainty as to explanations.
Grief and Bereavement
Grief is a personal, emotional state of bereavement or an antici-
pated response to loss, such as a death. Common reactions 
include sadness, anger, guilt, fear, and at times, relief. The nor-
mality of these reactions needs to be emphasized. Most bereaved 
families remain socially connected and expect that life will 
return to some new, albeit different, sense of normalcy. The pain 
and suffering imposed by grief should never be automatically 
deemed “normal” and thus neglected or ignored. In uncompli-
cated grief reactions, the steadfast concern of the pediatrician 
can help promote the family’s sense of well-being. In more dis-
tressing reactions (such as those seen in traumatic grief of 
sudden deaths), the pediatrician may be a major, first-line force 
in helping children and families address their loss. Pediatricians’ 
involvement has become even more important since death of 
children has become less common. Fewer families have family 
members or friends who understand this experience. Hence, they 
turn to health care professionals more commonly for advice and 
support.
Participation in the care of a child with a life-threatening or 
terminal illness is a profound experience. Parents experience 
much anxiety and worry during the final stages of their child’s 
life. In one study at a children’s hospital, 45% of children dying 
from cancer died in the pediatric intensive care unit, and parents 
report that 89% of their children suffered “a lot” or “a great 
deal” during the last month of life. Physicians consistently under-
report children’s symptoms in comparison to parents’ reports. 
Better ways are needed to provide for dying children, and to 
maintain honest and open communication, provide appropriate 
pain management, and meet the families’ wishes as to the pre-
ferred location of the child’s death, in some cases in their own 
home. Inclusion of multiple disciplines, such as hospice, clergy, 
nursing, pain service, child life, and social work, often helps to 
fully support families during this difficult experience.
The practice of withholding information from children and 
parents regarding a child’s diagnosis and prognosis has generally 
been abandoned as physicians have learned that protecting 
parents and patients from the seriousness of their child’s condi-
tion does not alleviate concerns and anxieties. Even very young 
children may have a real understanding of their illness. Children 
who have serious diseases and are undergoing aggressive treat-
ments and medication regimens, but are told by their parents that 
they are okay, are not reassured by their parents. These children 
understand that something serious is happening to them, and they 
are often forced to suffer in silence and isolation because the 
message they have been given by their parents is to not discuss it 
and to maintain a cheerful demeanor. Children have the right to 
know their diagnosis and should be informed early in their treat-
ment. The content and depth of the discussion needs to be tai-
lored to the child’s personality and developmental level of 
understanding. Parents have choices as to how to orchestrate the 
disclosure. Parents may want to be the ones to inform the child 
themselves, may choose for the pediatric health care provider to 
do so, or may do it in partnership with the pediatrician.
A death, especially the death of a family member, is the most 
difficult loss for a child. Many changes in normal patterns of 
functioning may occur, including loss of love and support from 
the deceased family member, a change in income, the possible 
need to relocate, less emotional support from surviving family 
members, altering of routines, and a possible change in status 
from sibling to only child. Relationships between family members 
may become strained, and children may blame themselves or 
other family members for the death of a parent or sibling. 
Bereaved children may exhibit many of the emotions discussed 
earlier due to loss, in addition to behaviors of withdrawal into 
their own world, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and symptoms 
such as headache, abdominal pains, or possibly symptoms similar 
to those of the family member who has died. Children 3-5 yr of 
age who have experienced a family bereavement may show 
regressive behaviors such as bed-wetting and thumb sucking. 
School age children may exhibit nonspecific symptoms such as 
headache, abdominal pain, chest pain, fatigue, and lack of energy. 
Children and adolescents may also demonstrate enhanced anxiety 
should these symptoms resemble those of the family member who 
died. The presence of secure and stable adults who can meet the 
child’s needs and who permit discussion about the loss is most 
important in helping a child to grieve. The pediatrician should 
help the family understand this necessary presence and encourage 
the protective functioning of the family unit. More frequent visits 
to the health care professional may be necessary to address these 
symptoms and provide reassurance when appropriate.
Death, separation, and loss as a result of natural catastrophes 
and man-made disasters have become increasingly common 
events in children’s lives. Exposure to such disasters occurs either 
directly or indirectly, where the event is experienced through the 
media. Examples of indirect exposure include televised scenes of 
hurricanes, tsunamis, and the terrorist attacks in the USA on 
9/11/01, with the subsequent news stories about anthrax and 
heightened states of alert. Children who experience personal loss 
in disasters tend to watch more television coverage than children 
who do not. However, children without a personal loss watch as 
a way of participating in the event and may thus experience 
repetitive exposure to traumatic scenes and stories. The loss and 
devastation for a child who personally lives through a disaster is 
significant; the effect of the simultaneous occurrence of disaster 
and personal loss complicates the bereavement process as grief 
reactions become interwoven with post-traumatic stress symp-
toms. After a death that occurs as a result of aggressive or trau-
matic circumstances, access to expert help may be required. 
Under conditions of threat and fear, children seek proximity to 
safe, stable, protective figures.
It is important for parents to grieve with their children. Some 
parents feel they want to protect their children from their grief, 
so they put on an outwardly brave front or don’t talk about the 
deceased family member. Instead of the desired protective effect, 
however, the child receives the message that demonstrating grief 
or talking about death is wrong, leading him or her to feel iso-
lated, to grieve privately, or to delay grieving. The child may also 
conclude that the parents didn’t really care about the deceased 
since they have forgotten him or her so easily or demonstrate no 
emotion. The parents’ efforts to avoid talking about the death 
may cause them to isolate themselves from their children at a time 
when they are most needed. Children need to know that their 
parents love them and will continue to protect them. Children 
need opportunities to talk about their relative’s death and associ-
ated memories. A surviving sibling may feel guilty simply because 
he or she has survived, especially if the death was due to an 
accident that involved both children. Siblings’ grief, especially 
when compounded by feelings of guilt, may be manifested by 
regressive behavior or anger. Parents should be informed of this 
possibility and encouraged to discuss the possibility with their 
children.
Developmental Perspective
Children’s responses to death reflect the family’s current culture, 
their past heritage, experiences, and the sociopolitical environ-
ment. Personal experience with terminal illness and dying may 
also facilitate children’s comprehension of death and familiarity 
with mourning. Developmental differences in children’s efforts to 
make sense of and master the concept and reality of death do 
exist and profoundly influence their grief reactions.

Chapter 16  Loss, Separation, and Bereavement  n  P II-47
Children younger than 3 yr of age have little or no under-
standing of the concept of death. Despair, separation anxiety, and 
detachment may occur at the withdrawal of nurturing caretakers. 
Young children may respond in reaction to observing distress in 
others, such as a parent or sibling who is crying, withdrawn, or 
angry. Young children also express signs and symptoms of grief 
in their emotional states, such as irritability or lethargy, and in 
severe cases, mutism. If the reaction is severe, failure to thrive 
may occur.
Preschool children are in the preoperational cognitive stage, 
in which communication takes place through play and fantasy. 
They do not show well-established cause-and-effect reasoning. 
They feel that death is reversible, analogous to someone going 
away. In attempts to master the finality and permanence of death, 
preschoolers frequently ask unrelenting, repeated questions about 
when the person who died will be returning. This makes it dif-
ficult for parents, who may become frustrated because they don’t 
understand why the child keeps asking and do not like the con-
stant reminders of the person’s death. The primary care provider 
has a very important role in helping families understand the 
child’s struggle to comprehend death. Preschool children typically 
express magical explanations of death events, sometimes resulting 
in guilt and self-blame (“He died because I wouldn’t play with 
him.” “She died because I was mad at her.”). Some children have 
these thoughts, but do not express them verbally due to embar-
rassment or guilt. Parents and primary care providers need to be 
aware of magical thinking and must reassure preschool children 
that their thoughts had nothing to do with the outcome. Children 
this age are often frightened by prolonged, powerful expressions 
of grief by others. Children conceptualize events in the context 
of their own experiential reality, and therefore consider death in 
terms of sleep, separation, and injury. Young children express 
grief intermittently and show marked affective shifts over brief 
periods. Regression, accompanied by longing, sadness, and anger, 
may accompany grief.
Younger school-aged children think concretely, recognize that 
death is irreversible but feel it will not happen to them or affect 
them, and begin to understand biologic processes of the human 
body (“You’ll die if your body stops working”). Information 
gathered from the media, peers, and parents forms lasting impres-
sions. Consequently, they may ask candid questions about death 
that adults will have difficulty addressing (“He must have been 
blown to pieces, huh?”).
Children 9 yr of age and older do understand that death is 
irreversible and that it may involve them or their families. These 
children tend to experience more anxiety, overt symptoms of 
depression, and somatic complaints than do younger children. 
School-aged children are often left with anger focused on the 
loved one, those who could not save the deceased, or those pre-
sumed responsible for the death. Contact with the pediatrician 
may provide great reassurance, especially for the child with 
somatic symptoms, and particularly when the death followed a 
medical illness. School and learning problems may also occur, 
and these reactions are often linked to difficulty concentrating or 
preoccupation with the death. Close collaboration with the 
child’s school may provide important diagnostic information and 
offer opportunities to mobilize intervention or support.
At 12-14 yr of age, children begin to use symbolic thinking, 
reason abstractly, and analyze hypothetical, or “what if,” sce-
narios systematically. Death and the end of life become concepts, 
rather than events. Teenagers are often ambivalent about depen-
dence and independence and may withdraw emotionally from 
surviving family members, only to mourn in isolation. Adoles-
cents begin to understand complex physiologic systems in  
relationship to death. Since they are often egocentric, they  
may be more concerned about the impact of the death on them-
selves than about the deceased or other family members. Fascina-
tion with dramatic, sensational, or romantic death sometimes 
occurs and may find expression in copycat behavior, such as 
cluster suicides, as well as competitive behavior to forge emo-
tional links to the deceased person (“He was my best friend.”). 
Somatic expression of grief may revolve around highly complex 
syndromes (eating disorders or conversion reactions) as well as 
symptoms limited to the more immediate perceptions, as with 
younger children (stomachaches). Quality of life takes on 
meaning, and the teenager develops a focus on the future. Depres-
sion, resentment, mood swings, rage, and risk-taking behaviors 
can emerge as the adolescent seeks answers to questions of values, 
safety, evil, and fairness. Alternately, the adolescent may seek 
philosophical or spiritual explanations (“being at peace”) to  
ease their sense of loss. The death of a peer may be especially 
traumatic.
Families often struggle with how to inform their children of 
the death of a family member. The answer depends on the child’s 
developmental level. It is best to avoid misleading euphemisms 
and metaphor. A child who is told that the relative who died 
“went to sleep” may become frightened of falling asleep, resulting 
in sleep problems or nightmares. Children can be told that the 
person is “no longer living” or “no longer moving or feeling.” 
Using examples of pets that have died sometimes can help chil-
dren gain a more realistic idea of the meaning of death. Parents 
who have religious beliefs may comfort their children with expla-
nations, such as “Your sister’s soul is in heaven” or “Grandfather 
is now with God,” provided those beliefs are honestly held. If 
these are not religious beliefs that the parents share, children will 
sense the insincerity and experience anxiety rather than the 
hoped-for reassurance. Children’s books about death can provide 
an important source of information, and when read together, 
these books may help the parent to find the right words, while 
addressing the child’s needs.
Role of the Pediatrician in Grief
The pediatrician has an important role in assisting grieving fami-
lies, because death has become an uncommon experience in our 
society. Whereas in earlier times, parents could turn to other 
family members or friends who had had a similar experience, 
bereaved parents are now more likely to turn to their physician, 
hospital staff, or medical home staff for support. The pediatric 
health care provider who has had a longitudinal relationship with 
the family will be an important source of support in the disclosure 
of bad news and critical decision-making, during both the dying 
process and the bereavement period.
The involvement of the health care provider may include being 
present at the time the diagnosis is disclosed, at the hospital or 
home at the time of death, being available to the family by phone 
during the bereavement period, sending a sympathy card, attend-
ing the funeral, and/or scheduling a follow-up visit. Attendance 
at the funeral sends a strong message that the family and their 
child are important, respected by the health care provider, and 
can also help the pediatric health care provider to grieve and 
reach personal closure about the death. A family meeting 1-3 mo 
later may be helpful since parents may not be able to formulate 
their questions at the time of death. This meeting allows the 
family time to ask questions, share concerns, and review autopsy 
findings (if one was performed), and allows the health care pro-
vider to determine how the parents and family are adjusting to 
the death.
Instead of leaving the family feeling abandoned by a health 
care system that they have counted on, this visit allows them to 
have continued support. This is even more important when the 
health care provider will be continuing to provide care for surviv-
ing siblings. The visit can be used to determine how the mourning 
process is progressing, detect evidence of marital discord, and 
evaluate how well surviving siblings are coping. This is also an 
opportunity to evaluate whether referrals to support groups or 
mental health providers may be of benefit. Continuing to recog-
nize the child who has died is important. Families appreciate the

receipt of a card on their child’s birthday or the anniversary of 
their child’s death.
The health care provider needs to be an educator about 
disease, death, and grief. The pediatrician can offer a safe envi-
ronment for the family to talk about painful emotions, express 
fears, and share memories. By giving families permission to talk 
and modeling how to address children’s concerns, the pediatri-
cian demystifies death. Parents often request practical help. The 
health care provider can offer families resources, such as litera-
ture (both fiction and nonfiction), referrals to therapeutic ser-
vices, and tools to help them learn about illness, loss, and grief. 
In this way, the physician reinforces the sense that other people 
understand what they are going through and helps to normalize 
their distressing emotions. The pediatrician can also facilitate 
and demystify the grief process by sharing basic tenets of grief 
therapy. There is no single right or wrong way to grieve. Every-
one grieves differently; mothers may grieve differently than 
fathers, and children mourn differently than adults. Helping 
family members to respect these differences and reach out to 
support each other is critical. Grief is not something to “get 
over,” but a lifelong process of adapting, readjusting, and 
reconnecting.
Parents may need help in knowing what constitutes normal 
grieving. Hearing, seeing, or feeling their child’s presence may be 
a normal response. Vivid memories or dreams may occur. The 
pediatrician can help parents to learn that, although their pain 
and sadness may seem intolerable, other parents have survived 
similar experiences, and their pain will lessen over time. The 
support of the pediatrician, medical home staff, support groups, 
or individual counselors may be needed during this time.
Pediatricians are often asked whether children should attend 
the funeral of a parent or sibling. These rituals allow the family 
to begin their mourning process. Children older than 4 yr of age 
should be given a choice. If the child chooses to attend, he or she 
should have a designated, trusted adult, who is not part of the 
immediate family, to stay with the child, offer comfort, and be 
willing to leave with the child if the experience proves to be 
overwhelming. If the child chooses not to attend, he or she should 
be offered additional opportunities to share in a ritual, go to the 
cemetery to view the grave, tell stories about the deceased, or 
obtain a keepsake object from the deceased family member as a 
remembrance.
In the era of regionalized tertiary care medicine, the primary 
care provider and medical home staff may not be informed when 
one of their patients dies in the hospital. Yet, this communication 
is critically important. Families assume their pediatrician has 
been notified, and often feel hurt when they don’t receive some 
symbol of condolence. Because of their longitudinal relationship 
with the family, primary care providers may offer much needed 
support. There are practical issues, such as the need to cancel 
previously made appointments and the need to alert office and 
nursing staff so that they are prepared should the family return 
for a follow-up visit or for ongoing health maintenance care with 
the surviving siblings. Even minor illnesses in the surviving sib-
lings may frighten children. Parents may contribute to this anxiety 
since their inability to protect the child who has died may leave 
them with a sense of guilt or helplessness. They may seek medical 
attention sooner or may be hypervigilant in the care of the sib-
lings because of guilt over the other child’s death, concern about 
their judgment, or the need for continued reassurance. A visit to 
the pediatrician can do a lot to allay their fears.
Clinicians must remain vigilant for risk factors in each family 
member and in the family unit as a whole. Primary care provid-
ers, who care for families over time, know bereft patients’ pre-
morbid functioning and can identify those at current or future 
risk for physical and psychiatric morbidity. Providers must focus 
on symptoms that interfere with a patient’s normal activities  
and compromise a child’s attainment of developmental tasks. 
Symptom duration, intensity, and severity, in context with the 
family’s culture, can help identify complicated grief reactions 
in need of therapeutic attention. Descriptive words, such as 
“unrelenting,” “intense,” “intrusive,” or “prolonged,” should 
raise concern. Total absence of signs of mourning, specifically, 
an inability to discuss the loss or express sadness, also suggests 
potential problems.
No specific sign, symptom, or cluster of behaviors identifies 
the child or family in need of help. Further assessment is indicated 
if the following occur: (1) persistent somatic or psychosomatic 
complaints of undetermined origin (headache, stomachache, 
eating and sleeping disorders, conversion symptoms, symptoms 
related to the deceased’s condition, hypochondriasis); (2) unusual 
circumstances of death or loss (sudden, violent, or traumatic 
death; inexplicable, unbelievable, or particularly senseless death; 
prolonged, complicated illness; unexpected separation); (3) 
school or work difficulties (declining grades or school perfor-
mance, social withdrawal, aggression); (4) changes in home or 
family functioning (multiple family stresses, lack of social support, 
unavailable or ineffective functioning of caretakers, multiple dis-
ruptions in routines, lack of safety); (5) concerning psychologic 
factors (persistent guilt or blame, desire to die or talk of suicide, 
severe separation distress, disturbing hallucinations, self-abuse, 
risk-taking behaviors, symptoms of trauma such as hyperarousal 
or severe flashbacks, grief from previous or multiple deaths). 
Children who are intellectually impaired may require additional 
support.
Treatment
Suggesting interventions outside the natural support network of 
family and friends can often prove useful to grieving families. 
Bereavement counseling should be readily offered if needed or 
requested by the family. Interventions that enhance or promote 
attachments and security, as well as give the family a means  
of expressing and understanding death, help to reduce the  
likelihood of future or prolonged disturbance, especially in chil-
dren. Collaboration between pediatric and mental health profes-
sionals can help determine the timing and appropriateness of 
services.
Interventions for children and families who are struggling to 
cope with a loss in the community include gestures such as 
sending a card or offering food to the relatives of the deceased 
and teaching children the etiquette of behaviors and rituals 
around bereavement and mutual support. Performing community 
service or joining charitable organizations, such as fund-raising 
in memory of the deceased, may be useful. In the wake of a 
disaster, parents and older siblings can give blood or volunteer 
in search and recovery efforts. When a loss does not involve an 
actual death (e.g., parental divorce or geographic relocation), 
empowering the child to join or start a “divorced kids’ club” in 
school or planning a “new kids in town” party may help. Partici-
pating in a constructive activity helps move the family away from 
a sense of helplessness and hopelessness and helps them to find 
meaning in their loss.
Psychotherapeutic services may benefit the entire family or 
individual members. Many support or self-help groups focus on 
specific types of losses (sudden infant death syndrome, suicide, 
widow/widowers, or AIDS) and provide an opportunity to talk 
with other people who have experienced similar losses. Family, 
couple, sibling or individual counseling may be useful, depending 
on the nature of the residual coping issues. Combinations of 
approaches may work well for children or parents with evolving 
needs. A child may participate in family therapy to deal with the 
loss of a sibling and use individual treatment to address issues of 
personal ambivalence and guilt related to the death.
The question of pharmacologic intervention for grief reactions 
often arises. Explaining that medication does not cure grief 
and often does not reduce the intensity of some symptoms (sepa-
ration distress) can help. Although medication can blunt reac-

Chapter 17  Sleep Medicine  n  P II-49
Introduction
Sleep regulation involves the simultaneous operation of two basic 
highly coupled processes that govern sleep and wakefulness (the 
“two process” sleep system). The homeostatic process (“Process 
S”), primarily regulates the length and depth of sleep, and may 
be related to the accumulation of adenosine and other sleep-
promoting chemicals (“somnogens”), such as cytokines, during 
prolonged periods of wakefulness. This sleep pressure appears to 
build more quickly in infants and young children, thus limiting 
the duration of sustained wakefulness during the day and neces-
sitating periods of daytime sleep (i.e., naps). The endogenous 
circadian rhythm (“Process C”), influences the internal organiza-
tion of sleep and timing and duration of daily sleep-wake cycles, 
and govern predictable patterns of alertness throughout the 24 hr 
day. The “master circadian clock” that controls sleep-wake pat-
terns is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the

tions, the psychologic work of grieving still must occur. The 
pediatrician must consider the patient’s premorbid psychiatric 
vulnerability, current level of functioning, other available sup-
ports, and the use of additional therapeutic interventions. Medi-
cation, as a first line of defense, rarely proves useful in normal 
or uncomplicated grief reactions. In certain situations (severe 
sleep disruption, incapacitating anxiety, or intense hyperarousal), 
use of an anxiolytic or antidepressant medication for symptom 
relief and to provide the patient with the emotional energy to 
mourn may help. Medication used in conjunction with some form 
of psychotherapy, and in consultation with a psychopharmacolo-
gist, has optimal results.
Children who are refugees and may have experienced war, 
violence, or personal torture deserve special mention. These chil-
dren, while often resilient, may experience post-traumatic stress 
disorder if exposures were severe or repeated. Sequelae such as 
depression, anxiety, and grief need to be addressed, and mental 
health therapy is indicated. Cognitive behavioral treatment, use 
of journaling and narratives to bear witness to the experiences, 
and use of translators may be essential.
SpirituaL iSSueS
Responding to patients’ and families’ spiritual beliefs can help in 
comforting them during family tragedies. Offering to call members 
of pastoral care teams or their own spiritual leader can be a real 
support to them and aid in decision-making. Families have found 
it important to have their beliefs and their need for hope acknowl-
edged in end-of-life care. The majority of patients report welcom-
ing discussions on spirituality, which may help individual patients 
cope with illness, disease, dying, and death. In addressing spiri-
tuality, physicians need to follow certain guidelines, including 
maintaining respect for the patient’s beliefs, following the 
patient’s lead in exploring how spirituality affects his or her 
decision-making, acknowledging the limits of their own expertise 
and role in spirituality, and maintaining their own integrity by 
not saying or doing anything that violates their own spiritual or 
religious views. Health care providers should not impose their 
own religious or antireligious beliefs on patients, but rather 
should listen respectfully to their patients. By responding to spiri-
tual needs, physicians may better aid their patients and families 
in end-of-life care and bereavement and take on the role of 
healers.
SeLF-care oF tHe HeaLtH care provider
Just as the death of a child is a very stressful experience for the 
family, it is also a very powerful one for health care providers. 
Since the death of a child is contrary to everything for which a 
pediatrician strives, the death of a patient can cause a grief reac-
tion in physicians that is comparable to the death of a loved one, 
resulting in emotions of sadness, anger, guilt, and occasionally, 
relief. A medical culture in which health care providers acknowl-
edge their own grief and mourning and select ways to address it 
is important. Possibilities include attending the memorial service 
or funeral, participating in a debriefing with colleagues within 
the hospital or medical home, and creating opportunities to both 
mourn the patient’s death and celebrate the patient’s life. Getting 
regular exercise, maintaining good nutrition, getting adequate 
sleep, meditating, spending time with family and friends, taking 
time for journaling and self-reflection, participating in hobbies, 
and taking vacations are all examples of self-care. Health care 
providers have demanding but rewarding jobs. They need to 
maintain their inner strength and resilience in order to be effective 
in their profession. The way that a health care professional inte-
grates the death of a child can change this experience from a very 
tragic and stressful one, leading to burnout, to a rewarding and 
memorable experience, in which he or she functions as a true 
healer to a family.

ventral hypothalamus; other “circadian clocks” govern the timing 
of multiple other physiologic systems in the body (e.g., cardio-
vascular reactivity, hormone levels, renal and pulmonary func-
tions). Because the human circadian clock is actually slightly 
longer than 24 hr, intrinsic circadian rhythms must are synchro-
nized or “entrained” to the 24-hr day cycle by environmental 
cues called zeitgebers. The most powerful of these zeitgebers is 
the light–dark cycle; light signals are transmitted to the SCN via 
the circadian photoreceptor system within the retina (functionally 
and anatomically separate from the visual system), which switch 
the body’s production of the hormone melatonin off (light) or on 
(dark) by the pineal gland. Circadian rhythms are also synchro-
nized by other external time cues, such as timing of meals and 
alarm clocks.
The relative level of sleepiness (sleep propensity) or alertness 
existing at any given time during a 24-hr period is partially deter-
mined by the duration and quality of previous sleep, as well as 
time awake since the last sleep period (the homeostatic or “sleep 
drive”). Interacting with this “sleep homeostat” is the 24 hr 
cyclic pattern or rhythm characterized by clock-dependent periods 
of maximum sleepiness (“circadian troughs”) and maximum 
alertness (“circadian nadirs”). There are 2 periods of maximum 
sleepiness, 1 in the late afternoon (3:00-5:00 pm) and one towards 
the end of the night (3:00-5:00 am), and 2 periods of maximum 
alertness, 1 in mid-morning and 1 in the evening, just prior to 
sleep onset (the so-called second wind).
Another basic principle of sleep physiology relates to the con-
sequences of the failure to meet basic sleep needs, termed insuf-
ficient/inadequate sleep or sleep loss. Adequate sleep is a biologic 
imperative that appears necessary for sustaining life as well as for 
optimal functioning. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) appears to be the 
most “restorative” form of sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) 
sleep appears not only to be involved in vital cognitive functions, 
such as the consolidation of memory, but to be an integral com-
ponent of the growth and development of the central nervous 
system (CNS). Adequate amounts of both of these sleep stages 
are necessary for optimal learning. Partial sleep loss (sleep restric-
tion) on a chronic basis accumulates in what is termed a sleep 
debt and produces deficits equivalent to those seen under condi-
tions of total sleep deprivation. If the sleep debt becomes large 
enough and is not voluntarily paid back (by obtaining adequate 
recovery sleep), the body may respond by overriding voluntary 
control of wakefulness, resulting in periods of decreased alert-
ness, dozing off, and napping, that is excessive daytime sleepi-
ness. The sleep-deprived individual may also experience very brief 
(several seconds) repeated daytime microsleeps of which he or 
she may be completely unaware, but which nonetheless may 
result in significant lapses in attention and vigilance. There is also 
a relationship between the amount of sleep restriction and per-
formance, with decreased performance correlating with decreased 
sleep.
Both insufficient quantity and poor quality of sleep in children 
and adolescents usually result in excessive daytime sleepiness and 
decreased daytime alertness levels. Sleepiness may be recognizable 
as drowsiness, yawning, and other classic “sleepy behaviors,” but 
can also be manifested as mood disturbance, including com-
plaints of moodiness, irritability, emotional lability, depression, 
and anger; fatigue and daytime lethargy, including increased 
somatic complaints (headaches, muscle aches); cognitive impair-
ment, including problems with memory, attention, concentration, 
decision-making, and problem solving; daytime behavior prob-
lems, including overactivity, impulsivity, and noncompliance; 
and academic problems, including chronic tardiness related to 
insufficient sleep and school failure resulting from chronic 
daytime sleepiness.
To evaluate sleep problems, it is important to have an under-
standing of what constitutes “normal” sleep in children and 
adolescents. Sleep disturbances, as well as many characteristics 
of sleep itself, have some distinctly different features in children 
from sleep and sleep disorders in adults. In addition, changes in 
sleep architecture and the evolution of sleep patterns and behav-
iors reflect the physiologic/chronobiologic, developmental, and 
social/environmental changes that are occurring across child-
hood. These trends may be summarized as the gradual assump-
tion of more adult sleep patterns as children mature:
•	 A decline in the average 24 hr sleep duration from infancy 
through adolescence, which involves a decrease in both diurnal 
and nocturnal sleep amounts. There is a dramatic decline in 
daytime sleep (scheduled napping) by 5 yr, with a less marked 
and more gradual continued decrease in nocturnal sleep 
amounts into late adolescence.
•	 A dramatic decrease in the proportion of REM sleep from birth 
(50% of sleep) through early childhood into adulthood (25-
30%), and a similar initial predominance of SWS that peaks 
in early childhood, drops off abruptly after puberty (40-60% 
decline), and then further decreases over the life span. This 
SWS preponderance in early life has clinical significance; the 
high prevalence of partial arousal parasomnias (sleepwalking 
and sleep terrors) in preschool and early school-aged children 
is related to the relative increased proportion of SWS in this 
age group.
•	 Due to the lengthening of the nocturnal ultradian sleep cycle, 
a concomitant decrease in the number of end-of-cycle arousals 
across the nocturnal sleep period occurs.
•	 A gradual shift to a later bedtime and sleep onset time that 
begins in middle childhood and accelerates in early to mid 
adolescence.
•	 Irregularity of sleep/wake patterns characterized by increas-
ingly larger discrepancies between school night and non–school 
night bedtimes and wake times, and increased weekend over-
sleep that typically begins in middle childhood and peaks in 
adolescence.
Normal developmental changes in children’s sleep are found 
in Table 17-1.
Common Sleep Disorders
Most sleep problems in children may be broadly conceptualized 
as resulting from either inadequate duration of sleep for age and 
sleep needs (insufficient sleep quantity) or disruption and frag-
mentation of sleep (poor sleep quality) as a result of frequent, 
repetitive, and brief arousals during sleep. Less common causes 
of sleep disturbance in childhood involve inappropriate timing of 
the sleep period (as occurs in circadian rhythm disturbances), or 
primary disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness (central hyper-
somnias such as narcolepsy). Insufficient sleep is usually the result 
of difficulty initiating (delayed sleep onset) and/or maintaining 
sleep (prolonged night wakings), but, especially in older children 
and adolescents, may also represent a conscious lifestyle decision 
to sacrifice sleep in favor of competing priorities, such as home-
work and social activities. The underlying causes of sleep onset 
delay/prolonged night wakings or sleep fragmentation may in 
turn be related to primarily behavioral factors (bedtime resistance 
resulting in shortened sleep duration) and/or medical causes 
(obstructive sleep apnea causing frequent, brief arousals).
It should be noted that certain pediatric populations are rela-
tively more vulnerable to acute or chronic sleep problems. These 
include children with medical problems, including chronic ill-
nesses, such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis, 
and acute illnesses, such as otitis media; children taking medi­
cations or ingesting substances with stimulant (e.g., psychostimu-
lants, caffeine), sleep-disrupting (e.g., corticosteroids), or daytime 
sedating (some anticonvulsants, α-agonists) properties; hospi­
talized children; and children with a variety of psychiatric disor-
ders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 
depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. Children 
with neurodevelopmental disorders may be more prone to noc-

The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a formal recommendation 
in 2005 advocating against bed sharing in the first year of life, 
instead encouraging proximate but separate sleeping surfaces for 
mother and infant.
Safe sleep practices for infants:
Place the baby on his or her back to sleep at night and during nap 
times.
Place the baby on a firm mattress with a well-fitting sheet in a 
safety-approved crib.
Do not use pillows or comforters
Cribs should not have corner posts over 116 in high or decorative 
cut-outs.
Make sure the baby’s face and head stay uncovered and clear of 
blankets and other coverings during sleep.
Most sleep issues that are 
perceived as problematic at this 
stage represent a discrepancy 
between parental expectations 
and developmentally 
appropriate sleep behaviors. 
Newborns who are noted by 
parents to be extremely fussy 
and persistently difficult to 
console are more likely to have 
underlying medical issues, such 
as colic, gastroesophageal 
reflux, and formula intolerance.

(note that there is great 
individual variability in sleep

Sleep regulation or self-soothing involves the infant’s ability to 
negotiate the sleep-wake transition, both at sleep onset and 
following normal awakenings throughout the night. The capacity to 
self-soothe begins to develop in the 1st 12 wk of life, and is a 
reflection of both neurodevelopmental maturation and learning.
Sleep consolidation, or “sleeping through the night,” is usually defined

Insomnia of Childhood
Insomnia may be broadly defined as repeated difficulty initiating 
and/or maintaining sleep that occurs despite age-appropriate time 
and opportunity for sleep. These sleep complaints must also 
result in some degree of impairment in daytime functioning for 
the child and/or family, which may range from fatigue, irritabil-
ity, lack of energy, and mild cognitive impairment to effects on 
mood, school performance, and quality of life. Insomnia com-
plaints may be of a short-term and transient nature (usually 
related to an acute event), or may be characterized as long-term 
and chronic. Insomnia is a set of symptoms with a large number 
of possible etiologies (e.g., pain, medication, medical and psychi-
atric conditions, learned behaviors) and not as a diagnosis per se. 
Insomnia, like many behavioral issues in children, is often pri-
marily defined by parental concerns rather than by objective 
criteria, and therefore should be viewed in the context of family 
(i.e., maternal depression, stress), child (i.e., temperament, devel-
opmental level), and environmental (i.e., cultural practices, sleep-
ing space) considerations.
One of the most common sleep disorders found in infants and 
toddlers is behavioral insomnia of childhood, sleep onset associa-
tion type. In this disorder, the child learns to fall asleep only 
under certain conditions or associations which typically require 
parental presence, such as being rocked or fed, and does not 
develop the ability to self-soothe. During the night, when the 
child experiences the type of brief arousal that normally occurs 
at the end of a sleep cycle (every 60-90 minutes in infants) or 
awakens for other reasons, he or she is not able to get back to 
sleep without those same conditions being present. The infant 
then “signals” the parent by crying (or coming into the parents’

bedroom, if the child is no longer in a crib) until the necessary 
associations are provided. The problem is one of prolonged night 
waking resulting in insufficient sleep (for both child and parent).
Management of night wakings should include establishment 
of a set sleep schedule and bedtime routine, and implementation 
of a behavioral program. The treatment approach typically 
involves a program of rapid withdrawal (extinction) or more 
gradual withdrawal (graduated extinction) of parental assistance 
at sleep onset and during the night. Extinction (“cry it out”) 
involves putting the child to bed at a designated bedtime, “drowsy 
but awake,” and then systematically ignoring the child until a set 
time the next morning. Although it has considerable empirical 
support, extinction is often not an acceptable choice for families. 
Graduated extinction involves weaning the child from depen-
dence on parental presence with periodic “checks” by the parents 
at successively longer intervals during the sleep-wake transition; 
the exact amount of time is determined by the parents’ tolerance 
for crying and the child’s temperament. The goal is to allow the 
infant or child to develop skills in self-soothing during the night, 
as well as at bedtime. In older infants, the introduction of more 
appropriate sleep associations that will be readily available to the 
child during the night (transitional objects, such as a blanket or 
toy), in addition to positive reinforcement (i.e., stickers for 
remaining in bed), is often beneficial; If the child has become 
habituated to awaken for nighttime feedings (“learned hunger”), 
then these feedings should be slowly eliminated. Parents must be 
consistent in applying behavioral programs to avoid inadvertent, 
intermittent reinforcement of night wakings; they should also be 
forewarned that crying behavior often temporarily escalates at 
the beginning of treatment (“post-extinction burst”).
Bedtime problems, including stalling and refusing to go to bed, 
are more common in preschool-aged and older children. Sleep 
disturbances of this type generally fall within the diagnostic cat-
egory known as behavioral insomnia of childhood, limit setting 
type, and are often the result of parental difficulties in setting 
limits and managing behavior, including the inability or unwill-
ingness to set consistent bedtime rules and enforce a regular 
bedtime, and may be exacerbated by the child’s oppositional 
behavior. In some cases the child’s resistance at bedtime is due 
to an underlying problem in falling asleep that is caused by other 
factors (medical conditions, such as asthma or medication use; a 
sleep disorder, such as restless legs syndrome; or anxiety) or a 
mismatch between the child’s intrinsic circadian rhythm (“night 
owl”) and parental expectations.
Successful treatment of limit setting sleep disorder generally 
involves a combination of parent education regarding appro­
priate limit setting, decreased parental attention for bedtime-
delaying behavior, establishment of bedtime routines, and positive 
reinforcement (sticker charts) for appropriate behavior at bedtime; 
other behavioral management strategies that have empirical 
support include bedtime fading (temporarily setting the bedtime 
closer to the actual sleep onset time and then gradually advancing 
the bedtime to an earlier target bedtime). Older children may 
benefit from being taught relaxation techniques to help them-
selves fall asleep more readily. Following the principles of sleep 
hygiene for children is essential (Table 17-2).
When the insomnia is not primarily a result of parent behavior 
or secondary to another sleep disturbance, or to a psychiatric or 
medical problem, it is referred to as psychophysiologic or primary 
insomnia, also sometimes called “learned insomnia.” Primary 
insomnia usually occurs largely in adolescents and is character-
ized by a combination of learned sleep-preventing associations 
and heightened physiologic arousal resulting in a complaint of 
sleeplessness and decreased daytime functioning. A hallmark of 
primary insomnia is excessive worry about sleep and an exagger-
ated concern of the potential daytime consequences. The physi-
ologic arousal can be in the form of cognitive hypervigilance, 
such as “racing” thoughts; in many individuals with insomnia an 
increased baseline level of arousal is further intensified by this 
secondary anxiety about sleeplessness. Treatment usually involves 
educating the adolescent about the principles of sleep hygiene 
(Table 17-3), institution of a consistent sleep-wake schedule, 
avoidance of daytime napping, instructions to use the bed for 
sleep only and to get out of bed if unable to fall asleep (stimulus 
control), restricting time in bed to the actual time asleep (sleep 
restriction), addressing maladaptive cognitions about sleep, and 
teaching relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety. Hypnotic medi-
cations are rarely needed.
Obstructive Sleep Apnea
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children encompasses a 
broad spectrum of respiratory disorders that occur exclusively in 
or are exacerbated by sleep, and includes primary snoring and 
upper airway resistance syndrome, as well as apnea of prematu-
rity and central apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most 
important clinical entity within the SDB spectrum, is a respiratory 
disorder that is characterized by repeated episodes of prolonged 
upper airway obstruction during sleep despite continued or 
increased respiratory effort, resulting in complete (apnea) or 
partial (hypopnea; ≥50% reduction in airflow) cessation of 
airflow at the nose and/or mouth, as well as in disrupted sleep. 
Both intermittent hypoxia and the multiple arousals resulting 
from these obstructive events likely contribute to significant  
metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurocognitive/neurobehavioral 
morbidity.
Primary snoring is defined as snoring without associated ven-
tilatory abnormalities (e.g., apneas or hypopneas, hypoxemia, 
hypercapnia) or respiratory-related arousals, and is a manifesta-
tion of the vibrations of the oropharyngeal soft tissue walls that 
occur when an individual attempts to breathe against increased 
Table 17-2  BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SLEEP HYGIENE FOR CHILDREN
1.	 Have a set bedtime and bedtime routine for your child.
2.	 Bedtime and wake-up time should be about the same time on school nights and non-school nights. There should not be more than about an hour difference 
from one day to another.
3.	 Make the hour before bed shared quiet time. Avoid high-energy activities, such as rough play, and stimulating activities, such as watching television or playing 
computer games, just before bed.
4.	 Don’t send your child to bed hungry. A light snack (such as milk and cookies) before bed is a good idea. Heavy meals within an hour or two of bedtime, however, 
may interfere with sleep.
5.	 Avoid products containing caffeine for at least several hours before bedtime. These include caffeinated sodas, coffee, tea, and chocolate.
6.	 Make sure your child spends time outside every day whenever possible and is involved in regular exercise.
7.	 Keep your child’s bedroom quiet and dark. A low-level night light is acceptable for children who find completely dark rooms frightening.
8.	 Keep your child’s bedroom at a comfortable temperature during the night (<75°F).
9.	 Don’t use your child’s bedroom for time-out or punishment.
10.	 Keep the television set out of your child’s bedroom. Children can easily develop the bad habit of “needing” the television to fall asleep. It’s also much more 
difficult to control your child’s viewing if the set is in the bedroom.

upper airway resistance during sleep. Children with primary 
snoring may still have subtle breathing abnormalities during 
sleep, including evidence of increased respiratory effort, which in 
turn may be associated with adverse neurodevelopmental 
outcomes.
Etiology  In general terms, OSA results from an anatomically 
or functionally narrowed upper airway; this typically involves 
some combination of decreased upper airway patency (upper 
airway obstruction and/or decreased upper airway diameter), 
increased upper airway collapsibility (reduced pharyngeal muscle 
tone), and decreased drive to breathe in the face of reduced upper 
airway patency (reduced central ventilatory drive) (Table 17-4). 
Upper airway obstruction varies in degree and level (i.e., nose, 
nasopharynx/oropharynx, hypopharynx) and is most commonly 
due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, although tonsillar size does 
not necessarily correlate with degree of obstruction, especially in 
older children. Other causes of airway obstruction include aller-
gies associated with chronic rhinitis/nasal obstruction; craniofa-
cial abnormalities, including hypoplasia/displacement of the 
maxilla and mandible; gastroesophageal reflux with resulting 
pharyngeal reactive edema; nasal septal deviation; and velopha-
ryngeal flap cleft palate repair. Reduced upper airway tome may 
result from neuromuscular diseases, including hypotonic cerebral 
palsy and muscular dystrophies, or hypothyroidism. Reduced 
central ventilatory drive may be present in some children with 
Arnold-Chiari malformation and meningomyelocele. In other 
situations, the etiology is mixed; individuals with Down syn-
drome, by virtue of their facial anatomy, hypotonia, macroglos-
sia, and central adiposity, as well as the increased incidence of 
hypothyroidism, are at particularly high risk for OSA, with some 
estimates of as great as 70% prevalence.
Although many children with OSA are of normal weight, an 
increasingly large percentage are overweight or obese, and many 
of these children are school-aged and younger. There is a signifi-
cant correlation between weight and SDB (habitual snoring, 
OSA, central apneas). While adenotonsillar hypertrophy also 
plays an important etiologic role in overweight/obese children 
with OSA, mechanical factors related to an increase in the amount 
of adipose tissue in the throat (pharyngeal fat pads), neck 
(increased neck circumference), and chest wall and abdomen can 
create increased upper airway resistance, worsen gas exchange, 
and increased work of breathing, particularly in the supine posi-
tion and during REM sleep. There may be a component of 
blunted central ventilatory drive in response to hypoxia/hyper-
capnia and hypoventilation as well, particularly in children with 
morbid or syndrome-based (Prader-Willi) obesity. Overweight 
and obese children and adolescents are at a particularly high risk 
for metabolic and cardiovascular complications of SDB, such as 
insulin resistance and systemic hypertension; morbidly obese chil-
dren may also be at increased risk for postoperative complica-
tions following adenotonsillectomy.
Epidemiology  Overall prevalence of parent-reported snoring in 
the pediatric population is about 8%; “always” snoring is 
reported in 1.5-6%, and “often” snoring in 3-15%. When defined 
by parent-reported symptoms, the prevalence of OSA is 4-11%. 
The prevalence of pediatric OSA as documented by overnight 
sleep studies utilizing ventilatory monitoring procedures (e.g., 
in-lab PSG, home studies) is 1-4% overall, with a reported range 
of 0.1-13%. Prevalence is also affected by the demographic char-
acteristics, such as age (increased prevalence between 2 and 8 yr), 
gender (more common in boys, especially after puberty), race/
ethnicity (increased prevalence in African-American and Asian 
children), and family history of OSA.
Pathogenesis  The upregulation of inflammatory pathways, as 
indicated by an increase in peripheral markers of inflammation 
such as C-reactive protein (CRP), appear to be linked to meta-
bolic dysfunction (e.g., insulin resistance, dyslipidemia) in both 
Table 17-3  BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SLEEP HYGIENE FOR ADOLESCENTS
1.	 Wake up and go to bed at about the same time every night. Bedtime and wake-up time should not differ from school to non-school nights by more than 
approximately an hour.
2.	 Avoid sleeping in on weekends to “catch up” on sleep. This makes it more likely that you will have problems falling asleep.
3.	 If you take naps, they should be short (no more than an hour) and scheduled in the early to midafternoon. However, if you have a problem with falling asleep at 
night, napping during the day may make it worse and should be avoided.
4.	 Spend time outside every day. Exposure to sunlight helps to keep your body’s internal clock on track.
5.	 Exercise regularly. Exercise may help you fall asleep and sleep more deeply.
6.	 Use your bed for sleeping only. Don’t study, read, listen to music, watch television, etc., on your bed.
7.	 Make the 30-60 minutes before a quiet or wind-down time. Relaxing, calm, enjoyable activities, such as reading a book or listening to calm music, help your body 
and mind slow down enough to let you get to sleep. Don’t study, watch exciting/scary movies, exercise, or get involved in “energizing” activities just before bed.
8.	 Eat regular meals and don’t go to bed hungry. A light snack before bed is a good idea; eating a full meal in the hour before bed is not.
9.	 Avoid eating or drinking products containing caffeine from dinner time on. These include caffeinated sodas, coffee, tea, and chocolate.
10.	 Do not use alcohol. Alcohol disrupts sleep and may cause you to awaken throughout the night.
11.	 Smoking disturbs sleep. Don’t smoke at least one hour before bed (and preferably, not at all!).
12.	 Don’t use sleeping pills, melatonin, or other over-the-counter sleep aids to help you sleep unless specifically recommended by your doctor. These can be 
dangerous, and the sleep problems often return when you stop taking the medicine.

obese and non-obese children with OSA. Both systemic inflam-
mation and arousal-mediated increases in sympathetic autonomic 
nervous system activity with altered vasomotor tone may be key 
contributors to increased cardiovascular risk in both adults and 
children with OSA. Mechanical stress on the upper airway 
induced by chronic snoring may also result in both local mucosal 
inflammation of adenotonsillar tissues and subsequent upregula-
tion of inflammatory molecules, most notably leukotrienes. 
Another potential mechanism that may mediate cardiovascular 
sequelae in both adults and children with OSA is altered endo-
thelial function.
Although yet to be fully elucidated, one of the primary mecha-
nisms by which OSA is believed to exert negative influences on 
cognitive function appears to involve repeated episodic arousals 
from sleep leading to sleep fragmentation and resulting sleepi-
ness. An equally important role may be intermittent hypoxia that 
leads directly to systemic inflammatory vascular changes in the 
brain. Levels of inflammatory markers such as CRP and cytokine 
IL-6 are elevated in children with OSA and are also associated 
with cognitive dysfunction.
Clinical Manifestations  The clinical manifestations of OSA 
may be divided into sleep-related and daytime symptoms. The 
most common nocturnal manifestations of OSA in children and 
adolescents are loud, frequent, and disruptive snoring, breathing 
pauses, choking or gasping arousals, restless sleep, and nocturnal 
diaphoresis. Many children who snore do not have OSA, but very 
few children with OSA do not snore. Most children, like adults, 
tend to have more frequent and more severe obstructive events 
in REM sleep and when sleeping in the supine position. Children 
with OSA may adopt unusual sleeping positions, keeping their 
necks hyperextended in order to maintain airway patency. Fre-
quent arousals associated with obstruction may result in noctur-
nal awakenings, but are more likely to cause fragmented sleep.
Daytime symptoms of OSA include mouth breathing and dry 
mouth, chronic nasal congestion/rhinorrhea, hyponasal speech, 
morning headaches, difficulty swallowing, and poor appetite. 
Children with OSA may have secondary enuresis, most likely as 
a result of the disruption of the normal nocturnal pattern of 
antidiuretic hormone secretion. Partial arousal parasomnias 
(sleepwalking and sleep terrors) may occur more frequently in 
children with OSA, related to the frequent associated arousals 
and an increased percentage of delta sleep, or SWS.
One of the most important but frequently overlooked sequelae 
of OSA in children is the effect on mood, behavior, learning, and 
academic functioning. The neurobehavioral consequences of 
OSA in children include daytime sleepiness with drowsiness, dif-
ficulty in morning waking, and unplanned napping or dozing off 
during activities, although evidence of frank hypersomnolence 
tends to be less common in children compared to adults with 
OSA. Mood changes include increased irritability, mood instabil-
ity and emotional dysregulation, low frustration tolerance, and 
depression/anxiety. Behavioral issues include both “internaliz-
ing” (i.e., increased somatic complaints and social withdrawal) 
and “externalizing” behaviors, including aggression, impulsivity, 
hyperactivity, oppositional behavior, and conduct problems. 
There is a substantial overlap between the clinical impairments 
associated with OSA and the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, 
including inattention, poor concentration, and distractibility (see 
Chapter 30). There also appears to be a selective impact of OSA 
specifically on “executive functions,” which include cognitive 
flexibility, task initiation, self-monitoring, planning, organiza-
tion, and self-regulation of affect and arousal; executive function 
deficits are also a hallmark of ADHD.
Studies that have looked at changes in behavior and neuro-
psychologic functioning in children following treatment (usually 
adenotonsillectomy) for OSA have largely documented significant 
improvement in outcomes, in both the short and long term, of 
OSA syndrome post-treatment, including daytime sleepiness, 
mood, behavior, academics, and quality of life. Many studies 
have failed to find a dose-dependent relationship between OSA 
in children and specific neurobehavioral/neurocognitive deficits, 
suggesting that other factors may influence neurocognitive out-
comes, including individual genetic susceptibility, environmental 
influences such as passive smoking exposure, and co-morbid con-
ditions, such as obesity, shortened sleep duration, and the pres-
ence of other sleep disorders.
Diagnosis  The American Academy of Pediatrics clinical prac-
tice guidelines provide excellent information for the evaluation 
and management of uncomplicated childhood OSA (Table 17-5). 
There are no physical examination findings that are truly pathog-
nomonic for OSA, and most healthy children with OSA appear 
normal; certain physical examination findings may suggest OSA. 
Growth parameters may be abnormal (obesity or, less commonly, 
failure to thrive), and there may be evidence of chronic nasal 
obstruction (hyponasal speech, mouth breathing, septal devia-
tion, “adenoidal facies”), as well as signs of atopic disease (i.e., 
“allergic shiners”). Oropharyngeal examination may reveal 
enlarged tonsils, excess soft tissue in the posterior pharynx, and 
a narrowed posterior pharyngeal space. Any abnormalities of the 
facial structure, such as retrognathia and/or micrognathia, mid-
facial hypoplasia, best appreciated by inspection of the lateral 
facial profile, increase the likelihood of OSA and should be noted. 
In very severe cases, there may be evidence of pulmonary hyper-
tension, right-sided heart failure, and cor pulmonale; systemic 
hypertension, unlike in adults, is relatively uncommon.
Because no combination of clinical history and physical find-
ings can accurately predict which children with snoring have 
OSA, the gold standard for diagnosing OSA remains an overnight 
polysomnogram (PSG).
An overnight PSG is a technician-supervised, monitored study 
that documents physiologic variables during sleep; sleep staging, 
arousal measurement, cardiovascular parameters, and body 
movements (EEG, EOG, chin and leg EMG, ECG, body position 
sensors, and video recording), and a combination of breathing 
monitors (oronasal thermal sensor and nasal air pressure trans-
ducer for airflow, chest/abdominal monitors (e.g., inductance 
plethysmography for respiratory effort, pulse oximeter for O2 
saturation, end-tidal or transcutaneous CO2 for hypercarbia, 
snore microphone). The polysomnographic parameter most com-
monly used in evaluating for sleep disordered breathing is the 
apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), which indicates the number of 
apneic and hypopneic events per hr of sleep. It should be noted 
that currently there are no universally accepted polysomno-
graphic normal reference values and parameters for diagnosing 
OSA in children, and it is still unclear which parameters best 
predict morbidity. Normal preschool and early school-aged chil-
dren may have a total AHI of less than 1.5, and this is the most 
widely used cutoff value for OSA in children 12 yr and below; 
in adolescents, the adult cutoff of an AHI ≥5 is generally used. 
Table 17-5  AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CLINICAL PRACTICE 
GUIDELINES FOR OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA SYNDROME  
(APRIL 2002)
All children should be screened for snoring.
Complex high-risk patients should be referred to a specialist.
Patients with cardiorespiratory failure cannot await elective evaluation.
Diagnostic evaluation is useful in discriminating between primary snoring and 
obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, the gold standard being polysomnography.
Adenotonsillectomy is the first line of treatment for most children, and 
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an option for those who are not 
candidates for surgery or do not respond to surgery.
High-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively.
Patients should be re-evaluated postoperatively to determine whether additional 
treatment is required.

Chapter 17  Sleep Medicine  n  P II-55
In cases in which the AHI is between 1 and 5 obstructive events 
per hour, clinical judgment regarding risk factors for SDB, evi-
dence of daytime sequelae, and the technical quality of the over-
night sleep study should determine further management.
Treatment  There are presently no universally accepted guide-
lines regarding the indications for treatment of pediatric SDB 
(i.e., including primary snoring and OSA). Current recommenda-
tions largely emphasize weighing what is known about the poten-
tial cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive sequelae of 
SDB in children in combination with the individual health care 
professional’s clinical judgment. The decision of whether and 
how to treat OSA specifically in children is contingent on a 
number of parameters, including severity (nocturnal symptoms, 
daytime sequelae, sleep study results), duration of disease, and 
individual patient variables such as age, co-morbid conditions, 
and underlying etiologic factors. In the case of moderate to severe 
disease (AHI >10), the decision to treat is usually straightforward, 
and most pediatric sleep experts recommend that any child with 
an apnea index >5 should be treated.
In the majority of cases of pediatric OSA, adenotonsillectomy 
is the first-line treatment in any child with significant adenotonsil-
lar hypertrophy, even in the presence of additional risk factors 
such as obesity. Adenotonsillectomy in uncomplicated cases gen-
erally (70-90% of children) results in complete resolution of 
symptoms; regrowth of adenoidal tissue after surgical removal 
occurs in some cases. Groups considered high-risk include young 
children (<3 yr old), as well as those with severe OSA docu-
mented on polysomnography, significant clinical sequelae of OSA 
(e.g., failure to thrive), or associated medical conditions, such 
as craniofacial syndromes, morbid obesity, and hypotonia. All 
patients should be re-evaluated postoperatively to determine 
whether additional evaluation and/or treatment are required. If 
there are significant residual risk factors (e.g., obesity) or contin-
ued symptoms of OSA, a follow-up sleep study at least 6 wk 
post-adenotonsillectomy may be indicated.
Additional treatment measures that may be appropriate 
include weight loss, positional therapy (attaching a firm object, 
such as a tennis ball, to the back of a sleep garment to prevent 
the child from sleeping in the supine position), and aggressive 
treatment of additional risk factors when present, such as asthma, 
seasonal allergies, and gastroesophageal reflux; there is some 
evidence that intranasal corticosteroids and leukotriene inhibitors 
may be helpful in mild OSA. Other surgical procedures, such as 
uvulopharyngopalatoplasty, and maxillofacial surgery (mandibu-
lar distraction osteogenesis and maxillomandibular advance-
ment), are seldom performed in children but may be indicated in 
selected cases. Oral appliances, such as mandibular advancing 
devices and tongue retainers, are typically considered for adoles-
cents in whom facial bone growth is largely complete.
Continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure (nasal CPAP 
or BiPAP) is the most common treatment for OSA in adults and 
can be used successfully in children and adolescents. CPAP deliv-
ers humidified, warmed air through an interface (mask, nasal 
pillows) that, under pressure, effectively “splints” the upper 
airway open. Optimal pressure settings (that abolish or signifi-
cantly reduce respiratory events without increasing arousals or 
central apneas) are determined in the sleep lab during a full night 
CPAP titration. Efficacy studies at the current pressure and reti-
trations should be conducted periodically with long-term use 
(every 6 mo in young children and at least yearly or with signifi-
cant weight changes in older children and adolescents). CPAP 
may be recommended if removing the adenoids and tonsils is not 
indicated, if there is residual disease following adenotonsillec-
tomy, or if there are major risk factors that are not amenable to 
treatment with surgery (obesity, hypotonia).
Parasomnias
Parasomnias are defined as episodic nocturnal behaviors that 
often involve cognitive disorientation and autonomic and skeletal 
muscle disturbance. Parasomnias may be further characterized as 
occurring primarily during NREM sleep (partial arousal para-
somnias or in association with REM sleep, including nightmares, 
hypnogogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis; other common 
parasomnias include sleep-talking. Sleep-related movement disor-
ders, including restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement 
disorder (RLS/PLMD) and rhythmic movement disorder (head 
banging, body rocking), are reviewed in a separate section below.
Etiology  Partial arousal parasomnias, which include sleepwalk-
ing, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals are more common in 
preschool and school-aged children because of the relatively 
higher percentage of SWS in younger children. Any factor that is 
associated with an increase in the relative percentage of SWS 
(certain medications, previous sleep deprivation) may increase the 
frequency of events in a predisposed child. There appears to be 
a genetic predisposition for both sleepwalking and night terrors. 
In contrast, nightmares, which are much more common than the 
partial arousal parasomnias but are often confused with them, 
are concentrated in the last third of the night, when REM sleep 
is most prominent. Partial arousal parasomnias may also be dif-
ficult to distinguish from nocturnal seizures. Table 17-6 sum-
marizes similarities and differences among these nocturnal arousal 
events.
Epidemiology  Many children (15-40%) sleepwalk on at least 
one occasion; the prevalence of children who regularly sleepwalk 
is approximately 17%, and 3-4% have frequent episodes. Sleep-
walking may persist into adulthood, with the prevalence in adults 
of about 4%. The prevalence is approximately 10 times greater 
in children with a family history of sleepwalking. Approximately 
1-6% of children experience sleep terrors, primarily during the 
preschool and elementary school years, and the age of onset is 
usually between 4 and 12 yr. Because of the common genetic 
predisposition, the prevalence of sleep terrors in children who 
sleepwalk is about 10%. Although sleep terrors can occur at any 
age from infancy through adulthood, most individuals outgrow 
sleep terrors by adolescence. Confusional arousals commonly 
co-occur with sleepwalking and sleep terrors; prevalence rates

P II-56   n  Part II  Growth, Development, and Behavior
have been estimated to be upwards of 15% in children ages 
3-13 yr.
Clinical Manifestations  The partial arousal parasomnias have 
several features in common. Because they typically occur at the 
transition out of “deep” or SWS, partial arousal parasomnias 
have clinical features of both the awake (ambulation, vocaliza-
tions) and the sleeping (high arousal threshold, unresponsiveness 
to the environment) states; there is usually amnesia for the events. 
The typical timing of partial arousal parasomnias during the first 
few hours of sleep is related to the predominance of SWS in the 
first third of the night; the duration is typically a few minutes 
(sleep terrors) to an hour (confusional arousals). Sleep terrors are 
sudden in onset and characteristically involve a high degree of 
autonomic arousal (i.e., tachycardia, dilated pupils), while con-
fusional arousals typically arise more gradually from sleep, may 
involve thrashing around but usually not displacement from bed, 
and are often accompanied by slow mentation on arousal from 
sleep (“sleep inertia”). Sleepwalking may be associated with 
safety concerns (e.g., falling out of windows, wandering outside). 
Avoidance of, or increased agitation with, comforting by parents 
or attempts at awakening are also common features of all partial 
arousal parasomnias.
Treatment  Management of partial arousal parasomnias 
involves some combination of parental education and reassur-
ance, good sleep hygiene, and avoidance of exacerbating factors 
such as sleep deprivation and caffeine. Particularly in the case of 
sleepwalking, it is important to institute safety precautions such 
as use of gates in doorways and at the top of staircases, locking 
of outside doors and windows, and installation of parent notifica-
tion systems such as bedroom door alarms. Scheduled awaken-
ings, a behavioral intervention that involve having the parent 
wake the child approximately 15 to 30 min before the time of 
night that the first parasomnia episode is most likely to be suc-
cessful in situations in which partial arousal episodes occur on a 
nightly basis. Pharmacotherapy is rarely necessary, but may be 
indicated in cases of frequent or severe episodes, high risk of 
injury, violent behavior, or serious disruption to the family; the 
primary pharmacologic agents used are potent SWS suppressants, 
primarily benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants.
Sleep-Related Movement Disorders: Restless Legs Syndrome/
Periodic Limb Movement Disorder and Rhythmic Movements
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic, primarily sensory 
disorder, characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the lower 
extremities that are accompanied by an almost irresistible urge 
to move the legs. The sensations are usually at least partially 
relieved by movement, including walking, stretching, and rubbing, 
but only as long as the motion continues. RLS is a clinical diag-
nosis that is based on the presence of these key symptoms.  
Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is characterized by 
periodic, repetitive, brief (0.5-10 sec), and highly stereotyped 
limb jerks typically occurring at 20 to 40 sec intervals. These 
movements occur primarily during sleep, most commonly occur 
in the legs, and frequently consist of rhythmic extension of the 
big toe and dorsiflexion at the ankle. The diagnosis of periodic 
limb movements (PLMs) requires overnight polysomnography to 
document the characteristic limb movements with anterior tibialis 
EMG leads.
Etiology  “Early-onset” RLS (i.e., onset of symptoms before 
35-40 yr of age), often termed “primary” RLS, appears to have 
a particularly strong genetic component. Low serum iron levels 
in both adults and children may be an important etiologic factor 
for the presence and severity of both RLS symptoms and PLMs. 
As a marker of decreased iron stores, serum ferritin levels in both 
children and adults with RLS are frequently low. The underlying 
mechanism that has been postulated is related to the role of iron 
as a cofactor of tyrosine hydroxylase in a rate-limiting step of the 
synthesis of dopamine; in turn, dopaminergic dysfunction has 
been implicated as playing a key role particularly in the genesis 
of the sensory component of RLS, as well as in PLMD. Certain 
medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal 
disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, and preg-
nancy, may also be associated with RLS/PLMD, as are specific 
medications (i.e., antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, anti-
depressants, and H-2 blockers such as cimetidine) and substances 
(e.g., caffeine).
Epidemiology  Previous studies have found prevalence rates of 
RLS in the pediatric population ranging from 1-6%; the percent 
of 8-17 yr olds meeting criteria for “definite” RLS is approxi-
mately 2%. Prevalence rates of PLMs greater than 5 per hour in 
clinical populations of children referred for sleep studies range 
from 5-27%; in survey studies of PLM symptoms, rates are 
8-12%. Several studies in referral populations have found that 
PLMs occur in as much as one fourth of children diagnosed with 
ADHD.
Clinical Manifestations  In addition to the sensory component 
and the urge to move the legs, most RLS episodes begin or are 
exacerbated by rest or inactivity, such as lying in bed to fall asleep 
or riding in a car for prolonged periods. A unique feature of RLS 
is that the timing of symptoms also appears to have a circadian 
component, in that they often peak in the evening hours. Some 
children may complain of “growing pains,” although this is con-
sidered a nonspecific feature. Because RLS symptoms are usually 
worse in the evening, bedtime struggles and difficulty falling 
asleep are 2 of the most common presenting complaints. In con-
trast to patients with RLS, individuals with PLMs are usually 
unaware of these movements; these movements may result in 
arousals during sleep and consequent significant sleep disruption. 
Parents of children with RLS/PLMD may complain that their 
child is a restless sleeper, moves around or even falls out of bed 
during the night.
Treatment  The decision of whether and how to treat RLS 
depends on the level of severity (intensity, frequency, and peri-
odicity) of sensory symptoms, the degree of interference with 
sleep, and the impact of daytime sequelae in a particular child or 
adolescent. With PLMs, for an index (PLMs per hr) less than 5, 
usually no treatment is recommended; for an index over 5, the 
decision to specifically treat PLMs should be based on the pres-
ence or absence of nocturnal symptoms (restless or nonrestorative 
sleep) and daytime clinical sequelae. A reasonable initial approach 
would be to promote good sleep hygiene (including restricting 
caffeine) and instituting iron supplements in children if serum 
ferritin levels are low (<50); the recommended dose is typically 
in the range of 6 mg/kg/day for a duration of 3-6 mo. Medications 
that increase dopamine levels in the CNS, such as ropinirole and 
pramipexole, have been found to be effective in relieving RLS/
PLMD symptoms in adults; data in children are extremely limited.
Sleep-related rhythmic movements, including head banging, 
body rocking, and head rolling, are characterized by repetitive, 
stereotyped, and rhythmic movements or behaviors that involve 
large muscle groups. These behaviors typically occur with the 
transition at sleep at bedtime, but also at nap times and following 
nighttime arousals. Children typically engage in these behaviors 
as a means of soothing themselves to (or back to) sleep; they are 
much more common in the 1st yr of life and usually disappear 
by 4 yr of age. In most instances, rhythmic movement behaviors 
are benign, because sleep is not significantly disrupted as a result 
of these movements and associated significant injury is rare. 
These behaviors typically occur in normally developing children, 
and in the vast majority of cases their presence does not indicate 
that there is some underlying neurological or psychological 
problem. Usually, the most important aspect in management of 
sleep-related rhythmic movements is reassurance to the family 
that this behavior is normal, common, benign, and self-limited.

Chapter 17  Sleep Medicine  n  P II-57
daytime sleepiness (EDS), reduced baseline alertness, and/or pro-
longed nighttime sleep periods that interfere with normal daily 
functioning. It is important to recognize that there are many 
potential causes of EDS, which may be broadly grouped as 
“extrinsic” (e.g., secondary to insufficient and/or fragmented 
sleep) or “intrinsic” (e.g., resulting from an increased need for 
sleep). Narcolepsy is a chronic lifelong CNS disorder, typically 
presenting in adolescence and early adulthood, that is character-
ized by profound daytime sleepiness and resultant significant 
functional impairment. Other symptoms frequently associated 
with narcolepsy, cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucina-
tions, and sleep paralysis, may be conceptualized as representing 
the “intrusion” of REM sleep features into the waking state.
Etiology  There is a specific deficit in the hypothalamic orexin/
hypocretin neurotransmitter system in the genesis of narcolepsy 
with cataplexy. The underlying pathogenesis of narcolepsy 
involves selective loss of cells that secrete hypocretin/orexin in 
the lateral hypothalamus; it has been postulated that autoimmune 
mechanisms, possibly triggered by viral infections, in combina-
tion with a genetic predisposition and environmental factors, may 
be involved. Human leukocyte antigen testing also shows a strong 
association with narcolepsy; however, the vast majority of indi-
viduals with this antigen do not have narcolepsy. Although the 
majority of cases of narcolepsy are considered idiopathic, “sec-
ondary” narcolepsy with cataplexy may also result from CNS 
insults.
Epidemiology  The prevalence of narcolepsy is reported to be 
between 3 and 16 per 10,000, with the prevalence of narcolepsy 
with cataplexy approximately 0.2 -0.5/10,000. The risk of devel-
oping narcolepsy with cataplexy in a first-degree relative of a 
narcoleptic patient is estimated at 1-2%; this represents an 
increase of 10- to 40-fold compared to the general population.
Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis  The typical onset of 
symptoms of narcolepsy is in adolescence and early adulthood, 
although symptoms may initially present in school-aged and even 
younger children. The early manifestations of narcolepsy are 
often ignored, misinterpreted, or misdiagnosed as other medical, 
neurologic, and psychiatric conditions, and the appropriate diag-
nosis is frequently delayed for a number of years.
The most prominent clinical manifestation of narcolepsy is 
profound daytime sleepiness, characterized by both an increased 
baseline level of daytime drowsiness and by the repeated occur-
rence of sudden and unpredictable sleep episodes. These “sleep 
attacks” are often described as “irresistible” in that the child or 
adolescent is unable to stay awake despite considerable effort, 
and they occur even in the context of normally stimulating activi-
ties (e.g., during meals, in the middle of a conversation). Very 
brief (several seconds) sleep attacks may also occur in which the 
individual may “stare off,” appear unresponsive, or continue to 
engage in an ongoing activity (automatic behavior). Cateplexy is 
considered pathognomonic for narcolepsy. Cataplexy is rarely 
the first symptom of narcolepsy, but it often develops within the 
1st year of the onset of EDS. It is described as an abrupt, bilateral, 
partial or complete loss of muscle tone, classically triggered by 
an intense positive emotion (e.g., laughter, surprise). The cata-
plectic attacks are typically brief (seconds to minutes), and fully 
reversible, with complete recovery of normal tone when the 
episode ends. Hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations involve 
vivid visual, auditory, and sometimes tactile sensory experiences 
occurring during transitions between sleep and wakefulness, pri-
marily at sleep onset (hypnagogic) and sleep offset (hypnopom-
pic). Sleep paralysis is the inability to move or speak for a few 
seconds or minutes at sleep onset or offset, and often accom­
panies the hallucinations. Other symptoms associated with 
narcolepsy include disrupted nocturnal sleep, inattention, and 
behavioral and mood issues.
Overnight polysomnography followed by a multiple sleep 
latency test (MSLT) are strongly recommended components of 
the evaluation of a patient with profound unexplained daytime 
sleepiness or suspected narcolepsy. The purpose of the overnight 
PSG is to evaluate for primary sleep disorders, such as OSA that 
may cause EDS. The MSLT involves a series of 5 opportunities 
to nap (20 min long), during which narcoleptics demonstrate a 
pathologically shortened sleep onset latency as well as periods of 
REM sleep occurring immediately after sleep onset.
Treatment  An individualized narcolepsy treatment plan usually 
involves education, good sleep hygiene, behavioral changes, and 
medication. Scheduled naps may be helpful. Medications such as 
psychostimulants and modafinil are often prescribed to control 
the EDS. The goal should be to allow the fullest possible return 
of normal functioning in school, at home, and in social situations. 
Medications such as tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin reup-
take inhibitors may also be used to control the REM-associated 
phenomena, such as cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and 
sleep paralysis.
Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder
Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), a circadian rhythm disor-
der, involves a significant, persistent, and intractable phase shift 
in sleep-wake schedule (later sleep onset and wake time) that 
conflicts with the individual’s normal school, work, and/or life-
style demands. DSPD may occur at any age, but is most common 
in adolescents and young adults.
Etiology  Individuals with DSPD often start out as night owls; 
that is, they have an underlying predisposition or circadian pref-
erence for staying up late at night and sleeping late in the morning, 
especially on weekends, holidays, and summer vacations. The 
underlying pathophysiology of DSPD is still unknown, although 
some authors have theorized that it involves an intrinsic abnor-
mality in the circadian oscillators that govern the timing of the 
sleep period.
Epidemiology  Studies indicate that DSPD affects approximately 
7-16% of adolescents.
Clinical Manifestations  The most common clinical presenta-
tion is sleep initiation insomnia when the individual attempts to 
fall asleep at a “socially acceptable” desired bedtime, accompa-
nied by extreme difficulty getting up in the morning even for 
desired activities, and daytime sleepiness. Sleep maintenance is 
generally not problematic, and no sleep onset insomnia is expe-
rienced if bedtime coincides with the preferred sleep onset time 
(e.g., on weekends, school vacations). School tardiness and fre-
quent absenteeism are often present.
Treatment  The goal in the treatment of DSPD is basically 
2-fold: first, shifting the sleep-wake schedule to an earlier time, 
and second, maintaining the new schedule. Gradual advancement 
of bedtime in the evening and rise time in the morning typically 
involves shifting bedtime/wake time earlier by 15-30 min incre-
ments; more significant phase delays (difference between current 
sleep onset and desired bedtime) may require “chronotherapy,” 
which involves delaying bedtime and wake time by 2-3 hr daily 
to every other day. Exposure to light in the morning (either 
natural light or a “light box”) and avoidance of evening light 
exposure are often beneficial. Exogenous oral melatonin supple-
mentation may also be used; larger doses (i.e., 5 mg) are typically 
given at bedtime, but some studies have suggested that physio-
logic doses of oral melatonin (0.3-0.5 mg) administered in the 
afternoon or early evening (i.e., 5-7 hr before the habitual sleep 
onset time) seem to be most effective in advancing the sleep phase.
Health Supervision
It is especially important for pediatricians to both screen for and 
recognize sleep disorders in children and adolescents during 
health encounters. The well child visit is an opportunity to 
educate parents about normal sleep in children and to teach 
strategies to prevent sleep problems from developing (primary 
prevention) or from becoming chronic, if problems already exist 
(secondary prevention). Developmentally appropriate screening

P II-58   n  Part II  Growth, Development, and Behavior
for sleep disturbances should take place in the context of every 
well child visit and should include a range of potential sleep 
problems; one simple sleep screening algorithm, the “BEARS,” is 
outlined in Table 17-7. Because parents may not always be aware 
of sleep problems, especially in older children and adolescents, it 
is also important to question the child directly about sleep con-
cerns. The recognition and evaluation of sleep problems in chil-
dren requires both an understanding of the association between 
sleep disturbances and daytime consequences, such as irritability, 
inattention, and poor impulse control, and familiarity with the 
developmentally appropriate differential diagnoses of common 
presenting sleep complaints (difficulty initiating and maintaining 
sleep, episodic nocturnal events). An assessment of sleep patterns 
and possible sleep problems should be part of the initial evalua-
tion of every child presenting with behavioral and/or academic 
problems, especially ADHD.
Effective preventive measures include educating parents of 
newborns about normal sleep amounts and patterns. The ability 
to regulate sleep, or control internal states of arousal to fall asleep 
at bedtime and to fall back asleep during the night, begins to 
develop in the first 12 wk of life. Thus, it is important to recom-
mend that parents put their 2-4 mo old infants to bed “drowsy 
but awake” to avoid dependence on parental presence at sleep 
onset and to foster the infants’ ability to self-soothe. Other 
important sleep issues include discussing the importance of 
regular bedtimes, bedtime routines, and transitional objects for 
toddlers, and providing parents and children with basic informa-
tion about good “sleep hygiene” and adequate sleep amounts.
The cultural and family context within which sleep problems 
in children occur should be considered. Co-sleeping of infants 
and parents is a common and accepted practice in many ethnic 
groups, including African-Americans, Hispanics, and Southeast 
Asians. The goal of independent self-soothing in young infants 
may not be shared by these families. On the other hand, the 
institution of co-sleeping by parents as an attempt to address a 
child’s underlying sleep problem, rather than as a lifestyle choice, 
is likely to yield only a temporary respite from the problem and 
may set the stage for more significant sleep issues.
Evaluation of Pediatric Sleep Problems
The clinical evaluation of a child presenting with a sleep problem 
involves obtaining a careful medical history to assess for potential 
medical causes of sleep disturbances, such as allergies, concomi-
tant medications, and acute or chronic pain conditions. A devel-
opmental history is important because of the aforementioned 
frequent association of sleep problems with developmental delays 
and autism spectrum disorders. Assessment of the child’s current 
level of functioning (school, home) is a key part of evaluating 
possible mood, behavioral, and neurocognitive sequelae of sleep 
problems. Current sleep patterns, including the usual sleep dura-
tion and sleep-wake schedule, are often best assessed with a sleep 
diary, in which parents record daily sleep behaviors for an 
extended period. A review of sleep habits, such as bedtime rou-
tines, daily caffeine intake, and the sleeping environment (e.g., 
temperature, noise level) may reveal environmental factors that 
contribute to the sleep problems. Nocturnal symptoms that may 
be indicative of a medically based sleep disorder, such as OSA 
(loud snoring, choking or gasping, sweating) or PLMs (restless 
sleep, repetitive kicking movements), should be elicited. An over-
night sleep study is seldom warranted in the evaluation of a child 
with sleep problems unless there are symptoms suggestive of OSA 
or periodic leg movements, unusual features of episodic nocturnal 
events, or daytime sleepiness that is unexplained.
