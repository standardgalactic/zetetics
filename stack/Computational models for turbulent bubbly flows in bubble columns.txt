ABSTRACT
Bubble columns are widely used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries as gas–liquid
contactors because of their simple construction and ability to provide high contact area for mass
and heat transfer. The design and scale up of bubble columns depends on heat/mass transfer
and mixing characteristics provided by it. These two factors highly depend on the bubbly
ﬂow hydrodynamics of the column. Although simple in construction, the bubbly ﬂow hydrody-
namics inside bubble columns are complex due the presence of turbulence and bubble–bubble
interactions (coalescence, breakup), thus, the development of accurate CFD (Computational
Fluid Dynamics) models that describe bubbly ﬂows are important and challenging.
Two-ﬂuid models are widely used as CFD models for the prediction of bubbly ﬂows in bubble
columns due to its low computational cost.
In this thesis computational models are developed in order to improve the capabilities of two-
ﬂuid models in predicting bubbly ﬂows in bubble columns. .

CHAPTER 1.
BUBBLY FLOWS IN BUBBLE COLUMNS
1.1
Introduction
Bubble columns are widely used in Chemical and petrochemical industries as gas/liquid
contactors. A Chemical plant as shown in Fig 1.1 produce waste gases and these waste gases
often contain harmful contents like NH3, CO2 etc. According to EPA regulation these gases
are not allowed to be released in to the atmosphere directly, as a remedy these gases are passed
through a bubble column which contains a liquid solvent which absorbs these harmful contents
prior to the release in to the atmosphere.
The extensive usage of bubble columns as a gas/liquid contactor in the Chemical industry
is attributed to:
1. High interfacial area per unit volume for heat and mass transfer.
2. Low maintenance cost due to the absence of moving parts.
3. Less ﬂoor space occupied.
4. The capability of performing slow reactons which requires high liquid residence time.
Precise design and construction of bubble columns are important to obtain the desired yield
for gas-liquid contacting processes carried out in bubble columns.
The commmon design parameters for bubble columns:
1. Mass transfer coeﬃcient.
2. Heat transfer characterisitcs.
3. Bubble size distribution.
Design parameters signiﬁcantly depend on the ﬂow inside the column thus, understanding and
modeling the physics of bubbly ﬂows is essential to design these systems eﬃciently. In the most
basic design model ﬂow is assumed to behave ideally (e.g. plug ﬂow for gas phase, complete

backmixing for liquid), however in practical applications ﬂow is far from ideal and require CFD
models to describe it accurately. The main challenges associated with developing CFD models
for bubbly ﬂows:
1. Diﬀerent hydrodynamic ﬂow regimes based on inlet conditions and dimensions of the column.
2. Complexity of physics involved due to turbulence and size change (coalescence, breakup).
Diﬀerent hydrodynamic regimes present in bubble columns or bubbly ﬂows in pipes are
discussed in the next section.
1.2
Hydrodynamic ﬂow regimes
Bubbly ﬂows can be classiﬁed based on the topological distribution of the phases. A partic-
ular type of such topology distribution is called as ﬂow regime or ﬂow pattern. Investigation of
these ﬂow regimes and transition between these regimes are crucial for both design and safety
aspects of Industrial equipments, and mathematical modelling. For instance, if we consider
the slug ﬂow which is one of the commonly found multiphase ﬂow regime in many engineering

Figure 1.2
picture from McQuillan and Whalley (1985), commonly found ﬂow regimes
applications, particularly in the transport of hydrocarbon ﬂuids in pipelines in the oil and gas
industry. The slug ﬂow regime, in which large gas bubbles alternately with liquid slugs at
randomly ﬂuctuating frequency, is usually undesirable since the intermittent behaviour of slugs
causes severe stress conditions on pipelines. It is therefore important to be able to predict the
onset and subsequent development of slug ﬂow. Several such examples can be found in the
literature (Fabre and Line, 1992; Wu et al., 2001; Cheng et al., 1999).
There are a plethora of regimes found in the literature (Weisman et al., 1979; Barnea, 1987;
Costigan and Whalley, 1997; Woldesemayat and Ghajar, 2007; McGovern et al., 2008) for bub-
bly ﬂows, we are focusing mainly on bubbly ﬂows in bubble columns and vertical pipes. Three
types of ﬂow regimes are commonly observed in these systems, which are the homogeneous
(bubbly ﬂow) regime; the heterogeneous (Churn-turbulent) regime and the slug ﬂow regime
(Taitel et al., 1980; Kaichiro and Ishii, 1984; Hyndman et al., 1997; McQuillan and Whalley,
1985). There also exists the so-called foaming regime which is not so commonly encountered
in bubble columns.
Homogenous ﬂow (Bubble ﬂow):
The homogeneous bubbly ﬂow regime is found at low superﬁcial gas velocity, typically less
than 5 cm/s, as can be seen in the ﬂow regime maps found in (Hills, 1976; Fan et al., 1985).

4
This regime is characterized by a uniform bubble distribution along the cross section of the
column with uniform rise velocity. Bubbles are generally mono-dispersed due to the absence of
coalescence and breakup. A gentle liquid mixing is observed in the entire cross-sectional area
of the column (Hyndman et al., 1997), which depends on the gas velocity rather than the liquid
velocity (Ityokumbul et al., 1994). Since there is no coalescence or breakup, the bubble size is
entirely dependent on the sparger size and system properties (Thorat and Joshi, 2004). The
gas hold up varies linearly with superﬁcial gas velocity in this regime (Ityokumbul et al., 1994).
Slug ﬂow (Plug ﬂow):
Slug ﬂow is observed in bubble columns with high gas ﬂow rates (Hyndman et al., 1997) a nd
diameters less than a cutoﬀdiameter, where the cutoﬀdiameter depends on the thermodynamic
properties and the Rayleigh taylor instability wavelength of the system (Kolev (2011)), such a
relation for cutoﬀdiameter can be found in Taitel et al. (1980). This regime is characterized
by large bubbles which almost occupy the entire cross-sectional area of the column. Slugs are
generally found in bubble columns up to a diameter of 15 cm (Hills, 1976; Miller, 1980).
Heterogenous ﬂow (Churn ﬂow):
The churn-turbulent ﬂow regime is observed in bubble columns for gas velocity typically greater
than 5 cm/s (Deckwer et al., 1980). This regime is characterized by enhanced turbulent motion
of gas bubbles with signiﬁcant bubble coalescence and breakup, which results in wide bubble size
distribution (Schumpe and Deckwer, 1980). Cluster formation and wide bubble size distribution
were also found by Hyndman et al. (1997). Coalescence and breakup in this regime is controlled
by energy dissipation at the bulk (Thorat and Joshi, 2004), Jakobsen et l.
(1993), energy
dissipation in gas - liquid ﬂows are caused by two mechanisms wall friction and bubble associated
dissipation (Merchuk and Berzin, 1995), the area of the bubbles present in the bubble cloumn
reactor is usually one order of magnitude larger than the area of the walls, which makes it
the main source of energy dissipation in gas - liquid ﬂows. According to Luo and Svendsen
(1996), if the energy of the liquid eddy colliding the bubble is greater than the surface energy,
bubble breakup occurs. According to there theoretical model for the prediction of bubble size

5
distribution, the lower bubble sizes exist in the region of low energy dissipation and higher
bubble sizes exist in the region of high energy dissipation rate.
Because of coalescence, there is a reduction in eﬀective interphase surface area leading to
lower gas-liquid mass transfer rates compared to homogeneous bubbly ﬂows (Schumpe and
Deckwer, 1980), but the eﬀective interphase surface area calculation is done by the assumption
of two distinct bubble classes (S. and T., ; Schumpe and Deckwer, 1980). The churn-turbulent
regime cannot be avoided in industrial bubble columns, as majority of the bubble columns
operate with high superﬁcial gas velocities (Hyndman et al., 1997), as a result the churn regime
has to be studied carefully. Coalescence and bubble breakup have been studied numerically by
(Olmos et al., 2001; Hibiki and Ishii, 2000; Millies and Mewes, 1999; Wu et al., 2001).
Olmos et al. (2001) did a Euler-Euler simulation of gas - liquid ﬂows in a bubble column
by coupling the Euler - Euler model with population balance equation. They used the MUSIG
(multiple size group) approach in CFX. they also assume that the velocity of all the classes of
bubbles is same leading to only one momentum equation and multiple continuity equation for
the gas phase. They studied the homogenous and the transition regime by varying the inlet gas
velocity. They compared the bubble size distirbution, gas holdup and the axial liquid velocity
with there in house experiments. On comparison they found that as long as the homogenous
regime persists, hydrodynamic variables are in good agreement with the experiments, but in
the transition regime there is an overestimation of gas holdup. The size distributions in the
transition regime evolves till an equilibrium, which characterises the bubble properties in the
churn-turbulent regime. They also conﬁrm the predictions of Luo and Svendsen (1996), that
bubble size distribution depends on the Turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and also on the
bubble size.
Millies and Mewes (1999) developed a model for predicting the interphase surface area
density in a bubble column reactor. The model is derived from population balance equation,
taking in to account the bubble coalescence and breakup. An approximate analytical solution
is ﬁrst obtained, then using that analytical solution population balance equations are reduced
to one single partial diﬀerential equation. The results obtained from the model is compared
with the experimental data and the model gives good prediction of interphase surface area.

6
Hibiki and Ishii (2000) developed a two group interphase surface area transport equation
from the population balance equation, where the bubbles are divided in to two sub classes
namely spherical/distorted bubbles and cap/slug bubbles. Each class has its on number density
evolution equation and the corresponding interphase surface area transport equation is derived
from the number density equation. The bubble coalescence models due to random collision
and wake entrainment and the bubble breakage due to turbulence is thoroughly studied. They
found that two group interphase surface area transport equation predicts the interphase surface
area concentration with in the average relative deviation of 3 percent from the experiments,
for bubble to slug ﬂow transition.
1.2.1
Flow regime transition
1.2.1.1
Bubbly to churn regime
Thorat and Joshi (2004) found that the transition gas velocity depends on the sparger
design, the column dimensions and the physical properties of the system. There theory to
determine the transition criteria is based on linear stability analysis of two-ﬂuid model. The
authors concluded that transition hold up increased with decreasing aspect ratio and sparger
hole diameter. The transition criteria based on gas hold up can be found in Kolev (2011).
According to Kolev (2011) small bubbles with diameter less than 0.89λ, where λ is the Rayleigh
Taylor instability wavelength λ =
q
τ
g(ρl−ρg), acts like a solid sphere with no coalescence, in
which case the transition from bubbly to churn-turbulent ﬂow occurs at a volume fraction 0.54.
for large bubbles transiton can occur between 0.24 < α < 0.54, where the lower limit is not
certain.
Krishna et al. (1991) studied the eﬀect of gas density on the regime transition velocity and
concluded that regime transition velocity increased with increased gas density.
In order to determine the transition criteria, unfortunately there is no deﬁnite range of
superﬁcial gas velocities. Diﬀerent studies performed with diﬀerent operating conditions, sys-
tem properties and sparger design gives diﬀerent regime boundaries. For example, Hyndman
et al. (1997) found that below a superﬁcial gas velocity of 4 cm/s, a bubbly ﬂow regime exists,

7
Figure 1.3
picture from Deckwer et al. (1980), ﬂow regime map
pino et al. (1992) agrees with Hyndman et al. (1997), but according to Schumpe and Grund
(1986) bubble ﬂow regime can prevail up to 5 cm/s. Bukur and Daly (1987) observed the
churn-turbulent regime for gas velocities of 2 - 5 cm/s.
Several ﬂow regime charts are found in the literature (Shah et al., 1982; Fan et al., 1985;
Deckwer et al., 1980). Deckwer et al. (1980) reports one of these maps (Fig. 3), which shows
the dependence of the ﬂow regime on the column diameter and superﬁcial gas velocities. The
shaded region represents the transition between diﬀerent regimes.
1.2.1.2
Slug to churn regime
Churn ﬂow was considered to be a phenomenon taking place at the entrance region of the
column by Taitel et al. (1980). They consider the churn ﬂow as the part of the formation of
stable slug ﬂow. hey deduced an entrance length for the pipe as a function of the mixture
velocity and the pipe diameter, required to form stable slug ﬂow. The pipe length is below the
entrance length, churn ﬂow exists and if not stable slug ﬂow is formed at the end. McQuillan
and Whalley (1985), including Nicklin and Davidson (1962), Wallis (1969), Govan et al. (1991)
attribute the transition from slug to churn to the ﬂooding of liquid ﬁlm surrounding the bubble.
Several correlations exist to predict the ﬂooding velocity (Wallis (1969), Govier and Aziz (1972),

8
Figure 1.4
picture from Brauner and Barnea (1986), showing slug to churn transition
Bankoﬀand Lee (1986)) and if the gas velocity is more than the ﬂooding velocity slug to churn
transition occurs. Kaichiro and Ishii (1984) attributes the transition of slug to churn to the
wake eﬀect of Taylor bubbles (bubble slug with cylindrical tail and hemispherical head). The
transition occurs when the average gas hold up in the pipe exceeds the mean void fraction
over Taylor bubble region evaluated by them. According to Brauner and Barnea (1986), the
transition occurs at a volume fraction of the liquid slug greater than 0.52, because at that point
the chances of bubble collision is higher leading to coalescence of bubbles, which ultimately
destroys the liquid slug and lead to churn ﬂow.
1.2.1.3
Transition from bubbly ﬂow to slug ﬂow
Radovich and Moissis (1962) suggested the transition of bubble to slug happens due to
the coalescence of bubbles, when the bubble volume fraction reaches 0.25 - 0.3. Taitel et al.
(1980) conﬁrmed Radovich and Moissis ﬁndings, with the exception that the bubble ﬂow regime
persists if an equilibrium is maintained bubble coalescence and bubble breakup due to liquid
turbulence.
The current hydrodynamic CFD models present in the literature to model these ﬂow regimes
are discussed in the further section.

9
1.3
Hydrodynamic CFD models
In all multiphase models, the main diﬃculties are attributed to the interphases between the
phases and discontinuities associated with them (Ishii and Mishima (1984)). The formulation
of the constitutive equations is another diﬃculty which arises while developing a multiphase
model (Drew and Lahey (1979)).
Constitutive equations applied still include considerable
uncertainties which is discussed in the later sections.
Diﬀerent multiphase ﬂow models present in the literature for predicting bubbly ﬂows:
1.3.1
Mixture ﬂow model
Mixture ﬂow models are developed mainly for ﬂows with low stokes number << 1, where
the inﬂuence of the dispersed phase on the continuous phase is almost negligible (for e.g.
dusty ﬂows, small gas bubbles in liquid). In those cases ﬂow is modelled in terms of a single
momentum equation, and the volume fractions of each phase is determined the individual
continuity equations. The mixture ﬂow model is obtained by adding the ensemble averaged
momentum and continuity equations (Drew, 1982) for the continuous and the dispersed phase.
The following is a mixture model formulated in Ref.
Continuity
∂ρm
∂t + ∇· (ρmum) = 0
(1.1)
where ρm = Σn
1αiρi, um =
1
ρm Σn
1αiρiui
Momentum
∂
∂t (ρmum) + ∇· (ρmumum) = −∇pm + ∇· τm + ∇· τDm + ρmg + Fm
(1.2)
where ∇pm = Σn
1αi∇p, τm = Σn
1τi, Fm = Σn
1Fi
The term ∇· τDm is an unclosed term which arises during the formulation through substi-
tuting ui = um + uMi in the non linear convection term ∇· (αiρiuiui) (See Ref.) of the Favre
averaged equations. The unclosed term ∇· τDm appears in the mixture momentum equation
as a function of uMi, the diﬀusion velocity or the velocity of phase i relative to the centre of

10
the mixture mass, which has to closed to solve the mixutre momentum equation to predict
the ﬂow. A drift ﬂux model is commonly used in the literature (Zuber and Findlay (1965),
Ishii and Hibiki (2010), Fangzhi Chen et al. (2005) , Zhao et al. (2008)) to close the diﬀusion
velocity, it is based on representing the diﬀusion velocity uMi in terms of mixture velocity and
a drift velocity, later the drift velocity the drift velocity is computed from slip velocity as given:
uDi = uCl−Σn
1αkuCk, where uCk-slip velocity, the slip velocity is formulated in terms of bubble
relaxation time and mixture acceleration as given in Ref.. The advantage of the mixture ﬂow
model over Euler-Lagrange and Euler-Euler models is that the unclosed terms present in the
model are less and can be expressed in a simpler form due to its formulation from the Eulerian
averaged model by eliminating the interfacial forces (Johansen et al. (1990)). The mixture
model is numerically implemented in the codes PHOENICS, FLUENT, CFX. The applica-
tion of the mixture model in simulating bubbly ﬂows in bubble columns appears to be scarce
(Sanyal et al., 1990), most applications found in the literature are concentrated mainly on ﬂows
involving gravity settling and centrifugal forces (Franca and Lahey (1992), Wang and Cheng
(1996), Pericleous (1986), Pericleous and Patel (1987), Sakaguchi et al. (1987)). Hence it is
not so clear about the applicability of the model with respect to diﬀerent ﬂow regimes found
in bubbly ﬂow in a bubble column. The only limit of appilcability which can be deduced from
the literature is that it is applicable for dilute ﬂows with low stokes number.
1.3.2
Euler-Lagrange model
In Euler - Lagrange (EL) approach the dispersed phase (bubble phase) is treated with a
lagrangian approach by tracking the bubble with the following governing equations:
mb
dvb
dt = Fnet
(1.3)
dxb
dt = vb
(1.4)
Fnet = FD + FVM + FLift + FB
(1.5)

11
The models for inter-phase forces FD, FV M, FLift will be discussed elaborately in the next
section.
The continuous phase is solved on an Eulerian grid using the averaged equations
discussed in the next section.
The continuous and the dispersed phase in EL approach is
coupled to one another with the volume fraction of the continuous phase (αl) and the inter-
phase force Fnet. The αl in a computational cell is computed from the volume of the bubbles
occupying the cell as follows:
αl = 1 −ΣiVbi
Vcell
(1.6)
The velocity of the continuous phase required to compute the inter-phase force on the
particle is obtained on the particle location by interpolating the ﬂow-ﬁeld data obtained from
the continuous phase solver. Then the new inter-phase force obtained from the discrete solver
is converted into volume inter-phase forces (Ref.) and fed back to continuous phase solver
to compute the new continous ﬂow ﬁeld. The works (Sokolichin, Lapin, Delnoij) related to
simulating bubbly ﬂows in a bubble column using EL approach is rare and explores only the
dilute limit (αg ¡ 10 per) in the homogeneous regime, indicating that the method is not suitable
for systems or processes involving large number of bubbles (>100000) or in the high void
fraction limit (>10 per) (Heterogenous regime occurs). In the case of large number of bubbles
the computational cost and the memory requirement involved to simulate the bubbly ﬂows
with EL approach is very high, thus EE approach with less computational cost discussed in
the next section is adopted in such concentrated limits. Moreover, Sokolichin and Eigenberger
(1990) compared the solutions obtained from the simlulations performed using both EL and
EE approach on a rectangular bubble column operating in the dilute limit with global void
fraction (<10 per). They concluded that the velocity and void fraction proﬁles predicted by
EE approach with TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) schemes are the same as predicted by
the EL approach, which indicates that the bubbly ﬂow simulations performed on a bubble
column by EE approach with higher order non-diﬀusive schemes are comparable to the EL
approach also in the dilute limit. Thus, proving EE approach as an eﬀective technique to study
bubbly ﬂows in a bubble column for wide range of regimes.

12
1.3.3
Two-ﬂuid model
The two-ﬂuid model equations which govern the momentum, mass and heat transfer of
two-phase ﬂows are solved on a ﬁxed grid for both the phases. This type of approach elimi-
nates the computational memory requirement associated with the tracking of dispersed phase
as encountered in EL approach discussed in the previous section. The governing equations in
the two-ﬂuid model are obtained by averaging the microscopic equations or the Navier Stokes
equation which is valid for both the phases. The averaging of the microscopic equation results
in unclosed terms in the two-ﬂuid model equations which needs to be modeled rigorously for
accurate prediction of the ﬂow, in other words ﬂow prediction is sensitive to the accuracy of the
models. However, the main advantage of such an approach is that the solution for Industrial
scale problems can be obtained with relatively lesser computational cost than the microscopic
equation, hence it is used in numerous works to simulate bubbly ﬂows (the details of the works
will be discussed elaborately in subsec. 1.3.3.1) for wide range of bubbly ﬂow regimes (Ho-
mogeneous to Heterogeneous) discussed in subsec. 1.2. and numerous eﬀorts are made in the
development of sub-models for the unclosed terms (discussed in 1.3.3.2) present in two-ﬂuid
model.
1.3.3.1
Formulation:
Ensemble averaging is applied on the microscopic equations 1.7 and 1.8 to obtain the two-
ﬂuid model (Drew, 1983) for two-phase incompressible ﬂows.
Mass:
∂ρi
∂t + ∇· ρiui = 0
(1.7)
Momentum:
∂
∂t (ρiui) + ∇· (ρiuiui) = −∇pi + ∇· τ i + Fi
(1.8)
Where i=1, 2 corresponds to liquid and gas phase respectively.

13
Ensemble averaging of ﬂow variables (velocity, pressure etc.) are performed by repeating
measurements of the variables at a ﬁxed time and location for a large number of ensembles
(ﬂow conﬁgurations) with identical boundary conditions, and ﬁnding an average value of the
measurements.
Mathematically ensemble average can be represented for any ﬂow variable f as
⟨f⟩(r, t) = ΣN
ω=1f (r, t; ω)
(1.9)
where ω is a running variable over the ensembles and N is the total number of ensembles.
Since the ensemble averaging operator ⟨⟩is independent of space and time we can perform the
following operation while formulating the two-ﬂuid model
⟨∂
∂tf⟩= ∂
∂t⟨f⟩
(1.10)
⟨∇f⟩= ∇⟨f⟩
(1.11)
The partial average of f in phase i can be deﬁned as:
⟨Xif⟩
(1.12)
Where Xi is the phase indicator function deﬁned as 1 for the gas phase and 0 for the liquid
phase.
Phase indicator function evolution equation (Drew, 1983a):
∂
∂tXi + uI · ∇Xi = 0
(1.13)
It can also be shown that the following conditions are valid (Manninen and Taivassalo
(2009)).
⟨Xi∇f⟩= ∇⟨Xif⟩−⟨f∇Xi⟩
(1.14)
⟨Xi∇· f⟩= ∇· ⟨Xif⟩−⟨f · ∇Xi⟩
(1.15)
⟨Xi
∂
∂tf⟩= ∂
∂t⟨Xif⟩−⟨f ∂
∂tXi⟩
(1.16)

14
By multiplying equations 1.7 and 1.8 with Xi, subtracting 1.13 and ensemble averaging with
the conditions (1.10, 1.11, 1.14, 1.15 and 1.16) we get:
Mass:
∂
∂t⟨Xiρ⟩+ ∇· ⟨Xiρu⟩= ⟨ρ (u −uI) · ∇Xi⟩
(1.17)
Momentum:
∂
∂t⟨Xiρu⟩+ ∇· ⟨Xiρuu⟩= ∇· ⟨Xiτ⟩+ ⟨XiF⟩+ ⟨(ρu (u −uI) −τ) · ∇Xi⟩
(1.18)
An intrinsic average and Favre average for any variable f can be deﬁned as:
⟨fi⟩p = ⟨Xif⟩
⟨Xi⟩= ⟨Xif⟩
αi
(1.19)
where ⟨Xi⟩= αi
In order to approach a closed set of equation the velocity is decomposed into its Favre
averaged value and its ﬂuctuation.
ui = ⟨ui⟩f + ui
′′
(1.20)
By using the above decomposition the convection term becomes
⟨Xiρuu⟩= αiρi⟨u
′′
i ⟩f⟨u
′′
i ⟩f + αi⟨ρiu
′′
i u
′′
i ⟩
(1.21)
The term ⟨ρiu
′′
i u
′′
i ⟩is called as the turbulent stress because it involves ﬂuctuations. However,
according to Fox (2012), it is incorrect to name the term as turbulent stress tensor, because the
velocity ﬂuctuations can arise from sources other than turbulence such as bubble movement.
We can get the ﬁnal set of mass and momentum equation for each phase as
Mass:
∂
∂tαi⟨ρi⟩p + ∇· αi⟨ρi⟩p⟨ui⟩f = Γi
(1.22)
Momentum:
∂
∂t (αi⟨ρ⟩p⟨u⟩f) + ∇· (αi⟨ρ⟩p⟨u⟩f⟨u⟩f) = ∇·

αi⟨τ⟩f + ⟨Xiρu
′′
i u
′′
i ⟩

+ αi⟨F⟩f + Mi
(1.23)

15
Where,
Γi = ⟨ρ (u −uI) · ∇Xi⟩
Mi = ⟨(ρu (u −uI) −τ) · ∇Xi⟩
The inter-phase force term Mi has to be modeled to get a closed set of equation 1.23, which
can be solved to obtain the two-phase ﬂow ﬁeld. On inspection of the term Mi, it can be inferred
that this term is generated due to the stress distribution and mass transfer at the interface
the bubbles. It is modelled by decomposing it into diﬀerent components namely Drag, lift and
virtual mass force under the assumption of no phase change or mass transfer at the interface.
Some of the models available for these forces will be discussed in the next section.
1.3.3.2
Inter-phase force models
The accuracy of two-phase ﬂow prediction using two-ﬂuid model largely depends on the
inter-phase force modeling.
Inter-phase interaction term (Mi) with no mass transfer is de-
composed into the drag, virtual mass, lift, wall lubrication and force due to hydrodynamic
interaction between bubbles.
M1 = MD + MVM + MLF + MWL + MHF
(1.24)
and also it assumed that
M1 = −M2
(1.25)
It is also well known that the inviscid two-ﬂuid model equations are ill-posed (discussed
in Chapter 2), hence the well-posed ness of the equations also depends on the modeling and
choice of inter-phase force models.
The following are the common set of force models used in the literature for accurate predic-
tion and to achieve well posedness of the two-ﬂuid model for bubbly ﬂows (it should be noted
that all the sub-models discussed in the section accounts for the unresolved stress distribution
at the interface of the bubbles).

16
Drag force (MD):
The models for the drag force present in the literature falls mainly under two categories:
low gas fraction limit and high gas fraction limit. In the low gas fraction limit the interaction
between bubbles is negligible, both due to bubble-bubble collisions and the interaction through
the ﬂuid ﬂow modiﬁcation due to the neighbouring bubbles. In this case, the bubbles can be
treated as single bubble moving in the ﬂuid and drag correlations for single bubbles can be
used. The drag force on a single bubble can be expressed as:
FD = 0.5ρgCDAp|ug −ul| (ug −ul)
(1.26)
where Ap is the projected area of the sphere on a plane normal to the ﬂow andCD is the
drag coeﬃcient. For an Euler-Euler approach the equation 1.24 can be reformulated in terms
of gas volume fraction as given by Drew (1983a) as:
FD = 3
4
αg
ds
 ds
dD

ρgCDAp|ug −ul| (ug −ul)
(1.27)
where ds is the sauter mean bubble diameter.
The Drag coeﬃcent CD is obtained mainly as a function of bubble Reynolds number (Re)
and Eotvos number (Eo). The drag coeﬃcient reported in Levich et al. (1962) is only a function
of Reynolds number.
CD = 48
Re
(1.28)
The expression is derived analytically by considering the ﬂow ﬁeld around a single bubble with
the assumption of spherical bubbles, hence it is valid for small bubbles of diameter ∼1 mm
which does not loose its sphericity. For bubbles with shapes diﬀerent from sphere (typically
bubble sizes > 1 mm) form drag becomes signiﬁcant and the drag coeﬃcient is expressed in
terms of Eo as given in Johansen and Boysan (1988).
CD =
0.622
1
Eo + 0.235
(1.29)
where Eo =
g∆ρd2
p
σ
and σ is the surface tension. Tomiyama et al. (2002a) performed experiments
on single bubble rise and deduced a drag coeﬃcient CD which switches between Re dependence

17
and Eo dependence based on bubble size as shown:
CD = max
 48
Re,


(1.30)
When the gas fraction of the gas increases, bubble coalescence and breakup increases,
resulting in the modiﬁcation of the ﬂow ﬁeld in the vicinity of the bubble which aﬀects the
neighboring bubble caught in the ﬂow ﬁeld. In such cases drag formulation based on single
bubble independent of other bubbles, may not be an appropriate choice, one has to account for
the inﬂuence of the neighbouring bubbles. Ishii and Zuber (1979) developed a correlation for
drag coeﬃcient in the churn turbulent regime as a function of gas holdup, however, according
to Jakobsen (1993) who implemented Ishii and Zuber’s correlation, the physical eﬀect of the
correlation was to decrease the relative velocity with decreasing gas fraction, which is against
the experimental evidence by (Yao et al., 1991; Grienberger and Hofmann, 1992) that the bubble
velocity increases while moving in a group of bubbles. Garnier et al. (2002) developed a drag
correlation for bubble swarms, which seems to behave qualitatively well with the experimental
ﬁndings, however the correlation holds good only for bubble diameter less than 5.5 mm. The
eﬀects of the presence of other dispersed phase is implemented in Behzadi et al. (2001) as
Cd = Cdof (α2)
(1.31)
where the function f (α2) that takes into account the eﬀects arising from other dispersed
phase elements is deﬁned as:
f (α2) = exp(K1α2) + αK2
2
(1.32)
Such functions are obtained from experiments through curve ﬁtting (see for e.g. Rusche and
Issa (2000)).
Despite the above works on drag coeﬃcient for high gas fraction regime, most works asso-
ciated with bubbly ﬂow simulation using two-ﬂuid model discussed in section 1.3.3.3 employs
drag coeﬃcients based on single bubbles. This may be due to the lack of rigorous testing and
validation of drag coeﬃcient models for high gas fraction limit.
Virtual mass force (MVM):
Drag force accounts for the interaction of bubble and liquid in a non-accelerating ﬂow.
However, if the bubble is accelerated part of the surrounding liquid also gets accelerated leading

18
to an additional force called added mass or virtual mass force. In bubble columns as the bubble
rises from the inlet it undergoes acceleration, hence the virtual mass force is inevitable in the
simulation of bubbly ﬂows in bubble columns. Moreover, to improve the well-posedness of the
two-ﬂuid model discussed in chapter 2, virtual mass force is often employed in multi-phase ﬂow
calculations.
Many formulations for virtual mass force can be found in the literature (Drew, 1987), the
most commonly used formulation in multi-phase ﬂow calculations, even in commercial packages
(FLUENT, OpenFOAM) is given by
Fvm = αgρlCvm
∂ul
∂t + ul · ∇ul −∂ug
∂t −ug · ∇ug

(1.33)
where, Cvm is the virtual mass coeﬃcient
The virtual mass coeﬃcient is obtained as 0.5 from the potential ﬂow solution around a
rigid spherical particle (Drew et al., 1979). Cook and Harlow (1986) used a value of 0.25 for
bubbles in water, while Homsy et al. (1980) deduce a coeﬃcient which is a function of gas
fraction as given in Eqn. 1.34 using cell model.

The usage of complex functionality for virtual mass coeﬃcient is not widely found, most
works adopt a constant virtual mass coeﬃcient of 0.5. This again may be due to the lack of
rigorous testing and validation of such functions for bubbly ﬂow simulations.
Lift force (MLF):
When a bubble rises in a shear ﬁeld (lateral velocity gradient) of the liquid it experiences a
lateral force called lift force. This lateral force decides whether the bubble gas fraction peaks
close to the wall or close to the centre of the column.
Svendsen et al. (1992) have done a good review of the lift force as below:
The lateral movement of bubbles in a bubble column is a combined eﬀect of many forces. Fac-
tors that inﬂuence the radial movement are Bubble rotation around its own axes in a ﬂow ﬁeld
(Magnus lift force), relative gas-liquid velocity and a liquid velocity gradient, viscous shear,
radial pressure gradients, bubble shape changes, turbulent dispersion and phsicochemical prop-

19
erties like coalescence tendency. The magnus force was ﬁrst described for the moderate to
high Reynolds number (Re) region as discussed by Swanson (1961) as an asymmetric pressure
distribution around a body created by the interaction between the ﬂow ﬁeld and the body
rotation. Thomas et al. (1983) has used the theory for Re numbers around 1000, which is a
region relevant for bubble columns, concluding that the force acts towards the high speed side
if the bubble moves against the ﬂow or moves with the ﬂow but more slowly than the ﬂow.
It is toward the low speed side if the bubble moves with the ﬂow and faster than the ﬂow.
This is conﬁrmed for upward bubble ﬂow by Beyerlein et al. (1985) for low gas fractions (<5
percent). However, negative lift forces have also been observed. An experimental investigation
by Taneda (1957) on the Magnus force showed that in certain ranges of Re and rotational
speed, rotating spheres in a uniform ﬂow ﬁeld suﬀer lifts having a direction opposite to those of
the ordinary Magnus force. This has been conﬁrmed by Hoglund (1962) and Swanson (1961).
It was concluded that this eﬀect can be explained by a transition of the boundary layer from
laminar to turbulent ﬂow. Both the direction and magnitude of the force depend on the local
ﬂow conditions such that using mean values of force coeﬃcients is in reality misleading. Unfor-
tunately, the previous research work is concentrated in two ranges of Re. Workers concerned
with suspension rheology and allied topics have concentrated on motion at very low Re (for
e.g. Saﬀman, 1965, 1968; Rubinow and Keller, 1961) while very high Re-number motion have
concerned aerodynamicists and allied physicist (e.g. Hoglund, 1962 and Swanson, 1961). The
gap between these two ranges is wide and experimentally uncharted. the general problem is
clearly very involved, so rather ideal situations are the only ones which have been examined in
any detail.

lateral velocity gradient, slip velocity and a lift coeﬃcient CL:
FL = CLαgαlρl (ug −ul) ∂ul
∂r
(1.35)
The value of K was calculated to be 0.5 for potential ﬂow. The vlaue of the force also
depends on the bubble size, shape and turbulence. An expression which accounts for all the

20
factors is modelled by Jakobsen et al. (1993)

where µL and µt are molecular and eddy viscosities respectively. In the literature, equation
with out the correction is used and CL is tuned to match the observed hold up proﬁle. The
classical model 1.35 for the lift force predicts the force to be radially outwards in a heterogenous
regime, on the contrary the force is radially inwards, hence they (Torvik and Svendsen, 1990;
Svendsen et al., 1992; Grienberger and Hofmann, 1992; Hillmer et al., 1994) have to use negative
lift coeﬃcient to simulate there ﬂow. Which questions the universality of the expression 1.35.
The study of the eﬀect of the presence of other bubbles on lift coeﬃcient is rare. A study
performed by Beyerlein et al. (1985) shows that lift coeﬃcient has to be modelled by accounting
for the presence of other dispersed phases to obtain a good prediction of holdup proﬁle. They
modelled it as:
CL = 1.65X10−1α−0.78

(1.37)
where α2i is the mean inlet volume fraction of the gas. The correlation suggested by Beyerlein
et al. (1985) donot depend on the local volume fraction hence, a new correlation is developed
by Behzadi et al. (2001) based on the local volume fraction of the gas and is given as:
CL = 6.51X10−4α−1.2

(1.38)
Wall lubrication force (MWL):
When a bubble comes in close proximity to a wall a liquid ﬁlm is trapped between the bubble
and the wall, which results in pressure build up close to the wall. This high pressure drives the
bubble away from the wall resulting in almost zero void fraction close to the wall. According
to Antal et al. (1991b) there is no analytical three dimensional solution of the ﬂow between a

21
bubble and a wall to describe this phenomena, hence they propose the following model from
the two dimensional solution for ﬂow between a cylinder and a wall.
FWL = −CWLα2ρ1|u∗
r|2n
(1.39)
where CWL is a function of distance from the wall yw as given in Eqn. 1.41. The force rapidly
decreases as the distance from the wall increases. The vector n is the outward-facing unit
normal at the nearest point on the wall. u∗
r is the relative velocity parallel to the wall, that is
u∗
r = ur −(ur · n) n
(1.40)
CWL is expressed as:
CWL (yw) = max{CW1

+ CW2

, 0}
(1.41)
The coeﬃcients CW1 and CW2 are chosen so that CW1 is negative and the force vanishes for
yw/d > −CW2/CW1 which is usually a few bubble diameters away from the wall.
Hydrodynamic interaction force (MHF):
Hydrodynamic interaction force accounts for the hydrodynamic interaction between bubbles or
the drag induced by one bubble over the other through the liquid. Our preliminary simula-
tions (without the addition of this force) showed unphysical probability distribution of volume
fraction (dotted line) of gas at high gas fraction limit (discussed in chapter 2). The addition
of this force corrected the unphysical probability distribution of αg by controlling the degree
of segregation of gas.

22
Also this force is known to stabilize (Lucas et al., 2005) the bubbly ﬂow by smoothing
out the non-uniformity in the gas fraction proﬁle. Bubble columns are known to stay stable
qualitatively up to a global void fraction of 0.25 - 0.3 (Harteveld, 2005b), hence the addition
of this force also contributes towards achieving that goal.
1.3.3.3
Application of two-ﬂuid model for bubbly ﬂow simulation
Lai and Salcudean (1987) performed simulation of bubbles rising in a stagnant liquid using
two-ﬂuid model. They simpliﬁed the two-ﬂuid model by assuming that the gas phase momen-
tum and viscous forces are negligible. They use the standard (std) single phase extension of
the k - ϵ model to capture the eﬀects of turbulence in the liquid phase. The calculated liquid
velocity proﬁle showed good agreement with the experimental data. However, they have not
compared the gas fraction proﬁle with the experiment in their study.
Schwarz and Turner (1988) used the two-ﬂuid model coupled with the std k - ϵ model to sim-
ulate a gas stirred bath. They found that a k - ϵ model with the standard constants for single
phase ﬂows works well, if a suﬃciently accurate two-ﬂuid model (like for e.g. separate mo-
mentum equation has to be solved for each phase and no assumptions should be made about
the hold up) is used. The compared Liquid velocities and turbulent kinetic energy with the
experimental data showed good agreement, but there is no comparison of void fraction reported
in the work. In comparison to Lai and Salcudean (1987) and Schwarz and Turner (1988) works
where drag was the only inter-phase force considered, Torvik and Svendsen (1990), Jakobsen
et al. (1993) and Grevscott et al. (1996) have used two-ﬂuid model with inter-phase forces lift
and virtual mass force along with drag to simulate the bubble column operating in homogenous
and transition regime. The turbulence in the ﬂow was captured by the extended k - ϵ model
similar to the works (Lai and Salcudean, 1987; Schwarz and Turner, 1988). Also, Jakobsen
et al., (1993) and Grevscott et al., (1996) used a correlation for predicting the bubble size
distribution and coupled it with the drag force appearing in the Euler-Euler model, based on
the assumption that bubble size is proportional to the turbulent eddy size.

(1.46)
where Csm is an empirical parameter obtained from the experiments. They observed a good
prediction of liquid velocity, volume fraction and turbulence with the experiments.
Celik and Wang (1994) used two-ﬂuid model to study the circulation in a bubble column
with only drag force as the interphase force. There main objective was to study the impact
of prescribed and predicted gas fraction on the ﬂow. They concluded that the predicted gas
fraction proﬁle gives much better results than the prescribed gas fraction proﬁle.
Ranade (1997) developed a computational model for predicting ﬂows in bubble columns
within two-ﬂuid model framework by adding two source terms in the momentum equation
along with drag and lift. The ﬁrst source term accounts for the correlation generated due to
drag on time averaging and the other source term accounts for the contribution of liquid wakes
on the slip velocity. The source term added was a function of radial volume fraction gradien,
radial velocity gradient and the turbulent diﬀusivity.
S = Kρlνt
∂αg
∂r
∂Vgz

(1.47)
They used a std single phase k - ϵ model without any additional source terms accounting for
the production of turbulent kinetic energy due to bubbles, under the assumption, that the
turbulent kinetic energy produced due to the bubbles is balanced by the dissipation at the
bubble surface (Kataoka and Serizawa, 1989).
Their model showed good agreement in the
prediction of velocity and holdup with experiments for both homogenous and heterogenous
regime.
Sokolichin and Eigenberger (1994a) modelled gas-liquid ﬂow in bubble columns with two-
ﬂuid model. They found out that no steady state solution for uniformly aerated bubble columns
can be obtained above a certain gas velocity for very ﬁne grid. If one attempts to reﬁne the
grid above 20x20 grid points the numerical code diverges since the steady state equations are
not able to describe the dynamic local phenomena. This seems to be the reason why in all
(Torvik and Svendsen, 1990; Grienberger and Hofmann, 1992; Svendsen et al., 1992; Jakobsen

24
et al., 1993; Hillmer et al., 1994) works the space grid did not exceed more than 20 x 20 grid
points.
From the literature, it is evident that Euler-Euler approach predicts the averaged liquid
velocity proﬁle in the bubble column reasonably well. However, the holdup was not accurately
predicted according to the experiment. Though the models proposed by (Ranade, 1997; Torvik
and Svendsen, 1990; Jakobsen et al., 1993) improved the holdup prediction, it is tested only
for low gas fraction and low inlet gas velocity. The improvement in these models were achieved
due to the improved modelling of turbulence and the inclusion of the algebraic model for the
bubble size dependence. At high gas fraction and inlet gas velocity, the turbulence and the
variation of bubble size is predominant. Hence it is important to provide improved models (not
just the std k-ϵ model for single phase ﬂow) accounting for turbulence and bubble size change
to accurately model the complex multi-phase ﬂow for better prediction of parameters like gas
holdup.
1.4
Turbulence in bubbly ﬂows and modeling
Bubbly ﬂows encountered in industrial systems often operate in turbulent conditions due
to the high gas fractions involved. Turbulence in these ﬂows control the phase distribution in
these systems (Chahed et al., 2003b) thereby inﬂuencing the heat and mass transfer properties.
Hence, an accurate prediction of turbulence is important to properly quantify the heat and
mass transfer in these systems.
Multi-ﬂuid models such as Euler-Lagrange (Delnoij et al., 1997a) and Euler-Euler (Drew,
1983a) discussed in the previous sections can be used to predict turbulent ﬂows in these systems,
however these models are restricted to small scale systems (e.g. laboratory bubble column).
The computational eﬀort involved in predicting such ﬂows in the large scale systems (e.g.
industrial bubble column) using these models is very high due to the presence of wide range of
turbulent scales. To reduce the computational load one has to capture the large scale turbulent
motion through multi-ﬂuid models and add the eﬀects of small scales through sub-grid scale
models.

25
The sub-grid scale turbulence modeling associated with bubbly ﬂows is a challenging task
due to the additional mode of turbulence production due to the bubbles, which introduces ad-
ditional scales along with the existing scales of turbulence due to the shear induced turbulence
(SIT). This bubble induced turbulence (BIT) or turbulence due to the bubbles is generated
due to the interphase forces at the mesoscale (l ∼dp) and the turbulence in the wakes, formed
due to the boundary layer separation on the bubbles at the microscale (l << dp). The pro-
duction of turbulence at the microscale due to the wake formation is of the order of Re−1/2
p
(Biesheuvel and Wijngaarden, 1984), where Rep is the bubble Reynolds number dpvrρ
µ
. The mi-
croscale turbulence could be neglected for bubbly ﬂows with moderate bubble Reynolds number
(200 < Rep < 500) encountered in engineering applications. However, the turbulence induced
due to the bubbles at the mesoscale level due to the interphase coupling could be signiﬁcant
and has to be modelled appropriately.
The signiﬁcance of BIT is pointed out by several authors (Lance and Bataille, 1991; Liu and
Bankoﬀ, 1993a; Shawkat and Ching, 2011) in modifying the liquid turbulence characteristics by
altering the mechanisms of production, redistribution and dissipation of turbulence. Further-
more, the recent review of Balachandar and Eaton (2010) on turbulent disperse ﬂow indicate
the modiﬁcation of phase distribution due to the turbulence instabilities caused due to the
presence of bubbles.
Hence, while developing turbulence models for bubbly ﬂows, the incorporation of eﬀects
due to SIT, BIT and its interactions is essential for accurate prediction of turbulent bubbly
ﬂows. A literature review is performed in the next section on the current state of turbulence
models available in the literature to predict SIT and BIT in bubbly ﬂows, by keeping in mind
the importance of interactions between BIT and SIT.
Many investigators who have studied the turbulent bubbly ﬂows in the literature have
neglected BIT (Torvik and Svendsen, 1990; Grienberger and Hofmann, 1992; Ranade, 1992;
Hillmer et al., 1994) and modelled only the SIT using single phase turbulence models. The
investigators (Svendsen et al., 1992; Thakre et al., 1999) who have added the BIT on an ex-
tended framework of single phase turbulence model and derived a multiphase turbulence model
(Kataoka and Serizawa, 1989; Ranade, 1997; Lahey, 1990a; Chahed et al., 2003a) by Reynolds

26
averaging (Pope, 2000) the instantaneous multiphase ﬂow equations have not rigorously ac-
counted for the BIT production due to each interphase force (Drew, 1983a). A good account
of these models present in the literature for predicting turbulence in bubbly ﬂows are given in
chapter 4.

HYPERBOLICITY OF TWO-FLUID MODEL

2.1
Abstract
The hyperbolicity condition of the system of partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) of the
incompressible two-ﬂuid model, applied to gas–liquid ﬂows, is investigated. It is shown that
the addition of a dispersion term, which depends on the drag coeﬃcient and the gradient of
the gas volume fraction, is required to ensure the hyperbolicity of the PDEs, and to prevent
the nonphysical onset of instabilities in the predicted multiphase ﬂows upon grid reﬁnement.
A constraint to be satisﬁed by the coeﬃcient of the dispersion term to ensure hyperbolicity is
obtained. The eﬀect of the dispersion term on the numerical solution and on its grid convergence
is then illustrated with numerical experiments in a one-dimensional shock tube, in a column
with a falling ﬂuid, and in a two-dimensional bubble column.
2.2
Introduction
The two-ﬂuid model (Drew, 1971, 1983b,a; Jackson, 1997) probably represents the most
widely adopted approach to describe the spatial and temporal evolution of gas–liquid ﬂows
in systems of practical relevance, due to its moderate computational cost. For this reason,
the correct formulation of the model has been subject of several studies, which aimed, on one
hand, to ensure the desired mathematical property of hyperbolicity of the model equations,
and, on the other hand, to appropriately incorporate the description of physical phenomena
experimentally observed in bubbly ﬂows. In particular, the numerical stability of the solution

28
obtained from the two-ﬂuid model depends on the characteristics of the underlying equations,
which, as shown in Stuhmiller (1977); Lyczkowski et al. (1978); Stewart (1979), may be com-
plex. In such a case, the discretized equations do not allow a grid-converged solution to be
achieved, and unstable modes in the solution appear, severely aﬀecting the model prediction
and its sensitivity to grid reﬁnement. Several approaches were suggested in the literature to
address this problem. Stuhmiller (1977) observed that the addition of a certain amount of
dissipation mitigates the problem for a speciﬁc grid resolution. Ramshaw and Trapp (1978)
proposed to address the problem of complex characteristics with the introduction of surface
tension eﬀects. Stewart (1979) provided a criterion for the grid resolution that ensures the
well-posedness of two-ﬂuid problem, relating the minimum grid size to a multiple of the bubble
radius. Sursock (1982) demonstrated that real characteristics of the two-ﬂuid equations are a
necessary condition in order not to violate the causality requirement. In particular, his work
shows that, when the two-ﬂuid equations have complex characteristics, it is necessary to know
all the values at the solution at future times t > ti, in order to determine an accurate solution
at an arbitrary time ti. Such a result clearly violates the physical constraint of causality, and
highlights the importance of ensuring that the mathematical model is hyperbolic. Based on
these observations, several researchers proposed modiﬁed version of the two-ﬂuid model that
guarantee hyperbolicity under certain conditions. Fitt (1989); Tiselj and Petelin (1997); Dinh
et al. (2003) performed numerical regularization of the ill-posed equation, which, however,
comes at the expense of accuracy, since it relies on the addition of numerical dissipation.
Several investigators (Stuhmiller, 1977; Bestion, 1990; Ramshaw and Trapp, 1978; Banerjee
and Chan, 1980; Ransom and Hicks, 1984; Saurel and Abgrall, 1999; Lee et al., 1998; Chung
et al., 2001) ensured the hyperbolicity of the two-ﬂuid model by introducing an pressure term
in the phase momentum equation. Stuhmiller (1977) assumed the same mean bulk pressure
Pk in both the phases and added an interface pressure term (pki −Pk) ∇α, where pki is the
interface pressure for phase k, in order to make the two-ﬂuid model hyperbolic. He considered
the interface pressures pki for both the phases to be equal, and modeled them based on the
analytical solution of pressure distribution around an isolated sphere (Lamb, 1932). Bestion
(1990) used an interface pressure term pi∇α, where, diﬀerently from Stuhmiller (1977), pi is

29
a coeﬃcient determined to ensure the hyperbolicity of the set of equations, without physical
justiﬁcation. Tiselj and Petelin (1997) pointed out that the addition of this term is controversial,
as shown by Sha and Soo (1979).
Ramshaw and Trapp (1978) ensured that the two-ﬂuid model has real characteristics by
assuming the mean bulk pressures in both the phases to be diﬀerent. These pressures were
related through the Laplace constraint, in which, the surface tension coeﬃcient is found mathe-
matically through linear stability analysis. In the works of Banerjee and Chan (1980); Ransom
and Hicks (1984); Saurel and Abgrall (1999); Lee et al. (1998); Chung et al. (2001) the two-ﬂuid
model is made hyperbolic using a two-pressure formulation for compressible two-phase ﬂows,
where pressures in each phases are computed using an equation of state. However, these au-
thors follow diﬀerent approaches to model the interface pressure term (pki −Pk) ∇α. Banerjee
and Chan (1980); Ransom and Hicks (1984) assumed the interface pressures pki to be equal.
Their model is valid only for stratiﬁed ﬂows, and it requires an additional transport equation
for the volume fraction in terms of the interface velocity to close the set of equations. Saurel
and Abgrall (1999) considered equal interface pressures, and calculated them as a function of
the mixture pressure. The works of Chung et al. (2001); Lee et al. (1998) modeled the inter-
face pressure coeﬃcient (pki −Pk) in both the phases in terms of the surface tension and bulk
modulus.
Hancox et al. (1980); Cheng et al. (1985) performed an analysis of wave propagation in
bubbly ﬂows, and found a signiﬁcant eﬀect of the virtual mass term on the dispersion of waves
in these ﬂows.
Thorley and Wiggert (1985); Chung et al. (2001) conﬁrmed that the two-
ﬂuid model with virtual mass term admits complex characteristics. In order to ensure the
hyperbolicity of the model equations, they proposed the introduction of an interfacial pressure
jump term, directly proportional to the surface tension between the phases.
The resulting
model with virtual mass and interfacial pressure jump resulted to be hyperbolic, but the wave
dispersion may become excessive, depending on the value of the coeﬃcient used in the virtual
mass model. A detailed study of the pressure forces in disperse two-phase ﬂows can be found in
Prosperetti and Jones (1984). Jones and Prosperetti (1985) studied the stability of a two-ﬂuid
model containing only ﬁrst-order diﬀerential terms and algebraic closures, showing that the

30
stability properties of the model do not depend on the wavelength of the perturbation, which is
unphysical. Their study was extended in Prosperetti and Jones (1984) to incorporate the eﬀect
of terms with derivatives of arbitrary order. However, the authors of this study concluded that
the introduction of these terms is ineﬀective at improving the long-wavelength stability of the
hyperbolic two-ﬂuid model containing only ﬁrst-order diﬀerential terms.
Biesheuvel and Gorissen (1990) analyzed the stability of a uniform suspension of bubbles,
identifying a critical value of volume fraction below which the suspension is stable. This result
is conﬁrmed experimentally by the work of Harteveld (2005a), who performed experiments
in of air injection in bubble columns. The standard two-ﬂuid model, however, predicts ﬂow
instabilities also in these conditions.
Davidson (1990) modeled the interfacial momentum transfer term in the two-ﬂuid model
including a dispersion term proportional to the drag coeﬃcient and to the gradient of the gas
volume fraction, and an interfacial pressure jump based on the work of Pauchon and Banerjee
(1986); Stuhmiller (1977).
Davidson deﬁned the dispersion coeﬃcient as a function of the
turbulent eddy viscosity. Tiselj and Petelin (1997) enforced the hyperbolicity of the two-ﬂuid
equations by modifying the virtual mass coeﬃcient as a function of the volume fraction and of
the density ratio of the phases, obtained assuming the multiphase mixture is incompressible.
Song and Ishii (2001) studied the hyperbolicity, and the consequent stability of the two-ﬂuid
model in terms of the momentum ﬂux parameters they introduced in the model to incorporate
the eﬀect of void fraction and phase velocities. The hyperbolicity condition was then determined
to identify when the model equation are stable, in a mathematical sense, for speciﬁc ﬂow
conditions.
Syamlal (2011) investigated the hyperbolicity of the two-ﬂuid model for gas–particle sys-
tems, and proposed a modiﬁcation of the form of the buoyant term to incorporate the eﬀect
of the relative motions of the phases. His development is based on the observation made by
Bouillard et al. (1989), who attributed the origin of the complex characteristics of the two-ﬂuid
equations to the buoyancy term. However, for gas–particle systems the compressible particle
phase has a separate pressure related to the granular temperature, which is often suﬃcient to
ensure that the resulting two-ﬂuid model is hyperbolic.

31
More recently Picardi et al. (2016) tried to deﬁne a criterion for the grid resolution to avoid
the numerical diﬃculties. Their study, however, did not account for the required momentum
exchange terms to properly describe bubbly ﬂows, and did not study the hyperbolicity of the
model equations. It is worth observing at this point that approaches that deﬁne a minimum
grid resolution to ensure that a solution of the model can be obtained do not address the
actual challenge of formulating a model that allows a grid-converged solution to be achieved.
The constraint on the grid resolution, on one hand, relates a purely numerical aspect of solution
procedure to a physical parameter, typically the bubble radius, which has been removed from
the equations by means of the averaging procedure.
On the other hand, it introduces an
arbitrary limit to the spatial scales that can be resolved. As a consequence, a formulation of
the two-ﬂuid model that allows a solution to be achieved on an arbitrarily ﬁne grid should be
preferred.
In the present work, we investigate the hyperbolicity of the two-ﬂuid equations examining
the role of momentum transfer terms in ensuring this condition. We focus our attention on a
dispersion term analogous to the one proposed by Davidson (1990). Diﬀerently from Davidson,
however, we argue that such a dispersion term should be present also when laminar bubbly
ﬂows are considered, since it describes the eﬀect on the drag acting on one bubble due to the
disturbances in the ﬂow caused by the presence of other bubbles. We propose a closure based on
the considerations of Batchelor (1988); Biesheuvel and Gorissen (1990), with a dispersion coef-
ﬁcient determined to ensure the hyperbolic nature of the two-ﬂuid equations. We demonstrate
that the introduction of this dispersion term allows the hyperbolicity of the two-ﬂuid model,
and its grid convergence, to be ensured without introducing a second pressure term, whose
physical justiﬁcation is not always clear, in particular in the case of incompressible phases.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows: in Sec. 2.3 the equations of the
two-ﬂuid model and the constitutive equations used as closure are summarized. In Sec. 2.4
the hyperbolicity of the one-dimensional form of the model is investigated, and a constraint
on the dispersion coeﬃcient to ensure the hyperbolic nature of the equations is determined.
Sec. 2.6 illustrates an application to a one-dimensional shock tube problem, where the role of
the dispersion term in preventing unphysical behavior with grid reﬁnement is demonstrated.

32
The eﬀectiveness of the proposed modiﬁcation is further tested with numerical experiments
performed in a column with falling liquid, with progressively ﬁner grid resolutions, as shown in
Sec. 2.7. Finally, an example application to a two-dimensional bubble column is illustrated in
Sec. 2.8, showing how the addition of the dispersion term removes nonphysical oscillations in
the ﬂow, without compromising the experimentally observed ﬂuctuations of the gas plume.
2.3
Equations of the two-ﬂuid model for bubbly ﬂows
The equations of the two-ﬂuid model typically used to describe the evolution of gas–liquid
systems (Drew, 1971, 1983a,b) are summarized in this section, since they are the base of the
study discussed in this work, and they are used to perform the numerical experiments here
described.
The continuity equation for the generic phase ϕ is
∂
∂t (αϕρϕ) + ∇· (αϕρϕUϕ) = 0,
(2.1)
where αϕ is the phase fraction, ρϕ is the thermodynamic density of the phase, and Uϕ is the
phase velocity.
The phase momentum equation for the liquid phase is
∂
∂t (αlρlUl) + ∇· (αlρlUl ⊗Ul) = ∇· τ l −αl∇p + αlρlg + Mgl,
(2.2)
while for the gas phase
∂
∂t (αgρgUg) + ∇· (αgρgUg ⊗Ug) = ∇· τ g −αg∇p + αgρgg + Mlg,
(2.3)
where τ ϕ is the phase stress tensor, p is the shared pressure, g the gravitational acceleration
vector, Mgl = −Mlg is the momentum exchange term, except for buoyancy which is included
in the shared pressure. This last term is computed as the sum of the drag MD, lift ML, virtual
mass MVM, wall-lubrication MWL, and dispersion forces Mdis. For the purpose of this work,
we focus our attention on the drag, virtual mass and dispersion terms because they will be
subject of the hyperbolicity study in Sec. 2.4. We should note that the closure for the phase
stress tensor introduces second-order spatial derivatives, which do not aﬀect the hyperbolicity

33
of the system. Thus, in Sec. 2.4 the τ ϕ are set to zero. Stress tensors are, however, preserved
in the numerical implementation, and a Newtonian behavior is assumed for each of the phases.
The drag term is deﬁned as MD = KUr, where K = αgρlβ, Ur is the slip velocity, and
β = 3

(2.4)
with Cs the drag coeﬃcient.
The virtual mass term is deﬁned, following Drew and Lahey

(2.5)
where

which modiﬁes the slip velocity in the drag term, is deﬁned as
Mdis = ρlβδdis
αl
∇αg,
(2.7)
with dispersion coeﬃcient (Batchelor, 1988; Biesheuvel and Gorissen, 1990)
δdis = Cdisdp|Ur|√αgαl.
(2.8)
Here, Cdis is a parameter whose value will be investigated in the next section, and is linked to
the hyperbolicity of the two-ﬂuid equations. The dispersion term in Eq. (2.7) in unrelated to
the pressure diﬀerence between phases but, instead, arises due to the presence of bubble-bubble
interaction through the ﬂuid phase.
It was observed in the introduction that some authors (Davidson, 1990) used a term formally
similar to the one of Eq. (2.7), but related it to the dispersion of the gas phase caused by
turbulent ﬂuctuations. However, it is known (Fax´en, 1922) that, also in the case of purely
laminar ﬂows, the drag force acting on each bubble is aﬀected by the disturbances induced
in the liquid-phase velocity ﬁeld by the other bubbles. This eﬀect is typically neglected in
the two-ﬂuid model, where the momentum transfer term due to drag only accounts for the
mean drag, often modeled with closures describing the force acting on an isolated sphere in an
undisturbed ﬂow ﬁeld. The introduction of the dispersion term in Eq. (2.7) allows the eﬀect

34
of the disturbances in the ﬂow ﬁeld due to the presence of other bubbles to be taken into
account, which results in a modiﬁed slip velocity in the drag term. In the next section we will
illustrate the role of this dispersion term in ensuring the hyperbolicity of the equations of the
two-ﬂuid model, and we will relate the dispersion coeﬃcient to the drag coeﬃcient through the
hyperbolicity condition.
2.4
Study of the hyperbolicity of the one-dimensional two-ﬂuid model
We study in this section the hyperbolicity of the set of PDEs describing the evolution of the
gas and liquid phase in a gas–liquid system. To this purpose, we consider the one-dimensional
two-ﬂuid model, writing its equations in non-conservative form.
The phase continuity equation for the gas phase then reads
∂αg
∂t + Ug
∂αg
∂x + αg
∂Ug
∂x = 0,
(2.9)
while, for the liquid phase, it is
∂αl
∂t + Ul
∂αl
∂x + αl
∂Ul
∂x = 0.
(2.10)
Similarly, we consider the phase momentum equations in non-conservative form, including the
momentum coupling terms due to drag, virtual-mass and dispersion forces. We then have, for
the gas phase,
αg (ρg + CVMρl) ∂Ug
∂t −αgCVMρl

,
(2.23)
where equality identiﬁes the curve of the minimum value of the dispersion coeﬃcient Cdis that
ensures the system of PDEs in Eq. (2.13) is hyperbolic.
An example of the hyperbolicity curve for a case with large density ratio (ρl ≫ρg) is shown
in Fig. 2.1, where the virtual mass coeﬃcient is set to CVM = 0.5 (Drew and Lahey, 1987),
and the drag coeﬃcient is set to the constant value Cs = 0.44, obtained for a spherical bubble
when the Reynolds number based on the slip velocity between the phases is Re > 1000.
The behavior of the curve allows to conclude that, depending on the local value of the gas
volume fraction, assuming Re > 1000, the coeﬃcient of the dispersion term in Eq. (2.8) must
be Cdis ∈[0.2, 1.2] to ensure that the PDEs that deﬁne the two-ﬂuid model are hyperbolic. In
particular, in no case the dispersion term can be removed from the phase momentum equa-
tions for any value of the gas-phase fractions, because this would cause Eq. (2.13) not to be
hyperbolic, leading to nonphysical predictions. This is demonstrated in the numerical experi-
ments discussed in the following sections. To conclude the mathematical analysis, we examine
a few special cases that occur when some of the momentum exchange eﬀects are not taken into
account:
• If CVM = 0 and Cdis = 0, Eq. (2.18) admits real roots if, and only if, the slip velocity
between the phases Ug −Ul is null. This allows us to conclude that the equations of the
two-ﬂuid model in Eq. (2.13) are never hyperbolic if the momentum coupling term only
accounts for the drag force without dispersion.

• If CVM > 0 and Cdis = 0, Eq. (2.18) does not admit real roots for any positive value of
the virtual mass coeﬃcient CVM. This results implies that Eq. (2.13) never deﬁnes an
hyperbolic set of PDEs if the momentum exchange term only incorporates the eﬀect of
drag (without dispersion) and virtual mass forces.
• The case CVM = 0, Cdis > 0, in which the eﬀect of the virtual mass force is neglected, but
the dispersion term is added to the drag force, leads to real roots for Eq. (2.18) under

Numerical approach
The two-ﬂuid model was solved using the reactingTwoPhaseEulerFoam solver available in
the open-source code OpenFOAM (2016). The solver implements a pressure-based solution
algorithm designed for a co-located grid arrangement (Ferziger and Peric, 2002). The checker-

38
board eﬀect is avoided by means of an improved formulation of the Rhie–Chow interpolation
(Rhie and Chow, 1983; Zhang and Zhao, 2004). The buoyancy term is incorporated in the
pressure, and other contributions to the momentum exchange term are treated as ﬂuxes, at
cell faces (Zhang and Zhao, 2004). The drag contribution to the momentum exchange term is
treated with the partial elimination procedure (Spalding, 1980, 1983; Karema and Lo, 1999).
The boundedness of the phase volume fraction is ensured by a ﬂux-corrected scheme (Weller,
2006). A second-order scheme with the Sweby (1984) limiter is used to reconstruct the face
value of the ﬂow variables from the corresponding variable at cell centers. A ﬁrst-order Euler
implicit scheme is used for time integration. The time step is adapted to ensure the Courant-
Friedrichs-Lewy condition is satisﬁed. Coupling between pressure and velocity is achieved by
means of the PIMPLE algorithm (OpenFOAM, 2016), which is a combination of the SIMPLE
(Patankar, 1980; Ferziger and Peric, 2002) and the PISO procedures (Issa, 1986; Oliveira and
Issa, 2001; Ferziger and Peric, 2002).
2.6
One-dimensional two-phase shock tube problem
We consider a one-dimensional shock tube with two incompressible phases to investigate
the eﬀect of the dispersion term of Eq. (2.7) on the numerical solution.
We compare the
solution of the two-ﬂuid model with and without Mdisp to illustrate that the addition of this
term, with a coeﬃcient satisfying the condition of Eq. (2.23), ensures that the solution of the
two-ﬂuid equations consistently converges with grid reﬁnement, without showing nonphysical
behavior across the discontinuity. The geometry of the shock tube and its conﬁguration are
shown in Fig. 2.2, while the condition considered in the numerical experiments are reported
in Tab. 2.1. The drag coeﬃcient of Tomiyama et al. (1998) was used in all the simulations.
It is apparent from Fig. 2.3 that the volume fraction proﬁle along the shock tube predicted
by the model without the dispersion term shows a signiﬁcant undershoot at the location of
the discontinuity in the ﬂow properties. Similarly, Fig. 2.4 shows that, in the absence of the
dispersion term, the numerical predictions show overshoots in the liquid velocity. This is clearly
incorrect, since the analytical solution is a sharp change in the gas-phase fraction, without
overshoot and undershoot. We also note that the problem becomes more serious when the

resolution of the computational grid is increased. The solution obtained after the addition of
the dispersion term of Eq. (2.7), on the other hand, does not present the nonphysical behavior
of overshoot and undershoot observed when this term is absent.
Additionally, in the case
with the dispersion term, the numerical solution converges with grid reﬁnement, allowing to
numerically demonstrate the independence of the solution from the grid resolution.
As shown in Fig. 2.3, we consider three progressively ﬁner grid resolutions with 4000, 8000
and 16000 grid cells, respectively.

One-dimensional falling ﬂuid problem
We repeat the numerical experiment of grid reﬁnement described in Sec. 2.6 in a system
constituted by a one-dimensional two-phase system with the liquid phase at the top, and falling
under the eﬀect of gravity. The geometric conﬁguration of the problem is reported in Fig. 2.5,
and the initial conditions used in the numerical simulations are summarized in Tab. 2.2. The
same closure models used in Sec. 2.6 are used for all the simulations discussed in this section.
The proﬁles of volume fraction at t = 1 s, with 8,000, 16,000 and 32,000 grid cells,
are reported in Fig. 2.6. The proﬁles obtained without the dispersion term show nonphysical
behavior across the discontinuity in the proﬁle, which manifest with undershoot and overshoot
in the values of the volume fraction. The introduction of the dispersion term addresses the
problem, leading to the expected results, and to a convergent solution with grid reﬁnement. It
is also worth observing that the solution for the grid with 32,000 cells without the dispersion
term is not reported because the numerical procedure was unable to provide a solution and
terminated with error in such case (i.e., nonphysical values for αg). This numerical diﬃculty
disappeared with the introduction of the dispersion term.

Application to an example bubble column
A two-dimensional bubble column, 45 cm tall and 10 cm wide, was considered to study the
eﬀect of the dispersion term proposed in this work on the prediction of a typical gas–liquid
ﬂow encountered in applications. In particular, the solution of the two-ﬂuid model is reported
for diﬀerent grid resolutions (44 × 200, 88 × 400, 166 × 800, 322 × 1600) to illustrate how the
addition of the dispersion term, on one hand, allows a grid-convergent solution to be reached,
and, on the other hand, that the absence of the term leads to the predictions of nonphysical
structures with high concentration of gas not observed in experiments.
The drag coeﬃcient in these simulations is modeled following Tomiyama et al. (1998), the
lift force coeﬃcient was calculated using the expression of Legendre and Magnaudet (1998), and
the wall-lubrication force with the model of Antal et al. (1991c). The virtual mass coeﬃcient
was set to CVM = 0.5 (Drew and Lahey, 1987).
The bubble column is initially ﬁlled with water (ρl = 1000 kg m−3, µl = 8.90 × 10−4 Pa s)
up to the height of 38 cm. Air is injected through an oriﬁce located at the bottom-right of
the column, with a velocity whose only non-zero component is vertical, with a magnitude of
5 cm s−1. The oriﬁce is 5 cm wide, and its rightmost side is at a distance of 5 mm from the
right wall of the column. The no-slip condition is applied to walls for both the phases, while
the pressure is set to the atmospheric at the outlet, located at the top of the column, where a
Neumann condition is used for all other variables.
Figs. 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11 show the color maps of the gas volume fraction in the bubble
column in an instantaneous snapshot taken at t = 1 s of actual ﬂow time. It is apparent that,
in absence of the dispersion term, the numerical solution shows nonphysical structures in the
ﬂow, whose size depends on the grid resolution, and in which the value of the gas-phase volume
fraction increases with grid reﬁnement. From a numerical perspective, this sensitivity of the
model to the grid resolution does not allow a grid-converged solution to be achieved, while,
from the perspective of correctly describing the physical ﬂow behavior, it leads to the prediction
of features that are not observed in experiments, such as an excess of bubble clustering and a
premature onset of ﬂow instability in homogeneous suspension of bubbles. Similar structures

are observed in the gas-phase velocity ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 2.12(a), and, consequently, in the
liquid velocity ﬁeld (not reported here). The introduction of the dispersion term described in
Sec. 2.3 addresses the prediction of these nonphysical features by ensuring the hyperbolicity
of the model equations, without qualitatively altering the large-scale unsteady behavior of the
gas plume.
Observing the sequence of Figs. 2.9(b), 2.10(b), 2.11(b), 2.12(b), 2.13(a), we conclude that
the addition of the dispersion term also allows a grid-converged solution to be achieved for
the ﬁelds of gas volume fraction and velocity. The velocity ﬁeld shows some small structures
on the bottom-left of Fig. 2.12(b) that may be interpreted as oscillations, questioning the
stabilizing eﬀect of the dispersion term. However, further grid reﬁnement (Fig. 2.13) shows that
these structures do not become ﬁner with the increased grid resolution, and do not originate
oscillations that amplify with grid reﬁnement. This indicates that the ﬁner grid resolution is
resolving structures of the ﬂow that were not captured by the coarser grids. Furthermore, these
results stress the importance of including the dispersion term in order to achieve the desired
level of spatial accuracy. Indeed, when the dispersion term is removed, nonphysical structures
will be predicted by the two-ﬂuid model since it is not guaranteed to be hyperbolic.
2.9
Conclusions
The eﬀect of the momentum transfer term on the hyperbolicity of the equations of the
two-ﬂuid model with shared pressure was investigated. It was shown that the introduction of a
dispersion term, whose role is to eﬀectively modify the slip velocity in the drag term appearing
in the two-ﬂuid equations, leads to a conditionally hyperbolic set of equations depending on
the value assigned to the dispersion coeﬃcient. An expression for the minimum value of the
dispersion coeﬃcient that ensures the hyperbolic nature of the equations of the two-ﬂuid model
was obtained.
The proposed dispersion term was applied to the simulation of two one-dimensional prob-
lems, involving a shock tube and a falling liquid. In both cases it was shown that the absence
of the dispersion term leads to nonphysical proﬁles in the ﬂow variables where sharp discon-
tinuities are present. The solution of the model without the dispersion term (non-hyperbolic

51
model) also prevented a grid-converged solution to be achieved. The results obtained with the
dispersion term (hyperbolic model) provided the expected results across sharp discontinuities,
and led to a numerical solution convergent with grid reﬁnement.
An example of a two-dimensional bubble column was considered to illustrate the importance
of ensuring the hyperbolicity of the equations of the two-ﬂuid model in applications of practical
interest. It was observed that, in the absence of the dispersion term, the numerical solution
remained sensitive to the grid resolution even at the ﬁnest grid reﬁnement used in this work, and
showed the presence of nonphysical regions with high concentration of disperse phase, which
are not observed experimentally. These artifacts were not observed in the same simulations
repeated with the hyperbolic two-ﬂuid model.
Finally, it is worth observing that the coeﬃcient obtained here for the dispersion term is
based on mathematical considerations. The purpose of the study is to show that such a term
needs to be present when simulating bubbly ﬂows, independently from their laminar or tur-
bulent nature. The physically correct formulation of the coeﬃcient, as well as the impact on
the agreement of the model predictions with experimental measurements need further inves-
tigation. Physically consistent models for the coeﬃcient could be obtained, for example, by
performing direct numerical simulations on ensembles of buoyant particles with gradients in
the volume fraction.

CHAPTER 3.
PERFORMANCE OF CURRENT ISOTROPIC
TURBULENCE MODELS: k-ω, k-ϵ
3.1
Introduction
Dispersed gas-liquid ﬂows are encountered in several applications of industrial interests e.g.
nuclear reactors, chemical reactors, oil and gas ﬂow through pipelines etc., modeling of these
ﬂows accurately is important, as it inﬂuences the design parameters of these equipments. Sev-
eral modeling approaches such as DNS, Euler-Lagrange and Euler-Euler have been proposed by
diﬀerent authors in the past, a good account of these approaches can be found in the reviews of
(Jakobsen et al., 1997; Joshi, 2001). Since the ﬁrst two approaches (DNS and Euler-Lagrange)
requires high computational cost, majority of the work on dispersed gas-liquid ﬂows related
to industrial application use Euler-Euler approach and its extensions, to predict the ﬂow. In
Euler-Euler approach both phases are treated as interpenetrating continua and the ﬂow equa-
tions for both the phases are derived by ensemble averaging the microscopic equations with the
interface jump conditions (Drew, 1983a). The performance of this approach is analyzed by sev-
eral authors (Lai and Salcudean, 1987; Schwarz and Turner, 1988; Torvik and Svendsen, 1990;
Jakobsen et al., 1993; Celik and Wang, 1994; Sokolichin and Eigenberger, 1994a; Grevskott
et al., 1996; Ranade, 1997).
Lai and Salcudean (1987) performed a simulation of bubbles rising in a stagnant liquid using
a steady state Euler-Euler approach. They simpliﬁed their model by assuming the gas phase
inertia and viscous forces to be negligible. The liquid velocity proﬁle obtained from the sim-
ulation showed good agreement with the experimental data. However, they do not report the
void fraction proﬁle.
Schwarz and Turner (1988) used the Euler-Euler approach coupled with the standard(std) k−ϵ

53
model to simulate a gas stirred bath. They found that a k −ϵ model with the standard con-
stants for single phase ﬂows works well, if a suﬃciently accurate Euler-Euler model (like for
e.g. separate momentum equations has to be solved for each phase and no assumptions should
be made about the hold up) is employed. They compared the Liquid velocities and turbulent
kinetic energy with the experimental data and found a good agreement, but there is no com-
parison of void fraction reported in their work.
Grienberger and Hofmann (1992) performed a simulation on a 2D bubble column using the
Euler-Euler approach by accounting for turbulence with the aid of standard k −ϵ model. They
studied the ﬂow in both homogeneous and heterogeneous regime. They could obtain a good pre-
diction of Liquid velocity for both the regimes, however the hold predictions were not accurate
especially in the near wall region.
Celik and Wang (1994) used a steady state Euler-Euler approach to study the circulation in
a bubble column with only drag force as the inter-phase force. Their main objective was to study
the impact of prescribed and calculated gas fraction on the ﬂow prediction. They concluded
that the gas fraction proﬁle computed from the simulation gives much better prediction of
velocity than the prescribed gas fraction proﬁle.
(Torvik and Svendsen, 1990; Jakobsen et al., 1993; Grevskott et al., 1996) have used a steady
state Euler-Euler model with expressions for lift, drag and virtual mass force coupled with k−ϵ
model accounting for the eﬀect of bubble induced turbulence, to simulate the bubble column
operating in homogeneous and transition regime. They observed a good prediction of liquid
velocity, volume fraction and turbulence with the experiments.
Ranade (1997) developed a computational model for predicting ﬂows in bubble columns
within Eulerian-Eulerian framework by adding two source terms in the momentum equation
along with drag and lift.
The ﬁrst source term accounts for the correlation generated due
to drag on time averaging and the other source term accounts for the contribution of liquid
wakes on the slip velocity. They used a std single phase k −ϵ model without any additional
source terms accounting for the production of turbulent kinetic energy due to bubbles, under
the assumption, that the turbulent kinetic energy produced due to the bubbles is balanced by
the dissipation at the bubble surface (Katoaka, 198). Their model showed good agreement in

54
the prediction of velocity and holdup with experiments for both homogenous and heterogenous
regime.
From the literature, it can be concluded that Euler-Euler approach predicts the averaged
liquid velocity proﬁle in the bubble column reasonably well. However, the holdup prediction
was not reported in many works (Lai and Salcudean, 1987; Schwarz and Turner, 1988) or
not predicted accurately (Grienberger and Hofmann, 1992).
Though the models proposed
by (Ranade, 1997; Torvik and Svendsen, 1990; Jakobsen et al., 1993) improved the holdup
prediction, it is tested only for low inlet gas velocities.
At high gas fractions and inlet gas velocities, the turbulence is predominant and becomes
one of the key phenomena which inﬂuences the prediction of the ﬂow in multiphase ﬂow systems,
Hence it is very important to accurately account for these phenomena.
Turbulence is one of the principle unresolved problems in single phase ﬂows, and for the
multiphase ﬂows the problem becomes more complex due to the presence of the secondary phase
(for e.g. bubbles, particles etc.). In this type of ﬂow ﬁeld, ﬂuctuations are not only induced
by the shear-induced turbulence, but also due to the continuous bubble movement of the gas
phase, the wake motion behind the bubbles and the motion of the bubble’s interface. Mudde et
al. (1997) measured the eddy viscosity in a bubble column applying PIV technique. They found
that the shear-induced turbulence contribution to the eddy viscosity is one order of magnitude
higher than the bubble-induced contribution, however they performed their experiments with
very low superﬁcial gas velocities and gas fractions. Bubble induced turbulence might be equally
important for high superﬁcial inlet gas velocities and gas fractions.
Single phase two equation k −ϵ models are used to predict the turbulence in the ﬂow in
several publications (Becker et al., 1994; Pﬂeger and Becker, 2001; Sokolichin and Eigenberger,
1999; Buwa and Ranade, 2002).
Becker et al. (1994) performed a 2D simulation with the standard k −ϵ model to study the
dynamic behaviour of the ﬂow in a bubble column. They found that the standard k −ϵ model
results in a much higher increase in the viscosity causing the damping of the plume leading
to unsatisfactory results. Pﬂeger and Becker (2001) and Sokolichin and Eigenberger (1999)
performed a 3D simulation with the same column used by Becker et al. (1994) and found out

55
that the overprediction of turbulent viscosity is corrected by the damping eﬀect of the wall in
the third direction, which results in the accurate capture of the dynamic behaviour of the ﬂow
in the column. A similar line of conclusion is made by Buwa and Ranade (2002) and Oey et
al. (2003) from their simulations. One of the main shortcoming of the k −ϵ models used by
these authors are that, it doesnot account for the production of turbulent kinetic energy by the
bubbles, restricting the model to be used only for systems with weak turbulent interactions of
gas and liquid. Several experiments have shown the signiﬁcance of interphase interactions on
the structure of turbulence in the liquid in bubbly ﬂows (Wang et al., 1987b; Moursali et al.,
1995; Liu and Bankoﬀ, 1993b). These experiments show that the interfaces, by modifying the
characteristic scales of the turbulence, alter the diﬀerent mechanisms (e.g. production, redistri-
bution and dissipation). There are many works (Elghobashi and Aboua Arab, 1983; Kataoka
and Serizawa, 1989; Troshko and Hassan, 2001a; Behzadi et al., 2004) in the literature which
account for these interactions by introducing source terms in the transport equations of k and
ϵ.
Elghobashi and Abouarab (1983) and Kataoka and Serizawa (1989) derived a transport equa-
tion for turbulent kinetic energy by performing statistical averaging on the ﬂow equations.
The correlations generated due to the averaging of the interphase terms which quantiﬁes the
interphase turbulent kinetic energy transfer is modelled by assuming it to be proportional to
the product of interface forces and slip velocity. Troshko and Hassan (2001) performed a sim-
ulation on dispersed gas-liquid ﬂows in a turbulent vertical pipe using the model proposed by
Kataoka and Serizawa (1989), they could obtain a good agreement in gas fraction and liquid
velocity proﬁles with the experiments. Pﬂeger and Becker (2001) performed a 3D simulation
of a cylindrical bubble column by using a standard k −ϵ model accounting for bubble induced
turbulence. They concluded that the incorporation of bubble induced turbulence improved the
prediction of the radial proﬁles of liquid velocities, however, the model deteriorates the pre-
diction of gas fraction. They also concluded that the detailed understanding of the inﬂuences
of bubble induced turbulence requires the employment of ﬁne numerical grids and further test
cases. Behzadi et al. (2004) derived a model for the transport of mixture turbulent kinetic
energy in the high phase fraction limit by assuming that both phases tend to ﬂuctuate as one

56
entity at high phase fractions. The eﬀect of turbulence generated due to bubbles is accounted
through a source term which is a function of turbulence response coeﬃcient (Ct = u
′
1
u′
2 ). They
tested the performance of their model by applying it to predict the bubbly ﬂow in a sudden
expansion of a circular pipe. They could get reasonable predictions of phase fraction and ve-
locity, however, they concluded that a more accurate model is required to account for bubble
induced turbulence.
The above literature survey suggests that the literature is ﬂooded with k −ϵ models both
with and without source terms to predict the multiphase ﬂow turbulence, however, the works
related to k −ω models appears to be scarce, to our knowledge only Bech (2005) has used a
k −ω model to simulate dispersed gas-liquid ﬂow in a bubble column. He concluded that, with
low Reynolds number corrections in his k −ω model, he could predict the plume oscillation
more accurately than the k−ϵ model, although he used k−ω model in his simulations, he didn’t
account for the production of turbulent kinetic energy by the bubbles. k −ω model has been
proven to be better than k −ϵ model for single phase ﬂow applications with adverse pressure
gradients and also it can be integrated through the viscous sublayer without the aid of any
damping functions (Pope, 2000). However, what advantages it could provide for multiphase
ﬂows is unclear from the literature, ﬁrm conclusions cannot be derived about the performance
of k −ω models for multiphase ﬂow applications unless tested rigorously for multiphase ﬂow
scenarios. Hence, we derive a multiphase k −ω model, both High and low Reynolds number
form, by accounting for the interphase exchange of turbulent kinetic energy and implement it
in the open source code OpenFOAM. The performance of the implemented model is compared
with the two equation k −ϵ model of Jr. (2005) and validated with the experiments related
to bubble columns and pipe ﬂows (Monrs-Andreu et al., 2013; Troshko and Hassan, 2001;
Harteveld, 2001).

3.2
Governing equations
3.2.1
Euler-Euler approach
The ﬂow equations in an Euler-Euler framework are represented as (Drew, 1983):
Mass:
∂
∂t (ρiαi) + ∇· (αiρiui) = 0
(3.1)
Momentum:
∂
∂t (ρiαiui) + ∇· (αiρiuiui) = −∇· (αiτ i) −α∇p + αiρig + MF,i
(3.2)
The stress term in each phase i is computed as:
τi = −µeﬀ

∇ui + (∇ui)T −2
3I (∇· ui)

(3.3)
where µeﬀis the eﬀective viscosity which captures the eﬀect of both molecular and turbulent
transport. In multiphase ﬂows, the turbulent transport can be subdivided in to the shear in-
duced turbulence and the turbulence caused due to the movement of bubbles referred to as
pseudo turbulence. Hence, µeﬀbecomes,
µeﬀ= µ1 + µ1T + µBI,1
(3.4)
µBI,1 can be accounted from the model proposed by Sato and Sekoguchi (1975a),
µBI,1 = ρ1CBIα2dp|u1 −u2|
(3.5)
turbulent viscosity µ1T is computed as in single phase ﬂows (Wilcox, 2000),
µ1T = Cµ
k2
ϵ
(3.6)
where the turbulent kinetic energy (k) and the dissipation (ϵ) are obtained by solving the
derived transport equation for k and ϵ discussed in the subsequent sections.

3.2.2
Interphase forces
The interphase force term MF,i in equation (2.2) represents the momentum transfer between
the phases. It is modeled as the superposition of drag, lift, virtual mass, turbulent dispersion
and wall lubrication forces.
MF,i = MD,i + ML,i + MVM,i + MW,i + Mtd,i
(3.7)
Drag force
Drag force (MD,i) resists the motion of the bubbles. For a spherical bubble of uniform size it
is related to the slip velocity ur by the expression given by Ishii and Mishima (1984)
MD,i = −3

(3.8)
Several correlations for drag coeﬃcient (CD) are available in the literature for both single
bubble (Schwarz and Turner, 1988; Johansen and Boysan, 1988; Tomiyama et al., 2002) and
bubble swarms (Ishii and Zuber, 1979; Behzadi et al., 2001; Garnier et al., 2002), we adopt
the correlation proposed by Tomiyama (1998), which relates the drag coeﬃcient to the Eotvos
number (Eo) and Reynolds number (Re) as

Virtual mass force
When the bubble accelerates, the liquid surrounding the bubble gets accelerated leading to an
additional force called added mass or virtual mass force (MVM,i), it can be calculated by (Milne
- Thomson, 1968)
MVM,i = −α2ρ1CV M
du1


(3.10)
where CV M is the virtual mass coeﬃcient which is 0.5 according to Auton et al. (1988).
Lift force
In a shear ﬂow a spherical particle experience forces which move the particle in the direction
normal to the ﬂow, it can be expressed with the expression given by Auton (1981)
ML,i = −α2ρ1CLur × ∇× u1
(3.11)

59
We use the lift coeﬃcient (CL) proposed by Tomiyama (1998)
Wall lubrication
Wall lubrication force (MW,i) prevents the bubbles from touching the wall. The main eﬀect of
this force is to assure zero void condition found experimentally near vertical walls, while not
signiﬁcantly eﬀecting the void fraction distribution away from the wall (Antal et al., 1991a).

Turbulent dispersion
Turbulent dispersion force (Mtd,i) accounts for the turbulent ﬂuctuations due to liquid phase
on the gas phase and can be expressed as ?)
Mtd,i = −ρ2Ctdk1∇α2
(3.14)
where Ctd = 0.1

A wall function approach (Launder and Spalding, 1974) as in single phase ﬂows are used to

The ﬂow equations are implemented in the open source code OpenFOAM. Second order
accurate schemes present in OpenFOAM are used to discretize the spatial derivatives and a
ﬁrst order accurate scheme for time derivatives. explicit MULES solver is used to integrate the
alpha equation. A PIMPLE algorithm which is a combination of PISO and SIMPLE is used
to couple the pressure and velocity.

Results and discussion
3.5.1
Simulation cases
The models are validated for bubble column ﬂows (Harteveld, 2005) and turbulent vertical
pipe ﬂow experiments (Wang, 1987; Monros-Andreu et al., 2013) for wide range of ﬂow con-
ditions. Also, the performance of the models are analyzed by comparing it with the already

65
established k −ϵ model (Lahey, 2005). The simulation conditions and experimental setup used
for the study, followed by the comparison and validation of the simulation results are discussed
in the subsequent sections.
3.5.1.1
case 1 (Harteveld, 2005)
The experiments performed by Harteveld (2005), on a bubble column are used to validate
the models in the low void fraction (0 - 10 percent), low Reynolds number (3000 - 4000) regime.
In their experiment, they study a 2D bubble column with the aid of particle image velocimetry
(PIV) and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). The bubble column used for the study was
0.243 m wide, 0.041 m deep and 0.99 m high. The top portion of the column was open to the
atmosphere and air was injected with a velocity of 0.02 m/s through the bottom portion of the
column. The injected air move through the stagnant water inducing turbulent ﬂuctuations and
gets ejected at the top to the atmosphere. The needle injectors were used to keep a narrow
bubble size distribution ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 mm, due to the narrow bubble size distribution
the ﬂow could be assumed close to a monodispersed ﬂow with bubble diameter 4 mm. Seven
aeration patterns were used by varying the width of the inlet to investigate the ﬂow structure
inside the column. The aeration pattern 5 as shown in
3.5.1.1 is chosen for the validation
of the solver. A 3D simulation is performed with inlet and boundary conditions as given in
Tables 3.1 and 3.2 respectively. The results obtained from the simulation are extracted from
the location z = 0.05 m is compared with the experiment.
Fig.
3.2 shows the comparison of volume fraction and velocity proﬁles for diﬀerent tur-
bulence models and high resolution (mesoscale DNS) with experiments. The results indicate
that the volume fraction is better predicted by the k-ω model compared to k-ϵ model. It is
expected that the two-ﬂuid model with high resolution or mesoscale DNS gives the best pre-
diction compared to any turbulence models. The velocity prediction is comparable for both
turbulence models at the center of the column, however k-epsilon model predicts better close
to the boundary. The mesoscale DNS predicts the even the velocity proﬁle better compared to
both turbulence models both at the center and close to the boundary.

ber (27000 - 40000) regime are validated with the turbulent vertical pipe ﬂow experiments
performed by Monros-Andreu et al. (2013). They performed the experiments on a pipe of di-
ameter 0.052 m and height 5.5 m. The working ﬂuids in operation were air and water. The air
was injected at the bottom of the pipe by a sparger, which kept the bubble diameters ranging
from 1 to 3 mm in the pipe. They investigate the ﬂow structure inside the pipe for wide range
of inlet superﬁcial liquid velocities (0.5 - 3 m/s) and void fractions (0 - 30 percent) The void
fraction and the liquid velocities are measured with the four sensor conductivity probe and
Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) respectively. Measurements are taken at three diﬀerent
axial locations (L/D = 22.4, 61, 98.7).
Pipe simulated in the current work has a diameter of 0.052 m and is a section of the original
pipe (Monros-Andreu et al., 2013) taken between the axial locations z/D = 61 and z/D = 98.7,
which results in a pipe length of 1.95 m. The experimental readings of the volume fraction, gas
velocity and liquid velocity at z/D = 61 are averaged over the cross section and given as the
inlet conditions. A case with inlet void fractions 0.066 is chosen from the experiments for the
validation of the solver as given in Table 3.3. A 2D axi-symmetric simulation is performed with
inlet and boundary conditions as given in Table 3.4 respectively. Steady and fully developed
proﬁles of volume fraction and liquid velocity at z = 1.95 m are extracted from the simulation
and compared with the experimental readings.

Conclusion
In the current study an ad-hoc multiphase k −ω model is derived, both high and low
Reynolds number form, by accounting for the interphase exchange of turbulent kinetic energy.
The derived model implement it in the open source code OpenFOAM. The performance of the
implemented model is compared with the two equation k −ϵ model of Jr. (2005) and validated
with the experiments related to bubble columns and pipe ﬂow.
Harteveld’s experiments comparison
The comparisons with Harteveld’s experiments indicate that the volume fraction is better pre-
dicted by the k-ω model compared to k-ϵ model. It is expected that the two-ﬂuid model with
high resolution or mesoscale DNS gives the best prediction compared to any turbulence models.
The velocity prediction is comparable for both turbulence models at the center of the column,
however k-ϵ model predicts better close to the boundary. The meso-scale DNS predicts the
even the velocity proﬁle better compared to both turbulence models both at the center and
close to the boundary.
Monros’s experiments comparison
The results indicate that the volume fraction prediction close to the wall is not aﬀected by the
turbulent source terms, however, at the center the volume fraction is under predicted by the k-
ω model for all the source terms. The velocity prediction is comparable for all the source terms.
Wang’s experiment comparison
The results indicate that the volume fraction prediction by the k-ϵ, k-ω LRN close to the wall
is not good. However, k-ω HRN model seems to reasonably well close to the wall. The velocity
proﬁle close to the boundary is better predicted by the k-ω models (HRN, LRN) than the k-ϵ
model.
The study shows the ad-hoc isotropic turbulence models may not be suﬃcient for accurate

72
prediction of turbulence in gas-liquid ﬂows, hence a turbulence model has to be derived from
the conservation equations (two-ﬂuid model) and the unclosed terms appearing in the model
has to be closed using mesoscale DNS study.

Abstract
Swarm driven turbulent bubbly ﬂows are typically encountered in the bubble columns oper-
ating in the dense heterogeneous regime. The columns operating in this regime are vulnerable
to buoyancy induced instabilities resulting in the formation of mesoscale bubble swarms which
while rising agitates the ﬂuid and causes turbulence. The eﬃcient design of these systems with
the aid of CFD simulations requires accurate prediction of turbulence due to these swarms
through turbulence models. The development of turbulence models requires turbulence data
in this regime which is challenging to obtain with the experimental techniques like PIV, LDA
for dense bubbly ﬂows due to high scattering of light (Mudde, 2005; Roghair et al., 2011a) due
to the bubbles. The multi-phase simulation techniques to acquire turbulence data like particle
resolved (?) and point particle DNS methods (Subramaniam, 2013) require high computational
cost due to the large domain size and number of bubbles involved in achieving the turbulence
in dense heterogeneous ﬂow regime.
In the present study we derive a general Reynolds stress equations for turbulent bubbly
ﬂows by phase averaging (PA) the two-ﬂuid model with the procedures discussed in (Fox, 2014).
The unclosed terms generated due to PA, which accounts for turbulence exchange between the
phases are quantiﬁed by performing mesoscale two-ﬂuid ﬂow simulations on statistically ho-
mogeneous ﬂows in the dense heterogeneous regime. The computational domain for mesoscale
simulations considered in the study is a 3-dimensional domain with square cross-section. Peri-

74
odic boundary conditions are applied to all sides of the domain to create a statistically homo-
geneous turbulent ﬂow in order to isolate and study the mean-gradient-independent unclosed
terms that account for the exchange of turbulence quantities between the phases. The turbu-
lence statistics, length and time scales, mean momentum budget and the turbulence energy
budget computed from the simulations for diﬀerent gas fractions are reported and analyzed.

Introduction
Bubble columns are widely used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries as gas–
liquid contactors because of their simple construction and ability to provide high contact area
for mass and heat transfer. The design and scale up of bubble columns depend on two key
factors: heat/mass transfer and mixing characteristics. These two factors highly depend on
the bubbly ﬂow hydrodynamics of the column. Although simple in construction, the bubbly
ﬂow hydrodynamics inside bubble columns are complex due the presence of turbulence and
bubble–bubble interactions (coalescence, breakup), thus, the development of computational
models that accurately describe bubbly ﬂows are challenging.
Bubbly ﬂows typically fall in either the homogeneous or heterogeneous regime (Joshi et al.,
1998; Ruzicka et al., 2001), depending on low and high inlet gas ﬂow rate, respectively.
The homogeneous regime is characterized by a uniform rise of bubbles with the absence
of any large scale turbulent instabilities due to buoyancy. In this regime, the main sources of
turbulence are the ﬂow disturbances generated due the movement of the bubbles in the vicinity
of the bubble and the wake formation behind the bubble. In the limit of high bubble Reynolds
number (200 - 700) as in the current study, the bubble induced liquid ﬂuctuations are governed
by wake formation (?). In many works (Ma et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2006; Dhotre et al., 2008;
Deen et al., 2001) the eﬀect of bubble induced turbulence is added as an eﬀective liquid viscosity
(Sato and Sekoguchi, 1975a) in the stress term of the liquid momentum conservation equation,
however, to our knowledge the model developed in Sato and Sekoguchi (1975a) considers only
the eﬀect of liquid disturbances not the wake turbulence. The bubble induced turbulence (BIT)
due to the wake formation is modelled for bubbly ﬂows in the recent works (Riboux et al., 2013;
Ma et al., 2017), however the applicability of the model is restricted to very dilute bubbly ﬂows

75
with non-interacting wakes. The experimental investigation of mixing due to bubble induced
turbulence performed by Alm´eras et al. (2015) for moderately dense bubbly ﬂows (αg ∼13%)
shows that the bubble induced turbulence production in the moderately dense limit reaches a
saturation due to the increase in dissipation caused due to the wake interactions. Thus, the
BIT models (Sato and Sekoguchi, 1975a; Riboux et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2017) developed in the
dilute limit as a linear function of αg without considering the dissipation of wake interactions
may overpredict the BIT in the dense limit (αg ∼30% −50%).
The heterogeneous regime consists of highly buoyant bubble swarms generating large-scale
turbulent structures that signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the hydrodynamics. In most applications, the
gas ﬂow rates are high and the columns operate in the heterogeneous regime. Hence, under-
standing the swarm-induced turbulence in the heterogeneous regime is crucial for the develop-
ment of accurate turbulence models.
The current turbulence models for the heterogeneous regime (Torvik and Svendsen, 1990;
Grienberger and Hofmann, 1992; Ranade, 1992; Hillmer et al., 1994; Hjertager and Morud, 1995;
Svendsen et al., 1992; Lahey, 1990a) are inadequate mostly because they are ad-hoc without a
proper description of how the interphase forces are modiﬁed by the bubble swarms. Moreover,
most turbulence models were developed based on the assumption of isotropic turbulence, which
is not appropriate for predicting the highly anisotropic ﬂows (Mudde et al., 1997) found in
the heterogeneous regime. Moving forward, the validation of turbulence models will require
accurate data for bubbly ﬂows coming either from experiments or simulations. In order to
understand the correlation between the instantaneous ﬂuid velocity and local bubble volume
fraction due to bubble swarms, simultaneous measurements of both quantities are required.
Experimental investigations have been performed by many investigators (Yang et al., 1993;
Degaleesan et al., 2001; Cui and Fan, 2004; Mudde et al., 1997) to understand the character-
istics of the large-scale turbulent structures in the bubbly ﬂows. Yang et al. (1993) performed
experiments using CARPT (computer-automated radioactive-particle tracking) and studied
turbulence for diﬀerent superﬁcial gas velocities and column diameters. Their study showed
that the axial Reynolds stress component is large compared to the radial Reynolds stress, and

76
they commented that the eddy-viscosity model based on the assumption may not be suitable
for predicting turbulence in bubble ﬂows. They also computed the auto-correlation function,
which indicates a strongly correlated ﬂow in the axial direction compared to the radial direc-
tion. Furthermore, they suggested gradient based modeling of mixing or turbulent stresses is
inadequate and more sophisticated models have to be developed.
Degaleesan et al. (2001) used the CARPT technique to investigate the turbulence in bubble
columns. They analyzed the time-averaged liquid velocity proﬁles and Reynolds stresses for
various inlet gas ﬂow rates and column sizes. They found that the time-averaged liquid axial
velocity and Reynolds stress proﬁles undergo a steep change as the superﬁcial gas velocity is
increased from 2.4 to 12 cm/s, which indicates a transition from the homogeneous to the het-
erogeneous regime. Their ﬁndings also show that the axial normal Reynolds stress contribution
is highest compared to the other components, indicating a high degree of anisotropy in the
turbulence.
Cui and Fan (2004) used particle image velocimetry (PIV) to investigate the inﬂuence of
turbulence due to the bubbles on the liquid-phase in a bubble column for a wide range of su-
perﬁcial gas velocities encompassing the homogeneous and heterogeneous regimes. They found
that the turbulence production due the bubbles in the liquid phase is much higher compared
to the shear-induced turbulence production, thereby dominating the total turbulence kinetic
energy balance in the ﬂow. They demonstrated that the increase in superﬁcial gas-velocity,
which led to the transition to the heterogeneous regime, resulted in increased frequency of the
largest vortex spanning the entire column, thereby changing the length scales of turbulence.
Experimental optical techniques (PIV, LDA) are limited to moderate gas fractions (10–
20%) ﬂows (Mudde, 2005; Roghair et al., 2011a), because of large scattering of light by the
bubbles, making it almost impossible to visualize the liquid ﬂow ﬁeld. Due to the limitation of
experiments in exploring these high-gas-fraction, industrially relevant regime, one has to resort
to simulation techniques.
Many investigators (Druzhinin and Elghobashi, 1998; Murai et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2011;
Roghair et al., 2011b; Uchiyama and Kusamichi, 2013; Yang et al., 2002; Lakkaraju et al.,
2011; Pang et al., 2013; Nierhaus et al., 2007; Fujiwara et al., 2004; Rensen et al., 2005)

77
have performed DNS simulations using various multi-phase simulation methods Euler-lagrange,
front-tracking and Euler-Euler methods to study bubbly ﬂow turbulence. Most studies revolve
around turbulent channel or pipe ﬂows with shear induced turbulence, which may show a
diﬀerent turbulent behaviour compared to purely buoyancy driven turbulent ﬂows found in the
bubble columns. Furthermore, almost all the works perform simulations in the low gas fraction
(0.1%) limit to study the small-scale turbulence of the order of bubble diameter ∼dp, where
the large-scale instabilities found in the heterogeneous regime are not formed.
Climent and Magnaudet (1999) performed a fundamental investigation on the eﬀect of
bubbles in generating the large-scale instabilities using Euler-Lagrange approach based on dif-
ferent Rayleigh numbers. They found that below a critical Rayleigh number 2 × 105, bubbles
rise almost in straight lines with no particular large scale structures and the amplitude of the
ﬂuctuations in the liquid velocity ﬁeld is small in this regime. On the contrary, for Rayleigh
numbers > 2 × 105, bubble trajectories signiﬁcantly diﬀers from straight lines and large scale
structures starts to emerge. The authors have tried to explain the mechanism behind onset of
such instabilities by comparing it to the Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities based on density gradi-
ents. Furthermore, they have stressed on the need of 3D simulations over 2-D simulations as
performed in their work to fully understand the phenomena.
In the current study, we use the Reynolds-stress equation for bubbly ﬂow in order to analyze
the anisotropic turbulence found in the heterogeneous regime. The derivation is performed by
applying the phase-averaging (PA) techniques discussed in (Fox, 2014a) to the two-ﬂuid model
for bubbly ﬂows. Application of the PA procedure results in unclosed terms in both mean two-
ﬂuid equations and Reynolds-stress transport equations. To quantify and study the variation
of those unclosed terms as a function of gas fraction, we perform 3-D simulations of bubbly
ﬂows on a periodic box by varying the gas fractions between 15–50%. Moreover, we study the
turbulence characteristics at high gas fractions in order to understand (i) the one-point statistics
and anisotropy of bubbly ﬂows, (i) the distribution of turbulent energy among diﬀerent length
scales, and (iii) the length and time scales of the ﬂuid vorticity and bubble swarms.

78
4.3
Two-Fluid Model for Bubbly Flow
Two-ﬂuid equations can be obtained by ensemble averaging the instantaneous conservation
equations (Drew, 1983a). As a result of averaging, unclosed terms appear in the equations,
which have to be closed with appropriate closure models. The predictive capability of two-
ﬂuid equations depend largely on these closure models. Hence, it is essential to seek accurate
interphase closure models from the literature.
A single pressure formulation as given in Eq. (4.2), is adopted by most works (Svendsen
et al., 1992; Sokolichin and Eigenberger, 1994b; Lapin and L¨ubbert, 1994; Sommerfeld et al.,
2003; Yeoh and Tu, 2006) to simulate bubbly ﬂows. The assumption of a single pressure is valid
if the surface tension force at the gas–liquid interface is negligible (Drew, 1983a). However, a
bubble-dispersion term must be included in order for the two-ﬂuid equations to be hyperbolic.
The two-ﬂuid model used in this work is as follows.

and the index φ = g, l corresponds to gas and liquid, respectively. The function Iφ is 1 for
φ = l and −1 for φ = g. The microscale liquid ﬂuctuatons induced due to the bubble wakes is
added as an eﬀective liquid visosity:
µleﬀ= µl + µBIT
The modeling of µBIT and its eﬀects on mesoscale turbulence is discussed in subsec. 4.6.4.
The swarm-induced turbulence investigated in this work will be nearly unchanged for in-
viscid ﬂow (i.e. µφ = 0) in the simulations.

Interphase force models
4.3.1.1
Drag force FD
Drag force accounts for the resistance experienced by the bubble while moving in the liquid
phase, it is a result of the shear and form drag of the ﬂuid ﬂow. Drag force is considered to
be very signiﬁcant in bubbly ﬂows as it controls the rise velocity determining the gas residence
time and contributes towards the generation of liquid vortices. The models proposed for drag
force can be subdivided into two main categories: stokes drag (Happel and Brenner, 2012) and
inertial drag Schiller and Naumann (1935); Beetstra et al. (2007). Stokes drag model is used in
the limit of bubble Reynolds number (Rep) ∼1. The simulations in the current work involve
Rep of the order of 600 - 700, hence an inertial drag law as given in Eq. (4.3) is adopted, where
the drag coeﬃcient CD is generally modeled as a function of Rep (Schiller and Naumann, 1935;
Levich et al., 1962).

In bubbly ﬂows, bubbles have a tendency to deform as the size increases, which inﬂuence
the form drag component of the drag force, hence correlations for drag coeﬃcient has to be
developed to accomodate the eﬀect of shape change.
Tomiyama (1998) have developed a
correlation as given in Eq. (4.4), which accomodates the eﬀect of shape change on the drag
force, through Eotvos number (Eo), it can be noted from the expression given in Eq. (4.4)
that the drag coeﬃcient purely depends on Eotvos numer rather than Reynolds number after a
critical bubble diameter ∼4 mm indicating the importance of shape change on the drag force
after a critical bubble diameter.

80
4.3.1.2
Virtual mass force FVM
Virtual mass force is the force resulting from the acceleration of displaced ﬂuid in the
neighbourhood of the bubble (Milne-Thomson, 1968). It is modeled as given in Eq. (4.5),
FVM = αgCVMρl
Dug
Dt −Dul
Dt

(4.5)
CVM = 0.5
The signiﬁcance of virtual mass force depends on the density ratio of continuous and dis-
persed phase, higher density ratio corresponds to higher virtual mass force (Prosperetti and
Tryggvason, 2009), typically in gas-particle ﬂows virtual mass force is neglected due to the low
density ratio, however in bubbly ﬂows it is signiﬁcant. In the region near to the sparger bub-
ble accelerates signiﬁcantly, addition of this force controls the acceleration and facilitates the
bubble to achieve a realistic terminal velocity. Moreover, it is reported by many (Drew, 1983a;
No and Kazimi, 1985; Watanabe et al., 1990) the addition of virtual mass force improves the
numerical stability by modifying the eigen values associated with the two-ﬂuid model system
of equations, hence it is used in some low density ratio ﬂows as well, eventhough it is not signif-
icant in that limit. A value of CVM = 0.5 is deduced theoretically for spherical rigid particles
in potential ﬂow by Maxey and Riley (1983) and is used in many works (Buwa and Ranade,
2002; Lahey, 1990a; Ekambara et al., 2008) to successfully predict bubbly ﬂows. In the current
work a value of 0.5 is retained for the virtual mass coeﬃcient.
4.3.1.3
Lift force FLF
Lift force is signiﬁcant in bubbly ﬂows with high strain rate such as vertical pipe ﬂows.
Flow inside the bubble column exhibit low velocity gradients due to the stagnant nature of the
liquid. However, lift force is known to contribute towards the stability of the bubble column
(Lucas et al., 2005; Krepper et al., 2007; Mazzitelli and Lohse, 2009). A local increase of the gas
fraction causes a local acceleration of the liquid in the upward direction leading to the gradient
in the vertical velocity component, such velocity gradient pushes the bubbles from the region
of increased gas fraction to regions with low void fraction, thus stabilizing the ﬂow. We adopt
a lift force formulation Eq. (4.6) given in Zun (1980), which is used in many works (Torvik

81
and Svendsen, 1990; Delnoij et al., 1997b; Joshi, 2001; Lahey, 1990a) to predict bubbly ﬂow
behaviour.

The lift coeﬃcient (CL) in these works were assumed to be constant 0.5. However, in the
experimental investigation of Tomiyama et al. (2002b), it was found that the lift coeﬃcient
is a strong function of size, lift coeﬃcient decreases with the increase in the bubble size and
eventually turns negative after a critical bubble size of approximately 5 mm. Depending on the
sign of this coeﬃcient, lift force may have a stabilizing or destabilizing eﬀect on the ﬂow. Hence,
it is essential to add an appropriate lift coeﬃcient model which incorporates the dependency
on bubble size, to accurately predict the instabilities in the ﬂow.
4.3.1.4
Bubble dispersion FBD
Bubble dispersion accounts for the hydrodynamic interaction between bubbles or the drag
induced by one bubble over the other through the liquid. The addition of bubble dispersion
ensures that the two-ﬂuid model is hyperbolic, thereby removing unphysical ﬂuctuations in αg.
FBD = −αgρlCD|ug −ul| δdis
αgαl
∇αg
(4.7)
where δdis = Cdisdp|ug −ul|√αgαl and Cdis = 1.3. In addition to ensuring a hyperbolic system,
bubble dispersion is known to stabilize (Lucas et al., 2005) the bubbly ﬂow by smoothing
out the non-uniformity in the gas fraction proﬁle. Bubble columns are known to stay stable
qualitatively up to a global void fraction of 0.25–0.3 (Harteveld, 2005b), hence the addition of
this force also contributes towards achieving that result.

82
4.4
Reynolds-Averaged Equations
Bubble columns are commonly operated in very large scales, in the order of tens of meters.
At such scales it is computationally impossible to resolve the turbulent ﬂow structures. Hence
we derive the Reynolds-averaged equations by phase averaging the two-ﬂuid model, by assuming
that the two-ﬂuid equations with high grid resolution will accurately predict the large-scale
features like turbulence generated due to bubble swarms. Detailed description of the steps
involved in the derivation of the Reynolds-averaged equations can be found in Fox (2014a). In
the current work we extend the model given in Fox (2014a), for bubbly ﬂows by adding the
appropriate interphase submodels into the two-ﬂuid equations (Eq. (4.1) and (4.2)) speciﬁcally
adopted for bubbly ﬂows and phase averaging them.
By performing phase averaging on the two-ﬂuid equations (Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2)), we get the
Reynolds-averaged equations in the following form:

where ⟨·⟩g is the phase average with respect to the gas phase, and ⟨·⟩l is the phase average with

The continuity equation does not have any unclosed term appearing in the equation. How-
ever, if you notice the momentum equation Eq. (4.9), it has several unclosed terms due to
the phase averaging of the non-linear convection and interphase force terms. The inﬂuence of
these unclosed terms on driving the ﬂow patterns are quantiﬁed in the study through mesoscale
simulations.
The unclosed term due the convection term which is Reynolds stress is generally modeled

83
(Svendsen et al., 1992; Hjertager and Morud, 1995; Grienberger and Hofmann, 1992; Lahey,
1990b) using Boussinesq approximation (Pope, 2000), where it is assumed to be proportional to
the strain rate and the proportionality constant is the eddy viscosity as shown in Eqn. (4.11).

The eddy viscosity is modelled similar to the molecular viscosity (see for e.g. in (Pope,
2000)), where it is assumed to be a product of a length and a velocity scale. These length
and velocity scales are casted in terms of the turbulent kinetic energy (k) and dissipation (ϵ)
to compute the eddy viscosity as given in Eq. (4.11). Then, a two equation transport model
(k-ϵ) is used to calculate the quantities k and ϵ. A transport model for k and ϵ for multiphase
ﬂows can be found in Fox (2014a). Unlike the ad hoc versions used in the works (Svendsen
et al., 1992; Hjertager and Morud, 1995; Grienberger and Hofmann, 1992; Lahey, 1990b), it is
derived from the multiphase ﬂow equations through phase averaging.
The modeling strategy based on the assumption of turbulence isotropy as above may not be
appropriate for bubbly ﬂows due to the signiﬁcant anisotropy involved, hence one has to com-
pute the turbulent stresses directly by deriving a Reynolds stress transport equation and seek-
ing closures for the unclosed terms in the derived Reynolds stress transport equation through
mesoscale simulations. A Reynolds stress transport equation is derived in the following sub-
section.
4.4.1
Reynolds-stress equations
By performing a tensor product of u
′′
φ and the momentum (Eq. (4.2)) and phase averaging
we can obtain the following transport equation for Reynolds stress for gas and liquid phase.

There are several unclosed terms which appear in the RST Eqns.
(4.12) and
(4.13)
due to the phase averaging and has to be modelled to eﬀectively solve the equations to obtain
Reynolds stress. Transport terms transport the turbulence in the ﬂow systems through diﬀusion
and convection.

requires modeling. These terms can be combined and modelled based on gradient diﬀusion
hypothesis similar to single phase ﬂows as given in Pope (2000).
In the current work, Pressure strain ⟨pl∇u
′′
φ⟩, viscous dissipation ⟨σ · ∇uφ“⟩and inter-
phase production terms due to lift, drag, buoyancy, virtual mass and bubble dispersion are
quantiﬁed from the mesoscale simulations in the Reynolds stress budget section. The turbulence

85
production due to shear -⟨αφ⟩⟨u
′′
φu
′′
φ⟩pφ · ∇⟨uφ⟩φ is usually negligible compared to inter-phase
production in bubble solumns due to the small velocity gradients ∇⟨uφ⟩φ in the ﬂow. Hence,
it is reasonable to ﬁrst study the eﬀect of inter-phase production terms rather than the shear
induced turbulence production in bubble columns.
4.5
Statistically homogeneous ﬂows
In bubbly ﬂows encountered in bubble columns shear induced turbulence can be negligible
due to the stagnant nature of the liquid pool. The main source of turbulence production then
would be due to the interphase coupling (drag, buoyancy etc.). By simulating a homogeneous
bubbly ﬂow by applying periodic boundary conditions, eliminates the transport terms in the
conservation equations (Eqns. (4.9),
(4.12) and
(4.13)), including the turbulence produc-
tion due to shear. We can thus obtain the transport equations merely in terms of interphase
force terms (Eqns. (4.14) and
(4.15)) and production terms due to the interphase coupling
(Eqns. (4.16) and (4.17)).

Results and discussions
4.6.1
Simulation setup
The computational domain for mesoscale DNS is constituted by a 3-D box. Periodic bound-
ary conditions are applied on all the sides of the column. Periodic boundary condition simpliﬁes
the RA equations by eliminating the terms containing mean gradients of the statistics. How-
ever, the liquid phase is continuously accelerated and the system never reaches a statistically
stationary state. To prevent the acceleration of the system a modiﬁed liquid pressure gradient
computed by enforcing the average net mass ﬂux to be zero. The inﬂuence of the periodic
boundary condition on the statistics is eliminated by choosing a domain size based on the ve-
locity pair correlation function discussed in Sec. 4.6.8. The properties of both the phases used
in the simulation are given in Tab. 4.1.
The closure study is performed by varying the initial global void fraction as given in Ta-
ble 4.2. For αg > 0.4 the heterogeneous ﬂow regime with turbulent structures can be seen in
the simulations.

A grid resolution of db/2 is adopted (see Sec. 4.6.3) and a time resolution of the order
of bubble relaxation time is adopted for the simulations. The schemes used are second-order
accurate in space and ﬁrst-order accurate in time. The turbulence characteristics of the ﬂow
are studied by varying the global void fraction as given in Tab. 4.2.
4.6.2
Flow regime
In the homogeneous regime, the simulation reach a steady state where all of the variables are
independent of time. In contrast, the heterogeneous regime is characterized by vold fraction
ﬂuctuations, or bubble swarms, and turbulence due to the coupling of these bubble swarms
and the liquid phase. Phase coupling in the heterogeneous regime creates high vorticity regions
in the ﬂow.
Bubble swarms are observed in this regime due to gas accumulation in high
vorticity regions. Fig. 4.1 is obtained from the simulations, in the ﬁgure black contour line
corresponds to the border of the clusters and these borders approximately trace out the high
vorticity region (light green regions) indicating the preferential accumulation of bubbles in high
vorticity regions. Fig. 4.2 shows the vector plot of liquid velocity at a particular plane parallel
to the ﬂow direction. From the ﬁgure it can be seen that the ﬂow is ﬁlled with vortices in the
heterogeneous regime.

Grid independence study
The probability distribution function (PDF) for αg = 0.5 for three grid resolutions: coarse
(dp), base (0.5dp) and reﬁned (0.25dp). from the simulations are reported in Fig. 4.4. It can
be concluded from Fig. 4.4 that the PDF curves obtained from the simulations for all the three
grid resolutions are similar, in other words degree of segregation is similar for all the three grid
resolutions.
Furthermore, the ﬁrst order statistic of gas rise velocities are compared for αg = 0.5 for
three grid resolutions coarse (dp), base (0.5dp) and reﬁned (0.25dp) in Fig. 4.3. From Fig. 4.3,
a diﬀerence of 5.2% is found between the average gas rise velocity for cases with grid resolution
(dp) and base (0.5dp) and, a diﬀerence of 1.9% is found between 0.5dp and 0.25dp.
Hence, from the above grid independent study we adopt a grid resolution of 0.5dp which is
computationally feasible and does not compromise the accuracy, for the simulations in this

91
study to compute the statistics in the mean momentum and RST equations.
4.6.4
Eﬀect of bubble induced turbulence
The lack of BIT viscosity models in the dense regime as discussed in the introduction
motivated us to extract a BIT model constant from the experimental data given in Alm´eras
et al. (2015) which is performed for moderately dense bubbly ﬂows.
We assume the same
model form for the BIT viscosity given in Sato and Sekoguchi (1975b) and extract the BIT
model constant CBIT = ScBITC∗
BIT by assuming a bubble induced turbulence Schmidt number
of ScBIT −0.1 and ﬁtting C∗
BIT to the experimental data.

does not modify the cluster length scales signiﬁcantly, hence it is reasonable to conclude that
the mesoscale turbulence is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the turbulence in the small scale wakes
which quickly gets dissipated due to the wake interactions.

4.6.5
Probability distribution function (PDF) of velocity ﬂuctuations in both
phases and gas fraction
The probability distribution function of streamwise and spanise velocity ﬂuctuations in both
liquid and gas phase is computed from the simulations and reported in Fig. 4.6 and Fig. 4.7.
The PDF of streamwise liquid velocity ﬂuctuations (Fig. 4.6(left)) shows positive skewness and
deviate from the gaussian behaviour for both gas fractions studied. The larger probability of
upward ﬂuctuations of streamwise velocity ﬂuctuation component is due to the entrainement
of the liquid in the wake of the rising bubbles. However, the PDF of spanwise liquid velocity
ﬂuctuations (Fig. 4.6(right)) follows a strictly gaussian behaviour due to the symmetry of the
ﬂow (no mean force acting in the spanwise direction). Similar trends are observed for the PDF
of the velocity ﬂuctuations in the gas phase (Fig. 4.7) due to the tendency of the bubbles to
follow the liquid ﬂow due to low inertia.

It is interesting to note that the rise velocity (⟨ug⟩pg) at αg = 0.5 and αg = 0.4 are
higher than the single bubble rise velocity of 0.2 m/s (Simonnet et al., 2007), indicating that
the formation of bubble swarms increase the rise velocity, this behaviour is also reported by

for αg = 0.3 and αg = 0.15 the average bubble rise velocity is the similar to the single bubble
rise velocity 0.2 m/s indicating a homogeneous rise of bubbles with no instabilities or swarm
formation.
4.6.7
Radial distribution
The radial distribution function (RDF) in the streamwise (z) and spanwise (x) directions
computed as given in Eqn. (4.19) are reported in Fig. 4.8 for gas fractions 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5. The
good decay of the RDF within the streamwise and spanwise length of the domain indicates
that all the length scales of the clusters are captured in the simulation eﬀectively.
G (r) = ⟨αφ (x, t) αφ (x + r, t)⟩
⟨αφ (x, t)⟩⟨αφ (x + r, t)⟩
(4.19)
Moreover, it can be noted from Fig. 4.8 that the RDF doesn’t change over the stream and
spanwise directions for gas fraction 0.3 compared to gas fractions 0.4 and 0.5, which is due to
the absence of liquid vortices which causes swarm formation.

The cluster size (Lz) computed from the radial distribution function in the z direction seems
to be similar in both the phases. However, the cluster size (Lx) in the x direction is larger
for α = 0.4 compared to α = 0.5, this may be due to the better growth of the clusters in the
x direction before breaking into smaller clusters in the relatively low dense ﬂow in the case
of α = 0.4 compared to α = 0.5. A characteristic length scale (L) based on square of the
rise velocity and gravity is deﬁned as shown in the Table 4.4. The characteristic length scale
deﬁned, seem to predict the cluster length scale reasonably.

The good decay of pair correlation functions in Figures 4.9, 4.10 for both the phases indicate
that the turbulence statistics computed from the simulations are not aﬀected by the boundary
conditions, and also all the length scales of turbulence are captured accurately by the simulation.
The integral length and time scales from the pair correlation function can be computed as

Integral length and time scales computed from the pair correlation functions are given in
Table 4.5.
From the tables, it can be concluded that the integral length scales (Lφ
33z) computed by
integrating the zz-component (33) of the pair correlation function, in the z direction are larger
than every other scales computed by integrating every other components in every other di-
rections in both the phases. A strongly correlated ﬂow in the ﬂow direction compared to the
direction perpendicular to the ﬂow is also observed by Yang et al. (1993) in their experiment.
This may be due to the action of the inter-phase forces preferentially in the ﬂow direction
direction generating ﬂuid structures with larger length scales in the z direction compared to x
direction.
Moreover, the integral length scales of turbulence computed for both the gas fractions 0.5 and
0.4 are similar in both the phases, which is expected in bubbly ﬂows as the bubbles strictly
follow ﬂuid vortices or get accumulated in high vorticity ﬂuid regions due to low inertia.

Energy spectra
Energy spectrum for loadings 0.5 and 0.4 are given in Fig. 4.11. The spectrum shows
the distribution of turbulent energy among diﬀerent scales. It is interesting to note that the
turbulence for gas fraction 0.5 is anisotropic at scales of the order of dp which corresponds to
k = 1000. However, for gas fraction 0.4 turbulence reaches isotropic behaviour before k=1000
(∼dp). The distribution of energy among the scales beyond k = 1000, appear to show similar
proﬁle for gas fractions 0.5 and 0.4, suggesting the possibility of universality as can be found
in inertial range of the energy spectrum for single phase ﬂows.

500 samples, and reported for diﬀerent initial loadings of gas fractions in the Table 4.6. The
gas phase momentum budgets indicate that the correlation (Drag unclosed) term due to the
Reynolds Averaging of drag is positive and leads to drag reduction. The cluster formation
due to the accumulation of bubbles in the high vorticity regions leads to reduction in eﬀective
surface area of the bubbles compare to homogeneous rise of bubbles, giving an aerodynamic
advantage for the bubble rise. The drag reduction due to the correlation term reduces when
the global gas fraction is reduced from 0.5 to 0.4, which may be due to the increase in the size
of cluster in the horizontal direction (see Lx Sec. 6.3.1) for αg = 0.4 compared to αg = 0.5
leading to increase in eﬀective surface area on which liquid drag is acting.
The contribution of lift force and bubble dispersion towards the mean momentum is neg-
ligible due to the absence of mean gradients of velocity and gas fraction in the ﬂow.
The
correlation term VM generated due to the Reynolds Averaging of virtual mass is signiﬁcant,
though the ﬂow is homogeneous and statistically stationary, which may be due to the correla-
tions generated due to the RA of convection term (u · ∇u) present in the expression for the
virtual mass force (Eqn. (4.5)). From the tables, it can be concluded that the contribution of
the correlations generated due to RA of drag and virtual mass forces are higher than the cor-
relations generated due to RA of buoyancy (Buoyancy unclosed), hence preference in modeling
has to be given to unclosed terms related to drag force. The unclosed terms generated due to

RA of inter-phase forces are negligible for α = 0.3 and 0.15 due to the absence of turbulence
in those gas fraction limits.

Reynolds stress budget
The values of the terms appearing in the Reynolds stress transport equations (Eqns. (4.16)
and (4.17)) for gas fractions 0.5 and 0.4 obtained from the mesoscale DNS are reported in the
following Table 4.7.
From the tables, it can seen that the contributions of bubble dispersion (BD) and lift
forces (Lift) are statistically insigniﬁcant due to the homogeneity of the ﬂow. The main forces
which sustain the turbulence in the liquid phase are drag and virtual mass due to the strong
correlation of gas fraction ﬂuctuation due to cluster motion, and the liquid velocity appearing
in the RA of these forces. However, the turbulence production in the gas phase is mainly due
to buoyancy and virtual mass. In the liquid phase, it is interesting to note that though the
entire bubbly ﬂow is driven by buoyancy yet the contribution of buoyancy in producing liquid
turbulent kinetic energy.
Since a PR-DNS is not performed in the current study, the accurate values of the dissipation
of turbulent eddy is not captured, rather the turbulent dissipation appears as negative contri-
butions of the inter-phase forces towards Reynolds stress budget, thus the contribution due to

drag non-linearity (DNL) and buoyancy could be considered as dissipation of turbulent energy
in the liquid phase. The large values of the contributions of inter-phase forces towards the
Reynolds stress in the zz-direction compared to the xx-direction for both gas fractions 0.4 and
0.5 shows that the degree of turbulent anisotropy to be very high, indicating the importance of
adopting anisotropic turbulence models for accurate prediction of turbulence in bubbly ﬂows.
The pressure strain (PS) contribution accounts for the mechanism of feeding turbulent
energy from the strongest normal component (zz) or streamwise component of the Reynolds
stress to the weak spanwise components xx and yy of the Reynolds stress, which is evident
from the PS budget obtained from the mesoscale simulation.
From the budget it can be concluded that for the liquid phase the drag and pressure strain
(PS) correlation terms towards zz component of the Reynolds stress and Drag, Buoyancy and
pressure strain (PS) contributions towards xx component of the Reynolds stress have to be
modelled for both gas fracionions 0.5 and 0.4.
And for the gas phase the drag, buoyancy,
virtual mass (VM) and pressure strain (PS) contribution towards both xx and zz components
of Reynolds stress have to be modelled.

Conclusions
The present work investigates the turbulence characteristics in dense bubbly ﬂow regime
for statisitcally homogeneous ﬂows in order to develop a Reynolds stress transport model to
predict turbulence in such ﬂows. The dense bubbly ﬂow regime is prone to buoyancy induced
instabilities which leads to formation of bubble swarm and bubble swarm induced turbulence.
Industrial columns often operate in dense heterogeneous ﬂow regime, thus developing predictive
turbulence models in this regime is crucial for better simulation based design of the columns.
A general Reynolds stress equation to predict bubbly ﬂow turbulence is derived by phase
averaging the two-ﬂuid model. The unclosed terms generated due to the inter-phase forces
which physically represents the exchange of turbulence quantities between the gas and the liquid
phases are quantiﬁed through two-ﬂuid ﬂow simulations. The simulations are performed in a
periodic 3D domain with squared cross-section to isolate such unclosed terms. The simulations
are performed for gas fractions ranging from 15 - 50 %. The analysis of the ﬂow ﬁeld and

102
gas fraction indicate the accumulation of bubbles in high vorticity region leading to swarm
formation in the dense heterogeneous regime, however in the homogeneous regime there is no
production large scale vortices and no swarm formation is found. The probability distribution
function for the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuations computed from the simulations show postive
skewness and deviate from the Gaussian distribution function for both the phases, however the
spanwise ﬂuctuations for both phases roughly follows a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of
one point statistics shows a high degree anisotropy in the Reynolds stresses for both phases and
gas fractions for which the ﬂow in the heterogeneous regime. The rise velocity of the bubbles in
the heterogeneous regime is signiﬁcantly higher than the single bubble rise velocity indicating
a co-operative rise of bubbles (reduced drag compare to a single bubble rise).
The length scales computed from the radial distribution function or the cluster size of
the swarm roughly matches the characteristic length scale deﬁned by the rise velocity and the
gravity U2
r /g. The integral length scales computed from the two-point auto-correlation function
is larger compared to the cluster length scales and the deﬁned characteristic length scales.
The energy spectra for streamwise and spanwise components of Reynolds stress indicate
high degree of anisotropy at scales of the order of bubble diameter (dp) for αg −50% compared
to αg −40%.
The momentum budget computed from the simulation indicate that the unclosed term
generated due to PA of drag force is signiﬁcant compared to other unlcosed terms and has to
be modelled in the mean momentum equation to obtain the correct ﬂow prediction in the dense
bubbly ﬂow regime.
The Reynolds stress budget in the liquid phase indicate that turbulence exchange unclosed
terms originated from the PA of drag and the pressure strain terms signiﬁcantly aﬀects the
budget in the streamwise direction for both gas fractions and tends to decrease when the gas
fraction is decreased. However, in the spanwise direction the turbulent excange term due to
buoyacy along with the turbulent exchange term due to Drag and pressure strain seem to
aﬀect the budget and follows the same trend as streamwise direction when the gas fraction is
decreased.

Abstract
The bubble columns operating in the heterogeneous regime are vulnerable to buoyancy
induced instabilities resulting in the formation of bubble clusters which while rising agitates
the ﬂuid and causes turbulence. The eﬃcient design of these systems with the aid of CFD
simulations requires accurate prediction of turbulence due to these swarms through turbulence
models.
In the present study a multiphase Reynolds stress transport (RST) model is developed
by modeling swarm induced turbulence production, dissipation and redistribution of energy
(pressure-strain) from the multiphase DNS data obtained through mesoscale simulation. The
modeling of the transport terms and the viscous dissipation terms in the RST model, which
was not captured in the mesoscale simulations are also discussed. Moreover, the predictive
capability of the proposed RST model is assessed on a 3D bubble column by comparing it with
the mesoscale DNS simulation, a mixture k-ϵ model and a single phase RST model with no
swarm induced models.

Introduction
In numerous works (Torvik and Svendsen, 1990; Grienberger and Hofmann, 1992; Ranade,
1992; Hillmer et al., 1994) turbulence in bubbly ﬂows is modeled poorly by using adhoc ex-
tensions of single phase turbulence models. In these works the turbulence production due to

105
the bubbles is neglected and the model constants used for single phase k-ϵ model are retained.
(Sato et al., 1981; de Bertodano et al., 1994) achieved some success, in modeling turbulence by
assuming linear superposition of BIT and SIT, SIT is predicted by single phase k-ϵ model and
bubble induced turbulence is predicted either by an algebraic model given in Sato and Sekoguchi
(1987) or by a transport equation formed from shear induced turbulent kinetic energy equation
(TKE) by modifying the time scale of turbulent production. However, the assumption of linear
superposition of SIT and BIT may not hold in the limit of high void fraction. To account
for the coupling of SIT and BIT, in many works (Svendsen et al., 1992; Hjertager and Morud,
1995) BIT production is added as a source term to an extended framework of single phase TKE
equation. The source term is formulated based on the assumption that a fraction of work done
by the drag force goes into the production of TKE in the liquid phase. This fraction is adjusted
with the aid of a model constant by varying it from 0 to 1 for low to high void fractions.
Realizing that multiphase turbulence cannot be accurately predicted by just adhoc adjust-
ments of single phase k-ϵ models (Kataoka and Serizawa, 1989) derived TKE scalar balance
equations by ensemble averaging the instantaneous momentum equations. The production of
TKE due to bubbles can be explicitly seen in their derived transport equations, as unclosed
source terms. The unclosed source terms are modeled based on the same assumption as given
in (Svendsen et al., 1992; Hjertager and Morud, 1995). The stated assumption of drag force
being the only contributor towards the production of TKE has to to be revisited as there is
evidence (Lee et al., 1989; Roig et al., 1998) suggesting that virtual mass and buoyancy forces
also contribute towards TKE production. According to Roig et al. (1998) BIT production is
mainly due to the power developed by the virtual mass force rather than the drag force, and the
drag force contribute towards the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy in the wakes. Besides,
Lee et al. (1989) models the BIT production by assuming that the increase in liquid TKE comes
from a decrease in potential energy of liquid when bubbles displace the liquid which scales to
the power developed by the buoyancy force. These unclosed interfacial terms appearing in the
TKE equation have to be quantiﬁed appropriately by performing experiments or through direct
numerical simulations to resolve confusions like which interfacial force contributes signiﬁcantly?
and what fraction of the total work done by these forces goes into the TKE production?

106
Another important property of turbulence which is not studied or modeled rigorously in
the multiphase ﬂow literature is the turbulence dissipation. The presence of bubbles break the
larger eddies into smaller ones and modify the time scale of dissipation. In all the above works
discussed, the time scale of eddy dissipation was assumed to be the same as the turbulence
time scale ( k
ϵ ), which may not be appropriate for accurate prediction of turbulence. In an
attempt to account for the eﬀect of bubbles on the dissipation rate, Troshko and Hassan (2001b)
introduced a time scale based on bubble diameter and rise velocity, eﬀectively the dissipation
equation source term becomes proportional to the TKE production divided by the proposed
time scale, they pointed out that dissipation frequency by bubbles is much higher than the
viscous dissipation. A mixed time scale based on time constants dp
k and
l
ur is proposed by
Rzehak and Krepper (2013), as they believe the time scale associated with dissipation due to
bubbles is inﬂuenced by turbulent time scale and also the bubble time scale. These time scales
enter into the dissipation transport equation through source terms and correct the prediction
of the overall dissipation rate.
The eﬀect of gas phase turbulence in bubbly ﬂows is unclear as very few works (Grienberger
and Hofmann, 1992; Jr., 2005) accounts for it. In (Grienberger and Hofmann, 1992; Jr., 2005),
the gas phase turbulent viscosity is computed from the liquid phase turbulent viscosity based
on the scaling argument given in Serizawa et al. (1975), it states that the gas phase turbulent
viscosity scales with the product of liquid phase turbulent viscosity and the density ratio (ρg
ρl ).
Based on this scaling argument, the dispersed phase turbulence is neglected in most works.
Turbulence in bubbly ﬂows is anisotropic (Drew and Lahey, 1981; Wang et al., 1987a; Mudde
et al., 1997; Mudde, 2005) due to the directional preference of the interphase forces to enhance
or suppress the Reynolds stress components, yet very less attention is given towards the de-
velopment of anisotropic models like Reynolds stress transport models (RST), which may be
due to the complex structure of the RST equations and high computational cost. However,
for accurate prediction of turbulence in bubbly ﬂows anisotropic models are essential. In an
attempt to account for the turbulence anisotropy in bubbly ﬂows, Lahey (1990a) developed a
RST model for the continuous phase. The contribution of turbulence by bubbles is added in
the RST equation, in the form of a turbulence production tensor. The turbulence production

107
tensor is constituted by multiplying the turbulence production due to bubbles, by an anisotropy
matrix given in Nigmatulin (1979), whose elements gives the fraction of total turbulence pro-
duction due to bubbles, which goes to each normal components of the RST equation. He also
proposed that the presence of bubbles assists in isotropization of turbulence, hence to account
that eﬀect he modiﬁed the single phase pressure redistribution model by the addition of the
turbulence production tensor due to bubbles with a model constant. Chahed et al. (2003b)
derived RST equations by averaging the instantaneous conservation equations for two-phase
ﬂow. They decomposed the net turbulence stress tensor into SIT and BIT. To solve for SIT
they derived an RST equation, in the RST equation the presence of bubbles is accounted by
modifying the single phase closure for the diﬀusion and the pressure redistribution term. The
diﬀusion due to bubbles is added in the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in the form of a product of time
scale (d/ur) and the bubble induced turbulent stress tensor. The pressure redistribution due to
bubbles is added by modifying the turbulent time scale (k
ϵ ) present in the single phase closure
into a mixed time scale ( k
ϵ +α uR
d ). The bubble induced turbulent stress is obtained by solving a
separate RST equation for bubble induced stress. Diﬀusion term is modeled with single phase
closure. The production source term is modeled as a tensor product of virtual mass force and
rise velocity.
From the above literature review on modeling turbulence in bubbly ﬂows, it can be con-
cluded that many works have used ad hoc extensions of single phase turbulence models by
neglecting the BIT. The works which modeled BIT have not considered the contributions of
all the inter-phase forces (Drag, virtual mass, lift etc.) towards the production of TKE, rather
it is modeled by assuming that the drag force contributes the most towards the production of
TKE. The model constant used in the closure modeling of BIT is changed among the works
depending on the ﬂow conditions, indicating that it may be a function of the system Reynolds
number, Stokes number and α, hence it has to be studied carefully and constituted in terms
of these system parameters to avoid the adjusting done in the works. The coupling of gas
phase turbulence with the liquid phase is neglected based on the assumption of low Stokes
number in bubbly ﬂows, however the validity of this assumption has to be tested rigorously

108
in the dense regime, where the coupling becomes signiﬁcant and one may have to solve TKE
transport equation for gas phase and couple it with the TKE transport equation for the liquid
phase. The transport terms consisting of diﬀusion, dissipation and pressure redistribution are
closed by the closures available from single phase ﬂows assuming that the presence of bubbles
is only the source of production and do not contribute towards the transport of turbulence.
More comprehensive bubble - liquid two-phase turbulence models have to be developed whose
transport and production terms are closed using multiphase DNS data. And also inherently
anisotropic bubbly ﬂows are modeled using k - ϵ models in most of the works, hence a rigorous
multiphase RST model has to be developed based on multiphase DNS data, which capture the
anisotropy in these type of ﬂows.
In this chapter a multiphase Reynolds stress transport (RST) model is developed by mod-
eling swarm induced turbulence production, dissipation and redistribution of energy (pressure-
strain) from the multiphase DNS data obtained through mesoscale simulation. The modeling
of the transport terms and the viscous dissipation terms in the RST model, which was not
captured in the mesoscale simulations are also discussed. Moreover, the predictive capability of
the proposed RST model is studied on a 3D bubble column by comparing it with the mesoscale
DNS simulation, a mixture k-ϵ model and a single phase RST model with no swarm induced
models.

The pressure strain (PS) term which accounts for the redistribution of normal Reynolds
stresses is modeled in terms of a slow and rapid part for both the phases. The slow part of
the pressure strain contribution in the liquid phase is modeled analogous to the single phase
Rotta model by modifying the time scale of turbulence and Rotta model constant to integral
time scale (T=135τp)( 5.2) and C1L ( 5.1) respectively. Similar approach is followed for gas
phase by replacing time scale and model constant with the gas phase integral time scale and
model constant obtained from the mesoscale DNS data. The rapid part of the pressure strain
is modeled in terms of shear induced turbulence production for single phase ﬂows, similar
approach is followed by retaining the same model constant 0.6 from single phase ﬂows and
replacing the shear induced production by drag production. It should be noted that there is no
rapid part of pressure strain in the gas phase. The traceless property of pressure strain tensor
is followed by the model developed in both the phases.
5.3.2
Drag production, DNL
The Inter phase Production (DP and VM) which appears in the liquid phase Reynolds
stress equation is modeled based on the slip velocity. The model constant Cp( 5.1) is obtained
from the mesoscale DNS data. The modeling is based on the idea that the production becomes
zero when the slip velocity tends to zero, in a shear induced turbulent ﬂow, swarm induced
turbulence contribution is signiﬁcant only when the slip velocity is signiﬁcant.
DNL is the RA contribution of the non-linearity present in the drag model. Since DNL
appears as negative in the mesoscale DNS budget in the liquid phase, it could considered as
the dissipation caused due to the bubbles. DNL is modeled similar to the drag production
with a negative model constant Clznl( 5.1). The gas phase drag non linearity contribution is
negligible, hence it is not modeled.

Drag Exchange
The drag exchange which only appears in the gas-phase is modeled in terms of liquid and
gas phase Reynolds stresses with a model constantCDEz obtained from the mesoscale DNS.
5.3.4
Virtual mass
The virtual mass term is negligible in the liquid phase. However, in the gas phase it acts
as a production of turbulent energy. It is modeled similar to the drag production as a function
of square of slip velocity with a model constant Cgz ( 5.1).

Transport terms
Transport terms transport the turbulence in the ﬂow systems through diﬀusion and con-
vection. The transport terms are not computed in the homogeneous mesoscale DNS performed

113
in this work. These terms are modeled similar to single phase RST terms however, mesoscale
simulations of inhomogenous bubbly ﬂows can be performed to get a better insight on the in-
ﬂuence of bubbles on the transport of turbulence and more sophisticated diﬀusion models can
be developed based on the data . Convection term does not require any modeling, however,

Viscous dissipation
Turbulent Dissipation
The exact equation of dissipation (Pope, 2000) is complex due to the presence of large number
of unclosed terms even in single phase ﬂows. An empirical approach is followed in single phase
ﬂows to obtain the transport equation for dissipation, we follow the same approach to formulate
a transport equation for dissipation for multiphase ﬂows as given below:

The Eqn. 3.10 retains the same form as the single phase turbulent dissipation equation
except for the two additional terms C3Pkb and C4Pϵb to account for the eﬀect of dissipation
due to bubbles. The model constant C3 and C4 can be obtained either as a function of time
scales k/ϵ and τp as given in Fox (2014b) or from our mesoscale DNS simulations.

The grid resolution used for RANs ( 5.5) is three times higher than the mesoscale simu-
lations. A no slip boundary condition is given at the wall for the gas and the liquid velocity,
and zero gradient at the outlet assuming a fully developed ﬂow. Pressure is speciﬁed to be the
atmospheric pressure at the outlet and zero gradient is given at both inlet and wall. The wall
function boundary condition is given for dissipation and Reynolds stress at the wall. At the
inlet ﬁxed value is speciﬁed for dissipation and Reynolds stress.

Results and discussion
The gas fraction and velocity proﬁles predicted by the RANS model is comparable to
the mesoscale DNS. There is a small over prediction of the velocity proﬁles at the center of
the column (X=0.1m) which is attributed to the inability of the mesoscale DNS to capture
the turbulent dissipation accurately. Hence, appropriate adjustments of the turbulent model
constants in the dissipation equation has to be made for both the phases to correct this over
prediction. However, the prediction of the model at this stage can be considered reasonable
and can be tested for more complex multiphase ﬂows and systems.

Conclusion
The turbulent Reynolds stress budgets extracted from the mesoscale DNS is analyzed and a
turbulent Reynolds stress model is proposed to predict turbulent gas-liquid ﬂows. The modeling
strategies involved in modeling the terms quantiﬁed through mesoscale DNS is discussed. The
predictive capability of the proposed model is studied on a 3D bubble column by comparing
it with the mesoscale DNS simulations. The model predictions of the gas fraction and the
velocity proﬁles are in reasonable agreement with the mesoscale DNS. As a further study the
model can be tested for more complex turbulent multiphase ﬂows and multiphase ﬂow systems

CHAPTER 6.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
6.1
Hyperbolicity of two-ﬂuid model
The eﬀect of the momentum transfer term on the hyperbolicity of the equations of the
two-ﬂuid model with shared pressure was investigated. It was shown that the introduction of a
dispersion term, whose role is to eﬀectively modify the slip velocity in the drag term appearing
in the two-ﬂuid equations, leads to a conditionally hyperbolic set of equations depending on
the value assigned to the dispersion coeﬃcient. An expression for the minimum value of the
dispersion coeﬃcient that ensures the hyperbolic nature of the equations of the two-ﬂuid model
was obtained.
The proposed dispersion term was applied to the simulation of two one-dimensional prob-
lems, involving a shock tube and a falling liquid. In both cases it was shown that the absence
of the dispersion term leads to nonphysical proﬁles in the ﬂow variables where sharp discon-
tinuities are present. The solution of the model without the dispersion term (non-hyperbolic
model) also prevented a grid-converged solution to be achieved. The results obtained with the
dispersion term (hyperbolic model) provided the expected results across sharp discontinuities,
and led to a numerical solution convergent with grid reﬁnement.
An example of a two-dimensional bubble column was considered to illustrate the importance
of ensuring the hyperbolicity of the equations of the two-ﬂuid model in applications of practical
interest. It was observed that, in the absence of the dispersion term, the numerical solution
remained sensitive to the grid resolution even at the ﬁnest grid reﬁnement used in this work, and
showed the presence of nonphysical regions with high concentration of disperse phase, which
are not observed experimentally. These artifacts were not observed in the same simulations
repeated with the hyperbolic two-ﬂuid model.

125
Finally, it is worth observing that the coeﬃcient obtained here for the dispersion term is
based on mathematical considerations. The purpose of the study is to show that such a term
needs to be present when simulating bubbly ﬂows, independently from their laminar or tur-
bulent nature. The physically correct formulation of the coeﬃcient, as well as the impact on
the agreement of the model predictions with experimental measurements need further inves-
tigation. Physically consistent models for the coeﬃcient could be obtained, for example, by
performing direct numerical simulations on ensembles of buoyant particles with gradients in
the volume fraction.
6.2
Mesoscale DNS
The present work investigates the turbulence characteristics in dense bubbly ﬂow regime
for statisitcally homogeneous ﬂows in order to develop a Reynolds stress transport model to
predict turbulence in such ﬂows. The dense bubbly ﬂow regime is prone to buoyancy induced
instabilities which leads to formation of bubble swarm and bubble swarm induced turbulence.
Industrial columns often operate in dense heterogeneous ﬂow regime, thus developing predictive
turbulence models in this regime is crucial for better simulation based design of the columns.
A general Reynolds stress equation to predict bubbly ﬂow turbulence is derived by phase
averaging the two-ﬂuid model. The unclosed terms generated due to the inter-phase forces
which physically represents the exchange of turbulence quantities between the gas and the liquid
phases are quantiﬁed through two-ﬂuid ﬂow simulations. The simulations are performed in a
periodic 3D domain with squared cross-section to isolate such unclosed terms. The simulations
are performed for gas fractions ranging from 15 - 50 %. The analysis of the ﬂow ﬁeld and
gas fraction indicate the accumulation of bubbles in high vorticity region leading to swarm
formation in the dense heterogeneous regime, however in the homogeneous regime there is no
production large scale vortices and no swarm formation is found. The probability distribution
function for the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuations computed from the simulations show postive
skewness and deviate from the Gaussian distribution function for both the phases, however the
spanwise ﬂuctuations for both phases roughly follows a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of
one point statistics shows a high degree anisotropy in the Reynolds stresses for both phases and

126
gas fractions for which the ﬂow in the heterogeneous regime. The rise velocity of the bubbles in
the heterogeneous regime is signiﬁcantly higher than the single bubble rise velocity indicating
a co-operative rise of bubbles (reduced drag compare to a single bubble rise).
The length scales computed from the radial distribution function or the cluster size of
the swarm roughly matches the characteristic length scale deﬁned by the rise velocity and the
gravity U2
r /g. The integral length scales computed from the two-point auto-correlation function
is larger compared to the cluster length scales and the deﬁned characteristic length scales.
The energy spectra for streamwise and spanwise components of Reynolds stress indicate
high degree of anisotropy at scales of the order of bubble diameter (dp) for αg −50% compared
to αg −40%.
The momentum budget computed from the simulation indicate that the unclosed term
generated due to PA of drag force is signiﬁcant compared to other unlcosed terms and has to
be modelled in the mean momentum equation to obtain the correct ﬂow prediction in the dense
bubbly ﬂow regime.
The Reynolds stress budget in the liquid phase indicate that turbulence exchange unclosed
terms originated from the PA of drag and the pressure strain terms signiﬁcantly aﬀects the
budget in the streamwise direction for both gas fractions and tends to decrease when the gas
fraction is decreased. However, in the spanwise direction the turbulent excange term due to
buoyacy along with the turbulent exchange term due to Drag and pressure strain seem to
aﬀect the budget and follows the same trend as streamwise direction when the gas fraction is
decreased.
The Reynolds stress budget in the gas phase indicate that turbulence exchange unclosed
terms originated from the PA of drag, buoyancy, virtual mass and the pressure strain terms
signiﬁcantly aﬀects the budget in the streamwise direction for both gas fractions. The turbulent
exchange terms due to buoyancy and virtual mass tends to decrease when the gas fraction is
decreased. However, the turbulent exchange terms due to drag seem to increase with the gas
fraction showing a diﬀerent trend compared to the exchange terms due to buoyancy and virtual
mass.The turbulent exchange terms in the spanwise direction due to the buoyancy along with
the turbulent exchange term due to Drag and pressure strain seem to aﬀect the budget and

127
follows the same trend as streamwise direction when the gas fraction is decreased.
6.3
Multi-phase turbulence model
The turbulent Reynolds stress budgets extracted from the mesoscale DNS is analyzed and a
turbulent Reynolds stress model is proposed to predict turbulent gas-liquid ﬂows. The modeling
strategies involved in modeling the terms quantiﬁed through mesoscale DNS is discussed. The
predictive capability of the proposed model is studied on a 3D bubble column by comparing
it with the mesoscale DNS simulations. The model predictions of the gas fraction and the
velocity proﬁles are in reasonable agreement with the mesoscale DNS. As a further study the
model can be tested for more complex turbulent multiphase ﬂows and multiphase ﬂow systems
