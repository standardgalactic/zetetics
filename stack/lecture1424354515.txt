POWER ELECTRONICS 
The control of electric motor drives requires control of electric power. Power electronics have 
eased the concept of power control. Power electronics signifies the word power electronics 
and control or we can say the electronic that deal with power equipment for power control. 
 
Main power source 
Ref signal 
 
 
 
 
 
Power electronics based on the switching of power semiconductor devices. With the 
development of power semiconductor technology, the power handling capabilities and 
switching speed of power devices have been improved tremendously. 
Power Semiconductor Devices 
The first SCR was developed in late 1957. Power semiconductor devices are broadly 
categorized into 3 types: 
1. Power diodes     (600V,4500A) 
2. Transistors 
3. Thyristors            (10KV,300A,30MW)  
Thyristor is a four layer three junction pnpn semiconductor switching device. It has 3 
terminals these are anode, cathode and gate. SCRs are solid state device, so they are compact, 
possess high reliability and have low loss.

SCR is made up of silicon, it act as a rectifier; it has very low resistance in the forward 
direction and high resistance in the reverse direction. It is a unidirectional device. 
Static V-I characteristics of a Thyristor 
The circuit diagram for obtaining static V-I characteristics is as shown 
 
 
Anode and cathode are connected to main source voltage through the load. The gate and 
cathode are fed from source 𝐸𝑆. 
A typical SCR V-I characteristic is as shown below: 

 
 
𝑉𝐵𝑂=Forward breakover voltage 
𝑉𝐵𝑅=Reverse breakover voltage 
𝐼𝑔=Gate current 
𝑉𝑎=Anode voltage across the thyristor terminal A,K. 
𝐼𝑎=Anode current 
It can be inferred from the static V-I characteristic of SCR. SCR have 3 modes of 
operation: 
1. Reverse blocking mode 
2. Forward blocking mode ( off state) 
3. Forward conduction mode (on state) 
 
1. Reverse Blocking Mode 
When cathode of the thyristor is made positive with respect to anode with switch open 
thyristor is reverse biased. Junctions 𝐽1 and 𝐽2 are reverse biased where junction 𝐽2 is 
forward biased. The device behaves as if two diodes are connected in series with reverse 
voltage applied across them. 
 A small leakage current of the order of few mA only flows. As the thyristor is 
reverse biased and in blocking mode. It is called as acting in reverse blocking 
mode of operation. 
 
 Now if the reverse voltage is increased, at a critical breakdown level called 
reverse breakdown voltage 𝑉𝐵𝑅,an avalanche occurs at 𝐽1 and 𝐽3 and the reverse 

current increases rapidly. As a large current associated with 𝑉𝐵𝑅 and hence more 
losses to the SCR. 
This results in Thyristor damage as junction temperature may exceed its maximum 
temperature rise. 
2. Forward Blocking Mode 
When anode is positive with respect to cathode, with gate circuit open, thyristor is said to 
be forward biased. 
Thus junction 𝐽1 and 𝐽3  are forward biased and 𝐽2  is reverse biased. As the forward 
voltage is increases junction 𝐽2 will have an avalanche breakdown at a voltage called 
forward breakover voltage𝑉𝐵𝑂. When forward voltage is less then 𝑉𝐵𝑂thyristor offers high 
impedance. Thus a thyristor acts as an open switch in forward blocking mode. 
3. Forward Conduction Mode 
     Here thyristor conducts current from anode to cathode with a very small voltage drop 
across it. So a thyristor can be brought from forward blocking mode to forward      
conducting mode: 
1. By exceeding the forward breakover voltage. 
2. By applying a gate pulse between gate and cathode. 
During forward conduction mode of operation thyristor is in on state and behave like a 
close switch. Voltage drop is of the order of 1 to 2mV. This small voltage drop is due to 
ohmic drop across the four layers of the device. 
Different turn ON methods for SCR 
1. Forward voltage triggering 
2. Gate triggering 
3. 
𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑡 triggering 
4. Light triggering 
5. Temperature triggering 
 
1. Forward voltage triggering  
 

 
A forward voltage is applied between anode and cathode with gate circuit open. 
 Junction 𝐽1 and 𝐽3 is forward biased. 
 Juntion 𝐽2 is reverse biased. 
 As the anode to cathode voltage is increased breakdown of the reverse biased junction 
𝐽2 occurs. This is known as avalanche breakdown and the voltage at which this 
phenomena occurs is called forward breakover voltage. 
 The conduction of current continues even if the anode cathode voltage reduces below 
𝑉𝐵𝑂till 𝐼𝑎 will not go below𝐼ℎ. Where 𝐼ℎ is the holding current for the thyristor. 
 
2. Gate  triggering 
This is the simplest, reliable and efficient method of firing the forward biased SCRs. First 
SCR is forward biased. Then a positive gate voltage is applied between gate and cathode. In 
practice the transition from OFF state to ON state by exceeding 𝑉𝐵𝑂 is never employed as it 
may destroy the device. The magnitude of 𝑉𝐵𝑂, so forward breakover voltage is taken as final 
voltage rating of the device during the design of SCR application. 
First step is to choose a thyristor with forward breakover voltage (say 800V) higher than the 
normal working voltage. The benefit is that the thyristor will be in blocking state with normal 
working voltage applied across the anode and cathode with gate open. When we require the 
turning ON of a SCR a positive gate voltage between gate and cathode is applied. The point 
to be noted that cathode n- layer is heavily doped as compared to gate p-layer. So when gate 
supply is given between gate and cathode gate p-layer is flooded with electron from cathode 
n-layer. Now the thyristor is forward biased, so some of these electron reach junction 𝐽2 .As a 
result width of 𝐽2 breaks down or conduction at 𝐽2 occur at a voltage less than 𝑉𝐵𝑂.As 𝐼𝑔 
increases 𝑉𝐵𝑂 reduces which decreases then turn ON time. Another important point is 
duration for which the gate current is applied should be more then turn ON time. This means 

that if the gate current is reduced to zero before the anode current reaches a minimum value 
known as holding current, SCR can’t turn ON. 
In this process power loss is less and also low applied voltage is required for triggering. 
3. dv/dt triggering 
This is a turning ON method but it may lead to destruction of SCR and so it must be avoided. 
 
When SCR is forward biased, junction 𝐽1  and 𝐽3  are forward biased and junction 𝐽2  is 
reversed biased so it behaves as if an insulator is place between two conducting plate. Here 𝐽1 
and 𝐽3 acts as a conducting plate and 𝐽2 acts as an insulator. 𝐽2 is known as junction capacitor. 
So if we increase the rate of change of forward voltage instead of increasing the magnitude of 
voltage. Junction 𝐽2 breaks and starts conducting. A high value of changing current may 
damage the SCR. So SCR may be protected from high
𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑡. 
𝑞= 𝑐𝑣 
𝐼𝑎= 𝑐𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑡 
𝐼𝑎 𝛼 𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑡 
4. Temperature triggering 
During forward biased, 𝐽2 is reverse biased so a leakage forward current always associated 
with SCR. Now as we know the leakage current is temperature dependant, so if we increase 
the temperature the leakage current will also increase and heat dissipitation of junction 
𝐽2occurs. When this heat reaches a sufficient value 𝐽2 will break and conduction starts. 
Disadvantages 

This type of triggering causes local hot spot and may cause thermal run away of the device. 
This triggering cannot be controlled easily. 
It is very costly as protection is costly. 
5. Light triggering 
First a new recess niche is made in the inner p-layer. When this recess is irradiated, then free 
charge carriers (electron and hole) are generated. Now if the intensity is increased above a 
certain value then it leads to turn ON of SCR. Such SCR are known as Light activated SCR 
(LASCR). 
Some definitions: 
Latching current 
The latching current may be defined as the minimum value of anode current which at must 
attain during turn ON process to maintain conduction even if gate signal is removed. 
Holding current 
It is the minimum value of anode current below which if it falls, the SCR will turn OFF. 
Switching characteristics of thyristors 
The time variation of voltage across the thyristor and current through it during turn on 
and turn off process gives the dynamic or switching characteristic of SCR. 
Switching characteristic during turn on 
Turn on time 
It is the time during which it changes from forward blocking state to ON state. Total turn 
on time is divided into 3 intervals: 
1. Delay time 
2. Rise time 
3. Spread time 
Delay time 
If 𝐼𝑔and 𝐼𝑎 represent the final value of gate current and anode current. Then the delay time 
can be explained as time during which the gate current attains 0.9 𝐼𝑔 to the instant anode 
current reaches 0.1 𝐼𝑔 or the anode current rises from forward leakage current to 0.1 𝐼𝑎. 
1. Gate current 0.9 𝐼𝑔 to 0.1 𝐼𝑎. 
2. Anode voltage falls from 𝑉𝑎 to 0.9𝑉𝑎. 
3. Anode current rises from forward leakage current to 0.1 𝐼𝑎. 

 Rise time (𝒕𝒓) 
Time during which  
1. Anode current rises from 0.1 𝐼𝑎 to 0.9 𝐼𝑎 
2. Forward blocking voltage falls from 0.9𝑉𝑎 to 0.1𝑉𝑎. 𝑉𝑎 is the initial forward blocking 
voltage. 
Spread time (𝒕𝒑) 
1. Time taken by the anode current to rise from 0.9𝐼𝑎 to𝐼𝑎. 
2. Time for the forward voltage to fall from 0.1𝑉𝑜 to on state voltage drop of 1 to 1.5V. 
During turn on, SCR is considered to be a charge controlled device. A certain amount 
of charge is injected in the gate region to begin conduction. So higher the magnitude 
of gate current it requires less time to inject the charges. Thus turn on time is reduced 
by using large magnitude of gate current. 
How the distribution of charge occurs? 
As the gate current begins to flow from gate to cathode with the application of gate 
signal. Gate current has a non uniform distribution of current density over the cathode 
surface. Distribution of current density is much higher near the gate. The density decrease 
as the distance from the gate increases. So anode current flows in a narrow region near 
gate where gate current densities are highest. From the beginning of rise time the anode 
current starts spreading itself. The anode current spread at a rate of 0.1mm/sec. The 
spreading anode current requires some time if the rise time is not sufficient then the anode 
current cannot spread over the entire region of cathode. Now a large anode current is 
applied and also a large anode current flowing through the SCR. As a result turn on losses 
is high. As these losses occur over a small conducting region so local hot spots may form 
and it may damage the device. 
Switching Characteristics During Turn Off 
Thyristor turn off means it changed from ON to OFF state. Once thyristor is oON there is 
no role of gate. As we know thyristor can be made turn OFF by reducing the anode 
current below the latching current. Here we assume the latching current to be zero 
ampere. If a forward voltage is applied across the SCR at the moment it reaches zero then 
SCR will not be able to block this forward voltage. Because the charges trapped in the 4-
layer are still favourable for conduction and it may turn on the device. So to avoid such a 
case, SCR is reverse biased for some time even if the anode current has reached to zero. 
So now the turn off time can be different as the instant anode current becomes zero to the 
instant when SCR regains its forward blocking capability. 
𝑡𝑞=𝑡𝑟𝑟+𝑡𝑞𝑟 
Where, 

 𝑡𝑞 is the turn off time,𝑡𝑟𝑟 is the reverse recovery time, 𝑡𝑞𝑟 is the gate recovery time 
At 𝑡1 anode current is zero. Now anode current builds up in reverse direction with same 
𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑡 slope. This is due to the presence of charge carriers in the four layers. The reverse 
recovery current removes the excess carriers from 𝐽1 and 𝐽3 between the instants 𝑡1 and𝑡3. 
At instant 𝑡3 the end junction 𝐽1 and 𝐽3 is recovered. But 𝐽2 still has trapped charges which 
decay due to recombination only so the reverse voltage has to be maintained for some 
more time. The time taken for the recombination of charges between 𝑡3 and 𝑡4 is called 
gate recovery time 𝑡𝑞𝑟. Junction 𝐽2 recovered and now a forward voltage can be applied 
across SCR. 
The turn off time is affected by: 
1. Junction temperature 
2. Magnitude of forward current  
𝑑𝑖
𝑑𝑡 during commutation. 
 Turn off time decreases with the increase of magnitude of reverse applied voltage. 
 
GTO(Gate turn off thyristor) 

A gate turn off thyristor is a pnpn device. In which it can be turned ON like an ordinary SCR 
by a positive gate current. However it can be easily turned off by a negative gate pulse of 
appropriate magnitude. 
    
                     
                       
                         
Conventional SCR are turned on by a positive gate signal but once the SCR is turned on gate 
loses control over it. So to turn it off we require external commutation circuit. These 
commutation circuits are bulky and costly. So due to these drawbacks GTO comes into 
existence. 
The salient features of GTO are: 
1. GTO turned on like conventional SCR and is turned off by a negative gate signal of 
sufficient magnitude. 
2. It is a non latching device. 
3. GTO reduces acoustic and electromagnetic noise. 
It has high switching frequency and efficiency. 
A gate turn off thyristor can turn on like an ordinary thyristor but it is turn off by negative 
gate pulse of appropriate magnitude. 
Disadvantage 
The negative gate current required to turn off a GTO is quite large that is 20% to 30 % of 
anode current 
Advantage  
It is compact and cost less 
Switching performance 

 
1. For turning ON a GTO first TR1is turned on. 
2. This in turn switches on TR2 so that a positive gate current pulse is applied to turn on the 
GTO. 
3. Thyristor 𝑇1 is used to apply a high peak negative gate current pulse. 
 
Gate turn-on characteristics 
 
1. The gate turn on characteristics is similar to a thyristor. Total turn on time consists of 
delay time, rise time, spread time. 
2. The turn on time can be reduced by increasing its forward gate current. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

GATE TURN OFF 
Turn off  time is different for SCR.Turn off characteristics is divied  into 3 pd 
1. Storage time 
2. Fall time 
3. Tail time 
Tq=ts+tf+tt 
At  normal operating  condition  gto  carries a steady state current.The  turn off  process 
starts  as soon as negative  current is applied  after  t=0. 
 
STORAGE  TIME 
During the  storagepd the anode voltage and current remains constant.The gate current rises 
depending upon  the gate circuit impedance and gate applied voltage.The beginning of pd is as soon 
as  negative gate current is applied.The  end  of storage  pd is marked  by fall in anode  current and 
rise in voltage,what we have to do is remove the excess carriers.the excess carriers are removed by 
negative carriers. 

FALL TIME 
After  ts, anode current begins to fall rapidly and anode voltage starts rising.After  falling to a  certain 
value,then anode current changes its rate to  fall.this time is called  fall time. 
SPIKE IN VOLTAGE 
During  the time of storage and fall timethere is achange in voltage due to abrupt current change. 
TAIL TIME 
During this time ,the  anode current and voltage continues towards  the turn off values.The transient  
overshoot is due to the snubber parameter and voltage stabilizes to steady state  value. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
THE  TRIAC 
As  SCR  is a unidirectional device,the conduction  is from anode to cathode and not from 
cathode to anode.  It  conducts in both direction.It is a bidirectional  SCR with three terminal. 
TRIAC=TRIODE+AC 
Here it is considered to be two SCRS connected in anti parallel.As it conducts in both 
direction so it is named as MT1,MT2 and gate G. 
 
SALIENT FEATURES 
1.Bi directional  triode thyristor 
2.TRIAC means triode that works on ac 
3.It conduct in both direction 
4.It  is  a controlled device 

5.Its operation is similar to two devices connected in anti parallel with common gate 
connection. 
6.It has 3 terminals MT1,MT2 and gate G 
Its use is control of power in ac. 
POWER BJT 
Power BJT means a large  voltage blocking in the OFF state and high current carrying capability in the 
ON state. In most power application, base is the input terminal. Emitter is the common terminal. 
Collector is the output terminal. 
 
SIGNAL LEVEL OF BJT                                  
n+  doped emitter layer ,doping of base is more  than collector.Depletion layer exists more towards 
the collector than emitter 
 
 

 
 POWER BJT CONSTRUCTION 
The  maxium  collector emitter voltage that can be sustained across the junction, when it is 
carrying substantial  collector current. 
Vceo=maxium collectorand emitter voltage  that can be sustain by the device. 
Vcbo=collector  base  breakdown voltage with emitter open 
PRIMARY  BREAKDOWN 
It  is due to convention avalanche  breakdown of the C-B junction  and its associated  large  
flow  of current.The  thickness of the depletion region  determines the  breakdown  voltage of  
the transistor.The base  thickness is made as small as possible,in order to have good 
amplification capability. If the thickness is too small, the breakdown voltage is 
compromised.So a compromise  has to be made  between the two. 

THE DOPING LEVELS- 
1.The doping of the emitter layer is quite large. 
2.The base doping is moderate. 
3.n- region is lightly doped. 
4.n+ region doping level is similar to emitter. 
1.THICKNESS OF DRIFT REGION- 
It determines the breakdown  length of the transistor. 
2.THE BASE THICKNES – 
Small  base thickness- good amplification  capability 
Too small base thickness- the breakdown  voltage of the transistor has ti be compromised. 
For  a  relatively thick base,the current gain will be relatively small.so it  is  increase the 
gain.Monolithicesigns   for  darlington connected BJT pair have been deveploed. 
SECONDARY BREAKDOWN 
Secondary breakdown is due to large power disspation at localized site within  the semi 
conductor. 
PHYSICS OF BJT OPERATION- 
The transistor is assumed to operate in active region. There  is no   doped collector drift 
region. It has importance only in switching  operation, in active region of operation. 
B-E junction is forward biased and C-B junction is reverse biased. Electrons are injected  into 
base from the emitter. Holes are injected  from   base into the  emitter. 
QUASI SATURATION- 
 
Intially  we assume that, the transistor is in active region. Base current  is allowed to increase  
then lets see what  happens.first collector  rises in response to  base  current.So there is a  
increase voltage drop across the collector load.So C-E voltage drops. 
Because of increase in collector current, there is a increase in voltage in drift region. This 
eventually  reduces  the  reverse  biased  across  the C-B  junction.so n-p junction  get 
smaller, at some point  the junction become  forward bised. So now injection of holes from 
base into collector  drift region occurs. Charge  neutrality  requires  the electron to be injected 
in the drift region of the  holes. From   where  these  electron  came.   Since  a large  no of  
electron is supplied to the C-B junction via injection from    emitter  and  subsequent  
diffusion  across the  base. As  excess  carrier  build up in the  drift  region  begins  to occur 
quasi  saturation region is  entered. As the  injected carrires  increase in  the drift region  is  

gradually   shotred out and the  voltage   across  the drift region drops. In quasi saturation  the 
drift region is  not  completely  shorted out by  high level injection.Hard  saturation  obtained  
when  excess  carrier  density reaches the n+ side. 
 
During   quasi saturation, the  rate  of the  collector fall.Hard  saturation  occurs  when  excess   
carriers  have  completely  swept   across  the  drift region . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
THYRISTOR PROTECTION 
 
OVER VOLTAGE  PROTECTION 
Over voltage  occurring during  the  switching  operation   causes   the    failure of SCR. 
INTERNAL  OVERVOLTAGE 
It  is   due to  the operating  condition  of  SCR.  

During  the  commutation  of SCR ,when the  anode  current  decays to zero anode current 
reverses due to  stored  changes. First the  reverse  current   rises to peak  value, then  reverse  
current  reduces   abruptly with large 𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑡
⁄
. During    series  inductance  of SCR large  
transient large   voltage i.e 𝐿𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑡
⁄
.   is  generated. 
 
EXTERNAL  OVER VOLTAGE 
This  is due to external supply and load condition. This is because of 
1. The  interruption  of  current   flow  in  an  inductive  circuit. 
2. Lightening   strokes  on  the  lines   feeding  the  thyristor  systems. 
Suppose  a  SCR converter is  fed from a   transformer, voltage  transient  occur   when   
transformer   primary   will  energise   or  de-energised. 
This   overvoltages   cause random turn ON of a SCR. 
The   effect of overvoltage  is  minimized  using   
1. RC circuits 
2. Non  linear  resistor  called  voltage  clamping  device. 
 
Voltage clamping  device  is  a non linear resistor.It is connected  between  
cathode  and  anode  of SCR. The   resistance   of   voltage    clamping  device  
decreases  with  increasing voltages. During  normal  working  condition  Voltage 
clamping (V.C) device   has  high  resistance, drawing only  leakage  current. 
When voltage surge appears voltage clamping device offers a low resistance and it 
create a virtual short circuit across the SCR. Hence  voltage  across  SCR is  
clamped  to  a safe value. 

When   surge  condition over voltage clamping device returns to high resistance 
state. 
e.g. of  voltage clamping  device 
1.Seleniumthyrector  diodes 
2.Metal  Oxide   varistors 
3.Avalanche  diode  supressors 
 
OVER CURRENT  PROTECTION 
Long  duration  operation  of  SCR, during  over current  causes   the 
1.junction  temp.  of SCR  to rise  above  the rated  value,causing  permanent  
damage  to  device. 
SCR  is protected  from  overcurrent by using 
1.Circuit  breakers 
2.Fast  acting  fuses 
Proper  co-ordination  is  essential  because  
1..fault  current   has to be interrupted  before  SCR  gets  damaged. 
2.only  faulty  branches  of  the  network  has to be  replaced. 
In   stiff  supply  network,source  has  negligible   impedance.So  in  such   system  
the   magnitude  and  rate  of rise  of current  is  not  limited.Fault  current hence  
junction  temp  rises  in  a few  miliseconds. 
POINTS  TO BE NOTED- 
1. Proper   coordination  between  fast  acting  fuse and  thyristor  is  essential. 
2. The  fuse  is  always  rated  to carry  marginal  overload  current   over  
definite   period. 
3. The  peak  let through current  through  SCR must  be  less  than  sub cycle  
rating  of  the   SCR. 
4. The   voltage  across  the  fuse  during   arcing  time  is  called    arcing or 
recovery  voltage  and is equal to   sum of the source  voltage and emf  
induced  in the circuit inductance   during arcing time. 
5. On abrupt  interruption  of fuse  current, induce emf   would   be  high, which 
results  in  high  arcing  voltage.   
 
 
Circuit Breaker (C.B) 
C.B.  has  long tripping  time. So it is  used   for  protecting  the  device   against    continuous   
overload  current   or   against  the  surge  current  for  long  duration. In order  that  fuse  
protects  the   thyristor realiably   the 𝐼2𝑡 rating  of  fuse  current  must be less than that of 
SCR. 
ELECTRONIC  CROWBAR  PROTECTION 

For   overcurrent  protection  of  power   converter   using  SCR, electronic   crowbar are  
used. It provide  rapid  isolation  of power  converter before  any  damage    occurs. 
 
HEAT  PROTECTION- 
To   protect   the  SCR  
1. From the local  spots 
2. Temp  rise 
SCRs  are  mounted  over  heat  sinks. 
GATE     PROTECTION- 
 
Gate  circuit  should  also  be  protected  from    
1. Overvoltages 
2. Overcurrents 
Overvoltage  across  the  gate  circuit  causes  the  false  triggering  of SCR 

Overcurrent  raise  the  junction  temperature. Overvoltage  protection  is  by  zener     diode   across   
the     gate  circuit.  
INSULATED  GATE  BIPOLAR  TRANSISTOR(IGBT)- 
      BASIC    CONSTRUCTION- 
The  n+  layer  substrate   at  the  drain   in  the power   MOSFET is substituted  by p+ layer  substrate 
and  called  as  collector. When  gate to emitter  voltage  is positive,n-  channel   is  formed    in  the  
p- region.This n- channel  short  circuit the  n- and n+ layer and  an  electron   movement   in  n 
channel  cause  hole  injection  from p+subtrate  layer  to  n- layer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

POWER  MOSFET 
    A power MOSFET has three terminal  device. Arrow indicates the direction of current 
flow. MOSFET is a voltage controlled device. The operation  of MOSFET  depends on flow 
of majority carriers only.  
 
                                (Circuit diagram)                                                            (circuit symbol) 
Switching Characteristics:- 
The switching characteristic is influenced by   
1. Internal capacitance of the device. 
2. Internal impedance of the gate drive circuit.                           
Total turn on time is divided into 
1.Turn on delay time 
2.Rise time  
    Turn on time is affected by impedance of gate drive source. During turn on delay time gate 
to source voltage attends its threshold value 𝑉𝐺𝑆𝑇. 
     After 𝑡𝑑𝑛 and during rise time gate to source voltage rise to 𝑉𝐺𝑠𝑝,  a voltage which is 
sufficient to drive the MOSFET  to ON state.  
The turn off process is initiated by removing the gate to source voltage. Turn off time is 
composed of turn off delay time to fall time. 
Turn off delay time 

To turn off the MOSFET the input capacitance has to be discharged . During 𝑡𝑑𝑓 the input 
capacitance discharge from 𝑉1to  𝑉𝐺𝑠𝑝.  During 𝑡𝑓 , fall time ,the input capacitance discharges 
from 𝑉𝐺𝑠𝑝 to 𝑉𝐺𝑆𝑇. During 𝑡𝑓 drain current falls from 𝐼𝐷 to zero.  
So when  𝑉𝐺𝑠 ≤ 𝑉𝐺𝑆𝑇 , MOFSET turn off is complete.

 Turn on time 

         Time between the instants forward blocking state to forward on -state . 
Turn on time = Delay time + Rise time  
Delay time = Time for collector emitter voltage fall from 𝑉𝐶𝐸 to 0.9𝑉𝐶𝐸 
 𝑉𝐶𝐸=Initial collector emitter voltage  
𝑡𝑑𝑛=collector current to rise from initial leakage current to 0.1Ic 
Ic= Final value of collector current 
Rise time 
Collector emitter voltage to fall from 0.9𝑉𝐶𝐸 to 0.1𝑉𝐶𝐸. 
0.1Ic  to Ic 
After 𝑡𝑜𝑛 the device is on state the device carries a steady current of Ic and the collector 
emitter voltage falls to a small value called conduction drop 𝑉𝐶𝐸𝑆. 
Turn off time  
1) Delay time 𝑡𝑑𝑓 
2) Initial fall time 𝑡𝑓1 
3)  Final fall time 𝑡𝑓2 
           𝑡𝑂𝑓𝑓 =𝑡𝑑𝑓+ 𝑡𝑓1+ 𝑡𝑓2 
      𝑡𝑑𝑓= Time during which the gate emitter voltage falls to the threshold value  𝑉𝐺𝐸𝑇. 
Collector current falls from Ic to 0.9Ic at the end of the 𝑡𝑑𝑓 collector emitter voltage begins to 
rise. 
Turn off time = Collector current falls from 90% to 20% of its initial value Ic OR The time 
during which collector emitter voltage rise from 𝑉𝐶𝐸 to 0.1𝑉𝐶𝐸.  
 𝑡𝑓2 = collector current falls from20% to 10% of Ic. 
During this collector emitter voltage rise 0.1𝑉𝐶𝐸 to final value of 𝑉𝐶𝐸. 
Series and parallel operation of SCR 
SCR  are connected in series for h.v demand and in parallel for fulfilling high current 
demand. Sting efficiency can be defined as measure of the degree of utilization on SCRs  in a 
string. 
String efficiency  < 1. 
Derating  factor  (DRF)  

 1 –  string efficiency. 
If DRF more then 
no. of SCRs will more,  so string is more reliable. 
Let the rated blocking voltage of the string of a series connected SCR is 2𝑉1 as shown in the 
figure below, But in the string two SCRs are supplied a maximum voltage of 𝑉1+𝑉2. 
    
 
𝜂= 𝑉1 + 𝑉2
2𝑉1
 
Significance of string efficiency . 
Two SCRs are have same forward blocking voltage ,When system voltage is more then the 
voltage rating of a single SCR. SCRs are connected in series in a string. 
There is a inherent variation in characteristics. So voltage  shared  by  each  SCR may not be 
equal. Suppose, SCR1 leakage resistance >  SCR2 leakage resistance. For same leakage 
current 𝐼0  in the series connected SCRs. For same leakage current SCR1 supports a voltage 
𝑉1 , SCR2 supports a voltage 𝑉2, 
So string 𝜂 for two SCRs = 
𝑉1+𝑉2
2𝑉2  = 
1
2(1 +
𝑉2
𝑉1) < 1 . 
 So,                                            𝑉1 > 𝑉2,  
The above operation is when SCRs are not turned ON. But in steady state of operation , A 
uniform voltage distribution in the state can be achieved by connect a suitable resistance 
across each SCRs , so that parallel combination have same resistance. 
 But this is a cumbersome work. During  steady state operation we connect same value of 
shunt resistance across each SCRs. This shunt resistance is called state equalizing circuit. 
Suppose, 

 
  Let SCR1 has lower leakage current  𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑛 , It will block a voltage comparatively larger than 
other SCRs.  
Voltage across  SCR1 is 𝑉𝑏𝑚 =𝐼1𝑅.                                                                                                                       
Voltage across (n-1)SCR is (n-1) 𝐼2R, so the voltage equation for the series circuit is                                     
Vs = 𝐼1𝑅+ (𝑛−1)𝐼2𝑅 = 𝑉𝑏𝑚+ (n-1)R (𝐼−  𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑥 ) 
As  𝐼1 =  𝐼− 𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑛 
   𝐼2= 𝐼−𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑥 
So, Vs = 𝑉𝑏𝑚+ (n-1)R  [𝐼1 −(𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑥− 𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑛)] 
 
If   Δ𝐼𝑏= 𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑥−𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑛 
Then Vs = 𝑉𝑏𝑚+(n-1)R (𝐼1 −Δ𝐼𝑏) 
Vs = 𝑉𝑏𝑚+ (n-1)R 𝐼1-(n-1)R Δ𝐼𝑏 
R𝐼1= 𝑉𝑏𝑚 
So, Vs = 𝑉𝑏𝑚+ (n-1) 𝑉𝑏𝑚 -(n-1)R Δ𝐼𝑏 
            = n 𝑉𝑏𝑚- (n-1)R Δ𝐼𝑏 
    ⇒R = 
𝑛𝑉𝑏𝑚−𝑉𝑆
(n−1)Δ𝐼𝑏 
SCR data sheet usually contain only maximum blocking current , 𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑥 
so we assume   𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑛= 0 
So Δ𝐼𝑏=𝐼𝑏𝑚𝑥 
So the value of R calculated is low than actually required. 
SCRs  having unequal dynamic characteristics: 
 

              It may occur that SCRS may have unequal dynamic characteristics so the voltage 
distribution across the SCR  may be unequal during the transient condition. 
 
  SCR 1 and SCR 2 have different dynamic characteristics. Turn ON time of SCR 2 is more 
than SCR 1 by time  Δ𝑡𝑑 . 
As string voltage is 𝑉𝑆 so voltage shared by each SCRs be 𝑉𝑆/2. Now both are gated at same 
time so SCR 1 will turn ON at  𝑡1 its voltage fall nearly  to zero so the voltage shared by SCR 
2 will be the string voltage if the break over voltage of SCR 2 is less than 𝑉𝑆 then SCR 2 will 
turn ON . 
* In case  𝑉𝑆 is less than the breakoverer voltage, SCR 2 will turn ON at instant 2. SCR 1 
assumed to have less turn off 𝑡𝑞1 time then SCR 2, so 𝑡𝑞1< 𝑡𝑞2 . At 𝑡2 SCR 1 has recovered 
while SCR 2 is developing  recovery voltage at 𝑡1 both are developing different reverse  
recovery 
voltage. 
At  𝑡2 SCR 1 has recovered while SCR2 is developing reverse  recovery voltage . 
Conclusion  : 
         *   Series connected SCR develop different voltages during turn ON and turn OFF 
process. Till now we connect a simple resistor across the diode for static voltage equalizing 
circuit .   
         *  During turn ON and turn OFF capacitance of reverse biased junction determine the 
voltage distribution across  SCRs in a series connected string . As reverse biased  junction 
have different capacitance called self capacitance , the voltage distribution during turn ON 
and turn Off process would be different. 

         *  Under transient condition equal voltage distribution can be achieved by employing 
shunt capacitance as this shunt capacitance has the effect of that the resultant of shunt and 
self capacitance tend to be equal. The capacitor is used to limits the dv/dt across the SCR 
during forward blocking state. When this SCR turned ON capacitor discharges heavy current 
through the SCR . The discharge current spike is limited by damping resistor 𝑅𝑐 .  𝑅𝑐 also 
damps out high frequency oscilation that may arise due to series combination  of 𝑅𝑐 ,C and 
series inductor . 𝑅𝑐 &  C are  called dynamic equalizing circuit  
Diode D is used during forward biased condition for more effective charging of the capacitor. 
During capacitor discharge 𝑅𝑐 comes into action for limiting  current spike and rate of change 
of current di/dt . 
The R, 𝑅𝑐 & C component also provide path to flow reverse recovery current. When one SCR 
regain its voltage blocking capability. The flow of reverse recovery current is necessary as it 
facilitates the turning OFF process of series connected SCR string. So C is necessary for both 
during turn ON and turn OFF process. But the voltage unbalance during turn OFF time is 
more predominant then turn ON time. So choice of C is based  on reverse recovery 
characteristic of SCR  .  
 

                        
 
    SCR 1 has short recovery time as compared to SCR 2. Δ𝑄 is the difference in reverse 
recovery charges of two SCR 1 and  SCR 2. Now we assume the SCR 1 recovers fast .  i.e it 
goes into blocking state so charge Δ𝑄 can pass through C . The voltage induced by 𝑐1 is  
𝛥𝑄/C  , where is no voltage induced across 𝐶2 . 
 The difference in voltage to which the two shunt capacitor are charged is    𝛥𝑄/C . 
                              Now thyristor with least recovery time will share the highest transient 
voltage say  𝑉𝑏𝑚, 
So,                𝑉𝑏𝑚 - 𝑉2 = Δ𝑄/C 
So,                𝑉2= 𝑉𝑏𝑚 - Δ𝑄/C  
 As                𝑉1 = 𝑉𝑏𝑚  
                     𝑉𝑆 = 𝑉1+𝑉2  
                          = 𝑉𝑏𝑚+(𝑉𝑏𝑚 - Δ𝑄/C)  
                      𝑉𝑆 = 2𝑉𝑏𝑚-Δ𝑄/C   
               ⇒

2 (𝑉𝑠+

𝐶) = 𝑉𝑏𝑚 
               ⇒   𝑉2= 𝑉𝑏𝑚 - Δ𝑄/C

2[𝑉𝑠 - Δ𝑄/C] 
Now suppose that there are n series SCRs in a string. 

             Let us assume that if top SCR has similar to characteristic SCR 1. Then SCR 1 would 
support a voltage 𝑉𝑏𝑚  
                        *  If the remaining (n-1)  SCR has characteristic that of SCR 2 .Then SCR 1 
would recover first and support a voltage 𝑉𝑏𝑚 . The charge  (n-1) Δ𝑄 from the remaining (n -
1) SCR would pass through C. 
                       𝑉1 = 𝑉𝑏𝑚  
                        𝑉2 = 𝑉𝑏𝑚 - Δ𝑄/C  
Voltage across (n-1) slow thyristors 
                        𝑉 = (n-1) (𝑉𝑏𝑚 - Δ𝑄/C) 
So,                  𝑉𝑆 =   V1+(n-1) 𝑉2  
                            = 𝑉𝑏𝑚 + (n-1) (𝑉𝑏𝑚 - Δ𝑄/C) 
By simplifing  we get ,                    
                                            𝑉𝑏𝑚 = 
1
𝑛 [𝑉𝑠+(n-1) Δ𝑄/C ] 
                                             C =[ (n-1) Δ𝑄/( n𝑉𝑏𝑚 -𝑉𝑆)  
                                              𝑉2 = (𝑉𝑆 - Δ𝑄/C )/ n  . 
Parallel operation:  
                When current required by the load is more than the rated current of single thyristor , 
SCRs are connected in parallel in a string . 
    
 

For equal sharing of current, SCRs must have same  𝑉−𝐼characteristics during forward 
conduction. 𝑉𝑇 across them must be same. For same 𝑉𝑇 , SCR 1 share 𝐼1and SCR 2 share  I2 . 
If 𝐼1 is the rated current  
                                             𝐼2 <  𝐼1 
The total current  𝐼1+𝐼2 and  not rated current 2𝐼1.Type equation here. 
Thus string efficiency ,

Middle conductor will have more inductance as compared to other two nearby conductor. As 
a result less current flow through the middle conductor. Another method is by  magnetic 
coupling.  
 Thyristor gate characteristics:-  
   
                                                     
  𝑉𝑔 = +ve gate to cathode voltage. 
𝐼𝑔= +ve gate to cathode current. 
As the gate cathode characteristic of a thyrister is a p-n junction, gate characteristic of the 
device is similar to diode. 
                                Curve 1 the lowest voltage value s that must be applied to turn on the 
SCR. 

 Curve 2 highest  possible voltage values that can be safely applied to get circuit. 
     𝑉gm= Maximum limit for gate voltage . 
     𝐼gm= Maximum imilt for gate current. 
     𝑃gav = Rated gate power dissipation for each SCR. 
            These limits should not be crossed in order to avoid the permanent damage of the 
device junction  𝐽3. 
                          OY = Minimum limit of gate voltage to turn ON . 
                          OX = minimum limit of gate current to turn ON. 
     If   𝑉gm, 𝐼gm, 𝑃gav   are exceeded the thyristor will damage so the preferred gate drive area 
of SCR is bcdefghb. 
                          oa = The non triggering gate voltage , If firing circuit generates +ve gate 
signal prior to the desired instant of triggering the SCR.It should be ensured that this un 
wanted signal should be less than the  non –triggering voltage oa. 
  
 
                           𝐸𝑆 = 𝑉𝑔 + 𝐼𝑔𝑅𝑆  
                           𝐸𝑆 =Gate source voltage 
                           𝑉𝑔 = Gate cathode voltage 
                          𝐼𝑔 = Gate current 
                         𝑅𝑆 = Gate source resistance 
                         𝑅𝑆 = The internal resistance of the trigger source 
𝑅1 is connected across the gate cathode terminal, which provides an easy path to the flow of 
leakage current between SCR terminal. If 𝐼𝑔𝑚𝑛 , 𝑉gmn are the minimum gate current and gate 
voltage to turn ON the SCR. 
                                        𝐸𝑆 = (𝐼𝑔𝑚𝑛+ 𝑉gmn/ 𝑅1) 𝑅𝑆 + 𝑉𝑔𝑚𝑛

RECTIFIER  
Rectifier are used to convert A.C to D.C supply.  
Rectifiers can be classified as single phase rectifier and three phase rectifier. Single phase 
rectifier are classified as 1-Փ half wave and 1-Փ full wave rectifier. Three phase rectifier are 
classified as 3-Փ half wave rectifier and 3-Փ full wave rectifier. 1-Փ Full wave rectifier are 
classified as1-Փ mid point type and 1-Փ bridge type rectifier. 1-Փ bridge type rectifier are 
classified as 1-Փ half controlled and 1-Փ full controlled rectifier. 3-Փ full wave rectifier are 
again classified as 3-Փ mid point type and 3-Փ bridge type rectifier. 3-Փ bridge type rectifier 
are again divided as 3-Փ half controlled rectifier and 3-Փ full controlled rectifier.

Output current 𝑖𝑜rises gradually. After some time 𝑖𝑜 reaches a maximum value and then 
begins to decrease. 
At π, 𝑣𝑜=0 but 𝑖𝑜 is not zero because of the load inductance L. After π interval SCR is reverse 
biased but load current is not less then the holding current. 
At β>π, 𝑖𝑜 reduces to zero and SCR is turned off. 
At 2π+β SCR triggers again

CHOPPER 
A chopper is a static device that converts fixed DC input voltage to variable output voltage 
directly. Chopper are mostly used in electric vehicle, mini haulers. 
Chopper are used for speed control and braking. The systems employing chopper offer 
smooth control, high efficiency and have fast response.

The duty cycle α can be varied by varying t₁ , T of frequency. 
Constant frequency operation: 
1)The chopping period T is kept constant and on time is varied. 
The pulse width modulation ,the width of the pulse is varied. 
2) Variable frequency operation, the chopping frequency f is varied. 
Frequency modulation, either on time or off time is kept constant. 
This type of control generate harmonics at unpredictable frequency and filter design is often 
difficult. 
 
TYPES OF CHOPPER: 
FIRST QUADRANT OR TYPE A CHOPPER: 
 
When switch ON 
0
s
V
V

. 

Current i₀ flows in the same direction when switch off. 
V₀=0, i₀=0 
So, average value of both the load and the current are positive. 
SECOND QUADRANT OR TYPE B CHOPPER: 
 
 
When switch are closed the load voltage E drives current through L and switch. During 
on
T  
L stores energy. 
When switch off  
0
V exceeds source voltage 
s
V . 
0
di
V
E
L dt


 
Diode D₂ is forward biased.power is fed back to supply. As V₀is more than sourse voltage. So such 
chopper is called step up chopper. 
0
di
V
E
L dt


 
So current is always negative and V₀ is always positive. 
TWO QUADRANT TYPE A CHOPPER OR, TYPE C CHOPPER: 

 
Both the switches never switch ON simultaneously as it lead direct short circuit of the 
supply. 
Now when sw2 is closed or FD is on the output voltage V₀ is zero. 
When sw1 is ON or diode D conducts output voltage is V₀ is +Vs’ 
CURRENT ANANLYSIS: 
When CH1 is ON current flows along i0. When CH1 is off  current continues to flow along i0 
as FD is forward biased. So i0 is positive. 
Now when CH2 is ON current direction will be opposite to i0. When sw2 is off D2 turns ON. 
Load current is –i0. So average load voltage is always positive. Average load current may be 
positive or negative. 
TWO QUADRANT TYPE B CHOPPER, OR TYPE D CHOPPER: 

 
When CH1 and CH2 both are on then V0=Vs. 
When CH1 and CH2 are off and D1 and D2 are on V 0=-Vs. 
The direction of current is always positive because chopper and diode can only conduct in 
the direction of arrow shown in fig. 
Average voltage is positive when Ton>Toff 
 
 
 
FOUR QUADRANT CHOPPER, OR TYPE E CHOPPER 

 
FIRST QUADRANT: 
CH4 is kept ON 
CH3 is off 
CH1 is operarted 
V0=Vs 
i0 = positive  
when CH1 is off positive current free wheels through CH4,D2 
so V0 and I2 is in first quadrant. 
SECOND QUADRANT: 
CH1,CH3,CH4 are off. 
CH2 is operated. 
Reverse current flows and I is negative through L CH2 D4 and E. 
When CH2 off D1 and D4 is ON and current id fed back to source. So  
di
E
L dt

 is more than source voltage Vs. 
As i0 is negative and V0 is positive, so second quadrant operation. 
THIRD QUADRANT: 
CH1 OFF, CH2 ON  
CH3 operated. So both V0 and i0  is negative. 
When CH3 turned off negative current freewheels through CH2 and D4. 
FOURTH QUADRANT: 

CH4 is operated other are off. 
Positive current flows through CH4 E L D2. 
Inductance L stores energy when current fed to source through D3 and D2.V0 is negative. 
STEADY STATE ANALYSIS OF PRACTICAL BUCK CHOPPER: 
The voltage across the inductor L is ei=Ldi/dt.

INVERTERS

INVERTER 
Inverters are of the two types 
1) VSI 
2) CSI                                                     
Pulse width model 
 
The VSI can be further divided into general 3 categories: 
1.Pulse width modulated inverters 
2.Square wave inverters 
3.Single phase inverter with voltage cancellation 
 

 
Pulse width modulated inverters 
The input dc voltage is of constant magnitude . The diode rectifier is used to rectify the line 
voltage.The inverter control the magnitude and frequency of the ac output voltage. 
This is achieved by PWM technique of inverter switches and this is called PWM inverters. 
The sinusoidal PWM technique is one of the PWM technique to shape the output voltage to 
as close as sinusoidal output. 
Basic concepts of switch mode inverter 
 
 
 

 
 
During interval 1 𝑣0and 𝑖0 both are positive 
During interval 3 𝑣0 and 𝑖0 both are negative 
Therefore during 1 and 3 the instantaneous power flow is from dc side to corresponding to 
inverter mode of operation. 
In contrast during interval 2 and 4 𝑣0 and 𝑖0 are of opposite sign i.e. power flows from ac 
side to dc side corresponding to rectifier mode of operation. 
 
Pulse width modulated switching scheme 
We require the inverter output to be sinusoidal with magnitude and frequency controllable. 
In order to produce sinusoidal output voltage at desired frequency a sinusoidal control 
signal at desired frequency is compared with a triangular waveform as show. 
The frequency of the triangular waveform established the inverter switching frequency. 
The triangular waveform is called carrier waveform. The triangular waveform establishes 
switching frequency 𝑓𝑠 , which establishes with which the inverter switches are applied. 
The control signal has frequency 𝑓𝑠 and is used to modulate the switch duty ratio. 
𝑓1  is the desired fundamental frequency of the output voltage. 
 
The amplitude modulation ratio 𝑚𝑎 is defined as 
 ma=
𝑉𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙
𝑉𝑡𝑟𝑖 

𝑉𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 is the peak amplitude of control signal. 
𝑉𝑡𝑟𝑖 peak amplitude of triangular signal. 
The frequency modulation ratio 𝑚𝑓 
 
mf=
𝑓𝑠
𝑓1 
 
 
 

 
When 𝑉𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙> 𝑉𝑡𝑟𝑖       𝑇𝐴

            𝑉𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙< 𝑉𝑡𝑟𝑖        𝑇𝐴

So the following inferences can be drawn 
The peak amplitude of fundamental frequency is matimes

The foregoing arguments shown why Vcontrolis chosen to be sinusoidal to provide sinusoidal 
output voltage with fewer harmonics 
Let the Vcontrol  vary sinusoidal with frequency f1,which is the desired frequency of the 
inverter output voltage. 
Let Vcontrol=V̂controlsin𝜔1t

Three phase inverter 
When three single-phase inverters are connected in parallel a three phase inverter is 
formed. 
The gating signal has to be displaced by 1200 with respect to each other so as achieve three 
phase balanced voltages. 
A 3-phase output can be achieved from a configuration of six transistors and six diodes. 

Two type of control signal can be applied to transistors, they are such as 1800 or 1200 
conduction. 
180-degree conduction 
 
 
When 𝑄1 is switched on, terminal a is connected to the positive terminal of dc input voltage. 
When 𝑄4 is switched on terminal a is brought to negative terminal of the dc source. 
There are 6 modes of operation is a cycle and the duration of each mode is 600. 
The conduction sequence of transistors is 123,234,345,456,561,612. The gating signals are 
shifted from each other by 600 to get 3-𝜑 balanced voltages.
