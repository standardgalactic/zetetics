“Your project is so easy!” (unnamed colleague) 
 
Me to a student who was looking for a Bachelor thesis project:  
“Do you want me to show you my project as well?”  
The student’s reply: “No, I know your project, it’s boring!”

Acknowledgements 
This first paragraph is in German: Vielen Dank an meine Familie, im Speziellen an meine Eltern. Ihr habt mich 
immer in meinem Leben unterstützt und vor allem meine Ausbildung vorangetrieben. Ihr seid in 
unterschiedlichen Aspekten meines Lebens wichtig, aber in Bezug auf die Promotion hat mein Vater sicherlich 
den größten Einfluss. Du hast mich in diversen Gesprächen vor der Promotion, dazu bringen wollen, diese 
überhaupt erst zu machen, und während dessen hast du mich auf deine Art und Weise antreiben wollen. Das war 
nicht immer leicht für mich, aber ich hoffe, du bist mit dem Endprodukt (das es bis hierhin erstmal ist; ich denke, 
du wirst vermutlich nicht aufhören, mich antreiben zu wollen) zufrieden. Vielen Dank aber auch an meine 
Mutter dafür, eine Art ausgleichenden Gegenpart dazu darzustellen. 
And now in English: Thank you to Prof. Kraume. From the beginning on, I felt the trust you had in me although 
I quickly had to learn that trust is followed by working load. You (often) surprised me with soon to come 
colleagues from somewhere in the world that should work on my project. Mostly, it worked out somehow and, 
although often strenuous, mostly to the best. I also want to thank you for the opportunity to present my work at 
such numerous and diverse conferences around the world. Thank you for your guidance throughout the whole 
project.  
Anja, first of all, thank you for leaving the Chair because that is how I got my job. But actually, I have to start 
earlier: Thanks for trusting me without knowing me too well and getting me in contact with the guys at UNSW 
in Sydney. This was a great experience and, I think, it had a huge impact on me, personally and professionally, 
nonetheless as it was kind of a foundation of our friendship. We had a great time there and it gave me the chance 
to meet most of the ‘big guys’ in MBR research before even knowing who they are. As they still don’t know me, 
I still keep on telling them, whenever I meet them on a conference, that I once served them beer in Australia. 
Since then you have always been an almost always accessible membrane specialist to discuss professional 
matters with and, maybe even more important, a long-term member of the group available to discuss Chair 
internal matters, helping sometimes to put things in the right perspective. Last but not least, thank you for your 
help to improve this thesis.  
I want to thank all colleagues I had, while working at the Chair. I decided to work here because of the 
atmosphere and I was right with my decision. I am lucky to say that a lot of you are not only colleagues but 
friends. Only some can be listed here (sorted alphabetically): Ansor, for the opportunity to do my internship in 
Switzerland, Christoph, for introducing the love-office, Friedemann, for being such a strong personality in the 
group, Helmut, for being Helmut, I never met someone like you, Jochen, for being the surprising personality you 
are, Johannes, I am happy that I once wrote in an Excel file ‘quite okay‘ under your name (special thanks for the 
proof reading), Jörn, my tell-me-more bro, Manuel, for the constant enlargement of your working space, Mirco, 
for being such a professional role-model, Niklas, for being a social life monster and brainiac at the same time 
(special thanks for the proof reading), Sebastian, for being my first boss at the Chair, So-Jin, for being who you 
are, Stefan, for constantly losing the manger game, Subhamoy and Evegenij, for being this unique Indo-Russian 
combination of office mates, Tina, for your styling tips, Ute, for your enduring laugh, no matter what, Vera, for 
giving me the first experience in Powerpoint Karaoke and, finally, Verena, for being a fellow student, colleague 
and friend for such a long time. 
I want to thank Professor Pierre Bérubé for teaching me the EDM (although I cursed the technique sometimes) 
and for giving me the opportunity to work in his group at UBC. Living and working in Vancouver for a few 
months is not the worst thing that happened to me. Additionally, thank you to Jarda (Jaroslav) Tihon and 
Professor Ondrej Wein for your help on enhancing my knowledge of the EDM and your hospitality during my 
visit in Prague. 
During the numerous trips I did, I met important persons who influenced my work and life. Thank you to: 
Steffen Buetehorn, for the great time in Australia and the friendship that followed, Nicolas Ratkovich, for being 
such a nice guy, professionally and personally, and Sepideh Jankhah, for our philosophical discussions as we are 
doing a Doctor of Philosophy (which I am actually not but that didn’t convince you).

Thank you to all the helping hands who are usually more in the background. Nothing would work without you. 
Thanks you to: Andrea, for your sheer interest in my project and your support in making progress, to Rainer, 
Werner and the Azubis, for your enduring dedication to make things work, to Ulla, for keeping bureaucracy 
away from us although you are often exasperated about it, and to Bernd and Gabi, for trying to keep up with all 
the inquiries we have. Finally, although sadly not possible in person anymore, I want to thank Christine, one of 
the good souls at the Chair when I started working here, always dedicated to safety and justice, never afraid to 
stand up for her opinion, now resting in peace in nature as it was her wish. 
I want to thank all students working on my project and I do so chronologically in the following: Alex, for our 
simultaneous EDM learning experience, Tim, for his weekend trips to Berlin to do the LabVIEW programming 
which still works so perfectly smooth that it’s hard to believe, Jan-Paul, for his unbelievable skills in improving 
the hardware and writing a Matlab code making it possible in the first place to handle this huge amount of 
collected data, Nikolay, for his interest he put in the serial tests using EDM and PIV, Eva, for our great 
simultaneous PIV learning experience resulting in such a good thesis that it will be a standard work for almost 
everybody working with PIV at our Chair in the future, Sven, for his effort on the Xanthan solution experiments, 
Kenny, for the enthusiasm he had for the HSC measurements, Paul, for his natural self-dependence in developing 
the HSC analysis up to such a high standard, Tokihiro, for the effort he put into learning to operate the rig in 
such a short time resulting in having his fair share on generating substantial data, Sascha, for having the patience 
on getting the bubble swarm experiments to work and having the endurance to analyze all the data with all the 
‘great’ ideas to incorporate I had like every second day, Juliane, for her enthusiasm on the project and her open-
minded nature and finally Patrick, for his EDM hardware building skills and the really unique bubble swarm-in-
non-Newtonian liquid experiments.  
I also want to use this opportunity to thank my friends for their patience with me. The last years, this job was 
very time-demanding which is why friendships suffered from it. Balancing life and work was not an easy task to 
do. A guilty conscience was my constant companion. Although I am not sure I can keep up to this promise, I 
want to do better in the future. 
Finally, I want to thank the love of my life and mother of our son. Without your patience and understanding, 
especially during the writing period of this thesis, this would not have been possible. Additionally, thank you to 
my son who is still smiling at me, even if I come home late, sometimes even so late that I can only see him 
smiling while he dreams. 
For TnT.

Abstract 
In this thesis, a study of a gas/liquid system in a confining geometry is presented. The project was motivated by 
flat sheet membrane modules used in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Such systems are often operated as air-lift 
loop reactors. These are aerated to induce two-phase crossflows along the membrane surfaces. These crossflows 
reduce the growth of deposition layers on the membrane surface which develop during the filtration process.  It 
would be possible to generate such crossflows as single-phase liquid flows, as well, but bubbles rising together 
with the liquid proved to enhance the cleaning effect. The cleaning effect is based on wall shear stresses due to 
velocity gradients at the wall in the narrow gaps between the membranes. Although aeration is one of the main 
cost factors during the operation of MBRs, a deeper understanding how constructional and operation parameters 
influence the process is not known. For such confining geometries as they are found between two flat sheet 
membranes, neither for single bubbles nor for bubble swarms sufficient literature can be found. Besides the 
specific geometry apparent in flat sheet membrane modules, in MBRs complex compositions of the liquid are 
found, leading to a shear-thinning non-Newtonian rheology. The idea of this thesis is closing the gap of 
knowledge about fluid dynamics in a system taking all the mentioned parameters into account. Single bubble 
experiments were chosen as a fundamental approach to understand the influence of such a system in comparison 
to commonly investigated bubbles rising in unconfined geometries. The parameters channel depth (equal to the 
distance between the membranes), bubble size, superimposed liquid velocity and rheology of the liquid were 
varied in a model system allowing the optical access to the inside of the gap. High speed camera imaging, 
particle image velocimetry and the electrodiffusion method were applied as measurement techniques. This 
allowed the determination of quantities regarding the bubble dynamics, the flow surrounding the bubble and the 
wall shear stress generated by the bubble ascent. While the bubble size, superimposed liquid velocity and 
rheology influenced almost all measured quantities, the channel depths influenced mainly the rise velocity (in 
comparison to freely rising bubbles) and the generated wall shear stress. Especially the identification of the 
influence of the rheology of the liquid phase is important in the field of membrane research. In MBR literature, a 
statement can be found that fluid dynamic findings in water are transferable to real systems. Up to here only for 
single bubbles, this statement cannot be confirmed. For the bubble swarm experiments, the varied parameters 
were again the channel depth and superimposed liquid velocity. Additionally, in contrast to the single bubble 
experiments, the superficial gas velocity was varied and the liquid phase variation was expanded by also testing 
water and the non-Newtonian liquid doped with ions. The ions were added for coalescence hindrance which can 
happen in real systems, as well, as these are complex compositions of diverse materials. High speed camera 
imaging and the electrodiffusion method were applied to measure the gas hold-up and the generated wall shear 
stress. While the channel depth did not significantly influence the gas hold-up, the same is valid for the 
superimposed liquid velocity regarding the wall shear stress. The properties of the liquid phase influenced both 
measured quantities. For the gas hold-up and wall shear stress, correlations were developed taking all varied 
parameters into account. Concluding, it was found that the type of continuous phase used in the fluid dynamic 
measurement does have a significant influence on the measured quantities. With respect to the membrane 
cleaning potential, it can be stated that an increase of the aeration rate does not have a strong enough impact on 
the wall shear stress to justify the additional operating cost resulting from it.

Zusammenfassung 
Diese Arbeit diskutiert die Untersuchung eines Gas/Flüssig-Systems motiviert durch Anwendung von 
Flachmembranmodulen in Membranbioreaktoren (MBR). Solche Systeme werden häufig als Air-Lift-
Schlaufenreaktoren betrieben, deren Belüftung zu einem Cross-Flow entlang der Membranoberflächen führen 
soll. Cross-Flows reduzieren die Ausbildung von Deckschichten auf den Membranen, die sich während der 
Filtration ausbilden. Obwohl es auch möglich wäre, im einphasigen System einen Cross-Flow-Betrieb zu 
realisieren, wird dennoch häufig belüftet, da sich dies als vorteilhaft für den Reinigungsprozess erwiesen hat. 
Dieser Reinigungseffekt kann auf die Wandschubspannungen zurückgeführt werden, die durch die 
Geschwindigkeitsgradienten an den Wänden in den engen Kanäle zwischen den Membranen auftreten. Obwohl 
die Belüftung einen der größten Anteile an den Betriebskosten von MBRs ausmacht, gibt es kein tieferes 
Verständnis, wie Konstruktions- und Betriebsparameter den Reinigungsprozess beeinflussen. Für enge Kanäle, 
wie sie in Flachmembranmodulen auftreten, gibt es weder für den Einzelblasenaufstieg noch für 
Blasenschwärme ausreichend Literatur. Neben der speziellen Geometrie, wie sie in Flachmembranmodulen zu 
finden ist, ist in MBRs auch eine komplex zusammengesetzte Flüssigphase zu finden. Diese Flüssigphase weist 
üblicherweise eine scherverdünnende, nicht-Newtonsche Rheologie auf. Die Grundidee dieser Arbeit ist es, die 
Wissenslücke über die Fluiddynamik in einem solchen System zu schließen und dabei alle benannten Parameter 
in Betracht zu ziehen. Einzelblasenuntersuchungen wurden als grundlegender Ansatz gewählt, um den Einfluss 
der für diesen Fall speziellen Größen im Vergleich zum üblicherweise untersuchten Blasenaufstieg ohne 
Wandeinfluss zu untersuchen. Die Parameter Kanaltiefe (die dem Abstand zwischen den Membranen entspricht), 
Blasengröße, überlagerte Flüssigkeitsgeschwindigkeit und Rheologie der Flüssigphase wurden in einem 
Modellsystem, das den optischen Zugang zum Spalt erlaubt, variiert. Hochgeschwindigkeitskameraaufnahmen, 
Particle Image Velocimetry und die Elektrodiffusionsmethode wurden als Messtechniken angewendet. Dies 
ermöglicht die Ermittlungen der Blasendynamik, der Dynamik der die Blase umgebenden Flüssigkeit und der 
durch 
die 
Blase 
induzierten 
Wandschubspannung. 
Während 
die 
Blasengröße, 
die 
überlagerte 
Flüssigkeitsgeschwindigkeit und die Rheologie der Flüssigphase alle gemessenen Größen beeinflusst, zeigte sich 
der hauptsächliche Einfluss der Kanaltiefe bei den Aufstiegsgeschwindigkeiten (im Vergleich zu frei 
aufsteigenden Blasen) und den Wandschubspannungen. Speziell die Identifikation des Einflusses der Rheologie 
der Flüssigphase ist von Interesse für die Membranforschung. In der MBR Literatur lässt sich die Aussage 
finden, dass fluiddynamische Untersuchungen mit Wasser auf reale Systeme übertragbar sind. Für den 
Einzelblasenaufstieg kann dies nicht bestätigt werden.  
Bei 
den 
Blasenschwarmuntersuchungen 
wurden 
wiederum 
die 
Kanaltiefe 
und 
die 
überlagerte 
Flüssigkeitsgeschwindigkeit variiert. Im Gegensatz zu den Einzelblasenuntersuchungen wurde hier nicht direkt 
die Blasengröße sondern die Gasleerrohrgeschwindigkeit variiert und weitere kontinuierliche Phasen getestet. 
Durch die Zugabe von Ionen sollte ein koaleszenzgehindertes System erzeugt werden, da, wie bereits erwähnt, 
die Flüssigphase im realen System ebenfalls eine komplexe Zusammensetzung diverser Stoffe darstellt. 
Hochgeschwindigkeitskameraaufnahmen und die Elektrodiffusionsmethode wurden angewendet, um den 
Gasgehalt und die Wandschubspannung zu messen. Während im Fall des Gasgehalts die Kanaltiefe keinen 
starken Einfluss hatte, war das gleiche der Fall für den Einfluss der überlagerten Flüssigkeitsgeschwindigkeit auf 
die Wandschubspannung. Die Eigenschaften der Flüssigphase beeinflussten beide gemessenen Größen. Für den 
Gasgehalt und Wandschubspannung wurden jeweils beschreibende Korrelationen entwickelt, die alle variierten 

 
xv 
 
Parameter mit einbeziehen. Zusammenfassend kann gesagt werden, dass die Art der Flüssigphase in diesen 
fluiddynamischen Untersuchungen einen Einfluss auf die gemessenen Größen hat. In Bezug auf das Potential, 
die Membranoberfläche zu reinigen, kann festgestellt werden, dass eine erhöhte Begasungsrate keinen starken 
Einfluss auf die auftretende Wandschubspannung hat und somit nicht die zusätzlichen Betriebskosten 
rechtfertigt.

1 Introduction 
Leonardo da Vinci discussed the spiraling motion of bubbles in water approximately 500 years ago in his Codex 
Leicester [9] which shows that particulate gas bubbles rising in a liquid phase have been a common topic in 
engineering and science for hundreds of years. Looking at published works, such systems are applied in 
chemical, civil, energy, mechanical, nuclear, process and safety engineering, life science, cryogenics, biology, 
chemistry and physics with the goal of all three types of transfer - energy, mass and momentum.  
Globally viewed, a multiphase system is investigated here. In Figure 1.1, a rough overview is given over 
different types of multiphase (here in particular: two-phase) systems, with examples of the related processes and 
facilities. Clift et al. [10] and Chhabra [11] gave a broad overview over the behavior bubbles, drops and particles 
in various systems. Bubbly flows related to energy transfer are often found in pool or convective boiling 
investigations (see, e.g., [12, 13]). Common topics in this field are the bubble nucleation, growth, coalescence, 
heat transfer coefficients and mixing properties. Mass transfer related investigations (see, e.g., [14, 15]) often 
deal with bubble sizes, concentration profiles surrounding the bubble, dispersion and mass transfer coefficients. 
Both heat and mass transfer cannot be uncoupled from momentum transfer. Due to the density difference 
between the two phases, in all (gravitational) cases a momentum transfer between the two phases occurs as the 
bubbles rise in the liquid.  
In the application of interest for this thesis, the filtration of mixed liquor from waste water treatment in a 
submerged flat sheet membrane bioreactor (MBR), actually a three-phase system is found with solid particles in 
 
Figure 1.1: Sorting of particulate two-phase systems into processes and facilities by the respective 
continuous phase (grey boxes are the branches of interest for this thesis, only cases with two different 
phases are shown)

an, often aerated, liquid solution mainly consisting of water. Strictly speaking, in this biological system, not only 
solid particles but also soft matter (e.g., colloids, gel-like macromolecules) appears. For simplicity, in the 
following both are called solid phase. While the solid and liquid phases are the feed supposed to be filtered by 
the system, the third phase - the gas bubbles - is added for other purposes. Depending on the application, the 
intention of aerating the system, is  
 
on the one hand side, the delivery of oxygen ( = mass transfer) from the bubbles to the liquid and then 
from the liquid to the microorganisms, responsible for the digestion of certain compounds in the 
solution (for aerobic processes) and/or  
 
on the other hand, the generation of a liquid (cross) flow, e.g., for the promotion of turbulent eddies 
( = momentum transfer), responsible for membrane fouling mitigation [16].  
This cleaning process which can be applied without stopping the actual operation can reduce external fouling 
such as deposition of solid particles and biopolymer structures on the membrane surface. Its working principle is 
based on the shear forces that move material away from the membrane into the bulk flow due to the velocity 
gradient ( = shear rate) and the respective difference in the dynamic pressure normal to the membrane surface. 
Such systems can be built as an air lift loop reactor (Figure 1.2a), with a stack of flat sheet membranes aerated 
from below and an non-aerated outer part of the module which allows a recirculation of the liquid. Therefore, 
due to the aeration, a cross flow operation is established.  
Although the aeration is one of largest cost factors in the operation of MBR systems [16], commercially 
available (flat sheet) membrane modules are still not optimized, both in terms of construction and operation 
parameters [17]. One of the reasons for this situation is the fact that a deeper understanding of what actually

spacing between the membrane plates and (c) profile of a single bubble and (d) bubble swarm rising in

happens inside of the aerated membrane module during the aeration (and, therefore, cleaning) process is not 
known in detail. This is simply due to the fact that 
 
bubbly flows are generally a complex system to investigate experimentally and theoretically 
 
the given geometry is difficult to access experimentally and 
 
the actual quantity responsible for the cleaning, the wall shear stress acting on the membrane surface, 
cannot easily be determined experimentally (especially the local resolution of the wall shear stress).  
This thesis’ aim is to overcome these challenges by  
 
using model system approaches,  
 
starting the investigation from a fundamental point of view and  
 
increasing the complexity of the investigated system step by step in the attempt to get a deeper 
understanding of the process of interest.

2 State of the art 
Even after decades of MBR research, fouling is still a current topic. A literature search reveals 30 years of 
published research articles with the keyword ‘membrane bioreactor’ (5680 articles) of which 2145 (38 %) deal 
with (membrane or bio-)fouling. Furthermore, 231 of these articles (10 %) discuss fouling control. Several broad 
reviews discussing the topic of fouling in MBRs can be found in the last decade by Cui et al., Drews, Judd, Le-
Clech et al. and, most recently published, Wang et al. and Wibisono et al. [16, 18-22]. Generally, differentiations 
can be made between reversible and irreversible and internal and external fouling [23]. Different fouling 
processes include  
 
the formation of a deposition layer (or filter cake, consisting of particles and/or biomaterial building up 
in a biofilm),  
 
the blockage of pores and  
 
adsorption of material within the pores.  
Most of these types of fouling can be reduced by chemical and physical cleaning but some of these procedures 
are only possible when the actual filtration process is stopped or even when the whole module is taken out of the 
system. 
Counter-measures discussed in the field of fouling mitigation can roughly be sorted by its type (an extensive 
literature review can be found in Drews [19], example references are given here):  
 
construction: (fluid dynamic) improvements of the geometry of system parts (e.g., baffles between the 
membranes [24, 25]), membrane surface conditioning [26]  
 
operation: start-up [27], pre-settling [28], feedback control [29], backflush, relaxation, crossflow, two-
phase flow [18] 
 
additives: flux enhancers for flocculation [30], granules [31], quorum quenching [32], chemical 
cleaning 
Sometimes, the cleaning methods are also limited by the membrane geometry. Regarding flat sheet membrane 
modules, backflushing is actually impossible in most cases, as the separate membrane cushions (stacked in the 
module, Figure 1.2b) inflate during this process which can affect their integrity.  
As mentioned previously, crossflow is the simplest cleaning method that can be established during operation. 
This fluid dynamic approach is based on the forces acting on the deposition layer on the membrane surface due 
to flow [33]. Figure 2.1 illustrates the forces acting on a particle near the membrane. Due to the actual filtration, 
a drag force Fdrag 
𝐹𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑔= 3𝜋𝜇𝐿𝑑𝑃𝐽 
(2.1) 
(with μL as the liquid viscosity in Pas, dP as the particle diameter and J as the flux in L/(hm²)) is moving the 
particle into the direction of the membrane surface. This force can be controlled by the set flux (volumetric flow 
rate through the membrane per membrane area) during the filtration. The force potentially moving the particle 
away from the membrane is the lift force Flift 
𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑓𝑡= 0.761 𝜏1.5𝑑𝑃
3𝜌0.5
𝜇
 
(2.2) 

 
 
5 
 
with τ as the shear stress in Pa and ρ as the density of the liquid in kg/m³. This force can be controlled by the 
velocity gradient at the wall which is equal to the shear rate and proportional to the shear stress. Whenever the 
lift force is larger than the drag force, the particle with the according diameter will be removed from the 
membrane surface.  
Only 151 (7 %) of the aforementioned articles about fouling discuss hydrodynamics (see also Table 2.1 for an 
overview). Topics are, inter alia, critical particle diameters for deposition (diameter > 1 mm being removed by 
hydrodynamics, below < 0.1 μm by molecular diffusion [34]), positive effects of fluctuating flows on the 
detachment of biofilms [35] and negative effects of the shear stress (high shear forces leading to a predominant 
deposition of small particles which in turn leads to denser deposition layers [20]). Regarding the biofilm, several 
authors investigated the influence of shear stress on biofilms and found, e.g., an influence of the shear stress on 
the biofilm composition [36], on the release of fouling-promoting substances [19] and an influence of the shear 
stress fluctuations on the detachment of biofilms [35]. 
Basically, a crossflow can also be generated without gas, e.g., by a pump in a side stream MBR [37]. If the 
crossflow is generated by aeration in an air-lift loop reactor, bubbles rise together with the liquid/solid 
suspension between the membrane plates which proved to have a significant enhancing effect on the cleaning 
process. This can be confirmed by transmembrane pressure (TMP) measurements in constant flux experiments 
[18, 24]. Besides the actual crossflow, the enhancing effect is based on a stronger liquid flow fluctuation or 
induced eddies, respectively. Additionally, higher shear forces occur due to thin liquid films between the bubble 
surface and the membrane or deposition layer, respectively. Still, a deeper understanding of this cleaning process 
with a three-phase cross flow operation is not existent. This is noteworthy as the aeration of submerged MBRs is 
responsible for 40 to 70 % of their energy demand [16, 38] and has been shown to be optimally used only 10 %

of the time [19]. Still, recent approaches have been made to improve the efficiency of this cleaning procedure. 
One operational approach is to apply a pulsating aeration [39-42] which also has already been applied in 
commercial products as, e.g., the GE LEAPmbr hollow fiber membrane system is operated with an Intelligent 
Aeration Control (IAC) [43, 44]. 
Looking at construction and operation parameters of commercially available flat sheet membrane modules for 
waste water treatment [17], it can be concluded that no optimum has been found yet. The membrane spacing 
ranges from 6 mm to 10 mm and the aeration is suggested to be done with fine or coarse bubbles at superficial 
gas velocities from 1.25∙10-2 m/s to 7.6∙10-2 m/s.  
Evaluating publications not related to membrane systems, neither fundamental single bubble (Figure 1.2c) nor 
bubble swarm investigations (Figure 1.2d) can be found in geometries comparable to MBRs with a variation of 
parameters of specific interest for membrane research. In spite of this fact, the investigations most comparable to 
this study are summarized in Table 2.2 and Table 2.3 for single bubbles and in Table 2.4 for bubble swarms. 
Taking a look at the fluid dynamic research done in this field [1], usually no general recommendations were 
given as most groups only varied one parameter or the other and only analyzed one quantity or the other. 
Common shortcomings are: 
 
Too small flow channel dimensions:  
Setup heights (see Figure 1.2b) below approximately 500 mm can be regarded as too small. Real setups 
are usually larger than this and the flow cannot fully develop; channel depths below 3 mm and above 
11 mm are not of industrial interest as channels with a too small depth tend to block and at too large 
channel depths the membrane area per volume ( = packing density) would be fairly small. 
 
The use of water as the continuous phase:  
Actually, most fluid dynamic investigations in this field used water (in parts doped with ions) as the 
continuous phase [1]. In their review on activated sludge rheology, Ratkovich et al. [45] discussed that 
usually in MBR systems, a non-Newtonian rheology is found. Still, Ozaki and Yamamoto [46] stated 
that results found in water are transferrable to waste water systems despite the Newtonian characteristic 
of water. This is surprising, as the viscosity of activated sludge does not only have a shear-thinning 
character but is generally higher than that of water. Their statement was based on a difference of the 
viscosity of water and activated sludge of only 10 %. Besides the rheology, activated sludge is actually 
a complex composition of liquors and ions which affect the interfacial tension between gas and liquid 
and the coalescence behavior of the bubbles. This has to be especially considered for the bubble swarm 
behavior. 
 
The application of only one measurement technique: 
Most groups showed only results gained with one measurement technique either measuring, e.g., the 
occurring shear stress or the quantities of the liquid surrounding the bubble (like, e.g., the flow field 
around the bubble) and so on. To get a fundamental understanding, the application of other 
measurement techniques is beneficial and it also helps to show the comparability of systems of different 
groups. 
 
The variation of only a few parameters: 
To be able to give advice on the improvement of MBR systems, as many parameters as possible should 
be covered as most of these interact. 

 
 
7 
 
Three groups are worth mentioning in the field of flat sheet systems as they covered most of the shortcomings.  
Gaucher et al. [47-51] did a broad investigation with the electrodiffusion method (EDM) and particle image 
velocimetry (PIV), even including the actual filtration, but their channel height was very low with 122 mm and 
they only used water (in parts doped with ions) as the continuous phase. They tested the influence of distributor 
types on the spatial distribution of the wall shear stress over the membrane area. They found an influence of 
1. the ratio of the inlet to mean gas velocity on the wall shear stress and determined average wall shear 
stresses up to 10 Pa (local maximum values up to 50 Pa) and 
2. the suction towards the membrane surface when the filtration was switched on which increased the wall 
shear stress by a factor of up to 2.5 and evened out the spatial distribution of the wall shear stress while 
dampening the fluctuations. 
Cabassud’s group [52-54] applied EDM, high speed camera imaging (HSC) and computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD), in parts for single bubbles as well, but also used a very low channel height of 147 mm, varied only a few 
parameters and only used water (in parts doped with ions) as the continuous phase. They did not give actual wall 
shear stress values but rather ratios:  
1. They defined the ratio, average wall shear stress generated by a two phase flow over wall shear stress 
generated by a single phase flow. For this ratio they found values up to 4 which increased the flux (for 
constant transmembrane pressure experiments) in comparison to the case without air sparging by a 
factor of up 1.7. 
2. In addition, they defined the ratio, difference between maximum and minimum wall shear stress 
generated by two phase flow over the wall shear stress generated by a single phase flow. This ratio 
takes the fluctuations of the wall shear stress into account and values up to 40 were found. The 
enhancing effect on the flux performance was the same as discussed for the first ratio. 
Regarding the bubble swarm experiments, Yamanoi and Kageyama [55] are the closest to this investigation, 
applying a shear stress measurement method (shear stress scale, SSS) and HSC but, again, they only used water 
as the continuous phase and they did not control an important influencing parameter: the co-current liquid 
velocity. Among their findings was: 
1. The average wall shear stress increases with the superficial gas velocity with values up to 1.5 Pa.  
2. The average wall shear stress is strongly affected by the appearing bubble size, with bubbles larger by a 
factor of 3 to 4 leading to higher average wall shear stresses by a factor of approximately 2. 
3. For the wall shear stress generated by a two phase flow, the average value and the respective standard 
deviation (where the later one represents the bubble swarm induced fluctuations) are equal. 
With all the assembled knowledge, e.g., Wang et al. still came to the conclusion, that cleaning protocols still 
have to be optimized and to some extent they have to be specifically adjusted to the respective application [21].

3 Scope and outline of this thesis 
As mentioned before, most investigations in the field of fluid dynamic fouling mitigation have certain deficits. 
This thesis is the first work in this field to combine fundamental investigations of single bubbles (SB, Figure 
1.2c) with the bubble swarm behavior (BS, Figure 1.2d) under the same conditions with a systematic, broad 
variation of parameters influencing the fluid dynamics of flat sheet MBRs.  
The varied parameters were (see Table 3.1 for an overview): 
 
channel depth dc ( = membrane spacing) 
Small channel depths are beneficial for the packing density but in most cases such channels tend to 
block (as a development of a deposition layer cannot be avoided completely). In commercial products, a 
range of 6 mm < dc < 11 mm can be found. CFD simulations of single bubbles rising in channels with 
rectangular cross section showed high shear stress values for the 5 mm channel [17]. Therefore, in this 
thesis, channel depths of 3 mm, 5 mm and 7 mm were tested. The 3 mm channel is rather of academic 
interest due to the reasons mentioned before. 
 
in case of the single bubble experiments (SB): bubble size dB 
The bubble size was varied in a range that was assumed for fine bubble aeration (3 mm < dB < 9 mm) as 
recommended by certain suppliers of flat sheet membrane modules. The bubble size used in this thesis 
is the diameter of a spherical bubble with a volume equal to the injected gas volume. For many 
parameter combinations, the generation of larger stable single bubbles was not possible as the entrance 
into the confining flow channel and/or flow conditions led to a breakage of the large bubble into smaller 
daughter bubbles. The bubble swarm experiments revealed that larger bubbles, evolving due to 
coalescence in the channel, can be stable. 
 
in case of bubble swarm experiments (BS): volumetric gas flow rate Qg 
Several different values are used in membrane applications to express gas flow. The superficial gas 
velocity vg (in m/s) and the gas flow rate Qg (in m³/h) are common quantities for such experiments 
independent of the research field. Additionally, gas flows can be given as gas flow rate per membrane 
area SADm (specific aeration demand, in m³/(m²h)) or gas flow rate per membrane area and permeate 
flow SADp (in m³/m³) [1]. Based on the SADm recommended for commercial products by their suppliers 
(0.3 m³/(m²h) < SADm < 1.28 m³/(m²h)) [17], a gas flow rate range of 0.1 m³/h < Qg < 0.6 m³/h was 
chosen for this work. The SADm was chosen as basic value as it is independent of the channel depth and 
in contrast to, e.g., the superficial gas velocity also given by Prieske et al. [17], it can be specifically 
calculated for the investigated system. In case of the superficial gas velocity, it is not clear if it is the gas 
flow rate related to the free area between the membranes or, e.g., the free area above the aerator and 
below the actual membrane module (riser section).  
 
superficial co-current liquid velocity vL 
Some groups took the co-current liquid velocity (also called superimposed liquid velocity) into account 
but did not vary it or did not control it. Prieske et al. [17] discussed influencing factors on the co-current 
liquid velocity in flat sheet membrane air lift loop reactors. As the self-establishing co-current liquid 
velocity is a function of various influencing factors such as, e.g., the tank and module geometry, it is 

3 Scope and outline of this thesis 
 
22 
 
reasonable to rather control the liquid velocity in a range of interest (0 m/s < vL < 0.2 m/s) than let the 
liquid velocity be self-established in an experimental facility that has no overall relation to a real 
system. 
 
physical properties of the continuous phase 
By using different continuous phases with Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheology and adding 
surfactants with other things being equal, the influence of the different characteristics can be quantified 
and Ozaki and Yamamoto’s statement of the transferability of results found in water to real systems can 
be tested [46]. In contrast to the real activated sludge found in membrane bioreactors, here, model 
solutions were used which was a necessity for the applied measurement techniques. This led to the 
application of four different types of continuous phases (water [4, 6, 8], water with ions [2, 3, 5, 8], 
shear-thinning non-Newtonian Xanthan solution [6-8], shear-thinning non-Newtonian Xanthan solution 
with ions [8]). In contrast to the real three-phase system, in most cases no solid particles were added to 
the liquid, making it a two-phase system with liquid as the continuous phase (see respective grey boxes 
in Figure 1.1). Only the PIV measurements were done in a three-phase system, as particles are 
necessary for the measurement technique. Therefore, the two continuous phases, water with particles [2, 
7] and Xanthan solution with particles [7], were only used for the PIV measurements. As the particles 
did not have an effect on the system (discussed in Section 4.2), these cases can be regarded as similar to 
the experiments without particles.

The applied measurement techniques were: 
 
high speed camera imaging (HSC, sometimes also called direct observation DO) [4, 6, 8] for the 
determination of the bubble rising behavior including rise velocity, rising path, bubble shape, etc. 
 
particle image velocimetry (PIV) [2, 7] analyzing the influence of the bubble on the surrounding liquid 
 
electrodiffusion method (EDM) [2, 3, 5, 8] providing the bubble induced wall shear stress 
The results were in parts used to validate CFD simulations [17]. Table 3.2 illustrates that, actually, CFD 
simulations would be the most powerful tool to do a comprehensive investigation of the system of interest. 
Potentially, every desired quantity could be studied in detail, locally and time resolved. On the downside, CFD 
simulations are no analytical solutions of the physical process. The mathematical problem has to be treated 
numerically with a solver for partial differential equation systems (which itself already leads to an error) and 
many complex physical processes have to be described by - more or less - simplifying models. Examples for 
models necessary in this investigation would be a multiphase model, a rheological model describing the non-
Newtonian behavior, a turbulence model and, in case of the bubble swarm, a coalescence and breakage model. 
Böhm et al. [1] discussed CFD approaches from several working groups motivated by MBR systems. In most 
cases, a Newtonian continuous phase was chosen and, especially in case of bubble swarm simulations, usually 
multiphase models were chosen which do not resolve the two phases locally. Although only shortly discussed 
here, this already corroborates that such complex system simulations always have to be validated by 
experimental work. Still, as Table 3.2 indicates, none of the measurement technique used here can cover all 
quantities of interest. The mentioned study by Prieske et al. [17] covered the CFD simulation of the single

bubble ascent in a confining geometry. Here, it was still possible with a reasonable computational effort to gain a 
sufficient spatial and temporal resolution of this process. Therefore, these results can be used for comparison 
with the experimental single bubble results in this thesis. For the experimental bubble swarm results presented 
here, no comparable CFD study is at hand.

systems [1] (in extracts in Section 2), a fundamental investigation of this multi-phase system is made. In the 
following, the material and methods are discussed. These include the experimental set-ups (Section 4.1) and the 
material properties of the used continuous phases (Section 4.2). The three different measurement techniques are 
explained as well (Sections 4.3 to 4.5), especially with respect to the way the respective data is analyzed. Going 
into more detail, for the electrodiffusion method, a fundamental literature review [5] was co-authored by the 
author of this thesis. It discusses 50 years of theory and application of the technique and recent developments. 
The results and discussion part is divided into the single bubble (Section 5.1) and bubble swarm experiments 
(Section 5.2). It starts with the analysis of the single bubble behavior, then is moving to its interaction with the 
surrounding liquid and finally is discussing the wall shear stress generated by the bubble induced liquid flow. 
Where applicable, the results are compared to literature and if possible cross-links are drawn for the results 
gained in this thesis. After a conclusion of the single bubble results, the bubble swarm results are presented. The 
general flow behavior, including the gas hold-ups, and the wall shear stress generated by the bubble swarm 
induced liquid flow are considered. Both quantities are again related to literature and correlations are given, 
describing the respective quantity in dependence of all varied parameters. Based on all the assembled 
information, engineering recommendations (Section 5.3) are given for flat sheet membrane modules. Finally, the 
work is concluded and an outlook is given (Section 6). 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Here and in the following text, boxed paragraphs show intermediate conclusions: 
Concluding the motivation of this work up to here, as indicated in Section 1, the common challenges in this 
field of research are complex (flow) systems, poor accessibility and the hard-to-determine quantity of interest. 
With the approach chosen here, a deeper understanding of the real systems is the aim. The rather academic 
approach of investigating the single bubble ascent before looking at the complex multiple bubble system is not 
supposed to be of sole fundamental interest without relation to the actual application. By comparing results of 
these cases, conclusions can be drawn for future investigations if results from one type of test can be transferred 
to the other one. 
Besides the determination of the influence of each individual parameter, it is of great interest for the 
motivational system if, e.g., different liquid viscosities lead to differing recommendations for the operation and 
construction of flat sheet membrane modules.

4 Materials and methods 
4.1 The experimental set-up 
Several features were demanded of the ideal experimental set-up: 
 
as many as possible geometrical and operational parameter variations should be performed in one set-up 
 
usability for single bubble and bubble swarm experiments 
 
fully automated operation for serial examinations 
 
visual accessibility from all sides of the flow channel for the HSC and PIV investigations 
 
(removable) EDM sensor installation flush with the wall 
 
no metal parts in contact with the continuous phase (necessity for the EDM measurements) 
 
low overall liquid hold-up (as the EDM solution had to be separately disposed) 
Not all requirements could be achieved (e.g., a variable channel depth and optical accessibility in the same flow 
channel). Therefore, a modular construction was chosen fulfilling most of the requirements. For the different 
measurements, individual, respective parts of it were varied. The basic components were the flow channel, a 
bubble injector system, a gas/liquid separator, a receiving tank for the continuous phase and a liquid pump for 
the generation of the co-current liquid flow (specific descriptions in the respective articles [2-8], see Figure 3.1). 
For the single bubble EDM measurements [2, 3], one flow channel was used for which the channel depths could 
be adjusted by inserting polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plates (Figure 4.1a). The number of inserted PVC plates, each 
with a thickness of 1 mm, defined the free spacing for the bubble ascent. Additionally, an acrylic glass plate had 
to be inserted in which the EDM sensors were installed. These tests were the only ones where a channel depth of 
3 mm was tested. For all other experiments, two channels were used, each with a fixed, defined channel depth of 
5 and 7 mm, respectively (Figure 4.1b). In all cases, the channel width dw ( = x-direction) was dw = 0.16 m 
which is more than a magnitude larger than the largest tested bubble size making an influence of the side walls 
on the bubble ascent negligible.  
For the single bubble measurements, a 50 mL Hamilton GasTight syringe was used to generate bubbles of 
defined volumes corresponding to defined bubble diameters. The syringe was fixed on a Harvard Apparatus 11 
Elite syringe pump. The gas was led through a polytetrafluouroethylene (PTFE) tube and a two-way-valve 
through a custom-built polyether ether ketone (PEEK) needle, inserted through a septum, into the flow channel. 
In the flow channel itself, the gas was collected in a bubble cup. Once the inserted gas coalesced to one bubble of 
the desired size, the bubble was released by turning the bubble cup with the help of a servomotor located outside 
of the channel and connected to the cup with a rotatable rod. Due to the deformation of the bubble, a control of 
the single bubble size based on recorded images was not possible. A repeatedly performed test was done where a 
defined number of bubbles ( ~ 50) with a defined size was collected at the outlet of the flow channel and the total 
gas volume was compared to the expected total volume of the respective number of single bubbles. This test only 
gave information about the average single bubble size of the collected bubbles but the differences between the 
collected and expected gas volumes were minimal (in the single-digit percentage range). This actual minimal 
difference could also be explained with the expansion of the bubble during its ascent. Assuming the ideal gas law 
is valid:

(with VB as the bubble volume in m³, M as the mass in kg, R as the specific gas constant in J/(kgK), T as the 
temperature in K and p as the pressure in Pa). The pressure difference Δp between bubble cup and gas separator 
is a function of the hydrostatic head (assuming the pressure loss caused by the liquid flow is negligible) as 
described by

(with ρf as the liquid density in kg/m³, g as the gravitational constant in m/s² and ΔH as the liquid height in m).

would change by a factor of 1.151/3 = 1.05. This increase in the bubble diameter during its ascent of 5 % is 
neglected in the following discussion, especially as the point for all measurement techniques was roughly half 
way between the inlet and the outlet reducing the error to 2.4 %. 
For the bubble swarm experiments, the flange with the servomotor, bubble cup on the rotatable rod and the 
septum was replaced by a flange which contained the aerator. For this, a PVC pipe with 15 holes ranging over 
the whole width of the channel was used. In case of the gas hold-up measurements, the holes had a diameter of 
1 mm and in case of the EDM measurements, the diameter was decreased to 0.7 mm. This was due to the fact 
that for some low gas flow rates in the non-Newtonian viscosity systems, the aeration was not uniformly 
distributed over the length of the aerator in case of the larger sparging holes. This was the case although the 
criteria for uniform aeration introduced by Mersmann [130] depending on a hole Weber number was fulfilled but 
this relationship was found for the aeration in Newtonian liquids and might not be applicable here. The aerator 
was fed by the pressurized air supplied by the in-house compressor. It was led through an air filter, a manometer, 
a Krohne DK46-800 flow meter and another manometer. The manometers were necessary to calculate the actual 
net volume gas flow from the scale of the flow meter with the help of the Krohne KROVASYS 4 software. Due 
to fluctuations mainly caused by fluctuating pressures in the aerated flow channel  (as the hydrostatic head of the 
two-phase mixture in the channel is subject of fluctuations), the gas flow rate was set with an accuracy of 
approximately ±10 %.

The liquid flow, generated by a Stübbe SMB50 centrifugal pump, was measured with a Honsberg flow 
transmitter Rototron RRO-025 rotor flow meter calibrated for water in a range between 0 and 1000 L/h. For the 
Xanthan solution, due to the differing rheological characteristic in comparison to water, a separate calibration 
was done for the flow meter. The results of the test are shown in Figure 4.2. Based on these results, the 
volumetric flow rate of the Xanthan solution had to be set respective to

(4.4) 
(with Qf,set as the set and indicated and Qf,real as the actual, real volumetric liquid flow rate in L/h).  
The whole system was controlled with National Instruments LabVIEW (several versions starting from 2010, in 
the following only called LabVIEW). The process and instrumentation flow sheets for the single bubble and 
bubble swarm experiments are shown in Figure 4.3a and Figure 4.3b, respectively.  
For the single bubble experiments, the whole process of  
 
injecting a defined gas volume,  
 
turning the bubble cup to release the bubble, 
 
returning the bubble cup to its initial position,  
 
all with a defined co-current liquid flow, 
was controlled with LabVIEW. For the EDM (for which the flow sheet is shown in Figure 4.3a) and PIV 
measurements, the recording of the experimental data was included in the LabVIEW control either by directly 
recording the data (EDM) or sending out trigger signals to an external computer (PIV). The HSC data recording 
was started by hand. In bubble swarm experiments, the gas flow rate was set by hand and all data recordings 
(HSC/EDM) were started manually. 
4.2 The continuous phases 
As mentioned in Section 2, most fluid dynamic investigations in MBRs were carried out in water. In parts, this 
was done based on Ozaki and Yamamoto’s conclusion that findings from fluid dynamic investigations made 
with water as the continuous phase can be transferred to real activated sludge systems [46]. This statement was 
based on a difference of the viscosity of 10 % between water and activated sludge ignoring the rheological 
characteristic of the sludge. Among other things, based on this statement, the continuous phases (without solids 
as apparent in waste water sludge) were chosen for this investigation with 
 
water as the reference system (here: deionized water), 
 
a non-Newtonian model solution, with rheological flow behavior representative for an ‘average’ MBR 
sludge and 
 
water and a non-Newtonian model solution each containing ions, as an approach to the complex 
composition of the mixed liquor in real MBRs. 
Ratkovich et al. [45] and Rosenberger et al. [131] discussed the rheological behavior of activated sludge. Besides 
a different rheological behavior, higher values of the viscosity were found by Rosenberger et al. than mentioned 
by Ozaki and Yamamoto. Based on the Ostwald-de-Waele approach  
𝜇= 𝐾𝛾𝑛−1 
(4.5) 

4.2 The continuous phases 
 
31 
 
(with the flow consistency index K in Pasn, the shear rate γ in s-1 and the flow behavior index n), Rosenberger et 
al. gave an equation which correlates the apparent viscosity μ with the concentration of the mixed liquor 
suspended solids (MLSS) in the activated sludge described by: 
𝜇= 𝑒𝑥𝑝(1.9 𝑀𝐿𝑆𝑆0.43)𝑚𝑃𝑎𝑠−0.22 𝑀𝐿𝑆𝑆0.37−1𝛾−0.22 𝑀𝐿𝑆𝑆0.37      (μ in mPas, MLSS in g/L) 
(4.6) 
With respect to the different systems investigated by Rosenberger et al. (municipal, various industrial waste 
waters, molasses), an MLSS concentration of 10 g/L is a typical value in the determined range of 2.7 g/L up to 
55 g/L. Therefore, in this investigation, a rheology of an activated sludge with an MLSS concentration of 10 g/L 
was chosen as a typical mean value, i.e.: 
𝜇(𝑐𝑀𝐿𝑆𝑆= 10 𝑔/𝐿) = 166𝑚𝑃𝑎𝑠0.48𝛾−0.52 
(4.7) 
Higher MLSS concentrations lead to higher flow consistency indices lifting the general viscosity level but also 
enhance the reducing effect with increasing shear rate by lifting the flow behavior index. In Figure 4.4, the 
viscosity as calculated from eq. (4.7) is given as a function of the shear rate. For the whole plotted shear rate 
range which is realistic for an aerated system (as discussed, e.g., in [8]), the viscosity of the activated sludge is 
higher by a factor of at least 4, up to a factor of approximately 150 in comparison to the viscosity of water. Ozaki 
and Yamamoto investigated activated sludge with MLSS concentrations of 0.8 to 6 g/L. Although only valid 
above an MLSS concentration of 2.7 g/L, based on the correlation by Rosenberger et al., even for the lowest 
MLSS concentration of 0.8 g/L, this leads to a higher viscosity in comparison to water with a factor of 1.4 up to 
5.6 (see Figure 4.4). Without even discussing fluid dynamic results up to this point, it can be stated that even for 
the MLSS concentration of 2 to 3 g/L which were the basis for Ozaki and Yamamoto’s statement, the general 
validity of their assumption can be doubted. 
As transparent solutions were necessary for most of the measurement techniques, activated sludge could not be 
used. Instead, a Xanthan gum solution (in the following called Xanthan solution) consisting of deionized water 
 
Figure 4.4: Apparent viscosity of the waters and different Xanthan solutions against the shear rate and of 
activated MBR sludge based on the correlation by Rosenberger et al. [131] 

4 Materials and methods 
 
32 
 
and 0.8 g/L Xanthan gum TER2000 (supplied by Colltec GmbH) was used. This kind of solution is transparent 
but shows a comparable rheological behavior to activated sludge. The rheology of the solution was measured in 
the laboratory with an Anton Paar RheolabQC rather in the beginning of the investigation (2011) and with an 
Anton Paar MCR302 at the end (2014). In the earlier tests, a solution of 0.8 g/L Xanthan gum in deionized water 
showed a very good fit to the respective activated sludge with 10 g/L MLSS (see eq.(4.7)) with a behavior 
described by: 
𝜇(𝑐𝑋𝑎𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛= 0.8 𝑔/𝐿) = 173𝑚𝑃𝑎𝑠0.47𝛾−0.53 
(4.8) 
The recent tests revealed changed K and n values respective to 
𝜇(𝑐𝑋𝑎𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛= 0.8 𝑔/𝐿) = 238𝑚𝑃𝑎𝑠0.42𝛾−0.58. 
(4.9) 
This is closer to an activated sludge with an MLSS concentration of 11.6 g/L with  
𝜇(𝑐𝑀𝐿𝑆𝑆= 11.6 𝑔/𝐿) = 236𝑚𝑃𝑎𝑠0.45𝛾−0.55. 
(4.10) 
Over the whole tested shear rate range, this makes an average difference of 20 % between the old and the new 
measurement. The change of the rheological behavior of the Xanthan solution can be designated to several 
reasons. The main reason is that the Xanthan gum itself is a biological product which can have minor differences 
from batch to batch. Additionally, the quality of the deionized water, the measurement system (measurement 
error in the range of 2 to 5 %) or the accuracy of the weighing of the Xanthan gum might be influencing factors. 
Activated sludge is a complex composition of several compounds. With liquors and ions in it, a coalescence 
hindrance system can be assumed for the bubble swarm. To simulate this coalescence hindrance, two surfactants 
were tested. For both, the surface-active agent sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and the inorganic salt sodium 
sulphate Na2SO4, a decrease of the bubble sizes - the actual effect of the coalescence hindrance - were shown 
[132, 133]. In ionic systems, this effect is usually associated with the orientation of the ions on the surface of the, 
generally speaking, fluid particle with a repelling effect based on the charge. As the single bubble and bubble

4.2 The continuous phases

swarm experiments in this investigation were supposed to be as similar as possible, a change of the interfacial 
tension should be as small as possible (a difference of the interfacial tension would lead, e.g., to a difference of 
the Eötvös number). In the following, the symbol σ will be used for the interfacial tension, common in German 
literature, in contrast to γ, common in international literature, to avoid confusions with the shear rate. Figure 4.5 
shows results of the interfacial tension measurements for different concentrations of SDS and sodium sulphate. 
For water and Xanthan solution, the interfacial tension is similar with σW = 72.05∙10-3 N/m for water and 
σX = 71.14∙10-3 N/m for Xanthan solution. Generally, the interfacial tension of water and Xanthan solution 
behaves similarly, even with surfactants. As expected, SDS was found to reduce the interfacial tension (by more 
than 50 %) while sodium sulphate did not affect the interfacial tension at all. Therefore, the bubble swarm 
experiments for the HSC measurements in the coalescence hindered system were performed with 0.1 mol/L 
sodium sulphate, ensuring a coalescence hindered system with comparable conditions to the experiments without 
ions (see Table 4.1 for all interfacial tensions measured with a pendant drop system). While surface-active 
agents are known to influence the fluid dynamics of fluid particles by increasing the rigidity of the surface [107], 
the effect of the inorganic salt ions on the fluid dynamics of bubbles is not completely clear in literature. 
Maldonado et al. [134] showed an influence of the concentration of, i.a., sodium sulphate on the bubble shape 
and the resulting terminal rise velocity which, due to a lack of the influence on the interfacial tension, can only 
be a result of an effect on the internal circulation in the bubble. 
For the EDM tests, a mixture of several salts, necessary for the measurement principle, were added to the 
deionized water or the Xanthan solution, respectively. For all tests, potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) with a 
concentration of 0.988 g/L, potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) with a concentration of 2.530 g/L and potassium 
chloride with a concentration of 22.368 g/L were added. Here, the interfacial tension is also similar to the case 
with water and sodium sulphate. 
Zhong et al. [135] discussed the effect of ions on the rheological behavior of Xanthan solutions. The addition of 
ions can promote an ordered or a disordered state of the Xanthan molecule (below, or respectively above, a

critical Xanthan concentration of 2 g/L) leading to a decrease, or respectively an increase, of the viscosity. 
Above a certain ionic strength (approx. 2 mmol/L), this effect is stable. Figure 4.4 shows the rheological 
behavior of both Xanthan solutions with ions which are similar for both types of added ions (sodium sulphate 
and EDM salts) and described by 
𝜇(𝑐𝑋𝑎𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛,𝑤/ 𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠= 0.8 𝑔/𝐿) = 65.8𝑚𝑃𝑎𝑠0.54𝛾−0.46. 
(4.11) 
These types of Xanthan solutions with ions are comparable to activated sludge with an MLSS concentration of 
6.4 g/L described by: 
𝜇(𝑐𝑀𝐿𝑆𝑆= 6.4 𝑔/𝐿) = 68.6𝑚𝑃𝑎𝑠0.56𝛾−0.44. 
(4.12) 
The effect of the ions on the viscosity of water is negligible (difference to deionized water around ±5 %). Table 
4.1 shows all measured material properties for the different continuous phases. 
For the PIV measurements (only performed for the single bubble rise), particles had to be added as this technique 
is based on the light scattering or fluorescence of particles (see Section 4.4). The used particles were made of 
poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA, ρP = 1190 kg/m³) coated with Rhodamine B (supplied by microparticles 
GmbH). Although neutral buoyancy is favorable, a certain density difference in comparison to the used 
continuous phases was apparent (see Table 4.1 for the densities of the continuous phases measured with an 
Anton Paar DSA 5000M). PIV tests were performed without any flow to see if a movement of the particles due 
to the gravitational force could be observed. With the used measurement settings, no such movement was found. 
The polydisperse particles were in a particle diameter range between 20 and 50 μm. Although the particle 
concentration always had to be adjusted to the respective experiment, an average mass fraction of 10-2 wt% can 
roughly be assumed for all experiments. For such low mass fractions, Hooshyar et al. [136] found no influence 
of solid particles on the bubble rise velocity. Additionally, Hooshyar et al. gave a critical Stokes number for 
Newtonian liquids

of Stcrit = 1, with no influence on the single bubble rise for St  < 1 (with τP as the Stokes relaxation time of the 
particle, τB as the characteristic time of the rising bubble, dP as the particle diameter in m, μ as the dynamic 
viscosity of the liquid in Pa s, dB as the bubble diameter in m, wB,rel as the relative terminal rise velocity of the 
bubble in m/s). Assuming the ‘worst’ case, for the largest solid particles and the smallest bubbles rising in water, 
a Stokes number of St = 10-2 was found. Therefore, the assumption of a negligible influence of the particles on 
the bubble ascent is valid.

With such a calculation, again in the worst case for the largest solid particles and the smallest bubbles, a Stokes 
number of StnN = 3.6 was found. Here, the Stokes number is above the critical value but still it is worth 
mentioning that Hooshyar et al. [136] did not test the influence of solid particles on bubbles rising in non-
Newtonian continuous phases and even for such Stokes numbers, they did not find an influence on the bubble 
ascent due to the low mass fraction of the particles. 
4.3 High Speed Camera Imaging (HSC) 
For the high speed camera imaging of single bubbles [4, 6] and bubble swarms [8] the experimental setup 
consisted of: 
 
Photonfocus MV-D752-80-CL-8 CMOS progressive scan camera 
o 
8-bit gray scale camera 
o 
maximum resolution of 752 px by 582 px (at 350 frames per second) 
o

o

avoid different illumination intensities on the images recorded by the high speed camera due to 
overlaying frequencies of the illumination power supply and the recording instants of the 
camera 
o 
light diffusing paper to gain a uniform light intensity on the recorded image 
 
computer  
o 
setup software PFRemote 2.40 
o

o 
image analysis software National Instruments Vision Development Module in LabVIEW 2013 
(and newer) and ImageJ (v.1.46 and newer) 
o 
data analysis software Microsoft Excel 2003 and 2010 and MathWorks MATLAB 2010 (and 
newer) 
The image recording was performed at 100 frames per seconds with a resolution of 100 px by 582 px (SB, in the 
y-z-plane, see Figure 4.6a) or 200 frames per second at a resolution of 148 px by 582 px (SB and BS, in the x-y-
plane). The automated image analysis performed with LabVIEW consisted of the following steps (further 
described in [137]): 
 
cutting of the images to the appropriate size 
Due to practical reasons, the recorded images contained the side wall of the flow channel. The image 
that was used for the analysis was cut in a way that only inner flow-through-regions were part of the 
image. 
 
subtraction of the background image (without bubble/s) from the raw image (with bubble/s) 

4 Materials and methods 
 
36 
 
To determine the bubble/s in the image, an image without bubble/s was subtracted so that ideally only 
pixels at positions where the edge of a bubble was located had gray scale values above zero. 
 
conversion of the 8-bit image into a binary image by setting a gray scale threshold 
As in reality the background subtraction did not work perfectly (e.g., due to minor light fluctuations 
during the experiment), pixels had a gray scale value slightly above zero which were not related to a 
bubble edge. Therefore, a threshold gray scale value was chosen. If a pixel had a gray scale value 
below the threshold, its value was set to zero. Respectively, all pixels with gray scale values above the 
threshold got a value of one resulting in a binary image. As for the different experiments no objective 
way was found to set a threshold value, this was done by hand to ensure comparable conditions for all 
cases.  
 
edge detection and if necessary closing the edge/s 
For further analysis, each individual bubble (in case of the bubble swarm) had to be defined which was 
done by finding closed edges. Each closed edge was one bubble. If edges were not completely closed 
(forming an open circular-like shape), these open edges were closed by a straight connection and all 
gray scale values of the pixels on this line were set to one. 
 
filling the area inside closed edges 
 
The gray scale values of all pixels inside a closed edge were set to one.  
 
export of the mass center/s of the bubble/s (SB, BS), vertical and horizontal dimensions of the bubble 
(SB) and area covered by the bubbles (BS) to Microsoft Excel 
Of each individual detected bubble, the mass center and the dimensions in x-direction (horizontal) and 
in y-direction (vertical) was calculated. This data was exported to Microsoft Excel 2010 which was 
used to analyze the data.  
Figure 4.6: (a) Field of view in the HSC experiments, either for the movement parallel to the plates (x-y-
plane) or between the plates (y-z-plane) and (b) example for a rising path of a single bubble (dc = 5 mm,  
dB = 5 mm,  vL = 0 m/s) (based on [4]) 

4.3 High Speed Camera Imaging (HSC) 
 
37 
 
In case of the single bubble, with the information about the mass center of the bubble (x- and y-coordinate) in 
consecutive images, the rising path can be assembled [4] and, with the knowledge about the interframe time, the 
absolute rise velocity and the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation can be determined [4, 6] (see Figure 
4.6b). Additionally, the vertical (in y-direction) and horizontal dimensions (in x-direction) of the bubble are 
calculated. This information is used for further related calculations of, e.g., an adjusted friction factor [6]. Due to 
the oscillating movement of the bubble apparent in most cases, all quantities related to the bubble movement 
oscillated as well. Besides the natural oscillation of the determined quantities during one bubble ascent, a 
statistical fluctuation between the different measurements of one parameter combination was apparent as well. 
Figure 4.7 shows - for an example parameter combination - the development of the mean value of the absolute 
terminal rise velocity of the bubble and its standard deviation (primary y-axis; the y-axis is scaled to the range 
between 17 and 19 cm/s to make the development observable). The secondary y-axis shows the development of 
the relative change of the mean and standard deviation. An amount of 40 measurements proved to be sufficient 
for relative changes below 1 %. In the actual experiments, at least 50 bubble ascents were recorded for each 
parameter combination to allow the deletion of potential outliers which were determined manually. 
For the bubble swarm experiments [8], the gas hold-up was quantified based on the area covered by the bubbles 
relative to the total area on the 2D images. Additionally, the overlaying of the determined mass centers of the 
bubbles of several consecutively recorded images allowed the qualitative illustration of bubble paths.

In an ideal case, the particles move respective to their surrounding liquid (a discrepancy between the liquid and 
particle movement is mainly due to density differences between the liquid and the particle). The emitted light 
from the particles is recorded with the camera in a double frame mode with a defined time difference between 
the laser emissions of the two laser heads each illuminating one frame. The images are split up into interrogation 
windows of defined sizes each containing images of particle clusters. For each interrogation window, containing 
a defined number of pixels with respective gray scale values, a recalculation by fast Fourier transformation

(FFT) is done. Based on this calculation, the two images of the double frame can be compared with a cross 
correlation and, ideally, one intensity peak with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio is found representing the most 
likely displacement of the particle cluster between the two images. The combination of the information about 
this displacement, equivalent to a certain distance, and the time difference between the two laser emissions give 
the representative velocity for this interrogation window. By doing this for all interrogation windows, a (2D) 
velocity vector field can be built up [139, 140]. Based on this knowledge, the experiment has to be designed 
respectively, i.a., with an appropriate particle size and concentration and a suitable time difference between the 
recordings of the double frame. Several analysis adjustments are discussed in literature for the improvement of 
the results, such as multi-pass analysis, grid refining schemes, image deformation schemes or multiple-grid 
analysis as well as post-processing procedures for the replacement of incorrect data [138].  
In the PIV measurements performed for this study [2, 7], rather simple analysis types were used for the raw data. 
A multiple pass algorithm with two passes and a grid refinement were applied. This method of offsetting the 
interrogation window in the second pass in a way that the correlation peak shows only a minor pixel 
displacement, improves the signal-to-noise-ratio and reduces the resulting error [138]. Further post-processing 
was done based on a comparison procedure where every velocity vector is compared to its surrounding velocity 
vectors. The velocity vector is replaced if its direction and velocity magnitude is not within a certain limit of the 
average of the surrounding velocity vectors. 
The challenge of the application of PIV in this thesis was less on the side of the actual PIV algorithm analysis 
but rather on the extraction of information from this data. The transient rising behavior of the bubble with an 
oscillating ascent through the field of view (Figure 4.8) basically only allowed an interpretation of instantaneous 
flow fields (Figure 4.9a in water). For steady state processes, an average flow field can be calculated from a 
certain number of double image recordings, compensating minor fluctuations of the system. As described in 
Böhm and Kraume [7], here, such an averaging is not possible. For transient periodic processes, e.g., the rotation 
of a propeller, the phase-locking procedure can be used for the generation of averaged flow fields by recording a 
certain number of double images at the same propeller angle during its rotation. As the bubble oscillation is a 
periodic process, the basic idea of this PIV operating type would be applicable here as well but it requires either  
 
an appropriate triggering (in case of the rotating propeller, e.g., a position detector on the shaft with a 
trigger signal output) or  
 
a sufficiently time-resolved recording that allows the extraction of flow fields related to fixed phases in 
the periodic movement. 
Neither of these requirements could be fulfilled for this investigation: 
 
the triggering for a defined position of the bubble in its rising period is not possible. Theoretically - but 
not practically - this might be possible  
o 
with a simultaneous high speed imaging and a real-time analysis of the bubble movement or 
o 
if the rising paths of the bubbles were equal in all cases, then a trigger signal at the moment of 
the release of the bubble would be sufficient

 
the maximum frame rate of the used PIV system of 14.2 Hz was too low to resolve the periodic 
movement of the bubble (the oscillation frequency was in a range of 5 to 10 Hz [6] requiring a frame 
rate of at least 100 to 200 Hz for a proper resolution of the movement) 
Therefore, a modified quasi-phase-locked recording was introduced for this investigation [7]. Although the 
triggering of the PIV recording with the release of the bubble was not sufficient to record the bubble in the same 
phase of the rising period, this at least allowed recording images with the single bubbles roughly at the same 
position in the field of view (Figure 4.9b). As this still did not allow the calculation of averaged flow fields, the 
following procedure was introduced:  
 
For each individual bubble ascent the desired quantity was determined for each interrogation window 
within the recorded image. 
 
The values determined for each interrogation window for each separate bubble ascent were exported 
(without any information about the position of the respective interrogation window). 
 
This data was used for a statistical analysis showing the probability of the occurrence of the quantity in 
the flow field (as cumulative distribution functions (CDF), with an example shown in Figure 4.9c in a 
probability grid for the velocity magnitude wabs).  
 
Based on the idea of box-and-whisker plots, as commonly used in statistics, from the CDFs the 1st, 
10th, 90th and 99th quantile (as indicated by the white, grey and black bar in Figure 4.9c) were 
extracted and used for the comparison.

An amount of approximately 30 measurements per parameter combination proved to be a sufficient data base for 
the CDFs. This type of analysis (here: done with MathWorks MATLAB) allows a quantitative comparison of the 
different parameter combinations in this study but also - potentially - allows the comparison with other systems. 
The determined quantities were  


4.5 The electrodiffusion method (EDM) 
The principle of the EDM was described in detail in Böhm et al. [5] and the articles discussing results gained by 
the EDM [2, 3, 8]. The basic components of this measurement technique are  
 
cathodes (here: 8 platinum wires with a diameter of 0.5 mm mounted flush with the flow channel wall 
with a distance of 5 mm between each other), 
 
an anode (here: platinum wire inserted into the flow channel) connected to a voltage source and  
 
an electrolyte solution (here: composed as described in Section 4.2) between the electrodes.  
With the used electrolyte solution, a heterogeneous reaction ( Fe(CN)6
-3 + e- → Fe(CN)6
-4 ) takes place at the 
electrodes measurable as a voltage drop (as this voltage drop is in the μV range, here a 1000 fold amplification 
was used). The voltage difference between the electrodes is set to a value (here: 500 mV) that guarantees a mass 
transfer limited system (limiting-current-condition). Therefore, the measured voltage drop only depends on the 
mass transfer which increases with higher convective mass transfer. Based on a mass balance, a relation for the 
current I (measured at 500 or 750 Hz; I is related to the voltage by Ohm’s law; here, an Ohmic resistance with 
100.2 Ω is used) and the wall shear rate γs (in s-1) can be found for the steady state 
𝛾𝑠= 𝑘𝐿𝑒𝑣
−3 𝐼3 
(4.16) 
with kLev as the Leveque coefficient in A/s1/3 [142]. With all the assumptions made in the derivation and the setup 
used here, the wall shear rate is determined normal to the wall (z-direction) as

The Leveque coefficient can be determined theoretically as a function of the electrode area, ion concentration 
and diffusion coefficient of the ions. In this study, the Leveque coefficient was determined by a calibration with 
defined shear rates to the electrodes. Figure 4.10 illustrates the result of the calculation of the theoretical relative 
single-phase liquid velocity

contour plot of the velocity distribution in the channel cross section, Figure 4.10b shows the velocity profile in 
the z-direction and Figure 4.10c shows the velocity profile in the x-direction, both at center position. Such 
theoretical calculations can be done for non-Newtonian liquids as well. For the simplified case of dw → ∞, based 
on the Navier-Stokes equation and the Ostwald-de Waele approach, a velocity profile of wy as a function of z can 
be analytically calculated

In Figure 4.10b and c, the velocity profiles of the single phase liquid flows of Xanthan solution with and 
without ions are included. For the cases with dw ≠ ∞, Muzychka and Edge [144] calculated theoretical shear rates 
which were used here to calibrate the system under the respective experimental conditions. 
Most results in fluid dynamic research of MBR systems performed with the EDM were calculated using 
equation (4.16). Actually most of these studies investigate transient systems. For those systems, several types of 
corrections can be found in literature for measured signals [5]. One equation taking the transient behavior into 
account is

with γc as the corrected shear rate in s-1, the  kCot as the Cottrell coefficient in As1/2 and t as the time in s. The 
Cottrell coefficient can be calculated theoretically as a function of the same quantities as the Leveque coefficient. 
Still, in this investigation the Cottrell coefficient was determined experimentally by voltage step experiments 
[145] (measured with a frequency of 4000 Hz). Where applicable in this investigation, results of both types of 
analyses are shown (in this thesis: SB: transient corrected, BS: steady analysis). Based on these shear rates, the 
respective shear stresses τ (in Pa) are calculated using

for both types of analyses (with n = 1 and K = μ for the Newtonian liquid). 
The maximum wall shear stress and the global shear wall stress level were analyzed in case of the single bubble 
and the average shear stress and its fluctuations (represented by the standard deviation) in case of the bubble 
swarm. 
Figure 4.11a shows the signal generated by one single bubble. For the analysis, from each of the single bubble 
rising events,  
 
the maximum wall shear stress value was determined and  
 
a global wall shear stress level was evaluated by analyzing all shear stress values in the time period 
found 0.5 s before and 1.5 s after the occurrence of the maximum shear stress value measured by the 
sensor which showed the maximum value and the two neighboring sensors.  
From this data, CDFs were assembled showing the probability of the occurrence of certain maximum wall shear 
stress values τmax (Figure 4.11b) and global wall shear stress level values τglob (Figure 4.11c), both plotted in a 
probability grid. Roughly 1500 single bubble rises were performed for each parameter combination. As 
discussed for the PIV experiments in Section 4.4, in the following the results are presented as a type of box-and-
whisker plot, showing the 1st, 10th, 90th and 99th quantile from the CDFs (as indicated by the white, grey and 
black bar in Figure 4.11b and c).

In case of the bubble swarm experiments, 5 measurements were carried out for every parameter combination, 
each for three seconds. The start of each measurement was not, as in the case of the single bubble experiments,

data of all sensors (example data shown in Figure 4.12).

5 Results and discussion 
In this section, the fundamental behavior of single bubbles rising in confining geometries, their influence on the 
surrounding liquid and the generated wall shear stress are discussed first. This is followed by the discussion of 
bubble swarms in such systems. The bubble swarm behavior is also related to the previously discussed single 
bubble results. Boxed text parts contain intermediate conclusions at the appropriate points in the manuscript. 
Finally, a short cut method for the determination of bubble swarm generated wall shear stresses is presented and 
also compared to experimental values determined in the system. These results are used to extract engineering 
recommendations for flat sheet membrane systems.  
5.1 Single bubbles rising in the flow channel 
In this section, the single bubble ascent is the focus of the investigation. The influence of the varied parameters, 
inspired by the flat sheet membrane application, is discussed. The results are compared to results from literature, 
mostly found for freely rising bubbles in stagnant Newtonian liquids. The data is also compared to existing 
correlations and further new correlations are developed as well. All sections, for the bubble behavior, the liquid 
surrounding the bubble and the generated wall shear stress, include a selection of the results from the respective 
publication(s) and in Section 5.1.4 tables are given, summarizing a qualitative overview of the effect of each 
varied parameter on the analyzed quantities.  
5.1.1 Rising behavior of a single bubble 
This section covers the bubble dynamics (determined with HSC, based on [4, 6]). The terminal bubble rise 
velocity can be described by a momentum balance usually given by an equilibrium of the surface or resistance 
force and the difference between the gravitational and buoyancy force

(5.1) 
(with CD as the friction factor, wB,rel as the relative rise velocity of the bubble in m/s and g as the gravitational 
constant in m/s²). This momentum balance is based on the two assumptions that the bubble has a spherical shape 
and that the bubble ascent is a steady state process (discrepancies, especially with regard to the spherical shape 
assumption, can be compensated by the friction factor). For a bubble rising in water in an unconfined 
environment, both assumptions are only valid up to a bubble diameter of approximately 1.3 mm (Figure 5.1a). 
The deformation with increasing bubble size is described in Figure 5.1b with the help of the Eötvös number

The respective material properties were shown in Table 4.1. Although discussed in detail in the following, in 
Figure 5.1a the ranges of the relative terminal rise velocities of the bubbles rising in water and Xanthan solution 
found in this investigation are already included. It illustrates that the results found in water are in the same range 
as the data for freely rising bubbles in water. The results for the ascent in Xanthan solution overlap with the 
value range but the lowest value is significantly lower than for the freely rising bubble in water. This can also be 
found in the dimensionless diagram Figure 5.1b. For the ascent data from the confining geometry, it is not 
possible to include the data in the diagram and keep all three dimensionless numbers (ReB, Eo, Mo) at the values 
found in this work. E.g., if the respective ReB and Eo value for one parameter combination were plotted in the 
diagram, this point would be on a wrong Mo number isoline. 
In water, a bubble shape between spherical and wobbling and in the Xanthan solution a bubble shape between 
spherical and ellipsoidal can be expected (this shape regime map in Figure 5.1b was developed for bubbles 
rising in Newtonian liquids). The deformation is accompanied by a change of the rising behavior in terms of a 
change in the rising paths [10] with

a helical path (in water: 1.3 mm < dB < 2.0 mm),  
 
a plane zig-zag turning into a helical path (2.0 mm < dB < 3.6 mm),  
 
a plane zig-zag path (3.6 mm < dB < 4.2 mm) and 
 
a straight path with rocking (4.2 mm < dB < 17.0 mm).  
Therefore, in this investigation, at least in water, a transient motion of the bubble was expected [10]. Figure 5.2 
shows rising paths of bubbles in the x-y- (Figure 5.2a to d) and y-z-plane (Figure 5.2e to h) in water and 
Xanthan solution. Figure 5.2a and e show rising paths in water of a bubble with an equivalent bubble size larger 
than the channel depth. As described above, for this bubble size (dB = 9 mm) a straigth path with a rocking 
motion would be expected for the free bubble ascent. In contrast to this three-dimensional irregular motion, here 
the bubble is restricted to a two-dimensional movement due to the confining walls. Still, in the x-y-plane, a 
regular zig-zag-motion accompanied by a regular bubble deformation (which still might be called wobbling) was 
found. Figure 5.2c and g show rising paths in water of a bubble smaller than the channel depth. For this bubble 
size (dB = 3 mm), the freely rising bubble moves in a plane zig-zag and then helical way. In the confining 
system, mostly the helical but also a two-dimensional zig-zag-movement (either in the x-y- or the y-z-plane) was

found. The bubble shape is between spherical and ellipsoidal. Figure 5.2b and d, and f and h, show rising paths 
under the same conditions as for water but in Xanthan solution. Basically, the bubble shape is mostly ellipsoidal 
and no oscillation can be seen in both cases. A steady, rectilinear motion is apparent in most cases. So from a 
qualitative point of view, as expected, a significant influence of the continuous phase on the bubble ascent is also 
expected quantitatively.  
For the following part that shows all determined quantities, the used symbols are shown in Table 5.2. Due to the 
large amount of varied parameters, a straight-forward way of choosing the symbols in a way to understand the 
diagrams in detail without looking at the legend was not possible. It can generally be kept in mind that the darker 
the symbol is filled, the higher the superimposed liquid velocity was. Other than that, it was tried directly in the 
diagrams to distinguish between the water and Xanthan solution data by either showing separate diagrams for 
each liquid phase or by marking each related data specifically, where possible. Whenever trends are discussed in 
the text that are not directly observable in the respective diagram, this is specifically labeled in the appropriate 
place. Additionally, it can generally be stated that the literature correlations shown in the diagrams for 
comparison were determined for freely rising bubbles without superimposed liquid velocity. 
Figure 5.3 shows the relative terminal rise velocity of a bubble wB,rel (in y-direction) calculated as 
𝑤𝐵,𝑟𝑒𝑙= 𝑤𝐵,𝑎𝑏𝑠−𝑣𝐿 
(5.5) 
in comparison to the results for freely rising bubbles (for all cases, error bars are not included in the plots as the 
standard deviation was only marginal). In case of water as the continuous phase (Figure 5.3a), the results are 
compared to the data concluded by Clift et al. [10] as already shown in Figure 5.1a. The results lie between the 
data presented by Clift et al. for pure and contaminated water. Especially the results without superimposed liquid 
velocity are rather in the range of the results of freely rising bubbles in contaminated water. The contamination 
(e.g., with surfactants) mentioned by Clift et al. rigidifies the bubble surface by an adsorption of surfactant 
molecules on the bubble surface. Due to this, it behaves like a rigid particle without internal circulations in the 
fluid particle. Although no ultrapure water was used as continuous phase, the deionized water quality was high 
enough to ensure that such a state of contamination is not apparent in the system. Therefore, the reduced rising 
velocity in comparison to the freely rising bubble can be attributed to the wall effects in the confining system.

5 Results and discussion 
 
50 
 
For parameter combinations with co-current liquid flow, especially in the case with confining walls, the 
subtraction of the superimposed liquid velocity might not really give comparable results for the relative rise 
velocity to the cases without co-current liquid velocity. The superimposed liquid velocity is the average velocity 
in the channel. As the bubble rises actually in a velocity profile with a zero velocity at the wall and a maximum 
velocity of approximately 1.5 times the average velocity in the center between the walls (see Figure 4.10b), the 
definition of the relative terminal rise velocity (eq.(5.5)) might actually not be applicable here. 
The same data is shown as relative values wB,rel/wB,rel,W,max in Figure 5.3b, i.e., divided by the maximum value 
found in water in this investigation (dc = 5 mm, dB = 7 mm, vL = 0.2 m/s => wB,rel,W,max = 0.25 m/s). For all 
cases - except for the parameter combinations with a superimposed liquid velocity of 0.2 m/s - a (local) 
minimum was found for a relative bubble size dB/dc of 1. For freely rising bubbles in pure water, a local 
minimum also occurs around bubbles of 5 to 7 mm size which are the dB/dc values around 1. As this local 
minimum does not occur at dB/dc = 1 for the cases with vL = 0.2 m/s, it can be concluded that the superimposed 
liquid velocity changes the rise behavior.  
In case of Xanthan solution as the continuous phase (Figure 5.3c), the literature is not as clear on the bubble rise 
velocity. Chhabra [11] summarized several results of freely rising bubbles in non-Newtonian liquids but still no 
definite description and respective explanation was given. Basically two types of behaviors were found:  
 
Figure 5.3: Relative terminal rise velocities of the single bubbles (a) in water and (c) in Xanthan solution 
(in comparison to Margaritis et al. [146]) and the specific rise velocities related to the respective maximum 
relative terminal rise velocity (b) in water and (d) Xanthan solution (symbols explained in Table 5.2; 
based on [6]) 

5.1 Single bubbles rising in the flow channel

1. With increasing bubble size, an increase of the bubble rise velocity was found up to a certain bubble 
size where a jump of the rise velocity to a higher level is apparent. From there on, an increasing bubble 
size either leads to  
a. 
a further increasing rise velocity or  
b. it does not affect the rise velocity anymore.  
2. In the other cases, the rise velocity increases with the bubble size and becomes constant once a certain 
bubble size is exceeded.  
Margaritis et al. [146] discussed data for freely rising bubbles in Xanthan solutions and found a constant rising 
velocity of approximately 0.27 m/s for a bubble diameter larger than 4 mm, independent of the actual Xanthan 
concentration and, therefore, independent of the rheological properties of the continuous phase. In Figure 5.3c, 
all determined rise velocities are lower than the value found by Margaritis et al. [146]. Even without a 
superimposed liquid velocity, a significant increase (of 50 % for dc = 5 mm and 100 % for dc = 7 mm) of the rise 
velocity was found between the bubble sizes dB = 3 mm and dB = 5 mm, which is roughly in accordance with 
Margaritis et al. [146]. Exceeding bubble sizes of 5 mm, the rise velocity is approximately constant (dc = 5 mm) 
or even decreases (dc = 7 mm). In cases with superimposed liquid velocity, below a bubble size of 5 mm, the 
behavior is similar but for the larger bubbles still an increase of the rise velocity was found. As described for 
water, the bubbles rise here in a velocity profile as well (indicated in Figure 4.10b) which does not only lead to 
different velocities occurring on the bubble surface but also to a range of viscosities depending on the local 
velocity gradient ( = shear rate) surrounding the bubble. Figure 5.3d shows the relative rise velocity 
wB,rel/wB,rel,X,max (related to the maximum value found in Xanthan solution in this investigation, dc = 5 mm, 
dB = 9 mm, vL = 0.2 m/s => wB,rel,X,max = 0.25 m/s). It illustrates that this complex combination of influencing 
parameters leads to a change of the rising behavior in comparison to water. In case of the non-Newtonian 
continuous phase, the viscosity reduces with increasing shear rate. It is a reasonable assumption that in the given 
confining geometry, in cases with superimposed liquid velocity, higher shear rates and therefore lower 
viscosities occur in the vicinity of the bubble (this will also be discussed in Section 5.1.2). This lowered 
viscosity is a potential explanation for the rise velocity increase. The specific bubble diameter does not seem to 
have a significant influence as the change of the velocity slope ΔwB,rel/ΔdB is generally lower for bubble 
diameters larger than 5 mm (see Figure 5.3c, based on the parameter combinations tested in this work).  
As discussed, for the relative rise velocity mostly data for a Newtonian continuous phase can be found in the 
literature. The dimensionless friction factor CD is a quantity for which Margartis et al. [146] found a correlation 
based on a broad range of bubble ascents in Newtonian liquid and different types of non-Newtonian 
polysaccharide solutions. In case of a Newtonian continuous phase, the friction factor is defined by

and the experimental values found for the bubble ascent in Xanthan solutions are plotted in Figure 5.4a. See

reveals only a minor difference. Here and in the following, the coefficient of determination was calculated by 
comparing the measured value and the respective correlation value (according to a parity plot). This has to be 
mentioned here, as strictly speaking R² can only be calculated for linear functions. The value of R² found for 
eq.(5.15) is noteworthy as obviously the deformation and respective rise velocity behavior of the bubble in the 
confining geometry is comparable to that of freely rising bubbles. 
The correlations eq.(5.8) to (5.10) and the bubble ascent data in water from this study can be found in Figure 
5.4b. Here, first of all it is evident that the experimental data is in the same range as the data found for freely 
rising bubbles with increasing friction factors due to deformation. Furthermore, individual slopes are apparent 
for the values obtained for different bubble sizes. With increasing superimposed liquid velocity and increasing

channel depth, higher Reynolds numbers and respectively lower friction factors were found but the described 
effect of the channel depth decreases or is even reversed for increasing liquid velocities (due to the sheer amount 
of data points hardly visible in the plot).

Legendre et al. From a qualitative point of view, the data follows the trend described by the eq.(5.17) although 
the validity for non-Newtonian liquids was not mentioned before. Additionally, approximately half of the values 
found in this investigation were above the validity limit of the correlation. From a quantitative point of view, the 
results found for the Xanthan solution are approx. 50 % below and the results in water approximately 50 % 
above the correlated values. With an adjustment of the prefactor and the exponent of the Weber number (the 
latter one only in case of results in water), the following correlations were found by regression for the bubble 
rising in water (R² = 0.97)

The similar behavior in case of Xanthan solution and corresponding differing behavior in water (regarding the 
exponents of We and Mo) can be attributed to the fact that Legendre et al. investigated mainly systems without 
oscillations in the rising paths.  
The oscillation of the bubble in water was already shown quantitatively in Figure 4.6b and qualitatively in 
Figure 5.2. The quantification of the frequency fB (in Hz) and amplitude 𝑥̂ (displacement of the centroid in the x-
direction in mm, Figure 5.7a) shows that besides the already mentioned deformation, a significant oscillation 
occurs as well. In water, for most parameter combinations, the frequency is in the range of 5 Hz (which is in 
accordance with literature, see, e.g., [93]) and the amplitude increases with the bubble diameter. An increase of 
the liquid velocity (or channel depth) leads to a lowered amplitude but it does not significantly affect the 
frequency. In Xanthan solution, only very low amplitudes often with very high frequencies were found (in 
Figure 5.7a only frequencies up to roughly 13 Hz are shown). The combination of low amplitudes with high 
frequencies makes the oscillation negligible in many cases in Xanthan solution. For these very low amplitudes, 
the high frequencies (above roughly 10 to 15 Hz) can also be data fragments of the automated data analysis. 
Therefore, this data is not shown here. Still, a close-up from the PIV measurements in Figure 5.8, further 
described in Section 5.1.2, actually visualizes these minor oscillations (as Δx1 ≠ Δx2). This figure shows a 
strongly deformed bubble. To emphasize the difference to a bubble rising in a Newtonian continuous phase 
again, Figure 5.1a and b can be used to find the approximate size of a bubble rising in water with the same 
Reynolds number (around ReB = 50). This bubble would be approx. 1 mm in size, spherical in shape and 
following a straight path during its ascent. 
The general behavior, of an amplitude decrease with a frequency increase is illustrated in Figure 5.7b which

The low coefficient of determination (R² = 0.55) indicates that more experiments should be done to prove the 
validity of the correlation but, generally, the correlation reflects the expected behavior of a lowered amplitude at 
higher frequencies. 
In comparison to the behavior of freely rising bubbles often discussed in literature, the behavior here can still be 
calculated by similar correlations in spite of the 1. confining geometry, 2. a superimposed liquid velocity and 3. 
a non-Newtonian liquid phase. Especially in case of the dimensionless correlations, the complex interactions of 
the bubble deformation, the bubble oscillation and the respective rise velocity leads to comparable trends. The 
channel depth and superimposed liquid velocity show a complex interaction (e.g., in water at vL = 0 m/s: 
dc ↑ => wB,rel ↑, at vL = 0.2 m/s: dc ↑ => wB,rel ↓). This cannot be explained yet to the full extent but the change of 
the oscillation parameters frequency and amplitude indicates a changed rising behavior (with vL ↑). 
5.1.2 Flow field in the liquid surrounding single bubble  
After the description of the bubble behavior itself, the liquid surrounding the single bubble is discussed in this 
section (determined with PIV, based on [2, 7]). Different oscillating behaviors during the rise were found for 
bubbles rising in water and Xanthan solution in the previous section. These different rising behaviors which are 
accompanied by different surrounding liquid behaviors are reflected in the respective Reynolds numbers as well. 
For bubbles in the size range investigated in this thesis, the free ascent in water was described by several authors. 
Of these, Brücker [93] gave one of the most comprehensive explanations of the oscillatory movement. The 
oscillatory movement is accompanied by a periodical vortex shedding, creating a Kármán vortex street in the 
wake of the bubble with counter-rotating vortices, both in the x-y- and x-z-plane (creating complex three-
dimensional flow structures, Figure 5.9). Especially the vortices in the x-z-plane (horizontal plane ‘cutting’ 
through the wake of the bubble) can be used to explain the oscillatory movement. At the point where the 
movement in positive x-direction changes to a movement in negative x-direction or vice versa, the reversal point 
of the rising period (see, e.g., Figure 4.6b), two counter rotating vortices develop in the wake of the bubble in 
the x-z-plane in x-direction on the side indicated with ‘1’ in Figure 5.9a. The two counter rotating vortices in the 
x-z-plane are illustrated in the A-A-cut. This leads to a deflection of the main flow (which is in the y-direction) 
on this side of the bubble (side ‘1’), resulting in a slower flow in the y-direction. Therefore, due to the resulting 
lower pressure on the opposite side of the bubble (side ‘2’), this leads to a movement in that direction. This 
repeats periodically in a vice-versa way at both reversal points and, therefore, leads to the oscillatory movement. 
In Figure 4.9a and Figure 5.9b flow fields are shown for the oscillatory movement of different bubbles rising in 
water. This movement was also found in the simulations carried out by Prieske et al. [17] who did CFD 
simulations for similar parameter combinations (Figure 5.9a). 

5.1 Single bubbles rising in the flow channel 
 
57 
 
To be in the Reynolds number range as found with Xanthan solution as the continuous phase, a single bubble in 
water would be around 1 mm in size (based on Figure 5.1a and b). As discussed before, this bubble would have 
a spherical shape and would rise in a straight fashion. For such bubbles in Newtonian liquids, the surrounding 
liquid behavior is usually described by a zone above the bubble where the liquid is pushed upwards and a zone in 
the wake of the bubble where the liquid is dragged up [94, 101]. Figure 5.10b shows the flow field of a bubble 
rising in Xanthan solution as found in this investigation. As a logical consequence of the lack of oscillation 
found in Section 5.1.1, a symmetrical flow field was found near the bubble. Still, this flow field is different in 
comparison to the flow field expected in case of a Newtonian continuous phase. Funfschilling and Li [101] 
described the flow field around freely rising single bubbles in a shear-thinning, non-Newtonian continuous 
phase. In a system with viscosities approximately one order of magnitude higher in comparison to the Xanthan 
solution used here, they found a flow field qualitatively shown in Figure 5.10a, with three main flow zones. In 
zone I above the bubble, liquid is pushed upwards as it would be the case of a Newtonian continuous phase as 
well. The wake of the bubble on the other hand shows a different picture. Here, two zones can be found: in zone 
II, an upward flow occurs which lies like a conical coat around a central conical downward flow area (sometimes 
also referred to as ‘negative wake’, zone III). It was speculated that the central downward flow was due to the 
viscoelastic properties of the used continuous phase which lead to “central corridors of reduced viscosity” [103, 
150, 151]. In this investigation with a generally lower viscosity level, negligible viscoelasticity and confining

geometry, a different flow field was found. Zone I, II and III as described above appeared here as well but zone I 
was a fully circulating flow around the bubble leading to an upward motion directly below the bubble (Figure 
5.10c). Only at a certain distance from the bubble, in the wake, the flow is reversed (zone IV) and the downward 
flow develops as it was described above. As indicated already in Section 5.1.1, for the larger bubbles even an 
oscillation tendency was recognizable which established in an asymmetrical flow field. Figure 5.8 shows two 
consecutively recorded images of a 9 mm bubble with the respective velocity vector field around it. While for 
the smaller bubbles a symmetrical flow reversal was found (zone V in Figure 5.10c) turning the flow from the 
central downward flow region (zone III) to the outer upward flow region (zone II), this flow reversal region is 
asymmetrical in case of the larger bubbles. It can be seen in Figure 5.8, that in the first recorded image at the far 
end of the bubble wake, a vortex on the right side is closer to the bubble than on the left side. In the second 
image, the wake is still asymmetrical. This oscillation is accompanied by a periodical deformation resulting in 
ratios of the vertical dB,v and horizontal dimension dB,h of the bubble as low as 0.38 (further discussed in [6]). As 
indicated in Figure 5.10a, this is actually also - in parts - in contrast to bubble shapes found by Funfschilling and 
Li [101] who introduced their qualitative flow field for a bubble with dB,v/dB,h-values above one. This qualitative 
discussion corroborates that the investigated non-Newtonian liquid is an intermediate case between the 
Newtonian liquid with a viscosity of water and the high viscosity level non-Newtonian liquid as investigated by 
Funfschilling and Li [101]. 
The newly developed way to analyze this highly transient process (as described in Section 4.4) allowed the 
comparison of quantitative data of all parameter combinations. Such a discussion can rarely be found in the 
articles dealing with investigations of the single bubble ascent with the help of PIV. Therefore, for the quantities

presented here, no comparison to the literature of other working groups can be given. Where applicable, 
comparisons to own publications will be made.  
Figure 5.11 shows the velocity magnitude wabs occurring in the liquid surrounding the bubble (as described in 
Section 4.4: the absolute value of the velocity vector in the x-y-direction |𝑤𝑥𝑦
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ |) in water and Xanthan solution. 
The absolute terminal rise velocities of the respective single bubbles (as found in [6]) are incorporated in the 
plot. At first sight it is noticeable that - if applied - the superimposed liquid velocities dominate the velocity 
magnitude data as the median values are independent of the bubble size. This means that, if vL > 0, the median 
values wabs,median with or without additional bubble ascent are equal to the maximum velocity occurring in the 
velocity profile between the two walls (z = dc/2) as found for a single phase liquid flow (see also Figure 4.10). 
This is the case as the field of view was at the symmetry plane between the walls [7] ( = x-y-plane at z = dc/2).  
Still, as the single liquid phase flow tests showed, the variation of velocities around the median value can be 
completely attributed to the influence of the bubble (for the single phase flow only the median value is shown as 
the fluctuation around it was negligible). For a constant bubble size, the liquid velocity magnitude intervals 
related to the probability ranges (1 to 99 %) are almost constant but shifted to a higher level by the superimposed 
liquid velocity. This shift is also found in the absolute terminal rise velocities of the single bubbles. Furthermore, 
it can be stated that the larger the bubble, the larger the liquid velocity interval and the more the interval overlaps 
with the absolute terminal rise velocity of the bubble. This can be attributed to a larger area in the recorded 
image that is affected by the bubble (also found by Jankhah and Bérubé [64] for larger bubbles). Therefore, the 
size of the recorded field of view has an influence on the presented velocity magnitude intervals. Here, in all 
cases the field of view was equally sized. Analysis tests were performed with adjusted fields of view sized 
relative to the tested bubble size, with five bubble diameters in width and ten bubble diameters in height

(analogous to the previous CFD simulations [17]). This did not result in significant changes compared to the data  
presented here. Smaller relatively sized fields of view might have an effect but this was not further investigated  
here.

Figure 5.12 shows the development of the 1 to 99 %-intervals of the velocity magnitude (related to the smallest 
1 to 99 %-interval found for dc = 5 mm, dB = 3 mm) against the bubble size (related to smallest tested bubble size 
dB,min = 3 mm) for vL = 0.1 m/s. It illustrates that the velocity magnitude interval does not increase proportional to 
the bubble size but rather to the horizontal dimension of the bubble dB,h (which is here also related to 
dB,min = 3 mm).  
Only tested for Xanthan solution, the channel depth does not have a clear significant influence on the occurring 
liquid velocities (Figure 5.11b). Usually, the velocity magnitude intervals are larger in the 7 mm channel which 
can be attributed to the - in most cases - higher rise velocities of the bubble.  
In Section 5.1.1, the oscillation behavior was discussed with larger amplitudes for larger bubbles (mainly found 
in water). In the PIV investigations, larger velocity magnitude intervals were found for larger bubbles. These 
findings combined substantiate that a much larger area is affected by larger bubbles in comparison to the area 
affected by smaller bubbles. This is not only due to the bubble size itself (covering already a larger area) but 
also to the rising and deformation behavior. Remembering the purpose of the bubble which is the cleaning of 
membranes covered with deposition layers, this simply means that larger bubbles have the potential to clean a 
larger membrane surface area. 
With respect to the biological community in membrane bioreactors, the shear rates ( γliq (yx) = 
𝜕𝑤𝑦
𝜕𝑥 as described 
in Section 4.4, for results see Figure 5.13a) and shear stresses (Figure 5.13b) in the liquid surrounding the 
bubble were analyzed. Microorganisms can be sensitive to the shear they are exposed to [152] which would be 
mainly the shear occurring in the bulk. Although they are not directly the shear rates/stresses at the wall and, 
thereby, responsible for the cleaning of the membranes, these values can still give an idea about the respective 
wall shear stress behavior. As the shear rates and the respective shear stresses were evenly distributed around a 
value of zero (as an example shown in Figure 5.13a for dB = 3 mm in water), only the probability ranges of 50 to 
90 % and 90 to 99 % are shown in Figure 5.13. Therefore, the respective 1 and 10 % values are the values at 99 
and 90 % multiplied by (-1). The shear rates which mainly appear in the wake of the bubble are, in case of water,

a result of the vortices and, in case of Xanthan solution, a result of the contrariwise flow regions with a sharp 
transition between each other. In case of water, the even distribution of the shear rate values around zero are a 
result of the periodic shedding of the counter-rotating vortices. In case of Xanthan solution, the symmetrical flow

field is the reason for the even distribution around zero. As found for the velocity magnitude, here the probability 
ranges tend to increase with increasing bubble size as well. For water, a change occurs with respect to the 
behavior with increasing superimposed liquid velocity. For 3 and 5 mm bubbles, the interval increases with 
superimposed liquid velocity, for 7 and 9 mm bubbles, the intervals are constant. This behavior change does not 
appear with Xanthan solution as the continuous phase. The respective relative bubble rise velocities are shown in 
Figure 5.11. For larger bubbles, the shear rates in Xanthan solution are much more sensitive to the superimposed 
liquid velocities than in water. Generally, the shear rate intervals in Xanthan solution are larger in comparison to 
water (by a factor of approximately 1.5 to 2) which can be attributed to the large areas of high shear rates in the 
flow reversal zones (zone IV and V and the region between zone II and III in Figure 5.10c). While the shear 
rates in water and Xanthan solution are still in the same order of magnitude, another picture is found for the 
shear stresses (Figure 5.13b). Due to the differing rheological characteristics of the two liquid phases, there is a 
difference of more than an order of magnitude between the shear stresses occurring in the Newtonian and non-
Newtonian continuous phases. Figure 5.14 illustrates this difference (shown for dc = 7 mm, vL = 0.1 m/s) by 
showing the factor between the 99 %-value of the shear rate and shear stress in Xanthan solution and water. 
Additionally, in case of Xanthan solution the calculation leads to a larger 50 to 90 % range of the occurring shear 
stress in the liquid surrounding the bubble in comparison to the shear rate ranges which is equivalent to a broader 
probability density distribution of the shear stress. 
A fairly different liquid flow behavior was found for bubbles rising in water and Xanthan solution. Still, the 
occurring shear rates in the liquid surrounding the bubble are in the same order of magnitude (being higher for 
Xanthan solution, differing roughly by a factor of two). Due to the difference in the rheology, the occurring 
shear stresses, however, are off by an order of magnitude. 
With the motivation of this project in mind, the shear stress occurring in the y-z-plane normal to the walls would 
be of even higher interest. Tests were also performed where the position of the camera and the laser were 
exchanged so that an image in the y-z-plane was recorded. This field of view would be equivalent to a plane 
normal to the membrane surfaces. Still, for several reasons these experiments were very challenging which is

solution (X) (based on data from [7])

why no statistically analyzed data is shown for this case. There were two main challenges related to this 
experiment: 
 
In order to obtain a detailed image, the field of view was much smaller in comparison to the previously 
described experiments. Roughly, the size was equal to one ( = width of the image) by two channel 
depths ( = height of the image) which means that, depending on the bubble size, large areas of the 
image were covered by the bubble itself (see Figure 5.15a). This also means that only in a very small 
time frame, the bubble is actually inside the field of view. As the camera had a maximum frame rate of 
14.2 Hz, even in combination with the triggering used for the experiments described above, only rarely 
the bubbles were in the field of view or at a comparable position. 
 
Even if the bubble was at the right position in the image, especially in case of water (and larger bubbles 
in Xanthan solution) with strongly pronounced oscillations, the bubble was at different positions 
relative to the fixed laser sheet as indicated in Figure 5.15b to d. This means that of the rare recordings 
where the bubble was actually in the right position in the field of view, even less recordings show 
images where the laser sheet cuts through the center of the bubble. 
Additionally, results of PIV measurements near a wall should generally be assessed very critically as, e.g., the 
particle concentration is usually not high enough for appropriately conducting the PIV algorithm (see, e.g., 
[153]). Therefore, only some qualitative results of experiments in water are discussed here. Besides Figure 5.15a 
which shows an almost symmetrical flow field around a 7 mm bubble in a 7 mm channel, Figure 5.16 shows a 
compilation of some results which were determined for a 3 mm bubble rising in a 7 mm channel. Figure 5.16a 
shows the rising path of the bubble. Due to the lower frame rate in comparison to the HSC recordings (see, e.g.,  
 
Figure 5.15: (a) Flow field in the y-z-plane for dc = 7 mm and dB = 7 mm, (b) field of view for the test with 
exchanged camera and laser position to record the area between the walls in the y-z-plane, (c, d) potential

and 165 mm no bubble was found. Obviously, the laser sheet did not cut the bubble. For this case with a bubble 
oscillation in the y-z-plane, for the instant in time when the bubble was at the y-position 133 mm above the

lower end of the image (raw PIV image shown in Figure 5.16b), the velocity field was determined (Figure 
5.16c; a precise resolution of the oscillation was shown in Figure 5.2g). Although the possibility to resolve the 
appearing vortices properly was limited for this image size, the meander like main flow structure is observable in 
the wake of the bubble and the determined vorticity field (Figure 5.16d, red and blue for the opposing algebraic 
signs of the vorticity) indicates the positions of the counter rotating vortices down to the lower end of the image. 
It took the bubble roughly 0.75 s from the entry into the field of view up to the shown position. In accordance 
with Figure 4.11a, this corroborates that, especially in case without superimposed liquid velocity, the liquid was 
affected by the bubble ascent for a certain time. From the author’s experience with the PIV measurements where 
the fluorescent particles could be seen (as safety glasses cut out only the light wave length of the laser light), it 
could take up to 15 seconds, sometimes even more, for the liquid to be stagnant again. With superimposed liquid 
velocity, the duration of the bubble’s influence on the flow field was rather in the range of 1 to 2 seconds. 
Qualitatively, the flow fields in the y-z-plane normal to the walls can explain the bubble rising behavior. For 
dB > dc, a symmetrical flow field due to the confining walls is apparent and, for dB < dc, a flow field comparable 
to the ones found in the x-y-plane for the oscillating bubble was found. 
5.1.3 Wall shear stress generated by a single bubble 
In this section, the wall shear stress generated by single bubbles is discussed (determined with EDM, based on 
[2, 3]). These investigations were done with water doped with the EDM salts (potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) 
and (III) and potassium chloride). In this Newtonian system, the shear stress can be calculated by τ = μ∙γ with 
µ = 1.04∙10-3 Pas (see also Table 4.1). Therefore, only the shear stress is discussed. 
As described in Section 4.5, the global wall shear stress level τglob and the maximum wall shear stress τmax were 
determined for the system. Without resolving it in detail, the global wall shear stress level gives a general idea 
about the occurring wall shear stress in the system. On the other hand, the maximum wall shear stress value 
describes a spatially and timely limited appearing value in case of the discrete event of the single bubble rise.  
In Section 5.1.2, shear rate and shear stress results were shown as well. In contrast to here, the shear rate in the 
liquid, as gained with PIV, was determined in the symmetry plane between the walls (γliq (yx) = 
𝜕𝑤𝑦
𝜕𝑥 at z = dc/2). 
In this section, the wall shear rates are discussed which are the shear rates normal to the wall (y-z-plane at z = 0). 
Hence, this is perpendicular to the plane investigated in the PIV experiments (see eq.(4.17)). The difference 
between the two planes was already illustrated in Figure 4.10b and c. Consequently, the shear rate (and shear 
stress) results from the PIV and the EDM investigations cannot be directly compared. 
Before discussing results, influencing factors for the type of analysis performed here have to be mentioned. 
Especially for the comparison of different CDFs of the global wall shear stress level, as shown for one parameter 
combination in Figure 4.11c, the time period taken into account is an important parameter:  
1. This duration for the analysis (0.5 s before the maximum value and 1.5 s after the peak), influences the 
τglob-interval size. As discussed in Section 5.1.2, the time of influence of the bubble on the surrounding 
liquid is longer by an order of magnitude in the case without superimposed liquid velocity in 
comparison to the one with superimposed liquid velocity. This principle can be seen in Figure 4.11a. If, 
e.g., 0.25 s before and after the peak value would be the duration taken into account, it is plausible that 
the respective global wall shear stress level was higher in comparison to the result from the chosen 

5.1 Single bubbles rising in the flow channel

interval. The duration of two seconds was chosen as an intermediate duration for all experiments. For 
many parameter combinations this leads to a non-Gaussian distribution as shown in Figure 4.11c. 
Figure 5.17 shows CDFs of the maximum wall shear stress for the largest and the smallest tested bubble size in 
two different channel depths at the same superimposed liquid velocity. This example was selected here to 
illustrate that not in all cases a Gaussian distribution is apparent. For the bubbles with equivalent bubble 
diameters larger than the channel depth, a - in most parts - Gaussian distribution was found (proved by the 
straight line between 0.01 and 0.99 probability). For bubble sizes smaller than the channel depth, this is not the 
case. There are several reasons for this probability distribution behavior (the following points are valid for both 
maximum and global wall shear stress level): 
2. To ensure that the signals of the separate sensors in the array do not electrically interact, they were 
installed with a distance of 5 mm between each other. This means that smaller bubbles could pass 
through space between two sensors. Therefore, potentially only the flow around the sides of the bubble 
and not necessarily the high shear stress zone in the liquid film between the bubble and the wall [3, 17] 
affected the result. Approx. 1500 single bubble ascents were taken into account for each parameter 
combination. This ensures that all potential passing ways between the extreme cases (centrally hitting 
one sensor or passing by exactly half way between two sensors) are sufficiently taken into account. 
Still, the result is affected by this situation in contrast to the results for larger bubbles. On the other 
hand, larger bubbles can be deformed strongly (see Section 5.1.1, Figure 5.5). Therefore, at least two if 
not all three sensors can potentially measure the signal of the high shear stress zone in the thin liquid

parameter combinations (steady state analysis)

film between the bubble and the wall. This can explain larger τglob-interval sizes for cases where the 
bubble size is larger than the channel depth (dB/dc > 1). 
3. For the cases where the bubble size is smaller than the channel depth (dB/dc < 1), the oscillation in the z-
direction normal to the walls is also a potentially influencing factor as the sensor array is only located 
on one side of the wall (a rising path for such a case is shown in Section 5.1.1, Figure 5.2g). Assuming 
in this example that the sensor is installed on the right side of the channel, in the instant the bubble 
passes the sensor array, the bubble could be on the right side, the left side or somewhere in between in 
its oscillation period. 
Figure 5.18a shows the probability ranges of the occurrence of the (magnitude of the) global wall shear stress 
level for the tested parameter combinations (assembled as described in Figure 4.11b). The size of the shear 
stress interval (1 to 99 %-value) gives an idea about the occurring fluctuations and the spatial distribution of the 
shear stress. With respect to the membrane application, the median value and the fluctuations are of particular 
interest. The median value is the occurring average value responsible for the detachment of deposition layers. 
Drews et al. [33] calculated critical particle diameters which are lifted from the membrane surface, depending 
on, i.a., the occurring wall shear stress. Especially with respect to membrane bioreactors, not only particulate 
deposition layers are of interest but also biofilms. As already mentioned in Section 2, several authors 
investigated the influence of shear stress on biofilms and found, e.g., an influence of the shear stress on the 
biofilm composition [36], on the release of fouling-promoting substances [19] and an influence of the shear 
stress fluctuations on the detachment of biofilms [35] with improved detachment at enhanced fluctuations.  
Based on Figure 5.18a, the influence of the different parameters can be discussed. If a liquid velocity was 
superimposed, the occurring global wall shear stress level would be dominated by this flow as the median values 
were comparable in all of these cases. As previously mentioned, for some cases the duration taken into account 
for this determination can explain why the probability interval size decreases with increasing superimposed 
liquid velocity (at constant bubble size and channel depth). A comparable behavior was already mentioned 
previously for the occurring velocity magnitude investigated with PIV (Figure 5.11). On the other hand, here 
again, all fluctuations can be attributed to the flow generated by the bubble as the single phase flow showed 
negligible fluctuations. In most cases, an addition of a superimposed liquid velocity resulted in higher global 
wall shear stress levels; in all cases, at least when it comes to the (lowest = ) 1 %-quantile. Mostly, it can be 
stated that an increasing bubble size and a decreasing channel depth lead to a higher global shear stress level. 
Regarding the channel depth, this is reasonable, as with a reduction of the channel depth, the confinement of the 
bubble is increased. As the same effect is valid for the flow around the bubble, higher velocity gradients at the 
wall ( = wall shear rates) and therefore wall shear stresses appear.  
It was mentioned previously that the shear stress results of the PIV experiments (described in Section 5.1.2) 
cannot be directly compared to the EDM results due to differing measurement planes. Figure 5.13 shows the 
occurring shear stress in the liquid surrounding the bubble in the x-y-plane (at z = dc/2). As there were no walls 
in the field of view in the PIV measurements, the determined values are much lower in comparison to the wall 
shear stress measured with EDM (approximately by an order of magnitude). A multiplication of the 99 %-τliq-
value (found with PIV; squares in Figure 5.18a) with a factor of 10 proves to be in fairly good agreement with 
the wall shear stresses from EDM. Most of these (10∙τliq)-values are between the 10 and 90 %-value limits of the 
global wall shear stress level for the respective parameter combination, thus giving a good estimate of τglob.

In literature, no comparable investigation can be found that allow a direct comparison of these values. Ducom et 
al. [54] discussed the relative increase of the wall shear stress due to aeration (so a bubble swarm was used) in 
comparison to the single phase flow. They found factors between 1 and 4. This does not apply here when the

medians of the global wall shear stress level (for the cases with vL = 0.2 m/s) are compared. For all of these 
cases, the respective median value for each channel depths was equal, with or without a bubble of any size (see 
Figure 5.18a). The second factor they introduced was comparing the interval size between the maximum and 
minimum wall shear stress value and the value generated by the single phase flow ((τmax-τmin)/τsingle-phase) which is 
comparable to ((τglob,99%-τglob,1%)/τsingle-phase) in the given case. For this ratio, they found values of 5 to 45 at a 
channel depth of 5 mm. For the single bubble case here, ratios between 1 and 10 were found which is in good 
agreement with the results by Ducom et al. Especially, if it is taken into account that bubble sizes smaller than 
the channel depth were tested as well which was mostly not the case in their investigation. Ratkovich et al. [62] 
investigated the rise of Taylor bubbles in a tubular system with an inner diameter of 9.9 mm. They also evaluated 
the probability of the occurrence of the wall shear stress (including an algebraic sign as they evaluated the 
direction of the flow as well). The values they found were in a range of -2 Pa < τ < 1 Pa. The respective absolute 
values are comparable to the values found in this investigation, especially for the cases with a bubble size larger 
than the channel depth where a thin liquid film appears as it is the case for the Taylor bubbles.  
With increasing bubble size and decreasing channel depth, the global wall shear stress level increases and the 
fluctuations are promoted. The average wall shear stress is below 0.5 Pa but fluctuations can reach values over 
2.5 Pa. Generally, the rising bubble induces fluctuations and it increases the occurring shear stress values 
significantly in comparison to the single-phase flow but the median value is not affected. 
In Figure 5.18b, the maximum wall shear stress is plotted against the bubble size, channel depth and 
superimposed liquid velocity. So here, in contrast to the previously discussed global wall shear stress level, the 
maximum wall shear stress values which were the rarely occurring and locally limited were evaluated. In 
contrast to the global wall shear stress level, the results of the maximum wall shear stress were not dominated by 
the superimposed liquid velocity. As shown in Figure 4.11a where a superimposed liquid velocity of 0.2 m/s 
was applied, the maximum wall shear stress value is usually much higher in comparison to the value generated 
by the single phase liquid flow.  
In most cases, the median values of the maximum wall shear stress increase with increasing bubble size, 
decreasing channel depth and increasing superimposed liquid velocity. These proportionalities are reasonable 
due to an enhanced confinement of the bubble (regarding dB and dc) or, respectively, the lifting of the general 
wall shear stress level (regarding vL). With regard to the fluctuations, the interpretation is not as straight forward. 
The influencing factors ‘distance between the sensors’ and ‘bubble size to channel depth ratio’ do have an effect 
on the results as well: 
 
For dB/dc < 1, the fluctuations ( = (τmax,99%-τglob,1%)) are pronounced which might be attributed to the 
rising behavior of the bubble which oscillates between the walls. Therefore, it bounces against the wall 
periodically which might lead to thin liquid films between the bubble and the wall where high shear can 
occur. On the other hand, when the bubble bounces against the opposite wall when it passes by the 
sensor array, a much larger liquid film is apparent between the bubble and the wall leading to much 
lower values. 
 
For dB/dc > 1, the bubble is squeezed into the space between the walls and, therefore, the liquid films 
between the bubble and the wall are not undergoing such strong variation as in the case of dB/dc < 1. 
Still, the fluctuations ( = (τmax,99%-τglob,1%)) are also pronounced which might be attributed to the fact that 
the size of the area where the actual maximum shear stress occurs is fairly small (as found in the CFD 

5.1 Single bubbles rising in the flow channel

simulation done by Prieske et al. and in parts described in [17]). Consequently, the small sensors which  
have a certain distance between each other will not always be hit by this small peak area which leads to 
fluctuations in the results. 
Therefore, due to these reasons, the results are not always easy to interpret. In comparison to the CFD values 
found by Prieske et al. [17] which were not affected by the practical limitations as described for the EDM (e.g., 
distance between the sensors), the median values found in the experiments were naturally lower in most cases. 
Even with the limitations of the EDM, most of the CFD results are at least in the 1 to 99 %-interval-range of the 
measured maximum wall shear stress results. In comparison to the previously discussed results by Ducom et al. 
[54] now ((τmax,99%-τglob,1%)/τsingle-phase) can be calculated. This is actually closer to their ((τmax-τmin)/τsingle-phase)-ratio. 
Here, values for this ratio up to 30 were found which is even closer to the maximum ratio of 45 which was found 
in their investigation. 
In comparison to the global wall shear stress level, the highest maximum wall shear stress values found in this 
investigation are in parts higher by an order of magnitude. Roughly, the two extreme cases of the smallest and 
the largest bubbles show high maximum wall shear stresses. The small bubble, experiencing an oscillation 
normal to the wall, gives this result most likely due to very thin liquid films occurring when the bubble bounces 
against the wall where the sensors are installed. The larger bubbles are squeezed into the confining channel and, 
therefore, a thin liquid film always occurs during the passage of the sensor array. The highest values of up to 
7.75 Pa were found for a 9 mm bubble rising in a 5 mm channel with a superimposed liquid velocity of 0.2 m/s. 
5.1.4 Conclusions from the single bubble experiments 
In this section about the single bubble ascent in a confining geometry, the bubble behavior itself, its interaction 
with the surrounding liquid and resulting wall shear stresses were discussed. The qualitative dependencies of all 
determined quantities and the varied parameters are collected in 
 
in Table 5.3 (for the bubble behavior [4, 6]), 
 
in Table 5.4 (for the bubble surrounding liquid including the vorticity which was not discussed in the 
frame of this thesis but in the respective publication [7] as the trends are similar to the ones discussed 
for the shear rate) and 
 
in Table 5.5 (for the wall shear stress [2, 3]).  
As single bubble ascents in unconfined geometries in stagnant Newtonian continuous liquid phases are a 
common topic in literature, the influence of the channel depth, superimposed liquid velocity and rheology were 
of particular interest here. In the investigated parameter ranges with a bubble size to channel depth ratio (dB/dc) 
between 0.43 and 3, it depended on the quantity if the channel depth had a significant impact. Correlations found 
for freely rising bubbles worked (in parts) for this system as well.  
One of the aims of this investigation was to check the statement by Ozaki and Yamamoto [46] that results from 
fluid dynamic investigations performed in water are transferrable to MBR systems which are operated with non-
Newtonian activated sludge. Their statement was based on a 10 % higher viscosity of activated sludge in 
comparison to water. In this investigation, a model solution was used in the non-Newtonian fluid dynamic 
experiments with a rheology analogous to MBR sludge with an average MLSS concentration of 11.4 g/L. In the

bubble surrounding liquid, shear rates in this Xanthan solution of up to 80 s-1 were found. Taking the highest 
wall shear rate generated by the single-phase flow into account (400 s-1 for dc = 3 mm and vL = 0.2 m/s) and 
assuming a factor of two between the shear rates in water and Xanthan solution (as discussed in the PIV 
investigations), a wall shear rate of 2∙400 s-1 = 800 s-1 is found. These two cases (80 s-1 and 800 s-1) lead to 
viscosities that are higher by a factor of at least μnN/μwater = 20 or 6 in comparison to water (see Figure 4.4). Even 
for the lowest MLSS concentration used by Ozaki and Yamamoto, the shear rate of 800 s-1 translates to a 40 % 
higher viscosity. Therefore, based on the actual measured shear rate data, already the statement about the 
viscosity relative to water cannot be confirmed. The factor between the viscosity levels of roughly an order of

magnitude between water and the non-Newtonian liquid phase did mostly not appear in the determined 
quantities. Although the rising behavior (oscillating in water in contrast to mostly non-oscillating in Xanthan 
solution) was different from a qualitative point of view, the relative terminal bubble rise velocities were mostly 
similar, especially in cases with superimposed liquid velocity. The interaction between a superimposed liquid 
velocity and the channel depth led to higher shear rates (in comparison to cases with vL = 0 m/s) especially 
normal to the confining walls. These higher shear rates led to a lowered viscosity in the vicinity of the bubble. 
Regarding the shear rates in the liquid surrounding the bubble, results in the Xanthan solution were roughly 
twice as high. Due to the different rheological behavior of the continuous phases, this results in significant 
differences regarding the occurring shear stresses close to the bubble. The wall shear stress measurements were 
only conducted for water (doped with ions) as the continuous phase. Interestingly, bubbles smaller than the 
channel depth showed high wall shear stress values due to the bouncing between the walls resulting from an 
oscillation normal to the wall. For bubbles larger than the channel depth, the high values were measured due to 
the larger area with a thin liquid film between the bubble and the wall. 
From the varied parameters, the bubble size was found to have the strongest impact on the single bubble ascent. 
Most other parameters did not affect the measured quantities as much as it might have been expected, e.g., by 
the confining geometry. This applies as well for the viscosity which for the Xanthan solution is by an order of 
magnitude higher than that of water. This includes the shear rate results in the liquid surrounding the single 
bubble. The shear stress on the other hand is respectively significantly higher.  
5.2 Bubble swarms rising in the flow channel 
After the fundamental investigation of the single bubble ascent under completely defined conditions, in the 
following, the degree of complexity is increased. In a bubble swarm, due to, e.g., bubble interactions it is 
impossible to obtain a completely controlled system. The bubble swarm behavior will be qualitatively described 
with a special focus on the discussion of the influence of the continuous phases. In contrast to the single bubble 
experiments, this section does not only include the non-Newtonian characteristics but also the influence of ions. 
For the quantitative results, the influence of the varied parameters on the gas hold-up and the wall shear stress 
generated by the bubble swarm induced liquid flow is discussed. Additionally, the results are put into context 
with data from literature but a broad literature base is not at hand for the given geometry. Still, existing 
correlations are expanded or new correlations are developed to give mathematical equations describing the 
behavior. 
5.2.1 Flow behavior of the bubble swarm 
In this section, the general flow behavior and the resulting gas hold-up are discussed (determined with HSC, 
based on [8]). Figure 5.19a to d show images of the bubble patterns (in the x-y-plane) for the same parameter 
combination, just with differing continuous phases. Although in the previously described EDM measurements, 
ions were also used (in water), here, for the first time ions were added to the Xanthan solution. As described in 
Section 4.2, regarding the material properties, no difference was found between the addition of the EDM salts 
and sodium sulphate.  

5 Results and discussion

A significant effect of the type of continuous phase on the occurring bubble sizes was found. In contrast to water 
(Figure 5.19a) where intermediately sized bubbles occur, in Xanthan solution (Figure 5.19c) larger bubbles are 
apparent. This is in accordance with Wilkinson et al. [155] who reported that the bubble size is proportional to 
the viscosity of the liquid phase (dB ~ μ). On the other hand, assuming a comparable initial bubble population in 
all cases above the aerator, this is in contradiction to Sanada et al. [156] and Chesters and Hofmann [157] who 
found a decreased coalescence tendency in high viscosity systems. These publications all discussed systems with 
(high viscosity) Newtonian continuous phases. Such publications are rarely found for non-Newtonian continuous 
phases and, if discussed, these investigations mainly deal with the coalescence of two bubbles and not the 
behavior of a complex, dynamic multiple bubble flow [11]. For Newtonian continuous phases (and water in 
particular), flow pattern maps can be found in literature showing the flow characteristics depending on the gas 
velocity. The given system can be seen as a bubble column (with stagnant water if vL = 0 m/s) or a pipe with a 
gas-liquid-two-phase flow (with co-current liquid velocity if vL > 0 m/s). In both cases, the behavior is often 
related to the diameter of the pipe (or column) or the cross section area. For comparison, the hydraulic diameter 
can be calculated for the non-circular cross section in this investigation. The hydraulic diameter dh is calculated 
as 
𝑑ℎ= 4 ∙cross section area normal to main flow
wetted circumference length
=
𝑑𝑐𝑑𝑤
2𝑑𝑐+ 2𝑑𝑤
 
(5.23) 
which leads to a hydraulic diameter of dh = 9.7 mm for the 5 mm channel and dh = 13.4 mm for the 7 mm 
channel (which is close to the hydraulic diameter for channels with an infinite width where the hydraulic 
diameter is two times the depth of channel).  
Regarding the system as a (cylidrical) bubble column [158, 159], the flow should be homogeneous (at low gas 
velocity) and go through a transition state to the heterogeneous flow with a tendency to slug flows (for higher 
 
Figure 5.19: Bubble patterns for the different continuous phases (a-d) and bubble paths for varied liquid 
velocities (e-h) recorded in the x-y-plane (based on [8])

gas velocities). This is in accordance with the observations in the system, with an intermediate heterogeneous 
flow shown in Figure 5.19a. For the case with co-current liquid flow, with respect to the flow pattern map 
reported by Hewitt and Roberts [160], the flow pattern would be in the region between slug flow and bubbly 
flow. In the latter one the turbulence in the liquid flow leads to a break-up of the bubbles and, therefore, larger 
bubbles occur less frequently. 
The addition of ions with the purpose to hinder coalescence leads to a homogeneous bubble flow pattern in case 
of water (Figure 5.19b). In case of the Xanthan solution, the addition of ions did not have this effect (Figure 
5.19d) as frequently break-ups and coalescences of bubbles could be observed. Still, due to the viscosity 
lowering effect by the ions (resulting in an intermediate viscosity between that of water and Xanthan solution, as 
already explained in Section 4.2; see also Table 4.1), the system behaved noticeably more dynamic than in the 
Xanthan solution without ions. 
Regarding the mean bubble diameter ( = average diameter of a volume equivalent bubble), although not studied 
in all detail, a bubble size range between 5 and 30 mm was found with  
 
the largest bubbles in Xanthan solution,  
 
intermediately sized bubbles in water and Xanthan solution with ions and  
 
the smallest bubbles in water doped with ions.  
Especially in case of the aqueous salt solutions, cross-links between the single bubble experiments and the 
bubble swarms can be drawn (which is done in the Section 5.2.2). 
Besides the mentioned effect on the bubble pattern, e.g., the bubble paths are affected as well by the co-current 
liquid velocity. Figure 5.19e to g show bubble paths for the same parameter combination in water just with 
differing superimposed liquid velocities. Especially the case without superimposed liquid velocity (Figure 
5.19e) shows the typical circulation cells where bubbles are dragged out of the main meander-like flow in the 
center of the reactor and pulled downwards at the outer region [161]. In cylindrical columns, the height of the 
circulation cells in which the bubbles rotate along with the liquid is usually in the range of the column diameter. 
From a qualitative point of view, this rule obviously does not apply for the rectangular cross section channel, as 
the height of the circulation cell is larger than the hydraulic diameter. Still, it can be stated that the circulation 
cells are rather in the size range of the width of the channel. With increasing superimposed liquid velocity 
(Figure 5.19f and g), due to the overlying liquid flow pushing the bubbles upwards, the circulation flow cells are 
less pronounced and the meander-like main flow structure is widened. For completeness, Figure 5.19h shows 
the same bubble path determination result for Xanthan solution as the continuous phase. As large bubbles 
dominate these flows (shown in Figure 5.19c), far less bubbles can be tracked and, therefore, the resulting 
images are less meaningful. For the given image, it can be stated that in the lower central position, a larger 
bubble rises upwards and in the upper region it pushes smaller bubbles to the side and downwards.  
Qualitatively, the influence of the continuous phase is significant with larger bubbles occurring in the higher 
viscosity liquid and smaller bubbles occurring in the cases doped with ions. Qualitatively, it was shown that the 
bubble ascent in the bubble swarm is strongly affected by the superimposed liquid velocity reducing the 
tendency for circulation cells to occur. 
A quantity, reflecting the qualitative phenomena described above, is the gas hold-up εg. The gas hold-up is a 
common topic in bubble swarm investigations in literature. Several correlations, mostly based on a physical 
background (e.g., the continuity equation or momentum balance), were suggested (usually based on tests in

cylindrical bubble columns, see, e.g., [162, 163]). Based on these correlations, none of which takes all 
influencing factors into account, several dependencies can be given for the gas hold-up (where the exponent m 
stands for different positive values):

−𝑚 ; this inverse proportionality to the bubble rise velocity is due to the fact that the faster the 
bubbles rise, the faster they leave the column.  
All the following proportionalities can also be explained by this statement:

𝜀𝑔 ~ 𝑑𝐵

−𝑚, 𝑑ℎ
±𝑚 ; as shown in Section 5.1.1 for the single bubble, wB,abs increases with the bubble 
size and the superimposed liquid velocity. Although no significant difference between the two different 
channel depths was found here, in comparison to a freely rising bubble, the bubbles were decelerated by 
the confining geometry. So actually, a negative exponent m would be expected. In literature no clear 
statement was made regarding the influence of the bubble column diameter as its influence is usually 
neglected if it exceeds 0.15 m (which is not the case here). 
 
𝜀𝑔 ~ 𝜎−𝑚, 𝑐𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓
𝑚
 ; the interfacial tension is proportional to the bubble size (𝑑𝐵 ~ √𝜎 and, therefore, 
bubble velocity). A low interfacial tension enhances the break-up of bubbles into smaller bubbles. As 
discussed in Section 4.2, surfactants can lead to a decrease of the interfacial tension. Therefore, 
regarding the influence of the surfactant concentration on the gas hold-up, the logic explained before 
works here as well. Even without an effect on the surface tension, the coalescence hindrance leads to 
smaller bubble sizes in the bubble swarm and, therefore, higher gas hold-ups. 
 
𝜀𝑔 ~ 𝜇−𝑚 ; a higher viscosity of the continuous phase leads to lowered bubble rise velocities which 
actually would lead to a higher gas hold-up. It has to be kept in mind that the viscosity also has an effect 
on the bubble size with dB ~ μ. These two effects combined lead to an inverse proportionality of the gas 
hold-up and viscosity. The respective gas hold-up correlations taking the influence of the viscosity into 
account were derived for Newtonian liquids. As described in Section 5.1.1, in particular for the cases 
with superimposed liquid velocity, a significant deceleration of the bubble was not necessarily found in 
the non-Newtonian liquid phase in comparison to water. Still, Kawase and Moo-Young [164] found 
(although a weak but) basically the same proportionality for non-Newtonian continuous phases with 
𝜀𝑔 ~ (𝐾𝛾𝑛)−𝑚. 
Figure 5.20 shows the results of the gas hold-up for all tested parameter combinations. The results are plotted as 
a function of the gas flow rates which were equal for both channels but resulted in different superficial gas 
velocities (calculated as vg = Qg/(dc∙dw) ) when dc was varied. As discussed above, the gas velocity is typically 
used to explain the gas hold-up behavior. For both channel depths, the respective superficial gas velocities are 
given at the bottom of the figure. Basically, most of the proportionalities discussed above can be found in the 
presented results as well, and the value range is respective to data from literature (e.g., in the already mentioned 
articles [162, 163]). The gas hold-ups found by Yamanoi and Kageyama [55], mentioned in Section 2 as the 
most comparable system to the system investigated in this project, are also in the same range. Still, in contrast to 
this work, Yamanoi and Kageyama

5 Results and discussion 
 
78 
 
The last point is rather surprising keeping the previously discussed proportionalities in mind. 
For the results found here, three things are particularly worth discussing.  
1. For water doped with ions, in cases without superimposed liquid velocity, a maximum gas hold-up is 
achieved at a gas flow rate around 400 L/h for both channels. This is the only case where this behavior 
was found. Ribeiro and Mewes [133] discussed such a behavior as well and found a maximum at a 
comparable superficial gas velocity. This overshooting can be explained with the transition region 
being, by nature, somewhere between homogeneous (narrow bubble size distribution) and 
heterogeneous flow (a rather bimodal bubble size distribution) and, therefore, cannot be described 
exactly. 
2. Regarding the channel depths, for all continuous phases, if plotted against the superficial gas velocity, 
higher gas hold-ups were found for a larger channel depth. The published works are not clear about this. 
At least in case of Xanthan solution, this might be attributable to differing viscosity levels in the two 
different channels as discussed in Section 5.1.4. A smaller channel depth leads to higher shear rates 
(especially in the y-z-plane normal to the confining walls) leading to a lowered viscosity in the liquid, 
and in turn to higher bubble rise velocities and, therefore, a lowered gas hold-up (dc↓ => γ↑ => μ↓ => 
wB↑ => εg↓). 
3. Regarding the viscosity, in comparison to water as continuous phase, in both higher viscosity systems, 
Xanthan solution with and without ions, higher gas hold-ups were found. Obviously, complex 
interactions between the conditions lead to this behavior. According to Wilkinson et al. [155], larger 
bubbles were found in the higher viscosity system. The increase in bubble size did not outbalance the 
decrease of the bubble rise velocity due to enhanced friction in the narrow channel. It has to be stated 
that this is an assumption as neither in the single bubble nor in the bubble swarm case, rise velocities of 
such large bubbles were investigated here. It is known for Taylor bubbles, from a certain size on, to 
have a constant rise velocity independent of the bubble size (see, e.g., [165]). In the intermediate 
viscosity liquid phase (Xanthan solution with ions), higher gas hold-ups were found in comparison to 
the values in Xanthan solution without ions which would be contradictory again to the prior statement. 
But here, as mentioned in the qualitative flow behavior discussion, smaller bubbles (with lower rise 
velocities) were apparent in comparison to the high viscosity system due to an enhanced dynamic flow 
behavior.  
Of the gas hold-up correlations that can be found in literature, Akita and Yoshida’s approach [163, 166]

takes most of the mentioned parameters into account. Still, it lacks the integration of the influence of

To incorporate these parameters,

A parity plot is shown in Figure 5.21 (R² = 0.70). For this correlation, bubble sizes were estimated for the 
different parameter combinations (an average bubble diameter of 10 mm in water with ions, 20 mm in pure water 
and Xanthan solution with ions and 30 mm in Xanthan solution was used). The estimation was based on a 
tentative determination of the bubble size. Accurate measurements of the respective bubble sizes might lead to 
an improved correlation with a higher coefficient of determination. 
Where comparable, the gas hold-up behavior was in accordance with literature. Still, the influences of the 
viscosity and the channel depth show a behavior which cannot be explained to the full extent here. In both 
cases, an increase led to higher gas hold-up values. Obviously, complex interactions of these two parameters, 
with 1. the channel depth affecting the viscosity due to the occurring shear rates, and 2. both parameters 
combined affecting the bubble size and the bubble rise velocity, lead to this gas hold-up behavior. A correlation 
for the gas hold-up which is an extension of an existing model, was found that incorporates all varied 
parameters.

5.2.2 Wall shear stress generated by the bubble swarm 
Finally, the wall shear stress generated by the two-phase flow is discussed (determined with EDM, based on [8]). 
Here, for the first time in this thesis, wall shear stress measurements were conducted in a gas-liquid-system with 
a non-Newtonian continuous liquid phase as well. In the single bubble experiments, the maximum occurring 
wall shear stress and the global wall shear stress level were determined. These wall shear stress measurements 
were performed for discrete bubble passages. Therefore, for each parameter combination, a specific maximum 
wall shear stress and a global wall shear stress level could be determined. This data was presented in box-and-
whisker-plots, as not all of the values were normally distributed. In the bubble swarm experiments, as one can 
see in the bubble patterns in Figure 5.19a to d, a polydisperse bubble swarm and complex flow structures 
(Figure 5.19e to g) can be found in all cases. As described in Section 4.5, for every parameter combination, the 
wall shear stress was measured five times for one second. The combined data of all of these measurements for 
one parameter combination was normally distributed for all cases. Therefore, in contrast to the single bubble 
results, here the average wall shear stress (as the median) and the fluctuations (as the standard deviation) were 
determined. As mentioned in Section 5.1.3, the fluctuations are of special interest with respect to particulate 
deposition layers and biofilms. 
In case of aqueous salt solutions, the wall shear stress can be calculated by the multiplication of the wall shear 
rate with the liquid viscosity (µL = 1.04∙10-3 Pas, see also Table 4.1), which is why both quantities are plotted in 
the same diagram(s). Figure 5.22 shows the results for the performed experiments, with one diagram for each 
channel depth (for clarity reasons, the median values are shown in a bar plot without the fluctuation included). 
Generally, it can be stated that qualitatively the average wall shear stress dependencies on the varied parameters 
were as expected. Increasing wall shear stress median values were found for 
 
a decreasing channel depth due to the enhanced confinement, 
 
an increasing gas flow rate (or superficial gas velocity) due to the pronounced complex flow structures 
generated by the gas in the system and 
 
an increasing co-current liquid velocity due to the generally higher liquid velocity level occurring in 
the bulk liquid and the thin liquid films between the bubbles and the wall. 
In the 7 mm channel, median wall shear stress values up to 1.1 Pa and in the 5 mm channel values up 3.4 Pa 
were found. The increase of the wall shear stress between the two channel depths by a factor of approximately 3 
is rather high considering that the factor between the channel depths is only 1.4. Still, taking the single bubble 
results discussed in Section 5.1.3 into account, such a pronounced difference was, in parts, found there as well 
(see Figure 5.18b, dB = 9 mm, vL = 0.2 m/s). In contrast to the single bubble results of the global wall shear 
stress level where the median ( = 50 % value) was dominated by the superimposed liquid velocity, the median 
wall shear stress values of the bubble swarm were less dominated by the co-current liquid flow.  
Taking the upper probability limit ( = 99 %-quantile) of the global wall shear stress level, found for the single 
bubble, in Figure 5.22 it can be seen that these results agree fairly well with the bubble swarm results. The 
global wall shear stress levels of the 9 mm bubble were chosen for the comparison here as this roughly fits the 
average bubble size found in the aqueous salt solution system as discussed in Section 5.2.1. In case of the 5 mm 
channel, the results of the single bubble for the case with and without superimposed liquid velocity basically 
frame the bubble swarm results. In the case of the 7 mm channel, the 99 % global wall shear stress level is 

5.2 Bubble swarms rising in the flow channel 
 
81 
 
almost equal to the median wall shear stress at the highest gas flow rate and the same superimposed liquid 
velocity like in the single bubble experiment. In comparison to Ducom et al. [54] who found an increase of the 
average wall shear stress by the two-phase flow in comparison to the single phase flow by a factor of up to 4, 
here, factors of 7 to 26 in the 5 mm channel and 4 to 10 in the 7 mm channel were found. Therefore, Ducom et 
al.’s findings cannot be confirmed which might be attributed to a smaller parameter range as their experiments 
were rather focused on the spatial wall shear stress distribution over the wall. In a comparable gas velocity range, 
Yamanoi and Kageyama [55] found average wall shear stresses in a 5 mm channel with values up to 1.4 Pa and 
in a 7 mm channel up to 1.5 Pa. As in their experiments a self-establishing liquid velocity occured, both results 
were found for a superimposed liquid velocity of approximately 0.5 m/s which is 2.5 times higher in comparison 
to the highest liquid velocity tested in this investigation. In spite of the higher superimposed liquid velocities, 
they did not find a significant enhancement of the wall shear stress. In their case, as it was already discussed for 
the gas hold-up in Section 5.2.1, again - rather surprisingly - no significant influence of the channel depth was 
found. Nagaoka et al. [75] also investigated an aerated rectangular cross section and found only average values 
of up to 0.3 Pa although their channel depth was 32 mm and, therefore, they investigated much lower superficial 
gas velocities.  
Generally, the average wall shear stress generated by the bubble swarm in the aqueous salt solution as the 
continuous phase behaves as expected (dc↓, vg↑, vL↑ => τmedian↑) and the value range is in accordance with 
average wall shear stresses reported in literature (roughly 0.5 Pa < τmedian < 3.4 Pa). The significant difference 
between the two tested channel depths is noteworthy, with average wall shear stress values in the narrower 
channel being three times higher. 
Figure 5.23 shows the wall shear rates and wall shear stresses found in the Xanthan solution with ions as the 
continuous phase. Here, the wall shear rates and wall shear stresses are plotted in separate diagrams, as the two 
quantities not only differ by a factor but the wall shear stress has to be calculated with the viscosity as described 
in eq.(4.11). With some exceptions, the wall shear stress again behaves according to expectations regarding the 
varied parameters. Especially for the higher gas flow rates, the effect of the superimposed liquid velocity is not 
as significant as it was found for the Newtonian liquid phase. In contrast to the factor of three between the shear

rates found in water for the two different channel depths, in the non-Newtonian liquid phase approximately a 
factor of 2 was found. Therefore, it can be stated that besides the gas flow rate, the channel depth has the most 
significant effect on the average wall shear rate for both continuous phases. Calculating the wall shear stress in 
the non-Newtonian liquid phase, with a factor of 1.5 between the respective values in the 5 and 7 mm channel 
the effect of the channel depth is reduced. In the 5 mm channel, the highest median wall shear stress values were 
comparable in the Newtonian ( ≈ 3.4 Pa) and non-Newtonian ( ≈ 3.3 Pa) liquid phase. In contrast to the behavior 
in water where a factor between the shear stress value at the highest and lowest gas flow rate was 5 fold, the 
relative difference in the Xanthan solution is less pronounced with a factor of up to 1.5. For these results, no 
cross-links to the previously discussed single bubble experiments can be drawn as the single bubble EDM 
measurement were only performed in aqueous salt solution and the single bubble PIV measurements were 
carried out in Xanthan solution without ions. Still, the result found in Section 5.1.2, i.e., that the shear stress 
occurring in water is twice that in Xanthan solution works here as well for the wall shear stress in the 7 mm 
channel. 
In the literature, the only system that is roughly comparable to the one studied here was investigated by Nagaoka 
et al. [75]. They investigated Newtonian liquids with viscosities up to 15 times higher than that of water. In the 
shear rate range found in this investigation, the Xanthan solution with ions has viscosities 5 to 10 times higher in 
comparison to water. The highest average wall shear stress values Nagaoka et al. found were approximately 2 Pa 
in their 32 mm channel. The value, which was determined at a superficial gas velocity comparable to the lowest

investigated gas velocities in this investigation, is in the same range as the values found here for the narrower 
channels, with 2.5 Pa in the 5 mm channel and 1.8 Pa in the 7 mm channel. 
Like found for the Newtonian continuous phase, in the non-Newtonian liquid the expected dependencies of the 
wall shear stress on the varied parameters were found as well (dc↓, vg↑, vL↑ => τmedian↑). In comparison to the 
tests in water, the wall shear rates γmedian were lower (especially for the 5 mm channel). Still, due to the non-
Newtonian rheological characteristics, the wall shear stresses τmedian were mostly higher (especially for the 
7 mm channel) with a value range of approx. 1.0 Pa < τmedian < 3.4 Pa. As already mentioned for the single 
bubble investigations, again, roughly a factor of two between the values determined in water and Xanthan 
solution (for the 7 mm channel) was found. 
For the experimental results, a mathematical model was developed relating all varied parameters. The 
dimensionless average wall shear stress

developed for this application, and the confinement factor taking the bubble size into account as already used for

was found (R² = 0.90). The regression was performed with the same estimated bubble sizes as used for the gas 
hold-up regression.  
The fluctuations of the wall shear stress were determined as well. In their water based system, Yamanoi and 
Kageyama [55] found that the average wall shear stress values and the respective standard deviations were equal. 
Figure 5.24a shows the standard deviation of the wall shear stress against the average value as found in this

investigation for the Newtonian and non-Newtonian continuous liquid phase and with the bisecting line 
representing Yamanoi and Kageyama’s result. It is obvious that for both cases the slope is lower in comparison 
to the mentioned case from literature with a slope of approximately 0.66 for aqueous salt solution and 0.33 for 
Xanthan solution with ions. The dampened fluctuations in water in comparison to Yamanoi and Kageyama 
might be attributed to the different measurement techniques. They used a shear stress scale which was able to 
determine the direction of the flow as well. Hence, they recorded positive and negative shear stress values. Here, 
only the magnitude of the shear stress could be determined which might have led to a lowered standard deviation 
value in comparison to their results. For the non-Newtonian liquid, the dampening effect was even enhanced 
which can be explained by the higher viscosity level. Still, Yamanoi and Kageyama’s statement of increasing 
wall shear stress fluctuations with increasing average values applies here, too. Based on the average wall shear 
stress and the respective standard deviation, Nagaoka et al. [75] defined an effective maximum wall shear stress 
𝜏𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑒𝑓𝑓= 𝜏𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛+ 3 ∙𝜏𝑠𝑡𝑑 
(5.30) 
which is equal to the probability of occurrence value of 99.7 % in the CDF. Figure 5.24b shows the effective 
maximum wall shear stress τmax,eff against the effective velocity (vg+vL). For their highest superficial gas velocity 
(which was below the lowest gas velocity in this study), they found values for the effective maximum wall shear 
stress of up to 1.5 Pa in water and 8 Pa in the high viscosity Newtonian system. In this study, depending on the 
channel depth and liquid phase, different values were found. For the non-Newtonian liquid phase, in the 5 mm 
channel effective wall shear stress values up to 6.0 Pa and in the 7 mm channel up to 3.5 Pa were found. In the 
Newtonian liquid phase, in the 5 mm channel effective wall shear stress values up to 9.1 Pa and in the 7 mm 
channel up to 2.6 Pa were found. Like done for the average wall shear stress which was compared to the 99 % 
value of the global wall shear stress level determined for the single 9 mm bubble, here, the 99 % value of the 
maximum wall shear stress determined for the single 9 mm bubble is used for comparison with the results from 
the bubble swarm. Again, for both channel depths tested with the aqueous salt solution as the continuous phase, 
the results from the single bubble tests are in good agreement with the bubble swarm results. 
Regarding the fluctuations of the wall shear stress, these increase with the average value. The increase is more 
enhanced in aqueous salt solution in comparison to Xanthan solution with ions due to the generally higher 
viscosity level of the non-Newtonian liquid. This is also due to differing flow behavior in the non-Newtonian 
system as described for the single bubble ascent. Consequently, the effective maximum wall shear stress 
(τmedian+3∙τstd) increased with the effective velocity (vg+vL) as well, and the highest values were found in the 
5 mm channel. The results are also comparable to global wall shear stress level values found in the single 
bubble experiments. 
5.2.3 Conclusions from the bubble swarm experiments 
In this section, the general flow behavior of a bubble swarm rising in a narrow rectangular channel was discussed 
including the gas hold-up and the wall shear stress generated by the liquid. In Table 5.6, the qualitative 
dependencies of the determined quantities on the varied parameters are collected. 
As generally expected, a significant influence of the type of continuous phase was found on both quantities, the 
gas hold-up and the wall shear stress. This again underlines the contradiction to the statement by Ozaki and 
Yamamoto [46] that results found in water are transferable to real MBR systems. For both systems, besides the 

5.3 Engineering recommendations 
 
85 
 
continuous phase, the superficial gas velocity and the channel depth had the most significant influence.  
In case of the gas hold-up experiments, the addition of ions with the purpose of a coalescence hindering led to an 
increase of the gas hold-up due to the reduction of the bubble size. In case of Xanthan solution, the observations 
(and the rheological measurements) indicate that this was less an effect of coalescence hindrance but rather of 
the enhanced dynamics. This more dynamic system was due to a viscosity lowering effect of the ions on the 
Xanthan solution as described in Section 4.2.  
The wall shear stress results integrate fairly well into the context of the available literature regarding the average 
value, the standard deviation and the resulting effective maximum wall shear stress. Additionally, cross-links to 
the single bubble results could be drawn as well. The global wall shear stress level of the largest investigated 
single bubble was comparable to the average wall shear stress results found for the bubble swarm. The same is 
valid for the comparison of the maximum wall shear stress value of the single bubble and the effective maximum 
wall shear stress found for the bubble swarm. 
For both porperties, the gas hold-up and the wall shear stress, a significant influence of the channel depth, 
superficial gas velocity and the type of continuous phase was found. For the gas hold-ups, the highest value of 
0.57 was found for an aqueous salt solution. In most other cases the values were between 0.2 and 0.4. The 
highest effective maximum wall shear stress was found for an aqueous salt solution with τmedian+3∙τstd = 9.1 Pa 
(due to an enhanced fluctuation in comparison to the results in Xanthan solution with ions) and for Xanthan 
solution with ions with τmedian+3∙τstd = 6.0 Pa, both in the 5 mm channel. 
5.3 Engineering recommendations 
In this section, the results found in this study are related to the application of interest, a flat sheet MBR operated 
as an air-lift loop reactor.  
First of all, a short-cut method is suggested to calculate the average wall shear stress occurring in a flat sheet 
system. For bubble columns, Zehner [161] derived an equation for the liquid circulation velocity wf,c

(5.31) 
which is the main flow velocity in a (cylindrical) bubble column with circulation cells. In eq.(5.31), D is the 
column diameter following the idea that the height of the circulation cells is in the range of the column diameter. 
In case of the rectangular cross section column in this investigation, as discussed in Section 5.2.1, qualitative 
observations showed that the circulation cell height is in the range of the width of the channel (here dw = 0.16 m).

Therefore, in this case, the liquid circulation velocity is calculated with the width of the channel, i.e., the bubble 
column diameter D is replaced by dw in eq.(5.31). To calculate a representative shear rate for such a system, a 
characteristic length is needed as well. For this characteristic length, the film thickness between the bubbles and 
the wall is suggested here. For Taylor bubbles rising in a circular duct, Llewellin et al. [167] found an equation 
for the film thickness λ

depending on several bubble and liquid properties. A film thickness roughly in the range of λest = dc/20 can be 
derived from this equation. Therefore, the estimated shear rate γest can be calculated by the following equation

which actually does not take a superimposed liquid velocity into account. Still, as this is only an estimate and as 
the differences between the results for different superimposed liquid velocities were not too strongly 
pronounced, this equation can still be used. The respective shear stress τest is calculated as 
𝜏𝑒𝑠𝑡= 𝐾𝛾𝑒𝑠𝑡

(5.34) 
Figure 5.22 (for water with ions) and Figure 5.23 (for Xanthan solution with ions) show the experimentally 
determined wall shear stresses (as already discussed in Section 5.2.2) together with estimated shear rates and 
shear stresses calculated from eq.(5.33) and (5.34). In all cases, the estimations give a good idea about the 
occurring shear stresses, with an underestimation of the values for the 5 mm channel in water by a factor of 0.66 
and an overestimation in all other cases (including the cases with Xanthan solution as the continuous phase) by a 
factor 1.3 to 1.5. In spite of the fact that the values do not perfectly fit the experimental data, this simple 
calculation can still be used to get an idea about the wall shear stress occurring in such aerated systems. 
As the second deduction, especially with respect to the economical aspect of the aeration cost, Figure 5.25

illustrates the relative change of the occurring average wall shear stress against the respective relative change of 
the gas velocity. To explain this plot, as an example, a calculation can be done: increasing the gas velocity in a 
7 mm channel from vg = 0.025 m/s to vg = 0.05 m/s (relative change of 100 %) leads to a change of the median 
wall shear stress from τmedian = 0.41 Pa to τmedian = 0.49 Pa (relative change of 20 %). Roughly, it can be seen that 
a relative increase of the gas velocity leads to a lower relative increase of the average wall shear stress with a 
factor 0.3 for water and 0.15 for Xanthan solution. In numbers, this means, e.g., that a relative increase of the gas 
velocity by 100 % leads to an average wall shear stress increase of 30 % in water and 15 % in Xanthan solution. 
As the Xanthan solution behavior is closer to that of real activated sludge, this rather minor influence of a gas 
velocity change indicates that the construction aspect channel depth and the construction and operation aspect 
bubble size have a stronger influence on the cleaning potential of the system. This is an important information as 
the aeration costs are proportional to the compressor power input necessary for the aeration and, therefore, to the 
superficial gas velocity (operational cost ~ P = QgΔp = vgAΔp ~ vg). 
For the commercially available flat sheet membrane systems (data collected in Prieske et al. [17]), the respective 
average wall shear stress was calculated based on the developed wall shear stress correlation eq.(5.29). Figure 
5.26 shows the shear stress results for the different systems (including the assumption of an intermediate 
superimposed liquid velocity of 0.1 m/s for all cases and a bubble size of 5 mm for the fine bubbling, 20 mm for 
the coarse bubbling and 10 mm where no information is given). The two systems with the highest shear stresses 
mainly show these results due to the coarse bubbling. This statement is underlined by Figure 5.27 which shows 
the sensitivity of the average wall shear stress on the bubble size, the sum of the gas and liquid velocity, the flow 
consistency index and the hydraulic diameter (based on eq.(5.27) to (5.29); calculated with n=0.54). In the range 
of the varied parameters, the bubble size and the hydraulic diameter have the most significant influence.

5 Results and discussion 
 
88 
 
Although the gas velocity is the only property of the aforementioned ones that can be controlled during the 
operation of the flat sheet membrane module, this result rather suggests focusing beforehand on the 
constructional aspects. This includes not only the module itself but also the air sparger type as it, i.a., controls the 
appearing bubble sizes. Besides the resulting hypothesis that increasing gas flow rates (directly related to the 
operational cost) do not significantly affect the appearing shear stresses, the suggested larger bubble sizes 
potentially lead to lower operational cost as well. Larger bubbles lead overall to a lower surface area which is 
equivalent to lowered need of energy in comparison to the case with small bubbles and therefore a larger surface 
area.  
Finally, following Drews et al.’s [33] approach of the calculation of a critical particle diameter (introduced in 
Section 2) above which the respective particles are detached from the membrane surface due to the occurring 
wall shear stress, Figure 5.28 was assembled. Whenever the drag force Fdrag 
which occurs due to a flux J normal to the membrane surface is lower than the lift force Flift 
𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑓𝑡= 0.761 𝜏1.5𝑑𝑃
3𝜌0.5
𝜇
 
(2.2) 
the particle with the respective diameter will be drawn into the bulk flow away from the deposition layer on the 
membrane. Several assumptions had to be made to determine the critical particle diameters: 
 
a critical flux Jcrit of 8 L/(m²h) which was mentioned in the tests reported by Drews et al. [33]  
o 
although not consistently determined in published work, the critical flux is generally regarded 
as the flux, from which on a further increase leads to an enhanced fouling tendency [19] 
 
a superficial liquid velocity of 0.2 m/s (which is equal to the highest velocity used in this study) 
 
in case of Xanthan solution, an intermediate viscosity at an respective intermediate shear rate of 
1000 s-1 calculated as μX,ave = 0.065∙(1000)-0.46 Pas = 0.0027 Pas 
 
an effective maximum wall shear stress value as determined in this study (see Figure 5.24b)

(2.1) 

5.3 Engineering recommendations

The factor between the critical diameter found for water and Xanthan solution can be up to seven. In water, 
much smaller particles (dP = 0.15 μm in the 5 mm channel, dP = 0.45 μm in the 7 mm channel) can be detached 
in comparison to the higher viscosity non-Newtonian system (dP = 0.65 μm in the 5 mm channel, dP = 1.0 μm in 
the 7 mm channel). On the one hand side, in water a higher effective maximum wall shear stress was found, and 
on the other hand, in Xanthan solution the drag force is also higher in comparison to that in water due to the 
higher viscosity. 
As described by Drews [19], a detachment of all particles above a fairly low particle diameter does not 
necessarily lead to a more economical performance in the long run. A deposition layer consisting of very small 
particles leads to a higher resistance in comparison to a deposition layer consisting of larger particles.  
In this section, a short-cut method was suggested to calculate the average wall shear stress occurring in a narrow 
aerated system with a rectangular cross section. The comparison with the empirically determined wall shear 
stresses proved its applicability. Theoretically, a critical particle diameter that would be detached by the wall 
shear stress was evaluated. An estimation of the quality of commercial systems with respect to their cleaning 
potential was discussed as well. It was shown that especially in non-Newtonian systems, the effect of a stronger 
aeration does not reflect in same manner in the occurring wall shear stress. This leads to the suggestion to rather 
use a smaller channel depth or increase the occurring bubble size (at the same gas flow rate; construction 
aspects) than increase the gas flow which leads to high operation costs.

6 Summary 
6.1 Conclusions 
This study of the fluid dynamics in a gas-liquid-system inspired by a flat sheet membrane bioreactor was 
motivated by the fact that aeration is one of the main operation cost factors in such systems. This makes MBRs 
economically not competitive to conventional waste water treatment. One of the main purposes of the aeration is 
the cleaning of the membrane surfaces. The cleaning is due to the liquid flows generated by the bubble 
movement. These liquid flows between the membrane plates result in shear forces acting on the deposition 
layers, lifting particles back into the bulk flow and/or detaching biofilms from the membrane surface. 
Commercially available flat sheet membrane systems differ, i.a., in the spacing between the flat sheet 
membranes (in this study called channel depth), the recommended aeration intensity and the bubble size. This 
shows that - besides the commonly acknowledged positive effect of aeration on the operation of such 
systems - no commonly agreed understanding of the cleaning process is present in this field. 
In this thesis, the chosen approach was to start with a fundamental investigation of a single bubble rising in a 
narrow channel with a rectangular cross section which represents the geometry between two flat sheet membrane 
plates in a flat sheet membrane module. This single bubble ascent in such a confining geometry, not yet 
sufficiently discussed in literature, was investigated for approximately 88 parameter combinations with varied 
channel depth, bubble size, superimposed liquid velocity and type of continuous phase with three different 
measurement techniques. In literature, channel depths in a range close to the bubble size and with co-current 
liquid velocities as influencing factors are rarely investigated. Regarding the continuous phase, a literature 
statement that results from fluid dynamic investigations performed in water are transferrable to real waste water 
systems was to be scrutinized. This added up to an experimental investigation of a total of approximately 45,000 
single bubble ascents. Such a high number of runs was possible due to a fully automated experimental set-up 
allowing a sufficient statistical analysis of the data. The applied measurement techniques were high speed 
camera imaging (HSC) for the investigation of the bubble behavior, particle image velocimetry (PIV) for the 
investigation of the liquid flow surrounding the rising bubble and the electrodiffusion method (EDM) for the 
determination of the wall shear stress generated by the bubble induced liquid flows.  
In comparison to the behavior of freely rising bubbles often discussed in literature, it was found that the behavior 
in the system investigated here can still be described by similar correlations. This was possible in spite of the 
confining geometry, superimposed liquid velocities and non-Newtonian liquid phases. Especially in case of the 
dimensionless correlations, the complex interaction between the bubble deformation, the bubble oscillation and 
the respective rise velocity leads to comparable trends. The channel depth and superimposed liquid velocity 
show a complex interaction (e.g., in water at vL = 0 m/s: dc ↑ => wB,rel ↑, at vL = 0.2 m/s: dc ↑ => wB,rel ↓). This can 
potentially be attributed to a changed rising behavior as indicated by the determined oscillation parameters 
frequency and amplitude. The bubble-surrounding liquid velocities, determined in the PIV experiments, 
show that not only due to the bubble size itself but also due to their rising and deformation behavior, a much 
larger bubble-surrounding liquid volume is affected by larger bubbles in comparison to smaller bubbles. 

6.1 Conclusions 
 
91 
 
Remembering the purpose of the bubble to clean membranes covered with deposition layers, this simply means 
that larger bubbles have the potential to clean a larger membrane surface area.  
In spite of differing flow patterns around the bubble in water and Xanthan solution, the occurring shear rates in 
the liquid surrounding the bubble were still in the same value range. The shear rates in the Xanthan solution were 
about twice as high in comparison to values in water. Due to the difference of the rheology, the occurring shear 
stresses are off by an order of magnitude and more.  
In the EDM experiments, it was found that with increasing bubble size and decreasing channel depth, the global 
wall shear stress level increases and the fluctuations are promoted. Generally, the rising bubble increases the 
shear stress values significantly in comparison to the single-phase flow but the median value is not affected. The 
highest maximum wall shear stress values found for the single bubbles are in parts higher by an order of 
magnitude in comparison to the global wall shear stress level. 
Of all the varied parameters, the bubble size was found to have the strongest impact on the single bubble ascent. 
Most other parameters did not affect the quantities as much as expected, e.g., by the confining geometry and, 
especially, the rheology of the continuous phase. This includes the shear rate results in the liquid surrounding the 
single bubble. Still, the viscosity of the non-Newtonian liquid phase influenced the rising behavior from a 
qualitative point of view and led to shear stresses which were significantly higher in comparison to the ones 
found in water.  
After the fundamental investigation of the single bubble ascent in the confining geometry, the bubble swarm 
behavior was investigated in the same geometry. Here again, high speed camera imaging (HSC) to investigate 
the bubble swarm behavior and the electrodiffusion method (EDM) to determine the wall shear stress generated 
by the bubble induced liquid flows were applied. Although bubble swarms are a common topic in engineering 
literature, this particular geometry is rather uncommon and respective correlations are rare. So the results found 
in this investigation are put into perspective of existing (cylindrical) bubble column literature and new 
correlations are given where applicable. Qualitatively, it was found that the influence of the continuous phase is 
strongly pronounced with larger bubbles occurring in the higher viscous liquid and smaller bubbles occurring in 
the cases doped with ions (for coalescence hindrance). Additionally, the bubble ascent in the bubble swarm is 
strongly affected by the superimposed liquid velocity reducing the tendency for circulation cells to occur. 
Generally, the gas hold-up behavior was in accordance with bubble column literature. Still, viscosity and channel 
depth show a complex interaction on the gas hold-up behavior (an increase of either leads to higher gas hold-up 
values). In Xanthan solution, the channel depth affects the viscosity due to the occurring shear rates, and both 
parameters combined affect the bubble size and the bubble ascent. A correlation for the gas hold-up which is an 
extension of an existing model was derived that incorporates all varied parameters. 
The dependencies of average wall shear stresses generated by the bubble swarm on the varied parameters were 
found as expected and the value range was in accordance with average wall shear stresses reported in literature. 
The significant difference between the two tested channel depths is noticeable, with average wall shear stress 
values in the narrower channel being higher three times (for aqueous salt solution). In comparison to the tests in 
water, in Xanthan solution with ions the wall shear rates were lower (especially for the 5 mm channel). On the 
other hand, the wall shear stresses were higher (especially for the 7 mm channel), again twice as high in Xanthan 
solution (for the 7 mm channel). The fluctuations of the wall shear stress increased along with the average value. 
This increase is more pronounced in the aqueous salt solution in comparison to Xanthan solution with ions. This 

6 Summary 
 
92 
 
is due to the generally higher viscosity level. Consequently, the effective maximum wall shear stress increased 
with the effective velocity as well. 
For both, the gas hold-up and the wall shear stress, a significant influence of the superficial gas velocity, the type 
of continuous phase and - in contrast to the single bubble experiments - also of the channel depth was found. The 
highest effective maximum wall shear stress was 9.1 Pa for aqueous salt solution (due to an enhanced fluctuation 
in comparison to the results in Xanthan solution with ions) and 6.0 Pa for Xanthan solution with ions, both in the 
5 mm channel. These values can be fairly well related to the maximum wall shear stress results from the single 
bubble tests with comparable bubble sizes. 
Based on the achieved knowledge, engineering recommendations were given regarding the cleaning potential. A 
short-cut method was suggested to calculate the average wall shear stress occurring in a narrow aerated system 
with a rectangular cross section. The comparison with the empirically determined wall shear stresses proved its 
applicability. An estimation of the quality of commercial systems with respect to their cleaning potential was 
done and it was shown that especially in non-Newtonian systems, the effect of a stronger aeration does not 
reflect in same manner in the occurring wall shear stress. This leads to the suggestion to rather use a smaller 
channel depth or increase the bubble size (construction aspects) than to increase the gas flow which leads to high 
operation costs. 
6.2 Outlook 
Regarding the single bubble experiments, it would be interesting to investigate the rise of a single bubble in a 
Newtonian liquid phase where the resulting bubble Reynolds number is in the same range as the bubble 
Reynolds number found for the ascent in the non-Newtonian liquid phase. Thus, it would be possible to 
determine specifically, on a quantitative base, the influence of the non-Newtonian characteristics in comparison 
to the Newtonian case at the same Reynolds number.  
To get an even broader understanding of the respective influences, the experimental matrix of the varied 
parameters and their ranges could be expanded. This applies specifically for the bubble sizes where - with 
respect to the bubble swarm - larger bubble sizes could be investigated.  
Regarding the measurement techniques, a parallel measurement with all three applied measurement techniques 
(like it was done, e.g., by Jankhah and Bérubé in a comparable system [64]) could give additional information 
about the bubble behavior. With such a setup, e.g., the maximum occurring shear stress value could be 
associated with the position of the bubble relative to the EDM sensor, the respective oscillation phase and the 
liquid flow generated at this exact moment. Regarding the HSC and PIV measurements, an investigation with 
multiple cameras would give an even more precise picture of the process of the bubble ascent, allowing a 3D-
reconstruction of the bubble shape and a determination of the 3D-flow field around the bubble. For the PIV 
measurements in particular, a 3D-time-resolved measurement of the near wall flow field would be of interest as 
it could be used to quantify the wall shear rate that could be compared to the EDM results. Additionally, such an 
investigation could be used to determine the liquid film thickness between the bubble and the wall, to adjust the 
correlation presented in Section 5.3 (for Taylor bubbles in circular ducts) to this case. Having mentioned all of 
this, the necessary measurement technique for such an investigation would be very expensive and regarding the 
quantitative result, the benefit would probably not be justified by the investment.  

6.2 Outlook 
 
93 
 
In case of the EDM measurements, besides the potential control measurement with PIV, a shear stress scale 
could be used like done by a few other groups in this field (e.g., [55, 75]). For a better understanding of the near 
wall flows, a three segmented EDM sensor could be used for the measurements (as suggested, e.g., by [168]) 
which allows the determination of the wall shear stress and the liquid flow direction at the same time. This could 
be used to determine flow reversals in the liquid film between the bubble and the wall or in the wake of the 
bubble due to the occurring vortices in the Kármán vortex street. 
Regarding the bubble swarm, the influence of the channel width should be tested as in a real system this 
dimension is larger. The flow channel was mainly constructed to ensure a negligible effect of the side walls on 
the bubble ascent in the single bubble experiments and to make it comparable to tests in a pseudo-2D-model of a 
flat sheet membrane module existing in the laboratory  (used, e.g., in [17]).  
In the existing flow channel, first of all lower gas flow rates ( < 100 L/h) could be tested. The gas flow rates 
applied in this study were based on SADm values found for commercial products. Recalculated to the superficial 
gas velocity, this led to fairly high values in comparison to superficial gas velocities occurring in real systems 
(although it is not exactly known which cross section area the gas flow rate was related to in [17]). 
Regarding recent developments in the field, the influence of differently designed spacers (as suggested, e.g., by 
[24]), intermittent and alternating aeration (as, e.g., done by Jankhah and Bérubé [64]) and the operation as a 
fluidized bed (see, e.g., [31]) could be evaluated.  
Regarding the measurement techniques, first of all the gas hold-up measurements could be validated by parallel 
pressure difference measurements. As the bubble size was included in the correlations found for the bubble 
swarm quantities, either the measurements with the high speed camera should be more specifically designed for 
this purpose or another measurement technique should be applied (like, e.g., optical probes [169] although the 
strong deformation rather suggests adjusted imaging techniques [170]). 
For the single bubble and bubble swarm experiments, a parallel filtration might be of interest as well since, e.g., 
Gaucher et al. [50] found higher shear stresses in case with filtration. In general, the addition of solid 
particles - either with the purpose of generating a fluidized bed as mentioned before or to have a suspension that 
could be filtered and, therefore, generate a deposition layer - can have an effect on the occurring bubbles as well, 
as described in Section 4.2, and therefore the general behavior of the system. 
Finally, after the investigation of a single bubble in a single flow channel and a bubble swarm in the single flow 
channel, the EDM measurement technique could be applied in the pseudo-2D-model of a complete flat sheet 
membrane module mentioned above. This could be used to evaluate if in this system comparable shear stress 
values are found (which can be expected) and how the shear stress is distributed over the module taking a non-
uniform aeration into account.
