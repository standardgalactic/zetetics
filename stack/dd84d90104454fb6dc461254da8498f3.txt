1. Implication
The statement “p implies q” means that if p is true, then q
must also be true. The statement “p implies q” is also written
“if p then q” or sometimes “q if p.” Statement p is called the
premise of the implication and q is called the conclusion.
Example 1. Each of the following statements is an implication:
(1) If you score 85% or above in this class, then you will get an
A.
(2) If the U.S. discovers that the Taliban Government is in-
volved in the terrorist attack, then it will retaliate against
Afghanistan.
(3) My thumb will hurt if I hit it with a hammer,
(4) x = 2 implies x + 1 = 3.
You can view Statement 1 above as a promise. It says
You are guaranteed an A provided you score 85% or above.
Suppose you score a 90% in the class. If your ﬁnal grade is an
A, then the promise was kept and Statement 1 is true. If your
grade is not an A, then the promise was broken and Statement 1
is false.
But what if you do not score 85% or above? Is Statement 1
true or false in this case? Statement 1 does not say what grade
you will receive if you score less than 85%. If you score 75% in
the class and receive a B, you cannot complain that the promise
was broken. If you score 84% and end up with an A, you still
cannot say that the promise was broken.
When the premise p of the implication “p implies q” is false,
we are forced into a corner. We cannot say that the implication
is false, yet we have no evidence that it is true—because p didn’t

happen. This situation is reminiscent of the following dialogue
from the Three Stooges:
Larry: I couldn’t say ‘yes’ and I couldn’t say ‘no’.
Curly: Could you say ‘maybe’?
Larry: I might.
Moe: [Hits them both on the head.]
Logicians have decided to take an “innocent until proven guilty”
stance on this issue. An if—then statement is considered true
until proven false. Since we cannot call the statement p implies
q false when p is false, our only alternative is to call it true.
So the chart for implies is:
The if—then Chart:
p

We emphasize again the surprising fact that
a false statement implies anything.
Example 2.
(1) Does 2 = 3 imply 2 + 1 = 3 + 1?
Yes, it’s an example of the rule x = y implies x + 1 = y + 1.
(2) Does 2 = 3 imply 2 · 0 = 3 · 0?
Yes, it’s an example of the rule x = y implies xz = yz.
Example 3. Consider the following implications
(1) If elephants can ﬂy, then the Cubs will win the World Series
this year.

(2) If elephants can ﬂy, then the Cubs will lose the World Series
this year.
Both statements are true—assuming, of course, that elephants
can’t ﬂy.
Warning to die hard Cubs fans: please do not take Statement 1
too seriously and push elephants out of trees, hoping that one
might ﬂy.
Example 4. Consider the following implications
(1) If hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
are combined, then table salt (NaCl) will be produced.
(2) If March has 31 days, then dogs are mammals.
Both statements are true. The ﬁrst statement is an example of
cause and eﬀect and reﬂects the chemical equation
HCl + NaOH = NaCl + H2O.
In the second statement, there is clearly no causal relation be-
tween days of the month and dogs being mammals. Both the
premise and the conclusion of Statement 2 are true, so according
to the chart, the implication is true. The point here is that the
use of implies in logic is very diﬀerent from its use in everday
language to reﬂect causality.
From the chart we see that the implication if p then q is false
when it happens that p is true, but q is false. This leads us to
the surprising conclusion that
the negation of an implication is an and statement.
The negation of the statement
p implies q
is the statement
p and not q.

Example 5.
(1) The negation of
if I hit my thumb with a hammer, then my thumb
will hurt
is
I hit my thumb with a hammer and my thumb does
not hurt.
(2) The negation of
if Sosa is traded, then Cubs attendance will drop
is
Sosa is traded and the Cubs attendance does not
drop.
Example 6. The Four Card Problem
You are shown one side of four cards. You are told that each card
has a number on one side and a letter on the other side. You are
to test the rule:
if a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even number on
the other side.
You want to ﬁnd out whether the rule is true or false. What are
the only cards you need to turn over to test the rule (and why)
if the cards pictured in front of you are:
E
K

The converse of the statement
p implies q
is the statement
q implies p.
Example 7. The converse of
if an elephant walks in Mom’s garden, then her tomato plants

will be ruined
is
if Mom’s tomato plants are ruined, then an elephant was walking
in her garden.
It is clear from this example that a statement is not logically
equivalent to its converse. There could be other causes for ruined
tomato plants besides promenading pachyderms.
The inverse of the statement
p implies q
is the statement
not p implies not q.
The contapositive of the statement
p implies q
is the statement
not q implies not p.
Example 8.
Statement:
If the gloves ﬁt, then the jury will acquit.
Converse:
If the jury acquits, then the gloves ﬁt.
Inverse:
If the gloves don’t ﬁt, then the jury won’t acquit.
Contrapositive:
If the jury doesn’t acquit, then the gloves don’t ﬁt.
It can be shown by using truth charts that
a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive
and
the converse is logically equivalent to the inverse.

Example 9. The statement
if I hit my thumb with a hammer, then my thumb will hurt
is logically equivalent to
if my thumb doesn’t hurt, then I didn’t hit is with a hammer.
Example 10. Stated as an if–then sentence, the Golden Rule
becomes
if you want other people to act in a certain way to
you, then you should act that way towards them.
The inverse of the Golden Rule is
if you don’t want other people to act in a certain way
to you, then you should not act that way towards
them.
Many people consider the inverse (or equivalently, the converse)
of the Golden Rule to be a more reasonable moral law.

p if and only if
q

The biconditional p if and only if q is logically equivalent to
saying p implies q and q implies p.
Example 11. You are eligible to vote in a United States election
if and only if you are a United States citizen, 18 years or older,
and not a convicted felon.

The answer to the four-card problem is: you only need to turn
over cards ‘E’ and ‘7’.
