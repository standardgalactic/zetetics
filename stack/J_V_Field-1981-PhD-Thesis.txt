Abstract 
KEPLER'S 
GEOMETRICAL 
COSMOLOGY 
by Judith 
Veronica 
Field 
As a deeply 
religious, 
if 
not 
quite 
orthodox, 
Lutheran 
and 
a convinced 
Platonist, 
Kepler 
saw 
the 
Universe 
as the 
outward 
expression 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
Christian 
God. 
More 
radically, 
he 
interpreted 
Plato's 
Timaeus 
as a 
philosophical 
commentary 
on the 
book 
of 
Genesis. 
The 
purpose 
of 
my study 
of 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
work 
is 
to 
examine 
its 
relation 
both 
to 
the 
ideas 
and 
methods 
of 
Timaeus 
and 
to 
the 
ideas 
and 
methods 
of 
Kepler's 
other 
work. 
Chapter 
I 
discusses 
some aspects 
of 
Timaeus. 
Chapter 
II 
is 
concerned 
with 
Kepler's 
belief 
that 
the 
Universe 
is 
finite 
and 
that 
the 
Solar 
system 
is 
of 
unique 
cosmological 
significance. 
Chapter 
III 
analyses 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(1596) 
in 
terms 
of 
Kepler's 
avowed 
purpose 
in 
writing 
it, 
namely 
as ä contribution 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Copernican 
system 
and 
as a presentation 
and 
defence 
of 
the 
cosmological 
theory 
that 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
five 
convex 
regular 
polyhedra 
described 
in 
Euclid's 
Elements. 
Chapter 
IV 
considers 
the'second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(1621). 

3 
Chapter 
V is 
concerned 
with 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V 
(1619). 
This 
work 
is 
mathematically 
more 
sophisticated 
than 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
and 
its 
development 
of 
the 
original 
theory 
is 
in 
closer 
agreement 
with 
the 
observations. 
Chapter 
VI 
assesses 
the 
nature 
of 
Kepler's 
belief 
in 
the 
final 
form 
of 
his 
cosmological 
theory. 
The 
conclusion 
is 
that 
his 
criteria 
for 
accepting 
a cosmological 
theory 
were 
not 
very 
different 
from 
his 
criteria 
for 
accepting 
an astronomical 
theory: 
it 
had 
to 
be philosophically 
satisfying 
and 
in 
adequate 
agreement 
with 
observation.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
I wish 
to 
thank 
my supervisor, 
Professor 
A. R. Hall, 
and 
his 
wife, 
Dr. 
M. B. 
Hall, 
for 
their 
kindly 
guidance 
of 
my research. 
I 
have 
been 
saved 
from 
many a scholarly 
sin 
(of 
omission 
or 
commission) 
by my supervisor's 
wide 
learning 
and 
his 
skill 
in 
divining 
whether 
I 
actually 
required 
technical 
help, 
mere 
encouragement 
or 
a 
reference 
to 
a good 
book. 
I 
am grateful 
to 
the 
Science 
Museum 
for 
its 
financial 
support 
of 
my studies, 
and 
to 
several 
of 
my colleagues 
for 
their 
moral 
and 
practical 
support. 
Michael 
Wright 
made me an elliptical 
template 
for 
figures 
4.1 
and 
5.12, 
and 
Patricia 
Walker 
drew 
all 
the 
more 
difficult 
diagrams. 
Lastly, 
I wish 
to 
take 
this 
opportunity 
of 
acknowledging 
the 
help 
and 
encouragement 
I 
received 
from 
my dear 
friend 
the 
late 
Dr Arthur 
Beer, 
who introduced 
me to 
Kepler 
by 
getting 
me to 
do some of 
the 
translation 
work 
for 
the 
Kepler 
volume 
of 
Vistas 
in 
Astronomy. 
Dr Beer 
was 
a man 
who thought 
deeply 
about 
things, 
and 
his 
long 
experience 
of 
astronomical 
research 
and 
human 
nature 
has 
helped 
me 
immensely 
in 
coping 
with 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
and 
with 
the 
twentieth. 
Was kann 
der 
Mensch 
im Leben 
mehr 
gewinnen, 
Als 
daß 
sich 
Gott-Natur 
ihm 
offenbare? 
Wie 
sie 
das 
Feste 
läßt 
zu Geist 
verrinnen, 
Wie 
sie 
das 
Geisterzeugte 
fest 
bewahre.

INTRODUCTION 
The 
massive 
summing 
up of 
current 
research 
upon 
Kepler 
which 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
volume 
of 
Vistas 
in 
I 
Astronomy 
(Beer 
& Beer, 
1975) 
that 
records 
the 
numerous 
international 
symposia 
which 
marked 
the 
four-hundredth 
anniversary 
of 
his 
birth, 
shows 
clearly 
that 
the 
great- 
est 
emphasis 
is 
still, 
as 
it 
always 
seems 
to 
have 
been, 
upon 
Kepler's 
derivation 
of 
the 
three 
astronomical 
laws 
which 
bear 
his 
name. 
My own study 
has 
been 
concerned 
with 
a part 
of 
Kepler's 
work 
which, 
in 
itself, 
has 
proved 
to 
be of 
less 
lasting 
significance, 
namely 
his 
attempt 
to 
explain 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Universe 
as 
a whole. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
is 
within 
the 
context 
of 
such 
an 
explanation, 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(Tübingen, 
1596), 
that 
Kepler 
gives 
his 
first 
analyses 
of 
the 
astronomical 
problems 
whose 
solution 
was 
to 
lead 
to 
the 
three 
laws, 
and 
some 
scholars, 
most 
notably 
Koyre 
(1961), 
have 
regarded 
the 
work 
in 
which 
the 
analyses 
are 
embedded 
as worthy 
of 
serious 
consideration. 
In 
fact, 
as Kepler 
himself 
noted 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(Frankfurt, 
1621), 
the 
form 
of 
these 
early 
analyses 
proved 
to 
be a fruitful 
one: 
"almost 
every 
one 
of 
the 
astronomical 
works 
I 
have 
written 
since 
that 
time 
could 
be referred 
to 
some 
particular 
chapter 
of 
this 
little 
book, 
and 
be seen 
to 
contain 
either 
an 
illustration 
or 
a completion 
of 
what 
it 
says...

As it 
turned 
out, 
the 
astronomical 
analyses 
which 
led 
Kepler 
to 
his 
first 
two 
laws 
proved 
to 
be separable- 
from 
the 
context 
of 
the 
architectonic 
theory 
in which 
they 
had 
first 
arisen, 
just 
as his 
third 
law 
proved 
to 
be separable 
from 
the 
rather 
similar 
work 
in 
which 
it 
first 
appears, 
namely 
the 
elaborate 
study 
of 
the 
mathematically 
harmonious 
nature 
of 
the 
Universe 
in 
Harmonic'es 
Mundi 
Libri 
V (Linz, 
1619). 
There 
is 
thus 
a certain 
degree 
of 
justification 
for 
the 
positivist 
attitude 
of 
the 
numerous 
historians 
who have 
apparently 
been 
content 
to 
study 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
almost 
exclusively 
for 
its 
intimations 
of 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova 
that 
is 
to 
come, 
and 
to 
look 
upon 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V as no more 
than 
a rather 
antiquated 
setting 
for 
its 
one 
jewel, 
the 
third 
law. 
I 
cannot 
see, 
however, 
that 
there 
is 
any 
obvious 
justification 
for 
the 
con- 
comitant 
assumption 
that 
the 
other' 
elements 
in 
these 
two works 
are 
not 
worthy 
of 
serious 
attention 
- an 
assumption 
which 
modern 
historians 
may perhaps 
have 
inherited 
from 
some 
of 
Kepler's 
more 
influential 
seven- 
teenth 
and 
eighteenth 
century 
readers 
(though 
we should 
also 
note 
that 
there 
were 
enough 
contemporary 
readers 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
for 
the 
work 
to 
go 
into 
a second 
edition, 
at 
a date 
when 
its 
purely 
astronomical 
chapters 
had 
been 
superseded 
by 
the 
author's 
later 
works). 
I 
suspect, 
also, 
that 
since 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
works, 
like 
his 
astronomical 
ones, 
require 
their 
readers 
to 
have 
a command 
of 
mathematics 
and 
astronomy 
most 
usually 
found 
only 
in 
a historian 
whose 
early 
training 
was 
in 
Science, 
.F 

17 
they 
have 
on the 
whole 
attracted 
scholars 
whose 
initial 
interest 
relates 
to 
that 
part 
of 
Kepler's 
work 
which 
they 
know 
from 
their 
earlier 
training, 
namely 
the 
three 
astronomical 
laws. 
The 
neglect 
of 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
theories 
by 
the 
cosmologists 
of 
following 
generations 
must 
be at 
least 
partly 
attributed 
to 
the 
development 
of 
ideas 
about 
the 
Cosmos 
that 
is 
described 
by Koyre 
(1957) 
in 
From 
the 
Closed 
World 
to 
the 
Infinite 
Universe. 
In 
this 
develop- 
ment, 
Kepler 
stands 
out 
as a supporter 
of 
the 
older 
ideas, 
at 
least 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
believing 
that 
the 
Solar 
system 
was 
a uniquely 
important 
component 
of 
the 
Universe. 
I 
have 
felt 
it 
necessary 
to 
review 
both 
Koyre's 
and 
Kepler's 
arguments 
in 
Chapter 
II 
below, 
since 
it 
is 
Kepler's 
belief 
in 
the 
special 
cosmological 
status 
of 
the 
Sun 
that 
made him 
see 
cosmological 
significance 
in 
a feature 
of 
the 
Copernican 
theory 
which 
Copernicus 
himself 
had 
treated 
rather 
casually, 
namely, 
the 
fact 
that 
since 
the 
Ptolemaic 
deferents 
of 
the 
inferior 
planets 
have 
now become 
reflections 
of 
the 
heliostatic 
orbit 
of 
the 
Earth, 
as have 
also 
the 
epicycles 
of 
the 
superior 
planets, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
use 
astronomical 
methods 
to 
calculate 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
Copernican 
orbs 
(whereas 
the 
sizes 
of 
the 
Ptolemaic 
orbs 
were 
merely 
deduced 
from 
the 
physical 
assumption 
that 
they 
were 
arranged 
in 
a 
certain 
order 
and 
were 
all 
in 
contact 
with 
one 
another). 
Since 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
theories 
are 
largely 
concerned 
with 
explaining 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs, 
and 
later 
the 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets 
as 
seen 
from 
the 
Sun, 

18 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
his 
Copernicanism 
is 
as 
fundamental 
to 
his 
cosmology 
as 
it 
is 
to 
his 
astronomy. 
Indeed, 
we 
know 
that 
Kepler 
himself 
regarded 
the 
polyhedral 
archetype 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
as 
confirmation 
of 
the 
Copernican 
hypotheses, 
for 
it 
was 
of 
this 
work 
that 
he wrote 
in 
1598 
"It 
is 
enough 
honour 
for 
me that 
while 
Copernicus 
officiates 
at 
the 
high 
"2 
altar 
I 
can guard 
the 
door 
with 
my discovery- 
It 
also 
appears 
that 
it 
was 
in 
pursuit 
of 
better 
astronomical 
evidence 
to 
support 
this 
cosmological 
confirmation 
of 
the 
Copernican 
model 
that 
Kepler 
accepted 
Tycho 
Brahe's 
invitation 
to 
work 
in 
Prague, 
for 
he wrote 
to 
Magini 
in 
1601 
"What 
influenced 
me most 
[in 
coming 
to 
Prague] 
was the 
hope 
of 
completing 
my study 
of 
the 
harmony 
of 
the 
world, 
something 
I 
have 
long 
meditated, 
and which 
I 
could 
only 
complete 
if 
Tycho 
were 
to 
rebuild 
Astronomy 
or 
if 
I 
could 
use 
his 
observations" 
Thus, 
if 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
theories 
exercised 
no perceptible 
influence 
on the 
development 
of 
Cosmology, 
they 
did 
at 
least 
influence 
the 
development 
of 
Kepler's 
astronomy. 
Kepler 
himself 
used 
his 
new astronomical 
results 
not 
only 
for 
the 
traditional 
tasks 
of 
constructing 
tables 
and 
ephemerides, 
but 
also 
for 
the 
purpose 
he had 
mentioned 
to 
Magini, 
namely, 
to 
pursue 
his 
study 
of 
the 
mathematical- 
ly 
harmonious 
structure 
of 
the 
Universe 
as 
a whole.

Kepler's 
cosmology, 
and 
his 
astronomy 
thus 
appear 
to 
be 
linked 
closely 
with 
one 
another, 
at 
least 
in 
Kepler's 
own mind. 
This 
fact 
in 
itself 
would 
seem 
to 
justify 
some 
further 
examination 
of 
the 
cosmological 
works, 
as 
a counterpart 
to 
the 
numerous 
investigations 
of 
the 
astronomical 
ones. 
As I 
have 
already 
remarked, 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
works 
seem 
to 
have 
exercised 
little 
influence, 
though 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
well 
received 
at 
the 
time 
of 
its 
first 
publication, 
in 
1596, 
and 
went 
into 
a second 
edition 
in 
1621 
(thus 
providing 
the 
historian 
with 
valuable 
evidence 
of 
the 
author's 
changes 
of 
opinion 
over 
the 
intervening 
years 
- 
see 
Chapters 
III 
and 
IV 
below). 
Nevertheless, 
we know 
that 
Kepler 
himself 
thought 
well 
of 
both 
works, 
as may be 
seen 
from 
his 
enthusiastic 
introduction 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V (see 
Chapter 
VI 
below), 
and 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
he allowed 
a second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum 
to 
be printed. 
Kepler 
is 
not 
famous 
for 
the 
sureness 
of 
his 
historical 
judgement, 
but 
it 
seems 
to 
me that 
in 
this 
case 
historians 
have 
been 
too 
ready 
to 
neglect 
his 
opinion. 
He does 
indeed 
seem 
to 
have 
believed 
his 
cosmological 
works 
would 
stand 
the 
test 
of 
time, 
and 
on this 
point 
we must, 
with 
hindsight, 
disagree 
with 
him. 
There 
remains, 
however, 
his 
judgement 
that 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
and 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V 
were 
good 
examples 
of 
Natural 
Philosophy. 
It 
therefore 
seems 
worthwhile 
to 
ask 
ourselves 
what 
they 
tell 
us 
about 
Kepler's 
attitude 
to 
the 
study 
of 
Nature, 
and 
to 
compare 
0 

20 
this 
with 
the 
evidence 
we find 
in 
some of 
the 
other 
works 
for 
which 
he is 
now generally 
better 
remembered. 
My study 
will 
thus 
be concerned 
with 
setting 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
works 
in 
the 
context 
of 
his 
work 
as a whole, 
but 
most 
particularly 
with 
examining 
their 
relation 
to 
his 
astronomical 
works, 
since 
it 
was 
crucial 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
theories 
that 
they 
were 
designed 
to 
explain 
the 
relations 
between 
magnitudes 
which 
could 
be calculated 
from 
the 
results 
of 
astronomical 
observation. 
Relations 
between 
magnitudes 
were 
the 
province 
of 
Geometry, 
so it 
was 
natural 
that 
Kepler 
should 
cast 
his 
cosmological 
theories 
in 
geometrical 
form. 
However, 
he 
did 
much more 
than 
that: 
he turned 
to 
Geometry 
itself 
(that 
is, 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
Euclidean 
space) 
as 
providing 
an explanation 
for 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Universe. 
Plato 
is 
thus 
as 
important 
an influence 
as 
Copernicus, 
and 
I 
shall 
therefore 
briefly 
consider 
some aspects 
of 
Timaeus 
before 
I 
begin 
my analysis 
of 
Kepler's 
contributions 
to 
the 
tradition 
it 
represents. 

21 
I 
PLATONIC 
SCIENCE 
Both 
Kepler's 
principal 
cosmological 
works, 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(Tubingen, 
1596) 
and 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V (Linz, 
1619), 
seem 
to 
me to 
be deeply 
indebted 
to 
Plato's 
Timaeus 
and 
to 
Proclus' 
Commentary 
on the 
First 
Book 
of 
Euclid's 
Elements. 
A marginal 
note 
Kepler 
added 
to 
a line 
in 
a long 
quotation 
from 
the 
latter 
work 
which 
happens 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
former 
one may 
serve 
to 
exemplify 
Kepler's 
attitude: 
"[This 
is 
to 
be 
found] 
in 
Timaeus, 
which 
is, 
beyond 
any 
possible 
doubt, 
a commentary 
on the 
book 
of 
Genesis, 
otherwise 
the 
first 
book 
of 
Moses, 
transforming 
it 
into 
Pythagorean 
philosophy, 
as will 
easily 
be apparent 
to 
an attentive 
reader 
who compares 
it 
with 
Moses' 
own words"1. 
I 
think 
there 
can 
be little 
doubt 
that 
Kepler 
wrote 
his 
own 
marginalia: 
the 
next 
but 
one 
reads 
"Puto 
1.2.4.8.3.9.27", 
which 
is 
hardly 
the 
kind 
of 
remark 
one 
might 
expect 
to 
originate 
with 
the 
printer. 
Since 
Kepler's 
judgement 
of 
Timaeus 
may seem 
to 
be extreme 
to 
the 
point 
of 
rashness 
it 
should 
perhaps 
be pointed 
out 
that 
Kepler, 
like 
many 
another 
reader, 
believed 
that 
Timaeus 
was 
not 
necessarily 
to 
be taken 
entirely 
at 
its 
face 
value. 
For 
example, 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
III 
Chapter 
I 
he quotes 
Timaeus' 
suggestion 
that 
harmonic 
proportions 
were

adding 
that

had 
refuted 
the

presented 
in

not

107). 
He must 
have 
reasoned 
similarly 
to 
account 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
Timaeus, 
which 
he correctly 
recognised 
as indebted 
to 
Pythagorean 
theories, 
appeared 
to 
describe 
a geo- 
centric 
Universe, 
whereas 
he not 
only 
believed 
the 
Universe 
to 
be heliocentric 
but 
also 
ascribed 
this 
opinion 
to 
the 
Pythagoreans. 
The 
scope 
of 
Kepler's 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V is 
I1 
both 
larger 
and 
smaller 
than 
the 
scope 
of 
Plato's 
Timaeus. 
It 
is 
larger 
in 
that 
Kepler 
sets 
out 
to 
explain 
the 
details 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
system 
of 
planets 
whereas 
Plato 
had 
only 
given 
a diagrammatic, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
very 
poetic, 
description 
of 
the 
heavens, 
which 
to 
me rather 
conveys 
the 
impression 
of 
an armillary 
sphere 
informed 
by soul. 
Plato's 
astronomy 
is 
perfectly 
satisfying, 
as 
far 
as 
it 
goes, 
and 
his 
breaking 
down 
of 
celestial 
motions 
into 
two 
components, 
rotation 
about 
the 
celestial 
poles 
and 
motion 
along 
the 
ecliptic, 
was 
a beautiful 
demonstration 
of 
the 
power 
of 
mathematics 
to 
expose 
the 
simplicity 
that 
lies 
behind 
the 
complicated 
world 
of 
appearances, 
that 
is, 
in 
Plato's 
terms, 
its 
power 
to 
turn 
our 
eyes 
from 
the 
flickering 
shadows 
on 
the 
wall 
of 
the 
cave 
and 
direct 
them 
instead 
to 
the 
models 
that 
cast 
the 
shadows. 
The 
scope 
of 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
is 
smaller 
than 
that 
of 
Timaeus 
in 
that 
while 
Plato 
sets 
out 
to 
give 
a fairly 
detailed, 
though 
not 
very 
full, 
account 
of 
sublunary 

23 
phenomena, 
for 
example 
by discussing 
various 
properties 
of 
the 
four 
sublunary 
elements, 
Kepler 
on the 
contrary 
contents 
himself 
with 
a more 
sketchy 
account, 
expressed 
in 
terms 
of 
the-response 
of 
souls 
to 
the 
harmonic 
ratios 
in 
which 
heavenly 
circles 
are 
divided 
when 
celestial 
bodies 
are 
at 
certain 
Aspects 
to 
one 
another. 
Plato, 
in 
fact, 
gives 
us 
the 
outlines 
of 
a detailed 
mechanistic 
theory 
of 
the 
properties 
of 
matter, 
whereas 
Kepler 
gives 
us 
no more 
than 
a mechanistic 
cum animistic 
astrology, 
which 
does 
not 
yield 
a detailed 
account 
of 
sublunary 
phenomena. 
It 
is, 
in 
fact, 
apparent 
from 
Kepler's 
other 
writings 
on astrology, 
for 
example 
his 
De 
Fundamentis 
Astrologiae 
Certioribus 
(Prague, 
1602), 
that 
he did 
not 
believe 
astrology 
could 
ever 
yield 
a detailed 
account 
of 
such 
phenomena, 
so we must 
assume 
that 
Kepler 
was 
aware 
that 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
Universe 
given 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V, 
was, 
to 
this 
extent, 
in- 
complete. 
Kepler's 
main 
concern 
was, 
in 
any 
case, 
always 
with 
astronomy 
and 
it 
appears. 
that 
he never 
concerned 
himself 
directly 
with 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
elements. 
His 
nearest 
approach 
to 
it 
was 
the 
very 
short 
and 
highly 
mathematical 
De Nive 
Sexangula 
(Prague, 
1611), 
which 
entirely 
fails 
to 
explain 
the 
shape 
of 
snow, 
though 
it 
gives 
an admirable 
account 
of 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
honeycomb. 
The 
theory 
of 
matter 
described 
in 
Plato's 
Timaeus 
is 
the 
only 
more 
or 
less 
fully 
worked 
out 
scientific 
theory 
described 
in 
Plato's 
work: 
the 
one 
specimen 
of 
autograph 
Platonic 
science. 
Although 
the 
theory 
is 
presented 
by 

24 
Timaeus 
of 
Locri 
rather 
than 
by Socrates 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
Plato 
at 
least 
considered 
it 
worthy 
of 
serious 
attention 
and 
I 
am therefore 
content 
to 
characterise 
it 
merely 
as 
'Platonic' 
rather 
than 
seek 
to 
disentangle 
the 
components 
which 
should 
be ascribed 
to 
the 
Pythag- 
oreans, 
Empedocles, 
the 
Atomists, 
Timaeus 
of 
Locri 
personally 
and, 
perhaps, 
even 
Plato 
himself. 
This 
attitude 
is, 
in 
principle, 
unhistorical, 
and 
what 
follows 
will 
not 
purport 
to 
be a serious 
historical 
account 
of 
the 
opinions 
held 
by Plato. 
My concern 
is 
narrower: 
to 
see 
what 
kind 
of 
scientific 
theory 
Plato 
describes. 
Plato 
does not 
describe 
his 
God as creating 
the 
world 
out 
of 
nothingness, 
but 
rather 
as making 
order, 
a cosmos, 
out 
of 
disorder. 
That 
is, 
the 
elements 
are 
all 
already 
present 
when 
Plato 
begins 
his 
account, 
and 
he is 
thus 
concerned 
with 
their 
properties 
rather 
than 
their 
origin. 
The 
theory 
of 
matter 
of 
Timaeus 
is 
described 
entirely 
in 
terms 
of 
geometrical 
properties 
and 
geometrical 
relationships, 
that 
is, 
in 
terms 
which 
can 
only 
be 
applied 
to 
mathematical 
entities, 
which 
Plato 
regarded 
as belonging 
to 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
'forms't. 
That 
the 
polyhedral 
figures 
of 
the 
elements 
are 
indeed 
to 
be 
considered 
as mathematical 
entities 
is 
confirmed 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
Timaeus 
describes 
them 
as resulting 
from 
forms 
and 
numbers 
(53b). 
However, 
it 
is 
never 
quite 
clear 
what 
relationship 
the 
figures 
bear 
to 
the 
real 
particles 
we 
might 
find 
if 
we made 
a sufficiently 
delicate 
analysis 
1. 
Republic

25 
of, 
say, 
a lump 
of-clay. 
We are 
told 
(56c) 
that 
all 
the 
elements 
or 
seeds 
are 
to 
be thought 
of 
as being 
too 
small 
for 
us 
to 
see 
them 
individually, 
and 
it 
is 
quite 
possible 
that 
Plato 
would 
have 
considered 
it 
meaning- 
less 
to 
ask 
whether 
the 
seeds 
of 
earth 
would 
appear 
cubic 
if 
we could 
see 
them 
(the 
exact 
relationship 
between 
observable 
bodies 
and 
Platonic 
'forms' 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
considerable 
dispute). 
Moreover, 
it 
should 
be noted 
that, 
despite 
the 
a priori 
arguments 
which 
Timaeus 
presents, 
he states 
explicitly 
that 
his 
theory 
is 
merely 
probable, 
adding 
that 
in 
any 
case 
only 
a god 
or 
someone 
specially 
favored 
by 
that 
god 
could 
know 
the 
higher 
causes 
which 
explain 
why 
particular 
figures 
should 
be involved 
(53d). 
The 
basic 
figures: 
triangles 
Timaeus 
begins 
by 
pointing 
out 
that 
since 
the 
elements 
are 
bodies 
their 
forms 
must 
include 
thickness, 
which 
involves 
having 
surfaces 
(53c). 
It 
then 
appears 
that 
these 
surfaces 
are 
to 
be "straight" 
(o e8 os 
and 
we are 
told 
that 
a "straight" 
surface 
is 
always 
made 
up of 
triangles. 
The 
English 
word 
"straight" 
is 
clearly 
an 
inadequate 
translation 
of 
Plato's 
20C eoj 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
passage, 
but 
the 
line 
of 
thought 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
reconstruct: 
Timaeus 
is 
assuming 
that 
the 
surfaces 
concerned 
will 
be plane, 
and 
since 
two 
planes 
intersect 
in 
a line, 
the 
edges 
of 
the 
solid 
figure 
will 
be straight, 
i. e. 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
solid 
figure 
will 
be 
polygonal. 
Any 
polygon 
can, 
indeed, 
as 
he says, 
be 

26 
1.1 
dissected 
into 
triangles 
(see 
figure 
1.1) 
Timaeus 
next 
states 
that 
"all 
the 
triangles" 
arise 
from 
combinations 
of 
two 
kinds 
of 
triangle, 
both 
of 
them 
right-angled. 
One of 
the 
basic 
right-angled 
triangles 
is 
isosceles, 
the 
other 
is 
not 
(it 
will 
eventually 
prove 
to 
be the 
triangle 
whose 
angles 
are 
900,600 
and 
30°). 
It 
is 
true 
that 
any 
triangle 
can 
be dissected 
into 
two 
right-angled 
triangles: 
we only 
need 
to 
drop 
a perpen- 
dicular 
from 
one 
of 
the 
vertices 
on to 
the 
opposite 
side 
(see 
figure 
1.2). 
1.2 
However, 
in 
the 
general 
case 
the 
right-angled 
triangles 
produced 
in 
this 
way will 
not 
be of 
either 
of 
the 
special 
kinds 
that 
Timaeus 
goes 
on to 
consider. 
It 
therefore 
appears 
that 
"all 
the 
triangles" 
( Tä 
S- 
Tec7wva 
7r. VTK 
) must 
refer 
only 
to 
all 
the 
special 
triangles 
Timaeus 
is 
going 
to 
consider 
in 
the 
theory 
that 
follows, 
that 
is, 
90°, 
45°, 
45° 
triangles 
and 
90°, 
60°, 
30 ° 
triangles. 
If 
we take 
"all 
the 
triangles" 
in 
this 
sense 
what 
Timaeus 
says 
is 
true: 
a 900,45°, 
45° 
triangle 

27 
can 
be dissected 
indefinitely 
into 
more 
900,45°, 
45° 
triangles 
and 
a g0°, 
600,300 
triangle 
can 
be dissected 
A -- 
O 
1.14 
1.3 
indefinitely 
into 
more 
9Qo, 
600,300 
triangles 
(see 
figures 
1.3 and 
1.14). 
We are 
not 
offered 
any 
particular 
justification 
for 
the 
assumption 
that 
one 
of 
the 
basic 
triangles 
must 
be 
isosceles, 
but 
Timaeus 
notes 
that 
while 
the 
isosceles 
right-angled 
triangle 
is 
of 
only 
one 
kind 
( ,, kto(V 
at Xj 
X&V 
4H. 
LV 
) the 
non-isosceles 
one 
can 
be 
of 
any 
one 
of 
an unlimited 
number 
of 
kinds 
(514a), 
and 
we 
must 
therefore 
simply 
choose 
the 
most 
beautiful. 
In 
earlier 
passages 
of 
the 
dialogue 
it 
has 
already 
been 
agreed 
that 
God's 
actions 
were 
undoubtedly 
intended 
to 
make 
the 
Cosmos 
as 
beautiful 
as 
possible 
so 
the 
reap- 
pearance 
of 
the 
aesthetic 
principle 
at 
this 
point 
cannot 
be regarded 
as unreasonable. 
However, 
Timaeus 
declines 
to 
reason 
as 
to 
why 
the 
particular 
non-isosceles 
triangle 
he chooses 
should 
be considered 
the 
most 
beautiful. 
In 
fact, 
he 
says 
that 
if 
anyone 
can 
find 
a 
more 
beautiful 
triangle 
than 
this 
one 
then 
he, 
Timaeus, 
will 
welcome 
him 
as 
a friend, 
but 
that 
meanwhile 
we shall 
choose 
the 
triangle 
which 
is 
half 
an 
equilateral 
triangle. 
The 
following 
sentence 
is 
somewhat 
obscure. 
What 
it 
says 

28 
seems 
to 
be that 
it 
would 
take 
too 
long 
to 
explain 
this 
decision 
but 
if 
anyone 
can 
give 
a demonstration 
that 
it 
is 
justified 
(or 
'not 
justified' 
- 
some manuscripts 
apparently 
have 
an additional 
ýu 
) he will 
be welcome 
to 
the 
prize. 
It 
is 
in 
any 
case 
clear 
that 
Timaeus 
is 
not 
pretending 
that 
he has 
justified 
his 
choice 
of 
this 
one 
particular 
kind 
of 
non-isosceles 
right-angled 
triangle 
on a priori 
grounds. 
He goes 
on to 
say 
that 
although 
the 
four 
elements 
appear 
to 
be generated 
from 
one 
another 
they 
are 
in 
fact 
generated 
from 
these 
tri- 
angles 
(54c), 
three 
from 
one 
kind 
(the 
non-isosceles 
triangle) 
and 
only 
one 
from 
the 
other 
(the 
isosceles 
triangle). 
Therefore 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
the 
fourth 
element 
to 
be generated 
from 
the 
other 
three, 
nor 
vice 
versa. 
He then 
turns 
to 
the 
forms 
of 
the 
individual 
elements, 
starting 
with 
those. 
put 
together 
from 
the 
non-isosceles 
triangles. 
He describes 
how six 
such 
triangles 
can 
be 
put 
together 
to 
form 
an equilateral 
triangle 
(54d-e, 
see 
figure 
1.5). 
A 
C 
1.5 

29 
Four 
such 
equilateral 
triangles 
make 
a tetrahedron, 
eight 
an octahedron 
and 
twenty 
an 
icosahedron 
(figures 
1.6,1.7 
and 
1.8,514e-55b). 
The 
isosceles 
right-angled 
1.6 
1.7 
1.8 
triangle 
will 
construct 
the 
cube, 
four 
triangles 
being 
fitted 
together 
to 
form 
each 
face 
(figure 
1.9) 
and 
six 
faces 
to 
form 
the 
solid 
(figure 
1.10,55b-c). 
A 
1.9 
1.10 
Timaeus 
then 
adds 
that-there 
remains 
just 
one 
more 
construction 
( 
oru (rTK 
o- cj 
the 
fifth, 
which 
God 
used 
in 
designing 
the 
whold. 
This 
final 
remark 
must 
refer 
to 
the 
last 
of 
the 
convex 
regular 
polyhedra, 
the 
dodecahedron, 
which 
has 
twelve 
pentagonal 
faces 
(figure 
1.11). 
Timaeus 
does 
not 
remark 
upon 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
dodecahedron 
cannot 
be constructed 
from 
the 
basic 
triangles 
used 
for 
the 
other 
four 
figures, 
and the 
dodecahedron 
is 
not 
mentioned 
when 
each 
polyhedron 
is 
assigned 
to 
one 

30 
of 
the 
elements 
in 
the 
following 
section 
of 
the 
dialogue 
(55e-56b). 
In 
fact, 
Plato's 
main 
concern 
seems 
to 
be 
with 
the 
basic 
triangles, 
which 
he uses 
to 
make polyhedra 
and 
thus 
to 
explain 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
elements, 
rather 
than 
with 
the 
regular 
polyhedra 
themselves. 
1.11 
As we have 
seen, 
Timaeus 
las 
justified 
his 
use 
of 
triangles 
on the 
grounds 
that 
triangles 
are 
the 
most 
basic 
of 
figures 
(53c-d) 
and 
has 
made 
it 
clear 
that 
he 
believes 
there 
are 
reasons 
for 
prefering 
the 
particular 
triangles 
he has 
chosen 
(54a-b). 
However, 
he nowhere 
explains 
why he chooses 
to 
assemble 
the 
equilateral 
triangles 
he requires 
in 
the 
rather 
elaborate 
manner 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.5 
instead 
of 
in 
the 
simpler 
pattern 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.12. 
Nor 
does 
he explain 
why 
the 
squares 
1.12 
1.13 

31 
are 
assembled 
as 
in 
figure 
1.9 
rather 
than 
as 
in 
figure 
1.13. 
I 
believe 
that 
one 
explanation 
for 
the 
use-of 
the 
patterns 
shown 
in 
figures 
1.5 
and 
1.9 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
these 
patterns 
involve 
grouping 
triangles 
round 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
figure 
(H in 
figure 
1.5, 
K in 
figure 
1.9). 
Plato 
is 
certainly 
aware 
that 
the 
tetrahedron 
can 
be inscribed 
in 
a sphere, 
since 
he mentions 
the 
fact 
at 
55a, 'and 
it 
is 
to 
be presumed 
that 
he realised 
that 
the 
same 
applied 
to 
the 
other 
regular 
polyhedra. 
He 
must 
also 
have 
known 
that 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
solids 
had 
an analogous 
property, 
namely 
that 
they 
could 
be in- 
scribed 
in 
a circle. 
What 
I 
have 
called 
the 
"centre" 
of 
the 
equilateral 
triangle 
and 
the 
square 
is 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
circle 
in 
which 
each 
of 
the 
figures 
could 
be 
inscribed. 
The 
reasoning 
I 
am ascribing 
to 
Plato 
might 
be expressed 
less 
rigorously 
by 
saying 
that 
the 
patterns 
in 
figures 
1.5 
and 
1.9 
are 
'more 
symmetrical' 
than 
those 
in

and

When we come 
to 
the 
application 
of 
the 
theory, 
we 
find 
that 
we are 
required 
to 
construct 
elementary 
polyhedra 
in 
different 
sizes. 
For 
example, 
we are 
told 
that 
ice, 
being 
solid, 
is 
made 
up 
of_larger 
polyhedra 
than 
water 
(58d). 
This 
may perhaps 
suggest 
another 
reason 
why 
Plato 
prefered 
to 
construct 
polyhedra 
from 
two 
kinds 
of 
right-angled 
triangle 
rather 
than 
directly 
from 
equilateral 
triangles 
and 
squares: 
using 
right-angled 
triangles 
allows 
a greater 
variety 
of 
size. 

32 
If 
we are 
concerned 
with 
constructing 
square 
faces, 
the 
use 
of 
a square 
unit 
will 
give 
us 
the 
series 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.14. 
The areas 
of 
the 
faces 
are 
clearly 
1.14 
etc. 
going 
to 
be 
1,4,9,16,25 
etc., 
the 
area 
of 
the 
nth 
face 
being 
n2. 
The use 
of 
an isosceles 
right-angled 
triangle 
as a half-unit 
building 
block 
will 
give 
us 
two 
series 
of 
faces. 
The 
first 
begins 
with 
the 
square 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.15, 
which 
gives 
us 
a series 
identical 
with 
that 
N 
1.15 
1.16 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.14, 
but 
we can 
also 
construct 
the 
square 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.16, 
which 
will 
give 
us 
a series 
whose 
nth 
term 
is 
2n2. 
The use 
of 
the 
triangle 
rather 
than 
the 
square 
has 
thus 
enabled 
us 
to 
construct 
twice 
as many 
sizes 
of 
face 
for 
our 
cubes. 
If 
we are 
concerned 
with 
constructing 
faces 
which 
are 
equilateral 
triangles, 
the 
use of 
an equilateral 
triangle 
unit 
will 
give 
us 
the 
series 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.17.

The

etc., 
the

of

The 
use 
of 
the 
900,600,30° 
triangle 
as 
a half-unit 
building 
block 
will 
give 
us 
two 
series 
of 
faces. 
The 
first 
begins 
with 
the 
triangle 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.18, 
which 
gives 
us 
a series 
identical 
with 
that 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.17, 
1.19 
1.18 
but 
we can 
also 
construct 
the 
equilateral 
triangle 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.19, 
which 
will 
give 
us 
a series 
whose 
nth 
term 
is 
3n2. 
The 
use 
of 
the 
900,600,300 
triangle 
rather 
than 
the 
equilateral 
triangle 
has 
thus 
enabled 
us 
to 
construct 
twice 
as many 
sizes 
of 
face 
for 
our 
tetrahedra, 
octahedra 
and 
icosahedra. 

34 
It 
is, 
however, 
also 
possible 
that 
Plato 
envisaged 
the 
different 
sizes 
of 
polyhedra 
as being 
put 
together 
from 
basic 
triangles 
of 
different 
sizes. 
This 
might 
explain 
the 
remark 
at 
the 
end 
of 
53c 
that 
all 
the 
basic 
triangles 
can 
be seen 
as made up of 
smaller 
basic 
triangles 
(see 
figures 
1.3 
and 
1.4, 
and 
figures 
1.20 
and 
1.21).

If 
we dissect 
the 
isosceles 
basic 
triangle 
in 
the 
manner 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.20 
we clearly 
obtain 
two 
isosceles 
basic 
triangles 
whose 
areas 
are 
each 
half 
the 
area 
of 
the 
original 
triangle. 
The areas 
of 
the 
triangles 
obtained 
by dissecting 
the 
non-isosceles 
basic 
triangle 
as 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.21 
are 
slightly 
more 
difficult 
to 
find, 
but 
they 
turn 
out 
to 
be q and 
j 
of 
the 
area'of 
the 
original 
triangle. 
If 
we now apply 
the 
constructions 
shown 
in 
figures 
1.14 
and 
1.15 
and 
1.16 
using 
a basic 
triangle 
of 
area 
4 rather 
than 
i, 
we shall 
obtain 
series 
of 
areas 
whose 
general 
terms 
are 
rn2 
and 
n2. 
Some of 
these 
areas 
are 
different 
from 
what 
we obtained 
before. 
If 
we apply 
the 
constructions 
shown 
in 
figures 
1.17,1.18 
and 
1.19 
using 
the 
smaller 
basic 
triangles 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.21 
we shall 
again 
find 
that 
some of 
the 
areas 
we obtain 
are 
different 

35 
from 
what 
we obtained 
before. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
repeated 
dissections 
of 
the 
basic 
triangles, 
as 
shown 
in 
figures 
1.20 
and 
1.21, 
will 
con- 
tinue 
to 
yield 
more 
basic 
triangles 
and 
more 
possible 
areas 
for 
faces. 
However, 
the 
remark 
at 
53c 
appears 
to 
be the 
only 
reference 
to 
the 
possibility 
that 
basic 
triangles 
may be of 
various 
sizes 
(if 
indeed 
it 
is 
such 
a reference) 
and 
I 
am therefore 
inclined 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
dissections 
it 
mentions 
are 
probably 
only 
intended 
to 
establish 
that 
the 
basic 
triangles 
can 
be seen 
to 
be 
made up only 
of 
similar 
basic 
triangles, 
a sort 
of 
geo- 
metrical 
equivalent 
to 
showing 
that 
they 
are 
100% pure. 
(Though 
it 
should 
be noted 
that 
the 
same 
purity 
would 
be 
found 
in 
any 
right-angled 
triangle. 
) 
The 
non-isosceles 
right-angled 
triangles, 
however, 
present 
a problem 
of 
a slightly 
different 
kind. 
Plato 
appears 
to 
consider 
that 
only 
one 
such 
triangle 
is 
in- 
volved, 
but 
in 
fact, 
if 
we consider 
the 
triangles 
as 
purely 
mathematical 
entities, 
confined 
to 
their 
own plane, 
then 
we find 
that 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
equilateral 
triangle 
described 
in 
54d-e 
requires 
two 
different 
kinds 
of 
non- 
isosceles 
right-angled 
triangle 
(see 
figure 
1.22). 
In 
A 
1.22 
C 
B 

36 
this 
figure 
we can 
see 
that 
triangle 
HBL is 
indeed 
congruent 
with 
triangle 
HLC in 
the 
modern 
sense, 
that 
is, 
all 
corresponding 
sides 
and 
angles 
are 
of 
equal 
size, 
but 
the 
two 
triangles 
are 
mirror 
images 
of 
one 
another. 
The usual 
definition 
of 
geometrical 
equality 
is 
that 
expressed 
in 
Euclid's 
Common Notion 
41, 
namely 
that 
things 
which 
coincide 
with 
one 
another 
(or 
can 
be super- 
imposed 
upon 
one 
another) 
are 
equal. 
As Heath 
notes, 
the 
way Euclid 
uses 
this 
notion, 
for 
example 
in 
Book 
I 
proposition 
4 and 
Book 
I 
proposition 
8, 
"leaves 
no room 
for 
doubt 
that 
he regarded 
one 
figure 
as actually 
moved 
and 
placed 
upon 
the 
other. 
" 
Heath 
concludes 
that 
Euclid's 
apparent 
distaste 
for 
the 
method 
of 
superposition 
probably 
indicates 
that 
the 
method 
was 
a traditional 
one. 
He adds 
that 
it 
may well 
date 
back 
to 
Thales. 
Now it 
is 
clear 
that, 
in 
figure 
1.22, 
triangle 
HBL cannot 
be superimposed 
on triangle 
HLC unless 
we can, 
as 
it 
were, 
allow 
ourselves 
to 
pick 
it 
up and 
turn 
it 
over, 
that 
is, 
unless 
we regard 
the 
triangles 
not 
as being 
confined 
to 
the 
plane, 
as 
purely 
mathematical 
entities, 
but 
as having 
a physical 
existence 
as two-dimensional 
bodies 
in 
three-dimensional 
space. 
As far 
as 
I 
can 
tell, 
Euclid 
never 
mentions 
the 
pos- 
sibility 
of 
figures 
being 
mirror 
images 
of 
one 
another, 
though 
his 
avoidance 
of 
the 
method 
of 
superposition

a number 
of 
occasions 
when 
it 
might 
have 
seemed 
natural 
to 
think 
of 
employing 
it, 
for 
example 
in 
Book 
I 
proposition 
26, 
may perhaps 
indicate 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
mirror 
images 
had 
occurred 
to 
him. 
Proclus's 
comment 
on this 
proposition 
unfortunately 
deals 
mainly 
with 
the 
form 
of 
the 
enunciation 
and 
not 
at 
all 
with 
Euclid's 
choice 
of 
the 
method 
of 
proof. 
In 
any 
case, 
we do know 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
mirror 
images 
was used 
by Pappus, 
in 
an alternative 
proof 
for 
the 
theorem 
which 
is 
proved 
in 
proposition 
5 of 
Book 
I 
of 
the 
Elements. 
Our 
account 
of 
this 
proof 
is 
due 
to 
Proclus, 
who 
presents 
it 
as originating 
with 
Pappus. 
Heath 
quotes 
this 
proof 
in 
his 
note 
on Book 
I 
proposition 
51 but 
makes 
no comment 
on its 
connection 
with 
the 
idea 
of 
mirror 
images. 
Since 
Plato 
appears 
to 
believe 
that 
only 
one 
kind 
of 
basic 
triangle 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
construction 
shown 
in 
figure 
1.22 
I 
think 
we must 
assume 
that 
he envisaged 
the 
triangles 
as behaving 
as 
if 
they 
were 
two-dimensional 
objects 
free 
to 
move 
in 
three-dimensional 
space. 
In 
this 
respect 
Plato's 
God seems 
to 
be a faintly 
Aristotelian 
geometer. 
The 
figures 
of 
the 
elements: 
polyhedra 
Having 
described 
how 
the 
tetrahedron, 
the 
octahedron, 
the 
icosahedron 
and 
the 
cube 
can 
be constructed 
from 
the 
basic 
triangles 
(in 
51d-55e), 
Timaeus 
proceeds 
to 
assign 
each 
polyhedron 
to 
an element 
(55d). 
1. 
Euclid 
trans 
Heath 
(1956), 
vol. 
I, 
p. 
2514. 

38 
He makes 
the 
most 
straightforward 
attribution 
first: 
"We shall 
surely 
give 
earth 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
cube" 
(55e). 
Timaeus's 
justification 
for 
the 
decision 
is 
as follows: 
Earth 
is 
the 
most 
difficult 
of 
the 
elements 
to 
set 
in 
motion, 
and must 
thus 
have 
the 
most 
stable 
type 
of 
face. 
(The 
same word, 
fa 
riS 
, is 
used 
to 
mean 
either 
'face' 
or 
'base' 
and 
any 
of 
the 
polyhedra 
can, 
of 
course, 
stand 
on any 
of 
its 
faces. 
) 
The more 
stable 
face 
is 
that 
made 
up of 
isosceles 
triangles, 
therefore 
the 
square 
face 
is 
both 
in 
its 
parts 
and 
as a whole 
more 
stable 
than 
the 
triangular 
one (55e). 
There 
cannot 
be any 
doubt 
that 
this 
argument 
is 
concerned 
only 
with 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
face 
and 
not 
with 
the 
three-dimensional 
shape 
of 
the 
cube. 
Moreover, 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
face 
appears 
to 
be ascribed 
directly 
to 
the 
stability 
(that 
is, 
presumably, 
the 
symmetry) 
of 
the 
isosceles 
triangles 
which 
are 
its 
ultimate 
indivisible 
components. 
When we turn 
to 
the 
other 
three 
elements 
the 
attributions 
must 
naturally 
take 
account 
of 
the 
solid 
shapes 
of 
the 
polyhedra 
concerned, 
since 
all 
their 
faces 
are 
exactly 
the 
same, 
being 
equilateral 
triangles. 
Timaeus 
makes 
these 
attributions 
by 
considering 
firstly 
how easily 
each 
of 
the 
figures 
can 
be moved, 
secondly 
how large 
each 
is 
and 
thirdly 
the 
sharpness 
of 
its 
solid 
angles. 
The meaning 
of 
the 
first 
consideration 
is 
not 
clear 
from 
Timaeus, 
but 
a passage 
in 
On the 
Heavens 
Book 
III 
Chapter 
1 (229 
b 33) 
suggests 
that 
Aristotle 
had 
interpreted 

39 
Plato 
as refering 
merely 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
polyhedra, 
which, 
since 
they 
are 
made 
up 
of 
surfaces, 
will 
depend 
upon 
the 
surface 
area. 
If 
the 
faces 
are 
the 
same 
size 
in 
every 
figure, 
the 
lightest 
figure 
will 
be the 
tetra- 
hedron 
and 
the 
heaviest 
the 
icosahedron, 
as 
Plato 
apparently 
requires. 
It 
is 
far 
from 
obvious 
that 
Aristotle 
can 
in 
general 
be relied 
upon 
as a faithful 
guide 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
Timaeus 
but 
in 
this 
case 
his 
interpretation 
does 
seem 
to 
be acceptable. 
(The 
'obvious' 
interpretation 
of 
'easy 
to 
move' 
as meaning 
that 
the 
polyhedron 
would 
roll 
easily 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be tenable, 
since 
the 
isosahedron, 
the 
most 
nearly 
spherical 
of 
the 
figures, 
is 
pronounced 
the 
'most 
difficult 
to 
move'. 
) 
If 
we assume 
that 
'easy 
to 
move' 
does, 
indeed, 
mean 
'light', 
then 
the 
fact 
that 
we know 
that 
the 
particles 
of 
earth 
are 
the 
heaviest 
ones 
of 
all 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
weight 
of 
24 
(that 
is 
6x 
4) 
isosceles 
basic 
triangles 
must 
be greater 
than 
the 
weight 
of 
120 
(that 
is 
20 x 6) 
non-isosceles 
basic 
triangles, 
that 
is, 
one 
isosceles 
basic 
triangle 
is 
heavier 
than 
five 
non-isosceles 
basic 
triangles. 
This 
is 
all 
we are 
ever 
able 
to 
establish 
as 
to 
the 
relative 
sizes 
of 
the 
two 
types 
of 
basic 
triangle. 
If 
we again 
assume 
that 
we are 
to 
compare 
tetrahedra, 
octahedra 
and 
icosahedra 
with 
faces 
of 
the 
same 
size, 
the 
second 
consideration, 
the 
size 
of 
the 
figures, 
may be 
supposed 
to 
refer 
to 
their 
overall 
diameters 
or 
to 
their 
volumes. 
Since 
Timaeus 
appears 
to 
regard 
it 
as merely 
obvious 
that 
the 
tetrahedron 
is 
the 
smallest 
figure 
and 

40 
the 
icosahedron 
the 
largest, 
we have 
no way 
of 
deciding 
exactly 
what 
he means. 
The 
third 
consideration, 
the 
sharpness 
of 
the 
solid 
angles, 
presents 
no problems, 
though 
it 
should 
be noted 
that 
it 
is 
only 
later 
that 
we are 
explicitly 
given 
grounds 
for 
believing, 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
points 
of 
the 
seeds 
of 
fire 
are 
sharper 
than 
those 
of 
the 
seeds 
of 
water. 
The observational 
evidence 
for 
the 
attributions 
is 
adduced 
only 
when 
we come to 
applications 
of 
the 
theory. 
All 
three 
considerations 
happily 
suggest 
exactly 
the 
same attributions: 
the 
tetrahedron 
for 
fire, 
the 
octahedron 
for 
air 
and 
the 
icosahedron 
for 
water 
(56b). 
Transmutation 
of 
the 
elements 
As we have 
seen, 
the 
cube 
is 
composed 
of 
isosceles 
right-angled 
triangles, 
which 
are 
peculiar 
to 
the 
cube, 
so we cannot 
expect 
the 
element 
earth 
to 
be transformed 
into 
any 
other 
element. 
However, 
fire 
or 
air 
or 
water 
can 
break 
up earth, 
and 
the 
broken 
pieces 
may eventually 
reassemble 
themselves 
into 
earth, 
though 
never 
into 
another 
element 
(55d). 
The 
other 
three 
elements 
can 
be transformed 
into 
one 
another, 
and 
Timaeus 
provides 
several 
examples 
for 
such 
transformations 
(56d-e). 
The 
following 
are 
typical. 
1. 
If 
water 
is 
broken 
up by 
air 
or 
fire, 
the 
parts 
can 
come 
together 
again 
to 
form 
one 
particle 
of 
fire 
and 
two 
of 
air. 
That 
is, 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
triangular 
faces, 

41 
20-s(1x4) 
+ (2x8); 
and 
in 
terms 
of 
basic 
triangles, 
20x6-? 
(lx(4x6)) 
+ (2x(8x6)). 
2. 
Air 
can 
be divided 
up 
to 
give 
two. particles 
of 
fire. 
In 
terms 
of 
faces 
we have 
8-&'2x4; 
in 
terms 
of 
basic 
triangles, 
8x6 4 2x(14x6). 
3. 
Fire, 
if 
trapped 
by masses 
of 
water 
or 
earth, 
can 
be crushed 
in 
such 
a way 
that 
two 
particles 
of 
fire 
give 
one 
of 
air. 
In 
terms 
of 
faces 
we have 
2x4-flx8; 
in 
terms 
of 
basic 
triangles, 
2x(4x6) 
41x(8x6). 
4. 
Air, 
similarly 
crushed, 
can 
be converted 
into 
water: 
two 
and 
a half 
(sic) 
particles 
of 
air 
giving 
one 
of 
water. 
In 
terms 
of 
faces 
we have 
22x8-*1x20; 
in 
terms 
of 
basic 
triangles, 
22x(8x6)---1x(2Ox6). 
All 
these 
transformations 
are 
described 
as 
resulting 
from 
physical 
contact 
between 
polyhedral 
particles. 
For 
example, 
the 
sharp 
points 
of 
fire 
tear 
apart 
the 
particles 
of 
water, 
or 
the 
heavy 
masses 
of 
water 
crush 
the 
particles 
of 
fire. 
Nothing 
in 
this 
section 
makes 
it 
clear 
whether 
we are 
to 
suppose 
the 
polyhedra 
to 
be broken 
down 
into 
faces 
or 
into 
basic 
triangles, 
though 
the 
latter 
seems 
more 
likely, 
both 
because 
the 
triangles 
are 
basic 
and 
because 
it 
is 
easier, 
for 
example, 
to 
imagine 
the 
sharp 
point 
of 
a tetrahedron 
breaking 
up 
a face 
of 
an 
icosahedron 
rather 
than 
prising 
the 
icosahedron 
apart 
along 
one 
of 
its 
edges. 
However, 
it 
is 
perfectly 
clear 
that 
dissolutions 
and 
recombinations 
are 
to 
be seen 
in 
terms 
of 
triangles 
of 
some kind 
and 
not 
in 
terms 
of 
cutting 
up 
solid 
polyhedra, 
as 
is 
supposed 
by 
Rivaud 
in 
the 
introduction 
to 
his 

42 
translation 
of 
Timaeus1. 
Applications 
of 
the 
theory 
The theory 
I 
have 
outlined 
above 
allows 
Timaeus 
to 
give 
mechanistic 
explanations 
for 
various 
phenomena. 
For 
example, 
the 
fact 
that 
air 
may be either 
the 
very 
pure 
kind 
called 
aether 
or 
the 
murky 
kind 
known 
as mist 
is 
explained 
as being 
due 
to 
the 
various 
sizes 
of 
the 
triangles 
concerned 
(58d). 
The 
freezing 
of 
water 
is 
explained 
similarly, 
and 
fire 
particles 
are 
said 
to 
be 
slowly 
forced 
out 
as 
the 
water 
cools 
and 
becomes 
more 
condensed 
(59a). 
Metals 
are 
said 
to 
be a variety 
of 
water 
which 
is 
solid 
except 
when 
it 
is 
made 
very 
hot 
(59b), 
that 
is, 
in 
modern 
terms, 
metals 
are 
thought 
of 
as 
varieties 
of 
water 
which 
have 
very 
high 
freezing 
points. 
There 
are 
also 
explanations 
of 
the 
different 
varieties 
of 
ice: 
as hail, 
snow 
and 
hoar 
frost 
(59e). 
Timaeus 
eventually 
turns 
to 
explaining 
how the 
particles 
affect 
the 
human 
senses 
(61c) 
and 
gives, 
among 
other 
things, 
a relatively 
detailed 
explanation 
of 
the 
sensation 
of 
smell 
(66d). 
This 
explanation 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be typical 
of 
the 
way 
in 
which 
Plato 
expects 
his 
theory 
to 
account 
for 
natural 
phenomena, 
so I 
shall 
attempt 
to 
summarise 
it. 
There 
are, 
Timaeus 
says, 
no particular 
kinds 
of 
particle 
1. 
'Les 
belles 
lettres', 
Paris, 
1925, 
(reprinted 
1970). 

43 
that 
affect 
the 
organs 
of 
smell, 
and 
there 
are 
no part- 
icular 
particles 
that 
correspond 
to 
particular 
smells, 
sweet 
smells, 
sour 
smells 
and 
so on. 
However, 
the 
vessels 
that 
take 
in 
smells 
are 
too 
narrow 
for 
particles 
of 
earth 
or 
water 
to 
pass 
through, 
but 
too 
wide 
to 
be 
affected 
by particles 
of 
fire 
or 
air. 
So none 
of 
these 
elements 
has 
a smell 
that 
anyone 
has 
ever 
noticed. 
Smells 
only 
arise 
when'certain 
bodies 
get 
wet, 
rot, 
turn 
into 
liquid 
or 
evaporate. 
Indeed 
it 
is 
when 
water 
is 
turning 
into 
air 
or 
air 
into 
water 
that 
smells 
arise, 
being 
caused 
by 
the 
bodies 
of 
intermediate 
size 
that 
are 
produced 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
transformation 
of 
one 
element 
into 
the 
other 
(66d-e). 
Now, 
we have 
already 
been 
told, 
several 
times, 
that 
particles 
of 
any 
element 
come 
in 
many 
different 
sizes-- 
this 
was, 
for 
example, 
how Timaeus 
accounted 
for 
the 
various 
types 
of 
air 
(58d). 
Therefore 
the 
suggestion 
that 
the 
passages 
which 
admit 
smells 
are 
too 
small 
for 
the 
particles 
of 
some 
elements 
and 
too 
large 
to 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
particles 
of 
others 
is 
not, 
on its 
own, 
satisfactory. 
Moreover, 
although 
we may perhaps 
compare 
the 
sizes 
of 
particles 
of 
fire, 
air 
and 
water, 
which 
are 
generated 
from 
one 
another 
and 
make 
use 
of 
the 
same 
basic 
triangles, 
we have 
not 
been 
given 
any 
way 
of 
comparing 
these 
particles 
with 
those 
of 
earth, 
which 
use 
a different 
basic 
triangle, 
whose 
size 
(in 
the 
sense 
of 
area, 
side, 
perimeter 
or 
anything 
else) 
may well 
be different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
triangles 
used 

44 
for 
the 
other 
elements. 
Indeed, 
as we saw in 
connection 
with 
the 
attribution 
of 
the 
polyhedra 
to 
the 
elements 
(55e-56b), 
it 
does 
appear 
that 
Plato 
intended 
that 
the 
triangles 
used 
for 
the 
cube 
should 
be heavier 
than 
those 
used 
for 
the 
other 
polyhedra, 
assuming 
the 
square 
and 
triangular 
faces 
were 
to 
be made up 
in 
the 
way he 
describes, 
using 
four 
triangles 
for 
the 
square 
and 
six 
for 
the 
equilateral 
triangle. 
It 
is 
not 
only 
that 
a great 
deal 
is 
being 
left 
as an exercise 
for 
the 
reader's 
ingenuity, 
but 
also 
that 
the 
theory 
is 
essen- 
tially 
incomplete, 
in 
the 
form 
in 
which 
Timaeus 
presents 
it. 
However, 
if 
we assume 
that 
air 
with 
faces 
of 
some 
given 
size 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
turning 
into 
water 
with 
faces 
of 
the 
same 
size 
, then 
we may, 
indeed, 
imagine 
that 
intermediate 
bodies 
formed 
will 
be intermediate 
in 
size 
between 
the 
particles 
of 
air 
and 
of 
water. 
All 
of 
Timaeus's 
explanations 
seem 
to 
be of 
this 
kind: 
outlines 
that 
might 
be regarded 
as providing 
an indi- 
cation 
of 
the 
kind 
of 
explanation 
that 
could 
perhaps 
be 
constructed. 
Moreover, 
the 
outlines 
are 
all 
mathematical, 
and 
therefore 
relate 
to 
the 
'forms', 
not 
to 
the 
details 
of 
observed 
appearances, 
the 
insubstantial 
details 
of 
the 
shadows 
on the 
wall 
of 
the 
cave, 
shadows 
of 
which 
we 
can 
have 
only 
'opinion', 
not 
'knowledge 
'. 
In 
fact, 
the 
scientific 
theory 
presented 
in 
the 
Timaeus 
seems 
to 
fit 
in 
quite 
well 
with 
the 
theory 
of 
knowledge 
developed 
1. 
Republic 
VII, 
534. 

45 
in 
the 
Republic, 
which 
was 
probably 
written 
at 
least 
ten 
years 
earlier, 
but 
which 
Plato 
apparently 
wishes 
us 
to 
imagine 
as having 
taken 
place 
two 
days 
before 
the 
dialogue 
recorded 
in 
Timaeus, 
the 
latter 
dialogue 
being 
concerned 
to 
place 
the 
ideal 
society 
described 
in 
the 
former 
in 
its 
cosmographical 
context, 
and 
to 
assert, 
in 
the 
story 
of 
Atlantis, 
that 
such 
an ideal 
society 
did 
once 
really 
exist 
in 
Athens. 
Kepler's 
use 
of 
Timaeus 
Kepler 
shared 
with 
Plato 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
Universe 
was 
in 
some 
sense 
an expression 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
God 
(or, 
more 
probably, 
in 
Plato's 
case, 
gods) 
who 
created 
it. 
They 
also 
shared 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
creator 
was 
a geometer. 
However, 
what 
Kepler 
demanded 
of 
a scientific 
theory 
was 
very 
different 
from 
what 
Plato 
demanded 
and 
there 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be much 
room 
for 
doubt 
that 
Kepler 
rejected 
the 
theory 
of 
matter 
described 
in 
the 
previous 
sections 
of 
this 
chapter. 
Certainly, 
in 
De Nive 
Sexangula 
(Prague, 
1611) 
he never 
even 
mentions 
poly- 
hedral 
elementary 
particles, 
not 
even 
as 
a possible 
way 
of 
accounting 
for, 
say, 
the 
action 
of 
cold 
air 
on water 
to 
form 
snow. 
However, 
Kepler 
was 
very 
far 
from 
rejecting 
the 
method 
Plato 
had 
employed 
in 
arriving 
at 
his 
theory. 
As I 
hope 
to 
show 
in 
later 
chapters, 
Kepler's 
use 
of 
mathematics 
in 
his 
cosmological 
works 
is 
very 
like 
Plato's 
use 
of 
mathematics 
in 
Timaeus. 
And 
if 
we turn 
from 
what 
Kepler 
does 
to 
what 
he 
says 
he is 
doing, 

46 
we find 
that 
the 
appeal 
is 
to 
the 
philosophy 
of 
mathematics 
developed 
by Proclus, 
that 
is, 
again, 
indirectly 
but 
not 
very 
indirectly, 
to 
Plato. 
The 
details 
of 
Kepler's 
geometry 
are, 
of 
course, 
mainly 
derived 
from 
Euclid.

II 
THE SIZE 
OF THE UNIVERSE 
AND THE STATUS OF THE SUN 
In 
a geocentric 
cosmology 
the 
Sun's 
motion 
is 
closely 
related 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
other 
planets, 
but 
in 
a heliocentric 
cosmology 
the 
Sun 
shares 
the 
immobility 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars. 
Whether 
one 
is 
then 
prepared 
to 
take 
the 
further 
step 
of 
asserting 
that 
the 
Sun 
has 
no special 
status 
but 
is 
simply 
another 
star 
proves 
to 
depend 
at 
least 
partly 
on whether 
one 
is 
willing 
to 
accept 
the 
consequence 
that 
the 
distance 
from 
the 
Sun 
to 
the 
nearest 
star 
must 
be very 
large 
indeed 
compared 
with 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
Sun 
and 
the 
Earth 
(far 
larger 
than 
would 
be required 
merely 
to 
ensure 
that 
annual 
parallaxes 
would 
be less 
than, 
say, 
1' 
of 
arc). 
Some of 
Kepler's 
contemporaries, 
among 
them 
Giordano 
Bruno 
and 
William 
Gilbert, 
not 
only 
accepted 
this 
consequence 
but 
went 
on to 
assert 
that 
the 
Universe 
was 
infinite. 
That 
Kepler 
did 
not 
share 
this 
view 
is 
apparent 
from 
the 
two 
works 
with 
which 
this 
thesis 
is 
mainly 
con- 
cerned: 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(Tübingen, 
1596) 
and 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
(Linz, 
1619). 
The 
titles 
proclaim 
both 
works 
to 
be concerned 
with 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Universe 
yet 
each 
deals 
only 
with 
the 
Solar 
system. 
Neither 
work 
even 
discusses 
the 
status 
of 
the 
Sun, 
though 
we know 
that 
by 
1606 
Kepler 
knew 
at 
least 
something 
of 
the 
cosmological 
work 
of 
Bruno 
and 
of 
Gilbert, 
since 
in 
De Stella 
Nova 
(Prague, 
1606) 
he 

48 
mentions 
their 
belief 
that 
the 
Universe 
is 
infinite' 
The 
reason 
for 
his 
silence 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographi- 
cum and 
in 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
is 
not 
far 
to 
seek: 
Kepler 
was 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
majority 
of 
his 
con- 
temporaries 
in 
believing 
that 
the 
Universe 
was finite 
and 
that 
the 
Sun held 
a privileged 
position. 
However, 
since 
this 
belief 
is 
crucial 
to 
the 
theories 
put 
forward 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
and 
in 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
it 
is 
of 
interest 
to 
examine 
the 
arguments 
Kepler 
adduces 
in 
support 
of 
it 
in 
other 
works. 
Koyre 
(1957) 
mentions 
that 
Kepler 
had 
meta- 
physical 
reasons 
for 
denying 
the 
infinity 
of 
the 
Universe 
and 
adds 
that 
these 
reasons 
were 
derived 
from 
his 
religious 
beliefs 
2. 
It 
is 
indeed 
true 
that 
Kepler 
sees 
the 
Sun, 
the 
stars 
and 
the 
intervening 
aether 
as 
manifesting 
the 
Trinity 
of 
the 
Father, 
the 
Son and 
the 
Holy 
Ghost3 
and 
this 
analogy 
would 
clearly 
be 
entirely 
unsatisfactory 
if 
the 
Sun were 
no more 
than 
a typical 
star, 
as 
in 
Bruno's 
system.. 
It 
should, 
however, 
be noted 
that 
when 
Kepler 
discusses 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
size 
of 
the 
Universe, 
in 
De Stella 
Nova 
(Prague, 
1606) 
and 
in 
the 
Epitome 
Astronomiae 
Copernicanae, 
Book 
I 
(Linz, 
1618), 
he does 
not 
mention 
his 
analogy 
at 
all, 
not 
even 
when, 
in 
the 
earlier 
work, 
he admits 
that

49 
he recoils 
from 
the 
idea 
of 
an infinite 
Universe: 
"The 
mere 
thought 
brings 
with 
it 
I 
know 
not 
what 
of 
secret 
horror, 
as 
one 
finds 
oneself 
wandering 
in 
this 
immensity, 
whose 
boundaries, 
whose 
centre, 
and 
thus 
any 
defined 
place 
at 
all, 
are 
all 
denied 
to 
exist"1. 
The 
analogy 
may, 
of 
course, 
have 
weighed 
with 
him 
in 
private, 
but 
he never, 
as 
far 
as 
I know, 
presented 
it 
as 
an argument 
for 
others. 
Kepler's 
philosophical 
argument 
against 
the 
idea 
of 
an infinite 
Universe 
is 
directed 
against 
the 
limi- 
tations 
it 
would 
place 
upon 
the 
value 
of 
observation. 
If 
the 
Universe 
is 
immense 
or 
infinite, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
we must 
believe 
it 
to 
contain 
objects 
we cannot 
observe, 
such 
as 
stars 
that 
are 
sometimes 
too 
far 
away 
for 
us 
to 
see 
them 
(such 
stars 
had 
been 
invoked 
to 
explain 
the 
apparent 
appearance 
of 
'new' 
stars 
in 
1572 
and 
1604), 
then 
we cannot 
know 
how to 
construct 
theories 
to 
explain 
what 
we observe. 
In 
the 
particular 
cases 
of 
the 
theories 
just 
mentioned 
Kepler 
is 
merely 
objecting 
to 
the 
cosmological 
equivalent 
of 
admitting 
as 
acceptable 
a theory 
that 
a forest 
fire 
might 
have 
been

which 
wandered 
in

where 
over 
the 
edge 
of

His 
more 
general 
demand, 
in 
modern 
terms, 
is 
that 
the 
word 
"Universe" 
must 
be taken 
to 
mean 
"observable 
Universe".

hardly 
surprising 
that 
he finds 
it 
possible 
to 
show 
that 
Aristotle 
is 
on his 
side1. 
However, 
Aristotle's 
proof 
that 
the 
Universe 
is 
finite 
will 
not 
serve 
Kepler's 
turn, 
since 
it 
depended 
on the 
motion 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
fixed 
stars 
and, 
as 
Kepler 
says 
in 
De Stella 
Nova: 
"Copernicus, 
having 
removed 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
would 
allow 
it 
to 
be infinite"2. 
Since 
Kepler 
is 
justly 
famed 
for 
misrepresenting 
Copernicus' 
ideas 
it 
may be as well 
to 
point 
out 
that 
on this 
occasion 
he is 
not 
doing 
so. 
In 
De Revolutionibus 
Copernicus 
writes: 
"For 
their 
strongest 
argument 
that 
the 
world 
is 
finite 
is 
motion. 
So let 
us 
leave 
it 
to 
the 
natural 
philosophers 
to 
debate 
whether 
the 
world 
be finite 
or infinite 
... "3. 
I shall 
not 
concern 
myself 
further 
with 
the 
entirety 
of 
Kepler's 
proof 
that 
the 
Universe 
is 
finite. 
This 
has 
been 
dealt 
with 
in 
some detail 
by Koyre 
in 
From 
the 
Closed 
World 
to 
the 
Infinite 
Universe 
and'I 
should 
have 
very 
little 
to 
add 
to 
his 
discussion 
of 
the 
larger 
issues. 
My concern 
is 
rather 
with 
Kepler's 
proof 
that 
special 
status 
must 
be accorded 
to 
the 
Sun. 
Kepler 
deals 
with 
this 
subject 
in 
two 
very 
different 
works:

on the 
new 
star 
of 
1604, 
and 
in 
Epitome 
Astronomiae 
Copernicanae 
(1618-1621), 
a textbook 
which 
is 
designed 
to 
cover 
the 
whole 
subject 
of 
Astronomy 
and 
is 
therefore 
a valuable 
guide 
to 
Kepler's 
opinions 
at 
this 
time 
(particularly 
since 
he provided 
it 
with 
an 
index). 
De Stella 
Nova 
(1606) 
The 
new star 
which 
was 
first 
seen 
on 9 October 
1604 
is 
now generally 
known 
as 
"Kepler's 
supernova", 
though 
Kepler 
was 
not 
the 
first 
astronomer 
to 
observe 
the 
star 
but 
merely 
learned 
of 
its 
appearance 
by 
report 
- 
the 
weather 
at 
Prague 
prevented 
him 
from 
seeing 
it 
until 
17 October. 
No doubt 
Kepler 
regarded 
this 
as 
evidence 
to 
confirm 
his 
belief 
that 
one 
of 
the 
astrological 
consequences 
to 
be expected 
from 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
star 
was an increase 
in 
rainfall. 
At 
this 
time, 
Kepler 
was 
deep 
in 
his 
work 
on the 
orbit 
of 
Mars, 
but 
he found 
time 
to 
write 
a pamphlet 
on the 
new star, 
Bericht 
vom Newen 
Stern, 
which 
was 
in 
print 
before 
the 
end 
of 
16041. 
His 
learned 
work 
on the 
star, 
De Stella 
Nova 
(Prague, 
1606)2, 
is 
much 
concerned 
with 
Astrology: 
Kepler 
naturally 
regarded 
it 
as 
significant 
that 
the 
new star 
should 
have 
appeared 
at 
the 
time 
of 
a conjunction 
of 
Jupiter, 
Mars 
and 
Saturn 
and 
in

52 
position 
close 
to 
that 
of 
the 
conjunction. 
The book 
also 
contains 
detailed 
observations 
of 
the 
position 
and 
brightness 
of 
the 
star: 
it 
being 
equally 
natural 
that 
Kepler 
should 
wish 
to 
establish 
that 
this 
new 
star, 
like 
Tycho's 
new star 
of 
1572, 
was 
indeed 
a 
fixed 
star 
and 
not, 
for 
example, 
an atmospheric 
phenomenon. 
The 
brightness 
observations 
have 
enabled 
twentieth-century 
astronomers 
to 
identify 
Kepler's 
star 
as a Type 
I 
supernova, 
that 
is, 
a fairly 
old 
star 
(poor 
in 
elements 
other 
than 
hydrogen 
and 
helium) 
which 
exploded, 
the 
total 
energy 
involved 
in 
the 
explosion 
being 
roughly 
equal 
to 
the 
binding 
energy 
of 
the 
Sun 
(about 
1049 
ergs). 
The 
star 
would 
not 
have 
been 
bright 
enough 
to 
be visible 
to 
the 
naked 
eye 
before 
it 
exploded. 
The 
explanations 
Kepler 
considers 
are 
much less 
melodramatic 
than 
the 
modern 
one. 
However, 
one 
of 
them, 
the 
suggestion 
that 
the 
star 
had 
come closer 
to 
the 
Earth 
and 
then 
retreated 
again, 
leads 
him 
to 
discuss 
the 
much 
wider 
problem 
of 
the 
size 
of 
the 
Universe 
and the 
Sun's 
place 
in 
it. 
Kepler 
establishes 
the 
special 
status 
of 
the 
Sun 
by 
an argument 
based 
on the 
observed 
appearance 
of 
the 
night 
sky 
(to 
the 
naked 
eye), 
the 
observed 
diameters 
of 
stars 
of 
various 
magnitudes 
and 
the 
assumption 
that 
stars 
of 
equal 
apparent 
magnitude 
are 
at 
equal 
distances 
from 
the 
Earth1. 
He considers

will 
SZ appear 
when 
seen 
from 
S1, 
assuming 
that 
the 
stars 
are 
equidistant 
from 
T? 
Kepler 
states 
that 
the 
answer 
is 
"roughly" 
2045', 
that 
is, 
more than 
five 
times 
the 
apparent 
diameter 
of 
the 
Sun 
seen 
from 
the 
Earth 
(which 
is 
about 
30'). 
Neither 
Caspar 
nor 
Koyre 
appears 
to 
have 
noticed 
that 
the 
true 
answer, 
from 
the 
figures 
Kepler 
uses, 
should 
have 
been 
about 
1°26' 
(see 
my reworking 
of 
the 
calculation 
in 
Appendix 
1). 
It 
seems, 
however, 
that 
Kepler 
himself 
did 
notice 
his 
mistake, 
since 
in 
the 
Epitome 
Astronomiae 
Coperni- 
canae 
(in 
a passage 
where 
he still 
takes 
the 
diameter 
of 
a second 
magnitude 
star 
to 
be 2') 
he says 
that 
the 

54 
answer 
is 
roughly 
three 
times 
the 
apparent 
diameter 
of 
the 
Sund. 
The mistake 
in 
the 
arithmetic 
does 
not, 
- 
however, 
vitiate 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
argument 
since 
even 
with 
the 
lower 
value 
for 
the 
diameter 
it 
is 
still 
clear 
that 
the 
sky 
seen 
from 
S1, 
S2 or 
S3 will 
be 
very 
unlike 
the 
sky 
seen 
from 
the 
Earth 
(or 
from 
the 
Sun) 
-a 
result 
which 
is 
incompatible 
with 
Kepler's 
assumption 
that 
an infinite 
Universe 
must 
be homo- 
geneous, 
that 
is, 
that 
it 
must 
look 
the 
same 
ir- 
respective 
of 
the 
position 
of 
the 
observer. 
Moreover, 
as Kepler 
points 
out, 
these 
three 
stars 
in 
Orion 
are 
by 
no means 
the 
closest 
stars-of 
similar 
magnitudes 
that 
we observe 
in 
our 
sky. 
As will 
be seen 
from 
my 
reworking 
of 
Kepler's 
calculation, 
this 
result 
is 
independant 
of 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
stars 
from 
the 
Earth. 
Furthermore, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
if, 
in 
pursuance 
of 
simplicity, 
the 
differences 
in 
apparent 
magnitudes 
of 
stars 
are 
ascribed 
entirely 
to 
their 
being 
at 
different 
distances 
from 
the 
Earth, 
then 
Kepler's 
argument 
extends 
to 
any 
grouping 
of 
stars 
whose 
magnitudes 
are 
similar 
to 
one 
another. 
Kepler's 
attempts 
to 
give 
a convincing 
value 
for 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
nearest 
fixed 
stars 
will 
be discussed 
in 
a later 
section 
of 
this 
chapter.

The 
assumption 
that 
stars 
of 
equal 
apparent 
magnitude 
are 
at 
the 
same 
distance 
from 
the 
Earth 
is 
not 
an 
unreasonable 
one, 
but 
Kepler 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
slightly 
unhappy 
with 
it, 
for 
he proceeds 
to 
show 
that 
his 
argument 
is 
still 
valid 
if 
the 
assumption 
is 
dropped. 
Koyre 
(1957) 
recounts 
the 
progress 
of 
Kepler's 
reasoning 
in 
detail, 
and 
does 
not, 
it 
appears, 
feel 
the 
need 
to 
supply 
the 
diagrams 
Kepler 
himself 
omitted. 
When I 
began 
to 
draw 
the 
diagrams 
I 
required 
to 
follow 
the 
line 
of 
the 
argument, 
I 
found 
myself 
driven 
back 
first 
on algebra 
(Kepler 
was, 
it 
seems, 
introduced 
to 
algebra 
by 
Jobst 
BUrgi 
in 
about 
1600) 
and 
eventually 
on the 
entirely 
anachronistic 
technique 
of 
differential 
calculus. 
It 
seems 
to 
me that 
what 
Kepler 
claims 
to 
have 
proved 
is 
true, 
and 
his 
omission 
of 
the 
necessary 
working 
is 
presumably 
customary 
rather 
than 
malicious. 
In 
fact, 
a few 
diagrams 
can 
convince 
the 
reader 
of 
the 
plausibility 
of 
what 
I 
laboriously 
proved 
by means 
of 
calculus, 
and 
Kepler 
himself 
may well 
have 
had 
a 
geometrical 
proof 
along 
some lines 
that 
so 
far 
elude 
me. 
What 
vitiates 
Kepler's 
argument 
is 
neither 
his 
logic 
nor 
his 
mathematics 
but 
the 
observations 
he used. 
His 
value 
of 
2' 
for 
the 
diameter 
of 
a second 
magnitude 
star 
is, 
strangely 
enough, 
slightly 
larger 
than 
Tycho's 
value, 
as given 
in 
the 
Progymnasmatal, 
but

value 
is 
zero 
and 
Kepler's 
calculation 
cannot 
in 
fact 
be carried 
out 
at 
all. 
Once 
telescopes 
were 
turned 
on the 
stars 
the 
diameters 
began 
to 
be questioned: 
in 
the 
Sidereus 
Nuncius 
(Venice, 
1610) 
Galileo 
started 
the 
questioning, 
by pointing 
out 
that 
the 
stars 
do not 
seem to 
be magnified 
in 
the 
same proportion 
as the 
planets, 
and 
he spoke 
of 
the 
telescope's 
removing 
"factitious 
rays". 
By the 
time 
Kepler 
came to 
write 
Book 
I of 
the 
Epitome 
(Linz, 
1618) 
it 
seems 
as 
though 
he may have 
had 
serious 
doubts 
about 
the 
apparent 
diameters 
of 
stars, 
for 
the 
argument 
which 
had 
covered 
about 
three 
sides 
in 
the 
first, 
edition 
of 
De Stella 
Nova 
has 
shrunk 
to 
a very 
short 
paragraph 
in 
the 
later 
work 
(with 
the 
arithmetical 
correction 
that 
I 
noted 
above). 
Finally, 
in 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Epitome 
(Linz, 
1620) 
he wrote 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
that 
"Experienced 
workers 
(artifices) 
say 
that 
telescopic 
observation 
shows 
no 
size 
or 
roundness 
of 
body 
[i. 
e. 
no disc]; 
rather, 
that 
the 
better 
the 
instrument 
the 
more 
the 
fixed 
stars 
show 
as pure 
points 
from 
which 
luminous 
rays 
come 
out 
and 
disperse 
themselves, 
like 
hair"1.

we come to 
the 
Epitome, 
a textbook 
written 
in 
dialogue 
form

published 
in 
three 
instalments: 
Books

Book 
IV 
in 
1620 
and 
Books 
V 
to 
VII 
in

It 
is 
perhaps 
an indication 
of 
the 
importance 
that 
Kepler 
ascribed 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
size 
of 
the 
Universe 
that 
he deals 
with 
it 
very 
near 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Epitome, 
in 
the 
second 
part 
of 
Book 
I. 
To the 
question 
'Do 
you 
think 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
stars 
lie 
in 
one 
spherical 
surface? 
' 
Kepler 
gives 
the 
answer 
'This 
is 
not 
certain. 
Since 
some 
are 
bright 
and 
some 
faint 
it 
is 
not 
unlikely 
that 
the 
faint 
ones 
seem 
faint 
because 
they 
are 
far 
away, 
high 
up 
in 
the 
aether, 
whereas 
those 
that 
seem 
bright 
are 
nearer 
to 
us. 
However, 
it 
is 
not 
absurd 
that 
two 
stars 
of 
unequal 
apparent 
magnitude 
should 
be at 
an equal 
distance 
from 
us. 
But 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
the 
planets 
are 
not 
in 
the 
same 
spherical 
surface 
as 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
but 
are 
beneath 
them, 
for 
they 
some- 
times 
occult 
the 
fixed 
stars-but 
are 
never 
occulted 
by 
them'.

'If

of 
the 
ancients, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
because 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
stars 
do 
not 
all 
lie 
in 
one 
spherical 
surface 
then 
their 
distribution 
in 
space 
must 
be 
uniform. 
Kepler 
suggests 
it 
is 
in 
fact 
as 
shown 
in 
the 
next 
diagram 
(see 
figure 
2.3) 
The 
alter 
ego 
then 
naturally 
asks 
for 
arguments 
to 
support 
this 
contention. 
2.3 
Non-homogeneous 
Universe 
(KGW 7, 
p. 
L3). 
Kepler's 
first 
argument 
is 
from 
packing: 
if 
the 
distribution 
of 
stars 
were 
uniform 
we 
should 
have 
only 
twelve 
nearest 
neighbours. 
Our 
next 
nearest 
neighbours 
would 
be 
twice 
as 
far 
away 
and 
would 
be 
slightly 
more 
numerous, 
the 
next 
nearest 
would 
be 
three 
times 
as 
far 
away, 
and 
so 
on. 
This 
does 
not 
correspond 
to 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
night 
sky, 
in 
which 
we 
see 
large 
numbers 
of 
stars 
of 
closely 
similar 
brightness 
and 

60 
the 
gradation 
to 
fainter 
and 
fainter 
stars 
seems 
to 
proceed 
quite 
smoothly. 
From 
the 
way 
in 
which 
Kepler 
presents 
this 
argument, 
one 
would 
suppose 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
packing 
was 
a 
thoroughly 
familiar 
one, 
except 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
explains 
the 
number 
twelve 
as the 
number 
of 
vertices 
of 
a regular 
icosahedron. 
This 
explanation, 
together 
with 
the 
answer 
to 
the 
alter 
ego's 
next 
question 
('Why 
do you 
use 
the 
icosahedron? 
') 
raises 
more 
prob- 
lems 
than 
it 
solves 
if 
one 
refers 
it 
to 
the 
problem 
in 
hand, 
which 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
packing 
equal 
spheres. 
This 
problem 
does 
not 
in 
fact 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
a familiar 
one 
in 
Kepler's 
day. 
Indeed, 
historians 
credit 
Kepler 
himself 
with 
having 
given 
the 
first 
mathematical 
account 
of 
the 
problem, 
in 
De Nive 
Sexangula 
(Prague, 
1611), 
a very 
short 
book, 
written 
as a New Year 
gift 
for 
Kepler's 
patron 
Wackher 
von 
Wackenfels, 
and 
despite 
its 
title 
concerned 
to 
a large 
extent 
with 
a detailed 
account 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
honeycomb. 
In 
this 
work 
Kepler 
proceeds 
carefully 
step 
by step 
until 
he has 
described 
the 
packing 
of 
equal 
spheres 
which 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
packing 
of 
rhombic 
dodecahedra 
which 
defines 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
honeycomb. 
His 
account 
reads 
very 
much 
as 
if 
he 
expected 
his 
readers 
to 
be entirely 
unfamiliar 
with

the 
idea 
of 
packing 
and 
this 
impression 
is 
confirmed 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
he has 
even 
gone 
so 
far 
as 
to 
include 
a pair 
of 
diagrams. 
One of 
the 
structures 
he asks 
the 
reader 
to 
imagine 
in 
the 
course 
of 
his 
exposition 
is 
a sphere 
packed 
round 
with 
twelve 
other 
spheres, 
all 
the 
spheres 
being 
of 
equal 
size. 
It 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
earlier 
stages 
of 
the 
procedure 
that 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
outer 
layer 
of 
spheres 
will 
lie 
at 
the 
twelve 
vertices 
of 
a cuboctahedron 
(see 
figure 
2.14)1 
The 
way Kepler 
describes 
the 
pattern 
is 
as 
three 
layers 
of 
spheres, 
the 
top 
and 
bottom 
layers 
having 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
spheres 
at 
the 
vertices 
of 
equilateral 
triangles 
and 
the 
middle 
layer 
having 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
spheres 
at 
the 
vertices 
of 
a regular 
hexagon 
and 
at 
its 
centre. 
One may think 
of 
the 
vertices 
and 
centre 
of 
a regular 
icosahedron 
as 
also 
lying 
in 
three

62 
layers, 
somewhat 
like 
those 
in 
the 
true 
arrangement, 
having 
equilateral 
triangles 
on the 
two 
outer 
layers, 
but 
with 
an inner 
layer 
which 
is 
not 
quite 
flat 
(see 
figure 
2.5). 
(In 
figures 
2.4 
and 
2.5 
the 
centres 
in 
the 
outer 
layers 
have 
been 
indicated 
with 
rings, 
those 
in 
the'inner 
ones 
with 
spots. 
) 
Kepler's 
explanation 
as 
to 
why he should 
refer 
to 
the 
icosahedron 
in 
this 
connection 
is 
that 
it 
is 
the 
regular 
polyhedron 
which 
best 
describes 
the 
distribution. 
It 
seems 
as 
though 
he felt 
that 
only 
a regular 
polyhedron 
was 
appropriate 
in 
explaining 
a fundamental 
property 
such 
as 
this. 
I 
shall 
have 
occasion 
to 
return 
to 
this 
suggestion 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
main 
subject 
of 
this 
thesis. 
Having 
established 
that 
the 
distribution 
of 
stars 
cannot 
be uniform, 
Kepler 
briefly 
returns 
to 
the 
argument 
concerning 
the 
apparent 
diameters 
of 
stars 
which 
he used 
in 
De Stella 
Nova. 
However, 
he omits 
the 
part 
which 
considered 
the 
possibility 
that 
stars 
of 
the 
same magnitude 
might 
be at 
different 
distances 
and 
he 
gives 
no reference 
to 
his 
earlier 
and 
more 
detailed 
account. 
Kepler 
often 
does 
refer 
his 
reader 
to 
his 
other 
works 
so his 
silence 
in 
this 
instance 
may in- 
dicate 
that 
he was 
no longer 
satisfied 
with 
what 
he 
had 
written 
in 
De Stella 
Nova. 
On the 
other 
hand, 
he 
may merely 
have 
thought 
that 
his 
new argument 
from 
packing 
was more 
convincing 
than 
the 
old 
one. 
However, 
the 
conclusion 
he proceeds 
to 
draw, 
namely 
that 
the 
fixed 
stars 
are 
closer 
to 
one another 
than 
they 
are 
to 

63 
the 
Sun, 
follows 
from 
the 
new argument 
only 
if 
their 
differences 
in 
apparent 
magnitude 
are 
ascribed 
almost 
entirely 
to 
their 
different 
distances 
from 
the 
Earth 
(or 
the 
Sun). 
Kepler 
accordingly 
goes 
on to 
discuss 
how a modification 
of 
this 
assumption 
would 
affect 
his 
argument. 
Uniform 
packing 
of 
identical 
stars 
implies 
that 
we should 
see 
only 
twelve 
very 
bright 
stars. 
Since 
we see 
many 
more, 
most 
of 
them 
must 
be 
further 
away, 
and 
intrinsically 
brighter 
than 
the 
nearer 
ones 
so as 
to 
appear 
equally 
bright 
to 
us. 
As 
Kepler 
points 
out, 
the 
region 
round 
the 
Sun would 
then 
be special 
in 
being 
surrounded 
by 
intrinsically 
fainter 
stars; 
and, 
moreover, 
the 
theory 
itself 
seems 
implau- 
sible. 
He concludes 
that 
"it 
is 
more 
probable 
that 
stars 
of 
roughly 
equal 
apparent 
magnitude 
should 
be 
at 
roughly 
the 
same 
distance 
from 
us, 
and 
that 
the 
dense 
crowd 
of 
so many 
stars 
should 
form 
a sort 
of 
hollow 
sphere" 
(KGW 7, 
p. 
44). 
In 
either 
case, 
however, 
the 
Sun's 
position 
would 
be special. 
Kepler's 
astronomical 
hypothesis, 
that 
stars 
of 
equal 
apparent 
magnitude 
are 
at 
equal 
distances 
from 
us 
(that 
is, 
that 
all 
stars 
are 
of 
equal 
intrinsic 
luminosity) 
is 
a very 
reasonable 
one, 
and 
it 
was 
popular 
for 
a long 
time 
after 
Kepler's 
death. 
It 
has 
now been 
shown 
to 
be incorrect: 
stable 
stars 
may have 
luminosities 
up 
to 
about 
107 
times 
the 
luminosity 
of 
the 
Sun. 
The 
hypothesis 
that 
all 
stars 
have 
the 
same 
mass 
fares 
rather 
better: 
masses 
seem 
to 
vary 
only 

64 
between 
about 
0.4 
solar 
masses 
and 
about 
100 solar 
masses. 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
hypothesis, 
that 
in 
an 
infinite 
Universe 
the 
distribution 
must 
be uniform, 
is 
now usually 
known 
as 
'the 
cosmological 
principle' 
and 
stated 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a demand 
that 
there 
shall 
be no privileged 
observer. 
However, 
the 
implied 
uniformity 
is 
taken 
to 
refer 
not 
to 
stars, 
nor 
even, 
usually, 
to 
galaxies, 
but 
to 
clusters 
of 
galaxies. 
Kepler's 
argument 
from 
packing 
is, 
like 
his 
earlier 
argument 
from 
the 
apparent 
diameters 
of 
stars, 
logically 
and 
mathematically 
sound, 
but 
whereas 
the 
earlier 
argument 
was vitiated 
by 
the 
observational 
'facts' 
it 
was based 
on, 
the 
new argument 
is 
vitiated 
by 
Kepler's 
very 
reasonable, 
but 
in 
fact 
erroneous, 
assumptions 
about 
the 
absolute 
luminosities 
of 
stars 
and 
the 
properties 
one 
should 
expect 
to 
characterise 
an infinite 
Universe. 
The Milky 
Way 
In 
both 
De Stella 
Nova' 
and 
in 
the 
Epitome2 
Kepler 
appeals 
to 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
Milky 
Way in 
support 
of 
his 
description 
of 
the 
arrangement 
of 
the 
stars 
in 
space. 
In 
the 
later 
work 
he in 
fact 
proves 
that 
we 
are 
situated 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
circle 
defined

the 
Milky 
Way, 
his 
method 
of 
proof 
being 
that 
used 
by 
Ptolemy 
to 
show 
that 
the 
Earth 
is 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
equinoctial 
circlet. 
The 
Milky 
Way is 
then 
asserted 
to 
be so placed'as 
to 
define 
the 
boundary 
between 
the 
Solar 
system 
and 
the 
region 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars. 
The 
distance 
to 
the 
nearest 
fixed 
stars 
The 
Copernican 
theory 
suggested 
a way 
of 
finding 
the 
distances 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
namely 
by 
finding 
their 
annual 
parallax. 
Tycho 
Brahe 
naturally 
rose 
to 
the 
challenge 
of 
trying 
to 
observe 
such 
parallaxes. 
He was 
convinced 
that 
his 
observations 
were 
suffic- 
iently 
accurate 
to 
allow 
him 
to 
detect 
any 
parallax 
greater 
than 
1' 
of 
arc 
and, 
since 
he did 
not 
detect 
any, 
he concluded 
that 
the 
distances 
to 
the 
stars 
must 
be so great 
that 
the 
observed 
stellar 
diameters 
of 
2' 
for 
a first 
magnitude 
star, 
1'30" 
for 
a second 
mag- 
nitude 
star 
etc. 
2, 
would 
correspond 
to 
stellar 
radii 
comparable 
with 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
Earth 
and 
the 
Sun, 
if, 
that 
is, 
the 
Copernican 
theory 
were 
correct. 
He not 
unnaturally 
regarded 
this 
as 
a reductio 
ad 
absurdum 
disproof 
of 
the 
Copernican 
theory.

66 
connection, 
therefore, 
Tycho's 
observations 
were 
of 
no use 
at 
all 
to 
Kepler: 
the 
distances 
to 
the 
stars 
had 
to 
be decided 
on purely 
theoretical 
grounds. 
The 
theory 
Kepler 
used 
is 
similar 
to 
that 
Archimedes 
ascribes 
to 
Aristarchus 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Sand- 
-Reckoner. 
He assumed 
that 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Sun to 
the 
maximum 
diameter 
of 
the 
orbit 
of 
Saturn 
should 
be equal 
to 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
maximum 
diameter 
of 
the 
orbit 
of 
Saturn 
to 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
stars. 
Thus 
the 
orbit 
of 
Saturn 
would 
be a geometric 
mean between 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
stars 
and 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Sun. 
Aristarchus, 
according 
to 
Archimedes, 
made 
the 
orbit 
of 
the 
Earth 
the 
geometric 
mean between 
the 
Sun and 
the 
stars. 
There 
are 
two 
versions 
of 
Kepler's 
calculation, 
again 
in 
De Stella 
Nova 
and 
in 
the 
Epitome. 
They 
differ 
only 
in 
the 
numerical 
values 
ascribed 
to 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
Earth 
and 
the'Sun 
(in 
each 
case 
taken 
as one 
tenth 
of 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
Sun and 
Saturn). 
In 
the 
earlier 
account 
this 
distance 
is 
taken 
as 
1432 
Earth 
radii 
and 
in 
the 
latter 
one 
as 
3469 
Earth 
radii. 
(The 
usual 
ancient 
value 
was 
1200 
Earth 
radii. 
) 
The 
resulting 
radii 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
stars 
are 
34,177,06611 
and 
"roughly" 
60,000,000 
Earth 
radii.

It 
is 
of 
interest 
to 
note 
that 
even 
Kepler's 
larger 
value 
for 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
Earth 
and 
the 
Sun 
is 
too 
small 
by a factor 
of 
about 
seven. 
His 
sizes 
for 
the 
Sun and 
planets 
would 
be too 
small 
by a 
similar 
factor 
and 
the 
Earth 
would 
therefore 
appear 
to 
him 
to 
be a more 
important 
component 
of 
the 
Solar 
system 
than 
it 
now appears 
to 
us. 
Kepler's 
finite 
cosmos 
The 
part 
of 
Kepler's 
cosmology 
concerned 
with 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Universe 
beyond 
the 
orbit 
of 
Saturn 
shows 
the 
same 
constancy 
as we shall 
find 
in 
the 
part 
of 
his 
cosmology 
that 
was 
concerned 
with 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Solar 
system. 
That 
Kepler 
was never 
forced 
to 
revise 
his 
beliefs 
about 
the 
distribution 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
is, 
in 
part, 
no more 
than 
a tribute 
to 
the 
impossibility 
of 
making 
any 
great 
appeal 
to 
observational 
evidence 
in 
con- 
structing 
a cosmology 
in 
Kepler's 
day. 
But 
however 
strong 
Kepler's 
metaphysical 
revulsion 
from 
an infinite 
Universe 
may have 
been 
- 
and, 
as Koyre 
(1957) 
has 
shown, 
we have 
good 
reason 
to 
believe 
it 
was 
considerable, 
and 
firmly 
based 
on the 
work 
of 
Aristotle 
- 
he never- 
theless 
felt 
the 
need 
to 
seek 
observational 
support 
for 
his 
model 
of 
the 
Universe. 
The 
first 
observational 
evidence 
to 
which 
he appealed, 
the 
apparent 
diameters 
of 
stars, 
was 
shown 
to 
be faulty 
by 
the 
improved 
observations 
made 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
telescopes, 
but 
Kepler 

68 
managed 
to 
construct 
another 
argument 
based 
on ob- 
servation, 
this 
time 
the 
relatively 
unassailable 
observation 
of 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
night 
sky. 
However, 
in 
arguing 
from 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
night 
sky 
Kepler 
was 
forced 
to 
make 
assumptions 
about 
the 
absolute 
luminosities 
of 
stars 
and 
the 
form 
of 
dis- 
tribution 
to 
be expected 
in 
an infinite 
Universe. 
Both 
assumptions 
would 
have 
seemed 
very 
reasonable 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
Kepler's 
contemporaries. 
Both 
have 
since 
been 
shown 
to 
be erroneous. 
Yet 
if 
we remind 
ourselves 
that 
the 
'observable 
Universe' 
of 
Kepler's 
day 
was in 
fact 
all 
but 
entirely 
made up of 
what 
are, 
by astronomical 
standards, 
very 
local 
objects: 
the 
bright 
stars 
of 
our 
local 
spiral 
arm, 
a few 
globular 
clusters 
in 
the 
galactic 
halo 
and 
only 
one 
extragalactic 
object, 
the 
Andromeda 
nebula 
(which 
looks 
like 
a sixth 
magnitude 
star), 
we must 
acknowledge 
that 
the 
reality 
bears 
considerably 
more 
resemblance 
to 
the 
relatively 
compact 
model 
proposed 
by Kepler 
than 
it 
does 
to 
the 
infinite 
extent 
of 
stars 
described 
by Bruno. 
Observational 
evidence 
was 
to 
destroy 
Kepler's 
model 
after 
his 
death 
but 
during 
his 
lifetime 
there 
were 
no convincing 
observational 
arguments 
against 
the 
model 
he had 
described 
in 
1606: 
"The 
perfection 
of 
the 
world 
is 
motion, 
which 
is 
as 
it 
were 
its 
life. 
For 
motion 
three 
things 
are 
required: 
mover, 
moved 
and 
place. 
The 
mover 
is 
the 
Sun, 
the 
moved 
are 
the 
planets 

a 
69 
Mercury 
to 
Saturn, 
the 
place 
is 
the 
outermost 
sphere, 
that 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars. 
If 
a physical 
thing 
may be expressed 
in 
mathematical 
terms, 
the 
moved 
are 
a mean 
proportional 
between 
the 
mover 
and 
the 
place.... 
If 
the 
moved 
are 
in 
a physical 
sense 
a mean 
proportional 
between 
the 
mover 
and 
the 
place, 
it 
is 
the 
more 
likely 
that 
the 
same 
should 
be true 
mathematically, 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
moved 
being 
a mean 
pro- 
portional 
between 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
Sun, 
the 
mover, 
and 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
place, 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars"1. 
This 
model 
of 
the 
Universe 
seemed 
to 
Kepler 
to 
be so 
well 
established 
that 
he was 
apparently 
happy 
to 
explain 
it 
by analogy 
with 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
God who had 
created 
the 
Universe, 
the 
analogy 
being 
mentioned 
even 
in 
the 
Epitome, 
which 
is, 
by Kepler's 
standards, 
a very 
matter 
of 
fact 
work, 
as 
befits 
a textbook. 
Since 
Kepler 
believed 
that 
the 
Solar 
system 
had 
been 
shown 
to 
be a 
uniquely 
important 
part 
of 
God's 
Universe 
it 
was 
clearly 
in 
order 
for 
him 
to 
appeal 
to 
the 
very 
highest 
prin- 
ciples 
when 
searching 
for 
an 
explanation 
of 
its 
structure. 
As we shall 
see, 
his 
explanation 
was 
to 
make 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Solar 
system 
a reflection 
of 
the 
properties 
of 
Euclidean 
space.

MYSTERIUM COSMOGRAPHICUM 1596 
The 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(Tübingen, 
1596), 
like 
all 
Kepler's 
later 
astronomical 
works, 
was written 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
God and 
dedicated 
to 
establishing 
what 
Kepler 
saw as the 
Copernican 
system. 
Any 
account 
of 
Kepler's 
work 
must 
therefore 
begin 
with 
Copernicus. 
On the 
Revolution 
Geocentric 
astronomy, 
based 
ultimately 
on the 
Almagest, 
enabled 
one 
to 
calculate 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
various 
circles 
or 
spheres 
that 
were 
required 
to 
give 
a mathematical 
or 
physical 
explanation 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
any 
individual 
planet. 
It 
did 
not, 
however, 
provide 
any 
means 
of 
relating 
the 
resulting 
orbs 
or 
orbits 
one 
to 
another. 
The 
relationship 
between 
the 
orbits 
was 
provided 
by 
the 
physical 
as- 
sumption 
that 
there 
were 
no gaps 
between 
the 
spheres 
of 
neighbouring 
planets. 
It 
was 
further 
assumed 
that 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
lay 
immediately 
beyond 
the 
outermost 
planetary 
sphere. 
Moreover, 
geocentric 
astronomy 
also 
failed 
to 
provide 
any 
means 
of 
ascer- 
taining 
the 
order 
in 
which 
the 
planetary 
spheres 
should 
be placed. 
However, 
there 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
almost 
perfect 
agreement 
that 
the 
order 
adopted 
should 
correspond 
to 
decreasing 
sidereal 
period 
(working 
inwards 
from 
the 
fixed 
stars). 
This 
was 
the 
order 
adopted 
by 
Ptolemy 
(Almagest 
IX, 
1) 
- 
with 
the 
comment 

71 
that 
it 
was not 
a matter 
of 
dispute 
among 
philosophers. 
Copernicus 
knew 
that 
his 
own astronomy 
allowed 
him 
to 
find 
the 
actual 
sizes 
of 
the 
planetary 
spheres 
(and 
thus 
the 
order 
of 
the 
planets), 
that 
it 
enabled 
him, 
in 
fact, 
to 
construct 
a true 
system 
of 
planets. 
He makes 
this 
clear 
in 
the 
letter 
in 
which 
he dedicates 
De Revolutionibus 
to 
Pope 
Paul 
III: 
"... 
the 
orders 
and 
sizes 
of 
the 
stars, 
and 
all 
their 
orbs, 
and 
the 
heaven 
itself 
are 
so connected 
that 
nothing 
can 
be altered 
in 
any 
part 
of 
it 
without 
bringing 
confusion 
to 
all 
the 
remaining 
parts 
and 
to 
the 
whole 
universe"1. 
The 
order 
of 
the 
planets 
is 
described 
in 
De Revolutionibus, 
Book 
I, 
Ch. 
X (NKG, 
vol. 
II, 
p. 
25). 
This 
passage 
is 
prefaced 
by a discussion 
of 
all 
the 
orders 
that 
have 
been 
suggested 
by 
earlier 
astronomers, 
but 
Copernicus 
does 
not 
settle 
the 
matter, 
as 
he 
could 
have 
done, 
with 
the 
clear 
statement 
that 
his 
own system 
allows 
the 
order 
to 
be calculated. 
He merely 
justifies 
his 
adopted 
order 
by an appeal 
to 
the 
observed 
sidereal 
periods. 
The 
spacing 
of 
the 
planets 
is 
not 
mentioned 
at 
all 
in 
this 
chapter, 
and 
not 
only 
in 
the 
printed 
text 
of 
De Revolu- 
tionibus 
but 
even 
in 
Copernicus' 
manuscript 
we find 
that 
the 
diagram 
which 
accompanies 
this 
part 
of 
the 
text 
apparently 
shows 
a neat 
set 
of 
contiguous 
spheres 
(see 
figure 
3.1 
and 
figure 
3.2). 
On closer 
inspection, 
however, 
it 
seems 
that 
in 
the 
printed 
diagram 
the 
spheres

are 
in 
fact 
indicated 
as pure 
circles, 
without 
any 
thickness, 
except 
for 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
Earth, 
which 
carries 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
Moon. 
The names 
must 
apply 
to 
the 
circle 
outside 
which 
each 
is 
written. 
(If 
the 
names 
were 
meant 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
annuli 
in 
which 
they 
appear 
then 
there 
would 
be a gap 
between 
the 
sphere 
of 
Mars 
and 
that 
of 
the 
Earth, 
though 
nowhere 
else. 
) 
Though 
the 
spheres 
in 
the 
diagram 
do turn 
out 
to 
be 
detached, 
the 
spaces 
shown 
between 
them 
are 
not 
at 
all 
realistic. 
Moreover, 
when 
the 
sizes 
of 
the 
individual 
planetary 
spheres 
are 
calculated, 
in 
De 
Revolutionibus, 
Book 
V, 
each 
planet 
is 
dealt 
with 
in 
a separate 
chapter, 
exactly 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
Almagest. 
In 
fact, 
Copernicus' 
presentation 
is 
such 
that, 
if 
he had 
not 
actually 
stated 
in 
the 
dedicatory 
letter 
that 
his 
cosmology 
allowed 
him 
to 
give 
a syste- 
matic 
description 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs, 
and 
to 
con- 
struct 
a unitary 
system 
including 
all 
the 
orbs, 
his 
readers 
might 
have 
been 
forgiven 
for 
failing 
to 
notice 
the 
fact. 
Historians 
will 
doubtless 
long 
continue 
to 
argue 
about 
Copernicus' 
own account 
of 
his 
theory, 
but 
there 
seems 
to 
be general 
agreement 
that 
the 
first 
account 
of 
the 
Copernican 
theory 
which 
emphasised 
its 
systematic 
aspects 
was 
in 
Kepler's 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
Kepler's 
first 
chapter 
is 
entitled 
"What 
reasons 
make 
Copernicus' 
hypotheses 
plausible. 
And an explanation 
of 
Copernicus' 
hypotheses". 
The 
first

is

are 
shown 
realistically, 
that 
is 
in 
the 
correct 
relative 
sizes 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
20), 
and 
the 
fixed 
stars 
are 
prudently 
omitted. 
The diagram 
and 
its 
accompanying 
key 
also 
indicate 
how the 
sizes 
of 
the 
orbits 
can 
be calculated 
from 
observations 
(see 
figure 
3.3). 
The 
contrast 
with 
Copernicus' 
own work 
is, 
indeed, 
very 
striking, 
and 
this 
chapter, 
whose 
text 
lives 
up 
to 
its 
diagrams, 
has 
understandably 
received 
a great 
deal 
of 
attention 
from 
historians1. 
However, 
the 
fame 
of 
the 
four 
questions 
with 
which 
Kepler 
challenges 
supporters 
of 
the 
Ptolemaic 
system 
should 
not 
dazzle 
the 
reader 
so completely 
that 
he loses 
sight 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
main 
concern 
of 
Kepler's 
book 
is 
to 
answer 
two 
quite 
different, 
and 
much 
less 
"modern", 
questions, 
namely 
"Why 
are 
there 
six 
planets? 
" and 
"Why 
are 
the 
five 
gaps 
between 
them 
the 
particular 
sizes 
that 
we can 
now show 
them 
to 
be? " 
Neither 
of 
these 
two 
questions 
can 
be asked 
if 
the 
structure, 
of 
the 
world 
is 
that 
described 
in 
the 
con- 
ventional 
geocentric 
cosmology, 
since 
the 
geocentric 
cosmology 
had 
seven 
planets 
(the 
Moon,. 
Mercury, 
Venus, 
the 
Sun, 
Mars, 
Jupiter 
and 
Saturn) 
instead 
of'Copernicus' 
six 
(Mercury, 
Venus, 
the 
Earth 
with 
the 
Moon, 
Mars, 
Jupiter 
and 
Saturn). 
Moreover, 
as we have 
seen, 
the 
conventional 
cosmology 
did 
not 
admit 
a purely 
astro- 
nomical 
method 
of 
finding 
the 
distances 
between 
the 
planets. 
It 
was 
therefore 
reasonable 
for 
Kepler 
to 
1. 
See 
i. a. 
Koyre 
(1961). 

77 
begin 
his 
work 
with 
a chapter 
of 
arguments 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
Copernican 
system, 
and 
reasonable 
too 
that 
he 
should 
regard 
the 
answers 
to 
all 
his 
questions 
as 
providing 
further 
support 
for 
Copernicus' 
theory. 
The 
history 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
The 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
was 
the 
only 
one 
of 
Kepler's 
works 
to 
go into 
a second 
edition 
in 
the 
author's 
lifetime. 
The 
second 
edition 
was 
printed 
in 
1621, 
by which 
time 
Kepler 
had 
changed 
his 
mind 
about 
quite 
a number 
of 
the 
ideas 
that 
he had 
put 
forward 
in 
1596. 
He therefore 
arranged 
that 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(Frankfurt, 
1621) 
should 
carry 
a very 
large 
number 
of 
notes. 
We are 
thus 
in 
the 
fortunate 
position 
of 
having 
the 
older 
Kepler's 
comments 
on the 
work 
he wrote 
in 
his 
youth. 
Some of 
them 
are 
rather 
brutal. 
For 
example, 
on the 
title 
of 
Chapter

he comments 
"all 
this 
chapter 
and 
what 
it 
deals 
with 
could 
be omitted, 
none 
of 
it 
matters" 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
62). 
The 
chapter 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
twelve-fold 
division 
of 
the 
Zodiac. 
However, 
the 
com- 
ment 
I 
have 
quoted 
is 
followed 
by 
three 
more 
sides 
of 
notes 
(in 
Caspar's 
edition), 
presumably 
intended 
for 
readers 
who were 
not 
deterred 
by 
it. 
In 
general, 
I 
have 
found 
that 
Kepler's 
notes 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
were 
very 
useful 
in 
clearing 
up doubtful 
points 
and 
in 
indicating 
which 
points 
Kepler 
believed 
were 
important 
- 
in 
1596,1621 

78 
or 
both. 
My analysis 
of 
the 
original 
edition 
of 
the 
work 
will 
therefore 
rely 
to 
some 
extent 
upon 
my analysis 
of 
the 
second 
edition, 
and 
certain 
parts 
of 
it 
will 
be 
postponed 
until 
my next 
chapter, 
which 
is 
explicitly 
concerned 
with 
the 
second 
edition. 
The 
full 
title 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
begins 
Prodromus 
Dissertationum 
Cosmographicarum, 
continens 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
de admirabili 
proportione 
orbium 
coelestium... 
. 
In 
the 
1621 
edition, 
Kepler 
explains 
the 
word 
Prodromus 
and 
comments 
on the 
words 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
15). 
We are 
told 
that 
the 
work 
was 
called 
Prodromus 
because 
at 
the 
time 
he wrote 
it 
Kepler 
hoped 
to 
write 
further 
cosmo- 
graphic 
dissertations. 
He explains 
that 
at 
the 
age 
of 
seventeen 
he had 
read 
J. C. 
Scaliger's 
Exercitationes 
Exotericae 
(Paris, 
1557). 
1 
This 
work 
had 
led 
him 
to 
make 
connections 
between 
his 
ideas 
on various 
different 
subjects 
"such 
as 
the 
heavens, 
souls, 
spirits, 
elements, 
the 
nature 
of 
fire, 
the 
origin 
of 
springs, 
the 
ebb 
and 
flow 
of 
the 
sea, 
the 
shape 
of 
continental 
land 
masses, 
and 
of 
the 
seas 
between 
them, 
and 
similar 
things" 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
15,1.8). 
So when 
he discovered 
the 
proportion 
between 
the 
celestial 
orbs 
he thought 
he might 
be able 
to 
find 
similar 
solutions 
to 
other 
problems. 
In 
the 
event, 
however, 
the 
"prodromus" 
had 
not 
been 
followed 
by 
any 
"epidromus", 
unless 
the 
reader 
might 
take 
the 
1. 
The work 
was written 
as 
a critique 
of 
Cardano's 
De Subtilitate 
and 
is 
in 
a similar 
meandering 
style. 

79 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
(Linz, 
1619) 
as 
its 
true 
successor, 
as 
being 
a much 
more 
thorough 
investigation 
of 
the 
same 
material. 
Turning 
to 
the 
words 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Kepler 
first 
complains 
that 
"Cosmography" 
is 
sometimes 
used 
for 
"Geography" 
and 
his 
work 
has 
on occasion 
been 
incorrectly 
catalogued 
by 
booksellers. 
Presumably 
he 
hopes 
that 
booksellers 
will 
read 
this 
note. 
On Mysterium 
he says 
"I 
used 
Mysterium 
for 
Arcanum 
[i. 
e. 
secret, 
hidden] 
and 
I 
have 
offered 
my discovery 
as 
such, 
since 
I 
had 
never 
read 
anything 
like 
it 
in 
a book 
by any 
philosopher" 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
15,1.33). 
Claims 
of 
complete 
originality 
are, 
in 
principle, 
always 
suspect 
- 
if 
only 
because 
accepting 
too 
many 
of 
them 
would 
make 
a History 
of 
Science 
read 
like 
an account 
of 
a succession 
of 
miracles. 
I 
am, 
however, 
inclined 
to 
accept 
Kepler's 
claim 
in 
this 
case: 
his 
disposition 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
to 
give 
too 
much 
credit, 
rather 
than 
too 
little, 
to 
the 
people 
from 
whom he had 
learned 
something 
he con- 
sidered 
valuable 
- witness 
his 
attitude 
to 
Copernicus 
- 
and 
he gives 
a fairly 
full 
account 
of 
how he 
came 
to 
his 
theory. 
The 
problem 
will 
be considered 
in 
more 
detail 
below, 
in 
connection 
with 
this 
description 
of 
the 
theory's 
origin. 
Kepler's 
annoyance 
at 
finding 
his 
work 
mis-classified 
by 
booksellers 
accounts 
for 
his 
wishing 
to 
explain 
the 
word 
cosmographicum. 
I 
cannot, 
however, 
think 
of 
any 
comparably 
simple 
reason 
why 
he should 
have 
wished 
to 

80 
explain 
the 
word 
mysterium. 
Rosen'(1975) 
has 
discussed 
at 
some length 
the 
various 
cuts 
and 
alterations 
that 
were 
made 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
at 
the 
order 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Tübingen, 
under 
whose 
auspices 
the 
work 
was published, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
that 
there 
was any 
discussion 
of 
the 
title 
of 
the 
work. 
The 
system 
of 
planets 
and 
polyhedra 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
The 
Copernican 
description 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
makes 
the 
circles 
which 
formed 
the 
deferents 
of 
the 
superior 
planets 
in 
the 
geocentric 
system 
into 
the 
true 
orbits 
of 
the 
planets. 
The 
circles 
which 
were 
the 
epicycles 
are 
then 
seen 
as 
no more 
than 
reflections 
of 
the 
annual 
orbital 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth. 
For 
the 
inferior 
planets, 
the 
former 
deferents 
are 
the 
orbit 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
the 
former 
epicycles 
the 
true 
orbits. 
Since 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
epicycles 
to 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
deferents 
can 
be calculated 
from 
observations, 
we can 
go on to 
calculate 
the 
true 
dimensions 
of 
the 
orbits 
of 
the 
planets, 
all 
dimensions 
being 
measured 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
orbit 
of 
the 
Earth. 
This 
calculation 
is 
not 
by 
any 
means 
as 
simple 
as 
the 
above 
brief 
account 
would 
suggest, 
since 
the 
heliostatic 
orbits, 
even 
when 
calculated 
from 
the 
observational 
data 
available 
to 
Copernicus, 
are 
not 
simple 
circles. 
However, 
a 
calculation 
can 
be carried 
out 
along 
the 
lines 
I 
have 

81 
indicated, 
and 
it 
shows 
that 
the 
orbits 
of 
the 
planets 
are 
widely 
separated. 
It 
is 
important 
at 
this 
point 
to 
note 
that 
while 
Copernicus' 
planetary 
theory 
does 
not 
involve 
notice- 
ably 
fewer 
circles 
than 
the 
geocentric 
theory 
it 
was 
proposed 
to 
replace 
- 
indeed, 
some methods 
of 
counting 
show 
Copernicus' 
theory 
as 
involving 
more 
circles 
than 
its 
predecessor 
- 
the 
Copernican 
orbits 
are 
very 
much 
closer 
to 
being 
circles 
than 
the 
geocentric 
orbits 
were, 
and 
the 
small 
Copernican 
epicycles 
make 
only 
a tiny 
contribution 
to 
filling 
the 
gaps 
between 
the 
circles 
which 
mark 
the 
mean 
orbits 
of 
the 
planets. 
Since 
Kepler 
asks 
supporters 
of 
the 
geocentric 
system 
to 
explain 
the 
sizes 
of 
their 
epicycles1 
it 
is 
hardly 
a matter 
for 
surprise 
that 
he 
should 
have 
taken 
it 
upon 
himself 
to 
explain 
the 
apparently 
arbitrary 
gaps 
between 
the 
planetary 
orbits 
in 
the 
Copernican 
system. 
However, 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
was 
the 
sizes 
of 
the 
gaps, 
rather 
than 
the 
sizes 
of 
the 
orbits, 
that 
he chose 
to 
attempt 
to 
explain 
suggests 
that 
he was 
still 
thinking 
at 
least 
partly 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
nested 
system 
of 
spheres 
shown 
in 
the 
geocentric 
cosmologies. 
It 
was 
only 
later 
that 
he was 
to 
concentrate 
his 
attention 
upon 
the 
Sun-planet 
relationship: 
when, 
that 
is, 
he was 
faced 
with 
an 
astronomical 
rather 
than 
a cosmological 
task, 
namely 
to

find 
the 
orbit 
of 
Mars 
in 
order 
to 
be able 
to 
predict 
future 
positions 
of 
the 
planet. 
The cosmological 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
explains 
the 
gaps 
between 
neighbouring 
planetary 
orbits 
by 
the 
relations 
between 
the 
circum- 
spheres 
and 
inspheres 
of 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids 
(the 
five 
convex 
regular 
polyhedra, 
shown 
in 
figure 
3.4). 
The mathematical 
basis 
of 
the 
theory 
is 
derived 
from 
Book 
XIII 
of 
Euclid's 
Elements. 
In 
modern 
terms 
it 
may be expressed 
as 
follows: 
The 
faces 
of 
a regular 
polyhedron 
are 
all 
regular 
polygons 
of 
the 
same shape 
and 
they 
meet 
in 
the 
same way 
at 
every 
vertex 
of 
the 
solid. 
Therefore, 
by symmetry, 
all 
the 
vertices 
must 
lie 
on a sphere 
and 
all 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
faces 
must 
lie 
on another 
sphere, 
which 
will 
touch 
the 
faces 
at 
these 
points. 
Again 
by 
symmetry, 
the 
two 
spheres 
will 
1 
be concentric. 
They 
are 
known 
as 
the 
circumsphere 
and 
the 
insphere 
of 
the 
polyhedron, 
and 
they 
are 
analogous 
to 
the 
circumcircle 
and 
incircle 
of 
a regular 
polygon. 
The ratio 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
two 
spheres 
for 
any 
given 
regular 
polyhedron 
is 
a fixed 
quantity 
and 
can 
be 
calculated 
fairly 
easily 
(even 
in 
the 
most 
difficult 
case). 
Appendix 
3 shows 
a possible 
method 
of 
carrying 
out 
the 
calculation 
for 
the 
fairly 
simple 
case 
of 
the 
cube. 
In 
fact, 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids 
yield 
only 
three 
ratios, 
since 
it 
can 
be shown 
that 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
spheres 
for 
the 
cube 
is 
equal 
to 
that 
for 
the 
octahedron, 
and 
the 
ratio 
for 
the 
dodecahedron 
is 
equal

From 
reading 
the 
text 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
one 
has 
the 
impression 
that 
Kepler 
takes 
the 
inner 
radius 
of 
each 
planetary 
orb 
as 
being 
equal 
to 
the 
planet's 
minimum 
distance 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
orbit 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
the 
outer 
radius 
as 
being 
equal 
to 
its 
maximum 
distance 
from 
it. 
However, 
Aiton 
(1977, 
and 
private 
communication) 
has 
checked 
Kepler's 
results 
and 
finds 
that 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
surfaces 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth 
have 
in 
fact 
been 
measured 
from 
the 
Sun, 
giving 
the 
orb 
a thickness 
equal 
to 
the 
eccentricity 
of 
the 
orbit 
of 
the 
Earth. 
It 
turns 
out 
that 
the 
dimensions 
of 
these 
planetary 
orbs 
are 
such 
that 
if 
a cube 
is 
inscribed 
in 
the 
inner 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Saturn 
then 
its 
insphere 
will 
be the 
outer 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Jupiter, 
and 
if 
a tetrahedron 
is 
inscribed 
in 
the 
inner 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Jupiter 
then 
its 
insphere 
will 
be the 
outer 
surface 

85 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Mars, 
and 
if 
a dodecahedron 
is 
inscribed 
in 
the 
inner 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Mars 
then 
its 
insphere 
will 
be the 
outer 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
if 
an icosahedron 
is 
inscribed 
in 
the 
inner 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth 
then 
its 
insphere 
will 
be the 
outer 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Venus, 
and 
if 
an 
octahedron 
is 
inscribed 
in 
the 
inner 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Venus 
its 
insphere 
will 
be the 
outer 
surface 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
Mercury. 
Kepler 
presents 
this 
system 
in 
the 
way 
I 
have 
described 
- working 
inwards 
from 
the 
sphere 
of 
Saturn 
so 
that 
we are 
alternately 
inscribing 
a 
regular 
polyhedron 
in 
a sphere 
and 
inscribing 
a sphere 
in 
a regular 
polyhedron. 
As we shall 
see 
later, 
the 
fit 
between 
the 
calculated 
ratios 
for 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
and 
the 
observational 
ratios 
for 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
is 
very 
good. 
Until 
quite 
recently, 
twentieth-century 
cosmologists 
would 
have 
been 
very 
pleased 
if 
their 
theories 
had 
fitted 
the 
observations 
as 
well 
as Kepler's 
do. 
It 
should 
be noted 
also 
that 
Kepler 
had 
succeeded 
in 
explaining 
not 
only 
the 
sizes 
of 
the 
orbs 
but 
also 
their 
number, 
since 
it 
was 
known 
that 
there 
were 
only 
five 
convex 
regular 
polyhedra. 
(A proof 
of 
this 
fact 
is 
given 
as 
a scholium 
to 
Proposition 
18 of 
Book 
XIII 
of 
the 
Elements 
and 
Kepler 
gives 
a summary 
of 
it 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
together 
with 
a reference 
to 
Euclid. 
Since 
the 
proof 
was, 
clearly, 
well 
known 
to 
Kepler's 
readers 
his 
repetition 
of 
it 
presumably 
indicates 
that 

86 
he wished 
to 
stress 
its 
relevance 
to 
his 
theory. 
) 
The brief 
account 
of 
Kepler's 
theory 
in 
Chapter 
II 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
is 
illustrated 
with 
a 
very 
handsome 
engraved 
plate 
which 
folds 
out 
of 
the 
book 
(see 
figure 
3.5). 
Some disembodied 
dotted 
lines 
have 
been 
drawn 
to 
indicate 
the 
positions 
of 
the 
centres 
of 
faces 
of 
the 
polyhedra 
and 
the 
points 
where 
their 
vertices 
touch 
the 
inner 
surfaces 
of 
spheres. 
Apart 
from 
these 
lines, 
the 
plate 
appears 
to 
show 
an actual 
model, 
on an elaborate 
stand 
which 
is 
very 
similar 
to 
the 
work 
of 
contemporary 
goldsmiths. 
The 
object 
looks 
so solid 
that 
it 
is 
only 
after 
a moment's 
thought 
that 
one 
realises 
that 
its 
various 
parts 
would 
not 
in 
fact 
support 
one 
another 
in 
the 
positions 
in 
which 
they 
are 
shown. 
The 
illusionistic 
rendering 
of 
impossible 
objects 
was, 
of 
course, 
no novelty. 
Beautiful 
examples 
are 
provided 
by 
the 
drawings 
Leonardo 
da Vinci 
(1452 
- 
1519) 
made to 
illustrate 
Luca 
Pacioli's 
De Divina 
Proportione 
(Venice, 
1509) 
(see 
figure 
3.6). 
(The 
published 
wood 
engravings 
based 
on the 
drawings 
have 
lost 
the 
strange 
intensity 
of 
the 
originals. 
I 
suspect 
that 
the 
engraver

purely 
mathematical 
entities. 
So, 
too, 
were 
the 
spheres, 
though 
Tycho 
Brahe's 
reading 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum 
seems 
to 
have 
left 
him 
with 
the 
impression 
that 
Kepler 
did 
believe 
in 
solid 
celestial 
spheres. 
There 
is 
certainly 
nothing 
in 
Kepler's 
theory 
that 
would 
tend 
to 
disprove 
their 
existence, 
but 
we do know 
that 
Kepler 
did 
not, 
even 
at 
this 
early 
stage, 
believe 
in 
solid 
spheres: 
in 
Chapter 
XVI 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
he 
calls 
the 
idea 
of 
such 
spheres 
"absurd" 
and 
"monstrous". 
This 
matter 
is 
considered 
more 
fully 
in 
Appendix 
2. 
In 
the 
plate 
which 
accompanies 
Chapter 
II 
(figure 
3.5), 
the 
thickness 
of 
each 
sphere 
has 
apparently 
been 
explained 
by 
showing 
it 
to 
contain 
a 
small 
circle 
which 
carries 
the 
planet. 
The 
circles 
shown 
are 
not, 
in 
fact, 
epicycles, 
since 
the 
deferent 
would 
not 
be concentric 
with 
the 
planetary 
sphere. 
The 
weakness 
of 
the 
plate 
as 
an astronomical 
diagram 
is 
underlined 
by 
the 
brevity 
of 
the 
key, 
which 
contains 
only 
twelve 
entries. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
uncooperative 
nature 
of 
the 
astronomical 
facts 
ensures 
that 
the 
inner 
part 
of 
the 
picture 
is 
exceedingly 
difficult 
to 
read. 
A very 
much 
clearer, 
and 
drier, 
diagram 
is 
provided 
to 
accompany 
the 
more 
detailed 
account 
of 
the 
theory 
in 
Chapter 
XIV 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
49) 
(figure 
3.7). 
In 
this 
diagram, 
the 
rather 
vague 
indication 
that 
the 
Sun 
is 
"the 
middle 
or 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe 
and 
at 
rest" 
is 
replaced 
by 
the 
more 
precise 
note 
that 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Great 
Orb 
is 
the 
centre 
of 
all 
the 
spheres

close 
to 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Sun 
itself". 
The 
next 
chapter 
contains 
two 
diagrams 
of 
the 
region 
close 
to 
the 
Sun, 
showing 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
deferents 
of 
planets, 
at 
the 
time 
of 
Ptolemy 
and 
at 
the 
time 
of 
Copernicus 
(KGW 11 
pp. 
52,53). 
This 
kind 
of 
detail 
is, 
of 
course, 
required 
for 
any 
serious 
attempt 
to 
fit 
the 
cosmological 
theory 
to 
the 
astronomical 
facts 
deduced 
from 
observations 
with 
the 
help 
of 
the 
Copernican 
theory. 
It 
is 
presumably 
this 
connection 
with 
observations 
which 
lies 
behind 
a 
feature 
of 
the 
diagram 
in 
Chapter 
XIV 
which 
has 
no 
counterpart 
in 
the 
elaborate 
engraved 
plate 
which 
accompanies 
Chapter 
II, 
namely 
the 
circle 
of 
the 
Zodiac 
which 
appears 
round 
the 
outside 
of 
the 
diagram. 
Between 
this 
circle 
and 
the 
orb 
of 
Saturn 
is 
a narrow 
space 
marked 
Z, 
explained 
in 
the 
key 
"Z 
is 
the 
space 
between 
Saturn 
and 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
like 
infinity". 
The 
first 
line 
of 
the 
key 
reads 
"The 
outermost 
circle, 
with 
the 
Zodiac, 
indicates 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
whose 
centre 
is 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
World 
or 
that 
of 
the 
Great 
Orb, 
or 
even 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Earth, 
because 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
Great 
Orb 
is 
insensibly 
small 
in 
comparison 
with 
it". 
These 
two 
statements 
seem 
to 
constitute 
the 
only 
mention 
of 
the 
relationship 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
to 
the 
fixed 
stars 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
They 
echo 
both 
Copernicus 
and, 
more 
closely, 
the 
wording 
round 
the 
diagram 
of 
the 
Universe 
which, 
it 
appears, 
Maestlin 
contributed 
to 
his 
edition 
of 
the 
Narratio 
Prima 
of 
Rheticus, 
published 
together 
with 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 

92 
graphicum 
in 
1596 
(see 
figure 
3.8). 
1 
It 
therefore 
seems 
likely 
that 
the 
statements 
I 
have 
quoted 
originated 
with 
Maestlin 
rather 
than 
with 
Kepler. 
In 
the 
summary 
of 
Kepler's 
theory 
in 
Chapter 
II 
it 
seemed 
that 
the 
thickness 
of 
each 
orb 
had 
been 
designed 
to 
accommodate 
the 
path 
of 
the 
planet 
between 
its 
two 
spherical 
surfaces. 
It 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
diagram 
in 
Chapter 
XIV 
that 
Kepler 
did 
really 
intend 
the 
orbs 
to 
include 
only 
the. 
true 
path 
of 
the 
planet, 
and 
not 
the 
circles 
used 
to 
construct 
it. 
This 
appears 
from 
his 
treatment 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Saturn, 
the 
only 
orb 
to 
be shown 
in 
detail, 
"to 
avoid 
obscuring 
the 
diagram 
with 
a 
quantity 
of 
lines" 
(Key 
to 
diagram, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
49). 
The 
two 
solid 
circles, 
marked 
H and 
I 
enclose 
"a 
thickness 
which 
the 
eccentric 
path 
of 
Saturn 
lays 
claim 
to". 
The 
dotted 
circles 
marked 
K and 
L show 
"the 
thickness 
which 
the 
whole 
epicycle 
and 
the 
equant 
require", 
-though 
"The 
planet 
is 
never 
actually 
above 
H or 
beneath 
I". 
The 
truth 
of 
the 
final 
assertion 
is 
not 
obvious, 
but 
may 
be verified 
by reference 
to 
Maestlin's 
account 
of 
Copernicus' 
model 
for 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
superior 
planets, 
printed 
in 
an appendix 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(KGW 1, 
pp. 
137-9).

Maestlin

he has

in 
Chapter 
XIV 
confirms 
the 
impression 
that 
Kepler 
had 
no intention 
of 
including 
epicycles 
in 
his 
orbs, 
and 
he repeats 
his 
statement 
to 
this 
effect 
when 
he briefly 
returns 
to 
the 
subject 
in 
Chapter 
XXII 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
75, 
1.30 
et 
seqq). 
As we have 
seen, 
the 
system 
of 
planetary 
orbs 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum/is, 
in 
effect, 
centred 
on the 
same empty 
point 
that 
was 
/u`sed 
by 
Copernicus 
as the 
centre 
of 
his 
system, 
namely 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Great 
Orb 
(though 
the 
radii 
defining 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth 
have 
been 
measured 
from 
the 
Sun), 
but 
since 
Kepler 
was 
concerned 
not 
with 
the 
circles 
used 
to 
construct 
the 
orbits 
but 
with 
the 
actual 
paths 
of 
the 
planets 
there 
was 
no compelling 
mathematical 
reason 
why he should 
have 
chosen 
this 
point. 
Presumably 
he 
chose 
it 
because 
it 
was 
the 
point 
to 
which 
Copernicus 
had 
referred 
the 
orbits.

The 
origin 
of 
Kepler's 
theory 
In 
the 
preface 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
Kepler 
describes 
how he was led 
to 
formulate 
his 
theory. 
He recounts 
how he studied 
Astronomy 
at 
Tübingen 
under 
Maestlin 
and then, 
while 
teaching 
Mathematics 
and 
Astronomy 
at 
Graz, 
found 
that 
astronomical 
studies 

95 
were 
absorbing 
more 
and 
more 
of 
his 
attention, 
whereas 
at 
Tübingen 
he had 
given 
much 
of 
his 
time 
to 
the 
study 
of 
Theology. 
It 
seems 
that 
Kepler, 
like 
many 
another, 
found 
that 
having 
to 
teach 
a subject 
made 
him 
learna 
great 
deal 
about 
it. 
The 
task 
which 
he had 
set 
himself 
was 
"to 
give 
physical 
or, 
if 
you 
prefer, 
metaphysical 
reasons" 
for 
what'Copernicus 
had 
described 
in 
mathe- 
matical 
terms 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
8,1.17). 
The 
reference 
to 
Copernicus' 
work 
is 
rather 
vague, 
"but 
Kepler 
presumably 
means 
that 
he will, 
for 
instance, 
give 
reasons 
for 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
planets. 
If 
he had 
meant 
that 
he would 
give 
reasons 
for 
accepting 
the 
Copernican 
System 
he 
surely 
would 
not 
have 
characterised 
Copernicus' 
rea- 
coning 
as merely 
mathematical. 
It 
should, 
however, 
be 
noted 
that 
Kepler's 
works 
are 
a rich 
mine 
of 
quotations 
which 
in 
other 
circumstances 
would 
suffice 
to 
convince 
any 
reasonable 
historian 
that 
the 
writer 
had 
not 
read 
De Revolutionibus 
with 
any 
great 
attention. 
Neverthe- 
less, 
as 
Aiton 
(1977) 
has 
`pointed 
out, 
we know 
that 
while 
he was writing 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
Kepler 
used 
not 
only 
Rheticus' 
Narratio 
Prima 
but 
also 
De Revolutionibus 
itself. 
In 
a letter 
dated 
3 October 
1595 
he had 
mentioned 
to 
Maestlin 
that 
he now possessed 
his 
own copy 
of 
Copernicus' 
work 
(KGW 13, 
letter 
23, 
1.455, 
p. 
45). 
However, 
even 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum, 
the 
work 
in 
which 
Kepler's 
Copernicanism 
most 
closely 
resembles 
that 
of 
Copernicus, 
it 
was 
not 
Kepler's 
purpose 
to 
give 
an historically 
correct 
account 

96 
of 
the 
work 
of 
Copernicus. 
There 
were 
three 
things, 
he tells 
us, 
that 
he particularly 
wanted 
to 
explain: 
"the 
Number, 
Size 
and Motions 
of 
the 
Orbs" 
(KGW it 
p. 
9,1.33). 
All 
three 
of 
these 
were 
different 
in 
the 
Copernican 
system 
from 
what 
they 
had 
been 
in 
the 
conventional 
geocentric 
system: 
there 
were 
six 
planetary 
orbs, 
instead 
of 
seven, 
their 
sizes 
could 
be calculated 
by astronomical 
methods 
and 
the 
true 
motions 
were 
very 
much more 
nearly 
circular. 
Kepler 
adds 
"I 
was made bold 
to 
attempt 
this 
by 
the 
beautiful 
harmony 
that 
exists 
between 
the 
the 
parts 
that 
are 
at 
rest, 
the 
Sun, 
the 
fixed 
stars 
and 
the 
intermediate 
space, 
and 
God the 
Father, 
the 
Son and 
the 
Holy 
Ghost: 
a similarity 
I 
shall 
pursue 
further 
through 
Cosmography. 
Since 
the 
parts 
that 
are 
at 
rest 
are 
disposed 
in 
this 
way, 
I 
did 
not 
doubt 
that 
the 
moving 
parts 
would 
also 
be 
harmonious" 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
9,1.37 
et 
seqq). 
Kepler 
first 
describes 
his 
false 
starts, 
which 
included 
an attempt 
to 
give 
an explanation 
of 
the 
sizes 
of 
the 
orbs 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
properties 
of 
numbers, 
and 
an attempt 
to 
describe 
the 
motions 
by 
reference 
to 
the 
lengths 
of 
lines 
cut 
off 
between 
one 
side 
of 
a square 
and 
a quadrant 
of 
a circle 
drawn 
with 
its 
centre 
at 
one 
vertex 
of 
the 
square 
and 
the 
side 
of 
the 
square 
as 
its 
radius 
(see 
figure 
3.9). 
This 
second 
idea 
somewhat 
resembles 
Galileo's 
attempt, 
in 
the 
Dialogo, 
to 
explain 

97

the 
orbital 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets 
by 
regarding 
them 
as having 
fallen 
from 
rest 
through 
distances 
related 
to 
the 
dimensions 
of 
their 
orbits. 
We know 
that 
Galileo 
derived 
the 
numerical 
data 
for 
this 
theory 
from 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(see 
Drake 
(1978), 
pp. 
155-6). 
The 
idea 
which 
was 
to 
lead 
Kepler 
to 
explain 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
by means 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
came 
to 
him 
quite 
suddenly 
on 
19 July 
1595 
(New 
Style, 
as 
are 
all 
dates 
after 
1582 
unless 
otherwise 
indicated). 
Characteristically, 
Kepler 
interpreted 
the 
slightness 
of 
the 
occasion 
for 
this 
discovery 
as 
indicating 
that 
God had 
answered 
his 
prayer 
for 
guidance.

"So 
on the 
9 or 
19 July 
of 
the 
year 
1595, 
I was about 
to 
show my students 
the 
way 
Great 
Conjunctions 
jump 
eight 
signs 
at 
a 
time 
and 
how they 
progress 
step 
by step 
from 
one Trigon 
into 
another; 
I 
had 
drawn 
many 
triangles, 
or 
quasi-triangles, 
in 
the 
same circle, 
in 
such 
a way 
that 
the 
end 
of 
one was 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
next. 
So the 
points 
where 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
triangles 
cut 
one 
another 
indicated 
a smaller 
circle. 
For 
the 
radius 
of 
a circle 
inscribed 
in 
a triangle 
[i. 
e. 
an equilateral 
triangle] 
is 
half 
the 
1 
radius 
of 
the 
circumscribed 
circle" 
(see 
figure 
3.10) 
Kepler's 
diagram 
contains 
so many 
"quasi-triangles" 
that 
the 
Trigons 
are 
not 
easy 
to 
pick 
out. 
I 
have. 
therefore 
included 
a diagram 
which 
indicates 
one 
trigon, 
the 
fiery 
trigon, 
reasonably 
clearly, 
together 
with 
the 
dates 
at 
which 
Great 
Conjunctions 
occurred 
in 
its 
three 
signs 
(figure 
3.11). 
The 
original 
form 
of 
this 
diagram 
accompanies 
a chapter 
of 
De Stella 
Nova 
(Prague, 
1606) 
that 
deals 
with 
the 
names 
of 
the 
four 
trigons 
and 
pronounces 
them 
to 
be derived 
from 
human 
choice 
rather 
than 
from 
Nature2.

Having 
noticed 
the 
smaller 
circle, 
Kepler 
thought 
that 
the 
proportion 
between 
the 
two 
circles 
looked 
similar 
to 
the 
proportion 
between 
the 
orbs 
of 
Saturn 
and 
Jupiter. 
He also 
noted 
that 
the 
triangle 
was 
the 
first 
of 
the 
regular 
polygons 
just 
as Saturn 
and 
Jupiter 
were 
the 
first 
of 
the 
planets. 
He describes 
the 
next 
stage: 
"I 
at 
once 
tried 
a square 
for 
the 
second 
distance, 
between 
Mars 
and 
Jupiter, 
a pentagon 
for 
the 
third, 
a 
hexagon 
for 
the 
fourth. 
" 
Since 
the 
second 
distance 
was 
large, 
he later 
tried 
adding 
a triangle 
and 
a pentagon 
to 
the 
square. 
However, 
the 
method 
did 
not 
appear 
to 
work, 
and 
he soon 
realised 
that 
there 
were 
two 
serious 
objections 
to 
it. 
Firstly, 
that 
if 
he were 
to 
use 
the 
figures 
in 
order 
he would 
never 
reach 
the 
Sun, 
and 
secondly 
that 
he would 
not 
be able 
to 
give 
a reason 

101 
! IWhy there 
should 
be six 
moving 
orbs 
rather 
than 
twenty 
or 
a hundred" 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
12,1.10 
et 
seqq). 
The 
first 
objection 
is 
slightly 
strange 
in 
that 
even 
a succession 
of 
triangles, 
each 
one 
halving 
the 
radius 
for 
the 
next 
sphere, 
will 
never 
reach 
to 
the 
centre. 
(The 
objection 
does, 
however, 
suggest 
that 
at 
this 
stage 
Kepler 
may 
have 
been. looking 
for 
a theory 
which 
would 
relate 
the 
size 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Mercury 
to 
the 
size 
of 
the 
Sun, 
something 
which 
his 
final 
theory 
does 
not 
do. ) 
Pres- 
umably 
Kepler 
was 
not 
thinking 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
reaching 
exactly 
to 
the 
centre 
but 
merely 
noticing 
that 
as 
the 
number 
of 
sides 
of 
the 
polygon 
increases 
so 
the 
circumcircle 
and 
the 
incircle 
become 
closer 
and 
closer 
in 
size 
-a 
fact 
which 
Archimedes 
had 
used 
to 
find 
the 
circumference 
of 
a circle 
and 
hence 
the 
value 
of 
ir. 
(Appendix 
4 shows 
something 
of. the 
geometrical 
basis 
of 
Kepler's 
theory. 
) 
Kepler 
was 
not 
entirely 
discouraged 
by 
his 
failure. 
His 
description 
of 
it 
concludes 
with 
the 
note 
"the 
figures 
pleased 
me, 
as 
being 
quantities, 
and 
things 
prior 
to 
the 
heavens. 
For 
quantity 
was 
created 
at 
first, 
with 
body, 
the 
heavens 
were 
created 
the 
next 
day. " 
This 
is 
quite 
clearly 
a reference 
to 
the 
first 
chapter 
of 
Genesis: 
"In 
the 
beginning 
God created 
the 
heaven 
and 
the 
earth. 
... 
And 
the 
evening 
and 
the 
morning 
were 
the 
first 
day. 
... 
And God called 
the 
firmament 
Heaven. 
And 
the 
evening 
and 
the-morning 
were 
the 
second 
day. " 
Kepler 
seems 
never 
to 
have 
found 
any 
conflict 
between 
his 

102 
religious 
convictions 
and 
his 
natural 
philosophy. 
His 
commonsense 
account 
of 
the 
status 
of 
the 
Bible 
in 
regard 
to 
matters 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
was 
eventually 
printed 
in 
the 
preface 
to 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova 
(Heidelberg, 
1609), 
but 
it 
had 
been 
written 
for 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
and 
suppressed 
in 
deference 
to 
the 
sensibilities 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Tübingen 
(see 
Rosen, 
1975). 
When Kepler 
does 
refer 
to 
the 
Creation 
it 
is 
usually 
in 
terms 
that 
are 
derived 
from 
Plato 
rather 
than 
from 
the 
Bible 
- 
as we have 
seen, 
Kepler 
regarded 
Timaeus 
as 
a commentary 
on Genesis 
(see 
Chapter 
I 
above). 
For 
example, 
in 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
(Linz, 
1619) 
he says 
"... 
our 
Faith 
holds 
that 
the 
World, 
which 
had 
no previous 
existence, 
was 
created 
by God in 
weight, 
measure 
and 
number, 
that 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
Ideas 
coeternal 
with 
Him" 
1. 
According 
to 
Kepler's 
account, 
it 
was 
his 
attempt 
to 
select 
five 
particular 
polygons 
to 
describe 
the 
six 
Copernican 
orbs 
that 
led 
him 
to 
think 
about 
polyhedra 
instead 
of 
polygons. 
Why should 
there 
be plane 
figures 
between 
the 
three-dimensional 
orbs? 
Five 
particular 
solid 
figures 
were 
easily 
distinguishable 
from 
all 
others, 
namely 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids, 
described 
in 
Book 
XIII 
of 
the 
Elements: 
"See,

matter 
of 
all 
this 
little 
work"1. 
Kepler 
further 
points 
out 
that 
the 
scholium 
to 
Proposition 
18 of 
Book 
XIII 
of 
the 
Elements 
proves 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
con- 
struct 
any 
more 
than 
five 
regular 
bodies. 
His 
theory 
was 
thus 
established 
on a secure, 
Euclidean, 
mathe- 
matical 
base. 
It 
was, 
however, 
a base 
which 
Kepler 
himself 
was 
to 
undermine, 
by 
discovering 
two 
new 
regular 
polyhedra 
(which 
he recognised 
as 
such). 
It 
appears 
that 
he had 
discovered 
at 
least 
one 
of 
these 
new 
polyhedra 
by 
1599 
2, 
but 
his 
first 
full 
description 
of 
them 
appeared 
only 
in 
1619, in 
Book 
II 
of 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi, 
and 
my description 
of 
them 
will 
accordingly 
be 
postponed 
until 
I 
come 
to 
deal 
with 
that 
work, 
in 
Chapter 
V below. 
The 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
reprints 
the 
passage 
in 
which 
Kepler 
describes 
the 
origin 
of 
his 
theory 
without, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
can 
see, 
the 
addition 
of 
any 
note 
that 
might 
be takep 
as modifying 
this 
account. 
Moreover, 
as we have 
seen, 
Kepler's 
note 
on 
the 
title 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
makes 
an explicit 
claim 
that 
the 
theory 
was 
original, 
describing 
it 
as 
inventum, 
as 
it 
is 
described 
also 
in 
the 
passage 
from 
the 
preface 
which 
I 
quoted 
in 
the 
last 
paragraph 
"See, 
Reader, 
this 
discovery 
(inventum) 
and 
the 
matter 
of

theory 
in 
several 
letters 
to 
officials 
at 
Tübingen 
and 
in 
his 
introduction 
to 
his 
edition 
of 
the 
Narratio 
Prima 
of 
Rheticus, 
which 
was 
published 
together 
with 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
in 
1596 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
84,1.47). 
As we have 
seen, 
Kepler 
describes 
his 
theory 
as origi- 
nating 
from 
his 
perception 
of 
a possible 
cosmological 
significance 
in 
a. well 
known 
mathematical 
fact 
that 
had 
been 
presented 
to 
him 
in 
an astronomical 
or 
astro- 
logical 
context. 
He makes 
rather 
little 
of 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
unsuccessful 
use 
of 
polygons 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
using 
polyhedra, 
and 
the 
transition 
does, 
indeed, 
seem 
a very 
natural 
one, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
close 
mathematical 
analogy 
between 
the 
circumcircle 
and 
incircle 
of 
a 
polygon 
and 
the 
circumsphere 
and 
insphere 
of 
a polyhedron. 
Moreover, 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
was usual 
to 
imagine 
plane- 
tary 
orbs 
as spheres 
must 
have 
played 
a part 
in 
reminding 
Kepler 
that, 
although 
he was 
inclined 
to 
think 
of 
the 
orbits 
as merely 
closed 
curves, 
the 
problem 
was 
in 
fact 
a three-dimensional 
one. 
(It 
is 
not 
clear 
whether 
at 
this 
stage 
Kepler 
had 
guessed, 
or 
was willing 
to 
assume, 
that 
the 
orbits 
were 
actually 
plane 
curves. 
) 
Once 
he had 
thought 
of 
using 
polyhedra, 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids 
were 
an entirely 
obvious 
choice. 
Not 
only 
were 
there 
exactly 
five 
of 
them, 
but 
also 
Kepler, 
like 
many 
of 
his 
contemporaries, 
followed 
Proclus 
in 
believing 
that 
the 
Elements 
had 
been 
written 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
establishing 
the 
existence 
and 
properties 
of 
these 
five 
polyhedra, 
which 
were 
in 
some 
sense 
"World 
Figures", 

105 
either 
describing 
or 
determining 
some 
fundamental 
property 
of 
the 
corporeal 
world 
(see, 
for 
example, 
Harmonices 
Mundi, 
Book 
II, 
-sect. 
XXV, 
KGW 6, 
pp. 
80-82). 
The 
simple 
idea 
from 
which'Kepler 
claims 
to 
have 
started 
is 
so simple 
that 
it 
would 
hardly 
need 
to 
be 
ascribed 
to 
a source. 
We surely 
must 
accept 
Kepler's 
account, 
unless 
we are 
to 
reject 
the 
whole 
of 
it 
and 
ask 
instead 
where 
Kepler 
could 
have 
come 
upon 
the 
more 
complex 
idea 
of 
turning 
to 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
for 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Copernican 
planetary 
system. 
The 
general 
idea 
seems 
to 
be derived 
from 
Proclus, 
with 
references 
back 
to 
Plato 
and 
the 
Pythag- 
oreans. 
Indeed, 
in 
the 
passage 
from 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
to 
which 
I 
referred 
in 
the 
last 
paragraph' 
Kepler 
seems 
to 
wish 
to 
ascribe 
even 
the 
details 
of 
his 
theory 
to 
the 
Pythagoreans 
(whom 
he took 
for 
Copernicans, 
of 
course) 
but 
he does 
not 
give 
any 
reference 
to 
written 
evidence 
for 
their 
having 
constructed 
such 
a theory. 
Kepler 
often 
does 
give 
references, 
and 
his 
silence 
in 
this 
case 
must, 
I 
think, 
be construed 
as 
significant 
- 
as 
signifying 
that, 
as 
he said 
in 
his 
note 
of 
1621, 
he 
knew 
of 
no earlier 
account 
of 
the 
theory 
to 
which 
he 
could 
refer. 
Whether 
Kepler 
had 
somewhere 
read 
something 
which 
somehow 
suggested 
the 
theory 
to 
him 
without 
his 
being 
aware 
of 
the 
source 
is 
a speculation 
I 
am content

to 
leave 
to 
others. 
It 
seems 
to 
me that 
it 
would 
be 
rather 
perverse 
to 
doubt 
Kepler's 
apparently 
straight- 
forward 
account 
of 
how he came 
to 
his 
theory. 
Kepler's 
arguments 
in 
favour 
of 
his 
theory 
As we have 
seen, 
Kepler 
presents 
his 
theory 
as 
a 
confirmation 
of 
the 
Copernican 
description 
of 
the 
Universe. 
This 
naturally 
affects 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
work 
begins 
with 
a description 
of 
the 
Copernican 
system, 
but 
by 
far 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
book 
is 
in 
fact 
taken 
up 
with 
Kepler's 
justification 
of 
his 
own theory. 
He gives 
three 
types 
of 
argument 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
theory: 
arguments 
from 
the 
mathematical 
properties 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids, 
arguments 
from 
the 
connection*of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
with 
astrological 
phenomena, 
and 
arguments 
from 
the 
agreement 
between 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
orbs 
calculated 
from 
the 
theory 
and 
the 
spacing 
deduced 
from 
the 
parameters 
of 
the 
orbits 
given 
in 
De 
Revolutionibus 
and 
in 
the 
Prutenic 
Tables 
(Tübingen, 
1551). 
These 
arguments 
are 
presented 
in 
the 
order 
in 
which 
I have 
just 
listed 
them. 
This 
explains 
why Kepler 
at 
first 
gives 
only 
a sketchy 
account 
of 
his 
theory, 
in 
Chapter 
II, 
postponing 
the 
more 
detailed 
description 
until 
Chapter 
XIV, 
which 
marks 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
discussion 
of 
the 
agreement 
with 
observations. 
Chapters 
III 
to 
VIII 
(KGW 1, 
pp. 
29-34) 
are 
taken 
up with 

107 
mathematical 
arguments; 
Chapters 
IX 
to 
XII 
(KGW 1, 
PP. 
34-43) 
with 
astrological 
ones; 
Chapter 
XIII 
describes 
how to 
find 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
circumspheres 
and inspheres 
of 
the 
five 
polyhedra; 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
book, 
Chapters 
XIV 
to 
XXIII 
(KGW 1, 
pp. 
47-80), 
deals 
with 
astronomical 
matters, 
and 
ranges 
rather 
wider 
than 
mere 
comparison 
between 
the 
values 
calculated 
from 
the 
theory 
and 
the 
values 
deduced 
from 
observations. 
Much 
of 
this 
astronomical 
section 
is, 
in 
fact, 
concerned 
with 
problems 
to 
which 
Kepler 
was 
to 
return, 
armed 
with 
Tycho's 
observations 
and 
an apparently 
limitless 
supply 
of 
willpower. 
This 
part 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum 
is 
analysed 
fairly 
briefly 
but 
very 
lucidly 
by Dreyer 
(1953). 
Kepler's 
own comments, 
in 
the 
1621 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
may be ex- 
emplified 
by his 
note 
on Chapter 
XV (a 
chapter 
which 
Dreyer 
characterised 
as 
"masterly"): 
"The 
problem 
caused 
by 
this 
as 
it 
were 
dislocation 
of 
the 
Planetary 
system 
[i. 
e. 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
eccentrics 
were 
scattered 
round 
the 
Sun, 
and 
moveable] 
and 
how 
it 
can 
be solved 
by 
Brahe's 
observations 
of 
Mars 
are 
matters

have 
described 
in 
detail 
in 
my Commentaries 
on the 
motion 
of

planet...

p. 
90).

I

always

something

Possibly 
he felt 
that 
the 
first 
two 
words 
seemed 
to 
claim 
too 
much

they 
were 
taken

) 
The 
order 
of 
Kepler's 
arguments 
The 
order 
in 
which 
Kepler 
presents 
his 
arguments, 
starting 
with 
mathematical 
ones 
and 
only 
later 
coming 
to 
the 
agreement 
with 
observations, 
reveals 
his 
concern 
to 
give 
"physical 
or, if 
you 
prefer, 
metaphysical 
reasons" 
in 
favour 
of 
his 
theory, 
and 
hence 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
Copernican 
system. 
I 
do not 
think 
that 
the 
order 
of 
the 
arguments 
should 
be seen 
as 
strange, 
even 
by 
modern 
standards. 
Modern 
scientists 
are, 
of 
course, 
trained 
to 
ask 
at 
once 
how well 
the 
theory 
accounts 
for 
the 
observations, 
but 
that 
is 
because 
the 
logically 
prior 
question 
of 
whether 
the 
theory 
is 
a form 
ac- 
ceptable 
for 
a scientific 
theory 
is 
usually 
taken 
as 
already 
answered 
in 
the 
affirmative. 
In 
the 
sixteenth 
century 
it 
was 
natural 
to 
answer 
this 
first 
question 
first. 
As I 
hope 
to 
show, 
the 
weakness 
of 
Kepler's 
theory 
in 
fact 
lies 
in 
its 
philosophical 
basis 
and 
not, 
as might 
perhaps 
have 
been 
expected, 
in 
its 
power 
to 
account 
for 
the 
observations. 
Kepler 
continued 
to 
believe 
in 
his 
theory 
because 
he was 
confident 
that 
an 
incorrect 
theory 
must 
eventually 
be shown 
to 
be incor- 
rect 
on observational 
grounds. 
This 
belief 
is 
one 
of 
his 
"modern" 
traits

Crushing 
observational 
evidence 
against 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
appeared 
only 
with 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
planet 
Uranus 
in 
1781, 
although 
Kepler 
had 
briefly 
supposed 
that 
Galileo 
had 
provided 
such 
evidence, 
when 
early 
reports 
of 
the 
Sidereus 
Nuncius 
made 
it 
seem 
possible 
that 
Galileo 
had 
discovered 
new planets 
rather 
than, 
as Kepler 
was 
to 
call 
them, 
"satellites" 
of 
Jupiter'(see 
Chapter 
IV 
below). 
The 
little 
phrase 
"physical 
or, 
if 
you 
prefer, 
metaphysical 
reasons" 
seems 
to 
me to 
require 
comment. 
Kepler 
habitually 
refers 
to 
his 
appeals 
to 
Archetypes, 
Ideas 
coeternal 
with 
the 
Creator, 
as 
being 
"physical" 
reasoning. 
He appears 
to 
be using 
the 
word 
in 
something 
close 
to 
its 
etymological 
meaning 
- ýuv-ticoj 
derived 
from 
ýVres 
- 
that 
is, 
to 
mean 
"pertaining'to 
nature", 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
a "physical" 
reason 
is 
describing 
the 
way 
that 
things 
work 
in 
the 
natural 
world 
(the 
natural 
world 
being 
taken 
to 
include 
celestial 
as 
well 
as 
terrestrial 
phenomena). 
Maestlin 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
have 
suggested 
that 
his 
pupil 
should 
explain 
the 
point 
more 
explicitly, 
and 
there 
is 
no note 
on the 
word 
in 
the 
1621 
edition. 
The 
usage 
does, 
however, 
appear 
to 
be personal 
to 
Kepler 
(see 
Jardine, 
1979). 
Mathematics 
Before 
presenting 
mathematical 
arguments 
for 
his 
theory, 
Kepler 
first 
explains 
why 
he 
felt 
a mathematical 

110 
discussion 
was 
necessary. 
The explanation 
is 
summarised 
in 
the 
first 
sentence 
of 
Chapter 
III: 
"I 
think 
it 
might 
appear 
fortuitous, 
and 
not 
the 
consequence 
of 
any 
cause, 
that 
the 
distances 
between 
the 
six 
Copernican 
orbs 
are 
such 
that 
these 
five 
bodies 
will 
fit 
into 
them, 
were 
it 
not 
that 
there 
is 
an order 
among 
the 
bodies 
themselves, 
and 
it 
is 
in 
this 
order 
that 
I 
have 
placed 
them 
between 
the 
orbs" 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
29). 
After 
a short 
elaboration 
of 
this 
summary, 
he then 
proceeds 
to 
deduce 
the 
order 
among 
the 
Platonic 
solids. 
The first 
thing 
he establishes, 
in 
Chapter 
III, 
is 
that 
the 
solids 
are 
to 
be divided 
into 
two 
kinds, 
primary 
and 
secondary. 
He lists 
seven 
features 
which 
distinguish 
the 
primary 
from 
the 
secondary 
solids. 
1. 
Each 
of 
the 
primary 
solids 
has 
a different 
type 
of 
face, 
whereas 
the 
secondary 
solids 
all 
have 
the 
same 
kind, 
a triangle. 
2. 
Each 
primary 
solid 
has 
a type 
of 
face 
peculiar 
to 
itself, 
the 
secondary 
solids 
have 
the 
triangular 
face 
of 
the 
tetrahedron. 
3. 
The 
primary 
solids 
have 
simple 
solid 
angles 
at 
which 
three 
faces 
meet, 
in 
the 
secondary 
solids 
more 
than 
three 
faces 
meet 
at 
each 
vertex. 
(Euclid 
defines 
a 
solid 
angle 
as 
being 
made up of 
at 
least 
three 
plane 
angles, 
in 
Book 
XI 
of 
the 
Elements. 
) 
4. 
The 
primary 
solids 
do not 
owe their 
origin 
and 
properties 
to 
anything 
else, 
the 
secondary 
solids 
can 
be seen 
as 
derived 
from 
the 
primary 
ones. 
(The 
method 
ik

of 
derivation 
is 
shown 
in 
the 
diagrams 
which 
accompany 
Kepler's 
discussion 
of 
the 
same 
relationship 
in 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Epitome 
(Linz, 
1620, 
KGW 7, 
p. 
271). 
It 
nT nsists 
of 
making 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
"primary" 
solids 
vertices 
of 
the 
"secondary" 
ones 
(see 
figure 
3.12). 
It 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
discussion 
in 
the 
Epitome 
that 
Kepler 
realised 
that 
the 
"primary" 
solids 
could 
be 
inscribed 
in 
the 
"secondary" 
ones 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
the 
latter 
are 
shown 
to 
be 
inscribed 
in 
the 
former 
in 
his 
diagram. 
That 
is, 
to 
put 
it 
in 
modern 
terms, 
hr. 
recognised 
that 
the 
relationship 
of 
duality 
was 
recip- 
rocal. 
However, 
even 
in 
the 
Epitome 
he 
still 
uses

112 
relations 
shown 
in 
the 
diagrams 
as 
a way 
of 
distinguishing 
between 
"primary" 
and 
"secondary" 
solids. 
This 
departure 
from 
mathematical 
rigour 
is 
of 
a piece 
with 
his 
unwillingness 
to 
accord 
his 
new regular 
polyhedra 
the 
same status 
as 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
- 
fnr 
which 
see 
Chapter 
V below 
and 
Appendix 
6). 
5. 
The primary 
solids 
do not 
move 
harmoniously 
(con- 
cinne) 
unless 
a diameter 
is 
drawn 
through 
the 
centre 
of 
one 
face 
or 
the 
centres 
of 
a pair 
of 
opposite 
faces, 
the 
secondary 
solids 
move 
harmoniously 
about 
a diameter 
drawn 
through 
two 
vertices. 
(I 
think 
this 
probably 
refers 
to 
what 
would 
now be called 
rotational 
symmetry. 
The 
"primary" 
solids 
have 
only 
3-fold 
rotational 
symmetry 
about 
an axis 
of 
symmetry 
through 
a vertex, 
whereas 
about 
an axis 
through 
the 
centre 
of 
a face 
they 
have 
n-fold 
rotational 
symmetry, 
where 
n is 
the 
number 
of 
sides 
of 
the 
face 
of 
the 
solid 
concerned. 
The 
"secondary" 
solids 
have 
3-fold 
rotational 
symmetry 
about 
an axis 
through 
the 
centre 
of 
a face, 
and 
n-fold 
rotational 
symmetry 
about 
an axis 
through 
a vertex, 
where 
n is 
the 
number 
of 
faces 
that 
meet 
at 
each 
vertex. 
If 
I 
have 
understood 
Kepler 
correctly, 
the 
"harmony" 
of 
the 
motion 
would 
consist 
in 
its 
degree 
of 
symmetry 
corresponding 
to 
the 
number 
of 
sides 
of 
each 
face 
- 
the 
distinguishing 
feature 
of 
each 
"primary" 
solid 
- 
and 
to 
the 
number 
of 
faces 
which 
meet 
at 
each 
vertex 
- 
the 
distinguishing 
feature 
of 
each 
"secondary" 
solid. 
This 
is 
an analogue 
for 
polyhedra 
of 
the 
idea 
that 
a 

113 
sphere 
expresses 
its 
own shape 
by 
rotation 
- 
see 
Copernicus 
De Revolutionibus, 
Book 
I, 
Ch. 
IV, 
NKG, 
vol. 
II, 
p. 
12,1.28). 
6. 
It 
is 
appropriate 
for 
the 
primary 
solids 
to 
stand 
on one 
face 
and 
for 
the 
secondary 
ones 
to 
be suspended 
by 
a vertex, 
that 
is, 
the 
shapes 
of 
the 
solids 
are 
best 
appreciated 
if 
they 
are 
seen 
in 
these 
positions. 
(This 
seems 
to 
me to 
be no more 
than 
a restatement 
of 
property 
5 in 
terms 
of 
bodies 
at 
rest. 
) 
7. 
There 
are 
three 
primary 
solids 
and 
two 
secondary 
ones, 
three 
being 
a perfect 
number, 
two 
an 
imperfect 
one. 
Also, 
the 
primary 
solids 
between 
them 
show 
all 
three 
kinds 
of 
angle 
- 
the 
right 
angle 
in 
the 
cube, 
the 
acute 
angle 
in 
the 
tetrahedron 
and 
the 
obtuse 
angle 
in 
the 
dodecahedron 
- whereas 
the 
secondary 
solids 
share 
the 
obtuse 
angle, 
though 
the 
angles 
in 
the 
octahedron 
are 
of 
all 
three 
types 
- 
the 
dihedral 
angle 
being 
obtuse, 
the 
angle 
between 
the 
two 
opposed 
edges 
meeting 
at 
a vertex 
being 
a right 
angle, 
and 
the 
solid 
angle 
at 
the 
vertex 
being 
acute. 
(Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Ch. 
III, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
29) 
I 
have 
felt 
obliged 
to 
employ 
modern 
mathematical 
terms 
in 
my paraphrase 
since 
it 
seems 
to 
me that 
Kepler 
had 
precise 
mathematical 
properties 
in 
mind, 
though 
his 
expression 
of 
them 
took 
a somewhat 
"hand-waving" 
form. 
However, 
the 
imprecise 
form 
of 
Kepler's 
ex- 
position 
serves 
to 
emphasise 
his 
indebtedness 
to 
Timaeus 
rather 
than 
the 
Elements 
for 
this 
kind 
of 
mathematics, 

114 
whose 
concern 
with 
symmetry 
is 
as much 
aesthetic 
as 
purely 
mathematical, 
as 
too 
is 
its 
emphasis 
on dif- 
ferent 
degrees 
of 
perfection. 
This 
admixture 
of 
aesthetic 
principles 
is, 
in 
fact, 
characteristic 
of 
much 
of 
Kepler's 
mathematical 
reasoning, 
reflecting 
his 
belief 
that 
God made 
the 
Universe 
as beautiful 
as possible 
(see,. 
for 
example, 
Myst. 
Cosm., 
Ch. 
IV, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
30,1.9). 
In 
the 
present 
case, 
Kepler 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
precisely 
because 
they 
are 
the 
simplest, 
and 
thus 
the 
most 
beautiful, 
of 
the 
polyhedra, 
those 
whose 
properties 
most 
closely 
approach 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
sphere. 
He makes 
this 
point 
explicitly 
in 
a long 
note 
on Chapter 
II 
in 
the 
1596 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
a note 
which 
was 
not 
modified 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
48). 
The 
dominance 
of 
aesthetic 
considerations 
is 
therefore 
exactly 
what 
we should 
expect 
at 
this 
point 
in 
Kepler's 
reasoning. 
The chapter 
ends 
with 
the 
conclusion 
that 
"nothing 
could 
be more 
suitable" 
than 
that 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth 
should 
serve 
to 
divide 
the 
two 
regions 
whose 
structures 
are 
determined 
by 
the 
"primary" 
and 
the 
"secondary" 
solids, 
and 
Kepler 
then 
goes 
oft to 
consider 
why 
there 
should 
be three 
solids 
outside 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
two 
inside 
it. 
The 
short 
chapter 
in 
which 
this 
question 
is 
answered 
defies 
adequate 
summary. 
Much 
of 
it 
is 
concerned 
with 
God and 
His 
intentions 
in 
creating 
the 
Universe 
"For 
I 
think 
that 
very 
many 
causes 
of 
what 

115 
we find 
in 
the 
world 
can 
be deduced 
from 
the 
love 
God 
bears 
to 
Man" 
(Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Ch. 
IV, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
30.1.8). 
One expression 
of 
this 
love 
is 
to 
place 
the 
Earth 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
planets 
- 
the 
Sun 
for 
this 
purpose 
being 
counted 
as 
a planet, 
while 
the 
Moon 
is 
not. 
(It 
should 
perhaps 
be remembered 
at 
this 
point 
that 
because 
of 
the 
very 
low 
value 
for 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
Earth 
and 
the 
Sun 
that 
was 
accepted 
as 
correct 
at 
this 
time 
the 
Earth 
was 
believed 
to 
be relatively 
larger 
than 
we now know 
it 
to 
be. ) 
We thus 
require 
three 
solids 
to 
surround 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
two 
to 
lie 
inside 
it. 
This 
accords 
with 
Kepler's 
belief 
that 
"to 
contain 
is 
more 
perfect, 
as 
being 
active, 
and 
to 
be contained, 
as 
being 
passive, 
is 
more 
imperfect; 
and 
the 
primary 
solids 
are 
indeed 
more 
perfect 
than 
the 
others... 
" 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
30,1.31). 
He has 
thus 
explained 
why 
there 
are 
three 
planets 
moving 
outside 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
two 
inside 
it. 
Kepler 
goes 
on to 
consider 
the 
order 
in 
which 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
should 
be placed 
between 
the 
planetary 
orbs. 
Since 
"to 
contain 
is 
more 
perfect" 
this 
means 
that 
we must 
deduce 
the 
order 
of 
perfection 
of 
the 
solids 
and 
then 
use 
them 
in 
this 
order, 
working 
inwards 
from 
the 
orb 
of 
Saturn. 
Kepler 
regards 
perfection 
as 
a matter 
of 
mathematical 
simplicity 
and 
his 
treatment 
of 
the 
cube, 
the 
most 
perfect 
solid, 
will 
serve 
to 
exemplify 
the 
character 
of 
his 
arguments. 
We are 
presented 
with 
nine 
distinguishing 
features. 

t 
116 
1. 
The 
cube 
is 
the 
only 
body 
to 
be 
generated 
by 
its 
t'ace, 
for 
the 
other 
four 
are 
not 
so 
generated 
but 
are 
either 
cut 
out 
from 
the 
cube- 
as 
is 
the 
tetrahedron, 
by 
cutting 
off 
four 
triangular 
pyramids 
- 
or 
are 
formed 
by 
adding 
to 
the 
cube 
- 
as 
is 
the 
dodecahedron, 
by 
adding 
six 
five-faced 
solids. 
(These 
last 
two 
op- 
are 
shown 
in 
the 
diagrams 
which 
accompany 
Kepler': 
discussion 
of 
these 
relationships 
in 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Epitome 
(Linz, 
1620, 
KGW 7, 
p. 
269, 
see 
figures 
3.13 
and 
3.14). 
It 
is 
to 
be 
presumed 
that 
Kepler 
conceives 
of 
the 
cube 
being 
generated 
by its 
face 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
a moving 
square 
can 
sweep 
out 
a cube.

2. 
The 
cube 
is 
the 
only 
body 
that 
can 
be 
cut 
up 
into 
equal 
bodies 
of 
the 
same 
shape 
without 
leaving 
any 
prisms. 
(It 
is 
not 
clear 
whether 
in 
1596 
Kepler 
had 
considered 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
cube 
and 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron, 
which 
shares 
the 
cube's 
related 
property 
of 
filling 
space 
and 
is 
described 
and 
ill- 
ustrated 
in 
the 
Epitome, 
Book 
IV 
(KGW 
7, 
p. 
270, 
see 
figure 
3.15). 
The 
rhombic 
solid 
is 
much 
less 
perfect 
than 
the 
cube 
since 
its 
faces 
are 
not 
even 
regular. 
) 
A 
3.15 
Cube 
to 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
(KGW 
7, 
p. 
270) 
3. 
The 
cube 
is 
the 
only 
solid 
that 
show; 
all 
three 
dimensions 
whichever 
way 
it 
is 
turned. 
(That 
is, 
all 
its 
parts 
are 
either 
mutually 
perpendicular 
or 
parallel. 
) 
4. 
Hence 
it 
is 
only 
solid 
which 
has 
the 
same 
number 
of 
faces 
as 
the 
third 
dimension 
(sic) 
has 
limits, 
that 
is 
six, 
and 
twice 
that 
number 
of 
sides, 
namely 
twelve. 
5. 
It 
has 
the 
same 
angle 
everywhere, 
that 
is, 
a right 
angle. 
(This 
seems 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
dihedral 
angles 
and 
the 
plane 
angles 
of 
the 
face 
are 
all 
right 
angles. 
) 
6. 
Thus 
it 
is 
the 
only 
body 
which 
exemplifies 
the 
criterion 
of 
perfection 
in 
the 
number 
three 
which 

118 
Simplicius 
in 
his-commentary 
on Aristotle's 
On the 
Heavens 
Book 
I, 
Chapter 
I, 
quotes 
from 
Ptolemy, 
namely 
that 
no more 
than 
three 
straight 
lines 
can 
be mutually 
perpendicular 
at 
any 
point. 
7. 
It 
is 
the 
simplest 
of 
all 
polyhedra, 
and 
is 
used 
as 
the 
measure 
of 
volume. 
(Kepler 
adds 
that 
it 
is 
a 
natural 
fact 
rather 
than 
a matter 
of 
human 
convention 
that 
any 
solid 
body 
can 
be imagined 
as made up of 
small 
cubes. 
) 
8. 
Inscribing 
a right 
angle 
in 
a circle 
is 
a necessary 
step 
to 
obtain 
many 
other 
results, 
such 
as 
inscribing 
a triangle 
or 
a pentagon 
in 
a circle. 
(The 
right 
angle, 
as we have 
seen, 
is 
characteristic 
of 
the 
cube 
and 
its 
significance 
therefore 
presumably 
reflects 
back 
onto 
the 
cube. 
) 
9. 
Man himself, 
the 
most 
perfect 
of 
the 
animals, 
has 
something 
of 
the 
form 
of 
a cube, 
in 
that 
he has, 
as 
it 
were, 
six 
surfaces: 
upper, 
lower, 
back, 
front, 
right 
and 
left. 
(This 
reminds 
me of 
the 
squared-off 
human 
figures 
one 
finds 
in 
books 
that 
explain 
how to 
draw 
complicated 
objects 
in 
perspective, 
for 
example 
in 
Dürer's 
Unterweysung 
der 
Messung 
mit 
dem Zirkel 
und 
Richtscheyt, 
Nuremberg, 
1525. ) 
(Myst. 
Cosm., 
Ch. 
V, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
31). 
These 
nine 
features 
which 
serve 
to 
establish 
that 
the 
cube 
is 
the 
simplest 
and 
most 
basic 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
are, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
rather 
more 
narrowly 
mathematical 
t 
than 
the 
criteria 
used 
to 
divide 
the 
solids 
into 

119 
"primary" 
and 
"secondary" 
bodies. 
However, 
they 
show 
the 
same 
tendency 
to 
specialise 
rather 
than 
generalise: 
numbers 
3,4 
and 
6, 
and 
perhaps 
9 as well, 
could 
quite 
easily 
have 
been 
gathered 
together 
as 
one 
item, 
as 
could 
numbers 
5 and ,6 in 
the 
earlier 
sequence. 
In 
both 
sequences, 
Kepler's 
attitude 
is 
that 
of 
the 
applied 
rather 
than 
the 
pure 
mathematician. 
He is 
looking 
for 
specific 
instances 
of 
mathematical 
properties 
that 
seem 
to 
him 
to 
have 
a significance 
beyond 
the 
mathe- 
matical 
entities 
involved. 
He is 
not 
interested 
in 
mathematical 
truths 
as 
such. 
The 
treatment 
of 
the 
tetrahedron, 
the 
next 
most 
perfect 
solid, 
is 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
the 
cube, 
but 
the 
case 
of 
the 
dodecahedron 
is 
left 
as 
an exercise 
to 
the 
reader: 
"what 
should 
be thought 
of 
its 
properties 
will 
easily 
become 
apparent 
if 
you 
compare 
them 
with 
those 
mentioned 
for 
the 
other 
solids 
"(Myst. 
Cosm., 
Ch. 
VI, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
33,1.14). 
It 
seems 
as 
though 
for 
Kepler, 
as 
for 
Plato, 
the 
dodecahedron 
merely 
had 
to 
take 
what 
was 
left 
for 
it 
(see 
Chapter 
I 
above). 
The 
treatment 
of 
the 
two 
"secondary" 
solids 
is 
rather 
shorter 
than 
that 
of 
the 
first 
two 
"primary" 
ones 
and 
is 
to 
some 
extent 
derived 
from 
consideration 
of 
the 
positions 
assigned 
to 
the 
corresponding 
"primary" 
solids. 
This 
is, 
of 
course, 
quite 
reasonable, 
since 
the 
"secondary" 
solids 
are 
regarded 
as 
derived 
from 
the 
"primary" 
ones. 
Kepler's 
mathematical 
justification 
of 
his 
theory 

120 
thus 
strongly 
resembles 
Timaeus' 
justification 
of 
the 
theory 
that 
related 
the 
polyhedra 
to 
the 
elements. 
Though 
it 
is 
much 
longer 
than 
its 
prototype 
it 
consists 
only 
of 
an array 
of 
mathematical 
facts. 
The 
array 
includes 
some very 
simple 
facts 
(such 
as that 
the 
"secondary" 
solids 
all 
have 
triangular 
faces), 
some 
that 
are 
theorems 
(the 
construction 
of 
a tetrahedron 
by removing 
pyramids 
from 
a cube 
is 
based 
on Proposition 
15 of 
Book 
XIII 
of 
the 
Elements), 
and 
a few 
that 
have 
considerable 
significance 
(such 
as 
the 
possibility 
of 
dividing 
any 
solid 
into 
small 
cubes). 
Most 
of 
the 
mathematics 
involved 
is 
treated 
very 
sketchily 
and 
no 
proofs 
or 
even 
diagrams 
are 
supplied. 
This 
probably 
indicates 
that 
Kepler 
expected 
that 
many 
of 
the 
facts 
he mentioned 
were 
already 
well 
known 
to 
his 
readers. 
Only 
two 
notes 
are 
added 
to 
the 
mathematical 
chapters 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
in 
the 
1621 
edition. 
The first 
refers 
the 
reader 
to 
a fuller 
treatment 
of 
the 
same material 
in 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Epitome 
(Linz, 
1620), 
and 
"a 
little 
more" 
in 
the 
first 
chapter 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V (Linz, 
1619) 
and 
(where 
it 
turns 
out 
to 
be very 
little) 
in 
Chapter 
XIII 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum 
itself. 
The 
second 
note 
merely 
concerns 
the 
angle 
in 
a semicircle. 
In 
fact, 
the 
two 
later 
works 
appear 
to 
add 
almost 
nothing 
to 
what 
is 
said 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
except 
that 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Epitome 
contains 
some 
diagrams 
(because 
the 
work 
was 
intended 
to 
be introductory 
or 
because 
Kepler 
was 
now 

121 
in 
a better 
position 
to 
influence 
his 
printers? 
) and 
the 
passage 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V describes, 
and 
illustrates, 
one 
of 
the 
two 
regular 
star 
polyhedra 
which 
Kepler 
discovered. 
I 
think 
we must 
therefore 
assume 
that 
what 
he had 
published 
in 
1596 
still 
seemed 
valid 
to 
him 
in 
1621. ' 
This 
means 
that 
he must 
not 
only 
have 
accepted 
it 
as mathematically 
valid, 
but 
must 
also 
have 
believed 
himself 
justified 
in 
the 
cosmological 
conclusions 
he had 
drawn 
from 
his 
mathematics. 
Astrology 
and 
Numerology 
Chapters 
III 
to 
VIII 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
were 
concerned 
with 
establishing 
that 
Kepler's 
theory 
was 
mathematically 
coherent 
- 
and 
did 
not, 
for 
example, 
involve 
taking 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
in 
some 
arbitrary 
order. 
The 
astrological 
and 
numerological 
chapters 
are 
concerned 
with 
what 
are, 
to 
Kepler, 
more 
or 
less 
observational 
tests 
of 
the 
theory. 
He regards 
the 
astrological 
facts 
as, well 
established, 
and 
in 
Chapters 
IX, 
XI 
and 
XII 
he sets 
out 
to 
show 
how his 
theory 
can 
account 
for 
them. 
In 
Chapter 
X he takes 
it 
as well 
established 
that 
certain 
numbers 
are 
of 
cosmological 
significance 
and 
shows 
how they 
may be 
seen 
as 
character- 
istic 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
- 
arising, 
for 
example, 
as 
the 
numbers 
of 
sides 
or 
faces 
or 
angles 
of 
the 
bodies. 
In 
a note 
on this 
chapter 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
he states 
explicitly 
that 
he 

122 
regards 
Geometry 
as prior 
to 
Arithmetic 
and 
refers 
the 
reader 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I 
for 
a fuller 
account 
of 
their 
relationship. 
The 
earlier 
treatment 
is 
very 
crude 
indeed 
compared 
with 
the 
later 
one 
and 
seems 
to 
me to 
be of 
interest 
mainly 
in 
relation 
to 
it. 
I 
shall 
therefore 
postpone 
consideration 
of 
this 
chapter 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
until 
I 
come 
to 
discuss 
the 
relevant 
part 
of 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
(see 
Chapter 
V below). 
Kepler's 
astrological 
beliefs 
changed 
fairly 
con- 
siderably 
between 
1596 
and 
1621, 
and 
this 
change 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
notes 
on the 
astrological 
chapters 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
As I have 
already 
noted, 
Chapter 
XI, 
which 
deals 
with 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
Zodiac, 
is 
dismissed 
in 
the 
first 
note 
as being 
of 
no interest, 
presumably 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
being 
of 
no interest 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
matter 
in 
hand 
(that 
is, 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
to 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Universe) 
since 
Kepler 
did 
see 
fit 
to 
add 
another 
twelve 
notes 
after 
this 
first 
one. 
Chapter 
XII, 
which 
deals 
with 
astrological 
Aspects, 
is 
given 
thirty-nine 
notes, 
and 
the 
total 
length 
of 
the 
notes 
is 
rather 
greater 
than 
the 
original 
length 
of 
the 
chapter. 
The material 
of 
this 
chapter 
is 
connected 
with 
Music, 
that 
is, 
musical 
ratios, 
and 
with 
the 
division 
of 
a circle 
into 
equal 
parts 
by inscribing 
a 
regular 
polygon 
in 
it. 
These 
problems 
are 
the 
subjects 
of 
two 
of 
the 
five 
books 
of 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
and 

123 
my discussion 
of 
Kepler's 
earlier 
treatment 
of 
them 
will 
thus 
be postponed 
until 
I 
come 
to 
discuss 
the 
later 
one 
(see 
Chapter 
V below). 
The 
first 
of 
the 
astrological 
chapters 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Chapter 
IX, 
explains 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
planets 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
corres- 
ponding 
polyhedra. 
This 
chapter 
is 
only 
very 
lightly 
annotated 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
work. 
There 
is 
a general 
note, 
which 
says 
that 
this 
chapter 
should 
not 
be taken 
as 
part 
of 
the 
main 
work 
but 
as 
an astrological 
digression. 
Kepler 
nevertheless 
invites 
the 
reader 
to 
compare 
his 
reasons 
with 
those 
given 
by Ptolemy 
in 
the 
Tetrabiblos 
and 
the 
Harmonica 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
59). 
The 
two 
notes 
which 
follow 
are 
both 
short, 
and 
deal 
with 
points 
of 
only 
minor 
importance 
as 
far 
as 
the 
main 
subject 
of 
the 
chapter 
is 
concerned. 
It 
would 
therefore 
seem 
that 
although 
Kepler 
had 
modified 
some 
of 
his 
astrological 
ideas 
since 
writing 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum 
he still 
believed 
it 
was 
reasonable 
to 
explain 
the 
"observed" 
powers 
of 
the 
planets 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
mathematical 
entities 
that 
had 
been 
invoked 
to 
explain 
the 
spacing 
of 
their 
orbits. 
Each 
planet 
is 
associated 
with 
the 
polyhedron 
which 
was used 
to 
account 
for 
the 
spacing 
between 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
planet 
concerned 
and 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
planet 
which 
lies 
next 
to 
it 
in 
the 
direction 
towards 
the 
Earth.

Kepler 
merely 
states 
that 
this 
seems 
very 
reasonable, 
without 
presenting 
any 
arguments. 
Since 
Astrology 
deals 
with 
the 
effects 
of 
other 
planets 
upon 
the 
Earth, 
even 
Kepler's 
Astrology 
was 
always 
to 
some extent 
geocentric. 
This 
presumably 
accounts 
for 
his 
relating 
the 
planets 
to 
the 
Earth 
in 
the 
way 
he does 
here. 
The mathematical 
properties 
of 
the 
polyhedra 
which 
were 
described 
in 
earlier 
chapters 
are 
now used 
to 
explain 
astrological 
properties 
of 
the 
planets. 
For 
example, 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
solids 
corresponding 
to 
Jupiter, 
Venus 
and 
Mercury 
all 
have 
the 
same 
face, 
the 
triangle, 
is 
the 
cause 
*of 
their 
friendship 
for 
one 
another 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
35,1.22), 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
square, 
which 
is 
characteristic 
of 
Saturn, 
being 
the 
face 
of 
the 
cube, 
is 
also 
to 
be 
found 
inside 
the 
octahedron, 
the 
body 
associated 
with 
Mercury, 
"makes 
peace 
between 
their 
habits" 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
35,1.28). 
The 
chapter 
consists 
almost 
entirely 
of 
a series 
of 
very 
brief 
assertions 
like 
these. 
Since 
the 
astrological 
powers 
of 
the 
planets 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
rather 
less 
ponderable 
than 
the 
physical 
properties 
of 
the 
elements, 
often 
being 
expressed 
in 
terms 
of 
human 
character 
traits 
and 
human 
relationships, 
Kepler's 
mathematical 
explanations 
do not 
on the 
whole 
seem as 

125 
appropriate 
to 
his 
subject 
as Timaeus' 
explanations 
did 
to 
his. 
Both 
sets 
of 
explanations 
are, 
however, 
of 
the 
same 
kind. 
The mathematical 
forms, 
by means 
of 
which 
Timaeus 
explains 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
elements, 
have 
no existence 
in 
the 
physical 
world, 
and 
nor 
do the 
polyhedra 
which 
Kepler's 
diagrams 
show 
as 
lying 
between 
the 
orbs 
of 
the 
planets. 
Since 
Kepler's 
note 
of 
1621 
refers 
to 
this 
chapter 
as 
a digression, 
we must 
presume 
that 
although 
he did 
not, 
apparently, 
wish 
to 
modify 
it 
as 
drastically 
as 
he had 
modified 
the 
other 
chapters 
in 
this 
section, 
he nevertheless 
no longer 
regarded 
it 
as 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
justification 
of 
his 
theory. 
I 
think 
it 
is 
very 
possible 
that 
he had 
never 
regarded 
it 
in 
that 
light, 
as 
is, 
indeed, 
suggested 
by 
the 
brevity 
of 
his 
treatment. 
We should 
not, 
however, 
take 
this 
brevity 
to 
suggest 
that 
Kepler 
was 
not 
very 
interested 
in 
Astrology 
as 
such. 
There 
is 
ample 
evidence 
to 
the 
contrary. 
Kepler 
wrote 
a treatise 
on the 
subject, 
De 
Fundamentis 
Astrologiae 
Certioribus 
(Prague, 
1602), 
and 
the 
work, 
being 
written 
in 
Latin, 
is 
clearly 
intended 
for 
the 
learned. 
Much 
of 
De Stella 
Nova 
(Prague, 
1606) 
is 
taken 
up with 
astrological 
matters, 
such 
as 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
fiery 
trigon. 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
(Linz, 
1619) 
is 
entirely 
concerned 
with 
Astrology. 
Moreover, 
Kepler 
repeatedly 
discusses 
astrological 
problems 
in 
his 
correspondence.

126 
treatment 
of 
astrological 
arguments 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
must, 
I 
think, 
be explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
although 
he regarded 
Astrology 
as being 
founded 
on a solid 
basis 
of 
observations 
(see, 
for 
example, 
Chapter 
IX 
of 
De Stella 
Nova, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
189 et 
seqq) 
he nevertheless 
did 
not 
regard 
it 
as an exact 
science 
on a level 
with 
Astronomy. 
In 
this 
he was 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
opinion 
Ptolemy 
expresses 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
introduction 
to 
the 
Tetrabiblos. 
As Simon 
has 
shown, 
Kepler 
tried 
to 
reform 
the 
accepted 
Astrology 
of 
his 
day 
in 
much 
the 
same way 
as 
he tried 
to 
reform 
its 
Astronomy, 
but 
in 
the 
former 
case, 
as Simon 
puts 
it 
"The 
remedy 
was 
clearly 
one 
of 
those 
which 
in 
the 
end 
kill 
the 
patient" 
(Simon, 
1975, 
p. 
446). 
Astronomy 
The 
astronomical 
chapters 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum 
give 
a very 
full 
treatment 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
testing 
Kepler's 
theory 
against 
values 
deduced 
from 
observations. 
It 
is 
crucial 
to 
this 
problem 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
merely 
to 
compare 
theory 
with 
observation. 
In 
Kepler's 
day, 
as 
in 
our 
own, 
the 
physical 
facts 
of 
astronomy 
tend 
to 
be deducible 
from 
observational 
facts 
only 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
much 
theory, 
and 
even 
the 
simplest 
of 
the 
facts 
which 
Kepler's 
theory 
sets 
out 
to 
explain 
are 
in 
their 
turn 
theory-laden. 
It 
is 
only 
in 
a 
Copernican 
Universe 
that 
there 
are 
six 
planets, 
explained 

127 
by 
the 
five 
polyhedra, 
and 
only 
in 
a Copernican 
Universe 
will 
the 
orbit 
of 
the 
Earth 
be seen 
as 
dividing 
the 
orbits 
into 
a set 
of 
three 
and 
a set 
of 
two, 
explained 
by 
the 
division 
of 
the 
polyhedra 
into 
"primary" 
and 
"secondary" 
solids. 
When Kepler 
comes 
to 
check 
how well 
the 
five 
poly- 
hedra 
fit. 
between 
the 
planetary 
spheres, 
the 
intrusion 
of 
astronomical 
theory 
is 
much 
more 
subtle, 
but 
equally 
inexorable. 
As Grafton 
(1973) 
has 
shown, 
when 
Kepler 
was 
engaged 
in 
writing 
these 
chapters 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
he repeatedly 
found 
that 
his 
grasp 
of 
the 
relevant 
parts 
of 
Copernicus' 
work 
was 
not 
adequate 
to 
the 
task. 
However, 
Maestlin 
was 
apparently 
very 
willing 
to 
continue 
to 
act 
as Kepler's 
teacher, 
and 
Kepler's 
technical 
questions 
about 
Copernican 
planetary 
theory 
received 
long 
technical 
replies, 
one 
of 
which 
was 
eventually 
adapted 
to 
form 
an appendix 
to 
the 
printed 
version 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
Unlike 
Copernicus, 
Maestlin 
does 
not 
deal 
with 
each 
planet 
separately. 
He begins 
with 
"The 
theory 
of 
the 
Sun, 
or 
rather 
of 
the 
great 
sphere 
of 
the 
Earth" 
, and 
then 
turns 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
Moon 
and 
then 
to 
the 
"superior" 
planets, 
now the 
"outer" 
planets, 
Saturn, 
Jupiter 
and 
Mars, 
after 
which'he 
deals 
separately 
with 
Venus 
and 
Mercury. 
Most 
of 
his 
numerical 
values 
are 
taken 
from 
the 
Prutenic 
Tables 
but 
he also 
uses 
values 
from 
De 
Revolutionibus, 
giving 
references 
to 
particular 
chapters 
of 
the 
latter 
work. 
Perhaps 
Maestlin's 
influence 
lay 
behind 
Kepler's 
convenient 
habit 
of 
regularly 
giving 

128 
references 
in 
a usable 
form. 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
very 
simple 
comparison 
between 
Kepler's 
theory 
and 
Copernicus' 
dimensions 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
which 
is 
described 
in 
Chapter 
XIV 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
we may ignore 
almost 
all 
of 
the 
Copernican 
apparatus 
that 
is 
described 
by 
Maestlin 
in 
his 
Appendix 
(and 
in 
rather 
more 
explicit 
detail 
by Neugebauer, 
1968). 
What 
we need 
to 
know 
is 
summarised 
in 
the 
diagram, 
to 
which 
I have 
already 
referred, 
showing 
the 
orbs 
round 
the 
Sun 
(Tabella 
IIII, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
49). 
As I 
noted 
above, 
the 
key 
to 
this 
diagram, 
whose 
wording 
may well 
be Maestlin's, 
states 
that 
the 
common 
centre 
of 
all 
the 
spherical 
shells 
is 
G, 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Great 
Orb, 
"the 
centre 
of 
all 
[the 
spheres] 
and 
near 
to 
the 
actual 
body 
of 
the 
Sun", 
though, 
as Aiton 
(1977) 
notes, 
the 
shells 
defining'the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth 
have 
in 
fact 
been 
centred 
on the 
Sun. 
The 
planetary 
orbs 
are 
explicitly 
defined 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
actual 
paths 
of 
the 
planets 
in 
space: 
".. 
it 
seems 
to 
us 
that 
we do not 
need 
any 
orb 
that 
extends 
beyond 
the 
path 
of 
the 
planet 
(ultra 
viam 
planetae) 
in 
order 
to 
account 
for 
its 
motion" 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
47, -1.36). 
Kepler 
apparently 
sees 
this 
as a conclusion 
to 
be drawn 
directly 
from 
the 
Copernican 
description 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
47,1.34). 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
it 
led 
him 
only 
to 
an un- 
orthodox 
definition 
of 
a planetary 
sphere, 
but 
its 
emphasis 
on the 
actual 
path 
of 
the 
planet 
points 
forward 

129 
to 
the 
derivation 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
planetary 
motion 
in 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova 
(Heidelberg, 
1609). 
Kepler 
compares 
the 
dimensions 
of 
these 
planetary 
spheres, 
calculated 
from 
the 
numbers 
given 
by 
Copernicus, 
with 
the 
dimensions 
that 
would 
be obtained 
if 
the 
appropriate 
Platonic 
solid 
were 
taken 
to 
determine 
the 
outer 
surface 
of 
the 
next 
sphere 
from 
the 
"known" 
inner 
surface 
of 
the 
one 
outside 
it. 
That 
is, 
he 
checks 
each 
of 
the 
five 
"known" 
values 
of 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
relevant 
spheres 
against 
the 
value 
calculated 
from 
the 
appropriate 
Platonic 
solid. 
We thus 
have 
five 
G 
independtnt 
comparisons. 
Kepler 
puts 
them 
in 
a form 
which 
is 
not 
quite 
a table 
(KGW 
1, 
p. 
48). 
It 
reads

The 
first 
column 
of 
figures 
is 
calculated 
fr om t he 
Platonic 
solids. 
Kepler 
carried 
out 
the 
required 
calculations 
in 
Chapter 
XIII, 
and 
has 
rounded 
his 
numbers 
off 
to 
three 
significant 
figures 
(see 
table 
3.2). 
The 
first 
five 
numbers 
are 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
circumspheres 
to 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
inspheres. 
The 
second 
number 
for 
Mercury 
is 
obtained 
by 
taking 
the 
inner 
sphere 
for 
the 
octahedron 
as 
the 
sphere 
which 
touches 
the 
edges 

130 
of 
the 
solid. 
(Kepler 
calls 
this 
number 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
circle 
touching 
the 
square 
of 
the 
octahedron, 
and 
he gives 
no indication 
of 
knowing 
that 
spheres 
can 
be constructed 
to 
touch 
the 
edges 
of 
any 
other 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids. 
Such 
a sphere 
is 
called 
the 
"midsphere" 
of 
the 
solid 
concerned.

For 
the 
purpose 
of 
later 
comparisons 
it 
will 
be 
convenient 
to 
recast 
Kepler's 
results 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a table 
and 
to 
add 
a column 
of 
absolute

with 
an

However, 
this

his

). 
He concludes 
that 
his 
theory 
seems 
to 
give 
a good 
description 
of 
the 
distances. 
This 
rather 
bland 
summary 
is 
not, 
however, 
Kepler's 
last 
word 
on the 
matter 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
The 
following 
four 
chapters 
give 
a highly 
technical 
discussion 
of 
problems 
relating 
to 
the 
calculation 
of 
the 
dimensions 
of 
planetary 
spheres, 
dealing 
with 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
planetary 
eccentrics 
(Ch. 
XV), 
particular 
matters 
relating 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Moon 
(Ch. 
XVI), 
the 
special 
problem 
with 
Mercury 
(Ch. 
XVII) 
and 
general 
problems 
in 
calculating 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
circles 
from 
which 
the 
orbits 
are 
compounded 
(Ch. 
XVIII). 
Chapter 
XIX 
then 
returns 
to 
the 
"remaining 
differences" 
and 
Kepler 
points 
out, 
not 
as a general 
statement, 
but 
piecemeal 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
orbits 
of 
individual 
planets, 
that 
every 
orbit 
is 
uncertain 
to 
some 
degree 
because 
of 
the 
difficulty 
of 
making 
the 
observations 
required 
to 
calculate 
the 
orbits. 
He notes 
that 
this 
is 
particularly 
true 
of 
observations 
of 
Mercury, 

133 
which 
is 
never 
seen 
far 
from 
the 
Sun. 
His 
reference 
is 
explicitly 
to 
observations 
of 
oppositions 
and 
maximum 
elongations 
- 
the 
types 
of 
observation 
that 
were 
trad- 
itionally 
used 
to 
calculate 
the 
orbital 
parameters 
for 
Ptolemaic 
as well 
as 
Copernican

However 
Chapters 
XV to 
XIX 
4e make 
it 
clear 
that 
Kepler 
was 
aware 
that 
some 
hard 
astronomical 
work 
would 
need 
to 
be done 
before 
better 
dimensions 
could 
be calculated. 
Moreover, 
once 
the 
hard 
astronomical 
work 
had 
been 
done, 
it 
became 
clear 
that 
Kepler's 
distrust 
of 
the 
Copernican 
dimensions 
was 
well 
founded. 
For 
example, 
his 
improved 
orbits 
reduced 
the 
error 
in 
his 
theoretical 
value 
for 
the 
outer 
radius 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
Jupiter 
from 
9% to 
5%. 
As we have 
seen, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Chapter 
XIV 
(KGW 1, 
p. 50) 
Kepler 
concluded 
that 
the 
values 
deduced 
from 
his 
theory 
seemed 
to 
be in 
good 
agreement 
with 
the 
values 
deduced 

134 
from 
the 
best 
available 
observations 
by what 
he believed 
to 
be the 
best 
available 
planetary 
theory. 
This 
conclu- 
sion 
seems 
to 
me to 
be justified, 
not 
only 
by 
the 
stand- 
ards 
Kepler 
appears 
to 
set 
himself, 
but 
also 
by 
the 
usual 
modern 
standards: 
the 
agreement 
is 
good 
to 
within 
10% except 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Mercury, 
which 
is 
the 
case 
in 
which 
the. 
observations 
are 
least 
trustworthy. 
Kepler 
says 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
Chapter 
XX (KGW 1, 
p. 
68) 
that 
his 
satisfactory 
explanation 
of 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
planets 
is 
his 
strongest 
argument 
for 
the 
Copernican 
theory, 
but 
he adds 
that 
he hopes 
that 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
planets 
(that 
is, 
their 
periodic 
times) 
can 
also 
be related 
to 
the 
dimensions 
of 
their 
Coper- 
nican 
orbs 
- 
as we have 
seen, 
he had 
set 
himself 
the 
i 
task 
of 
explaining 
"the 
Number, 
Size 
and Motions 
of 
the- 
Orbs"'. 
His 
first 
attempted 
explanation 
of 
the 
periods 
is 
by straightforward 
proportionality, 
Poc 
r, 
his 
second 
and more 
accurate 
one 
is 
exactly 
analogous 
to 
his 
explanation 
of 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
orbs, 
in 
that 
it 
considers 
the 
difference 
between 
each 
orb 
and 
the 
one 
inside 
it. 
As Gingerich 
(1975) 
has 
pointed 
out 
in 
his 
analysis 
of 
this 
chapter, 
if 
Kepler 
had 
been 
the 
number- 
juggler 
that 
popular 
accounts 
describe, 
he could 
hardly 
have 
failed 
to 
find 
his 
third 
law, 
P2cc r3, 
at 
this 
point 
in 
his 
work. 
However, 
he was in 
fact 
working 
from 
his 
3 
understanding 
of 
the 
physics 
of 
the 
system, 
and 
his 
theory 
1. 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Preface, 
KGW 1, p. 9, 
1.33. 

135 
consequently 
gives 
a markedly 
inexact 
account 
of 
the 
moving 
forces 
1. 
The 
next 
chapter, 
entitled 
"What 
is 
to 
be gathered 
from 
the 
discordance", 
examines 
the 
differences 
between 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
mean 
radii 
of 
neighbouring 
spheres 
obtained 
from 
Kepler's 
theory 
and 
the 
ratios 
obtained 
from 
Copernicus' 
orbital 
parameters, 
and 
makes 
a very 
brief 
attempt 
to 
relate 
each 
of 
these 
differences 
to 
the 
appropriate 
Platonic 
solid. 
Kepler's 
estimate 
of 
his 
own success 
may be 
guessed 
from 
the 
final 
lines 
of 
the 
chapter, 
which 
express 
the 
hope 
that 
he will 
have 
stimulated 
others 
to 
achieve 
a reconciliation 
between 
his 
figures. 
This 
attempt 
to 
use 
the 
system 
of 
nested 
orbs 
and 
polyhedra 
to 
explain 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
orbs 
is 
the 
last 
reference 
to 
the 
theory 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographieum, 
whose 
two 
remaining 
chapters 
are 
concerned 
with 
techni- 
calities 
of 
Copernican 
planetary 
theory 
(Ch. 
XXII) 
and 
with 
"The 
astronomical 
beginning 
and 
end 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
the 
Platonic 
year" 
(Ch. 
XXIII). 
The 
final 
section 
of 
the 
work 
is 
a hymn, 
whose 
astronomical 
content 
appears 
to 
be minimal. 
Kepler's 
belief 
in 
his 
system 
of 
orbs 
and 
polyhedra 
The mathematical 
basis 
of 
Kepler's 
theory 
was 
derived 
1. 
See 
Gingerich 
(1975). 
I 
have 
used 
the 
words 
"moving 
forces", 
but 
Kepler 
in 
fact 
speaks 
of 
"moving 
spirits" 
(animae 
motrices) 
which 
are 
weaker 
when 
further 
from 
the 
Sun, 
or 
a single"moving 
spirit" 
which 
is 
in 
the 
Sun,

from 
the 
Elements, 
whose 
purpose 
he believed 
to 
have 
been 
S 
to 
establish 
the 
existence 
and 
properties 
of 
the 
five 
regular 
solids 
which 
he used 
to 
explain 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Universe. 
Their 
Ancient 
name of 
"World 
Figures" 
lent 
its 
authority 
to 
his 
application 
of 
them. 
The 
particular 
mathematical 
properties 
which 
Kepler 
used 
in 
working 
out 
the 
details 
of 
his 
theory 
are 
treated 
in 
the 
cursory 
manner 
of 
Timaeus 
rather 
than 
the 
precise 
manner 
of 
the 
Elements, 
with 
repeated 
appeals 
to 
the 
aesthetic 
principle 
and 
very 
little 
mathematical 
exposition. 
His 
mathematical 
justification 
for 
the 
theory 
is, 
however, 
far 
from 
cursory. 
He is 
at 
considerable 
pains 
to 
establish 
that 
his 
theory 
contains 
no arbitrary 
elements 
- 
it 
was, 
after 
all, 
the 
existence 
of 
arbitrary 
elements 
that 
he used 
as a weapon against 
Ptolemaic 
astronomy. 
As we have 
seen, 
Kepler's 
theory 
was designed 
to*solve 
two 
related 
cosmological 
problems 
which 
arose 
in 
connec- 
tion 
with 
the 
Copernican 
system. 
The 
simpler 
problem 
was that 
of 
the 
new number 
of 
the 
planets, 
now six 
instead 
of 
the 
traditional 
seven, 
and 
the 
aparently 
arbitrary 
position 
of 
the 
Earth 
among 
them. 
Kepler's 
solution 
to 
the 
first 
part 
of 
this 
problem 
was 
entirely 
clear-cut: 
there 
were 
six 
planets 
because 
there 
were 
five 
Platonic 
solids. 
The 
second 
part 
he solved 
by 
dividing 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
into 
"primary" 
and 
"secondary" 
bodies 
and 
placing 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth 
so 
as 
to 
divide 
the 
nobler 
bodies 
from 
the 
baser 
(like 
an 
astronomical 
salt 
cellar). 
He also 
provided 
non- 

137 
mathematical 
justifications 
for 
the 
position 
of 
the 
Earth, 
referring 
to 
God's 
love 
for 
Mankind, 
which 
is 
expressed 
by 
the 
Earth's 
being 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
planets 
in 
much 
the 
same way that 
the 
Sun was said 
to 
be "in 
the 
centre" 
of 
the 
orbits 
in 
geocentric 
Neoplatonic 
descriptions 
of 
the 
Universe. 
The 
more 
difficult 
problem 
that 
Kepler's 
theory 
set 
out 
to 
solve 
was 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs. 
Since 
the 
Copernican 
theory 
allowed 
the 
actual 
e= 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
to 
be calculated 
from 
observations, 
the 
gaps 
between 
them 
were 
also 
determinate. 
In 
explaining 
these 
gaps 
Kepler 
removed 
another 
apparently 
arbitrary 
feature 
from 
the 
Copernican 
description 
of 
the 
Universe, 
and 
he 
therefore 
saw 
his 
theory 
as 
providing 
support 
for 
that 
of 
Copernicus. 
I 
hope 
that 
I 
have 
established 
that 
in 
1596'the 
fit 
between 
Kepler's 
theory 
and 
values 
derived 
from 
obser- 
vations 
was 
good, 
by any 
reasonable 
standards. 
Un- 
fortunately, 
the 
theory 
itself, 
quite 
understandably, 
now seems 
entirely 
bizarre 
to 
most 
people, 
including 
those 
most 
capable 
of 
undertaking 
the 
complicated 
task 
of 
actually 
checking 
its 
agreement 
with 
"observations", 
namely 
modern 
mathematical 
astronomers. 
The 
result 
has 
been 
that 
when, 
on the 
basis 
of 
some 
misunderstanding 
of 
the 
details 
of 
the 
theory, 
figures 
are 
produced 
to 
show 
that 
it 
fails 
to 
give 
any 
more 
than 
a crude 
account 
of 
the 
"observations", 
it 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
occur 
even 
to 
very 
clever 
people 
(such 
as Nieto, 
the 
author 
of 
an otherwise 

138 
excellent 
book 
The Titius-Bode 
Law of 
Planetary 
Distances, 
Pergamon 
Press, 
1972) 
that 
they 
must 
in 
fact 
be misinterpreting 
Kepler's 
theory. 
They 
apparently 
prefer 
to 
add 
to 
their 
list 
of 
impossible 
things 
to 
believe 
before 
breakfast 
the 
"fact" 
that 
Kepler, 
who 
notoriously 
refused 
to 
accept 
an error 
of 
8' 
in 
his 
theory 
when 
he believed 
the 
observational 
error 
could 
not 
be more 
than 
5', 
and 
as a result 
obtained 
planetary 
orbits 
which 
for 
the 
most 
part 
agree 
with 
modern 
ones 
to 
four 
significant 
figures, 
nevertheless 
explained 
these 
accurate 
orbits 
by means 
of 
a theory 
that 
was 
so 
grossly 
inaccurate 
as hardly 
to 
qualify 
as more 
than 
qualitative. 
I hope that 
the 
present 
chapter 
has established 
that 
Kepler's 
belief 
in 
his 
theory 
was not 
unreasonable 
in 
1596. 
The 
very 
fact 
that 
Kepler 
allowed 
a second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
to 
be printed 
in 
1621, 
in 
itself 
suggests 
that 
the 
huge 
amount 
of 
astronomical 
work 
which 
he had 
done 
in 
the 
meantime 
had 
not 
led 
him 
to 
reject 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
his 
first 
publication. 
In 
my next 
chapter 
I 
shall 
attempt 
to 
explain 
why 
it 
had 
not 
done 
so.

IV 
MYSTERIUM 
COSMOGRAPHICUM 1621 
It 
appears 
that 
the 
learned 
world's 
response 
to 
the 
, -Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
was 
generally 
favorable, 
if 
,, we may 
judge 
by Kepler's 
comment 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
that 
"... 
no-one 
has 
attacked 
it 
[i. 
e. 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum] 
in 
,, these 
twenty-two 
years, 
but 
even 
the 
pupils 
of 
Ramus, 
, that 
hot-headed 
scholar, 
the 
scourge 
of 
Euclid, 
even 
ä, they 
have 
been 
drawn 
to 
it, 
and 
it 
now excites 
so much 
, interest 
that 
mathematicians 
are 
calling 
for 
a second 
edition 
to 
be brought 
out"1. 
The 
prospect 
of 
a second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
presented 
Kepler 
with 
a problem. 
As 
he explained 
in 
the 
new dedicatory 
letter 
which 
accom- 
, --- panied 
the 
second 
edition 
"almost 
every 
one 
of 
the 
astronomical 
works 
I 
have 
written 
since 
that 
time 
could 
be referred 
to 
some particular 
chapter 
of 
this 
little 
book, 
and 
be seen 
to 
contain 
either 
an 
illustration 
or 
a completion 
of 
what 
it 
says,.... 
"2. 
As far 
as 
I 
know, 
no historian 
has 
presumed 
to 
differ 
from 
this 
judgement 
- 
though 
Frisch 
chose 
to 
rephrase 
it 
in 
a rather 
more 
poetic 
form, 
calling 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
"the 
well 
from 
which 
Kepler's 
later 
works 
were 
drawn" 
(KOF I, 
p. 1). 
I do not 
find 
the 
metaphor 
felicitous.

It 
seems 
to 
me that 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
was 
not 
a "well" 
but 
merely 
the 
first 
result 
of 
what 
was 
to 
prove 
a lifelong 
interest 
in 
the 
same problem, 
the 
problem 
of 
explaining 
"the 
number, 
sizes 
and motions 
of 
the 
orbs"1. 
The difficulty 
in 
producing 
a second 
edition 
of 
Kepler's 
youthful 
contribution 
to 
the 
solution 
of 
this 
very 
large 
problem 
arose 
from 
the 
success 
of 
his 
later 
contributions. 
The 
"dislocated" 
Solar 
system 
of 
Chapter 
XV of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmogra- 
phicum 
had 
been 
transformed 
into 
an orderly 
pattern 
of 
planets 
whose 
elliptical 
orbits 
all 
had 
the 
Sun 
in 
one 
of 
their 
foci 
(Astronomia 
Nova, 
Heidelberg, 
1600. ). 
The unsatisfactory 
attempt 
to 
relate 
the 
periods 
("motions") 
of 
the 
orbs 
to 
their 
sizes, 
in 
Chapters 
XX 
and 
XXI, 
had 
been 
superseded 
by the 
discovery 
that 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
periods 
varied 
as the 
cubes 
of

(Harmonices

However, 
Kepler 
had 
not 
changed 
his 
mind 
about 
the 
main 
subject 
of 
his 
work, 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
number 
and 
sizes 
of 
the 
orbs 
by 
means 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids2, 
and 
he was 
therefore 
prepared 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
requests 
of 
"friends, 
and 
not 
only 
booksellers 
but 
also 
those 
learned 
in 
Philosophy" 
(KGW 8,

be 
printed. 
Some people 
suggested 
that 
he should' 
rewrite 
and 
extend 
parts 
of 
the 
work. 
However, 
Kepler's 
own 
feeling 
was 
"that 
the 
book 
could 
not 
be brought 
up 
to 
date 
(perfici) 
except 
by writing 
into 
it, 
almost 
in 
their 
entirety, 
most 
of 
the 
works 
I 
have 
published 
in 
these 
twenty 
years" 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
10,11.11-13). 
This 
would 
appear 
to 
be a somewhat 
extreme 
position, 
but 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
sympathise 
with 
Kepler's 
unwillingness 
to 
set 
about 
writing 
summaries 
of 
large 
parts 
of 
later 
astro- 
nomical 
works, 
merely 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
subsitituting 
them 
for 
the 
corresponding 
chapters 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
In 
fact, 
by 
the 
time 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
that 
work 
was 
published, 
approximations 
to 
such 
summaries 
could 
be 
found 
in 
the 
Epitome 
Astronomiae 
Copernicanae 
(Linz, 
1618-1621). 
Instead 
of 
rewriting, 
Kepler 
decided 
to 
reprint 
the 
text 
of 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
the. 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
and 
to 
add 
notes. 
This 
allowed 
him 
to 
make 
it 
clear 
why 
he had 
changed 
his 
mind 
on 
certain 
matters 
-a 
fact 
which 
Kepler 
regarded 
as 
an 
advantage 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
10,1.15 
et 
seqq). 
The' 
pro- 
cedure 
is 
thus 
slightly 
reminiscent 
of 
the 
spirit 
in 
which 
Kepler 
wrote 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova: 
"I 
recount 
all 
my attempts, 
so 
as 
to 
make 
it 
that 
much 
more 
clear 
why 
I 
took 
this 
particular 
path"'. 
The 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
is 
roughly 
half 
as long 
again 
as the 
original 
edition: 
in 
the 
twentieth-century 
re-editions 
the 
1596 
edition 
covers 
77

Although 
some of 
the 
notes 
give 
quite 
detailed 
explanations 
of 
Kepler's 
changes 
of 
mind, 
many of 
them 
merely 
refer 
the 
reader 
to 
the 
other 
works 
in 
which 
the 
matter 
in 
hand 
is 
treated 
in 
the 
manner 
Kepler 
now 
regards 
as more 
correct. 
The 
tone 
of 
such 
notes 
is 
} 
rather 
that 
of 
pleasure 
in 
his 
later 
success 
than 
one 
of 
explanation 
or 
apology 
for 
his 
earlier 
failures. 
For 
example, 
on the 
title 
of 
the 
chapter 
which 
deals 
with 
the 
"discordance" 
between 
theory 
and 
observation 
in 
his 
suggested 
relation 
between 
the 
periods 
of 
revolution 
and 
the 
sizes 
of 
the 
orbs, 
he comments 
"I 
now think 
this 
guesswork 
(coniectatio) 
is 
superfluous. 
Having

Many 
of 
the

Kepler 
added

severly 
critical. 
An extreme 
example 
is 
the 
first 
note 
on Chapter 
II, 
which 
begins 
"Oh what 
a mistake 
(0 male 
factum)" 
and 
continues 
largely 
in 
the 
form 
of 
rhetorical 
questions. 
This 
tirade 
is 
directed 
against 
what 
Kepler 
believes 
to 
be a serious.

" 
(KGW 8, 
p.

The 
reader 
is 
referred 
to 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
for 
a detailed 
account 
of 
what 
Kepler 
now believes 
to 
be the 
truth 
of 
the 
matter. 
Most 
of 
the 
notes 
deal 
with 
points 
that 
are 
of 
some 
significance, 
but 
Kepler 
does 
also 
notice 
such 
things 
as 
an arithmetical 
error 
in 
Chapter 
X., commenting 
"behold 
a manifest 
hallucination; 
eight 
is 
not 
a factor 
of 
sixty" 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
60,1.32). 
All 
in 
all, 
the 
number 
and 
character 
of 
the 
annotations 
suggest 
that 
Kepler 
reread 
his 
work 
with 
considerable 
care 
and 
intended 
that 
the 
annotations 
should 
be as 
complete 
as 
possible. 
I 
can 
find 
no sign 
of 
any 
inclination 
to 
take 
an indulgent 
attitude 
towards 
his 
early 
work. 
Indeed 
one 
would 
hardly 
expect 
such 
indulgence 
on the 
part 
of 
a man who 
had 
proved 
capable 
of 
writing 
off 
hard-won 
results 
with 
the 
ruthlessness 
shown 
in 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova. 
As I have 
mentioned, 
many 
of 
Kepler's 
annotations 
consist 
of 
little 
more 
than 
a-reference 
to 
the-book 
in 
which 
the 
reader 
may find 
a more satisfactory 
treatment 
of 
the 
point 
concerned. 
Most 
of 
such 
notes 
refer 
the 
reader 
either 
to 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova 
(Heidelberg, 
1609) 
or 
to 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi

V (Linz,

but 
two 
notes1 
refer 
to 
the

(Prague,

significant 
implications 
for 
cosmological 
theory, 
I 
shall 
consider 
Kepler's 
reaction 
to 
this 
work 
before 
turning 
to 
his 
annotations 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum. 
Sidereus 
Nuncius 
(Venice, 
1610) 
The Sidereus 
Nuncius 
describes, 
with 
some auto- 
biographical 
anecdote 
but 
very 
little 
experimental 
detail, 
how Galileo 
constructed 
a series 
of 
telescopes 
and 
used 
the 
best 
of 
them 
to 
observe 
the 
Moon, 
the 
stars, 
the 
Milky 
Way and 
the 
planets. 
He observed 
that 
the 
Moon 
showed 
ranges 
of 
mountains, 
like 
those 
on the 
Earth 
(but, 
he believed, 
much 
higher); 
that 
the 
telescope 
allowed 
him 
to 
see 
more 
stars 
than 
were 
visible 
to 
the 
naked 
eye 
(and 
that 
the 
stars 
did 
not 
increase 
in 
. 
apparent 
size 
as much 
as he had 
expected 
from 
what 
he 
knew 
of 
the 
magnifying 
power 
of 
his 
instrument); 
that 
the 
Milky 
Way was, 
indeed, 
as 
some Ancient 
authors 
had 
stated, 
made up of 
faint 
stars; 
and 
that 
the 
planet 
Jupiter 
was 
attended 
by 
four 
small 
bodies 
which 
revolved 
about 
it 
and 
were 
carried 
round 
with 
it 
in 
its 
orbit, 
thus 
bearing 
the 
same relation 
to 
Jupiter 
as Copernicus 
believed 
the 
Moon 
to 
bear 
to 
the 
Earth. 
Kepler 
first 
used 
a telescope 
in 
September 
1611, 
and 
his 
description 
of what 
he saw, 
unlike 
Galileo's 
descriptions, 
includes 
a comment that 
gives 
some indi- 
cation 
of 
the 
optical 
performance 
of 
the 
instrument 

145 
(which 
Galileo 
had 
sent 
as 
a present 
to 
the 
Elector 
of 
Cologne): 
"... 
For 
to 
us 
Jupiter 
too, 
like 
Mars, 
and 
in 
the 
morning 
Mercury, 
and 
Sirius, 
appeared 
four- 
cornered 
(quadranguli). 
One of 
the 
diameters 
through 
the 
angles 
was blue 
(caeruleus), 
the 
other 
reddish 
(puniceus), 
in 
the 
middle 
the 
body 
was 
yellow 
(flavus), 
amazingly 
bright. 
... 
"ý. 
This 
passage 
and 
the 
following 
two 
sentences 
suggest 
to 
me that 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
images 
might 
have 
been 
improved 
if 
the 
aperture 
of 
the 
instrument 
had 
been 
stopped 
down. 
Since 
Kepler 
mentions 
that 
he 
thinks 
the 
defects 
are 
caused 
by 
too 
much 
light 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
320,1.9) 
but 
does 
not 
mention 
any 
device 
for 
decreasing, 
the 
aperture, 
it 
seems 
probable 
that 
Galileo 
had 
not 
supplied 
the 
Elector 
with 
any 
stops. 
We may 
therefore 
allow 
ourselves 
to 
entertain 
the 
pos- 
sibility 
that 
the 
telescopes 
Galileo 
made 
for 
his 
personal 
use 
gave 
slightly 
better 
images 
than 
those 
described 
by Kepler. 
The 
Sidereus 
Nuncius 
begins 
with 
a , description 
of 
the 
telescope 
but 
it 
does 
not-give 
any 
details 
as 
to 
how 
Galileo's 
observations 
were 
made. 
However, 
the 
first 
astronomical 
section 
of 
the 
work 
contains 
a very 
detailed' 
account 
of 
the 
slowly-changing 
patterns 
which 
Galileo 
saw 
on the 
face 
of 
the 
Moon. 
The 
appearances 
are 
described 
very 
fully 
before 
Galileo 
proffers 
his 
ex- 
planation 
that 
what 
he has 
seen 
are 
mountains 
and 
their

shadows. 
There 
has 
been 
much 
dispute 
about 
Galileo's 
skill 
as an observer, 
and 
it 
seems 
most 
unlikely 
that 
the 
matter 
can 
ever 
be resolved 
one 
way or 
the 
other. 
My only 
right 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
debate 
comes 
from 
my 
having 
looked 
at 
the 
Moon 
through 
various 
telescopes, 
all 
of 
them 
optically 
superior 
to 
Galileos. 
My 
impression, 
for 
what 
it 
is 
worth, 
is 
that 
Galileo 
must 
have 
been 
very 
careful 
and 
very 
patient 
to 
have 
seen 
what 
he claims 
to 
have 
seen 
as 
clearly 
as his 
account 
suggests 
- 
that 
is, 
sufficiently 
clearly 
to 
prove 
that 
there 
were 
mountains 
on the 
Moon. 
It 
is, 
of 
course, 
possible 
that 
the 
account 
is 
not 
a true 
one, 
that 
it 
is 
to 
some extent 
a description 
of 
`thought 
observations" 
designed 
to 
persuade 
others 
of 
what 
Galileo 
himself 
already 
believed. 
Personally, 
however, 
I 
am inclined 
to 
accept 
Galileo's 
description 
of 
his 
observations 
of 
the 
Moon, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
his 
book, 
as an essentially 
accurate 
record 
of 
what 
must 
have 
been 
a very 
exciting 
series 
of 
observations. 
In 
any 
case, 
my present 
concern 
is 
not 
with 
historians' 
opinions 
of 
the 
Sidereus 
Nuncius, 
but 
with 
Kepler's 
opinion 
of 
it. 
' 
It 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
he wrote 
the 
Dissertatio 
and 
from 
an explicit 
statement 
near 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
work 
that 
Kepler 
took 
the 
Sidereus 
Nuncius 
to 
be a 
true 
record 
of 
observations 
made 
by Galileo.

Dissertatio 
cum Nuncio 
Sidereo 
(Prague, 
1610) 
The 
events 
surrounding 
the 
composition 
of 
Kepler's 
letter 
to 
Galileo 
and 
its 
later 
publication, 
in 
a 
slightly 
modified 
form, 
as 
the 
Dissertatio 
cum Nuncio 
Sidereo 
(Prague, 
1610, 
KGW 4, 
pp. 
283-311), 
have 
been 
examined 
in 
some detail 
by 
Rosen 
in 
the 
introduction 
and 
notes 
to 
his 
translation 
of 
the 
work, 
Kepler's 
Conversation 
with 
Galileo's 
Sidereal 
Messenger 
(New 
York 
and 
London, 
1965). 
. Rosen has established, 
from 
the 
autobiographical 
material 
contained 
in 
the 
work 
itself 
and from 
associated 
correspondence, 
that 
Kepler 
wrote 
his 
letter 
between 
13 April 
and 
19 April. 
I 
accept 
the 
evidence 
that 
it 
was, 
indeed, 
only 
on 
13 April 
that 
Kepler 
learned 
of 
Galileo's 
request 
for 
such 
a letter, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
me to 
be impossible 
that 
Kepler, 
who was 
a 
prolific 
letter-writer, 
had 
begun 
to 
write 
to 
him 
as 
soon 
as 
he had 
read 
the 
Sidereus 
Nuncius, 
a copy 
of 
which 
came 
into 
his 
hands 
on 9 April. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
letter 
was 
certainly 
written 
quickly, 
as Kepler 
himself 
remarks', 
and 
the 
printed 
version 
appeared 
early 
in 
May. 
It 
was 
not, 
in 
fact, 
from 
the 
Sidereus 
Nuncius 
itself 
that 
Kepler 
had 
obtained 
his 
first 
news 
of 
Galileo's 
discoveries. 
About 
15 March 
news 
of 
them 
had 
been 
brought 
to 
Prague 
by 
couriers 
from 
Venice 
and 
Wackher 
von 
Wackenfels 
had 
passed 
the 
news 
on 
to 
Kepler, 
in 
some 
1.

ad Lectorem,

excitement1. 
Wackher's 
excitement 
was 
occasioned 
by 
his 
belief 
that 
he had 
acquired 
a powerful 
new argument 
to 
use 
in 
his 
long-standing 
dispute 
with 
Kepler 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
Universe 
might 
be infinite: 
the 
news 
he 
had 
heard, 
which 
had 
originated 
from 
people'who 
had 
seen 
Galileo's 
work 
before 
it 
was 
printed, 
was that 
Galileo 
had 
discovered 
four 
previously 
unknown 
planets. 
Wackher 
thought 
these 
planets 
must 
orbit 
one 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
thus 
indicating 
that 
Bruno 
had 
been 
correct 
in 
his 
suggestion 
that 
all 
the 
stars 
were 
Suns 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
289,1.14). 
Kepler, 
of 
course, 
had 
no wish 
to 
jump 
to 
any 
such 
conclusion. 
His 
first 
thought 
was 
for 
his 
system 
of 
planetary 
orbs 
and 
regular 
polyhedra: 
"So 
I 
asked 
myself 
how there 
could 
be any 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
the 
planets 
without 
damage to my 'secret 
of 
the 
Universe' 
which 
I 
published 
thirteen 
years 
ago, 
and 
in 
which 
the 
five 
figures 
of 
Euclid, 
which 
Proclus, 
following 
Pythagoras 
and 
Plato, 
calls 
'Cosmic 
figures', 
allow 
no more 
than 
six 
planets 
round 
the 
Sun" 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
288,1.34 
et 
seqq). 
It 
then 
occurred 
to 
him 
that 
Galileo 
might 
have 
found 
not 
planets 
like 
the 
Earth 
but 
smaller 
bodies, 
like 
the 
Moon, 
one 
going 
round 
each 
of 
the 
planets 
Saturn, 
Jupiter, 
Mars 
and 
Venus.. 
He thought 
that 
Mercury's 
moon would 
be 
invisible 
because 
Mercury 
was 
too 
close 
to 
the 
Sun 
to 
be observed 
clearly 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
289,1.9). 
Wackher 
and 
Kepler 
agreed 
to 
differ, 
and

149 
waited 
eagerly 
for 
Galileo's 
book 
to 
arrive 
'(KGW u, 
p. 
289,1.24). 
Kepler 
recounts 
this 
story 
by way 
of 
introduction, 
and 
then 
goes 
on to 
give 
what 
is 
more 
or 
less 
a 'com- 
mentary' 
on Galileo's 
book. 
The 
plan 
of 
Galileo's 
book 
thus 
dictates 
the 
plan 
of 
Kepler's, 
so 
it 
is 
not 
until 
the 
last 
section 
of 
the 
work 
that 
he returns 
to 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
four 
new planets, 
which 
he 
considered 
"the 
most 
wonderful 
thing 
in 
your 
[i. 
e. 
Galileo's] 
book" 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
301,1.1). 
When he does 
so, 
however, 
he 
is 
again 
at-pains 
to 
relate 
them 
to 
his 
'secret 
of 
the 
Universe'. 
As he had 
remarked 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Notice 
to 
the 
Reader, 
he felt 
free 
to 
defend 
some 
of 
his 
own 
ideas 
(dogmata) 
as well 
as 
Galileo's, 
believing 
them 
to 
be correct 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
287,1.10 
et 
seqq). 
He introduces 
his 
account 
of 
the 
'secret' 
with 
a 
characteristic 
statement 
on the 
status 
of 
Geometry: 
"Geometry 
is 
one and eternal, 
shining 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
God. 
That 
share 
in 
it 
accorded 
to 
men is 
one 
of 
the. 
reasons 
(causae) 
that 
Man is 
the 
image 
of 
God" 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
308,11.9-10). 
He then 
uses 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids 
determine 
the 
structure 
of 
"our 
planetary 
world" 
to 
prove 
that 
if 
there 
are 
other 
worlds 
then 
our 
world 
is 
the 
most 
perfect 
one 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
308,11.13-33). 
Kepler 
has already 
noted 
that 
since 
the 
four 
little 
planets 
round 
Jupiter 
have 
only 
just 
been discovered 
by 
Man they 
clearly 
cannot 
have 
been 
made 
for 
his 
sake 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
306,1.12 
et 
seqq) 
but 
were 
very 
probably 

150 
made 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
inhabitants 
of 
Jupiter 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
307,1.18). 
This 
naturally 
raised 
the 
question 
of 
Man's 
special 
place 
in 
the 
Universe 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
307, 
1.32) 
and 
Kepler's 
account 
of 
the 
'secret' 
is 
therefore 
designed 
to 
emphasise 
the 
special 
status 
of 
the 
Earth, 
which 
had 
not 
been 
given 
quite 
so much 
emphasis 
in 
the 
full 
account 
of 
the 
'secret' 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum. 
Apart 
from 
this 
slight 
change, 
the 
theory 
is 
apparently 
exactly 
as 
before, 
though 
Kepler's 
account 
of 
it 
is 
in 
philosophical 
terms 
rather 
than 
mathematical 
ones. 
For 
example, 
the 
justification 
of 
the-central 
position 
of 
the 
Sun 
is 
by 
a series 
of 
assertions 
concern- 
ing 
its 
nobility 
and 
power, 
assertions 
which 
are 
more 
reminiscent 
of 
De Revolutionibus, 
Book 
I, 
Chapter 
9, 
than 
of 
the 
first 
chapter 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmograph- 
icum. 
The 
nobility 
of 
the 
Earth, 
less 
only 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Sun, 
is 
shown 
by 
its 
being 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
orbs, 
and 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
its 
orb 
divides 
those 
orbs 
whose 
spacings 
are 
determined 
by the 
primary 
solids 
from 
those 
whose 
spacings 
are 
determined 
by 
the 
secondary 
ones. 
This 
reasoning 
is 
so clearly 
a non-mathematical 
summary 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
that 
one 
wonders 
why Kepler 
does 
not 
give 
a reference 
to 
the 
work. 
There 
are 
numerous 
references 
to 
others 
of 
his 
works 
in 
the 
Dissertatio. 
Perhaps 
he felt 
that 
a reference 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
would 
amount 
to 
an untactfully 
clear 
reminder 
to 
Galileo 
of 
what, 
in 
the 
second 
para- 
graph 
of 
the 
Dissertatio, 
Kepler 
had 
tactfully 
chosen 
to 

151 
call 
their 
"interrupted 
correspondence", 
namely 
Galileo's 
failure 
to 
reply 
to 
Kepler's 
letter 
asking 
for 
his 
opinion 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum? 
l 
Having 
thus 
sketched 
out 
his 
system, 
Kepler 
then 
suggests 
that 
the 
four 
moons 
of 
Jupiter 
compensate 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
that 
planet 
for 
their 
relatively 
in- 
distinct 
view 
of 
the 
four 
planets 
that 
lie 
between 
them 
and 
the 
Sun 
(KGW 4, p. 
309,1.29). 
However, 
he also 
gives 
a mathematical 
explanation 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
four 
moons 
of 
Jupiter, 
namely 
that 
there 
are 
three 
polyhedra 
which 
can 
be constructed 
from 
rhombs: 
the 
cube 
(whose 
face 
is 
a square, 
which 
is 
a special 
case 
of 
a rhomb), 
a twelve-faced 
solid 
(related 
to 
the 
cuboctahedron) 
and 
a thirty-faced 
solid 
(related 
to 
the 
icosidodecahedron) 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
309,1.34). 
My paraphrase 
reproduces 
the 
brevity 
of 
Kepler's 
treatment. 
He gives 
no 
further 
explanation, 
and 
no reference 
to 
any 
other 
work, 
not 
even 
one 
that 
is 
in 
progress. 
The 
last 
two 
rhombic 
solids 
are 
mentioned 
again 
in 
De Nive 
Sexangula 
(Prague, 
1611), 
though 
the 
reference 
to 
the 
triacon- 
tahedron 
in 
this 
work 
is 
very 
much 
in 
passing, 
Kepler's 
main 
concern 
being 
with 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron. 
The 
two 
Archimedean 
solids 
to 
which 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
have 
been 
related 
and 
all 
three 
of 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
reappear 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi, 
Book 
II 
where 
Kepler 
proves 
that

152 
there 
are 
exactly 
three 
such rhombic 
solids1. 
A more 
detailed 
examination 
of 
Kepler's 
concern 
with 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
will 
be found 
in 
Appendix 
5. 
Since 
at 
the 
time 
he wrote 
the 
Dissertatio 
Kepler 
did 
not 
yet 
know 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
orbits 
of 
the 
moons 
of 
Jupiter, 
he could 
not 
check 
whether 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
would 
fit 
between 
their 
ohbs 
in 
the 
same way 
as the 
Platonic 
solids 
fitted 
between 
the 
orbs 
of 
the 
planets. 
This 
omission 
was, 
however, 
repaired 
in 
the 
Epitome2, 
where 
Kepler 
not 
only 
claimed 
that 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
orbs 
agreed 
with 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
spheres 
associated 
with 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
(see 
Appendix 
5), 
but 
also 
showed 
that 
the 
periods 
of 
revolution 
of 
the 
moons 
conformed 
to 
his 
third 
law. 
In 
its 
final 
form, 
therefore, 
Kepler's 
application 
of 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
to 
the 
system 
of 
Jupiter's 
moons 
strongly 
resembles 
his 
application 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
to 
the 
Solar 
system 
of 
planets. 
He does 
not, 
however, 
provide 
any 
explicit 
mathematical 
justification 
of 
the 
new idea. 
Perhaps 
he felt 
a sympathetic 
reader 
could 
devise 
his 
own counterpart 
to 
the 
mathematical 
chapters 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum? 
Kepler's 
suggestion 
that 
the 
three 
rhombic 
solids 
might 
explain 
the 
four 
moons 
of 
Jupiter 
indicates 
that

153 
in 
1610, 
as 
in 
1596, 
he felt 
confident 
that 
properties 
of 
mathematical 
entities 
might 
be seen 
as 
determining 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
observed 
physical 
world. 
Moreover, 
he was 
clearly 
confident 
not 
only 
of 
the, 
principle 
behind 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum 
but 
also 
of 
the 
correctness 
of 
the 
theory 
itself, 
for 
he suggests 
that 
if 
Galileo 
finds 
moons 
which 
orbit 
Mars 
and 
Venus 
then 
their 
orbits 
will 
not 
only 
fit 
into 
the 
scheme 
of 
orbs 
and 
polyhedra 
but 
will 
even 
improve 
the 
agreement 
between 
the 
observed 
planetary 
orbs 
and 
those 
calculated 
from 
the 
theory: 
"Recently, 
while 
recalculating 
the 
orbits 
and-motions 
of 
Mars, 
the 
Earth 
and 
Venus 
from 
Brahe's 
observations, 
I 
noticed 
the 
spaces 
between 
the 
orbs 
are 
slightly 
too 
large, 
so 
that 
when 
the 
vertices 
of 
the 
dodecahedron 
are 
placed 
as 
far 
out 
as 
the 
perihelion 
of 
Mars 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
faces 
do not 
touch 
the 
Moon 
at 
its 
apogee 
when 
the 
Earth 
is 
at 
aphelion. 
Nor 
when 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
icosahedron 
are 
fitted 
to 
the 
aphelion 
of 
Venus 
do 
its 
vertices 
reach 
the 
Moon 
at 
its 
apogee 
when 
the 
Earth 
is 
at 
perihelion. 
This 
shows 
that 
there 
is 
some 
extra 
space 
between 
the 
perihelion 
of 
Mars 
and 
the 
vertices 
of 
the. 
dodecahedron, 
as 
between 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
icosahedron 
and 
the 
aphelion 
of 
Venus. 
... 
I 
hope 
that 
I 
shall 
easily 
get 
moons 
of 
Mars 
and 
Venus 
into 
these 
spaces, 
Galileo, 
if 
you 
one 
day 
find 
such 
moons.

sections 
of 
the 
Dissertatio 
which 
concern 

154 
Kepler's 
system 
of 
orbs 
and 
polyhedra 
are 
very 
short, 
and 
for 
any 
purpose 
other 
than 
my present 
one would 
be seen 
as rather 
insignificant 
parts 
of 
a work 
whose 
main 
interest 
lies 
else? 
here 
for 
the 
historian, 
as 
it 
probably 
did 
for 
Galileo. 
However, 
the 
passages 
relating 
to 
the 
'secret' 
serve 
to 
confirm 
that 
the 
long 
years, 
of 
arithmetical 
work 
on the 
orbit 
of 
Mars 
had 
not, 
apparently, 
altered 
Kepler's 
attitude 
to 
the 
quite 
different 
use 
of 
mathematics 
exemplified 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cos mographicum. 
Kepler's 
annotations 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
1621 
The fact 
that 
Kepler 
allowed 
a second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
to 
be printed 
indicates 
that 
he still 
considered 
the 
work 
as being 
of 
some worth. 
However, 
his 
comment 
in 
the 
new dedicatory 
letter 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
all 
his 
later 
astronomical 
works 
might 
be seen 
as developments 
of 
chapters 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum1 
may, 
at 
first 
glance, 
suggest 
that 
he 
considered 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
earlier 
work 
to 
have 
been 
superseded 
by 
the 
later 
ones. 
It 
turns 
out-that 
this 
impression 
is 
misleading 
(as 
is, 
indeed, 
suggested 
also 
by Kepler's 
references 
to 
the 
polyhedral 
theory 
in 
the 
Dissertatio 
cum Nuncio"Sidereo). 
The 
problem

155 
himself 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
was 
a very 
large 
one: 
to 
explain 
"the 
number, 
size 
and 
motions 
of 
the 
orbs" 
included 
almost 
all 
the 
astronomical 
or 
cosmological 
problems 
imaginable. 
That 
Kepler 
then 
proceeded 
to 
dissect 
this 
vast 
problem 
into 
several 
more 
specific 
ones, 
to 
each 
of 
which 
he assigned 
a 
-chapter 
(or 
two), 
only 
confirms 
what 
we already 
know, 
pwK 
namely 
that 
he was, 
even 
at 
the 
age 
of 
twenty-f! 
e, 
capable 
of 
considerable 
scientific 
insight. 
(He was 
also, 
as 
it 
turned 
out, 
capable 
of 
the 
hard 
work 
required 
to 
solve 
two 
of 
the 
most 
notable 
of 
the 
problems 
he 
had 
isolated. 
) 
As I 
have 
already 
mentioned, 
Kepler's 
notes 
of 
1621 
include 
references 
to 
other 
works 
which 
give 
a more 
satisfactory 
treatment 
of 
the 
matter 
in 
hand. 
However, 
a second 
glance 
at 
the 
new dedicatory 
letter 
assures 
us 
that 
Kepler 
does 
not 
say 
that 
every 
chapter 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
has 
been 
superseded 
by 
a later, 
more 
successful, 
work. 
In 
fact, 
the 
theory 
which 
was 
the 
main 
subject 
of 
the 
book, 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
number 
and 
spacing 
of 
the 
orbs 
by means 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids, 
was 
never 
superseded 
by 
a theory 
put 
forward 
in 
any 
of 
his 
later 
works. 
In 
my previous 
chapter, 
I 
divided 
Kepler's 
arguments 
in 
support 
of 
his 
theory 
into 
three 
kinds: 
mathematical, 
astrological 
and 
numerological, 
and 
astronomical. 
- 
I 
propose 
to 
make 
the 
same 
divisions 
in 
considering 
the 
annotations 
which 
appear 
in 
the 
1621 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
though 
in 
the 
present 
chapter 

156 
I 
shall 
have 
little 
to 
say 
about 
the 
first 
two 
kinds 
of 
argument, 
since 
it 
seems 
more 
appropriate 
to 
consider 
them 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
(Linz, 
1619), 
which 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
my next 
chapter. 
a) 
Mathematics 
As I have 
already 
remarked, 
in 
my last 
chapter, 
Kepler 
makes 
only 
two 
annotations 
to 
the 
specifically 
mathe- 
matical 
chapters 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
and 
both 
of 
these 
notes 
are 
quite 
trivial. 
Since 
there 
are 
chapters 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
which 
are 
characterised 
as 
irrelevant 
(Chapter 
XI) 
or 
as now 
entirely 
out 
of 
date 
(Chapters 
XX and 
XXI), 
we may, 
I 
think, 
argue 
from 
the 
absence 
of 
such 
dismissive 
annotations 
that 
in 
1621 
Kepler 
still 
considered 
the 
mathematical 
chapters, 
Chapters 
III 
to 
VIII, 
as offering 
valid 
arguments 
in 
favour 
of 
his 
theory. 
We know, 
however, 
that 
he did 
have 
one 
very 
radical 
criticism 
of 
the 
mathematical 
reasoning 
to 
be found 
in 
these 
chapters: 
he no longer 
considered 
it 
appropriate 
to 
refer 
only 
to 
three-dimensional 
figures 
in 
seeking 
a mathematical 
explanation 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
planetary 
system. 
This 
criticism 
is 
made 
in 
a note 
on the 
description 
of 
the 
system 
of 
orbs 
and 
polyhedra 
in 
Chapter 
II 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
50, 
note 
(1) 
referring 
to 
p. 
46,1.13). 
As I remarked 
above, 
the 
tone 
of 
this 
note 
is 
decidedly 
rhetorical, 
but 
the 
criticism 

157 
is 
nonetheless 
entirely 
rational, 
its 
basis 
being 
summarised 
in 
the 
final 
sentence 
of 
the 
note: 
"In 
constructing 
the 
number 
and 
sizes 
of 
the 
spheres, 
pure 
lines 
must 
be entirely 
left 
out; 
but 
in 
describing 
motions, 
which 
take 
place 
along 
lines, 
let 
us 
not 
despise 
lines 
and 
surfaces, 
which 
are 
the 
only 
origin 
of 
Harmonic 
proportions" 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
50,11.9-11). 
For 
my present 
purposes, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
note 
that 
the 
first 
part 
of 
the 
sentence 
I 
have 
quoted 
makes 
it 
entirely 
clear 
that 
Kepler's 
criticism 
is 
not 
designed 
to 
cast 
doubt 
upon 
the 
mathematical 
arguments 
adduced 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
The 
extension 
of 
the 
mathematical 
basis 
of 
the 
description 
of 
the 
planetary 
system, 
proposed 
in 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
sentence, 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
first 
book 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V 
(Linz, 
1619), 
as Kepler 
had 
pointed 
out 
earlier 
in 
his 
note 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
50,1.3). 
This 
extension 
will 
be con- 
sidered 
in 
my next 
chapter. 
b) 
Astrology 
and 
Numerology 
Kepler's 
annotations 
to 
Chapters 
IX, 
XI 
and 
XII 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
provide 
valuable 
evidence 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
his 
astrological 
beliefs, 
and 
I 
shall 
have 
occasion 
to 
return 
to 
them 
in 
my next 
chapter, 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
astrological 
parts 
of 
the' 
Harmonices 
Mundi. 
For 
my present 
purpose, 
however, 
the 
only 
part 
of 
this 
evidence 
that 
needs 
to 
be taken 

158 
into 
account 
is 
the 
evidence 
that 
Kepler 
apparently 
no 
longer 
considered 
that 
astrological 
arguments 
had 
any 
important 
part 
to 
play 
in 
supporting 
his 
theory 
that 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
was derived 
from 
the 
Platonic 
solids. 
Some of 
this 
evidence 
is 
very 
clear 
indeed. 
For 
example, 
the 
notes 
on Chapter 
IX 
are 
introduced 
with 
"So 
this 
chapter 
is 
only 
an astrological 
game 
(lusus 
astrologicus) 
and 
should 
be thought 
of 
not 
as a part 
of 
the 
work 
but 
as a digression... 
" 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
59).. 
Chapter 
XI 
is 
also 
characterised 
as 
irrelevant 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
62, 
1.25). 
The 
remaining 
astrological 
chapter, 
Chapter 
XII, 
which 
is 
concerned 
with 
Aspects 
and 
the 
division 
of 
the 
Zodiac, 
is 
not 
directly 
described 
as irrelevant. 
However, 
almost 
all 
of 
the 
very 
extensive 
notes 
refer 
the 
reader 
to 
the 
much 
fuller 
discussion 
of 
the 
problem 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Books 
IV 
and 
V, 
and 
since 
neither 
of 
these 
books 
is 
in 
any 
way 
concerned 
with 
arguments 
in 
support 
of 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(though 
Book 
V, 
Chapter 
III 
does 
contain 
a summary 
of 
the 
theory), 
we must, 
I 
think, 
take 
these 
numerous 
references 
as an indication 
that 
Chapter 
XII, 
also, 
now seemed 
to 
Kepler 
to 
be irrelevant 
to 
the 
main 
purpose 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
These 
notes 
on Chapters 
IX, 
XI 
and 
XII 
should 
not 
be seen 
as 
indicating 
that 
Kepler 
believed 
that 
astrological 
explanations 
had 
no part 
to 
play 
in 
his 
description 
of 
the 
planetary 
system. 
We know 
from 
many 
sources, 
not 

159 
leat 
from 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi, 
that 
Kepler 
regarded 
Astrology 
as being 
of 
considerable 
importance 
in 
this 
connection. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
all 
his 
as- 
trological 
works 
that 
Kepler 
regarded 
Astrology 
as 
having 
a firm 
basis 
in 
observation. 
However, 
the 
notes 
to 
which 
I 
have 
referred 
seem 
to 
me to 
make 
it 
clear 
that 
in 
1621 
Kepler 
considered 
that 
his 
dicussion 
of 
the 
astrological 
powers 
of 
the 
planets 
should 
not 
be 
seen 
as relevant 
to 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
to 
the 
planetary 
orbs. 
There 
are 
only 
two notes 
on the 
brief 
numerological 
chapter 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Chapter 
X. 
One of 
the 
notes 
merely 
remarks 
that 
eight 
is 
not 
a 
factor 
of 
sixty 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
60,1.32). 
The 
other 
points 
out 
that 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
nobility 
of 
numbers 
should 
be 
sought 
in 
Geometry, 
and 
refers 
the 
reader 
to 
the 
first 
two 
books 
of 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
for 
a more 
convincing 
explanation 
of 
their 
properties 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
60,1.19 
et 
seqq). 
This 
suggests 
that 
Kepler 
still 
regarded 
such 
considerations 
as 
relevant 
to-his 
description 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
but 
now thought. 
his 
earlier 
treatment 
unsatisfactorily 
naive, 
as 
well 
he might, 
since 
it 
consisted 
merely 
of 
identifying 
each 
number 
as 
being, 
for 
example, 
the 
number 
of 
solid 
angles 
in 
one 
of 
the 
regular 
bodies. 
In 
fact, 
the 
chapter 
is 
so 
phrased 
that 
it 
reads 
somewhat 
like 
a geometrical 
version 
of 
"Green 
grow 
the 
Rushes 
0". 

160 
c) 
Astronomy 
Between 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum,. 
in. 
1596, 
and 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
second, 
in 
1621, 
Kepler 
discovered 
the 
three 
astronomical 
laws 
which 
now bear 
his 
name. 
In 
Timaeus, 
Plato 
had 
made 
the 
first 
attempt 
to 
show 
the 
mathematical 
simplicity 
behind 
the 
misleading 
complexity 
of 
astro- 
nomical 
appearances, 
by 
separating 
the 
diurnal 
and 
annual 
motions 
of 
the 
Sun. 
With 
his 
first 
two 
laws 
Kepler 
had 
at 
last 
succeeded 
in 
establishing 
not 
only 
the 
mathematical 
simplicity. 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
but 
also 
its 
physical 
simplicity, 
in 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
Sun. 
His 
system 
did 
not, 
indeed, 
seem quite 
simple 
enough 
for 
Galileo's 
taste, 
and 
Kepler 
apparently 
shared 
Galileo's 
attitude 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
he felt 
the 
need 
to 
explain 
the 
particular 
eccentricity 
of 
each 
ellipse. 
It 
seems 
to 
me that 
in 
this 
Kepler's 
Physics 
and 
his 
Metaphysics 
were 
at 
one: 
his 
Physics 
told 
him 
that 
he 
must 
explain 
the 
deviation 
of 
each 
orbit 
from 
a circle 
(a 
circle 
which, 
moreover, 
was 
invoked 
again 
by 
the 
use 
of 
the 
"mean 
radius" 
of 
the 
orbit 
in 
the 
third 
law) 
and 
his 
Metaphysics 
required 
him 
to 
explain 
every 
apparently 
arbitrary 
element 
in 
his 
system. 
The 
explanation 
of 
the 
ellipses 
is 
an important 
part 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book V but 
it 
is 
(as we shall 
see 
in 
the 
next 
chapter) 
equivalent 
to 
explaining 
the 
thickness 
of 
each 
planetary 
sphere, 
and 
is 
therefore 
of 

161 
no 
importance 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
which 
seeks 
to 
explain 
the 
spaces 
between 
the 
spheres. 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
the 
only 
significance 
of 
Kepler's 
first 
two 
laws 
was 
that 
they 
established 
that 
the 
orbits 
(or 
orbs) 
must 
be referred 
to 
the 
Sun, 
and 
allowed 
the 
actual 
paths 
of 
the 
planets 
to 
be specified 
with 
an unprecedented 
degree 
of 
accuracy. 
As I 
pointed 
out 
in 
my previous 
chapter, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
in 
1596 
Kepler 
would 
have 
been 
happy 
to 
identify 
the 
geometrical 
centre 
of 
his 
system 
of 
orbs 
and 
polyhedra 
with 
what 
he 
regarded 
as 
the 
physical 
centre 
of 
the 
planetary 
system, 
namely 
the 
Sun, had 
he had 
Copernican 
precedent 
or 
other 
grounds 
for 
so doing. 
The 
first 
two 
laws 
provided 
observational 
justification 
for 
this 
identification. 
Their 
other 
contribution 
to 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
theory 
was 
to 
allow 
the 
calculation 
of 
more 
accurate 
orbits, 
and 
thus 
more 
accurate 
dimensions 
of 
the 
planetary 
spheres, 
against 
which 
the 
theory 
could 
be tested. 
Kepler 
presumably 
welcomed 
both 
contributions, 
though 
the 
latter 
was 
to 
lead 
him 
to 
make 
some modifications 
to 
his 
theory. 
(These 
modifications 
are 
discussed 
in 
my next 
chapter. 
) 
Kepler's 
annotations 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
mention 
his 
third 
law 
only 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
orbs 
and 
their 
motions 
(that 
is, 
the 
periods 
of 
the 
planets). 
To Kepler, 
the 
order 
of 
priority 
of 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
planetary 

162 
system 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
the 
one 
implied 
in 
his 
description 
of 
what 
his 
theory 
set 
out 
to 
explain, 
namely 
"the 
number, 
size 
and 
motions 
of 
the 
orbs". 
The 
third 
law 
is 
thus 
seen 
as giving 
a mathematical 
account 
of 
how the 
spacing 
of 
the 
planets 
determines 
their 
periods. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
law 
refers 
to 
the 
mean distances 
of 
the 
planets 
from 
the 
Sun and 
thus 
has 
only 
an indirect 
connection 
with 
the 
distances 
between 
the 
planetary 
orbs, 
which 
are 
measured 
from 
the 
sphere 
containing 
the 
perihelion 
of 
one 
planet 
to 
the 
sphere 
containing 
the 
aphelion 
of 
the 
planet 
below 
it. 
In 
fact, 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
third 
law 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V is 
hardly 
less 
casual 
than 
its 
treatment 
in 
the 
notes 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
but 
it 
seems 
more 
appropriate 
to 
postpone 
discussion 
of 
the 
law 
until 
I 
come 
to 
consider 
the 
work 
in 
which 
it 
was 
first 
published. 
In 
the 
present 
chapter 
I 
shall 
concern 
myself 
only 
with 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
first 
two 
laws 
upon 
Kepler's 
belief 
in 
his 
theory 
that 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
was 
derived 
from 
the 
Platonic 
solids. 
That 
the 
orbit 
of 
each 
planet 
is 
an ellipse 
with 
the 
Sun 
in 
one 
of 
its 
foci, 
and 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
planet 
is 
such 
that 
a line 
joining 
the 
planet 
to 
the 
Sun 
sweeps 
out 
equal 
areas 
in 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time, 
are 
facts 
which 
provide 
a mathematical 
description 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
that 
is 
very 
much 
simpler 
than 
any 
of 
those 
which 
preceded 
it. 
Moreover, 
the 
two 
laws 
suggest 
very 
strongly 
that 
any 
explanation 
of 
the 
form 
of 
the 

163 
planetary 
system 
must 
be sought 
in 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
planets 
to 
the 
Sun. 
Perhaps 
Kepler 
might 
have 
taken 
this 
suggestion 
in 
a different 
manner 
if 
he had 
not 
already 
been 
a convinced 
Copernican 
(though 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
see 
how anyone 
but 
a convinced 
Copernican 
could 
have 
discovered 
the 
two 
laws). 
As it 
was, 
he was 
already 
convinced 
that 
the 
Sun must 
be 
seen 
as 
the 
physical 
"centre" 
of 
the 
Universe, 
its 
importance 
being 
like 
that 
of 
God 
the 
Father 
in 
the 
Holy 
Trinity. 
The 
geometrical 
facts 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
orbits 
to 
the 
Sun 
may 
therefore 
have 
seemed 
to 
be no more 
than 
a straightforward 
corollary 
to 
the 
physical 
facts. 
In 
its 
lengthy 
title 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova 
is, 
after 
all, 
asserted 
to 
be con- 
cerned 
with 
celestial 
physics. 
The 
physics 
of 
the 
magnetic 
vortex 
which 
Kepler 
used 
to 
explain 
the 
orbits 
is 
qualitative 
rather 
than 
mathematical, 
but 
it 
seems 
clear 
that 
if 
Kepler 
had 
tried 
to 
give 
it 
a mathematical 
form 
he would 
have 
been 
looking 
for 
an 
explanation 
not 
of 
the 
ellipses 
themselves 
but 
of 
their 
deviations 
from 
circles 
centred 
on the 
Sun. 
It 
is, 
indeed, 
these 
deviations 
that 
he seeks 
to 
explain 
in 
physical 
terms 
in 
the 
Epitome: 
ascribing 
them 
to 
the 
changing 
geometrical 
relationship 
between 
the 
magnetic 
axis 
of 
the 
planet 
and 
the 
magnetic 
fibres 
emanating 
from 
the 
Sun1. 
A mathe- 
matical 
explanation 
of 
the 
deviations 
is 
given 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book V, and 
, as I shall 
describe 
in 
1.

164 
my next 
chapter, 
it 
consists 
of 
considering 
the 
ellipses, 
and 
thus 
the 
thicknesses 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs, 
as 
being 
determined 
by mathematical 
musical 
harmonies, 
Ideas 
coeternal 
with 
the 
Creator 
which 
express 
themselves 
in 
His- Creation 
in 
the 
same way 
as 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
expressed 
themselves 
by determining 
the 
spacings 
between 
the 
planetary 
orbs. 
We might 
perhaps 
have 
expected 
that 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
first 
two 
laws 
would 
tend 
to 
decrease 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
notion 
of 
a planetary 
orb. 
Such 
orbs 
are, 
however, 
one 
of 
the 
persistent 
traditional 
elements 
in 
Kepler's 
cosmology. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
they 
are 
a traditional 
element 
dispenses 
Kepler 
from 
giving 
a detailed 
definition 
of 
their 
status 
and 
properties. 
Although 
there 
can 
be no doubt 
that, 
at 
least 
by 
1596, 
Kepler 
did 
not 
believe 
in 
solid 
orbs 
(see 
Appendix 
2) 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
T 
graphicum 
that 
he does 
not 
use 
the 
word 
orbis 
in 
a way 
which 
would 
allow 
us 
to 
translate 
it 
as 
"orbit" 
i. e. 
the' 
planet's 
actual 
path 
in 
space. 
Instead 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
words 
orbis 
and 
sphaera 
must 
signify 
a region 
of 
space 
through 
which 
the 
planet 
passes 
as 
it 
moves 
round 
the 
Sun. 
Moreover, 
this 
is 
not 
the 
same as a traditional 
"sphere", 
namely 
the 
region 
which 
would'be 
filled 
by a 
system 
of 
solid 
planetary 
orbs 
designed 
to 
move 
the 
planet 
in 
an appropriate 
orbit 
(see 
Chapter 
III). 
This 
impression 
that 
Kepler 
uses 
orbis 
or 
sphaera 
to 
signify 
the 
planet's 
"own" 
region 
is 
confirmed 
by a brief 

165 
reference 
to 
the 
subject 
in 
a letter 
he wrote 
in 
1608: 
"... 
the 
sphere 
is 
either 
a body, 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
physicists, 
or 
the 
three-dimensional 
region 
of 
space 
in 
which 
the 
planet 
may be found 
in 
the 
course 
of 
time"1. 
For 
Kepler, 
the 
function 
of 
these 
orbs 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
to 
define 
the 
geometrical 
structure 
of 
the 
Universe 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
most 
perfect 
of 
mathematical 
figures, 
the 
sphere: 
in 
a note 
added 
to 
Chapter 
II 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
Kepler 
describes 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
as 
providing 
the 
archetypes 
for 
Creation 
and 
the 
orbs 
"serving 
to 
construct 
the 
work" 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
50, 
note 
(3)). 
Apart 
from 
their 
role 
in 
its 
creation, 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
thus 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
an observed 
component 
of 
Kepler's 
Universe 
in 
rather 
the 
same 
way 
that 
the 
energy 
levels 
are 
an observed 
component 
of 
the 
Bohr 
atom. 
Though 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
first 
two 
laws 
did 
not 
apparently 
cause 
Kepler 
to 
change 
his 
conception 
of 
IF 
planetary 
orbs, 
it 
made 
it 
possible 
for 
him 
to 
calculate 
more 
accurate 
dimensions 
for 
the 
orbs. 
The 
extensive 
surviving 
manuscript-material 
has 
allowed 
Biälas 
to 
describe 
in 
some 
detail 
how Kepler's 
work 
on planetary 
orbits 
progressed 
during 
the 
years 
which 
followed 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova. 
It 
appears 
that 
by 
the 
end 
of 
1616 
Kepler 
had 
calculated 
all 
the 
elements

required 
to 
find 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
six 
planetary 
orbs1. 
Mutual 
gravitational 
effects 
among 
the 
planets 
cause 
a secular 
change 
in 
the 
elements 
of 
their 
orbits, 
and for 
some of 
the 
elements 
of 
some of 
the 
orbits 
the 
secular 
changes 
since 
Kepler's 
time 
are 
of 
the 
same 
order 
as 
the 
differences 
between 
Kepler's 
computed 
values 
and 
the 
values 
computed 
for 
1600 
on the 
basis 
of 
3. 
modern 
information 
(see 
Bialas, 
1971, 
for 
references). 
Bialas 
therefore 
does 
Kepler 
the 
justice 
of 
comparing 
his 
values 
with 
modern 
1600 
values. 
I 
have 
added 
present 
day 
values 
(from 
Allen, 
1973) 
merely 
for 
interest. 
The elements 
with 
which 
we are 
concerned 
are 
the 
semi-major 
axis 
of 
the 
ellipse, 
a, 
and 
its 
eccentricity, 
e. 
The position 
of 
the 
focus 
has 
been 
indicated 
fairly 
accurately 
in 
the 
diagram. 
(I 
find 
it 
rather 
surprising 
how large 
the 
eccentricity 
has 
to 
be, 
that 
is, 
how far 
the 
focus 
must 
be from 
the 
centre 
before 
the 
curve 
seems 
to 
me to 
look 
noticeably 
different 
from 
a circle) 
. 
There 
are 
no longer 
any 
ambiguities 
regarding 
the 
correct 
choice 
of 
centres 
for 
the 
planetary 
orbs, 
and 
Kepler 
has 
succeeded 
in 
getting 
rid 
of 
epicycles, 
so 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
inner 
radius 
of 
the 
planetary 
orb 
must 
be SA and 
the 
outer 
radius 
SA' 
(see 
figure 
4.1). 
We can 
see 
from 
the 
figure 
that 
SA =a 
(1-e), 
and 
SA'- 
a (1+e).

The 
thickness 
of 
the 
planetary 
sphere 
will 
thus 
be 2ae. 
Table 
4.3 
shows 
Kepler's 
values 
for 
the 
semi-major 
axis 
and 
eccentricities 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbits, 
taken 
from 
Bialas 
(1971), 
and, 
in 
the 
last 
three 
columns, 
values 
I 
have 
derived 
from 
them. 
Table 
4.4 
shows 
the 
outer 
and 
inner 
radii 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs, 
as 
found 
in 
Table 
4.3, 
and 
then 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
radii, 
first 
the 
"observational" 
values 
(column 
3) 
and 
then 
the 
values 
derived 
from 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
(column 
4). 
The values 
in 
these 
columns 
have 
been 
scaled 
in 
Kepler's 
manner, 
so 
that 
each 
value 
shows 
that 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
outer 
surface 
of 
the 
or'b 
of 
the 
inner 
planet 
would 
be if 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
inner 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
outer 
planet 
were 
1000. 
As in 
the 
corresponding 
table 
in 
my previous 
chapter, 
I 
have 
included 
anachron- 
istic 
columns 
of 
errors. 
Table 
4.5 
is 
a slightly 
modified 
version 
of 
the 
corresponding 
table 
in 
my previous 
chapter, 
to 
allow 
an easy 
comparison 
of 
the 
values 
of 
1621 
with 
those 
of 
1596. 
The 
values 
in 
Table 
4.4 
take 
no account 
of 
the 
orbit 
of 
the 
Moon, 
but, 
since 
the 
table 
shows 
that 
the 
inner 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Mars 
and 
an 
inscribed 
dodecahedron 
are 
predicting 
too 
large 
a radius 
for 
the 
outer 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth, 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Moon 
would 
clearly 
act 
to 
improve 
the 
agreement 
between 
theory 
and 
obser- 
vation. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
for 
the 
prediction 
of 
the 
outer 
surface 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Venus, 
whose 
radius 
is 
also 
too 
large, 
and 
would 
be decreased 
if 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Moon 
were 
taken 
into 
account.

7. Chronologle der Bahnbestimmung 
Im Kepler-Nachlas finden sich zu den Berechnungen einzelner Bahnelemente auch 
hin und wieder Datierungen, die ein ungefähres Bild darüber ergeben, wann Kepler 
an den verschiedenen Details seiner Bahnbestimmung gearbeitet hat. Sicherlich ist 
damit nicht lückenlos ein Tagebuch Keplers über seine Planetenberechnungen 
gewonnen, aber es handelt sich um authentische Daten, die allgemein gehaltene 
Angaben über Zeitpunkt und Dauer der Vorarbeiten zu den Tabulae Rudolphinae` 
zum Teil wenigstens ersetzen können.

172 
Table 
4.4 
also 
seems 
to 
show 
what 
Kepler 
meant 
by 
his 
remark 
near 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Dissertatio 
cum Nuncio 
Sidereo 
(Prague, 
1610) 
that=when-he 
had 
recently 
recalculated 
the 
orbits 
of 
Mars, 
the. 
Earth 
and 
Venus 
from 
Tycho's 
observations 
he had-found 
that 
the 
spaces 
between 
their 
orbs 
were 
slightly 
larger 
than 
those 
required 
by his 
theory 
(see 
above. 
and KGW 4, 
p. 
310, 
1.14 
et 
seqq). 
This 
suggests 
that 
Kepler 
must 
have 
obtained 
some values 
for 
a and 
e for 
the 
orbit 
of 
Venus 
rather 
earlier 
than 
the 
date 
indicated 
in 
Bialas's 
table. 
1 As Bialas 
remarks 
in 
the 
paragraph 
above 
the 
table: 
extensive 
as 
they 
are, 
the 
manuscripts 
do not 
provide 
a complete 
diary 
of 
Kepler's 
work 
on the 
orbits. 
The 
figures 
I 
have 
shown 
in 
Table 
4.4 
are 
not 
dis- 
played 
in 
the 
new edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
Kepler 
refers 
the 
reader 
to 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova 
for 
an 
account 
of 
how "the 
as 
it 
were 
dislocation 
of 
the 
planetary 
system" 
described 
in 
Chapter 
XV may be cor- 
rected 
by means 
of 
Tycho's 
observations 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
90, 
1.2), 
but 
he does 
not 
actually 
mention 
that 
the 
obser- 
vations 
have 
also 
allowed 
him 
to 
calculate 
new dimensions 
for 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
and 
that 
these 
dimensions 
are 
noticeably 
different 
from 
those 
given 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
The 
main 
comparison 
between 
the 
theoretical 
and 
"observational" 
values 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
spheres, 
in 
Chapter 
XIV, 
has 
only 
four 
annotations 
in 
the 
second 
1. 
See 
figure 
4 . 2. 

173 
edition 
of 
the 
work. 
Three 
are 
apparently 
designed 
merely 
to 
clarify 
the 
expression 
of 
certain 
points. 
The 
fourth 
discusses 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
relative 
distances 
of 
the 
Sun and 
Moon 
from 
the 
Earth 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
84,1.30). 
It 
is 
clear 
from 
this 
note 
that 
in 
1621 
Kepler 
believed 
that 
his 
earlier 
figures 
had 
made 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Moon 
larger 
than 
it 
should 
have 
been, 
but 
he does 
not 
discuss 
any 
significance 
this 
might 
have 
in 
assessing 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
to 
the 
Platonic 
solids. 
It 
appears 
that 
Kepler 
wishes 
to 
abide 
by 
his 
conclusion 
that 
the 
radii 
deduced 
from 
his 
theory 
agree 
quite 
well 
with 
the 
radii 
deduced 
from 
observation. 
In 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Kepler 
was 
able 
to 
explain 
away 
the 
discordances 
between 
theory 
and 
observation 
by 
pointing 
to 
the 
uncertainties 
in 
the 
"observed" 
orbits. 
The 
continued 
discordance 
must 
therefore 
have 
appeared 
to 
shed 
doubt 
on either 
the 
new orbits 
or 
the 
old 
theory. 
It 
seems 
to 
me that 
Kepler 
cannot 
have 
known, 
as we do, 
that 
his 
new orbits 
were 
very 
accurate 
indeed, 
but 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
clear 
from 
his 
annotations 
to 
the 
later 
chapters 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
that 
he believed 
that 
it 
was 
the 
theory 
that 
must 
be modified. 
The 
notes 
repeatedly 
refer 
the 
reader 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V for 
an account 
of 
the 
modifications. 
Although 
Kepler's 
notes 
on the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
do not 
give 
a full 
discussion 
of 
how 
the 
agreement 
between 
theory 
and 
observation 
has 
been 
affected 
by 
the 
new 
orbits, 
some kind 
of 
assessment 
of 
Kepler's

the 
matter 
might 
well 
be extracted 
from 
what 
he says, 
and 
I 
do not 
think 
that 
the 
absence 
of 
an explicit 
discussion 
should 
be interpreted 
as 
indicating 
that 
he wished 
to 
ignore 
the 
problem. 
It 
seems 
to 
me that 
it 
is 
much 
more 
likely 
that 
Kepler's 
vagueness 
is 
to 
be explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
by 
the 
time 
he came 
to 
write 
his 
notes, 
in 
the 
last 
two 
weeks 
of 
June 
1621 
(according 
to 
Hammer, 
KGW 8, 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
Afterword), 
he had 
already 
published 
two 
further 
descriptions 
of 
his 
theory, 
both 
of 
which 
discuss 
its 
agreement 
with 
observation. 
One of 
these 
is 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V (Linz, 
1619) 
and 
the 
other 
is 
in 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Epitome 
(Linz, 
1620). 
The 
two 
descriptions 
seem 
to 
be entirely 
consistent 
with 
one 
another 
and 
I 
shall 
concentrate 
on 
the 
former 
mainly 
because 
it 
contains 
a considerably 
fuller 
discussion 
of 
the 
agreement 
with 
observation. 
In 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V, 
Kepler 
uses 
the 
mathematical 
and musical 
results 
of 
Books 
I, 
II 
and III 
to 
explain 
the 
observed 
structure 
of 
the 
planetary 
system. 
Chapters 
I 
and 
II 
of 
Book 
V contain 
discussions 
of 
the 
five 
regular 
solids 
and 
their 
relation 
to 
the 
ratios 
found 
in 
musical 
theory. 
I 
shall 
return 
to 
these 
discussions 
in 
my next 
chapter. 
Chapter 
III 
of 
Book 
V contains 
a summary 
of 
the 
Astronomy 
required 
for 
a study 
of 
celestial 
harmonies. 
The relation 
between 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids 
and the 
six 
> 
planetary 
orbs 
is 
first 
introduced 
to 
explain 
the 
number 
of 
the 
planets 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
298,1.18). 
The 
account 
of, the 
theory 
consists 
of 
little 
more 
than 
a diagram 
(see 
figure 
4.3) 
and 
a reference 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 

176 
graphicum. 
The next 
section 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
sizes 
of 
the 
orbs: 
"Fourthly, 
as 
for 
the 
proportion 
between 
the 
planetary 
orbs, 
the 
proportion 
between 
two 
neighbouring 
orbs 
is 
always 
such 
(as 
may easily 
be seen) 
that 
each 
one 
of 
these 
proportions 
is 
close 
to 
the 
proportion 
between 
the 
orbs 
associated 
with 
a particular 
one 
of 
these 
five 
solid 
figures, 
that 
is, 
it 
is 
close 
to 
the 
pro- 
portion 
between 
the 
circumscribed 
and 
inscribed 
spheres 
of 
the 
solid 
figure. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
exactly 
(plane) 
equal 
to 
it, 
as I 
once 
dared 
to 
promise 
from 
perfected 
astronomy. 
For, 
having 
calculated 
the 
distances 
from 
Brahe's 
observations, 
I 
found 
that, 
if 
the 
angles 
of 
the 
Cube were 
placed 
on the 
inner 
circle 
of 
Saturn, 
the 
centres 
of 
its 
faces 
almost 
touched 
the 
mean 
circle 
of 
Jupiter... 
" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
298,1.33 
et 
seqq). 
Kepler 
proceeds 
to 
work 
in 
through 
the 
system 
of 
orbs 
and'poly- 
hedra, 
noting 
the 
discrepancies, 
but 
not 
giving 
any 
actual 
numerical 
values. 
(The 
arithmetic 
sets 
in 
only 
in 
Chapter 
IV. ) 
The 
following 
paragraph 
sums up the 
situation: 
"From 
this 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
exact 
pro- 
portions 
of 
the 
distances 
of 
the 
planets 
from 
the 
Sun 
were:. 
a. 
not 
taken 
from 
the 
five 
regualý 
solid 
figures 
alone; 
for 
the 
Creator 
does 
not 
depart 
from 
his 
Archetype 
(non 
aberrat 
enim 
ab Archetypo 
suo 
Creator), 
the 
Creator 
being,,,,, 
the 
true 
source 
of 
Geometry 
and, 
as Plato 
wrote, 
always 
engaged 
in 
the 
practice 
of 
Geometry" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
299, 
1.32). 
The 
rest 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V is 
concerned 
with 
explaining 
the 
subtleties 
of 
the 
actual 
Archetype, 
which 
involved 
harmonic 
ratios 
as well 
as the 
Platonic 
solids. 

177 
Kepler's 
belief 
in 
his 
system 
of 
orbs 
and 
polyhedra, 
1621 
As we have 
seen, 
the 
"perfected 
astronomy" 
derived 
from 
Tycho's 
observations 
led 
Kepler 
to 
modify 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
However, 
there 
was 
no need 
for 
any 
drastic 
modification 
of 
the 
theory, 
., which 
Kepler 
clearly 
still 
regarded 
as 
intellectually 
satisfying, 
mathematically 
justified 
and 
in 
fairly 
good 
agreement 
with 
the 
observations. 
He believed 
that 
the 
differences 
between 
the 
theory 
and 
the 
observations 
were 
real 
and 
must 
be explained, 
but 
they 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
him 
to 
be so large 
as 
to 
cast 
doubt 
upon 
the 
essential 
correctness 
of 
the 
theory. 
Moreover, 
the 
modified 
explanation 
of 
the 
orbs, 
which 
is 
described 
in 
Harmon- 
ices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V, 
had 
a wider 
mathematical 
basis 
than 
the 
earlier 
explanation, 
being 
derived 
from 
the 
relations 
of 
polygons 
to 
the 
circle 
and 
the 
relations 
of 
polygons 
among 
themselves. 
It 
also 
made 
a much 
more 
sophisticated 
attempt 
to 
explain 
the 
"known" 
properties 
of 
astrological 
Aspects. 
As might 
have 
been 
expected, 
Kepler 
regarded 
the 
later 
theory 
as 
a considerable 
advance 
upon 
the 
earlier 
one.

HARMONICES MUNDI LIBRI 
V 
One of 
the 
notes 
on the 
title 
page 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
tells 
us 
that 
when 
the 
first 
edition 
was 
published 
Kepler 
intended 
to 
write 
further 
works 
in 
the 
same vein. 
The 
exactitude 
of 
this 
recollection 
of 
1621 
is 
confirmed 
by 
several 
letters 
written 
in 
the 
late 
1590s. 
When writing 
to 
Herwart 
von 
Hohenburg 
in 
March 
1598 
Kepler 
even went 
so 
far 
as 
to 
give 
titles 
for 
the 
projected 
works: 
"I 
intend 
to 
write 
four 
short 
books 
on cosmography, 
1. 
On 
the 
universe, 
and 
particularly 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
world 
that 
are 
at 
rest... 
2. 
On the 
parts 
that 
move... 
3. 
On 
individual 
globes, 
particularly 
that 
of 
the 
Earth 
... 
44. 
On the 
relation 
between 
the 
heavens 
and 
the 
Earth 
... 
"1. 
It 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
note 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
of'the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
that 
Kepler 
had 
hoped 
that 
his 
four 
new works 
would 
be similar 
in 
character 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
that 
is, 
that 
they 
would 
give 
accounts 
of 
their 
subjects 
deduced 
a priori 
from 
mathematical 
principles. 
He gives 
as 
his 
reason 
for 
abandoning 
the 
project 
of 
writing 
these 
books 
his 
realisation 
that" 
the 
heavens, 
the 
first 
of 
God's 
works, 
were 
laid 
out 
much 
more 
beautifully 
than 
the 
remaining 
small 
and 
common 
things"2.

Kepler 
adds,

Prodromus 
[i. 
e. 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum] 
was 
a 
work 
on its 
own 
(egregius): 
for 
it 
was 
not 
followed 
by 
any 
Epidromus 
[i. 
e. 
sequel] 
such 
as 
I 
had 
proposed 
to 
write... 
However, 
the 
reader 
could 
regard 
my as- 
tronomical 
works, 
particularly 
my books 
on Harmonics, 
as 
the 
true 
and 
proper 
sequel 
to 
this 
work". 
(Kepler's 
use 
of 
epidromus 
as 
a counterpart 
to 
prodromus 
appears 
to 
be a solecism, 
or 
perhaps 
an example 
of 
dry 
Tacitean 
wit? 
The 
context 
makes 
the 
meaning 
entirely 
clear, 
but 
neither 
Liddell 
& Scott 
nor 
Lewis 
& Short 
nor 
Ducange 
record 
any similar 
meaning 
for 
the 
word. ) 
A first 
project 
for 
what 
was later 
to 
become the 
"books 
on Harmonics" 
was, 
in 
fact, 
formed 
before 
Kepler 
had 
entirely 
abandoned 
his 
intention 
of 
writing 
the 
four 
cosmographic 
works, 
for 
he wrote 
to 
Maestlin 
in 
August 
1599: 
"If 
I were 
in 
Tübingen 
I would 
be planning 
to 
write 
a new short 
book. 
So it 
is, 
indeed, 
quite 
true 
what 
Maestlin 
said 
to 
people 
like 
me - 
that 
they 
cannot 
do anything 
without 
him. 
For 
I 
shall 
not 
deal 
with 
the 
four 
books 
on cosmography 
unless 
I 
survive 
Tycho's 
editions. 
The 
title 
of 
the 
book 
I 
am planning 
to 
write 
is 
De harmonia 
mundi... 
" 
1. 
The 
following 
three 
hundred 
and 
thirty-two 
lines 
of 
the 
letter 
give 
a summary 
of 
the 
material 
that 
is 
to 
be 
included 
in 
De harmonia 
mundi. 
The 
correspondence 
with 
the 
actual 
contents 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V (Linz, 
1619) 
is 
very 
close. 
In 
particular, 
the 
summary 
of 
1599 
includes 
two 
of 
the 
most 
important 
1. 
Kepler 
to 
Maestlin, 
29 Aug. 
1599,

180 
elements 
of 
the 
published 
work: 
'musical' 
ratios 
are 
deduced 
by means 
of 
geometry, 
and 
these 
ratios 
are 
then 
identified 
with 
ratios 
between 
velocities 
of 
planets 
(see, 
for 
example, 
the 
table 
at 
line 
380 
of 
the 
letter). 
In 
the 
letter 
to 
Maestlin, 
Kepler 
presents 
his 
ideas 
in 
a 
rather 
informal 
manner. 
For 
example, 
he uses 
geometrical 
results 
as 
and 
when 
he requires 
them, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
too 
well 
known 
to 
stand 
in 
need 
of 
proof 
- as 
they 
may 
well 
have 
been 
to 
Maestlin. 
However, 
when 
writing 
to 
Herwart 
von 
Hohenburg 
several 
months 
later 
he gives 
a 
very 
brief 
but 
much 
more 
formal 
outline 
of 
the 
work 
he 
has 
in 
mind: 
"... 
I 
have 
drawn 
up a plan 
and 
first 
sketch 
of 
a short 
book, 
a cosmographic 
dissertation 
that 
I 
shall 
call 
De Harmonice 
Mundi. 
There 
will 
be five 
books 
or 
chapters. 
1. 
Geometrical, 
on constructible 
figures. 
2. 
Arithmetical, 
on solid 
ratios 
3. 
Musical, 
on the 
causes 
of 
harmonies 
4. 
Astrological, 
on the 
causes 
of 
Aspects 
5. 
Astronomical, 
on the 
causes 
of 
the 
periodic 
motions"1. 
At 
first 
glance, 
this 
plan 
appears 
to 
be designed 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
there 
is 
a unity 
among 
the 
traditional 
subjects 
of 
the 
quadrivium, 
but 
the 
resemblance 
to 
the 
plan 
of Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V is 
in 
fact 
very 
close. 
The main 
differences 
seem to be that

projected

p. 
100. 

181 
book 
became 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Books 
I 
and 
II, 
while 
the 
projected 
third 
book 
was 
absorbed 
into 
the 
eventual 
Book 
III 
as 
an introduction 
and 
a first 
chapter 
which 
discuss 
some 
properties 
of 
numbers 
and 
give 
geometrical 
justifications 
for 
assigning 
greater 
significance 
to 
some 
particular 
arithmetical 
ratios. 
We may 
note, 
also, 
that 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V explains 
rather 
more 
than 
was 
promised 
in 
the 
early 
sketch, 
since 
it 
not 
only 
accounts 
for 
the 
periods 
of 
the 
planets 
but 
also 
for 
the 
dimensions 
and 
eccentricities 
of 
their 
orbits. 
Nearly 
twenty 
years 
were 
to 
elapse 
between 
these 
sketches 
and 
the 
publication 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V. 
However, 
the 
surviving 
correspondence 
proves 
that 
throughout 
these 
years 
Kepler 
repeatedly 
returned 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
a universal 
mathematical 
harmony. 
The 
evidence 
thus 
seems 
to 
justify 
the 
historian 
in 
availing 
himself 
of 
Kepler's 
permission 
to 
regard 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
as 
in 
some 
sense 
a sequel 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
The 
later 
work 
is 
not, 
however, 
a sequel 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
it 
is 
concerned 
with 
any 
further 
defence 
of 
the 
theory 
put 
forward 
in 
the 
earlier 
one 
to 
account 
for 
the 
number 
and 
spacing 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs. 
As we have 
seen, 
in 
Chapter 
IV, 
Kepler 
considered 
his 
theory 
was 
not 
in 
need 
of 
further 
defence, 
being 
substantially 
correct 
and, 
moreover, 
not 
under 
attack. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
is 
to 
put 
forward 
a more 
comprehensive 
cosmological 
theory, 
derived 
from 
geometry 
and 
containing 
a slightly 
more 
sophisticated 
version 
of 
the 
theory 

182 
described 
and 
defended 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
The 
new theory 
has 
a more 
elaborate 
mathematical 
foundation 
and 
is 
wider 
in 
scope 
than 
its 
predecessor, 
providing 
explanations 
of 
astrological 
and 
astronomical 
facts 
of 
which 
the 
earlier 
theory 
took 
no cognizance. 
The 
plan 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V 
The 
"short 
book" 
planned 
in 
1599 
was published 
twenty 
years 
later 
as a folio 
of 
about 
three 
hundred 
and 
twenty 
pages. 
Of 
the 
five 
books 
which 
make up the 
work, 
the 
first 
two 
deal 
with 
geometry, 
and 
the 
third 
with 
musical 
theory 
(in 
terms 
of 
the 
properties 
of 
certain 
arithmetical 
ratios), 
while 
the 
two 
final 
books 
contain 
applications 
of 
the 
mathematical 
and 
musical 
theorems 
to 
construct 
explanations 
for 
the 
efficacy 
of 
Aspects, 
in 
Book 
'IV, 
and 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Solar 
system, 
in 
Book 
V (it 
being 
taken 
as an accepted 
fact 
that 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids 
explain 
the 
number 
of 
the 
planets 
and 
the 
approximate 
sizes 
of 
the 
spaces 
between 
their 
orbits). 
The order 
in 
which 
the 
books 
are 
presented 
may at 
first, 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
dictated 
by 
the 
necessity 
of 
proving 
theorems 
before 
using 
them, 
but 
closer 
scrutiny 
reveals 
that 
this 
is 
not 
entirely 
the 
case: 
the 
astrological 
book, 
Book 
IV, 
uses 
the 
geometrical 
results 
directly, 
not 
in 
the 
musical 
form 
which 
they 
have 
been 
given 
in 
Book 
III, 
as Kepler 
himself 
remarks 
(HM IV, 
Ch. 
IV, 
KGW 6, p. 
234, 
1.32), 
and 
the 
musical 
results 
of 
Book

applied, 

183 
until 
Book 
V. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
central 
position 
of 
the 
book 
concerned 
with 
Music 
seemed 
appropriate 
in 
a work 
on Harmony, 
but 
it 
should 
be noted 
that 
Kepler 
uses 
the 
word 
"harmony" 
and 
its 
cognates 
in 
a much 
wider 
sense 
than 
the 
purely 
musical 
one. 
For 
example, 
the 
title 
of 
Book 
IV 
refers 
to 
"harmonious 
configurations 
of 
stellar 
rays" 
when, 
as we have 
seen, 
the 
harmony 
is, 
according 
to 
Kepler's 
explicit 
statement, 
not 
a musical 
one. 
It 
seems 
to 
me that 
the 
position 
of 
the 
musical 
book 
immediately 
after 
the 
geometrical 
ones 
was 
prob- 
ably 
designed 
to 
emphasise 
that 
the 
"musical" 
ratios, 
long 
seen 
as arithmetical 
in 
origin, 
had 
now been 
given 
a basis 
in 
geometry. 
This 
basis 
helps 
to 
justify 
the 
wide 
sense 
which 
Kepler 
apparently 
gives 
to 
"harmony" 
in 
the 
title 
of 
his 
work 
as well 
as 
in 
its 
text. 
It 
also 
allows 
him 
to 
see 
the 
musical 
ratios 
among 
the 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets 
as 
a consequence 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
God 
is 
a Platonic 
Geometer, 
whereas 
they 
might 
otherwise 
perhaps 
have 
suggested 
that 
he was 
something 
of 
a 
Pythagorean 
Numerologist. 
Geometry: 
Harmonices

Books 
I 
and 
II 
In 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I 
Kepler 
deduces 
the 
geo- 
metrical 
results 
which 
will 
be used 
in 
Book III 
to 
show 
that 
particular 
significance 
must 
be attached 
to 
certain 
ratios 
of 
small 
integers. 
He makes 
no 
claim 
that 
the 
work 
in 
Book 
I 
is 
mathematically 
original. 
Indeed, 
he 

184 
goes 
so far 
as 
to 
say 
that 
if 
Proclus 
had 
left 
a 
commentary 
on Book 
X of 
Euclid's 
Elements 
then 
he, 
Kepler, 
would 
not 
have 
needed 
to 
write 
the 
present 
work1. 
The 
connection 
with 
Proclus 
has, 
in 
fact, 
already 
been 
made, 
by a quotation 
from 
his 
Commentary 
on the 
First 
Book 
of 
Euclid's 
Elements, 
which 
appears 
on the 
title 
page 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I, 
in 
the 
original 
Greek. 
A slightly 
longer 
part 
of 
the 
same passage 
appears, 
in 
Latin 
translation, 
on the 
title 
page 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV. 
In 
Morrow's 
translation, 
the 
passage 
quoted 
as an epigraph 
to 
Book 
I 
reads 
"Mathematics 
also 
makes 
con- 
tributions 
of 
the 
very 
greatest 
value 
to 
physical 
science 
[i. e. the 
study 
of 
Nature]. 
It 
reveals 
the orderliness 
of the 
ratios 
according 
to 
which 
the 
Universe 
is 
constructed 
and 
the 
proportion 
that 
binds 
things 
together 
in 
the 
cosmos, 
... 
It 
exhibits 
the 
simple 
and 
primal 
causal 
elements 
as 
everywhere 
clinging 
fast 
one 
to 
another 
in 
symmetry 
and 
equality, 
the 
properties 
through 
which 
the 
whole 
heaven 
was 
perfected 
when 
it 
took 
upon 
itself 
the 
figures 
appropriate 
to 
its 
particular 
region"2. 
Proclus 
seems 
to 
be describing 
a use 
of 
mathematics 
like 
that 
in 
Plato's 
Timaeus, 
where 
stress 
is 
laid 
upon 
considerations 
of 
symmetry 
and 
simplicity 
which 
are 
as much 
aesthetic 
as mathematical.

Chapter 
III, 
the 
geometrical 
arguments 
in 
Kepler's 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
were 
presented 
in 
the 
same way, 
as 
arrays 
of 
facts 
rather 
than 
lines 
of 
reasoning. 
However, 
the 
geometry 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Books 
I 
and 
II 
is 
of 
a very 
different 
order. 
The 
books 
are 
constructed 
as 
series 
of 
axioms, 
definitions 
and 
propositions, 
, -reminiscent 
of 
the 
Elements 
not 
only 
in 
their 
style 
but 
also 
in 
their 
mathematical 
rigour. 
As we have 
seen, 
Kepler 
implied 
in 
his 
introduction 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I 
that 
the 
work 
should 
be 
seen 
as 
closely 
related 
to 
Book 
X of 
the 
Elements. 
It 
seems 
probable 
that 
this 
remark 
is 
meant 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi, 
since 
the 
Introduction 
ranges 
very 
widely 
and 
only 
its 
final 
paragraph, 
with 
the 
marginal 
note 
"the 
purpose 
of 
this 
first 
book", 
seems 
to 
serve 
as a specific 
introduction 
to 
the 
geo- 
metrical 
work 
of 
Book 
I 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
19,1.21). 
However, 
even 
the 
geometry 
in 
Book 
I 
amounts 
to 
something 
rather 
more 
than 
a commentary 
on Euclid's 
work. 
Kepler 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
side 
of 
a regular 
polygon 
to 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle 
in 
which 
it 
is 
inscribed, 
whereas 
Euclid's 
Book 
X is 
concerned 
with 
the 
classification 
of 
different 
types 
of 
surd. 
From 
Euclid's 
point 
of 
view, 
of 
course, 
Book 
X is 
concerned 
with 
the 
classification 
of 
lines 
of 
certain 
magnitudes 
which 
are 
or 
are 
not 
commensurable 
with 
some 
given 
magnitude, 
in 
some 
degree. 
It 
is 
well 
nigh 
impossible, 
in 
giving 
a 
description, 
to 
avoid 
using 
algebraic 
terminology 
which 
serves 
to 
emphasise 
the 
divergence 
between 
Euclid's 

186 
work 
and Kepler's. 
What 
Kepler 
has 
done 
is 
to 
re- 
organise 
Euclid's 
results 
in 
such 
a way 
that 
they 
can 
be used 
to 
classify 
regular 
polygons 
according 
to 
the 
degree 
of 
commensurability 
of 
their 
sides 
with 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle 
in 
which 
they 
are 
inscribed. 
This 
classification 
of 
polygons 
is 
original 
to 
Kepler 
and 
is 
not 
to 
be found 
in 
Euclid. 
However, 
a hint 
of 
its 
possibility 
may perhaps 
have 
been 
taken 
from 
the 
Elements, 
for 
Proposition 
11 of 
Book 
XIII 
is 
"If 
in 
a circle 
which 
has 
its 
diameter 
rational 
an equilateral 
pentagon 
be inscribed, 
the 
side 
of 
the 
pentagon 
is 
the 
irrational 
straight 
line 
called 
minor"1, 
and 
the 
following 
proposition 
is 
also 
concerned 
with 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
circle 
and 
an inscribed 
polygon: 
"If 
an equilateral 
triangle 
be inscribed 
in 
a 
circle, 
the 
square 
on the 
side 
of 
the 
triangle 
is 
triple 
of 
the 
square 
on the 
radius 
of 
the 
circle" 
(Euclid 
trans 
Heath, 
1956, 
vol. 
III, 
p. 
466). 
Furthermore, 
it 
should 
be noted 
that 
the 
comparisons 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
incircles 
and 
circumcircles, 
which 
Kepler 
describes 
in 
the 
Preface 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
12, 
see 
Chapter 
III), 
involve 
drawing 
diagrams 
and 
solving 
tri- 
angles 
which 
make 
a comparison 
of 
the 
side 
of 
the 
polygon 
with 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
circumcircle 
almost 
inevitable,

Euclid's 
definition 
of 
"rational", 
given 
in 
Book 
X 
Definition 
4, 
means 
that 
in 
this 
case 
the 
diameter 
is 
to 
be commensurable 
with 
some given 
magnitude, 
either 
in 
length 
or 
in 
the 
square.

since 
the 
side 
of 
the 
polygon 
forms 
the 
third 
side 
of 
the 
triangle 
whose 
other 
two 
sides 
are 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
incircle 
and 
of 
the 
circumcircle 
(see 
Appendix 
4). 
In 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV, 
when 
Kepler 
comes 
to 
apply 
the 
musical 
relations 
which 
he has 
derived 
from 
the 
geometrical 
work 
of 
Book 
I, 
he 
justifies 
this 
application 
by 
drawing 
an analogy 
between 
the 
circle 
and 
the 
human 
soul 
(HM IV, 
Ch. 
I. 
KGW 6, 
p. 
224 
11.20-30). 
In 
view 
of 
this 
alleged 
analogy, 
it 
may 
be as well 
to 
point 
out 
that 
there 
are 
very 
good 
mathematical 
reasons 
for 
looking 
to 
the 
circle 
when 
investigating 
the 
properties 
of 
regular 
polygons. 
To put 
it 
in 
modern 
terms: 
since 
a regular 
n-gon 
has 
n-fold 
rotational 
symmetry 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
a circle 
may 
be drawn 
through 
all 
its 
vertices 
or 
to 
touch 
it 
at 
the 
mid-points 
of 
all 
its 
sides. 
It 
is 
natural 
to 
use 
these 
two 
circles 
as aids 
to 
constructing 
regular 
polygons. 
Euclid 
is 
not 
given 
to 
appeals 
to 
symmetry, 
but 
when regular 
polygons 
are 
introduced, 
in 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Elements, 
each 
one 
is, 
indeed, 
constructed 
first 
by 
circumscription 
about 
a 
circle 
and 
then 
by 
inscription 
within 
a circle. 
Kepler, 
who 
is 
very 
interested 
in 
symmetry, 
explicitly 
proves, 
in 
the 
fourth 
section 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I, 
that 
"All 
regular 
figures 
can 
be placed 
in 
a circle, 
so 
that 
each 
of 
their 
angles 
lies 
on it" 
(HM I, 
sect. 
IV, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
21,1.2). 
The 
proof, 
as Kepler 
points 
out, 
depends 
on propositions 
21 and 
24 of 
Book 
III 
of 
the 
Elements. 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I 'begins 
with 
a definition 
of 

188 
the 
term 
'regular' 
(regularis) 
applied 
to 
plane 
figures, 
since 
Euclid 
uses 
the 
phrase 
'equilateral 
and 
equi- 
angular'. 
More 
preliminary 
definitions 
and 
propositions 
follow, 
the 
most 
significant 
being 
the 
definition 
of 
'to 
know' 
(scire) 
in 
section 
VII: 
"To 
know 
in 
geometry 
is 
to 
measure 
in 
terms 
of 
some known 
measure. 
In 
this 
matter 
of 
inscribing 
figures 
in 
circles 
the 
known 
quantity 
is 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle". 
It 
is 
in 
terms 
of 
this 
"knowledge" 
that 
Kepler 
proceeds 
to 
construct 
his 
classes 
of 
magnitudes. 
Sections 
XII 
to 
XXIX 
contain 
the 
definitions 
of 
these 
classes, 
with 
some 
associated 
propositions. 
The 
first 
class 
is 
that 
of 
the 
magnitude 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
measure 
(sect. 
XII, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
22). 
The 
second 
comprises 
what 
a modern 
mathematician 
would 
call 
"rational" 
magnitudes; 
Kepler, 
making 
a literal 
translation 
of 
Euclid's 
adjective 
(eJTJ) 
prefers 
to 
call 
them 
"expressible" 
(effabilis) 
(sect. 
XIII). 
The 
third 
class 
comprises 
lengths 
whose 
squares 
are 
commensurable 
with 
the 
square 
of 
the 
diameter, 
lengths-"expressible 
in 
the 
power" 
(sect. 
XIV). 
The members 
of 
the 
following, 
unnumbered, 
classes 
are 
all 
"inexpressible". 
Kepler 
then 
implicitly 
explains 
his 
choice 
of 
the 
term 
"expressible" 
and 
its 
cognates 
by 
complaining 
that 
the 
usual 
Latin 
term 
for 
"inexpressible" 
magnitudes, 
namely 
"irrational", 
carries 
with 
it 
"the 
danger 
of 
much 
ambiguity 
and 
absurdity" 
(sect. 
XV). 
It 
is 
in 
this 
section 
of 
Book 
I 
that 
Euclid's 
system 
of 
surds 
begins 
to 
appear, 
at 
first 

189 
merely 
by 
the 
use 
of 
their 
names, 
but 
later 
in 
the 
form 
of 
numerous 
references 
to 
the 
propositions 
of 
Book 
X 
of 
the 
Elements. 
The 
rewriting 
of 
Euclid 
continues 
until 
section 
XXIX. 
In 
his 
introduction 
Kepler 
had 
taken 
the 
precaution 
of 
warning 
prospective 
readers 
that 
if 
they 
were 
not 
very 
thoroughly 
versed 
in 
mathematics 
they 
might 
prefer 
to 
begin 
the 
book 
at 
section 
XXX (HM I, 
Intro- 
duction, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
20,1,. 
7). 
Caspar's 
last 
note 
to 
this 
first 
part 
of 
Book 
I 
ends 
with 
a thought 
that 
is 
only 
a hairsbreadth 
away 
from 
being 
reprehensibly 
unhistorical 
but 
must 
surely 
occur 
to 
many 
a modern 
reader: 
"It 
is 
amazing 
how Kepler 
manages 
to 
describe 
these 
irrational 
magnitudes 
purely 
geometrically" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
522). 
In 
section 
XXX polygons 
reappear. 
They 
are 
assessed 
singly 
or 
in 
groups 
in 
the 
series 
of 
propositions 
that 
follows, 
in 
an order 
determined 
by 
their 
geometrical 
properties. 
The 
treatment 
of 
the 
square 
is 
a simple, 
but 
otherwise 
typical, 
example: 
"The 
side 
of 
the 
Tetragon 
can 
be constructed 
geometrically, 
using 
the 
angles, 
outside 
the 
circle, 
and 
if 
it 
is 
inscribed 
in 
a circle 
the 
side 
belongs 
to 
the 
third 
class 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
its 
square 
to 
the 
second, 
as 
does 
the 
area 
of 
the 
figure 
... 
" 
(HM I, 
sect. 
XXXV, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
36). 
Kepler 
then 
proceeds 
to 
discuss 
the 
octagon 
and 
the 
star 
octagon, 
which 
can 
be constructed 
from 
the 
square. 
The 
diagram 
in 
this 
section, 
like 
those 
in 
many 
of 
the 
following 
ones, 
seems 
to 
aspire 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
a rectilinear 
design 
for 
an elaborate 
rose 
window 
(see 
figure 
5.1). 

190 
5.1 
Square 
and 
octagons 
(HM I, 
sect. 
XXVI) 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Elements 
considers 
the 
construction 
of 
triangles, 
a square, 
a regular 
pentagon, 
a regular 
hexagon 
and 
a regular 
pentekaedecagon 
(15-gon). 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I 
is 
more 
comprehensive: 
Kepler 
considers 
a diameter 
(XXXIV), 
a square 
(XXXV), 
an 
octagon 
and 
a star 
octagon 
(XXXVI), 
a hekkaedecagon 
(16-gon, 
XXXVII), 
a triangle 
and 
a hexagon 
(XXXVIIi), 
a dodecagon 
and 
a star 
dodecagon 
(XXXIX), 
a 24-gon 
and 
the 
figures 
obtained 
by repeated 
doubling 
of 
that 
number 
of 
sides 
(XL), 
a decagon 
and 
a star 
decagon 
(XLI), 
a pentagon 
and 
a star 
pentagon 
(XLII), 
an 
icosigon 
(XLIII), 
and 
a pentekaedecagon 
and 
star 
pentekaedecagons 
(XLIV). 
The 
inclusion 
of 
the 
diameter 
as 
the 
first 
regular 
polygon 
is 
apparently 
original 
to 
Kepler. 
It 
is 
an interesting 
mathematical 
insight, 
and 
one 
that 
has 
found 
significant 
applications 
in 
the 
twentieth 
century 
(see, 
for 
example, 
Coxeter, 
Longuet- 
Higgins 
& Miller, 
1953), 
but 
we cannot 
be sure 
that 
Kepler's 
purpose 
in 
introducing 
it 
was 
purely 
mathematical, 
part- 

191 
icularly 
since 
he does 
not 
in 
fact 
attempt 
to 
describe 
the 
diameter 
as a degenerate 
polygon. 
He was 
to 
use 
the 
diameter 
in 
deducing 
harmonic 
ratios 
in 
Book 
III, 
and 
it 
is 
more 
than 
possible 
that 
an awareness 
of 
this 
application 
played 
a part 
in 
determining 
the 
mathematical 
content 
of 
Book 
I. 
Sections 
XLV to 
XLVII 
(KGW 6, 
pp. 
47-62) 
deal 
with 
proofs 
that 
other 
regular 
polygons 
cannot 
be inscribed 
in 
a circle 
"by 
geometrical 
means" 
i. e. 
using 
a straight 
edge 
and 
compasses. 
Section 
XLV is 
concerned 
with 
the 
regular 
heptagon. 
After 
having 
shown 
that 
"geometrical 
means" 
are 
of 
no avail, 
Kepler 
turns 
to 
Algebra, 
remarking 
that 
this 
treatment 
of 
the 
heptagon 
is 
due 
to 
Jobst 
BUrgi 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
50,1.24). 
Unfortunately, 
though 
the 
proposition 
is 
true, 
Kepler's 
proof 
of 
it 
is 
fallacious 
(see 
Caspar's 
note, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
526). 
A 
correct 
proof 
was 
provided 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
by 
Gauss. 
The 
final 
sections 
of 
Book 
I, 
numbers 
XLVIII 
to 
L, 
are 
concerned 
with 
defining 
the 
system 
of 
classes 
to 
which 
the 
regular 
polygons 
will 
be assigned 
and 
with 
listing 
the 
polygons 
in 
the 
order 
determined 
by 
the 
degree 
of 
"knowability" 
of 
their 
sides 
and 
their 
areas. 
The 
very 
last 
section 
sums 
up 
the 
results: 
"L. 
Comparison 
of 
the 
figures 
or 
divisions 
of 
the 
circle 
The 
diameter 
comes 
first, 
being 
expressible 
in 
length. 
Second 
is 
the 
side 
of 
the 
hexagon, 
equal 
to 
the 
semidiameter, 
and 

192 
thus 
expressible 
in 
length. 
In 
the 
third 
place 
are 
the 
tetragon 
and 
the 
trigon, 
because 
they 
have 
sides 
expressible 
only 
in 
the 
power. 
In 
the 
fourth 
rank 
are 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
dodec- 
agon 
and 
the 
decagon 
and 
their 
associated 
stars... 
Further 
to 
these 
properties 
of 
the 
side 
there 
is 
another 
indication 
of 
rank, 
since 
the 
figures 
differ 
in 
the 
aptness 
and 
perfection 
of 
the 
area 
the 
figure 
encloses. 
In 
this, 
after 
the 
diameter 
(which 
has 
no area, 
merely 
dividing 
the 
area 
of 
the 
circle 
into 
two 
equal 
parts, 
as Ptolemy 
points 
out, 
just 
as 
it 
divides 
the 
circumference), 
the 
leading 
position 
is 
that 
of 
the 
Tetragon 
and 
dodecagon, 
which 
have 
ex- 
pressible 
areas... 
" 
(HM I, 
sect. 
L, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
63,1.26 
et 
seqq 
and 
p. 
64,1.4 
et 
seqq). 
The ordering 
of 
the 
polygons 
thus 
corresponds 
to 
Euclid's 
ordering 
of 
the 
surds 
that 
describe 
their 
sides 
or 
their 
areas: 
for 
example, 
binomials 
and 
apotomes 
take 
precedence 
over 
majors 
and 
minors. 
Euclid's 
ordering 
was 
equivalent 
to 
listing 
the 
surds 
in 
order 
of 
increasing 
algebraic 
complexity, 
a purely 
mathematical 
affair. 
Kepler, 
however, 
is 
concerned 
with 
placing 
polygons 
in 
order 
of 
their 
rank, 
the 
closeness 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
side 
of 
the 
figure 
and 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle 
being 
taken 
as an indication 
of 
simplicity 
and 
therefore 
of 
nobility. 
In 
later 
books 
of 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
this 
nobility 
will 
be taken 
as an 
indi- 
cation 
of 
the 
figure's 
power 
to 
contribute 
to 
an 

193 
archetype. 
Book 
I 
ends 
with 
this 
classification 
of 
polygons. 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
is 
concerned 
with 
establish- 
ing 
a different 
classification 
of 
regular 
polygons, 
by 
considering. 
their 
"sociability", 
that 
is 
their 
capacity 
to 
combine 
with 
polygons 
of 
the 
same 
or 
different 
kinds 
so 
as 
to 
form 
a "congruence", 
that 
is 
a flat 
pattern 
which 
will 
cover 
the 
plane 
(a 
tessellation) 
or 
a 
polyhedron 
whose 
vertices 
are 
all 
alike 
(a 
uniform 
polyhedron). 
The 
concluding 
sections 
of 
Book 
II 
are 
thus 
very 
similar 
in 
style 
to 
the 
concluding 
section 
of 
Book 
I, 
but 
the 
main 
body 
of 
the 
book 
is 
of 
a very 
dif- 
ferent 
order. 
Although 
tessellation 
patterns 
appear 
in 
several 
earlier 
works, 
for 
example 
in 
Dürer's 
Unterweysung 
der 
Messung 
mit 
Zirkel 
und 
Richtscheyt 
(Nuremberg, 
1525), 
Kepler 
is 
the 
first 
writer 
to 
deal 
systematically 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
constructing 
all 
the 
tessellations 
formed 
by regular 
polygons. 
His 
interest 
in 
the 
problem 
appears 
to 
date 
back 
at 
least 
as 
far 
as 
1599, 
when 
he 
discussed 
tessellations 
in 
a letter 
he wrote 
to 
Herwart 
von 
Hohenburg1. 
The 
work 
on tessellations 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
is 
of 
interest 
not 
only 
to 
historians'of 
mathematics 
but 
also, 
it 
seems, 
to 
some modern 
mathe- 
maticians, 
who have 
developed 
generalisations 
of 
Kepler's 
work 
(see 
Grünbaum 
& Shephard, 
1977).

the

Plato

An

when

Kepler 
apparently

it 
more

less 
as 
a mathematical 
convenience 
which 
allowed 
him 
to 
develop 
his 
laborious, 
but 
rigorous, 
proofs 
by 
exhaustion 
(see

195 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
contains 
Kepler's 
first 
printed 
account 
of 
two 
new regular 
polyhedra 
which 
he 
had 
discovered. 
Each 
of 
these 
figures 
has 
twelve 
star 
pentagon 
faces 
whose 
central 
parts 
are 
hidden 
inside 
the 
polyhedron1. 
This 
concept 
of 
a face 
which 
cuts 
into 
the 
solid 
so 
that 
the 
face 
is 
not 
entirely 
visible 
on- 
the 
outside 
of 
the 
body 
appears 
to 
be original 
to 
Kepler. 
His 
description 
of 
the 
new polyhedra 
points 
out 
that 
their 
structure 
is 
analogous 
to 
that 
of 
the 
star 
pentagon, 
whose 
sides 
cut 
through 
its 
area 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
new polyhedra 
cut 
through 
the 
bodies 
of 
the 
solids. 
As I 
have 
explained 
in 
Appendix 
6, 
I 
think 
that 
Kepler 
may well 
have 
discovered 
the 
two 
new regular 
polyhedra 
by 
considering 
the 
effect 
of 
converting 
the 
pentagons 
found 
in 
the 
Platonic 
dodecahedron 
and 
icosahedron 
into 
the 
corresponding 
star 
pentagons. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
analogy 
with 
the 
star 
pentagon 
seemed 
significant 
to 
Kepler 
and 
he therefore 
gave 
the 
new 
polyhedra 
the 
same 
status 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
correspond- 
ing 
Platonic 
solids 
as 
that 
he had 
given 
to 
the 
star 
pentagon 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
convex 
pentagon 
(HM I, 
sect. 
II, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
20), 
that 
is, 
he regarded 
them 
as 
secondary 
figures, 
mere 
derivatives 
of 
the 
Platonic 
dodecahedron 
and 
icosahedron. 
Their 
inferior 
status 
is 
emphasised 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
new 
solids 
are 
not 
described 
in 
the 
section 
which 
deals 
with 
the 
Platonic

196 
solids, 
but 
in 
the 
following 
section, 
which 
also 
con- 
siders 
two 
incomplete 
polyhedra 
constructed 
from 
star 
polygons. 
It 
is, 
however, 
clear 
that 
Kepler 
realised 
that 
the 
two 
star 
polyhedra 
were 
regular, 
that 
is, 
that 
their 
faces 
were 
all 
the 
same and 
met 
in 
the 
same way 
at 
each 
vertex 
of 
the 
solid. 
Having 
dealt 
with 
solid 
congruences 
which 
each 
involve 
only 
one kind 
of 
polygon, 
Kepler 
turns 
to 
solids 
whose 
faces 
are 
of 
more 
than 
one 
kind, 
and 
proceeds 
to 
give 
a 
lengthy 
proof 
by exhaustion 
that 
there 
are 
exactly 
thirteen 
convex 
uniform 
polyhedra, 
namely 
the 
Archimedean 
solids. 
Historians 
seem 
to 
be agreed 
that 
Kepler 
was 
the 
first 
mathematician 
to 
prove 
that 
there 
were 
exactly 
thirteen 
such 
solids 
(at 
least 
in-modern 
times), 
and 
that 
his 
is 
the 
earliest 
surviving 
description 
of 
their 
structure. 
Pappus 
had 
merely 
listed 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
solids 
(see 
Appendix 
6, 
note 
62) 
and 
the 
work 
of 
Piero 
della 
Francesca 
and 
Luca 
Pacioli, 
published 
by 
Pacioli 
in 
De Divina 
Proportione 
(Venice, 
1509), 
only 
described 
six 
of 
the 
thirteen 
solids. 
Kepler's 
work 
on 
the 
Archimedean 
solids 
must 
therefore 
be seen 
as 
his- 
torically 
significant. 
The 
fact 
that 
he does 
not 
present 
it 
as being 
of 
any 
particular 
importance 
must 
presumably 
be seen 
as 
indicating 
that 
for 
Kepler 
the 
real 
interest 
of 
his 
work 
lay 
elsewhere: 
the 
congru- 
ences 
were 
of 
interest 
mainly 
as 
showing 
the 
congruence- 
forming 
property 
of 
their 
constituent 
polygons. 

197 
In 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
Kepler 
is 
mainly 
concerned 
with 
congruences 
(tessellations 
and 
polyhedra) 
which 
have 
uniform 
vertices, 
that 
is, 
congruences 
in 
which 
the 
polygons 
are 
arranged 
in 
the 
same way 
round 
every 
point 
where 
their 
corners 
meet. 
For 
example, 
in 
figure 
N (see 
figure 
5.3) 
the 
polygons 
surrounding 
each 
vertex 
of 
the 
tessellation 
are, 
working 
clockwise, 
a square, 
two 
triangles, 
a square 
and 
a triangle. 
However, 
Kepler 
fails 
to 
distinguish 
this 
type 
of 
tessellation 
from 
the 
bi-uniform 
type 
we find 
in, 
say, 
R, 
where 
half 
the 
vertices 
are 
surrounded 
by 
two 
triangles 
and 
two 
hex - 
agons 
(in 
that 
order) 
whereas 
the 
other 
half 
are 
sur- 
rounded 
by 
a triangle, 
a hexagon, 
a triangle 
and 
a hex- 
agon. 
P shows 
a uniform 
tessellation 
which 
has 
vertices 
like 
half 
of 
those 
in 
R. 
This 
failure 
to 
distinguish 
uniform 
and 
bi-uniform 
congruences 
follows 
directly 
from 
the 
definitions 
in 
sections 
I 
to 
VI 
(KGW 6, 
pp. 
68-9). 
It 
seems 
particularly 
perverse 
in 
view 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
congruences 
are 
described 
as 
being 
constructed 
by 
grouping 
polygons 
round 
a vertex, 
but 
the 
explanation 
would 
appear 
to 
be that, 
as Kepler 
implied*in 
his 
intro- 
duction 
to 
Book 
II 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
67), 
he was 
really 
concerned 
with 
congruences 
only 
as manifestations 
of 
the 
varying 
capacity 
of 
polygons 
to 
form 
such 
structures, 
either 
in 
the 
plane 
or 
in 
space. 
The 
striving 
to 
enumerate 
all 
possible 
congruences, 
which 
makes 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
an interesting 
piece 
of 
mathematics 
in 
the 
twentieth 
century, 
is 
apparently 
designed 
not

properties 
of 
the 
congruences 
but 
rather 
to 
ensure 
the 
mathematical 
respectability 
of 
the 
classification 
of 
regular 
polygons 
in 
section 
XXIX 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
88). 
Although 
it 
seems 
certain 
that 
the 
main 
purpose 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
must 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
classifi- 
cation 
of 
polygons 
described 
in 
its 
concluding 
sections, 
Kepler 
does 
in 
fact 
consider 
congruences 
involving 
polygons 
which 
do not 
appear 
in 
the 
final 
classification, 
namely 
rhombi. 
Each 
of 
the 
three 
congruences 
he con- 
siders 
involve 
rhombi 
of 
a different 
shape. 
The 
tes- 
sellation, 
figure 
G (see 
figure 
5.3) 
is 
made 
up 
of 
rhombi 
whose 
diagonals 
are 
in 
the 
ratio 
1 :, 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron, 
figure 
Vu (see 
figure 
5.2), 
uses 
rhombi 
whose 
diagonals 
are 
in 
the 
ratio 
1: 
4-2 and 
the 
rhombic 
triacontahedron, 
figure 
Xx 
(see 
figure 
5.2), 
uses 
rhombi 
whose 
diagonals 
are 
in 
the 
ratio 
(1+ f5) 
: 2. 
5.4 
Rhombus used 
in 
tessellation 
G 
(see 
figure 
5.3) 
As Kepler 
notes, 
the 
rhombus 
used 
in 
the 
tessellation 
is 
the 
sum of 
two 
equilateral 
triangles, 
and 
since 
he 
has 
established 
the 
existence 
of 
a tessellation 
made 
up 
of 
such 
triangles 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
tessellation 
of 
rhombi 
follows 
immediately 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
71,1.33). 
Since 
this 
tessellation 
is 
merely 
a trivial 
consequence 
of 
an 

200 
earlier 
result, 
it 
may have 
been 
included 
merely 
for 
mathematical 
reasons 
(or 
because 
it 
is 
a pattern 
some- 
times 
seen 
on tiled 
floors? 
), 
but 
the 
case 
of 
the 
rhombic 
polyhedra 
is 
very 
different. 
Kepler 
does 
not, 
in 
fact, 
give 
a rigorous 
proof'that 
they 
exist: 
the 
propostion 
in 
which 
they 
are 
described 
has 
been 
phrased 
in 
such 
a 
way as to 
make 
this 
unnecessary. 
Kepler's 
work 
on the 
rhombic 
solids 
is 
discussed 
in 
Appendix 
5, 
and 
I 
think 
it 
is 
fairly 
clear 
that 
he saw them 
as 
being 
derived 
from 
two 
of 
the 
"primary" 
Platonic 
solids, 
the 
cube 
and 
the 
dodecahedron, 
while 
the 
cube 
itself, 
which 
he wished 
to 
add 
to 
the 
list 
of 
rhombic 
solids 
"for 
its 
faces 
also 
have 
four 
equal 
sides" 
(HM II, 
sect. 
XXVII, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
84,1.7), 
was 
seen 
as 
derived 
from 
the 
tetrahedron, 
the 
remaining 
"primary" 
solid, 
by a similar 
construction. 
However, 
none 
of 
this 
is 
mentioned 
in 
Harmonices 
Mündi 
Book 
II 
section 
XXVII. 
Moreover, 
I 
have 
not 
found 
any 
application 
of 
these 
polyhedra 
later 
in 
the 
work. 
Nevertheless, 
we do know 
that 
Kepler 
did 
apply 
the 
three 
rhombic 
solids 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
explaining 
the 
number 
and 
spacing 
of 
the 
newly-discovered 
moons 
of 
Jupiter 
in 
his 
Dissertatio 
cum Nuncio 
Sidereo 
(Prague, 
1610, 
KGW 4, 
p. 
309,1.304, 
see 
Chapter 
IV 
above) 
and 
in 
the 
Epitome 
Astronomiae 
Copernieanae 
(Book 
IV, 
Linz, 
1620, 
p. 
554, 
KGW 7, 
p. 
318). 
This 
seems to me to 
suggest 
that 
Kepler 
intended 
the 
results 
of 
section 
XXVII 
to 
be as 
applicable 
as 
the 
rest 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II. 
Perhaps 
at 
the 
time 
he wrote 
Book 
II 
he intended 
that 

201 
Book 
V should 
include 
a discussion 
of 
the 
moons 
of 
Jupiter. 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
ends 
with 
two 
sections 
entitled 
"conclusion". 
The 
first., 
section 
XXIX, 
is 
analogous 
to 
the 
final 
section 
of 
Book 
I. 
' It 
places 
the 
regular 
polygons 
in 
classes 
according 
to 
their 
capacity 
for 
forming 
congruences, 
those 
which 
form 
more, 
or 
more 
perfect, 
congruences 
being 
regarded 
as 
the 
more 
noble. 
For 
example, 
"the 
trigon 
and 
the 
tetragon 
are 
of 
the 
first 
degree 
because 
they 
form 
congruences 
in 
space 
as well 
as 
in 
the 
plane, 
both 
among 
themselves, 
with 
figures 
all 
of 
one 
kind, 
and 
also 
when 
combined 
with 
other 
figures" 
(HM II, 
sect. 
XXIX, 
KGW 6. p . 88). 
Kepler 
notes, 
however, 
that 
a slightly 
different 
ordering 
is 
obtained 
if 
we consider 
only 
congruences 
in the 
plane 
(tessellations). 
He finally 
decides 
to 
divide 
the 
polygons 
into 
three 
classes, 
according 
to 
their 
capacity 
for 
forming 
congruences, 
the 
classes 
being 
named 
after 
their 
typical 
members: 
the 
octagon, 
the 
decagon 
and 
the 
icosigon. 
The 
section 
ends 
with 
an 
indication 
of 
the 
wider 
significance 
of 
this 
division: 
"These 
classes 
will 
find 
their 
application 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
Aspects 
in 
Book 
IV" 
(HM II, 
sect. 
XXIX, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
89). 
The 
second 
"conclusion", 
section 
XXX, 
compares 
the 
classification 
of 
polygons 
derived 
in 
Book 
II, 
from 
"congruence", 
with 
that 
derived 
in 
Book 
It 
from 
"demon- 
stration". 
In 
the 
Introduction 
to 
Book 
II 
Kepler 
had 
noted 
that 
since 
"demonstration" 
related 
to 
a single 

202 
polygon, 
considered 
alone, 
whereas 
"congruence" 
related 
to 
combinations 
of 
polygons, 
which 
might 
be of 
more 
than 
one kind, 
the 
two 
properties 
would 
be expected 
to 
give 
rise 
to 
different 
classifications 
(HM II, 
Intro- 
duction, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
67,1.4 
et 
seqq). 
In 
section 
XXX 
he merely 
makes 
an initial 
remark 
that 
the 
classifications 
are 
different 
and 
then 
proceeds 
to 
describe 
the 
dif- 
ferent 
ranks 
which 
various 
polygons 
hold 
in 
the 
two 
systems. 
It 
seems 
possible 
that 
he had 
hoped 
that 
the 
classifications 
might 
correspond 
more 
closely, 
since 
he 
notes 
that 
"the 
pentekaedecagon 
shows 
a pleasing 
uniformity 
of 
properties 
in 
these 
two 
respects: 
since 
it 
has 
no proper 
demonstration 
but 
only 
an accidental 
one, 
and 
it 
will 
not 
form 
any 
complete 
congruences 
but 
only 
the 
beginning 
of 
a congruence, 
which 
does 
not 
surround 
the 
whole 
figure" 
(HM II, 
sect. 
XXX, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
89,1.17), 
adding 
that 
"These 
properties 
are 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
below 
in 
Book 
III 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
origin 
and use 
of 
the 
semitone". 
This 
is 
the 
final 
sentence 
of 
Book 
II. 
Presumably 
it 
seemed 
appropriate 
to 
Kepler 
that 
Book 
II 
should 
end 
with 
this 
hint 
of 
its 
applications, 
but 
a 
modern 
reader 
can 
hardly 
help 
reflecting 
that 
Kepler 
treated 
his 
pure 
mathematical 
discoveries 
as 
cavalierly 
as he had 
treated 
his 
laws 
of 
planetary 
motion. 
He had, 
however, 
made 
it 
clear 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I 
that 
he was 
not 
concerned 
with 
pure 
mathe- 
matics 
but 
rather 
with 
applicable 
mathematics. 
The 

203 
quotation 
from 
Proclus 
on the 
title 
page 
points 
out 
that 
mathematics 
is 
an aid 
to 
understanding 
the 
natural 
world, 
and 
in 
the 
Introduction 
to 
Book 
I Kepler 
had 
indicated 
that 
his 
own mathematics 
was 
conceived 
in 
exactly 
this 
spirit: 
"... 
I 
am not 
a Geometer 
working 
on 
[Natural] 
Philosophy, 
but 
a [Natural] 
Philosopher 
working 
on this 
part 
of 
Geometry" 
(HM I, 
Introduction, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
20,1.1 
et 
seq). 
Detailed 
justifications 
for 
particular 
applications 
are 
given 
when 
Kepler 
comes 
to 
apply 
his 
results,. 
in 
Books 
III, 
IV 
and 
V. 
Music: 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
III 
Kepler 
seems 
to 
have 
attached 
considerable 
importance 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
deriving 
musical 
ratios 
from 
the 
regular 
polygons 
which 
could 
be inscribed 
in 
a circle, 
thereby 
dividing 
it 
into 
a number 
of 
equal 
arcs. 
It 
is 
with 
a 
reference 
to 
this 
idea 
that 
he begins 
his 
introduction 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I, 
a passage 
which 
is, 
as we 
have 
seen, 
intended 
as 
an introduction 
to 
the 
whole 
work, 
only 
the 
final 
paragraph, 
with 
the 
marginal 
note 
"the 
purpose 
of 
this 
first 
book", 
serving 
as 
a specific 
introduction 
to 
Book 
I. 
The 
first 
sentence 
of 
the 
general 
introduction 
reads 
"Since 
today, 
to 
judge 
by 
the 
books 
that 
are 
published, 
there 
is 
a total 
neglect 
of 
the 
intellectual 
distinctions 
to 
be made 
among 
geometrical 
things, 
I 
thought 
fit 
to 
state 
at 
the 
outset 
that 
it 
is 
from 
the 
divisions 
of 
the 
circle 
into 
equal 
aliquot 
parts, 

204 
by means 
of 
geometrical 
construction, 
that 
is, 
from 
the 
constructible 
Regular 
plane 
figures, 
that 
we should 
seek 
the 
causes 
of 
Harmonic 
proportions" 
(HM I, 
Intro- 
duction, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
15). 
Kepler's 
interest 
in 
giving 
a geometrical 
explanation 
of 
musical 
ratios 
dates 
back 
to 
the 
time 
when 
he was 
writing 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
In 
Chapter 
X of 
that 
work 
he attempted 
to 
provide 
a geometrical 
basis 
for 
the 
usual 
numerological 
account 
of 
musical 
ratios 
by 
showing 
that 
the 
"noble" 
numbers 
involved 
in 
such 
ratios 
have 
a connection 
with 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids: 
for 
example, 
by being 
the 
number 
of 
sides 
of 
the 
polygons 
that 
form 
their 
faces, 
or 
the 
number 
of 
faces 
of 
the 
solid 
(Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Chapter-X, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
37); 
and 
in 
Chapter 
XII'he 
tried 
to 
relate 
the 
musical 
ratios 
themselves 
to 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids, 
somewhat 
indirectly, 
through 
imagined 
divisions 
of 
the 
circle 
of 
the 
Zodiac 
by 
the 
polygons 
obtained 
as meridian 
sections 
of 
the 
solids, 
the 
musical 
ratios 
then 
being 
introduced 
as 
analogous 
to 
astrological 
Aspects., 
1 both 
types 
of 
entity 
being 
regarded 
as 
examples 
of 
mathematical 
1. 
Kepler 
defines 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
an Aspect 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
239 
et 
seq). 
He first 
defines 
a "configuration" 
of 
two 
bodies 
as 
being 
the 
angle 
between 
the 
lines 
joining 
the 
bodies 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
pointing 
out 
that 
in 
the 
case 
of 
planets 
this 
is 
the 
angular 
distance 
between 
them, 
measured 
along 
the 
circle 
of 
the 
Zodiac. 
An "effective 
configuration" 
(i. 
e. 
an 
Aspect) 
is 
one 
in 
which 
"the 
rays 
from 
the 
planets 
make 
an angle 
which 
is 
such 
that 
it 
stimulates 
sub- 
lunary 
Nature 
and 
the 
lower 
faculties 
of 
Animate 
things" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
240,1.34). 
Kepler 
traces 
his 
definitions 
back 
to 
the 
Tetrabiblos 
of 
Ptolemy. 
t 

205 
"harmonies". 
It 
appears 
that, 
even 
at 
the 
time 
he wrote 
this 
chapter, 
Kepler 
did 
not 
regard 
this 
account 
of 
the 
harmonies 
as 
entirely 
satisfactory, 
since 
he 
comments 
that 
"because 
we do not 
know 
the 
causes 
of 
this 
re- 
lationship 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
associate 
particular 
harmonic 
ratios 
with 
particular 
solids" 
(Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Chapter 
XII, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
41,1.12 
et 
seqq). 
In 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(Frankfurt, 
1621) 
this 
chapter 
has 
acquired 
thirty- 
nine 
notes, 
whose 
total 
length 
is 
slightly 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
original 
chapter. 
These 
notes 
are 
mainly 
concerned 
to 
disentangle 
the 
problems 
which 
Kepler 
had 
lumped 
together 
in 
1595, 
but 
regarded 
as 
essentially 
distinct 
by 
1621. 
In 
fact, 
the 
disentangling 
seems 
to 
have 
started 
fairly 
soon 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum: 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Herwart 
von 
Hohenburg, 
written 
in 
May 
1599, 
Kepler 
rejects 
the 
published 
explanation 
of 
Aspects 
and 
suggests 
an alternative 
which 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
the 
Platonic 
solids, 
but 
instead 
derives 
Aspects 
from 
musical 
ratios 
among 
the 
arcs 
into 
which 
the 
circle 
of 
the 
Zodiac 
is 
divided 
by 
bodies 
that 
are 
at 
Aspect 
to 
one 
another. 
The 
accompanying 
group 
of 
diagrams 
shows 
the 
Zodiac 
opened 
out 
to 
resemble 
the 
string 
of 
the 
traditional 
monochord1.

correct 
musical 
ratios

Kepler 
had 
to 
employ 
an Aspect 
in 
which 
two 
bodies 
were 
separated 
by 
one 
fifth 
of 
the 
Zodiac. 
This 
was 
not 
a 
recognised 
Aspect 
at 
the 
time, 
though 
Kepler 
was later 
to 
suggest 
that 
it 
should 
perhaps 
be taken 
into 
account 
In 
this 
letter 
to 
Herwart, 
Kepler 
seems 
to 
regard 
the 
musical 
ratios 
as merely 
given, 
but 
a later 
letter 
to 
Herwart, 
written 
in 
August 
1599, 
contains 
a fairly 
substantial 
attempt 
to 
explain 
their 
origin. 
The 
letter 
is 
so long 
that 
Kepler 
has 
divided 
it 
into 
numbered 
sections. 
The 
fifth 
begins 
"On 
the 
causes-of 
musical 
harmonies. 
And since 
you 
are 
interested 
in 
m_y 
discus- 
sion 
of 
Aspects 
I 
shall 
add 
something 
here 
on that 
too. 
I 
changed 
my shape 
a thousand 
times, 
like 
Proteus, 
first 
to 
show 
by Geometry 
that 
there 
were 
just 
seven 
Musical 
harmonies, 
and 
then, 
on your 
account, 
to 
separate 
the 
cause 
of 
Aspects 
from 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
harmonies, 
leaving 
Astronomy 
no more 
Aspects 
than 
are 
usually 
accepted. 
I 
have 
hold 
of 
both 
parts, 
but 
as one 
has 
a wolf 
by 
the 
ears...

Kepler

the 
musical 
ratios

looking 
for, 
dismisses 
the 
idea 
of 
seeking 
an explanation 
in

("For

as being

in 
what 
sense: 
his 
words 
are 
"In 
lineis 
nulla 
finitio 
est"), 
and 
then 
looks 
to 
the 
circle: 
"Among 
surfaces 
the 
circle 
establishes 
a kind 
of 
infinite 
finiteness, 
and 
there 
is 
regularity 
[i. 
e. 
symmetry? 
] 
in 
what 
may 
be 
inscribed 
in 
a circle" 
(letter 
130,1.343, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
30). 
This 
passage 
does 
not 
really 
amount 
to 
an 
explanation 
or 
even 
an argument 
in 
favour 
of 
certain 
ideas, 
it 
is 
no more 
than 
a series 
of 
assertions 
addressed 
to 
a like-minded 
reader. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
the 
paragraph 
that 
follows, 
in 
which 
Kepler 
states 
which 
polygons 
he will 
need 
to 
exclude, 
and 
gives 
grounds 
for 
excluding 
them, 
such 
as 
that, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
decagon 
and 
the 
pentagon, 
the 
square 
of 
the 
side 
is 
not 
commensurable 
with 
the 
square 
of 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle 
(letter 
130,1.352 
et 
seqq, 
KGW 14, p. 
30). 
However, 
he found 
he could 
not 
construct 
a satisfactory 
scheme 
by 
this 
method, 
so 
he looked 
at 
the 
sizes 
of 
the 
angles 
of 
the 
regular 
polygons 
concerned, 
thinking 
that 
he might 
be able 
to 
exclude 
all 
the 
figures 
in 
which 
three 
vertical 
angles 
came 
to 
more 
than 
four 
right 
angles 
"though 
it 
is 
not 
clear 
why 
Nature 
should 
take 
special 
account 
of 
this 
property 
in 
setting 
up 
ratios" 
(letter 
130,11.397-402, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
31). 
This 
idea 
naturally 
led 
to 
tessellations, 
since 
if 
polygons 
are 
to 
form 
a tessellation 
the 
angles 
which 
meet 
at 
each 
of 
its 
vertices 
must 
add 
up 
to 
exactly 
four 
right 
angles 
(letter 
130,1.419 
et 
seqq, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
32). 
The 
work 
on 
tessellations, 
which 
was 
eventually 
to 
find 
its 
appli- 
cation 
in 
connection 
with 
astrological 
Aspects 
in 

208 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV 
(see 
below), 
thus 
makes 
its 
first 
appearance 
as a possible 
explanation 
for 
musical 
ratios. 
In 
fact, 
the 
next 
section 
of 
this 
letter 
turns 
to 
Aspects, 
the 
problem 
being, 
as Kepler 
sees 
it, 
to 
explain 
why, 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
Aspects, 
Astronomy 
admits 
fewer 
ratios 
(between 
arcs 
of 
the 
Zodiac) 
than 
are 
admitted 
(between 
lengths 
of 
strings) 
in 
Music 
(letter 
130,11.573-6, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
37). 
As in 
the 
previous 
section 
of 
the 
letter, 
all 
the 
suggested 
explanations 
are 
derived 
from 
Geometry. 
In 
two 
other 
letters 
written 
in 
the 
summer 
of 
1599, 
Kepler 
gave 
similar, 
but 
rather 
more 
cursory, 
accounts 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
Aspects 
and 
musical 
ratios 
to 
Edmund 
Bruce 
(18 
July 
1599, 
letter 
128, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
7) 
and 
to 
Maestlin 
(19 
Aug. 
1599, 
letter 
132, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
143). 
Between 
them, 
these 
two 
letters 
to 
Herwart 
contain 
all 
the 
elements 
which 
were 
to 
be reassembled 
to 
form 
the 
geometrical 
explanations 
of 
musical 
consonances 
and 
astrological 
Aspects 
nearly 
twenty 
years 
later 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Books 
III 
and 
IV, 
where 
musical 
ratios 
are 
derived 
from 
those 
polygons 
whose 
sides 
are 
most 
closely 
related 
to 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle 
in 
which 
they 
are 
inscribed, 
while 
the 
astrological 
ratios 
are 
derived 
from 
those 
polygons 
which 
will 
fit 
together 
to 
form 
tessellations 
or 
polyhedra. 
The 
traditional 
explanation 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
musical 
ratios 
appealed 
to 
the 
alleged 
special 
nature 
of 
the 
first 
few 
integers; 
how many 
integers 
were 
involved 

209 
depended 
upon 
the 
system 
of 
ratios 
that 
had 
to 
be 
explained: 
'Pythagorean' 
intonation 
or 
'just' 
intonation. 
Pythagorean 
intonation 
was 
derived 
from 
ratios 
between 
the 
integers 
1 to 
4. 
To obtain 
an 
interval 
of 
a fourth, 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
lengths 
of 
the 
strings 
had 
to 
be 3: 4, 
for 
a fifth 
2: 3 and 
for 
an octave 
1: 2. 
Fitting 
in 
equal 
tones 
between 
the 
first 
note 
and 
these 
three 
fixed 
points 
gave 
dissonant 
thirds 
and 
sixths, 
cor- 
responding 
to 
the 
ratios 
64: 81 and 
16: 27. 
This 
Pythagorean 
system 
was 
under 
serious 
attack 
by 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
sixteenth 
century, 
since 
consonant 
thirds 
and 
sixths 
were 
a necessity 
for 
the 
polyphonic 
music 
which 
was 
being 
written 
by 
composers 
such 
as 
Orlando 
di 
Lasso 
(1531-1594). 
However, 
the 
old 
system 
found 
a vigorous 
defender 
in 
Vincenzo 
Galilei, 
whose 
Dialogo 
della 
musica 
antica 
et 
della 
moderna 
(Florence, 
1581) 
Kepler 
apparently 
read 
with 
enjoyment, 
for 
its 
detailed 
account 
of 
ancient 
theories 
and 
for 
the 
author's 
polemical 
skill, 
while 
disagreeing 
with 
its 
fundamental 
thesis1. 
The 
system 
of 
'just' 
intonation 
was 
codified 
by Giose- 
ffo 
Zarlino 
in 
his 
Institutioni 
Harmonichi 
(Venice, 
1558). 
It 
accepts 
thirds 
and 
sixths 
as 
consonances, 
corresponding 
to 
ratios 
of 
string 
lengths 
of 
4: 5 and 
5: 6 for 
the 
major 
and minor 
thirds, 
and 3: 4 and 5: 8 
1. 
Kepler

Wacker 
von 
Wackenfels, 
early 
1618,

783,11.22-3,

p. 
254. 

210 
for 
the 
major 
and minor 
sixths, 
while 
the 
fourth, 
fifth 
and 
octave 
are 
the 
same 
as 
in 
the 
Pythagorean 
system. 
Kepler 
accepted 
the 
'just' 
system, 
apparently 
on the 
grounds 
that 
observation 
showed 
thirds 
and 
sixths 
to 
be consonant 
(see 
Walker, 
1967). 
Zarlino's 
system 
is 
substantially 
identical 
with 
that 
described 
by Ptolemy 
in 
his 
Harmonica 
and 
Kepler 
usually 
refers 
to 
it 
as 
being 
Ptolemy's 
system, 
with 
the 
result 
that 
Zarlino's 
name only 
occurs 
once 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
III. 
Zarlino's 
system 
represented 
the 
musical 
orthodoxy 
of 
its 
day, 
but 
by 
the 
early 
years 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
it 
was 
no longer 
regarded 
as adequate 
by all 
practising 
musicians 
(see 
Palisca, 
1961). 
In 
response 
to 
an attack 
upon 
him 
for 
his 
use 
of 
dissonances, 
Claudio 
Monteverdi 
(1567-1643) 
appended 
a few 
lines 
of 
Italian 
prose 
to 
the 
fourteen 
pages 
of 
music 
for 
the 
basso 
continuo 
parts 
to 
his 
Fifth 
Book 
of 
Madrigals 
for 
Five 
Voices: 
"... 
I 
have 
written 
a reply 
to 
make 
it 
clear 
that 
I 
do not 
compose 
my works 
at 
random, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
is 
rewritten 
it 
will 
be published 
under 
the 
title 
Second 
System 
(Seconda 
Practica), 
or 
Perfection 
of 
Modern 
Music, 
at 
which 
perhaps 
some may be surprised, 
not 
believing 
that 
there 
is 
any 
other 
system 
than 
that 
described 
by Zarlino; 
but 
be assured 
that 
in 
connection 
with 
consonances 
and 
dissonances 
there 
is 
another 
explanation 
(consideratione), 
different 
from 
that 
already 
given, 
which, 
in 
accordance 
with 
reason 
and 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
senses, 
defends 
the 
modern 
style 
of 
i 

211 
composition... 
" 
(C. 
Monteverdi 
Basso 
continuo 
del 
quinto 
libro 
de le 
madrigali 
a cinque, 
Venice, 
1605, 
p. 
21). 
In 
fact, 
Monteverdi's 
promised 
work 
never 
appeared 
in 
print. 
Since 
Kepler 
accepted 
Zarlino's 
system, 
it 
comes 
as 
no 
surprise 
that 
his 
occasional 
references 
to 
musical 
compositions 
include 
three 
to 
works 
by 
Orlando 
di 
Lasso 
and 
none 
to 
works 
by Monteverdi. 
In 
the 
matter 
of 
Music 
Theory, 
Kepler 
was 
on 
the 
side 
of 
orthodoxy 
rather 
than 
standing 
up 
to 
be counted 
as 
a partisan 
of 
the 
avant 
garde. 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
III 
begins 
in 
the 
Aristotelian 
manner, 
with 
a historical 
introduction 
which 
defines 
the 
problem 
and 
then 
proceeds 
to 
demolish 
the 
theories 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
writer's 
predecessors. 
It 
is, 
of 
course, 
"the 
Pythagoreans" 
who 
are 
ostensibly 
in 
the 
firing 
line. 
However, 
their 
theories 
are 
taken 
to 
include 
the 
numerical 
series 
1,2,4,8 
and 
1,3,9,27 
used 
to 
describe 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
strips 
of 
the 
Same 
and 
Different 
which 
form 
the 
circles 
corresponding 
to 
the 
celestial 
equator 
and 
the 
ecliptic 
in 
the 
model 
of 
the 
heavens 
described 
in 
Timaeus 
(34b-36d), 
so Plato 
is 
clearly 
included 
in 
the 
company, 
though 
his 
name 
is 
not 
actually 
mentioned. 
There 
follows 
a discussion 
of 
the 
significance 
which 
the 
Pythagoreans 
attached 
to 
the 
"Tetractys" 
i. e. 
the 
integers 
1 to 
4. 
Kepler 
includes 
a long 
quotation 
from 
Camerarius' 
commentary 
on the 
Carmina 
Aurea 
(Camerarius 

212 
Libellus 
Scholasticus, 
Basel, 
1551, 
pp. 
205-8). 
The 
margins 
of 
the 
quotation 
are 
strewn 
with 
triangular, 
square 
and 
oblong 
arrays 
whose 
principal 
element 
is 
the 
figure 
1. 
Having 
quoted 
Camerarius' 
opinion 
of 
"the 
ancients" 
Kepler 
next 
turns 
to 
the 
number 
philosophy 
of 
Hermes 
Trismegistus, 
11 (whoever 
he may 
have 
been)", 
as 
expounded 
in 
Pimander, 
which 
he judges 
to 
be very 
close 
to 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
Pythagoreans. 
Adapting 
Aristotle's 
comment 
on a passage 
in 
Plato's 
Republic, 
Kepler 
notes 
"there 
is 
no doubt 
that 
either 
Pythagoras 
is 
Hermetising 
or 
Hermes 
is 
Pythagorising" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
99,11.1-2). 
In 
Giordano 
Bruno 
and 
the 
Hermetic 
Tradition 
Yates 
quotes 
the 
passage 
concerning 
Hermes, 
in 
extenso 
and 
in 
Latin,, 
commenting 
that 
it 
does 
not 
allow 
one 
to 
decide 
whether 
or 
not 
Kepler 
knew 
of 
Isaac 
Casaubon's 
re-dating 
of 
Hermes 
(Yates, 
1964, 
p. 
442 - Casaubon's 
work 
was 
published 
in 
London 
in 
1614). 
To me, 
the 
fact 
that 
Kepler 
(1) 
discusses 
Hermes 
after 
"the 
Pythagoreans", 
(2) 
draws 
attention 
to 
the 
parallels 
with 
the 
Old 
Testament 
("Moses") 
and 
St 
John's 
Gospel 
(parallels 
which 
were 
the 
subject 
of 
comment 
by Casaubon, 
see 
Yates, 
1964) 
and 
(3) 
explicitly 
mentions 
that 
Hermes 
may be "pythagorising", 
all 
these 
suggest 
that 
Kepler 
may at 
least 
have 
heard 
that 
doubt 
had 
been 
cast 
upon 
the 
very 
ancient 
date 
usually 
as- 
cribed 
to 
the 
Hermetic 
Corpus. 
They 
also 
suggest, 
to 
me, 
that 
he did 
not 
consider 
such 
doubts 
entirely 
unreasonable. 
This 
one 
page 
concerning 
Pimander 

213 
appears 
to 
be the 
only 
reference 
to 
Hermes 
in 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi, 
except 
in 
connection 
with 
Kepler's 
repeated 
assertions 
that 
his 
own mathematics 
is 
quite 
unlike 
the 
Hermetic 
mathematics 
of 
Fludd. 
Since 
Yates 
- 
regards 
the 
summary 
of 
Pimander 
as 
evidence 
that 
Kepler 
had 
studied 
the 
work 
with 
care 
(Yates, 
1964, 
p. 
444), 
we may presumably 
accept 
it 
as 
a fair 
account 
of 
Hermes' 
opinions, 
though 
it 
is 
given 
only 
as 
a prelude 
to 
pointing 
out 
that 
Kepler 
disagrees 
with 
them. 
Returning 
to 
the 
particular 
problem 
of 
musical 
ratios, 
Kepler 
first 
criticises 
the 
Pythagoreans 
for 
relying 
solely 
on the 
properties 
of 
numbers 
to 
decide 
the 
matter: 
"The 
Pythagoreans 
were 
so 
committed 
to 
this 
philosophy 
through 
Numbers 
that 
they 
paid 
no attention 
to 
the 
judgement 
of 
their 
ears, 
though 
their 
ears 
had 
provided 
the 
original 
basis 
for 
this 
study. 
Instead 
they 
defined 
what 
was 
harmonious 
and 
inharmonious, 
what 
was 
consonant 
and 
dissonant, 
solely 
by 
means 
of 
their 
Numbers, 
doing 
violence 
to 
the 
natural 
faculty 
of 
hearing" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
99,11.12-17). 
Ptolemy's 
modificat- 
ion 
of 
the 
Pythagorean 
system 
admitted 
ratios 
involving 
integers 
greater 
than 
four, 
but 
did 
not 
consider 
that 
major 
and 
minor 
thirds 
and 
sixths 
should 
be regarded 
as 
consonances, 
"[intervals] 
which 
all 
modern 
musicians 
who have 
a good 
ear 
assert 
to 
be consonances" 
(HM III, 
p. 
8, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
99,1.35). 
Kepler's 
first 
objection 
against 
the 
traditional 
systems 
is 
thus 
an empirical 
one: 
that 
they 
are 
not 
in 
agreement 
with 
observation. 

214 
8 
(As 
Walker 
(1967,197) 
has 
noted, 
Kepler's 
musical 
work 
repeatedly 
makes 
such 
appeals 
to 
the 
results 
of 
observation 
and 
lays 
great 
stress 
upon 
their 
importance 
in 
providing 
a proper 
basis 
for 
musical 
theory. 
) 
However, 
the 
next 
objection 
is 
philosophical: 
that 
the 
systems 
are 
deduced 
from 
the 
properties 
of 
pure 
numbers. 
"Further, 
if 
they 
were 
completely 
equal 
in 
scope, 
the 
cause 
taken 
from 
abstract 
Numbers 
and 
the 
effect 
of 
Consonance, 
it 
would 
not 
be absurd 
to 
see 
this 
cause 
as archetypal, 
evidence 
that 
the 
Father 
of 
creation, 
Eternal 
mind, 
contemplating 
the 
Numbers, 
had 
taken 
from 
them 
the 
Idea 
of 
tones 
and 
intervals... 
However, 
it 
is 
not 
yet 
sufficiently 
clear 
why 
the 
numbers 
1,2,3,14,5,6 
etc 
give 
rise 
to 
Musical 
intervals, 
while 
the 
numbers 
7,11,13 
and 
the 
like 
do not 
give 
rise 
to 
them. 
Nor 
do the 
numbers, 
as numbers, 
show 
by 
themselves 
why 
this 
should 
be so" 
(HM III, 
p. 
8, KGW 6, 
p. 
100,11.3-11). 
Kepler's 
objection 
is 
thus 
not 
against 
the 
use 
of 
numbers 
as 
an archetypal 
cause 
but 
against 
the 
inadequacy 
of 
the 
particular 
numerological 
theory 
that 
has 
been 
advanced 
to 
account 
for 
musical 
consonances. 
It 
even 
appears 
from 
his 
next 
sentence 
that 
he might 
have 
been 
prepared 
to 
accept 
something 
like 
the 
two 
series 
of 
numbers 
put 
forward 
in 
Timaeus, 
if 
such 
a theory 
had 
been 
able 
to 
account 
for 
the 
observed 
consonances: 
"For 
the 
cause 
deduced 
from 
the 
first 
three 
numbers, 
and 
the 
family 
of 
squares 
and 
cubes 
derived 
from 
them, 
is 
not 
a cause 
(causa 
est 
nulla); 

215 
since 
it 
excludes 
the 
number 
five, 
which, 
arising 
as 
it 
does 
among 
the 
musical 
intervals, 
cannot 
be deprived 
of 
its 
right 
of 
citizenship" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
100,11.11-13). 
He has, 
however, 
a further, 
more 
radical, 
objection 
to 
numerological 
theories 
of 
consonance: 
"But 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
for 
the 
theoretician 
to 
know 
that 
the 
Numbers 
1,2 
and 
3 are 
symbols 
of 
the 
Principles 
which 
make 
up 
Natural 
things. 
For 
an 
interval 
is 
not 
a natural 
thing, 
but 
a Geometrical 
one.; 
so unless 
these 
numbers 
were 
to 
number 
something 
else, 
more 
closely 
related 
to 
intervals, 
a philosopher 
could 
not 
put 
his 
faith 
in 
this 
cause, 
but 
would 
suspect 
it 
of 
not 
being 
a cause" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
100,11.15-20). 
Experiments 
carried 
out 
later 
in 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
were 
to 
show 
that 
there 
was, 
in 
fact, 
a physical 
basis 
for 
associating 
small 
integers 
with 
consonances: 
the 
integers 
re- 
presented 
multiples 
of 
wavelengths 
in 
the 
vibration 
of 
a string 
(Palisca, 
1961) 
- 
and 
it 
so 
happens 
that 
the 
human 
ear 
hears 
a combination 
of 
notes 
as 
pleasant, 
"consonant", 
if 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
wavelengths 
involved 
are 
expressible 
in 
terms 
of 
small 
numbers, 
such 
as 
1: 2 
and 
as unpleasant, 
"dissonant", 
if 
the 
ratios 
involve 
larger 
numbers, 
such 
as 
17: 23. 
This 
fact 
is 
believed 
to 
be connected 
with 
the 
length 
of 
time 
between 
"beats" 
in 
the 
compounded 
wave-. --In 
1618, 
however, 
Kepler's 
objection 
was 
still 
an entirely 
valid 
one, 
as 
it 
had 
been 
twenty 
years 
previously, 
when, 
according 
to 
his 
own account, 
he first 
began 
to 
think 
about 
the 
problem 

216 
(HM III, 
p. 
8, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
100,1.21 
et 
seqq). 
It 
is 
curious 
that 
Kepler 
should 
date 
his 
interest 
in 
this 
aspect 
of 
musical 
theory 
only 
to 
1598, 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
since, 
as 
we have 
seen, 
Chapter 
XII 
of 
that 
work 
began 
by tracing 
a connection 
between 
meridian 
sections 
of 
the 
regular 
polyhedra 
and 
Aspects, 
then 
used 
musical 
consonances 
by way of 
analogy 
and 
attempted 
to 
relate 
the 
generalised 
"harmonies" 
back 
to 
the 
polyhedra. 
Presumably 
Kepler 
regarded 
this 
work 
as a stage 
in 
the 
development 
of 
his 
explanation 
of 
Aspects, 
which 
was the 
main 
subject 
of 
the 
chapter, 
rather 
than 
the 
beginnings 
of 
a geometrical 
explanation 
of 
musical 
harmonies. 
The 
justification 
for 
turning 
to 
Geometry 
to 
explain 
consonances 
and 
musical 
ratios 
is 
stated 
quite 
briefly: 
"For 
since 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
ratios 
which 
correspond 
to 
consonant 
intervals 
are 
continuous 
quantities, 
the 
causes 
which 
separate 
consonances 
from 
dissonances 
must 
also 
be sought 
among 
the 
family 
of 
continuous 
quantities, 
not 
among 
abstract 
Numbers, 
since 
they 
are 
discrete 
quantities" 
(HM III, 
p. 
9, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
100,11.30-33). 
(As 
far 
as 
I know, 
Kepler 
always 
uses 
"numerus", 
the 
word 
I have 
translated 
as 
"number", 
in 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
he 
is 
clearly 
using 
it 
here, 
namely 
as 
a translation 
of 
Euclid's 
äet 
61"o3 
, to 
mean 
a 
e 
integer. 
Like 
Euclid, 
he uses 
Geometry 
to 
handle 
continuous 
quantities, 
though, 
as we have 
seen, 
he was 
prepared 
to 
try 
the 
new 
technique 
of 
Algebra 
when 
the 
problem 
of 
inscribing 

217 
a regular 
heptagon 
in 
a circle 
proved 
to 
be 
insoluble 
by 
means 
of 
Geometry 
(HM I, 
sect. 
XLV, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
50). 
) 
Having 
justified 
his 
use 
of 
Geometry 
rather 
than 
Arithmetic, 
Kepler 
turns 
to 
the 
reason 
why 
geometrical 
knowledge, 
as described 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I, 
should 
decide 
which 
ratios 
give 
rise 
to 
consonances: 
"And 
since 
it 
was Mind 
which 
so 
formed 
human 
Souls 
that 
they 
should 
take 
pleasure 
in 
some 
particular 
interval 
(which 
is 
the 
true 
definition 
of 
consonance 
and 
dis- 
sonance), 
both 
the 
differences 
between 
one 
interval 
and 
another 
and 
the 
causes 
which 
make 
these 
intervals 
harmonic, 
must 
be mental 
and 
intellectual 
in 
nature, 
their 
nature 
doubtless 
being 
such 
that 
the 
terms 
which 
make 
consonant 
intervals 
are 
knowable 
by 
proper 
demon- 
stration, 
and 
the 
terms 
of 
dissonances 
either 
knowable, 
but 
not 
by 
proper 
demonstration, 
or 
not 
knowable. 
For 
if 
they 
are 
knowable 
they 
can 
thus 
enter 
into 
the 
Mind 
and 
take 
part 
in 
constructing 
the 
archetype, 
but 
if, 
however, 
they 
are 
unknowable 
(in 
the 
sense 
that 
was 
explained 
in 
Book 
I) 
they 
will 
thus 
remain 
outside 
the 
Mind 
of 
the 
eternal 
Artificer 
and 
in 
no way 
contribute 
to 
the 
Archetype" 
(HM III, 
p. 
9, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
100,1.33 
to 
p. 
101,1.3). 
Whether 
a figure 
is 
knowable, 
that 
is, 
whether 
it 
can 
be inscribed 
in 
a circle 
by means 
of 
a 
straight 
edge 
and 
compasses, 
is 
thus 
taken 
to 
be a 
fundamental 
property 
of 
the 
figure, 
determining 
whether 
it 
can 
contribute 
to 
the 
archetype 
according 
to 
which 
the 
World 
is 
created. 
As I mentioned 
in 
my discussion 

218 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I, 
Kepler 
regarded 
the 
property 
of 
being 
knowable 
as a criterion 
of 
nobility, 
indicating 
the 
closeness 
of 
a figure's 
relation 
to 
the 
circle, 
and 
thus 
its 
fitness 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
archetype, 
but 
when 
he restates 
the 
condition 
in 
the 
form 
I have 
just 
quoted 
it 
is 
rather 
difficult 
to 
convince 
oneself 
that 
he 
is 
not 
putting 
arbitrary 
limits 
to 
God's 
powers 
by 
restricting 
Him 
to 
using 
only 
a straight 
edge 
and 
compasses. 
Presumably 
this 
restriction 
seemed 
less 
arbitrary 
when 
there 
really 
was 
no accurate 
method 
of 
constructing 
a regular 
heptagon, 
and 
when 
Algebra 
had 
not 
yet 
advanced 
to 
the 
point 
where 
obtaining 
an equation 
whose 
solution 
is 
the 
side 
of 
the 
polygon 
seems 
at 
least 
as valid 
a way of 
knowing 
the 
answer 
as does 
constructing 
the 
polygon 
in 
a circle. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
great 
gulf 
between 
knowable 
and 
unknowable 
polygons 
seems 
to 
have 
appeared 
real 
enough 
to 
Kepler. 
He therefore 
sets 
about 
applying 
the 
hierarchy 
of 
polygons, 
obtained 
in 
Book 
I, 
to 
the 
task 
of 
characterising 
ratios 
of 
integers 
as 
corresponding 
either 
to 
consonances 
or 
to 
dissonances, 
taking 
the 
relations 
of 
knowability 
to 
consonance 
as 
axioms. 
For 
example, 
" Axiom I 
The 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle, 
and 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
basic 
figures 
described 
in 
Book 
I which 
have 
a 
proper 
demonstration, 
determine 
a part 
of 
the 
circle 
which 
is 
consonant 
with 
the 
whole 
circle" 
(HM III, 
Ch. 
I, 
Axiom 
I, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
102); 
and 

219 
"Axiom 
II 
By whatever 
degree 
the 
demonstration 
of 
the 
side 
differs 
from 
the 
first 
degree, 
the 
part 
of 
the 
circle 
cut 
off 
by 
the 
side 
will, 
in 
consonance 
with 
the 
whole 
circle, 
differ 
from 
the 
most 
perfect 
consonance, 
unison, 
by 
the 
same 
degree. 
Or, 
as 
is 
the 
place 
of 
the 
figure, 
whose 
side 
is 
in 
question, 
among 
the 
other 
figures, 
so 
is 
the 
place 
of 
its 
consonance 
among 
the 
other 
consonances" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
103). 
Axioms 
III 
and IV are 
also 
of 
this 
type, 
but 
the 
final 
three 
axioms, 
numbers 
V, 
VI 
and 
VII, 
are 
concerned 
with 
consonances 
as 
such 
rather 
than 
with 
regular 
polygons. 
After 
the 
axioms, 
there 
is 
a passage 
of 
philosophical 
comment, 
rather 
like 
the 
passage 
which 
followed 
the 
mathematical 
description 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II, 
section 
XXV (KGW 6, 
p. 
80). 
It 
begins 
"To 
contemplate 
these 
Axioms, 
particularly 
the 
first 
five, 
is 
sublime 
and 
Platonic 
and 
resembles 
Christian 
Faith 
concerning 
Metaphysics 
and 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Soul. 
For 
Geometry, 
whose 
relevant 
parts 
have 
been 
dealt 
with 
in 
the 
first 
two 
Books, 
Geometry, 
coeternal 
with 
God and 
shining 
in 
the 
divine 
Mind, 
gave 
God the 
pattern, 
as 
explained 
in 
the 
introductory 
section 
of 
this 
Book, 
by which 
He laid 
out 
the 
World 
so 
that 
it 
might 
be Best 
and 
Most 
Beautiful, 
and 
finally 
most 

220 
like 
the 
Creator" 
(HM III, 
Ch. 
I, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
104' 
1.35 
to 
p. 
105,1.3). 
The 
references, 
nestling 
somewhat 
incongruously 
among 
the 
rhetorical 
phrases, 
serve 
as a reminder 
that 
this 
statement 
of 
faith 
is, 
in 
fact, 
the 
preamble 
to 
a 
philosophical 
discussion 
of 
the 
place 
of 
harmonies 
in 
the 
scheme 
of 
things, 
after 
which 
Kepler 
turns 
to 
the 
main 
subject 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
III 
Chapters 
I and 
II, 
namely 
the 
deduction 
of 
musical 
ratios. 
This 
deduction 
first 
takes 
the 
form 
of 
a series 
of 
propositions 
relating 
the 
ratios 
of 
different 
arcs 
of' 
a circle 
one 
to 
another, 
and 
Chapter 
I 
ends 
with 
a 
table 
showing 
consonances 
and 
dissonances 
between 
the 
whole 
circle 
and 
parts 
of 
the 
circle 
out 
off 
by the 
inscription 
of 
a diameter 
or 
a regular 
polygon 
with 
3,4,5,6,8,10,12,16,20 
or 
24 sides. 
Kepler 
considers 
both 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
are 
subtended 
by 
a given 
number 
of 
sides 
and 
the 
whole 
circle, 
and 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
remaining 
arc 
and 
the 
whole 
circle 
(HM III, 
Ch. 
I, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
113). 
Musical 
notation 
makes 
its 
first 
appearance 
in 
Chapter 
II, 
and 
from 
that 
point 
the 
propositions 
take 
an explicitly 
musical 
form. 
For 
example, 
the 
third 
proposition 
of 
the 
chapter 
reads 
"Proposition 
XI 
Dividing 
a string 
into 
two 
parts, 
in 
triple 
pro- 
portion 
to 
one 
another, 
gives 
a harmonic 
ratio" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
115; 
the 
numbering 
of 
propositions 
is 
consecutive 
throughout 
Book 
ITI). 
The 
accompanying 

1 
221 
diagrams 
show 
the 
division 
of 
straight 
lines, 
hot 
circles, 
but 
the 
proofs 
appeal 
to 
the 
propositions 
which 
were 
summarised 
in 
the 
table 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Chapter 
I 
and 
to 
the 
propositions 
concerning 
regular 
- polygons 
inscribed 
in 
a circle, 
which 
were 
proved 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I. 
The 
final 
proposition 
of 
Chapter 
II, 
Proposition 
XIX, 
is 
that 
"After 
that 
defined 
by 
the 
octagon 
there 
are 
no more 
Harmonic 
divisions 
of 
a string" 
(HM III, 
Ch. 
II, 
Prop. 
XIX, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
118). 
From 
this 
proposition, 
proved 
by 
appealing 
to 
the 
indemonstrability 
of 
figures 
with 
more 
than 
eight 
sides, 
and 
ruling 
out 
the 
pentekaede- 
cagon 
because 
it 
has 
only 
an 
improper 
demonstration 
(see 
HM I, 
sect. 
XLIV, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
46), 
Kepler 
proceeds 
to 
draw 
the 
corollary 
that 
"there 
are 
seven 
harmonic 
divisions 
of 
a string, 
not 
more" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
118,1.30), 
these 
seven 
corresponding 
to 
the 
ratios 
required 
by 
'just' 
intonation, 
the 
Ptolemy-Zarlino 
system, 
including 
4: 5 and 
5: 6 for 
the 
major 
and 
minor 
thirds 
and 
3: 5 and 
5: 8 for 
the 
major 
and 
minor 
sixths. 
Kepler 
has 
no difficulty 
in 
explaining 
the 
ratios 
corresponding 
to 
the 
old 
Pythagorean 
consonances, 
namely 
the 
ratios 
1: 2,2: 
3,3: 
4. 
These 
clearly 
correspond 
to 
divisions 
of 
the 
circle 
by 
the 
diameter 
(for 
1: 2), 
the 
equilateral 
triangle 
(for 
2: 3) and the 
square 
(for 
3: 4), 
figures 
which 
are 
demonstrable 
and have 
sides 
which 
are 
commensurable, 
or 
commensurable 
in 
square, 
with 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle. 

222 
The 
four 
extra 
consonances 
required 
by 
'just' 
intonation 
present 
slightly 
more 
of 
a problem, 
since 
they 
involve 
a ratio 
that 
can 
only 
be produced 
by 
means 
of 
the 
pentagon, 
namely 
4: 5 (Kepler 
cannot 
use 
an enneagon 
for 
this 
ratio 
because 
the 
enneagon 
is 
not 
demonstratable). 
Kepler 
argues 
for 
the 
consonance- 
forming 
power 
of 
the 
pentagon 
on the 
grounds 
that 
the 
incommensurability 
between 
its 
side 
and 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle 
involves 
the 
Golden 
Section, 
the 
Divine 
Proportion. 
He makes 
this 
point 
briefly 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
63,1.36 
to 
p. 
64,1.2) 
and argues 
it 
in more detail, 
connecting 
the 
Divine 
proportion 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
generation, 
in 
Book 
III, 
Ch. 
XV (KGW 6, 
p. 
175,1.17 
et 
segq). 
1 
The 
pentagon 
gives 
the 
ratios 
4: 5 and 
3: 5 (the 
latter 
can 
also 
be obtained 
from 
the 
octagon). 
The 
ratios 
corresponding 
to 
the 
other 
two 
'just' 
consonances, 
5: 6 
and 
5: 8, 
present 
little 
difficulty. 
They 
can 
be derived 
from 
the 
hexagon 
and 
the 
octagon, 
figures 
which 
are 
closely 
related 
to 
the 
equilateral 
triangle 
and 
the 
square 
(since 
their 
sides 
can 
be obtained 
by 
bisecting 
the 
arcs 
cut 
off 
by 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
latter 
figures) 
and 
therefore 
share 
their 
power 
of 
determining 
con- 
sonances. 
Having 
achieved 
this 
geometrical 
explanation 
of 
the 
consonances, 
Kepler 
rather 
disconcertingly 
goes 
on to 
1. 
This 
latter 
passage 
has 
been 
discussed 
very 
fully 
by Walker, 
1967, 
p. 
242 
et 
seqq. 

223 
present 
them 
in 
a form 
which 
emphasises 
arithmetical 
relations 
between 
them. 
He shows 
that 
the 
ratios 
can 
be obtained 
by 
the 
following 
process: 
Starting 
with 
1/1 
one 
adds 
numerator 
and 
denominator 
to 
obtain 
a new 
denominator, 
namely 
2, 
and 
then 
uses 
the 
old 
numerator 
and 
denominator 
as 
two 
new numerators, 
giving 
3 and 
J. 
Operating 
on 3 in 
the 
same way 
gives 
and 
J, 
and 
these 
fractions 
in 
their 
turn 
generate 
4, 
and 
2/5,3/5. 
The 
process 
can 
be continued 
until 
one 
obtains 
a 
denominator 
which 
is 
the 
number 
of 
sides 
of 
an 
indemon- 
strable 
polygon. 
A little 
table 
of 
these 
"harmonic" 
fractions 
and 
an explanation 
of 
this 
arithmetical 
method 
of 
obtaining 
them 
forms 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
corollary 
to 
Proposition 
XIX. 
Armed with 
his 
consonances, 
Kepler 
would 
appear 
to 
be 
free 
to 
move 
on to 
Music 
Theory 
proper, 
but 
he 
first 
includes 
a chapter 
on what 
was 
(and 
is) 
usually 
meant 
by 
"harmonic" 
proportion, 
namely 
that 
if 
the 
number 
b is 
the 
harmonic 
mean 
of 
a and 
c then 
b-2 
(1 
1 
cý' 
(Kepler, 
of 
course, 
does 
not 
use 
the 
algebraic 
form- 
ulation. 
) 
He has 
no difficulty 
in 
showing 
that 
this 
method 
of 
division 
will 
lead 
to 
dissonant 
ratios, 
and 
he accordingly 
rejects 
it. 
Unfortunately, 
as 
Walker 
notes, 
this 
form 
of 
harmonic 
division 
is 
a direct 
indicator 
of 
the 
physical 
cause 
of 
consonance 
(Walker, 
1967, 
pp. 
240,241). 
The 
reason 
for 
Kepler's 
rejection 
of 
what 
is 
now seen 
as 
a revealing 
formulation 
lies 
in 

224 
his 
philosophical 
assumptions: 
that 
consonances, 
being 
beautiful, 
were 
the 
significant 
elements 
in 
Music, 
revealing 
the 
beautiful 
Archetype 
according 
to 
which 
God had 
created 
both 
the 
World 
and 
the 
correspondingly 
sensitive 
human 
Soul. 
About 
a third 
of 
the 
way 
through 
this 
chapter 
on 
the 
harmonic 
mean, 
after 
the 
first 
paragraph 
of 
page 
29 
in 
the 
original 
edition 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
121,1.11), 
the 
printer 
inadvertently 
left 
out 
some pages, 
according 
to 
the 
account 
of 
the 
matter 
at 
the 
top 
of 
page 
86 (KGW 6, 
p. 
186,1.1). 
The material 
omitted 
is 
entitled 
"A 
political

types 
of 
mean". 
Since 
this 
digression 
is 
about 
seventeen 
pages 
long, 
the 
printer 
may well 
have 
felt 
he was doing 
Kepler's 
readers 
a good 
turn 
by 
transferring 
it 
to 
the 
end 
of 
Book 
III 
rather 
than 
putting 
it 
into 
a chapter 
whose 
length 
was 
otherwise 
about 
three 
pages. 
The "Political 
Digression" 
is 
based 
on the 
final 
chapter 
of 
a work 
by Jean 
Bodin, 
first 
published 
in 
French 
in 
1576. 
Kepler 
seems 
to 
have 
used 
the 
Latin 
edition 
of 
1586, 
entitled 
De Republica 
Libri 
VI 
(see 
Caspar's 
note, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
538). 
Bodin's 
title 
seems 
to 
echo 
Plato, 
but 
the 
work 
is 
in 
fact 
very 
different 
from 
Plato's 
Republic, 
being 
concerned 
with 
statecraft 
rather 
than 
the 
construction 
of 
a system 
which 
will 
illuminate 
the 
concept 
of 
justice. 
Bodin 
comes 
to 
this 
concept 
only 
in 
his 
very 
last 
chapter 
(La 
Republique, 
Paris, 
1576, 
Book 
VI, 
Ch. 
VI, 
pp. 
727-759) 
which 
begins: 
"It 

225 
remains 
to 
end 
this 
work 
by 
considering 
Justice, 
the 
main 
basis 
of 
any 
Republic, 
and 
of 
such 
importance 
that 
Plato 
even 
called 
his 
ten 
books 
on the 
Republic 
a treatise 
on Justice, 
though 
he wrote 
of 
it 
rather 
as 
a Philosopher 
than 
as 
a legislator 
or 
a lawyer. 
" 
Although 
the 
title 
of 
Bodin's 
chapter 
proclaims 
the 
author's 
intention 
of 
making 
use 
of 
arithmetic, 
geometric 
and 
harmonic 
means 
his 
use 
of 
mathematics 
is 
somewhat 
tentative, 
taking 
the 
form 
of 
a few 
numbers 
introduced 
here 
and 
there 
by 
way 
of 
illustration. 
Moreover, 
the 
mathematical 
basis 
of 
these 
illustrations 
is 
not 
a sound 
one: 
Bodin 
gives 
a vague 
definition 
of 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
a harmonic 
mean, 
but 
vague 
as 
it 
is, 
it 
will 
not 
cover 
the 
correct 
definition. 
Kepler 
quotes 
it 
with 
the 
comment 
"Now 
this 
definition 
is 
not 
correct" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
187,1.27) 
and 
then 
proceeds 
to 
explain 
why 
not, 
at 
length. 
Later, 
he discusses 
24 sections 
of 
Bodin's 
work 
in 
which 
the 
reasoning 
is 
vitiated 
by 
the 
use 
of 
this 
incorrect 
"harmonic" 
mean, 
making 
his 
own 
suggestions 
as 
to 
how they 
should 
be modified 
(KGW 6, 
pp. 
189-205). 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
Kepler, 
is 
thoroughly 
in 
favour 
of 
Bodin's 
approach. 
His 
professional 
disgust 
is 
directed 
only 
at 
the 
incorrect 
definition, 
not 
at 
the 
importation 
of 
the 
mathematical 
method 
of 
Timaeus 
into 
the 
territory 
of 
the 
Republic. 
(The 
Political 
Digression 
is 
discussed 
in 
some 
detail 
by 
Nitschke 
(1971)). 
The 
remainder 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
III, 
Chapters 
IV 
to 
XVI, 
is 
concerned 
with 
Music 
Theory 
proper. 

226 
Kepler. 
deals 
with 
such 
technical 
matters 
as the 
types 
of 
scale 
(Ch. 
IV) 
and 
the 
problem 
of 
tempering 
(Ch. 
VIII). 
In 
the 
course 
of 
the 
latter 
discussion 
he 
suggests 
a new way 
of 
tuning 
the 
strings 
of 
a lute, 
which, 
he claims, 
is 
better 
than 
the 
tuning 
proposed 
by Vincenzo 
Galilei 
(HM III, 
Ch. 
VIII, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
1L3). 
Caspar 
has 
shown 
that, 
over 
the 
years 
that 
had 
elapsed 
since 
Kepler 
had 
sketched 
out 
his 
first 
plan 
for 
a 
work 
on Universal 
Harmony, 
he had 
studied 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
musical 
theorists 
of 
his 
own day 
as well 
as 
the 
works 
of 
Euclid, 
Ptolemy, 
Boethius, 
Jordanus 
Nemorarius 
and 
Jacques 
Lefevre 
of 
Etaples 
(Caspar, 
1940, 
p. 
1477). 
It 
is 
therefore 
clear 
that 
Kepler 
intended 
his 
own work 
to 
be a serious 
contribution 
to 
musical 
theory, 
and 
historians 
have 
generally 
accepted 
it 
as 
such 
(see 
Walker 
(1967) 
for 
references). 
For 
my present 
purpose, 
however, 
the 
interest 
of 
Kepler's 
theory 
lies 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
its 
mathematical 
basis, 
and 
in 
its 
application 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
explaining 
the 
observed 
structure 
of 
the 
Solar 
system, 
which 
I 
shall 
consider 
in 
a later 
section 
of 
this 
chapter. 
Astrology: 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV 
As we have 
seen, 
Astrology 
does 
not 
play 
a very 
impor- 
tant 
part 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
and 
Kepler's 
later 
notes 
suggest 
that 
by 
1621 
he regarded 
two 
of 
the 
three 
brief 
astrological 
chapters 
as 
irrelevant 
to 
the 

227 
main 
purpose 
of 
the 
book. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
Astrology 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV 
is 
not 
only 
much 
more 
mathematically 
sophisticated 
than 
that 
in 
the 
earlier 
work, 
it 
is 
also 
clearly 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
Kepler's 
description 
of 
his 
scheme 
of 
universal 
harmonies, 
of 
which 
a slightly 
modified 
version 
of 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
is 
also 
a 
part. 
The 
Astrology 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV 
has 
much 
the 
same 
status 
as 
the 
Astronomy 
in 
Book 
V: 
the 
mathematical 
results 
obtained 
in 
the 
earlier 
part 
of 
the 
work 
are 
used 
to 
explain 
the 
existence 
of 
various 
Aspects 
in 
the 
same way 
as 
they 
are 
used 
to 
explain, 
for 
example, 
the 
eccentricities 
of 
planetary 
orbits. 
However, 
Kepler 
limits 
his 
astrological 
explanation 
to 
giving 
an a 
priori 
account 
of 
the 
number 
and 
relative 
power 
of 
Aspects, 
thus 
ignoring 
much 
of 
the 
traditional 
subject- 
I 
matter 
of 
Astrology. 
We know, 
of 
course, 
that 
Kepler 
rejected 
many of 
the 
standard 
astrological 
beliefs 
of 
his 
day, 
such 
as 
the 
belief 
that 
particular 
characters 
should 
be ascribed 
to 
individual 
signs 
of 
the 
Zodiac 
1. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
appears 
that 
when 
he was 
working 
on 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV 
Kepler 
considered 
it 
reasonable 
to 
ascribe 
a particular 
character. 
to 
each 
planet, 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
colour 
of 
the 
light 
it 
sends 
to 
the 
Earth 
(HM IV, 
Ch. VII, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
279,1.30 
et 
seqq); 
and in 
1.

Nova,

an 
Simon 
( 1975) 
. 
{ 

228 
1621, 
when 
he wrote 
the 
notes 
for 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
he described 
Chapter 
IX, 
which 
accounts 
for 
the 
astrological 
characters 
of 
the 
planets 
by reference 
to 
the 
corresponding 
regular 
polyhedra, 
merely 
as 
"a 
digression" 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
59), 
rather 
than 
dismissing 
it 
entirely, 
as he had 
dismissed 
other 
parts 
of 
his 
work 
(see 
Chapter 
IV 
above). 
It 
seems 
that 
Kepler 
had 
taken 
a sceptical 
attitude 
to 
traditional 
Astrology 
from 
quite 
early 
years. 
In 
March 
1598 
he wrote 
to 
Maestlin 
"... 
I 
am a Lutheran 
astrologer, 
I 
throw 
away 
the 
nonsense 
and 
keep 
the 
hard 
kernel" 
(Kepler 
to 
Maestlin, 
15 March 
1598, 
letter 
89, 
1.177, 
KGW 13, 
p. 
184). 
However, 
it 
appears 
that 
what 
seemed 
"nonsense" 
and 
what 
"hard 
kernel" 
did 
change 
over 
the 
years, 
so 
that, 
as Simon 
(1975) 
has 
shown, 
the 
Confessio 
Augustana 
of 
Kepler's 
alleged 
astrological 
Lutheranism 
was more a collection 
of 
principles 
- 
principles 
closely 
akin 
to 
those 
governing 
his 
astro- 
nomical 
beliefs 
- 
rather 
than 
a definite 
body 
of 
dogma. 
One of 
these 
principles 
was 
to 
demand 
that 
a theory 
should 
account 
for 
the 
observations, 
with 
an appropriate 
degree 
of 
precision: 
to 
5 minutes 
of 
arc 
for 
thert 
of 
Mars, 
rather 
roughly 
when 
it 
came 
to 
astrological 
predictions 
of 
the 
weather, 
since 
the 
weather 
was 
clearly 
dependant 
not 
only 
on the 
Aspects 
operating 
from 
the 
heavens 
but 
also 
on such 
things 
as 
the 
local 
dispo- 
sition 
of 
the 
Earth. 
As Kepler 
explained: 
11 ... 
the 
greatest 
variation 
[sc. 
in 
response 
to 

229 
Aspects] 
is 
in 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
bodies 
acted 
upon, 
particularly 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
Earth, 
which 
is 
different 
in 
different 
parts 
and 
at 
different 
times. 
For 
when, 
in 
Spring, 
humours 
are 
abundant 
in 
the 
Northern 
hemisphere, 
because 
the 
Sun 
is 
moving 
higher 
[i. 
e. 
the 
days 
are 
lengthening], 
as 
I 
explained 
above, 
then 
even 
the 
least 
powerful 
Aspect, 
of 
any 
planets, 
will 
excite 
such 
humours 
into 
activity 
and 
make 
them 
produce 
a quantity 
of 
vapour 
that 
will 
fall 
as 
showers" 
(De 
Fundamentis 
Astrologiae 
Certioribus, 
Prague, 
1602, 
Thesis 
XLIV, 
KGW 4, 
p. 
24,1.32-38). 
Furthermore, 
Kepler 
believed 
that 
the 
theory 
that 
the 
weather 
was affected 
by 
Aspects 
was 
amply 
confimed 
by 
observation. 
Indeed, 
he made 
many 
observations 
of 
the 
weather 
to 
check 
the 
theory. 
Some of 
these 
observations 
were 
published 
in 
Tertius 
Interveniens 
(Frankfurt, 
1610), 
where 
Kepler 
used 
them 
to 
prove, 
against 
Feselius, 
that 
a conjunction 
of 
Saturn 
and 
the 
Sun 
causes 
coldness 
in 
the 
weather: 
"In 
the 
year 
1592, 
on 9 July, 
New Style, 
[such 
a 
conjunction 
took 
place] 
in 
Cancer, 
when I had 
not 
yet 
begun 
to 
take 
note. 
But 
Chytraeus 
writes 
that 
the 
whole 
Summer, 
particularly 
at 
that 
special 
time, 
was 
cold 
and 
wintry. 
In 
1593,24 
July, 
in 
the 
first 
part 
of 
Leo. 
There 
was 
a great 
con- 
fusion 
of 
Aspects. 
For 
the 
Sun, 
Venus 
and 
Saturn 

230 
were 
in 
conjunction, 
Mars 
was 
at 
sextile 
to 
Jupiter 
and, 
further, 
Mercury 
was moving 
back 
from 
being 
at 
opposition 
to 
Jupiter 
to 
being 
at 
trine 
to 
Mars. 
On 20,21 
and 
22 July 
there 
was 
much 
rain 
and 
hail. 
The 
23rd 
was cloudy... 
" 
(Tertius 
Interveniens, 
Frankfurt, 
1610, 
CXXXIV, 
KGW 4, 
p. 
254). 
Kepler 
cites 
seventeen 
such 
correlations, 
giving 
varying 
quantities 
of 
detail, 
the 
last 
one 
dating 
from 
22 and 
23 January 
1609. 
Eleven 
of 
the 
correlations 
refer 
to 
the 
months 
from 
October 
to 
January, 
when 
one 
would 
naturally 
expect 
the 
weather 
to 
be cold, 
or, 
in 
Kepler's 
terms, 
when 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
Earth 
made 
it 
sus- 
ceptible 
to 
influences 
that 
would 
cause 
an increase 
in 
cold. 
It 
is 
perhaps 
unfair 
to 
use 
the 
word 
"correlation" 
in 
referring 
to 
Kepler's 
examples, 
since 
the 
word 
has 
statistical 
connotations, 
and 
Kepler 
was certainly 
not 
attempting 
any 
kind 
of 
statistical 
analysis 
of 
the 
connection 
between 
this 
particular 
Aspect 
and 
coldness 
in 
the 
weather. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
does 
not 
seem to 
me 
that 
it 
was his 
lack 
of 
statistical 
techniques 
that 
allowed 
him 
to 
be led 
astray. 
I 
think 
his 
problem 
was 
much 
simpler 
than 
that: 
there 
were 
many 
different 
Aspects 
and 
many 
different 
weather 
changes, 
so for 
any 
given 
change 
one 
could 
almost 
certainly 
find 
an approp- 
riate 
recent 
Aspect. 
This, 
at 
any 
rate, 
was my own 
experience 
when 
in 
1974 
and 
1975 
I 
attempted 
to 
find 
post 
factum 
astrological 
explanations 
for 
changes 
in 
the 
weather 
in 
London. 
If 
I 
remember 
correctly, 
the 
cold 

231 
spell 
in 
May 
1975 
coincided 
most 
gratifyingly 
with 
Saturn's 
being 
at 
Aspect 
to 
the 
Sun, 
and 
the 
very 
hot 
dry 
Summer 
that 
followed 
was 
clearly 
connected 
with 
Aspects 
between 
the 
Sun, 
Mars 
and 
Jupiter 
in 
June 
and 
July. 
(I 
was 
giving 
daily 
lectures 
in 
a planetarium 
at 
the 
time, 
so 
I 
was 
familiar 
with 
the 
positions 
of 
the 
planets. 
) 
Kepler 
believed 
that 
the 
influence 
of 
Aspects 
upon 
the 
weather 
was 
so 
strongly 
marked 
that 
one 
could 
hope 
to 
decide 
by 
observation 
whether 
a proposed 
new Aspect 
should 
be accepted 
or 
not. 
We have 
seen 
that 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Herwart 
in 
1599 
he apparently 
felt 
uneasy 
because 
his 
theory 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
consonances 
seemed 
to 
require 
that 
two 
planets 
separated 
by 
one 
fifth 
of 
the 
Zodiac 
should 
be considered 
to 
be at 
Aspect 
to 
one 
another 
(Kepler 
to 
Herwart, 
30 May 
1599, 
letter 
123, 
1.359-416, 
KGW 13, 
pp. 
349,350), 
but 
by 
the 
end 
of 
1601 
he was willing 
to 
propose 
three 
new Aspects, 
corres- 
ponding 
to 
separations 
of 
one 
fifth, 
two 
fifths 
and 
three 
eighths 
of 
the 
Zodiac, 
and 
appealed 
to 
observation 
in 
support 
of 
his 
proposal 
(De 
Fund. 
Ast. 
Cert., 
Prague, 
1602, 
Thesis 
XXXVIII, 
KGW 4, 
p. 
22). 
Similar 
obser- 
vational 
justification 
of 
unconventional 
Aspects 
is 
suggested 
in 
a letter 
to 
Brengger, 
written 
in 
1607 
(Kepler 
to 
Brengger, 
30 Nov. 
1607, 
letter 
463,1.36 
et 
seqq, 
KGW 16, 
p. 
85). 
However, 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
number 
of 
Aspects 
compared 
with 
the 
number 
of 
Consonances 
continued 
to 
worry 
Kepler 
(as 
he mentions 
in 
Tertius 
Interveniens, 
see 
below). 
The 
fact 
that 
he continued 

232 
to 
find 
a discrepancy 
between 
Consonances 
and 
Aspects 
may seem surprising 
in 
view 
of 
the 
ease 
with 
which 
he 
seems 
to 
have 
convinced 
himself 
of 
the 
efficacy 
of 
certain 
new Aspects, 
such 
as the 
one 
where 
planets 
were 
separated 
by 
one 
fifth 
of 
the 
Zodiac. 
One might 
have 
expected 
that 
observational 
confirmation 
of 
any 
putative 
Aspect 
would 
have 
been 
easy 
to 
come by. 
I 
think 
the 
explanation 
for 
Kepler's 
failure 
to 
find 
observational 
confirmations 
must 
be that, 
like 
many 
a 
modern 
astronomer 
or 
cosmologist, 
he was more 
easily 
persuadable 
on some 
points 
than 
on others. 
It 
appears 
that 
by 
1610 
he had 
already 
rejected 
the 
simple 
analogy 
between 
Aspects 
and 
Consonances 
which 
he had 
set 
out 
in 
his 
letter 
to 
Herwart 
in 
15991, 
for 
in 
Tertius 
Interveniens 
he remarks 
"So 
I 
finally 
acknowledged 
the 
difference 
between 
Music 
and 
Astrology, 
and 
then 
I wondered 
why, 
indeed, 
I 
should 
not 
particu- 
larly 
notice 
the 
sesquiquadrate 
[i. 
e. 
3/8], 
decile 
[1110] 
and 
tridecile 
[3/10] 
Aspects, 
and 
should 
take 
such 
emphatic 
notice 
of 
the 
semisextile 
[1/12], 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
why 
the 
octagon 
and 
decagon 
and 
the 
chord 
subtending 
three 
tenths 
should 
be so noble, 
and 
radically 
(schier) 
nobler 
than 
the 
dodecagon" 
(Tertius 
Interveniens, 
Frankfurt, 
1610, 
LIX, 
KGW 4, 
p. 
205, 
11.16-21). 
The 
formulation 
of 
the 
problem 
indicates 
the 
direction 
in 
which 
Kepler's 
thoughts 
were 
turning

in 
search 
of 
a solution, 
and 
his 
next 
sentence 
duly 
begins 
"So 
then 
I 
started 
to 
hunt 
through 
Geometry... 
". 
By the 
time 
Kepler 
came 
to 
write 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV 
his 
list 
of 
Aspects 
had 
been 
subject 
to 
minor 
adjustments, 
but 
it 
still 
included 
ratios 
which 
were 
not 
to 
be found 
among 
musical 
consonances, 
and 
it 
there- 
fore 
required 
an explanation 
in 
terms 
of 
a geometrical 
hierarchy 
slightly 
different 
from 
that 
used 
to 
explain 
the 
consonances. 
However, 
Kepler 
is 
careful 
to 
make 
it 
clear 
that 
Aspects, 
like 
Consonances, 
must 
be seen 
as 
"harmonies", 
and 
the 
first 
three 
chapters 
of 
Book 
IV 
are 
accordingly 
taken 
up with 
the 
problems 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
harmonies 
(in 
sensible 
and 
abstract 
entities), 
the 
soul's 
faculty 
for 
perceiving 
harmonies, 
and 
in 
what 
things 
harmonies 
may be perceived 
(by 
God or 
by Man). 
The 
fourth 
chapter 
deals 
with 
the 
distinctions 
to 
be made 
between 
the 
musical 
harmonies 
considered 
in 
the 
last 
book 
and 
the 
astrological 
ones 
to 
be considered 
in 
the 
present 
one. 
These 
distinctions 
are 
all 
physical, 
in 
the 
wide 
sense 
in 
which 
Kepler 
uses 
the 
word 
(see 
Chapter 
III 
above), 
and 
are 
summed up 
succinctly 
in 
the 
marginal 
notes: 
"The 
harmonies 
in 
this 
book 
are 
narrower" 
(i. 
e. 
they 
do not 
interact 
as musical 
harmonies 
do), 
"These 
harmonies 
concern 
angles", 
"In 
the 
form 
of 
arcs 
of 
the 
Zodiac", 
"They 
are 
not 
truly 
celestial", 
"but 
terrestrial" 
(i. 
e. 
perceived 
from 
the 
Earth, 
being 
angles 
made 
at 
the 
Earth), 
and 
so on 
(HM IV, Ch. IV KGW 6, 
pp. 
2349 
5). 
. 'Harmonies 
are 
perceived 
by 
the 
human 
soul, 
and 
since 
the 
Earth 
also 

234 
appears 
to 
respond 
to 
harmonies 
it 
seems 
to 
Kepler 
that 
the 
Earth 
too 
must 
have 
a soul 
(HM IV, 
Ch. 
IV, 
KGW 6, 
pp. 
236,7). 
He had made this 
same suggestion, 
on the 
same grounds, 
many years 
earlier, 
in 
De Fundamentis 
Astrologiae 
Certioribus 
(Prague, 
1602, 
Theses 
XL to 
XLIII, 
KGW 4, 
pp. 
23,4). 
The 
Earth's 
soul 
is 
discussed 
again, 
at 
considerable 
length, 
in 
the 
final 
chapter 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV, 
which 
is 
concerned 
with 
"sublunary 
nature 
and 
the 
soul's 
inferior 
faculties, 
particularly 
those 
on 
which 
Astrology 
depends" 
(HM IV, 
Ch. 
VII, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
26k). 
In 
this 
final 
chapter, 
Kepler 
explicitly 
acknowledges 
that 
the 
notion 
that 
the 
Earth 
has 
a soul 
is 
to 
be traced 
back 
to 
Timaeus 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
265,1.4 
et 
seqq), 
but 
he also 
makes 
it 
clear 
that 
his 
own theory 
takes 
account 
of 
the 
different 
types 
of 
soul 
described 
by Aristotle, 
and 
ascribes 
to 
the 
Earth 
no more 
than 
the 
humblest 
kind 
of 
soul, 
one 
capable 
only 
of 
recognising 
geometrical 
stimuli 
and 
responding 
to 
them. 
The 
Earth's 
soul 
is 
thus 
postulated 
to 
account 
for 
a particular 
group 
of 
related 
phenomena 
which 
cannot 
be accounted 
for 
in 
any 
other 
way. 
Kepler's 
geometrical 
explanation 
of 
Aspects 
is 
contain- 
ed in 
Harmoniees Mundi Book IV Ch. V. 
This 
chapter 
is 
set 
out 
in 
mathematical 
form, 
as a series 
of 
definitions, 
axioms 
and propositions, 
with 
a small 
amount 
of 
linking 
text, 
very 
much 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Books 
I 
and 
II. 
After 
defining 
what 
is 
meant 
by an astrological 
configu- 
ration, 
and 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
describing 
it 
as 
powerful 

235 
(efficax), 
Kepler 
proceeds 
to 
state 
two 
axioms, 
upon 
which, 
he tells 
us, 
the 
whole 
discussion 
will 
depend. 
They 
are: 
"Axiom 
I 
The 
arc 
of 
the 
Zodiac 
cut 
off 
by 
the 
side 
of 
a 
convex 
or 
star 
polygon 
which 
forms 
congruences 
and 
is 
knowable 
measures 
the 
angle 
of 
a powerful 
Configuration. 
Axiom 
II 
The 
angle 
of 
a convex 
or 
star 
polygon 
which 
forms 
congruences 
and is 
knowable 
is 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
angle 
of 
a powerful 
Configuration. 
" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
241) 
These 
two 
axioms 
resemble 
the 
axioms 
which 
related 
knowable 
polygons 
and 
consonances 
in 
Book 
III, 
Chapter 
I, 
the 
main 
difference 
being 
that 
the 
new 
axioms 
give 
not 
one 
but 
two 
forms 
of 
relationship 
between 
the 
physically- 
realised 
harmonies 
and 
their 
geometrical 
prototypes, 
through 
the 
are 
cut 
off 
by 
the 
side 
and 
through 
the 
angle 
between 
two 
neighbouring 
sides. 
The 
paragraphs 
which 
immediately 
follow 
the 
statement 
of 
the 
axioms, 
before 
the 
first 
proposition, 
are 
concerned 
with 
expanding 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
axioms. 
In 
particular, 
Kepler 
points 
out 
that 
the 
two axioms 
in 
fact 
lead 
to 
the 
same 
set 
of 
configurations. 
This 
is 
most 
easily 
illus- 
trated 
by 
bringing 
together 
all 
the 
diagrams 
of 
Aspects 
which 
occur 
later 
in 
the 
chapter, 
from 
which 
we can 
see 
that 
the 
angle 
subtended 
by 
the 
side 
of 
a congruence- 
forming 
and 
knowable 
polygon 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
its 
cir- 
cumcircle 
is 
always 
equal 
to 
the 
angle 
of, another

243) 

237 
congruence-forming 
and 
knowable 
polygon 
(for 
the 
square 
it 
is 
in 
fact 
an angle 
of 
the 
same 
polygon) 
(see 
figure 
5.5). 
Since 
both 
axioms 
give 
the 
same 
set 
of 
Aspects 
it 
would 
appear 
that 
Kepler 
has 
committed 
the 
mathematical 
solecism 
of 
employing 
two 
axioms 
where 
one 
would 
ap- 
parently 
have 
sufficed. 
However, 
the 
use 
of 
both 
axioms 
has 
the 
advantage 
of 
allowing 
him 
to 
relate 
each 
Aspect 
to 
two 
polygons, 
the 
"central" 
one 
and 
the 
"circumfer- 
ential" 
one. 
A decision 
between 
the 
two 
might 
have 
seemed 
unnecessarily 
arbitrary 
at 
this 
stage 
of 
the 
pro- 
ceedings 
for, 
as we shall 
see, 
Kepler 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
regard 
his 
axioms 
as 
being, 
by 
definition, 
true, 
but 
rather 
as reasonable 
assumptions 
that 
might 
be suscep- 
tible 
of 
proof 
(see 
below). 
The 
series 
of 
propositions 
which 
immediately 
follows 
the 
axioms 
is 
concerned 
with 
establishing 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
the 
"central" 
and 
"circumferential" 
polygons 
for 
their 
corresponding 
Aspect, 
and 
deciding 
which 
properties 
of 
the 
polygons 
should 
be considered 
as 
determining 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
Aspects. 
The 
first 
proposition 
looks 
back 
to 
the 
consonances: 
"Aspects 
are 
more 
closely 
connected 
with 
the 
circle 
and 
its 
arcs 
than 
the 
consonances 
are" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
242,1.28). 
This 
is 
proved 
simply 
by 
considering 
the 
relationship 
of 
each 
to 
its 
associated 
circle: 
"the 
consonances 
do not 
depend 
immediately 
on 
the 
circle 
and 
its 
arcs 
on account 
of 
their 
being 
circular, 
but 
on account 
of 
the 
length 
of 
the 

238 
parts, 
that 
is, 
their 
proportion 
one 
to 
another, 
which 
would 
be the 
same 
if 
the 
circle 
were 
straight- 
ened 
out 
into 
a line. 
Whereas 
the 
Aspects, 
by 
definition 
I, 
are 
angles, 
which 
the 
circle 
measures 
with 
its 
arcs, 
and 
in 
no other 
way 
except 
by 
remaining 
what 
I 
have 
called 
it, 
that 
is, 
by 
continuing 
to 
have 
a circular 
shape 
and 
to 
remain 
complete" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
242,1.35 
et 
seqq). 
Kepler 
adds 
that 
the 
consonances 
do not 
always 
involve 
the whole 
circle, 
' but 
sometimes 
only 
ratios 
of 
parts 
of 
it, 
whereas 
Aspects 
do always 
concern 
the 
whole 
circle. 
This 
mixture 
of 
physical 
and 
mathematical 
reasoning 
is 
characteristic 
of 
most 
of 
the 
propositions, 
though 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
the 
two 
components 
varies 
from 
proposition 
to 
proposition. 
For 
example, 
Proposition 
IV 
that 
"Congruence 
of 
figures 
is 
more 
influential 
than 
Knowability 
in 
making 
a configuration 
powerful" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
245) 
is 
clearly 
mainly 
a matter 
of 
physics. 
The 
following 
proposition, 
that 
"Congruence 
is 
a property 
of 
the 
Circumferential 
rather 
than 
the 
Central 
figure" 
is 
entirely 
mathematical. 
By way 
of 
proof, 
Kepler 
asserts, 
quite 
reasonably, 
that 
the 
capacity 
to 
form 
congruences 
is 
a property 
of 
the 
figure 
as a whole 
and 
the 
circum- 
ferential 
polygon 
is 
employed 
as a whole 
(i. 
e. 
the 
circle 
goes 
through 
all 
its 
vertices) 
whereas 
the 
central 
polygon 
has only 
one of 
its 
angles 
at 
the 
centre 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
245,11.35-38). 
This 
straightforward 
mathematical 
insight 
provides 
the 
justification 
for 
using 
the 
hier- 

239 
-archy 
of 
polygons 
defined 
by 
considering 
congruences 
as 
a means 
of 
determining 
the 
relative 
status 
of 
Aspects 
- 
once 
Kepler 
has 
shown, 
in 
Proposition 
VI, 
that 
Aspects 
are 
to 
be 
seen 
as 
determined 
more 
by 
their 
circumferential 
than 
their 
central 
polygons, 
and, 
in 
propositon 
VII, 
that 
for 
the 
circumferential 
polygon 
congruence-forming 
is 
more 
important 
than 
knowability 
of 
the 
side 
(and 
vice 
versa 
for 
the 
central 
polygon) 
(KGW 6, 
pp. 
246-250). 
Proposition 
VIII 
is 
a partial 
converse 
of 
Axiom 
I, 
namely 
that 
the 
arc 
of 
a circle 
cut 
off 
by 
a figure 
which 
does 
not 
form 
congruences 
does 
not 
correspond 
to 
an 
Aspect. 
I 
confess 
that 
I 
do not 
really 
understand 
why 
Kepler 
did 
not 
make 
this 
proposition 
an axiom, 
unless, 
perhaps, 
he thought 
it 
too 
important 
to 
be asserted 
without 
proof: 
his 
comment 
on 
it 
is 
"Behold 
the 
cause 
why, 
although 
the 
knowable 
figures 
are 
infinite 
in 
number, 
though 
of 
various 
rank, 
yet 
the 
Aspects 
are 
few" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
250,11.17,18). 
However, 
it 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
axioms 
to 
have 
just 
this 
importance, 
as Kepler 
had 
acknowledged 
after 
stating 
his 
two 
axioms 
earlier 
in 
this 
chapter. 
Moreover, 
though 
the 
two 
axioms 
I 
quoted 
are 
called 
axioms, 
the 
series 
of 
propositions 
which 
follows 
them 
does 
seem 
to 
me to 
have 
been 
at 
least 
partly 
designed 
to 
justify 
accepting 
them 
as 
true, 
and 
Kepler's 
comment 
on his 
third 
axiom 
(which 
appears 
immediately 
after 
Proposition 
VIII 
and 
states 
that 
the 
arcs 
of 
a circle 
whose 
corresponding 
polygons 
are 
of 
higher 
rank 
in 
Congruence. 
and 
Knowability 
will 
give 
more 
powerful 

240 
configurations) 
begins 
"If 
the 
first 
two 
axioms 
are 
acceptable 
(consentanea) 
... 
"( 
KGW 6, 
p. 
250,1.23). 
It 
therefore 
appears 
that 
the 
word 
"axiom" 
does 
not 
mean 
quite 
the 
same to 
Kepler 
as 
it 
does 
to 
a modern 
mathe- 
matician, 
and 
seems 
to 
have 
done 
to 
Archimedes. 
Kepler's 
use of 
the 
word 
in 
this 
chapter 
is 
rather 
closer 
to 
Copernicus' 
usage 
in 
the 
Commentariolus, 
where 
"axiom" 
apparently 
means 
something 
we shall 
use 
as 
if 
it 
were 
true 
but 
would 
like 
to 
prove 
one 
day 
if 
we can 
(see 
Swerdlow, 
1973). 
Like 
Kepler, 
Copernicus 
also 
shows 
no 
anxiety 
to 
reduce 
his 
axioms 
to 
the 
minimum 
number 
or 
to 
ensure 
their 
mutual 
independence. 
Having 
stated 
his 
third, 
and 
final, 
axiom, 
Kepler 
proceeds 
to 
list 
the 
twelve 
Aspects 
whose 
existence 
can 
be deduced 
from 
the 
axioms, 
referring 
to 
the 
results 
of 
Books 
I and 
II 
for 
proof 
that 
the 
polygons 
involved 
are 
congruence-forming 
and 
knowable 
(Prop. 
IX, 
KGW 6, 
pp. 
250, 
1). 
The next 
group 
of 
propositions, 
numbers 
X to 
XV, 
is 
concerned 
with 
establishing 
the 
relative 
degrees 
of 
power 
of 
the 
Aspects, 
on the 
basis 
of 
the 
nobleness 
of 
the 
corresponding 
polygons 
established 
in 
Books 
I 
and 
II 
(i. 
e. 
using 
the 
criteria 
set 
out 
in 
Axiom 
III). 
Kepler 
works 
from 
the 
strongest 
Aspects, 
opposition 
and 
conjun- 
ction, 
which 
correspond 
to 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle 
(Prop. 
X, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
251), 
to 
the 
weakest 
configurations, 
"configurations 
which 
hesitate 
between 
power 
and 
power- 
lessness, 
namely 
the 
240 
arc 
from 
the 
pentekaedecagon 
and 
the 
18° 
arc 
from 
the 
icosigon" 
(Prop. 
XV, KGW; 6, 
p. 
256). 
The 
lowest 
grade 
of 
configurations 
which 
are 

241 
definitely 
accepted 
as 
Aspects 
is 
that 
of 
the 
decile, 
tridecile, 
octile 
and 
trioctile 
Aspects 
(Prop. 
XIV, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
254), 
shown 
in 
the 
diagrams 
numbered 
XII, 
X, 
V and 
VI 
in 
figure 
5.5 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
243). 
This 
enumera- 
tion 
of 
the 
effective 
configurations, 
in 
order 
of 
decreasing 
power, 
brings 
Kepler's 
chapter 
to 
an end. 
His 
following 
chapter, 
Chapter 
VI, 
returns 
to 
the 
comparison 
of 
astrological 
and 
musical 
harmonies, 
with 
a discussion 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
not 
the 
same 
number 
of 
Aspects 
as 
there 
are 
Consonances. 
As we have 
seen, 
Kepler 
had 
already 
discussed 
the 
physical 
distinc- 
tions 
to 
be made 
between 
the 
two 
types 
of 
harmony 
(in 
Chapter 
IV). 
The 
new discussion 
is 
concerned 
with 
differences 
in 
the 
mathematical 
formulation, 
which 
were 
dictated 
by 
the 
physical 
differencs, 
and 
have 
led 
to 
Aspects 
which 
do not 
correspond 
exactly 
with 
the 
Conson- 
ances 
described 
in 
Book 
III. 
Chapter 
VI 
thus 
provides 
philosophical 
justification 
for 
the 
mathematical 
reasoning 
of 
Chapter 
V. 
Kepler 
no doubt 
thought 
he had 
better 
show 
first 
that 
his 
mathematical 
method 
would 
give 
the 
desired 
result 
and 
leave 
philosophical 
arguments 
until 
later. 
The 
final 
chapter 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV, 
Chapter 
VII, 
is, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
mentioned, 
concerned 
with 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
Earth. 
In 
neither 
of 
these 
last 
two chapters 
is 
there 
any discussion 
of 
how Kepler's 
Aspects 
are 
to 
be applied 
in 
the 
practical 
business 
of 
Astrology. 
Indeed, 
Kepler 
begins 
Chapter 
VI 
by 
ruling 

242 
out 
such 
practical 
considerations: 
"On what 
occasions 
powerful 
Configurations 
are 
detected, 
and 
the 
increase 
in 
their 
Number 
[i. 
e. 
beyond 
the 
conventionally 
accepted 
number], 
this 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
recall, 
for 
such 
matters 
belong 
to 
Astrology; 
and 
I 
dealt 
with 
them 
twelve 
years 
ago 
in 
my book 
on the 
new star 
and 
the 
Fiery 
Trigon 
[i. 
e. 
De Stella 
Nova, 
Prague, 
1606], 
in 
Chapters 
VIII, 
IX 
and X... 
" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
257,11.4-7). 
Thus, 
although 
the 
06 
main 
title 
page 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V describes 
the 
fourth 
book 
as 
"metaphysical, 
psychological 
and 
astrological", 
and 
the 
title 
page 
of 
Book 
IV 
reads 
"On 
the 
harmonic 
configurations 
of 
stellar 
rays 
at 
the 
Earth, 
and 
their 
effect 
on the 
weather 
and 
other 
natural 
pheno- 
mena", 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
book 
are 
very 
little 
more 
than 
a discussion 
of 
the 
theoretical 
foundations 
of 
Astrology, 
rather 
than 
what 
Kepler 
himself 
apparently 
regarded 
as 
Astrology 
proper. 
Presumably 
Kepler 
felt 
it 
was 
not 
inappropriate 
for 
this 
book 
to 
deal 
only 
with 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
sub- 
ject, 
since 
he had, 
as he remarks, 
dealt 
with 
the 
more 
practical 
side 
of 
things 
in 
several 
other 
works, 
but 
his 
restriction 
of 
the 
scope 
of 
Book 
IV 
also 
seems 
to 
indicate 
what 
he took 
to 
be the 
limitations 
of 
his 
mathematical 
theory. 
As he said 
in 
his 
notes 
for 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
he had 
found 
that 
"the 
heavens, 
the 
first 
of 
God's 
works, 
were 
laid 
out 
much 
more 
beautifully 
than 
the 
remaining 
small 
and 
common 
things" 
(Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Frankfurt, 
1621, 
note 
on the 
title 
page, 
KGW 8, 
p. 
15,1.16). 
In 
Timaeus 
Plato 

243 
had 
given 
a mathematical 
description 
of 
the 
sublunary 
world 
as well 
as 
the 
celestial, 
but 
Kepler 
had 
found 
himself 
compelled 
to 
apply 
an Aristotelian 
distinction 
and 
confine 
his 
mathematical 
cosmology 
to 
the 
heavens. 
We may imagine 
that 
he 
did 
so with 
regret, 
since 
he does 
not 
seem 
to 
have 
believed 
that 
celestial 
physics 
should 
be distinguished 
from 
terrestrial. 
However, 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV 
succeeds 
at 
least 
in 
giving 
an 
a priori 
mathematical 
account 
of 
the 
means 
by 
which 
celestial 
bodies 
exercise 
influence 
upon 
terrestrial 
ones. 
Astronomy: 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V 
The main 
concern 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book V is 
to 
show 
that 
the 
human 
music 
described 
in 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
Book 
III 
has 
its 
celestial 
counterpart, 
in 
which 
ratios 
of 
velocities 
of 
planets 
play 
the 
part 
of 
musical 
intervals. 
This 
is 
clear 
not 
only 
from 
the 
structure 
of 
Book 
V as 
a whole 
but 
also 
from 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
long 
cascade 
of 
subordinate 
clauses 
which 
make 
the 
first 
sentence 
of 
Kepler's 
introduction 
to 
the 
book 
a translator's 
night- 
mare 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
289,11.2-19). 
The 
sentence 
ends 
"the 
whole 
nature 
of 
Harmony, 
as 
a whole, 
as 
explained 
in 
Book 
III, 
is 
to 
be found 
among 
celestial 
motions; 
not 
indeed 
in 
the 
way 
I 
had 
thought; 
and 
this 
is 
not 
the 
least 
part 
of 
my joy; 
but 
in 
another 
very 
different 
way, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
both 
most 
striking 
and 
most 
perfect". 
"The 
way 
I 
had 
thought" 
probably 
refers 
to 
the 
astro- 

244 
nomical 
section 
of 
the 
projected 
De Harmonieei 
Mundi 
which 
Kepler 
had 
intended 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
periods 
of 
the 
planets 
(Kepler 
to 
Herwart, 
14 Dec. 
1599, 
letter 
148, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
100). 
Ironically 
enough, 
though 
Kepler 
abandoned 
this 
project, 
it 
is 
for 
its 
"explanation" 
of 
the 
periods 
of 
the 
planets 
that 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V 
is 
now best 
known. 
For 
Kepler's 
third 
law 
is, 
in 
Kepler's 
own terms, 
to 
be seen 
as 
an explanation 
of 
the 
periods, 
since 
it 
establishes 
their 
dependence 
on the 
mean 
radii 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs, 
and 
to 
Kepler, 
as we have 
seen, 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
orbs 
were 
a more 
fundamental 
characteristic 
than 
the 
periods 
(see 
Chapter 
III 
above). 
Kepler 
did 
not 
discover 
his 
third 
law 
until 
shortly 
before 
he finished 
writing 
Book 
V, 
while 
the 
first 
books 
of 
the 
work 
were 
already 
being 
printed 
(see 
Haase, 
1971, 
and 
Gingerich, 
1975). 
In 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V, 
Chapter 
III, 
Kepler 
gives 
his 
own account 
of 
the 
slightly 
confused 
final 
stages 
of 
his 
discovery 
of 
the 
third 
law: 
"... 
I 
thought 
of 
it 
on 8 March 
of 
this 
year 
1618, 
but 
was unsuccessful 
in 
my attempt 
to 
verify 
it 
numerical- 
ly, 
and 
rejected 
it 
as untrue; 
then 
on 
15 May it 
came back 
to 
me and 
with 
a new assault 
drove 
the 
obscurity 
out 
of 
my mind; 
seventeen 
years' 
work 
with 
Tycho's 
observations 
and 
my present 
meditations 
on this 
subject 
were 
in 
such 
good 
agreement 
that 
at 
first 
I 
thought 
I 
was 
dreaming 
and 
was 
assuming 
the 
truth 
of 
what 
I 
was 
trying 
to 
find. 
But 
it 
is 
most 
certain 
and 
most 
exact 
that 
the 
proportion 
between 
the 
periods 
of 
any 
two 
planets 
is 
precisely 
three 

245 
halves 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
mean 
distances, 
that 
is 
of 
their 
orbs" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
302,11.14-23). 
Kepler 
then 
goes 
onto 
explain 
more 
precisely 
which 
dimension 
of 
the 
orb 
is 
to 
be taken 
as 
the 
"mean 
distance". 
The 
writing 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V was 
finished 
twelve 
days 
after 
this 
discovery, 
on 27 May 
1618, 
and 
the 
modifications 
to 
Book 
V occasioned 
by 
the 
discovery 
were 
eventually 
made 
on 
19 February 
1619 
(HM V, 
Ch. 
X, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
368). 
The 
new law 
does 
not 
play 
a large 
part 
in 
the 
astronomy 
of 
Book 
V, 
and 
there 
is, 
in 
fact, 
no 
reason 
why 
it 
should. 
It 
clearly 
cannot 
affect 
the 
theory 
that 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
are 
determined 
by 
the 
Platonic 
solids: 
because 
this 
theory 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
inner 
and 
outer 
surfaces 
of 
the 
orbs 
and 
not 
with 
their 
mean 
radii 
as 
the 
third 
law 
is. 
Moreover, 
the 
third_law 
is 
equally 
irrelevant 
to 
the 
main 
astronomical 
concern 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book V, namely 
the 
musical 
ratios 
to 
be found 
among the 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets 
at 
extreme 
points 
of 
their 
orbits, 
since 
the 
law 
is 
concerned 
only 
with 
the 
periods 
of 
the 
planets, 
that 
is, 
with 
their 
mean 
motions, 
not 
their 
motion 
at 
particular 
points. 
However, 
the 
third 
law 
plays 
an 
important 
part 
in 
the 
cosmological 
work 
of 
Book 
V, 
the 
deduction 
of 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
planetary 
spheres 
from 
the 
'harmonic' 
archetype 
described 
in 
the 
penultimate 
chapter 
of 
the 
book 
(HM V, Ch. 
IX, 
see below). 
The 
third 
law 
is 
not 
given 
a prominent 
position 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
submerged 
in 

246 
calculations 
as the 
first 
two 
laws 
were 
submerged 
in 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova. 
Caspar 
has 
generously 
included 
the 
law 
in 
his 
Personenregister, 
under 
the 
name 
"Keplers 
drittes 
Planetengesetz", 
but 
it 
is, 
really, 
where 
one 
would 
expect 
to 
find 
it: 
in 
the 
chapter 
which 
summarises 
the 
astronomical 
results 
which 
will 
be required 
in 
the 
later 
part 
of 
the 
work. 
This 
astronomical 
summary 
forms 
the 
third 
chapter 
of 
Book 
V, 
the 
first 
chapter 
having 
been 
devoted 
to 
an account 
of 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids 
and 
other 
geometrical 
matters 
(including 
a brief 
description 
of 
one 
of 
Kepler's 
star 
polyhedra). 
The 
second 
chapter 
of 
Book 
V discussed 
the 
connection 
of 
harmonic 
proportions 
with 
"the 
five 
regular 
figures" 
i. e. 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
(Kepler 
knows 
his 
star 
polyhedra 
should 
"by 
rights 
be 
accepted 
as regular", 
but 
continues 
to 
use 
the 
word 
"regular" 
as 
if 
it 
singled 
out 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
- 
see 
Appendix 
6, 
Part 
I). 
This 
numerological 
chapter 
may at 
first 
appear 
to 
be a more 
sophisticated 
version 
of 
the 
numerological 
chapter 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(Chapter 
X). 
However, 
Kepler's 
notes 
on that 
chapter 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
refer 
the 
reader 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Books 
I and 
II 
for 
geometrical 
alternatives 
to 
the 
numerology 
and 
not 
to 
this 
numerological 
chapter 
in 
Book 
V. 
I think 
that 
the 
reason 
for 
this 
must 
be that 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
Kepler 
was 
trying 
to 
use 
the 
C 
properties 
of 
the 
Platonij 
solids 
as 
an explanation 
for 
properties 
of 
numbers, 
a role 
which 
was, 
indeed, 
taken 
over 
in 
the 
later 
work 
by 
regular 
polygons 
(hence 
the 

247 
reference 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Books 
I 
and 
II), 
whereas 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V Chapter 
II 
he 
is 
merely 
showing 
that 
some harmonic 
proportions, 
whose 
geo- 
metrical 
origins 
have 
already 
been 
established, 
are 
observed 
to 
occur 
among 
the 
geometrical 
properties 
of 
the 
solids. 
He is 
thus 
concerned 
with 
a mere 
connection 
not 
a determining 
cause. 
As I mentioned 
in 
my previous 
chapter, 
the 
astronomical 
summary 
in 
Book 
V 
Chapter 
III 
includes 
a qualitative 
account 
of 
the 
agreement 
between 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
calculated 
by 
considering 
the 
circum- 
spheres 
and 
inspheres 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
and 
the 
dimensions 
found 
by 
calculation 
from 
Tycho's 
observations, 
after 
which 
Kepler 
notes 
that 
the 
agreement 
is 
not 
exact 
and 
concludes 
"From 
this 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
exact 
proportion 
of 
the 
distances 
of 
the 
planets 
from 
the 
Sun 
was 
not 
taken 
from 
the 
five 
regular 
solid 
figures 
alone; 
for 
the 
Creator 
does 
not 
depart 
from 
his 
Archetype, 
the 
Creator 
being 
the 
true 
source 
of 
Geometry 
and, 
as 
Plato 
wrote, 
always 
engaged 
in 
the 
practice 
of 
Geometry" 
(HM V, 
Ch. 
III, 
KGW 61 
p. 
299,11.29-32). 
Though 
Kepler 
does 
not 
quote 
any 
numerical 
values 
for 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
orbs, 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
he must 
have 
calculated 
values 
like 
those 
shown 
in 
table 
4.4 
(apart 
from 
the 
column 
of 
percentage 
errors). 
Now, 
the 
absolute 
errors 
in 
that 
table 
do not 
show 
a marked 

248 
improvement 
over 
the 
errors 
in 
the 
corresponding 
figures 
as calculated 
on the 
basis 
of 
the 
much 
less 
accurate 
observational 
data 
available 
to 
Kepler 
at 
the 
time 
he 
wrote 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(see 
table 
4.5). 
In 
fact 
the 
1596 
figures 
show 
two 
single-figure 
errors, 
a0 
and 
a 1, whereas 
the 
1621 
ones 
show 
only 
one, 
a 3. 
Kepler 
is 
justly 
famous 
for 
having 
made 
crucial 
use 
of 
an estimate 
of 
observational 
error 
to 
reject 
a theory, 
but 
the 
present 
case 
is 
a rather 
more 
complicated 
one. 
It 
seems 
to 
me that 
he 
had no practicable 
way 
of 
finding 
out 
how Tycho's 
observational 
errors 
might 
affect 
the 
"observed" 
radii 
of 
the 
planetary 
spheres. 
I 
suspect 
he 
made a crude 
comparison 
of 
the 
absolute 
disagreement 
between 
theoretical 
and 
"observed" 
values 
and 
decided 
that 
the 
agreement 
should 
have 
been 
improved 
more 
than 
it 
seemed 
to 
have 
been. 
The very 
stringent 
standard 
implied 
by 
the 
words 
"for 
the 
Creator 
does 
not 
depart 
from 
his 
Archetype" 
may perhaps 
have 
been 
applied 
later, 
when 
Kepler 
had 
found 
a "harmonic" 
explanation 
of 
the 
pro- 
portions 
of 
the 
orbits 
which 
fitted 
closely 
with 
what 
was 
observed. 
The 
later 
theory 
created 
its 
own standard 
of 
exactness, 
as well 
as explaining 
why 
the 
earlier 
one 
had 
failed 
to 
meet 
it. 
Kepler's 
belief 
that 
such 
a standard 
could 
be met 
must 
also 
have 
been 
bolstered 
by his 
dis- 
covery 
of 
the 
third 
law, 
whose 
agreement 
with 
observation 
was 
very 
close 
indeed 
(see 
Gingerich, 
1975). 
Having 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
archetype 
proposed 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
is 
inadequate 
because 
it 
does 

249 
not 
give 
an exact 
account 
of 
the 
"observed" 
internal 
and 
external 
radii 
of 
the 
orbs, 
Kepler 
immediately 
begins 
to 
discuss 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
orbs. 
As we 
have 
seen, 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum 
made 
no attempt 
to 
explain 
the 
different 
thicknesses 
of 
the 
various 
planetary 
orbs. 
Considering 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
orb, 
that 
is, 
the 
eccentricity 
of 
the 
orbit 
of 
the 
planet, 
naturally 
leads 
one 
to 
consider 
the 
variable 
speed 
at 
which 
the 
planet 
moves 
round 
its 
orbit. 
This 
progression 
must 
have 
seemed 
even 
more 
natural 
to 
Kepler, 
who had 
spent 
many 
months 
on the 
calculations 
which 
eventually 
related 
the 
orbital 
velocity 
to 
the 
length 
of 
the 
radius 
vector 
by means 
of 
the 
Area 
Law, 
his 
first 
success 
in 
his 
"battle 
with 
Mars". 
It 
seems 
quite 
possible 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
musical 
archetype 
described 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V may 
be 
the 
product 
of 
a line 
of 
thought 
such 
as 
that 
pursued 
in 
Book 
V, 
Chapter 
III, 
where 
Kepler 
starts 
by 
noting 
a 
philosophical 
inadequacy 
in 
the 
earlier 
archetype, 
namely 
its 
failure 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
orbs, 
and 
goes 
on to 
examine 
the 
changes 
in'speed 
of 
the 
planet 
and 
thus 
its 
extreme 
speeds, 
at 
perihelion 
and 
aphelion 
(HM V, 
Ch. 
III, 
p. 
299,1.32 
to 
p. 
300,1.30). 
In 
any 
case, 
Kepler 
merely 
passes 
from 
his 
note 
of 
the 
inade- 
quacy 
of 
the 
earlier 
archetype 
to 
a discussion 
of 
planetary 
velocities 
(taking 
in 
the 
third 
law 
on 
the 
way) 
and 
then, 
in 
the 
next 
chapter, 
goes 
on to 
search 
for 
musical 
ratios 
among 
various 
possible 
measures 
of 
the 

250 
orbital 
velocities. 
There 
is 
no description 
of 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
musical 
archetype 
to 
serve 
as pendant 
to 
the 
description 
of 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
polyhedral 
one 
in 
the 
preface 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(see 
Chapter 
III 
above). 
As we have 
seen, 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV Kepler 
was 
dealing 
with 
harmonious 
relationships 
among 
the 
apparent 
positions 
of 
the 
planets, 
as 
seen 
from 
the 
Earth. 
He 
makes 
it 
clear 
from 
the 
very 
beginning 
of 
Book 
V 
Chapter 
IV 
that 
his 
concern 
is 
not 
with-apparent 
properties 
but 
with 
absolute 
ones, 
that 
is, 
properties 
measured 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
still 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe, 
the 
Sun 
(or, 
in 
the 
Tychonic 
system, 
the 
centre 
at 
least 
of 
planetary 
orbits): 
"So, 
having 
disposed 
of 
the 
fantasy 
of 
retro- 
gradations 
and 
stations, 
and 
having 
got 
to 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
matter, 
the 
individual 
motions 
of 
the 
planets 
in 
their 
true 
eccentric 
orbits 
(in 
suis 
genuinis 
Orbitis 
eccentricis), 
there 
now remain 
the 
following 
properties 
that 
distinguish 
the 
planets 
one 
from 
another: 
1. 
Distances 
from 
the 
Sun, 
2. 
Periodic 
times, 
3. 
Daily 
orbital 
arc 
on the 
eccentric 
[i. 
e. 
as an angle], 
4. 
Length 
of 
daily 
path 
along 
these 
arcs, 
5. 
Angles 
at 
the 
Sun or 
the 
apparent 
arc 
traversed 
in 
a day 
as 
seen 
from 
the 
Sun" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
306, 
11.5-10). 
1 
1. 
Kepler 
is 
concerned 
not 
with 
individual 
planets 
but 
with 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Solar 
system, 
so 
the 
proper- 
ties 
he chooses 
to 
consider 
are 
all, 
strictly 
speaking, 
properties 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbit 
rather 
than 
proper 
ties 
of 
the 
planet 
itself, 
such 
as 
its 
diameter. 
Presumably 
Kepler 
himself 
regarded 
this 
point 
as 
obvious, 
since 
he 
makes 
no explicit 
reference 
to 
it. 

251 
The 
wording 
of 
the 
fourth 
item 
is 
none 
too 
clear 
- 
and 
Caspar's 
translation 
of 
it 
makes 
no 
sense 
to 
me (Kepler 
trans 
Caspar, 
1973, 
p. 
295). 
However, 
Kepler's 
later 
discussion 
indicates 
that 
the 
third 
item 
refers 
to 
arcs 
of 
the 
orbit 
seen 
as 
angular 
arcs 
traversed 
in 
the 
planetary 
sphere 
and, 
I 
think, 
justifies 
my translation 
of 
the 
fourth 
item. 
Kepler 
says 
"... 
indeed, 
arcs 
of 
two 
eccentrics, 
equal 
or 
denoted 
by the 
same 
number, 
nevertheless 
have 
different 
true 
lengths 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
complete 
eccentrics. 
For 
example, 
one 
degree 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
Saturn 
is 
about 
twice 
as 
large 
as 
one 
degree 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
Jupiter. 
And 
again, 
the 
daily 
arcs 
on the 
eccentric 
expressed 
in 
astronomical 
numbers 
[i. 
e. 
as angles] 
do not 
show 
the 
proportion 
between 
the 
true 
distances 
the 
globes 
traverse 
through 
the 
aether, 
because 
single 
units 
denote 
a larger 
portion 
of 
distance 
in 
the 
wider 
circle 
of 
a higher 
planet, 
and 
a smaller 
one 
in 
the 
narrower 
circle 
of 
a lower 
one" 
(KGW 6, p. 
306, 
1.32 
to 
p. 
307,1.3). 
This 
explanation 
seems 
to 
indicate 
that 
items 
three 
and 
four 
in 
Kepler's 
list 
are 
in 
fact 
concerned 
with 
true 
motions, 
that 
is, 
motions 
referred 
to 
the 
Sun, 
and 
their 
use 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
day 
as 
a unit 
of 
time 
is 
merely 
conventional 
(and 
convenient). 
Apart 
from 
the 
period, 
all 
the 
items 
on 
this 
list 
change 
in 
magnitude 
as 
the 
planet 
moves 
round 
its 
orbit. 
Kepler 
decides 
to 
use 
the 
most 
nearly 
static 
values, 
that 
is 
values 
at 
the 
points 
of 
the 
orbits 
where 
they 
change 
most 
slowly, 
namely 
perihelion 
and 
aphelion 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
306, 
11.10-25). 

252 
He considers 
the 
periods 
first, 
presumably 
because 
they 
are 
the 
simplest 
to 
deal 
with, 
and 
gives 
a table 
to 
show 
that 
they 
do not 
present 
musical 
proportions 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
307). 
The distances 
from 
the 
Sun are 
considered 
next, 
and there 
is 
another 
table, 
showing 
the 
aphelion 
and 
perihelion 
distances 
of 
each 
planet, 
together 
with 
the 
ratio 
between 
these 
distances 
for 
each 
individual 
planet 
and 
the 
ratio 
between 
values 
of 
different 
types 
for 
neighbouring 
pairs 
of 
planets, 
for 
example, 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
aphelion 
distance 
of 
Jupiter 
to 
the 
perihelion 
distance 
of 
Mars 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
309). 
The 
only 
individual 
planets 
to 
yield 
ratios 
close 
to 
musical 
ones 
are 
Mars 
and Mercury, 
but 
some of 
the 
pairs 
of 
neighbouring 
planets 
also 
give 
such 
ratios. 
Kepler 
makes 
it 
clear 
that 
he is 
looking 
for 
more 
convincing 
results 
than 
this 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
310,1.1 
et 
seqq). 
He turns 
next 
to 
the 
daily 
motions, 
again 
considering 
aphelion 
and 
perihelion 
values, 
in 
degrees 
and 
minutes 
of 
arc 
as 
seen 
from 
the 
Sun, 
and 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
actual 
distance 
traversed, 
the 
unit 
of 
distance 
being 
chosen 
so 
that 
the 
mean 
distance 
of 
the 
Earth 
from 
the 
Sun 
is 
1000 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
311). 
He deals 
with 
the 
linear 
distances 
quite 
briskly, 
correctly 
pointing 
out 
that 
for 
an individual 
planet 
the 
ratio 
will 
be the 
inverse 
of 
that 
obtained 
from 
the 
distances 
from 
the 
Sun 
in 
the 
last 
table, 
and 
adding 
that 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
we 
do 
not 
find 
musical 
ratios 
from 
the 
pairs 
of 
neighbouring 
planets 
either 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
311,11.16-22). 
The motions 
in 
arc 
are 
compared 
in 
the 
next 
table, 
4l

253 
ratios 
again 
being 
calculated 
as 
they 
were 
for 
the 
distances, 
so that 
the 
arcs 
for 
each 
planet 
are 
compared 
with 
one 
another 
and 
each 
are 
is 
also 
compared 
with 
the 
are 
of 
the 
opposite 
kind 
in 
neighbouring 
pairs 
of 
planets 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
312). 
I have 
shown 
this 
table 
in 
figure 
5.6. 
The ratios 
it 
derives 
are 
crucial 
to 
the 
remainder 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V. 
The 
fourth 
column 
of 
the 
table 
gives 
the 
"observed" 
daily 
motion, 
as 
it 
would 
be seen 
from 
the 
Sun, 
in 
minutes 
and 
seconds 
of 
are. 
The sixth 
gives 
the 
musical 
ratios 
which 
fit 
most 
closely 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
extreme 
speeds 
of 
the 
planets. 
The fifth 
column 
shows 
Kepler's 
method 
of 
indicating 
how closely 
the 
musical 
ratios 
fit: 
it 
contains 
daily 
arcs 
which 
would 
give 
this 
musical 
ratio 
exactly. 
The suggested 
modifications 
of 
the 
daily 
arcs 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
perfect 
musical 
ratios 
are 
all 
quite 
small. 
If 
the 
modified 
values 
are 
taken 
to 
be 
correct, 
then 
the 
"observed" 
values 
would 
have 
to 
be 
assumed 
to 
be in 
error 
by 
1% for 
the 
Earth 
and 
Venus, 
by 
2% for 
Saturn 
and 
Jupiter, 
and 
by 
3% for 
Mars 
and 
Mercury. 
A little 
later 
in 
this 
chapter, 
Kepler 
points 
out 
that 
one 
can 
also 
find 
a musical 
ratio 
in 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Moon, 
whose 
extreme 
hourly 
motions 
in 
are 
are 
26'26" 
(at 
apogee) 
and 
35'12" 
(at 
perigee). 
If 
the 
latter 
figure 
is 
increased 
by 3", 
the 
ratio 
between 
them 
is 
exactly 
3: 4, 
the 
ratio 
for 
a fourth, 
"a 
harmony 
which 
is 
not 
found 
anywhere 
else 
among 
the 
apparent 
motions" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
313,11.37,8).

Motions 
in

Ch. 
IV 
and 
KGW 6, 
p. 
312) 

255 
is 
less 
than 
0.2%. 
The first 
two 
columns 
of 
Kepler's 
table 
show 
the 
musical 
ratios 
in 
the 
extreme 
speeds 
of 
neighbouring 
planets 
(motus 
diversi 
when 
the 
aphelion 
velocity 
of 
the 
higher 
planet 
is 
compared 
with 
the 
perihelion 
velocity 
of 
the 
lower 
one, 
motus 
conversi 
when 
the 
perihelion 
velocity 
of 
the 
higher 
planet 
is 
compared 
with 
the 
aphelion 
velocity 
of 
the 
lower 
one). 
There 
is 
no 
attempt 
to 
show 
in 
the 
table 
how accurately 
these 
first 
two 
columns 
represent 
the 
"observed" 
ratios. 
Kepler's 
own analysis 
of 
his 
table 
takes 
the 
form 
of 
considering 
the 
ratio 
by which 
the 
"observed" 
ratio 
differs 
from 
the 
nearby 
musical 
one: 
"The 
proportions 
of 
the 
individual 
apparent 
motions 
[i. 
e. 
the 
motions 
seen 
from 
the 
Sun] 
are 
very 
close 
to 
musical 
ones; 
so that 
Saturn 
and 
Jupiter 
make 
only 
a little 
more 
than 
major 
and 
minor 
thirds, 
the 
excess 
being 
53 
to 
54 
in 
the 
former 
case 
and 
54 
to 
55 
in 
the 
latter, 
or 
less, 
that 
is 
about 
half 
a comma; 
... 
" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
313, 
11.19-23). 
His 
analysis 
of 
the 
"diverse" 
and 
"converse" 
ratios 
is 
made 
in 
similar 
terms. 
This 
is 
appropriate 
enough, 
since 
the 
ratios 
which 
express 
the 
differences 
would 
correspond 
to 
a small 
interval 
in 
pitch 
if 
we were 
con- 
cerned 
with 
audible 
music. 
It 
appears 
that 
this 
analysis 
of 
the 
slight 
discordances 
by 
means 
of 
ratios 
did 
not 
suggest 
to 
Kepler 
that 
he 
should 
consider 
relative 
errors 

256 
in 
other 
contexts 
also. 
However, 
my own calculations 
show that 
Kepler's 
correcting 
ratios 
correspond 
to 
percentage 
errors 
of 
1% for 
the 
Earth, 
2% for 
Saturn 
and Jupiter, 
and 
3% for 
Mars, 
Venus 
and Mercury. 
The 
corrections 
to 
"diverse" 
and 
"converse" 
ratios 
are 
of 
the 
same order. 
Kepler's 
observational 
evidence 
for 
these 
"musical" 
commensurabilities 
is 
as good 
as most 
of 
the 
evidence 
which 
has 
sent 
modern 
astronomers 
in 
search 
of 
explana- 
tions 
for 
the 
commensurabilities 
they 
have 
found. 
Unfortunately, 
all 
the 
modern 
work 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
concerned 
with 
commensurabilities 
in 
mean 
motion, 
usually 
of 
systems 
of 
satellites. 
Commensurability 
in 
mean 
motion 
is, 
of 
course, 
equivalent 
to 
commensurability 
in 
period, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
show 
up 
strongly 
in 
the 
periods 
of 
the 
planets 
(where, 
as 
we have 
seen, 
Kepler 
failed 
to 
find 
it). 
The 
observed 
commensurabilities 
have 
been 
the 
subject 
of 
various 
individually 
convincing 
but 
mutually 
incompatible 
explanations, 
like 
much 
else 
in 
Astronomy. 
The 
facts 
and 
the 
explanations 
are 
summarised 
by 
Nieto 
(1972) 
in 
his 
book 
on 
the 
Titius-Bode 
Law 
and 
by 
King-fiele 
(1975) 
in 
a paper 
read 
to 
the 
Royal 
Astronomical 
Society 
in 
1971. 
They 
are 
expounded 
in 
more 
detail 
by 
Goldreich 
(1965) 
and 
by 
Ovenden 
(1975). 
Ovenden's 
paper 
was 
written 
specially 
for 
the 
Kepler 
volume 
of 
Vistas 
in 
Astronomy 
and 
though 
it 
does 
not 
deal 
with 
the 
matter 
directly, 
it 
leaves 
me with 
the 
impression 
that 
the 
commensurabilities 
in 
extreme 
motions 
which 
Kepler 

257 
describes 
might 
perhaps 
be the 
product 
of 
secular 
evolution 
of 
the 
system 
of 
orbits 
along 
the 
lines 
indicated 
by Ovenden: 
he shows 
that 
the 
evolution 
is 
slowest 
when 
the 
mean motions 
are 
close 
to 
commensura- 
bilities, 
so a system 
is 
most 
likely 
to 
be observed 
in 
this 
state. 
More 
recent 
work, 
by Message 
(1981, 
in 
press), 
shows 
that 
if 
a planetary 
system 
starts 
off 
close 
to 
resonance 
it 
will 
stay 
close 
to 
resonance 
indefinitely. 
This, 
I 
think, 
is 
as near 
as one 
can 
reasonably 
expect 
to 
come to 
being 
given 
scientific 
permission 
to 
believe 
in 
the 
validity 
of 
Kepler's 
musical 
commensurabilities. 
We have 
already 
noted 
that 
Kepler 
has 
shown 
very 
good 
observational 
evidence 
for 
the 
existence 
of 
"musical" 
ratios 
among 
the 
extreme 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets. 
He 
now proceeds 
to 
treat 
these 
ratios 
in 
musical 
terms, 
but 
acknowledges 
their 
observational 
origin 
by referring 
back 
to 
the 
actual 
angular 
velocities 
to 
check 
that 
his 
musical 
manipulations 
have 
not 
led 
him 
to 
depart 
from 
a reasonable 
standard 
of 
agreement 
with 
observation. 
We 
shall 
see 
below 
that 
he 
does 
indeed 
maintain 
such 
a 
standard, 
but 
it 
must 
be 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
pos- 
sibility 
of 
setting 
it 
up 
at 
all 
depends 
upon 
the 
observational 
evidence 
shown 
in 
figure 
5.6. 
On the 
basis 
of 
this 
evidence, 
Kepler 
proceeds 
to 
construct 
musical 
scales 
which 
include 
notes 
corresponding 
to 
all 
the 
pitches 
associated 
with 
the 
planets. 
In 
order 
to 
do this, 
he has 
to 
set 
a definite 
pitch 
for 
the 
slowest 
motion 
and 
then 
put 
all 
the 
other 
motions 
at 
the 

258 
appropriate 
intervals 
above 
it, 
but 
since 
he is 
interested, 
first, 
merely 
in 
obtaining 
every 
note 
of 
the 
scales, 
he 
decides 
to 
ignore 
octaves, 
so that, 
for 
example, 
the 
pitch 
of 
Mercury 
at 
aphelion 
is 
brought 
down six 
octaves 
to 
form 
the 
fifth 
note 
of 
a scale, 
the 
pitch 
of 
Mars 
at 
perihelion 
is 
brough 
down four 
octaves 
to 
form 
the 
fourth 
note 
of 
the 
same scale 
and its 
pitch 
at 
aphelion 
is 
brought 
down three 
octaves 
to 
form 
the 
seventh 
note 
(see 
figure 
5.8 
below). 
Kepler 
gives 
a table 
to 
show how the 
notes 
may all 
be brought 
into 
the 
compass 
of 
a single 
octave 
(see 
figure 
5.7). 
The plus 
and minus 
signs 
at 
the 
right 
of 
the 
table 
indicate 
whether 
the 
"observed" 
motion 
shown 
in 
the 
table 
reproduced 
in 
figure 
5.6 
is 
to 
be obtained 
by 
adding 
to 
the 
value 
in 
the 
new table 
or 
by subtracting 
from 
it. 
However, 
the 
modifications 
are 
very 
small, 
as 
can be seen 
from 
table

Notes

(HM V, 
Ch.

p. 
318) 
Kepler 
next 
proceeds 
to 
construct 
two 
scales 
(shown 
in 
figures 
5.8 
and 
5.9). 
As can 
be seen 
from 
these 
diagrams, 
one note 
is 
missing 
in 
each 
scale, 
A in 
the 
first 
and 
f 
in 
the 
second. 
Kepler 
points 
out 
that 
A was also 
missing 
from 
the 
ratios 
described 
in 
Book 
III, 
Chapter 
II 
(KGW 6, 
P. 
319,11.4,5)

except 
to 
note 
that 
it 
is 
missing 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
319,1.22). 
I presume 
that 
the 
reason 
why these 
gaps 
do not 
worry 
Kepler 
is 
that 
he knows 
that 
they 
will 
be filled 
in 
once 
he considers 
the 
complete 
compass 
of 
each 
planet, 
which 
he 
does 
in 
his 
next 
chapter. 
The 
scale 
shown 
in 
figure 
5.8 
is 
durus 
and 
uses 
the 
aphelion 
motion 
of 
Saturn 
as 
its 
lowest 
note, 
G. 
It 
takes 
in 
all 
the 
notes 
of 
the 
planets 
except 
those 
associated 
with 
the 
perihelion 
motions 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
Venus. 
An adjustment 
of 
4" 
has 
to 
be made 
to 
fit 
in 
the 
aphelion 
motion 
of 
Mercury 
(but 
this 
cor- 
responds 
to 
a change 
of 
less 
than 
2%0). 
Kepler's 
second 

261 
scale, 
shown 
in 
figure 
5.9, 
is 
mollis 
and 
starts 
from 
the 
perihelion 
motion 
of 
Saturn, 
as G, 
taking 
in 
all 
the 
notes 
of 
the 
planets. 
The motions 
of 
the 
Earth 
have 
to 
be taken 
up an octave 
to 
fit 
into 
this 
scale 
and 
small 
adjustments 
have 
to 
be made 
to 
all 
but 
one 
of 
the 
motions, 
the 
exception 
being 
the 
perihelion 
motion 
of 
Mercury. 
The largest 
absolute 
change 
is 
6", 
in 
the 
aphelion 
motion 
of 
Mars, 
a change 
which 
also 
gives 
the 
largest 
percentage 
difference, 
3%. 
All 
the 
other 
changes 
are 
less 
than 
2%. 
The 
fact 
that 
such 
scales 
can 
be constructed 
follows, 
of 
course, 
from 
the 
commensurabilities 
Kepler 
showed 
in 
the 
final 
table 
of 
his 
previous 
chapter 
(figure 
5.6). 
However, 
it 
seems 
to 
me to 
be significant 
that 
although 
in 
that 
table 
Kepler 
showed 
some adjusted 
motions 
which 
would 
give 
exact 
commensurabilities, 
he returns 
to 
the 
"observed" 
motions 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
constructing 
his 
musical 
scales. 
He clearly 
wished 
to 
keep 
as close 
to 
the 
observations 
as possible. 
The following 
three 
chapters 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V are 
concerned 
with 
purely 
musical 
developments. 
In 
Chapter 
VI 
Kepler 
gives 
the 
compass 
of 
notes 
corresponding 
to 
the 
range 
in 
speed 
of 
each 
planet 
as it 
travels 
round 
its 
orbit: 
Mercury 
has 
the 
largest 
compass, 
since 
it 
has 
the 
largest 
eccentricity, 
while 
Venus 
is 
confined 
to 
one 
note 
and 
the 
Earth 
has 
a compass 
of 
only 
a semitone 
(see 
figure 
5.10). 
In 
Chapter 
VII 
Kepler 
considers 
chords 
produced 
by all 
six 
planets 
together, 
and 
in 
the 
very 
brief 
Chapter 
VIII 
he gives 
each 
planet 
a particular 
musical

" 
(KGW 6, 
A" 329,1.15-19). 
Astronomy 
returns 
in 
Chapter 
IX, 
which, 
according 
to 
its 
title, 
is 
concerned 
with 
"the 
origin 
of 
the 
eccentric- 
ities 
of 
individual 
planets 
by harmonies 
being 
obtained 
among 
their 
motions" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
330). 
In 
fact, 
after 
calculating 
the 
eccentricities 
Kepler 
goes 
on to 
calculate 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
orbs, 
using 
his 
third 
law. 
(Perhaps 
the 
title 
of 
Chapter 
IX 
was 
not 
altered 
after 
the 
dis- 
covery 
of 
the 
third 
law? ). 
Harmonies 
are 
the 
main 
subject 
of 
Chapter 
IX, 
and 
its 
first 
section 
is 
an axiom 
stating 
that 
the 
harmonies 
must 
be of 
as many 
kinds 
as 
possible 
"so 
that 
this 
variety 
may 
make 
the 
world 
more 
beautiful" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
331,1.16). 
i 

263 
However, 
the 
next 
section 
is 
an axiom 
stating 
that 
the 
regular 
polyhedra 
also 
have 
a part 
to 
play: 
"It 
is 
proper 
that 
the 
five 
intervals 
between 
the 
six 
orbs 
should 
to 
some 
extent 
correspond 
in 
size 
with 
the 
proportions 
of 
the 
geometrical 
orbs 
inscribed 
in 
and 
circumscribed 
about 
the 
five 
regular 
solids, 
and 
should 
do 
so 
in 
the 
order 
which 
is 
natural 
to 
the 
five 
figures" 
(HM V, 
Ch. 
IX, 
sect. 
II, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
331,11.18-21). 
The 
first 
series 
of 
propositions, 
which 
is 
interspersed 
with 
an occasional 
extra 
axiom, 
is 
concerned 
with 
giving 
a mathematical 
defence 
of 
the 
association 
of 
each 
of 
the 
"observed" 
musical 
ratios 
with 
the 
particular 
planet 
or 
pair 
of 
planets 
for 
which 
it 
has 
been 
observed. 
The 
procedure 
is 
like 
Kepler's 
defence 
of 
his 
polyhedral 
archetype 
in 
Chapters 
III 
to 
VIII 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
where 
he proved, 
for 
instance, 
that 
it 
was 
suitable 
that 
the 
cube 
should 
be 
situated 
between 
the 
orbs 
of 
Saturn 
and 
of 
Jupiter 
(see 
Chapter 
III 
above). 
The 
justification 
of 
the 
musical 
ratios 
for 
individual 
planets 
is 
always 
by 
an appeal 
to 
the 
observed 
motions: 
for 
example, 
in 
section 
XIV, where 
it 
is 
required 
to 
show 
that 
"the 
proportion 
between 
the 
extreme 
motions 
of 
Mars 
had 
to 
be more 
than 
a fourth, 
3: 4, 
and 
about 
18: 25", 
the 
proof 
depends 
on 
the 
harmonies 
found 
between 
Mars 
and 
Jupiter 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
336,11.26-34). 
However, 
the 
-justifications 
of 
the 
musical 
ratios 
found 
between 
motions 
of 
neighbouring 
pairs 
of 
planets 
generally 
depend 
upon 
the 
polyhedron 
associated 
with 
their 
orbs. 
For 
example, 

264 
for 
the 
proposition 
that 
"Venus 
and Mercury 
had 
to 
have 
a Major 
Harmony, 
1: 4 a double 
octave", 
the 
proof 
begins 
"For 
just 
as the 
Cube 
is 
the 
first 
of 
the 
primary 
figures, 
so the 
Octahedron 
is 
the 
first 
of 
the 
secondary 
ones, 
by Chapter 
I 
of 
this 
book. 
And 
just 
as 
the 
Cube, 
considered 
geometrically 
is 
more 
outer 
and 
the 
Octahedron 
more 
inner, 
that 
is, 
inscribable 
within 
it 
[in 
fact, 
each 
can 
be 
inscribed 
within 
the 
other, 
but 
Kepler 
apparently 
prefers 
to 
emphasise 
the 
hierarchical 
distinction 
between 
"primary" 
and 
"secondary" 
solids 
first 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
see 
Chapter 
III 
above]; 
so, 
too, 
in 
the 
World 
Saturn 
and Jupiter 
are 
the 
first 
of 
the 
superior 
outer 
planets, 
starting 
from 
outside; 
while 
Mercury 
and 
Venus 
are 
the 
first 
of 
the 
inner 
ones, 
starting 
from 
inside, 
and 
between 
their 
paths 
there 
is 
the 
Octahedron, 
see 
Chapter 
III. 
So Mercury 
and 
Venus 
must 
have 
a harmony 
which 
is 
also 
primary 
and 
related 
to 
the 
Octahedron... 
" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
334,1.1.29-35)- 
This 
set 
of 
axioms 
and 
propositions, 
concerned 
with 
the 
harmonic 
ratios 
identified 
in 
Book 
V, 
Chapter 
IV, 
has 
the 
heading 
Rationes 
Priores. 
The 
following 
series, 
headed 
Posteriores 
Rationes, 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
scales 
developed 
in 
Chapters 
V and 
VI, 
though 
the 
propositions 
and 
their 
proofs 
do not 
take 
a markedly 
different 
form 
from 
those 
of 
the 
previous 
series. 
The 
regular 
polyhedra 
reappear 
in 
their 
own right 
in 

265 
section 
XLVI, 
an axiom 
which-explains 
the 
words 
"to 
some 
extent" 
used 
in 
the 
axiom 
of 
section 
II. 
This 
new axiom 
states 
that, 
but 
for 
the 
harmonic 
causes 
which 
have 
just 
been 
described, 
the 
geometrical 
solids 
would 
determine 
the 
relative 
sizes 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs. 
The 
following 
section, 
a proposition, 
describes 
a modified 
version 
of 
the 
polyhedral 
archetype 
proposed 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum: 
"If 
the 
inscription 
of 
the 
figures 
between 
the 
,. planets 
could 
be made 
freely, 
the 
angles 
of 
the 
Tetrahedron 
would 
touch 
the 
perihelion 
sphere 
of 
Jupiter 
exactly, 
above, 
while 
below, 
the 
centres 
of 
its 
faces 
would 
touch 
the 
aphelion 
sphere 
of 
Mars 
exactly. 
The 
Cube 
and 
the 
Octahedron, 
with 
their 
angles 
fitted 
to 
the 
perihelion 
spheres 
of 
their 
planets, 
would 
penetrate 
the 
orb 
below 
them, 
so that 
the 
centres 
of 
their 
faces 
would 
lie 
between 
its 
aphelion 
and 
perihelion 
spheres. 
On the 
other 
hand, 
the 
Dodecahedron 
and 
Icosa- 
hedron, 
fixed 
to 
the 
perihelion 
spheres 
of 
their 
planets 
on the 
outside, 
would 
not 
quite 
reach 
the 
aphelion 
spheres 
of 
the 
planets 
inside 
them 
with 
the 
centres 
of 
their 
faces. 
Finally, 
the 
dodeca- 
hedral 
hedgehog 
(echinus 
dodecaddricus) 
[i. 
e. 
the 
star 
polyhedron 
with 
twelve 
vertices, 
see 
diagrams 
Ss in 
figure 
5.2], 
standing 
with 
its 
angles 
on 
the 
perihelion 
sphere 
of 
Mars, 
would, 
with 
the 
centres 
of 
the 
parts 
of, its 
sides 
contained 
between 
two 
of 

266 
its 
points, 
come close 
to 
the 
aphelion 
sphere 
of 
Venus" 
(HM V, 
Ch. 
IX, 
sect. 
XLVII, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
354, 
11.19-29). 
This 
is 
not 
as neat 
as the 
scheme 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
but 
it 
gives, 
as we shall 
see, 
a rather 
better 
fit 
to 
the 
observations. 
For 
the 
present, 
Kepler 
is 
only 
concerned 
to 
establish 
its 
mathe- 
matical 
reasonableness, 
in 
about 
a page 
of 
geometrical 
argument 
that 
closely 
resembles 
the 
corresponding 
sections 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
However, 
whereas 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
the 
polyhedral 
archetype 
was 
seen 
as 
the 
only 
formal 
cause 
it 
is 
now subject 
to other 
factors, 
as 
Kepler 
explains 
in 
his 
next 
section: 
"The 
inscription 
of 
the 
regular 
solid 
figures 
between 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
was not 
entirely 
free 
of 
constraint, 
for-it 
was hindered 
a little 
by the 
harmon- 
ies 
established 
among 
the 
extreme 
motions" 
(sect. 
XLVIII, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
356,11.9-11). 
He proves 
this 
proposition 
by 
deducing 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Solar 
system 
from 
the 
harmonies 
observed 
among 
the 
extreme 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets, 
displaying 
his 
results 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a table 
at 
every 
stage 
of 
the 
calculation, 
and 
including 
intermediate 
working 
values 
in 
these 
tables. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
he were 
aware 
his 
readers 
might 
feel 
they 
were 
watching 
a con- 
juring 
trick. 
The 
first 
table 
shows 
how the 
eccentricities 
of 
the 
orbits 
can 
be deduced 
from 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
extreme 
motions 
(figure 
5.11).

Ratios 
of 
extreme 
motions 
of 
each 
planet 
(HM V, 
Ch. 
IX 
and 
KGW 6, 
p. 
357). 

268 
Kepler 
has 
given 
numbers 
whose 
ratio 
is 
indicated 
as 
being 
the 
same as the 
ratio 
of 
the 
extreme 
motions 
of 
the 
planet 
concerned. 
In 
table 
5.2 
I 
have 
compared 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
pairs 
of 
numbers 
in 
Kepler's 
new table 
with 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
extreme 
motions 
given 
in 
Book 
V, 
Chapter 
IV 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
312, 
see 
figure 
5.6). 
One must 
presume 
that 
it 
was 
from 
these 
extreme 
motions 
that 
Kepler 
obtained 
the 
ratios 
shown 
in 
figure 
5.11, 
and 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
very 
small 
percentage 
errors 
that 
he 
has 
done 
no violence 
to 
his 
observational 
data 
in 
ob- 
taining 
the 
numbers 
in 
the 
new table, 
simple 
though 
some 
of 
them 
are. 
The 
second 
column 
of 
figures 
in 
Kepler's 
table 
contains 
the 
square 
roots 
of 
the

Area 
Law 
(to 
which 
he 
refers 
in 
the 
accompanying 
text, 
with 
a reference 
to 
Book 
V, 
Chapter 
III, 
part 
XII, 
where 
it 
is 
stated 
in 
the 
appropriate 
form). 
The 
next 
column 
contains 
the 
arith- 
metic 
mean of 
these 
two 
apsidal 
distances, 
that 
is 
the 
semi-major 
axis 
of 
the 
orbit 
(see 
figure 
5.12). 
The 
next 
column 
contains 
the 
linear 
eccentricity, 
that 
is, 
a measure 
of 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
focus 
of 
the 
orbit 
and 
its 
centre, 
the 
numbers 
being 
found 
by subtracting 
the 
number 
in 
the 
previous 
column 
(i. 
e. a) 
from 
the 
larger 
of 
the 
two 
numbers 
in 
the 
column 
before 
that 
(i. 
e. a + ae). 
The 
linear 
eccentricity 
is 
then 
divided 
by 
the 
semi-major 
axis 
to 
give 
the 
true 
eccentricity 
of 
the 
ellipse, 
shown 
in 
the 
last 
column. 
Kepler 
explains 
the 
process 
of 
calculation 
in 
the 
accompanying 
text. 
The 
next 
stage 
is 
to 
calculate 
the 
mean motions 
of 
the 
planets, 
whose 
relation 
to 
the 
extreme 
motions 
has 
been 
given 
in 
Book 
V, 
Chapter 
III, 
part 
XII. 
This 
calculation 
again 
involves 
the 
first 
two 
laws, 
and 
the 
results 
are 
again 
shown 
in 
a table 
(see 
figure 
5.13). 
This 
table 
is 
rather 
more 
elaborate 
than 
the 
previous 
one 
since 
Kepler 
requires 
all 
the 
mean motions 
to 
be on the 
same scale, 
which 
necessitates 
finding 
a set 
of 
numbers 
which 
will 
represent 
the 
ratios 
of 
each 
of 
the 
motions 
to 
every 
one 
of 
the 
others. 
(The 
results 
in 
the 
previous 
table 
were 
pure 
numbers, 
so there 
were 
no problems 
of 
scale. 
) 
The 
mean motions, 
all 
on this 
arbitrary 
common 
scale, 
are 
shown 
in 
the 
last 
column.

attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
numbers 
to 
the 
right 
of 
the 
points 
are 
decimal 
fractions. 
(Kepler 
usually 
uses 
sexagesimal 
fractions 
since 
he is 
dealing 
with 
angular 
measures 
most 
of 
the 
time. 
) 
From 
the 
mean motions, 
Kepler 
calculates 
the 
mean 
dimensions 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs, 
using 
his 
third 
law 
(given 
in 
Book 
V, 
Chapter 
III, 
part 
VIII). 
Since 
he 
has 
already 
found 
the 
eccentricities 
of 
the 
orbits, 
he 
can 
now calculate 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
aphelion 
and 
perihelion 
spheres 
of 
each 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
(see 
figure 
5.14) 
and 
the 
stage 
is 
accordingly 
set 
for 
a comparison 
of 
the 
harmonic 
Archetype 
with 
the 
modified

Comparing 
this 
table 
with 
the 
corresponding 
tables 
for 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
tables 
4.4 
and 
4.5, 
suggests 
that 
Kepler 
modified 
the 
polyhedral 
archetype 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
it 
into 
better 
agreement 
with 
the 
observations, 
but 
only 
succeeded 
to 
a limited 
extent. 
The 
echinus 
gives 
a good 
fit 
to 
the 
aphelion 
sphere 
of 
Venus 
but 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Earth 
continues 
to 
give 
trouble, 
and 
Kepler 
emerges 
from 
his 
cosmological 
skirmishing 
with 
Mercury 
with 
much 
less 
honour 
than 
from 
his 
astronomical 
battle 
with 
Mars. 
He admits, 
in 
fact, 
to 
having 
been 
tempted 
to 
try 
to 
I 
'improve 
the 
agreement 
by 
increasing 
the 
eccentricity 
of 
the 
orbit 
of 
Venus 
and 
decreasing 
that 
of 
the 
orbit 
of 
Mercury. 
This 
gave 
better 
results 
for 
Mercury. 
"But" 
he comments 
"firstly 
I 
could 
not 
defend 
this 
decrease 
on 
harmonic 
grounds, 
for 
the 
new aphelion 
motion 
of 
Mercury 
would 
not 
fit 
into 
any 
Musical 
scale". 
Moreover, 
one 
of 
his 
harmonic 
rules, 
stated 
earlier 
in 
the 
chapter 
as 
an 
axiom 
would 
no longer 
be valid, 
and 
"finally, 
the 
daily 
mean motion 
of 
Mercury 
would 
become 
too 
large, 
and 
its 
period, 
which 
is 
the 
thing 
we know 
most 
accurately, 
would 
be made 
too 
short" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
359,11.38-40, 
p. 
360,11.1-4). 
In 
his 
tabl-e, 
Kepler 
has 
compared 
the 
radii 
found 
from 

275 
the 
polyhedral 
archetype 
with 
those 
found 
from 
the 
harmonic 
one. 
He does 
not 
go on 
to 
compare 
the 
radii 
found 
from 
the 
harmonic 
archetype 
with 
those 
calculated 
more 
directly 
from 
Tycho's 
observations. 
I 
imagine 
that 
he 
probably 
thought 
that 
since 
his 
exact 
harmonic 
ratios 
were, 
as 
we have 
seen, 
very 
close 
to 
the 
"observed" 
ratios 
of 
the 
velocities, 
then 
his 
perihelion 
and 
aphelion 
radii 
would 
be 
similarly 
close 
to 
those 
calculated 
more 
directly. 
In 
fact, 
this 
is 
not 
necessarily 
so 
- 
as 
is 
proved 
in 
any 
good 
lecture 
course 
on Numerical 
Analysis. 
A crude 
example 
is 
as 
follows: 
if 
I 
know 
two 
values 
to 
a 
precision 
of 
about 
three 
figures, 
and 
their 
true 
values 
are 
quite 
close, 
say 
100.4 
(corrected 
to 
100. ) and 
100.6 
(corrected 
to 
101. ), 
then 
if 
I 
take 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
values 
I' know, 
that 
is 
100. 
and 
101., 
I 
get 
1., 
but 
the 
actual 
answer 
should 
be only 
0.2, 
and 
if 
I 
am then 
rash 
enough 
to 
use 
my answer 
later 
as 
a divisor, 
the 
result 
of 
the 
division 
will 
be too 
small 
by 
a factor 
5, 
though 
my first 
two 
numbers 
were 
correct 
to 
1%. 
In 
fact, 
Kepler's 
"harmonic" 
values 
are 
quite 
close 
to 
the 
values 
calculated 
more 
directly 
from 
observations, 
as 
can 
be seen 
from 
the 
first 
three 
columns 
of 
tables 
5.4 
and 
5.5. 
The 
first 
column 
of 
each 
table 
shows 
the 
value 
found 
from 
Tycho's 
observations 
(see 
Bialas, 
1971, 
and 
tables 
4.4 
and 
4.5), 
the 
second 
shows 
the 
corres- 
ponding 
value 
calculated 
from 
the 
harmonic 
archetype, 
and 
the 
third 
column 
shows 
the 
error, 
as 
a percentage 
of 
the 
value 
in 
the 
first 
column. 
For 
interest, 
I 
have 
added 
three 
further 
columns, 
showing 
the 
modern

and 
the

in 
Kepler's 
two 
results 
expressed 
as 
a percentage 
of 
these

It 
will 
be noted 
that 
in 
the 
cases 
marked 
with 
an asterisk, 
that 
is 
for 
the 
perihelia 
of 
Saturn, 
the 
Earth 
and 
Mercury 
and 
the 
aphelia 
of 
Saturn 
and 
the 
Earth 
the 
harmonic 
archetype 
gives 
more 
accurate 
values 
than 
those 
obtained 
by 
direct 
calculation. 
I 
think 
this 
may be due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
harmonic 
method 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
period 
of 
the 
planet, 
which 
is 
known 
with 
a' precision 
unattainable 
for 
other 
elements 
of 
the 
orbits. 
It 
thus 
appears 
that 
in 
some 
cases 
Kepler's 
third 
law 

277 
did, 
indirectly, 
give 
him 
more 
accurate 
dimensions 
for 
the 
orbs, 
though 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
the 
dimensions 
calculated 
from 
harmonies, 
with 
the 
help 
of 
the 
third 
law, 
are 
less 
accurate 
than 
those 
obtained 
more 
directly. 
How- 
ever/all 
the 
differences 
between 
Kepler's 
"observed" 
and 
"harmonic" 
values 
are 
small, 
being 
about 
an 
order 
of 
magnitude 
smaller 
than 
the 
errors 
that 
would 
be accepted 
by 
most 
modern 
cosmologists 
(in 
their 
own 
theories 
if 
not 
always 
in 
those 
of 
others). 
One has 
no need 
to 
suspend 
modern 
standards 
to 
accept 
that 
Kepler's 
conviction 
of 
the 
confirmation 
of 
his 
theory 
by 
observation 
was 
an 
entirely 
reasonable 
one. 
Kepler 
and 
Ptolemy 
The 
work 
with 
which 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V seems 
designed 
to 
be compared 
is, 
of 
course, 
Timaeus, 
though 
Kepler 
himself 
never 
explicitly 
makes 
this 
comparison, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
know. 
He would 
probably 
have 
felt 
it 
to-be 
lese 
Platon 
to 
do so, 
and 
he 
could, 
in 
any 
case, 
be sure 
that 
his 
readers 
would 
be at 
least 
reasonably 
familiar 
with 
Plato's 
work, 
which 
was 
available 
in 
several 
dif- 
ferent 
editions 
by 
1619. 
There 
is, 
however, 
another 
Ancient 
work 
with 
which 
Kepler 
did 
compare 
his 
own, 
namely 
the 
Harmonica 
of 
Ptolemy. 
At 
the 
time 
when 
Kepler 
became 
interested 
in 
Ptolemy's 
Harmonica 
the 
work 
had 
only 
been 
printed 
once, 
in 
a Latin 
translation 
by Gogavinus 
(Venice, 
1562). 
Unfortunately, 
Gogavinus 
had 
worked 
from 
a rather 
corrupt 
Greek 
text 
and 

278 
parts 
of 
his 
translation 
are 
quite 
seriously 
at 
fault 
as 
a result 
(see 
During, 
1932). 
Kepler 
not 
unnaturally 
felt 
that 
he could 
do better 
than 
Gogavinus 
if 
he could 
obtain 
a Greek 
manuscript 
of 
Ptolemy's 
work. 
His, 
eventually 
successful, 
attempts 
to 
do so have 
been 
described 
in 
detail 
by Klein 
(1971). 
However, 
Kepler 
did 
not 
in 
fact 
produce 
the 
promised 
translation. 
I 
think 
that 
the 
reasons 
for 
this 
are 
made 
fairly 
clear 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
III 
and 
in 
the 
appendix 
to 
Book 
V which 
summarises 
Ptolemy's 
work 
and 
compares 
it 
with 
Kepler's 
own. 
It 
appears 
that 
Ptolemy's 
work 
no longer 
seemed 
very 
important 
to 
Kepler 
by 
1618: 
its 
purely 
musical 
content 
had 
been 
developed 
entirely 
competently 
by Zarlino 
and 
others 
(as 
we have 
seen, 
Kepler 
continually 
refers 
to 
Zarlino's 
system 
as being 
Ptolemy's) 
and 
the 
application 
of 
the 
musical 
results 
to 
Astronomy 
and 
Astrology 
was 
indissolubly 
wedded 
to 
the 
Ptolemaic 
description'of 
the 
planetary 
system 
and 
the 
astrological 
ideas 
of 
the 
Tetrabiblos. 
Kepler's 
summary 
of 
Ptolemy's 
work, 
in 
an appendix 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V (KGW 6, 
pp. 
369-373), 
is 
described 
as excellent 
by a modern 
editor 
and 
translator 
of 
the 
Harmonica 
(During, 
1932). 
The 
explanation 
for 
its 
excellence 
is 
clearly 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V Kepler 
had 
worked 
over 
very 
much 
the 
same ground 
as 
Ptolemy, 
though 
from 
a Copernican 
point 
of 
view 
and 
with 
different 
astrological 
beliefs. 
Kepler 
also 
differed 
from 
Ptolemy 
in 
seeking 
the 
origin 
of 
consonances 
in 

279 
Geometry 
rather 
than 
in 
the 
properties 
of 
numbers 
as 
'such. 
All 
these 
differences 
are 
pointed 
out 
explicitly 
in 
Kepler's 
summary 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
372,1.16 
et 
seqq; 
p. 371, 
1.37 
et 
seqq; 
p. 
370,1.17 
et 
seqq) 
and 
one 
can 
hardly 
help 
concluding 
that 
Kepler's 
main 
reason 
for 
not 
com- 
pleting 
his 
translation 
of 
the 
Harmonica 
and 
printing 
it, 
as 
promised, 
as 
an appendix 
to 
his 
own work, 
was 
his 
sense 
that 
the 
Harmonica 
was 
now only 
of 
historical 
interest. 
This 
is 
not, 
however, 
what 
Kepler 
says 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
appendix, 
where 
he apologises 
for 
the 
non-appearance 
of 
the 
translation 
promised 
on the 
initial 
title 
page, 
quoting 
a line 
and 
a half 
of 
Horace 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
"the 
plan 
was 
to 
make 
an amphora 
but 
as 
the 
wheel 
turned 
a pitcher 
emerged 
instead" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
369). 
The 
reasons 
Kepler 
gives 
here 
are 
that 
various 
difficulties 
arose 
and 
that 
his 
time 
was 
much 
taken 
up 
with 
other 
things. 
The 
title 
page 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V had 
promised 
that 
the 
appendix 
to 
Book 
V would 
compare 
Kepler'"s 
work 
not 
only 
with 
the 
Harmonica 
of 
Ptolemy 
but 
also 
with 
the 
"harmonic 
speculations 
of 
Robert 
Fludd, 
found 
in 
his 
work 
on 
the 
Macrocosm 
and 
the 
Microcosm" 
(published 
in 
1617 
and 
1618). 
Kepler 
in 
fact 
fulfilled 
the 
second 
part 
of 
his 
undertaking 
- 
quite 
briefly, 
and 
in 
a manner 
sufficiently 
lacking 
in 
controversialists' 
pyrotechnics 
for 
some 
modern 
historians 
to 
entertain 
the 
suggestion 
that 
Kepler 
himself 
was, 
in 
some 
sense, 
a Rosicrucian 
like 
Fludd. 
Despite 
the 
brevity 
of 
his 
treatment 
of 
Fludd's 
work, 
it 
seems 
to 
me that 
the 
matter 
of 
Kepler's 
relation 
to 
Fludd 

280 
raises 
problems 
of 
a more 
general 
kind 
concerning 
Kepler's 
Natural 
Philosophy, 
and 
I 
shall 
accordingly 
postpone 
my 
discussion 
of 
it 
until 
I 
have 
drawn 
some general 
con- 
clusions 
about 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
ideas, 
in 
my next 
and 
final, 
chapter.

VI 
CONCLUSIONS 
The 
inspiration 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
and 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V is 
clearly 
Platonic, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
in 
both 
works 
Kepler 
sets 
out 
to 
describe 
the 
beautiful 
mathematical 
Archetype 
according 
to 
which 
the 
observable 
Universe 
was 
constructed. 
Substituting 
the 
Christian 
God for 
Plato's 
gods 
and 
demiurges 
as 
the 
power 
behind 
the 
creative 
process 
appears 
to 
raise 
no problems, 
and, 
as we have 
seen, 
Kepler 
even 
goes 
so 
far 
as 
to 
state 
that 
he regards 
Timaeus 
as 
a commentary 
on Genesis 
(HM IV, 
Ch. 
I, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
221, 
see 
Chapter 
I 
above). 
In 
a letter 
to 
Christopher 
Heydon, 
written 
in 
October 
1605, 
Kepler 
was 
equally 
explicit 
about 
the 
source 
of 
the 
mathematical 
basis 
of 
the 
Archetype: 
"Ptolemy 
had 
not 
realised 
that 
there 
was a creator 
of 
the 
world: 
so it 
was not 
for 
him to 
consider 
the 
world's 
archetype, 
which 
lies 
in 
Geometry 
and expressly 
in 
the 
work 
of 
Euclid, 
the 
thrice-greatest 
philosopher 
(et 
nominatim 
in 
Euclide 
philosopho 
ter 
maxima)" 
(Letter 
357, 
lines 
1614-167, 
KGW 15, 
p. 
235) 
The 
choice 
of 
mediator 
between 
Timaeus 
and 
the 
Elements 
is 
hardly 
less 
explicit: 
a long 
quotation 
from 
Proclus' 
Commentary 
on the 
First 
Book 
of 
Euclid's 
Elements 
appears 
in 
the 
original 
Greek 
on the 
title 
page 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I 
and 
a Latin 
version 
of`a 
slightly 
longer 
part 
of 
the 
same 
passage 
is 
to 
be found 
on 
the 
title 
page 
of 
Book 
IV. 
As we have 
seen 
in 
Chapter 
V, 
the 
import 
of 

282 
this 
quotation 
is"that 
the 
study 
of 
mathematical 
truths 
can 
lead 
to 
an understanding 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
physical 
Universe. 
Kepler 
and 
Proclus 
As Caspar 
and 
others 
have 
remarked, 
Kepler 
felt 
particularly 
close 
to 
Proclus 
and makes 
frequent 
referen- 
ces 
to 
his 
works 
(KGW 6, 
note 
to 
p. 
13, 
p. 
520). 
A 
reference 
in 
the 
introduction 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I 
(an 
introduction 
which 
seems 
to 
be intended 
as an intro- 
duction 
to 
the 
work 
as a whole, 
as 
I 
explained 
in 
Chapter 
V) 
shows 
the 
extent 
of 
Kepler's 
respect 
for 
Proclus' 
Commentary 
on Euclid: 
"In 
the 
four 
books 
he published 
on 
the 
first 
book 
of 
Euclid, 
Proclus 
Diadochus 
showed 
how a 
Theoretical 
Philosopher 
should 
treat 
mathematics" 
(KGW 6, p. 
15, 
lines 
16-17). 
Kepler 
then 
expresses 
his 
regret 
that 
Proclus 
has 
not 
left 
a commentary 
on the 
tenth 
book 
of 
the 
Elements. 
I 
Proclus' 
commentaries 
on Euclid 
and 
Plato, 
and 
a 
number 
of 
his 
original 
works 
on subjects 
as various 
as 
Grammar 
and 
Eclipses, 
were 
printed 
in 
Greek 
and 
in 
Latin 
translations 
during 
the 
sixteenth 
and 
early 
seventeenth 
centuries. 
It 
is 
quite 
possible 
that 
Kepler 
came across 
some 
of 
them 
when 
a student 
at 
Tübingen. 
In 
Astronomy, 
particularly 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
signifi- 
cance 
to 
be accorded 
to 
observation, 
Proclus 
undoubtedly 
sees 
himself 
as a staunch 
supporter 
of 
Plato: 
his 
account 

283 
of 
Ptolemy's 
Hypotheses 
even 
starts 
by 
recalling 
Plato's 
advice 
that 
the 
true 
philosopher 
should 
concentrate 
his 
attention 
upon 
an Astronomy 
which 
deals 
in 
absolutes 
(Sambursky, 
1962, 
p. 
146). 
Sambursky 
(1962) 
shows 
Proclus 
as 
taking 
a rather 
harsh 
attitude 
to 
the 
astron- 
omers' 
reliance 
on observations; 
Manitius' 
translations 
of 
the 
passages 
Sambursky 
quotes 
from 
the 
Hypotyposis 
are 
consistently 
rather 
less 
harsh; 
and 
Halma's 
are 
so 
much 
milder 
that 
Proclus' 
final, 
and 
unmistakeable, 
condemnation 
of 
the 
astronomers' 
complicated 
mathematical- 
"fictions" 
seems 
slightly 
jarring. 
Nevertheless, 
there 
appears 
to 
be no reason 
to 
doubt 
that 
Proclus 
regarded 
the 
complicated 
mathematical 
models 
as just 
the 
kind 
of 
unrevealing 
formulation 
one 
would 
expect 
to 
obtain 
by 
unremitting 
devotion 
to 
observation. 
Sambursky 
(1962) 
seems 
to 
take 
this 
as 
a fair 
assessment 
of 
the 
state 
of 
geocentric 
astronomy 
at 
the 
time, 
but 
Kepler 
would 
surely 
have 
noted 
that 
the 
astronomers 
whom Proclus 
condemns 
include 
Aristarchus 
(Proclus 
Hypotyposis, 
I1, 
trans 
Sambursky, 
1962, 
p. 
146, 
passage 
124). 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
both 
in 
the 
Hypotyposis 
and 
in 
the 
short 
passages 
in 
the 
Commentary 
on Timaeus 
which 
relate 
to 
Astronomy 
- 
passages 
to 
which 
Sambursky 
gives 
a harsher 
tone 
than 
that 
to 
be found 
in 
the 
translation 
by 
Festugiere 
Proclus' 
Platonic 
distaste 
for 
complicated 
models 
has 
compelled 
him 
to 
be rather 
dismissive 
about 
astronomical 
observation. 
Plato 
himself 
was 
in 
a happier 
position: 
the 
observations 
available 
in 
the 
fourth 
century 
B. C. were 

284 
sufficiently 
crude 
to 
allow 
him 
to 
construct 
a very 
simple 
mathematical 
explanation 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Sun 
(Timaeus, 
38c 
and 
ff). 
Nevertheless, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
this 
mathematical 
model 
is 
intended 
to 
account 
for 
the 
observations, 
and most 
modern 
scholars 
seem 
to 
agree 
that 
the 
passage 
about 
astronomical 
observation 
in 
the 
Republic 
(Republic 
VII, 
xi, 
530c 
and 
ff) 
should 
not 
be construed 
as advocating 
that 
astronomical 
theories 
should 
be constructed 
without 
recourse 
to 
observation 
(see, 
for 
example, 
Shorey's 
notes 
on this 
passage 
in 
the 
Loeb 
edition 
of 
the 
Republic, 
first 
printed 
in 
1935). 
Since 
modern 
scholars 
have 
come 
to 
this 
conclusion, 
it 
seems 
quite 
reasonable 
to 
suppose 
that 
Kepler 
might 
also 
have 
interpreted 
Plato's 
work 
in 
a similar 
sense, 
and 
have 
felt 
that 
Proclus' 
most 
valuable 
contribution 
to 
Astronomy 
was not 
his 
distrust 
of 
observation 
but 
his 
condemnation 
of 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
mathematical 
fictions 
which 
the 
astronomers 
used 
to 
describe 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
planets, 
thus 
seemingly 
lending 
his 
support 
to 
the 
similar 
criticism 
which 
Copernicus 
was 
to 
make 
a 
thousand 
years 
later. 
Furthermore, 
it 
seems 
possible 
that 
it 
was 
from 
Proclus 
that 
Kepler 
derived 
the 
begin- 
nings 
of 
his 
dislike 
of 
epicycles, 
a dislike 
we have 
seen 
expressed 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
by 
his 
ex- 
cluding 
epicycles 
from 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
(see 
Chapter 
III 
above 
and 
Grafton, 
1973), 
and 
this 
at 
a time 
when, 
as 
Grafton 
(1973) 
has 
shown, 
he was 
still 
dependant 
upon 
Maestlin 
for 
help 
with 
some technical 
matters. 

285 
., Despite 
their 
differences 
in 
regard 
to 
Astronomy, 
it 
is 
nonetheless 
easy 
to 
understand 
why 
Kepler 
should 
have 
admired 
Proclus' 
work: 
Proclus 
shows 
a very 
firm 
grasp 
of 
mathematics 
as well 
as 
ä*deep 
interest 
in 
Plato. 
For 
example, 
the 
Commentary 
on 
the 
First 
Book 
of 
Euclid's 
Elements 
contains 
much 
that 
is 
of 
mathematical, 
as 
opposed 
to 
purely 
philosophical, 
interest, 
though 
the 
mathematical 
contributions 
are 
by 
no means 
always 
original 
to 
Proclus, 
as Heath 
(1921) 
and 
others 
have 
shown. 
Furthermore, 
Proclus 
was 
prepared 
to 
take 
his 
admiration 
of 
Euclid's 
rigour 
to 
the 
length 
of 
adopting 
Euclid's 
'form 
of 
presentation, 
in 
recasting 
two 
books 
of 
Aristotle's 
Physics 
as 
series 
of 
propositions 
and 
proofs 
(Morrow, 
1972, 
p. 
161); 
and 
in 
his 
commentary 
on 
Timaeus 
he gives 
it 
as 
his 
opinion 
that 
Plato 
proceeds 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
geometers, 
since 
before 
giving 
proofs 
he 
provides 
'definitions 
and 
states 
hypotheses, 
and 
before 
embarking 
upon 
the 
study 
of 
Nature 
he 
enunciates 
the 
series 
of 
fundamental 
principles 
that 
will 
be his 
guide 
(Proclus 
trans 
Festugiere, 
1966, 
vol. 
II, 
236.15, 
pp. 
66-67). 
This 
insight 
into 
the 
formal 
equivalence 
of 
mathematical 
and 
logical 
argument 
is 
crucial 
to 
the 
development 
of 
mathematical 
forms 
of 
logic`, 
a highly 
significant 
branch 
of 
modern 
Mathematics1- 
though 
there 
is, 
of 
course, 
no 
need 
to 
suggest 
that 
Boole', 
Frege 
and 
their 
colleagues 
had 
been 
reading 
Proclus' 
`commentary 
on Timaeus. 
Kepler, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
surely-must 
have 
read 
it, 
though 
I 
have-not 
succeeded'in 
finding 
any 
reference 
to 
the 
work 

286 
in 
any 
of 
Kepler's 
writings. 
I 
suspect 
that 
this 
silence 
(if 
it 
truly 
is 
silence) 
is 
to 
be explained 
by the 
fact 
that 
the 
surviving 
fragment 
of 
Proclus' 
commentary 
does 
not 
extend 
to 
the 
part 
of 
Timaeus 
which 
is 
explicitly 
mathematical, 
but 
breaks 
off 
after 
the 
description 
of 
the 
gods' 
creation 
of 
human 
souls 
(! 4E). 
Kepler 
no doubt 
regretted 
that 
Proclus' 
commentary 
did 
not 
include 
the 
mathematical 
part 
of 
Timaeus, 
but 
he was presumably 
spared 
an irritating 
certainty 
that 
falls 
to 
the 
lot 
of 
modern 
scholars: 
it 
has 
been 
shown 
that 
what 
survives 
is 
a fragment 
of 
a commentary 
that 
originally 
went 
right 
to 
the 
end 
of 
Plato's 
work 
(Proclus 
trans 
Festugiere, 
1966, 
vol. 
I, 
Preface, 
pp. 
10-11). 
Kepler's 
admiration 
for 
Euclid 
Trismegistus 
might 
well 
have 
sufficed 
without 
Proclus' 
example 
and 
encouragement, 
but 
it 
is 
notable 
that 
he shows 
a distinct 
preference 
for 
setting 
out 
his 
works 
in 
terms 
of 
definitions, 
axioms, 
propositions 
etc, 
thus 
emphasising 
their 
formal 
relation- 
ship 
to 
mathematics 
proper. 
However, 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
occasionally 
committed 
the 
mathematical 
solecism 
of 
attempting 
to 
prove 
the 
truth 
of 
an axiom, 
for 
example 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
IV 
(see 
Chapter 
V above), 
must, 
I 
think, 
be seen 
as an indication 
that 
in 
some 
cases 
he 
considered 
the 
relationship 
with 
geometers' 
reasoning 
to 
be rather 
superficial. 
His 
real 
purpose 
was, 
after 
all, 
that 
of 
the 
natural 
philosopher, 
as he had 
stated 
in 
the 
introduction 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I: 
"... 
I 
am not 
a Geometer 
working 
on 
[Natural] 
Philosophy, 
but 
a [Natural] 

287 
Philosopher 
working 
on this 
part 
of 
Geometry" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
20, 
lines 
1-2, 
see 
Chapter 
V above). 
Unlike 
the 
geometer, 
the 
philosopher 
is 
free 
to 
question 
his 
basic 
assumptions 
- 
as 
Proclus 
had 
remarked 
in 
his 
commentary 
on Timaeus 
(Proclus 
trans 
Festugiere, 
1966,236.28-237. 
-3, 
vol. 
II, 
p. 
67). 
1-1 
Historians 
have 
drawn 
another 
parallel 
between 
Kepler 
Land Proclus, 
placing 
each 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
tradition 
he 
`represents: 
Proclus 
as 
the 
last 
exponent 
of 
Ancient 
Greek 
Philosophy 
and 
Kepler 
as 
the 
last 
exponent 
of 
a 
form 
of 
mathematical 
cosmology 
that 
can 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
the 
shadowy 
figure 
of 
Pythagoras. 
It 
will, 
I 
imagine, 
be clear 
that 
I do not 
entirely 
accept 
this 
portrayal 
of 
Kepler, 
but 
it 
seems likely 
that 
in 
one respect 
at 
least 
Kepler 
himself 
would 
have 
welcomed 
it: 
he 
too 
seems 
to 
have 
seen 
his 
cosmological 
work 
as 
definitive, 
if 
we may 
judge 
by 
the 
introduction 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V. 
. 
This 
introduction 
begins 
with 
a discussion 
of 
the 
work 
of 
Ptolemy, 
including 
the 
Harmonica, 
before 
going 
on 
to 
describe 
Kepler's 
discovery 
of 
his 
third 
law, 
which, 
as 
we have 
seen 
in 
Chapter 
V, 
had 
given 
him 
the 
tool 
he 
needed 
to 
show 
how the 
observed 
musical 
ratios 
between 
extreme 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets 
could 
determine 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
Solar 
system. 
His 
considerable 
exhilaration 
is 
thus 
understandable 
in 
the 
circumstances. 
The 
paragraph 
ends 
"... 
nothing 
holds 
me back, 
I 
can 
give 
myself 
up 
to 
the 
sacred 
frenzy, 
I 
can 
have 
the 
insolence 
to 
make 
a full 
confession 
to 
mortal 
men that 
I 
have 

288 
stolen 
the 
golden 
vessels 
of 
the 
Egyptians 
to 
make 
from 
them 
a Tabernacle 
for 
my God far 
from 
the 
confines 
of 
the 
land 
of 
Egypt. 
If 
you 
forgive 
me I 
shall 
rejoice; 
if 
you 
are 
angry, 
I 
shall 
bear 
it; 
I 
am indeed 
throwing 
the 
die, 
and writing 
the 
book, 
either 
for 
my contemporaries 
or 
for 
posterity 
to 
read, 
it 
does 
not 
matter 
which: 
let 
the 
book 
await 
its 
reader 
for 
a hundred 
years; 
if 
God himself 
has 
waited 
six 
thousand 
years 
for 
his 
work 
to 
be seen"1. 
Unfortunately, 
having 
led 
its 
army 
over 
the 
Rubicon 
and 
its 
people 
into 
the 
wilderness, 
Kepler's 
theory 
failed 
to 
emerge 
as a useful 
citizen 
of 
the 
promised 
land 
of 
modern 
science. 
Kepler 
and Plato 
Kepler's 
Platonism 
extends 
to 
his 
making 
use 
of 
mathe- 
matical 
arguments 
which 
are 
exactly 
parallel 
to 
the 
1. 
KGW 6, 
p. 
290,11.3-9. 
Kepler's 
reference 
to 
the 
theft 
of 
golden 
vessels 
(vasa 
aurea) 
from 
the 
Egyptians 
presents 
a problem 
for 
readers 
of 
the 
Authorised 
Version 
(1611) 
or 
the 
New English 
Bible 
(1970). 
There 
are 
three 
passages 
in 
Exodus 
which 
refer 
to 
the 
theft 
of 
articles 
made 
of 
gold 
(3.22, 
11.2 
and 
12.35-37), 
and 
the 
articles 
are 
described 
as 
"jewelry". 
However, 
Luther's 
Bible 
(Augsburg, 
1543) 
translates 
"Gefä 
A e" 
("vessels") 
in 
two 
passages 
and 
"Gerate" 
("implements") 
in 
the 
third 
one, 
and 
the 
Greek 
Septuagint 
(Basel, 
1545) 
gives 
cri4do -q , which 
corresponds 
closely 
with 
Kepler's 
vasa, 
which 
can 
mean 
any 
kind 
of 
utensil 
or 
implement. 
There 
appear 
to 
be no alternative 
readings 
of 
the 
original 
Hebrew 
word, 
and 
modern 
scholarship, 
as 
embodied 
in 
the 
Jerusalem 
Bible 
(London, 
1966) 
and 
the 
Hebrew 
and 
English 
Lexicon 
(Brown, 
Driver 
and 
Briggs, 
based 
on Gesenius, 
OUF, 
1907, 
reprinted 
1968), 
endorses 
the 
translations 
given 
by 
the 
Septuagint, 
Luther 
and 
Kepler. 
(I 
should 
like 
to 
thank 
my father, 
Prof. 
E. J. 
Field, 
for 
reading 
the 
Hebrew 
sources 
on 
my behalf. 
) 

289 
arguments 
used 
in 
Timaeus 
to 
establish 
the 
correspon- 
dences 
between 
the 
five 
elements 
and 
the 
five 
regular 
solids. 
We have 
seen 
that 
such 
arguments 
can 
be found 
both 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
and 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V (see 
Chapters 
III 
and 
V above). 
However, 
though 
Kepler's 
arguments 
are 
closely 
similar 
to 
Plato's, 
the 
theories 
they 
are 
designed 
to 
establish 
are 
of 
very 
different 
characters. 
The 
theories 
of 
Timaeus 
seem 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
observable 
Universe 
rather 
obliquely, 
at 
the 
most 
indicating 
the 
mathematical 
lines 
along 
which. 
a 
more 
detailed 
theory 
might 
be constructed 
(see 
Chapter 
I). 
There 
is 
no question 
of 
Plato's 
using 
his 
icosahedral 
forms 
of 
water 
to 
explain 
a measured 
value 
of 
the 
refractive 
index 
of 
ice. 
Kepler, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
does 
use 
his 
theories 
to 
explain 
quantitative 
properties 
of 
the 
observable 
Universe, 
properties 
such 
as 
the 
relative 
dimensions 
of 
the 
orbs 
of 
the 
planets. 
One might, 
perhaps, 
expect 
the 
Ancient 
influence 
to 
be 
seen 
most 
clearly 
in 
Kepler's 
earlier 
work, 
but 
it 
is 
in 
fact 
the 
later 
of 
his 
two 
cosmological 
treatises 
which 
is 
closer 
to 
Timaeus, 
both 
in 
its 
design 
and 
in 
its 
scope. 
Whereas 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
was 
a treatise 
on 
the 
heavens, 
conceived 
as the 
first 
of 
a series 
of 
cosmographic 
works, 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V 
was intended 
to 
deal 
with 
all 
those 
branches 
of 
Natural 
Philosophy 
which 
could 
be 
treated 
mathematically. 
Thus 
the 
earlier 
work 
starts 
in 
a "modern" 
way, 
with 
an exposition 
of 
a limited 
problem, 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs, 
which 
the 
author 
then 

290 
proposes 
to 
solve, 
while 
the 
later 
more 
ambitious 
and 
less 
"modern" 
work, 
being 
concerned 
with 
the 
cosmos 
as 
a whole, 
begins 
with 
mathematical 
fundamentals, 
involving 
two-dimensional 
figures 
as well 
as 
three-dimensional 
ones, 
and 
only 
later 
proceeds 
to 
show 
their 
application 
in 
the 
observed 
Universe. 
In 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Kepler 
had 
decided 
that 
plane 
figures 
should 
be set 
aside, 
and 
an explanation 
of 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
planets 
should 
be constructed 
by 
considering 
the 
properties 
of 
solid 
figures, 
since 
they 
shared 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
Universe 
in 
having 
three 
dimensions 
and 
"it 
is 
fitting 
that 
the 
Idea 
of 
the 
world 
should 
be perfect" 
(Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Chapter 
II, 
KGW 1, p. 
25,11.15-16). 
When the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
was 
published, 
this 
rejection 
of 
plane 
figures 
was marked 
by 
a note 
beginning 
"Oh what 
a mistake" 
(KGW 8, 
p. 
50,1.2, 
see 
Chapter 
IV 
above). 
The 
note 
went 
on to 
point 
out 
that 
plane 
figures 
must 
be considered, 
because 
God himself 
had 
employed 
plane 
figures 
in 
the 
Universe: 
the 
orbits 
of 
the 
planets 
are 
plane 
curves. 
Thus, 
in 
1621, 
Kepler 
opposes 
a physical 
reason, 
that 
is 
a reason 
relating 
to 
an observed 
property 
of 
the 
Universe, 
to 
his 
earlier 
metaphysical 
preference 
for 
three-dimensional 
figures. 
However, 
he makes 
no attempt 
to 
answer 
the 
physical 
reason 
for 
using 
solid 
figures 
which 
he had 
put 
forward 
in 
the 
original 
preface 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a question 
and 
answer: 
"Why 
should 
there 
be 

291 
plane 
figures 
between 
solid 
orbs? 
Solid 
bodies 
would 
be 
more 
appropriate" 
(KGW. 1, 
p. 
13,11.5-6). 
This 
concern 
to 
take 
account 
of 
the 
dimensionality 
of 
the 
problem 
under 
consideration 
seems 
to 
be character- 
istic 
of 
Kepler's 
thought. 
We find 
an 
example 
of 
it 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
III, 
where 
Kepler 
states 
it 
more 
or 
less 
as 
a principle 
that 
the 
integers 
cannot 
explain 
musical 
consonances 
because 
(being 
dimensionless) 
they 
do 
not 
correspond 
to 
anything 
physical 
(see 
Chapter 
V 
above). 
In 
modern 
terms, 
this 
argument 
is 
fallacious, 
because 
the 
consonances 
are 
represented 
by 
ratios 
of 
lengths, 
and 
since 
both 
terms 
of 
the 
ratio 
have 
the 
same 
dimensionality 
the 
ratios 
themselves 
are 
dimensionless. 
Kepler's 
line 
of 
reasoning 
suggests 
that 
in 
this 
passage, 
as in 
others 
(see 
Chapter 
V above) 
he is 
following 
the 
Ancient 
Greek 
usage 
of 
regarding 
integers 
as 
numbers 
proper 
and 
treating 
rational 
numbers 
'(that 
is, 
numbers 
expressible 
in 
the 
form 
a/b 
where 
a and 
b are 
integers) 
as 
if 
they 
were 
ratios. 
Such 
ideas 
might 
perhaps 
lead 
him 
to 
consider 
the 
dimensionality 
of 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
ratio 
rather 
than 
that 
of 
the 
ratio 
itself, 
making 
ratios 
of 
integers 
seem 
to 
have 
a different 
dimensionality 
from 
ratios 
of 
lengths. 
There 
is 
a happier 
example 
of 
Kepler's 
concern 
with 
dimensionality 
in 
De Nive 
Sexangula 
(Prague, 
1611) 
where 
he insistently 
looks 
for 
a three-dimensional 
cause 
for 
the 
snowflake, 
since 
it 
comes 
into 
being 
in 
three-dimensional 
space. 
This 
contrasts 
sharply 
with 
Descartes' 
willingness 
to 
regard 
the 
hexagonal 
shapes 
as 

292 
fragments 
of 
a flat 
sheet, 
their 
shapes 
being 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
regular 
hexagons 
will 
form 
a plane 
tessellation 
(Descartes, 
Les 
Meteores, 
Leyden, 
1637, 
Discours 
VI), 
an explanation 
Kepler 
explicitly 
excludes 
(De Nive 
Sexangula, 
p. 
23, 
KGW 4, 
p. 
279,11.14-15). 
The contrast 
is 
made 
the 
more 
striking 
by the 
fact 
that 
whereas 
Kepler 
appears 
to 
believe 
that 
all 
snow 
crystals 
are 
flat, 
Descartes 
describes 
and 
illustrates 
columnar 
crystals 
of 
snow 
(see 
figure 
6.1).

Despite 
this 
concern 
with 
dimensionality, 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V Kepler 
follows 
the 
example 
of 
Timäeus 
in 
using 
the 
properties 
of 
plane 
figures 
as a basis 
for 
his 
mathematical 
theory, 
though 
instead 
of 
Plato's 
triangles, 
which 
were 
introduced 
as 
being 
the 
simplest 
of 
polygons, 
Kepler 
considers 
the 
circle, 
the 
plane 
analogue 
of 
the 
simplest, 
and 
therefore 
noblest, 
of 
all 
mathematical 
figures, 
the 
sphere. 
The 
chosen 
figures 
are 
different, 
and 
Kepler 
goes 
on to 
consider 
not 
the 
properties 
of 
the 

293 
circle 
itself 
but 
its 
relationship 
to 
figures 
derived 
from 
it 
and 
relationships 
among 
these 
figures 
themselves, 
but 
the 
principle 
embodied 
in 
the 
choice 
is 
the 
same: 
to 
start 
with 
the 
most 
fundamental 
mathematical 
figure. 
The 
two-dimensional 
geometry 
of 
the 
first 
two 
books 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V is, 
in 
fact, 
applied 
to 
two-dimensional 
problems: 
the 
generation 
of 
musical 
ratios 
among 
the 
arcs 
of 
circles 
and 
the 
generation 
of 
plane 
angles 
that' 
correspond 
to 
astrological 
Aspects. 
As 
I 
explained 
above, 
the 
problem 
of 
generating 
musical 
ratios 
is, 
in 
principle, 
dimensionless, 
but 
Kepler 
regarded 
it 
as 
involving 
lengths, 
and 
treated 
it 
as 
the 
problem 
of 
dividing 
a line 
in 
certain 
ratios. 
Now, 
it 
is 
a mathematical 
necessity 
that 
some 
curve, 
rather 
than 
a straight 
line, 
shall 
be the 
subject 
of 
the 
proposed 
division, 
since 
we require 
that 
there 
shall 
be a limit 
to 
the 
number 
of 
forms 
of 
division 
that 
may 
be obtained 
(there 
being 
a limit 
to 
the 
number 
of 
consonances), 
and 
there 
is 
no such 
limit 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
division 
of 
straight 
lines. 
For, 
by Proposition 
9 of 
Book 
VI 
of 
the 
Elements, 
an nth 
part 
can 
be cut 
off 
from 
any 
straight 
line, 
where 
n is 
any 
integer 
(Euclid 
trans 
Heath, 
1956, 
vol. 
II, 
p. 
211), 
and 
it 
can 
easily 
be 
shown 
that 
it 
follows 
that 
a straight 
line 
can be divided 
in 
any given 
rational 
ratio, 
i. e. 
in 
any 
ratio 
that 
can 
be expressed 
in 
the 
form 
a: b where 
both 
a and 
b are 
integers. 
There 
is 
thus 
no geometrical 
distinction 
between 
the 
problem 
of 
dividing 
a straight 
line 
in 
the 
ratio 
1: 2, 
producing 

294 
parts 
which 
show 
the 
"musical" 
ratios 
1: 2 and 
2: 3, 
and 
the 
problem 
of 
dividing 
the 
same line 
in 
the 
ratio 
17: 19, 
which 
would 
give 
"non-musical" 
parts. 
However, 
as Kepler 
showed 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
I, 
the 
analogous 
problem 
for 
the 
circle, 
namely 
the 
problem 
of 
dividing 
it 
up into 
different 
numbers 
of 
equal 
arcs, 
which 
is 
equivalent 
to 
constructing 
the 
sides 
of 
regular 
polygons 
inscribed 
in 
it, 
is 
very 
much more 
productive 
of 
possible 
geometrical 
distinctions. 
Moreover, 
the 
connection 
of 
consonances 
with 
the 
circle, 
specifically 
with 
the 
circle 
of 
the 
Zodiac, 
had 
been 
in 
Kepler's 
mind 
for 
some time: 
we have 
seen 
that 
his 
discussions 
of 
consonances 
and 
Aspects 
in 
the 
years 
immediately 
following 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
tended 
to 
use 
the 
numeric- 
al 
entities 
to 
explain 
the 
astrological 
ones 
(see 
Chapter 
V above). 
The 
idea 
that 
the 
arcs 
of 
the 
Zodiac 
corres- 
ponding 
to 
the 
angular 
distance 
between 
two 
bodies 
at 
Aspect 
were 
connected 
in 
some way with 
musical 
con- 
sonances 
is, 
in 
fact, 
to 
be found 
in 
Ptolemy's 
Harmonica 
(Book 
III, 
Chapter 
9) 
as Kepler 
remarked 
in 
his 
discus- 
sion 
of 
Ptolemy's 
work 
in 
the 
Appendix 
to 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V (KGW 6, 
p. 
371,1.38). 
The 
three-dimensional 
problem 
of 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
planetary 
spheres 
is 
treated 
very 
similarly 
in 
both 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
works. 
Since 
this 
problem 
is 
the 
main 
subject-matter 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
and 
since, 
as we have 
seen, 
Kepler 
continued 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
solution 
proposed 
to 
it 
in 
that 
work 
was 
substantially 

295 
correct, 
there 
was 
no need 
for 
him 
to 
go 
over 
all 
the 
same 
ground 
again 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V. 
His 
treatment 
of 
the 
matter 
in 
the 
later 
work 
is 
therefore 
quite 
brief; 
there 
is 
a rapid 
sketch 
of 
the 
theory 
in 
the 
comment 
following 
the 
proof 
that 
there 
are 
only 
five 
convex 
regular 
polyhedra, 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
section 
XXV, 
and 
a slightly 
fuller 
description 
of 
it 
appears 
in 
the 
summary 
of 
astronomical 
results 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V Chapter 
III. 
However, 
the 
theory 
is 
not 
actually 
applied 
in 
the 
simple 
form 
that 
is 
described 
in 
these 
passages. 
Instead, 
as we have 
seen 
in 
Chapter 
V, 
Kepler 
produces 
a modified 
form 
of 
it 
as 
a 
proposition 
near 
the 
end 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V 
Chapter 
IX. 
This 
modified 
form 
is 
not 
only 
slightly 
more 
complicated 
than 
the 
original 
one, 
but 
also 
lacks 
some 
of 
its 
power, 
since 
it 
does 
not 
always 
permit 
an exact 
calculation 
of 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
aphelion 
sphere 
of 
a 
lower 
planet 
from 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
perihelion 
sphere 
of 
the 
planet 
immediately 
above 
it. 
This 
weakening 
of 
the 
theory 
is 
not, 
however, 
crucial, 
for 
Kepler 
no longer 
has 
to 
rely 
upon 
the 
polyhedra 
as 
providing 
the 
Creator's 
sole 
Archetype: 
musical 
ratios 
among 
the 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets 
provide 
further 
criteria 
for 
making 
the 
Universe 
as 
beautiful 
as 
possible. 
Kepler's 
final 
theory 
may seem 
to 
be over-defined, 
because, 
thanks 
to 
the 
third 
law, 
the 
musical 
ratios 
can 
be 
seen 
as 
determining 
the 
relative 
sizes 
of 
the 
outer 
and- 
inner 
surfaces 
of 
the 
orbs 
of 
the 
system 
of 
planets 

296 
(i. 
e. 
perihelion 
and aphelion 
distances) 
as well 
as 
the 
thickness 
of 
each 
orb 
(i. 
e. 
the 
eccentricity 
of 
the 
orbital 
ellipse 
. which 
can 
be found 
without 
using 
the 
third 
law). 
The apparent 
superseding 
of 
the 
polyhedral 
Archetype 
by the 
musical 
one 
is 
lent 
further 
colour 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
Kepler 
explains 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
each 
musical 
ratio 
to 
the 
particular 
pair 
of 
velocities 
between 
which 
it 
is 
observed. 
However, 
as we have 
seen 
in 
Chapter 
V, 
most 
of 
the 
proofs 
of 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
musical 
ratios 
found 
among 
the 
extreme 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets 
depend, 
more 
or 
less 
directly, 
upon 
the 
geometrical 
properties 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
associated 
with 
the 
spaces 
between 
particular 
pairs 
of 
neighbouring 
planets. 
As we have 
seen, 
Kepler 
regarded 
these 
associa- 
tions 
as well-established: 
they 
were 
philosophically 
satisfactory 
and 
in 
reasonably 
good 
agreement 
with 
observation. 
He therefore 
felt 
able 
to 
derive 
part 
of 
his 
justification 
of 
the 
exact 
form 
of 
his 
musical 
Archetype 
from 
a consideration 
of 
the 
polyhedral 
Archetype. 
The 
remaining 
elements 
in 
the 
justification 
belong 
to 
Music 
Theory 
proper, 
but 
since, 
as we have 
seen, 
this 
too 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
be derived 
from 
geometrical 
results, 
the 
whole 
theory 
may be seen 
as 
entirely 
based 
upon 
Geometry. 
The mathematical 
justification 
of 
the 
musical 
Archetype, 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V Chapter 
IX, 
is 
lengthier 
than 
the 
mathematical 
justification 
of 
the 
polyhedral 
Archetype, 
in 
Chapters 
III 
to VIII 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
because 
there 
are 
many 
more 

297 
ratios 
between 
velocities 
than 
there 
are 
spaces 
between 
planetary 
orbs, 
and 
the 
style 
in 
which 
the 
material 
is 
presented 
resembles 
the 
Elements 
rather 
than 
Timaeus, 
but 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
passages 
is 
clearly 
the 
same: 
to 
- 
establish 
the 
mathematical 
coherence 
of 
the 
proposed 
Archetype, 
by explaining 
every 
element 
that 
might 
perhaps 
have 
appeared 
to 
be arbitrary. 
There 
seems 
to 
be no logical 
reason 
why 
there 
should 
be 
only 
one most 
beautiful 
Archetype, 
but 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V as 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
Kepler 
is 
clearly 
determined 
that 
his 
Platonic 
Creator, 
com- 
mitted 
as He is 
to 
creating 
the 
most 
beautiful 
of 
all 
possible 
Worlds, 
shall 
exercise 
no 
choice. 
This 
theological 
formulation 
seems 
the 
most 
natural 
one, 
since 
Kepler 
is 
concerned 
with 
an Archetype, 
but 
he is, 
of 
course, 
deducing 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
Archetype 
from 
a 
mathematical 
description 
of 
the 
present 
state 
of 
the 
observable 
Universe, 
and 
his 
tacit 
insistence 
upon 
the 
uniqueness 
of 
the 
Archetype 
is, 
in 
effect, 
equivalent 
to 
making 
the 
demand 
that 
there 
shall 
be a uniquely- 
determined 
mathematical 
cosmological 
theory 
which 
gives 
a coherent 
account 
of 
all 
the 
observations. 
In 
the 
first 
chapter 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
he had 
stated 
explicitly 
that 
he believed 
such 
a demand could 
be 
fulfilled 
in 
relation 
to 
astronomical 
theories.

Kepler's 
use 
of 
observations 
Kepler 
explains 
in 
his 
preface 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
that 
the 
observational 
evidence 
which 
suggested 
the 
polyhedral 
Archetype 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
were 
six 
planets 
(in 
the 
Copernican 
description 
of 
the 
planetary 
system) 
(see 
Chapter 
III 
above). 
The 
musical 
Archetype 
described 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V 
has 
rather 
more 
complicated 
observational 
origins, 
being 
suggested 
(in 
principle 
if 
not 
in 
fact) 
by 
the 
"observation" 
of 
musical 
ratios 
among 
extreme 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets. 
Since 
it 
is 
constructed 
from 
observed 
values 
of 
these 
ratios 
it 
cannot 
be tested 
against 
them 
in 
the 
way 
that 
the 
polyhedral 
Archetype 
was 
tested 
against 
the 
"observed" 
radii 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs. 
However, 
Kepler 
is 
at 
considerable 
pains 
to 
establish 
that 
he has 
done 
no violence 
to 
the 
observations 
in 
identifying 
the 
musical 
ratios 
from 
which 
the 
Archetype 
is 
constructed. 
Indeed, 
he is 
so scrupulous 
in 
noting 
where 
he has 
adjusted 
the 
"observed" 
figures 
that 
at 
least 
one 
historian 
has 
supposed 
that 
the 
adjustment 
must 
have 
been 
significant 
(Koyre, 
1961, 
p. 
342) 
whereas 
it 
turns 
out 
to 
have 
been 
very 
small 
by modern 
standards 
(see 
Chapter 
V, 
table 
5.2). 
It 
is 
not, 
however, 
clear 
what 
standards 
Kepler 
himself 
was 
applying. 
It 
is 
well 
established 
that 
Kepler's 
concept 
of 
observational 
error 
was 
substantially 
the 
same as the 
modern 
one, 
in 
that 
it 
led 
him 
to 
reject 
a calculated 

299 
orbit 
as 
inadequate 
because 
it 
failed 
to 
describe 
the 
position 
of 
the 
planet 
to 
within 
the 
margin 
of 
error 
claimed 
for 
the 
observed 
tion. 
1 
Nevertheless, 
we 
should 
note 
that 
this 
particular 
form 
of 
comparison 
between 
"theory" 
and 
"observation" 
is 
a very 
simple 
one, 
since 
the 
theory 
in 
question 
(a 
suggested 
orbit) 
leads 
directly 
to 
a result 
which 
can 
be checked 
against 
observation 
(a 
planetary 
position). 
The 
cosmological 
theories 
embodied 
in 
Kepler's 
polyhedral 
and 
musical 
Archetypes 
do not 
yield 
directly 
observable 
quantities 
in 
this 
straightforward 
way. 
Moreover, 
since 
the 
Archetypes 
refer 
to 
the 
overall 
structure 
of 
the 
Solar 
system 
they 
are 
essentially 
no more 
than 
descriptive 
- 
though 
there 
is 
no doubt 
that 
Kepler 
himself 
saw 
them 
as 
existing 
before 
the 
Universe 
was 
created 
(being 
mathematical 
Ideas 
and 
therefore 
coeternal 
with 
God) 
and 
thus 
as having 
the 
power 
to 
determine 
the, 
then 
future, 
structure 
of 
the 
material 
Universe. 
So for 
Kepler 
the 
Archetypes 
predicted 
this 
structure 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
a planetary 
orbit 
predicted 
positions 
of 
the 
planet. 
However, 
once 
the 
Universe 
has 
been 
created, 
the 
Archetypes 
are 
purely 
descriptive 
and 
can 
be 
checked 
against 
observation 
only 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
checking 
that 
they 
give 
an adequately 
accurate 
description 
of 
what 
is 
observed 
or 
deduced 
from 
observation.

This 
rather 
unsatisfactory 
descriptive 
character 
is 
also 
a feature 
of 
modern 
cosmological 
theories. 
Like 
Kepler's 
Archetypes 
they 
too 
deal 
with 
ä very 
limited 
range 
of 
"facts", 
which 
are 
at 
several 
removes 
from 
direct 
observation 
- 
for 
example, 
they 
are 
expected 
to 
"predict" 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
Universe 
and 
assign 
a value 
to 
Hubble's 
constant 
(the 
measure 
of 
the 
rate 
of 
ex- 
pansion) 
whose 
"observed" 
value 
seems 
to 
lie 
somewhere 
between 
50 and 
120 km per 
sec 
per 
kiloparsec 
(at 
the 
time 
of 
writing, 
i. e. 
November 
1980). 
Kepler's 
Archetypes 
similarly 
deal 
in 
quantities 
which 
are 
not 
directly 
observable, 
namely 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbits 
and 
the 
ratios 
of 
extreme 
velocities 
of 
the 
planets. 
The greatest 
contrast 
between 
Kepler 
and his 
modern 
counterparts 
lies 
in 
the 
degree 
of 
agreement 
they 
expect 
to 
find 
when 
the 
"predictions" 
of 
their 
theories 
are 
compared 
with 
"observed" 
values. 
Modern 
cosmölo- 
gists 
regularly 
accept 
large 
errors, 
such 
as 50% or 
a 
factor 
of 
three 
either 
way, 
partly 
because 
they 
recognise 
that 
the 
numerical 
values 
they 
are 
attempting 
to 
explain 
are 
not 
very 
precisely 
determined, 
and 
partly 
because 
no 
modern 
cosmological 
model 
has 
ever 
produced 
more 
accurate 
results. 
Kepler, 
on the 
other 
hand, 
believed 
(correctly, 
as 
it 
turned 
out) 
that 
he was 
dealing 
with 
well-determined 
quantities; 
and 
his 
success 
in 
formulating 
astronomical 
laws 
which 
gave 
very 
accurate 
accounts 
of 
the 
observational 
data 
presumably 
encouraged 
him 
to 
believe 
that 
a cosmo- 
logical 
theory 
might 
aspire 
to 
equal 
accuracy. 
However, 

301 
assessing 
the 
degree 
'of 
accuracy 
attained 
was 
no 
simple 
matter, 
When he wrote 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
Kepler 
found 
himself 
in 
a situation 
rather 
like 
that 
of 
his 
twentieth- 
century 
counterparts 
- 
and 
reacted 
to 
it 
in 
much 
the 
same 
way. 
He was 
aware 
that 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
were 
not 
very 
accurately 
determined 
and 
he noted, 
without 
undue 
emphasis, 
that 
his 
theory 
did 
not 
agree 
with 
them 
very 
closely 
in 
all 
cases. 
Tycho's 
observations 
modified 
this 
situation 
by allowing 
Kepler 
to 
calculate 
more 
accurate 
values 
for 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs. 
In 
fact, 
as Bialas 
(1971) 
has 
shown, 
Kepler's 
values 
for 
the 
major 
axes 
and 
eccentricities 
of 
the 
orbits 
are 
very 
äccurate 
indeed 
(that 
!, is, 
they, lare 
in 
excellent 
agre- 
ement 
with 
the 
results 
of 
modern 
calculations 
of 
the 
values 
of 
these 
elements 
in 
1600, 
see 
Chapter 
IV 
above), 
but 
Kepler 
himself 
had 
no way 
of 
knowing 
how much 
more 
accurate 
his 
newly-calculated 
dimensions 
were. 
Never- 
theless, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
since 
he 
believed 
his 
new 
dimensions 
to 
be considerably 
more 
accurate 
than 
those 
he 
had 
used 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
he 
expected 
that 
they 
would 
be correspondingly 
closer 
to 
the 
theore- 
tical 
values 
calculated 
from 
the-polyhedral 
Archetype, 
if 
this 
had 
truly 
been 
the' 
Archetype 
God had 
used 
in 
creating 
the 
Universe. 
Since 
it 
turned'out 
that 
the 
agreement 
between 
theory 
and 
observation 
was 
not 
much 
changed 
by 
using 
the 
new more 
accurate 
orbits, 
Kepler 
set 
about 
modifying 
his 
theory. 

302 
The new, 
musical, 
Archetype, 
like 
the 
polyhedral 
Archetype, 
shows 
clear 
affinities 
to 
the 
true 
ancestor 
of 
both 
theories: 
the 
geometrical 
archetype 
of 
Timaeus. 
It 
is 
less 
obvious, 
but 
at 
least 
equally 
important, 
that 
the 
later, 
musical, 
Archetype 
shows 
an affinity 
to 
Kepler's 
astronomical 
theories, 
in 
fitting 
very 
closely 
with 
observational 
data. 
The 
temptation 
to 
cheat 
was 
certainly 
present 
- as we have 
seen 
in 
Kepler's 
comments 
on the 
orbit 
of 
Mercury 
at 
the 
very 
end 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V Chapter 
IX 
(see 
Chapter 
V above) 
- but 
Kepler 
seems 
always 
to 
have 
resisted 
it. 
It 
is 
exactly 
this 
concern 
with 
the 
observable 
world 
that 
Kepler 
mentions 
as epitomising 
the 
difference 
between 
his 
own Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V and 
Robert 
Fludd's 
Utriusque.... 
Cosmi 
Historia 
(Oppenheim, 
1617 
and 
1618): 
"So 
for 
him 
it 
is 
his 
conception 
of 
the 
World, 
and 
for 
me the World 
itself, 
or 
the 
real 
motions 
of 
the 
Planets 
in 
it, 
which 
are 
the 
subject 
of World 
Harmony" 
(HM App, 
KGW 6, 
P. 
377,11.1-3). 
Kepler 
and 
Fludd 
Kepler 
compares 
his 
work 
with 
Fludd's 
in 
the 
four 
final 
pages 
of 
the 
Appendix 
to Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book V. 
It 
should 
perhaps 
be noted 
that 
since 
the 
length 
of 
Kepler's 
work 
is 
about 
three 
hundred 
pages 
and 
the 
total 
length 
of 
the 
first 
two 
parts 
of 
Fludd's 
(with 
which 
the 
comparison 
is 
made) 
is 
about 
nine 
hundred 
and 
ninety 

`303 
pages, 
Kepler 
is 
contenting 
himself 
with 
a very 
brief 
analysis. 
He begins 
by 
describing 
the 
structure 
of 
Fludd's 
work 
and 
indicating 
which 
passages 
of 
it 
relate 
to 
matters 
that 
are 
also 
considered 
inAHarmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V. 
The 
plan 
of 
Fludd's 
work 
is, 
fairly 
intricate, 
but 
Kepler's 
references 
are 
sufficiently 
detailed 
to 
allow 
a determined 
reader 
to 
locate 
the 
particular 
passages 
under 
discussion. 
They 
mainly 
concern 
"artificial 
music", 
that 
is 
man-made 
music, 
which 
Fludd 
considers 
in 
his 
second 
book, 
Utriusque 
.. Cosmi Historia, 
=Tractatus 
II. 
(Oppenheim, 
1618), 
and 
"world 
music", 
which'is 
considered 
in, 
the 
first 
book 
(Oppenheim, 
1617). 
Fludd's, 
ordering 
of 
these 
topics 
differs 
from 
Kepler's 
and 
seems 
to 
reflect 
an 
important 
`,. divergence 
in 
outlook: 
whereas-Kepler 
explains 
music 
theory 
in 
considerable' 
detail 
(in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
III) 
and 
then 
goes 
onýtoýdemonstrate 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
celestial 
counterpart 
to 
human 
music 
(in 
Book 
V), 
Fludd 
first 
gives 
a brief 
description'of 
a very 
elementary 
form 
5_ 
of 
heavenly 
harmony 
(doing 
little 
more 
than 
identify 
"musical" 
ratios 
among 
the 
radii 
of 
various 
spheres 
in 
the 
Elemental, 
Celestial 
and 
Empyrean 
regions, 
see 
figure 
6.2), 
and 
deals 
with'. ýmusic 
theory 
as 
a purely 
microcosmic 
phenomenon, 
going 
into 
considerable 
practical 
detail. 
Kepler's 
criticism-. 
takes 
thertwo 
forms 
of 
music 
in 
his 
own order, 
starting 
with 
the 
"artificial", 
which 
includes 
the 
theory 
of 
music.

in

upon

an 
opinion 
that 
he, 
Kepler, 
refuted 
in 
his 
own Book 
III, 
Chapter 
IV. 
He 
remarks 
that 
Fludd's 
work 
is 
unlike 
his 
own as 
"a 
Prac- 
titioner 
differs 
from 
a Theoretician, 
for 
where 
he 
deals 
with 
instruments 
I 
inquire 
into 
the 
causes 
of 
things 
or 
consonances" 
(HM App, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
374,11.12-14). 
This 
comment 
appears 
to 
be 
just, 
and 
to 
touch 
upon 
an 
important 
point 
of 
difference 
between 
the 
works 
as 
a whole: 
Fludd's 
piece 
on "artificial 
music" 
is 
a condensed 
version 
of 
a musical 
textbook, 
such 
as 
Vincenzo 
Galilei's 
Dialogo 
(Florence, 
1581), 
whereas 
Kepler's 
piece, 
apart 
from 
being 
more 
purely 
theoretical'(that 
is, 
consisting 
almost 
entirely 
of mathematics), 
is 
conceived 
as a section 
of 
an argument 
rather 
than 
as 
an article 
in 
an 
encyclopedia. 
As Kepler 
put 
it: 
"In 
a word, 
in 
the 
study 
of 
Harmony, 
one 
of 
us 
shows 
himself 
a Musician, 
vocal 
and 
Instru- 
mental; 
the 
other 
a philosopher 
and 
Mathematician" 
(KGW 6, p. 374,11.32-35). 
After 
this 
summary Kepler 
turns 
to 
the 
part 
of 
Fludd's 
work 
"in 
which 
he introduces 
Music 
into 
the 
World", 
prefacing 
his 
discussion 
with 
the 
statement 
that 
"Here 
there 
is 
a vast 
difference 
between 
us" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
374, 
1.36). 
For 
example, 
Kepler 
correctly 
points 
out 
that 
Fludd's 
music 
concerns 
all 
three 
parts 
of 
the 
World 
- 
the 
Empyrean, 
the 
Celestial 
and the 
Elemental 
- whereas 

306 
his 
own concerns 
"only 
the 
celestial, 
and 
not 
even 
all 
of 
that 
but 
only 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
planets 
as 
it 
were 
beneath 
the 
Zodiac" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
375,1.24). 
Moreover, 
as 
Kepler 
says, 
Fludd 
adheres 
to 
the 
Ancient 
belief 
that 
"the 
force 
of 
harmonies 
is 
derived 
from 
pure 
numbers" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
375,1.26), 
whereas 
Kepler 
asks 
what 
the 
numbers 
measure. 
Furthermore, 
Kepler 
correctly 
notes 
that 
Fludd 
obtains 
the 
radii 
of 
his 
three 
regions 
of 
the 
World 
by merely 
asserting 
that 
the 
total 
radius 
must 
be 
divided 
into 
three 
equal 
parts, 
whereas 
he, 
Kepler, 
uses 
astronomical 
measurements 
to 
find 
the 
dimensions 
with 
which 
he is 
concerned 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
375,11.32-39). 
This 
use 
of 
assertion 
rather 
than 
an appeal 
to 
technical 
astronomy 
extends 
to 
Fludd's 
description 
of 
the 
planetary 
system, 
the 
only 
part 
of 
the 
World 
for 
which 
observational 
measurements 
were 
available. 
Fludd's 
planetary 
system 
is 
geocentric, 
and 
shows 
all 
the 
planetary 
spheres 
as 
being 
of 
equal 
thickness. 
This 
is, 
of 
course, 
conven- 
tional 
in 
expositions 
of 
Ptolemaic 
cosmology, 
and 
Copernicus 
follows 
the 
same 
convention 
in 
De Revolutionibus 
(see 
Chapter 
III 
above). 
However, 
Fludd 
seems 
disposed 
to 
take 
these 
equal 
dimensions 
quite 
seriously, 
for 
he 
marks 
them 
on his 
Universal 
Monochord 
(see 
figure 
6.2), 
and 
it 
is 
necessary 
for 
his 
system 
of 
harmonies 
that 
the 
Sun 
shall 
lie 
exactly 
half-way 
between 
the 
two 
boundaries 
of 
the 
celestial 
region. 
Moreover, 
Fludd 
has 
retained 
the 
Ptolemaic 
ordering 
of 
the 
planets, 
which, 
by 
the 
time 
his 
diagrams 
were 
published, 
in 
1617, 
had 
been 
rendered 
ýý 
a ý'

r 
F

307 
untenable 
by Galileo's 
observation 
that 
Venus 
showed 
phases 
like 
those 
of 
the 
Moon 
(1613). 
Kepler 
does 
not 
comment 
on Fludd's 
planetary 
system, 
possibly 
because 
he 
regarded 
the 
illustrations 
of 
it 
as 
further 
examples 
of 
what, 
in 
the 
section 
on man-made 
music, 
he had 
called 
Fludd's 
"pictures", 
contrasting 
them 
with 
his 
own "math- 
ematical 
diagrams 
with 
letters 
on 
them" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
3714, 
11.17-18). 
Kepler 
goes 
on 
to 
give 
a fairly 
detailed 
account 
of 
the 
. mathematical 
processes 
by which 
Fludd 
obtains 
his 
divi- 
sions 
of 
the 
World 
- 
for 
example 
by 
considering 
inter- 
secting 
pyramids 
of 
light 
and 
darkness. 
The 
one 
quotation 
of 
Fludd's 
actual 
words 
is 
somewhat 
startling. 
Kepler 
says 
"Nor 
does 
it 
diminish 
the 
diversity 
between 
us 
that 
he ascribes 
four 
degrees 
of 
obscurity 
and 
darkness 
to 
the 
Elemental 
region 
because 
any 
thing, 
he says, 
has 
four 
quarters, 
certainly 
no less 
so 
than 
three 
thirds, 
and 
-five 
fifths:... 
" 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
376,11.19-22). 
Readers 
imbued 
with 
learned 
incredulity 
may be glad 
to 
know 
that 
the 
passage 
which 
begins 
on the 
eighth 
line 
of 
Utriusque 
.. Cosmi Historia, 
Tractatus 
I, 
Book III, 
Chapter 
II 
reads 
"ideo 
necesse 
est, 
ut 
interiores 
terrae 
partes, 
cum 
quaelibet 
res 
ex 
quatuor 
quartis 
componatur, 
quatuor 
frigiditatis 
testimonia 
ob integram 
lucis 
absentiam 
retineant 
et 
possedeant" 
(Utriusque.... 
Cosmi 
Historia, 
p. 
82). 
Kepler 
has 
presumably 
quoted 
from 
memory 
since 
he makes 
a slight 
error 
in 
the 
words 
he quotes, 
but 
he has 
not 
deformed 
the 
sense: 
Fludd 
goes 
on. to 
ascribe 
three- 

308 
fold 
darkness 
to 
water, 
two-fold 
to 
air 
and 
only 
a single 
measure 
to 
fire. 
Moreover, 
the 
chapter 
from 
which 
this 
passage 
is 
taken 
seems 
to 
me to 
be fairly 
representative 
of 
Fludd's 
reasoning 
about 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
World: 
he is 
concerned 
with 
ascribing 
dimensions 
to 
regions 
whose 
extent 
cannot 
be measured 
by observation 
and 
whose 
very 
existence 
was open 
to 
dispute, 
namely 
the 
spheres 
'tb 
of 
water, 
air 
and 
fire 
which 
he takesLlie 
between 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
Moon 
(see 
figure 
6.2). 
I 
am happy 
to 
leave 
it 
to 
others 
to 
decide 
what 
Fludd's 
purpose 
may have 
been, 
but 
it 
seems 
clear 
that 
he 
is 
not 
concerned 
with 
the 
observed 
properties 
of 
the 
planetary 
system, 
for 
he never, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
can 
see, 
makes 
any 
allusion 
to 
observed 
values 
of 
any 
astronomical 
quantity. 
Kepler's 
judgement 
that 
Fludd 
is 
concerned 
with 
a World 
of 
his 
own imagining 
may be over-simple, 
but 
there 
seems 
to 
be no reason 
to 
doubt 
that 
it 
was 
a World 
very 
different 
from 
the 
one 
with 
which 
Kepler 
himself 
was 
concerned. 
The 
difference 
between 
Fludd's 
cosmological 
mathematics 
and 
Kepler's 
at 
least 
partly 
reflects 
a difference 
in 
their 
technical 
capacity 
as mathematicians, 
the 
advantage 
all 
being 
on Kepler's 
side. 
However, 
there 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
me to 
be a huge 
philosophical 
difference 
between 
Kepler's 
theory 
that 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbs 
was 
taken 
from 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
circumspheres 
and 
in- 
spheres 
of 
the 
five 
Platonic 
solids 
and 
Fludd's 
theory 
that 
the 
mean 
radius 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Sun was 
determined 
by 
the 
geometrical 
properties 
of 
a pair 
of 
intersecting 

309 
pyramids. 
One can 
hardly 
help 
reflecting 
that 
the 
latter 
theory 
is 
a somewhat 
elaborate 
way 
of 
constructing 
a 
mid-point, 
but 
it 
is 
nonetheless 
clear 
that 
a similarly 
Platonic 
God is 
geometrising 
in 
both 
theories. 
Fludd 
is 
more 
conventional 
than 
Kepler 
in 
being 
willing 
to 
accept 
Numerology 
as 
well 
as 
Geometry 
as 
a 
possible 
source 
of 
cosmological 
theories, 
and 
here 
I 
think 
we have 
found 
a difference 
in 
their 
philosophies 
rather 
than 
merely 
a difference 
in 
their 
technical 
capacity 
as mathematicians: 
for 
Kepler, 
as we have 
seen, 
rejects 
Numerology 
not 
on'the 
grounds 
of 
its 
mathematical 
naivete 
but 
on the 
grounds 
that 
numbers 
can 
have 
no 
properties 
apart 
from 
the 
quantities 
they 
measure. 
Never- 
theless, 
it 
seems to me that 
the 
crucial 
difference 
between 
Kepler's 
World 
Harmony 
and Fludd's 
does 
not 
lie 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mathematics 
that 
is 
used, 
and 
I 
find 
it 
quite 
understandable 
that 
historians 
who have 
concen- 
trated 
their 
attention 
upon 
the 
thoroughgoing 
Platonism 
of 
Kepler's 
mathematical 
cosmology 
have 
concluded 
that 
Kepler 
has 
much 
in 
common 
with 
Fludd. 
The 
crucial 
dif- 
ference 
between-Kepler 
and 
Fludd 
seems 
to 
me to 
be that 
Kepler 
demanded 
that 
his 
cosmological 
theories 
should 
be in 
good 
numerical 
agreement 
with 
measured 
properties 
of 
the 
observable 
Universe. 
Kepler's 
mathematical 
philosophy 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
Kepler 
felt 
that 
a sharp 
distinction 

310 
should 
be drawn 
between 
the 
types 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
exemplified 
by Fludd's 
Utriusque.... 
Cosmi 
Historia 
and 
his 
own Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V. 
Nevertheless, 
his- 
torians 
are 
not 
bound 
to 
agree 
with 
him, 
and 
the 
recent 
revival 
of 
interest 
in 
possible 
connections 
between 
the 
magical 
Hermetic 
tradition 
and 
the 
rise 
of 
modern 
science 
has 
led 
to 
several 
suggestions 
that 
Kepler, 
who is 
undoubtedly 
implicated 
in 
the 
latter 
phenomenon, 
may have 
had 
some connection 
with 
the 
former 
(to 
which 
Fludd 
clearly 
belongs). 
Westuran (1977) 
and others 
have 
considered 
problems 
such 
as whether 
Hermetic 
philosophers 
were 
truly 
drawn 
to 
the 
Copernican 
theory 
as an astronomical 
theory 
or 
whether 
they 
in 
fact 
saw it 
more 
or 
less 
as a symbolic 
representation 
of 
the 
power 
of 
the 
Sun. 
However, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
no-one 
has 
yet 
taken 
up 
the 
specific 
suggestion 
that 
Yates' 
Rosicrucian 
Enlightenment 
"has 
provided 
historical 
material 
from 
which 
a new historical 
approach 
to 
Kepler 
might 
be made" 
(Yates, 
1972, 
p. 
223). 
I 
should 
not 
wish 
to 
claim 
that 
the 
present 
study 
of 
Kepler's 
geometrical 
cosmology 
should 
be seen 
as 
an adequate 
response 
to 
this 
challenge, 
but 
it 
has, 
at 
least, 
led 
me 
to 
make 
a fairly 
detailed 
analysis 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V, 
a work 
which 
Kepler 
himself 
considered 
capable 
of 
comparison 
with 
what 
he recognised 
as an overtly 
Hermetic 
work, 
namely 
Utriusque.... 
Cosmi 
Historia. 
It 
seems 
reasonable 
to 
include 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
in 
the 
comparison 
as well, 
since, 
as we have 
seen, 
the 

311 
theory 
it 
describes 
re-appears 
as 
one 
element 
in 
the 
wider 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
later 
work, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
mathematics 
in 
the 
two 
works 
is 
similar 
in 
spirit 
(if 
not 
always 
identical 
in 
detail). 
I 
think 
that 
most 
historians 
would 
agree 
that 
both 
of 
these 
works 
may 
fairly 
be said 
to 
"look 
Hermetic" 
in 
a way 
that, 
for 
instance, 
the 
Dioptrice 
(Prague, 
1611) 
clearly 
does 
not. 
There 
is 
a further 
reason 
for 
looking 
to 
Kepler's, 
cosmological 
works 
for 
traces 
of 
Hermetic 
philosophy: 
it 
is 
in 
writing 
about 
cosmology, 
rather 
than 
about 
the 
technical 
details 
of 
natural 
philosophy, 
that 
a man's 
philosophical 
prejudices 
and 
preoccupations 
are 
liable 
to 
be at 
their 
most 
visible. 
Cosmologists 
are 
synthes- 
ising 
the 
results 
of 
technical 
astronomy 
and 
the 
"ob- 
servations" 
they 
are 
dealing 
with 
are 
thus 
even 
more 
heavily 
theory-laden 
than 
those 
of 
the 
astronomers, 
with 
the 
result 
that 
their 
hypotheses 
tend 
to 
take 
the 
form 
of 
', 'principles", 
such 
as 
the 
Cosmological 
Principle 
(that 
the 
Universe 
looks 
the 
same 
to 
all 
observers) 
or 
Mach's 
Principle 
(that 
the 
gravitational 
field 
at 
any 
point 
is 
determined 
by 
all 
the 
matter 
in 
the 
Universe). 
The 
philosophical 
outlook 
I 
have 
found 
in 
Kepler's 
cosmological 
works 
seems to 
me to 
be best 
described 
by 
some phrase 
such 
as "radical 
Platonism". 
We have 
seen 
that 
Kepler 
regards 
his 
thought 
as being 
closely 
akin 
to 
that 
of 
Proclus, 
but 
the 
numerous 
references 
to 
his 
works 
all 
seem to 
concern 
mathematical 
and philosophical 
points 
which 
show the 
Platonic 
rather 
than 
the 
Neoplatonic 

312 
elements 
in 
Proclus' 
philosophy. 
The 
adjective 
"radical" 
seems 
to 
me to 
be warranted 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
Kepler 
(who 
is 
rather 
given 
to 
laying 
his 
opinions 
on the 
line) 
states 
in 
so many words 
that 
Timaeus 
should 
be read 
as 
a commentary 
on Genesis 
(see 
Chapter 
I 
above). 
Kepler 
himself 
occasionally 
confuses 
the 
issue 
by describing 
his 
opinions 
as Pythagorean, 
or, 
rather, 
by ascribing 
his 
own opinions 
to 
the 
Pythagoreans 
- 
for 
example, 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
section 
XXV (KGW 6, 
p. 
81), 
where 
he suggests 
that 
the 
Pythagoreans 
may have 
used 
the 
five 
"cosmic" 
solids 
in 
the 
manner 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 
However, 
it 
is 
entirely 
clear, 
from 
passages 
such 
as his 
introduction 
to 
his 
musical 
theory 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
III, 
that 
he does 
not 
share 
the 
characteristically 
Pythagorean 
belief 
in 
the 
power 
of 
pure 
numbers 
(see 
above), 
even 
in 
the 
form 
in 
which 
it 
is 
expressed 
in 
Timaeus 
(34b-36d, 
see 
Chapter 
V 
above). 
Another 
Pythagorean 
attitude 
which 
Kepler 
does 
not 
share 
is 
their 
belief 
that 
results 
should 
be kept 
secret 
or 
revealed 
only 
to 
initiates. 
Kepler's 
conviction 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
quite 
the 
reverse, 
if 
we may judge 
by 
the 
quantity 
of 
his 
publications 
and 
the 
many 
passages 
in 
his 
letters 
that 
echo 
the 
words 
he wrote 
to 
Maestlin 
in 
1595: 
"If 
this 
[i. 
e. 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum] 
is 
published, 
others 
will 
perhaps 
make 
discoveries 
I 
might 
have 
reserved 
for 
myself. 
But 
we are 
all 
ephemeral 
creatures 
(and 
none 
more 
so than 
I). 
I 
strive, 
therefore, 

313 
for 
the 
glory 
of 
God, 
who wants 
to 
be recognised 
from 
the 
book 
of 
Nature, 
that 
these 
things 
may 
be published 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible. 
The 
more 
others 
build 
on my 
work 
the 
happier 
I 
shall, 
be" 
(Kepler 
to

39-40). 
This, 
I 
think, 
shows 
an entirely 
"modern" 
attitude 
to 
publishing 
one's 
results, 
and 
it 
is 
in 
perfect 
accord 
with 
the 
impression 
I 
receive 
from 
Kepler's 
books, 
namely 
that 
they 
were 
written 
to 
be understood 
by 
the 
learned 
community 
as 
a whole 
- 
unlike, 
for 
instance, 
the 
beaut- 
ifully 
illustrated 
and 
thoroughly 
enigmatic 
works 
by 
Michael 
Maier 
which 
Yates 
regards 
as 
typical 
products 
of 
Rosicrucianism 
(Yates, 
1972, 
p. 70 
et 
seqq). 
Of 
course, 
a work 
may be partly 
written 
for 
initiates 
without 
being 
as 
ostentatiously 
opaque 
to 
outsiders 
as, 
say, 
Maier's 
Atalanta 
Fugiens 
(Oppenheim, 
1617): 
Timaeus 
may well 
be 
such 
a work, 
as Kepler 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
aware 
(see 
Chapter 
I 
above). 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
prove 
that 
any 
writer 
was 
not 
a covert 
adherent 
of 
a more 
or 
less 
secret 
group 
of 
adepts: 
one 
is 
forced 
to 
rely 
upon 
a subjective 
assessment 
of 
the 
writer's 
character. 
My 
assessment 
of 
Kepler's 
is 
that 
he would 
not 
have 
hesi- 
tated 
to 
tell 
his 
readers 
if 
his 
works 
contained 
an 
element 
of 
Pythagorean 
secrecy 
or 
if 
he was in 
some 
0 
passages 
writing 
for 
initiates 
in 
the 
manner 
Plato's 
Timaeus. 
Such 
admissions 
would 
have 
done 
no more 
than 
define 
further 
details 
of 
his 
professed 
allegiance 
to 
the 
philosophies 
he recognised 
as most 
clearly 
expressed 

314 
in 
his 
works. 
For 
a historian 
they 
might 
have 
served 
as an indication 
that 
he shared 
some beliefs 
that 
may 
be regarded 
as typically 
Rosicrucian. 
One is 
similarly 
forced 
to 
argue 
mainly 
from 
silence 
in 
assessing 
the 
likelihood 
that 
Kepler 
was 
influenced 
by 
the 
Hermetic 
tradition. 
We have 
seen 
that 
the 
references 
to 
Hermes 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V are 
evidence 
only 
that 
Kepler 
has 
read 
Pimander, 
and 
we have 
seen 
also 
that 
he follows 
his 
summary 
of 
the 
work 
by 
stating 
that 
he disagrees 
with 
much 
of 
what 
it 
says 
(see 
Chapter 
V above). 
The 
only 
reference 
to 
Bruno 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V concerns 
his 
edition 
of 
Euclid 
(HM I, 
sect. 
XLVIII, 
KGW 6, 
p. 
62,1.12). 
It 
seems 
that 
the 
only 
conclusion 
that 
one 
can 
draw 
from 
Kepler's 
silence 
is 
that, 
since 
he does 
seem to 
have 
been 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
acknowledging 
his 
intellectual 
debts, 
as may be 
seen, 
for 
instance, 
from 
his 
many 
references 
to 
Proclus, 
Copernicus 
and 
Tycho, 
his 
silence 
on Hermes 
and 
his 
followers 
implies 
that 
he did 
not 
see 
himself 
as 
in- 
fluenced 
by 
the 
tradition 
they 
represented. 
The 
character 
of 
the 
natural 
philosophy 
I 
have 
found 
in 
his 
cosmological 
works 
inclines 
me to 
suppose 
that 
he was 
right 
about 
this: 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Libri 
V shares 
with 
Hermetic 
and 
Rosicrucian 
works 
only 
those 
elements 
that 
can 
be seen 
as most 
directly 
derived 
from 
Timaeus. 
Fludd 
may have 
taken 
his 
Platonism 
from 
Hermes, 
Kepler's 
seems 
to 
have 
come 
from 
the 
primary 
source. 
In 
any 
case, 
I 
do not 
think 
that 
we need 
be at 
a loss 

315 
for 
a tradition 
to 
which 
Kepler 
may 
be assigned: 
the 
tradition 
is 
that 
of 
the 
hard-working 
professional 
mathematicians 
who were 
the 
spiritual 
children 
of 
Claudius 
Ptolemy 
(fl. 
125-141). 
Kepler's 
polyhedral 
and 
musical 
Archetypes 
arose 
from 
the 
possibility 
of 
turning 
this 
long 
tradition 
of 
calculation 
to 
the 
task 
of 
solving 
a cosmological 
problem, 
namely 
explaining 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
planets 
(for 
in 
the 
Copernican 
description 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
the 
relative 
sizes 
of 
epicycle 
and 
deferent 
in 
the 
geocentric 
orbit 
allowed 
one 
to 
calculate 
the 
physical 
size 
of 
the 
planet's 
heliocentric 
orbit, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
Great 
Orb). 
In 
keeping 
with'the 
standards 
of 
this 
Ptolemaic 
tradition, 
Kepler 
demanded 
that 
his 
cosmological 
theories, 
like 
his 
astronomical 
ones, 
should 
be 
in 
good 
numerical 
agreement 
with 
the 
results 
of 
astronomical 
observation. 
Kepler's 
historical 
judgement 
is 
notoriously 
unreliable 
but 
there 
is, 
after 
all, 
a certain 
appropriateness 
in 
the 
references 
to 
measurement 
in 
the 
terse 
epitaph 
he wrote 
for 
himself: 
"I 
used 
to 
measure 
the 
Heavens, 
now I 
measure 
the 
shadows 
of 
Earth. 
The mind 
belonged 
to 
Heaven, 
the 
body's 
shadow 
lies 
here. 
" (KGW 19, 
P" 393) 
The Platonism 
of 
his 
cosmological 
theories 
makes 
them 
seem far 
removed 
from 
the 
"modern" 
values 
that 
are 
apparent 
in, 
say, 
the 
Astronomia 
Nova, 
but 
Kepler's 
con- 
cern 
with 
giving 
an adequately 
accurate 
description 
of 
measured 
properties 
of 
the 
observable 
Universe 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
run 
through 
all 
his 
work.

RADII 
OF THE CIRCUMSPHERE 
AND INSPHERE 
OF THE CUBE 
Chapter 
XIII 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
43) 
gives 
a fairly 
cursory 
account 
of 
how 
to 
construct 
circumspheres 
and 
inspheres 
for 
the 
five 
known 
regular 
polyhedra. 
In 
this 
account 
Kepler 
refers 
particularly 
to 
Book 
XV of 
Campanus' 
Latin 
edition 
of 
Euclid's 
Elements 
(first 
printed 
in 
Venice, 
1482, 
many 
later 
editions). 
The 
other 
edition 
to 
which 
he refers 
is 
that 
by Franjois 
Foix 
de Candalle 
(Paris, 
1566 and 
1578). 
There 
was no need 
for 
Kepler 
to 
give 
a detailed 
account 
of 
how to 
construct 
the 
spheres, 
since 
the 
Problems 
were 
thoroughly 
familiar 
to 
any 
mathematician 
of 
the 
time, 
having 
been 
treated 
in 
extenso 
by 
such 
popular 
authors 
as 
Luca 
Pacioli 
(whose 
work 
on 
poly- 
hedra 
was 
very 
deeply 
indebted 
to 
a treatise 
written 
by 
his 
teacher 
Piero 
della 
Francesca 
(c. 
1416-1492)). 
My 
modern 
account 
of 
how to 
calculate 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
spheres 
for 
the 
cube 
is 
intended 
merely 
to 
show that 
the 
problem 
is 
not 
a very 
difficult 
one. 
GZ

Let 
ABCDEFGH be a cube, 
with 
centre 
0. 
Let 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
face 
ABCD be P. 
Let 
the 
side 
of 
the 
cube 
be 
2a. 
Since 
0 is 
the 
common 
centre 

320 
of 
the 
circumsphere 
and 
the 
insphere 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
spheres 
are 
clearly 
OP and 
OC respectively. 
Since 
P and 0 are 
the 
mid-points 
of 
CA and 
CE res- 
pectively, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
triangles 
CPO and 
CAE 
are 
similar, 
their 
corresponding 
sides 
being 
in 
the 
ratio 
1: 2.

Therefore 
PO = f. AE

ABCD and 
therefore 
to

Therefore 
the

OF REGULAR POLYGONS 
Problems 
of 
inscribing 
and 
circumscribing 
circles 
in 
or 
about 
polygons 
are 
dealt 
with 
in 
Book 
IV 
of 
Euclid's 
Elements. 
References 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(Tübingen, 
1596) 
suggest 
that 
while 
Kepler 
was 
writing 
this 
work 
he was, 
in 
the 
main, 
using 
the 
edition 
of 
the 
Elements 
by 
Francois 
Foix 
de Candalle 
(Paris, 
1556). 
Euclid 
shows how to 
inscribe 
and circumscribe 
circles 
in 
or about 
triangles, 
squares, 
regular 
pentagons 
and 
regular 
hexagons. 
He also 
shows 
how to 
inscribe 
any of 
these 
figures 
in 
a given 
circle 
and 
how 
to 
circumscribe 
it 
about 
a given 
circle. 
The final 
proposition, 
Proposition 
16, 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
inscribing 
a regular 
fifteen-sided 
figure 
in 
a given 
circle. 
In 
the 
main 
text 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
Kepler 
treats 
the 
inscribing 
of 
regular 
polygons 
in 
circles 
as 
irrelevant 
to 
cosmological 
problems, 
but 
he 
was to 
change 
his 
mind 
later, 
and Book I of 
the 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
(Linz, 
1619) 
contains 
a detailed 
analysis 
of 
the 
general 
problem 
of 
inscribing 
a regular 
polygon 
in 
a 
circle, 
the 
treatment 
being 
derived 
from 
both 
Book 
IV 
and Book X of 
the 
Elements. 
An account 
of 
this. 
part 
of 
Kepler's 
work 
is 
given 
in my Chapter 
V. 
The present 
Appendix 
is 
concerned 
only 
with 
the 
theory 
described 
in 
the 
Preface 
to 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum. 

322 
The 
equilateral 
triangle 
In 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Elements 
Euclid 
considers 
a general 
triangle, 
but 
Kepler 
is 
concerned 
only 
with 
an equi- 
lateral 
triangle. 
I 
Let 
PQR be an equi- 
lateral 
triangle. 
By 
Elements 
Book 
IV, 
Propositions 
4 and 
5, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
con- 
struct 
circles 
inscribed 
in 
the 
triangle 
and 
circumscribed 
about 
it, 
A14.1 
Equilateral 
triangle 
as shown. 
Let 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
circum- 
circle, 
PQR, be 0. 
Then 
by 
symmetry, 
0 is 
also 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
inscribed 
circle, 
and 
PO produced 
will 
meet 
QR at 
L, 
the 
point 
in 
which 
QR touches 
the 
inscribed 
circle. 
Let 
the 
side 
of, APQR 
be 2a and 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
inscribed 
and 
circumscribed 
circles 
b and 
c respectively. 
Then 
Area 
APQR = 2. QR. PL 
_ 3.2a. 
(b+c) 
= a(b 
+ c) 
(1) 
But 
we may consider 
A PQR as made up'of 
six 
triangles 
congruent 
with 
40QL. 

323 
Therefore, 
Area 
QPQR =6x 
Area 
AOQL 
6. ý'. QL. OL 
= 3. a. b. 
(2) 
Therefore, 
by 
(1), 
3ab 
= ab + ac 
c 
2b. 
So the 
ratio 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
circumcircle 
and 
the 
incircle 
is 
2: 1. 
(The

of

about

is 
not

The 
square 
Let 
PQRS be a square. 
By Elements

Propo- 
sitions 
8 and 
9, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
construct 
circles 
inscribed 
in 
the 
square 
and 
circumscribed 
about 
it, 
as 
P 
shown. 
By symmetry, 
the 
two 
MK 
circles 
are 
concentric. 
Let 
their 
common centre 
be 0.

The 
ratio 
of 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
circumcircle 
and 
the 
incircle 
is 
thus: 
1, 
that

about 
2.98:

The

from

is 
thus 
too

about 
two.

In general,

that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
construct 
a circum- 
circle 
and an incircle 
for 
any regular 
polygon, 
and that 
the 
two

will 
be concentric.

the

an

that 
Kepler 
was 
prepared 
to 
tolerate 
in 
a theory 
of 
this 
kind 
that 
he does 
not

APPENDIX 
5 
KEPLER AND THE RHOMBIC SOLIDS 
The rhombic 
dodecahedron 
and 
the 
rhombic 
triaconta- 
hedron 
are 
described 
and 
illustrated 
in 
section 
XXVII 
of 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
(Linz, 
1619, 
see 
Appendix 
6, 
figure 
12 for 
illustration). 
Though 
these 
are 
Kepler's 
first 
published 
illustrations 
of 
the 
solids, 
the 
dodeca- 
hedron 
had 
been 
described, 
and 
the 
triacontahedron 
merely 
mentioned, 
in 
De Nive 
Sexangula 
(Prague, 
1611, 
p. 
7, 
KGW 4, 
p. 
266,11.10-16). 
Both 
solids 
reappear 
in 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Epitome 
(Linz, 
1620) 
where 
we find 
a description 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
dodecahedron 
(Epitome 
IV, 
Pt. 
I, 
p. 
461, 
KGW 7, 
p. 
270) 
and 
illustrations 
of 
both 
solids 
(Epitome 
IV, 
p. 
464, 
KGW 7, 
p. 
272). 
Together 
with 
the 
cube, 
which 
Kepler, 
entirely 
reasonably, 
regards 
as 
being 
in 
principle 
also 
a solid 
with 
rhombic 
faces, 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
and 
triacontahedron 
are 
later 
pressed 
into 
service 
to 
explain 
the 
fact 
that 
Jupiter 
has 
four 
moons 
and 
to 
account 
for 
the 
sizes 
of 
the 
gaps 
between 
their 
orbits, 
though 
Kepler 
does 
not 
describe 
his 
theory 
in 
detail 
(Epitome 
IV, 
Pt. 
II, 
p. 
554, 
KGW 7, 
p. 
318,1.39 
et 
seqq). 
Of 
these 
published 
references 
to 
the 
solids, 
the 
one 
in 
Part 
I 
of 
Epitome 
Book 
IV 
is 
the 
most 
satisfactory 
from 
the 
mathematical 
point 
of 
view. 
As I 
noted 
in 
Chapter 
V, 
the 
proposition 
in 
Harmonises 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
has 
been 
phrased 
in 
such 
a way as 
to 
avoid 
rigorous 
mathematical 
discussion; 
and, 
though 
the 
rhombic 
dodeca- 

327 
hedron 
is 
described 
in 
some 
detail 
in 
De Nive 
Sexangula, 
the 
rhombic 
triacontahedron 
is 
merely 
mentioned 
as 
another 
solid 
of 
a similar 
kind. 
Kepler's 
description 
of 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
in 
De Nive 
Sexangula 
is 
very 
thorough, 
so 
thorough 
as 
to 
suggest 
that 
he knew 
of 
no 
earlier 
description 
of 
the 
solid, 
and 
regarded 
himself 
as 
in 
some 
sense 
its 
dis- 
coverer. 
I 
cannot 
help 
feeling 
that 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
should 
have 
followed 
closely 
upon 
the 
first 
detailed 
inspection 
of 
a well-constructed 
honeycomb, 
but 
Kepler 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
any 
earlier 
work, 
and 
since 
he does 
apparently 
make 
a habit 
of 
acknowled- 
ging 
the 
work 
of 
his 
predecessors, 
and 
there 
seems 
to 
be no reason 
why 
he should 
have 
departed 
from 
his 
usual 
practice 
in 
this 
case, 
I 
think 
we must 
conclude 
that 
he 
regarded 
his 
investigation 
of 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
solid 
as 
largely 
original. 
The 
rhombic 
triacontahedron 
does 
not 
present 
itself 
to 
view 
in 
the 
natural 
world 
in 
any 
similar 
manner, 
and 
historians 
seem 
to 
be agreed 
in 
accepting 
that 
Kepler 
discovered 
this 
solid, 
though 
there 
is 
a discreet 
silence 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
dodecahedron 
(see 
Caspar's 
notes 
on HM II, 
sect. 
XXVII, 
KGW 6, 
p, 
532 
and 
on Letter 
142, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
1467). 
The 
date 
of 
Kepler's 
discovery 
Kepler 
mentions 
both 
rhombic 
solids 
in 
a letter 
to 
Maestlin 
written 
in 
November 
1599: 
"Meanwhile 
I 
rely 

328 
upon 
getting 
the 
eccentricities 
from 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
with 
12 and 
30 faces 
and 
from 
the 
Archimedean 
solids" 
(22 
Nov. 
1599, 
letter 
142,11.21-22, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
87). 
A line 
in 
a letter 
to 
Maestlin 
written 
in 
the 
previous 
August 
also 
seems 
to 
refer 
to 
at 
least 
one 
rhombic 
a, 
solid: 
"... 
and 
there 
are 
the 
five 
regua1, 
' 
solids 
and 
the 
13 Archimedeans. 
And 
perhaps 
some 
Keplerian 
solids 
(Et 
forsan 
aliquot 
Kepleriana), 
of 
one 
of 
which 
I 
shall 
give 
you 
a description... 
" 
(29 
Aug. 
1599, 
letter 
132, 
1.141 
et 
seqq, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
46). 
Kepler 
then 
describes 
a 
solid 
with 
twelve 
pentagram 
faces 
which 
"is 
no more 
than 
an augmented 
[Platonic] 
Dodecahedron 
(but 
augmented 
most 
regularly)" 
(letter 
132,11.144-145, 
KGW 14, 
p. 
46). 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
"aliquot 
Kepleriana" 
refers 
to 
Kepler's 
expectation 
that 
he will 
find 
more 
bodies 
with 
pentagram 
faces. 
However, 
in 
the 
event, 
he found 
only 
one more 
such 
body, 
and 
if 
I 
am correct 
in 
my reasoning 
in 
Appendix 
6, 
it 
seems 
that 
it 
should 
not 
have 
taken 
him 
very 
long 
to 
satisfy 
himself 
that 
there 
were 
no more 
such 
solids 
to 
be found, 
since 
their 
construction 
depended 
upon 
stellating 
polygons 
formed 
by 
the 
edges 
of 
the 
, 
a. 
regualýr 
solids. 
(For 
details 
see 
Appendix 
6, 
Pt. 
I). 
It 
seems 
to 
me to 
be unlikely 
that 
the 
"aliquot 
Kepleriana" 
are 
meant 
to 
include 
Kepler's 
second 
star 
polyhedron, 
since, 
like 
the 
first, 
it 
too 
has 
twelve 
faces, 
and 
it 
would 
surely 
have 
been 
natural 
for 
Kepler 
to 
compare 
and 
contrast 
the 
two 
solids 
(as 
he does 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
sect. 
XXVII) 
if 
he had 
discovered 
both 
of 
them 
when 

329 
he wrote 
this 
letter. 
He would 
clearly 
have 
expected 
Maestlin 
to 
be interested, 
as 
is 
indicated 
by his 
giving 
a quite 
detailed 
description 
of 
the 
first 
star 
polyhedron. 
I 
am therefore 
inclined 
to 
supose 
that 
since 
"aliquot" 
must 
refer 
to 
at 
least 
three 
bodies, 
the 
bodies 
in 
question 
were 
the 
"augmented 
Dodecahedron" 
and 
the 
two 
rhombic 
solids. 
The manner 
of 
Kepler's 
discovery 
Kepler 
has not 
left 
an account 
of 
how he discovered 
the 
rhombic 
solids, 
but 
it 
seems 
to 
me that 
the 
description 
of 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
in 
the 
Epitome 
(Book 
IV 
Pt. 
II), 
which 
forms 
an 
extension 
to 
a mathe- 
matical 
discussion 
that 
is 
repeated 
from 
a passage 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
may well 
indicate 
the 
actual 
process 
of 
discovery 
of 
the 
rhombic 
triacontahedron. 
It 
certainly 
indicates 
a possible 
process 
of 
discovery. 
The 
references 
to 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
in 
the 
unfinished 
treatise 
on Geometry 
which 
Kepler 
began 
to 
write 
in 
1628 
seem 
to 
be 
too 
sketchy 
to 
give 
any 
guidance 
(see 
Appendix 
6 
Pt. 
I 
for 
references 
to 
this 
treatise). 
In 
Chapter 
V of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Kepler 
mentions 
a relation 
between 
the 
three 
"primary" 
regular 
solids, 
the 
cube, 
the 
tetrahedron 
and 
the 
dodecahedron: 
ý!... 
the 
remaining 
four 
[regular 
solids] 
are 
not 
generated 
by 
their 
faces 
but 
are 
either 
cut 
out 
from 
the 
cube, 
like 
the 
tetrahedron, 
by 
the 
removal 
of 
four 
right-angled 

330 
pyramids, 
or 
are 
built 
up from 
it, 
like 
the 
dodecahedron, 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
six 
five-faced 
solids" 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
31, 
11.17-19). 
What Kepler 
says 
of 
the 
tetrahedron 
and 
the 
dodecahedron 
is 
true 
(see 
figures 
A5.1 
and 
A5.2), 
and 
the 
octahedron 
may also 
be thought 
of 
as 
"cut 
out" 
from

IV 
of 
the 
Epitome 
(Linz, 
1620. 
KGW 7, 
pp. 
269 
and 
271). 
The 
idea 
of 
cutting 
pieces 
off 
a mathematical 
solid 
or 
adding 
pieces 
to 
it 
was not 
a new one in 
Kepler's 
day. 
Pacioli 
describes 
the 
results 
of 
such 
processes 
in 
De 
Divina 
Proportione 
(Venice, 
1509) 
and 
the 
names 
of 
the 

332 
processes, 
"cutting" 
and 
"raising", 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
titles 
given 
to 
the 
resulting 
solids 
in 
the 
spectacular 
diagrams 
supplied 
by Leonardo 
da Vinci 
(see 
figures 
A5.5 
and 
A5.6). 
It 
should 
be noted, 
however, 
that 
the 
pyramids 
Pacioli 
adds 
to 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
solids 
are 
always 
equilateral. 
The 
same processes 
are 
employed 
by 
Wentzel 
Jamnitzer 
in 
his 
Perspectiva 
Corporum 
Regularium 
(Nuremberg, 
1568), 
a book 
which 
consists 
almost 
entirely 
of 
illustrations, 
designed 
by Jamnitzer 
himself 
and 
engraved 
by his 
chief 
engraver 
Jost 
Amman (see 
figures 
A5.7 
and 
A5.8). 
Jamnitzer 
occasionally 
adds 
pyramids 
which, 
though 
not 
themselves 
regular 
or 
equilateral, 
will 
produce 
a regular 
solid. 
I 
have 
shown 
such 
a case 
in 
Appendix 
6, 
figure 
15, 
where 
the 
pyramids 
added 
in 
the 
middle 
figure'on 
the 
right 
seem 
to 
have 
made 
an exact 
cube, 
but 
not 
an exact 
octahedron. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
explanatory 
text, 
I have 
found 
it 
impossible 
to 
decide 
what 
Jamnitzer 
thinks 
he is 
doing. 
However, 
I 
strongly 
suspect 
he is 
rather 
concerned 
with 
some math- 
ematical 
version 
of 
Alchemy, 
with 
religious 
overtones, 
than 
with 
the 
mathematical 
properties 
of 
polyhedra 
or 
the 
process 
of 
drawing 
in 
perspective. 
Kepler's 
ulterior 
motives 
are 
cosmological, 
but 
he is 
explicit 
about 
the 
geometrical 
methods 
he uses. 
He is 
concerned 
that 
the 
resultant 
solid 
should 
exhibit 
some 
form 
of 
regularity, 
rather 
than 
that 
the 
pieces 
added 
should 
themselves 
be regular 
or 
equilateral. 
Thus,

in 
order

Platonic 
dodecahedron 
he adds 
roof-like 
shapes 
to 
each 
face 
of 
the 
cube 
(figure 
A5.2). 
These 
two 
procedures 
are 
described 
in 
the 
Epitome 
in 
much 
the 
same way 
as 
they 
were 
described 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmo- 
graphicum, 
but 
in 
the 
later 
work 
Kepler 
not 
only 
provides 
illustrations 
of 
the 
processes 
but 
also 
describes 
and 
illustrates 
a further 
example 
of 
the 
second 
procedure: 
showing 
that 
if 
a suitably-proportioned 
square 
pyramid 
is 
added 
to 
each 
face 
of 
the 
cube 
we obtain 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
( figure 
A5.10). 
He points 
out 
that 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
new figure 
are 
equilateral 
but 
not 
equi- 
angular, 
and 
that 
its 
solid 
angles 
are 
of 
two 
different 
types: 
four 
faces 
of 
the 
new 
solid 
meeting 
at 
each 
of 
the 
vertices 
corresponding 
to 
the 
apex 
of 
one 
of 
the

and 
three 
faces 
of 
the 
new solid 
meeting 
at 
each 
of 
the 
vertices 
corresponding 
to 
a vertex 
of 
the 
original 
cube 
(such 
as 
the 
point 
D in 
figure 
A5.10). 
The 
construction 
shown 
in 
figure 
A5.10 
provides 
a 
way 
of 
explaining 
why 
rhombic 
dodecahedra, 
like 
cubes, 
can 
be close-packed. 
Kepler 
had 
discussed 
this 
property 
at 
length 
in 
De Nive 
Sexangula 
(KGW 4, 
pp. 
265-266) 
and 
mentioned 
it 
again, 
briefly, 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
section 
V (KGW 6, 
p. 
68,11.25-35). 
Both 
discussions 
mention 
the 
fact 
that 
when 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
are 
packed 
together, 
six 
quadrilinear 
vertices 
will 
fit 
together 
to 
fill 
space 
around 
a point, 
and 
four 
trilinear 
vertices 
will 
do the 
same. 
In 
fact, 
the 
packings 
of 
the 
two 
kinds 
of 
polyhedra 
are 
mathematically 
equivalent: 
the 
six 
square 
pyramids 
added 
to 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
cube 
in 
figure 
-A5.10 
will 
form 
another 
cube 
of 
the 
same 
size 
as 
the 
inner 
cube 
(sd 
the 
packed 
rhombic 
solids 
may be thought 
'of 
as an array 
of 
cubes, 
whole 
cubes 
alternating 
with 
cubes 
made 
up of 
the 
six 
added 
pyramids). 
Kepler 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
aware 
of 
this 
identity 
when 
he wrote 
about 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
in 
the 
Epitome, 
for 
he 
says 
"And 
these 
6 pieces(prismata)add 
up 
to 
little 
less(paulo 
minus) 
than 
the 
cube 
on which 
they 
are 
placed" 
(KGW 7, 
p. 
270, 
1.8). 
Since 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
Kepler 
explained, 
correctly, 
that 
six 
of 
the 
quadrilinear 
solid 
angles 
of 
the 
rhombic 
solid 
filled 
space 
round 
a point 
(KGW 6, 
p. 
68, *1.31), 
I 
presume 
that 
the 
rather 
disconcerting 
"paulo 
minus" 
in 
the 
Epitome 
is 
a slip 
of 
the 
pen, 
or 

340 
a literary 
elegance 
which 
I 
fail 
to 
appreciate. 
Kepler's 
analysis 
of 
the 
packing 
of rhombic 
dodecahedra 
in 
De Nive 
Sexangula 
is 
more 
diffuse 
than 
that 
given 
in 
the 
later 
work, 
but 
I 
think 
it 
must 
be seen 
as representing 
the 
process 
of 
"discovery", 
that 
is 
the 
finding 
of 
a 
description 
of 
the 
angles 
and 
faces 
of 
the 
solid 
which 
explains 
its 
known 
property 
of 
filling 
space. 
Although 
this 
description 
does 
not 
explicitly 
relate 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
to the 
cube 
in 
the 
manner 
shown in 
the 
diagram 
in Book IV of 
the 
Epitome 
(see 
figure 
A5.10), 
Kepler 
does mention 
that 
the 
solid 
"is 
related 
to 
the 
cube and the 
octahedron" 
(De Nive 
Sexangula, 
p. 
7, 
KGW 4, 
p. 266,1.13) 
and adds 
that 
the 
rhombic 
triacon- 
tahedron 
is 
related 
to 
the 
Platonic 
dodecahedron 
and 
icosahedron 
(KGW 4, 
p. 
266,1.14). 
This 
last 
remark 
seems to me to 
indicate 
a method 
by which 
Kepler 
may 
have 
discovered 
the 
second 
rhombic 
solid. 
As Kepler 
himself 
remarks 
(Epitome 
IV, 
p. 
461, KGW 7, 
p. 
270,11.6-7), 
the 
construction, 
of 
the 
rhombic 
dodeca- 
hedron 
from 
the 
cube 
depends 
upon 
adding 
pyramids 
whose 
heights 
are 
such 
that 
the 
neighbouring 
triangular 
faces 
of 
the 
pyramids 
added 
to 
neighbouring 
faces 
of 
the 
cube 
will 
lie 
in 
the 
same 
plane. 
Figure 
A5.11 
shows 
a cube, 
with 
an edge 
PQ; 
and 
the 
points 
A and 
B which 
are 
the 
apices 
of 
the 
square 
pyramids 
which 
are 
to 
be added 
to 
the 
faces 
whose 
centres 
are 
the 
points 
X, *Y. 
We requre 
that 
the 
faces 
APQ and__BPQ be 
coplanar, 
that 
is, 
that 
the 
line 
ANB be straight.

A5.11 
Cube

rhombic 
dodecahedron 
If 
ANB is 
a straight 
line, 
then 
GANB = 1800. 
From figure 
A5.11, 
G ANB =L 
ANX +L 
XNY +4 
YNB 
Since 
the 
solid 
figure 
is 
a cube, 
G XNY = 90°, 
and, 
by symmetry, 
L ANX =L 
YNB. 
Therefore, 
L ANX = LYNB 
= 45°. 
Therefore, 
triangles 
AXN and BYN are 
isosceles 
right- 
angled 
triangles. 
If 
the 
side 
of 
the 
original 
cube 
is 
2a, 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
figure 
A5.12, 
which 
shows 
the 
plane 
XPQ, 
that, 
by 
symmetry, 
XN ' 
a. 
Since 
triangle 
AXN is 
isosceles, 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
figure 
A5.13, 
which'shows 
the 
plane 
AXN, that 
AX = XN = a, 

342 
and, 
by Pythagoras' 
Theorem, 
AN =

From 
figure 
A5.11 
we see 
that 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
diagonals 
of 
the 
rhombic 
faces 
of 
the 
solid 
formed 
by 
adding 
pyramids 
to 
the 
cube 
is 
the 
ratio 
AN: NQ, 
i. e. J: 
1. 
I 
have 
shortened 
my proof 
by appeals 
to 
symmetry, 
but 
apart 
from 
such appeals 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
proof 
that 
cannot 
be derived 
from 
Euclid, 
and it 
seems certain 
that 
Kepler's 
repeated 
failure 
to give 
the 
ratio 
which 
describes 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
solid 
merely 
indicates 
that 
he expected 
readers 
to 
be able 
to work 
it 
out 
for 
themselves. 
The ratio 
which 
describes 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
rhombic 
faces 
of 
the 
triacontahedron 
can be found 
in 
a similar 
way, 
by considering 
pyramids 
placed 
on 
neighbouring 
faces 
of 
a Platonic 
dodecahedron. 
The ratio 
turns 
out 
to 
be ('+ 
1) 
: 2. 
It 
seems very 
likely 
that 
Kepler 
discovered 
the 
rhombic 
triacontahedron 
by 
considering 
exactly 
this 
process 
of 
adding 
pyramids 
to 
a Platonic 
dodecahedron. 
As we have 
seen, 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
and 
again 
in 

343 
N 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book V, he classes 
the 
cube, 
the 
Platonic 
dodecahedron 
and 
the 
tetrahedron 
together 
as 
"primary" 
figures, 
one 
of 
their 
"primary" 
characteristics 
being 
that 
they 
have 
the 
simplest 
kind 
of 
solid 
angle, 
one 
at 
which 
only 
three 
planes 
meet 
(Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
Ch. 
III, 
KGW 1, 
p. 
29,11.22-23). 
This 
is 
a perfectly 
valid 
mathematical 
similarity, 
and 
it 
allows 
rhombic 
solids 
to 
be constructed 
from 
each 
of 
the 
"primary" 
polyhedra: 
Kepler 
shows 
in 
Harmoniees 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
section 
XXVII 
that 
no more 
than 
three 
obtuse 
angles 
of 
rhombic 
faces 
can 
meet 
at 
a vertex 
of 
a rhombic 
solid, 
so 
we clearly 
could 
not 
apply 
the 
construction 
of 
figure 
A5.11 
to, 
say, 
the 
octahedron, 
for 
which 
four 
obtuse 
angles 
would 
have 
to meet 
at 
the 
vertices 
corresponding 
to 
the 
vertices 
of 
the 
underlying 
solid. 
It 
is 
not 
clear 
whether 
Kepler 
realised 
that 
it 
was 
this 
property 
of 
the 
vertices 
which 
was 
crucial 
in 
constructing 
rhombic 
solids 
to 
correspond 
to 
the 
"primary" 
Platonic 
figures, 
but 
since 
he lays 
considerable 
stress 
upon 
the 
distinction 
between 
"primary" 
and 
"secondary" 
solids 
it 
seems 
natural 
to 
suppose 
that 
if 
he noticed 
that 
a rhombic 
solid 
could 
be constructed 
from 
one 
of 
the 
primary 
solids 
he would 
try 
applying 
a 'similar 
construction 
to 
the 
other 
primary 
solids. 
Applying 
it 
to 
the 
Platonic 
dodecahedron 
would 
have 
given 
him 
the 
rhombic 
triacontahedron 
described 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
II 
and 
Epitome 
Book 
IV. 
Applying 
it 
to 
the 
third 
primary 
solid, 
the 
tetrahedron, 
gives 
Kepler's 
remaining 
rhombic 
solid: 
the 
cube 
(as 
can 
be seen 
from 

344 
figure 
A5.1, 
if 
we imagine 
the 
pyramids 
being 
added 
to 
the 
tetrahedron 
rather 
than 
being 
taken 
away 
from 
the 
cube). 
The 
orbs 
associated 
with 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
When we consider 
associating 
spheres 
with 
the 
rhombic 
solids, 
we come across 
a possible 
reason 
for 
Kepler's 
regarding 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
as related 
to 
the 
Platonic 
cube 
and 
octahedron, 
and 
the 
rhombic 
triacon- 
tahedron 
as related 
to 
the 
Platonic 
dodecahedron 
and 
icosahedron. 
It 
is 
clear 
from 
figures 
A5.10 
and 
A5.11 
that 
the 
six 
trilinear 
vertices 
of 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
lie 
at 
the 
vertices 
of 
a 
, 
cube 
whose 
side 
is 
the 
short 
diagonal 
of 
the 
rhombic 
faces 
of 
the 
solid. 
The 
long 
diagonals 
of 
the 
faces 
can 
be seen 
to 
be the 
edges 
of 
an octahedron 
drawn 
outside 
the 
cube, 
oriented 
in 
the 
same way 
as 
the 
octahedron 
drawn 
inside 
the 
cube 
in 
figure 
A5.3. 
The 
vertices 
of 
this 
octahedron 
are 
the 
apices 
of 
the 
pyramids 
that 
were 
added 
to 
the 
cube 
to 
form 
the 
rhombic 
solid. 
The 
relationship 
of 
the 
rhombic 
triacontahedron 
to 
the 
Platonic 
dodecahedron 
and icosahedron 
is 
similar: 
the 
short 
diagonals 
of 
the 
rhombi 
form 
the 
edges 
of 
a Platonic 
dodecahedron, 
and the 
long 
diagonals 
form 
the 
edges 
of 
an 
icosahedron. 
(Unconvinced 
readers 
are 
advised 
to 
make 
themselves 
models 
of 
the 
solids. 
) 
The 
third 
rhombic 
solid, 
the 
cube, 
is 
related 
to 
the 

li 
345 
tetrahedron, 
or 
rather 
to 
two 
interlaced 
tetrahedra. 
The 
edges 
of 
one 
tetrahedron 
are 
formed 
by 
the 
diagonals 
shown 
in 
figure 
A5.1, 
the 
edges 
of 
the 
other 
are 
formed 
by 
the 
remaining 
diagonals. 
A line 
in 
De Nive 
Sexangula 
appears 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
resultant 
pair 
of 
interlaced 
tetrahedra 
"(for 
the 
cube 
is 
the 
third, 
related 
to 
two 
tetrahedra 
fitted 
together)" 
(De Nive 
Sexangula, 
p. 
7, 
KGW 4, 
p. 
266,11.14-15). 
The 
discovery 
of 
this 
solid 
is 
usually 
ascribed 
to 
Kepler, 
for 
example 
by Coxeter 
(1975), 
though 
there 
is 
a picture 
of 
it 
in 
Pacioli's 
De Divina 
Proportione 
(Venice, 
1509), 
where 
it 
is 
con- 
structed 
as a "raised 
octahedron" 
(see 
figure 
A5.11). 
Since 
diagonals 
of 
the 
rhombic 
faces 
form 
edges 
of 
regular 
polyhedra, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
there 
are 
three 
spheres 
associated 
with 
each 
of 
the 
rhombic 
solids. 
(1) 
The 
insphere, 
which 
touches 
the 
solid 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
each 
of 
its 
faces. 
(Since 
these 
centres 
are 
the 
mid 
points 
of 
the 
edges 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solid 
from 
which 
the 
rhombic 
solid 
has 
been 
constructed, 
this 
insphere 
of 
the 
rhombic 
solid 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
midsphere 
of 
the 
inner 
Platonic 
solid.

namely 
the 
sphere 
which 
passes 
through 
the 
vertices 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solid 
whose

are 
the 
short 
diagonals 
of 
the 
rhombic 
faces.

is 
the

of

It 
is 
clear 
that 
in 
order 
to 
calculate 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
three 
spheres 
associated 
with 
each 
of 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
we only 
need 
to 
be able 
to 
calculate 
radii 
of 
circumspheres, 
inspheres 
and 
midspheres 
of 
the 
approp- 
riate 
Platonic 
solids, 
and 
scale 
the 
results 
according 
to 
whether 
the 
side 
of 
the, 
Platonic 
solid 
is 
the 
short 
or 
the 
long 
diagonal 
of 
the 
rhombic 
face. 
Kepler 
showed 
how 
to 
calculate 
the 
radii 
of 
circumspheres 
and 
inspheres 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 
in 
Chapter 
XIII 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum, 
giving 
a table 
of 
numerical 
values, 
to 
three 
or 
four 
figures, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
chapter. 
Caspar's 
note 
supplies 
the 
surds 
from 
which 
these 
values 
have 
been 
calculated 
(KGW 1, 
p. 
46 and 
p. 
1425). 
Kepler 
appears 
to 
ignore 
midspheres, 
though 
he has 
in 
fact 
calculated 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
midsphere 
of 
the 
octa- 
hedron 
when 
he considers 
"the 
sphere 
in 
the 
square 
of 
the 
octahedron" 
as 
an alternative 
method 
of 
finding 
the 
aphelion 
sphere 
of 
Mercury 
(see 
Chapter 
III 
above). 
However, 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
midsphere 
to 
the 
circumsphere 
is 
very 
simple, 
as 
can 
be seen 
from 
figure 
A5.15 
in 
which 
0 is 
the 
centre 
of 
both 
spheres 
and 
N the 
centre 
of 
an 
edge. 
By symmetry, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
LONA 
= 900. 
Let 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
circumsphere, 
OA = Rc, 
and the 

348 
radius 
of 
the midsphere, 
ON = Rm, and let 
the 
side 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solid 
be 2a. 
Then 
AN = a, 
and 
in 
the 
plane 
ONA we have 
the

I have

because 
it

the

holds 
for 
all

The 
work 
in 
Chapter 
XIII 
of 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
will 
therefore 
enable 
us 
to 
calculate 
all 
the 
radii 
we require 
for

The 
rhombic 
solids 
and 
the 
moons 
of 
Jupiter 
Kepler 
suggested 
in 
his 
Dissertatio 
cum Nuncio 
Sidereo 
(Prague, 
1610) 
that 
the 
spacing 
of 
the 
orbits 
of 
the 
newly-discovered 
moons 
of 
Jupiter 
might 
be derived 
from 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
(KGW 14, p. 
309,1.35 
et 
seqq, 
see 
Chapter 
IV 
above). 
At 
that 
time, 
no measurements 
of 
the 
diameters 
of 
the 
orbits 
were 
available, 
but 
when Kepler 
came 
to 
write 
Book 
IV 
of 
the 
Epitome 
(Linz, 
1620), 
the 
diameters 
of 
the 
orbits 
had 
been 
found 
to 
be in 
the 
ratios 
3: 
5: 
8: 
13, 
according 
to 
Mayr, 
and 
3: 
5: 
8: 
14, 
according 
to 
Galileo. 
The 
passage 
in 
the 
Dissertatio 
is 
necessarily 
vague, 
but 
in 
the 
Epitome 
Kepler 
suggests 
that 
the 
rhombic 
dodecahedron 
should 
be placed 
between 
the 
innermost 
moons, 

351 
the 
radii 
of 
whose 
orbs 
are 
in 
the 
ratio 
3: 
5 (KGW 7, 
p. 
318,11.41-42). 
He does 
not 
say 
which 
orbs 
of 
the 
polyhedron 
should 
be considered 
in 
the 
comparison 
and 
he does 
not 
give 
any 
values 
of 
radii. 
He is 
similarly 
vague 
in 
placing 
the 
rhombic 
triacontahedron 
between 
the 
next 
pair 
of 
moons, 
the 
radii 
of 
whose 
orbs 
are 
in 
the 
ratio 
5: 
8, 
and 
the 
cube 
between 
the 
outermost 
pair 
(KGW 7, 
p. 
318,11.42-44).

The 
values 
in 
this 
table 
make 
it 
clear 
that, 
although 
the 
theory 
may explain 
the 
number 
of 
the 
moons, 
it 
gives 
only 
a very 
rough 
account 
of 
the 
spacing 
of 
their 
orbits. 
They 
do, 
however, 
suggest 
that 
Kepler 
was 
inclined 
to 
accept 
Galileo's 
value 
for 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
outermost 
orbit 
rather 
than 
Mayr's, 
since 
he has 
put 
the 
solids 
in 
an order 
which 
assumes 
that 
the 
outermost 
space 
is 
the 
largest 
one. 
Nevertheless, 
Kepler 
does 
not 
mention 
that 
he has 
done 
this, 
and 
he does 
not 
present 
any 
mathe- 
matical 
reasons 
which 
might 
justify 
his 
ordering 
of 
the 
solids 
as 
he 
justified 
his 
ordering 
of 
the 
Platonic 
solids 

/ 
352 
in 
the 
Mysterium 
Cosmographicum 
(see 
Chapter 
III 
above). 
I presume 
that 
this 
rather 
perfunctory 
treatment 
of 
his 
theory 
is 
Kepler's 
oblique 
method 
of 
passing 
an un- 
favourable 
judgement 
on it, 
a judgement 
which 
no doubt 
accounts 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
he presents 
no archetype 
for 
the 
satellite 
system 
of 
Jupiter 
in 
Harmonices 
Mundi 
Book 
V, 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
rhombic 
solids 
had 
been 
described 
in 
Book 
II. 
After 
this 
unsatisfactory 
episode 
concerning 
the 
rhombic 
solids, 
Kepler 
goes 
on to 
show 
that 
the 
observed 
diameters 
of 
the 
satellite 
orbits 
and 
the 
observed 
periods 
of 
the 
orbital 
motions 
agree 
very 
well 
with 
his 
third 
law 
(Epitome 
IV, 
pp. 
554-555, 
KGW 7, 
p. 
318,1.44 
to 
p. 
319,1.3).

GLOSSARY 
I 
have 
included 
in 
this 
glossary 
words 
which 
I 
am 
aware 
of 
having 
used 
in 
a technical 
sense 
not 
found 
in 
the 
Shorter 
Oxford 
English 
Dictionary. 
Element 
of 
an orbit. 
The 
elements 
of 
a planetary 
orbit 
are 
six 
parameters 
required 
to 
describe 
it 
completely. 
They 
include 
the 
eccentricity 
of 
the 
ellipse, 
the 
length 
of 
its 
major 
axis, 
the 
inclination 
of 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
orbit 
to 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
ecliptic 
and 
the 
period 
of 
the 
planet. 
Homogeneous. 
At 
any 
given 
time 
a homogeneous 
Universe 
would 
present 
the 
same appearance 
to 
every 
observer, 
wherever 
he was situated. 
Isotropic. 
A Universe 
is 
said 
to 
be isotropic 
at 
a given 
point 
if 
to 
an observer 
at 
that 
point 
it 
looks 
the 
same 
in 
all 
directions. 
By extension, 
the 
adjective 
"isotropic" 
is 
sometimes 
used 
to 
mean 
"isotropic 
at 
all 
points" 
(e. g. 
by Weinberg, 
1977, 
p. 
160). 
Musical. 
In 
Celestial 
Mechanics, 
ratios 
are 
said 
to 
be 
musical 
if 
they 
can 
be expressed 
in 
terms 
of 
small 
integers, 
such 
as 
2: 3. 
"Small" 
is 
usually 
deemed 
to 
extend 
to 
about 
7. 
Examples 
of 
such 
ratios 
are 
found 
among 
the 
periods 
of 
some of 
the 
satellites 
of 
Jupiter 

355 
(Nieto, 
1972, 
p. 
43). 
See 
also 
resonance. 
ke 
Nova. 
Kepler 
and 
his 
contemporaries 
used 
to 
word 
nova 
in 
its 
primary 
sense 
of 
a new 
(or 
apparently 
new) 
star. 
In 
modern 
astronomy 
it 
denotes 
an object 
(probably 
one 
star 
in 
a binary 
system) 
which 
undergoes 
an outburst 
that 
causes 
a temporary 
increase 
in 
luminosity 
of 
about 
six 
magnitudes. 
For 
a particular 
object, 
this 
type 
of 
outburst 
is 
repeated 
at 
more 
or 
less 
regular 
intervals. 
Compare 
supernova. 
Rational. 
A number 
is 
said 
to 
be rational 
if 
it 
can be 
expressed 
as a ratio 
between 
two 
integers, 
e. g. 
17.4 
" 
is 
rational 
(174/10), 
r2 
is 
not. 
In 
geometry 
a magnitude 
is 
said 
to 
be rational 
if 
it 
can 
be measured 
in 
terms 
of 
some 
given 
measure. 
Kepler 
finds 
the 
word 
"rational" 
misleading 
and 
prefers 
to 
use 
"expressible" 
(see 
Chapter 
V above). 
Euclid, 
and 
Kepler, 
also 
use 
the 
word 
now 
rendered 
by 
"rational" 
to 
cover 
what 
would 
now be called 
"rational 
in 
the 
square". 
Resonance. 
A system 
of 
orbits 
is 
said 
to 
be in 
resonance 
if 
the 
periods 
can be combined 
to 
give 
one or more 
relations 
of 
the 
form 
aln1 
+ a2n2 
+ a3n3 
+ ... 
= constant, 
where 
nj, 
n2, 
n3 etc 
are 
the 
periods 
and 
a,, 
a2, 
a3 
etc 
are 
small 
integers 
(less 
than 
about. 
7). 
A striking 
example 
of 
resonance 
is 
found 
in 
the 
system 
of 
satellites 

356 
of 
Jupiter, 
where 
the 
periods 
of 
Io 
(n1), 
Europa 
(n2). 
and 
Ganymede 
(n3) 
satisfy 
the 
equation 
nj 
- 
3n2 + 2n3 
w0 
to 
an accuracy 
of 
nine 
significant 
figures 
(Nieto, 
1972, 
p. 
44). 
Supernova. 
A supernova 
is 
a catastrophic 
outburst 
which 
entirely 
disrupts 
a star, 
leaving 
behind 
only 
a small 
core 
(which 
becomes 
a neutron 
star 
or 
a pulsar). 
There 
are 
two 
types 
of 
supernova. 
In 
the 
less 
energetic 
type, 
the 
object 
rapidly 
increases 
in 
brightness 
by roughly 
eleven 
magnitudes 
before 
fading 
again, 
and 
the 
total 
energy 
of 
the 
outburst 
is 
about 
a factor 
105 greater 
than 
that 
of 
a nova. 
A star 
only 
becomes 
a supernova 
once. 
The 
"new 
star" 
which 
appeared 
in 
October 
1604 
was 
a 
supernova 
of 
the 
type 
I 
have 
described 
(see 
Chapter 
II 
above).
