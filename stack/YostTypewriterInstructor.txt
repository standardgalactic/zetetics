INTRODUCTION. 
LEARNING HOW TO USE A TYPEWRITER. 
JT is hardly worth while to say that any one can learn to use the typewriter; this is 
apparent after a moment’s trial. There is scarcely any machine that is so simple 
in its operation—certainly not even the sewing machine ; and there is none whose speedy 
and correct manipulation can be more readily obtained by methodical study and practice 
than this very simple instrument. There are generally two ways of doing a thing : a right 
way and a wrong way ; and he or she who starts on the wrong road is pretty sure to get 
farther and farther away from the point of destination, while the one who starts right is 
very certain to “ get there ” in reasonable time. 
Therefore, it is the advice of one who has had much experience with typewriters and 
typewritists, to begin right, by studying the method of fingering set forth and practicing 
the exercises given in this book. 
DIFFERENT KEY-BOARDS. 
There are two editions of this book published, differing only in the numerical fingering 
marked for the word-exercises, viz.; 
1. Remington Key-Board Edition, to accommodate those who, having become 
somewhat familiar with the arrangement of the letters in the Remington machine, prefer 
not to change. 
2. The Scientific Key-Board Edition, in which the distribution of letters to the 
keys is very much different. It was devised by the author of this book, after twelve years’ 
experience in the use of the typewriter, his first Remington machine being No. 275. 
Having been for many years a printer, and familiar with the proportionate frequency in 
the use of letters in spelling the English language, he sought to apply this experience in 
selecting the most convenient location for those most used, considering also their order of 
succession. This is an earnest effort to secure a scientific, as well as a more facile, 
arrangement of the key-board.

SCIENCE OF'typewriter FINGERING. 
The author assumes, as the basis of his scheme, the following propositions, some 
of which are self-evident ; all are capable of demonstration and have been thoroughly 
tested : 
1. That all standard typewriters are now operated with all the fingers of both hands, 
and that in nearly all reputable schools where their use is taught that method prevails. 
2. That a methodical and uniform manner of fingering the keys is far better than a 
haphazard, irregular way, both in obtaining speed and accuracy ; and this can only be 
accomplished by assigning a certain finger to each key, with which to begin words 
especially, and with which, whenever practicable, to strike such key. 
3. That the first and second fingers of each hand are certainly the most easily and 
forcibly used in the manipulation of the keys, and therefore the more frequently they are 
used, systematically, the better ; and on the other hand, the less frequently the third and 
fourth fingers are required, the better. 
4. That the arrangement of the letters in the key-board should be such as to give the 
most frequently recurring letters to the first and second fingers, that is, in the central 
portion. 
5. That such arrangement favors the ability to “ write by touch,” or by position; in 
other words, to manipulate the keys without keeping the eyes on the key-board, but on the 
copy, which contributes greatly to the amount of work that can be done on any typewriter 
in a given time. 
With these facts in mind, compare the following key-boards, in which the keys are 
marked with the number of the finger usually employed to strike it; also with figures 
indicating the relative frequency with which each letter is employed in ordinary English 
composition, as given in “ Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrases and Fable.” The footing of 
figures under each ist, 2d, 3d and 4th finger letters show, approximately, the total number 
of strokes given by each finger in a piece of composition containing the letter “ e ” 
1,000 times,

YOST TYPEWRITER INSTRUCTOR, 5 
The footing of the sums apportioned to the several fingers show that the fourth finger 
of the left hand is required to strike 305 more strokes than the fourth finger of the right 
hand ; that the third finger of the left hand is required to strike 796 more strokes than 
the same finger of the right hand ; that the same weak finger has to strike 716 more 
strokes, in the same time, than its stronger adjoining brother, the second finger, and 464 
strokes more than the robust first finger ; that the third and fourth fingers of the left hand 
do more service (in addition to making the capital shift) than the first and second fingers 
of the same hand, and more than twice as much as the same fingers of the right hand ; 
and that the left hand does nearly one-fourth more work than the tight hand, allowing that 
the capital shifting by the left hand, and the spacing by the right hand equal each other. 
It is evident that this arrangement is hard on the left hand, and especially hard on 
the third and fourth fingers of that hand ; and, on account of this overtaxing of the least 
serviceable of all the eight fingers, it is certain that comfort and speed are seriously 
sacrificed. 
It is said “by one who knows,” that the reason for this disproportionate division of 
service was that the builder of the Remington was a “ left-handed man.” 
Now examine the Standard Key-Board, which was made to conform as far as prac¬ 
ticable to those of the Remington and Caligraph, so that persons familiar with either of 
these machines can use the Yost without much trouble.

It will be seen that the weak fourth finger of the left hand has to make but 118 
strokes to the 800 required on the Remington ; the third finger, 1,396 to the Remington’s 
1,916 ; while the strong second and first fingers are required to make 1,648 and 1,618 
respectively, to the 1,200 and 1,454 required by the Remington ; that the same fairpropor-

tion of duty is allotted to each finger of the right hand ; and that, including the striking 
of the hyphen, punctuation marks, and moving the "carriage, the right hand is required to 
do as much work as the left hand—if not more. 
But by far the most important advantage resulting from this arrangement of the key¬ 
board lies in the fact that the letters are so collocated that all the keys, on either side, 
may be struck with the appropriate fingers of the hand assigned them with the fewest 
possible exceptions : and not only so, but that in consequence of this, the rule of alternaiion, 
so essential to a free, easy and rapid manipulation of the keys, is found to be practicable. 
IMPORTANCE OF A SCIENTIFIC ARRANGEMENT. 
“Science,” says Webster, “ is literally knowledge, but more usually denotes a system¬ 
atic and orderly arrangement of knowledge.” The assignment of certain fingers to certain 
keys, which fingers are required to strike their respective keys always, under the same 
circumstances, such as at the beginning of words, and when the second hand takes up 
the spelling of a word begun by the first, may be truly regarded as scientific ; and, though 
seemingly contrarywise, after any finger shall have struck its proper key, and the next 
letter is marked for the same finger, to relieve that said finger and strike the key with the 
adjoining finger, and the one following it with the next adjoining, and so on, is in like 
manner consistent. Also, when in printing a word all the consecutive fingers are exhausted, 
and there remains still another letter that should ordinarily be printed with the same hand, 
a fixed rule that such remaining letter shall be printed with the first finger of the other 
hand, would accord with the principles of science. But to make arbitrary exceptions, as 
all authors have heretofore done, and strike the key for the first letter in a word sometimes 
with one finger and sometimes with another, for the purpose of getting the second, third 
or fourth fingers to their respective keys, would, in the writer’s judgment, be of such 
exceptional character as to require the arbitrary memorizing of such exceptional words, 
extending to thousands in a diversified experience, and, therefore, would be unscientific 
and difficult to practice. 
Music is a science, but he who attempts to practice it as an art, and, in his ignorance 
of its rules of harmony, violates its first principles, produces discord and murders music. 
So, if his instrument is not in tune, and he is not aware of the fact, the same result follows. 
Dancing is based on the science of motion, and so long as the waltzers keep step with 
each other, or the various members of a cotillion “ forward and back,” “ swing corners,” 
“ promenade all,” etc., according to rule, the performance is graceful and exhilarating ; 
but let one or two mis-steps be taken, and confusion and disorder will prevail. 

(REMINGTON KEY-BOARD EDITION.) 
VOST TYPEWRITER INSTRUCTOR. 7 
Just so it is with the typewritist. If his instrument is not in tune, if the key-board is 
not in harmorwy with the peculiarities of the English language, or if he fails to touch the 
right keys, and, regardless of the sequence of letters, jumps about from one key to another 
at haphazard, the rhythm of the clicking types is lost, the unity and regularity of motion 
are interfered with, speed is checked, blunders are made, and the unscientific operator is 
compelled to halt and take a new start. 
Whether or not the author has so reconstructed the typewriter key-board as to render 
it possible to make the art of typewriting conform strictly to scientific principles, is for 
methodical and skillful operators on the various instruments to demonstrate, as they have 
opportunity. He has honestly aimed to take at least a considerable step in that direction, 
and hopes that he has to some extent succeeded. 
CHANGE CP KEY-BOARD EASILY MADE. 
The manufacturers, and generally the dealers, will furnish any arrangement of the 
key-board desired ; but if a person already has a machine with the Remington arrangement, 
and desires to adopt the new and better way, he can readily do so by making the change 
himself, thus : Take a pair of small pinchers and pull from their sockets (with a little 
twisting), the types that need to be transposed, and insert the ones required in their places. 
Observe that, in placing the types in the socket, the top of the letter is toward you ; set it 
in loosely, then with the proper key press it slowly into the guide, which operation will 
adjust it to a perfect alignment with all the others. Before releasing the key, give it a 
few strong taps, so as to tighten it in its place. 
DIRECTIONS TO THE LEARNER. 
The typewriter should be placed on a stand, or table, that is about six inches lower 
than an ordinary writing table ; or, instead of this, the learner should sit on a stool six or 
eight inches higher than a chair. This position is necessary to enable the operator, when 
sitting upright, to reach the key-board without elevating the fore-arms from their natural 
level, which will afford the greatest freedom of the fingers. 
The feet should rest squarely on the floor, the chest be thrown a little forward ; and, 
to avoid stooping, the Lesson Book, or copy, should be suspended at a convenient height 
and inclination to the light in one of the many Holders made for the purpose. 
To place the paper in the machine : Lift the dog out of the ratchet wheel on the right 
hand end of the roller, by depressing the lever under it ; then stand the paper vertically 
between the two rollers, steadying it at first with both hands ; next, with the left hand, turn 

(REMINGTON KEY-BOARD EDITION.) 
8 VOST TYPEWRITER INSTRUCTOR. 
the large roller from you, by using the thumb and the first finger of the left hand on the 
serrated end of said roller, until the paper is carried to the desired position. Now press 
the thumb under the lever and let the dog drop into the notched wheel again. With the 
thumb-handle and lever beneath, revolve the roller and draw the carriage back to the right 
as far as it will go for a new line. 
All is now ready for work, but before beginning the exercise of words and sentences 
on the opposite page, the learner is advised to take a little 
DRILL ON THE TOUCH OP THE KEYS. 
First, observe the imaginary division of the key-board, obliquely, between the five keys 
on the right and the five on the left. (See diagram, p. 5). Then place the four fingers 
of each hand over the four keys to the right and to the left of the division in the lower 
row, and see how readily they may each be touched with the appropriate finger : also, 
how readily the thumb of the right hand may drop upon the space-bar. 
Now, with a quick, firm tap, strike the first key to the right of the division^ with the 
first finger of the right hand ; and immediately afterward the first key to the left with 
the first finger of the left hand ; then the space-bar with the thumb. Repeat the operation 
to the end of the line, then draw the carriage back to be ready for another line. 
Next strike two keys on each side of the division, thus : i, 2, space ; i, 2, space ; 
and repeat, for two or three lines, a little faster each time, until it can be done readily. 
Then take three keys on each side, thus : i, 2, 3, space ; i, 2, 3, space. Repeat as 
before ; and vary the exercise by using the second and third lines of keys. 
Finally, bring into play the fourth finger, on the second row of keys, thus : i, 2, 
3, 4, space ; I, 2, 3, 4, space. Repeat as often as necessary to do the work without 
hesitation. 
In ihe above drill you will pay no attention to the letters you are striking; but you may now study 
the arrangement of the letters somewhat, by printing the alphabet from U io z several times, before beginning 
the Exercise on the next page.

A good man will never teach what he does not believe to be true. 
“ An honest man’s the noblest work of God ” is a saying of great truth. 
Good health alone usually makes mankind quite happy. 
Honesty is the best policy at any and all times. 
It is the greatest folly in a man to wish only to be wise. 
Never praise the faults of mankind—praise only that which has merit. 
Possession is nine points of the law and they say there are but twelve. 
The head is ever the slave of the heart. This may not be exactly true. 
The proper study of mankind is man. Teach only the useful and true. 
To believe we are able to do a thing is almost as good as being able. 
Generally we praise because we expect in turn to be praised. 
We should not as a rule judge of a man’s merit by his ability. 
Wisdom is to the soul what health is to the body ; therefore be wise. 
Work while you work, and play while you play, every hour in the day. 
You can not judge of a man until you have heard his whole story.

Anywhere in the United States 
In the course of human events. 
During much of that time. 
Better than was ever known before. 
Nowhere in the wide world. 
Without labor land is of little value. 
Young people should read much and talk little. 
Much has been said on this question. 
Books are cheap, and young people should read only the best. 
Children when young make parents fools ; when older the fools are wiser. 
Every person of good judgment values merit in all mankind. 
Falsehood may sometimes make a friend, but it is sure to make enemies. 
Half of a fact is often worse than a whole falsehood. 
Honor father and mother, that your days may be long in the land. 
Keep your word with your child the same as with your banker. 
Knowledge without practice amounts to little in a profession. 
Labor is better paid in the United States than anywhere else. 
Money is by most persons said to be the measure of values. 
People who live much alone usually become weak and narrow-minded. 
Poverty and politics bring men to strange bed-fellows. 
The question with the court was, what was true and what was false. 
The banker paid the man his money without asking a single question. 
Without health what is wealth, even in the most happy land ? 
Exercise on all the Letters of the Alphabet.—(6) John quickly made five or six 
good sized powder buckets. 
6. This sentence, also the one on the previous page of the same kind, are good not only for enabling 
one to learn the location of letters, but in the future use of the machine in testing the cleanliness or perfection 
of all the types.

Of two evils choose the least. 
The end must justify the means. 
Through thick and through thin. 
There are gains for all our losses. 
Useful labor is always honorable. 
Variety is the spice of life. 
A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Forever is a very long time. 
A man should never be ashamed to own he has been in the wrong. 
.\nger makes a rich man hated and a poor man scorned. 
Better to know much of a few things than a little of many. 
Beware of an enemy half reconciled, as of a doubtful'friend. 
Coming events cast their shadows before. There’s a good time coming. 
Common sense is the product of patience, justice and charity. 
“ God helps those who help themselves,” is a fact worth knowing. 
He is truly the freeman whom the truth makes free 
Liberty and union, one and inseparable, now and forever. 
Many persons labor too much, others too little ; yet'labor is honorable. 
‘‘ Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute,” said the patriot. 
Payment for land must be made in the gold coin of the United States. 
Strength is born of struggle, weakness of doubt or despair. 
Value not the almighty dollar above health, honor and truth.

A little wrong done to another is a great wrong done to ourselves. 
Endeavor to be perfect in the calling in which you are engaged. 
Nothing valuable is lost by civilit)S. Ready money is a reliable friend. 
Prejudice is positive opinion without perfect judgment. 
Pray with a view to practice, and practice with a view to prayer. 
Stock in store is much better than any doubtful debts. 
The useful and the beautiful are never very far asunder. 
There is very little faith where there is no charity. 
Think nothing unworthy which has a bearing on deserved success. 
When one works faithfully for another he really works for himself. 
WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT. 
“ We are the hewers and delvers who toil for another’s gain, 
“ The comm n clods and the rabble, stunted of brow and brain ; 
“ What do we want, the gleaners, of the harvest we have reaped ? 
“ What do we want, the workers, of the honey we have heaped ? 
“ We want the drones to be driven away from our golden hoard ; 
“ We want to share in the harvest: we want to sit at the board ; 
“We want what sword or suffrage has never yet won for man : 
“ The fruits of his toil God promised when the curse of toil began.” 
8. Speed Practice should be limited to sentences that have been thoroughly studied and carefully 
written many times ; accuracy first, and then speed. Do not permit yourself to get into the habit of making 
mistakes, if you expect ever to obtain and retain employment as a typewritist.

10. Repetit.ON.—It is not sufficient to simply write this Exercise, and the next, two or three times. 
Each phrase should first be written a dozen times or more ; and, after getting the right fingering of each 
word, repeat several times, each time a little faster than before. 
11. The meaning of the Latin terms in this page and the next better be learned from an unabridged 
dictionary. Do not fail to underscore them.

EXERCISE IX. 
For the purpose of acquiring readiness and accuracy in writing the beginnings and 
endings of large classes of words, the pupil is recommended to drill Ijis fingers thoroughly 
in the proper manipulation of the following prefixes and affixes. Repeat each one several 
times, and the more difficult ones many times, a little faster each time if possible. It 
would be well to return to the Exercise two or three times a week until the proper 
fingering becomes a habit.

REVIEW OF PRINCIPLES. 
The learner, having now mastered the proper fingering of a large portion of the usual 
words employed in business and the professions, it will be well to take a critical review of 
the principles involved in their manipulation. This will enable the observing typewritist 
to preserve the correctness of his fingering in actual work, and also to apply the same rules 
to all words that may come up in the Exercises that follow, and in all his future use of any 
typewriter. Therefore, let each one answer the following questions, either orally to the 
teacher or by writing the answers in the blank lines succeeding. 
1. What are the letters struck by the first finger of the left hand, etc. ? 
A. 
2. What are the letters struck by the second finger of the left hand, etc. ? 
A. 
3. What are the letters struck by the third finger of the left hand, etc. ? 
A. 
4. What are the letters struck by the fourth finger of the left hand, etc. ? 
A. 
5. What are the exceptional letters on the left-hand side of the key-board? A. (Ex¬ 
plain the exceptions with illustrative words.) 
6. What are the letters struck by the first finger of the right hand when beginning a 
word or part of a word ? A. 
7. What are the letters struck by the second finger of the right hand, etc. ? 
A. 
8. What are the letters struck by the third finger of the right hand, etc. ? 
A. 
9. What are the letters struck by the fourth finger of the right hand, etc. ? 
A. 
TO. If there are any exceptional letters on the right-hand side of the key-board, name 
and explain them ? A. 
II. If, after having struck a certain key with its proper finger, the next letter in a word 
calls for the same finger, what is to be done ? A.

VOST TYPEWRITER INSTRUCTOR. 
WRITING BY POSITION 
With the knowledge well in hand, as well as in mind, as to what fingers are to be used 
in striking the several letters of the alphabet, any one can soon acquire the habit of writing 
with only occasional glances at the key-board, which may properly be termed wriiifig by 
position, rather than “by touch,” as described by some writers. To do so most satisfac¬ 
torily one should always sit squarely in front of the machine, keep the thumb of the right 
hand on the space-bar or key, and the fourth finger of the left hand, when at rest for the 
moment, on the extreme left-hand key of the lower row ; all of which enables the 
operator to know just where all his fingers are with reference to any letter of the alphabet. 
The fact that blind persons have learned to use the typewriter readily proves that the 
skill of writing by position can be attained, and the ability to thus manipulate the machine 
enables one to keep his or her eye on the copy, and thus read while writing. The result of 
this ability is termed “continuous writing,” and is of great importance in becoming a rapid 
and profitable typewritist. It enables one to do at least twice as much work in a given 
time as can be accomplished by the person who first reads a sentence or clause and then 
writes it; reads again and writes again ; thus writing but half the time. 
Tq begin this kind of practice, the learner better turn back to the first or second 
Exercise, and train his mind and fingers on short familiar words. This practice should be 
repeated, more or less, every day, until the method can be applied in all future Exercises 
of this book ; so that when you come to do actual work for an employer there will be 
no ground for complaint that you spend half your time in trying to read your copy or 
your notes. 
The Eight-Finger Method alone enables one to writeor “ continuously,” 
with any degree of accuracy ; and the practice of always writing the same words and 
syllables in the same way, which this method favors, should be scrupulously adhered to, as 
it contributes largely to the speedy success of your efforts in this direction. 
KEY-BOARD FOR STUDY. 
The following blank key-board may be used with advantage by the learner, both in 
answering the Review questions on the preceding page and in drilling the “ mind’s eye ” 
to a reliable knowledge of the position of each and every key.

CORRESPONDENCE. 
We now approach the practical work of the typewritist. If the learner has studied 
well the rudimental Exercises thus far given, he or she is fully prejtared to commence the 
formal practice of the art, in the way of letter-writing and the copying of business and 
professional papers. As the former is the line of work to which beginners are most 
generally called, we will first direct their attention to a few points with which they should 
become familiar, in the formation of business letters, in order to give satisfaction to the 
cultivated and artistic eye of an employer. 
1. The heading of a letter, like the head-dress of a lady or gentleman, should be 
uniformly symmetrical and graceful in appearance, and conform to the taste or wish of 
the proprietor of the house where one is emplox ed. Therefore, his style should be con¬ 
sulted, and not varied from unless by his permission and ajjproval. It is always safe, for a 
time at least, to follow the style of your predecessor in doing the writing for an establish¬ 
ment, and to introduce innovations, even for the better, gradually and modestly. 
2. Nearly every business or professional ofhce has its printed letter-heads, under 
which letters must be written. Generally they are so arranged as to leave a blank after the 
name of the city where located, into which the name of the month and the date are to be 
printed, thus : 
Washington, D. C.,..... 189. 
It is often quite difficult to get the sheet into a machine so as to print exactly on the 
blank line, and insert the figure after 189.... ; and it requires more time to so adjust it than 
it would take to print the whole line. A better arrangement is, to have the printed letter¬ 
heading terminate with the name of the city and state in about the middle of the line ; then 
write with the machine, on the line below and just to the right, the name of the month, 
date, and year, as in Form i on the next page. 
3 If entirely blank letter paper is used, the date line should begin on 30, unless the 
name of the city and state are longer than usual, when it is better to begin on 25. [See 
Form 2.] Never insert “th ” after the date in a head line ; they are only proper in such 
phraseology as ‘‘on the 15th January,” “after the loth inst.,” etc. 
4. Always begin the address on i of the Scale, and write only the name of the person 
or firm on that line, closing with a comma ; revolve the roller at that point, and there begin 
printing the name of the city and state to which the letter is to be sent, instead of moving 
the carriage back to 5 or 10, and thus save many tiresome movements in the course of eight 
or ten hours’ writing. If the letter is to have a street address, it is well to insert it on the 
next line below, for fear it may not be at hand when the envelope is to be written. 
5. Next throw the carriage clear back to i of the Scale, for printing the term 
‘‘ Dear Sir,” “ Gentlemen,” etc., which should occupy a line by itself, and be followed by a 
colon or two hyphens ; but on the “ National,” to avoid the necessity of using a shifting- 
key it is just as well to affix the comma. At this point revolve the roller, for the reason 
given in paragraph 4, and begin the body of the letter just there. 
6. Subsequent paragraphs indent uniformly to 5 on the Scale. At the close, begin 
“Yours truly,” or their equivalent, on 25 or 30, so as to have plenty of room for the 
signature to follow on the line beneath, without having to pull the carriage back, and in 
order to leave a blank above the name that it may stand out symmetrically by itself. 
7. Letters look better, as a general thing, if written with a double spacing between 
lines ; but in the case of lengthy correspondence, it is desirable to save not only paper but 
the extra work of copying additional sheets in the letter-press * therefore it is allowable to 
write such letters with a single spacing.

Dear Sir: 
You wrote us some time ago in regard to a 
patent, and we write now to suggest the importance of 
making an application at the earliest possible day. 
During the early winter and spring months applications 
pour into the Patent Office by thousands, made by in¬ 
ventors who vainly hope to get their patents issued in 
time for the spring trade. As a result there is a glut 
of applications, more than the U. S. Patent Office can 
handle. The rule ‘‘first come first served’’ prevails; 
every [100] case must be taken up and examined deliber¬ 
ately in the order of its class and date of filing. 
The consequences are delay, vexation, and loss. 
Our advice is, therefore, for your own interest 
more than ours, since we are assured of your business 
some time at any rate.

Respected Sir: 
We herewith enclose you our illustrated 
circular, and trust you may be interested in the Aldine 
Fire-Place, inasmuch as its operation tends to promote 
the good health of those using it. The sanitary results 
are produced by *^^^no other grate or heater on the 
market; and for the nursery, sick-room, dining-room, 
office or sleeping-room, the warm floors, equalized 
temperature, constant and uniform heat and ventilation 
produced, with the utmost economy of fuel, fills a 
long-felt want, and renders the Aldi ne . the [100] mos t 
desirable grate ever placed upon the market. 
The stove has long and loudly been denounced by 
our best physicians and thinking people, as it affords 
no means of escape for the vitiated air and poisonous 
gases which it generates, and which are a constant 
menace to good health. Hot air or steam furnaces are 
but little better, unless provided with proper venti¬ 
lation. Direct draft grates are enormous consumers of 
fuel, uncleanly in their use, create draughts through¬ 
out the rooms in which they are located, and produce 
none of the superior conditions to be had through the 
use of the Aldine. [200] Through the return draught prin¬ 
ciple we are enabled to consume the hot smoke and gases 
in the combustion chambers in the base, get up a cir¬ 
culation of warm air, whereby we produce warm floors, 
thus obviating the condition of hot air about the head 
and cold air about the feet, and equalize the temper¬ 
ature from floor to ceiling. We also get slow and 
perfect combustion of fuel, with great economy.

To Agents and Freight Conductors-- 
Much inconvenience, and sometimes loss, is sus¬ 
tained by this Company through the unwarranted changing 
of car numbers on way-bills. Any disagreement between 
way-bill and car number that may be discovered should 
be reported promptly to Division Superintendent, by 
telegraph. Hereafter no person must under any circum¬ 
stances make alterations of this kind without specific 
directions from Division Office. 
Agents at destination receiving way-bills in which 
such changes have been made, must use great care to see 
that the freight he delivers is that actually called 
for by the way-bill. [100]

3, The ■* underscore"" is the long dash that, when printed in the same line with the types, produces the 
continuous line close under the words, and is used to suggest emphasis in reading, or to indicate to the printer 
that such words are to be put in italic types for the same purpose. In the “ National” machine it is produced 
by depressing the shifting key for “ marks,” and striking the letter-key for H as often as necessary. 
4, This is supposed to be the Quaker, or Friends’ style of dating and writing a letter. 
5, When the title, or profession, of a correspondent is lengthy, it will look better to set it back under the 
name, as here shown. 
6, This is an excellent form for railroad correspondence, especially with the Yost machine. 
Note.—Students having special lines of work in view, such as legal, insurance, railroading, etc., should

phraseology and forms there given to such letters.

SPECIALTIES IN LETTER WRITING. 
1. Dictating to the Machine., as it is called, is under some circumstances found to be 
a saving of time and labor. If the party dictating speaks slowly, and the typewritist is a 
fast operator, shorthand can be dispensed with for the time being, and letters written 
directly from the mouth of the speaker. Only the most skillful and accurate writers should 
resort to this method, for if errors are made and the letter has to be re-written, it will 
prove to be a losing arrangement instead of a profitable one. When adopted, unless letter- 
press copies are made, a duplicate co])y should be made by the use of carbon paper. (See 
page 30.) Many court reporters employ rapid typewritists to transcribe their testimony 
while they read their notes to them. It is important, therefore, to practice on the machine 
from dictation. 
2. Interlining, to supply an omitted word or clause, is often admissible, to save time 
in re-writing. The caret sign will have to be made with pen or pencil; then the roller 
turned back half a turn, or, if the sheet has been taken out, re-insert it, so that the words 
to be supplied will print just above the place where they were omitted. (See illustration 
on opposite page.) 
3. Capital Lines.—To print a line or more in capitals, on the National machine, 
depress the key for caps, and set the latch alongside it, to hold it down, so that all the 
fingers of both hands may be used as in writing lower case ; when a comma, or any other 
mark except the period, is to be used, the latch must be released. If the number of words 
in a display line are few, the appearance may be improved by striking the space-bar 
between each letter. (See page opposite.) 
4. Centering Lines.—All head lines, whether in capitals or small letters, should be 
placed exactly in the middle. To make»sure of doing this, count the number of letters, 
spaces, and points (if any), and subtract the total from the whole number of figures on the 
space-bar, 70 ; take half the remainder as the number on which you are to begin writing 
the line. Thus : total number of letters, etc., 45 ; 70 less 45 leaves 25 ; the half of 25 is 
about 13, on which to begin writing. This will leave 12 spaces at the other end of the 
line. 
5. N. B. Nota bene" {mark well.)—An extreme method of calling the reader’s 
attention to an important point is sometimes resorted to thus ; After a letter is written 
select some vacant space on a i:)age, and set the sheet in the machine so that you can ])rint 
the matter in an oblique position, as shown on the opposite page. Sometimes it will be 
necessary to fold the sheet slightly in order to get it in where wanted. 
6. Bens and Pencils.—Whenever practicable pen and ink should be used, for ease, 
speed and legibility. Fountain pens, in our long experience, have never been found to 
give uniform satisfaction, while any short-nibbed gold pen does. The double-elastic steel 
pens are excellent, for those who cannot afford the gold. In addition one should always 
have an excellent quality of No. 2 pencil, well sharpened, ready for any emergency. 
7. Note-Books.—A note-book that one can carry in his or her pocket is more con¬ 
venient than a broader and thicker one ; it should be of such paper that it will take either 
pen or pencil readily, viz.: thick enough to receive ink on both sides without blotting, and 
without the highly polished surface that repels both ink and pencil. Double-ruled ])aper 
assists in recognizing three or four positions in writing. To find in a moment the place in 
your book where you wish to take notes, keep a rubber band around the portion used.

Specialties in Letter Writing 
8. Note-Paper.—The typewritist will sometimes have occasion to print fashionable 
notes for, or to, ladies, such as society notices, invitations, etc., in which cases note-])aper 
of such varying widths as fancy dictates, will ‘be furnished, and the carriage must be set so 
as to print only the length of line required. Lay a sheet of the paper against the left-hand 
portion of the numbered scale, with as much projecting beyond that end of the scale as 
will give sufficient margin ; next move the carriage until the pointer rests on 25 or 30, 
according to the margin required on that side ; then slide the “ stop-collar,” or bumper, 
down the back bar until it reaches the yoke of the carriage, where' you will screw it tight 
to the bar. This will leave the remainder of the scale on which to do your writing. 
Insert note paper, or envelope, at extreme left of the roller. (See sample on page 
opposite.) 
9. Envelopes may be addressed on the typewriter, by adjusting the movement of the 
carriage in the same way, if many are to be addressed at a time ; if only a few, this is not 
necessary. Either way, however, the “envelope guide,” which is also used to hold the 
sheet of paper to the feed-roller, should be set by turning it on the rod to which it is 
fastened, so that the lit'.le roller on the lower projection lies close to the feed-roller. When 
the envelopes are all addressed it should be set back. Each package of envelopes should 
be first curved, by pressure with the fingers, so that they will lie close to the roller. 
10. Press Copies.—To obtain a single duplicate copy of a letter, a “copying ribbon,” 
of any desired color, must be used instead of the ordinary “ record ribbon.” The process 
of making such a copy, in a letter-book for preservation, will be explained by employers ; 
but the typewritist, where a letter-press is used, must see that the machine is supplied with 
the right kind of ribbon. To ascertain what kind of a ribbon is on a typewriter, print a 
word with it, then wet the end of your finger on your tongue and press it upon the word, 
and if it is a copying ribbon the word will appear upon your finger. In a position where a 
portion of the writing only, needs to go through the copying press, it is best to keep both a 
record and a copying ribbon on the machine, one on one spool and the other on the other, 
so as to use either as occasion may require. 
11. ^'‘Manifold Copies” are produced in various ways. The most simple method of 
obtaining from two to ten copies is by means of “ semi-carbon paper,” which will be found 
explained elsewhere, under the heading “ Law-office Work.” When from 50 to ico copies 
or more are desired, to be used as circulars, the Hektograph, Cyclostyle, or Mimn.eograph, 
will have to be employed. As full descriptions of how to use them accompany each 
apparatus, it is not necessary to repeat them here. 
12. A Lithograph Ribbon on a typewriter enables one, by its use on transfer paper, to 
have the contents of a letter or document of any kind, with the addition of autographic 
longhand signature, or other matter, if desired, transferred to stone, and as many copies 
printed as are wanted. 
13. Minor Corrections, such as bringing up “ dropped letters,” changing the termina¬ 
tions “ er ” to “or,” or vice versa, c to o. n to m, or the reverse, n to h, i to 1, etc., raise the 
carriage and move it, while raised, forward or back, until the automatic pointer rests over 
the letter to be changed, then drop the carriage and touch the right letter.

LAW OFFICE WORK. 
Perhaps more students of shorthand and typewriting find their first employment in 
law offices than in any other line of service. And next to doing the letter-writing of an 
office comes the copying of legal papers, and the taking in shorthand notes, from dictation 
by the attorney, such legal matters as he wishes to use in the courts, which are also to be 
typed on the machine. Forms of such papers and documents will now be presented for 
the student’s study and practice after a careful reading of the following suggestions : 
1. Accuracy.—Greater accuracy is required in all legal writings than in any other class 
of shorthand and typewriting work, for the reason that the mishearing or wrong transcrip¬ 
tion of a single word may lead to a conclusion just the opposite of that intended, and 
result in untold trouble and cost. Therefore the greatest care must be exercised in the 
start, and all the time, in copying the forms here given. 
2. Corrections.—If a mistake of a few letters, or a word or two even, is made with the 
typewriter, it may be corrected thus : If done on very thin paper the letters better be 
canceled by printing an x lightly over each one, and then go on with the correct letters, or 
if necessary they may be interlined ; if done on thick paper, the letters may be erased by 
scraping, latterly on the roller, lightly but frequently, with a sharp blade, or with an “ink 
eraser.’’ But an employer who is accurate himself, and a man of taste, will require sheets 
having even one or two unskillful corrections, to be re written. 
3. Read by Copy.—All legal, or other important work, should be “read by copy,’’ to 
see that no omissions are made, and for such additional punctuation as is necessary to the 
proper meaning of the language used. It is safer to have some one besides the typevvritist 
hold and read the copy, so that the latter may revise his or her work as the reading 
progresses. 
4. Writing from a Reader.—The words in the following forms are numbered into 
hundreds, with the view of requiring the pupil, after he has written each one two or three 
times for accuracy in spelling and the correct fingering of the keys, to repeat them several 
times for speed, with some one to read the copy, 'bhe reader should be required to call 
the punctuation marks as they occur, since the typist, while learning at least, is not able to 
carry the sense along with his fingers; also, any special capitalizing, parentheses, under¬ 
scoring, etc. 
5. Manifolding.—The learner should have the privilege, and should exercise it, of 
doing considerable manifold writing before leaving his school of instruction, or engaging to 
do work. And, in beginning the following page, is a good time to call for one or two sheets 
of semi-carbon paper, with which to make copies of the forms there given. First, lay upon 
your table one sheet of white paper ; upon it lay one sheet of semi-carbon paper, with the 
'carbon side uppermost ; next lay down another white sheet on top of the carbon paper ; 
‘then another carbon and another white sheet. Lift them all up together, and jostle them 
perfectly straight with each other ; carefully insert them between the rollers, with the 
carbon side of the sheets toward you, so as to print against the blank sides of the carbon. 
To obtain distinct impressions from the carbon paper, strike the keys a little harder than 
usual. For over three copies quite thin pa[)er is necessary.

score, and parentheses ; the second requires only the underscore, the period, and the sloping sign for fractions.

TRANSCRIBING LEGAL TESTIMONY. 
1. Pape}- io be Used.—The advent of the Typewriter has changed the style of paper 
as well as the arrangement of the matter, in writing out reports of testimony. “ Legal 
cap ” used to mean sheets double the length of an ordinary cap page, ruled for the pen, and 
also ruled vertically, outside of which ruling were always written the Q. and A. for 
Question and Answer. This latter ruling, and placing of the initials, is still required in 
some courts, and by some attorneys no matter where they are. 
2. Si))iple Form for U}i}-uled Paper.—On the opposite page is the simplest, and now 
most generally used, form observed by typewriter copyists. The paper is entirely unruled, 
and therefore the lines may be written as long as the machine will print; but in order to 
secure a fair margin, the machine better be set so as to print only 65 letters. The page 
looks cleaner by not puncturing periods after the initials Q. and A., but making two 
spaces instead of one. 
3. A Forfn with Alarginal Ruling is.given on page 44, The bumper that regulates 
the length of the line must be set so that the fiist letter, Q or A, will print just outside the 
vertical line ; then space five or more spaces, and begin the reading matter. When there 
is more than one line to a question or answer, the second and any additional lines must 
begin just inside the vertical line, and this will require the exercise of memory ; it is 
therefore an objectionable form, as one is apt to forget and make a mis-print. 
4. NiDtibcred Lines.—On page 43 is given a form in which the paper is prepared with 
figures outside the vertical line, so that each line of testimony may be referred to by 
counsel, in argument or otherwise. It requires considerable care in printing ; happily its 
use is confined to the higher courts and more critical class of lawyers. 
5. Right Side Doion.—When sheets are taken from the machine they should be 
invariably laid with the written side down, so that when picked up to be examined, or 
bound together, they will come in consecutive order, from the first to the later pages. 
6. The Na}>ies of Witnesses., when first introduced, should be printed in capitals, so 
the eye may readily observe them. 
7. Objectio}is made by Coimsel on either side, or rulings by the Court, and exceptions 
taken, should be indented ten spaces from the margin. 
8. Niwibering the Pages.—All the sheets necessary to contain the testimony in a case 
should be numbered consecutively from the beginning to the end, even if the trial 
continues for days and weeks ; but each day’s testimony should be fastened together in a 
separate packet, beginning with the date and name of witness. 
9. Train the Meniory.—It is important that the learner begin early in his or her 
practice to carry in the mind as much of a sentence as possible, so that when the reporter 
reads to the copyist he may keep on writing, without having to stop and ask a repetition of 
what has been read. 
Ma)iifaiding is done as described on page 30. Black carbon paper should be used, 
in preference to purple ; as, also, black ribbon.

Q. What is your name ? 
19 
A. Thomas B. Warren. 
20 
Q. Where do you live ? 
21 
A. New York City—1224 Tenth street. 
22 
Q. Mr. Warren, it is in testimony that you received between $11,000 and $12,000 
23 
for your interest on your share of the profits of the sale of these bonds of the com- 
24 
pany. State whether or not you received back the $5,000 that you paid Mr. Lacy ? 
25 
A. Why, I think I did. 
26 
Q. Yes, sir. Who paid you that? 
27 
A. Why, I think that Stimson did. I do not remember distinctly, but it occurs 
28 
to me that was the first thing paid. 
29 
Q. Was that a payment by Stimson personally, or by Stimson for the company ? 
30 
A. Stimson paid it to me- 
31 
Mr. Monroe : If you know, of course all this is incompetent. 
32 
Mr. McFarland : Yes, yes ; you say so. 
33 
A. I do not know, but I suppose he- 
34 
Mr. Monroe ; Well, we object to that on the ground that it is incompetent 
35 
and immaterial. 
36 
The Court : The objection is sustained. 
37 
38 
Mr, McFarland : To which we except.

CROSS EXAMINATION. 
40 
By Mr. Monroe— 
41 
Q. Was any of this land divided among the stockholders, Mr. Warren—this 
42 
Nadeau Vineyard land ? 
43 
A. Why, the company made some arrangement for stockholders to buy land and 
44 
apply part or all of the payment for their land on their stock, I think in the nature 
45 
of an advance dividend. That was a matter that Stimson carried out, and I never— 
46 
I never knew altogether about it. 
47 
Q. Were you one of the directors of the company, and are you still a director ? 
48 
A. Yes, sir. 
49 
Q. Were you present when this matter of selling land to the stockholders as an 
50 
advance dividend was discussed ? 
51 
A. Why, I was present at one meeting when it was discussed, but I think it was 
52 
discussed at more than one meeting. I am not sure that I was there at all times 
53 
when it was discussed, or when the final action was taken. I know Stimson pro- 
54 
posed it at one time when I was present. ' 
55 
Q. What was that arrangement, as you recollect it ? 
56 
A. Well, I must confess that I did not fully understand it then, and- 
57 
Q. Did you consent to it ? 
58 
A. Why, I think so. I don’t think I voted against it if it was put to a vote.

Charles H. Bragg and Edw. Bragg ) 
vs. ) 
The Victor Marble Company. ) 
Before Judge Johnson and a Jury. 
Albany, N. Y., April 5, 1890. 
Appearances. 
For Plaintiff, - - - - - Wm. M. Evarts, Esq. 
For Defendant,.A. H. Bradford, Esq. 
JOHN FOSTER, called on behalf of plaintiff, being duly sworn, testified as 
follows : 
Direct Examination by Mr. Evarts. 
Where do you reside, Mr. Foster ? 
This city. 
What is your business ? 
Financial broker. 
Did you have any connection with the corporation, the principal office of which 
was here in this city, known as the Victor Marble Company ? 
I did. 
What was the character of that connection ? 
I was a Director and Treasurer of the corporation. 
About what time did you become connected with that corporation ? 
I do not remember ; I think it must have been in the vicinity of a year ago. 
In what way did your connection with it become severed ? 
Sold my stock and resigned as a Director and Treasurer. 
Sold your stock to whom ? 
I guess it was two different parties purchased it. 
Who were they ? 
Mr. Charles H. Bragg and Mr. Edward Bragg. 
When was the first time, Mr. Foster, you had any conversation with either of 
these men about the purchase of this stock ? 
On Saturday evening, 23d January, at my place of business. 
What occurred there? What was the nature of the conversation ? 
The conversation was opened by Mr, Bragg inquiring about the Victor Marble 
Company ; how things were progressing. We talked about the general business, 
what a good piece of property it was, and what money could be made out of it if 
properly handled, with sufficient coin back of it. The winding up of it was, he 
asked me what I would take for my stock. I did not give him any price. 
Cross-Examination. 
By Mr. Bradford— 
Did you not, on Sunday, ten days prior to the sale of your stock, say to Mr. 
Charles Bragg, and to Mr. C J. Richards, that Capt Seamans had told you, in a 
conversation between you, that he had only 400 shares of this stock ? 
I did not. 
Did you not, in the conversation with the Braggs, say that you did not care to 
sell your stock, and refused to price it ? And did you not afterwards say to Mr. J. 
Richards that you took this course—that is, not putting a price on it—at the time 
and place referred to, in order to lead the Braggs on to buy, or words to that effect ? 
It’s a damned lie. 
The Court: Just answer the question, without— 
Mr. Evarts: Well, it is a “ damned lie.” 
The Witness: I am surprised that you should ask such questions of me. But, 
Judge, excuse me. 
The Court: You can always answer even such questions without an oath.

that the memorizing and delivering of it to a small country congregation was a more diffi¬ 
cult job, to me, than the first reporting I did of another man’s sermon.’ This may account 
for the fact that I never delivered a second sermon of my own, preferring to report other 
neople’s sermons, speeches, and the like, which I was then learning to do. 
It was in the year 1848, when standing at my case setting type in the office of the 
“ Star in the West,” Cincinnati, that Bro. Gurley left his editorial desk in the same room, 
and stepping up to me, said : 
“Bro. Longley, I want you to report the Occasional Sermon of Bro. Whittemore, that 
he is to deliver to-morrow in the United States Convention.” 
“ I can’t,” was my prompt reply ; though I was delighted with the idea that I would 
like to try it. 
“ But you must,” he said ; “ Bro. Whittemore has just told me that he never writes his 
sermons, and it would never do to have it said that Cincinnati could not report and publish 
so important a sermon as his will be. Come, I’ll give you ten dollars to do the best, you 
can, and you cannot make that much in a day setting type.” 
“ That’s so,” I readily admitted, “ and I’ll try what I can do. What I do not report 
he can supply.” 
Hastily finishing my “ take ” of copy, I took off my apron, and slipped away to my 
little bedroom in the garret, where “ chicken tracks ” flew around in a lively way until 
supper-time, and from supper-time until late bed-time. I timed my writing, but could not 
reach 100 words a minute. I wrote from sermons ; studied religious phrases peculiar to 
the denomination ; I tried different kinds of paper, and different pencils ; hoping by some 
means, or all combined, to be equal to the task. 
Finally I dared to sleep, and dreamed of running a race ; but who was my competitor 
I knew not, until arriving at the goal, “ neck-and-neck,” I saw him in what at first a])peared 
the judge’s stand, but which suddenly assumed the shape of a pulpit, with myself at a table 
in front. And then I knew the contestants were the preacher and the reporter. I awoke, 
and took courage for my first struggle with the winged words of the orator. 
Suffice it to say, that such as I did not “ catch on the wing ” I was enabled to remember 
or supply by my familiarity with the sentiments of the preacher—not to say anything of 
my capacity for producing a sermon, on paper, myself. And it may be worth while to 
remark, for the benefit of young phonographers, it is often important that the reporter be 
as well versed in matters and things as the persons he reports.

TYPEWRITER OPERATOR’S ERASING SHIELD 
(FOR USE WITH ALL WRITING MACHINES). 
This is a new article, just patented October 23, 1888, and now placed prominently on the market for the first time. It 
is an article which is bound to become very popular with operators of every writing machine, as it can be used with one 
machine as readily and as usefully 
as with another. The inventor of 
this shield is a lady typewriter 
operator of New York City, who 
has for years conducted her own 
office and who invented this shield 
to meet the demand for such an 
article in her own work. Its great 
use will be at once appreciated by 
every operator in the land, as with 
it a single letter, a word or a 
whole sentence may be quickly 
erased from a written page, with¬ 
out in the slightest interfering 
with other matter. The shield is 
made in handsome workmanship 
and is finished in the very best 
manner. It is made of burnished 
nickel, with “slots” of different 
sizes and shapes, each of which is 
finely beveled to prevent cutting 
the typewriter rubber. 
Operators of any machine can¬ 
not afford to get along without one, as their use insures neat work, which should be every operator’s aim and pride. 
A Shield will be sent by mail, postage paid, on receipt of Twenty Cents. 
It is one of the most useful, as well as one of the most handsome, ornaments possible to procure for any -desk or 
typewriter.

SUGGESTIONS IN 
PUNCTUATION AND CAPITALISATION. 
Here is a book, costing only 25 cents, which can be read and studied with profit by 
the majority of stenographers and operators all over the country. It is the best and most 
thoroughly practical of any work bearing upon this subject which has been placed upon 
the market ; a perfect insight is given the reader in the correct manner of punctuating, 
when to use capitals, etc., and the thousand and one points with which a good letter-writer 
should be thoroughly conversant. Eveiy amanuensis in the land should have one. The 
want of a simple book of this character has long been felt, and the present work has already 
had a flattering reception. Written concisely, without resort to obscure language, it may 
at once be comprehended by any one who has ordinary knowledge of composition. 
Especially should the subjects treated of be studied by whoever writes for publication, 
since printers, to whom the responsibility is usually left, are frequently unable to decide 
intelligently, and have no access to the author for information. Amanuenses will find it 
an invaluable aid in properly filling their positions. Typewriting makes all errors more 
noticeable, and every effort should be put forth to have a clear understanding of the 
matter no less than to have correct spelling. Uo not fail to send for a copy ; it will be 
worth to you a thousand times the price you pay for it.

BLANK DICTIONARY S 
(Bop Shopfel^ai^d Students ar^d ^eaohopg of all SYStems). 
Every shorthand student has felt the necessity of compiling a list of “ hard words,” words of 
frequent occurrence and of long, difficult outline if written phonetically, and for which 
special forms were provided. To have these words at the fingers’ ends is the first secret to 
“-peed,” and yet to place them in such shape as to be easily studied and quickly referred to has 
been found impossible. The teacher also in imparting these special forms was obliged to write each 
again and again, and to be constantly recurring to the same outline, as no list of them is published 
in the different systems. In this way, it has been a never-ending task to learn the list made use of 
in the reporting styles of all systems. 
Our “ Blank Dictionary Sheets” provide an easy and inexpensive means of placing such a 
list in just the shape desired. The list contains upward of 3,000 of the most difficult words for 
which special forms are provided in all systems, with the place for outline left in blank to be filled 
in by the teacher at once, or by the student cojued in bulk from the Dictionary or Phrase-Book, as 
the case may be, of the system studied. The list is arranged alphabetically for reference, and 
printed on fine white writing paper, with dotted lines opposite eacli word for the indicating of 
“ position,” if such be employed. Complete set of eleven large sheets sent by mail, postpaid, on 
receipt of Twenty-five Cents. Do not fail to order a set; they will save you a great deal of hard 
study, time and trouble. Owned and controlled by us.
