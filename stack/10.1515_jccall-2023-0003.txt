Abstract: This paper is an expanded version of a keynote presentation for the
2022 ChinaCALL Conference on the theme of “emerging technologies”. Today’s
emerging technologies—artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, conversational
robots, virtual worlds, virtual reality, augmented reality, automated assessment, and
so on—are full of promise and seem poised to revolutionize language teaching and
learning over the next decade. However, rather than looking forward, I review
lessons I have learned over a four-decade career in CALL, focusing on those lessons
that have continuing relevance for accommodating these and future technologies as
they emerge. In the ﬁrst part, I present a simple model for technology-mediated
language learning as a foundation for the remaining discussion. In the second, I
review seven challenges that I worked on in CALL, starting in the 1980s. I describe
how I came to be aware of the issues involved and how through a combination
of reviewing research, collaborating with colleagues, and drawing on my own
experience, I came to learn lessons of enduring value. The ﬁnal part brieﬂy explores
the potential for converting these and other lessons learned into principles to guide
current and future encounters with technologies for language teaching and learning.

1 Introduction
The goal of my keynote presentation from the ChinaCALL 2022 conference was to
highlight a number of insights colleagues and I have had that continue to be relevant,
despite the dramatic evolution of technology. Teachers today face all the challenges
we have had for decades—and more. Researchers and practitioners continue to
develop new methods, techniques, and theories to support language teaching.

Teaching and learning contexts can be changed dramatically by forces external to
education itself, as the COVID-19 crisis has shown us. And of course, we have digital
technologies, technologies that have to be integrated now in one form or another in
almost every teaching and learning setting. Because technologies constantly change,
teachers have to constantly change, or they and their students will be left behind. The
key, I believe, is to build those changes incrementally on knowledge and experience
from interactions with prior technologies. Crucially, though, it is not the knowledge
and experience alone that lead to success, but rather the critical thinking that
accompanies their application to an emerging application or new environment.
To be true to the keynote presentation, I am writing from a personal perspective,
telling the stories of lessons I have learned over four decades in CALL. As with the
keynote itself, this will mean that there is an unusually heavy focus on my own work
compared to a typical journal paper. This is because it is in essence a retrospective
piece, but one where, as it looks back in time, supports the goal of providing a
resource for work in the future.
In the next section below, I introduce a model for technology-mediated language
learning. Its purpose is to capture the notion that interaction of any kind through
technology is inﬂuenced by that technology. For language learning, what is inﬂu-
enced is both the acquisition of conscious or unconscious knowledge of language
forms and functions and the operationalization of the conscious or automatic pro-
cesses for using that knowledge. In the following section, I review seven of the more
enduring lessons that my career in CALL has taught me. In the ﬁnal section, I
translate some of these lessons into principles, short and memorable statements that
can guide teachers, researchers, and developers in their quest to use technology
eﬀectively, and especially to deal with emerging technologies as they appear. I
believe that as the language teaching world continues to grow more and more
complex and demanding, teachers will ﬁnd that having their own set of principles to
draw from will lead to a more fulﬁlling and less stressful career, allowing them to
react conﬁdently to the changes they will inevitably face.
2 Technology mediation model
Figure 1 presents an updated version of the technology mediation model that my
colleague Mike Levy and I ﬁrst proposed in a paper for Computer Assisted Language
Learning (Levy & Hubbard, 2005). That piece, “Why Call CALL ‘CALL’”, argued for
continuing to use computer-assisted language learning, or CALL, as the name of our
ﬁeld during a time when other acronyms were being promoted. Consequently, the
circle in the center contained the “computer”. In this revised version, I replace
“computer” in the original with the term “technology mediation system” to represent
2
Hubbard

an expansion of the concept (Hubbard, 2022). The technology mediation system
includes the device – the computer in the form of a desktop, laptop, tablet, or
smartphone – that is transmitting and receiving the information. It also includes the
network, whether that network is wired, Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, or 5G, as well as the software,
the programming underlying everything from the World Wide Web to individual
applications.
Essentially what Figure 1 says, going from left to right, is that we have a learner
interacting with a variety of co-participants. These include classmates, the teacher,
others outside of the class (peers, native speakers of the language, and so on), and
content, content of all sorts, from applications like Duolingo designed speciﬁcally to
support language learning (what Levy (1997) calls tutorial CALL) to authentic online
texts or videos in the target language. And importantly, this is happening in the
pursuit of language learning proﬁciency. This model is therefore not just for inter-
acting in a language through technology, but for doing it with a conscious eﬀort
toward learning.
Let me oﬀer an example. Consider a learner at an intermediate level. The
learning goal, which could be set either by the learner or by the teacher, is to improve
listening skill and to build vocabulary. The interaction in this case is going to be with
content, for example, online target language video recordings. I am going to make
this particular example independent of interactions with any others, including the
teacher. So, if we go back to Figure 1, the learner interacts with the video content
through the technology mediation system. And what is that technology mediation
Figure 1: Technology-mediated language learning model (Hubbard, 2022).

system? Well, it can be quite diﬀerent for diﬀerent settings, but here we will assume
that it is a laptop computer that is connected to the Internet through Wi-Fi. There is a
web application as part of this that has a media player, and that media player has all
the normal controls like a slider, a volume control, a pause/play button, and so on. In
addition, it supports ﬁrst language and second language captions, a link to tran-
scripts, and a speed control, allowing the video to be slowed down for easier
processing.
So how does the technology mediation system in this case potentially impact
language learning? For instance, what happens if the learner turns on the target
language captions? What happens if the learner turns on ﬁrst language captions?
What happens if the video is slowed down to 75% of normal speed? How does each of
these interventions aﬀect not only comprehension but ultimately language learning?
Is it improving target language processing or getting in the way? We cannot yet fully
understand how this mediation is aﬀecting learning, but if we use a model like that in
Figure 1 to guide our thinking about what is happening in this hypothetical listening
activity, it will help us take steps toward understanding the degree to which a given
technology may be supporting or undermining learning goals.
In the example I gave, the primary application was the media player embedded
in a web page. In addition, there is a web browser that allows the learner to ﬁnd and
bring up the desired video. A copy of that video, somewhere in the cloud has been
archived and indexed so that it can be found. And if this is going through Wi-Fi, there
are variables in terms of bandwidth from the local router and the number of devices
sharing that bandwidth. These elements and more are parts of the technology
mediation system. Again, assuming the goal here is language learning, not just
language use, all these elements can impact the ways in which the learner engages in
the interaction and what of value they gain from that interaction. At this fairly high
level of abstraction, I claim that this simple model is applicable across technologies,
ranging from email to virtual reality. Similarly, it is compatible with a range of
theories, certainly with cognitive theories of language learning and likely also with
socio-cultural perspectives. Further, it is useful across all skills: the nature of the
technology mediation will change depending on the skill, but whether it is reading,
writing, listening, speaking, or interaction, the mediation is still going to exert an
inﬂuence.
Beyond the technology mediation system itself, its impact is a function of the
interactants (learner, teacher, peers, others, and content), the interactions, the
activity or task, and the environments in which these all occur, all of which must
ultimately be considered. Finally, it is worth noting that the technology does not
automatically improve learning in this model – that is, it is not just a technology
enhancement model. There are ways that the technology mediation system can
4
Hubbard

actually slow or get in the way of learning, even block learning, depending on how
the technology’s options are employed.
Let me give one brief personal example unrelated to language learning to
support the previous point. I have a son who lives about an hour away, and when I
went to visit him for the ﬁrst time, I put his address into my smartphone’s map
application. I followed the directions and got to his house right on time, just as
expected. And then I did that again, and again the next time I visited him, and again
the time after that. At some point I realized that I had probably visited him a dozen
times, but if I turned that map application oﬀ, I was not sure where to make some of
the turns. I would probably have gotten lost. In contrast, in the twentieth century, I
would have mapped it out once or maybe twice on paper, and remembered where I
went.
So this is an example where the presence of the technology mediation system
blocked rather than accelerated my navigational learning. A GPS map system is a
kind of augmented reality. We have the road unfolding in front of us on a screen in
real time, and it is telling us where we should make our turns, what the traﬃc is like,
and so on. It is a fantastic technology to support the task of getting us to where we
want to be, but it does not help us learn how to get there – unless we consciously use
the information it provides for that purpose.
In one way or another, the goal of language learning is to connect target
language forms to meaning in a way that can be recalled and reproduced as needed
by the learner/user in a real-life situation. In my map example, I had no reliable
memory of the connection to the actual road in front of me, or of what the signals
were telling me in terms of where I was and where I might turn to get to my son’s
house. I was fully reliant on the technology and followed directions blindly.
This is important. How does a particular instance of technology mediate access,
motivation, engagement, focus, and social interaction? These are key considerations
in the language learning endeavor. And placing these in a teaching situation, the
inﬂuence of the mediation depends on what the objective of a particular lesson is and
on how aware of that objective and committed to it the learner is.
To summarize, Figure 1 captures the insight that teachers, researchers, and
developers need to go beyond surface aﬀordances and do what they can to take into
account the potential impact of the elements of the technology mediation system on
the learners as they engage in interactions. This is not a simple task, but I believe that
time devoted to this endeavor will rarely be wasted.

3 Some lessons I learned
Having introduced the technology mediation framework as a foundation, in this
section I describe a series of “lessons learned” over the past few decades. There is
precedent for this in our ﬁeld, going back at least to a paper by Davies (1997) con-
taining seven lessons on how the future of CALL could be informed by its past. I
originally titled this section “some lessons learned”, but in fact, they are really
lessons that I learned through a combination of reading relevant research, engaging
in teaching with technology, and critically reﬂecting on what was working, what was
not, and why. By sharing these lessons, I hope both to inform others and to move
them to take into account the experiences they are having using technology for
language teaching and what insights they can personally draw from those to inﬂu-
ence future endeavors in this realm. The biggest mistake any of us can make is to
“teach innocently” (Brookﬁeld, 1995), assuming that the technology will automati-
cally work as we expect it to with our students. In the remainder of this section, I
review seven experiences from my career in CALL that led me ﬁrst to insights and
then on to generalizations, frameworks, and models that came to shape subsequent
teaching and professional activities.
3.1 Evaluation: 1986–1988
Let me start with evaluation. Late in 1982, I took my ﬁrst steps toward becoming a
“teacher programmer”, coding my ﬁrst set of computer exercises for students in
my ESL reading class at Ohio University. There was limited software available for
language learning, and what existed was often both expensive and methodologically
primitive. So my early work in CALL centered on coming up with ideas for software,
programming it myself on Apple II computers, using it with my students, and
then presenting what I thought were my successes at regional and national TESOL
conferences. As a part of being a software developer, I became aware of how I was
looking critically at other people’s software and of how other people were looking at
mine. At that time, the frameworks to support such evaluation were typically
checklists that were either heavily biased toward one method at the expense of
others or, even more commonly, were just technology focused without considering
language learning elements.
I joined a professional organization in the early 1980s called CALICO (Computer-
Assisted Language Instruction Consortium). The organization’s CALICO Journal
published reviews of commercial CALL software. Their review checklist at the time
only had the word language used once in it, and that was for what language the
6
Hubbard

software was in: French, English, German, etc. That checklist was clearly focused on
the technology itself rather than on how it might support language learning. In my
ﬁrst CALICO Conference talk in 1986, I questioned the value of that checklist and
proposed a supplemental framework based on the language teaching approach the
software seemed to embody. My work was heavily inﬂuenced by a framework for
describing and comparing methods that had been developed by Richards and
Rodgers (1982). Following their lead, rather than prescribing what the language
teaching approach should be, I tried to be more agnostic and provide for a variety
of approaches at that time – behaviorist, explicit learning, communicative, and
strategy based. I produced a set of checklists showing the characteristics of each as
they related to the software under review, published in Hubbard (1987). In the
following year, I built on the core concept of embodying language teaching approach
considerations in evaluation and created a more comprehensive “methodological
framework” that appeared in Hubbard (1988). This framework synthesized the
Richards and Rodgers (1982) framework with one from Phillips (1985) for CALL and
expanded on that synthesis. Using this new framework, an evaluator began by
producing an operational description of the software to ensure an understanding of
how the software worked before attempting to judge it. With that description in
mind, the evaluator would then check for teacher ﬁt – how well the software
reﬂected a language teaching approach compatible with that of the teacher. It
would also check for learner ﬁt – how well the software’s content and operation
were compatible with the students’ level, learning objectives, interests, and
motivations. In later work, I expanded the evaluation framework to include devel-
opment and implementation using much of the same machinery to integrate the
three components (Hubbard, 1996).
Importantly, the methodological framework involved open-ended questions
rather than being a checklist, although one could generate a checklist from it for a
given teacher ﬁt and learner ﬁt. In the years following its publication, the framework
became the foundation for the reviewing template used by the CALICO Journal, and
the teacher ﬁt and learner ﬁt components remain in the journal’s review framework
at the time of this writing (see the CALICO Journal learning technology review
guidelines at https://journal.equinoxpub.com/Calico/libraryFiles/downloadPublic/
481). The framework has withstood the test of time because it did not prescrip-
tively reference any particular technology, theory, or teaching method, all of which
have changed signiﬁcantly in the past 35 years.

3.2 Computer games for language learning: 1991
Games and the related concept of gamiﬁcation for language learning have become a
signiﬁcant part of our ﬁeld in the last decade (Flores, 2015), but some of us were
already experimenting with it in the mid-1980s. Some created games dedicated to
language learning. For example, I designed, programmed, and piloted with my
students a reading game to teach skimming and scanning strategies. Others looked to
oﬀ-the-shelf computer games to be used for language learning purposes, especially
those in public domain (Stevens, 1985). We recognized then as now that we want
students to be engaged in their learning activities and that games could help achieve
that goal. However, despite the desire to use software with games or game-like
qualities to support learning, when I was looking at computer programs that were
being presented as language learning games, I observed that many seemed to have
one or both of the following problems:
(1)
Although they used language, it was not clear that they were helping students
learn it;
(2)
Although some promoted language learning, it was unclear that learners
considered them games – that is, they lacked the fun and engagement factor
and seemed to be just an embellished form of drills or quizzes.
Now importantly, this was just an observation – I was not in a position to do research
on the topic at that time. However, I was inspired by the work of Baltra (1984, 1990)
among others on using adventure games collaboratively, with two or more English
language learners sharing a single computer screen and discussing actions and
strategies in English as well as inputting English into the game itself. Thus, I was
convinced that it was possible to employ computer games eﬀectively if their design
and use were examined critically.
I was given the opportunity to share my observations in a short (3.5 page) article
(Hubbard, 1991). There, besides noting observations (1) and (2) above, I suggested
criteria for evaluating game-oriented software for its capacity to support language
learning as well as for its ability to motivate and engage learners so that they would
accept it and enjoy it as a game. That article was not cited much for years until
interest in digital games for language learning returned. According to Google
Scholar, one-fourth of the citations for this 1991 paper have come in the past four
years. Perhaps interested colleagues rediscovered it because it still had these two
main points. If we are going to be creating or using games for language learning,
make sure ﬁrst that they actually promote language learning and that our students
are likely to accept them as games that they want to engage in.

3.3 Meaning technologies: 2001
Throughout the 1990s, alongside my teaching and administrative duties, I worked
as a developer creating software for my own students and with a Silicon Valley
company making EFL CD-ROMs. At the turn of the century, I began to shift my
interest away from design and programming toward integrating web-based content
and technologies, in particular those that supported comprehension as a necessary
initial step to language learning. At that time, I was regularly teaching one and
sometimes two classes each quarter focused on listening comprehension. Stanford,
my home university, is on a quarter system: we have three 10-week terms a year,
plus an optional summer, so I was getting a lot of opportunities to try out relevant
technology in listening classes. Students were already using English captions, native-
language captions, and electronic dictionaries to aid their listening comprehension,
what Cárdenas-Claros and Gruba (2009) categorize as “help options”. I knew these
could be used to help, and I encouraged their use sometimes, but it also seemed that
they could impede learning. Students could simply take shortcuts to ﬁnish a task, but
also innocently use them thinking that they would help learning. As Vandergrift later
observed, “Captions, annotations, and computer programs to slow down speech may
be useful for developing word recognition skills and learning vocabulary; however,
their value in teaching students how to listen is questionable. Given that written
support is usually not available in authentic, real-time listening, students need to
learn to rely only on the acoustic signal and relevant contextual factors to develop
listening strategies” (Vandergrift, 2004, p. 9). So, for example, if learners always rely
on captions to support comprehension, then they may not develop their listening
skill adequately, just as I did not improve my navigation skill when using a GPS.
Machine translation was becoming a particular concern at the turn of the
century. Among other options, a web-based program called Babelﬁsh had become
particularly popular (Davies, 1997), and while it was crude by today’s standards, it
looked like it could be easily misused. Indeed, some scholars suggested it might lead
to dramatic changes in language teaching and learning.
As a teacher, I saw the need to try and strike a balance between the extremes of
banning or restricting these meaning technologies or letting them be used freely.
In Hubbard (2001), I introduced these concerns and suggested techniques for a
classroom teacher to model ways to reinforce the form-meaning relationships so that
these technologies became tools for comprehension in the service of language
acquisition. For example, I noted that captions could be used during the ﬁrst part of a
video segment to establish a foundation for comprehension and then turned oﬀfor a
more authentic listening experience (see Markham and Peter (2003), for research
supporting this technique).

The recent release of the AI program ChatGPT is once again bringing us serious
concerns about technology negatively impacting learning. In this case, we are
dealing with a production technology, one that could, for example, write an exam
essay for a student directly in English (Susnjak, 2022). ChatGPT’s translation abilities
are also being explored, including by a group at Tencent AI Labs (Jiao et al., 2023). At
the time of this writing, it remains to be seen how this will impact teaching and
learning, but it is clear that teachers will need to become keenly aware of the growing
capabilities of this sort of application and ﬁnd ways to work with students to use it to
support rather than subvert language learning.
3.4 Learner training: 2004
The concept of learner training is not new to language teaching, but its speciﬁc
application to CALL was not well established in the early decades of the ﬁeld. In the
1990s, I knew about learning strategy training, for example, because it was already
an established area in second language reading and to a lesser extent in listening.
However, there was little in the way of literature on it in CALL.
It was a particular class experience that raised my awareness of the need for
learner training in technology use. In the mid-1990s, I had developed some listening
software for the Macintosh computer, and I assigned it regularly to my students
for homework. The main activity type was a picture identiﬁcation exercise where
students would see three somewhat similar but diﬀerent graphics, listen to a
description, and then click on the graphic that ﬁt what was said (or “none of these” as
a fourth option). They worked on these exercises independently each week in the
language lab, and I gave them short forms to ﬁll out about how useful they found
it, how easy or diﬃcult it was, how long they used it, and what their score was
(Hubbard, 1995). My goal was to have them listen carefully to each prompt multiple
times, trying to understand as much as possible before answering. I anticipated that
this would improve their processing of connected speech and would take about
30 min. However, on reading their reports and talking with them in biweekly indi-
vidual meetings, I discovered that several reported completing the 10–12 item
assignment in just 5 min because they listened to the items once, answered the
prompt, and sometimes even got one hundred percent right.
The students and I discussed this disconnect between my expectations and theirs
in class and in the individual meetings. After explaining the objective of the activity, I
demonstrated how to make the items more challenging by ﬁrst hiding the graphics
until after they had heard the prompt. I also showed them how they could use the
material for dictation after they had gotten the correct answer. That was the start of
learner training for my listening classes, leading the students beyond just operating
10
Hubbard

the software and on to understanding how it could best help them to improve their
processing, including how they could adapt the level of challenge to their individual
proﬁciency levels.
In addition to my instruction and modeling, I gave students class time to talk to
each other in small groups about how they were using this and other software
independently. Eventually, I formalized what I was doing into a framework for
learner training based on ﬁve principles (Hubbard, 2004). Up to that point, the
majority of learner training I had read about in CALL was focused on technical
areas – how to use a particular piece of software, what all the controls did, and so on.
Beyond this technical training, the primary point of my framework was to recognize
that the students needed pedagogical training because they were taking on part of
the role of the teacher when working by themselves. They not only needed to know
how to operate the software but also when to use certain control options and why.
This extended well beyond the software I had developed and eventually became the
central part of an advanced listening course I taught, where students would do
weekly independent listening projects using audio and video materials they found on
the web (for the class notes from 2020, see https://web.stanford.edu/∼efs/693b/). I
revisited the topic in Hubbard (2013), which was aimed at making the case for why
learner training should become a core element of CALL research and practice.
3.5 Principles of mobile assisted language learning (MALL):
2013
By 2012, mobile language learning had been growing for quite some time (Burston,
2013). With the advent and rapid spread of the smartphone, a “computer” much more
powerful than the typical laptop or desktop of a decade before, mobile learning had
become signiﬁcantly more popular. In 2013 I was invited to write a paper by the
International Research Foundation (TIRF) on a topic related to MALL. At that time, I
had not done a lot of work with MALL because my students typically continued to use
laptop computers for most of their academic work. However, I did have the sense that
MALL was being overhyped—too much attention was being given to the potential of
the technology compared to its demonstrated value for language learning. In addi-
tion, conference presentations and published papers describing MALL uses often
(though not universally) focused on its positive features and ignored any challenges.
Although I was not ready to write a paper in this area on my own, I had a colleague,
Glenn Stockwell, who had done a lot of good work in MALL and who had been given
the same invitation independently. Like me, he was not eager to write a paper on his
own, so we decided to collaborate.

11

We communicated through email and regular meetings on Skype. A key point
that emerged from our discussions was that input for designing and implementing
MALL tasks ideally involved drawing on research from three areas: MALL itself,
CALL, and mobile learning in areas other than language. We produced a paper that
proposed and defended 10 emerging principles for MALL, each supported by
research from one of the three contributing ﬁelds (Stockwell & Hubbard, 2013).
Let me give three examples. One principle was to limit multitasking and
environmental distractions. It is often convenient for learners to use a mobile device
for language practice while doing something else or in a noisy environment, but the
resulting learning can be degraded. Another principle was to be aware of the
learners’ “cultures of use” (Thorne, 2003, p. 38). Thorne’s work came from CALL, but
it is clearly relevant for any technology implementation, including MALL. He
discussed what happened when French and American students were put together
in a virtual exchange and told to use email to communicate with their overseas
partners. In one case, the two ended up using a synchronous chat program instead of
email, because at the time, that was their culture of use for social interaction. As a
result, they ended up spending much more time communicating than other student
pairs who interacted through email. The ﬁnal example principle was to provide
students with relevant learner training, guidance on how to use the mobile device,
application, and environment eﬀectively both to complete the task and to support
language learning objectives.
3.6 Teaching reﬂectively with technology: 2013–2017
Reﬂective teaching has always been important for language classrooms, especially in
the early stages of a teacher’s career (Richards & Lockhart, 1994). However, based on
what I witnessed at conferences and even noticed in published work, reﬂection in
using technology for language teaching is often not in evidence. There is a tendency
to observe and report on only the positive aspects of technology use.
In 2013, I decided to explore this issue along with a colleague of mine from
Cyprus, Sophie Ioannou-Georgiou. She and I had worked together on the team
developing the TESOL Technology Standards Framework (TESOL, 2008) and a few
years later were part of an exchange between IATEFL and TESOL. In this exchange,
funded by the British Council, a member from the TESOL CALL interest section was
sponsored to attend the IATEFL Conference in the UK, and a member from the
Learning Technologies special interest group of IATEFL was sent to the TESOL
conference in the US. As part of the exchange, we embarked on a collaborative
project between the two groups in the form of a book. Having recently witnessed
12
Hubbard

numerous CALL-oriented conference talks where applications of technologies were
presented uncritically (sometimes even without actually using the applications
with students), we decided to push the idea of teaching reﬂectively with technology
as the central theme for the book.
As teachers and teacher trainers, we both knew that whenever we brought in a
new technology, it worked better for some students, less well for others, and maybe
not at all for some. We felt that when teachers reported only positive results, without
addressing the challenges they had faced, that this was a disservice to the teachers in
the audience. We were also concerned that teachers reporting on their technology
use seemed unaware of others who had gone before them.
We sent out a call for papers to the two groups we were representing and
speciﬁed that we were not interested in a typical research paper; rather, contributors
had to demonstrate reﬂective teaching practice as follows:
(1)
Represent practical uses of recent and emerging technologies or innovative
applications of more established ones.
(2)
Include an explicit rationale for incorporating the technology tied to language
learning goals and objectives, supported with references.
(3)
Incorporate thoughtful reﬂections based on observation and/or collected data
regarding what worked, what did not, and why, connected where possible to
relevant literature (a minimum of ﬁve references was required).
In our introductory chapter, we motivate the need for reﬂective teaching with
technology as follows.
One way of understanding the notion of teaching reﬂectively is by looking at
what it isn’t. Brookﬁeld (1995) famously contrasts it with teaching innocently.
Teaching innocently occurs when the teachers assume that they understand what
they are doing and the eﬀect it is having on their students. Teaching innocently, they
do not challenge the assumptions underlying their teaching actions… The failure to
teach reﬂectively, then, is not necessarily based on laziness or time limitations or
even arrogance. Rather, we would argue, it is a case of not knowing what we don’t
know and then letting the exploration stop there (Hubbard & Ioannou-Georgiou,
2017, pp. 12–13).
We collected 21 case studies divided almost equally between the two organiza-
tions. We succeeded in getting the authors collectively to demonstrate a range of
ways for teaching reﬂectively with technology in a variety of ESL and EFL contexts. In
doing so, we hope to have provided a model for others to follow. The book was

Emerging technologies: mining the past

3.7 Drawing on the past: 2018–2019
I started moving more formally in the direction of drawing on the past to help inform
the future in a 2018 GLoCALL/ChinaCALL keynote presentation in Suzhou, “Five keys
from the past to the future of CALL”, published the following year in Hubbard (2019).
These represented points I had made in various publications over the years and in
the CALL courses I had taught, but this was the ﬁrst time I had organized them in this
manner. Reviewing these ﬁve keys was an important step for me in generating the
ideas for the current paper.
(1)
When a new technology appears and is considered for CALL, there is a tendency
to greatly overestimate its impact and to be dazzled by its apparent potential.
Gartner, a company that provides executives with relevant insights for their
businesses, refers to this tendency as the “hype” part of their hype cycle (Linden
& Fenn, 2003). Within CALL, Murray and Barnes (1998) called it the “wow
factor”. During this early period of adoption, a lot of time and eﬀort is often
spent on speculation, attitudinal research (e.g., do students like it?), and rushed
development before the aﬀordances and constraints are suﬃciently under-
stood. A key lesson from this is to approach new technologies critically rather
than with blind enthusiasm and to be guided by the often-repeated adage that it
is not the technology alone that is important, but rather how it is used. “Using
technology in delivering a lesson or instructional unit will not make bad
pedagogy good” (Golonka et al., 2014).
(2)
As depicted in Figure 1 and discussed in above, the mediational properties and
impact of technology need to be understood as they relate to language learning
potential.
(3)
Good research is important for CALL, but it must be interpreted carefully, not
just simply adopted—or dismissed—uncritically. Those working in CALL need
to understand not only the importance of research results, but also their lim-
itations. Many studies involve either the opinions of teachers or the opinions of
students at a particular point in time, which may not be particularly useful ﬁve
or ten years later. There are other studies that may maintain their relevance for
decades. For example, I suspect Thorne’s (2003) generalization on the impor-
tance of understanding learners’ “cultures of use” for technologies in language
learning tasks is as relevant today as it was when published, even though the
technologies have changed.
(4)
Fifteen years ago, I published a paper in the CALICO Journal on the future of
language teacher education (Hubbard, 2008). In it, I noted that teacher candi-
dates we were working with at that time needed to be prepared for a profes-
sional career of 40 years or more, one involving constant technological change.

Thus, teachers need to be trained not just on how to use current technology.
They also need to know how to think about technology, approach it critically,
and expand their operational and pedagogical skills with it through a program
of lifelong professional development.
(5)
Learners similarly need training. It is a mistake to assume that just because
they are comfortable with technology for social interaction that they can
eﬀectively utilize it in pursuit of their language learning objectives.
4 Guiding principles for technology mediated
language teaching and learning
In this last section, I discuss how we can use insights gathered from the past to
develop principles for integrating both established and emerging technologies into
language teaching. Like teaching reﬂectively, letting principles guide one’s teaching
is not a new idea (Richards, 1996). Teachers may have background in theory and
research and certainly in methodology. However, according to Richards, they
develop personal principles, or maxims, that inform their approach to teaching.
These principles—brief, memorable generalizations informed by theory, research,
practice, and experience—guide teachers’ instructional decisions and actions.
Principles can be broad or narrow, and importantly, they are useful not just for
teachers, but also for developers and researchers.
Here are some examples of broad principles that can be drawn from the pre-
ceding sections.
(1)
Consider the mediational properties of the technology you want to use and how
they relate to the learning goals (See Figure 1).
(2)
Be sure to understand how an application or technology-based task works
before judging its value. When you do judge it, consider it from the perspective
of how it ﬁts both you and your students.
(3)
Avoid hype—be especially skeptical of unsupported claims about emerging
technologies.
(4)
Seek out relevant research and practice literature but read it critically.
(5)
Teach reﬂectively with technology. Plan thoughtfully, monitor what is
happening with your students while they are using technology, and especially
reﬂect afterwards. Encourage your students to do the same to improve their use
of that technology for future learning.
(6)
Take time and make the eﬀort to train your students to use technology more
eﬀectively for language learning.
Emerging technologies: mining the past
15

These broad principles can be followed by more actionable narrow principles.
Taking the last one, learner training, in Hubbard (2004) I proposed ﬁve pedagogically
oriented principles based on theory, research, and reﬂective teaching that guided
what I did with students
(1)
Experience CALL yourself: Experiment with a technology or task from the
learner’s perspective before assigning it.
(2)
Give learners some teacher training. Provide them with the relevant knowl-
edge and skills necessary to work eﬀectively on their own.
(3)
Use a cyclical approach. Make training in eﬀective technology use ongoing, not
just based on a single training session.
(4)
Use collaborative debrieﬁngs. Get learners to discuss their successes and fail-
ures with the technology in pairs or small groups.
(5)
Teach general exploitation strategies. Show learners ways to make materials
and tasks easier if they are too hard and harder if they are too easy. Have them
focus on the connection between their actions and improving language
proﬁciency.
I conclude this section by discussing a recent paper (Canals & Mor, 2023) showing
what some others are doing with this concept of principles. The goal of their paper,
which is about technology-enhanced task-based language teaching (TETBLT), is to
produce a singular pedagogy, that is a set of principles that will guide exemplary
teaching. In this study, the authors relied on a panel of 22 experts to produce an initial
16 TETBLT principles. They were then modiﬁed, based on a second round, because
while all of them were relevant, some were overly challenging to implement, and
(not surprisingly) there were some cases where the experts disagreed with one
another. The team ultimately decided on a set of eight principles that they thought
were useful and practical. One example straight from TBLT Itself is “learn by doing”.
Another principle references input characteristics, how it is important to have “a
variety of rich and authentic inputs enabled and ampliﬁed by technology” (Canals &
Mor, 2023, p. 12). Beyond providing a useful set of principles for TETBLT, their paper
has value in the methodology employed in deriving principles through the discussion
and interpretation of contributions from an expert panel.
5 Conclusion
I began here with a simple model of technology-mediated language learning. I then
oﬀered examples of lessons I learned during my 40 years in CALL that have guided
my English teaching and teacher education work. Due to space limitations, there are
some other signiﬁcant areas I did not touch on that inﬂuenced my views and

implementation of CALL concepts. These include lessons I learned from the
following:
–
co-editing the ﬁrst book devoted to teacher education in CALL (Hubbard & Levy,
2006), leading to a broader and deeper understanding of what others were doing
in this domain;
–
serving on the writing team for the TESOL Technology Standards Framework
(TESOL, 2008), collaborating with colleagues to set targets for English language
teachers in foundational and expert knowledge and skill in CALL;
–
editing Computer-Assisted Language Learning: Critical Concepts in Linguistics
(Hubbard, 2009), drawing on the wisdom and experience of 19 colleagues to
generate a four-volume anthology of 74 inﬂuential papers from the history of
CALL: https://web.stanford.edu/∼efs/callcc/;
–
developing a framework for theory types in CALL (Hubbard & Levy, 2016),
recognizing in particular the value of theory adaptation and coherent combi-
nations of theories—theory ensembles—to accommodate the intersection of
SLA, technology, and other disciplines.
Finally, I showed how such lessons can be the basis for guiding principles for inte-
grating technology in language teaching. I gave examples of principles that have
helped me and showed how others are working to develop principles relevant to
technology-mediated teaching.
In our rapidly changing world, the prospect of keeping up with technological and
related pedagogical progress can easily be overwhelming. I have demonstrated here
that it is possible to mine the past for lessons to help with the uncertainties of emerging
technologies. I used examples from my own professional journey, but other such
lessons are readily available in the CALL literature. Additionally, I have suggested that
we can derive useful principles from lessons learned through integrating knowledge
and experience in technology-mediated language learning to provide guidance for
navigating the future. Over time these principles should be critically examined,
revised, and added to as more knowledge and experience is gained.
