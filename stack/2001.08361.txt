Abstract
We study empirical scaling laws for language model performance on the cross-entropy loss.
The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute
used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other
architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide
range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overﬁtting on model/dataset size and the
dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the
optimal allocation of a ﬁxed compute budget. Larger models are signiﬁcantly more sample-
efﬁcient, such that optimally compute-efﬁcient training involves training very large models
on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping signiﬁcantly before convergence.

Introduction
Language provides a natural domain for the study of artiﬁcial intelligence, as the vast majority of reason-
ing tasks can be efﬁciently expressed and evaluated in language, and the world’s text provides a wealth of
data for unsupervised learning via generative modeling. Deep learning has recently seen rapid progress in lan-
guage modeling, with state of the art models [RNSS18, DCLT18, YDY+19, LOG+19, RSR+19] approaching
human-level performance on many speciﬁc tasks [WPN+19], including the composition of coherent multi-
paragraph prompted text samples [RWC+19].
One might expect language modeling performance to depend on model architecture, the size of neural models,
the computing power used to train them, and the data available for this training process. In this work we will
empirically investigate the dependence of language modeling loss on all of these factors, focusing on the
Transformer architecture [VSP+17, LSP+18]. The high ceiling and low ﬂoor for performance on language
tasks allows us to study trends over more than seven orders of magnitude in scale.
Throughout we will observe precise power-law scalings for performance as a function of training time, con-
text length, dataset size, model size, and compute budget.
1.1
Summary
Our key ﬁndings for Transformer language models are are as follows:
2Here we display predicted compute when using a sufﬁciently small batch size. See Figure 13 for comparison to the
purely empirical data.

Language modeling performance improves smoothly as we increase the model size, datasetset
size, and amount of compute2 used for training. For optimal performance all three factors must be scaled
up in tandem. Empirical performance has a power-law relationship with each individual factor when not
bottlenecked by the other two.
Performance depends strongly on scale, weakly on model shape:
Model performance depends most
strongly on scale, which consists of three factors: the number of model parameters N (excluding embed-
dings), the size of the dataset D, and the amount of compute C used for training. Within reasonable limits,
performance depends very weakly on other architectural hyperparameters such as depth vs. width. (Section
3)
Smooth power laws:
Performance has a power-law relationship with each of the three scale factors
N, D, C when not bottlenecked by the other two, with trends spanning more than six orders of magnitude
(see Figure 1). We observe no signs of deviation from these trends on the upper end, though performance
must ﬂatten out eventually before reaching zero loss. (Section 3)
Universality of overﬁtting:
Performance improves predictably as long as we scale up N and D in tandem,
but enters a regime of diminishing returns if either N or D is held ﬁxed while the other increases. The
performance penalty depends predictably on the ratio N 0.74/D, meaning that every time we increase the
model size 8x, we only need to increase the data by roughly 5x to avoid a penalty. (Section 4)
Universality of training:
Training curves follow predictable power-laws whose parameters are roughly
independent of the model size. By extrapolating the early part of a training curve, we can roughly predict the
loss that would be achieved if we trained for much longer. (Section 5)
Transfer improves with test performance:
When we evaluate models on text with a different distribution
than they were trained on, the results are strongly correlated to those on the training validation set with
a roughly constant offset in the loss – in other words, transfer to a different distribution incurs a constant
penalty but otherwise improves roughly in line with performance on the training set. (Section 3.2.2)
Sample efﬁciency:
Large models are more sample-efﬁcient than small models, reaching the same level of
performance with fewer optimization steps (Figure 2) and using fewer data points (Figure 4).
Convergence is inefﬁcient:
When working within a ﬁxed compute budget C but without any other restric-
tions on the model size N or available data D, we attain optimal performance by training very large models
and stopping signiﬁcantly short of convergence (see Figure 3). Maximally compute-efﬁcient training would
therefore be far more sample efﬁcient than one might expect based on training small models to convergence,
with data requirements growing very slowly as D ∼C0.27 with training compute. (Section 6)
Optimal batch size:
The ideal batch size for training these models is roughly a power of the loss only,
and continues to be determinable by measuring the gradient noise scale [MKAT18]; it is roughly 1-2 million
tokens at convergence for the largest models we can train. (Section 5.1)
Taken together, these results show that language modeling performance improves smoothly and predictably
as we appropriately scale up model size, data, and compute. We expect that larger language models will
perform better and be more sample efﬁcient than current models.

As more compute becomes available, we can choose how much to allocate towards training larger
models, using larger batches, and training for more steps. We illustrate this for a billion-fold increase in
compute. For optimally compute-efﬁcient training, most of the increase should go towards increased model
size. A relatively small increase in data is needed to avoid reuse. Of the increase in data, most can be used to
increase parallelism through larger batch sizes, with only a very small increase in serial training time required.
1.2
Summary of Scaling Laws
The test loss of a Transformer trained to autoregressively model language can be predicted using a power-law
when performance is limited by only either the number of non-embedding parameters N, the dataset size D,
or the optimally allocated compute budget Cmin (see Figure 1):
1. For models with a limited number of parameters, trained to convergence on sufﬁciently large
datasets:
L(N) = (Nc/N)αN ; αN ∼0.076,
Nc ∼8.8 × 1013 (non-embedding parameters)
(1.1)
2. For large models trained with a limited dataset with early stopping:
L(D) = (Dc/D)αD ; αD ∼0.095,
Dc ∼5.4 × 1013 (tokens)
(1.2)
3. When training with a limited amount of compute, a sufﬁciently large dataset, an optimally-sized
model, and a sufﬁciently small batch size (making optimal3 use of compute):

3We also observe an empirical power-law trend with the training compute C (Figure 1) while training at ﬁxed batch
size, but it is the trend with Cmin that should be used to make predictions. They are related by equation (5.5).

Figure 4
Left: The early-stopped test loss L(N, D) varies predictably with the dataset size D and model
size N according to Equation (1.5). Right: After an initial transient period, learning curves for all model
sizes N can be ﬁt with Equation (1.6), which is parameterized in terms of Smin, the number of steps when
training at large batch size (details in Section 5.1).
These relations hold across eight orders of magnitude in Cmin, six orders of magnitude in N, and over two
orders of magnitude in D. They depend very weakly on model shape and other Transformer hyperparameters
(depth, width, number of self-attention heads), with speciﬁc numerical values associated with the Webtext2
training set [RWC+19]. The power laws αN, αD, αmin
C
specify the degree of performance improvement
expected as we scale up N, D, or Cmin; for example, doubling the number of parameters yields a loss that
is smaller by a factor 2−αN = 0.95. The precise numerical values of Nc, Cmin
c
, and Dc depend on the
vocabulary size and tokenization and hence do not have a fundamental meaning.
The critical batch size, which determines the speed/efﬁciency tradeoff for data parallelism ([MKAT18]), also
roughly obeys a power law in L:
Bcrit (L) =
B∗
L1/αB ,
B∗∼2 · 108 tokens, αB ∼0.21
(1.4)
Equation (1.1) and (1.2) together suggest that as we increase the model size, we should increase the dataset
size sublinearly according to D ∝N
αN
αD ∼N 0.74. In fact, we ﬁnd that there is a single equation combining
(1.1) and (1.2) that governs the simultaneous dependence on N and D and governs the degree of overﬁtting:
L(N, D) =
"Nc
N
 αN
αD + Dc
D
#αD
(1.5)
with ﬁts pictured on the left in ﬁgure 4. We conjecture that this functional form may also parameterize the
trained log-likelihood for other generative modeling tasks.
When training a given model for a ﬁnite number of parameter update steps S in the inﬁnite data limit, after
an initial transient period, the learning curves can be accurately ﬁt by (see the right of ﬁgure 4)
L(N, S) =

(1.6)
where Sc ≈2.1 × 103 and αS ≈0.76, and Smin(S) is the minimum possible number of optimization steps
(parameter updates) estimated using Equation (5.4).
When training within a ﬁxed compute budget C, but with no other constraints, Equation (1.6) leads to the
prediction that the optimal model size N, optimal batch size B, optimal number of steps S, and dataset size
D should grow as
N ∝Cαmin

(1.8)
which closely matches the empirically optimal results N ∝C0.73
min , B ∝C0.24
min , and S ∝C0.03
min . As the
computational budget C increases, it should be spent primarily on larger models, without dramatic increases
in training time or dataset size (see Figure 3). This also implies that as models grow larger, they become
increasingly sample efﬁcient. In practice, researchers typically train smaller models for longer than would
5

be maximally compute-efﬁcient because of hardware constraints. Optimal performance depends on total
compute as a power law (see Equation (1.3)).
We provide some basic theoretical motivation for Equation (1.5), an analysis of learning curve ﬁts and their
implications for training time, and a breakdown of our results per token. We also make some brief compar-
isons to LSTMs and recurrent Transformers [DGV+18].
1.3
Notation
We use the following notation:
• L – the cross entropy loss in nats. Typically it will be averaged over the tokens in a context, but in
some cases we report the loss for speciﬁc tokens within the context.
• N – the number of model parameters, excluding all vocabulary and positional embeddings
• C ≈6NBS – an estimate of the total non-embedding training compute, where B is the batch size,
and S is the number of training steps (ie parameter updates). We quote numerical values in PF-days,
where one PF-day = 1015 × 24 × 3600 = 8.64 × 1019 ﬂoating point operations.
• D – the dataset size in tokens
• Bcrit – the critical batch size [MKAT18], deﬁned and discussed in Section 5.1. Training at the
critical batch size provides a roughly optimal compromise between time and compute efﬁciency.
• Cmin – an estimate of the minimum amount of non-embedding compute to reach a given value of
the loss. This is the training compute that would be used if the model were trained at a batch size
much less than the critical batch size.
• Smin – an estimate of the minimal number of training steps needed to reach a given value of the loss.
This is also the number of training steps that would be used if the model were trained at a batch size
much greater than the critical batch size.
• αX – power-law exponents for the scaling of the loss as L(X) ∝1/XαX where X can be any of
N, D, C, S, B, Cmin.

Background and Methods
We train language models on WebText2, an extended version of the WebText [RWC+19] dataset, tokenized
using byte-pair encoding [SHB15] with a vocabulary size nvocab = 50257. We optimize the autoregres-
sive log-likelihood (i.e. cross-entropy loss) averaged over a 1024-token context, which is also our principal
performance metric. We record the loss on the WebText2 test distribution and on a selection of other text
distributions. We primarily train decoder-only [LSP+18, RNSS18] Transformer [VSP+17] models, though
we also train LSTM models and Universal Transformers [DGV+18] for comparison.
2.1
Parameter and Compute Scaling of Transformers
We parameterize the Transformer architecture using hyperparameters nlayer (number of layers), dmodel (di-
mension of the residual stream), dﬀ(dimension of the intermediate feed-forward layer), dattn (dimension of
the attention output), and nheads (number of attention heads per layer). We include nctx tokens in the input
context, with nctx = 1024 except where otherwise noted.
We use N to denote the model size, which we deﬁne as the number of non-embedding parameters
N ≈2dmodelnlayer (2dattn + dﬀ)
= 12nlayerd2
model
with the standard
dattn = dﬀ/4 = dmodel
(2.1)
where we have excluded biases and other sub-leading terms. Our models also have nvocabdmodel parameters
in an embedding matrix, and use nctxdmodel parameters for positional embeddings, but we do not include
these when discussing the ‘model size’ N; we will see that this produces signiﬁcantly cleaner scaling laws.
Evaluating a forward pass of the Transformer involves roughly
Cforward ≈2N + 2nlayernctxdmodel
(2.2)
add-multiply operations, where the factor of two comes from the multiply-accumulate operation used in
matrix multiplication. A more detailed per-operation parameter and compute count is included in Table 1.

Parameter counts and compute (forward pass) estimates for a Transformer model. Sub-leading
terms such as nonlinearities, biases, and layer normalization are omitted.
For contexts and models with dmodel > nctx/12, the context-dependent computational cost per token is a
relatively small fraction of the total compute. Since we primarily study models where dmodel ≫nctx/12,
we do not include context-dependent terms in our training compute estimate. Accounting for the backwards
pass (approximately twice the compute as the forwards pass), we then deﬁne the estimated non-embedding
compute as C ≈6N ﬂoating point operators per training token.
2.2
Training Procedures
Unless otherwise noted, we train models with the Adam optimizer [KB14] for a ﬁxed 2.5 × 105 steps with
a batch size of 512 sequences of 1024 tokens. Due to memory constraints, our largest models (more than
1B parameters) were trained with Adafactor [SS18]. We experimented with a variety of learning rates and
schedules, as discussed in Appendix D.6. We found that results at convergence were largely independent of
learning rate schedule. Unless otherwise noted, all training runs included in our data used a learning rate
schedule with a 3000 step linear warmup followed by a cosine decay to zero.
2.3
Datasets
We train our models on an extended version of the WebText dataset described in [RWC+19]. The original
WebText dataset was a web scrape of outbound links from Reddit through December 2017 which received at
least 3 karma. In the second version, WebText2, we added outbound Reddit links from the period of January
to October 2018, also with a minimum of 3 karma. The karma threshold served as a heuristic for whether
people found the link interesting or useful. The text of the new links was extracted with the Newspaper3k
python library. In total, the dataset consists of 20.3M documents containing 96 GB of text and 1.62 × 1010
words (as deﬁned by wc). We then apply the reversible tokenizer described in [RWC+19], which yields
2.29 × 1010 tokens. We reserve 6.6 × 108 of these tokens for use as a test set, and we also test on similarly-
prepared samples of Books Corpus [ZKZ+15], Common Crawl [Fou], English Wikipedia, and a collection
of publicly-available Internet Books.

Empirical Results and Basic Power Laws
To characterize language model scaling we train a wide variety of models, varying a number of factors
including:
• Model size (ranging in size from 768 to 1.5 billion non-embedding parameters)
• Dataset size (ranging from 22 million to 23 billion tokens)
• Shape (including depth, width, attention heads, and feed-forward dimension)
• Context length (1024 for most runs, though we also experiment with shorter contexts)
• Batch size (219 for most runs, but we also vary it to measure the critical batch size)

Performance depends very mildly on model shape when the total number of non-embedding
parameters N is held ﬁxed. The loss varies only a few percent over a wide range of shapes. Small differences
in parameter counts are compensated for by using the ﬁt to L(N) as a baseline. Aspect ratio in particular can
vary by a factor of 40 while only slightly impacting performance; an (nlayer, dmodel) = (6, 4288) reaches a
loss within 3% of the (48, 1600) model used in [RWC+19].

Left: When we include embedding parameters, performance appears to depend strongly on the
number of layers in addition to the number of parameters. Right: When we exclude embedding parameters,
the performance of models with different depths converge to a single trend. Only models with fewer than 2
layers or with extreme depth-to-width ratios deviate signiﬁcantly from the trend.
In this section we will display data along with empirically-motivated ﬁts, deferring theoretical analysis to
later sections.
3.1
Approximate Transformer Shape and Hyperparameter Independence
Transformer performance depends very weakly on the shape parameters nlayer, nheads, and dﬀwhen we hold
the total non-embedding parameter count N ﬁxed. To establish these results we trained models with ﬁxed
size while varying a single hyperparameter. This was simplest for the case of nheads. When varying nlayer,
we simultaneously varied dmodel while keeping N ≈12nlayerd2
model ﬁxed. Similarly, to vary dﬀat ﬁxed
model size we also simultaneously varied the dmodel parameter, as required by the parameter counts in Table
1. Independence of nlayers would follow if deeper Transformers effectively behave as ensembles of shallower
models, as has been suggested for ResNets [VWB16]. The results are shown in Figure 5.
3.2
Performance with Non-Embedding Parameter Count N
In Figure 6 we display the performance of a wide variety of models, ranging from small models with shape
(nlayer, dmodel) = (2, 128) through billion-parameter models, ranging in shape from (6, 4288) through
(207, 768). Here we have trained to near convergence on the full WebText2 dataset and observe no over-
ﬁtting (except possibly for the very largest models).
As shown in Figure 1, we ﬁnd a steady trend with non-embedding parameter count N, which can be ﬁt to the
ﬁrst term of Equation (1.5), so that

To observe these trends it is crucial to study performance as a function of N; if we instead use the total
parameter count (including the embedding parameters) the trend is somewhat obscured (see Figure 6). This
suggests that the embedding matrix can be made smaller without impacting performance, as has been seen in
recent work [LCG+19].
Although these models have been trained on the WebText2 dataset, their test loss on a variety of other datasets
is also a power-law in N with nearly identical power, as shown in Figure 8.
3.2.1
Comparing to LSTMs and Universal Transformers
In Figure 7 we compare LSTM and Transformer performance as a function of non-embedding parameter
count N. The LSTMs were trained with the same dataset and context length. We see from these ﬁgures
that the LSTMs perform as well as Transformers for tokens appearing early in the context, but cannot match
the Transformer performance for later tokens. We present power-law relationships between performance and
context position Appendix D.5, where increasingly large powers for larger models suggest improved ability
to quickly recognize patterns.
We also compare the performance of standard Transformers to recurrent Transformers [DGV+18] in Figure
17 in the appendix. These models re-use parameters, and so perform slightly better as a function of N, at the
cost of additional compute per-parameter.
3.2.2
Generalization Among Data Distributions
We have also tested our models on a set of additional text data distributions. The test loss on these datasets
as a function of model size is shown in Figure 8; in all cases the models were trained only on the WebText2
dataset. We see that the loss on these other data distributions improves smoothly with model size, in direct
parallel with the improvement on WebText2. We ﬁnd that generalization depends almost exclusively on the
in-distribution validation loss, and does not depend on the duration of training or proximity to convergence.
We also observe no dependence on model depth (see Appendix D.8).
3.3
Performance with Dataset Size and Compute
We display empirical trends for the test loss as a function of dataset size D (in tokens) and training compute
C in Figure 1.
For the trend with D we trained a model with (nlayer, nembd) = (36, 1280) on ﬁxed subsets of the WebText2
dataset. We stopped training once the test loss ceased to decrease. We see that the resulting test losses can be
ﬁt with simple power-law

in the dataset size. The data and ﬁt appear in Figure 1.
The total amount of non-embedding compute used during training can be estimated as C = 6NBS, where
B is the batch size, S is the number of parameter updates, and the factor of 6 accounts for the forward and
backward passes. Thus for a given value of C we can scan over all models with various N to ﬁnd the model

efﬁciency improves with model size, and we also illustrate this directly in Figure 19 in the appendix.

Charting the Inﬁnite Data Limit and Overﬁtting
In Section 3 we found a number of basic scaling laws for language modeling performance. Here we will
study the performance of a model of size N trained on a dataset with D tokens while varying N and D
simultaneously. We will empirically demonstrate that the optimally trained test loss accords with the scaling
law of Equation (1.5). This provides guidance on how much data we would need to train models of increasing
size while keeping overﬁtting under control.
4.1
Proposed L(N, D) Equation
We have chosen the parameterization (1.5) (repeated here for convenience):
L(N, D) =
"Nc
N
 αN
αD + Dc
D
#αD
(4.1)
using three principles:
1. Changes in vocabulary size or tokenization are expected to rescale the loss by an overall factor. The
parameterization of L(N, D) (and all models of the loss) must naturally allow for such a rescaling.
2. Fixing D and sending N →∞, the overall loss should approach L(D). Conversely, ﬁxing N and
sending D →∞the loss must approach L(N).
3. L(N, D) should be analytic at D = ∞, so that it has a series expansion in 1/D with integer powers.
Theoretical support for this principle is signiﬁcantly weaker than for the ﬁrst two.
Our choice of L(N, D) satisﬁes the ﬁrst requirement because we can rescale Nc, Dc with changes in the
vocabulary. This also implies that the values of Nc, Dc have no fundamental meaning.

Figure 9
The early-stopped test loss L(N, D) depends predictably on the dataset size D and model size N
according to Equation (1.5). Left: For large D, performance is a straight power law in N. For a smaller ﬁxed
D, performance stops improving as N increases and the model begins to overﬁt. (The reverse is also true,
see Figure 4.) Right: The extent of overﬁtting depends predominantly on the ratio N
αN
αD /D, as predicted in
equation (4.3). The line is our ﬁt to that equation.
Since we stop training early when the test loss ceases to improve and optimize all models in the same way, we
expect that larger models should always perform better than smaller models. But with ﬁxed ﬁnite D, we also
do not expect any model to be capable of approaching the best possible loss (ie the entropy of text). Similarly,
a model with ﬁxed size will be capacity-limited. These considerations motivate our second principle. Note
that knowledge of L(N) at inﬁnite D and L(D) at inﬁnite N fully determines all the parameters in L(N, D).
The third principle is more speculative. There is a simple and general reason one might expect overﬁtting
to scale ∝1/D at very large D. Overﬁtting should be related to the variance or the signal-to-noise ratio
of the dataset [AS17], and this scales as 1/D. This expectation should hold for any smooth loss function,
since we expect to be able to expand the loss about the D →∞limit. However, this argument assumes that
1/D corrections dominate over other sources of variance, such as the ﬁnite batch size and other limits on the
efﬁcacy of optimization. Without empirical conﬁrmation, we would not be very conﬁdent of its applicability.
Our third principle explains the asymmetry between the roles of N and D in Equation (1.5). Very similar
symmetric expressions4 are possible, but they would not have a 1/D expansion with integer powers, and
would require the introduction of an additional parameter.
In any case, we will see that our equation for L(N, D) ﬁts the data well, which is the most important justiﬁ-
cation for our L(N, D) ansatz.

We regularize all our models with 10% dropout, and by tracking test loss and stopping once it is no longer
decreasing. The results are displayed in Figure 9, including a ﬁt to the four parameters αN, αD, Nc, Dc in

Fits to L(N, D)
We obtain an excellent ﬁt, with the exception of the runs where the dataset has been reduced by a factor of
1024, to about 2 × 107 tokens. With such a small dataset, an epoch consists of only 40 parameter updates.
Perhaps such a tiny dataset represents a different regime for language modeling, as overﬁtting happens very
early in training (see Figure 16). Also note that the parameters differ very slightly from those obtained in
Section 3, as here we are ﬁtting the full L(N, D) rather than just L(N, ∞) or L(∞, D).
To chart the borderlands of the inﬁnite data limit, we can directly study the extent of overﬁtting. For all but
the largest models, we see no sign of overﬁtting when training with the full 22B token WebText2 dataset,
so we can take it as representative of D = ∞. Thus we can compare ﬁnite D to the inﬁnite data limit by

The critical batch size Bcrit follows a power law in the loss as performance increase, and does
not depend directly on the model size. We ﬁnd that the critical batch size approximately doubles for every
13% decrease in loss. Bcrit is measured empirically from the data shown in Figure 18, but it is also roughly
predicted by the gradient noise scale, as in [MKAT18].

We estimate that the variation in the loss with different random seeds is roughly 0.02, which means that to
avoid overﬁtting when training to within that threshold of convergence we require
D ≳(5 × 103) N 0.74
(4.4)
With this relation, models smaller than 109 parameters can be trained with minimal overﬁtting on the 22B
token WebText2 dataset, but our largest models will encounter some mild overﬁtting. More generally, this
relation shows that dataset size may grow sub-linearly in model size while avoiding overﬁtting. Note however
that this does not typically represent maximally compute-efﬁcient training. We should also emphasize that
we have not optimized regularization (eg the dropout probability) while varying dataset and model size.

Scaling Laws with Model Size and Training Time
In this section we will demonstrate that a simple scaling law provides a good description for the loss as a
function of model size N and training time. First we will explain how to use the results of [MKAT18] to
deﬁne a universal training step Smin, which accounts for the fact that most of our models have not been
trained at an optimal batch size. Then we will demonstrate that we can ﬁt the model size and training time
dependence of the loss using Equation (1.6). Later we will use these results to predict the optimal allocation
of training compute between model size and training time, and then conﬁrm that prediction.
5.1
Adjustment for Training at Bcrit(L)
A simple empirical theory for the batch size dependence of training was developed in [MKAT18] (see also
[SLA+18, ZLN+19]). It was argued that there is a critical batch size Bcrit for training; for B up to Bcrit
the batch size can be increased with very minimal degradation in compute-efﬁciency, whereas for B > Bcrit
increases in B result in diminishing returns. It was also argued that the gradient noise scale provides a simple
12

prediction for Bcrit, and that neither depends directly on model size except through the value of the loss that
has been attained. These results can be used to predict how training time and compute will vary with the
batch size. To utilize both training time and compute as effectively as possible, it is best to train with a batch
size B ≈Bcrit. Training at B ≫Bcrit minimizes the number of training steps, while B ≪Bcrit minimizes
the use of compute.
More speciﬁcally, it was demonstrated that for a wide variety of neural network tasks, the number of training
steps S and the number of data examples processed E = BS satisfy the simple relation
 S
Smin
−1
  E
Emin
−1

= 1
(5.1)
when training to any ﬁxed value of the loss L. Here Smin is the minimum number of steps necessary to reach
L, while Emin is the minimum number of data examples that must be processed.
We demonstrate the relation (5.1) for Transformers in Figure 18 in the appendix. This relation deﬁnes the
critical batch size
Bcrit(L) ≡Emin
Smin
(5.2)
which is a function of the target value of the loss. Training at the critical batch size makes a roughly optimal
time/compute tradeoff, requiring 2Smin training steps and processing E = 2Emin data examples.
In Figure 10 we have plotted the critical batch size and gradient noise scale5 as a function of training loss for
two different models. We see that Bcrit(L) is independent of model size, and only depends on the loss L. So
the predictions of [MKAT18] continue to hold for Transformer language models. The critical batch size can
be ﬁt with a power-law in the loss
Bcrit(L) ≈
B∗
L1/αB
(5.3)
where B∗≈2 × 108 and αB ≈0.21.
We have chosen this parameterization for Bcrit(L) because as the loss approaches its minimum value Lmin,
the gradient noise scale is expected to diverge, and we expect Bcrit to track this noise scale. We do not
know Lmin, as we see no sign that our models are approaching it, but Lmin > 0 since the entropy of natural
language is non-zero. Since apparently Lmin is much smaller than the values of L we have achieved, we used
a parameterization where Bcrit diverges as L →0.
We will use Bcrit(L) to estimate the relation between the number of training steps S while training at batch
size B = 219 tokens and the number of training steps while training at B ≫Bcrit. This is simply
Smin(S) ≡
S
1 + Bcrit(L)/B
(minimum steps, at B ≫Bcrit)
(5.4)
for any given target value L for the loss. This also deﬁnes a critical value of the compute needed to train to L
with a model of size N if we were to train at B ≪Bcrit(L). This is
Cmin(C) ≡
C
1 + B/Bcrit(L)
(minimum compute, at B ≪Bcrit)
(5.5)
where C = 6NBS estimates the (non-embedding) compute used at batch size B.
5.2
Results for L(N, Smin) and Performance with Model Size and Compute
Now we will use Smin deﬁned in Equation (5.4) to obtain a simple and universal ﬁt for the dependence of the
loss on model size and training time in the inﬁnite data limit. We will ﬁt the stable, Adam-optimized training
runs using Equation (1.6), repeated here for convenience:

Bcrit from Figures 18 and 10 for all our later analyses.

When we hold either total compute or number of training steps ﬁxed, performance follows

maximizes performance. Mediocre ﬁts at small S are unsurprising, as the power-law equation for the learning
curves breaks down very early in training.

Fits to L(N, S)
With these parameters, we obtain the learning curve ﬁts in Figure 4. Though the ﬁts are imperfect, we believe
they are quite compelling given the simplicity of Equation (5.6).
The data and ﬁts can be visualized in a different and more interesting way, as shown in Figure 11. There we
study the test loss as a function of model size while ﬁxing either the total non-embedding compute C used
in training, or the number of steps S. For the ﬁts we use Equation (5.5) and (5.4) along with the parameters
above and Equation (5.6).
The power-law dependence of the loss on Smin reﬂects the interplay of optimizer dynamics and the loss
landscape. Since the ﬁts are best late in training, when the loss may be approximately quadratic, the power-
law should provide information about the spectrum of the Hessian of the loss. Its universality suggests that
the Hessian eigenvalue density is roughly independent of model size.
5.3
Lower Bound on Early Stopping Step
The results for L(N, Smin) can be used to derive a lower-bound (and rough estimate) of the step at which
early stopping should occur when training is data limited. It is motivated by the idea that ﬁnite and inﬁnite D
learning curves for a given model will be very similar until we reach Smin ≈Sstop. Thus overﬁtting should
be proportional to the correction from simply ending training at Sstop. This will underestimate Sstop, because
in reality the test loss will decrease more slowly when we have a ﬁnite D, and therefore we will require more
training steps to reach the optimal test loss at ﬁnite D. This line of reasoning leads to the inequality
Sstop(N, D) ≳
Sc
[L(N, D) −L(N, ∞)]1/αS
(5.7)
where L(N, ∞) is the converged loss, evaluated with inﬁnite available data. This inequality and its com-
parison to the empirical data is displayed in Figure 16 in the appendix. In that ﬁgure, the values of Sstop
and L(N, D) are empirical (though Sstop is adjusted to mimic training at B ≫Bcrit), while L(N, ∞) is
computed from the ﬁt to L(N, D) evaluated at D = ∞.

Optimal Allocation of the Compute Budget
We displayed the empirical trend of performance as a function of the computation used during training in
the top-right of Figure 1. However, this result involved training at a ﬁxed batch size B, whereas we know

Left: Given a ﬁxed compute budget, a particular model size is optimal, though somewhat larger
or smaller models can be trained with minimal additional compute. Right: Models larger than the compute-
efﬁcient size require fewer steps to train, allowing for potentially faster training if sufﬁcient additional paral-
lelism is possible. Note that this equation should not be trusted for very large models, as it is only valid in the
power-law region of the learning curve, after initial transient effects.

When adjusting performance to simulate training far below the critical batch size, we ﬁnd a
somewhat altered power law for L(Cmin) when compared with the fully empirical results. The conspicuous
lump at 10−5 PF-days marks the transition from 1-layer to 2-layer networks; we exclude 1-layer networks
in the power-law ﬁts. It is the L(Cmin) trend that we expect to provide a reliable extrapolation for larger
compute.
that in fact we could train more efﬁciently6 by training at the batch size Bcrit discussed in Section 5.1.
Large and small values of the loss could have been achieved with fewer samples or fewer steps, respectively,
and correcting for this inefﬁciency by standardizing to the critical batch size results in cleaner and more
predictable trends.
In this section we will adjust for this oversight. More importantly, we will use the results of Section 5
to determine the optimal allocation of compute between model size N and the quantity of data processed
during training, namely 2BcritSmin. We will determine this allocation both empirically and theoretically, by
using the equation for L(N, Smin), and we will demonstrate that these methods agree.
6.1
Optimal Performance and Allocations
Let us ﬁrst study the loss as a function of the optimally allocated compute from Equation (5.5). The result is
plotted in Figure 13, along with a power-law ﬁt. We see that as compared to the compute plot of Figure 1, the
new ﬁt with Cmin is somewhat improved.
Given L(Cmin), it is natural to ask for the optimal model size N(Cmin) that provides the minimal loss with a
given quantity of training compute. The optimal model size is shown in Figure 14. We observe that N(Cmin)
6One might ask why we did not simply train at Bcrit in the ﬁrst place. The reason is that it depends not only on the
model but also on the target value of the loss we wish to achieve, and so is a moving target.

can be ﬁt very well with a power-law
N(Cmin) ∝(Cmin)0.73.
(6.1)
In Figure 12, we show the effect of training models of sub-optimal sizes (see Appendix B.4).
By deﬁnition Cmin ≡6NBcritS, and so we can use N(Cmin) to extract further results. In particular, since
prior ﬁts show B ∝L−4.8 and L ∝C−0.05
min
, we can conclude that Bcrit ∝C0.24
min . This leads us to conclude
that the optimal number of steps will only grow very slowly with compute, as
Smin ∝(Cmin)0.03,
(6.2)
matching the empirical results in Figure 14. In fact the measured exponent is sufﬁciently small that our results
may even be consistent with an exponent of zero.
Thus we conclude that as we scale up language modeling with an optimal allocation of computation, we
should predominantly increase the model size N, while simultaneously scaling up the batch size via B ∝
Bcrit with negligible increase in the number of serial steps. Since compute-efﬁcient training uses relatively
few optimization steps, additional work on speeding up early training dynamics may be warranted.
6.2
Predictions from L(N, Smin)
The results for L(Cmin) and the allocations can be predicted from the L(N, Smin) equation obtained in
Section 5. Given our equation for L(N, Smin), we can substitute Smin = Cmin
6NB and then ﬁnd the minimum
of the loss as a function of N, while ﬁxing the training compute. We carry out this procedure in detail in
Appendix B, where we also provide some additional predictions.
For the loss as a function of training compute, we predict that
L(Cmin) =
Cmin

where

in excellent agreement with the exponent of Figure 13. We also predict that
N(Cmin) ∝(Cmin)αmin
C
/αN ≈(Cmin)0.71
(6.5)
which also matches the scaling of Figure 14 to within a few percent. Our scaling laws provide a predictive
framework for the performance of language modeling.
16

The intersection point is sensitive to 
the precise power-law parameters
Figure 15
Far beyond the model sizes we study empirically, we ﬁnd a contradiction between our equations
for L(Cmin) and L(D) due to the slow growth of data needed for compute-efﬁcient training. The intersection
marks the point before which we expect our predictions to break down. The location of this point is highly
sensitive to the precise exponents from our power-law ﬁts.
6.3
Contradictions and a Conjecture
We observe no signs of deviation from straight power-law trends at large values of compute, data, or model
size. Our trends must eventually level off, though, since natural language has non-zero entropy.
Indeed, the trends for compute-efﬁcient training described in this section already contain an apparent contra-
diction. At scales several orders of magnitude above those documented here, the performance predicted by
the L(Cmin) scaling law decreases below what should be possible given the slow growth in training data with
compute. This implies that our scaling laws must break down before this point, but we conjecture that the
intersection point has a deeper meaning: it provides an estimate of the point at which Transformer language
models reach maximal performance.
Since the amount of data used by compute-efﬁcient training grows slowly with the compute budget, the
performance predicted by L(Cmin) eventually hits a lower bound set by the L(D) power law (see Figure 15).
Let us work this out in more detail.
To keep overﬁtting under control, the results of Section 4 imply that we should scale the dataset size as
D ∝N 0.74 ∝C0.54
min
(6.6)
where we have used the compute-efﬁcient N(Cmin) from Figure 14.
Let us compare this to the data requirements of compute-efﬁcient training. If we train at the critical batch
size (i.e. C = 2Cmin) and never re-use data during training, we ﬁnd that data usage grows with compute as
D(Cmin) =
2Cmin
6N(Cmin) ≈
 4 × 1010 tokens

(Cmin/PF-Day)0.26
(6.7)
This is the maximum rate at which the dataset size can productively grow with compute, since it means that
we are only training for a single epoch. But it grows the dataset much more slowly than in Equation (6.6).
It appears to imply that compute-efﬁcient training will eventually run into a problem with overﬁtting, even if
the training process never re-uses any data!
According to Figure 1, we expect that when we are bottlenecked by the dataset size (ie by overﬁtting), the
loss should scale as L(D) ∝D−0.095. This implies that the loss would scale with compute as L(D(Cmin)) ∝
C−0.03
min
once we are data-limited. Once again, we have a contradiction, as this will eventually intersect with
our prediction for L(Cmin) from Figure 13, where we found a scaling L(Cmin) ∝C−0.050
min
.
The intersection point of L(D(Cmin)) and L(Cmin) occurs at
C∗∼104 PF-Days
N ∗∼1012 parameters,
D∗∼1012 tokens,
L∗∼1.7 nats/token
(6.8)
though the numerical values are highly uncertain, varying by an order or magnitude in either direction de-
pending on the precise values of the exponents from the power-law ﬁts. The most obvious interpretation is
that our scaling laws break down at or before we reach this point, which is still many orders of magnitude
away in both compute and model size.
17

One might also conjecture that this intersection point has a deeper meaning. If we cannot increase the model
size beyond N ∗without qualitatively different data requirements, perhaps this means that once we reach
C∗
min and N ∗, we have extracted all of the reliable information available in natural language data. In this
interpretation, L∗would provide a rough estimate for the entropy-per-token7 of natural language. In this
scenario, we would expect the loss trend to level off at or before L∗.
We can guess at the functional form of L(Cmin) as it levels off by considering a version of our training
dataset with added noise. For example, we could append a random string of tokens to each context shown
to the model to artiﬁcially boost the loss by a constant additive factor. Then, the distance from the noise
ﬂoor L −Lnoise would be a more meaningful performance metric, with even a small decrease in this distance
potentially representing a signiﬁcant boost in qualitative performance. Since the artiﬁcial noise would affect
all of our trends equally, the critical point of 6.8 would not change (aside from the absolute value of L∗), and
may be meaningful even if it occurs after the leveling off.

Related Work
Power laws can arise from a wide variety of sources [THK18]. Power-law scalings with model and dataset
size in density estimation [Was06] and in random forest models [Bia12] may be connected with our results.
These models suggest that power-law exponents may have a very rough interpretation as the inverse of the
number of relevant features in the data.
Some early [BB01, Goo01] work found power-law scalings between performance and dataset size. More
recent work [HNA+17, HAD19] also investigated scaling between model size and data size; their work is
perhaps the closest to ours in the literature8. Note, however, that [HNA+17] found super-linear scaling of
dataset size with model size, whereas we ﬁnd a sub-linear scaling. There are some parallels between our
ﬁndings on optimal allocation of compute and [Kom19], including power-law learning curves. EfﬁcientNets
[TL19] also appear to obey an approximate power-law relation between accuracy and model size. Very recent
work [RRBS19b] studies scaling with both dataset size and model size for a variety of datasets, and ﬁts an
ansatz similar to ours.
EfﬁcientNet [TL19] advocates scaling depth and width exponentially (with different coefﬁcients) for optimal
performance of image models, resulting in a power-law scaling of width as a function of depth. We ﬁnd that
for language models this power should be roughly one when scaling up (as width/depth should remain ﬁxed).
But more importantly, we ﬁnd that the precise architectural hyperparameters are unimportant compared to the
overall scale of the language model. In [VWB16] it was argued that deep models can function as ensembles
of shallower models, which could potentially explain this ﬁnding. Earlier work [ZK16] has compared width
and depth, and found that wide ResNets can outperform deep ResNets on image classiﬁcation. Some studies
ﬁx computation per data example, which tends to scale in proportion to the number of model parameters,
whereas we investigate scaling with both model size and the quantity of training computation.
Various works [AS17, BHMM18] have investigated generalization in highly overparameterized models, ﬁnd-
ing a “jamming transition” [GJS+19] when the model size reaches the dataset size (this may require training
many orders of magnitude beyond typical practice, and in particular does not use early stopping). We do
not observe such a transition, and ﬁnd that the necessary training data scales sublinearly in the model size.
Expansions in the model size, particularly at large width [JGH18, LXS+19], may provide a useful framework
for thinking about some of our scaling relations. Our results on optimization, such as the shape of learning
curves, can likely be explained using a noisy quadratic model, which can provide quite accurate predictions
[ZLN+19] in realistic settings. Making this connection quantitative will require a characterization of the
Hessian spectrum [Pap18, GKX19, GARD18].

Discussion
We have observed consistent scalings of language model log-likelihood loss with non-embedding parameter
count N, dataset size D, and optimized training computation Cmin, as encapsulated in Equations (1.5) and
(1.6). Conversely, we ﬁnd very weak dependence on many architectural and optimization hyperparameters.
Since scalings with N, D, Cmin are power-laws, there are diminishing returns with increasing scale.
7Deﬁning words using the wc utility, the WebText2 dataset has 1.4 tokens per word and 4.3 characters per token.
8After this work was completed, [RRBS19a] also appeared, which makes similar predictions for the dependence of
loss on both model and dataset size.
18

We were able to precisely model the dependence of the loss on N and D, and alternatively on N and S, when
these parameters are varied simultaneously. We used these relations to derive the compute scaling, magnitude
of overﬁtting, early stopping step, and data requirements when training large language models. So our scaling
relations go beyond mere observation to provide a predictive framework. One might interpret these relations
as analogues of the ideal gas law, which relates the macroscopic properties of a gas in a universal way,
independent of most of the details of its microscopic consituents.
It is natural to conjecture that the scaling relations will apply to other generative modeling tasks with a
maximum likelihood loss, and perhaps in other settings as well. To this purpose, it will be interesting to
test these relations on other domains, such as images, audio, and video models, and perhaps also for random
network distillation. At this point we do not know which of our results depend on the structure of natural
language data, and which are universal. It would also be exciting to ﬁnd a theoretical framework from
which the scaling relations can be derived: a ‘statistical mechanics’ underlying the ‘thermodynamics’ we
have observed. Such a theory might make it possible to derive other more precise predictions, and provide a
systematic understanding of the limitations of the scaling laws.
In the domain of natural language, it will be important to investigate whether continued improvement on the
loss translates into improvement on relevant language tasks. Smooth quantitative change can mask major
qualitative improvements: “more is different”. For example, the smooth aggregate growth of the economy
provides no indication of the speciﬁc technological developments that underwrite it. Similarly, the smooth
improvements in language model loss may hide seemingly qualitative changes in capability.
Our results strongly suggest that larger models will continue to perform better, and will also be much more
sample efﬁcient than has been previously appreciated. Big models may be more important than big data.
In this context, further investigation into model parallelism is warranted. Deep models can be trained using
pipelining [HCC+18], which splits parameters depth-wise between devices, but eventually requires increased
batch sizes as more devices are used. Wide networks on the other hand are more amenable to parallelization
[SCP+18], since large layers can be split between multiple workers with less serial dependency. Sparsity
[CGRS19, GRK17] or branching (e.g. [KSH12]) may allow for even faster training of large networks through
increased model parallelism. And using methods like [WRH17, WYL19], which grow networks as they train,
it might be possible to remain on the compute-efﬁcient frontier for an entire training run.

Empirical Model of Compute-Efﬁcient Frontier
Throughout this appendix all values of C, S, and αC are adjusted for training at the critical batch size Bcrit.
We have left off the ‘adj’ label to avoid cluttering the notation.
B.1
Deﬁning Equations
The power-law ﬁt to the learning curves implies a simple prescription for compute-efﬁcient training. In this
appendix, we will derive the optimal performance, model size, and number of training steps as a function of
20

the compute budget. We start with the Equation (1.6), repeated here for convenience:
L (N, S) =
Nc
N
αN
+
Sc
S
αS
.
(B.1)
Here, S represents the number of parameter updates when training at the critical batch size [MKAT18],
which was deﬁned in Equation (5.2)9:
B (L) =
B∗
L1/αB .
(B.2)
We would like to determine optimal training parameters for a ﬁxed compute budget, so we replace S =
C/ (6NB (L)), where C is the number of FLOPs used in the training run:
L (N, C) =
Nc
N
αN
+

6B∗Sc

L1/αBC
αS

Equation (B.3) and (B.4) together determine the compute-efﬁcient frontier.
B.2
Efﬁcient Training
Now we assemble the implications of (B.3) and (B.4). First, note that inserting (B.4) into (B.3) yields
L (Neﬀ(C) , C) =

1 + αN
αS

L (Neﬀ, ∞) ,
(B.5)
which implies that for compute-efﬁcient training, we should train to a ﬁxed percentage αN
αS ≈10% above
the converged loss. Next, let’s determine how the optimal loss depends on the compute budget. Eliminating
N yields a power-law dependence of performance on compute:
L (C) =
Cc
C
αC
(B.6)
where we deﬁned
αC = 1/ (1/αS + 1/αB + 1/αN) ≈0.052
(B.7)
Cc = 6NcB∗Sc

1 + αN
αS
1/αS+1/αN  αS
αN
1/αS
.
(B.8)
Similarly, we can eliminate L to ﬁnd N (C):
N (C)
Nc
=
 C
Cc
αC/αN 
1 + αN
αS
1/αN
(B.9)
and
S (C) =
Cc
6NcB∗

1 + αN
αS
−1/αN  C
Cc
αC/αS
(B.10)
9There is a slight ambiguity here: we can imagine training either at a constant batch size B (Ltarget), or we could
instead train at a variable batch size ˜B (L), where ˜B is the instantaneous critical batch size (as opposed to B, which is
the averaged version). These two prescriptions result in the same number of steps, so we can ignore this subtlety (see
[MKAT18]).
21

B.3
Comparison to Inefﬁcient
Typically, researchers train models until they appear to be close to convergence. In this section, we compare
the efﬁcient training procedure described above to this more typical setup. We deﬁne a the convergence factor
f as the percent deviation from the converged loss:
L (N, C) = (1 + f) L (N, ∞) .
(B.11)
For compute-efﬁcient training we have f = αN/αS ≈10% from the previous section, but researchers
typically use a much smaller value. Here, we choose f ′ = 2% as an estimate. For a ﬁxed value of the loss,
we predict:
Nf
Nf ′ =
 1 + f
1 + f ′
1/αN
≈2.7
(B.12)
Sf
Sf ′ =
 
1 + 1
f
1 + 1
f ′
!1/αS
≈0.13
(B.13)
Cf
Cf ′ = Nf
Nf ′
Sf
Sf ′ ≈0.35
(B.14)
So that compute-efﬁcient training uses 7.7x fewer parameter updates, 2.7x more parameters, and 65% less
compute to reach the same loss.
B.4
Suboptimal Model Sizes
We can solve A.1 to ﬁnd an expression for the amount of compute needed to reach a given value of the loss
L with a model of size N:
C (N, L) =

6B∗Sc
N
L1/αB
 
L −
Nc
N
αN −1/αS
.
(B.15)
Using A.6 and A.9, we can eliminate L in favor of Neﬀ(L), the model size which reaches L most efﬁciently.
From there, we ﬁnd an expression for the excess compute needed as a consequence of using a suboptimal
model size:
C (N, Neﬀ)
C (Neﬀ, Neﬀ) =
N
Neﬀ

1 + αS
αN

1 −
Neﬀ
N
αN −1/αS
.
(B.16)
The result is shown in Figure X. Models between 0.6x and 2.2x the optimal size can be used with only a
20% increase in compute budget. Using a smaller model is useful when accounting for the cost inference. A
larger model can be trained the the same level of performance in fewer steps, allowing for more parallelism
and faster training if sufﬁcient harware is available (see Figure Y):
S (N, Neﬀ)
S (Neﬀ, Neﬀ) =

1 + αS
αN

1 −
Neﬀ
N
αN −1/αS
.
(B.17)
A 2.2x larger model requires 45% fewer steps at a cost of 20% more training compute. Note that this equation
should not be trusted for very large models, as it is only valid in the power-law region of the learning curve
after initial transient effects.
C
Caveats
In this section we list some potential caveats to our analysis.
• At present we do not have a solid theoretical understanding for any of our proposed scaling laws.
The scaling relations with model size and compute are especially mysterious. It may be possible to
understand scaling at very large D holding model size ﬁxed [AS17], and also the shape of learning
curves late in training, by modeling the loss with a noisy quadratic. But the scaling with D at very
large model size still remains mysterious. Without a theory or a systematic understanding of the
corrections to our scaling laws, it’s difﬁcult to determine in what circumstances they can be trusted.

Left: We characterize the step on which early stopping occurs, as a function of the extent of
overﬁtting. The red line indicates a lower bound for early stopping that is derived in Section 5.3. Right:
We display train and test loss for a series of 300M parameter models trained on different sized dataset sub-
samples. The test loss typically follows that of a run done with unrestricted data until diverging. Note that the
degree of overﬁtting (as compared to the inﬁnite data limit) is signiﬁcantly overestimated by Ltest −Ltrain
(denoted by a black bar for each run).
• We are not especially conﬁdent in the prediction of Bcrit(L) for values of the loss far outside the
range we have explored. Changes in Bcrit could have a signiﬁcant impact on trade-offs between
data parallelism and the number of serial training steps required, which would have a major impact
on training time.
• We did not thoroughly investigate the small data regime, and our ﬁts for L(N, D) were poor for
the smallest values of D (where an epoch corresponded to only 40 steps). Furthermore, we did
not experiment with regularization and data augmentation. Improvements in these could alter our
results, quantitatively or qualitatively.
• We used the estimated training compute C ≈6NBS, which did not include contributions propor-
tional to nctx (see Section 2.1). So our scalings with compute may be confounded in practice in the
regime of very large nctx, speciﬁcally where nctx ≳12dmodel.
• We tuned learning rates, and we experimented with learning rate schedules. But we may have
neglected to tune some hyperparameter (e.g. intialization scale or momentum) that have an important
effect on scaling.
• The optimal choice of learning rate is sensitive to the target loss. When training close to convergence,
it may be necessary to use a smaller learning rate to avoid divergences. But when conducting a short
training run (eg due to compute limitations), it may be possible to use a larger learning rate. We did
not experiment with higher learning rates for training runs that did not proceed to convergence.

Supplemental Figures
D.1
Early Stopping and Test vs Train
In section 5.3 we described the result shown in Figure 16, which provides a prediction for a lower bound on
the early stopping step. We also show the train and test loss for a given model size when training on different
sized datasets.
D.2
Universal Transformers
We compare the performance of standard Transformers to recurrent Transformers [DGV+18] in Figure 17.
These models re-use parameters, and so perform slightly better as a function of N, but slightly worse as a
function of compute C. We include several different different possibilities for parameter re-use.
D.3
Batch Size
We measure the critical batch size using the data displayed in ﬁgure 18. This made it possible to estimate
Bcrit(L) in ﬁgure 10.

Sample Efﬁciency vs Model Size
It is easy to see from ﬁgure 2 that larger models train faster, and are therefore more sample efﬁcient. We
provide another way of looking at this phenomenon in ﬁgure 19, which shows when different models reach
various ﬁxed values of the loss.

improves greatly as well, improving by a factor of almost 100 when comparing the smallest possible model
to a very large one.

In addition to the averaged loss, individual tokens within the 1024-token context also improve
smoothly as model size increases. Training runs with shorter context nctx = 8 (dashed lines) perform better
on early tokens, since they can allocate all of their capacity to them.
D.5
Context Dependence
The trends for loss as a function of model size are displayed for different tokens in the context in Figure 21.
We see that models trained on nctx = 1024 show steady improvement with model size on all but the ﬁrst
token.
Fixing model size, it appears that the loss scales as a power-law as a function of position T in the context, see
Figure 20. This may be a consequence of underlying power-law correlations in language [EP94, ACDE12,
LT16], or a more general feature of the model architecture and optimization. It provides some suggestion for
the potential beneﬁts (or lack thereof) from training on larger contexts. Not only do larger models converge
to better performance at T = 1024, but they also improve more quickly at early tokens, suggesting that larger
models are more efﬁcient at detecting patterns with less contextual information. In the right-hand plot we
show how per-token performance varies for a ﬁxed model as a function of the training step. The model begins
by learning short-range information, and only learns longer-range correlations later in training.
We have also included models trained with a tiny context nctx = 8 in order to compare with our longer
context models. Even modestly sized models trained on nctx = 8 can dominate our largest nctx = 1024
models on very early tokens. This also suggests that further improvements should be possible with much
larger models trained on large contexts.
D.6
Learning Rate Schedules and Error Analysis
We experimented with a variety of learning rates and schedules. A host of schedules and resulting test
performances for a small language model are plotted in Figure 22. We conclude that the choice of learning
rate schedule is mostly irrelevant, as long as the total summed learning rate is sufﬁciently large, and the
schedule includes a warmup period and a ﬁnal decay to near-vanishing learning rate. Variations among

We test a variety of learning rate schedules including cosine decay, linear decay, as well as other
faster/slower decays schedules on a 3 million parameter model, shown on the left. For these experiments we
do not decay to zero, since we ﬁnd that this tends to give a ﬁxed improvement close to the end of training.
We ﬁnd that, as long as the learning rate is not too small and does not decay too quickly, performance does
not depend strongly on learning rate. Run-to-run variation is at the level of 0.05 in the loss, so averaging
multiple runs is necessary to validate performance changes smaller than this level.

The trend for performance as a function of parameter count, L(N), is ﬁt better by a power law

schedules appear to be statistical noise, and provide a rough gauge for the scale of variation between different
training runs. Experiments on larger models suggest that the variation in the ﬁnal test loss between different
random seeds is roughly constant in magnitude for different model sizes.
We found that larger models require a smaller learning rate to prevent divergence, while smaller models can
tolerate a larger learning rate. To implement this, the following rule of thumb was used for most runs:
LR(N) ≈0.003239 + −0.0001395 log(N)
(D.1)
We expect that this formula could be improved. There may be a dependence on network width, likely set by
the initialization scale. The formula also breaks down for N > 1010 parameters. Nevertheless, we found that
it works sufﬁciently well for the models we considered.
D.7
Fit Details and Power Law Quality
We experimented with a number of functional forms for the ﬁts to L(N), L(C), and L(D); the power-law
ﬁts were qualitatively much more accurate than other functions such as logarithms (see Figure 23).
For L(C), we do not include small models with only 1 layer in the ﬁt, as the transition from 1 to 2 layers
causes a noticable lump in the data. For L(N) we also do not include very small models with only 1 layer in
the ﬁt, and we exclude the largest models that have not trained fully to convergence. Fit parameters change
marginally if we do include them, and the trend extrapolates well in both directions regardless.
D.8
Generalization and Architecture
In ﬁgure 24 we show that generalization to other data distributions does not depend on network depth when we
hold the total parameter count ﬁxed. It seems to depend only on the performance on the training distribution.
